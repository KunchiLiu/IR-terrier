	<brief_summary>This research study vaccine allergy Japanese Red Cedar . The vaccine call CryJ2-DNA-LAMP Plasmid vaccine . This research study determine vaccine tolerate research participant respond vaccine use different route administration , Intradermal ( ID ) route . CryJ2-DNA-LAMP Plasmid vaccine investigational , mean approve use United States Food Drug Administration ( FDA ) available research study like one . The study Phase IC study ass evaluate safety immunological response therapeutic dos dose regimen 1.08 mg 2.16 mg CryJ2-DNA-LAMP plasmid vaccine deliver intradermally ( ID ) use Biojector 2000 device , administer every 14 day subject atopic sensitivity Japanese Red Cedar pollen , identify skin test reactivity pollen . The protocol three subject cohort : Cohort 1 : compose atopic non-atopic subject ( half atopic half non-atopic ) , receive saline control administer use Biojector 2000 device ; Cohort 2 : atopic subject , receive 2.16 mg per dose four ( 4 ) dose regimen use Biojector 2000 device ; Cohort 3 : atopic subject , receive 1.08 mg per dose four ( 4 ) dose regimen vaccinate use Biojector 2000 device.The study conduct 1 study center . Subjects enrol trial period 132 day . The objective statistical analysis establish safety explore immunogenicity LAMP-vax vaccine use different route administration , Intradermal ( ID ) route . All statistical analysis conduct data trial exploratory nature . The primary objective Phase IC Study evaluate safety immunological response therapeutic dos dose regimen CryJ2-DNA-LAMP plasmid vaccine deliver intradermally ( ID ) use Biojector 2000 device .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>A safety Immunological assessment JRC sensitive ( atopic ) subject assessed term current skin test reactivity . Subjects eligible participate study assign whether sensitive non sensitive CryJ2 Mountain Cedar one 3 study vaccine cohort : Cohort 1 : These Japanese Red Cedar atopic non-atopic subject recruit placebo control . This cohort compose 5 atopic 5 non-atopic subject ( half subject atopic half non-atopic ) , receive 4 vaccination , 14 day apart , saline control four separate 0.200 ml volume administer Intradermally ( ID ) use needle-free Biojector device . Cohort 2 : These Japanese Red Cedar atopic subject receive intradermal ( ID ) injection CryJ2-DNA-LAMP vaccine previously use Phase IA IB study . Cohort # 2 receive four ( 4 ) 2.16 mg dos 14 day interval . Each 2.16 mg dose require administration four ( 4 ) separate 0.200 ml volume 2.7 mg/ml vaccine concentrate use needle-free Biojector device . Each four volume injected different site different deltoid muscle . Cohort 3 : These Japanese Red Cedar atopic subject receive intradermal ( ID ) injection CryJ2-DNA-LAMP vaccine previously use Phase IA IB study . Cohort # 3 receive four ( 4 ) 1.08 mg dos 14 day interval . Each 1.08 mg dose require administration two ( 2 ) separate 0.200 ml volume 2.7 mg/ml vaccine concentrate use needle-free Biojector device . Each four volume injected different site different deltoid muscle . There 18 26 men woman participate study one location . Your participation study last approximately 132 day .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>1 . Male female subject age 18 63 year , either : 1 . Japanese Red Cedar pollen Mountain Cedar positive skin test , 2 . Presence antiCryJ2 antibody . Subjects assign Cohorts 1 , 2 3 . Half cohort 1 compose Japanese Red Cedar pollen Mountain Cedar positive atopic subject , half compose nonatopic subject . 2 . Execute write informed consent ( English appropriate ; Japanese subject prefers ) participate study . 3 . For subject enrol Cohorts 2 , 3 half cohort 1 , document allergy Japanese Red Cedar pollen demonstrate positive epicutaneous skin test Japanese Red Cedar pollen Mountain Cedar antigen ( wheal &gt; 3 mm great negative control ) . Although subject may positive skin test allergen , use qualify participate study . 4 . Female subject childbearing potential , define surgically sterile least 2 year postmenopausal , must agree use one follow form contraception duration study : hormonal ( oral , implant , injection ) begin &gt; 30 day prior screen , barrier ( condom , diaphragm spermicide ) , intrauterine device ( IUD ) , vasectomized partner ( 6 month minimum ) . 5 . Subjects healthy without clinically significant abnormal finding physical examination , exception HEENT ( head , eye , ear , nose throat ) finding consistent allergic rhinitis , medical history , clinical laboratory result screen , opinion Investigator , would jeopardize safety subject impact validity study result . 6 . Subject must willing able comply study requirement , include availability study period . 1 . Previous Japanese red cedar allergen immunotherapy [ ( Subcutaneous Immunotherapy ( SCIT ) , oral immunotherapy , SLIT ( Sublingual Immunotherapy ) , recombinant peptide ] . 2 . History anaphylaxis require medical intervention . 3 . Intolerance severe allergic reaction previous immunotherapy ( SCIT , oral immunotherapy , SLIT , recombinant peptide ) . 4 . History asthma require daily medication exception exercise induce asthma . ( History intermittent and/or mild asthma permit ) . 5 . Subjects receive antiIgE monoclonal antibody . 6 . Congenital immune deficiency acquire immune suppression . Causes acquire immune suppression may include , limited , systemic illness malignancy infection , use medication corticosteroid chemotherapeutic agent , radiation therapy . 7 . History organ transplant , hematologic malignancy , autoimmune disease , myocardial infarction , congestive heart failure . 8 . History clinically significant gastrointestinal , renal , hepatic , neurologic , hematologic disease , opinion Principal Investigator , would jeopardize safety subject impact validity study result . 9 . Inability unwillingness stop use drug may inhibit ability treat severe allergic adverse event . This include , limit ; beta blocker atenolol ( Tenormin ) , metoprolol ( Lopressor , ToprolXL ) propranolol ( Inderal , Inderal LA ) 48 hour prior visit . All subject must antihistamine therapy 7 day skin test . 10 . Female subject try conceive , pregnant , lactate . 11 .
