	<brief_title>Robotic Assisted Rehabilitation Heart Failure Patients Patients After Cardiac Surgery</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Rehabilitation heart failure medicine limit due many comorbidities reduce exercise capacity patient group . In patient cardiac surgery rehabilitation sometimes difficult especially due ICU- acquire weakness follow prolonged intensive care course . To tackle problem enable recovery rehabilitation many conventional method lack feasibility . During next decade increase number old frail patient field advance heart failure expect . To establish new method rehabilitation use technology well establish division medicine . Robotic assist gait therapy well establish neurology paraplegic tetraplegic patient , patient stroke traumatic injured patient . Gait therapy use re-establish normal course motion . The Lokomat ® ( Hocoma AG ) therefore use 25 country worldwide . The combination different training mode ( interval training , endurance training resistance training ) one advantage . The important benefit possibility extend relieve robotic assistance point without support one hand full support Lokomat ® hand relieve patient partly complete bodyweight . This enable therapist plan possible individual training almost independent exercise capacity patient . Up heart failure contraindication training Lokomat ® trial perform cardiac surgery . Therefore clinical trial necessary establish method field heart failure medicine cardiac surgery . In prospective trial investigate two point feasibility trial first , healthy person patient NYHA 1 le trained safety reason , establish possible protocol get familiar robotic assist gait therapy . In prospective trial train patient stable heart failure ( NYHA 2 NYHA 3 ) leave ventricular ejection fraction le 45 % 4 week 3 training per week . Timeframe heart failure Patients : Screening day0 ; Baseline/Start train day0 + ( 0-5days ) ; train period day0+ ( 0-5days ) 4 Weeks , 28 day train Lokomat® . Each week three training period ; End Study Visit 4 5 Weeks baseline . Timeframe patient cardiac surgery : Screening day0 ; baseline/start train day0 + ( 0-2days ) ; train period one week Lokomat® three training session ; end study visit one week , telephone follow twelve week hospital discharge evaluate possible deep sterna wound infection . Due character pilot trial , statistical end point , stress test ( spiroergometry ) , blood sample ( interleukin 6 , CRP , BNP ) , strength measurement Musc . quadriceps quality life questionnaire ( SF 36 ) take baseline ( day0 ) 4 week training period end study visit . Patients cardiac surgery train another strategy . There safety aspect important pilot trial . Patients cardiac surgery train Lokomat® initial hospitalization one week three session . A six minute walk test measurement quadriceps peak force do baseline/start training day0 , expect day 3 14 surgery , one week train end study visit day seven . A telephone follow patient three month hospital discharge do possible deep sternal wound infection . Each train heart failure group last 30-45minutes . The heart failure group contain 5-6 patient . The training postcardiotomy group last 10-40minutes depend patient postoperative status . The postcardiotomy group contain 10 patient . 20 patient receive normal postoperative physiotherapy serve control group .</detailed_description>
