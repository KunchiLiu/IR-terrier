	<brief_summary>After surgery , chance complication . After lung surgery remove tumour , particularly high chance person develop infection need help breathing , call post operative pulmonary complication . Currently , risk complication reduce completion light physical deep breathing exercise walk around soon possible surgery . Another possible way help patient use small device call Incentive Spirometer encourage measure deep breathing . This study want compare often postoperative pulmonary complication happen major lung surgery group complete exercise alone group use Incentive spirometer addition exercise . It hop combined therapy reduce amount time patient must stay hospital , few complication event few patient re-admitted back hospital go home , patient overall good outcome .</brief_summary>
