	<brief_summary>The investigator ' research group work develop highly effective , low cost non-surgical method permanent contraception woman . To support goal , need know normal fallopian tube ( tube pass egg ovary womb ) . The purpose study learn menstrual cycle hormonal contraceptive affect tubal patency . Normally open tube uterus permit flow fluid cell . If opening block , result infertility . Tubal patency woman 's fallopian tube block . Tubal patency determine x-ray test call hystero- ( uterus ) salpingo- ( fallopian tube ) graphy ( HSG ) . HSG standard radiological imaging study use determine fallopian tube open free disease . It commonly do woman infertility diagnosis . The investigator usually test first 10 day menstrual cycle . Sometimes tubes appear block HSG actually open . The timing HSG study menstrual cycle , use hormonal contraception may make difference whether tube appear block HSG actually patent . The result HSG test provide good model nonsurgical permanent contraception method might work . The investigator think tubes patent , treatment work well . Therefore , study want learn menstrual cycle time current hormonal contraception use affect patency tube assess HSG . The investigator want examine woman see tubal patency change menstrual cycle use birth control pill birth control shot .</brief_summary>
