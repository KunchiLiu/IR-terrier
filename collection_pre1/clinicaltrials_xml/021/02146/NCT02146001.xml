	<brief_summary>This study randomize trial compare effect two , 12-week activity intervention pattern physical activity , physical health , quality life measure 40 older adult able walk exercise . One intervention target 150 minute per week home-based moderate exercise ( e.g . brisk walking ) , consistent current recommendation . The intervention target decrease time spend sedentary behavior ( e.g . sit ) 60 minute per day . Both intervention wear activity armband allow self-monitor activity sedentary behavior real time use smartphone . The armband also provide objective data interventionist facilitate intervention . The main outcome time spend moderate exercise .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Reducing Sedentary Behavior vs. Increasing Physical Activity Older Adults</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Specific Aims : This application propose randomize community-dwelling , old adult one two , 12-week activity intervention target either increase moderate-to-vigorous physical activity ( MVPA ) decrease sedentary behavior ( SED ) . The primary aim research evaluate effect behavioral intervention target decrease SED vs. increase MVPA objectively monitor activity ( minute SED MVPA ) . The secondary aim evaluate effect SED intervention vs. MVPA intervention functional psychosocial outcome . To investigator knowledge , research provide unique experimental evidence SED alter old adult population yield key pilot data expect effect size intervention target SED vs. MVPA . Background : The old adult population least active age group U.S. two distinct metric : lack MVPA high rate SED ( sit without significant exertion ) . This represent public health opportunity engage 150 minute MVPA know improve risk morbidity , mortality , physical function . SED emerge risk factor adverse outcome , independent MVPA , observational study indicate SED link increase risk clinical outcome ( mortality , diabetes , cardiovascular disease ) bad age outcome , e.g . physical function . However , exist experimental data compare intervention reduce SED vs. increase MVPA old adult . Summary Methods : The investigator propose 2-arm randomized trial target increase MVPA ( Get Active ) vs. decrease SED ( Sit Less ) among community-dwelling , old adult Pepper Center Mobility Registry . The intervention consist combination in-person ( Weeks 1-4 , 6 , 8 , 10 ) phone-based ( Weeks 5 , 7 , 9 , 11 ) individual counseling utilize BodyMedia® Fit System ( wearable armband technology interface ) provide real-time feedback daily MVPA SED , use subject self-monitor interventionist improve adherence . Assessments baseline 12 week include objectively monitored minute MVPA SED blind armband , physical function ( short physical performance battery , 400 meter walk , grip strength , gait speed ) , assessment subjective MVPA , SED , physical function , psychosocial outcome questionnaire .</detailed_description>
