	<brief_summary>The purpose study compare diagnosis management ( treatment disposition ) adult emergency department patient acute nontraumatic abdominal pain tenderness , base two CT technique : 1 . Standard ( complete ) abdominal-pelvic CT . The American College Radiology call cephalad limit abdominal CT begin dome diaphragm , caudad limit pelvic CT extend ischial tuberosity . 2 . A z-axis restricted subset image digitally obtain original CT dataset , determine region tenderness identify examine emergency physician mark patient prior performance CT . This z-axis restricted CT require additional radiation exposure patient , produce computer extraction data original standard abdominal-pelvic CT . The investigator hypothesize diagnosis management differ guide two CT scan interpretation . Radiation dos calculate two technique .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>This prospective study inform consent patient subject . Informed consent obtain prior subject enrollment . The study protocol require follow step perform , describe detail later document : 1 . Potential patient subject identify research staff , virtue abdominal-pelvic CT order clinical evaluation nontraumatic abdominal pain tenderness , determine board-certified attend emergency physician . 2 . Research staff apply inclusion exclusion criterion confirm patient eligibility . 3 . Potential subject fail one inclusion meet one exclusion criterion record electronic research log reason exclusion ask participate study . Recorded information include age ( great 89 , simply record `` great 89 '' ) , gender , race/ethnicity , date , reason exclusion . No identifier record patient . The purpose information allow comparison enrol group patient abdominal pain undergoing CT . This part CONSORT flow diagram , allow reader understand potential selection bias understand probable clinical population context emergency department 's ( ED ) patient undergo abdominal CT. 4 . Eligible potential subject ( meet inclusion exclusion criterion ) ask participate study inform consent . The study introduce potential subject emergency physician caring patient . The study introduce CT evaluation abdominal pain tenderness order physician care patient , study inclusion criterion . Potential subject give inform consent participate record electronic research log enrol study . No identifier record patient . Recorded information include age ( great 89 , simply record `` great 89 '' ) , gender , race/ethnicity , date , reason exclusion . No identifier record patient . 5 . Patients give informed consent enrol study subject . 6 . Attending board-certified emergency physician place skin surface marker delineate region abdominal tenderness , use examination technique describe . Patient mark sticker supine position arm head , require CT . Attending board-certified emergency physician also place additional marker blind radiological interpretation respect actual area tenderness . Attending board-certified emergency physician also ask report work diagnosis , treatment disposition plan prior CT scan perform . An electronic standardized reporting form use . Reporting form design format electronic survey store password-protected server , design specifically research purpose . The information collect information attach appendix . 7 . Patient undergoes CT scan complete abdomen pelvis follow usual institutional protocol , concordant American College Radiology standard.1 8 . Images correspond region tenderness ( z-axis restrict ) load onto server . A board-certified attending radiologist blind remain CT image interpret z-axis limited CT image generate electronic report , use standardize research reporting system . The report electronically time-stamped alter . 9 . The attend board-certified emergency physician immediately provide electronic CT report z-axis limited CT. That physician immediately complete standardized electronic research reporting form , indicate current clinical diagnosis , treatment plan , disposition . The form electronically time-stamped alter . 10 . The board-certified attending radiologist interpret z-axis restricted CT immediately contact interprets complete CT , include available image . A report generate use similar standardize electronic research reporting system use z-axis restricted CT . The report electronically time-stamped alter . 11 . The attend board-certified emergency physician immediately provide CT report complete CT. That physician immediately complete electronic standardize research report form , indicate current clinical diagnosis , treatment plan , disposition . The form electronically time-stamped alter . 12 . Patient care proceeds accord usual clinical standard institution . 13 . Subject record review determine final diagnosis treatment .</detailed_description>
