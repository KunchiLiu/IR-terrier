	<brief_summary>Since finish sequence human genome 2003 , genetic research coronary artery disease ( CAD ) complex trait develop dramatically . Recent genome-wide association study identify considerable number common genetic variant associate disease . This lead new understanding also discovery new therapeutical target . However , variant discover minor effect disease development even pool variant explain minor percentage total heritability . It evident rare private mutation probably play great role genetic architecture CAD , especially among young severely affected patient . These may identify sequence . Therefore , investigator hypothesize , use exome sequencing ( read-off entire protein-coding region genome ) linkage analysis family extreme phenotype case , identify disease-causing genetic variant . From West Denmark Heart Registry investigator enroll minimum 120 patient atherosclerosis undergone coronary artery revascularization procedure age 40 , participate study part 1 . A pedigree analysis perform cardiovascular ( CVD ) risk factor current preventive treatment evaluate . 1. degree relative age 30-65 year , free CAD , invite participate study 2 . CVD risk factor evaluate well CT coronary angiogram perform quantify degree asymptomatic coronary atherosclerosis . Families study 1 2 , consider severely affected atherosclerosis , evaluate basis family size , number affect severity disease , select exome sequencing . Other relevant family member include well CVD risk factor evaluate . Exome sequence perform variant find filtered basis frequency , linkage analysis , gene position , exist knowledge in-silico prediction tool . Possible finding validate Sanger-sequencing causality new variant subsequently seek proven relevant experimental study .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Purposes Study part 1 : Quantify occurrence risk factor atherosclerosis among patient premature CAD Central Denmark Region investigate degree patient treat accord national guideline . Study part 2 : Investigate occurrence CAD among middle-aged 1st degree relative establish patient premature CAD . Study part 3 : Evaluate possible genetic `` risk factor '' family high CAD prevalence use exome sequencing analysis . Hypotheses Hypothesis 1 : Patients premature CAD modifiable risk factor , inadequately treat relative current national guideline . Hypothesis 2 : The occurrence premature CAD associate familial accumulation disease . Hypothesis 3 : The use exome sequencing select family phenotypic severe premature CAD identify disease-causing genetic variant . Method Study part 1 . Patients suffer premature CAD percutaneous coronary intervention ( PCI ) coronary artery bypass graft operation ( CABG ) do age 40 year select West Denmark Heart Registry ( VDHD ) . Specifically , patient treat Aarhus University Hospital ( AUH ) Skejby myocardial infarction ( MI ) , stable unstable angina pectoris period January 1st 2007 - December 31st 2013 recruit occurrence register risk factor evaluate ( sample indicate app . 170 patient per year ) . After informed consent obtain , participate research study . Participants interview cardiac outpatient clinic Dep . Cardiology , AUH , Skejby . The following information cardiovascular risk factor collect ; family history atherosclerosis ( pedigree analysis perform case diagnose CVD identify ) , prior medical history ( i.e . hypertension , dyslipidemia , diabetes , chronic kidney disease , vascular disease ) , smoke status number pack year , alcohol consumption vascular symptom ( i.e . angina pectoris , intermittent claudication ) . Gathered information compare registered information patient record VDHD . In addition , information localization invasive treatment , degree CAD , late estimate leave ventricular ejection fraction ( LVEF ) collate . All patient examine regard height weight , abdominal girth blood sample collect . An automated office blood pressure measurement ( Bp-TRU device ) perform . Levels creatinine ( e-GFR ) , total cholesterol , LDL cholesterol , HDL cholesterol , triglyceride HbA1c measure . Further , blood sample save prospective DNA analysis ( ) . The investigator evaluate degree treatment target meet accordance national guideline . Analysis correct reflect change treatment guideline , occur recent year . Study part 2 . Patients study 1 ( index patient ) request establish contact 1st degree relative 30 65 year age purpose participate Study part 2 . The form contact follow regular department guideline contact family member . 1st degree relative give inform consent include study part 2 ( participant ) . Patient record participant diagnose atherosclerosis obtain . Exclusion criterion former diagnosis CAD CTCA percutaneous transluminal coronary angiography , chronic atrial fibrillation , renal failure ( e-GFR &lt; 30ml/min ) , obesity ( BMI &gt; 30 indicative body geometry play role ) , former allergic contrast reaction pregnancy . A traditional risk profile blood sample collect study part 1 . Prior CTCA , LVEF estimate echocardiography . A CTCA perform accord standard protocol department . Initially CT-scan perform without contrast order estimate coronary calcification Agatstons method . Afterwards scan perform 70 ml iodine-containing contrast . ECG modulation radiation-reduced protocol use average participant ( 70 kg ) may expect receive radiation dose 3 mSv . The analysis contrast study focus automated- semi-automated plaque quantification . Non-cardiac finding describe accord department standard procedure Dep . Radiology , AUH , Skejby , medical intervention perform clinically indicate . Study part 3 . Families study part 1 2 , consider severely affected atherosclerosis , evaluate basis family size , number affect severity disease , select . Family member ( index patient , 1st degree relative relevant also 1st degree relative ) consent , include study part 3 . Contact relatives yet participate project attempt study part 2 . A traditional risk profile blood sample DNA analysis ( exome sequencing ) request already obtain . The analysis take place Department Molecular Medicine ( MOMA ) , AUH , Skejby , required equipment , software laboratory expertise performing test well bioinformatic analysis . First , genomic DNA purify fragmented size 200-500 base pair . Illumina TruSeq library ( use exome sequence ) produce Caliper Sciclone-robot exome enrichment Nimblegens EZ solution Exome v3 kit also take place . The dataanalysis take place MOMA guidance MOMA staff . First sequence trim aligned humane genome . Second , alignments fine-tuned variant call , include single nucleotide variant insertions/deletions various size . The interpretation data take place software program Cartagenia , give access abundance public commercial database also offer opportunity integrate private database . Variants filter basis frequency , gene position , exist knowledge different in-silico prediction tool . Possible significant finding validate Sanger sequence . Statistical analysis At find genotype study part 3 , couple analysis perform identify region genome share disease-affected individual . The use pedigree analysis couple analysis substantially reduce candidate interval genome , thereby increase statistical power identify disease-causing variant even small family . Because precise genetic architecture family structure include family know , exact calculation statistical power possible . In case dominant monogenetic disease , filtration base localization ( couple ) reduce potential variant app . 80 % within pair affect sibling 95 % monogenetic recessive disease , affected individual inbred family . Research Biobank A research biobank establish The Institute Clinical Medicine , Health , Aarhus University . A sample 2x4 ml ( BD Vacutainer K3E 7,2mg Ref . 368860 ) 1x4ml ( BD Vacutainer SST II Advance , Ref . 367957 ) blood participant study 1-3 submit biobank analysis . The sampling perform AUH , Skejby glass return envelope send patient draw blood family physician . The sample cryo-preserved exome sequencing perform participant study part 3 . The biobank carry project end purpose future research . In case future analysis preserve material The Research Ethics Committee participant ( still alive ) noticed hand . Permission store biological material apply continuously accord specify interval The Danish Data Protection Agency . All participant may demand biological material destroy time .</detailed_description>
