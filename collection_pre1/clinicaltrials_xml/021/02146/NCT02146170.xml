	<brief_summary>Background : - Lung cancer lead cause cancer-related death worldwide . It cause one million death every year . Researchers want gather tissue sample people lung thymic cancer understand disease well . This may lead new way diagnose treat . Objective : - To collect tissue sample use study lung cancer . Eligibility : - Adults age 18 non-small cell lung cancer , small cell lung cancer , extra pulmonary small cell cancer , pulmonary neuroendocrine tumor , thymic epithelial tumor . Design : - Participants screen medical history , physical exam , blood test . They ask perform daily task . - Participants may ask give urine blood sample . They may give saliva sample give blood . They also give sample tumor biopsy . They may also give option undergo biopsy . - Participants may MRI , CT , and/or PET scan body . They lie machine take picture body . - After visit Clinical Center end , researcher contact participant phone every year check health .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Tissue Procurement Natural History Study People With Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer , Small Cell Lung Cancer , Extrapulmonary Small Cell Cancer , Pulmonary Neuroendocrine Tumors , Thymic Epithelial Tumors</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRECIS Background : - Lung cancer lead cause cancer-related death worldwide , account one million death every year . - Several genetic epigenetic alteration involve initiation progression NSCLC . Some alteration see normal preneoplastic cell well , suggest sequential development normal epithelial cell cancer , multistep process , usually coincident cigarette smoking . - This natural history protocol extension Molecular Profiling protocol enable tissue collection in-depth proteomic genomic analysis understand tumor biology treatment response . - A cohort patient enrol natural history study likely enroll IRB approve protocol end-of-life in-patient hospice rapid autopsy follow death ( 13-C0131 ) . Longitudinally collected tumor tissue patient , include several metastatic site autopsy unique resource understand tumor evolution . - There opportunity embark upon wide array study future longitudinally collect tissue sample tag clinical information patient . Objectives : - To allow sample acquisition use study non-small cell lung cancer ( NSCLC ) , Small cell lung cancer ( SCLC ) , extrapulmonary small cell cancer ( ESCC ) , pulmonary neuroendocrine tumor ( PNET ) , thymic epithelial tumor ( TETs ) . Eligibility : - Patients histologically cytologically confirm NSCLC , SCLC , ESCC , PNET , TET . - Patients consulted Clinical Center without definitive diagnosis , clinically consider likely thoracic malignancy histology , pending tissue acquisition and/or pathology review . - Age great equal 18 year . Design : - This bio-specimen collection natural history protocol sample collect patient NSCLC , SCLC , ESCC , PNET , TET . - Eligible patient undergo screen participate NIH protocol eligible patient treat elsewhere refer oncologist refer participation study . - Upon provide informed consent , patient undergo sample acquisition procedure , may include tumor biopsy , blood , urine , abnormal body fluid cheek swab collection . - An accrual ceiling 2000 subject plan accrual period 10 year .</detailed_description>
