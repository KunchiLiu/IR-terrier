	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To examine activity safety adoptive therapy use ex vivo expand memory T cell enrich genetically-modified express cluster differentiation ( CD ) 19-specific , hinge optimize , CD28-costimulatory chimeric antigen receptor ( CAR ) well truncate human epithelial growth factor receptor ( EGFR ) ( Arm 1 : CD19R ( EQ ) 28zeta/truncated human EGFR [ EGFRt ] + central memory T cell [ TCM ] ; Arm 2 : CD19R ( EQ ) 28zeta/EGFRt+ naive memory T cell [ TN/NEM ] ) shortly follow lymphodepleting preparative regimen adult poor prognosis CD19+ acute lymphoblastic leukemia ( ALL ) . II . To determine Phase II recommend dose ( RP2D ) . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . To study additional antitumor activity endpoint CD19R ( EQ ) 28zeta/EGFRt+ TCM CD19R ( EQ ) 28zeta/EGFRt+ TN/NEM . II . To explore efficacy infusional cetuximab eliminate transfer CD19R ( EQ ) CD28zeta/EGFRt+ TCM CD19R ( EQ ) 28zeta/EGFRt+ TN/NEM . OUTLINE : This dose-escalation study . ARM I : Patients receive lymphodepleting regimen per treat physician 's discretion 3-10 day T-cell infusion . Patients receive CD19CAR-CD28-CD3zeta-EGFRt-expressing Tcm-enriched T cell IV 15 minute day 0 . Patients evidence disease , whose tumor ( ) continue express appropriate antigen target may receive optional second infusion CD19CAR-CD28-CD3zeta-EGFRt-expressing Tcm-enriched T cell 28 day . ARM II : Patients receive lymphodepleting regimen per treat physician 's discretion 3-10 day T-cell infusion . Patients receive CD19CAR-CD28-CD3zeta-EGFRt-expressing Tn/nem-enriched T cell IV 15 minute day 0 . Patients evidence disease , whose tumor ( ) continue express appropriate antigen target may receive optional second infusion CD19CAR-CD28-CD3zeta-EGFRt-expressing Tn/nem-enriched T cell 28 day . After completion study treatment , patient follow 24 hour , weekly 1 month , monthly 1 year , yearly least 15 year .</detailed_description>
