	<brief_title>Steviol Glycoside Use Restoring Muscle Glycogen Increasing Rate Glycogen Re-synthesis Muscles</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Test subject Healthy well train male subject select study . The subject complete test procedure twice , two separate day least 7 day apart crossover design , intervention - i.e . addition stevioside restitution meal - blind randomised test subject scientific staff . Inclusion criterion : Well train , healthy exhaustive train male , age 18 40 . Exclusion criterion : Persons suffer metabolic disease , related carbohydrate metabolism , diabetes type 1 2 , insulin resistance like , include test . Also person , prescribe medical drug diet supplement could affect carbohydrate metabolism , exclude study . Finally person capable complete fasting period test design exclude study . Before test Before test VO2-max maximal pulse determine test subject . The result test use determination work load test subject test . The test perform least 72 hour bicycle test commence . Experimental design : The bicycle test design work session purpose completely deplete muscle glycogen storage work muscle . The depletion muscle glycogen facilitate twelve hour fast period prior commencement bicycle test . The test person complete test twice two separate day least 7 day apart crossover design , intervention - i.e . additional intake stevioside together carbohydrate-containing composition bicycling work - blind randomised test subject scientific staff . During work session test subject exercise 2 hour bicycle ergometer 65-75 % VO2-max . Afterwards two hour bicycle exercise , person perform number one minute interval maximum workload . Every interval follow one minute break , subject pedal low intensity choice . This interval exercise continue test subject 's plasma glucose 3.89 mmol/l . This value select ensure glycogen storage liver deplete identical extent test . Immediately work session test subject give carbohydrate-containing composition comprise 2 g carbohydrate per kg body weight . Also 2 hour completion work session test person give carbohydrate-containing composition comprise 2 g carbohydrate per kg body weight . These composition add either 500 mg stevioside placebo ( starch corn ) . Tissue blood sample Before work session commence blood sample collect together muscle biopsy order determine content plasma glucose , plasma insulin , muscle glycogen commencement bicycle workload . Further blood sample collect 0 , 30 , 60 , 90 , 120 , 150 , 180 , 210 240 minute completion work session , muscle biopsy collect 0 , 120 240 minute completion work session . After collection blood sample centrifuge serum store -20Â°C . Parameters evaluate blood sample content glucose , insulin , glycagon , kreatine kinase , lactate dehydrogenase myoglobin . After collection muscle biopsy sample store liquid nitrogen . The parameter evaluate muscle biopsy glycogen .</detailed_description>
