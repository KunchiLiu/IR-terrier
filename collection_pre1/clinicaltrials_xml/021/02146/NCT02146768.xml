	<detailed_description>A . INTENT AND PURPOSE Background : Optimizing procedural patient outcome rely heavily tomographic image data guidance patient evaluate trans-catheter aortic valve replacement implantation ( TAVR ) provide accurate information aortic valve apparatus ( aortic annulus pertinent neighbor structure ) . The aortic valve annulus dynamic complex elliptical ovoid 3D entity also subject constant shape deformation across cardiac cycle addition influence thoracic intra-thoracic anatomy variation . Given inherent nature aortic valve annulus , electrocardiographic gate cardiac compute tomographic angiography ( CCTA ) , robust dynamic 3-dimensional imaging modality , widely accept `` gold-standard '' evaluate aortic valve apparatus ( AVA ) . To maximize information obtain CT , image need perform intravenous contrast injection.2 CCTA require administration iodinate contrast . The volume iodinate contrast medium concern many patient candidate TAVR frequently impair renal function.2 Contrast reduction adherence protocol prevention contrast-induced nephropathy recommended.2 For access planning via ilio-femoral route , group report direct aortic injection extremely low volume contrast . Reduction contrast volume CCTA AVA achieve use low flow rate coronary CT angiography . Although 5 mL/s typically recommend coronary imaging , 3 mL/s may sometimes sufficient image patient workup TAVR.2 Though suggest , CCTA low flow rate systematically perform validated population evaluate candidacy TAVR . And recommend guideline , standard bolus 80 mL 120 mL low-osmolar iodinate contrast usually necessary optimal TAVR CCTA scanning.1 In patient , reduce dose iodinate contrast time CCTA acquisition attempt minimize renal injury , time able accurately assess aortic annulus apparatus ( AVA ) paramount importance . Some reduction contrast nephropathy accomplish minimize contrast volume use iso-osmolar low-osmolar contrast agent . It suggest contrast volume threshold estimate use ratio contrast volume creatinine clearance . Nephrotoxicity likely contrast volume/creatinine clearance ratio exceed 3.7:1.12 And use , 3.7 x eGFR ( estimate glomerular filtration rate ) set maximal contrast dose image test invasive procedure.12 14 CCTA acquisition method Images acquire Brilliance 64-slice CT scanner ( Philips Healthcare , Andover , Massachusetts , USA ) . As per recommendation radiation protection cardiovascular CT Society Cardiovascular Computed Tomography ( SCCT ) , tube potential 100 kV consider patient weigh &lt; 90 kg body mass index ( BMI ) &lt; 30 ; whereas tube potential 120 kV consider patient weigh &gt; 90 kg BMI &gt; 30 . It adjust , base individual patient 's size , low set guarantee acceptable image noise suitable signal-to-noise ratio ( SNR ) perform analysis.15 The patient ' eGFR first calculate use MDRD ( modification disease renal diet ) GFR formula . The maximal allowable contrast dose CCTA calculate use 3.7 x [ ( patient 's BSA/1.73 ) x MDRD-eGFR ] .14 Next , dose contrast chosen CCTA &lt; 50 % maximal allowable contrast dose . The MDRD formula underestimate GFR 6.2 % patient chronic kidney disease 29 % healthy individual , make extremely suitable conservative approach calculate contrast dosing , tendency underdose never overdose contrast . With extensive experience , decrease total contrast dose CCTA AVA 45 ml satisfactory image quality SNR post-processing . Two separate acquisition ( ECG-synchronized aortic root non-gated aorta peripheral vessel ) may preferable ECG-synchronized acquisition entire volume reduce amount contrast agent.2 A total contrast dose 45 ml essential ECG-synchronized CCTA utilize 64-multislice CT scanner ( MSCT ) order obtain satisfactory image quality SNR aortic root . Depending remain amount allowable contrast , decision make perform non-gated CT aorta peripheral vessel either contrast low-dose-contrast protocol place selectively enhance ilio-femoral arterial region . The DICOM data post-processed workstation capable advanced image processing , manipulation optimal multi-planar reformatting . B . CLINICAL HYPOTHESIS AND OBJECTIVES Hypothesis : Low-dose-contrast CCTA effectively safely assess aortic valve apparatus , effectively direct trans-catheter heart valve ( THV ) size selection provide accurate annulus sizing , provide adequate pre-procedural risk-stratification guidance TAVR/TAVI . Study Design : The propose investigation retrospective cross-sectional study assess image quality safety renal standpoint low-dose-contrast CCTA traditional-dose-contrast , effectiveness low-dose-contrast CCTA analyze complex dynamic 3-pronged aortic annulus geometry pre-procedurally TAVR improve procedural patient outcome . The study cohort comprise 150 consecutive patient ( 75 patient receive low-dose contrast match body mass index 75 patient receive traditional dose contrast ) see THHBP January 1 , 2011 June 30 , 2013 . Statistical Analysis : The Bland Altman plot ratio method comparison utilized graph display scatter diagram ratio plot average SNR ascend aorta ( SNR-AA ) obtain two different acquisition ( compare image quality ) generate . A generalized propensity score ( adjust pre-operative clinical non-clinical factor ) approach account match use account possible confound association low traditional dose group annulus area , annulus perimeter , maximum minimum annulus diameter measurement . Moreover , adjust ( propensity score ) Kappa test , specificity , sensitivity use assess agreement low traditional dose group . The outcome : CT guide successful TAVR deployment ; unsuccessful TAVR deployment ( moderate-severe paravalvular leak , rupture , valve embolization , mortality ) ; acute renal failure define reduction ( pre v post procedure ) renal function define RIFLE criterion , occur use ass difference study group . Sample Size Considerations : A study cohort 50 patient enables detection minimum absolute difference 3 % primary outcome incidence ( power &gt; 80 ) assume Î±=0.05 , two-sided test . B1 .

Patient Population The study retrospective study 150 consecutive patient &gt; 18 year age ( 75 patient receive low-dose contrast match body mass index 75 patient receive traditional dose contrast ) see THHBP January 1 , 2011 June 30 , 2013 . Patients MDRD eGFR &lt; 25 exclude . The cutoff 25 chosen maximal allowable dose contrast eGFR 25 would 90 ml ( 3.7 x eGFR 25 ) , half maximal allowable contrast would 45 ml ( minimum require obtain CCTA acceptable SNR post-processing ) .
