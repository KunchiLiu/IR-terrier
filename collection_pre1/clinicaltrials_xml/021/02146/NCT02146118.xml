	<detailed_description>1 . Title stage study A Phase II Study Assess Efficacy Combined Treatment Erlotinib ( Tarceva ) Silybin-phytosome ( Siliphos ) Patients EGFR mutant lung adenocarcinoma 2 . Endpoints Primary Endpoint : tumour response rate Secondary Endpoint : progression-free survival , overall survival , safety assessment 3 . Inclusion/exclusion criterion Inclusion criterion 1 . Histological cytologic diagnosis stage IV lung adenocarcinoma confirm EGFR mutation 2 . Patients receive chemotherapy . However , patient receive postoperative adjuvant chemotherapy 6 month ago eligible . 3 . Patients lesion measure response-evaluation accord RECIST criterion ( least one evaluable lesion ) 4 . Patients age 20 year old 5 . ECOG performance status score 0 , 1 2 6 . Expected lifetime ≥3 month 7 . Adequate bone marrow liver function maintain 1 . Neutrophil count : &gt; 1,500/㎕ 2 . Platelet count : &gt; 100,000/㎕ 3 . Hb : &gt; 9.0g/dL 4 . AST/ALT : &lt; 2.0 x upper normal limit 5 . Bilirubin : &lt; 1.25 x upper normal limit 8 . Patients legally acceptable representative must complete write consent initiation study patient comply requirement study Exclusion criterion 1 . Symptomatic central nervous system ( CNS ) malignant tumor metastasis . However , patient treat CNS metastasis enrol disease radiologically stable asymptomatic . Asymptomatic patient without history CNS metastasis need screen . 2 . Evidence severe uncontrolled systemic disease investigator 's discretion ( e.g . unstable uncompensated respiratory , cardiac , hepatic renal disease ) 3 . Patients treat EGFR inhibitor 4 . Patients treat investigational product unapproved drug within 28 day enrollment study 5 . Pregnant lactate woman , patient childbearing agree use contraception 6 . Patients ineligible study investigator 's discretion 4 . Study Rationale Even though commonly accept EGFR TKIs effective EGFR mutation positive lung cancer patient , still remain resistance issue .

Overall survival ( OS ) , progression-free survival ( PFS ) , time tumour progression ( TTP ) estimate use Kaplan-Meier analysis . In addition , effect pre-treatment T790M response PFS analyze . 7 . Statistical method Object response rate ( ORR ) report 2-sided 95 % confidence interval . If evaluable number subject 42 number response 25 , study certainly imply treatment efficacy worthy investigation , perhaps Phase III randomize trial . Progression Free Survival ( PFS ) define time begin treatment object disease progression define RECIST death . Patient progress died time statistical analysis censor time last evaluable RECIST assessment . Kaplan-Meier plot PFS estimate median PFS present . Overall survival ( OS ) define time begin treatment death cause . Patient die time data cut-off , lose follow censor time last known alive . Kaplan-Meier plot OS estimate median PFS present .</detailed_description>
