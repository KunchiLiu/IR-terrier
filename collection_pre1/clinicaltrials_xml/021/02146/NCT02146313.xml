	<brief_summary>This Phase I , multicenter , open-label , dose-escalation study DMUC4064A administer intravenous ( IV ) infusion every three week ( q3w ) cancer patient . The study employ traditional 3 + 3 dose escalation design determine maximum tolerate dose ( MTD ) DMUC4064A platinum-resistant ovarian cancer . Once q3w recommend phase II dose ( RP2D ) identify , two expansion cohort ( one platinum-resistant ovarian cancer another unresectable pancreatic cancer ) may evaluate characterize safety activity patient population . Time treatment expect last approximately 1 year .</brief_summary>
