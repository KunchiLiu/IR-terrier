	<brief_summary>This study design investigate whether LCS12 associate increase risk unintended pregnancy compare Mirena copper IUDs . The objective ass among new user risk certain event ( e.g . contraceptive failure rate , ectopic pregnancy , uterine perforation , PID ) associate use LCS12 compare establish hormonal IUD Mirena , compare establish copper IUDs standard clinical practice . In addition , drug utilization pattern describe .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>European Active Surveillance Study LCS12</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Intrauterine contraceptive method , Mirena copper IUDs , high contraceptive efficacy . LCS12 new intrauterine system , like Mirena , contain levonorgestrel ( LNG ) , T-body dimension insertion tube diameter LCS12 small . Because lack comparative data LCS12 intrauterine contraceptive , unclear whether difference contraceptive failure rate LCS12 either Mirena copper IUDs . In addition , transcervical procedure , include insertion intrauterine device , potentially associate risk infection/inflammation . EURAS-LCS12 prospective , control , non-interventional , active surveillance cohort study three user cohort : LCS12 , Mirena copper IUDs . Study participant recruit network health care professional follow active surveillance collect information regard outcomes interest major safety outcome . All self-reported clinical outcome interest validate health care professional . The primary endpoint unintended pregnancy . Secondary endpoint ectopic pregnancy , uterine perforation , pelvic inflammatory disease ( PID ) . Study Amendment ( Approved PRAC September 29 , 2016 ) : The primary objective study assess contraceptive failure risk Jaydess , Mirena , copper IUD use study population representative real user individual IUDs . Interim analysis show high proportion IUD user age group &gt; = 40 year age . Given fact age distribution remain considerably skew , Pearl Index influence age participant , independent Safety Monitoring Advisory Council decide suggest narrow study inclusion criterion , i.e . age restriction &lt; 40 year old study entry suggest remain recruitment phase . All analyse regard unintended pregnancy ( include ectopic pregnancy ) conduct use complete cohort ( i.e . include study participant age 40 year old ) . In addition , analyse do include woman age group 40 year . Further age-stratified analysis outcomes also plan .</detailed_description>
