	<brief_summary>This partially randomized phase I trial study side effect well sequential dose vascular endothelial growth factor receptor ( VEGFR ) /platelet derive growth factor receptor ( PDGFR ) dual kinase inhibitor X-82 docetaxel work treat patient solid tumor . VEGFR/PDGFR dual kinase inhibitor X-82 may stop growth tumor cell block enzymes need cell growth . Drugs use chemotherapy , docetaxel , work different way stop growth tumor cell , either kill cell , stop dividing , stop spread . Giving VEGFR/PDGFR dual kinase inhibitor X-82 docetaxel one time instead concurrently may work treat patient solid tumor .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>VEGFR/PDGFR Dual Kinase Inhibitor X-82 Docetaxel Treating Patients With Solid Tumors</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To evaluate safety tolerability intermittent X-82 ( VEGFR/PDGFR dual kinase inhibitor X-82 ) administer 2 week , 1 week schedule ( Cycle # 1 ) . II . To evaluate safety tolerability intermittent X-82 administer combination docetaxel every 3 week ( Cycle # 2 ) . III . To determine change vascular parameter use 3'Deoxy-3'-fluorothymidine ( FLT ) positron emission tomography ( PET ) /computed tomography ( CT ) X-82 alone ( Cycle # 1 ) . IV . To determine change vascular parameter use FLT PET/CT X-82 combination docetaxel ( Cycle # 2 ) . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . To determine objective response use Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors ( RECIST ) 1.1 intermittent X-82 docetaxel . II . To measure change plasma vascular endothelial growth factor ( VEGF ) level change FLT PET/CT . III . To measure change X-82 pharmacokinetics change FLT PET/CT . TERTIARY OBJECTIVES : I . To evaluate safety tolerability sequential X-82 docetaxel disease sub-populations . ( Dose expansion cohort ) II . To evaluate objective response rate sequential X-82 docetaxel disease sub-populations . ( Dose expansion cohort ) OUTLINE : Patients randomize 1of 2 treatment arm . ARM I : Patients receive high dose VEGFR/PDGFR dual kinase inhibitor X-82 orally ( PO ) daily ( QD ) day 2-15 . Beginning course 2 , patient also receive docetaxel intravenously ( IV ) 60 minute day 1 . ARM II : Patients receive low dose VEGFR/PDGFR dual kinase inhibitor X-82 PO QD day 2-15 docetaxel IV Arm I . In arm , course repeat every 21 day absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . EXPANSION COHORT : Patients receive VEGFR/PDGFR dual kinase inhibitor X-82 Arm I docetaxel IV 60 minute day 1 . Courses repeat every 21 day absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity .</detailed_description>
