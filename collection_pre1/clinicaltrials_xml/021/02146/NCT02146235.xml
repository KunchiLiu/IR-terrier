Inclusion criterion define enrolled Pulmonary Rehabilitation ( PR ) program well ability attend music therapy session least week 5 6 weekly session . The patient require medically stable simultaneously allow participate pulmonary rehabilitation program . Standard , routine pulmonary rehabilitative medical care use control music therapy plus PR patient selection provide computer generate randomization protocol . The intervention include live music listen visualization , wind play sing undertaken study effect perceive dyspnea , depression quality life . Patients allow choose easy play wind instrument i.e recorder , slide whistle , harmonica , etc . instruct use . Ninety- eight subject evaluate potential candidate study . Thirty exclude would commit participate require number music therapy session either due anticipated time commitment personal/medical concern . The 68 patient agree participate investigation ( Age Mean : 70.1 ) , randomize 38 allocated treatment group 30 control group . These 68 patient newly enrol Alice Lawrence Center voluntarily seek participate active PR advertising flyer post community throughout hospital affiliated office practice . The weekly music therapy session last 45 min , period 6 week , group 6 participant less . 2- Method At begin end session patient ask score intensity current breathlessness draw circle different picture lung represent extent dyspnea ( VAS ) These record measure would collect end session , order evaluate subjective effect treatment patient perception dyspnea . CRQ BDI also administer begin PR program subsequently 6 week , end PR program . In music therapy group , every session include music visualization , wind instrument playing , singing , provide direct method work breath control offer active music-making experience support optimal breathing , foster self-expression , increase opportunity cop challenge chronic respiratory disease . 3-Outcome measure Primary outcomes depressive symptom , disease-specific quality life factor , patient ' perceive dyspnea : - Depressive symptom evaluate use Beck Depression Inventory 2nd edition-Fast Screen ( BDI-FS ) , 7-item subscale BDI-II .

Dyspnea relate patient 's symptom shortness breath difficulty breathe . Mastery relate patient 's sense control disease symptom . Emotion relate patient 's general mood . Fatigue relate patient 's energy level . We measure CRQ-SR domain score time enrolment study completion , immediately follow final session six week ) . - Visual Analogue Scale ( VAS ) scale .
