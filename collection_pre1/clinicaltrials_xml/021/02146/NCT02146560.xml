	<brief_summary>Background main study question : Cardiac complication common cause morbidity non-cardiac surgery . Patients perioperative myocardial injury ( MI , low level cardiac troponin elevation ) experience high short-term long-term mortality . They also substantially increase risk additional cardiac non-cardiac complication . It therefore plausible myocardial injury adversely affect quality life . This study compare postoperative health-related quality life patient experience perioperative myocardial injury ( define troponin-I &gt; 0.07ng/ml ) non-cardiac surgery Study Design : Pilot prospective cohort study ( n = 300 ) . Population : Consecutive patient undergo non-cardiac , non-transplant surgery UHN . Background secondary study question : 1 . Clinically base risk stratification tool use non-cardiac surgery ( e.g. , Revised Cardiac Risk Index ) moderate utility assign patient broad risk category . This study examine usefulness pre-operative biomarkers ( BNP , HbA1c , others ) support cardiac risk stratification address question : Is set preoperative criterion accurately inform decision monitor troponin postoperatively ? 2 . Intra-operative physiological derangement measure Surgical Apgar Score correlate morbidity mortality 3-months postoperatively . This study examine relationship Surgical Apgar Score ; continuous non-invasively monitored intraoperative metric hemoglobin concentration occult hypovolemia ( Pleth Variability Index ) Masimo Radical-7 Pulse Co-Oximeter ; primary secondary outcome . This aspect study address question : Can readily available intraoperative physiological data inform decision monitor troponin postoperatively ? 3 . Quality Recovery-40 Score evaluate ( recovery room 24 hour postoperatively ) patient 's subjective experience recovery surgery . This metric correlate quality life 3-months postop . This study evaluate correlation Quality Recovery-15 Score , valid efficient mean measuring recovery , primary secondary outcome . 4 . Approximately 2/3 patient postoperative myocardial injury asymptomatic ECG change . Diagnosis MI require biomarker elevation ( Troponin &gt; 0.3ng/ml ) plus clinical ECG image evidence myocardial injury . Of latter 3 criterion , 2 often absent . In selected patient , study use trans-thoracic echocardiography , CT coronary angiography , cardiac MRI improve diagnostic yield define diagnostic modality useful postoperative patient . Rationale : Postoperative myocardial injury may negatively impact health-related quality life . Affected patient may experience high level postoperative dependency . This possibility implications patient rehabilitation , provincial personal healthcare cost , well patient ' physical , emotional mental well-being relationship . The public health dimension problem could therefore significant . In addition , incomplete understanding exist individual patient cardiac risk factor , combination perioperative environment , result myocardial injury . The diagnostic investigation useful set yet clearly define . Patients fail rescue experience postoperative complication ( distinct failure avoid experience complication first instance ) play central role postoperative mortality . Early recognition patient therefore crucial . By prospectively observe cohort high-risk surgical patient , study provide insight factor interact . This allow u good characterize potential predictor feature postoperative myocardial injury . We hope finding aid identification patient characteristic associate increased risk postoperative myocardial injury , thus help direct diagnosis , early treatment rescue . This study thus potentially yield important data positively impact future patient care rational use healthcare resource .</brief_summary>
