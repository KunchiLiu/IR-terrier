	<brief_summary>As patient end-stage kidney disease society benefit tremendously live kidney donation , safety well-being kidney donor highly important objective live kidney donation . Laparoscopic donor nephrectomy several advantage open nephrectomy , less post-operative pain , good quality life short hospital stay . Therefore , laparoscopic donor nephrectomy nowadays treatment choice country . So far , modification technique laparoscopic donor nephrectomy , i.e . hand-assisted and/or retroperitoneoscopic approach , show significant benefit regard safety reflect conversion open postoperative complication rate . We therefore believe research focus optimization early postoperative pain concomitant use opioids . Since non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug contra-indicated nephrectomy , management postoperative pain largely depend administration opioids . Measures reduce postoperative pain would also reduce occurrence postoperative nausea vomitus , postoperative bowel dysfunction . A recent pilot study perform group show use low pressure pneumoperitoneum feasible significantly reduce deep intra-abdominal refer pain score first 72 hour surgery . Previous study perform others show low pressure pneumoperitoneum associate reduction systemic inflammatory response , post-operative pain analgesic consumption . Martini et al show deep neuromuscular block improve surgical condition laparoscopic surgery standard intra-abdominal pressure . To facilitate use low pressure pneumoperitoneum , deep neuromuscular block improve surgical condition might become prerequisite use low pressure pneumoperitoneum . Our hypothesis combination low pressure pneumoperitoneum deep neuromuscular block improve quality recovery early post-operative phase .</brief_summary>
