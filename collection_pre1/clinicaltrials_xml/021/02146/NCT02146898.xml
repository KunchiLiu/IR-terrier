	<brief_title>The Severity Of Hypotension Comparing Three Positions During Spinal Anesthesia For Cesarean Delivery</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Spinal anesthesia commonly use anesthetic cesarean delivery . In part , due ease administration , reliability low rate adverse effect . Additionally , avoidance general anesthesia allow parturient participate birth experience , despite surgery . Although hyperbaric local anesthetic solution remarkable record safety , use totally without risk . The side effect spinal anesthesia well describe , notably include hypotension ( low blood pressure ) . Spinal hypotension primarily due vasodilatory effect local anesthetic , would occur virtually woman prevent treated . The incidence hypotension literature clinical practice range 30 % 50 % patient . Recent literature use continuous , non-invasive blood pressure monitor suggest hypotension occur great frequency may associate high incidence adverse effect either mother fetus . The incidence degree hypotension associate fetal acidosis , sign either poor perfusion placental bed , increase metabolism due blood pressure medication . The effective treatment spinal hypotension uterine displacement use hip wedge ; use hip wedge spinal anesthesia standard care . Other treatment , include fluid administration either crystalloid colloid , either partially effective , clinical impractical , result administer large dos medication may negative effect fetus . Epidural anesthesia associate reduction incidence severity hypotension compare spinal anesthesia . This believe due slow onset sympathetic blockade epidural anesthesia ; slow onset allow physiologic compensation change blood pressure . Unfortunately , slow onset low reliability epidural anesthesia prevents routine use clinical practice cesarean delivery . The investigator hypothesize position patient spinal placement might play role severity maternal hypotension . Interestingly , study investigate posibility . Gori , et al . ( 1 ) study influence seat versus lateral position spinal placement Cesarean section . They find significant difference onset time , Bromage score motor block , recovery dynamic , use ephedrine two different position ; however , compare incidence severity spinal hypotension . Yun , et al . ( 2 ) find severity duration hypotension great hyperbaric bupivacaine fentanyl induce sit position compare lateral . Of notice , study , author focus immediate position spinal mediation inject ; none examine effect position injection phase spinal anesthesia rise . Density differences intrathecal injectate CSF may explain observed postural difference extent sensory block . Thus , height spinal anesthesia blockade could affect patient position spinal injection . A small incline position immediately spinal injection may slow rise spinal blockade without affect duration spinal anesthesia . In current protocol , investigator hypothesize slow rise spinal anesthesia , investigator might reduce severity hypotension .</detailed_description>
