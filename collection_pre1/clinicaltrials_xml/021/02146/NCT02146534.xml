	<brief_summary>Phase 4 , single center , double-blind , placebo-controlled study . Fifty ( 50 ) patient MacDonald criterion ( 2005 ) multiple sclerosis undergo active motor training per NeuroGym protocol , consist 3 session 1 hour per week period 6 week ( total 18 session ) . Half patient randomize receive prolonged-release fampridine 10 mg BID per label , half receive placebo BID . All patient continue take medication ( fampridine placebo ) subsequent observational period 8 week . Patients evaluate time -4 , 0 , 6 14 week . Study Objectives : Primary : To demonstrate MS subject treat prolonged-release fampridine 10mg BID show great benefit active motor training compare subject treat placebo term incidence responder , degree response , duration response . Secondary : To demonstrate MS subject treat prolonged-release fampridine 10mg BID show great benefit active motor training compare subject treat placebo term quality life measure .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Rationale study Prolonged-release fampridine ( 4-aminopyridine ) voltage-gated potassium channel block agent . It relieve conduction block demyelinate nerve fiber block voltage-gated potassium channel paranodal axon membrane vitro . It enhance synaptic transmission block repolarizing potassium current thus increase size presynaptic action potential thus increase transmitter release . It show multiple sclerosis patient improve walk capability measure time 25 foot walk test 20 % approximately 34 % subject . Prolonged-release fampridine also measurable effect motor evoke potential transcranial magnetic stimulation patient multiple sclerosis partial spinal cord injury . The brain dynamic plastic organ continuously adapt demand make upon . Prolonged-release fampridine improve nerve conduction multiple sclerosis patient potential enhance brain plasticity . Activities process call upon plasticity could therefore also benefit prolonged-release fampridine . Active motor training combine prolonged-release fampridine patient multiple sclerosis could therefore show large sustain measurable clinical benefit active motor train alone . Prolonged-release fampridine enhance brain plasticity improve nerve conduction central nervous system potentiate clinical benefit active motor training measure via assessment walk capability quality life subject multiple sclerosis vary severity .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Diagnosis McDonald criterion MS type age 18 old . Subjects meet prescribe criterion Fampyra per product monograph . Therapeutic stability ( MS symptomatic treatment ) 3 month prior screen duration study . Pyramidal system functional assessment score 2 great ability complete assessment without aid . Female subject childbearing potential must practice effective contraception study willing able continue contraception 30 day last dose study treatment . Any contraindication receive fampridine per product monograph include limited prior history epilepsy , renal dysfunction ( abnormal serum creatinine ) , concomitant treatment cimetidine quinidine . Ongoing treatment fampridine prior history fampridine intolerance ineffectiveness Any condition would preclude undergoing NeuroGym training .</criteria>
