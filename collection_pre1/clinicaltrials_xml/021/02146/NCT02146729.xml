	<brief_summary>In patient present Type A Type B1 , B2 thoracolumbar fracture , lack evidence demonstrate similar outcome patient treat percutaneous pedicle screw treat openly . It demonstrate percutaneous pedicle screw fixation fare well patient short term ; however , unclear whether outcomes equivalent inferior/superior compare open treatment . The author seek establish high-level evidence base determine clinical patient outcome , radiographic outcome , well cost-effectiveness data compare thoracolumbar burst fracture patient treat percutaneous pedicle screw , open treatment , brace treatment . Additionally , author seek establish data relate patient occupational data , complication , need surgery ( revision/removal hardware ) , well short-term variable relate hospital visit ( length stay , estimate blood loss , time fluoroscopy ) .</brief_summary>
