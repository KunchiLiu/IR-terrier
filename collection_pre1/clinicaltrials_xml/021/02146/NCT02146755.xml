	<brief_summary>Aortic stenosis common valvular heart disease , affect mainly people age 60 . It characterize year decade slow progression follow rapid clinical deterioration high death rate symptom develop . The onset symptoms confers poor prognosis : patient die within average five year onset angina , three year onset syncope , two year onset heart failure symptom . The overall mortality rate 75 % three year without surgery . Drug therapy remain ineffective , aortic valve replacement recommend long-term treatment .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES Primary Objective The primary objective study review current practice transthoracic echocardiogram ( TTE ) image measurement conjunction computerize tomography ( CT ) standardize measurement order improve accuracy diagnosis aortic stenosis ( AS ) . Secondary Objective The secondary objective study define true incidence low flow , low gradient severe aortic stenosis normal ejection fraction ( EF ) . BACKGROUND In recent year , advancement medical technology allow certain patient undergo less invasive approach aortic valve replacement transcatheter aortic valve replacement ( TAVR ) . In order appropriately select treatment option , anatomical measurement must accurately obtain utilizing TTE CT . According American College Cardiology/American Heart Association Practice Guidelines , severity f aortic stenosis determine definition aortic jet velocity , mean pressure gradient , aortic valve area ( AVA ) ( Bonow , 2008 ) . Mild Moderate Severe AVA ( cm2 ) 1.5 1.0 - 1.5 &lt; 1.0 Mean gradient ( mmHg ) &lt; 25 25 - 40 &gt; 40 Jet velocity ( m/s ) &lt; 3.0 3.0 - 4.0 &gt; 4.0 Rationale study Of great interest study calculation AVA diagnosis severity aortic stenosis . Since area directly measure echocardiographic image , calculate base diameter across leave ventricular outflow tract ( LVOT ) measure via TTE . The preferred modality measure AVA continuity equation : AVA= ( ( 〖Area〗_LVOT ×〖VTI〗_LVOT ) ) /〖VTI〗_AS Where LVOT = Left Ventricular Outflow Tract , VTI = Doppler velocity-time interval . Using TTE , stroke volume LVOT obtain measure diameter across LVOT . The continuity equation assume aortic valve annulus perfect circle ; , error measure LVOT result calculation aortic valve area . It also important consider anatomy aortic annulus circular , also contribute inaccurate calculate AVA . An underestimated valve area could lead diagnosis severe aortic stenosis appropriate . Recently , increase literature publish diagnosis severe aortic stenosis low mean gradient preserve leave ventricular function measure ejection fraction ( EF ) . It possible many patient severe AS misclassified underestimation LVOT diameter lead underestimation aortic valve area calculate continuity equation . This study aim define true incidence patient ensure aortic valve area measure accurately possible base current imaging procedure . In order determine accuracy TTE measurement current practice , study would compare LVOT diameter TTE LVOT diameter CT scan , inherently three-dimensional therefore accurate . The AVA subject re-calculated use continuity equation LVOT diameter measure CT . These re-calculated AVA compare original AVA obtain via TTE . In subject whose newly calculate AVA , utilize CT measurement , varies greatly TTE calculate AVA , original TTE image re-evaluated correct measurement . Additionally , subject TTE-measured LVOT diameter le 2 cm also re-evaluated correct measurement . The figure illustrate underestimated LVOT diameter use 2D echocardiography . Anumeha Tandon , Paul A.

( http : //www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1936878X12009497 ) PATIENT POPULATION This study observational , retrospective review data collect standard care . The study intend review chart 400 patient last 5 year underwent CT TTE within one-week timeframe workup aortic valve stenosis The Heart Hospital Baylor Plano ( THHBP ) Baylor University Medical Center ( BUMC ) . SUMMARY Enrollment Up 400 patient THHBP BUMC Design This study retrospective chart review previously collect standard care data . METHODS , STATISTICAL ANALYSIS &amp; DATA MANAGEMENT Patients classify severe non-severe AS base aortic valve area calculation per ACC/AHA guideline . Thus , patient AVA ≤ 1.0 cm2 consider severe AS . This also evaluate use two widely use criterion aortic valve area index body surface area . Severe AS consider AVAi ≤ 0.6 cm2 ( guideline ) ≤ 0.5 cm2 ( Braunwald 's text , Grayburn ) . Using three definition , patient also peak velocity ≥ 4.0 m/s mean gradient ≥ 40 mmHg consider definitely severe AS . Patients value &lt; 4.0 m/s &lt; 50 mmHg classify stroke volume index &lt; 35 mL/m2 low flow , low gradient severe AS . Further classification base LVEF ≥ 50 % &lt; 50 % . The former consider paradoxical low flow , low gradient severe AS preserve LVEF ( Hachicha , Circ 2007 ) traditional low flow , low gradient severe AS ( Tandon , Grayburn JACC Imaging 20130 &gt; The criterion use reclassify patient LVOT cross-sectional area determine CT scan instead echocardiography . Reclassification occur CT measurement LVOT AVA SVI , dependent LVOT area , generalize linear mixed model ( GLMM ) logistic link function use ass whether difference classification exist . The multivariable model stratify gender use perform pre-specified subgroup analysis ( re-measuring echocardiographic LVOT diameter subject `` re-classified '' CT ) . This do remeasuring traditional LVOT diameter locate 5-10 mm aortic annulus also measure juncture aortic leaflet LVOT mid-systole ( Mayo clinic way ) . The purpose analysis determine Mayo clinic method LVOT measurement reduces number misclassifications compare traditional method . Finally , investigator also examine CT data threshold value suggest erroneous outlier value echocardiography . Men woman assess separately . For example , value 1.6 cm often find echocardiography rarely CT scan subjective clinical experience .</detailed_description>
