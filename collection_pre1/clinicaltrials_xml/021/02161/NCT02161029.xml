	<brief_summary>The purpose study determine whether newly construct CE ( Conformité Européenne ) mark drill biopsy instrument flexible endoscope make possible representative biopsy increase number submucosal tumours gastrointestinal tract . The amount submucous tissue ( microgram % biopsy ) harvest new drill biopsy instrument use flexible endoscopy investigation measure study compare amount submucous tissue harvest exist biopsy forceps .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Flexible Endoscopy Biopsies Submucous Tumors With New Drill Instrument</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Background : With exist biopsy instrument flexible endoscopy 's possible achieve superficial biopsy comprise mucosa seldom small fragment submucosa . It , however , increasingly important get biopsy submucous tissue tumor increase stomach GIST ( GastroIntestinal Stroma Tumours ) grow submucosa . Cytology enough reliable diagnosis often representative . Furthermore well-known risk tract seed sample abdominal wall fine needle instrument . The investigator invent new biopsy instrument flexible endoscopy drill within cylinder use biopsy submucous tissue , instance GIST-tumours , see www.BIBBInstruments.com . Hypothesis : Will possible achieve representative submucous tissue gastrointestinal tract newly construct drill biopsy instrument flexible endoscopy . The investigator hypothesize amount tissue harvest new drill biopsy instrument give significantly amount tissue evaluate pathologist exist biopsy forceps . Method : Ten patient tumours submucosa stomach examine gastroscope . The investigator decide first biopsy take randomly investigator blindly get new drill instrument conventional biopsy forceps take biopsy decide localization . The next site tumour decide blindly investigator get one two biopsy instrument accord previously decide scheme . Six biopsy ( three two biopsy tool ) every patient harvest ten patient . With altogether 30 specimen biopsy instrument difference 1/3 low calculate difference 10 patient give 80 % Power ( Chi-2 = 5.40 , p = 0.02* ) . The amount submucous tissue harvest two biopsy instrument measure microgram percentage biopsy compare . The quality specimens also calculate .</detailed_description>
