	<brief_title>Phase II Study IMMU-132 Alone Combination With Carboplatin Patients With Triple-Negative Breast Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The primary objective evaluate safety efficacy IMMU-132 alone combination carboplatin administer 3-week treatment cycle 8 cycle , patient triple-negative breast cancer receive least two prior treatment . The secondary objective obtain data concern pharmacokinetics , immunogenicity . This multi-center study . Eighty patient plan enrol , equal distribution two group . All patient receive start dose IMMU-132administered once-weekly first 2 week 3-week treatment cycle . For patient assign also receive carboplatin , carboplatin also administer schedule start 30 minute completion IMMU-132 administration . Patients may receive maximum total 8 cycle ( 16 dos ) , patient complete response , partial response stable disease time , patient achieve objective response , relapse discontinue treatment , may continue treat base physician discretion . Follow require resolution stabilization treatment-related toxicity , patient stable disease objective response must also continue evaluation survive .</detailed_description>
