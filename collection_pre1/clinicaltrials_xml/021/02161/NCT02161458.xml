	<brief_summary>Alzheimers disease ( AD ) devastate illness , estimate affect 5 million patient United States alone project increase dramatically next decade population age unless preventive measure develop . The investigator preliminary evidence selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor ( SSRI ) antidepressant low amount amyloid plaque human brain . The intervention propose study effect SSRI ( escitalopram ) level amyloid beta peptide ( major constituent plaque ) cerebrospinal fluid ( CSF ) cognitively normal old adult . The investigator measure CSF Amyloid Beta level two week treatment escitalopram use double blind placebo-controlled study design approximately 30 cognitively normal participant , age 65-85 , Clinical Dementia Rating scale , [ CDR ] = 0 . They recruit community . Participants randomize ( approximately 15 per group ) . Participants three office visit : first visit screen consent participant randomize 1:1 receive escitalopram placebo two week ; second third visit lumbar puncture ( LP ) CSF analysis . Each LP visit take 2 hour . The second LP occur two week first LP . At LP visit , approximately 1Â½ tablespoon blood 4 teaspoon CSF obtain . Participants randomized escitalopram take 10 mg escitalopram 5 day , take 20 mg escitalopram remainder two week exposure period , taper 10mg 3 day . The current proposal test whether clinically relevant dos SSRI reduce CSF level Amyloid Beta healthy old human participant . The investigator hypothesize compare placebo , participant receive escitalopram show significantly low Amyloid Beta level second CSF sample .</brief_summary>
