	<brief_title>Safety Efficacy Study NTC-510 Treat Pain Following Dental Surgery Third Molars</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This Phase 2a , randomize , double-blind , placebo-controlled , dose-ranging study evaluate efficacy , concentration versus efficacy relationship , safety NTC-510 NTC-510A dose 2.0 , 1.0 , 0.5 mg . The study consist 4 phase : screening ( within 28 day check-in ) , check-in ( surgery Day 1 ) , treatment ( surgery , randomization , treatment study drug Day 1 ) , follow ( Days 6 8 ) . During screen phase , screen procedure perform , subject eligibility determine , write consent obtain . Subjects undergo dental surgery extract 1 2 third molar ( least 1 partial complete bony mandibular extraction ) . The impaction score ( [ 1 ] erupt tissue , [ 2 ] broken soft tissue , [ 3 ] partial bony impaction , [ 4 ] full bony impaction ) collect statistical adjustment randomization imbalance . The surgery conduct accord standard clinical unit procedure .</detailed_description>
