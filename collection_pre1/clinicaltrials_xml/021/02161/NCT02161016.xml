	<brief_title>A Clinical Study Outcomes Foot Ankle Bone Grafting Using map3® Cellular Allogeneic Bone Graft</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>map3® Cellular Allogeneic Bone Graft provide desired osteoconductive , osteoinductive osteogenic potential capacity essential optimal fracture heal bone graft implant . It offer viable MAPC-class cell scaffold comprised demineralize bone matrix ( DBM ) cortical cancellous chip . map3® Cellular Allogeneic Bone Graft consider allograft , , indicate bone repair orthopaedic indication autograft employ . The primary goal study evaluate outcome bone grafts foot ankle use stem cell modify allograft ( map3® Cellular Allogeneic Bone Graft ) . The study endpoint objectively determine via x-rays CT scan ass bony fusion , extremity evaluation use AFAS subjective patient score foot disability quality life .</detailed_description>
