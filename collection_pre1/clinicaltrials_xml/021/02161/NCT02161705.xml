	<brief_summary>Primary Objective To determine post-operative static pain score differ woman undergo bilateral mastectomy follow bilateral immediate tissue expander reconstruction randomize either ropivacaine- ( treatment ) saline- ( placebo ) pre-operatively place paravertebral block . Post-operative pain score measure 0-10 Likert scale 6 hour end surgery patient still hospitalize ( post-operative day 0 ) . This patient-provided data . Unblinded data analysis compare score treatment control group . Secondary Objectives To determine post-operative move pain score , opioids use , nausea , sleep interference differ woman undergo bilateral mastectomy follow bilateral immediate tissue expander reconstruction randomize either ropivacaine- ( treatment ) saline- ( placebo ) pre-operatively place paravertebral block . Pain score , opioids use , nausea , sleep interference data collect via patient self-report . When possible ( i.e. , hospitalize ) objective data opioids pain medication administer patient use . Tertiary Objectives To determine long-term change Quality Life score [ RAND-36 Health Survey , Disability Arm , Shoulder , Hand ( Quick DASH ) questionnaire , Breast-Q score ] differ woman undergo bilateral mastectomy follow bilateral immediate tissue expander reconstruction randomize either ropivacaine- ( treatment ) saline- ( placebo ) pre-operatively place paravertebral block . This data collect via validated questionnaire patient interview 3-months , 2-years , 4-years ( ±14 day ) surgery . Once enrolled study , participant encourage remain study 4 year follow surgery order get final pain score quality-of-life/health outcome survey information . Participants contact several phone attempt send 2 certified letter via US Postal Service 3-month , 2-year , and/or 4-year outcome assessment consider lose follow-up .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Pre-op Paravertebral Blocks Decrease Post-op Pain Following Mastectomy With Immediate TE Reconstruction</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This double-blind , randomize , control clinical trial compare patient-reported pain pain medication/narcotic use patient randomize treatment ( ropivacaine ) placebo ( saline ) deliver via paravertebral block mastectomy site . Candidates chosen mastectomy one side immediately follow tissue expander placement breast reconstruction . Patients randomize 1:1 ropivacaine- ( treatment ) saline- ( placebo ) paravertebral block double-blinded design . Patient-specific surgical detail record intraoperatively . Following surgery , post-operative pain , pain medication/opioid use , occurrence adverse event ( AEs ) /serious adverse event ( SAEs ) assess Days 1 , 2 , 3 . A clinic visit occur Day 7 additional data collect ( updated medical history , pain medication/opioid use , AEs/SAEs , study questionnaire . Using two pain scale , Patient Pain Assessment Questionnaire ( Appendix A ) Subjective Pain Survey ( Appendix B ) , post-operative pain compare treatment control group . Differences opioids use group different time point also assess objective measure post-operative pain . Long-term quality-of-life/health outcome assessments do post-operative Day 90 ( ±14 day ) , Year 2 ( ±14 day ) , Year 4 ( ±14 day ) . The Year 2 Year 4 follow-up include tertiary endpoint capture differences chronic pain , patient ask complete questionnaire Day 90 follow . The investigator hypothesize post-operative static pain score low ropivacaine patient vs. placebo patient woman undergo mastectomy immediate reconstruction placement tissue expanders . We believe post-operative move pain score , opioids use , nausea , sleep interference likewise improve . We hypothesize decreased post-operative pain may lead improvement long-term health outcome measure validated questionnaire . In presence clear need lack publish study regard precise patient population , important determine paravertebral block reduce post-operative pain , improve opioids use , nausea , sleep interference , length hospital stay patient undergo immediate tissue expander breast reconstruction .</detailed_description>
