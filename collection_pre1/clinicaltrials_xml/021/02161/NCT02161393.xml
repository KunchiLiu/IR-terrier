	<brief_summary>The primary aim study assess feasibility conduct trial investigate effectiveness physical activity intervention ( physical activity consultation pedometer-based walking programme ) versus pulmonary rehabilitation improve physical activity COPD . Objectives : ( ) ass feasibility ( patient recruitment , adherence , drop-outs adverse event ) deliver physical activity intervention COPD patient population versus pulmonary rehabilitation ; ( ii ) explore user perception relate satisfaction benefit physical activity intervention versus pulmonary rehabilitation ; ( iii ) investigate within group change physical activity , exercise capacity , quality life , self-efficacy change transtheoretical model physical activity intervention versus pulmonary rehabilitation ; ( iv ) examine cost deliver physical activity intervention versus pulmonary rehabilitation patient COPD . The hypothesis study feasible conduct trial investigate effectiveness physical activity intervention ( physical activity consultation pedometer-based walking programme ) compare pulmonary rehabilitation improve physical activity COPD . The study provide important information intervention design promote maintain physical activity , improve patient outcome increase patient ' choice relate exercise physical activity intervention . It provide rationale data adequately power clinical trial evaluate effect physical activity intervention .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Physical Activity Versus Pulmonary Rehabilitation COPD</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>A survey pulmonary rehabilitation programme mirror result UK study highlight enough programme available; currently UK le 1.5 % patient COPD receive pulmonary rehabilitation per year . Only proportion patient target i.e . moderate severe disease . The majority program outpatient-based supervised clinician . This structure supervised format pulmonary rehabilitation meet need patient high number dropouts non-adherence; yet alternative option increase physical activity patient COPD currently seem offer . A home-based pedometer-driven walking intervention offer alternative method deliver physical activity training could provide large number patient , low cost flexibility around life commitment . It would also provide patient choice decide whether participate exercise physical activity . To date study compare home-based walk intervention structure , supervise pulmonary rehabilitation patient preference cost two programme . For reason , need compare home-based-walking intervention standard method provide patient physical activity training , i.e . pulmonary rehabilitation . Therefore study essential ass feasibility conduct trial investigate efficacy physical activity intervention ( physical activity consultation pedometer-based walking programme ) versus pulmonary rehabilitation improve physical activity COPD .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>1 . The Patient must refer pulmonary rehabilitation . 2 . The Patient must Primary diagnosis COPD 3 . The Patient must good understand write English ( report individual patient ) 4 . The Patient must stable phase ( antibiotics time assessment ISWT ) , deem clinically stable clinical pulmonary rehabilitation team . 1 . The inability safely take part walk programme pulmonary rehabilitation ( e.g . unstable angina , neurological , spinal skeletal dysfunction affect ability exercise ) 2 . The inability comprehend follow instruction ( e.g . dementia ) . 3 . Clinically unstable ( Pulmonary exacerbation change symptom medication last 4 week )</criteria>
