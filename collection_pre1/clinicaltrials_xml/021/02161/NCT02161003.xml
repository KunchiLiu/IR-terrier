	<brief_summary>The problem incontinence impose considerable strain child parent . These patient suffer long-life handicap need support follow-up . The cost associate diseases clearly illustrated major component healthcare spending picture , may add hundred thousand dollar healthcare cost , well loss productivity work force . Fecal incontinence treatment difficult challenge surgeon several generation current traditional surgical result unsatisfactory . Mesenchymal Stem Cells injection may represent new attractive treatment option anal sphincter lesion . Moreover , experimental injury muscle anal sphincter rat successfully treated stem cell injection . In study , investigator shed light ability Mesenchymal Stem Cells induce myogenesis regenerate anal Sphincter patient fecal incontinence . It useful many Egyptian patient .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Stem Cells Therapy Fecal Incontinence Children After Posterior Sagittal Ano-rectoplasty</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>A stem cell capable form various tissue definite signal receive body . Stem cell research animal ongoing program west fruitful result . Current challenge use stem cell clinical practice solve many unanswered query . To study potential therapeutic effect local Mesenchymal Stem cell injection child present fecal incontinence ( FI ) posterior sagittal ano-rectoplasty ( PSARP ) operation high imperforate anus . Children suffer FI PSARP high imperforate anus include study . Autologous MSC upper posterior iliac crest bone marrow sample extract patient general anesthesia , suitable clean operation room . Will Cultured inject external anal sphincter defect use direct pena stimulator ultra sound guidance . Then follow 180 day post injection , assess ability mesenchymal stem cell induce myogenesis anal Sphincter patient FI PSARP .</detailed_description>
