	<brief_summary>This study investigate potential clinical benefit roniciclib give combination chemotherapy Carboplatin / Etoposide Cisplatin / Etoposide first line treatment patient extensive disease small cell lung cancer . Approximately 140 patient randomize ( 1:1 ) receive treatment either roniciclib placebo combination chemotherapy . Roniciclib oral ( i.e . take mouth ) protein kinase inhibitor . A kinase inhibitor target certain key protein essential survival cancer cell . The growth tumor may decrease prevent specific protein function . By specifically target protein , roniciclib combination chemotherapy may stop cancer growth . The primary endpoint ( meaningful result track ) study base progression free survival , i.e . time disease worsen . The aim show therapy roniciclib combination chemotherapy prolongs time disease worsen patient population compare patient receive placebo combination chemotherapy .</brief_summary>
