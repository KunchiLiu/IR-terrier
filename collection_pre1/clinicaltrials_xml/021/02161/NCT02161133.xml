This impairment also related poor adherence medical regime , make difficult GWV manage aspect GWI . Problem-solving consider one complex cognitive ability relate complicated behavior set goal , sequence multi-tasking . Despite publish report document deficit treatment target problem-solving deficit GWI order reduce disability . The investigator propose target treatment , Problem-Solving Therapy , compensate problem-solving deficit GWI thereby reduce disability . Problem-Solving Therapy , top approach , teach patient skills overcome problem like cognitive dysfunction physical symptom impact problem-solving . Compensating problem-solving deficit would reduce disability provide information effect treat one component GWI symptom GWI . This first trial cognitive rehabilitation therapy GWI .</detailed_description>
