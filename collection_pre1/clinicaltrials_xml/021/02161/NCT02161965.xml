	<brief_title>Vascular CalcIfiCation sTiffness Induced ORal antIcoAgulation</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Long term oral anticoagulant treatment ( &gt; 12 month ) mainly indicate atrial fibrillation , prosthetic valve condition high risk recurrent deep venous thrombosis . For 60 year , vitamin K antagonists oral anticoagulant drug available prevent thrombus formation . The use vitamin K antagonists associate major constraint well-adjusted anticoagulation lead minor/major risk life threaten bleeds . They also exhibit rare side-effects include skin eruption necrosis , hepatic disorder , alopecia . A less known side effect increase soft tissue calcification , include cardiac valve peripheral arterial system . This side effect explain inhibitory effect vitamin K antagonists central ( liver ) peripheral ( e.g . vascular ) carboxylation cycle synthesis several vitamin K-dependant calcification inhibit factor , matrix gamma-carboxyglutamate protein , osteocalcin Gas6 ( 1 ) . The active form gamma-carboxyglutamate protein identify potent local tissue inhibitor vascular calcification . The calcify effect decrease gamma-carboxyglutamate protein ratio carboxylate ( i.e . active ) /uncarboxylated ( i.e . inactive ) form gamma-carboxyglutamate protein report various acquire metabolic disease chronic renal insufficiency , age genetic origin ( e.g . Cutis Laxa , Keutel syndrome , â€¦ ) ( 2 , 3 ) well mouse gamma-carboxyglutamate protein -/- model ( 4 ) . Furthermore , administration warfarin rat well-known pharmacological model induce vascular calcification within 2-4 week increase systolic pulse arterial blood pressure ( 5 ) . Vascular calcification independent risk factor cardiovascular morbi-mortality well-demonstrated increase coronary calcium , measure scan Agatston score , independently link high risk event ( 6 , 7 ) . The low limb mediacalcosis ( i.e . Monckeberg disease ) also risk factor limb amputation calcification ( 8 ) atheromatous plaque represent risk factor plaque instability rupture ( 9 ) . The pathophysiological mechanism link dystrophic calcification process morbi-mortality still unclear . Calcium deposit within arterial intimal layer generally associate atherosclerosis increase risk plaque rupture whereas deposit calcium within medial layer peripheral artery ( i.e . mediacalcosis ) rather responsible increase arterial stiffness development arterial hypertension ( 10 ) . Recent data investigator laboratory show site heterogeneity assess scan score calcify process general population also genetically-determined calcify disease ( i.e pseudoxantoma elasticum ) . Two recently publish study point link use vitamin K antagonists enhance coronary ( 11 ) extra-coronary ( 6 ) calcification . Although conclusion study remain limited cross-sectional retrospective design , small number patient large range exposure vitamin K antagonist ( 6 143 month - mean 46 ) question potential deleterious effect peripheral vasculature mainly long term use non-vitamin K antagonists anticoagulant . One prospective control study post-menopaused woman demonstrate long-term beneficial effect supplement contain vitamin K1 D elastic property carotid artery ( 12 ) . Therefore , present study , investigator propose determine structural ( i.e . calcification ) functional ( i.e . stiffness ) impact anti-Xa inhibitor rivaroxaban compare vitamin K antagonists arterial structure longitudinal , prospective comparative study .</detailed_description>
