	<detailed_description>The ocular surface first line defense eye , therefore external threat sense , potential insult neutralise . Over course evolution , various microbe , especially bacteriae , come colonise ocular surface commensal . The commensal role maintain homeostasis ocular surface . 1 The innate immunity ocular surface active , consist active mechanism suppress inflammation 2 . For example , exist macrophage , dendritic cell , suppressor cell , regulatory cell , B cell , IgA , lysozyme , anti-microbial peptide barrier external agent . The normal commensal ocular surface maintain basal level activation innate defence stimulate pattern recognition receptor ocular surface epithelial cell . This normal composition microbe important since inflammation infection result introduction pathogenic strain overcomes flora , dominant strain secretes excessively immunogenic product , exotoxin A Staphylococcus trigger marginal keratitis , form type IV hypersensitivity . The flora load microbiome could also influence tear function high flora load find associate increased mucin degradation 3 reduce globet cell densitiy 4 . Previous study [ I 'm sure study ] SERI/SNEC also point importance microbe . For example , dry eye patient , increase lysophospholipids tear , may contribute inflammatory mediator arachidonic acid metabolite . The lysophospholipids form phospholipase A2 reaction , latter may microbial origin . Since dry eye know inflammatory disease ocular surface , one way microbes contribute pathology . The microbiome sum total microbe find body location . In eye microbiome investigate non-invasively accessible location ocular surface . Despite importance ocular surface microbiome , understand topic superficial largely base culture methods5-10 . This misleading microbe amenable routine cell culture presence may undetected representation under-estimated 11 . Recently develop metagenomics sequence , compare culture , advantageous get un-biased view microbiome11 . Three prior study evaluate microbiome profile ocular surface metagenomics sequence 16 rRNA 4 , 12 13 . Differences microbiome observed subject dry eye blepharitis , healthy subject . Moreover , much great diversity ocular flora discover compare result base bacterial culture . The school chemical environmental life science Nanyang Technological University evaluate microbiomes use technique . The basis prokaryotic organism unique DNA signatures typically characterise specie origin , relative prevalence organism different specie deduce relative abundance different DNA detect . The global human microbiome project seek understand microbiome different part human body . This best understood intestine , publication ocular surface yet emerge . Recently collaborator find 3 bacteria dominate ocular surface eye . These Klebsiella pneumoniae , Pseudoalteromonas agarivorans Lactobacillus rhamnosus . This dominance 3 type bacteria unexpected , since dominant view ocular surface commensal coagulase negative Staphylococcus dominates , follow Staphylococcus aureus Streptococcus , less gram negative bacteria , Propionibacter spp 11 . Among 3 specie , Klebsiella pneumonia know gram negative pathogen cause infectious keratitis , case endophthalmitis . The role Pseudoalteromonas Lactobacillus entirely unknown . The former non-pathogenic free living gram negative bacteria know present marine setting . Surprisingly high level 3 predominant bacteria relatively constant among 3 human participant , suggest certain amount uniformity colonisation ocular surface major bacteria microbes non-diseased individual . The ocular surface microbiome study sterile swap inferior fornix conjunctiva follow homogenisation extraction DNA . The presence bacteria DNA inform function microbe , since even dead non-proliferating organism remnant DNA . The technique collect sample also yield RNA , reverse transcription PCR , possible determine presence specific microbial transcript find ocular surface . Furthermore , collaborator Nanyang Polytechnic pioneer MALDI TOF mass spectrometry technique allow characterisation bacterial proteome , base identification unique bacterial peptide sequence . Together , technique bacteria transcript protein investigation permit evaluation gene expression extent , functional status bacteria discover . This would extremely important case microbes previously discover ocular surface . Apart obvious academic scientific advance , project also medical implication potential new Intellectual property commercial application . First , understand microbiome first step treat certain type diseases marginal keratitis unusual infectious keratitis . It suggest immune system manipulate treatment . Secondly , prevention disease inflammation may achieve probiotic administration live microbe colonise ocular surface . Third , study may lead new technique assay identify microbes component develop clinical diagnostic assay . We industry collaborator interested partner u develop idea . 1 . OBJECTIVES We aim conduct exploratory study : 1 . Determine composition bacterial microbiome human ocular surface normal volunteer dry eye patient 2 . Determine bacterial gene expression ( bacterial transcript ) find human ocular surface . 3 . Characterise feature microbiome may link clinical characteristic age , status tearfilm , Meibomian gland dysfunction , exposure environmental stimulation smoking , etc . 2 . EXPECTED RIKS AND BENEFITS Expected risk No potential problem expect study . However , slight discomfort collection microbiome low conjunctival fornix . Non-preservative tetracaine give patient minimise discomfort . There also slight discomfort Schimers I test . Potential benefit With great understand presence various microbiome ocular surface , gain insight complex process take place . 3 . STUDY POPULATION 3.1 . List number nature subject enrol . 90 subject recruit SNEC dry eye clinic general clinic service Principal Investigator . 45 subject without dry eye symptom recruit normal control 45 subject symptomatic dry eye recruit dry eye subject . 3.2 . Criteria Recruitment Recruitment Process 1 . To recruit normal controls- All 8 question dry eye symptom must clear dry eye symptom pre-screening stage . ( Appendix 1 ) Questionnaire modify Schein et al.,1997 . To recruit dry eye subjects- At least one 8 question dry eye symptom must ≥ grade 3 2 . Subjects meet inclusion criterion list . 3 . Clear exclusion criterion . Permission would seek attend doctor subject recruit . Eligible subject counsel study study coordinator . If subject interested , study coordinator accompany subject SERI level 5 relevant assessment . Informed write consent obtain participant . 3.3 . Inclusion Criteria Subject must meet inclusion criterion participate study . 1 . Subjects must 21 year old 2 . Willing perform eye examination study 3.4 . Exclusion Criteria All subject meet exclusion criterion baseline exclude participation . 1 . Known history thyroid disorder ( diagnosed physician ) . 2 . Known history Sjogren syndrome rheumatoid arthritis ( diagnosed physician ) . 3 . No ocular surgery within last 3 month LASIK within 1 year . 4 .

STUDY DESIGN AND PROCEDURES/METHODOLOGY Study design : Observational -Cross sectional study No . visit : There 1 visit study . Duration Study : 1 year Procedures : Collection Medical history Dry Eye Questionnaire There questionnaire consist medical history standard set dry eye questionnaire identify factor contact lens use , smoking , occupation etc . Non-Invasive Tear Break-Up Time ( OCULUS K5M ) Non-Invasive Tear Break-Up Time measure non-invasively fully automatically use OCULUS K5M . The new infrared illumination visible human eye . This prevent glare examination . Patient sit comfortably front instrument blink freely fix target directly ahead . Once participant ready , instructed blink twice refrain blink . Keratograph 5M fully automate capture break distortion image time break note . Three reading take eye get average value . Conjunctiva redness ( OCULUS K5M ) Conjunctiva redness assess use OCULUS K5M . Patient sit comfortably front instrument fix target directly ahead . Imaged captured overview display conjunctiva redness evaluate `` JENVIS Grading Scale '' . JENVIS scale range 0 4 . Redness value Definition 0 No finding , eg . Babies infants 1 . Single injection , standard value adult 2 . Mild diffuse injection 3 . Severe local injection 4 . Severe diffuse injection Collection microbiome Two specimen microbiome collect eye . First : drop non-preserved tetracaine instill conjunctival fornix . After sting sensation resolve , sterile cotton swap use collect microbe low conjunctival fornix use gentle roll action ( 8 stroke ) . The procedure repeat opposite eye . These swap soak DNA/RNA Shield ( Zymo ) reagent immediately homogenise 1 minute , stop 30 second , keep ice 1 minute , homogenize another 30 second . Homogenised sample store 4°C . This ensure optimal sufficient DNA/RNA yield purpose . Subsequent nucleic acid extraction , PCR , sequence , bioinformatics procedure perform collaborator . Storage : intend analyse within year , 5 year . Corneal fluorescein staining ( OCULUS K5M ) A drop normal saline instill fluorescein strip ( Fluorets ) shake visible drop remain . The subject ask look introduction fluoret inferior conjunctival fornix right leave eye . Corneal fluorescein stain imaged Keratograph 5M . Scoring system base CCLRU . Briefly , 5 corneal zone .
