	<brief_summary>TITLE : Randomized Controlled Evaluating Role Exercise Women Undergoing Treatment Breast Cancer Yoga Quality life : Yoga base practice physical posture , breathe technique meditation . Philosophically , aim increase body 's ability master mind goal spiritual awareness connection . A randomized trial yoga woman breast cancer undergo radiation therapy demonstrate improvement impact event scale 3 month suggest intrusive thought 1 month great find mean cancer 3 month . Randomized study demonstrate evidence yoga improve emotional well woman breast cancer improve distressed mood , thus provide buffer effect QOL . The main beneficial effect demonstrate social functioning . Among patient receive chemotherapy , yoga appear enhance emotional well-being mood may serve buff deterioration overall specific domain QOL . EVALUATION TOOLS- European Organisation Research Treatment Cancer-Quality Life Questionnaire ( EORTC QLQ-C30 &amp; BR-23 ) Brief Fatigue Inventory VAS ( Pain score ) Spirituality Questionnaire Pulmonary function test Objective assessment STUDY ENDPOINTS- Primary end points- Disease free survival Secondary end points- Quality life &amp; Improvements overall survival STUDY DESIGN TREATMENT PLAN - All newly diagnose case stage I-III breast cancer present Tata Memorial Hospital randomly assign perform either set 'Yogic Routine Exercises ( refer exercise I ) Routine Exercises ' ( refer exercise II ) ./ Patients begin exercise within week start treatment . Both arm study receive training session one hour per day first week , instructed practice daily maintain daily log . The evaluation tool use per assessment time line ( enclose ) .The exercise Exercise I arm ( Yoga conventional exercise ) upgrade within next 2 day Phase II . Patients allow attend minimum four seven day Phase I II . Patients assess 6 month compliance phase II exercise . Only patient fulfil criterion accuracy , sequence duration phase II exercise , taught phase III exercise . Patients unable phase II exercise 6 month taught phase II exercise . These patient assess 1 year gradation phase III . Six month completion phase III exercise , patient assess compliance phase III exercise . Patients also undergo objective assessment 1 year . An additional gradation completion adjuvant therapy 6 month . Patients follow period 5 year . DFS measure time randomization either progression death . Quality life measure baseline every six monthly use functional assessment cancer therapy- quality life . Quality Life analysis 400 patient performed appropriate correction multiple analysis apply . STATISTICAL ANALYSIS- For expect 50 % 5 year disease free survival ( DFS ) control group , expect 5 year DFS intervention group 60 % . With two-sided analysis , 80 % power 95 % confidence detect 10 % difference arm , sample size would 761 patient . Assuming 10 % loss follow , total 850 patient would accrue . We expect complete accrual 3 year . RANDOMIZATION AND STRATIFICATION- Randomization intervention do centrally Clinical Research Secretariat patient stratify Menopausal status : Pre + Peri Post Neoadjuvant adjuvant treatment Stage disease : I/II/III ANALYSIS- Disease Free Survival ( DFS ) calculate date randomization date local , regional distant relapse death cause censor last date follow patient alive disease free lose follow . Overall Survival ( OS ) calculate date randomization date death censor date last follow patient alive lose follow . DFS OS evaluate use Kaplan Meier compare Log-rank test . The Cox proportional hazard model use assess impact intervention correction stratification , menopausal status age .</brief_summary>
