	<brief_summary>AMD ( Age Related Macular Degeneration ) lead cause severe visual loss blindness registration UK . It disease affect retina ( nerve blood vessel network back eye responsible vision ) . Patients suffer severe visual loss difficulty every day task recognise face , read &amp; drive . There two variation disease , 'dry ' type &amp; 'wet ' type also know neovascular AMD ( nAMD ) . In wet/nAMD new vessel grow blood supply underneath retina , part due high normal level protein call Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor ( VEGF ) . Since introduction drug block VEGF , visual outcome patient wAMD dramatically improve . There 2 widely used treatment ; ranibizumab aflibercept . Whilst majority patient successful outcome treatment , many patient experience suboptimal response . This study evaluate patient experience benefit switch different antiVEGF drug treatment . In study nAMD patient show poor response treatment aflibercept switched ranibizumab ass benefit term treatment outcome . Patients visit hospital clinic 8 time 7 - 8 month study period . Monthly ranibizumab injection give first 3 month , monthly require next 3 month . 162 patient treat around 33 centre Europe , approximately 127 patient include UK</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Best correct visual acuity ( BCVA ) ≥23 ETDRS letter study eye Evidence active choroidal neovascularisation ( CNV ) involve center fovea study eye Patient subgroup specific inclusion criterion : Group 1 . Primary treatment failure Initiated treatment aflibercept &lt; 130 day prior Screening Visit . No increase BCVA ( ≥5 letter ) since commence treatment aflibercept . Disease activity never control study eye initiate aflibercept define least one following : evidence unchanged increase retinal subretinal fluid; new PED; unchanged increase size preexisting PED . Group 2 . Suboptimal treatment response Aflibercept commence ≥6 month prior Screening Visit . Received ≥3 aflibercept injection study eye within 6 month Screening Visit . Evidence previous reduce disease activity ( define reduction ≥50μm Central Subfield Retinal Thickness OCT ) note study eye initiate aflibercept . At Screening Visit , disease activity worsen ( defined increase retinal* subretinal fluid , new increase size PED ) study eye compare prior visit . History cerebrovascular accident , transient ischemic attack myocardial infarction within 3 month Screening visit . Uncontrolled blood pressure Evidence bilateral active CNV Screening Period Baseline require bilateral antiVEGF injection . Prior intravitreal injection ranibizumab bevacizumab study eye and/or prior intravitreal injection bevacizumab fellow eye . Cataract ( cause significant visual impairment ) , aphakia , severe vitreous hemorrhage , rhegmatogenous retinal detachment , proliferative retinopathy choroidal neovascularization cause wet AMD ( e.g . ocular histoplasmosis , pathologic myopia ( ≥8 dioptre ) ) time Screening Baseline . Irreversible structural damage involve center fovea ( e.g . advanced fibrosis geographic atrophy ) opinion Investigator sufficient irreversibly impair visual acuity . Polypoidal choroidal vasculopathy ( PCV ) , RPE tear , central serous retinopathy ( CSR ) , significant vitreomacular traction identify Screening period within 4 month Baseline visit . Unable obtain Screening OCT image sufficient quality analyze Other protocoldefined inclusion/exclusion criterion may apply .</criteria>
