	<detailed_description>Objectives To evaluate whether decrease wound complication among obese patient treat closed incision NPWT versus standard post cesarean section wound care protocol . Primary outcome variable ( ) The primary outcome variable wound complication define readmission wound issue within four week discharge , infection , wind breakdown . Secondary outcome look patient quality life among NPWT versus usual care arm . A survey address pain , breast feeding question ability perform activity daily live administer inpatient stay postpartum visit . Background Obesity , define body mass index ( BMI ) 30kg/m2 , continue grow epidemic United States . According National Center Health Statistics Data1 , almost one third adult 17 % youth obese 2009-2010 . Furthermore , non-Hispanic Blacks age-adjusted rate obesity ( 49.5 % ) . In study Chu et al analyze data 26 state Pregnancy Risk Assessment Monitoring System ( PRAMS ) database , 20 % woman deliver obese certain ethnic insurance subgroup , rate high 33 % . In 2008 , accord report Pennsylvania State statistic , rate obesity city Philadelphia high 64 % . Multiple study demonstrate increased risk diabetes , hypertension adverse pregnancy outcome ( APO ) pregnancy obese population . In addition , obesity well establish independent risk factor development wound complication infection cesarean delivery , rate range 10-15 % . Certain measure antibiotic prophylaxis closure subcutaneous space technique demonstrate decreased incidence wound disruption . Currently randomize control trial look effect surgical approach choice abdominal incision obese extremely obese woman undergo cesarean delivery . However , retrospective study address issue demonstrate mixed result . Given paucity randomize controlled trial evaluate prevention wound complication obese woman undergo cesarean delivery , recent review Tipton emphasize necessity trial evaluate method improve postoperative wound care heal high risk cohort . In past decade , negative pressure wound therapy ( NPWT ) become accepted treatment expedite heal open wound 15-18 . NPWT method vacuum device place wound order remove excess interstitial fluid , increase tissue vascularity , decrease bacterial colonization , place mechanical stress adjacent wound edge aid wound contractility closure . Therefore , positive effect NPWT open wound well study establish . Recent study perform assess potential effect NPWT close incision non-obstetric field . A recent study Grauhan et al compare effect NPWT close sternotomy incision obese patient compare conventional sterile wound dress note significant reduction rate wind infection treat NPWT . Another study Vargo assess effect NPWT close incision patient undergo abdominal therapy compare historical control also note decrease wound infection rate evidence skin necrosis . In contrast , recent study Masden et al . look rate infection dehiscence patient multiple comorbidities status post predominantly low extremity wound appreciate difference NPWT group dry dress group24 . Therefore , need study assess benefit NPWT various anatomical site clearly establish .</detailed_description>
