	<brief_title>An Enhanced Medical Home High-Risk Chronically Ill Children</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>INTRODUCTION Although patient-centered medical home widely recommend promote cost-effective healthcare1-6 , show systematic review improve clinical outcome reduce medical costs.3,4 Medical home great potential value high-risk patient , include chronically ill child whose care often fragment , costly , ineffective . However , justifiably stringent requirement practice guideline necessity control health care cost require compelling evidence cost-effectiveness undertaking require disseminate patient-centered medical home high-risk chronically ill child throughout U.S. For reason propose randomize trial ass whether enhanced medical home provide comprehensive care cost-effective prevent serious illness ( death , pediatric intensive care admission , hospital stay &gt; 7d ) among high-risk chronically ill child center . Our study obtain expedite approval Institutional Review Board ( IRB ) quality improvement ( QI ) study . METHODS After verbal inform parental consent obtain ( allow institutional review board minimal-risk QI trial increase access care ) , child randomize ( use seal , opaque , sequentially numbered envelope ) usual care comprehensive care stratification maternal education ( high school graduate ) predict risk hospitalization ( 50-74 % ; &gt; 75 % ) . Comprehensive Care involve care acute chronic problem ethnically diverse team pediatrician pediatric nurse practitioner ( PNPs ) highly train experienced treating complex , fragile child available hour phone 40 hours/week special high-risk child 's clinic . This clinic serf novel medical home primary specialty service provide clinic visit . The clinic also staff nutritionist social worker attend monthly dedicate subspecialist pediatric gastroenterology , neurology , allergy/immunology . A pediatric infectious disease specialist help develop measure reduce , promptly diagnose , effectively treat infection . These subspecialists available phone consultation hour . Acute problem present 5 pm see day ; occur weekend night see next weekday morning . At hour emergency department ( ED ) visit hospitalization need , staff discus child responsible MD schedule prompt follow-up visit . Multiple measure , e.g. , record staff review phone call ; daily check ED hospital log ; detail review care hospitalization ; parent survey ; active input Parent Advisory Board , use promote high quality care . Usual Care provide office private pediatrician general pediatrics clinic staff faculty-supervised resident . Chronic problem treat subspecialty clinic . After-hours call parent center take faculty-supervised pediatric resident faculty unlikely know child . Children refer emergency department automatic follow-up appointment . Statistical analysis stop rule : Intent-to-treat analysis perform use Poisson regression model robust standard error estimator ( account within family correlation estimate relative risk ) fit number child serious illness , intensive care unit admission , hospitalization &gt; 7 day , death . Negative binomial regression model investigate group difference total number outcome . Models adjust baseline risk , maternal education , length follow-up . A p &lt; 0.05 consider statistically significant . Bayesian analysis perform estimate probability reduce serious illness reduce cost ( assume neutral prior probability relative risk = 1.0 ; 95 % credible interval = 0.5-2.0 [ encompass large likely effect size major outcome observe randomized trial ] ) . We plan enroll 400 patient identify one-third reduction total patient develop serious illness ( alpha error = 0.05 ; power = 0.80 ; project serious illness rate usual care = 38 % ) . Under predefined stopping rule , enrollment would cease whenever Bayesian analysis perform annually end second year identify &gt; 95 % probability comprehensive care cost-effective . Economic evaluation : Hospital cost ( include cost observation stay ) estimate health system perspective multiplying hospital charge ( obtain hospital 's claim data Medicaid billing record ) department-specific cost-to-charge ratio specify hospital 's annual Medicare Cost Report . Outpatient cost usual care estimate use standard method base relative value unit . Outpatient cost comprehensive care estimate use total clinic expenditure include cost start-up , longer patient visit , extra ( unbillable ) service , low patient staff ratio address relative value unit . Costs inflated 2014 U.S. dollar base Consumer Price Index medical service . Cost difference treatment group assess use generalize linear model log-link gamma distribution , adjust maternal education , hospitalization risk , length follow-up , within-family correlation . The investigator consider program cost-effective reduces total child serious illness without increase total clinic hospital cost , reduce cost without increase total child serious illness , reduce .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Patients 18 year old young chronic illness , high healthcare utilization ( &gt; 3 emergency department visit , &gt; 2 hospitalization &gt; 1 pediatric intensive care unit admission prior year ) , &gt; 50 % likelihood hospitalization come year ( estimate patient 's diagnosis clinical course clinic 's medical director ) , live within onehour commute center . Patients complex problem give primary care specialist hour ( e.g . infant neonatal followup program child serious unrepaired congenital heart disease , mitochondrial disorder , organ transplant , treatment dialysis central line ; donotresuscitate order ) .</criteria>
