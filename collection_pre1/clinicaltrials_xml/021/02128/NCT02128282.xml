	<brief_summary>This study consider safety tolerability increase dos CX-4945 combination gemcitabine plus cisplatin determine maximum tolerate dose ( MTD ) , follow randomize study compare antitumor activity cholangiocarcinoma patient receive standard care gemcitabine plus cisplatin versus CX-4945 combination MTD gemcitabine plus cisplatin .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Study CX-4945 Combination With Gemcitabine Cisplatin Frontline Treatment Cholangiocarcinoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Protein kinase CK2 constitutively active serine/threonine kinase long history pro-survival , anti-apoptotic kinase . Given wide spread overexpression CK2 multiple cancer role multiple non-oncogenic process require sustain cancer phenotype , selective inhibitor CK2 attractive target approach treat cancer . CX-4945 tetracyclic , small molecule carboxylate acid salt exhibit potent highly selective inhibition CK2 . Protein kinase CK2 also know play important role DNA damage repair mechanisms cancer cell , study CX-4945 combination gemcitabine plus cisplatin determine inhibition CK2 , conjunction use chemotherapy drug , result improve clinical outcome patient non-resectable cholangiocarcinoma .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Presence unresectable liver mass consistent cholangiocarcinoma , treatment gemcitabine plus cisplatin intend . For patient enrol Dose Escalation Phase , one tumor measurable radiograph CT scan , evaluable disease define nonmeasurable lesion per RECIST v. 1.1 ( e.g. , malignant ascites ) . All patient enrol Randomized Study Phase must measurable disease . Laboratory data specify : Hematology : Absolute neutrophil count ( ANC ) &gt; 1,500 cells/mm3 , platelet count &gt; 100,000 cells/ mm.cu . hemoglobin &gt; 9 g/dL Hepatic : bilirubin &lt; 1.5 X Upper Limit Normal ( ULN ) ; alkaline phosphatase ( ALP ) , alanine aminotransferase ( ALT ) aspartate aminotransferase ( AST ) &lt; 5.0 X ULN Renal : serum creatinine within normal limit ( WNL ) , define within 25 % institution 's state reference range , calculate creatinine clearance &gt; 45 mL/min/1.73 m. sq . patient abnormal , increase , creatinine level . Coagulation : International Normalized Ratio ( INR ) &lt; 1.5 time normal , activate Partial Thromboplastin Time ( aPTT ) &lt; 1.5 time normal . Patients receive therapeutic dos anticoagulant therapy may consider eligible trial INR aPTT within acceptable therapeutic limit institution . Estimated life expectancy least 3 month . Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group ( ECOG ) Performance Status 0 1 . A history prior systemic treatment gemcitabine cisplatin . At least six month must elapse gemcitabine cisplatin administer adjuvant treatment set . Seizure disorder require anticonvulsant therapy . Known brain metastasis ( unless previously treat well controlled period least 3 month ) . Major surgery diagnostic surgery , within 4 week prior first dose test drug , minor surgery include diagnostic surgery within 2 week ( 14 day ) exclude central IV port placement needle aspirate/core biopsy . Radio frequency ablation transcatheter arterial chemoembolization within 6 week prior first dose test drug . Treatment radiation therapy surgery within one month prior study entry . Treatment chemotherapy investigational drug within 21 day prior screen visit . Acute toxicities prior therapy must resolve Grade â‰¤ 1 baseline . Patients history another malignancy within 3 year baseline visit . ( Patients cutaneous carcinoma insitu carcinoma consider study entry casebycase basis ) . Concurrent severe uncontrolled medical disease ( i.e. , systemic infection , diabetes , hypertension , coronary artery disease , congestive heart failure ) . Active symptomatic fungal , bacterial and/or viral infection include active HIV viral ( A , B C ) hepatitis . Difficulty swallow active malabsorption syndrome . Chronic diarrhea ( excess 23 stools/day normal frequency ) . Gastrointestinal disease include gastritis , ulcerative colitis , Crohn 's disease , hemorrhagic coloproctitis . History gastric small bowel surgery involve extent gastric small bowel resection . Clinically significant bleeding event within last 3 month , unrelated trauma , underlying condition would expect result bleed diathesis . Patients exhibit allergic reaction similar structural compound formulation component CX4945 . Concomitant use either warfarin and/or 3hydroxy3methylglutarylcoenzyme A ( HMGCoA ) reductase inhibitor ( statin ) .</criteria>
