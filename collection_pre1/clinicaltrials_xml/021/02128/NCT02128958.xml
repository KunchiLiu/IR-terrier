	<brief_summary>This multicenter , randomize , double-blind , placebo-controlled clinical trial subject advance HCC CPB cirrhosis whose disease progress take 1 prior systemic drug therapy HCC .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Phase 2 , Randomized , Double-Blind , Placebo-Controlled Efficacy Safety CF102 Hepatocellular Carcinoma ( HCC )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The trial evaluate efficacy safety CF102 compare placebo . Subjects randomly assign 2:1 ratio treatment oral dose either CF102 25 mg match placebo administer twice daily ( BID ) consecutive , 28-day cycle . Subjects evaluate regularly safety . Tumor image perform every 8 week . Treatment continue subject experience unacceptable drug-related intolerability . Subjects return follow-up visit 28 day completion last dose study drug , every attempt make obtain survival data randomize subject . Subjects discontinue follow indefinitely survival status . The trial continue 75 death record .</detailed_description>
