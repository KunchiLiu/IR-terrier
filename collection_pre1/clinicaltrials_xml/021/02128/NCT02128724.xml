	<brief_summary>This study test whether drug call BKM120 safe effective treatment give lung cancer patient radiotherapy treatment . The trial identify three possible dos BKM120 best give lung radiotherapy .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Palliative Thoracic Radiotherapy Plus BKM120</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This study single-centre , open-label , 3+3 cohort , dose escalation phase I study use BKM120 combination thoracic radiotherapy . Patients incurable NSCLC require palliative thoracic radiotherapy eligible entry . The first three cohort patient treat escalate dos BKM120 . These patient treat BKM120 total fourteen day . One week commence BKM120 , patient start palliative radiotherapy treatment . Radiotherapy treatment deliver 20Gy 5 fraction one week period . Maximum tolerate dose ( MTD ) determine 6 patient treat dose . Response BKM120 treatment base upon change tumour hypoxia perfusion detect 18F-Miso PET-CT scan perfusion CT scan respectively . In event change detect tumour hypoxia perfusion cohorts 1-3 , optional group patient ( cohort 4 ) recruit . These patient receive BKM120 treatment total 28 day . Three week commence BKM120 , cohort receive palliative radiotherapy 20Gy 5 fraction one week period .</detailed_description>

Patient concurrent severe , and/or uncontrolled medical condition would , investigator 's judgement contraindicate patient participation clinical study ( e.g . chronic pancreatitis , chronic active hepatitis ) . Patient impairment gastrointestinal ( GI ) function GI disease may significantly alter absorption BKM120 . Patients know serologically positive Hepatitis B , Hepatitis C HIV .
