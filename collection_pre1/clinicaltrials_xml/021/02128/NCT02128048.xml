	<brief_summary>Tobacco smoke probably single significant source toxic chemical human expose . Smoking associated variety pathological condition cardiovascular pulmonary disease . In addition know harmful effect cigarette smoking , several epidemiological study identify tobacco use risk factor sarcopenia , loss skeletal muscle mass strength advance age . Previous study examine skeletal muscle smoker comparison muscle non-smokers find structural metabolic damage muscle smoker . Quitting smoke know associated weight gain . A previous study examine effect smoke cessation body composition post-menopausal woman use dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry ( DEXA ) . It find woman successfully quit smoke period 16 month significantly increase body weight , fat mass , muscle mass functional muscle mass comparison non-quitters woman . For first time , show smoke cessation associate increase functional muscle mass . Yet , effect quit smoke muscle mass muscle functional capability young subject remain unclear . Therefore , aim investigate effect smoke cessation muscle mass , muscle function strength heavy smoker 's subject . Our finding may shed light beneficial effect smoke cessation regard status function skeletal muscle heavy smoker possible strategy prevent delay progression sarcopenia . Research hypothesis : Smoking cessation among adult heavy smoker lead increase skeletal muscle mass improvement muscle function strength compare continued smoker .</brief_summary>
