	<brief_summary>This research continuation Youth Readiness Intervention ( YRI ) randomize clinical trial add additional pre post intervention data collection upon treatment control group ( N=222 ) intervention proven effective large trial . The overall research investigate whether participation YRI intervention improve emotional regulation , prosocial attitudes/behavior , social support daily functioning among war-affected 15-24 year old Sierra Leone . In sub-study involve treatment control group effective YRI intervention , investigator add additional measure self-regulation observe via DNA methylation buccal cell collect via cheek swab . As , YRI intervention , youth offer free educational opportunity EducAid program Freetown one upline/provincial site . This stage research , treatment main group , test whether youth enrol YRI psychosocial intervention go demonstrate improve attendance behavior subsidized education program . In previous phase trial , investigator observe significant effect YRI intervention evidence program indeed effective . For instance , post-intervention , YRI youth report great improvement emotion regulation ( β=0.109 , 95 % CI 0.026 0.191 , δ=0.31 ) , prosocial attitudes/behaviors ( β=0.149 , 95 % CI 0.057 0.240 , δ=0.38 ) , social support ( β=0.119 , 95 % CI 0.009 0.229 , δ=0.26 ) control , great reduction functional impairment ( β= -0.175 , 95 % CI -0.299 -0.050 , δ= -0.35 ) . Differences symptoms non-significant six-month follow-up full sample ; moderator analyse show , individual top quartile baseline symptom , YRI youth great improvement emotion regulation social support control . At eight-month follow-up , teacher report YRI participant 8.9 time likely school ( 28.8 % v. 4.7 % ) show good attendance ( β=3.553 , 95 % CI 0.989 6.118 , OR=34.93 ) academic performance ( β= -0.954 , 95 % CI -1.807 -0.102 , δ= -1.31 ) . In final phase trial investigator treat wait list control group , investigator test whether intervention effect observe self-report data improve emotion-regulation also upheld biomarker data . Thus , investigator provide YRI treatment wait list control group employ use biomarkers measure intervention 's effectiveness . The objective study ass whether DNA methylation ( collect via cheek swabs buccal cell ) associate change emotion regulation pre- post- intervention . The aim test hypothesis YRI associate improvement emotion-regulation evidence self-report data emotion-regulation buccal cell DNA methylation . This study add evidence base effective , culturally sensitive mental health service youth young adult affect war form adversity .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>In Sierra Leone , dangerous gap remain long-term psychosocial need adequate service . As youth affect war begin enter adulthood , face new challenge include unemployment , interrupted education , need support family , marginalization stigma , well remain psychological effect exposure war . Healthy social integration critical long-term wellbeing generation , evidence base effective intervention improve skill self-efficacy severely limited . Despite high burden mental health problem among war-affected youth Sub-Saharan Africa , empirically-supported behavioral treatment ( ESBTs ) evidence-based intervention implement region . This study stand make important contribution knowledge effective culturally-sensitive mental health service implement setting fraught multiple hardship , include war , poverty , low educational attainment , hardship . The Research Program Children Global Adversity Harvard School Public Health implement Youth Readiness Intervention ( YRI ) address challenge youth face , include lack education employment , stigma marginalization , long-term psychological effect exposure war . The YRI evidence-based group intervention design improve emotion regulation/reduce anger foster prosocial functioning among 15-24 year old war-affected youth . It ground finding Betancourt et al .

The addition biomarkers research build rare randomize control trial conduct 2012-2014 , control group receive treatment randomize lag design YRI control participant treat YRI . Therefore , research data collection biomarkers three overarch aim : 1 ) To develop feasible acceptable method collect analyze genetic epigenetic biomarkers war-exposed youth Sierra Leone . This include forging collaboration expert colleague engage biomarker research , development ethical protocol data collection/storage , review literature genetic variation mechanism related psychopathology . 2 ) To obtain biosamples control study participant randomize control YRI trial ( 2012-2014 ) investigate possibility use research methodology component fourth wave data collection among war-affected youth family . 3 ) To investigate improvement epigenetic mark ( DNA methylation ) pre- post- Youth Readiness Intervention association finding participant ' self-reports emotion regulation prosocial functioning .
