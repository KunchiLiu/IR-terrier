	<brief_summary>People recently infect HCV great chance cure infection treat combination two drug within first 6 month infect . This study do see combination two new drug one pill replace old drug provide safe , effective , well tolerate treatment new HCV infection . The names new drug ledipasvir ( LDV ) sofosbuvir ( SOF ) , replace pegylated-interferon alfa ( PEG-IFN , drug give weekly injection skin ) . The fixed-dose combination LDV SOF ( LDV/SOF ) approve Food Drug Administration ( FDA ) . This study start participant Group 1 receive SOF combination RBV , drug also approve FDA , 12 week . There total 17 participant Group 1 complete treatment . All participant monitor safety viral response treatment . After complete treatment , participant evaluate treatment response end treatment . If treatment response Group 1 high enough , study design allow possibility decrease length therapy Group 2 8 week , use treatment . However , occur . Combined fact new effective treatment chronic HCV approve since study start , Group 2 receive 8 week LDV/SOF instead 12 8 week SOF RBV .</brief_summary>
