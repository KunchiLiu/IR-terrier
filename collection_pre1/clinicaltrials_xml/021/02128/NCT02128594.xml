	<detailed_description>Men sex men continue make majority incident HIV infection . Despite alarmingly high rate HIV infection , effective intervention prevent HIV transmission among men . This five year study , propose New/Early Stage Investigator , consist randomize controlled trial test behavioral intervention design reduce risk HIV/AIDS pose sexual partner selection strategy , specifically serosorting , among at-risk HIV negative men sex men Atlanta , GA. Serosorting - limiting unprotected sexual partner HIV status- emerge risk reduction strategy little input public health agency . It commonly practice among men sex men avoid HIV infection . However , engage serosorting predictor HIV transmission rather reliable form prevention . Serosorting ineffective due several factor , include : multiple flaw ability certain partner 's HIV statuses , failure routine HIV test detect acute HIV infection , elevate infectiousness due acute HIV infection , increase risk contract STIs facilitate HIV transmission . We therefore propose test brief , single-session , Conflict Theory Decision Making base intervention use public health setting . This project use novel theory inform decision make guide intervention design use routine service , i.e. , HIV post-test counseling . An intervention address need men test HIV negative fit well current effort scale HIV testing , also refer seek , test treat . The propose research build strength pilot test , behavioral intervention address serosorting among men sex men . Following screening , informed consent , baseline assessment , HIV test ( predict 70 men test HIV positive ) , 600 HIV-negative participant randomly assign receive one two intervention arm : ( ) serosorting , partner selection intervention , ( b ) time-match , CDC base , post-HIV test counseling , standard-of-care . Participants follow 12-months assessment include measure serosorting belief , decisional balance , knowledge acute HIV infection , HIV status disclosure , biological ( incident STI ) behavioral outcome ( sexual behavior ) . This study test hypotheses brief , single session , serosorting intervention result less risk-related serosorting belief , great knowledge/awareness HIV transmission risk taking , increase HIV status disclosure , reduction number sex partner , unprotected sex act , incident STIs among intervention participant control group participant . Moreover , test hypothesis intervention cost save test cost-effectiveness analysis . If show effective , intervention model ready immediate dissemination HIV testing service . In subset participant , test stigma affect linkage , engagement retention care participant test HIV/STI positive .</detailed_description>
