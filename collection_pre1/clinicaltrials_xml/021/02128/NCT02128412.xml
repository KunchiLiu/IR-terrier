	<brief_summary>Stent placement widely accept improve result angioplasty ( operation widen blood vessel ) decrease need surgery . Despite worldwide acceptance , stent usage still limit renarrowing occurs within stent ( restenosis ) patient within first six month . In addition still exist small risk heart attack soon stent place . The purpose study test safety tolerability try place stent use different strategy use low pressure oversized balloon inflation oppose usual high pressure balloon inflation . This may reduce injury artery reduce chance renarrowing stent . In order ensure safe effective way perform procedure investigator intend use Intravascular ultrasound ( IVUS ) catheter look inside artery stent . IVUS proven best way ensure optimal stent placement . Primary hypothesis : Stents equally well expand appose use strategy oversized stenting normal inflation pressure ( &lt; 10 atmosphere ) compare high pressure inflation ( ≥14 atmosphere ) guide intravascular ultrasound image . Secondary Hypothesis : There difference acute clinical endpoint ( death , myocardial infarction , urgent revascularisation stent thrombosis ) use strategy oversized stenting normal inflation pressure compare high pressure inflation . Tertiary Hypothesis : If show true investigator would hope expand study order reveal decrease stent restenosis use strategy low pressure balloon inflation . The investigator assess deployment characteristic drug elute versus bare metal stent</brief_summary>
