	<brief_title>RTA 408 Ophthalmic Suspension Prevention Corneal Endothelial Cell Loss Following Cataract Surgery - GUARD</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Many ocular disease characterize oxidative stress and/or inflammation . Oxidative stress also know adversely impact corneal endothelial cell , may factor result acute decrease corneal endothelial cell density follow ocular surgery . While corticosteroid provide potent anti-inflammatory efficacy wide range acute chronic inflammatory ocular disease , use limited side effect profile , include potential elevate IOP induce cataract formation . In addition , available ophthalmic anti-inflammatory treatment , include corticosteroid , directly protect underlie oxidative stress component disease process . Consequently , clinical need agent protect oxidative stress provide anti-inflammatory efficacy without induce steroid-like side effect . This study ass safety efficacy omaveloxolone ( RTA 408 ) Ophthalmic Suspension ( 0.5 % 1 % ) versus vehicle prevention corneal endothelial cell loss patient undergoing cataract surgery .</detailed_description>
