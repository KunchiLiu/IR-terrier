	<brief_summary>The purpose study assess safety effectiveness Ekso robotic exoskeleton person affect severe stroke . - Primary Objectives : - To determine structure high-dosage exoskeleton training program ( EXTP ) result clinically significant gain walk recovery individual affect severe stroke . - To determine whether time EXTP delivery ( i.e. , sub-acute vs. chronic ) severity ( non-ambulators vs. limited house-hold ambulators ) affect improvement gait speed overall function follow EXTP train protocol . - To determine whether maintenance improvement gait speed achieve intensive follow-up program either traditional rehabilitation program ( TRP ) extend EXTP . - Secondary Objectives : - To determine effect functional walking endurance assess 6 minute walk test 10 meter walk test , high-dosage exoskeleton training program ( EXTP ) vs. traditional rehabilitation program ( TRP ) carry outpatient set post stroke individual . - To determine effect functional balance , assess Berg Balance Scale , Functional Gait Assessment Five time sit stand measure assess 6 minute walk test , high-dosage exoskeleton training program ( EXTP ) vs. traditional rehabilitation program ( TRP ) carry outpatient set post stroke individual . - To determine effect stroke recovery , assessed step counter task specific train high-dosage exoskeleton training program ( EXTP ) vs. traditional rehabilitation program ( TRP ) carry outpatient setting</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>*Procedures During Screening Process : This study involve recruitment individual experience severe stroke well patient similar neurological weakness inpatient setting , outpatient clinic , well day rehabilitation sit The Rehabilitation Institute Chicago Northwestern Memorial Hospital . Members research team perform initial screen potential subject . These clinician determine study eligibility base inclusion exclusion criterion provide Ekso Bionics accordance medical recommendation Dr. Todd Kuiken . Potential subject ask question regard medical history current level function . If subject meet criterion , researcher provide subject consent form . The researcher discuss objective , study protocol , risk benefit study subject . The subject give time review form ask question study . Once subject provide informed consent , undergo screen process ass joint range motion , muscular strength ( via manual muscle test ) , spasticity present ( via Modified Ashworth Scale ) . These measure use determine subject qualification base inclusion exclusion criterion . Vital sign ( include heart rate , blood pressure oxygen saturation ) assess baseline , session , session need base subject 's sign symptom . Oxygen saturation heart rate monitor use pulse oximeter . Blood pressure assess manual blood pressure cuff stethoscope . *Procedures During Treatment : Sessions begin don Ekso device ensure proper fit . A physical therapist check subject proper alignment joint device check area increase pressure device body . If necessary , additional padding added ensure safety comfort device configuration modify . During initial session , skin check frequent pad customize , occur end session . After pre-session measure , participant attach suspension device ( Guldman overhead lift ) guard facility clinical/Ekso Bionics staff ensure participant safety . Each participant undergo measurement , size , don Ekso device addition skill training . Each participant instruct proper use Ekso device progress series weight shift , balance , walk skill set . Participants schedule initial screening session 26 follow-up training session assessments 9th , 18th , 26th session . A follow-up assessment also take place 3 month 26th training session . The amount session provide dependent upon compatibility device , ability tolerate device use , ability safely ambulate use device . A participant continue phase study deem appropriate research staff : - Phase 1 ( 1-9 training session ) : Each subject instruct regard optimal postural alignment weight shift strategy walk efficiently device . The subject complete balance weight shift task improve stand balance initiation step device . Each subject participate 90 minute gait training session emphasis multi-directional weigh shifting , balance , initial walk tasks device . - Phase 2 ( 10-18 training session ) : Each subject continue gait training Ekso device utilize training protocol develop achieve progression walk maximum-assist , tether walking towards great level independence include non-tethered walking device . An assessment gait speed , among functional measure , take place 18th session . Each subject 's gait speed determine type train receive session 19-26 . - Phase 3 ( 19-26 training session ) : Subjects walk speed &lt; .4m/sec continue Ekso device gait train 4 week rate 2 session per week . Subjects walk speed &gt; .4m/sec continue traditional physical therapy treatment 4 week rate 2 session per week . Both type train session focus improve overall balance , walk distance , walk speed , &amp; confidence ground walking .</detailed_description>
