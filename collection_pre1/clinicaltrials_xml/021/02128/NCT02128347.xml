	<brief_summary>Home dialysis many potential benefit compare in-center hemodialysis include improve quality life , reduce hospital admission reduce cost . However , patient perceive home modality associate increased isolation healthcare system , substandard care high risk catastrophic event . Providing good support home dialysis patient may enhance ability maintain home , improve health outcome , increase quality life improve satisfaction care . In chronic disease population secure , online communication portal physician patient proven useful enhance care patient . Thus far , utility online portal communication system test cohort home dialysis patient . The investigator hypothesize novel form communication improve care outcomes home dialysis patient . Therefore , cohort home dialysis patient , purpose study follow : 1 ) Does online patient-portal improve patient satisfaction home dialysis care ? 2 ) Does online patient-portal improve quality life ? 3 ) Does online patient-portal reduce hospitalization health service utilization ?</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Home dialysis ( include peritoneal dialysis home hemodialysis ) number potential benefit in-center hemodialysis ( include low healthcare cost improve quality life patient ) . However , overall quality life remain low compare general population . Furthermore , home dialysis patient ( primarily peritoneal dialysis ) continue experience high rate hospitalization . Finally , improvement patient satisfaction home dialysis , particularly area share decision make handle patient request . Regarding satisfaction care , peritoneal dialysis patient identify `` attentiveness concern '' , clarity recommendation important . Improved satisfaction turn , may associate improvement quality life . Therefore , identify novel communication system home dialysis patient crucial . The use eHealth online portal support online communication patient healthcare worker increase . An interface allow patient discuss treatment plan address clinical problem obviate need telephone communication show beneficial study . Such system may improve patient satisfaction , reduce health service utilization , potentially improve health outcome . Thus far , feasibility potential benefit eHealth online portal facilitate communication evaluate home dialysis . Therefore , cohort home dialysis patient , purpose study identify follow : 1 ) Does online portal improve patient satisfaction home dialysis care ? 2 ) Does online portal improve quality life ? 3 ) Does online portal reduce hospitalization health service utilization ? Overall , hope study inform need pursue large , multicenter trial rigorously evaluate utility novel form communication home dialysis patient . We conduct prospective pilot study prevalent ( receive home dialysis least three month ) home dialysis patient ( include peritoneal dialysis home hemodialysis ) Capital Health . Consecutive patient evaluate home dialysis clinic 4-month period enrol study provide consent .</detailed_description>
