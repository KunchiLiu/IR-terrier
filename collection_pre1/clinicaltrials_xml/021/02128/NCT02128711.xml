	<brief_summary>There plenty evidence suggest lung uniform . The internal surface area 30 time skin , different bronchioles/bronchi/alveoli differ greatly blood perfusion , temperature , oxygen tension , pH . Also , particularly context respiratory disease , notable difference present structure epithelial cell , cilium , production mucus , inflammatory/immune response . All factor know impact physiology bacteria , yet , little understanding impact ) presence/absence particular bacterial specie throughout respiratory tract , b ) metabolic process use bacteria within human host environment . A great understanding relationship environmental ( chemical ) gradients lung diseased patient ( particularly cystic fibrosis ) microbial community present may lead novel hypothesis manipulation respiratory environment therapeutic benefit . To investigate , investigator propose use explanted lung specimens cystic fibrosis patient test follow hypothesis : Hypothesis : In patient cystic fibrosis , bacterial community composition , metabolism environmental chemistry vary depend spatial location within airway .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>To study great detail , investigator propose study explanted tissue CF patient schedule undergo single double lung transplant surgery late-stage disease therapeutic strategy . This population limit Adult CF clinic , pediatric subject rarely candidate lung transplantation . The Adult CF Clinic performs upwards 20 surgery per year , tissue explanted typically discard . Using tissue , investigator propose follow objective : 1 . Use 16S culture-independent sequence characterize spatial distribution bacterial pathogen throughout lung cystic fibrosis patient . Lungs dissect 5 separate lobe , mucus material collect , homogenize , process bacterial specie identification . 2 . Perform detailed analysis specific gene expression throughout respiratory tract serve proxy environmental condition find . Using approach Aim 1 , bacterial mRNA extract use establish procedure . A subset environmentally-specific gene detect provide readout bacterial metabolism use within CF lung environment . 3 . Use situ hybridization image visualize spatial distribution specific bacteria gene expression profile ( inform data generate objective 1 2 ) . The bacteria gene candidate identified/studied Aims 1 Aims 2 subject analysis use situ hybridization imaging . Tissue process use microtomy fluorescent probe apply image spatial distribution specific bacterial specie metabolisms throughout respiratory tract . Information collect three objective pair patient data ( age , genotype , prior medical treatment , clinical microbiology data ) generate well work model late-stage disease CF patient .</detailed_description>
