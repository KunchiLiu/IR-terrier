	<brief_summary>The miRNA play important regulation role gene expression , also closely related bone metabolism . Previous research find postmenopausal osteoporosis kidney Yin deficiency syndrome ( POP ) associate CLCF1 gene . This project propose bioinformatics prediction CLCF1 target regulation miRNAs , use 3 'UTR dual luciferase report system target validation , aim miRNA level explore postmenopausal osteoporosis molecular mechanism kidney Yin deficiency syndrome .</brief_summary>
