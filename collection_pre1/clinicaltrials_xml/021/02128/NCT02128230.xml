	<brief_title>UARK 2012-02 Trial For High-Risk Myeloma Evaluating Accelerating Sustaining Complete Remission</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Total therapy 5B attempt accelerate sustain , 2 year start therapy , proportion subject complete remission reduce host-imposed toxicity facilitate timely completion highly synergistic 8-drug combination therapy , include next generation proteasome inhibitor , Carfilzomib . This result avoid multiple myeloma re-growth , postulate , ensue Total therapy 3 recovery phase severe de-conditioning . It speculate incidence positive minimal residual disease reduce addition one cycle consolidation therapy . The following approach implement : - apply 4-day fractionate low dose melphalan ( 80 mg/m2 ) together CFZ-TD-PACE regimen MEL80-CFZ-TD ( carfilzomib , thalidomide , dexamethasone ) PACE hopefully less toxic effective transplant regimen - intersperse 1 cycle non-transplant support MEL-20-CFZ-TD ( carfilzomib , thalidomide , dexamethasone ) PACE ( low dos transplant ) inter-therapy ( reduce two cycle due prolong thrombocytopenia ) - follow CFZ-TD ( carfilzomib , thalidomide , dexamethasone ) PACE consolidation therapy post transplant # 2 - CFZ-RD ( carfilzomib , lenalidomide dexamethasone ) maintenance 1 year follow CFZ-D additional year</detailed_description>
