	<brief_summary>Spinal cord stimulation ( SCS ) use almost 30 year treat many intractable back pain condition . It demonstrate efficacy co-called Failed Back Surgery Syndrome ( FBSS ) recent randomize control trial demonstrate significant superiority SCS conventional medical therapy treat patient FBSS . Another trial demonstrate superiority SCS repeat surgery patient population . However , ability reliably capture low back paresthesia coverage remain challenge elusive despite numerous strategy design overcome limitation . Strategies introduce far limited success include transverse multiple lead stimulation , high frequency stimulation , peripheral field stimulation , dorsal root ganglion ( DRG ) stimulation . To date , none strategy able reliably overcome long-term problem paresthesia capture pain relief low back . This proposal describe new spinal stimulation technique design improve likelihood low back stimulation target nerve supply two commonly affect pain produce structure back , facet joint intervertebral disk . The technique proven feasible cadaver model ease lead placement desire target</brief_summary>
