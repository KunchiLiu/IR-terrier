	<brief_title>Physical Activity Protein Supplementation After Bariatric Surgery ( PAPAB )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Bariatric surgery become major treatment option severe obesity adult . Despite advantage bariatric surgery , attention need pay possible risk follow surgical treatment . Postoperative risk include protein deficiency pronounce muscle mass loss . Indeed , numerous study indicate significant reduction lean body mass result protein deficiency bariatric surgery . Dietary proteins show play important role body weight regulation . A protein-rich diet attains satiety thereby facilitate reduction overall energy intake . It also show enhance food-induced thermogenesis . Furthermore , protein-rich diet - ideally combination exercise - preserve lean body mass thus rest energy expenditure lead improvement long-term energy balance . Therefore , protein-rich diet protein supplement , respectively , might facilitate weight loss , especially body fat loss protect loss muscle mass patient underwent bariatric surgery . The aim present randomize , placebo-controlled , double blind pilot study test possible benefit protein combination exercise patient undergo bariatric surgery , examine , whether computer-assisted exercise advantageous compare usual exercise program use write exercise instruction . Therefore , study influence postoperative protein supplementation combination computer-assisted exercise body composition change , body weight reduction , well physical fitness , protein status muscle function obese patient bariatric surgery .</detailed_description>
