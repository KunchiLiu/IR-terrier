	<brief_summary>The goal propose research develop pilot test novel Internet intervention reduce risk Alcohol-exposed pregnancy ( AEP ) . Efficacious intervention reduce risk AEP develop , widely available . In project , develop novel Internet intervention reduce AEP risk combine resource two research team focus primary prevention Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorders ( FASD ) robust Internet intervention , respectively . We use evidence-based AEP risk reduction intervention material exist Internet intervention development platform build pilot test Internet intervention ( Contraception Alcohol Risk Reduction Internet Intervention , CARRIII ) stage 1 behavioral integrative therapy development project . This three year R34 project develop program new Internet intervention , determine feasibility preliminary efficacy intervention pilot RCT . In protocol , assess feasibility preliminary efficacy CARRIII Patient Education Website condition pilot randomize clinical trial ( RCT ) assessments pre- , post- , 6 months.The primary hypothesis woman randomize CARRIII condition change 3 marker AEP-related outcome ( risky drinking , ineffective contraception , AEP risk ) woman assign Patient Education website condition . We prepare future cost effectiveness evaluation large RCT follow pilot test propose measure . The pilot RCT yield effect size estimate subsequent fully power trial . If Internet intervention promising , test fully power national trial . The Internet intervention could substantially increase option AEP prevention , could lead reduction incident FASD .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>As first study fully interactive Internet intervention reduce AEP risk , propose project significant extension grow literature Internet intervention reduce problem drinking , establish feasibility acceptability , evidence efficacy especially university drink set . Most brief online intervention problem drinking incorporate self-assessment tailored normative feedback , offer cognitive behavioral exercise . Only one web-based intervention date target AEP risk . In study , static Internet presentation AEP risk reduction intervention material compare intervention deliver mail quasi-experimental design . The web deliver mailed version self-guided change intervention significantly reduce AEP risk . The propose intervention build study well exist alcohol Internet intervention finding extend focus new population new goal ( AEP prevention ) target drinking AND ineffective contraception . It also incorporate significant enhancement compare static web-based self-guided change intervention AEP add dynamic , interactive , feedback element mirror interaction successful face-to-face intervention .</detailed_description>
