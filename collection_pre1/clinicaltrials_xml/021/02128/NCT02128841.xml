	<brief_summary>Objectives Primary objective : To determine rivaroxaban ( Xarelto ) feasible safe prevention major complication patient undergo mechanical aortic heart valve replace-ment . Secondary objective : To identify value molecular marker suitable monitor anticoagulation effectiveness rivaroxaban correlation transcranial Doppler embolus count patient undergoing mechanical aortic heart valve replacement . Design This prospective , open-label phase 2 pilot study independent evaluation outcomes historical control group . Number patient 30 experimental group ( patient center 's registry database serve control group ) . Main eligibility criterion All patient 18 70 year old receive mechanical aortic valve replacement pre-operative leave ventricular ejection fraction &gt; /=35 % . Interventions Experimental : Rivaroxaban 20mg p.o. , daily , six month Historical control : Phenprocoumon ( Marcoumar ) p.o. , daily Outcomes Primary outcome : Composite outcome prosthetic thrombus require reoperation/intervention , major bleeding , visceral ischemia , stroke , pulmonary embolism , myocardial infarction death cause 180 day intervention . Secondary outcome : Each component composite outcome plus serious adverse event . Prosthetic thrombus require reoperation/intervention plus non-clinically relevant thrombus use additional safety outcome . Molecular marker suitable monitoring effectiveness rivaroxaban .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Background Although overall incidence complication associate prosthetic cardiac valve implantation decrease considerably since introduction 3 decade ago , valvular thrombosis systemic thromboembolism remain major concern cardiothoracic surgeon , cardiologist , practice clinician well-known potential cause devastate event include ischemic stroke death . Factors contribute thrombogenicity prosthetic heart valve include : altered blood flow haemostatic activation cause vessel-wall disruption surgery exposure artificial surface circulate blood . Short-term parenteral anticoagulation unfractionated heparin low-molecular-weight heparin often use therapeutic concentration oral vitamin K antagonist reach . Vitamin K antagonist , alone combination aspirin , use long-term management patient . However , Vitamin K antagonists cumbersome use , multiple interaction food drug , require frequent laboratory monitoring . Therefore , often use , , rate discontinuation high . Many patient receive Phenprocoumon still inadequate anticoagulation . Thus , need new anticoagulant agent . Patients self-monitor therapy vitamin K antagonists home rather laboratory often therapeutic range lower incidence complication hospital admission . Meta-analyses randomized trial recently find patient self-monitoring associate 33 % reduction risk death , 55 % reduction risk thromboembolism , slight decrease major haemorrhage . Self-monitoring also associate improved quality life satisfaction . However , number INR value within target range self-monitored patient still poor , 70 % ! , even take account wide range INR 2.5-4.5 . Another main obstacle widespread use patient self-monitoring cost . In UK National Health Service , estimate cost patient self-monitoring £122 000 per quality-adjusted life year ( QALY ) 5 year £63 000 10 year . This cost-effective consider commonly accept threshold £30 000 per QALY . Costs related portable INR-monitoring device , test strip , patient education program . The oral direct thrombin inhibitor - dabigatran etexilate - two oral direct factor Xa inhibitor - rivaroxaban apixaban - advanced stage clinical development expect replace oral vitamin K antagonists many indication . There publish phase 2 , dose-validation study investigate use dabigatran patient mechanical heart valve ( RE-ALIGN trial ) . This trial terminate prematurely excess thromboembolic bleed event among dabigatran-treated patient . Does RE-ALIGN trial preclude investigation rivaroxaban direct oral factor Xa inhibitor patient mechanical heart valve ? Not necessarily ! Coagulation develop least two subsequent wave thrombin generation fibrin deposition , factor Xa playing pivotal role amplification . In fact , since activation 1 molecule factor X result generation 1000 molecule thrombin , molar basis factor Xa thrombogenic thrombin several line research show require less heparin inhibit thrombosis prior thrombin formation afterwards . Therefore , sound rationale hypothesize direct factor Xa inhibitor may efficient dabigatran prevent thromboembolic event among patient mechanical heart valve . Objective Primary Objective : CATHAR pilot study determine rivaroxaban feasible safe prevention major complication patient undergo mechanical aortic heart valve replacement . Secondary objective identify value molecular marker suitable monitor anticoagulation effectiveness rivaroxaban correlation transcranial Doppler embolus count patient undergoing mechanical aortic heart valve replacement . Methods CATHAR prospective , open-label , pilot , phase 2 study independent evaluation outcome . The trial base Bayesian design incorporate historical information control group analyse . All patient receive aortic valve replacement bileaflet mechanical valve . Rivaroxaban ( Xarelto , Bayer ) administer patient prevention complication . The dose rivaroxaban 20mg daily . Continuous bood monitoring perform hospitalisation follow . Before hospital discharge 1 , 3 6 month follow patient receive echocardiography . Trans-cranial Doppler perform 10 random patient . End study : Rivaroxaban patient switch Phenprocoumon 6 month follow .</detailed_description>
