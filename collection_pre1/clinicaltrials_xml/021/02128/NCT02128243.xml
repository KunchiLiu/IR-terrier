	<brief_title>Trial S-1 Maintenance Therapy Metastatic Esophagogastric Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Open-label , multi-center , control , randomize , parallel-group phase II trial patient metastatic esophagogastric cancer receive induction chemotherapy . Patients registered initiation first-line chemotherapy regimen . This 12-week induction therapy consist one follow regimen : FLO/mod . FOLFOX-6 , Cisplatin/S-1 , FLOT EOX/EOF ( see intervention specification regimen ) . Regarding dose adjustment , Investigators refer Section 6.3 summary product characteristic chemotherapeutical agent . Patients finish preplanned induction therapy without tumor progression ( i.e . complete remission ( CR ) , partial remission ( PR ) stable disease ( SD ) accord Response Evaluation Criteria Solid Tumors ( RECIST ) Criteria Version 1.1 ) week 12 , able swallow capsule Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group ( ECOG ) performance score 0-1 randomized 2:1 ratio receive Arm A B . In Arm A patient continue S-1 de-escalation phase start week 13 disease progression , toxicity require discontinuation , withdrawal consent , pregnancy , death lose follow whichever occur first . In patient drug-related severe toxicity S-1 dose adjust study treatment terminate . In Arm B patient continue receive polychemotherapy induction therapy tumor progression , toxicity require discontinuation , withdrawal consent , pregnancy , death loss follow whichever occurs first .</detailed_description>
