	<brief_summary>The purpose study evaluate exposure three active cytotoxic agent ( FOLFOXIRI regimen ) superior term progression-free survival conventional chemotherapy FOLFOX regimen first-line treatment chemo-naive metastatic colorectal cancer patient . A second primary aim evaluate response rate , safety tolerability chemotherapy FOLFOXIRI regimen patient population . Patients randomize two therapy group : Experimental arm A : Chemotherapy FOLFOXIRI Standard arm B : Chemotherapy FOLFOX</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Survival patient metastatic colorectal cancer correlate proportion patient receive three active drug , proportion patient receive second-line therapy . A superior efficacy PFS , ORR OS FOLFOXIRI report acceptable toxicity . Moreover , evidence suggest continuous dose metronomic chemotherapy may efficacious interval-chemotherapy . Therefore , way improve outcome metastatic colorectal cancer patient could administer maintenance first-line regimen contain three active agent .</detailed_description>
