	<brief_summary>This project continue innovative line research optimally use sleep intervention promote cognitive recovery , resistance , neurobehavioral risk pose chronic partial sleep deprivation . Chronic insufficient sleep estimate affect least 20 % adult . It result medical condition sleep disorder , well work demand , social domestic responsibility . It associate significant clinical morbidity , directly cause error accident due adverse neurobehavioral effect alertness , mood , cognitive function . In seminal experiment conduct grant , show neurobehavioral effect chronic sleep restriction accumulate severe level day , without full awareness affect individual , recovery chronic sleep restriction require sleep previously assume . We also discover recovery chronic sleep illusory , mask heighten neurobehavioral vulnerability even single post-recovery night sleep restriction . The implication find apparent recovery chronic sleep restriction mask severe cognitive response subsequent sleep restriction suggest long time constant brain neurobehavioral recovery chronic sleep restriction . In light finding , seek determine whether additional night extend recovery sleep reduce heighten vulnerability induce prior exposure sleep restriction . A total 87 healthy adult ( age 21-50 ) study laboratory 17-night ( N=63 ) 19-night ( N=24 ) protocol evaluate cognitive , psychological physiological response vary recovery day two sleep-restriction period . The result establish number night recovery sleep need prevent accelerate deterioration subsequent period sleep restriction . The finding advance theoretical understanding sleep homeostasis relationship cognitive function , well inform theory sleep need , substantial implication sleep biology , treatment clinical disorder regularly disrupt sleep , manage lifestyle factor frequently restrict sleep .</brief_summary>

	<criteria>A total N=87 adult subject ( aged 2150 yr ) , N=43 females N=44 male ethnicity , randomize 3 different condition ( n=26 2 experimental condition ; n=11 control condition ) 17night protocol assign 5night experimental recovery condition ( n=24 ) 19night protocol . Subjects must also comparable term homeostatic circadian sleepwake regulation parameter . In order eligible participate , subject must meet follow inclusion criterion : 1 . Age 21 50 year ( average age current protocols 31 year ) 2 . Body mass index ( BMI ) within 20.5 % normal 3 . Stable , normallytimed sleepwake cycle determine interview , 2week daily sleep log , 2week wrist actigraphic evidence , define : 4 . Habitual nocturnal sleep duration 6.5h 8.5h 5 . Habitual morning awaken 0600h 0930h 1 . No evidence habitual nap 2 . No shift work , transmeridian travel irregular sleep/wake routine past 60 day 3 . No sleep disorder , determine history , actigraph , pulse oximetry PSG 4 . No history mania psychosis 5 . No current depression determine Beck Depression Inventory 6 . No alcohol drug abuse past year base upon history urine toxicology screen 7 . Not current smoker 8 . No acute , chronic , debilitate medical condition , major Axis I psychiatric illness , epilepsy , thyroid disease , base history , physical exam , blood urine chemistry , CBC</criteria>
