	<detailed_description>The study prospective , non-randomized , single center , trial ass effect FOLIRINOX chemotherapy SBRT locally advance , non-resectable pancreatic cancer . Patients either undergo biopsy confirm diagnosis strong clinical suspicion new cancer recurrence base recommendation multi-disciplinary GI oncology team . FOLFIRINOX deliver prior SBRT 4 cycle . Restaging image occur prior SBRT delivery . SBRT deliver use standard stereotactic technique dose 3200cGy 650cGy per fraction deliver 2 week . Additional adjuvant chemotherapy deliver physician 's discretion . Patients reassess clinically radiographically 3 month , 6 month , 9 month 12 month post-treatment . Quality life analysis occur 3 month interval treatment . Blood drawn exploratory biomarker analysis strategic timepoints treatment followup .
