	<brief_summary>The purpose study : 1 . To investigate whether 3-month exercise training program would improve cognitive function , motor performance , integrity brain fiber tracts cerebral blood flow ; 2 . To investigate possible neuro-anatomical neurophysiological mechanism exercise train cognitive function , motor performance , integrity brain fiber tract cerebral blood flow patient mild cognitive impairment early Alzheimer 's disease ; 3 . To investigate influence different apolipoprotein E ( APOE ) genotypes above-mentioned exercise effect . The result study provide medical evidence effect exercise train mild cognitive impairment early Alzheimer 's disease ; provide understand mechanism mediate effect . More importantly , result serve basis future larger-scale exercise clinical trial two patient population .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Effects Exercise Training Patients With Mild Cognitive Impairment Early Alzheimer 's Disease</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Recent study show exercise training could decrease risk dementia elderly population . Exercise training could also slow speed deterioration memory cognitive function patient already mild cognitive impairment early Alzheimer 's disease . However , mechanism effect still unknown . Whether exercise training could improve neural fiber integrity , blood flow , motor performance patient also remain unexplored . Therefore , purpose study : 1 . To investigate whether 3-month exercise training program would improve cognitive function , motor performance , integrity brain fiber tracts cerebral blood flow ; 2 . To investigate possible neuro-anatomical neurophysiological mechanism exercise train cognitive function , motor performance , integrity brain fiber tract cerebral blood flow patient mild cognitive impairment early Alzheimer 's disease ; 3 . To investigate influence different APOE genotype above-mentioned exercise effect . We conduct single-blinded , randomize control clinical trial . We recruit 60 patient mild cognitive impairment early Alzheimer 's disease . The participant randomly classify exercise training group control group . The exercise training group receive health education exercise training moderate intensity , 3 time week , 12 week . The control group receive health education . Both group receive pre- ( week 0 ) , post- ( week 12 ) , follow-up ( week 24 end program ) examination cognitive function , motor performance , diffusion tensor diffusion spectrum magnetic resonance imaging , transcranial duplex . We compare group difference aforementioned outcome measure bring 12-week exercise training . We also perform analysis correlation change outcome measure explore possible neural physiological mechanism mediate training effect . The effect different APOE genotypes outcome measure also compare . The result study provide medical evidence effect exercise train mild cognitive impairment early Alzheimer 's disease ; provide understand mechanism mediate effect . More importantly , result serve basis future larger-scale exercise clinical trial two patient population .</detailed_description>
