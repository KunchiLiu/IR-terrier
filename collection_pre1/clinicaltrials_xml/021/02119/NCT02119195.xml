	<detailed_description>Inclusion Criteria Allocated group : Patients localize marginal deficiency ( Bravo Ryge Criterial ) composite restoration clinically judge suitable seal accord USPHS criterion . Patients 20 teeth . Restorations functional occlusion oppose natural tooth . Asymptomatic restore tooth . At least one proximal contact area neighbour tooth . Patients older 18 year . Patients agree signed consent form participate study . Area restoration´s failure good condition . Inclusion Criteria Positive Control group : Composite resins alpha value adaptation marginal criterial Exclusion criterion : Patients contra-indications regular dental treatment base medical history . Patients xerostomia take medication significantly decrease salivary flow . Patients high risk caries . Patients psychiatric physical disease , interfere oral hygiene . Patients localize marginal deficiency &gt; 1 mm . and/or secondary caries adjacent composite restoration , major defect 2.2 Treatment Group Criteria Initially , 356 restoration ( 28 patient ) evaluate assigned accordance modify USPHS criterion , 80 select accordance inclusion criterion . Restorations marginal defect ( &gt; 0.5mm &lt; 1mm ) and/or marginal staining ( Bravo ) randomly assign Sealing ( n = 20 ) treatment ( n = 20 ) group . The randomization perform Power Analysis Sample Size System ( Excel 2000 , Microsoft , SEA , USA ) . 2.3 Restoration Assessment The quality restoration score accord modify USPHS criterion . Two examiner underwent calibration exercise year ( JM EF ) . The Cohen 's Kappa inter-examiner coefficient 0.74 baseline 0.87 ten year . Immediately treatment ( baseline ) 10 year later , examiner assess restoration independently direct visual tactile examination mouth mirror number 5 explorer number 23 ( Hu Friedy Mfg . Co. Inc. , Chicago , IL , USA ) indirectly radiographic examination ( bite wing ) . The four parameter examine anatomic form , secondary caries , marginal stain marginal adaptation . If difference record two examiner , could reach agreement , third clinician , also underwent calibration exercise ( GM ) , make final decision . 2.4 Treatment Groups 2.4.1 Sealing For group , defective area acid etch 35 % phosphoric acid 15 second . A resin-based sealant ( Clinpro Sealant , 3M ESPE ) apply defective area . The sealant polymerized photocuring unit ( Curing Light 2500 , 3M ESPE ) 40 second . Rubber dam isolation use procedure . 2.4.2 No treatment The composite resin restoration marginal defect , clinically acceptable , receive treatment . 2.4.3 Positive control Composite resins alpha value marginal adaptation criterion</detailed_description>
