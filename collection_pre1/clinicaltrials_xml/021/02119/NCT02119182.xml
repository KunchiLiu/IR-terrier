	<detailed_description>Effective treatment traumatic brain injury ( TBI ) remain one great unmet need public health . After 3 decade fail clinical trial , new approach need . Our proposal , Transforming Research Clinical Knowledge Traumatic Brain Injury ( TRACK-TBI ) , establish public-private partnership experience TBI investigator , philanthropic industry collaborator , share mission accelerate TBI research . TRACK-TBI create large , high quality database integrate clinical , image , proteomic , genomic , outcome biomarkers establish precise method TBI diagnosis prognosis , refine outcome assessment , compare effectiveness cost TBI care . We hypothesize approach permit investigator well characterize stratify patient , allow meaningful comparison treatment outcomes , improve next generation clinical trial . We build TRACK-TBI Pilot study ( NCT01565551 ) team 's precompetitive collaboration , forge participation TBI Common Data Elements project ( TBI-CDE ) International TBI Research Initiative ( InTBIR ) . Having provide index dataset Federal Interagency TBI Research database ( FITBIR ) , propose follow Specific Aims : Specific Aim 1 . To create widely accessible , comprehensive TBI Information Commons integrate clinical , image , proteomic , genomic , outcome biomarkers subject across age injury spectrum , provide analytic tool resource support TBI research . Multi- disciplinary team across 11 site enroll 3000 subject age across injury spectrum concussion coma . Utilizing TBI-CDEs , along uniform standard acquire multi-site MRI data , expand TRACK-TBI Pilot informatics platform , leverage exist informatics tool populate FITBIR , yield resource current future TBI research international collaboration . Specific Aim 2 . To validate imaging , proteomic , genetic biomarkers improve classification TBI , permit appropriate selection stratification patient clinical trial , contribute development new taxonomy TBI . We hypothesize validated imaging , proteomic , genetic biomarkers permit improve patient classification , beyond traditional category mild , moderate severe TBI . Subaim 2.1 . To establish prognostic image biomarkers TBI base patho-anatomic analysis CT MRI , well quantitative MR volumetrics , diffusion tensor imaging ( DTI ) , rest state functional MRI ( R-fMRI ) . Subaim 2.2 . To identify blood-based biomarkers provide additional diagnostic prognostic information identify TBI phenotype target specific therapy . Subaim 2.3 . To identify common polymorphisms candidate gene associate outcome TBI , elucidate causal molecular mechanisms injury , response , repair . Subaim 2.4 . To construct multidimensional TBI classification system incorporate data multiple domain define homogeneous class patient suitable clinical trial inclusion . Specific Aim 3 . To evaluate flexible outcome assessment battery comprise broad range TBI common data element enable assessment multiple outcome domain across phase recovery level TBI severity . When compare current gold standard , Glasgow Outcome Scale Extended ( GOSE ) , hypothesize flexible discriminate outcome battery reflect multiple functional domain precisely efficiently capture outcome across course recovery , level TBI severity . Subaim 3.1 . To improve granularity breadth TBI outcomes use flexible outcome assessment battery enable basic neurocognitive assessment subject impair undergo standard neuropsychological testing , comprehensive assessment cognition , functional status , mental health , social participation , quality life cognitively intact enough provide valid result . Subaim 3.2 . To determine efficiency flexible outcome assessment battery , compare GOSE , reduce sample size need detect difference group . Subaim 3.3 . To identify specific TBI phenotypes amenable targeted intervention , relate patient classification factor ( Subaim 2.4 ) different outcome factor score ( Subaim 3.1 ) . Specific Aim 4 . To determine test , treatment , service effective appropriate TBI patient , use evidence recommend practice offer best value . We use establish comparative effectiveness research ( CER ) health economics method evaluate ability clinical practice improve outcome contain cost . Subaim 4.1 . To identify patient currently admit ICU could safely effectively cared floor bed discharge home outpatient management , estimate health economic impact change management patient . Subaim 4.2 . To determine whether routine follow improves TBI outcomes minimizes economic burden . Subaim 4.3 . To assess variability management patient take antiplatelet agent time TBI , effect management progression intracranial hemorrhage , need craniotomy , outcome . We expect achievement Specific Aims advance understand TBI , improve clinical trial design , lead effective patient-specific treatment , improve outcome TBI .</detailed_description>
