	<detailed_description>Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease ( COPD ) significant cause morbidity mortality Europe major consumer resource primary secondary healthcare ( 1,2 ) . Both clinical feature disease severity quality COPD patient care may substantial influence disease outcomes . Traditionally , COPD categorize use FEV1 ( forced expiratory volume one second ) - base GOLD ( The Global Initiative Chronic Obstructive Lung Disease ) classification . Other factor independently associate survival include age , dyspnoea , health status , hyperinflation , gas exchange abnormality , exacerbation frequency , exercise capacity , pulmonary hemodynamic , nutritional status ( 3 ) . Together factor explain existent heterogeneity within GOLD stage term symptom , exacerbation , quality life exercise capacity ( 4 ) . Recently , interest emerge identification clinical COPD phenotype , define `` single combination disease attribute describe difference individual COPD relate clinically meaningful outcome '' ( 5 ) . Many previous study attempt identify quantify prevalence different phenotype COPD use population various source , severity , particularity . Yet consensus number definition different phenotype . However , must compromise oversimplification term COPD definition encompass entire spectrum patient incompletely reversible airflow obstruction cause largely smoke complexity consider patient individually orphan disease . The frequently report phenotype emphysema chronic bronchitis , along subset asthma sufferer . Recently , extend list propose phenotype propose ( 6 ) include : ( A ) infrequent exacerbators either chronic bronchitis emphysema ; ( B ) overlap COPD-asthma ; ( C ) frequent exacerbators emphysema predominant ; ( D ) frequent exacerbators chronic bronchitis predominant . While consensus substantial , complete , overlap among phenotype , distribution phenotype may differ widely different country healthcare system . Thus , objective study good understand patient characteristic treatment pattern diagnose COPD different CEE country . Knowledge information may provide insight variability phenotype different healthcare system may subsequently contribute good understanding factor associate patient outcomes potential improve care COPD patient .</detailed_description>
