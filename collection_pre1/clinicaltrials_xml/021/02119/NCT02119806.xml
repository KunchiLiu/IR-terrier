	<brief_summary>In critically ill surgical patient , delirium ( confusion disorientation ) extremely common associate longer hospital length stay , mortality , cost , long term cognitive impairment . The goal study establish whether benzodiazepine ( sedative , anti-anxiety drug ) use part standard care eliminate compare chance delirium cardiac surgery patient two group : group receive benzodiazepine surgery versus group receive benzodiazepine surgery . Benzodiazepines historically use cardiac anesthesia decrease risk anesthesia awareness . The current standard care keep patient inhale anesthesia throughout surgery eliminates need intraoperative use benzodiazepine . Benzodiazepines still use base practitioner preference . Findings study allow anesthesiologist make informed decision level care patient need .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>In critically ill surgical patient , delirium extremely common associate longer hospital length stay , mortality , cost , long term cognitive impairment . Benzodiazepine usage common anesthetic practice , ICU literature demonstrate limit post-operative benzodiazepine decrease incidence delirium . However , avoidance preoperative intraoperative benzodiazepine cardiac surgery study term effect delirium . The goal study establish whether benzodiazepine use part standard care eliminate compare incidence delirium cardiac surgical patient randomize group receive benzodiazepine versus group receive benzodiazepine . Potential subject identify recruited day surgery primary investigator . Patients undergo coronary artery bypass graft single valve procedure consent participate enrol study . These patient may consent pre-operative period . Patients inform whether enroll study , receive standard clinical care . Only subject meeting inclusion criterion requirement continuation study consent . Patient randomize age ( age predictor delirium ) 3 group : - &gt; 80 year age ; - 70-80 year age ; - &lt; 70 year age . Within 3 group , patient randomize receive benzodiazepine cardiac surgery . The anesthesiologist operate room blind group ; however , intensive care physician evaluate delirium blind treatment group . Benzodiazepine group : 1 . Premedication 0.02mg/kg-0.1mg/kg midazolam ; 2 . Maintenance 0.8 minimum alveolar concentration inhale anesthetic ( MAC ) 10-30mcg/kg fentanyl ; 3 . Postoperative 10-100mcg/kg/min propofol Non-benzodiazepine group : 1 . Premedication 0-50mg propofol and/or 0-250mcg fentanyl ; 2 . Maintenance 0.8 minimum alveolar concentration inhale anesthetic ( MAC ) 10-30mcg/kg fentanyl ; 3 . Postoperative 10-100mcg/kg/min propofol Delirium reliably diagnose non-psychiatrists critically ill patient le 2 minute use validate monitoring instrument Confusion Assessment Method ICU ( CAM-ICU ) .</detailed_description>
