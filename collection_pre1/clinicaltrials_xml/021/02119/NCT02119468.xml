	<brief_summary>This phase I/II trial study side effect best dose ixazomib see well work give together pomalidomide dexamethasone treat patient relapsed relapsed/refractory multiple myeloma . Ixazomib may stop growth cancer interfere proteasomes ( protein breakdown mechanism cell ) . Pomalidomide dexamethasone modify regulate immune system may stop cancer cell grow . Giving ixazomib pomalidomide dexamethasone may effective treatment relapse relapsed/refractory multiple myeloma .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Ixazomib Plus Pomalidomide Dexamethasone Treating Patients With Relapsed Relapsed/Refractory Multiple Myeloma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To determine recommended phase II dose ( RP2D ) MLN9708 ( ixazomib ) , give combination pomalidomide dexamethasone , patient relapse relapsed/refractory multiple myeloma . ( Phase I ) II . To estimate response rate evaluate antitumor activity three drug combination : MLN9708 ( RP2D ) , pomalidomide dexamethasone , patient relapse relapsed/refractory multiple myeloma . ( Phase II ) SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . To evaluate safety MLN9708 dose level give part three drug combination assess follow : type , frequency , severity , attribution , time course duration adverse event ; clinical laboratory test various point study . ( Phase I ) II . To characterize evaluate toxicity , include type , frequency , severity , attribution , time course duration , RP2D , three drug combination . ( Phase II ) III . To obtain estimate response duration , depth response , clinical benefit response , survival ( overall progression-free ) , RP2D , three drug combination . ( Phase II ) OUTLINE : This phase I , dose-escalation study ixazomib follow phase II study . Patients receive ixazomib orally ( PO ) day 1 , 8 , 15 ; dexamethasone PO day 1 , 8 , 15 , 22 ; pomalidomide PO day 1-21 . Courses repeat every 28 day absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . After completion study treatment , patient follow every 3 month 2 year .</detailed_description>
