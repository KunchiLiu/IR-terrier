	<brief_summary>The Liquid Biopsy System ( LBS ) new catheter ( thin tube ) design sample blood directly coronary artery . These artery supply blood muscle heart become blocked 'plaques ' lead chest pain ( angina ) heart attack . Recent research show development ' plaque ' inside coronary artery control chemical ( biomarkers ) release blood damage area artery wall . The LBS design collect blood sample exact site plaque formation . By test blood sample biomarkers plaque formation , hop new diagnostic test treatment heart disease may develop . The propose investigation use LBS human detect biomarkers . The safety LBS already demonstrate human animal study . The study enroll 70 patient coronary artery disease undergo routine percutaneous coronary intervention ( PCI ) . PCI procedure use open block coronary artery . It use catheter end special balloon inflate inside block artery open vessel restore blood flow . A small metal spring ( stent ) usually insert keep blood vessel open . This study test LBS device , use prior PCI procedure , detect biomarkers release diseased coronary artery . The study also determine presence biomarkers link long term health patient . The study take place Papworth Hospital , period approximately 8 month ( include telephone base patient followup call 30 day , 6 month , 1 , 2 3 year procedure determine patient health ) .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Study Detect Biomarker Gradients Coronary Arteries Using Liquid Biopsy System</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The purpose Clinical Investigation use PlaqueTec Liquid Biopsy System ( LBS ) determine biomarkers detect locally within coronary artery give information state atherosclerotic disease . The LBS novel CE-marked class III coronary catheter design sample blood directly coronary artery . The LBS unique capture `` gradient '' biological molecule within coronary artery analyse sample collect unequivocally identify biomarkers locally release within coronary artery . The sample analyse variety biomarkers use standard analytical technique . Cardiologists find great benefit recent study show coronary artery disease control direct release specific biological molecule blood diseased area coronary artery . The safety performance LBS prove previously recent First In Man study . The Clinical Investigation study enroll 70 patient observational nature . The study design use device intend application ( i.e . adjunct PCI procedure , deployment stent ) collect biomarker gradient release locally within coronary artery . It follow health status patient see release certain biomarkers associate particular clinical outcome . The device use look locally release biomarkers two different stage deployment stent , i.e . deployment . The first stage prior deployment stent LBS collect blood sample look release `` natural '' biomarkers gradient , i.e . biomarkers naturally release progression development diseased region within artery . The second stage use LBS collect blood sample across diseased artery perturbed ( `` pre-ballooning '' , procedure carry prior stent insertion ) look `` induced '' biomarker gradient , i.e . molecule release diseased plaque rupture . The insight gain collect biomarker gradient two stage give important information cause region artery become diseased diseased portion artery affect blood cause heart attack . The sample collect LBS clinical setting analyse series biomarker gradients previously select PlaqueTec ' Scientific Advisory Panel ( SAP ) potential role cause atherosclerosis . The data collect LBS research use affect patient treatment . In summary , LBS study deliver completely new insight coronary artery disease significantly increase understand hugely significant disease . Patients need elective percutaneous transluminal interventional coronary procedure consider study . Patients require emergency interventional procedure exclude . The study duration estimate 8 month three year follow period .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>1 . Subjects candidate percutaneous transluminal interventional coronary procedure 2 . Subjects undergo elective PCI 3 . Subjects present PCI NSTEMI 4 . Subjects preloaded dual antiplatelet therapy ( aspirin clopidogrel ( prasugrel ticagrelor ) ) per usual local PCI practice . 5 . Subjects willing able sign inform consent . 1 . Subjects LBS contraindicate : 1 . The LBS contraindicate use severely stenosed , excessively tortuous calcify coronary vessel . 2 . The LBS contraindicate coronary vessel reference diameter less 2.5 mm . 3 . The LBS contraindicate use region coronary vessel contain stent . 4 . The LBS contraindicate use carotid artery , cerebral vessel side branch . 5 .
