	<detailed_description>Timely treatment effectively reduce burden stroke begin optimal prehospital stroke care . The slogan 'Time brain ' 'Competence brain ' adequately point acute stroke time-critical medical emergency require specialize treatment . Pursuant ongoing technological development line American Stroke Association European Stroke Organisation guideline , implementation telestroke optimize inhospital stroke care currently apply several country . Research prehospital telestroke system recommend American Stroke Association , may facilitate early stroke diagnosis , assessment stroke severity selection patient specific stroke treatment . The experience prehospital telemedicine assessment stroke severity , however , limited TeleBAT project two recent pilot study conduct healthy volunteer . Prehospital telestroke promising concept , facilitate specialize stroke care early stage base integration bidirectional audiovisual communication point care laboratory analysis , vitals decision support software . As part Prehospital Stroke Study Universitair ziekenhuis Brussel ( PreSSUB ) , develop test several prototype prehospital telemedicine . The current system consist commercially available hardware Web-based telemedicine platform . The data transmit multimedia server unit mobile ( ultra ) broadband connection ( 3G 4G ) . Data privacy secure password-protected logins , role-based access control , hypertext transfer protocol secure encryption . The result feasibility study use 4G network healthy volunteer recently report feasibility data use 3G network healthy volunteer available . Building reassure safety feasibility data specify , next logical step evaluate system prehospital telemedicine real-life situation involve transportation patient Paramedic Ambulance team ( PIT ) -ambulance UZ Brussel .</detailed_description>
