There number advantage reduce duration treatment , include reduce potential risk caries , root resorption minimize patient `` burn '' prolong treatment . While evidence exist vibration may accelerate speed tooth movement , biological mechanism still unknown . Identification specific factor involve tooth movement stimulate vibration would help understand mechanism involve well discover possible biologic target could utilize modify maximize benefit vibration treatment . The purpose study identify novel biological factor express patient undergo orthodontic tooth movement conjunction vibration appliance therapy .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Biomarkers Orthodontic Tooth Movement With Fixed Appliances Vibration Appliance Therapy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Specific Aims 1 . To determine combine vibration-fixed appliance treatment alters expression specific bone remodel factor saliva compare fixed orthodontic treatment alone . 2 . To elucidate role vibration treatment degree tooth mobility fix appliance treatment compare control . 3 . To determine combine vibration-fixed appliance treatment increase speed orthodontic tooth movement alignment phase treatment . 4 . To evaluate role vibration treatment control pain patient undergoing orthodontic treatment . Screening &amp; Recruitment Procedures Approximately 600 patient begin treatment every year University Connecticut Orthodontic Clinic . The pilot project aim recruit total 40 patient , 20 male 20 female subject , equally divide control vibration group . Based projected start , anticipate meeting recruitment goal first 12 month study . Prospective subject screen study complete usual initial screening procedure patient University Connecticut Orthodontic Clinic appoint primary orthodontic provider . The primary orthodontic provider determine patient likely qualify ( pre-screen ) study base inclusion/exclusion criterion . The initial clinical indicator eligibility evaluate pre-screen healthy patient undergo non-extraction treatment good oral hygiene . Male female subject ethnicity include age 15-35 year age . If prospective patient meet initial criterion , orthodontic provider notify study coordinator PI screen patient 's exist dental record , include screen form , model and/or radiographs confirmation likely eligibility participation study . Study Procedures I. Standardized Orthodontic Treatment Protocol The orthodontic clinic treatment protocol standardize minimize variability sequence treatment . All subject bond 0.022 '' X0.028 '' bracket passive self-ligating bracket maximal band tension ( MBT ) prescription 2nd premolar 2nd premolar arch bond tubes 1st molar baseline ( T0 ) visit . Each subject 0.014 '' copper nickel titanium ( NiTi ) archwire place initial visit . At T2 , next archwire sequence ( 0.014 '' X0.025 '' copper NiTi ) place . Subjects see normally appoint visit every 4-6 week . The primary orthodontic provider direct alignment level phase treatment proceed wire sequence indicate . No specific procedure/timeframe assign placement archwire . Providers expect proceed next archwire place comfortably base degree alignment achieve . In event bracket breakage , subject see within 7 day bracket rebonded , standard care well study . The primary orthodontic provider reposition bracket ideal position continue alignment use study archwires . If subject present 7 day breakage , he/she disqualify study . II . Randomization Procedures Once recruit study baseline measure take T0 study coordinator , randomization perform . Since study group subdivide gender , separate randomization perform male female . Block randomization use . Based gender , 20 opaque envelope generate contain group allocation ( 10 vibration study group , 10 non-vibration control group ) . At time randomization , subject choose envelope disclose group assignment . For subject allocate vibration group , study coordinator provide detailed instruction operate appliance instruct subject use 20 minute per day . III . Data Collection Procedures On day bonding ( T0 ) , prior placement appliance , baseline unstimulated whole saliva collect Periotest perform select teeth mandibular arch . In addition , alginate model impression take . These procedure describe detail next section . Once baseline measure take , PI perform randomization notify study coordinator group subject assign ( `` vibration treatment '' `` vibration '' ) . The patient allocate vibration treatment group provide AcceleDent appliance instruct use 20 minute per day accord manufacturer 's instruction . After fixed appliance place tooth movement begin , subject proceed standard orthodontic treatment without vibration treatment base allocation . Collection saliva sample , Periotest alginate impression take T1 ( 5-6 week post-T0 ) , T2 ( 10-12 week post-T0 ) T3 ( 15-17 week post-T0 ) . Subjects see noon 5pm help minimize possible confound salivary marker circadian rhythm . Salivary Biomarkers Collection unstimulated whole saliva perform use method describe Navazesh Kumar . Unstimulated whole saliva collect passive drooling sterile centrifuge tube ice 15 minute 2-10mL saliva collect baseline visit , whichever occur first . Once saliva collect , sample keep ice supplement proteinase inhibitor . Samples centrifuge 10 minute 3000 rpm remove cellular debris supernatant collect store -80°C ready analyze biomarkers . Biomarkers evaluate ELISA assay direct sandwich method use standard protocol . Periotest Measurement Procedures This measurement obtain baseline visit . The degree tooth mobility use use Periotest device ( Siemens AG , Bensheim , Germany ) central incisor , canine 2nd premolar mandibular quadrant previously describe Liou et al . The archwire remove Periotest measurement take triplicate , mean record . Dental Model Analysis Two blind clinical evaluator assess rate alignment low incisor group . Analyses dental cast do mandibular cast use method base Little 's irregularity index . Little 's irregularity index develop assess amount anterior tooth displacement canine canine . Contact displacement measure millimeter around arch canine canine . Irregularity measure model four time point evaluate base percentage change 6-month evaluation period . Orthodontic Pain Assessment Subjects give pain diary baseline ( T0 ) , visit T1 &amp; T2 record level orthodontic pain even first 7 day study visit . The degree pain assess use Visual Analog Scale ( VAS ) range 1 ( least pain ) 10 ( high pain ) . In addition , patient report pain constant present biting/chewing . The subject return complete diary next visit collect study coordinator keep study record . Oral Health Quality Life ( OHQoL ) To assess impact vibration appliance overall oral health quality life subject , subject give Oral Health Impact Profile ( OHIP-14 ) questionnaire . The OHIP-14 consist 14 question divide specific dimension include functional limitation , physical pain , psychological discomfort , physical disability , psychological social disability overall life handicap orthodontic treatment without vibration appliance . The OHIP-14 administer study visit profile change compare across time point data analysis . Individual score multiply weight give subscale score category . IV . Sample size justification Few study exist evaluate salivary biomarkers orthodontic tooth movement . Our primary outcome change expression specific biomarkers cellular activation bone remodel . No RCTs currently available predict treatment effect biomarker expression . This study serve pilot project 40 patient total 4 group divide gender vibration/no-vibration treatment arm . We estimate 600 patient target age range begin orthodontic treatment University Connecticut Orthodontic Clinic year . We anticipate meet recruitment goal study . V. Subject Participation The timing visit activity plan coincide normally schedule clinic provider/patient visit . Typically , treatment non-extraction case last 12-30 month Orthodontic clinic use fix appliance . However , subject evaluate first 6 month clinical appliance treatment study purpose data . Providers follow patient every 5-6 week study coordinator ensure/confirm patient study appointment . After completion observation data collection phase ( 17 week ) , patient continue proceed treatment direct primary orthodontic provider . Data collection occur normally schedule visit additional appointment specific study . In event PI determines subject suit continue study ( eg . subject show consistent failure keep appoint visit , consistent breakage appliance , patient safety consideration , etc . ) he/she withdrawn PI study data collect . Specifically , poor compliance attend appointment allotted time frame study visit result subject disqualify study . For example , follow-up time frame T1 5-6 week T0 ( baseline ) . Therefore patient miss appointment reschedule attend his/her appoint allot time ( 6 week T0 ) , he/she disqualify study . Also , event bracket breakage ( state earlier ) , subject see within 7 day bracket rebound . The primary orthodontic provider reposition bracket ideal position continue alignment use study archwires . If subject present 7 day breakage , he/she disqualify study . The data collect point utilized analysis . The patient 's treatment continue primary orthodontic provider consistent standard care . VI . Statistical/Data Analysis Intra inter-rater reliability irregularity measurement assess use T0 T3 model evaluate two blind evaluator one week apart patient . A Cronbach alpha analysis use assess reliability measurement . A single calibrate evaluator ( study coordinator ) collect tooth mobility measurements Periotest mean evaluate use non-parametric statistical analysis . A Wilcoxon Rank Sum test independent sample use assess difference group continuous variable α=0.05 irregularity index changes-Periotest measurement , VAS &amp; OHIP-14 measure . Salivary biomarker expression analyze ANOVA ass difference four study group time point . The study coordinator principal investigator perform statistical analysis .</detailed_description>
