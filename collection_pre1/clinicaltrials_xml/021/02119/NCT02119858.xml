	<brief_summary>This clinical trial study diffuse optical imaging indocyanine green solution image pelvic lymph node patient stage II prostate cancer undergo surgery . Indocyanine green solution special dye help doctor see lymph node blood vessel surgery visualize diffuse optical imaging . Indocyanine green solution may improve ability detect lymph node may lead improved accuracy lymph node removal .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Diffuse Optical Imaging With Indocyanine Green Solution Imaging Pelvic Lymph Nodes Patients With Stage II Prostate Cancer Undergoing Surgery</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To determine ability indocyanine green ( indocyanine green solution ) ( ICG ) highlight pelvic lymphatic tissue fluorescence robot assist radical prostatectomy use near infrared fluorescence ( diffuse optical imaging ) . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . To evaluate ability technique improve lymph node yield , provide potential therapeutic benefit patient remove additional lymph node may otherwise miss . OUTLINE : Patients receive indocyanine green transperineally undergo diffuse optical image robot-assisted laparoscopic radical prostatectomy bilateral lymph node dissection use da Vinci Robotic Surgical System . After completion study treatment , patient follow 1-2 week .</detailed_description>
