	<brief_summary>Mild brain injury concussion affect four million Americans year . Some people recover completely others , especially multiple concussion , develop chronic headache , neurodegenerative disease psychiatric disorder . One reason concussion difficult treat difficult detect . Radiographic study CT ( compute tomography scan ) definition unrevealing structural injury concuss patient . Some MRI ( magnetic resonance imaging ) sequence may useful adjunct diagnosis concussion even consistently present patient symptom . Clinical test concussion often require baseline study , thus generally reserve athletes others high risk concussion . The investigator develop novel eye movement track algorithm perform subject watch television music video determine whether eye move together ( conjugate ) subtly together ( disconjugate ) . The investigator preliminary data show people lesion brain recover brain injury disconjugate gaze detectable ophthalmologic examination detect algorithm .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The purpose study test validity eye track algorithm detect structural ( visible CT scan ) non-structural ( concussive ) brain injury . The study recruit brain injured subject non-brain injured control Bellevue Hospital Emergency Department neurosurgery service eye-tracking well study assess extent brain injury . The investigator determine disconjugate gaze eye track significantly associate abnormal functional , neuro-cognitive , psychiatric outcome . The investigator hypothesize individual demonstrate sustain disconjugate gaze eye track task time injury 1 month elevate functional impairment multiple domains life ( work , interpersonal relationship ) , poor performer neuro-cognitive task ( work memory , executive functioning , verbal memory , impulsivity ) , significantly symptomatic posttraumatic stress disorder ( PTSD ) depression demonstrate conjugate eye track normal range one month . Achievement investigator aim provide first evidence eye track valid physiologic outcome measure brain injury .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>All patient recruit Bellevue Hospital Emergency Services ( Emergency Department Trauma Bay ) among inpatient population Bellevue Hospital . They need consentable able/willing participate meet criterion distribution one three subject population ( structural TBI , nonstructural TBI , injured/nonTBI ) describe : mild moderate structural traumatic brain injury ( TBI ) evidence CT scan demonstrate presence hemorrhage ( subdural , epidural , subarachnoid intraparenchymal ) , brain contusion , skull fracture . nonstructural TBI ( concussion ) , mean sign structural injury imaging ; however , complain usual brain injury symptom headache , dizziness , cognitive impairment , etc. , A subject traumatically induced physiological disruption brain function , manifest &gt; 1 follow : Any period loss consciousness ( LOC ) . Any loss memory event immediately accident . Any alteration mental state time accident ( i.e . feel daze , disorient , confuse ) . Focal neurological deficit ( ) may may transient , severity injury exceed follow : 1 . Loss consciousness approximately 30 minute less 2 . After 30 minute , initial Glasgow Coma Scale ( GCS ) 1315 3 . Posttraumatic amnesia ( PTA ) great 24 hour . Nonbrain injured subject suffer type injury extremity part body . The subject sustain blunt penetrating trauma , corpus extremity ( i.e . car accident , fall ) . Subjects receive minor penetrating trauma insufficiently traumatize result sufficient sequela exclude . Subjects suffer burn , anoxic injury multiple/extensive injury result medical , surgical hemodynamic instability also exclude . Particularly purpose eye track subject blind ( light perception ) , miss eye , open eye exclude research . It pertinent subject able detect light eye order eye track data effective significant . Any physical mental injury baseline disability render task completion difficult exclude , also inability participate longtitudinal care , obvious intoxication blood alcohol level great 0.2 . Pregnant individual prisoner also exclude study .</criteria>
