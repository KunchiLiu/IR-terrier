	<brief_summary>A grow body data , suggest transcatheter valve effective implanted location ( mitral , aortic , tricuspid ) high pressure environment . The investigator plan offer transcatheter valve implantation alternative high risk surgery patient require revision stenotic regurgitant valve non-pulmonary position ( mitral , aortic , tricuspid ) . This therapy provide alternative patient may consider high risk may able survive surgical procedure.The use device protocol medical treatment part clinical trial .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Transcatheter Valve Implantation Patients With Dysfunctional Left Right Sided Heart Valves</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Many form congenital structural heart disease require surgical placement prosthetic valve conduit . These condition include many common congenital heart abnormality Tetralogy Fallot , Double Outlet Right Ventricle , Truncus Arteriosus patient require Ross procedure aortic stenosis . There variety acquire condition , include calcific aortic valve stenosis may require surgical transcatheter valve treatment . Unfortunately , valved conduit place surgically , ultimately become narrowed regurgitant require periodic replacement . Thus , patient condition often undergo multiple open heart surgery lifetime . Although risk mortality kind surgery low , surgical intervention associate significantly longer recovery time patient discomfort compare transcatheter intervention . Over last decade , technique develop palliate form congenital structural heart disease use catheter insert blood vessel groin . These transcatheter technique allow patient delay avoid open heart surgery . The Medtronic Melody Trancatheter Valve Edwards SAPIEN Transcatheter Heart Valve bioprosthetic valve mount within metal stent . Their entire structure collapsible , allow inserted delivery sheath thread heart , typically without need surgical cardiopulmonary bypass . Some procedure may perform use hybrid technique minimal surgical access transcatheter valve delivery . The valve expand place inflate balloon ( similar stent place elsewhere heart , like coronary artery ) . The Melody Valve receive humanitarian device exemption ( HDE ) FDA Edwards Sapien Valve market approval FDA.The investigator plan offer transcatheter valve alternative eligible patient require replacement stenotic regurgitant valve leave right sided position . The intended role Melody Transcatheter Pulmonary Valve restore pulmonary valve function patient dysfunctional RVOT conduit clinical indication pulmonary valve replacement . Unlike currently available option pulmonary valve replacement , TPV intend place transcatheter delivery system , thus require surgical incision , open heart surgery , cardiopulmonary bypass , various morbidity associate surgical pulmonary valve replacement . The Edwards Sapien Valve deliver manner , intend use aortic position . The ultimate goal durability TPV may differ among patient different indication . At minimum , intention TPV improve hemodynamic function , mitigate adverse impact valve regurgitation and/or obstruction , effectively extend longevity exist conduit defer obviate need conduit replacement . These technique may decrease number open heart surgery require course patient 's lifetime , thereby decrease cumulative morbidity risk associate operation . With regard valve replacement position adequate land zone , Melody Valve Edwards Sapien Valve presently utilized multiple United States center valve replacement position patient consider high risk candidate surgical valve replacement . A recent article publish Zahn et al report experience tricuspid valve implantation three United States center one Austrailian center . Procedural success achieve patient . Tricuspid regurgitation reduce mild none patient . Noted complication consistent know risk cardiac catheterization Melody Valve implantation , regardless indication . Similarly , article publish Kenny et al demonstrate successful implantation Sapien valve tricuspid position . Gillespie et al , recently publish series Melody implant mitral position sheep undergone annuloplasty ring placement . Other investigator successfully implant Melody valve aortic mitral position patient good immediate short/intermediate term outcome ( Ben-Gal et al , Hasan et al , Gossl et al ) . The Edwards Sapien Valve several report positive outcome implant within aortic position ( Thomas et al , Moat et al , Webb et al ) two case series report encourage result place mitral position . ( Seiffert et al , Cheung et al )</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Patients consider eligible transcatheter valve implantation risk serious morbidity mortality surgical intervention deem great 10 percent treat cardiologist consulting surgeon . The Melody Valve intend use follow clinical condition : Existence full ( circumferential ) RVOT conduit equal great 16 mm diameter originally implant , AND Dysfunctional RVOT conduits clinical indication intervention , AND EITHER Regurgitation ≥ moderate Stenosis : mean right ventricular outflow tract gradient ≥ 35 mmHg The Edwards Sapien Valve use aortic position valve conduit large 23mm diameter land zone less 2627mm , otherwise melody valve consider The Edwards Sapien Vavle also consider position adequate land zone large enough circumference The Melody valve may utilize outside approved indication valve replacement high risk surgical patient There know contraindication implantation Melody Valve Edwards Sapien Valve</criteria>
