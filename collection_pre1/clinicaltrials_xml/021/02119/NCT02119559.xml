	<brief_summary>In France , incidence head neck squamous cell carcinoma ( HNSCC ) 16 000 new cases/year . During last year , many new chemotherapy target therapy develop improve significantly overall survival patient notably anti-HER molecule . In inoperable recurrent and/or metastatic HNSCC , best treatment base anti-Human Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor ( EGFR ) antibody , target Human Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor 1 ( HER1 ) , Cetuximab combine platinum +/- 5 Fluoro Uracil ( 5FU ) : `` Extreme protocol `` . However , clinical biological criterion predictive drug efficacy report yet . Thus , development predictive factor urgent need HNSCC clinical pharmacy-economic level , propose best personalized treatment . One idea would enumerate characterize circulate tumor cell ( CTC ) could give u early evaluation therapeutic efficiency . In context , investigator develop innovative technology , EPISPOT assay ( patent University Medical Center Montpellier ) , allow detection &amp; characterization viable CTC peripheral blood . The EPISPOT technology already evaluate breast prostate cancer.Thus , investigator would like first time perform prospective study cohort patient treat follow Extreme protocol , technology , assess predictive value CTC count . The investigator use CellSearchÂ® system reference test .</brief_summary>
