	<brief_summary>Background : - In deep brain stimulation ( DBS ) , device call neurostimulator place chest . It attach wire part brain affect movement . DBS might help people movement disorder like Parkinson disease ( PD ) , dystonia , essential tremor ( ET ) . Objective : - To provide DBS treatment people movement disorder . Eligibility : - Adults 18 year old PD , ET , certain form dystonia . Design : - Participants screen medical history physical exam . They blood urine test : - MRI brain scan . The participant lie table slide metal cylinder magnetic field . They scanner 60 minute . They get earplugs loud noise . During part MRI , needle guide thin plastic tube arm vein dye inject . - Electrocardiogram . Metal disk sticky pad place chest , arm , leg . They record heart activity . - Chest X-ray . - Tests memory , attention , concentration , think , movement . - Eligible participant DBS surgery . The surgery hospital care afterward NOT part protocol . - Study doctor see participant 3 4 week surgery turn neurostimulator . - Participants return every month 3 month , every 3 month first year , every 6 month second year . Each time , participant examine answer question . DBS placement evaluate MRI . The neurostimulator program . At two visit , participant test movement , thinking , memory .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Objective : The purpose protocol : - To train NINDS Medical Neurology Branch fellows trainee aspect deep brain stimulation ( DBS ) treatment medically refractory Parkinson disease ( PD ) , dystonia , essential tremor ( ET ) indication , include patient selection , physiology , program management DBS placement ; - To maintain cohort patient treat DBS participate NIH protocol address efficacy functional surgery relevant physiology . - To use physiology efficacy data relate DBS therapy motor cognitive function patient population . All data collect outcome standard care analyse retrospective . All treatment protocol base current standard care DBS therapy . Subjects may enrol study teach value support participation DBS protocols , reason . Study Population : Patients 18 year old medically refractory PD , dystonia , ET may participate study . Other indication add subsequent amendment FDA approval deep brain stimulation extend condition . Study Design : The treatment render protocol standard care PD , dystonia , ET . Patients confirm medically refractory PD , dystonia ET offer DBS therapeutic option . Patients evaluated eligibility procedure risk/benefit balance surgical therapy assesse . After complete evaluation , decision make recommend procedure . At point patient refer surgical intervention NIH Surgical Neurology Branch collaborate surgeon community . If surgery perform NIH , Neurology DBS team involve surgical planning , target selection , intraoperative physiology record testing , specify SNB protocol . After surgery , patient follow NIH DBS clinic DBS programming initiate perform outline . The patient follow least two year , option transfer care back neurologists community continue care NIH Neurology team care community available . In addition , patient enrol protocol various point relation DBS surgery . Outcome Measures : The protocol teach protocol research question address prospectively . The main goal protocol ( 1 ) provide train DBS management procedure trainees Medical Neurology Branch section . ( 2 ) provide care patient treat DBS , whose surgery perform NIH another facility , could participate research protocol NIH , ( 3 ) To use clinically-generated data outcome measure , include change motor symptom , measure UPDRS III scale , change quality life PD patient measure UPDRS part II scale , Burke-Fahn-Marsden ( BFM ) dystonia rating scale Tremor Rating Scale 1 year treatment , level effective drug therapy surgery ; change behavior performance activity daily live ; complication therapy measure UPDRS I , II , IV scale surgery SF-12 score ; radiographic correlation DBS electrode position clinical change ; neurophysiological mechanism DBS relevant basal ganglia physiology . All data collect do standard care analysis retrospective .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>INCLUSION CRITERIA : To eligible entry study , candidate must meet following criterion : Be 18 year age old . Able provide inform consent . Have clinical diagnosis idiopathic PD , primary dystonia , ET : The diagnosis idiopathic PD base UK Brain Bank Criteria , confirm Movement Disorders Neurologists NIH Parkinson Clinic . The diagnosis primary ( generalized segmental ) , hemidystonia , cervical dystonia confirm clinical examination NIH Movement Disorders Clinic . The diagnosis ET confirm clinical examination NIH Movement Disorders Clinic ( diagnosis ET base bilateral , largely symmetric postural kinetic tremor involve hand forearm visible persistent . Additional isolate tremor head may present absence abnormal posturing ) . History appropriate response dopaminergic medication , least 30 % improvement motor UPDRS LDOPA history inclinic testing , PD patient . Unsatisfactory clinical response maximal medical management ( trial high low dos drug ) , include : For PD patient : good benefit dopaminergic medication associate insufficient duration action unacceptable sideeffects OR intractable disable motor fluctuation ( severe `` '' period , dyskinesia , freeze spell ) OR For ET dystonia : intractable symptom ET dystonia impact least 2 activity daily live . Interested evaluate undergo DBS , indicate , treat medically refractory movement disorder Patients already implant DBS continue management EXCLUSION CRITERIA : For DBS : Candidates exclude meet follow criterion : Age 18 year Clinically significant medical disease would increase risk develop pre postoperative complication , include limited uncontrolled systemic hypertension value 170/100 ; unstable heart disease ; unstable respiratory disease ; uncorrected coagulation abnormality need therapeutic anticoagulation interrupt ; Cognitive impairment Full Scale Intelligence Quotient ( FSIQ ) portion Wechsler Adult Intelligence test ( FSIQ less 70 ) . Evidence secondary atypical parkinsonism/dystonia/tremor suggest : History stroke , exposure toxin , neuroleptic , encephalitis Neurologic sign upper motor neuron cerebellar involvement , supranuclear gaze palsy , orthostatic hypotension . MRimaging evidence indicative secondary disease iron deposit putamen , tumor , stroke , could cause movement disorder . Dementia evidence formal neuropsychological evaluation Mattis Dementia Rating Scale2 ( DRS2 ) score 128 . Depression anxiety evidence selfreport Beck Depression Inventory2 ( score 20 ) Beck Anxiety Inventory , respectively . Unable undergo MRimaging implant pacemaker , medication pump , aneurysm clip , metallic prosthesis ( include metal pin rod , heart valve cochlear implant ) , shrapnel fragment , permanent eye liner small metal fragment eye welder metal worker may , candidate uncomfortable small close space ( claustrophobia ) , lie comfortably back one hour . Pregnant woman . Otherwise eligible DBS surgery , example know inability undergo anesthesia For DBS : Contraindications ongoing stimulation , intractable side effect DBS despite stimulation parameter adjustment</criteria>
