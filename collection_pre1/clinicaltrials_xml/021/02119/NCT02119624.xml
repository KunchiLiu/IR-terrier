	<brief_summary>Background : - People dependent alcohol drink even know something bad might happen . Researchers want learn . Objectives : - To study brain response person plays game different threat condition . Eligibility : - Healthy right-handed adult heavy drinker age 21 60 - Healthy right-handed adult light drinker age 21 60 Design : - Participants screen medical history , physical exam , blood urine test . They EKG psychiatric interview . - Participants one two clinic visit . - Participants ask alcohol drinking . - They choose snack alcoholic beverage must drink 5 minute . After breath alcohol content ( BrAC ) zero , play game MRI scanner . - The scanner metal cylinder take picture brain . Participants lie table slide cylinder . They 90 minute , lie still 20 minute . - During MRI , participant play simple computer game earn food drink point different threat electric shock . Points exchange food alcohol game . Sometimes , participant receive mild electric shock metal disk wrist . Electric shock happen participant try earn reward point . - After MRI , participant use point another drink snack . They stay clinic BrAC low , usually within 3 hour . Participants drive home . - Participants follow-up phone call next day .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Objective : Continued drug seek despite knowledge adverse consequence hallmark addiction . To model behavior , refine parameter modify Monetary Incentive Delay ( MID ) task allow u investigate neural substrate approach-avoidance conflict resolution . We use task investigate functional magnetic resonance imaging ( fMRI ) brain activation pursuit reward heavy light drinker . Study Population : Healthy non-treatment-seeking heavy drinker healthy light drinker age 21 60 . Design : The study require 1 2 visit . Subjects play modify MID task call Reward Incentive Delay Shock ( RIDS ) measure motivation earn cue reward point condition signal safe associate threat . After play RIDS task subject able self-administer alcohol and/or food base reward point earn task . Outcome measure : The outcome measure differences behavioral task performance blood oxygenation dependent level ( BOLD ) signal measure use standard fMRI technique analyze use AFNI software .</detailed_description>
