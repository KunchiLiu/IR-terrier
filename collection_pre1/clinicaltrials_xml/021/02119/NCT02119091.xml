	<detailed_description>A total 80 healthy subject enrol site , male female , age 18-45 year old . Half healthy Chinese volunteer , male female ; recruit obtain least 36 evaluable volunteer Chinese site CTC , PUTH . The half healthy Caucasian volunteer , male female ; recruit obtain least 36 evaluable volunteer U.S. site Spaulding Clinical Research LLC . An evaluable subject define volunteer complete study procedure screen period final ECG nominal time-point QTc interval measurement final blood sample plasma level Moxifloxacin last study day ( Day 2 second period ) . Study Objective : Primary Objective : To compare difference ΔΔQTcF ( Baseline-adjusted , placebo-corrected effect QTcF ) Chinese group Caucasian group exposure ( Cmax ) Moxifloxacin.Secondary Objectives:1 ) To compare difference ΔΔQTcF , heart rate , PR , RR , QRS Moxifloxacin plasma concentration Chinese group Caucasian group.2 ) To compare slope Moxifloxacin plasma Concentration/QTcF value healthy Chinese volunteer Caucasian Volunteers .</detailed_description>
