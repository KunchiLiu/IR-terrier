	<brief_summary>This study first administration GSK2798745 human . This sponsor un-blinded , placebo-controlled study investigate safety , tolerability , pharmacokinetics ( PK ) , pharmacodynamics ( PD ) GSK2798745 , give single repeat oral dose healthy subject stable heart failure ( HF ) subject . Approximately 28 healthy subject enrol study cohort ( Cohort 1-3 ) involve single repeat dose escalation GSK2798745 , 24 stable heart failure subject enrol Cohort 4 involve single repeat dose administration GSK2798745 , dose select base data healthy subject cohort . This would follow enrollment 8 subject heart failure Cohort 5 involve repeat dose administration GSK2798745 . The study duration , include screen follow-up , expect exceed 17 week subject study ( cohort ) .</brief_summary>
