	<brief_summary>Background : - Different part brain involve feeling touch . Researchers want study whether repetitive magnetic stimulation ( rTMS ) sensory cortex affect sensation feel . rTMS repeat magnetic pulse interfere brain activity . It affect small part brain beneath scalp . Researchers want find role sensory cortex sense different type touch . Objectives : - To find role sensory cortex , brain area , sense different type touch . Eligibility : - Healthy adult age 18 45 . Design : - Participants pre-screened telephone interview . Then screen physical psychological exam urine test . - In Session 1 , participant MRI brain scan fill questionnaire . - For MRI , magnetic field radio wave take picture brain . Participants lie table slide metal cylinder . A coil place head . They perform task scan . The scanner make loud knock noise . Participants get earplug . They scanner 60 minute . - In Sessions 2 3 , participant take Breathalyzer urine test . Their perception touch measure . Then rTMS use stimulate sensory cortex scalp 20 minute . Their perception touch measure . - For rTMS , wire coil hold scalp . A brief electrical current pass coil create magnetic pulse affect activity brain .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>This study test part sensory cortex relate different aspect touch sensation . 24 healthy male female adult ( age 18-45 ) enrol . We use low frequency repetitive transcutaneous magnetic stimulation ( rTMS ) temporarily reduce activation part sensory cortex examine effect procedure perception touch stimulus . After screen , participant undergo three test session . Session 1 involve questionnaire anatomical functional MRI scan ( non-invasive brain imaging ) use localize correct region stimulate rTMS . Sessions 2 3 involve active control rTMS test gentle ( non-painful ) touch sensation .</detailed_description>
