	<brief_summary>This randomized phase II trial study well photodynamic therapy HPPH work treat patient squamous cell carcinoma oral cavity . Photodynamic therapy use HPPH becomes active expose certain kind light . When drug active , cancer cell kill . This may effective squamous cell carcinoma oral cavity .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Photodynamic Therapy With HPPH Treating Patients With Squamous Cell Carcinoma Oral Cavity</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To test non-inferiority photodynamic therapy ( PDT ) standard care surgery . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . To determine improvement quality life ( QoL ) use University Washington Quality life questionnaire version 4 . II . To assess toxicity use Cancer Therapy Evaluation Program ( CTEP ) National Cancer Institute ( NCI ) Common Terminology Criteria Adverse Events ( CTCAE version 4.0 ) . III . To explore progression-free survival patient population treat HPPH mediate PDT . TERTIARY OBJECTIVES : I . Immune marker ( T cell ) . II . To investigate correlation tri-modal optical spectroscopy tumor response PDT . OUTLINE : Patients randomize 1 2 treatment arm . ARM I : Patients undergo standard care surgery day 1 . ARM II : Patients receive HPPH intravenously ( IV ) 1 hour day 0 . Approximately 24 hour later , patient undergo photodynamic therapy day 1 . After completion study treatment , patient follow 3-4 month 1 year , 3-6 month 1 year , 4-8 month 1 year , year 2 year .</detailed_description>
