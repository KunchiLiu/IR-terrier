	<brief_summary>Since introduction , 5-fluorouracil ( 5-FU ) cornerstone treatment metastatic colorectal cancer ( mCRC ) . Meanwhile oral 5FU pro-drug Capecitabine ( Xeloda® ) prove equivalence 5-FU well tolerated alternative combination partner Irinotecan ( XELIRI ) Oxaliplatin ( XELOX ) widely use first line treatment mCRC . Recent advance molecular biology result development inhibitor vascular endothelial growth factor ( VEGF ) monoclonal humanize antibody bevacizumab ( Avastin® ) . XELOX XELIRI +bevacizumab investigate several trial , approach clearly define cross-wise XELIRI-XELOX change criterion . This trial investigate two different sequential treatment option XELIRI/ XELOX first second line addition bevacizumab try give answer question optimal sequence benefit patient . This prospective , randomize , open-label , 2-arm pilot trial patient mCRC receive systemic treatment metastatic disease . The study design evaluate efficacy XELIRI follow XELOX XELOX follow XELIRI + bevacizumab term Duration Disease Control ( DDC ) . Patients treat establish first line therapy consist either XELOX XELIRI + bevacizumab . The chemotherapy treatment give 6 month except prior disease progression , unacceptable toxicity patient refusal . Bevacizumab give disease progression , unacceptable toxicity patient refusal . Capecitabine give addition investigator ' discretion disease progression , unacceptable toxicity patient refusal . If serious side effect occur despite adequate dose reduction , Oxaliplatin Irinotecan discontinue . In case Oxaliplatin Irinotecan-related discontinuation Capecitabine Bevacizumab continue . If Capecitabine also discontinue first line treatment bevacizumab continue . In case permanent discontinuation bevacizumab toxicity , chemotherapy continue . Upon completion first line chemotherapy patient disease control receive bevacizumab maintenance treatment . On investigator decision patient receive Capecitabine additional maintenance treatment . The primary endpoint determine efficacy modify XELIRI + bevacizumab follow XELOX + bevacizumab scheme progression comparison reverse sequence base DDC . Secondary endpoint first line progression-free survival ( PFS ) , second line PFS , overall response rate , time response , duration response , overall survival , tumor assessment ( base RECIST criterion ) use CT scan , MRI scan , X-ray , bone scan , clinical examination .</brief_summary>
