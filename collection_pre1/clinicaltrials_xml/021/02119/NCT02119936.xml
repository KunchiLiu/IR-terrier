	<brief_summary>Purpose : The investigator plan feasibility study easily disseminate biofeedback tool reduce stress among hospitalized expect mother . Converging evident suggests Heart Rate Variability Biofeedback improve threshold stress management improve executive functioning . Additionally HRVB show significantly reduce anxiety feature woman suffer perinatal depression . The investigator hypothesize HRVB reduce stress level among expect mother hospitalize pregnancy complication , high risk depression anxiety . Participants : Expecting mother hospitalize pregnancy complication , high risk depression anxiety . Procedures : The investigator plain use heart rate variability biofeedback tool measure stress reduction hospitalize expectant mother . This tool couple validate survey scale , high frequency heart rate variability , saliva sample , qualitative interview quantify reduction stress HRVB tool .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Feasibility Heart Rate Variability Biofeedback With Impatient Pregnant Women UNC-CH</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Background Significance : Hospitalization pregnancy unexpected interruption prenatal period cause increase maternal anxiety stress ( MacMullen 1992 ) . In study 129 woman hospitalize pregnancy complication , 25 meet criterion major depressive disorder ( Brandon 2008 ) . Such maternal depression risk factor perinatal complication range morbidity mortality neuropsychological developmental delay offspring ( Poehlmann 2001 ) . To date , however , easily disseminate strategy identify reduce stress among pregnant woman . To address gap , investigator plan feasibility study easily-disseminated biofeedback tool reduce stress among hospitalized expect mother ( Beckham 2013 ) . Converging evidence suggest Heart Rate Variability Biofeedback ( HRVB ) improve stress management executive functioning ( Association Applied Psychophysiology Biofeedback Inc 2011 ) . Additionally , HRVB recently show reduce anxiety feature woman suffer perinatal depression UNC ( Beckham 2013 ) . The investigator hypothesize HRVB reduce stress level among expect mother hospitalize pregnancy complication , high risk depression anxiety ( Brandon 2008 ) . Objectives : 1 . To determine feasibility use HRVB among hospitalize pregnant woman 2 . To measure association use HRVB maternal state anxiety . 3 . To measure association use HRVB , biological marker stress , indexed salivary cortisol oxytocin , high frequency heart rate variability , measure use research-quality instrument 4 . To measure effectiveness HRVB woman vary level clinical depression anxiety Study Design &amp; Methods : The investigator plan pilot study recruit 30 pregnant woman receive care antepartum floor NC Women 's Hospital . At baseline session , investigator consent participant screen depression anxiety . This screen involve use M.I.N.I Depression Module Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Screen ( EPDS ) . Both assessment score baseline determine participant severe , moderate , clinical depression anxiety . The investigator also record participant anxiety depression medication apart screen . The class drug investigator note : SSRIs , SNRIs , TCAs , MAOIs , Bupropion , Mirtazapine , Trazodone , Vortioxetine.The investigator also note medication give mental illness . Once screen complete , investigator collect sociodemographic information proceed teach participant biofeedback , use HRVB device , couple deep breathing technique detach stressful thought . The HRVB intervention administer Carole Swanson , register nurse extensive experience maternity care , complete HeartMathÂ® Interventions Certification Program ( HeartMath LLC 2013 ) . The certification provide detailed instruction use HRV Biofeedback clinical care . The HeartMath device , EmWave2 , use heart rate sensor patient 's earlobe detect beat-to-beat variability , index vagal tone . The device attach laptop computer allow user view visual cue deep breathing . The EmWave2 currently use clinical care inpatient psychiatry unit UNC hospital . Before HRVB session , participant complete three measure current psychological distress ( Spielberger State Anxiety Scale , Linear Analog Self Assessment , Warwick-Edinburgh Mental Well-Being scale ) . To measure biologic marker stress , investigator collect saliva sample measure blood pressure administer HRVB . In addition information participant ' high frequency heart rate variability also collect use Single Channel 3991x Biolog , research-quality measure heart rate variability . Participants instructed practice deep breathing exercise approximately ten minute day follow-up session complete brief log exercise . During period participant also ask complete validated inventory perceive social support life experience ( MOS Social Support Scale , Maternal Antenatal Attachment Scale Adverse Childhood Experiences ) . At follow visit , approximately 5 7 day follow baseline session , administration HRVB inventory maternal mood , saliva sample measurement high frequency heart rate variability repeat . The saliva sample use measure salivary one following : oxytocin , alpha-amylase , cortisol . Finally investigator attempt follow-up call participant six eight week follow discharge measure continue use HRVB technique satisfaction qualitative information HRVB feasibility . Outcome Measures/ Statistical Methods : For Specific Aim 1 , investigator report rate enrollment among woman approach join study , rate longitudinal data collection , loss follow-up . The investigator also analyze qualitative interview study participant regard use HRVB technique . For aim 2 , investigator use paired test compare current stress , LASA Warwick-Edinburgh wellbeing participant use HRVB device baseline day 5 hospitalization . The investigator also plan test salivary sample change salivary alpha-amylase salivary cortisol . However due current funding restriction , sample bio-banked . For aim 3 , investigator measure HF-HRV 1-minute segment HRVB , investigator test whether coherence score , record HRVB device , correlate HF-HRV . For Specific Aim 4 , investigator stratify population base depression screen use baseline visit . These group include severe , moderate , lack depression . The investigator compare group find survey maternal mood difference notice among group due HRVB tool .</detailed_description>
