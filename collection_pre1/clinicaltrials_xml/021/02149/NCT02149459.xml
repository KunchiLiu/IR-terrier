	<brief_summary>Recurrent brain tumour extremely aggressive despite optimal treatment , median survival less two year . One standard treatment option situation radiation therapy . Currently intense scientific interest concern abnormal energy metabolism cancer cell . All cell require energy order function , obtain 'fuel ' molecule glucose fatty acid blood stream . Brain tumours exhibit `` metabolic reprogramming '' , mean energy requirement utilization fuel molecule quite different normal cell . Brain tumour cell exquisitely dependant glucose source energy . Animal study show tumour deprive glucose sensitive radiation therapy . In clinical trial investigator combine radiation therapy low-carbohydrate diet , patient recurrent brain tumour . In addition , subject receive medication metformin , drug usually use treat diabetes . Metformin inhibit glucose metabolism within cancer cell , additionally report intrinsic anti-cancer activity . Subjects undergo advanced image hormonal study , trial order obtain maximal translational-scientific impact . The hypothesis : The metabolic change induce combination moderately-low carbohydrate diet combine supplementary MCT metformin therapy selectively starve tumor cell . While normal brain cell capable derive energy ketone body glucose restriction , tumor cell remain largely glucose-dependent energy due oncogene induce down-regulation oxidative phosphorylation . While tumor cell 'vulnerable ' state less able repair damage induce ionizing radiation . Short-term implementation metabolic intervention ( i.e . combine diet metformin therapy ) prior , , hypofractionated ( 2 week ) radiation therapy expect increase tolerability , increase compliance avoid chronic metabolic complication associate extreme carbohydrate restriction diet .</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Willingness ability participate diet/metformin intervention 8 week period . Patients must previously histologically cytologically confirm glioma ( astrocytic oligodendroglial supratentorial tumor grade 2 , 3 4 accord WHO 2007 classification 82 ) previously treat fractionate radiation therapy show evidence recurrence . There limit regard number / type previous therapy patient receive glioma , aside exception mention . If brain tumor eloquent location ( e.g . brain stem ) clinical diagnosis sufficient . Patients must recover toxic effect prior therapy . Patients must recover effect prior surgery part body . There must minimum 10 day day surgery day registration . For core needle biopsy , minimum 7 day must elapse prior registration . Patients may previously undergo one craniotomy . Prior treatment cytotoxic biological agent permissible . There least 2 week break prior treatment enrollment . Prior treatment fractionate radiation therapy ( 66Gy ) eligibility criterion , however complete ≥ 4 week prior enrollment . One prior single fraction radiosurgical procedure within treatment field acceptable V12 &lt; 5cc ( V12 volume brain receive 12 Gy ) . Additional radiosurgical procedure outside treatment area acceptable . Age &gt; =18 year . ECOG performance status &lt; 2 ( Karnofsky &gt; 60 % ) . Life expectancy great 2 month .
