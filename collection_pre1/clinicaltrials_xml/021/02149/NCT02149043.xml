	<brief_summary>Ulcerative colitis represent chronic condition occur relapse remit fashion uncertain outcome require lifelong treatment considerable side effect . Diagnostic method currently use , clinical ( endoscopy ) , image ( CT , MR ) laboratory ( C - reactive protein , calprotectin ) give insight disease activity , possibly associate significant discomfort patient / increase risk irradiation potential allergic reaction contrast agent . For reason need noninvasive , biologically inert method evaluation disease activity inflammatory bowel disease ( IBD ) . Thermography possess characteristic . The aim study find potential link pathological thermographic sign endoscopic finding , serum C reactive protein ( CRP ) calprotectin stool patient active extensive ulcerative colitis .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Thermography Surveillance Ulcerative Colitis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Hypothesis : Documenting pathological thermographic sign patient extensive ulcerative colitis investigator demonstrate pathological thermography criterion correlate standard inflammatory marker Mayo endoscopic subscore ( ESS ) , CRP calprotectin patient ulcerative colitis . Aims : The aim study record abdominal thermographic image patient active ulcerative colitis ( UC ) , create interpretational thermographic criterion image compare abdominal infrared ( IR ) image healthy volunteer . Furthermore investigator intend correlate criterion standard marker inflammation CRP calprotectin patient UC begin treatment end . Materials method : For purpose work , 30 patient extensive UC 30 healthy individual put throe thermographic imagining , stool test calprotectin blood CRP . In addition , patient UC receive colonoscopy evaluation . Expected scientific contribution : The result paper would give additional contribution exist tool pursue ulcerative colitis activity thus demonstrate potential thermography complementary method standard method assess disease activity . Establishing diagnostic criterion method would good addition present clinical practice .</detailed_description>
