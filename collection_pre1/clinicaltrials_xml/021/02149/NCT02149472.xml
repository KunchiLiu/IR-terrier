	<brief_summary>Major obstetric haemorrhage ( MOH ) remain cause significant maternal morbidity mortality worldwide . By identify woman higher priori risk major haemorrhage pregnancy early postpartum haemorrhage extra measure prevent MOH take . In study investigator aim identify haemostatic parameter course haemorrhage responsible on-going towards major bleed . By , cut-off point define future intervention aim stop bleeding process early stage . Traditional coagulation parameter currently useful clinical decision making , long turn around time . Therefore add value available coagulation 'point care ' test evaluate obstetric haemorrhage.These Point-of-Care ( POC ) test could lead goal-directed haemostatic therapy obstetric haemorrhage . A cohort 9.500 pregnant woman follow pregnancy delivery . From woman bleed score obtain pregnancy mean validate questionnaire . The predictive value bleed score occurrence major obstetric haemorrhage evaluate . If postpartum haemorrhage develops ( blood loss ) &gt; 1000 cc , blood sample draw conventional haemostatic parameter ROTEM profile . The pathway minor bleeding major bleeding elucidate . Interchangeability comparability conventional haemostatic parameter ROTEM profile also evaluate . The overall goal investigator become able predict major obstetric haemorrhage early stage postpartum haemorrhage define threshold goal-directed hemostatic therapy .</brief_summary>
