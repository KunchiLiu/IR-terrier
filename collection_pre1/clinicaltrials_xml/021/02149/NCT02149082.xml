	<brief_summary>This study determine whether Near infrared spectroscopy ( NIRS ) optical density ( OD ) measurement Infrascanner device accurately identify presence intracranial hematoma pediatric patient ≤18 year age know suspected traumatic brain injury compare head computerize tomography ( CT ) scan gold standard .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Near-infrared Spectroscopy ( NIRS ) Intracranial Hematoma Detection Children</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>A key decision point management patient acute traumatic brain injury determine presence intracranial hematoma may require neurosurgical intervention . An expand hematoma lead significant neurological morbidity death due brainstem compression ischemic injury . Unfortunately , single physical sign , symptom , score reliably indicate presence intracranial hematoma . A computerized tomography ( CT ) scan head gold standard emergent identification localization acute intracranial hematoma . However , ionize radiation CT scan associate increased risk develop malignancy . Near infrared spectroscopy ( NIRS ) non-invasive technology may useful adjunctive modality CT scan early identification intracranial hematoma . A hand-held NIRS device call Infrascanner show 90 % sensitivity specificity detect intracranial hematoma adult small study show similar result child . The present study aim validate device wide age range pediatric subject multiple hospital setting device may serve valuable screen tool .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Males female ≤18 year admit Children 's Hospital Philadelphia ( CHOP ) ED PICU know suspect traumatic head injury undergo head CT scan evaluate presence intracranial hematoma . Head injury occur &lt; 12 hour prior presentation initial CT scan , subject clinical change prompt repeat CT scanning . Evidence extensive scalp injury include laceration , avulsion , abrasion impair proper coupling Infrascanner device subject 's head prevent placement device specify location . History neurosurgical procedure ( e.g . decompressive craniectomy ) residual bone flap .</criteria>
