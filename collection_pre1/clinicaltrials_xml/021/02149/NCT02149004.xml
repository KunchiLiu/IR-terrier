	<brief_summary>Despite major advance therapy management , HIV/AIDS continue major cause infectious disease morbidity mortality global scale . The discovery effective antiretroviral treatment turn HIV infection manageable chronic disease patient access care . However , different economic epidemiologic situation develop developed country require different research priority , three main challanges universal focus research DZIF HIV Translational Platform : - Prevention HIV infection - Long-term life HIV - HIV cure The `` Translation Reserach HIV '' bring together clinical researcher HIV infection order develop new treatment option mention main challanges . It take advantage exist expertise ( e.g . basic science , novel target treatment HIV eradiation ) partner site . This platform necessary Germany 's HIV research suffer past lack integration excellent basic science clinical research . In addition , little integration network address main international challenge . There urgent need link research strand dedicate structure emphasise translation preclinical result new therapy .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>German Centre Infection Research HIV Translational Platform</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Structure The DZIF HIV Translational Platform belong HIV Thematic Translational Units ( TTUs ) German Centre Infection Research ( DZIF ) , found Federal Ministry Education Research ( BMBF ) . The national , multi-centre structure DZIF bring together selceted university , university hospital , non-university research institute translational effort focus distinct infectious diesease-related health problem co-ordinated TTUs . The TTU HIV locate six DZIF partner sit Germany : Bonn-Cologne , Brunswick-Hannover , Gie√üen-Marburg-Langen , Hamburg , Heidelberg , Munich . Mission Objectives Prevention HIV : The main tool effective prevention include vaccine , microbicides , preventive therapy induction behavioral change . Currently , group Germany specific preclinical expertise area . This expertise need develop integrated DZIF able implement internationally competitive HIV vaccine microbicide programme . Long-term life HIV : This challenge equally relevant develop developed world . DZIF researcher make many internationally visible contribution management HIV infection past . They extensive experience clinical study HIV field play major role clinical development new drug HIV therapy ( e.g . maraviroc , raltegravir ) . They also intensively involved establishment clinical guideline management HIV infection . HIV cure : Antiretroviral therapy completely suppress HIV replication limit detection sustain period time , eradicate virus silent reservoir . Accordingly , life-long therapy need interruption therapy always lead resurgence viral spread disease . Several approach suggest eliminate silently infect cell HIV genome integrated cell . These approach currently mostly stage basic research early preclinical development need develop translational chain . While significant knowledge exist nature silent reservoir , number clonality viral integration site currently largely unknown need investigate develop virus eradication strategy therapy . The aim DZIF HIV Translational Platform comprehensively collaboratively analyze mention aspect use cohort HIV infect patient different stage different course disease . These cohort establish participate partner site , coordinate extended focus site Bonn-Cologne . This study protocol framework platform future substudies .</detailed_description>
