	<brief_summary>Depression lead contributor global burden disease . Antidepressants provide adequate response many patient . Mind-body therapy often safe , increasingly embrace patient albeit limited good quality clinical trial data . The PI show autonomic instability patient late life depression ( LLD ) . Through team across discipline researcher investigate benefit one adjunctive mind-body intervention , automatic self transcend meditation autonomic instability LLD depressive symptom compare treatment usual . If result positive , intervention could use management LLD across level care . WHAT IS THE INNOVATION AND MAIN QUESTION/HYPOTHESIS UNDERLYING THIS PROPOSAL ? The main study objective assess heart rate variability ( HRV ) , autonomic parameter depression score patient late life depression undergo innovative mind-body therapy 'automatic self-transcending meditation ' ( ASTM ) previously evaluate randomize controlled manner treatment late life depression : The investigator hypothesise patient LLD treatment usual ( TAU ) +ASTM lead significant increase HRV baseline end study period compare treatment usual TAU . The investigator also hypothesise ASTM+TAU cause significant difference autonomic parameter include heart rate blood pressure change presence physiological stress test ( hand grip ) , depression depression relate pathology anxiety improve quality life compare TAU . It expect add ASTM TAU well TAU improve HRV , depression severity autonomic parameter treatment LLD . It expect intervention produce significant anxiolytic enhance quality life outcome major side effect . If result study positive , possible intervention could consider treatment option management disable illness primary , secondary tertiary care . Such treatment option would cost staff effective , self empower current standard care . It could also provide treatment option patient currently resistant antidepressant .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Late life depression cardiovascular autonomic function : Major depressive disorder elderly ( &gt; 60 year age ) , also know late life depression ( LLD ) , common , disable associate high mortality rate cause suicide well cardiovascular event compel appropriate treatment . Research show naturalistic set response rate least one antidepressant trial adequate dose duration alone around 30-40 % thereby necessitating usage additional intervention . Such therapy include psychological therapy , , recently , various form treatment loosely define mind-body therapy biofeedback , energy healing , meditation , guide imagery , yoga . Mind-body therapy increasingly embrace patient negligible side effect , easy administer display beneficial effect quality life well comorbid anxiety . There increase research mechanism benefit therapy , however , good quality trial data scant . It well establish antidepressant work mostly modify neurotransmitter level brain . On hand , mind-body therapy target multiple organ system hence could offer neurobiological advantage depression recognise multi-system disorder . This particularly relevant LLD population increase prevalence comorbid cardiovascular disorder . Hence , mind body therapy offer combination antidepressant might beneficial effect depression cardiovascular system . One way assess cardiovascular system measurement various autonomic parameter i.e . heart rate , blood pressure heart rate variability . The commonly report heart rate variability ( HRV ) manifestation interplay central nervous system autonomic nervous system beat-by-beat basis . One way estimation calculate elapsed time two consecutive wave , call R wave , person 's electrocardiogram ( ECG ) . A consistent finding reduce HRV people suffer myocardial infarction ( MI ) , phenomena predictor subsequent cardiac arrhythmia even death . In addition , previous work PI find LLD significant cardiovascular autonomic disturbance compare age match control control various risk factor . Other study conduct depression across human life span find similar result . Hence , mind-body treatment specifically target autonomic dysfunction positive benefit depressive symptom , would valuable ass . The investigator would like investigate therapy select base previous report beneficial effect evaluate randomise control trial LLD patient . Automatic self-transcending meditation ( ASTM ) . ASTM class meditation help quiet mind induces physiological mental relaxation whilst eye shut . It utilize specific sound value ( mantra ) draw attention inward permit mind experience restful alert state consciousness . Research suggest ASTM easy learn teach comparison meditation technique include mindfulness . Studies adult elderly ASTM practitioner document reduction depressive symptom , well improvement cardiovascular function among elderly without cardiovascular disease . A study adult CVD demonstrate improvement HRV . Research suggest ASTM may particularly well suit elderly population . In randomized control trial elderly retirement home resident evaluate ASTM two meditative technique treatment usual , ASTM produce significantly great improvement cognitive function , cardiovascular function quality life treatment condition . A subsequent meta-analysis all-cause mortality rate among hypertensive elderly participate stress reduction intervention find ASTM practitioner 30 % low cardiovascular mortality rate four meditative relaxation interventions20 . The investigator predict ASTM augmentation effective intervention ameliorates autonomic disturbance associate LLD , possibly beneficial effect depressive symptom compare control treatment usual ( TAU ) group . Primary hypothesis : The investigator hypothesise patient LLD , ASTM+TAU lead significant increase HRV baseline end study period compare TAU . Secondary hypothesis : The investigator hypothesise ASTM+TAU cause ) significant fall depression score b ) significant improvement autonomic parameter include heart rate blood pressure change presence physiological stress test ( hand grip ) c ) significant improvement depression relate symptom pathology include impaired quality life anxiety ; compare TAU .</detailed_description>
