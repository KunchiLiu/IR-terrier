	<brief_summary>Medical education transform mainly didactic class 19th century clerkship internship training base concept `` learning '' 20th century . There new challenge medical education 21th century , include knowledge explosion , importance communication teamwork clinical care , lack comprehensive systemic experiential learning . Therefore , another paradigm shift medical education century necessary . This research project , apply high-fidelity simulation , resuscitation teamwork model , concept flip classroom resuscitation training , take innovation reform resuscitation training pilot test paradigm shift medical education . This research project 4-year project . Three innovative intervention resuscitation training develop , implement , evaluate . There 4 phase project : 1 . Development phase ( 1st year ) : establishment structure , validity reliability test , faculty development , course preparation . 2 . Experiment phase ( 2nd year ) : comparative study conduct . 3 . Implementation phase ( 3rd year ) : integration implementation innovative intervention . 4 . Evaluation phase ( 4th year ) : effectiveness evaluation analysis learn retention . Through innovation , development , implementation effectiveness evaluation 4 phase , research project hope integrate high-fidelity simulation , resuscitation teamwork model , concept flip classroom , resuscitation training successfully appropriately . Furthermore , experience provide base paradigm shift medical education future .</brief_summary>
