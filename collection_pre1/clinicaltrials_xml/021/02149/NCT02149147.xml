	<brief_title>Variety Physical Activity Normal Overweight Adults Who Are Regularly Active</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Many individual , particularly obese , inactive increase physical activity continue challenge , thus , develop strategy assist individual engage sustain high level physical activity imperative.1,2 Incorporating variety activity physical activity program strategy may promise increase physical activity levels.3 Data National Health Nutrition Examination Survey ( NHANES ) show individual report engage variety activity ( i.e. , walk + leisure-time activity ) likely meet national physical activity recommendation compare report variety ( i.e. , walk ) .4 In another study , investigator find overweight participant 18-month behavioral lifestyle intervention report physical activity variety ( i.e. , ≥ 2 activity ) 6 month high self-reported physical activity-related energy expenditure lower body mass index ( BMI ) 18 month report physical activity variety ( i.e. , 1 activity ) .5 Additionally , investigator also find perform variety activity relate great engagement objectively measure moderate- vigorous-intensity physical activity successful weight loss maintainer normal weight individuals.6 Based literature available , appear increase number activity physical activity regimen assist increase engagement physical activity . However , physical activity variety primarily examine sum number different activity person engage ( i.e. , walk + leisure-time activity ) . Other environmental factor , include location , visual auditory stimulus , number type people engage physical activity close proximity , may impact degree variety differ physical activity people engage . Thus , purpose study collect information physical activity variety . Specific Aims : Specific Aim 1 . To determine average minute moderate- vigorous-intensity physical activity participant engage . Specific Aim 2 . To determine environmental factor influence degree variety physical activity participant engage . Specific Aim 3 . To determine average number minute moderate- vigorous-intensity physical activity increase variety physical activity increase .</detailed_description>
