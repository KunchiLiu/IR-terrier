	<brief_summary>Cholecystectomy one common operation perform general surgeon . Since , first video-laparoscopic cholecystectomy 1987 , laparoscopic cholecystectomy ( LC ) become gold standard treatment benign biliary disease . In daily practice , LC increase general surgeon familiarity video-laparoscopic operation become first step search minimally invasive technique perform advanced laparoscopic operation . In order move forward minimal invasive surgery concept less surgical trauma well cosmetic result , surgeon firstly reduce number incision port , idea totally eliminate skin incision use natural orifice implement select case . In theory , minimal incision must provide minimal postoperative pain well cosmetic result . With use single-incision laparoscopic cholecystectomy ( SILC ) , purpose achieve mean cosmesis provide minimal postoperative pain still controversial . Recent report , LC vs. SILC show significantly favorable cosmetic benefit , comparable complication rate hospital stay SILC , mean operation time significantly longer . Today , lack standardized operation technique , need specialized instrument , fear inability apply safe cholecystectomy principle , long operation time , cost-effectivity advance laparoscopic experience still limit factor perform SILC . The aim prospective randomize control trial compare gold standard LC SILC use new technique call `` Pick ' n roll '' ( SILC-PR ) . Our goal provide critical view safety safe cholecystectomy principle SILC , improve operator ergonomics shorten operation time eliminate need specialize instrument .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>A pilot study conduct , ten patient plan perform laparoscopic cholecystectomy approval ethic committee Ondokuz Mayis University , Samsun , Turkey . Among ten patient , five patient undergone LC , another five undergone SILC-PR . The sample size calculate pilot study . Simple consecutive allocation method use randomly divide subject LC ( classical four port technique ) , SILC- '' Pick ' n roll '' ( PR ) begin experienced group . Each group contain 20 patient . The randomization achieve regardless demographic characteristic , Dr. N. O . One surgeon perform operation ( Dr. R . A. ) . Patient 's data record Dr. K. Y . At end study , data analyse Dr. S. C. Dr. E. C. blind manner avoid bias Surgical Procedures The technique use LC conventional four-trocar approach ( 10-mm optic umbilicus , 10-mm trocar epigastrium two 5-mm trocars right upper abdomen ) . For SILC-PR , patient position supine operating table , access gain abdomen , patient re-positioned reverse trendelenburg leave tilt . The surgeon stand left side patient assistant stand opposite placement single-port device . SILC-PR performed single-incision , single port technique use The OCTOTMPort ( Dalimsurg , Seoul , Korea ) . The OCTOTMPort re-usable single-port device contains two 5-mm , one 10-mm one 12-mm port port . Surgical access abdomen obtain intraumbilical 2.5 cm incision 12 o'clock 6 o'clock . The OCTOTMPort insert pneumoperitoneum create abdominal pressure 15 mmHg . A 10-mm , 30º traditional scope ( Karl Storz , Tuttlingen , Germany ) insert inferior place 10-mm port , assistant position patient 's left side , peritoneal cavity examine . If stomach distend , nasogastric tube insertion request anesthesiologist . The surgeon introduce Endo Grasp™ ( Covidien , Mansfield , MA , USA ) leave hand elevate gallbladder fundus ass mobility gallbladder infindibulum , constant fundus retraction use whole operation instrument . In presence omental attachment , gallbladder infindibulum free monopolar hook device hold surgeon 's right hand , traction fundus . Once gallbladder infindibulum free attachment clearly see first examination next step operation launch . A 2.0 multifilament straight atraumatic needle insert surgeon 's left falciform ligament simultaneous palpation abdominal wall optimum insertion site . The needle grasp laparoscopic needleholder use surgeon 's right hand , needle pass Hartmann 's pouch lowest accessible point . To allow infindibulum retraction , wide triangulation free Hartmann 's pouch manipulation like `` puppeteer movement '' , pass suture needle turn around afferent suture `` half-knot '' create . The needle pass back abdomen surgeon 's left midclavicular line , simultaneous palpation abdominal wall optimum site . After point , assistant nurse grasp two end suspensory suture clamp . With help fundus retraction assistant 's right leave hand dominant pulling tension suture , classical Hartmann 's pouch retraction similar LC technique provide . Dissection Calot 's triangle removal gallbladder liver bed possible almost case use aforementioned `` Pick ' n roll technique '' hook diathermy .</detailed_description>
