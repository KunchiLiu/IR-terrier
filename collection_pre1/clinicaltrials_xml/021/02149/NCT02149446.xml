	<brief_summary>Dividing pancreas perform left-sided resection open risk leakage divide end pancreas . Pancreatic juice could severe effect surround abdominal tissue abscess formation produce systemic inflammation potential lethal bleeding . Studies show reinforcement staple line divide pancreas could reduce risk leakage . Surgisis ( COOK Medical ) product already use staple line reinforcement gastric lung surgery could use reinforcement staple pancreas left side resection . In prospective randomize trial want compare Surgisis reinforcement reinforcement staple division leave side pancreatic resection . Primary outcome pancreatic fistula yes/no .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Does Reinforcement Staple Line Left Pancreatectomy Reduce Rate Pancreatic Fistula ?</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Resection distal pancreas often do due localize tumor body tail pancreas . During late year mortality pancreatic resection reduce still substantial risk severe complication mainly due leakage pancreatic division line could lead suffering , long hospital stay , high cost sometimes death . Leakage tail resection probably common thought . Frequencies 30 % even 60 % report . The use somatostatin reduce production pancreatic juice comparison staple division , suture remain part cut pancreas cover glue available surround tissue show significant superiority method except positive trend regard staple technique . Staple line reinforcement resorbable mesh study show negative positive effect pancreatic fistula frequency . These study small non-randomized . A large randomize single blind study Hamilton et al hand show significant positive effect pancreatic fistula frequency distal pancreatic resection use absorbable reinforcement device put stapler , regard type B C fistula define ISGPF ( International Study Group Pancreatic Fistula ) pancreatic leak grade system . Although endeavor problem pancreatic fistula remain therefore operation conclude deposit one drain area cut pancreas . There therefore importance continue work reduce complication high risk pancreatic surgery use scientific procedure high quality blind randomize control trial ( RCT ) . The use reinforce staple technique use lung surgery bariatric surgery reduce air leakage strengthen anastomose . The material use process submucosa small bowel pig , produce COOK© Medical fit endoscopic stapler Ethicon© Covidien© . After promise result Hamilton et al plan study reinforcement make COOK© could reduce frequency pancreatic fistula staple distal pancreatic surgery single blind RCT .</detailed_description>
