	<brief_summary>About 90 % vascular symptom affect low limb consist venous disease . Its high incidence occur second decade life , affect significantly economically active population . Chronic Venous Insufficiency treatment aim relieve symptom , treat prevent complication , prevent recurrence provide cosmetic satisfaction minimal side effect . It 's current treatment include classic postural measure ( leg elevation ) , elastic stocking bandage compression therapy possible medication ( phlebotonics ) . The result medium long term unfavorable , since large number patient get good evolves recurrence symptom . Nowadays many , prospective , randomize , international study show favorable result endovascular treatment obstruction iliac vein territory patient advance Chronic Venous Insufficiency . The purpose prospective , double-blinded randomize study evaluate result obtain endovascular treatment , use angioplasty stenting group patient compare clinical treatment .</brief_summary>
