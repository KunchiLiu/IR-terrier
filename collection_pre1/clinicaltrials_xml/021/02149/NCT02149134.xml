	<brief_summary>Cow 's milk protein allergy define immunological reaction one milk proteins . A variety symptom suggestive cow 's milk protein allergy . Cow 's milk protein allergy suspect clinically 5-15 % infant , estimate prevalence cow 's milk protein allergy vary 2 5 % . Confusion regard cow 's milk protein allergy prevalence often due difference study population , study design lack define diagnostic criterion . The importance define diagnostic criterion need emphasise . It preclude infant unnecessary diet avoids delay diagnosis , lead malnutrition . There two clinical type cow 's milk protein allergy : immediate delayed type . The immediate type usually present within minute ingestion cow 's milk protein urticaria , angio-oedema , vomit acute flare atopic dermatitis present slightly half patient cow 's milk protein allergy . Delayed reaction atopic dermatitis gastrointestinal symptom like proctocolitis enteropathy usually present hour day . Immunologically , cow 's milk protein allergy IgE non-IgE mediate . IgE mediate reaction often immediate type . Non-IgE mediate reaction often cell mediate mixed cell IgE mediate difficult prove specific test . The immunological reaction differentiate cow 's milk protein allergy milk induce pathology lactose intolerance . A variety symptom suggestive cow 's milk protein allergy although none diagnostic . A good medical history remain cornerstone diagnosis . The treatment cow 's milk protein allergy dietary elimination cow 's milk protein . In non-breastfed infant child le 2 year age , substitute formula mandatory prescribed several international scientific society . Extensively hydrolyzed formula use therapeutic formula . An extensively hydrolysed formula often whey casein base formula protein chop small piece less allergenic . Because high cross-reactivity ( 80 % ) nutritional inadequacy , use animal milk soy-based formula precluded.The infant maintain elimination diet child 9-12 month age least 6 month , whichever occur first . In case , symptom improve substantially within 2-4 week diagnosis correct . According consensus literature , therapeutic formula formula tolerate least 90 % ( 95 % confidence ) cow 's milk protein allergy infant . The aim investigator study show efficacy , tolerance nutritional adequacy newly develop thicken extensively hydrolyzed formula infant prove cow 's milk protein allergy . In included patient , cow 's milk protein allergy diagnose base double blind placebo control food challenge , consider golden standard cow 's milk protein allergy diagnosis . To evaluate efficacy formula , formula tolerate least 90 % ( 95 % confidence ) cow 's milk protein allergy infant follow literature consensus . A symptom diary fill purpose patient ' parent legal guardian patient follow clinically doctor several time study period . Nutritional adequacy formula evaluate clinically follow growth weight several time study period compare standard WHO growth curve , base breastfed infant .</brief_summary>
