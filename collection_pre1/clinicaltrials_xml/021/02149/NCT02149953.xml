	<brief_summary>It important pregnant woman eat adequate amount protein ensure healthy growth development fetus . Amino acid building block body 's protein . Glycine amino acid make body , certain metabolic circumstance ( e.g . pregnancy ) body 's need may high glycine may need obtain diet . Currently , know glycine may need diet pregnancy . We plan study dietary glycine requirement healthy pregnant woman , early late gestation . We use modern , safe quick method . The purpose study determine dietary glycine requirement healthy pregnant woman mid ( 20 - 30 week ) late ( 31 - 40 week ) gestation . The investigator hypothesize dietary requirement glycine pregnancy due increase metabolic demand . With increased glycine intake investigator hypothesize observe increase protein synthesis , measure indicator amino acid oxidation ( IAAO ) method .</brief_summary>
