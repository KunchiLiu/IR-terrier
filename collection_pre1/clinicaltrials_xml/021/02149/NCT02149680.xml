	<detailed_description>A major risk epidural analgesia ( EDA ) accidental dural puncture ( ADP ) . ADP occur approximately 1 % pregnant woman receive EDA connection childbirth . Postdural puncture headache ( PDPH ) common complication ADP affect approximately 86 % mother ADP . Headache ADP may severe sometimes affect interaction newborn baby mother . The headache orthostatic make patient bedridden , associate symptom nausea , vomit , tinnitus hearing change . The symptom think represent leakage cerebrospinal fluid ( CSF ) , turn lead reduced CSF volume intracranial hypotension . These volume change lead traction pain-sensitive intracranial structure . There study literature either confirm visualized CSF leakage ADP . The diagnosis PDPH solely base clinical examination . There 50 different treatment option PDPH . These treatment divide conservative invasive . Among others , conservative treatment option include bed rest , caffeine various pain medication . Several study show absence definite curative effect treatment option . The widely use invasive method management PDPH epidural blood patch ( EBP ) . EBP first introduce 60 's apply three ml patient ' blood epidurally . Over year , volume increase least 15-20 ml basis case report study small number participant without definite scientific evidence . However , EBP apply sooner 24 hour onset accidental dura puncture , risk failure high . Further study require literature confirm efficacy EBP . Additionally , long term effect EBP remain either unknown vaguely understood . Are treat acute symptom invasive method , know long term sequela ? Since audiometric change know result follow ADP , change persist long period time ? Therefore , interested assess long term effect EBP backache , headache audiometric change parturients delivered year 2005 - 2011 .</detailed_description>
