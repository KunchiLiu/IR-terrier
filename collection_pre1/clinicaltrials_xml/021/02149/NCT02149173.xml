	<brief_summary>This clinical trial study use [ F-18 ] 16 alpha-fluoroestradiol ( [ F-18 ] FES ) positron emission tomography ( PET ) measure tumor hormone receptor expression patient undergo endocrine-targeted therapy newly diagnose breast cancer breast cancer come back spread place body . Comparing result diagnostic procedure do , , hormone therapy may help measure patient 's response treatment .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>F-18 FES PET Measuring Hormone Expression Patients With Primary , Recurrent Metastatic Breast Cancer Undergoing Endocrine-Targeted Therapy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . Measure effect endocrine target therapy estrogen receptor ( ER ) expression estradiol bind receptor use serial FES PET fludeoxyglucose ( FDG ) PET . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . Document safety profile FES PET patient breast cancer . II . Examine association FES PET result serial measurement hormone level peripheral blood , related efficacy endocrine-targeted therapy . Correlate FES PET uptake measure histopathological assay tumor microenvironment study biopsy specimen , relevant specific treatment regimen . OUTLINE : Patients undergo F-18 FES PET scan baseline . Patients also undergo F-18 FES PET FDG PET 1-12 week start therapy , 1-12 week second FES PET scan . After completion study treatment , patient follow 20 year .</detailed_description>
