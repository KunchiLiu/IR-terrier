	<brief_summary>A cornerstone PD research investigation neurophysiological change potential biomarkers could help track disease progression response therapy . Electroencephalography ( EEG ) could provide non-invasive relatively cheap tool identification biomarkers . In study use high-density electroencephalograph ( EEG ) recording , order develop platform biomarkers could sensitive reliable disease progression response therapeutic intervention standard clinical measure .</brief_summary>
