	<detailed_description>Social cognitive impairment , particularly deficits distortion recognition interpretation social cue representation thought , intention , feeling others—termed mentalization—are key contributor pathology morbidity number psychiatric disorder , include schizophrenia spectrum personality disorder . Individuals schizotypal personality disorder deficit social cognition ( hypomentalization ) , individual borderline personality disorder seem exaggerate distorted social cognition ( hypermentalization ) . However , specificity mechanism impairment remain unclear . Therefore , good understand modulation social cognition priority develop intervention pharmacologic psychosocial . The investigator propose examine effect oxytocin , know key regulator social cognition modulate frontolimbic neural circuitry , social cognition schizotypal borderline patient . In , aim characterize model optimum social cognitive activity direct development treatment , include dose target population-specific effect . To end , investigator propose perform 2-year study 30 patient , ( 15 schizotypal , 15 borderline ) perform 3 round social cognition test three acute single-dose treatment condition ( intranasal oxytocin dose 24IU 40IU placebo ) separate washout period , repeated-measures , within-subjects , randomize , placebo-controlled , double-blind , counterbalanced cross-over proof-of concept design . 15 healthy control receive oxytocin/placebo perform 3 round social cognition test separate approximately 4 week , serve benchmark normal performance control practice effect . Social cognitive testing perform 45 minute drug/placebo administration identical protocol time . The social cognitive test serve primary outcome measure Movie Assessment Social Cognition ( MASC ) . well another test social cognition , Reading Mind Eyes test . The investigator compare outcome measure baseline ( placebo day ) schizotypal borderline patient healthy control , schizotypal borderline patient across drug dos placebo administration . Furthermore , 30 subject ( 10 HC , 10 SPD , 10 BPD , either new subject already enrolled subject ) expect complete add-on MRI component study , sign additional consent form . For MRI portion study , subject perform 2 round social cognition test receive double-blind intranasal oxytocin ( 40 IU ) placebo randomize order , cross-over , within-subjects design , separate approximately 1-week washout.The subject receive study medication fMRI scan .</detailed_description>
