	<brief_summary>An effective vaccine malaria urgently need combat scourge disease . Before candidate vaccine test endemic country , first test human volunteer so-called Controlled Human Malaria Infections ( CHMI 's ) . Ideally , candidate vaccine test multiple strain malaria , representative disease 's global distribution . Recently compare , first time , infection novel malaria strain NF135 NF166 broadly-used well-characterised strain NF54 . The purpose current study optimise course infection novel strain determine minimum number infectious bite necessary reliably induce malaria infection .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Controlled Human Malaria Infection After Bites From Mosquitoes Infected With Two Novel P. Falciparum Strains</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Plasmodium falciparum ( Pf ) malaria remain responsible intolerable burden morbidity worldwide effective vaccine sorely need aid control effort . Before candidate malaria vaccine enter full-scale ( phase IIb ) field trial endemic area , must first test controlled circumstance ( phase IIa ) Controlled Human Malaria Infection ( CHMI ) study . Since Pf isolate display wide genetic diversity across globe , phase IIa challenge infection conduct homologous heterologous strain . Since 1998 highly successful Controlled Human Malaria Infection model UMC St Radboud , Nijmegen , The Netherlands , employ test candidate vaccine answer fundamental question pathophysiological immunological mechanism early Pf infection human volunteer . To date largely NF54 strain P. falciparum use Nijmegen model , extensive experience meanwhile acquire . In order increase portfolio Pf strain available future phase IIa study , recently compare NF54 novel candidate strain NF135.C10 NF166.C8 regard parasitological , clinical immunological characteristic Controlled Human Malaria Infection ( TIP3 study , NCT01627951 ) . The pre-patent period NF135- NF166-infected subject markedly short NF54-infected subject , follow bite 5 infected mosquito subject . The current study therefore ass whether NF135 NF166 infection still reliably induce few 5 infected bite per subject . This envisionably increase tolerability NF135 NF166 infection render dynamic similar NF54 infection , good comparison future heterologous challenge study .</detailed_description>
