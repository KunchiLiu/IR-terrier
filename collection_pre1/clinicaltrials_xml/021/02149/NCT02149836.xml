	<brief_summary>The purpose study test antidepressant effect Ezogabine major depressive disorder ( MDD ) . The investigator also aim determine safety tolerability Ezogabine patient MDD . The investigator hypothesize depressive symptom significantly decrease follow 8-week treatment period medication compare baseline .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Study Treat Major Depressive Disorder ( MDD ) With New Medication</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Study Introduction : Major depressive disorder ( MDD ) global health disease associate significant morbidity cost . Many anti-depressants exist within monoaminergic system yet novel therapeutic still need outside system . Ezogabine , currently approve FDA adjunctive treatment partial-onset seizure , may serve potential key agent MDD . Ezogabine know bind activate KCNQ transmembrane K+ ion channel , specifically target KCNQ2 VTA . Such membrane activity show play role previous study involve social defeat model depression . Specifically , data show KCNQ channel upregulated resilient mouse moreover , ezogabine able potentiate KCNQ channel activity result fast reversal depress phenotype . General Investigational Plan : Objectives : A . Primary Efficacy Objective : To test antidepressant effect Ezogabine MDD . B . Primary Safety Objective : To characterize safety tolerability Ezogabine patient MDD . C. Secondary Objectives : To measure effect Ezogabine ventral tegmental area ( VTA ) -striatal reward circuitry MDD use reward task-based functional MRI . Rationale : Ezogabine hypothesize modulate firing rate VTA dopamine ( DA ) neuron thereby influence function mesolimbic reward system . Hypotheses A. Efficacy Hypothesis : Hypothesis 1a : Depressive symptom significantly decrease follow 8-week treatment period compare baseline , measure change Montgomery-Åsberg Depression Rating Scale ( MADRS ) . Hypothesis 1b : The antidepressant response rate study end ( defined 50 % depressive symptom compare baseline ) exceed 50 % , consistent know response rate current antidepressant agent . B . Safety Hypothesis : Ezogabine safe adverse event rate similar rate observe adult population . Specific safety item monitor include frequency intensity adverse event measure Patient Rated Inventory Side Effects ( PRISE ) treatment-emergent suicidal ideation behavior measure Columbia-Suicide Severity Rating Scale ( C-SSRS ) .</detailed_description>
