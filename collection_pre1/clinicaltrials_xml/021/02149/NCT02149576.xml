	<brief_summary>After curative lung cancer surgery , risk recurrence primary cancer , development new cancer . Historically , patient undergo curative lung cancer surgery monitor chest radiograph ( CXR ) . Unfortunately , 70 % patient still die lung cancer . As result , interest method surveillance order detect recur new cancer earlier success treat . One technique Low Dose Computed Tomography ( LDCT ) , currently standard care surveillance institution . This pilot study aim determine whether regiment , intensive , short interval LDCT surveillance lead high rate detection treatment recur lung cancer . The study group follow accord regiment surveillance program use LDCT . The study group compare group historical control whose follow surgery standardize , rather left discretion individual surgeon . If result study show improvement detection treatment recurrent cancer , allow large trial study effect LDCT surveillance program lung cancer survival . The study question aim determine whether survivor curative surgery Stage I Stage II lung cancer , structure Surveillance Program Low Dose CT increase rate detection treatment recur new cancer compare historical non-structured surveillance CXR . This study also determine warrant pursue large scale randomize controlled trial investigate optimal LDCT surveillance follow-up interval long-term lung cancer survival .</brief_summary>
