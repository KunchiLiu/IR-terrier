	<brief_summary>This pilot research trial study response blood cell AMP-514 , drug show increase immune response ( capacity fight infection cancer ) cancer patient solid tumor undergo radiotherapy . Measuring change biomarkers may help doctor decide AMP-514 combined radiotherapy best time combine drug radiation .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Measuring Biomarker Response AMP-514 Blood Samples From Patients With Solid Tumors Undergoing Radiotherapy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To evaluate in-vitro effect AMP-514 , program cell death 1 ( PD-1 ) inhibitor , peripheral blood T cell proliferation cytokine production patient solid malignancy , treat radiotherapy ( RT ) . OUTLINE : Patients undergo blood sample collection baseline , second week RT , end RT , 1 month end RT .</detailed_description>
	<criteria>1 . Patients 18 year age old 2 . Histological diagnosis solid malignancy candidate treat RT ( without chemotherapy ) . Patients synchronous primary solid malignancy eligible . When risk associate diagnostic procedure high , due different clinical reason ( e.g. , severe chronic obstructive lung disease [ COPD ] CTguided biopsy associate high risk pneumothorax ) , biopsy feasible , patient may enrol study per PI judgment . 3 . ECOG performance status score 03 . 4 . Life expectancy 3 month longer . 5 . Patients able provide write informed consent prior study entry . 1 . Patients contraindication RT . 2 . Major surgery within 1 month start study treatment . 3 . Prior chemotherapy radiotherapy solid malignancy . 4 . Known human immunodeficiency virus ( HIV ) infection acquire immunodeficiency syndrome ( AIDS ) relate illness active infection . 5 . Active infection hepatitis B hepatitis C ( blood testing require purpose eligibility ) . 6 . Patients exclude history malignancy patient diseasefree less 2 year , exception adequately treat basal squamous cell carcinoma skin , superficial bladder cancer carcinoma situ cervix , AJCC ( version 7.0 ) stage 0 I breast cancer , AJCC ( version 7.0 ) stage I , II prostate cancer . 7 . Patients exclude history autoimmune disease , follow : Patients history inflammatory bowel disease exclude study patient history symptomatic disease ( e.g. , rheumatoid arthritis , systemic progressive sclerosis [ scleroderma ] , Systemic Lupus Erythematosus , autoimmune vasculitis [ e.g. , Wegener 's Granulomatosis ] ) . Patients motor neuropathy consider autoimmune origin ( e.g. , GuillainBarre Syndrome Myasthenia Gravis ) exclude . Patients history autoimmune thyroiditis eligible current thyroid disorder treat stable replacement medical therapy . 8 . Other severe acute chronic medical psychiatric condition may increase risk associate study participation judgment investigator would make subject inappropriate entry study .</criteria>
