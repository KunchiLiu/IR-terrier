	<brief_summary>Buruli ulcer neglect tropical disease cause infection Mycobacterium ulcerans ( Mu ) rural part West Africa . It cause large skin ulcer mainly child age 5 15 year . Access treatment limit many case present late . There major advance understand mechanism disease together improve diagnosis management . The aim propose study identify marker predictive rapid response antibiotic treatment investigate pathogenesis paradoxical reaction oedematous lesion Mu disease . Infection Mu result nodule skin enlarges break form ulcer . This Mu produce toxin spread outwards damage subcutaneous tissue . In recent year find antibiotic treatment 8 week daily tablet intramuscular injection heals ulcer . This unpleasant would better treatment could shorten . Our previous study suggest may possible . Therefore wide range test investigate order identify marker people infection early stage low number Mu bacteria low level toxin skin . During antibiotic treatment rate healing measure find marker reliable . In patient new area inflammation develop despite treatment call paradoxical reaction . The immune response Mu investigate serially antibiotic treatment investigate cause paradoxical reaction . About 15 % patient oedematous disease , severe form Buruli ulcer . We study amount Mu toxin produce strain Mu culture patient form disease . Hypothesis - Buruli ulcer patient heal rapidly/slowly develop paradoxical reaction treatment associate predictive viability serum biomarkers . - Buruli ulcer patient oedematous disease associate large amount mycolactone viable organism</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Procedures Infected Participants After collection demographic data use standard World Health Organisation form ( BU01 ) together careful history establish early lesion ( nodule , plaque ulcer ) first observe , type dimension lesion document together digital photograph tracing onto acetate sheet . For oedematous lesion digital photograph obtain . Patients review 2 weekly interval standard antibiotic treatment ( rifampicin 10mg/kg streptomycin 15mg/kg ) recording clinical data do routine patient . These measurement enable calculation rate heal heal time relation lesion size type . Patients monitor paradoxical reaction occur start treatment 8 % patient . These procedure routinely provide part routine care Buruli ulcer patient . Samples The additional sample require patient study extra volume blood ( 7ml ) 3 swab take occasion ( baseline , week 4 , 8 , 12 16 ) patient lesion time point . Swabs/fine needle aspirate require determine organism detect polymerase chain reaction ( PCR ) still viable , one M. ulcerans culture , one measurement mycolactone concentration , one combine 16S ribosomal ribonucleic acid ( rRNA ) reverse transcriptase / insertion sequence IS2404 Real-Time qPCR assay ( 1 ) . For patient develop paradoxical lesion therapy additional blood sample 3 swabs/fine needle aspirate obtain time reaction viability marker ( M. ulcerans culture , combine 16S rRNA reverse transcriptase / IS2404 Real-Time quantitative polymerase chain reaction ( qPCR ) assay mycolactone detection ) . For oedematous lesion , one swab/fine needle aspirate obtain mycolactone detection quantification lesion ulcerate . A 3 mm punch biopsy perform local anaesthetic non-ulcerated lesion purpose patient 15 year old . Established practice routine diagnosis M. ulcerans infection take fine needle aspirate non-ulcerated lesion acid-fast bacillus ( AFB ) detection , culture PCR IS2404 . This specimen large enough mycolactone quantification , important part investigation pathogenesis oedematous disease often present without ulceration . Swabs use diagnosis ulcer . Controls For household contact patient endemic village healthy control non-endemic village 7ml blood sample obtain investigate protein biomarkers Luminex assay , T cell subset flow cytometry immune response use Enzyme Linked Immunosorbent Assay ( ELISA ) whole blood assay comparative study . No tissue biopsies take . Definition paradoxical reaction Paradoxical reaction define increase inflammatory change increase lesion size great 100 % , initial improvement decrease size ; and/or appearance new lesion follow antimycobacterial treatment . Investigations Detection rapid responder : Biomarkers , tissue mycolactone concentration immune response measure baseline . The rate healing estimate document initial size lesion time complete heal previously ( 2 ) . Detection Mu : Swabs homogenates inoculate onto Lowenstein Jensen slop culture microscopy carry Ziehl-Neelsen stain smear AFB . PCR IS2404 carry describe previously ( 3 ) . Biomarkers : Serum sample subject multi-analyte profiling use Luminex multianalyte profile identify marker oedematous disease , paradoxical reaction rapid responder . We also use mass spectrometry-based proteomics generate additional serum/tissue biomarkers take three-stage approach . First use sample fractionation mass spectrometry ( matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionisation/time flight/mass spectrometry ) determine degree variability proteomic composition sample subject treat antibiotic . This first screen allow identification removal subject show partial response subsequent analysis show disparate response . Stage 2 comprises deep liquid chromatography mass spectrometry ( LC/MS/MS ) -based quantitative analysis pool sample ( 3 pool generate randomly response cohort ) identify response group . Molecules show significant change consider candidate biomarkers drug response . In Stage 3 immunoassay ( ELISA ) develop order test validity novel biomarker ability separately combination exist biomarkers predict drug response . Immune response : Whole blood sample incubate Mu antigen overnight 37 degree celsius supernate store cytokine assay use ELISA previous study ( 4 ) . Antigen stimulate T cell population also study flow cytometry assess proportion Interferon ( IFN ) gamma , Tumor necrosis factor ( TNF ) interleukin-2 ( IL2 ) secrete T cell patient compare control . Mycolactone detection : Lipids extract homogenised skin biopsy swabs//fine needle aspirate biological activity mycolactone measure cytotoxicity assay describe previously use human embryonic lung fibroblast target cell . The presence mycolactone tissue sample confirm quantified mass spectrometry previously describe ( 5 ) . Mycolactone production strain Mu isolate oedematous lesion quantify vitro tissue concentration mycolactone oedematous lesion measure . Sample size justification There 450 participant study . Our previous study show mean difference TNF alpha baseline fast slow responder 15pg/ml standard deviation 33pg/ml . The standardized mean difference compute d=15/33 0.45 . The sample size require detect difference two-sided significance 5 % 80 % power would 100 participant group ( 200 patient ) . We expect attrition rate 20 % bring sample size 250 patient . There control group 200 healthy volunteer Statistical analysis For purpose study `` rapid responder fast responder '' define patient time heal less 12 week rate heal great 4mm/week `` slow responder slow healer '' define patient time heal 12 week rate heal less 3 mm/week Data generate multianalyte profile analyzed multivariate analysis , include principal component analysis ( PCA ) partial least-squares ( PLS ) -related method , use SIMCA 13 software ( Umetrics , Sweden ) . Univariate analyse perform characterize candidate biomarkers . Here , difference control disease patient analyze use non-parametric Wilcoxon rank sum ( Mann-Whitney ) test . Paired sample BUD patient week 0 week 12 compare use Wilcoxon sign rank test . Univariate analysis multiple test adjustment perform use R software ( version 2.13.2 , R Development Core Team , R Foundation Statistical Computing , Vienna , Austria ) package QVALUE . GraphPad Prism software use graphical representation .</detailed_description>
