	<brief_summary>Background : - Neuromuscular disease ( NMDs ) cure . But future treatment try improve health-related quality life ( HRQoL ) people NMD . Computer questionnaires help test HRQoL people NMD . They could help clinician researcher know people NMD caregiver . They could also help show treatment make difference . Researchers want make sure two questionnaire PROMIS ( Patient Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System ) Neuro-QOL ( Quality Life Neurological Disorders ) work way every time . They also want make sure questionnaire test thing every time . Objective : - To make sure PROMIS Neuro-QOL questionnaire valid . Eligibility : - Children age 8 17 NMD . Also , caregiver child age 5 17 NMD . Design : - Participants complete PROMIS Neuro-QOL questionnaires computer . The caregiver child version . - Participants complete questionnaire begin study . It take 15 20 minute . They complete questionnaire 2 4 week . They may receive phone email reminder . - Participants complete questionnaire NIH outpatient clinic and/or device . At NIH , use computer tablet .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Health-related quality life ( HRQoL ) define individual perception well-being satisfaction current circumstance . As oftentimes case , childhood-onset neuromuscular disease ( NMD ) cerebral palsy ( CP ) , definitive cure currently exist . As result , primary goal treatment patient population improve quality life , specifically , HRQoL . The medical community interest patient-based outcome HRQoL increase last two decade allow multidimensional consideration patient health . This focus impetus development computerize adaptive testing ( CAT ) instrument Quality Life Neurological Disorders ( Neuro-QOL ) Patient Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System ( PROMIS ) provide mean assess quality life patient population chronic disease , neuromuscular disease cerebral palsy . The objective study thus validate PROMIS Neuro-QOL scale pediatric domain self-assessment individual CP NMD PROMIS proxy domains proxy-assessment population . The questionnaire administer combined total 650 individual two site order also calibrate item convert questionnaire CAT format . The study population patient CP NMD , age 8-17 year , caregiver patient CP NMD , whose child age 5-17 year . Caregivers define study parent legal guardian child . &lt; TAB &gt; The design prospective study patient caregiver complete online version PROMIS Neuro-QOL questionnaires one two different site . &lt; TAB &gt; The outcome measure responses questionnaire . &lt; TAB &gt; The validation self-report proxy-report questionnaire use pediatric population childhood-onset disease , specifically CP NMD , serve adjunct clinical exam provide way clinician researcher track effectiveness regular care surgical intervention population . The ultimate goal produce reliable , validated assessment HRQoL population via CAT test format potential use tool inform clinical decision-making research effort patient .</detailed_description>
