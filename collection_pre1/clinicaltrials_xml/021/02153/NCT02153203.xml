The result study allow examination whether PTR effective acceptable model reduce problem behavior home population . Given problem behavior incur high societal cost persist adolescence adulthood , study may potentially lead large cost reduction treatment difficulty associate autism spectrum disorder . By reduce engagement problem behavior , implementation model may also promote facilitate social participation well improve quality life health child autism spectrum disorder family .</brief_summary>
