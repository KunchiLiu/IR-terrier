	<brief_summary>Background : - Being overweight may cause low-level inflammation . This inflammation may cause medical problem obesity , like high blood sugar ( diabetes ) heart disease . This study test whether medication call colchicine improve metabolism adult overweight yet develop diabetes . Objectives : - To learn whether colchicine improve sugar regulation metabolism . Eligibility : - Healthy overweight adult least 18to 100 year old . Design : - Participants must fast visit , include screen visit . - Participants screen blood test , urine test , medical history , physical exam . They drink sugar water , blood drawn find healthy . - For visit 1 , participant medical history physical exam answer question . They blood take intravenous ( IV ) line , give urine sample , give 2 stool samples.. - Also , subject get sugar water one IV . Blood drawn . This measure sugar insulin level . During , participant lie bed watch TV . - Participants full-body X-ray , lie table camera pass . They also abdominal CT scan , lie table move ring take picture . - Participants small fat tissue sample take abdomen . It like get mini-liposuction . - Participants give study drug placebo . They take twice daily 3 month . - For visit 2 , participant blood test , urine test , medical history , physical exam . - For visit 3 , participant repeat test visit 1 .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Effects Colchicine Non-Diabetic Adults With Metabolic Syndrome</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Obesity affect one-third adult U.S. population major risk factor development type 2 diabetes cardiovascular disease . Mouse model human data suggest obesity-induced chronic inflammation one mechanism promote obesity-associated comorbid condition . In obesity , innate immunity activate circulate molecule fatty acid cholesterol crystal bind nucleotide-binding oligomerization ( NOD ) -like receptor family , pyrin domain contain 3 ( NLRP3 ) receptor adipocyte tissue macrophage ( ATMs ) . This binding stimulate NLRP3 oligomerization , inflammasome formation , proinflammatory cytokine activation . The resultant inflammatory cascade lead insulin resistance decrease pancreatic beta-cell reserve . It propose suppression chronic low-level inflammatory state may impede onset diabetes cardiovascular disease . Recent study show colchicine , potent microtubule inhibitor commonly use treatment gout rare inflammatory condition , disrupts intracellular localization NLRP3 , thereby block inflammasome assembly . As limited medical therapy proven effective improve obesity-related metabolic dysregulation , propose determine efficacy colchicine 0.6 mg twice daily non-diabetic obese adult metabolic syndrome . We conduct randomize , double-blinded , placebo-controlled pilot trial colchicine forty subject . We study change insulin resistance , beta-cell reserve , systemic inflammation . Using adipose tissue obtain biopsy , also study colchicine local effect inflammation insulin resistance . Should result prove promising , pilot study allow determination sample size need adequately power study effect colchicine obese adult metabolic syndrome . 5 patient diet-controlled type 2 diabetes give open-label colchicine follow describe . We also plan perform baseline evaluation 40 subject eligible treatment protocol . This group consist non-obese adult , obese adult insulin-resistant , adults diet-controlled type 2 diabetes .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>INCLUSION CRITERIA FOR SUBJECTS RANDOMIZED TO COLCHICINE PLACEBO : : Subjects qualify randomization colchicine placebo meet follow criterion : Good general health . In general subject take medication . However , individual take medication obesityrelated comorbid condition , change dosage 3 month , may include , discretion principal investigator . Obesity , define body mass index ( BMI ) great equal 30 kg/m^2 , weight less 450 lbs order subject undergo DualEnergy Xray Absorptiometry ( DXA ) scanning . Age great equal 18 100 year . Metabolic Syndrome ( Any 3 follow 5 ) : FPG great equal 100 mg/dl , Impaired Glucose Tolerance ( Glucose great equal 140 mg/dl 2 hour OGTT ) Triglycerides great equal 150 mg/dl , treatment Waist Circumference : Men great equal 40 ( great equal 102 cm ) ; Women great equal 35 ( great equal 88 cm ) Reduced HDLC : Men &lt; 40 mg/dl ; Women &lt; 50 mg/dl , treatment Hypertension : great equal 130 mmHg systolic , great equal 85 mmHg diastolic , treatment HOMAIR great equal 2.6 . Our goal enroll participant preexist insulin resistance . hsCRP great equal 2.0 mg/L . We aim recruit participant increase baseline level inflammation . Individuals hsCRP 2.0 mg/L show increased risk cardiovascular event . EXCLUSION CRITERIA FOR SUBJECTS RANDOMIZED TO COLCHICINE OR PLACEBO : Type 2 diabetes mellitus , determine either : Clear clinical diagnosis diabetes , patient hyperglycemic crisis classic symptom hyperglycemia random plasma glucose great equal 200 mg/dL Two follow three : Fasting plasma glucose great equal 126 mg/dL Hemoglobin A1c great equal 6.5 % An oral glucose tolerance test glucose concentration great equal 200 mg/dL 2 hour . One three criterion ( bi.biii . ) meeting T2DM cutoff two different day . If one three criterion ( bi.biii . ) meet T2DM threshold Screening Visit , test repeat another day determine subject T2DM . As per ADA guideline , The diagnosis [ T2DM ] make basis confirm test.Moreover , HbA1c show high African Americans ( AA ) compare race glycemia , nondiabetic AA may unfairly exclude HbA1c alone . Therefore , AA subject , 2 hour OGTT fasting glucose nondiabetic range , HbA1c &lt; 7.0 % , consider nondiabetic .
