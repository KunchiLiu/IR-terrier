Stereotactic radiosurgery may able send x-ray directly tumor cause less damage normal tissue . Metformin hydrochloride , use diabetes , may also kill cancer cell demonstrate laboratory study . Giving stereotactic radiosurgery metformin hydrochloride may kill tumor cell .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Stereotactic Radiosurgery Metformin Hydrochloride Treating Patients With Borderline-Resectable Locally-Advanced Pancreatic Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This open label pilot , single-center , non-randomized trial design evaluate tolerability preliminary activity combination stereotactic body radiation therapy ( SBRT ) metformin resectable locally-advanced pancreatic/periampullary cancer . PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I. determine addition metformin SBRT add minimal additional toxicity patient A ) . borderline-resectable B ) . locally-advanced pancreatic adenocarcinoma . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . Evaluate clinical/pathological response resectability rate associate regimen . OUTLINE : Patients receive metformin hydrochloride orally ( PO ) daily twice daily ( BID ) day -11 -1 . Patients undergo stereotactic radiosurgery 5 day week 5 week receive concurrent metformin hydrochloride* PO BID 5 week . Patients undergo laparotomy week 6 ( week 5-7 ) . ) . Systemic therapy continue soon consider feasible treat physician . *NOTE : Metformin hydrochloride stop 2 day laparotomy . After completion study treatment , patient follow every 3 month 2 year .</detailed_description>
