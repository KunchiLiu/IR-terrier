	<brief_title>An Investigation Dexamethasone With Different Doses Management Immune Thrombocytopenia ( ITP )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The investigator undertake parallel group , multicentre , randomise control trial 60 adult ITP 7 medical center China . Part participants randomly select receive dexamethasone ( give dose 40mg per day 4 consecutive day ) , others select receive dexamethasone ( give dose 20 mg daily 4 day ) . Platelet count , bleed symptom evaluate treatment . Adverse event also record throughout study . In order report efficacy safety different dose dexamethasone treatment adult immune thrombocytopenia ( ITP ) .</detailed_description>
