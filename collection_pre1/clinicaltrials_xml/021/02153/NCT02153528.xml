	<brief_summary>- Hypothesis : Double dose rifampicin together earlier monitor sputum conversion use vital staining reduces unfavorable outcome Cat . 1 first-line TB treatment without excess serious toxicity , allow early switch specific treatment MDR-TB without use Cat . 2 retreatment regimen - General study design : This open label , randomise clinical trial intend pilot study efficacy safety high-dose rifampicin feasibility add value auramine and/or FDA vital stain sputum smear 2 week intensive treatment phase . If proof-of-concept study provide substantial indication benefit without indication excess toxicity , data study use design large scale , cluster-randomized study . The aim cluster randomise study would provide definite proof benefit intervention adverse treatment outcome lack excess toxicity associate high dose rifampicin . In addition , cluster-randomized study would provide precise assessment suppression prevention ( acquire ) resistance endpoint . An interim analysis thus plan time last recruited patient finish treatment , i.e . 9 month end recruitment . It focus assessment drug toxicity versus suggest benefit intervention . This analysis primarily perform go/no-go decision design consideration cluster-randomized trial . The decision proceed cluster randomize study base absence excess toxicity , trend toward reduction unfavourable outcome ( exclude relapse ) , possible favourable effect initially present low-resistance mutation / mutation acquire treatment . It also allow adapt design large study particularly regard algorithm resistance screening , whether treatment shortening could justify rapid initial conversion .</brief_summary>
