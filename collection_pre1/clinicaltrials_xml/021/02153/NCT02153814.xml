	<brief_summary>Infertility affect 1 7 couple worldwide . The successful treatment vitro fertilization ( IVF ) , procedure woman 's egg collect fertilized sperm make embryo , place woman 's uterus use small catheter , procedure call `` embryo transfer . '' Unfortunately , pregnancy rate IVF le 50 % . Recently , several study show dramatically improved pregnancy rate graze innermost lining uterus ( endometrium ) small flexible catheter week prior embryo transfer . These study perform outside United States ( U.S. ) woman multiple fail IVF attempt investigate mechanism endometrial injury work . This study first evaluate effect endometrial injury IVF success woman undergo IVF , include first IVF cycle , frozen embryo transfer , donor egg .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Endometrial Injury Vitro Fertilization Outcomes</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Nationally , percentage vitro fertilization ( IVF ) cycle result pregnancy still less 50 % , even optimal patient . While failed implantation may due embryo factor , recent year much attention give role endometrial receptivity time embryo transfer . There abundant evidence literature showing , woman repeat implantation failure despite high quality embryo , endometrial injury perform either follicular phase IVF cycle late cycle precede treatment cycle increase IVF success rate , often double pregnancy rate . The mechanism improved pregnancy rate endometrial injury currently unknown . There paucity study current literature link biochemical genetic change induce endometrial injury pregnancy rate patient undergoing IVF , well study examine effect endometrial injury ultrasound finding previously show predict IVF success , endometrial thickness , pattern , volume , marker endometrial vascularity . Additionally , study publish examine whether IVF success rate improve all-comers ( woman repeat failure abnormal appear endometrium ultrasound ) perform endometrial injury currently study publish topic U.S. woman study population . The propose study would first examine effect endometrial injury U.S. woman undergo infertility treatment IVF , regardless prior treatment history , include woman undergo donor oocyte IVF cycle freeze embryo transfer . It would also first evaluate biochemical change induce endometrial injury context cycle outcome live birth rate examine effect ultrasound parameter .</detailed_description>
