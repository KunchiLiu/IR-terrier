	<brief_title>Cellular Immunotherapy Following Chemotherapy Treating Patients With Recurrent Non-Hodgkin Lymphomas , Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia B-Cell Prolymphocytic Leukemia</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To assess safety adoptive therapy use ex vivo expand autologous central memory T cell ( Tcm ) enrich genetically modify express cluster differentiation ( CD ) 19-specific , hinge optimize , CD28-costimulatory chimeric antigen receptor ( CAR ) well truncate human epidermal growth factor receptor ( EGFR ) ( CD19R [ EQ ] 28zeta/truncated EGFR [ EGFRt ] + Tcm ) shortly follow lymphodepletion adult recurrent/progressive/residual CD19 + B-cell lymphoproliferative neoplasm ( stratum 1 : non-Hodgkin lymphoma [ NHL ] , stratum 2 : chronic lymphocytic leukemia [ CLL ] /prolymphocytic leukemia [ PLL ] ) eligible decline City Hope ( COH ) Institutional Review Board ( IRB ) Protocol Number ( No . ) 13277 . II . To determine recommended Phase II dose ( RP2D ) . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . To study antitumor activity CD19R ( EQ ) CD28zeta/EGFRt+Tcm ( e.g. , detection Tcm , B cell , tumor burden ) . OUTLINE : This dose-escalation study autologous CD19CAR-CD28-CD3zeta-EGFRt-expressing Tcm-enriched T cell ( T-cell infusion ) . LYMPHODEPLETING REGIMEN : Patients receive chemotherapy regimen base disease type extent disease comprising : cyclophosphamide intravenously ( IV ) day -4 and/or -3 ; OR bendamustine hydrochloride IV day -4 -3 ; OR fludarabine phosphate IV cyclophosphamide IV day -5 -3 ; OR etoposide IV cyclophosphamide IV day -5 -3 ; OR cyclophosphamide IV day -7 -6 follow etoposide IV day -5 -3 . CELLULAR IMMUNOTHERAPY : Beginning 3-10 day later lymphodepletion , patient receive autologous CD19CAR-CD28-CD3zeta-EGFRt-expressing Tcm-enriched T cell IV 10-15 minute day 0 . Patients relapse , residual progressive disease may receive optional second infusion autologous CD19CAR-CD28-CD3zeta-EGFRt-expressing Tcm-enriched T cell &gt; = 28 day post T cell infusion . After completion study treatment , patient follow every 2 day 14 day , weekly 1 month , monthly 1 year , yearly least 15 year</detailed_description>
