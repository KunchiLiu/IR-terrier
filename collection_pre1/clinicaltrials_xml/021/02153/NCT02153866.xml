	<brief_summary>Nowadays vaccine vaccinate simultaneously , doubt arouse safety immunogenicity inoculate several vaccine simultaneously inoculate individually . So carry study . The purpose study evaluate difference safety immunogenicity vaccinate rotavirus vaccine simultaneously measles-rubella vaccine ( MR ) measles-mumps-rubella vaccine ( MMR ) compare vaccinate rotavirus vaccine , MR MMR individually .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>The Safety Immunogenicity Study Rotavirus Vaccine Simultaneously Vaccinated With MR MMR Vaccine</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>1 . Quality control plan : 1 . All vaccinator get professional training hold local Health Bureau , qualify local Health Bureau . 2 . All clinical trial related staff train provincial prefectural Center Disease Control prevention ( CDC ) begin . 3 . Provincial prefectural CDCs conduct supervision step , especially field vaccination Adverse Events Following Immunization ( AEFI ) investigation . 4 . Data valid check design work database inputting , double entry validation also require . 5 . The field work conduct SOP ( Standard Operating Procedures ) , The SOP vaccination procedure include vaccinee recruitment vaccination practice etc . 'Immunization Work Specification ' issued China Ministry Health 2005 . The SOP AEFI surveillance 'AEFI surveillance guideline ' issue China Ministry Health 2010 . 2 . Statistical plan 1 . Safety evaluation The analytic data include reaction event within 30 day vaccination , compare incidence reaction among different vaccine , statistical method chi-square . 2 . Immunogenicity evaluation Compare antibody positive rate Geometric Mean Concentration pre-vaccination post-vaccination , among different vaccine combination . 3. safety evaluation method At time vaccination , vaccinee instruct report adverse event physician vaccination provider . Adverse event fatal result disability cluster event ( i.e. , notably high number similar adverse event related certain vaccine ) require report within 2 hour occurrence . The following adverse event require report within 2 day occurrence : anaphylaxis allergic reaction occur within 24 hour vaccination ; fever ( axillary temperature , &gt; 38.5°C ) , angioedema , local injection-site reaction ( diameter , &gt; 2.5 cm ) occur within 5 day vaccination ; purpura , Arthus reaction , febrile convulsion , seizure , polyneuritis occur within 15 day vaccination . Other reaction common minor ( e.g. , mild pain fatigue ) require report . 4 . Immunogenicity evaluation Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay ( abbreviated ELSIA ) use quantitatively test immunoglobulin G ( IgG ) measles , rubella , mumps , test kit provide Virion\Serion company . Rotavirus Immunoglobulin A ( RV-IgA ) use test antibody rotavirus .</detailed_description>
