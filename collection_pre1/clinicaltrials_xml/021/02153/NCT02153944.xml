	<brief_summary>Background : Stress anxiety interfere well people perform task . But perform task sometimes lessen anxiety distract people stress . Researchers want examine interaction attention stress . They use two drug different effect stress concentration . Objective : - To good understand think emotion affect anxiety performance . Also , study effect methylphenidate propranolol performance . Eligibility : - Adults age 18 50 . Design : - First , participant screen test hear loud , sudden noise headphone . Sticky pad electrode place skin one eye . These electrode tell u sensitive participant noise . - Second , participant complete questionnaire mood , thinking , anxiety . They give saliva sample . For , cotton swab place mouth 2 minute . - Third , participant take single dose one study pill placebo . They look word , shape , letter computer monitor . They answer question remember . They may receive shock hear loud noise test . - For shock , small metal disk sticky pad electrode tap wrist finger . For record bodily response , additional electrode place arm , body , eye . - Blood pressure pulse measure test . More saliva sample take . - At end study , participant answer question reaction study test effect notice study pill . - After experiment , participant evaluate effect study pill .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Cognitive v . Emotional Psychopharmacological Manipulations Fear vs. Anxiety</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Objective : The overall aim protocol examine effect pharmacological manipulation affective cognitive process anxiety task performance . Ultimately , goal 1 ) provide insight relative influence cognitive affective state anxiety , 2 ) generate theoretical model apply well understanding interaction cognition emotion , 3 ) develop well screen approach candidate anxiolytic , 4 ) help formulate novel therapeutic intervention clinical anxiety . Excessive inappropriately sustain anxiety fear lead common group psychiatric disorder . A number theoretical model propose understand mechanism engage maladaptive behavior . Most recent emphasis focus synergistic contribution cognitive emotional process . Our laboratory instrumental delineating aspect behavioral neural process associate fear anxiety , use psychophysiological neuroimaging measure fear anxiety . Evidence show level anxiety modulate cognitive performance , work memory perceptual discrimination , , conversely , cognitive engagement influence severity experimentally induced anxiety . The exact contribution emotional process vs. cognitive process experience anxiety clear , similarly neural mechanism underlie interaction . In protocol , propose manipulate pharmacologically separately cognitive emotional process dissociate contribution fear/anxiety , use state-of-the-art measure anxiety derive translational work . Indeed , already develop integrative experimental model fear anxiety via manipulation predictable unpredictable shock , respectively . We already employ successfully model measure anxiolytic anxiogenic effect various compound alprazolam , citalopram , hydrocortisone , oxytocin healthy participant . We propose first step ( step-1 ) start simple proof-of-concept study , use two pharmacological compound double-blind randomized parallel design , preferentially act respectively cognitive ( methylphenidate ) affective ( propranolol ) domain , use single cognitive process ( work memory ) . In second step ( step-2 ) , propose extend work fMRI examine cognitive correlate effect see step-1 behavioral study , specifically methylphenidate . Whereas comparison among three drug plan electrophysiology study , plan study drug improves cognition fMRI . The reason focus methylphenidate step 2 overall goal study effect improve cognitive function anxiety use neuroimaging . To reach goal , plan use different approach boost cognitive function come year , include psychopharmacology , direct current stimulation , mindfulness . Methylphenidate first psychopharmacological study towards objective.. Future work also expand compound cognitive process , well vary strategy induce anxiety . Presently , anxiety induce use threat shock , participant perform task . We examine step-1 whether 1 ) reduction induced-anxiety propranolol improve cognitive performance , 2 ) facilitation cognitive performance methylphenidate reduce induced-anxiety . In step-2 , identify neural mechanism underlie effect methylphenidate , drug beneficial effect cognitive function . Study population : Medically psychiatrically healthy adult male female , age 18 50 year . Design : The study double-blind design . For step-1 , three group healthy participant come one experimental session . During session , ask perform work memory task threat shock , i.e. , anticipate unpleasant electric shock . Each group receive one drug challenge , either placebo , propranolol ( 40 g ) methylphenidate ( 20 mg ) . For step-2 , study task conduct 3T fMRI scanner . In step , methylphenidate placebo compare . Two group come one experimental session , one receive placebo one receive methylphenidate ( 20 mg ) . Outcome measure : In step-1 , primary outcome measure startle reflex performance work memory task . In step-2 , primary outcome measure startle reflex cerebral fMRI blood-oxygen-level dependent ( BOLD ) responses . For step-1 step-2 , secondary measure include skin conductance , heart rate , subjective measure anxiety , well salivary measure alpha-amylase , cortisol .</detailed_description>
