	<criteria>Age &gt; 18 year Subjects severe symptomatic functional mitral regurgitation ≥ 3+ secondary leave ventricular ( LV ) remodel and/or annular remodeling , measure accordance current ASE guideline suitable treatment accordance current AHA/ACC guideline : Left ventricular ejection fraction ( LVEF ) ≥ 20 % ≤ 40 % Stable cardiac medical regimen heart failure least 1 month Stable NYHA Classification ( Class III ) least 1 month The subject inform nature study , agree provision , include possibility conversion surgery , provide write informed consent . Candidates exclude study follow condition present : Myocardial infarction within 90 day intend treatment device Prior surgical , transcatheter , percutaneous mitral valve intervention mitral valve prosthesis Subject untreated coronary artery disease , opinion treat physician and/or heart team , clinically significant require revascularization Nonambulatory NYHA Class IV symptom heart failure subject cardiogenic shock hemodynamic instability require IV inotropic support mechanical support device Subject need emergent surgery reason Subjects sufficient quality echocardiography ( TTE TEE ) obtain Echocardiography evidence primary mitral valve disease cause MR MS ; Moderate severe pulmonary hypertension ( PA systolic pressure ≥ 80 mm Hg ) assess echocardiography Evidence mitral valve stenosis estimate valve area le 3.5 cm2 Mitral valve pathology would prevent adequate function GDS Accucinch System Subject dialysis estimate GFR &lt; 30mL/min/1.73m2 ( CockcroftGault Formula ) Israni AK , et al . Laboratory Assessment Kidney Disease , Brenner Rector 's The Kidney , 9th ed . chapter 25 Greater mild mitral annular calcification observe fluoroscopy Presence aortic valve prosthesis Moderate severe aortic valve stenosis calcification observe echocardiography fluoroscopy Severe aortic arch calcification mobile aortic atheroma observe echocardiography fluoroscopy Active bacterial endocarditis active sepsis History bleed diathesis coagulopathy History stroke within prior 6 month Subjects anticoagulation contraindicate Any clinical evidence investigator feel would place subject increase risk placement device Concurrent medical condition life expectancy le 12 month Currently participate another investigational drug device study reach primary endpoint Comorbid condition place subject unacceptable surgical risk ( e.g . severe chronic obstructive pulmonary disease , hepatic failure , immunological abnormality , hematological abnormality ) Subject indication concomitant surgery coronary artery bypass graft ( CABG ) , aortic valve reconstruction replacement , leave ventricular remodel surgery congenital repair Any cardiac resynchronization therapy within last 9 month prior treatment Subject high dose steroid immunosuppressant therapy Current problem substance abuse ( e.g . alcohol , illegal drug , etc . ) Female subject pregnant , lactating , plan pregnancy within next 36 month . Note : Childbearing age instruct use safe contraception participation study . Subjects unable unwilling comply followup schedule requirement Subject know hypersensitivity contrast agent adequately premedicated know hypersensitivity study require medication , nickel , polyurethanes Femoral artery lumen diameter &lt; 5.5 mm , severe iliofemoral tortuosity calcification would prevent safe placement 16Fr introducer sheath</criteria>
