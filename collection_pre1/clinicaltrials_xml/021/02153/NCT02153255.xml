	<brief_summary>Mucopolysaccharidosis Type IVa ( MPS IVa , Morquio Disease ) rare inherit lysosomal storage disorder cause deficiency enzyme galactose-6-sulfatase . Children disease accumulate chemical call keratan sulphate , stops skeleton develop properly . They short stature many joint unstable . Children MPS IVa walk different way people due combination lax ligament skeletal problem knock-knee . Human walk involves coordinate movement four limb . As walk , arm swing oppositely legs . This movement pattern different child MPS IVa . This change seem involve whole musculoskeletal system depend severity disease . Recent study child MPS IVa describe walk pattern concentrate solely low upper limb respectively , look interaction upper low limb walk . To knowledge , mechanic walk child MPS IVa investigate use dynamic gait analysis tool ( use camera , sensor electrodes track movement different part body walk ) aim characterise small number child MPS IVa also examine effect splint wrist upon walk pattern see simple intervention make easier difficult child MPS IVa walk .</brief_summary>
