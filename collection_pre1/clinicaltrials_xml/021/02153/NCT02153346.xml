	<detailed_description>Rationale Asthma chronic inflammatory disorder airway affect person age recognize one common chronic disease . With continuously increase prevalence associate morbidity mortality , asthma pose tremendous clinical economic burden healthcare system society whole . According report publish Global Initiative Asthma ( GINA ) 2004 estimate 300 million people world asthma , 2 million Canadians asthma . Canada one high asthma prevalence rate world ( 8.5 % , age 12 ) major cause hospitalization . The direct indirect cost associate asthma expect rank among high chronic disease due high prevalence conjunction significant healthcare utilization associate disease considerable restriction asthma imposes physical , emotional , social , professional live sufferer . The cost asthma varies dramatically across disease severity , expect cost great condition sub-optimally manage control . Although number publication report economic burden asthma , lack information cost asthma base disease severity level disease control Canada . Moreover , study compare annual cost uncontrolled `` well-controlled '' asthma patient . Although population-level direct cost previously report use administrative healthcare databases various province , database provide clinical data limited subject public drug insurance plan . The propose study aim ) estimate annual indirect cost asthma ii ) impact asthma absenteeism , presenteeism work productivity Canada . This information essential quantify burden asthma patient healthcare system Canadian setting . Overall Objectives The overall objective study describe impact asthma patient moderate severe asthma estimate indirect cost asthma care asthmatic patient follow tertiary clinic specialize field asthma Quebec , Canada . Primary objectives - To estimate annual indirect cost asthma asthmatic patient follow tertiary clinic specialize field asthma Quebec , Canada - To estimate annual indirect cost asthma asthma severity control status ( uncontrolled , partly control , well control ) asthmatic patient follow tertiary clinic specialize field asthma Quebec , Canada Secondary objectives • To determine impact asthma work productivity asthmatic patient follow tertiary clinic specialize field asthma Quebec , Canada . Study Design A prospective cohort study conduct measure indirect economical burden asthma patient . Patients select recruited BD-Asthma registry follow prospectively 1 year . Recruited patient ask complete questionnaire regular interval 1 year measure indirect cost disease , use Valuation lose productivity ( VOLP ) questionnaire . Recruitment patient All eligible patient BD-asthma invited participate . Patients approach participation provide verbal write information project , patient agrees participate , ask sign participation consent form . The form collect research coordination centre ( either clinic physician ' office directly patient ) . All recruit eligible patient provide consent include study . Source Population The population define individual diagnose asthma ( ICD9 cod 493.x ) . Study Population The study population define least one diagnosis asthma ( ICD9 cod 493.x ) record BD Asthma database February 2010 February 2012 . Clinical information Patient characteristics clinical information asthma obtain BD-asthma database . Data Collected For patient , follow data collect - Patient demographic - Age - Sex - Income - Level education - Smoking - Disease management Treatment utilization year prior recruitment - Physician visit follow - Hospitalizations ( number total day ) - Emergency room visit - Disease characteristic - Asthma history - Year first diagnosis asthma severity - Asthma Control Questionnaire score - Lung function measure Data Analysis Methods For participant , percentage time miss work year calculate . We use human capital approach calculate cost asthma due lose productivity , incorporate absenteeism presenteeism calculation productivity loss . We calculate number work day person unable attend workplace , number day percentage time lose day person 's work affect asthma . The fraction time lose work past year multiply average income Quebec . Finally , value multiply coefficient generate VOLP , reflect relative value productivity loss . In addition , calculate VOLP multiplier participant , combine percentage time miss work , create measure productivity loss adjust relative importance replace-ability participant 's profession . Sample Size Power One hundred subject randomly select BD-Asthma registry . Limitations The study population may representative general asthma population , moderate severe asthma represent tertiary center .</detailed_description>
