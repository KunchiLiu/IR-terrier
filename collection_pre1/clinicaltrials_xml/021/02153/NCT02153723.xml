	<brief_summary>A phase 2 open label trial test potential drug treatment Rett syndrome , lead know genetic cause severe neurological impairment girl . The drug , Copaxone ( generic name - Glatiramer acetate ) medication FDA approve treatment multiple sclerosis . Copaxone 's high safety profile document large cohort patient 12 year .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Pharmacological Treatment Rett Syndrome With Glatiramer Acetate ( Copaxone )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Background/rationale study : In Rett syndrome brain cell n't actually lose , instead poor maturation connection brain cell ( synapsis ) prevents effective neurological functioning , main morphological feature disease . The MeCP2 gene play major role transcriptional regulation gene , one gene encode brain-derived neurotrophic factor ( BDNF ) . The disease progression severity symptom directly affect level BDNF expression . An increase BDNF level ( genetic manipulation pharmacological agent ) lead delayed onset Rett syndrome-like symptom experimental model ; rescue gait/mobility , improve quality life increase survival rate . Copaxone treatment subcutaneous injection cause elevation BDNF level . Quantitative immunofluorescence assay show twofold increase neuronal expression BDNF follow Copaxone treatment . We expect increase BDNF level Copaxone administration stimulate communication brain cell ( synaptic maturation ) , lead amelioration symptom ( motor functions/gait , cognitive function , breathing , encephalopathy improve quality life ) girl Rett syndrome .</detailed_description>
