	<brief_summary>Background : - Some men prostate cancer prostate gland remove . The cancer still come back . Researchers want know receive vaccine prostate removal surgery lead less recurrence . Objective : - To see vaccine booster shot give men prostate cancer surgery change immune cell prostate gland . Eligibility : - Men age 18 old prostate cancer spread , want prostate gland remove treatment . Design : - Participants screen regular cancer care . They may small piece prostate remove . - Participants must practice effective birth control study treatment 1 month last vaccine booster . - Participants medical history , physical exam , blood liver test . They ask perform daily activity . - Participants magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) scan prostate . The scanner metal cylinder strong magnetic field . Participants lie table slide scanner . - Participants injected vaccine , likely leg . They inject vaccine booster 3 time several week . - At booster visit , participant medical history , physical exam , blood liver test . - Participants another MRI . Then surgery remove prostate . - Participants 2 follow-up visit year surgery . They medical history , physical exam , blood test .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Background - Adenocarcinoma prostate common cancer diagnosis American male follow lung cancer lead cause cancer death . - Vaccine strategy represent novel therapeutic approach treatment prostate cancer . One potential target prostate cancer vaccine PSA , due restrict expression prostate cancer normal prostatic epithelial cell . - A neoadjuvant approach may potential benefit provide prolonged protection via patient immune system future recurrence . - PROSTVAC vaccine induces strong immune response , show promising evidence activity randomize phase II study ( 8.5 month improvement median overall survival ) currently phase III clinical testing . - This vaccine test locally recurrent prostate cancer substantial inflammatory infiltrates within prostate see follow subcutaneous intraprostatic injection . Objectives -The primary objective evaluate post vaccine immunologic CD4 CD8 cell infiltrate response neoadjuvant vaccine strategy prostatectomy specimens patient plan undergo radical prostatectomy . Eligibility - Patients must biopsy proven prostate cancer surgical candidate radical prostatectomy - Must sufficient good health surgical candidate radical prostatectomy elect radical prostatectomy management prostate cancer - Granulocyte count great equal 1,500/mm3 , Platelet great equal 50,000/mm3 , Hgb great equal 8 g/dL , Bilirubin &lt; 1.5mg/dL , AST ALT &lt; 2.5xULN , Creatinine le equal 1.5 X ULN - Pre-intervention biopsy tissue must available either outside institution repeat biopsy Design - This study utilize rV-PSA ( L155 ) -TRICOM ( PROSTVAC-V ) prim vaccination follow monthly boost rF-PSA ( L155 ) -TRICOM ( PROSTVAC-F ) 3 month . - Patients undergo radical prostatectomy 4 month treatment PROSTVAC-V/F . - The maximum accrual trial 27 patient .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>INCLUSION CRITERIA 1 . Patients must histopathological documentation adenocarcinoma prostate prior start study evaluable biopsy tissue ( e.g. , unstained slide block ) available analysis . If evaluable tissue available , patient must agree undergo prevaccination prostate biopsy study alternative available tissue available . 2 . Patients must surgical candidate radical prostatectomy base standard workup PSA , biopsy result , necessary supplemental imaging . 3 . Patients must choose radical prostatectomy definitive treatment choice management prostate cancer . 4 . Patients must performance status 0 1 accord ECOG criterion 5 . No systemic steroid steroid eye drop use within 2 week prior initiation experimental therapy . Limited dos systemic steroid prevent IV contrast , allergic reaction anaphylaxis ( patient know contrast allergy ) allow . 6 . Hematological eligibility parameter ( within one month start therapy ) : Granulocyte count great equal 1,500/mm3 Platelet count great equal 50,000/mm3 Hgb great equal 8 g/dL 7 . Biochemical eligibility parameter ( within one month start therapy ) : 1 . Hepatic function : Bilirubin &lt; 1.5 mg/dl ( OR patient Gilbert syndrome , total bilirubin less equal 3.0 mg/dL ) , AST ALT &lt; 2.5 time upper limit normal.. Creatinine le equal 1.5 X ULN 2 . Creatinine le equal 1.5 X ULN 3 . Patients must test negative HIV , Hepatitis B C. 8 . Patients must active invasive malignancy within past 2 year ( exception nonmelanoma skin cancer ) life threaten illness . 9 . Patients must willing travel study site followup visit . 10 . Patients must great equal to18 year age . 11 . All patient receive prior vaccination vaccinia virus ( smallpox immunization ) must history allergy vaccine . 12 . Patients must understand sign inform consent explain neoplastic nature disease , procedures follow , experimental nature treatment , alternative treatment , potential risk toxicity , voluntary nature participation . 13 . The effect study agent use protocol develop human fetus unknown .
