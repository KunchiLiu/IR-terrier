	<brief_summary>Background : - More child cancer survive adulthood . Some side effect treatment go away quickly . But problem may go away may show month year later . These problem call late effect . Late effect cause difficulty cognitive function , attention memory . Physical activity find improve attention memory skill child Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder ( ADHD ) . Researchers want see physical activity help cognitive problem child brain tumor . Objectives : - To see physical activity improve cognitive function child radiation therapy brain tumor . Eligibility : - Children age 8 17 radiation brain tumor least 2 year ago . They must access computer . Design : - Participants screen height , weight , medical history . They answer question daily physical activity . Their heart check . - Participants go clinic 2 day . They fitness exam test attention , memory , concentration . They blood take answer question . Parents also answer question . - Participants put 2 group . For first 12 week , intervention group follow physical activity program . The control group usual physical activity . - For second 12 week , control group follow physical activity program . The intervention group continue activity . All group track physical activity activity monitor computer . - Participants follow-up visit clinic session . They repeat test list . - The study last 24 week plus two follow-up visit . Participants keep activity monitor .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Trial Evaluating Enhanced Physical Activity Intervention Improve Cognitive Late Effects Children Treated With Cranial Radiation Brain Tumors</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>BACKGROUND : - Children treat cranial radiation therapy ( CRT ) brain tumor high risk develop neurocognitive late effect consist significant decline overall IQ specific cognitive impairment , particularly attention , memory , process speed . Academic functioning , daily activity , quality life ( QOL ) also impact , child often require special educational service . - Despite adaptation radiation therapy ( delay radiation , reduce dose , specialized technique ) , cognitive deficit still develop . Interventions target cognitive rehabilitation limit yet sorely need . - A potential novel intervention cognitive rehabilitation explore child cancer involve physical activity ( PA ) . Compelling evidence human animal study indicate PA affect brain mechanism cognitive function damage CRT chemotherapy . - Previous PA intervention study child cancer find feasible , safe , beneficial health examine cognition outcome . Therefore , conduct randomize control trial evaluate effect PA cognitive function child treat CRT brain tumor . In addition , enhance intervention combine Acceptance Commitment Therapy ( ACT ) technique maximize participant ' motivation engage PA. - The immediate intervention group ( intervention group ) engage enhance PA intervention program first 12 week follow 12 week PA maintenance , delay intervention control group ( control group ) engage usual physical activity first 12 week follow enhanced PA intervention program second 12 week . OBJECTIVES : -To assess effect 12-week enhanced physical activity ( PA ) home intervention visual memory ( CogState One Card Learning Accuracy score ) child treat CRT brain tumor compare control group engage usual physical activity first 12 week . ELIGIBILITY : - Children age 8 - 18 year previously diagnose brain tumor childhood least 1 year post-completion CRT active anti-tumor treatment eligible . - Children report documented cognitive difficulty attention , learn memory , process speed per child parent legal guardian . DESIGN : -This prospective single-institution trial . Children randomize one two group : Group 1 ( n=30 ) : The immediate intervention group ( intervention group ) participate enhance PA home intervention group first 12 week ; follow 12 week PA maintenance . Group 2 ( n=30 ) : The delayed intervention control group ( control group ) engage usual physical activity ( intervention ) 12 week ; follow enhanced PA home intervention 12 week . - Neurobehavioral , circulate growth factor , cardiorespiratory evaluation conduct baseline ( T0 ) first 12 week home ( T2 ) intervention control group . The acute effect in-lab PA assess immediately follow baseline treadmill fitness test ( T1 ) use select cognitive measure group . PA group measure throughout period home via activity monitor . - After completion first 12 week period home follow-up evaluation ( T2 ) , intervention group ask maintain PA level next 12 week control group participate enhance PA intervention home 12 week . A final cognitive evaluation conduct group completion second 12- week period ( T3 ) . The primary outcome measure Cogstate One Card Learning Accuracy Score . The effect PA neurobehavioral outcome circulate growth factor also examine .</detailed_description>
