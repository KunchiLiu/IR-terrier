	<brief_summary>This study investigate role dopaminergic neural system symptom treatment depression . 40 patient meet DSM-IV criterion diagnosis depression compare matched sample healthy control . The depressed group receive open label treatment Bupropion MR ( 150mg bd ) 6 week . The control group receive treatment . All participant assess treatment , 2 week treatment 6 week treatment . The outcome assess 1 ) fMRI estimate neural response reward emotionally valenced stimulus ( 1st 2nd assessment ) , 2 ) computer base measure emotional processing ( assessment ) 3 ) standardise questionnaire measure depressive symptom ( assessment ) . The primary study hypothesis alter central dopamine use Bupropion lead alter neural response reward stimulus depressed patient ( i.e . compare fMRI outcome assessment visit 1 2 ) . A secondary hypothesis neural change predict subsequent symptom response bupropion ( i.e . compare symptom score assessment visit 1 3 ) , Lastly , study test hypothesis baseline difference reward circuitry particularly associate symptom anhedonia ( inability experience pleasure ) .</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Participants must sign informed consent document indicate understand purpose study procedure require study willing participate complying study procedure restriction Participants male female age 18 50 Participants Body Mass Index ( BMI ) 18 36 kg/m2 ( inclusive ) Screening Visit . The MDD participant must satisfy diagnosis MDD determine structured clinical interview DSMV ( SCID ) conduct psychiatrist . The MDD subtypes characterize DSMV also determine use post hoc test aim characterize heterogeneity extant within MDD population . Participants must sufficiently fluent English complete emotional reward task . Current use psychotropic medication electroconvulsive therapy ( within three week baseline assessment ) psychological treatment ( within 3 month baseline assessment ) They leave hand ( site brain activation vary depend handedness ) They fluent English History stimulant abuse ( lifetime ; e.g. , amphetamine , cocaine ) , alcohol abuse within one year alcohol dependence within lifetime . History , current medical condition opinion investigator may interfere scientific assessment safety participant , include brain injury , epilepsy/seizures , severe hepatic cirrhosis CNS tumour . Clinically significant abnormal value liver function test , clinical chemistry , urine drug screen , blood pressure measurement ECG . It expect laboratory value generally within normal range laboratory . NB clinical significance determine qualified study medic review result participant . Current pregnancy breastfeed Smoker &gt; 10 cigarette per day similar level tobacco consumption form . History smoke within 8 week become abstinent . Any contraindication MRI scanning , example metal implant body include ferromagnetic object body ( e.g. , metal implant , vessel clip , shrapnel injury ) implant device may damage magnet ( e.g. , heart pacemaker ) . Participation psychological medical study involve use medication within last 3 month . Previous participation study involve emotional test battery . Has clinically significant risk suicidal behaviour . Medical condition may alter hemodynamic parameter underlie BOLD signal ( e.g. , inadequately treated hypertension , diabetes mellitus ) . The following exclusion criterion apply specifically participant MDD group : Any known allergy , hypersensitivity intolerance bupropion excipients . Has contraindication use bupropion . Any medical contraindication , example condition treatment may alter absorption bupropion surgical treatment involve gut . History current Axis 1 DSMV psychiatric disorder ( except depression anxiety disorder specific phobia social anxiety disorder MDD group drug abuse subject criterion outline ) .The presence comorbid anxiety disorder record potential use post hoc exploratory analyse influence condition outcome measure The follow criterion apply specifically participants healthy control group : â€¢ History current Axis 1 DSMV psychiatric disorder</criteria>
