	<brief_title>Biomedical Instrumentation Study Mirror Therapy Elderly 's Hands Motor Activity</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Among various function impair age muscle function , indirectly affect quality life senior , since crucial progressive increase debilitate condition , lead difficulty carry everyday task often make dependent assistance others . The possible neural mechanism underlie decrease muscle function associate age include change undefined Central Nervous System , delay conduction velocity motor nerve fiber transmission neuromuscular junction . In context , necessary develop procedure reduce functional loss decrease negative effect age process , increase quality life senior . Mirror Therapy ( MT ) one possible procedure , base activation mirror neuron illusion generate viewing reflection member mirror . When perform movement member field vision , generate reflection mirror able offer brain new , albeit illusory visual stimulus , suggest covert member move . This illusion promote activation mirror neuron locate sensorimotor cortex region progression therapy , activation drive cortical plasticity promote reestablishment function , motor coordination increase range motion . Therefore , MT promise technique reduce functional loss age . It suggest implementation protocol functional recovery MT hand institutionalized elderly measurement electromyographic activity wrist , range speed movement , write skill application questionnaire Katz index calculation order investigate whether technique benefit public .</detailed_description>
