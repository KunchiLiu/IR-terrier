	<brief_summary>There wide variability option treatment chronic radiation proctitis . However , study still limit , usually case report single center comparative study method . Therefore , choice treatment determine availability local expertise method . The variability treatment option range anti-inflammatory medical treatment , sucralfate , short chain fatty acid , antioxidant hyperbaric oxygen endoscopic surgical treatment . Surgery usually last therapeutic option due high morbidity mortalityassociated . Various endoscopic treatment modality report . Formalin topic effective 48 % patient chronic radiation proctitis . The endoscopic treatment argon plasma ( APC ) low cost , easy apply transportation , safe effective treatment rectal bleeding patient chronic radiation proctitis . Currently , APC prefer endoscopic modality . Most study use APC radiation proctitis show benefit . The APC control mild moderate rectal bleed 80 % 90 % case improve symptoms urgency , diarrhea tenesmus 60 % 75 % case .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Comparison Between Two Different Parameters Argon Plasma Coagulation Treatment Chronic Radiation Proctitis : Historical Control Trial .</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>APC usually apply power 40-60W 1.2-2.5 L/min gas flow use electrosugical generator couple argon delivery unit . However , high gas flow associate high rate complication rectal stenosis deep rectal ulcer . In context , present study aim compare effectiveness safety two different paramenters argon plasma coagulation ( 40-50W 2.0 L/min gas flow vs 40W 1.2 L/min gas flow ) treatment patient symptomatic chronic radiation proctitis .</detailed_description>
