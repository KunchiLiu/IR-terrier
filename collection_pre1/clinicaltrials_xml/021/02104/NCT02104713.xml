	<brief_summary>This study determine safety allogeneic stem cell therapy healthy donor , 2nd degree burn wound less 20 % Total Body Surface Area ( TBSA ) , four different dose level . Clinical evaluation take place every 1 4 week interval wound closure , monthly 6 month follow last administration MSCs . Once safety dose-response analysis Phase 1 complete , expand trial initiate well examine efficacy MSC therapy 2nd degree burn wound . Phase 1 establish maximum safe dose use Phase II trial .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The study include Phase 1 trial . A tissue repository collect . The recipient Phases 1 study inpatient Jackson . Their enrollment continue outpatient setting . The donor recruit University Miami ( UM ) . The donor present 2 clinic visit , bone marrow aspiration , study team contact donor phone 2 time ( Initial call 24-48 hr . 30-60 day Donation ) . RECIPIENTS Recipients screen upon presentation hospital . To establish enrollment , wound examine measure . A complete medical history physical exam perform . Blood collect test blood bourne pathogen , include hepatitis HIV . A pregnancy test do female . Once patient enrol , MSC 's applied accord dose frequency determine Phase 1 trial . At various interval , skin biopsy , wound measurement , questionnaires possibly bone marrow aspirate may perform ( see ) . Study Design Specific Phase 1 : This represent Phase 1 portion study . It asses safety deliver MSC 's burn wound . A total 20 patient recruit divided 4 group . These group take dose escalation method , i.e . first group start low dose . If adverse reaction , second group receive high dose . This repeated third fourth group receive high dose . If necessary , second dose MSC 's give . Each administration give less 10 day apart 6 week apart . Second dos give evident significant adverse event occur first administration . There maximum 2 administration MSC 's . At end dose level , safety data present Data Safety Monitoring Board ( DSMB ) Institutional Review Board ( IRB ) . If significant adverse event concern either party , protocol continue next dose level . Rejection monitor blood test , receive MSC 's , well clinical evaluation . Upon discharge hospital , patient ask come clinic 1- 4 week interval depend course individual patient . Home nursing care may arrange necessary dressing change . During clinic visit , wound assess questionnaire do . During time , patient also necessary evaluation session physical occupational therapy . Once wound consider heal , patient may ask return clinic monthly ensure wound remain heal . At completion Phase 1 trial , safety data send DSMB , monitor , IRB FDA . If significant safety issue arise , study anticipated progress Phase 2 . Blood sample tissue repository : During course study , many sample take . These include serum , blood cell , tissue skin cell . These sample may take donor recipient . These sample may able provide insight biomarkers may use predict heal scar . As , may store , non-clinical research tissue repository . Patients would sign away right sample . SCHEDULE FOR RECIPIENTS ( Phase 1 patient ) . Week 1 : Health medication record . Samples blood drawn safety research purpose . A skin biopsy wound may perform wound evaluated/measured . Prior treatment , 2nd degree burn subject reassess determine wound heal likely within next week . If &gt; 30 % wound close significant evidence heal present , subject exclude participation study . MSC 's apply wound . A film dress hold cell place may apply . This dress would remove 12-48 hour post-operatively . The wound dress appropriate dressing specific type wound . Wounds also photograph . Week 3 26 : Patients return clinic . Additional sample blood may obtain research purpose . Questionnaires complete inquiry change health medication . Wounds evaluate measure , well photograph . Dead tissue clean necessary . Appropriate dressing change do . If need , MSC 's applied wound second time . The application le 10 day apart 6 week apart . Again cell apply , film dress hold cell may apply . This dress remove 12-48 hour . Signs rejection monitor . Blood test do per investigator discretion . Skin biopsy may also perform . If rejection reaction suspect , patient longer eligible receive donor cell . After Week 26 End Treatment Visit : If wound heal , biopsy wound may do . Samples blood may draw research purpose . These patient return clinic monthly ensure wound stay close . If wound remain unhealed , measure photographed . Note patient heal wound may refuse biopsy . Appropriate dressing change do . Questions health medication ask . DONORS Approximately 10 donor use harvest MSC 's . Initially , potential donor present screen visit . Here , physical exam do , addition screen questionnaire . Medical history collect . Blood sample also take test blood bourne pathogen , include hepatitis HIV . A urine sample collect well . If potential donor meet screen criterion , return second , 'donation ' visit . At visit , vital sign record bone marrow aspirate do . The bone marrow aspirate do Dr. John Byrnes , hematologist/oncologist routinely perform aspirate stem cell trial UM . This second visit take place within 1 week initial visit . A biomarker test may involve . The evaluation specific biomarkers may help determine effect stem cell delivery burn wound . In order provide type examination , removal analysis nucleic acid derive donor material may need . A separate genetic research consent provide donor . GENETIC TESTING The biomarker/genetic test may perform material obtain donor recipient . The sample could include bone marrow aspirate , blood tissue . The test perform primarily detect expression level gene important healing , tissue repair inflammation .</detailed_description>
