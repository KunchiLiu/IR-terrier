	<detailed_description>BACKGROUND : Allergic asthma ( AA ) commonly encounter respiratory disease child adult United States lead cause morbidity worldwide . Among disruptive expression disease AA acute asthma exacerbation . The CDC list ambient air pollutant environmental tobacco smoke among common trigger acute asthma exacerbation . Ozone ( O3 ) commonly encounter ambient air pollutant US . Endotoxin ( lipopolysaccharide LPS ) component bioaerosols find indoor outdoor environment , component tobacco smoke , increase indoor setting smoker live . LPS also component coarse fine mode particle matter air pollution . OXIDATIVE STRESS AND ASTHMA : Increased oxidative stress decrease antioxidant capability observe asthmatic . These pollutant pro-inflammatory associate increase oxidative stress , would exacerbate reactive oxygen reactive nitrogen specie ( ROS RNS ) -induced injury asthmatic . O3 injure epithelial cell , release secondary mediator activate inflammatory cell , part ligation TLR4 , primary receptor LPS . TLR4 activation inflammatory cell activate NF-kB induces oxidative stress . O3 LPS associate exacerbation asthma , report O3 LPS augment allergic airway inflammation allergic asthmatic ( AA ) . Development intervention mitigate response greatly decrease disease morbidity . Given role oxidant play pathophysiology asthma exacerbation , defect antioxidant level would increase risk acute asthma exacerbation . Nutritional deficiency vitamin E , ascorbate selenium link asthma severity , asthmatic decrease antioxidant level airway fluid . We others show vitamin C E decrease airway fluids asthmatic . Additionally , genetic factor may increase risk oxidant induce exacerbation asthma . Many investigator report person homozygous null polymorphism Glutathione-S-Transferase Mu1 ( GSTM1 ) gene unable produce GSTM1 protein ( GSTM1 null genotype ) increase risk acute pollutant-induced exacerbation asthma . We show healthy volunteer GSTM1 null genotype associate increase inflammatory response O3 , impact nociceptive response pollutant . We also show GSTM1 null volunteer enhance airway systemic inflammation follow LPS challenge . Others show GSTM1 null genotype associate increased response secondhand tobacco smoke , diesel exhaust , particulate matter component . Romieu et al demonstrated child asthma Mexico City increase susceptibility O3-induced exacerbation GSTM1 null genotype . This group also find GSTM1 null AAs selectively benefit antioxidant intervention . The GSTM1 null genotype find 20-40 % population , may overrepresented allergic population . Taken together , observation show sizable GSTM1 null population risk pollutant-induced airway disease , antioxidant intervention target action ROS RNS benefit asthmatic especially GSTM1 null asthmatic . ANTIOXIDANTS AND ASTHMA : A non-exclusive list propose antioxidant include radical scavenger ascorbate , a-tocopherol ( aT ) , y-tocopherol ( yT ) inducer NRF2 , activate NRF2 subsequent broad upregulation acute phase II antioxidant protein . These agent available naturally occur food nutritional supplement . A number animal , cell culture epidemiological study support idea antioxidant supplementation useful allergic airway disease . However , despite study widespread public scientific enthusiasm regard use agent asthmatic , scant human data support refute use intervention either acute chronic allergic airways disease . It crucial adequate , well-designed human study assess role antioxidant allergic asthma either confirm efficacy , refute claim effective , safe low cost intervention allergic disease . GAMMA TOCOPHEROL AND ASTHMA : Gamma tocopherol radical scavenge anti-inflammatory action may play important role decrease pollutant-induced allergic injury airway . Like isoforms vitamin E , yT potent ROS scavenger also powerful nucleophile trap electrophiles peroxynitite lipophilic compartment . One mechanism y-T cytoprotective scavenging RNS un-substituted C-5 position hydroxy-chroman ring y-T form 5-NO-y-tocopherol ( 5-NO-yT ) . Overall , vitamin E provide general protection DNA , lipids protein radical stress . An example protection show rodent study prostate cancer intake yT associate decreased DNA methylation CpG rich region NRF2 . NRF2 master regulator numerous cytoprotective antioxidant enzyme . Supplementation yT also prevent protein nitration attenuate loss plasma vitamin C plasma rodent peritonitis model inflammation . Our group also show yT inhibits COX-2 5-LO LPS-stimulated macrophage IL-1b stimulate epithelial cell . These action mediate primarily yT metabolite 2 , 7 , 8-trimethyl-2S- ( .-carboxyethyl ) -6-hydroxychroman ( y-CEHC ) require hydroxylation y-methyl group yT cytochrome P450 ( CYP450 ) . In carrageenan- induced inflammation male Wistar rat , yT decrease prostaglandin ( PGE2 ) leukotriene ( LTB4 ) production , suggest LO-mediated production leukotrienes may also inhibit yT . Tocopherols , include yT , also modulate gene expression number inflammatory gene . Thus , yT tocopherols decrease production number pro-inflammatory cytokine transcriptional level . In animal , also show gamma tocopherol reduce baseline eosinophilia airway . In early phase I study gamma tocopherol-enriched mixed tocopherol ( gT-mT ) show gT-mT inhibits monocyte induced cytokine production , decrease baseline nitrosative stress , inhibit LPS eosinophil neutrophil influx healthy volunteer . SUMMARY : There widespread opinion antioxidant nutrient like gamma tocopherol ( yT , form Vitamin E ) untapped inexpensive intervention environmentally trigger acute asthma . However , crucial gap evidence-based support intervention asthma . A lack coordinate research assess specific antioxidant regimen preclinical , phase I phase II study impede development phase III antioxidant trial asthmatic population . It also unclear physiological endpoint relevant study . This project focus phase II study yT AA base preclinical phase I study . For protocol test hypothesis gamma tocopherol supplement baseline eosinophil number airway sputa asthmatcs ( specific aim 1 ) ( specific aim 2 ) inhibit LPS induce airway inflammation mild allergic asthmatic . The investigator also exploratory assessment specific impact GSTM1 null genotype response LPS effect gamma tocopherol enrich supplementation response . If gamma tocopherol decrease LPS-induced respones asthmatic , would provide proof concept agent would useful intervention asthma , confirm teh need phase III study gamma tocopherol enrich supplement treatment asthma .</detailed_description>
