	<brief_summary>People multiple sclerosis ( MS ) nerve loss even without acute inflammatory relapse , obvious progressive phase disease . Drugs may prevent nerve loss work well early stage difficult measure progressive disability . But possible measure nerve loss neurofilament light ( NFL ) cerebrospinal fluid ( CSF ) . This trial neuroprotective drug , oxcarbazepine , show benefit animal model multiple sclerosis . The investigator use innovative outcome , reduction content NFL CSF , well usual clinical disability image method , measure success oxcarbazepine neuroprotective agent MS . The use NFL , surrogate marker neurodegeneration , allow blind accurate outcome .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Patients identify potentially eligible trial refer u invited take part study provide information give patient information sheet . This include patient clinical definite MS DMDs , MS relapse least 6 month feel ( subjective ) observe ( objective ) progress disability . For screen patient sign inform consent form discussion make sure fulfil inclusion exclusion criterion , neurological brief suicidality assessment safety blood urine test . Patients lumbar puncture measure NFL CSF . If threshold , show ongoing damage myelin , invite continue trial . Patients baseline brain spinal cord MRI OCT , clinical/neurological examination repeat lumbar puncture collection blood , urine saliva . Patients blindly randomise oxcarbazepine v placebo give bottle medication participant 's individualised label . At two four week baseline visit , patient phone visit investigator collect detail new symptom , new medication generally advise participant . The tablet increase two tablet morning two tablet even . Patients see study team 13 week initiation drug 25 37 week OCT , lumbar puncture , collection blood , urine saliva general , visual , neurological cognitive assessments/questionnaires . The final visit week 48 , final lumbar puncture , precede clinical measure include general , visual , neurological cognitive assessments/questionnaires , MRI , OCT blood , urine &amp; saliva collection . The measurement NFL repeat CSF sample end study determine whether patient MS oxcarbazepine reduction level CSF NFL .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>A diagnosis definite multiple sclerosis Treatment DMDs least 6 month prior baseline visit* CSF NFL level â‰¥ 0.380ng/mL EDSS score 3.5 6.0 No history relapse 6 month prior baseline visit A history slow progression disability , objective subjective , period least 6 month prior baseline Age 1860 year [ Temporary interruption permit discretion investigator period 8 week prevent inflammatory MS reactivation . The case could happen include example switch DMDs require washout period per clinical practice . When safety concern , Lymphopenia side effect induce DMD , interruption period exceed 8 week per clinical need . If reactivation MS occur relapse investigator assess meet withdrawal criterion 6 . ] Pregnant breastfeeding unwilling use adequate contraception . * Participants diagnosis primary progressive PP MS primary relapsing PR MS. A clinical relapse pulse intravenous oral steroid 6 month precede baseline assessment . Participants present medical disorder deem severe unstable CI poorly control diabetes arterial hypertension , severe cardiac insufficiency , unstable ischemic heart disease , abnormal liver function test ( &gt; 2.5 time ULN ) abnormal complete blood count ( particular leukopenia , define lymphocyte count &lt; 500 , neutrophil count &lt; 1.5 platelet count &lt; 100 , thrombocytopenia &lt; 1.5 LLN ) , medical condition , opinion investigator , would pose additional risk participant . Infection hepatitis B hepatitis C human immunodeficiency virus . Exposure investigational drug within 30 day enrolment study . Judged clinically suicidal risk opinion investigator base upon clinical interview Columbia SuicideSeverity Rating Scale ( CSSRS ) . Prior history malignancy unless exception grant Investigator . History uncontrolled drug alcohol abuse within 6 month prior screen . Past untoward reaction OxCbz Cbz Participants receive OxCbz Cbz previous 12 week baseline [ Adequate method contraception non hormonal method barrier method , intrauterine device , surgical sterilisation ( undergone participant partner ) . Female participant use hormonal form contraception require use additional barrier method . True abstinence consider acceptable method contraception line prefer usual lifestyle subject . Periodic abstinence ( e.g. , calendar , ovulation , symptothermal , postovulation method ) , declaration abstinence duration trial , withdrawal acceptable method contraception .
