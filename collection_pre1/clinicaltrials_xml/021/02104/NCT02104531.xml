	<brief_summary>The investigator purpose determine ability low cost , currently available image technique predict shoulder movement disorder location shoulder disease base motion analysis subject know shoulder disorder .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Shoulder Motion Guided Patient Diagnostic Treatment Classification</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Shoulder disorder account second large number musculoskeletal case United States large health care burden . The current standard diagnosis shoulder disorder clinical exam , visual motion assessment case , costly magnetic resonance ( MR ) imaging . However , specific tissue pathology always accurately identify , often directly link magnitude dysfunction . There need categorize sub-grouping patient base underlying movement dysfunction present . Video fluoroscopy common clinical tool improve accuracy motion analysis . The investigator use 2-D fluoroscopy , combine 3-D MR imaging measure shoulder motion . From motion analysis predict area potential soft tissue disease , compare disease location MR imaging . The investigator hypotheses motion base predicted disease location significantly associate disease location MR imaging .</detailed_description>
	<criteria>Normal subject normal normal shoulder movement function include , age gender match symptomatic subject . Symptomatic subject include visual shoulder movement deviate might consider normal ; experience shoulder pain movement , clinical examination consistent soft tissue cumulative trauma soft tissue ( rotator cuff disease ) . Clinical MR imaging use confirm rotator cuff disease , subacromial bursitis , and/or bicipital tendinitis . Age outside accepted range . Contraindications radiation exposure ( pregnancy possible pregnancy , recent substantive radiation exposure ( CT scanning , treatment involve radiation ) . Subjects unable move least 90 degree shoulder motion also exclude .</criteria>
