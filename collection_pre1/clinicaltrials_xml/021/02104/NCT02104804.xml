	<brief_title>Evaluate Efficacy Safety Saxagliptin Added Insulin Monotherapy Insulin Combined With Metformin Chinese Subjects With Type 2 Diabetes Who Have Inadequate Glycaemic Control</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Study Design : Randomized , prospective , double-blind , two-arm , parallel group , multi-center trial . Target Subject Population : Subjects age ≥18 type 2 diabetes ( HbA1c ≥7.5 % ≤11.0 % FPG &lt; 270 mg/dL ( 15 mmol/L ) ) stable baseline therapy ( insulin alone insulin combined metformin , insulin dos ≥20 ≤150 unit per day total ) least eight week time screen . Insulin may long-acting , intermediate-acting , pre-mixed . 444 patient plan randomize . Investigational Product , Dosage Mode administration : Active treatment comprise Saxagliptin 5 mg tablet daily . Comparator , Dosage Mode administration : Matching placebo tablet use comparator . Duration Treatment : The study divide single blind placebo lead period 8 week double-blind treatment phase 24 week . Patients rescue base high FPG value . Statistical Methods : The analysis primary endpoint change baseline week 24 treatment HbA1c consist analysis covariance ( ANCOVA ) model treatment group metformin use enrolment fixed effect baseline HbA1c value covariate . The analysis perform Full analysis Set ( FAS ) consist randomised subject receive least 1 randomised investigational product dose least 1 non-missing baseline 1 post-baseline efficacy assessment . Within framework ANCOVA model , point estimate two-sided 95 % confidence interval ( CI ) mean change within treatment group well difference mean change treatment group calculate . The Per Protocol ( PP ) analysis set subset full analysis set consist subject deviate term protocol may affect study outcome significantly specify pre-defined protocol deviation list prior unblinding study . All decision exclude subject primary data set make prior unblinding study . The primary efficacy endpoint change baseline HbA1c , demographic , baseline diabetes related characteristic secondary efficacy endpoint analyze use PP Data Set . The analysis PPG AUC , 120 minute PPG , FPG mean total daily dose insulin also do FAS use similar ANCOVA model describe . Subjects achieve therapeutic glycaemic response ( A1C &lt; 7 % ) analyze use Fisher 's exact test include exact 95 % confidence interval . The FPG analyse utilize mean late two FPG value prior randomization baseline value . The endpoint FPG analysis mean week 20 week 24 FPG value . All analysis ( except analysis mean total daily dose insulin ) utilize observation visit prior rescue subject 's mean total daily dose insulin increase &gt; 10 % baseline . If observation week 24 miss meet criterion , late post-baseline value carry forward ( LOCF ) . The analysis mean total daily dose insulin utilize late , non-missing , post-baseline value regardless rescue . Multiplicity primary secondary endpoint control via hierarchical test procedure utilizes full alpha ( 0.05 ) test . The sequence testing : 1 . Change baseline HbA1c Week 24 . 2 . Change baseline PPG AUC Week 24.3 . Change baseline 120 minute PPG Week 24 . 4 . Proportion subject achieve HbA1c &lt; 7.0 % Week 24 . 5 . Change baseline FPG mean Week 20 Week 24 . 6 . Change baseline MTDDI Week 24 .</detailed_description>
