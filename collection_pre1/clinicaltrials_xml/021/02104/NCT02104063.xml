	<brief_summary>The presence metastatic disease lymph node within groin important factor predict long-term outcome patient diagnose penile cancer . In majority patient diagnose penile cancer obvious abnormality felt groin even though cancer may already spread lymph node groin . In patient , procedure call Dynamic Sentinel Lymph Node Biopsy ( DSLB ) require determine cancer spread lymph node groin . In DSLB radioactive substance inject site penile cancer travel lymph node groin biopsied . This procedure require general anaesthetic in-patient hospital stay . In approximately 20 % patient penile cancer obvious abnormality felt lymph node groin . However , abnormality detect may necessarily due metastatic disease . In order confirm metastatic disease present lymph node patient biopsy also require . However patient lymph node detect biopsied use ultrasound scan rather pass radioactive substance body . MRI-PET new procedure combine conventional MRI ( Magnetic Resonance Imaging ) PET ( Positron Emission Tomography ) scan one scan . MRI - PET scan create clear picture internal body structure . MRI-PET non-invasive procedure perform out-patient basis . The accuracy MRI-PET detecting metastatic penile cancer know . The main purpose study establish effectiveness MRI-PET compare DSLB ultrasound guide biopsy detect presence metastatic disease lymph node patient penile cancer . If effective , MRI-PET could replace invasive procedure currently require detection metastatic penile cancer .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Characterising Metastatic Penile Cancer Using Molecular Imaging - Hybrid MRI-PET MRI-PET</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Penile cancer neglect area term clinical molecular research due relatively low incidence disease ( age standardize incidence 0.3 - 1 per 100,000 men European country USA ) . Inguinal node impalpable 80 % penile cancer patient presentation . However , 20 % harbour occult metastasis . Therefore radical inguinal lymphadenectomy , significant associate morbidity 70 % ( mortality ) , unnecessary surgical procedure majority patient . There presently limit data available small series pertain role radiological image modality establish presence lymph node metastasis , particularly micrometastases , patient squamous cell carcinoma penis . Thus clear role moment radiological investigation stag men impalpable inguinal lymph node presentation . Dynamic sentinel lymph node biopsy invasive procedure utilize lymphoscintigraphy still require surgical excision lymph node . Simultaneous PET MRI use new hybrid MRI-PET system promise optimal spatial temporal co-registration structural , functional , molecular image data . The theoretical advantage hybrid MRI-PET scanning compare CT-PET well soft tissue resolution , advantageous small lymph node , also decrease radiation exposure . Also , local stag primary penile tumour could perform simultaneously inguinal lymph node use MRI-PET . If effective , MRI-PET would provide single non-invasive imaging test would replace dynamic sentinel lymph node biopsy ( operator dependent , involve general anaesthetic , in-patient hospital stay associate morbidity ) detection micrometastatic deposit patient cN0 ( impalpable inguinal lymph node ) disease . In addition , single MRI-PET sequence also stage primary lesion . University College London Hospital ( UCLH ) manage large number penile cancer patient United Kingdom ( UK ) . Hybrid MRI-PET new image modality could result significant cost saving , importantly , avoid invasive operative procedure necessitate in-patient hospital stay ( associate potential significant morbidity ) . UCLH currently hybrid MRI-PET scanner UK . This research unique groundbreaking could dramatic impact penile cancer patient . Additionally , serum , blood frozen tissue cohort patient collect stored , provide extremely valuable resource future translational study .</detailed_description>
