	<brief_summary>Many people spinal cord injury longer able walk must use wheelchairs mobility . These individual experience great rate depression low quality life . Many individual express strong desire walk , report many psychosocial benefit eye eye peer social interaction . Additionally , wheelchair allow limited community access , create additional obstacle seek meaningful social role community . Currently , new technology call robotic exoskeleton would allow people spinal cord injury walk . These robotic exoskeleton also allow curb , ramp , stair negotiation , critical community access . Current research examine train robotic exoskeleton indoors level surface clinical setting . This study examine potential everyday use , include ramp , stair , curb indoor outdoor use .</brief_summary>
