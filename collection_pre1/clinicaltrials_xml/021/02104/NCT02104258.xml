	<brief_summary>The purpose study compare effect two rehabilitation protocol different emphasis eccentric exercise acute hamstring muscle strain injury time return sport ( RTS ) rate re-injuries male athlete . The hypothesis addition early eccentric hamstring exercise perform longer muscle-tendon length towards end range motion alter outcome RTS re-injuries rehabilitation protocol acute hamstring muscle strain injury .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Background rationale : Acute hamstring muscle strain injury represent prevalent non-contact muscle injury report sport . Despite high prevalence rapidly expand body literature investigate hamstring muscle strain injury , [ 1 ] occurrence re-injury rate improve last three decade [ 2 ] . Therefore , rehabilitation secondary prevention particular concern , primary objective rehabilitation protocol return athlete pre-injury level soon possible minimal risk injury recurrence.There still lack consensus clinical research regard effectiveness various rehabilitation protocol acute hamstring injury athletes participate sport high sprint demand [ 3,4 ] . To knowledge , prospective , randomised trial investigate effect different rehabilitation protocol Middle-Eastern athletic population . Eccentric strength train show reduce risk new acute hamstring injury well re-injuries [ 5,6 ] , whereas hamstring exercise perform longer muscle-tendon length , preferentially mimic movement occur simultaneously knee hip report effective protocol contain conventional exercise [ 7 ] , suggest key strategy management hamstring injury . However , preventive effect relate eccentric training remain unclear still debate optimal intensity eccentric training rehabilitation acute hamstring strain injury prevention re-injuries yet unknown [ 8 ] . The primary objective study therefore compare effect two rehabilitation protocol acute hamstring muscle strain injury time return sport ( RTS ) rate re-injuries male athlete prospective single-site randomize controlled trial . The investigator aim include 90 male athlete clinical sign MRI abnormality consistent acute hamstring muscle strain injury . The injured athlete randomise one two different rehabilitation protocol unlike emphasis eccentric exercise .</detailed_description>
