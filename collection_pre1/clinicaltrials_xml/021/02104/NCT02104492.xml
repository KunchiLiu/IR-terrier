	<brief_summary>Multiple sclerosis ( MS ) common inflammatory demyelinate chronic disease central nervous system second lead cause disability young adult . Motor deficit also involve respiratory muscle . This involvement present early stage disease frequently dismiss professional advance stage disease . The effect train program respiratory muscle sufficiently study . The aim research assess clinical functional response 12-week respiratory muscle train program ( RMTP ) person relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis ( RRMS ) . This study consist two sub research : Firstly , single-blind randomized clinical trial carry 40 person RRMS . Participants either receive ( n = 20 ) peripheric resistive muscle train program supplement 12-week Respiratory Muscles Training Program ( RMTP ) ORYGEN DualÂ® device 50 minute , twice week three month ( n = 20 ) receive peripheric resistive muscle train program health education program . Main outcomes strength respiratory muscle assess maximal inspiratory expiratory pressure measurement ( MIP MEP ) . The secondary outcome assess quality life ( MSQOL-54 ) , walk speed ( T25-FW , MSWS-12 Hauser ambulatory index ) , fatigue ( MFIS ) , endurance respiratory muscle ( 10RM ) manoeuvre peripherical muscle strength ( Multiple-Sit-to-Stand Test handgrip strength ) . Secondly , qualitative research researcher interview participant interest carry intervention ( difficulty advantage ) identify themes interest change quality life .</brief_summary>
