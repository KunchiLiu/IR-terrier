	<brief_title>Endostatin Study Patients With Neurofibromatosis Type 2 ( NF2 ) NF2-Related Tumors</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Neurofibromatosis type 2 ( NF2 ) hereditary tumor predisposition syndrome cause mutation NF2 tumor suppressor gene . Individuals NF2 high likelihood develop multiple nervous system tumor , include schwannomas , meningioma , ependymomas . The hallmark NF2 bilateral vestibular schwannomas . Historically , NF2 patient experience complete hearing loss either tumor progression treatment tumor surgery radiation . Effective treatment urgently need NF2 patient progressive hearing loss hearing loss associate impairment social , emotional , communication function increase depression . Previous study NF2 patient treat bevacizumab suggest inhibition vascular endothelial growth factor ( VEGF ) could result hear improvement reduction tumor size.Recombinant human endostatin inhibit formation blood vessel inhibit migration vascular endothelial cell .In way , endostatin inhibit nutrition tumor decrease tumor 's growth metastasis . In vitro test , endostatin inhibit cell migration Tube formation microvascular endothelial cell line HHEC . Besides , inhibit blood vessel ' formation chicken embryo sac membrane . Based study , perform clinical trial know treatment effect tolerability endostatin NF2 .</detailed_description>
