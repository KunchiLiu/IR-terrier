	<brief_summary>This prospective protocol enroll patient pathologically confirm solid malignancy receive stereotactic body radiation therapy ( SBRT ) oligometastases , consolidation systemic therapy , prior systemic therapy purpose debulking , re-irradiation setting . Increasing use SBRT clinical trial patient malignancy histology utilized setting . However , individualized outcome characteristic treatment prospectively follow well document . By institute registry patient receive SBRT setting possible determine trend pattern care outcomes refinement justification treatment .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Clinical Registry Oligometastic Disease , Consolidation Therapy , Debulking Prior Chemotherapy , Re-Irradiation</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Patients group one four treatment arm . Treatment intent must specify time registration . OLIGOMETASTATIC ARM- The first treatment arm patient oligometastatic disease , define treatment curative intent le equal six site disease initial presentation metastatic disease within context initial combine modality treatment regimen ( e.g. , chemotherapy surgical phase therapy ) . Patients treatment arm receive definitive , ablative dose radiation intend eradicate residual gross tumor `` '' sit disease . A variety acceptable ablative fractionation scheme variable ability prevent normal tissue toxicity allow . Further planned systemic therapy surgery eliminate stratification group long overall intent curative . CONSOLIDATION ARM- The second treatment arm consolidation follow systemic therapy . This approach akin experience consolidation radiation conventional radiation systemic therapy tumor like bulky lymphoma , etc . In context , treatment direct towards PET-avid residual disease assume harbor residual active disease disease resistant systemic therapy . The treatment dose sub-ablative yet still maintain radiobiologic potency local control option future systemic therapy . NORTON-SIMON ARM- The third treatment arm enroll patient prior receive systemic therapy require initial debulking gross disease enhance chemotherapy efficacy per Norton-Simon hypothesis . ( Patients initially receive systemic therapy , gross residual disease less equal 6 site disease , receive SBRT plan systemic therapy ( target cytotoxic ) immediately follow SBRT enrol onto arm ) RE-IRRADIATION ARM- The fourth treatment arm enroll patient prior irradiation suffer disease recurrence failure within previously irradiate volume . Prior irradiation consist external beam irradiation- conventional treatment , hypofractionated treatment , stereotactic radiation , even brachytherapy</detailed_description>
	<criteria>1 . Pathologically confirm solid tumor malignancy locally advance metastatic . 2 . Able safely receive intend protocol define SBRT dose . 3 . For oligometastatic category , patient 6 site active extracranial disease amenable SBRT maximum 7 cm diameter 4 . Must CT C/A/P , PET/CT scan within 8 week enrollment . 5 . Age â‰¥ 18 year . 6 . Karnofsky performance status 70 high , ECOG &lt; 2 7 . Women childbearing potential men must agree use adequate contraception ( hormonal barrier method birth control ; abstinence ) prior study entry , duration study participation , 90 day follow completion therapy . Should woman become pregnant suspect pregnant participating study , inform treat physician immediately . 7.1 female childbearing potential woman ( regardless sexual orientation , undergone tubal ligation , remain celibate choice ) meet follow criterion : Has undergone hysterectomy bilateral oophorectomy ; Has naturally postmenopausal least 12 consecutive month ( i.e. , menses time precede 12 consecutive month ) . 8 . Agreeable willing participate expect protocol define followup . 9 . Ability understand willingness sign write informed consent . 10 . Registry participation exclude participation clinical trial . 1 Because tolerance dose SBRT gastrointestinal tract establish , patient metastatic disease invade esophagus , stomach , intestine , mesenteric lymph node eligible . 2 . Uncontrolled intercurrent illness include , limited , ongoing active infection , symptomatic congestive heart failure , unstable angina pectoris , cardiac arrhythmia , psychiatric illness/social situation would limit compliance study requirement . 3 Subjects must pregnant nursing due potential congenital abnormality potential regimen harm nursing infant . 4 Patients undergoing concurrent chemotherapy .</criteria>
