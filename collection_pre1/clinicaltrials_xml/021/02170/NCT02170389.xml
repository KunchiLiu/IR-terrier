	<brief_title>Vaccine Therapy Before Surgery Treating Patients With Localized Kidney Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To assess immune-modulatory systemic intratumoral effect AGS-003 ( renal cell carcinoma/cluster differentiation [ CD ] 40L ribonucleic acid [ RNA ] -transfected autologous dendritic cell vaccine AGS-003 ) neoadjuvant treatment patient localize renal cell carcinoma . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . To assess feasibility total tumor RNA processing-related activity meet specification AGS-003 manufacturing utilize core needle biopsy procedure tumor harvest prior nephrectomy . OUTLINE : Patients receive 3 injection renal cell carcinoma/cluster CD40L RNA-transfected autologous dendritic cell vaccine AGS-003 intradermally ( ID ) every 7 day week 6-8 absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . Patients undergo partial radical nephrectomy week 10 . After completion study treatment , patient follow 1 month .</detailed_description>
