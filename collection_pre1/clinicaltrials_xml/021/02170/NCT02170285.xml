	<brief_summary>The purpose study test tDCS ( transcranial direct current stimulation ) , type non-invasive brain stimulation , determine whether improve motor function child perinatal stroke hemiparesis . Children 6-18 year imaging-confirmed perinatal stroke functional motor impairment recruit . Children randomize ( 1:1 ) receive sham tDCS ( 20 minute daily ) daily intensive , goal-directed motor learn therapy ( 90 minute ) . Motor outcomes repeat baseline , 1 week , 2 month . Aim 1 : Establish ability tDCS safely enhance motor learn child perinatal stroke . Hypothesis 1 : tDCS safe well tolerated child . Hypothesis 2 : Contralesional , cathodal tDCS increase motor functional gain measure AHA 2 month child perinatal stroke .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Methods detail include elsewhere Study : Randomized , sham-controlled , double blind , phase II clinical trial . Patient Population . All child recruit Alberta Perinatal Stroke Project ( APSP ) ; large population-based perinatal stroke research cohort base Alberta Children 's Hospital direct PI . Prospective APSP ascertainment since 2007 combine retrospective enrolment ( 1992-2007 ) comprehensive International Classification Disease code ( ICD-9 , ICD-10 ) 237 institutional database . These fully characterize patient confirm diagnosis modern neuroimaging assess person standardized APSP clinic . Recruitment occur randomly population child meet criterion . Inclusion/exclusion criterion - see Data Collection Management . Candidate APSP family contact review consent/assent form . Families reside outside Calgary equal opportunity participate exist APSP support system . All complimentary data exist study extractable APSP database ( demographic , imaging , risk factor , outcome ) .13 Neuroimaging data manage ACH Pediatric Neuroimaging Laboratory accord institutional protocol . Neurophysiology data collect ACH Pediatric TMS Laboratory securely store centrally.107 The institutional Clinical Research Unit database management unit design clinical research currently house APSP study trial . The research database platform encompass data capture utility , management tool , security measure ( Health Canada-compliant ) . Methods adhere CONSORT guideline study register prior consent first patient ( www.clinicaltrials.gov ) . Intensive Motor Learning ( subject ) . An evidence-based approach upper extremity motor learn therapy child hemiparetic CP employed . Protocols design expert pediatric neurorehabilitation occupational therapy co-investigators base best available evidence . All child participate child-centered , age-appropriate , goal-directed , peer support motor learn program . Designed `` school program '' optimize efficiency , child attend hospital 10 consecutive weekday 2 week . Each session begin 30 minute social snack activity , provide opportunity peer social interaction `` recharge '' school day engage affected extremity functional activity . Each subject enter 90 minute goal-directed ( see COPM outcome measure ) motor learn therapy individualize occupational therapist . Week 1 employ constraint induce movement therapy ( CIMT ) accord current practice guideline . Each child custom fit removable , bivalved cast worn throughout therapy session . Week 2 transition intensive bimanual therapy integrate gain practical bimanual function . Intensive bimanual therapy evidence-based , safe , valid , effective motor learn strategy child hemiparetic CP . Efficacy appear equal CIMT absence constraint facilitate functional bimanual motor learn remove complication cast . Bimanual task grade select accord relative function increase complexity across relevant spectrum ( e.g . passive assist active manipulator ) . Tasks symmetrical asymmetrical , gear age-appropriate activity daily live individual interest , include active patient participation . Following acute 10 day intervention , child receive structure home program base principle ongoing therapist support , surveillance , documentation 2 month . Randomization blinding . Children randomize 1:1 tDCS sham . The study statistician perform randomization base study number , blind subject detail . Allocation communicate study PI tDCS neurophysiologist . The subject , parent , measure treat occupational therapist , study member blind treatment allocation . The neurophysiologist program subject tDCS unit accordingly . All experience identical ramp-up current 1mA 30 second maintain stimulation 120 second . Those randomized treatment current maintain 20 minute therapy . The tDCS unit randomize sham automatically ramp-down gradually 60 second follow initial 120 second stimulation . These sham procedure well validate adult tDCS trial . Blinding effectiveness evaluate . Intervention : TDCS - see . Outcome measure - see Interim Safety Analysis . Any possible major side effect immediately report IRB per policy . Minor side effect track safety outcome specify . An interim safety analysis perform first 2 camp ( 12 subject ) ensure decrease hand function occur association contralesional tDCS . This evaluated comparing change affect ( AHA , MA ) unaffected ( GS , PS , BB ) hand 1 week 2 month tDCS sham population . Sample Size . Variables extrapolate relevant literature , previous study population , personal communication AHA creator . Smallest detectable difference AHA estimate 0.97 logit unit approximately 5 logit-based AHA unit . Our previous trial population find proportion achieve change approximately 25 % CIMT alone compare 65 % receive CIMT contralesional brain stimulation ( rTMS ) . Therefore , primary hypothesis tDCS improve AHA gain 2 month , significance level alpha=0.05 , power 90 % , drop-outs ( 100 % completion previous trial ) , 24 patient ( 12 per group ) require . This comparable large pediatric CP trial positive tDCS rTMS adult stroke trial . Statistical Analysis . Co-investigator expertise statistical method ( AN ) clinical trial methodology ( MH ) establish . Primary analysis examine change AHA outcome variable baseline final outcome 2 month use simple ANOVA . Secondary analysis explore effect time severity use repeat measure ANCOVA deficit severity covariable examine interaction across treatment group ( tDCS , sham ) . Safety outcomes compare change unaffected hand function ( ) , adverse event rate ( tDCS v sham ) use Chi-square/Fisher exact Mann-Whitney test . Association treatment group subject 's estimation treatment receive determined evaluate sham effectiveness ( Chi-square/Fisher exact ) . The sample large enough multivariable modelling . Analysis intention-to treat .</detailed_description>
