	<brief_summary>Adipose tissue , include white adipose tissue ( WAT ) brown adipose tissue ( BAT ) , play essential role regulate whole-body energy homeostasis . Excess expansion WAT due positive energy balance defect thermogenic gene expression BAT associate obesity various metabolic disease . Until 2009 question whether adult human BAT whether could conceivably contribute whole body energy usage meaningful way matter vigorous debate . The publication three apppers New England Journal Medicine demonstrate adult human BAT , activate , activation appear defective obesity reframed debate , revive interest BAT physiology . Recent study also reveal presence subset cell WAT could induce environmental hormonal factor become `` brown-like '' cell , `` beigeing '' process suggest strong antiobesity antidiabetic benefit . The extrapancreatic action glucagon-like peptide-1 ( GLP-1 ) endothelial cell liver report . Additionally , effect GLP-1 adipose tissue describe . Studies perform isolated adipocytes demonstrate GLP-1 ability induce lipogenic lipolytic mechanism white adipose tissue ( WAT ) . More recent study show GLP-1 agonism stimulate brown adipose tissue thermogenesis brown hypothalamic AMP-activated protein kinase ( AMPK ) animal . However , data clearly show GLP-1 agonism stimulate brown subcutaneous white adipose tissue ( SWAT ) human obesity .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Individuals treat 10 day . Biopsy subcutaneous white adipose ( 1.5X1.5X1.5cm ) perform 10 day treatment programme local anesthesia . Measure brown fat characteristic biopsy samples.The sample immediately process 3 sections.One part store immunohistology western blot , second snap-frozen estimation biochemical marker , remainder use harvest small subcutaneous artery micro-dissection . Also , perivascular adipose tissue ( PVAT ) study change morphology possible signal pathway GLP-1 treatment .</detailed_description>
