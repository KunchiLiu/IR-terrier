	<brief_summary>The purpose study identify effect lisdexamfetamine ( LDX ) neural behavioral subcomponents self-control , cognitive control reward functioning , adolescent young adult attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder . The investigator hypothesize LDX associate 1a ) decrease task-independent locus coeruleus ( LC ) activity ; 1b ) increase task-related activity LC cognitive control network ; 2 ) increase LC connectivity cognitive control network 3 ) improve task performance self-control . The investigator test hypothesis fMRI data linear contrast voxel-wise map parameter estimate ( univariate connectivity analysis ) . The investigator also assess change brain activity LDX LC ventral tegmental area ( VTA ) hypothesize alter ADHD related cognitive control self-control dysfunction ADHD . The investigator use repeated-measures , between-subject design compare effect oral daily LDX double-blind placebo-controlled randomize trial ( RCT ) neural ( fMRI ) behavioral correlate cognitive control via work memory reward - delay discounting task adolescent young adult .</brief_summary>

Written informed consent must obtain legally acceptable representative ( e.g . guardian caregiver minor ) , accordance requirement Institutional Review Board ( IRB ) , prior initiation protocolrequired procedure . In addition , subject , required IRB , must provide informed assent screen must able understand withdraw time time . 7 . The subject designate guardian ( ) caregiver ( ) [ If minor ] able comprehend satisfactorily comply protocol requirement , evaluate investigator Clinical contraindication 1 . History schizophrenia , bipolar disorder , autism spectrum disorder , specific focal neurological disorder 2 . Current academic learning disorder ( ) 3 . Abnormal cardiac functioning exclude 4 . The subject experience Adverse Events trial would , investigator 's judgment , preclude exposure LDX 5 . The subject protocol violation trial consider major judgment investigator ( significant noncompliance , use prohibit concomitant medication , concern use drug abuse , etc . ) , would deem poor candidate trial 6 . Sexually active male commit utilize approve birth control method remain abstinent trial 90 day follow last dose study drug . Sexually active female childbearing potential commit utilize 1 approved birth control method remain abstinent trial 30 day follow last dose study drug . Abstinence permit confirm documented every trial visit . If employing birth control , 1 follow precaution must use : vasectomy , tubal ligation , vaginal diaphragm , intrauterine device , birth control pill , birth control depot injection , implant , condom sponge spermicide . 7 . Subjects inability swallow tablet tolerate oral medication 8 . It investigator 's opinion subject 's best interest continue 9 . Contraindication MRI scanning ( e.g. , metal implant , pacemaker , metal foreign body , pregnancy ) Beastfeeding ( applicable ) 1 . Females breastfeed and/or positive pregnancy test result prior receive trial drug Excluded medication 1 . Agents low blood level amphetamine : urinary acidify agent ( e.g . ammonium chloride , sodium acid phosphate , etc . ) ; Methenamine Therapy . 2 . Agents increase blood level amphetamine : urinary alkalinize agent ( e.g . Acetazolamide , Thiazides ) . 3 . Dextroamphetamine known inhibit monoamine oxidase , well metabolite furazolidone . Concurrent administration monoamine oxidase ( MAOI ) inhibitor contraindicate MAOIs potentially result hypertensive crisis . Vyvanse give least 14 day discontinuation MAO inhibitor . 4 .
