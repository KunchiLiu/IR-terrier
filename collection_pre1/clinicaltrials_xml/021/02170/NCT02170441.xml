	<brief_summary>The goal study evaluate time diagnosis three assay ( line probe , pyrosequencing , Microscopic Observation Drug Susceptibility Assay [ MODS ] ) detect resistance first second-line anti-tuberculosis ( TB ) drug Mycobacterium tuberculosis ( Mtb ) strain 7 day less , allow rapid diagnosis extensively drug-resistant TB ( XDR-TB ) .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The goal study test , fine tune , compare three test ( line probe , pyrosequencing , MODS assay ) rapidly detect Mycobacterium tuberculosis ( Mtb ) strain resistant first second-line anti-tuberculosis ( TB ) drug allow rapid diagnosis Extensively Drug-Resistant Tuberculosis ( XDR-TB ) . Primary Specific Aims Aim 1 : To reduce average XDR-TB detection time month week . Aim 2 : To determine agreement rapid test standard drug susceptibility test ( DST ) result . Aim 3 : To identify genetic basis discordant result Aim 2 . Aim 4 : To characterize genotypic , phenotypic epidemiological feature , well geographical relationship , XDR-TB strain compare drug-resistant susceptible strain . Secondary Aims Aim 1 : Cost-effectiveness study . The cost associate rapid-test implementation compare performance new test rapidly accurately detect drug resistance XDR-TB . Aim 2 : To determine predictive value resistance-associated mutation determine sputum culture conversion . The investigator hypothesize analysis genotypic basis anti-TB drug resistance allow development improve rapid molecular drug susceptibility test detect resistance fluoroquinolones injectable anti-TB drug reduce current XDR-TB diagnosis time three month less seven day .</detailed_description>
