	<criteria>All patient age great 18 year meet criteria sepsis . Septic shock define patient severe sepsis persistent hypotension ( &lt; 90mmHg systolic blood pressure ) despite fluid challenge least 20cc/kg Patients consider eligible enrollment treat physician plan give least 1liter crystalloid initial US perform A number ( approximately 50 patient ) symptoms sepsis enrol assess measurement healthy patient . These patient one ultrasound perform desired study measure . Patients unable provide consent nonEnglish speaking patient patient/health care proxy unable give consent History significant trauma Incarcerated patient Failure complete fluid challenge Pericardial disease heart transplant . Patients leave bundle branch block , pulmonary hypertension , know systolic dysfunction ( Ejection Fraction &lt; 40 % ) , receive vasopressor , know moderate severe valvular dysfunction , irregular heart rhythm enrol analyze separately</criteria>
