	<brief_title>Home-Based Lymphedema Care Program ( HBLCP ) Improving Lymphedema Self-Care Head Neck Cancer Survivors</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To develop home-based lymphedema care program ( HBLCP ) focus self-care head neck lymphedema head neck cancer ( HNC ) patient receive lymphedema therapy . ( Stage 1 ) II . To assess feasibility HBLCP HNC patient lymphedema : 1 ) obtain recruitment estimate determine barrier recruitment ; 2 ) evaluate implementation fidelity ( i.e. , competence compliance ) barrier implementation fidelity ; 3 ) ass safety ; 4 ) evaluate satisfaction . ( Stage 2 ) III . To obtain preliminary efficacy data HBLCP via follow indicator : 1 ) head neck lymphedema ; 2 ) symptom burden ; 3 ) functional status . ( Stage 2 ) OUTLINE : INTERVENTION DEVELOPMENT : A team expert complete development patient self-care video , educational manual , therapist training video , protocol . Lymphedema therapists test therapist training video protocol . Patients undergo train session study therapy test patient video educational manual . PILOT HBLCP TESTING : Participants undergo one training session lymphedema therapist . Participants also receive self-care video educational manual review home . After completion training session , participant follow 1 , 2 , 3 month .</detailed_description>
