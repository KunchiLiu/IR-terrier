	<brief_summary>There question combat domestic attack stressful , effect last month even year , include relive event nightmare flashback , want avoid anything reminder combat domestic attack movie nightly news , jumpy concerned security . When someone lot symptom might tell PTSD , even person n't full condition , symptom affect ability function high level home , work , social setting , put great risk develop full PTSD . While someone go significant stressful event might need long course therapy n't full PTSD , investigator study think work distance smart phone time may decrease symptom , help feel well , prevent full PTSD . Thus purpose study assess brief , relatively simple resiliency enhancement strategy , provide mostly smart phone , affect someone stress-related symptom .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Posttraumatic stress disorder ( PTSD ) identify 10-20 % U.S. military service member ( SMs ) return Afghanistan Iraq , associate impaired physical health , mental health , overall functional status . Resilience often speak , yet prove method promote resilience , protect SMs PTSD , yet establish . One easy effective way identify high risk development PTSD one-page , 17-item self-administered PTSD Checklist ( PCL ) . The total score range 17 85 , score 50 best cut-off make diagnosis PTSD , many military SMs impair function associate score level . There also high-profile fatal shooting military installation recent year , include Fort Hood , TX , Washington Naval Yard District Columbia , incident tend follow persistent symptom many individual vicinity time . There limited recent evidence suggest low intensity intervention might effective subthreshold PTSD , even though necessarily successfully treat fully develop PTSD . We therefore conduct randomize control clinical trial involve 144 individual eligible care military healthcare system report subthreshold PCL score ( 28 49 ) , either within five year return Afghanistan Iraq , affect significant way terrify incident bomb shooting , major natural disaster result significant loss life hurricane , tornado , earthquake . Seventy-two participant assign resilience enhancement group , initiate single 90-minute introduction cognitive behavioral therapy ( CBT ) technique use smart-phone base application ( apps ) promote increase resilience relaxation , biofeedback , psychoeducation technique . Over subsequent 6 week , daily text message participant accentuate positive , include provide recommendation beneficial activity , foster behavioral change , particular encouraging completion smart phone-based application ( apps ) . The control group ( n=72 ) provide initial informational session provide detail get help worsen symptoms time . They receive daily text aphorisms 6 week . Symptoms re-assessed PCL personal computer ( PC ) , tablet smartphone base access NIH Clinical Trials Survey System ( CTSS ) resilience enhancement control group end week 6-week training period . In addition GAD , PHQ-9 , PCL assess baseline 6weeks 3 , 6 12 month . We anticipate relatively inexpensive resilience enhancement program reduce incidence PTSD initial 6 week 20 % compare control group , improvement maintain subsequent year . We expect train program associate reduction incidence PTSD least 10 % follow-up period . Our power estimate indicate 72 participant resilience enhancement control group , 90 % power identify significant difference two group 95 % confidence ( p &lt; 0.05 ) . For approximately 20 % participant ( n=30 ; 15 group ) perform psychophysiologic measure functional MRI brain use Affective Stroop paradigm baseline 3-6 month later assess change resilience enhancement .</detailed_description>

Pregnancy : urine pregnancy test perform female prior conduct image study baseline followup assessment ; woman positive test upon baseline assessment exclude onsite assessment element ; positive pregnancy test identify follow inperson assessment , physiologic element still conduct MRI perform . 2 . Individuals shrapnel , body piercings remove , imbed metal result either trauma surgical procedure exclude inperson assessment due risk displacement metal magnetic resonance imaging ; 3 . Those significant claustrophobia , include limited intolerance magnetic resonance imaging past , exclude inperson assessment , provide sedate medication scan due potential impact medication interpretation scan result . 4 .
