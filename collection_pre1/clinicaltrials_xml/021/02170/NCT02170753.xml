	<brief_summary>Purpose : The primary purpose study determine whether addition thoracic , pelvic , hip manual therapy standard physical therapy ( PT ) approach consist motor control exercise lumbar spine manual therapy well standard PT alone improve thoracolumbar spine range motion ( ROM ) , hip ROM , pain intensity , disability level , perceived change patient chronic low back pain ( CLBP ) movement coordination impairment . Hypothesis : In CLBP subgroup movement coordination impairment , participant receive thoracic , pelvic , hip manual therapy standard PT superior participant receive standard PT alone improve thoracolumbar spine ROM , hip ROM , pain intensity , physical disability level , perceive change two , four , 12 week initiate treatment .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Regional Manual Therapy Motor Control Exercise Chronic Low Back Pain</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This study use 2x4 factorial mixed design between-factor independent variable ( IV ) group within-factor IV time . The dependent variable include hip ROM , segmental mobility thoracolumbar spine , pain , disability level , patient ' perceive rating change ( GROC ) . Hip ROM spinal mobility variable measure researcher , pain , disability level , GROC score measure self-reported questionnaire . The experimental group receive motor control exercise program manual therapy hip spine correspond individual 's unique mobility impairment . The comparison group receive motor control exercise program manual therapy lumbar spine . Both group receive treatment outpatient clinic 2 time week 4 week . All outcome measure collect baseline ( except GROC ) , two week , four week , twelve week begin treatment . All study participant receive motor control exercise program consistent standard care . Exercises targeted abdominal , hip flexor , back extensor , hip extensor , hip flexor , hip abductor , hip adductor , begin muscle test weak clinical exam . Generally , exercise subject begin isolate isometric contraction ensure adequate motor control , progress various degree agonist load co-contraction synergist use isotonic open close chain movement . Instructions gradually increase time tension maximum 30 second four repetition use order provide element graded-activity exposure reflect tonic nature stabilize muscle . Participants unable complete exercise end fourth week instruct progress final exercise independent home exercise program . In addition motor control exercise program , participant receive manual therapy lumbar spine . Standard PT manual therapy limit non-thrust passive accessory ( PA ) mobilization L1-L5 soft tissue mobilization lumbar paraspinals quadratus lumborum . Only participants experimental group receive manual therapy hip thoracic spine accord mobility impairment identify initial test session . The manual therapy intervention utilized hip thoracic spine consider standard care treatment region , could consider experimental treatment low back pain . Regional manual therapy include variety thrust non-thrust technique target thoracic , lumbopelvic , hip joint . Hip-based technique include anterior-posterior hip mobilization , caudal thrust non-thrust mobilization , posterior-to-anterior mobilization perform . The choice initiate suspend specific manual therapy technique grade treatment leave discretion treat therapist ( PI ) . Prior commencement study , treat physical therapist train administration standard motor control exercise manual therapy .</detailed_description>
