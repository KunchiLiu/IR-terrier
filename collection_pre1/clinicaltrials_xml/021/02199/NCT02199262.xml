	<detailed_description>Agitation intensive care unit ( ICU ) describe excessive , usually purposeful motor activity associate internal tension.Agitation multiple consequence . The occurrence agitation episodes problem recognize several year already widely discuss literature . Delirium reversible , global impairment cognitive process , usually sudden onset , couple disorientation , impaired short term memory , alter sensory perception ( hallucination ) , abnormal thought process , inappropriate behavior . The analysis literature previous pilot study unit bring u consideration quality assessment improvement project start aim monitor influence occurrence agitation consequence morbidity mortality patient , impact care delivery maybe economic repercussion . Investigators hypothesize agitation consequence reduce introduction reminder aim guide management agitation . While optimization management relate state ( delirium , pain anxiety ) crucial , investigator hypothesize could prevent agitation consequence act patient environment reafferentation relaxation method . The investigator ' objective test within quality improvement project prospective randomize study : - If reduce number agitation episodes reduce number harmful consequence . - If introduction reafferentation relaxation method ( music therapy reflexology ) prevent occurrence agitation . - If introduction reminder management agitation reduce number agitation episode . Setting : 18 general surgical ICU bed receive 1600 patient / year total 6900 hospital /days /year , tertiary teaching hospital . The ICU divide 6 room 3 bed : 1 window , 1 middle room 1 room door . Each room one clock front central bed . The nurse patient ratio daytime 1:1.5 1:2 nighttime . Nurses work shift organize 3 time 8 hour every day . This study approve head division conduct solely inside surgical ICU . As quality improvement program , consent patient require , accord CEREH /HUG recommendation . Patients : Investigators enroll every patient old 18 year stay 24 hour ICU 1 . First phase : Baseline phase ( Prospective analysis present situation ) 2 . Second phase : learning phase ( Implementation reminder management agitation delirium ) 3 . Third phase : Randomized Intervention ( reminder alone vs addition music reflexology ) Interventions : Reminder : The care giver help diagnosis cause , management treatment agitation delirium reminder . This reminder adapt guideline ACCP SCCM comity . It adapt local need multidisciplinary group include nurse physician ICU . Investigators instruct nurse physician use reminder 3 time week 20 min 1 month . Investigators provide pocket reminder every care giver display poster reminder key point ICU . The reminder also available intranet site introduce SISIF system ( bedside computerize patient chart ) . The music intervention consist two daily session least 20 minute music listening ( classical soft background music ) .The music intervention deliver compact disc player headphones disposable ear pad . The reflexology foot massage technique consist massage pressure precise point feet.This therapy apply 20 minute day ICU patient certify specialist reflexology massage Indicators : Indicators agitation : 1.Sedation Agitation scale ( SAS ) Confusion Assessment Method ICU ( CAM-ICU ) : The SAS scale recognize reliability validity sedation agitation assessment . It single item scale grade 1 ( coma ) 7 ( extremely agitate . Agitation diagnose SAS &gt; 4 . The CAM-ICU score modify version CAM scale adapt intensive care patient . This scale assess delirium ( positive CAM-ICU test ) consider four different parameter mostly focus patient 's cognitive state . It also validate recognize high specificity sensitivity . Investigators analyze presence absence delirium evaluation judge necessary nurse , least shift ( every 8 hour ) . Investigators investigate whether 1. positive CAM-ICU precede occurrence agitation define SAS &gt; 4 , 2. whether low value SAS , &lt; 4 &gt; 4 precede high value SAS . Indicators harmful consequence : 1 . Complications : Investigators register event related agitation episode delirium classify three group . The three group determine potential life threaten character event . One event consider severe i.e . really life threatening ( self extubation , ventilator disconnection , central catheter removal , chest tube removal , trauma , fall bed ) , moderate ( removal nasogastric tube , peripheral venous arterial catheter ) mild i.e . life threaten ( contortion patient bed , patient 's aggressiveness toward staff , urethral catheter removal , electrode saturation monitoring removal ) . 2 . Medication : Investigators register patient 's medication daily total dose ( mg /patient/day/drug ) 3 drug group relation agitation . Investigators compare use medication different study phase 3 different group third phase . sedative : oxazepam , lorazepam , midazolam , propofol analgesic : acetaminophen , ibuprofen , morphine , fentanyl , ketorolac antipsychotic : haloperidol , thioridazine 3 . The use contention method register compare phase study . Indicators adherence : 1 . Adherence implementation monitoring ( SAS , CAM-ICU ) 3 phase . 2 . Adherence reminder 3 . Adherence intervention ( reflexology music therapy ) Indicators safety : Investigators assess occurrence adverse event potentially relate therapy management agitation . 1 . Intubations : study team register number intubation related agitation . 2 . Antagonist drug : study team register use antagonist drug naloxone chlorhydrate ( Narcan® ) , flumazenil ( Anexate® ) biperidene ( Akineton® ) follow treatment agitation . Data collection First phase 1 . 24 hour ICU admission , study team ass demographic actual diagnostic data , past medical history , usual actual treatment , current smoking history , alcohol drug abuse , invasive equipment APACHE II score . 2 . Daily investigator also assess treatment equipment modification , laboratory value variable potentially relate agitation ( sodium , glucose , calcium , urea , creatinine , bilirubin , oxygen saturation , FiO2 ) , fever , occurrence infection , introduction therapeutic antibiotic . The bed location room specify ( door , middle , window ) . Investigators also daily record consequence ( annex 7 ) safety indicator . No additional test exam perform purpose study . 3 . Three time day ( nurse shift ) nurse assess agitation delirium SAS CAM-ICU . Each time attend nurse notice modification degree agitation , register concomitant SAS . 4 . At end patient stay investigator calculate total dosage ( mg/kg/day ) p.o . i.v sedative ( benzodiazepine , propofol others ) , analgesic ( acetaminophen , NSARs , morphine , fentanyl others ) antipsychotic drug ( haloperidol others ) deliver every patient . Second phase In addition data collect first phase , investigator register adherence reminder agitation episode . Third phase Same data second phase . In addition , investigator note daily correct delivery allocate intervention . Statistical analysis power calculation : Investigators use analysis variance ( ANOVA ) Bonferroni 's post-test Kruskal-Wallis appropriate . Proportions analyze Pearson 's 2 . The endpoint study reduce occurrence consequence agitation and/or delirium . The sample size calculate detect minimum mean difference 50 % number patient day occurrence consequence agitation delirium . In preliminary study , investigator assess occurrence `` consequence '' 20 % patient/days . The number ( =n ) patient need detect minimum mean difference 50 % baseline learn phase 219 ( 0.05 , power 80 % two side ) , 219 three randomization group . 80 patient per month present inclusion criterion study . Thus , need 2.7 month Baseline , minimum 2.7 month Learning 8.1 month Randomization Intervention period . All continuous variable express mean SD ( normally distribute ) median range ( non normally distribute ) . A p value &lt; 0.05 consider significant .</detailed_description>
