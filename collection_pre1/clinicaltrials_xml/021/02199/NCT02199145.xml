	<brief_summary>Membranous Nephropathy ( MN ) auto-immune kidney disease common cause nephrotic syndrome . About 30 % MN patient progress end-stage kidney disease ( ESKD ) 30 % undergo spontaneous remission . The phospholipase A2 receptor ( PLA2R1 ) major auto-antigen idiopathic MN . Anti-PLA2R1 autoantibody find active phase MN .

Investigators identify new prognostic factor cohort 41 idiopathic MN patient nephrotic syndrome anti-PLA2R1 autoantibody time presentation . During follow-up least 36 month , 21 patient persistent nephrotic syndrome ( group A ) 20 show partial total remission ( group R ) . We first measure cross-reactivity serum time presentation human , rabbit mouse recombinant PLA2R1 western blot . All patient exhibit reactivity human rabbit PLA2R1 , mouse PLA2R1 . These result suggest presence distinct epitope differentially conserve among PLA2R1 orthologs.Investigators set-up three parallel ELISAs use human , rabbit mouse recombinant PLA2R1 . All 41 MN patient show activity human rabbit ELISAs presentation 32 ( 78 % ) mouse ELISA.They finally analyze association anti-PLA2R1 titer presentation different ELISAs subsequent clinical outcome .

Patients anti-mouse PLA2R1 activity 605 RU ( relative unit ) /ml show significantly low survival without double serum creatinine ESKD , patient high tertile anti-PLA2R1 activity rabbit human ELISA show significant increase risk renal failure progression .

	<detailed_description>Membranous Nephropathy ( MN ) auto-immune kidney disease common cause nephrotic syndrome . About 30 % MN patient progress end-stage kidney disease ( ESKD ) 30 % undergo spontaneous remission . The phospholipase A2 receptor ( PLA2R1 ) major auto-antigen idiopathic MN . Anti-PLA2R1 autoantibody find active phase MN [ 2,3 ] .

All 41 MN patient show activity human rabbit ELISAs presentation 32 ( 78 % ) mouse ELISA . Investigators finally analyze association anti-PLA2R1 titer presentation different ELISAs subsequent clinical outcome . The mean anti-PLA2R1 activity significantly different group A R mouse ELISA univariate multivariate analysis ( p =0.006 p =0.02 , respectively ) human rabbit ELISAs . An analysis mouse ELISA titer define threshold 605 RU/ml 100 % patient poor prognosis , threshold could define rabbit human ELISA . Patients anti-mouse PLA2R1 activity 605 RU/ml show significantly low survival without double serum creatinine ESKD ( p=0.002 use log-rank test ) , patient high tertile anti-PLA2R1 activity rabbit human ELISAs show significant increase risk renal failure progression . The result suggest specific detection particular anti-PLA2R1 autoantibody use novel anti-mouse PLA2R1 ELISA identify MN patient risk ESKD . The aim confirm result prospective cohort.We propose measure prospective cohort time MN diagnosis high titer anti-mPLA2R1 Ab ( anti-mouse phospholipase A2 receptor1 antibody ) associate nephrotic proteinuria ( 3.5 g/g ) increase creatininemia 30 % month 6 , 12 18 . An ancillary study try characterise nephrogenic epitope conserve human , rabbit mouse . Each patient nephrotic syndrome benefit kidney biopsy . For patient conserve 2 dry tube frozen time biopsy . If confirm diagnosis MN anti-PLA2R1 Ab , propose patient include study . He visit every month first three month every three month , collection following : blood pressure , weight , creatinine , albumin , blood electrolyte , proteinuria / creatinine sample 1 assay Ac anti-PLA2R1 3 ELISA ( human , rabbit mouse ) In case persistent refractory nephrotic syndrome 6 month , appearance 30 % increase serum creatinine , treatment rituximab ( 2 Ã— 1 g IV 15 day ) propose . Clinical biological monitoring continue every 3 month 18 month .</detailed_description>
