	<brief_title>Effect Personalized Feedback Report Peer Support Diabetes</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Diabetes self-management often emotionally physically tax , demand lifelong commitment medication adherence lifestyle modification . People diabetes well-educated supported make clinical decision daily live . However , diabetes self-management education ( DSME ) intervention short-term little external support . In order empower patient self-manage lifetime initial DSME , ongoing multidisciplinary program coordinate individual component care structured system support reinforcement multiple contact necessary provide practical tip well social psychological support diabetic patient , sustain behavioral change improve metabolic control . Based principle , Joint Asia Diabetes Evaluation ( JADE ) Program develop 2007 quality improvement initiative deliver technologically integrated multidisciplinary team-based care . It enable web-based portal containing template guide care provider provide standardized comprehensive assessment , result use personalized risk stratification feedback report . The personalized feedback report contain patient 's risk category accord JADE definition , visual display important trend include glycated haemoglobin ( HbA1c ) , blood pressure ( BP ) , low-density-lipoprotein-cholesterol ( LDL-C ) , body mass index ( BMI ) , practical suggestion help individual reach multiple treatment target base late value . On hand , accord recent WHO consultation report , peer support intervention consider enormous potential improve self-management patient chronic disease . Programs use peer supporter teach support peer diabetes show significant reduction HbA1c , enhance self-efficacy , improve health status well self-management behavior . In previous study , find combine program integrates structure care , peer support clinical decision support regular follow report significantly improve psychological health medication adherence diabetic patient , reduce hospitalization patient negative emotion like depression , distress , anxiety , likely suffer chronic kidney disease poor glycemic control . In program , hypothesize use multifaceted program incorporates structure care , personalize feedback reporting , peer support influence motivate diabetic patient high risk hospitalization negative emotion diabetes self-management , improve self-management , psychological health metabolic control , reduce hospitalization . We hypothesize receive personalize feedback report decision support improve glycemic control reduce hospitalization patient diabetes . Around 286 patient high risk negative emotion hospitalization invite join peer support program . We anticipate half patient agree ( n=143 ) assign 24 peer supporter 5~6:1 ratio . Peer supporter patient good glycemic control self-care train provide informational emotional support peer group . For patient decline participate , identify refuse peer group reason decline document . Half patient group randomize receive 2 personalized feedback report mail . 1200 adult patient consecutively enrolled JADE program recruit half ( n=600 ) randomize receive personalized feedback report twice year . All patient follow usual clinic observe least 1 year shall evaluate effect provide regular personalized report clinical outcome include metabolic control hospitalization . To evaluate independent effect peer support , use case-control design . Within 1200 patient offer peer support , group patient meet criterion `` high risk '' match agree receive peer support 3:1 basis age , gender , diabetes duration , baseline HbA1c control group . Data metabolic control hospitalization control group retrieve CMS compare peer group 1 year . The study objective : 1 . To study effect regular personalize feedback report patient diabetes manage within integrated care program hospitalization metabolic control , irrespective risk level . 2 . To study feasibility use trained diabetes patient ( peer supporter ) assist diabetes educator diabetes management . 3 . To study acceptability peer support real life set effect non-participation peer support program clinical outcome include hospitalization glycemic control high risk patient negative emotion multiple risk factor . 4 . To study independent interactive effect peer support regular personalize feedback report cardio-metabolic risk factor control , psychological health , self-efficacy , self-management , quality life hospitalization rate patient diabetes high risk negative emotion multiple risk factor .</detailed_description>
