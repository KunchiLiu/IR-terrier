	<brief_summary>The aim work investigate whether electrical Lateral Cord Stimulation ( LCS ) cause inhibitory modulatory action indirect cerebellar activation , release spasticity spastic syndrome select case patient cerebral palsy</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Lateral Cord Stimulation New Treatment Refractory Spastic Cerebral Palsy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PROJECT Lateral Cord Stimulation think author employed patient spastic cerebral palsy aim improve tonus , motor function speech . Nevertheless , demonstrate act basic phenomenon relate spasticity , 's say propagate spinal response , use could extend form spastic disease , like spastic limb post stroke , brain congenital malformation produce spasticity motor disorder main sign , post anoxic encephalopathy , etc . In preliminary clinical trial , class phase 3 , sample must limited assure stable condition statistical significance , hence group go circumscribe certain condition pathology . In future , long method could spread use , extension indication pathological condition advisable thus , possibility marketing could enlarge use broad spectrum spastic patient . Calculated risk similar related ancient surgical technique call `` Scoville '' technique , currently employ time ago cervical discectomy ( 6 ) Investigational plan The purpose clinical trial release spasticity mean improve condition patient spastic cerebral palsy extradural lateral cord electrical stimulation , use currently employ electrode neurostimulators Those device already FDA approve currently use Dorsal Column Stimulation objective treat chronic Pain spasticity ( Spasmodic Torticollis ) .</detailed_description>
