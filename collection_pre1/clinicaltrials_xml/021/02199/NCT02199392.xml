	<detailed_description>This single-dose , open-label , sequential , three-period study 15 healthy subject assess influence P-glycoprotein inhibition simultaneous CYP3A4 P-glycoprotein induction lenvantinib pharmacokinetics follow single dose oral administration 24 mg lenvatinib healthy volunteer . The study consist two phase : Pretreatment Treatment . The Pretreatment Phase two period : Screening Baseline 1 . The purpose Screening Period obtain informed consent establish protocol eligibility . The purpose Baseline 1 confirm protocol eligibility . The Treatment Phase three period : Treatment Period 1 , Treatment Period 2 , Treatment Period 3 Baseline 2 assessment prior Treatment Period 2 Baseline 3 assessment prior Treatment Period 3 . The purpose Baselines 2 3 confirm continue protocol eligibility . In Treatment Phase , subject take single oral dose 24 mg lenvatinib three separate occasion ( Period 1 , Day 1 ; Period 2 , Day 15 ; Period 3 , Day 43 ) . In Period 2 , Day 15 , subject also take single oral dose 600 mg po rifampin . In Period 3 , subject receive 600 mg rifampin po daily 21 day ( Period 3 , Days 29 49 ) . On Day 43 Period 3 , subject take 24 mg lenvatinib addition rifampin .</detailed_description>
