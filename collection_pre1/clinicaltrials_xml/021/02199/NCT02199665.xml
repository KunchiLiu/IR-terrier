	<brief_summary>This phase I trial study side effect best dose selinexor carfilzomib give together dexamethasone treat patient multiple myeloma return respond treatment . Drugs use chemotherapy , selinexor dexamethasone , work different way stop growth cancer cell , either kill cell , stop dividing , stop spread . Carfilzomib may stop growth cancer cell block enzymes need cell growth . Giving selinexor , carfilzomib , dexamethasone may better treatment multiple myeloma .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Selinexor , Carfilzomib , Dexamethasone Treating Patients With Relapsed Refractory Multiple Myeloma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . Determine maximum tolerate dose ( MTD ) recommend phase II dose ( RP2D ) combination selinexor , carfilzomib , dexamethasone relapse relapsed/refractory multiple myeloma . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . Determine safety tolerability . II . Determine efficacy , measure rate stable disease well ( include minimal response , partial response , good partial response , complete response , stringent complete response ) . III . To perform pharmacokinetic study first cycle dose level selinexor carfilzomib , compare result respective single arm trial . TERTIARY OBJECTIVES : I . To perform exploratory evaluation pharmacodynamics . II . To study effect treatment exportin 1 ( XPO1 ) expression peripheral blood mononuclear cell ( PBMCs ) day 1 day 15 cycle 1 , time progression/relapse . III . To assess clinical response standard high-risk prognostic subgroup base cytogenetics gene expression profile . OUTLINE : This dose-escalation study selinexor carfilzomib . Patients receive selinexor orally ( PO ) daily ( QD ) day 1 , 3 , 8 , 10 , 15 , 17 , carfilzomib intravenously ( IV ) 30 minute day 1 , 2 , 8 , 9 , 15 , 16 , dexamethasone PO QD IV day 1 , 2 , 8 , 9 , 15 , 16 , 22 , 23 . Courses repeat every 28 day absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . After completion study treatment , patient follow 30 day every 3 month 2 year .</detailed_description>
