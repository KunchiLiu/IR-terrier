	<brief_summary>The aim study improve understand molecular mechanism development progression musculoskeletal tumor . These tumor general unfavorable prognosis conventional treatment ( e.g . surgery , radiotherapy chemotherapy ) could enhance prognosis patient last ten fifteen year . Therefore investigator choose new way , try identify marker genetic level , ideally act basis develop new treatment option .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Identification Characterization Molecular Markers Musculoskeletal Tumors</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>To definitely asses molecular marker musculoskeletal tumor identify human patient sample correspond tumor , molecular marker validate animal model . Just soft tissue bone tumor rare ( compare breast lung carcinoma ) , great importance sample patient treat Balgrist University Hospital collect systematically und store correspondingly . Only like valid statement do . Therefore investigator intent collect tissue blood sample patient agree participate study . The sample take routine biopsy operation . To compare tumor tissue healthy tissue also plan take sample tumor free patient undergo knee replacement surgery . The investigator would store surgical waste involve sample analyze . Clinical data regard diagnosis examination finding , well tissue biopsy surgery collect prospectively . The tissue frozen liquid nitrogen accord standard procedure store molecular analyzes Laboratory Orthopedic Research Balgrist University Hospital . The processing involve expression analyze polymerase chain reaction , Western Blot , micro array , immunohistochemistry tissue array . The DNA take blood sample shall compare DNA find tumor .</detailed_description>
