	<brief_summary>This pilot project develop investigate subjective objective data relate pattern physical activity participation among hemophilia patient ( FVIII FIX ) age 5 18 year . Physical activity participation among different level disease severity compare use accelerometer calculate amount time spend moderate vigorous physical activity ( MVPA ) number bout MVPA ; additionally , data collect two validated questionnaire ( PedHAL 3 day physical activity recall ) . Current literature relate level physical activity disease severity pediatric hemophilia population limit . The information gain type quantity physical activity participation child vary level hemophilia assist development education intervention promote good physical activity potentially examine role tailor prophylaxis .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Objectives : 1 . To determine amount time spend perform moderate vigorous physical activity ( MVPA ) number bout MVPA engage weekly basis differs level disease severity pediatric hemophilia population . 2 . To determine recorded physical activity intensity activity self-report questionnaire ( PedHAL 3 day physical activity recall - 3DPAR ) differ accord severity hemophilia . 3 . To determine , among patient hemophilia , relationship physical activity level patient age , weight , body mass index ( BMI ) . Specific Aims : â€¢Aim # 1 : The primary aim study determine difference amount time spend MVPA level disease severity child hemophilia . Secondary Aims : - Aim # 2 : To determine meaningful difference accumulation MVPA ( bout exercise ) disease severity child hemophilia . - Aim # 3 : The compare find Aim # 1 # 2 NHANES ( National Health Nutrition Examination Survey ) data , recognize survey provide comparative healthy normal cohort . - Aim # 4 : To investigate MVPA data collect PedHAL ( 11 ) 3DPAR ( 12 ) disease severity child hemophilia . - Aim # 5 : The review determine relationship physical activity participation time prophylaxis factor replacement whether participation limit day factor infusion . - Aim # 6 : To investigate amount physical activity relate age , weight , patient body mass index ( BMI ) .</detailed_description>
