	<brief_summary>Background : - Many people lose weight change diet exercise . However , people eventually regain weight time . This weight regain may relate change metabolism well change brain cause weight loss . Researchers want learn change . Objective : - To see weight loss regain affect body metabolism brain obese healthy adult . Eligibility : - Obese healthy adult age 18-55 plan participate weight loss program one several participate clinic resort . Design : - Participants first screen home questionnaire telephone interview . - Participants screen NIH blood test , medical history , physical exam , electrocardiogram , questionnaire . They mock magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) scan . - At visit 1 , participant stay NIH : - MRI PET brain scan . - body composition scan measurement . - give blood sample . - eat special diet . - wear physical activity monitor . - provide urine sample body weight daily . - drink special type water measure calorie burn . - wear clear plastic hood head lying , collect exhale air . - spend 24 hour room measure oxygen carbon dioxide . - complete questionnaire computer task . - After visit 1 , participant give daily urine sample weight physical activity measurement home . Then follow lifestyle intervention weight loss give daily weight activity measurement . - Visits 2 , 3 , 4 occur 1-26 month start weight loss program . Participants repeat procedure visit 1 . Visits 1-4 last 4 day . - Researchers track participant weight physical activity 26 month visit 2 .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Lifestyle intervention result weight loss , people experience plateau 6-10 month weight stabilizes many subsequently regain weight subsequent month . This pattern weight plateau regain typical appear independent lifestyle intervention use . The apparent resistance weight loss well understood . We recently demonstrate participant engage intensive intervention employ caloric restriction vigorous exercise profound slow metabolism significantly great expect due weight loss alone . This phenomenon call metabolic adaptation also observe follow weight loss caloric restriction without exercise may persist long weight loss cease . Metabolic adaptation hypothesize limit weight loss predispose individual weight regain , yet demonstrate concept controversial . In addition metabolic adaptation weight loss , brain also adapt way enhance activation reward region response palatable food cue receipt . In particular , brain dopamine circuitry believe altered obesity presently unclear pathway responds weight loss intervention human . The primary aim study investigate metabolic neural adaptation 60 obese adult volunteer participate lifestyle intervention result weight loss structure meal replacement program caloric restriction plus vigorous exercise . The secondary aim determine whether magnitude metabolic adaptation change brain reward circuitry responsiveness food cue relate ubiquitous weight loss plateau 6-10 month rate weight regain subsequent month .</detailed_description>
