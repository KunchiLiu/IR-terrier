	<brief_summary>This study focus cohort 20,000 establish patient care 31 attend physician outpatient , adult primary care practice UT Southwestern ( two general internal medicine one family medicine one geriatric practice ) . The investigator develop implement automate Diabetes Detection Tool ( DDT ) data mining electronic medical record ( EMR ) lab data systematically identify primary care patient elevate random plasma glucose result ( RPGs ) high risk diabetes thus need test . In cluster-randomized trial , primary care provider randomize either intervention/DDT arm usual care . Providers intervention arm receive visit-based , EMR-enabled case identification real-time decision support . Outcomes tracked patient level . All subject follow 12 month assess rate follow-up diabetes test , time testing , rate subsequent diabetes diagnosis , time diagnosis . The investigator hypothesize visit-based provider decision support superior usual care .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Reducing Type 2 Diabetes Diagnostic Delays Using Decision Support</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The grow epidemic type 2 diabetes affect 8.3 % US population present major challenge healthcare system public health . An additional 7 million people undiagnosed diabetes 79 million pre-diabetes , unrecognized untreated progress full-blown diabetes . Although screen diagnostic test routinely available , health system struggle diagnose patient diabetes timely manner . In fact , clinical diagnosis lag 8-12 year behind onset glucose dysregulation , result diagnostic delay presence diabetes complication time diagnosis . Among patient engage clinical care without know diagnosis diabetes , nearly patient random plasma glucose ( RPG ) data available potentially provide valuable , early warning safety signal regard need diabetes test . However , elevate glucose value commonly unrecognized 60 % abnormal value followed-up diabetes test timely fashion . Opportunities exist leverage exist data within electronic medical record ( EMR ) identify patient need diabetes test develop systems-based solution reduce : 1 ) failure following-up abnormal glucose test , 2 ) delay diagnose diabetes , 3 ) frequency miss diagnosis diabetes . This proposal leverage Epic EMR University Texas Southwestern Medical Center ( UTSW ) improve detection follow-up test rate abnormal glucose value real-world practice . The investigator conduct cluster randomize , pragmatic trial compare effectiveness clinical decision support strategy versus usual care reduce failure timely follow-up abnormal RPGs . The investigator focus cohort 20,000 establish patient care 31 attend physician three outpatient , adult primary care practice UTSW ( two general internal medicine one family medicine one geriatric practice ) . Primary care provider ( PCPs ) randomize either clinical decision support intervention usual care . Providers clinical decision support/intervention arm receive clinical decision support identifies abnormal random glucose value prompt provider conduct diabetes screen . Outcomes tracked patient level subject follow 12 month assess rate follow-up diabetes test , time testing , rate subsequent diabetes diagnosis , time diagnosis . Data study eligibility , patient clinical risk factor sociodemographics , provider visit characteristic , outcome ascertain use comprehensive Epic EMR . The investigator hypothesize visit-based provider decision support superior usual care .</detailed_description>
