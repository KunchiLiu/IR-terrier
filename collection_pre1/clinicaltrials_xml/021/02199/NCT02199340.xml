	<brief_summary>The progression lung disease cystic fibrosis ( CF ) result inevitably reduction exercise capacity . The assessment fitness exercise capacity CF important measure impact disease process , particularly repeated time . With recent advance clinical management , CF lung disease child relatively mild exercise tolerance good . The currently available field test e.g . 3 minute step test , often complete easily . These test provide limited information relate maximal exercise performance . By contrast , maximal CardioPulmonary Exercise Test ( CPET ) , progressive , incremental , gold standard exercise test breath breath analysis expire gas , prove valuable mean assess exercise response patient CF . Its limitation requirement specialist laboratory facility , equipment staff . A new field test evaluate exercise capacity child need . This portable , easy administer simple perform young child , provide high intensity exercise correlate day day activity pattern child , clinically relevant information short term longitudinally . This test need good surrogate measure exercise capacity formal CPET unable undertaken . By provide accurate useful information result use prescribe train individual CF safely effectively also use short long term guidance medical management complex patient . The aim study develop validate use new incremental step test ass exercise tolerance/capacity child CF , compare gold standard CPET provide normative healthy control comparison data The main objective study 1 . To develop incremental step test ass exercise tolerance / capacity child CF . 2 . To compare incremental step test gold standard CPET 3 . To assess level exercise response produce incremental step test 4 . To assess correlation independent variable lung function measurement , age , weight height VO2peak exercise test outcomes 5 . To assess repeatability evaluate normal variability new incremental step test 6 . To provide healthy control normative data comparison</brief_summary>
