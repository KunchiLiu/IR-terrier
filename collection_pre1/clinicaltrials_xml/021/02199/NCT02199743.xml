	<brief_summary>24 individual schizophrenia schizoaffective disorder , currently consider stable , recruit , screen entry criterion blind study 4-week randomization either lurasidone , haloperidol , perphenazine examine glutamate-related outcome lurasidone compare haloperidol perphenazine .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Lurasidone Effects Tissue Glutamate Schizophrenia</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>At study start volunteer discontinue current antipsychotic drug ( APD ) switch haloperidol 4mg 5 day . At end discontinuation period , baseline symptom rating cognition test do , well baseline image procedure . At end baseline procedure , volunteer blindly randomize , either lurasidone 40mg ( N=12 ) , haloperidol 4mg/d perphenazine 16mg/d ( N=12 ) . Doses increase 80mg/d lurasidone , 8 mg/d haloperidol , 32 mg/d perphenazine begin week two . Dose stable last 3 week treatment unless side effect prominent , dose decrease 40 lurasidone/4 haloperidol/16 perphenazine mg/d optimal clinical management . The randomization strategy design implement research pharmacist four block six volunteer ; drug dispense research pharmacy accord randomization schedule . The randomization follow four week treatment period optimal dose level . On last two day 4 week stable dosing period , specified glutamate outcome measure complete ( neuroimaging cognitive testing ) along symptom outcome measure , test drug plasma level , usual blood safety measure . Patients see weekly clinical evaluation ; suicidality monitor weekly . All medication study drug discontinue , much possible , 24-48 hr assessment period . After evaluation phase , patient cross-titrated back original treatment medication dose . This design generate outcomes 12 patient lurasidone vs. 12 patient haloperidol/ perphenazine .</detailed_description>
