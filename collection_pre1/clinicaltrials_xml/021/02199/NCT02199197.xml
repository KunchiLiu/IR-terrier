	<criteria>Histologically document adenocarcinoma prostate . Men least 18 year age life expectancy great equal 6 month . ECOG performance status less equal 2 . Metastatic disease evidence lymphadenopathy bony metastasis bony metastasis baseline bone scan and/or compute tomography ( CT ) scan MRI abdomen pelvis within 28 day registration . Chest imaging require clinically indicate know disease chest . Castration resistant prostatic adenocarcinoma . Subjects must castrate level serum testosterone ( le 50 ng/dL ) achieve orchiectomy LHRH agonist antagonist therapy . Previously receive docetaxel healthy enough per clinical judgment decline receive Evidence disease progression recent systemic treatment define follow criterion : PSA : Increasing serum PSA level define PCWG2 , determine 2 consecutive measurement confirm third . If third measurement second , fourth measurement must great second . The confirm third fourth measurement must great equal 2 ng/mL . Measurements must recent value within 15 month ( preferably 14 day least 7 day measurement ) . Measurable disease : great equal 20 % increase sum short axis diameter measurable lymph node development measurable lymphadenopathy RECIST 1.1 Prostate Cancer Working Group 2 criterion . Nonmeasurable disease : Lymph node disease : The appearance 1 new lymphadenopathy , and/or unequivocal worsen nonmeasurable disease compare imaging study acquire castration therapy precastration study response . Bone disease : Appearance 2 new area abnormal uptake bone scan compare image study acquire castration therapy precastration study response . Increased uptake preexisting lesion bone scan constitute progression . Symptomatic bone metastasis Adequate hematologic , renal , liver function evidence laboratory test result . ( Transfusion blood product allow normalize blood parameter within 4 week first radium treatment . ) Subjects previously receive docetaxel ineligible docetaxel candidate treatment enzalutamide alone enzalutamide combination Radium223 Men must agree use adequate contraception begin sign Informed Consent Form least 6 month last dose study drug . Because potential side effect spermatogenesis associate radiation , men sexually active must agree use condom female partner reproductive potential must agree use highly effective contraceptive method 6 month complete treatment . Able provide inform consent sign approve consent form conform federal institutional guideline ensure compliance HIPAA regulation . The presence know brain metastasis , malignant pleural effusion , malignant ascites . Brain MRI require screen clinically indicate . Visceral metastasis assess chest , abdominal pelvic compute tomography ( CT ) ( image modality ) Received systemic therapy radionuclides ( e.g. , strontium89 , samarium153 , rhenium186 , rhenium188 , Radium Ra 223 dichloride ) treatment bony metastases Prior treatment enzalutamide . Concurrent anticancer therapy ( chemotherapy , radiation therapy , surgery , immunotherapy , biologic therapy , tumor embolization ) protocol base treatment . LHRH agonist antagonist therapy , supportive noncancer direct therapy like biphosponates denosumab allow . Prior cytoxic chemotherapy exception docetaxel cabazitaxel . Treatment docetaxel cabazitaxel must discontinue great 4 week time enrollment , recovery AEs grade 1 baseline ( however , ongoing neuropathy permit ) . Major surgery within 30 day prior start study drug Pathologic longbone fracture , imminent pathologic longbone fracture ( cortical erosion radiography great 50 % ) . Prior hemibody external radiotherapy . Subjects received type prior external radiotherapy allow provide bone marrow function assess meet protocol requirement hemoglobin , ANC , platelet . Use biologic response modifier , granulocyte macrophage colonystimulating factor ( GMCSF ) granulocyte colonystimulating factor ( GCSF ) within 4 week prior screen Lymphadenopathy exceed 3 cm shortaxis diameter Any size pelvic lymphadenopathy think contributor concurrent hydronephrosis . Imminent spinal cord compression base clinical finding and/or magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) . Treatment complete spinal cord compression . Any serious illness medical condition opinion investigator , limited : Any infection great equal National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria Adverse Events ( NCICTCAE ) version 4.03 Grade 2 Cardiac failure New York Heart Association ( NYHA ) III IV Crohn 's disease ulcerative colitis Bone marrow dysplasia Fecal incontinence Concomitant use narrow therapeutic index drug metabolize CYP3A4 ( i.e . alfentanil , cyclosporine , dihydroergotamine , ergotamine , fentanyl , pimozide , quinidine , sirolimus , tacrolimus ) , CYP2C9 ( phenytoin , warfarin ) , CYP2C19 ( Smephenytoin ) . [ Note : Patients stable dos anticoagulation warfarin fentanyl eligible , long monitor closely additional INR monitoring ] . Any infection require parenteral antibiotic therapy cause fever ( temperature great 100.5 degree F 38.1 degree C ) within 1 week prior registration . Concurrent malignancy exception : ) cutaneous squamous cell basal carcinoma , b ) adequately treat stage 12 malignancy , c ) adequately treat stage 34 malignancy remission great equal 2 year time registration . Inability comply protocol and/or willing available followup assessment Any medical intervention condition , opinion Principal Investigator could compromise adherence study requirement otherwise compromise study 's objective</criteria>
