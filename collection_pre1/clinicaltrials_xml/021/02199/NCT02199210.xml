	<brief_summary>The purpose project investigate function self-regulatory process anesthesiologists application process influence performance crisis situation.The investigator intend explore specifically first phase self-regulation , i.e . forethought phase describe process related strategic planning , goal setting , goal orientation , outcome expectation . The investigator hypothesize prompt forethought engage simulate massive transfusion crisis situation result well task performance anesthesiologist .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The investigator conduct 3 study building . - Pilot Study : purpose study develop measurement tool forethought , performance tool prompt forethought . This study include 2 attend anesthesiologist 2 anesthesia resident ( PGY2 , 5 ) . - Study I : purpose study validate measurement tool forethought , performance tool prompt forethought . This include 6 attend anesthesiologist , 6 PGY5 6 PGY2 anesthesia resident . - Study II : purpose study investigate prompt forethought anesthesia resident result good performance simulate massive transfusion prompting .</detailed_description>
