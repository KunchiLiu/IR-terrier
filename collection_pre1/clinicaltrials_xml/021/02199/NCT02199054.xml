	<brief_summary>This research study do help researcher develop new dietary option menopausal woman maintain healthy weight develop nutritious snack health benefit . From study , researcher hope gain understanding menopausal woman metabolic syndrome digest absorb food safflower oil combine soy . The research team hypothesize two different type pretzel may process body differently components pretzel snack may helpful prevent disease like obesity cancer . Safflower oil soybean contain many natural chemical may benefit human health . However , relationship well understood . This study look impact pretzel snack blood fat glucose level well group chemical find soy call `` isoflavones '' . Isoflavones natural chemical find commonly soybean food make . Participants screen determine qualify meeting study requirement . Participants know allergy dairy , soy , safflower oil , wheat protein . Also , participant ask stop eating legume ( bean , pea , soy protein , sprout peanut ) document oil eat entire 14 week study . The study require five visit Ohio State University Clinical Research Center ( CRC ) part Ohio State University 's Center Clinical Translational Sciences . Once investigator determine qualify study decide participate , consume three different pretzel one month , start control pretzel . After control pretzel treatment period , randomly assign ( like `` flip coin '' ) start one two pretzel group ( wheat soy pretzel safflower oil ) first treatment period switch safflower oil pretzel second treatment period .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Functional Snack Foods With Safflower Oil Soy Postmenopausal Women Having Metabolic Syndrome</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The overarch goal develop new dietary strategy help postmenopausal woman maintain healthy weight improve availability nutritious snack contain added health benefit use assess impact functional snack snack behavior . The primary objective evaluate safflower oil deliver wheat pretzel compare wheat pretzel enhance soy great affect blood triglyceride glucose level thereby affect satiety snack behavior . The investigator hypothesize functional snack food soft pretzel contain safflower oil either without soy compare control pretzel ( wheat pretzel safflower oil ) reduce postprandial blood triglyceride glucose . This propose multidisciplinary study randomize cross-over trial involve 20 overweight ( BMI &gt; 25 kg/m2 ) postmenopausal woman metabolic syndrome participate dietary intervention study total 14 week ( two week washout three 4 week intervention ) . The study require five visit Ohio State University Clinical Research Center ( CRC ) , part Center Clinical Translational Sciences , Figure 5 . Women visit CRC screen ( Day-14 ) eligibility determine use health lifestyle questionnaire result 12 hour fast lipid panel ( total cholesterol , LDL , HDL , triglyceride ) . Those meeting National Cholesterol Education Program criterion metabolic syndrome exclude condition enrol . Prior oral triglyceride tolerance test ( OTTT ) , woman instruct abstain a. alcohol consumption 72 hour , b. consume ≥150g carbohydrates 24 hour , c. abstain vigorous exercise 24 hour , d. collect urine 24 hour , e. fast 12 hour prior clinic visit . When woman arrive CRC clinic visit , weight vital sign collect venous catheter place timed blood collection . Blood collect serum triglyceride glucose prior ( -5 minute ) 30 , 60 , 90 , 120 , 150 , 180 , 240 , 300 , 360 minute consumption test meal . At run-in visit ( Day 0 ) , subject consume control pretzel flavor oil dip contain standardized quantity triglyceride ( 50 g long chain fatty acid ) . At first treatment period ( Day 28 ) visit , woman randomize one two intervention group ( wheat soy pretzel safflower oil ) crossover safflower oil pretzel second treatment period visit ( Day 56 ) . The two intervention pretzel meal accompany oil dip provide . At end OTTT visit woman instruct continue eat test pretzel ( 12 pretzel bites/day ) next 28 day snack .
