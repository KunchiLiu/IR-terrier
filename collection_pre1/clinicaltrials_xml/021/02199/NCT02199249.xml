	<brief_summary>Tibia-fibular syndesmosis injury occur significant proportion ankle injury assume disrupt syndesmotic ligament . The goal operative treatment reduce ankle mortise restore normal joint kinematics . Syndesmosis repair perform use either open close reduction , combine fixation distal tibia fibula . Closed fixation demonstrate high rate non anatomic reduction great 40 % ; therefore , open reduction perform study . Screw fixation stable concern exist regard potential excess rigidity .

	<detailed_description>Tibia-fibular syndesmosis injury occur significant proportion ankle injury assume disrupt syndesmotic ligament . The goal operative treatment reduce ankle mortise restore normal joint kinematics . Syndesmosis repair perform use either open close reduction , combine fixation distal tibia fibula . Closed fixation demonstrate high rate non anatomic reduction great 40 % ; therefore , open reduction perform study . Screw fixation stable concern exist regard potential excess rigidity . Recently , flexible fixation technique combine anatomic reduction demonstrate improvement functional outcome reduction quality . Both open reduction flexible TightRope fixation considerable support literature cohort study compare open screw fixation randomize control trial . This study multi centre randomize controlled trial compare clinical , economic functional outcome open reduction , flexible Tightrope syndesmosis fixation ( OT ) open reduction rigid screw fixation ( OS ) syndesmotic injury high ankle fracture , involve fibula 1 cm level syndesmosis ( Weber C ( OTA 44.C1 , 44.C2 , 44C3 ) ) . We anticipate recruit 72 patient ( 36 arm ) 20 clinical site across North America . Post operative follow occur 2 6 week , 3 , 6 , 12 month . At follow , radiographic functional outcome assess well documentation cost associate treatment rehabilitation . The research question study answer include follow : 1 . Does open reduction repair TightRope syndesmosis fixation ( OT ) provide good reduction compare open reduction syndesmosis screw fixation ( OS ) ? 2 . Which surgical technique provide well functional outcome ? 3 . Are complication cost associate repair comparable surgical technique ? The null hypothesis difference treatment group term reduction functional testing . The scientific aim study compare : 1. anatomic ( open ) reduction two group use CT scan plain radiograph . 2. post-operative pain functional performance group . 3. rate complication cost method fixation .</detailed_description>
