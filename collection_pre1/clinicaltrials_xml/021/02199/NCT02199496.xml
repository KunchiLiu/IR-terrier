	<brief_summary>Background : - Some people Common Variable Immunodeficiency Disease ( CVID ) gastrointestinal inflammation . This cause diarrhea , weight loss , able absorb nutrition food . Researchers want see drug ustekinumab help problem . This drug block protein cause inflammation . Objective : - To test safety efficacy drug ustekinumab people CVID gastrointestinal inflammation . Eligibility : - Adults age 18-75 CVID . They must chronic diarrhea , unintentionally lose weight last year , and/or need use nutritional supplement maintain weight . Design : Participants undergo follow screen study make sure study good fit medical situation , make sure safe receive study medication test , include test HIV hepatitis . This do inpatient NIH Clinical Center take 5-6 day : - Participants screen : - Medical history - Physical exam - Blood test , include test HIV hepatitis . - Stool test , include time 48 hour collection fat malabsorption 24 hour collection protein malabsorption - Urine test , include pregnancy test woman ability child - Chest CT scan look infection - D-xylose testing , involve drink sugary solution blood sample drawn test carbohydrate ( sugar ) malabsorption - Hydrogen breath test test small intestinal bacterial overgrowth ( SIBO ) test also involve drink sugary solution collect breath sample - Upper endoscopy ( EGD ) and/or colonoscopy look line GI tract take biopsy test . This do sedation qualify gastroenterologist . Participants complete screen meet criterion return NIH Clinical Center follow visit : - First Treatment Visit ( 1 clinic day ) : Medical history , physical exam , measurement vital sign weight , review medication , assessment number consistency stool day . A pregnancy test woman childbearing potential . A nurse give three shot 90 mg ustekinumab ( 270 mg total dose ) small needle inject skin , observe 1 hour . - Week 8 Treatment Visit ( 1 clinic day ) : Medical history , physical exam , measurement vital sign weight , review medication , assessment number consistency stool day . Blood , urine stool sample collect . A pregnancy test woman childbearing potential . A nurse give one 90 mg dose ustekinumab small needle inject skin , observe 1 hour . - Week 16 Treatment Visit ( 1 clinic day ) : Medical history , physical exam , measurement vital sign weight , review medication , assessment number consistency stool day . Blood , urine stool sample collect . A pregnancy test woman childbearing potential . A nurse give one 90 mg dose ustekinumab small needle inject skin , observe 1 hour . - Week 24 Treatment Mid-point Evaluation Visit ( 4-6 inpatient day ) : Medical history , physical exam , measurement vital sign weight , review medication , assessment number consistency stool day . Blood , urine stool sample collect , include repeat d-xylose carbohydrate malabsorption testing , 24 hour stool collection protein malabsorption 48 hour stool collection fat malabsorption . A pregnancy test woman childbearing potential . A nurse give one 90 mg dose ustekinumab small needle inject skin , observe 1 hour . - Week 32 Treatment Visit : Medical history , physical exam , measurement vital sign weight , review medication , assessment number consistency stool day .

A nurse give one 90 mg dose ustekinumab small needle inject skin , observe 1 hour . - Week 40 Treatment Visit : Medical history , physical exam , measurement vital sign weight , review medication , assessment number consistency stool day . Blood , urine stool sample collect . A pregnancy test woman childbearing potential . A nurse give one 90 mg dose ustekinumab small needle inject skin , observe 1 hour . - Week 48 ...</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Study Safety , Tolerability , Efficacy Ustekinumab Symptomatic Gastrointestinal Inflammation Associated With Common Variable Immunodeficiency</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The purpose study assess safety/tolerability efficacy use ustekinumab subject common variable immunodeficiency CVID selective IgG subclass deficiency ( functional agammaglobulinemia ) associate symptomatic gastrointestinal inflammation ( CVID enteropathy ) . Ustekinumab ( Food Drug Administration [ FDA ] approve drug ) monoclonal antibody interleukin ( IL ) -12/23p40 . CVID clinically heterogeneous disorder characterize decreased serum immunoglobulin IgG IgA level . In addition chronic recurrent pyogenic sino-pulmonary infection , many patient develop non-infectious gastrointestinal manifestation disable fatal . Currently standard therapy associate gastrointestinal disease outside empiric nutritional intervention weight loss , anti-diarrheal agent , non-specific anti-inflammatory agent . Recently , gut inflammation complicate functional hypogammaglobulinemia due CVID selective IgG subclass deficiency characterize T helper type 1 ( Th1 ) inflammatory response , excess IL-12 cytokine production associate diarrhea weight loss well reduce D-xylose absorption steatorrhea . This protocol aim test specific anti-IL-12 therapy patient group . It previously show therapy target IL-12 successfully treat Th1 gut inflammation Crohn disease ( CD ) . Ustekinumab , monoclonal antibody p40 subunit IL-12 IL-23 , FDA approve treatment moderate severe plaque psoriasis , active psoriatic arthritis , recently , moderately severely active CD . This protocol design measure safety ustekinumab patient functional hypogammaglobulinemia CVID enteropathy , well measure effect symptom , gut function , expression immune cell surface marker , production cytokine global gene expression blood gut mucosal mononuclear cell , gut microbiota . Patients CVID selective IgG subclass deficiency gastrointestinal symptom malabsorption , maldigestion , chronic diarrhea enrol study . Subjects ( total 10 individual ) receive treatment dose 270 mg ( 3 dose 90 mg either single-use prefilled syringe single-use vial , depend availability ) inject subcutaneously subject qualify nursing staff Day 0 study visit . Subjects receive follow treatment dose 90 mg Week 8 , Week 16 , Week 24 , Week 32 Week 40 follow total 48 week . Subjects study procedures prior treatment 48 week post-treatment , include upper and/or low endoscopy , measure change immune response study evaluate physiologic measure gut function 48 week , well routine safety monitoring throughout study . Gut absorption test perform Week 24 visit . Variables include safety ( adverse event rate ) , clinical ( weight , stool frequency , result gut absorption test ) , laboratory ( lymphocyte cytokine assay ) parameter descriptive summary statistical analysis ( n , mean , median , standard deviation , minimum maximum range ) .</detailed_description>
