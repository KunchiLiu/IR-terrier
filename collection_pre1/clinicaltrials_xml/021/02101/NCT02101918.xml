	<brief_title>Ziv-Aflibercept Treating Computed Tomography Perfusion Imaging Predicting Response Patients With Pancreatic Neuroendocrine Tumors That Are Metastatic Can Be Removed Surgery</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . Estimate objective response rate ( RR ) ziv-aflibercept among patient advanced pancreatic neuroendocrine tumor ( NET ) accord Response Evaluation Criteria Solid Tumors ( RECIST ) 1.1 . II . Test follow hypothesis : baseline perfusion compute tomography ( CT ) parameter predict patient advance pancreatic neuroendocrine tumor ( pNETs ) respond treatment ziv-aflibercept . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . Estimate progression free survival ( PFS ) duration among patient treat ziv-aflibercept . II . Evaluate relationship response rate baseline blood volume ( BV ) response rate baseline permeability surface ( PS ) . TERTIARY OBJECTIVES : I . Determine whether post-treatment change BV express relative change baseline correlate response ziv-aflibercept . II . Determine whether post-treatment tumor blood flow ( BF ) ( absolute measurement ) correlate response ziv-aflibercept . III . Determine whether post-treatment change BF , BV , express relative change baseline , correlate relative change sum tumor diameter ( RECIST 1.1 measurement ) . IV . Determine effect ziv-aflibercept therapy post-treatment BF , BV , mean transit time ( MTT ) , PS 4 week treatment . V. Evaluate change tumor perfusion parameter time progression . OUTLINE : Patients receive ziv-aflibercept intravenously ( IV ) 60-120 minute day 1 . Courses repeat every 21 day absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . Patients undergo compute tomography perfusion image baseline , day 21 course 1 , time progression . After completion study treatment , patient follow periodically .</detailed_description>
