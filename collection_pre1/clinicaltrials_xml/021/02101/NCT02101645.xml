	<brief_summary>The research group choose 10 patient low extremity venous ulcer ( ) , less 5cm diameter estimate one month time re-epithelization . In study investigator follow monitor healing wound effectiveness compression therapy use bioimpedance measurement base method . The investigator also treat wound use periodical low intensity direct current ( LIDC ) stimulation therapy . Bioimpedance monitoring wound stimulation functionality provide purpose build wound patch . The patch feature print 4 x 4 stimulation impedance measurement electrode array ( contact wound surface ) surround 4-part dual purpose counter impedance reference electrode ( contact intact skin surround wound area ) .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Objectives study Primary : Proof-of-concept study bioimpedance measurement base method monitor chronic wound heal assessment efficacy compression therapy . Gathering bioimpedance data patient low extremity ulcer venous etiology heal process . The investigator seek method process collect data find best correlation visually observe heal wound . Secondary : Proof-of-concept study periodical LIDC wound stimulation . The investigator compare LIDC enhance heal outcome appropriate archive data previous study perform TAYS . Other : Analysis receive data reliability evaluation method . Gathering relevant user feedback medical personnel patient .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Male female patient chronic wound venous origin . Patients sign consent participate study . Patient motivate follow instruction give medical personnel research group . Age 18 80 year . Wound ( ) expect heal significantly period 2 month . Wound ( ) locate enough space place experimental wound dress appropriately . Diameter single wind 5 cm wound edge steep . If patient multiple small wound , wound locate within area 5x5cm . Patient adequate vascular supply patient tolerates compression dressing . Patient unstable coronary disease . Subject approve inform consent . Subject appropriately motivate follow M.D . 's instruction treatment ( home ) . Participation another clinical trial involve investigational drug device would interfere study . Patient suffers cognitive problem dementia . Wound expect healed time reserve measurement ( circa 2 month ) . Patient active wound infection increase risk wound infection . Skin change skin disease could alter epidermis electrode site measurement period . Patient cancer life threaten disease unstable condition . Patient pregnant . Patients implantable electrical device . Such pacemaker implant defibrillator .</criteria>
