	<brief_summary>This study determine efficacy momelotinib ( MMB ) versus best available therapy ( BAT ) anemic thrombocytopenic adult primary myelofibrosis ( PMF ) , post-polycythemia vera post-essential thrombocythemia myelofibrosis ( Post-PV/ET MF ) treat ruxolitinib measure splenic response rate Week 24 ( SRR24 ) . Participants randomize receive either MMB BAT 24 week randomize treatment phase , eligible receive MMB extend treatment phase additional 168 week . After discontinuation study medication , assessment continue 12 additional week , participant contact survival follow-up approximately every 6 month 5 year date enrollment .</brief_summary>
