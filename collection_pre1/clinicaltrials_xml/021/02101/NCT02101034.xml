	<criteria>Histologically cytologically confirm diagnosis squamous cell carcinoma head neck . Disease must consider incurable . Incurable defined metastatic disease local regional recurrence previously irradiate site unresectable ( patient decline resection ) . Measurable disease define lesion accurately measure least one dimension ( long diameter record ) ≥10 mm CT scan , ≥20 mm chest xray , ≥10 mm caliper clinical exam . ( Phase I : patient without measurable disease RECIST 1.1 criterion evaluable disease image physical exam eligible well . ) Phase I : ( ) prior therapy metastatic disease allow , include cetuximab . If patient receive prior standard therapy , s/he must offer refuse prior standard therapy . Phase II : Arm 1 : least one cycle prior treatment cisplatin carboplatin incurable disease . Prior treatment cetuximab incurable disease permit . Arm 2 : disease progression least one cycle treatment cetuximab incurable disease . Phase II : least one line prior therapy incurable disease . Phase II : disease must determine HPVunrelated . HPVunrelated SCCHN define either p16negative OPSCC nonOPSCC ( larynx , hypopharynx , oral cavity ) p16negative unknown primary SCC present level 2 3 neck node . p16 assess IHC ; specimen show stain consider p16positive . Minimum 14 day elapse since end prior therapy . At least 18 year age . ECOG performance status ≤ 2 Adequate bone marrow organ function define : Absolute neutrophil count ≥ 1,500 mm3 Platelets ≥ 100,000 mm3 Hemoglobin &gt; 9 g/dL Total bilirubin ≤ 1.5 x IULN except case patient Gilbert 's disease AST ( SGOT ) ALT ( SGPT ) ≤ 2.5 x IULN patient without liver metastasis ≤ 5.0 x IULN patient liver metastasis Alkaline phosphatase ≤ 2.5 x IULN patient without bone metastasis ≤ 5.0 x IULN patient bone metastases Serum creatinine ≤ 1.5 x IULN OR calculate creatinine clearance ≥ 50 mL/min/1.73 m2 patient creatinine level institutional normal Baseline correct QT interval ( QTc ) &lt; 480 ms. Women childbearing potential men must agree use adequate contraception ( hormonal barrier method birth control , abstinence ) prior study entry duration study participation . Should woman become pregnant suspect pregnant participating study , must inform treat physician immediately . Available archival tumor tissue propose correlative study . Ability understand willingness sign IRB approve write informed consent document ( legally authorize representative , applicable ) . Phase II , Arm 1 : prior treatment cetuximab . Any condition impairs ability swallow PD 0332991 capsule . Resolution acute toxic effect prior anticancer therapy surgical procedure NCI CTCAE version 4.0 Grade ≤ 1 ( except alopecia toxicity consider safety risk patient investigator´s discretion ) A history malignancy ≤ 1 year previous exception basal cell squamous cell carcinoma skin treat local resection , carcinoma situ cervix , synchronous H &amp; N primary . Currently receive investigational agent . Patient must history clinical evidence central nervous system metastasis leptomeningeal carcinomatosis , except individual previouslytreated CNS metastasis , asymptomatic , requirement steroid antiseizure medication ( exception Keppra ) 1 month prior first dose palbociclib . A history allergic reaction attribute compound similar chemical biologic composition PD 0332991 , cetuximab , agent use study . Treated within last 7 day prior Day 1 protocol therapy : Food drug know CYP3A4 inhibitor ( e.g . grapefruit juice , verapamil , ketoconazole , miconazole , itraconazole , erythromycin , clarithromycin , telithromycin , indinavir , ritonavir , nelfinavir , atazanavir , amprenavir , nefazodone , diltiazem , delavirdine ) inducer ( i.e . dexamethasone , glucocorticoid , progesterone , rifampin , phenobarbital , St. John 's wort ) . Drugs know prolong QT interval . Drugs proton pump inhibitor . Uncontrolled electrolyte disorder compound effect QTcprolonging drug ( e.g. , hypocalcemia , hypokalemia , hypomagnesemia ) Uncontrolled intercurrent illness include , limited , ongoing active infection symptomatic congestive heart failure , unstable angina pectoris , cardiac arrhythmia , psychiatric illness/social situation would limit compliance study requirement . Pregnant and/or breastfeeding . Women childbearing potential must negative serum pregnancy test within 28 day study entry . Female patient must surgically sterile postmenopausal , must agree use effective contraceptive period trial least 90 day completion treatment . The decision effective contraception base judgment principal investigator designate associate . Phase I Arm 1 Phase II : Known HIVpositivity combination antiretroviral therapy potential pharmacokinetic interaction PD 0332991 . In addition , patient increase risk lethal infection treat marrowsuppressive therapy . Appropriate study undertake patient receive combination antiretroviral therapy indicate . Arm 2 Phase II : patient HIV infection antiretroviral therapy exclude , pharmacokinetic test perform .</criteria>
