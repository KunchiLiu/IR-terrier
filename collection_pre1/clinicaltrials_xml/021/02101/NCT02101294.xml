	<brief_summary>The study hypothesis relationship keyboard layout carpal tunnel syndrome ( CTS ) . Specifically , use standard QWERTY keyboard increase risk symptom carpal tunnel syndrome . The QWERTY keyboard require effort finger necessary perform require work , i.e . data word entry ; 200 percent flexion extension 100 percent distance travel . The purpose protocol evaluate two keyboard layout carpal tunnel syndrome therapy , see efficient keyboard , Finger Relief , use adjunctive tool treatment therapy CTS typist . Subjects receive diagnosis carpal tunnel syndrome medical doctor , contraindicate , receive confirmation diagnosis carpal tunnel syndrome nerve conduction velocity ( NCV ) study participate four typing session compare onset severity carpal tunnel symptom . Testing session alternate keyboard . The keyboard select first type session determine random assignment . Twenty subject complete four type session . The test protocol consist medical history , 3 test subjective pain experience subject ( visual analogue scale / verbal rating scale , hand diagram ) , 2 clinical measure physical manifestation swell associate carpal tunnel syndrome ( water volume/tape measure ) , measure length time spend type keyboard layout - QWERTY TheOrdinals ( Finger Relief keyboard ) .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The current study first clinical study keyboard patient diagnose carpal tunnel syndrome . Previous research compare angular motion finger comparison QWERTY , Dvorak Finger Relief keyboard ( Robertson et al. , 1995 ) . However , study subject diagnosis carpal tunnel syndrome . The type test use typical English word combination letter could easily repeat layout . On QWERTY keyboard , press D E flex middle finger . TheOrdinals letter ( A D E H I L N O R S T ) QWERTY 6 flexion , 1 leave middle ; right middle , right ring , right index , 2 leave index finger . TheOrdinals Finger Relief keyboard flexion extension finger The keystroke note . The goal type pain , change feeling , numbness tingling . The begin end time record manually reference wristwatch clock . Each four typing session range 20 minute ( little typing occur ) hour ( extensive typing occur without report symptom ) . Pretyping measurement activity take 10 minute , include complete analogue scale self report test water displacement test . Following pretyping data collection , subject instruct type change pain notice . Post-typing measurement activity , include water displacement , check swelling , self-report measure also take 10 minute . The subject schedule return clinic sooner overnight pass , swell go . The protocol repeat similar keyboard letter rearrange . On Finger Relief keyboard , press D E require minimal flexion , press middle index finger home row communicate letter . The study population diagnose carpal tunnel syndrome . The FDA ask reference group consist 20 individual ( restriction number men woman ) . There minimum maximum requirement age , subject require history carpal tunnel syndrome similar problem perform type activity prior study enrollment . Each subject confirm history carpal tunnel syndrome , presumably cause difficulty perform typing activity . However type problem require participation . A total 64 subject respond study advertisement . Thirty-three subject enter study . Many miss either NCVS diagnosis carpal tunnel syndrome doctor ( 14 ) . Several respond attempt schedule study session ( 8 ) . A move away area prior study participation ( 4 ) ill participate ( 2 ) . The remainder insufficient interest commit participate four test session ( 3 ) ; look treatment option , rather CTS study ( 1 ) ; advise attorney decline participation CTS study , pending litigation subject pursuing ( 1 ) . Thirty-one subject complete step begin type exercise , include medical history , informed consent , CTS diagnosis , NCVS confirm CTS diagnosis . Eleven withdraw leave test incomplete . Ten eleven dropout employ office work , employ register nurse . Five withdraw prior initiate study session . Six withdraw begin study session complete remain session respond effort schedule remain test . Four dropout start QWERTY layout . Two start Finger Relief . Four dropout complete one study session ( three start QWERTY , one begin Finger Relief ) . Two dropout complete two study session ( one begin QWERTY , one start Finger Relief ) . Twenty subject complete 4 study session include analysis describe late section application . Swelling hallmark CTS , median nerve must compress . Prior study , unknown whether swell could externally measurable least severe case . Although literature suggest swell stage ( 1 , 2 3 ) CTS case , literature designate swell stage . Classic inflammation measure fever ( rise temperature ) , color ( redness ) , swell pain . Only swell pain externally measurable , without invasive procedure . The pre type hand wrist volume base line swell measure . Assuming type cause measurable swelling , subsequent typing session , sufficient time pass swell return base line . Thus , base line define return external parameter ( pain swell ) measure first type test session . Swelling measure compare increase hand volume activity measure water displacement method . Water displacement measure determine increase amount water hand wrist measurement displace type QWERTY keyboard compare typing TheOrdinals ( Finger Relief keyboard ) keyboard . It hypothesize would significant relationship increase amount water use QWERTY keyboard . The data analyze use personal computer statistical software . Calculations difference mean swell pain , QWERTY TheOrdinals ( Finger Relief keyboard ) keyboard complete . Regression technique use estimate differential impact type keyboard swell pain . Means difference regression technique also use examine effect keyboard type duration typing .</detailed_description>
