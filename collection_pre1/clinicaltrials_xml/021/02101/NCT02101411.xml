	<brief_summary>Since thrombus formation complex procedure vivo , platelet function test method vitro might reflect degree inhibition platelet certain level , do't reflect functional status platelet vivo adequately . There variety signal transduction pathway involve formation platelet activation thrombosis . Gurbel et al . first report individual variability clopidogrel treatment response 2003 , propose concept clopidogrel resistance . Different patient receive dose aspirin anti -platelet drug clopidogrel , due various reason bind lack patient antithrombotic effort increase incidence thrombotic event , another part patient easily understood antithrombotic excessive bleeding event , `` antithrombotic individualized treatment , `` accord difference patient platelet drug anticoagulant drug reaction adjust treatment plan , direction antithrombotic therapy future . There number study show patient response Clopidogrel , measure relationship high platelet reactivity clinical adverse ischemic event displayed platelet activity . However , still lack quantitative threshold high platelet reactivity risk associate clinical consensus . In addition , limited data support , measure platelet function -based therapy improve clinical efficacy concept . Over year , 20,000 case report patient numerous study confirm high platelet reactivity PCI stent thrombosis , include cardiovascular event , include increase risk significant correlation . Pharmacodynamic analysis GRVITAS trial show significantly low platelet reactivity associate low risk adverse cardiovascular event . Brar 3000 case patient publish JACC Meta-analysis show `` high platelet reactivity `` patient whose cardiovascular death , heart attack stent thrombosis occur twice rate `` non-high platelet reactivity `` patient . Two new anti-platelet drug ( Prasugrel Ticagrelor ) several recent randomize trial considerable persuasive , include guidance current guideline . Ticagrelor even Prasugrel pharmacodynamic study effectively inhibit platelet , low risk bleeding . Cilostazol old drug , mostly treatment intermittent claudication , recent year also test coronary stent prevent restenosis angioplasty , however , far , little direct comparison Cilostazol Ticagrelor relate article . We design test , addition test high yellow people treat DAPT ( dual anti-platelet therapy ) platelet reactivity ( high on-treatment platelet reactivity ) ratio , population patient ticagrelor instead month cilostazol treatment platelet reactivity change compare two group , even track six month bleed adverse cardiovascular event rate ? Through test compare treatment patient high platelet reactivity strategy appropriate .</brief_summary>
