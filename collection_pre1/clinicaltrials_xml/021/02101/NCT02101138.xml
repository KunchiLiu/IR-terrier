	<brief_summary>Background : - Eosinophils white blood cell fight infection . In people hypereosinophilic syndrome ( HES ) , eosinophil level high damage organ . HES usually treat steroid , steroid cause side effect stop work time . Researchers want see drug call dexpramipexole , develop Knopp Pharmaceuticals , help people HES reduce steroid dose . Objective : - To test whether dexpramipexole reduce steroid dose need control eosinophilia HES symptom . Eligibility : - Adults 18 old HES respond steroid , need 10 mg daily control eosinophilia symptom . Design : - The study last 9 month 6 visit NIH . - Participants screen medical history , physical exam , urine blood sample . - Participants steroid taper low effective dose . During time , blood drawn weekly . Participants take dose 2 week start study drug . - Participants take study drug twice daily mouth 12 week along steroid . The steroid dose decrease time participant see monthly medical history , physical examination blood work . - Just 12 week start study drug , follow test perform : - medical history physical exam - blood urine test - lung function test - electrocardiogram ( measure heart electrical activity ) - echocardiogram ( take picture heart use sound wave ) - bone marrow biopsy ( needle insert hip bone remove bone marrow cell study ) - After 12 week , participant steroid dose taper low effective dose study drug . - Two week lowest effective dose reach , participant return medical history , physical examination , blood work , lung heart test . - Participants respond study drug may able continue receive drug plan separate study . - Four week stop study drug , participant medical history , physical exam , blood test .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Study Evaluate Safety Efficacy Dexpramipexole ( KNS-760704 ) Subjects With Hypereosinophilic Syndrome</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Hypereosinophilic syndrome ( HES ) heterogeneous group disorder characterize peripheral eosinophilia evidence eosinophil-related end organ damage . Although high proportion patient respond initially corticosteroid therapy , high dos often necessary control eosinophilia clinical symptom , many patient become relatively refractory therapy and/or develop serious side effect . Dexpramipexole ( KNS 760704 ) synthetic aminobenzothiazole show safely reduce blood eosinophil count individual amyotrophic lateral sclerosis ( ALS ) several clinical trial . The purpose proof-of- concept study evaluate effect dexpramipexole , orally bioavailable small molecule , circulate tissue eosinophils 10 subject HES . Following completion eligibility assessment , subject absolute eosinophil count ( AEC ) &lt; 1000/uL enter lead-in period , standardized weekly corticosteroid taper undertaken establish `` minimally effective corticosteroid dose '' study subject . For subject whose symptom stable AEC &gt; 1000/uL time enrollment , steroid dose time enrollment define minimally effective corticosteroid dose taper perform . Once minimally effective corticosteroid dose establish , treatment dexpramipexole 150 mg twice daily begin . A standardized corticosteroid taper begin 12 week treatment dexpramipexole determine `` minimally effective corticosteroid dose dexpramipexole '' . Eosinophil count routine chemistry monitor weekly corticosteroid tapering . End organ assessment , include echocardiogram , pulmonary function testing , study appropriate perform study baseline , initiation dexpramipexole therapy , 3 month initial dose dexpramipexole , end study visit . Bone marrow assessment perform prior 12 week dexpramipexole . Drug level assess prior dexpramipexole week 12 week 24 dosing . The primary efficacy endpoint number subject great equal 50 % change prednisone ( equivalent ) dose maintain absolute eosinophil count ( AEC ) baseline ( pre-enrollment ) level control clinical symptom ( responder analysis ) . Assuming 10 patient receive study drug per protocol , least 4 need meet endpoint significantly show ( usual two-sided 5 % level , equivalent onesided 2.5 % level ) least 10 % patient respond dexpramipexole ( exact binomial test ) . Safety assess incidence adverse event ( AEs ) ( include serious adverse event [ SAEs ] ) , vital sign , clinical laboratory assessment , physical examination , electrocardiogram ( ECG ) test , body weight . Exploratory endpoint include determination effect dexpramipexole measure eosinophil activation , cytokine/chemokine profile immunologic parameter , reduction tissue eosinophil .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>INCLUSION CRITERIA : A subject eligible participation study follow criterion apply : 1 . The subject male female , age great equal 18 year 2 . The subject document history HES require great equal 10 mg prednisone ( equivalent ) maintain disease control . HES define 1 ) peripheral blood eosinophilia ( &gt; 1500 eosinophils/microL ) least two occasion , 2 ) sign symptom organ system involvement attributable eosinophilia , 3 ) exclusion secondary cause eosinophilia , parasitic helminth infection , drug hypersensitivity neoplasms , appropriate therapy direct underlying cause 3 . HES symptoms stable current corticosteroid dose . 4 . The subject agree storage sample study . 5 . Females eligible study : ( 1 ) nonchildbearing potential ( i.e. , woman hysterectomy tubal ligation postmenopausal define menses 1 year ) ; OR ( 2 ) childbearing potential willing practice effective contraception abstinence administration study drug 3 month administration investigational study drug ( dexpramipexole ) . Participation Women : Contraception : Preclinical animal data demonstrate fetal risk , suggest may human reproductive risk . Subjects must agree become pregnant . Females childbearing potential must pregnancy test first dose dexpramipexole . Because risk involve , subject partner must use two method birth control . They must continue use method 3 month stop study drug . Two method birth control may select list include : Hormonal contraception Male female condom without spermicide Diaphragm cervical cap spermicide Intrauterine device ( IUD ) If pregnancy suspect occur , subject must notify study staff immediately . EXCLUSION CRITERIA : A subject eligible participate study follow condition fulfil time enrollment : 1 . Lifethreatening HES condition , Investigator opinion , place subject undue risk participate study 2 . Pregnant breastfeed 3 .
