	<brief_title>Efficacy Tolerance Tocilizumab In Takayasu Arteritis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Scientific/Medical Rationale Takayasu arteritis ( TA ) large-vessel vasculitis affect aorta primary branch may lead arterial segmental stenosis , occlusion and/or aneurism formation . The symptom either non specific reflect systemic inflammation , related vascular injury induce organ-ischemia . Even though many patient respond glucocorticoid , relapse steroid-dependence may necessitate use combination therapy . Azathioprine ( 2 mg/kg/day ) methotrexate ( 20-25 mg/week ) use patient TA , induce disease remission prevent development new arterial lesion . The addition immunosuppressive agent glucocorticoid could require majority patient . Magnetic resonance image constitutes interest non-invasive imaging ass arterial change follow-up . The pathogenesis TA include vessel injury mediate T-cells , natural killer cell , γδ-T cell macrophage . T-cells macrophage infiltrates contribute granuloma giant cell formation , produce IFNγ stimulate production pro-inflammatory cytokine . The secretion pro-inflammatory cytokine , include TNFα IL-6 , implicate vascular inflammation injury TA . In light data , several study report efficacy TNFα inhibitor TA , one observational study 15 case case-reports available . The investigator report French multicenter experience infliximab TA . In cohort 15 french TA patient refractory immunosuppressive agent 20 mg prednisone daily , infliximab enable significant improvement clinical biological feature , addition steroid-sparing effect . Furthermore , early response notable , since clinical , biological remission steroid-sparing achieve within 3 month investigator refractory TA patient . The importance target pro-inflammatory cytokine TA recently raise report efficacy humanize anti-IL6 receptor antibody ( tocilizumab ) . Likewise TNF-α inhibitor , dramatic rapid improvement clinical manifestation laboratory parameter note . This early response even long-standing TA disease , also note investigator study previous report , support use cytokine-targeting therapy TA . Like immunosuppressive agent TA , TNF-α inhibitor tocilizumab use mostly refractory TA disease , thus benefit first-line treatment option , particularly regard steroid-sparing effect prevention relapse , could assess . Recently severe relapse ANCA-associated vasculitis , use initial biotherapy rituximab sufficient induce remission permit completely taper glucocorticoid 6 month , comparatively conventional cyclophosphamide-based regimen . Given limited treatment option number TA , multicenter trial may necessary address benefit first-line tocilizumab treatment induce remission steroid-sparing strategy . Hypothesis : • First-line tocilizumab treatment 6 month could permit rapid steroid-tapering induction remission TA . Primary objective : - Evaluation number good responder without prednisone 6-months tocilizumab treatment Secondary objective : - Influence 6-months tocilizumab treatment induction partial good responder 3 , 6 12 month - Influence 6-months tocilizumab treatment cumulative dose steroid 6 month - Evaluate TA global activity associate tocilizumab treatment , questionnaire : BVAS , PGO , Dei-Tak - Evaluate radiological response : PET MRI 6 , 9 12 month - Evaluate biological response - Evaluate clinical response - Evaluate patient ' quality life associate tocilizumab treatment , quality life questionnaire : SF-36 - Determine time recurrence observation period 12 month - Safety adverse event . Number subject : - The number patient 15 patient active TA , protocol non-comparative pilot study . - A number 15 patient choose , rare disease 2 important study TNFalpha antagonist include 15 subject . In study complete partial response obtain almost 70 % patient , concerned refractory patient . In concern tocilizumab , case report available demonstrate spectacular improvement 100 % clinical , biological radiological improvement response seem good TNFalpha antagonist . Thus , investigator calculate least 50 % response first-line tocilizumab could taper steroid 6 month , ± 25 % precision number include patient . Study assessment : • Patients undergo screen visit inclusion visit assess week 4 , 8 , 12 , 24 , 36 , 48 , 60 , 72 . Duration Treatment per subject/patient : • 18 month comprise 6 month treatment 12 month follow-up Duration Trial Recruitment : - 24 month Definitions activity treatment response : • Active disease define presence activity least 1 3 domain ( clinical , biological /or radiological ) Definition activity : - Clinical disease activity define patient present one follow feature : ( 1 ) new onset and/or aggravation carotodynia , pain large vessel ischemic vascular claudication , ( 2 ) transient ischemic episode attribute factor , ( 3 ) new bruit asymmetry pulse blood pressure , ( 4 ) systemic feature absence infection factor . - Biological disease activity define presence 2 follow feature : ( 1 ) VS &gt; 30 mm/h , ( 2 ) CRP &gt; 10 mg/l , ( 3 ) fibrinogen &gt; 3 g/l without infection . - Radiological activity define presence one follow feature : 1. arterial wall thicken mural enhancement resonance magnetic imaging , ( 2 ) arterial hypermetabolism PET-scan , ( 3 ) new arterial lesion resonance magnetic imaging /or PET-scan 3 and/ 6 month . Partial responder define patient response 2 among 3 domain , Good responder define patient patient response 3 domain ( clinical , radiological , biological ) . • Clinical response : ( 1 ) absence new clinical feature ( 2 ) stability disappearance baseline features* - Biological response : disappearance baseline feature least 50 % decrease* - Radiological response : ( 1 ) absence new radiological feature ( 2 ) stability disappearance baseline features* - These endpoint measure collect Adverse Events ( unless meet criterion specify ) . Primary Endpoint : • The main endpoint number good responder without prednisone 6-months tocilizumab . Secondary Endpoints : The secondary endpoint ass : • number good partial responder 3 , 6 , 12 month , • influence 6-months tocilizumab treatment cumulative dose steroid 6 month • TA global activity associate tocilizumab treatment , questionnaire : BVAS , PGO , Dei-Tak ; • clinical response • biological response ; • radiological response : PET MRI 6 , 9 12 month ; • patient quality life associate tocilizumab treatment , quality life questionnaire : SF-36 - time recurrence observation period , - safety adverse event . Safety : Monitoring standard care Tocilizumab treatment , per European SmPC . Investigators must immediately notify sponsor , AP-HP serious adverse event ( SAE ) serious non serious adverse event special interest ( AESI ) . The clinical outcome result clinical assessment diagnostic and/or laboratory investigation information provide reasonable analysis causal relationship therefore report . For serious adverse effect ethical committee research investigator must inform . All SAE AESI ( serious non serious ) , need report Roche within 24 hour . Categories AESI identify ACTEMRA ( Tocilizumab ) : infection ( include opportunistic infection ) , myocardial infarction/acute coronary syndrome , gastrointestinal perforation related event , malignancy , anaphylaxis/hypersensitivity reaction , demyelinate disorder , stroke , bleed event , hepatic event . The Investigators use clinical judgement identify event fall AESI category . For AESI ( serious non serious ) , Guided Questionnaires use obtain follow information . Statistical analyse The aim descriptive analysis determine variation different parameter follow-up evaluate importance . Data present mean standard deviation , median interquartiles , range include miss data continuous variable . Data present frequency percentage ( 95 % CI ) qualitative variable . Kaplan Meier estimation use analysis time occurrence categorical parameter ( pe different response : yes/no ) . The evolution different continuous variable analyze model ANOVA ( random effect ) could normalize necessary . In case failure , rank analysis perform . All test consider significant p &lt; 0.05. `` Perspectives : This first study Tocilizumab TA could assess fist-line tocilizumab induce remission steroid-tapering . This study could ascertain new option treatment vasculitis , rapid induction remission combination therapy obtain steroid-tapering long-standing remission .</detailed_description>
