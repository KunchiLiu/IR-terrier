	<brief_summary>A total 60 patient enrol study : 20 receive surgery beach chair position Trendelenburg 's position 20 patient undergoing cardiac surgery . Regional cerebral oxygen saturation measure continuously surgery . Duration extent deviation individual baseline value record detected deviation treat accord clinically apparent cause ( e.g . hypotension/hypovolaemia , anaemia , low cardiac output ) accordance standard operating procedure ( SOPs ) . Patients follow end hospital stay maximum 10 day surgery . Their level cognitive function test compare data acquire surgery detect impairment , delirium postoperative cognitive deficit ( POCD ) . The purpose pilot study evaluate design conduct project full scale observational clinical study .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Regional Cerebral Oxygen Saturation Under General Anesthesia A Pilot Study</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The primary goal study detection perioperative fluctuation regional cerebral oxygen saturation patient undergo surgery general anaesthesia . These fluctuation monitor use non-invasive monitoring system base method near-infrared spectroscopy ( NIRS ) . Regional cerebral hypoxia consider one possible precipitate factor postsurgical cognitive impairment ( see patient postoperative cognitive deficit postoperative delirium ) , without monitoring may easily remain undetected . A differentiated analysis fluctuation gain calculation area curve ( AUC ) define deviation individual baseline regional cerebral oxygen saturation ( rSO2 ) time . When deviation detect , treat study accord clinically apparent cause ( e.g . hypotension/hypovolaemia , anaemia , low cardiac output ) accordance current standard operating procedure ( SOPs ) re-elevate regional cerebral oxygen saturation ( rSO2 ) within 20 % baseline . Among procedure 1 . Elevation systemic arterial pressure application vasopressor 2 . Consideration systemic ( pulse oxymetric ) oxygen saturation 3 . Adjustment artificial ventilation subject endexpiratory concentration carbon dioxide ( CO2 ) 4 . Transfusion concentrate red cell case Hemoglobin ( Hb ) &lt; 7-9 g/dl 5 . Transthoracic transesophageal echocardiogram ( TTE/TEE ) assessment centralvenous oxygen saturation case suspect myocardial insufficiency apply patient 3 define group need . This explorative project pilot study .</detailed_description>
