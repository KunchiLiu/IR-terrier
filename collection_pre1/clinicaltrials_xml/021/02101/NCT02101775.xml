	<brief_summary>This randomized phase II clinical trial study well gemcitabine hydrochloride WEE1 inhibitor MK-1775 work compare gemcitabine hydrochloride alone treat patient ovarian , primary peritoneal , fallopian tube cancer come back period time . Gemcitabine hydrochloride may prevent tumor cell multiply damage deoxyribonucleic acid ( DNA , molecules contain instruction proper development function cell ) , turn stops tumor grow . The protein WEE1 may help repair damaged tumor cell , tumor continue grow . WEE1 inhibitor MK-1775 may block WEE1 protein activity may increase effectiveness gemcitabine hydrochloride prevent WEE1 protein repair damage tumor cell without cause harm normal cell . It yet know whether gemcitabine hydrochloride without WEE1 inhibitor MK-1775 may effective treatment recurrent ovarian , primary peritoneal , fallopian tube cancer .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Gemcitabine Hydrochloride With Without WEE1 Inhibitor MK-1775 Treating Patients With Recurrent Ovarian , Primary Peritoneal , Fallopian Tube Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To evaluate progression free survival ( PFS ) subject recurrent platinum-resistant ovarian , fallopian tube primary peritoneal cancer receive gemcitabine ( gemcitabine hydrochloride ) combination AZD 1775 ( MK-1775 [ WEE1 inhibitor MK-1775 ] ) compare subject receive gemcitabine combination placebo . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . To evaluate objective response Response Evaluation Criteria Solid Tumors ( RECIST ) 1.1 patient receive gemcitabine combine AZD 1775 ( MK-1775 ) compare patient receive gemcitabine combination placebo . II . To evaluate Gynecologic Cancer Intergroup ( GCIG ) cancer antigen ( CA ) 125 response rate patient receive gemcitabine combine AZD 1775 ( MK-1775 ) compare patient receive gemcitabine combination placebo . III . To evaluate overall survival patient ( max 1-year [ yr ] follow-up ) receive gemcitabine combine AZD 1775 ( MK-1775 ) compare patient receive gemcitabine combination placebo . IV . To evaluate safety tolerability combination gemcitabine combine AZD 1775 ( MK-1775 ) patient recurrent , platinum-resistant ovarian , fallopian tube primary peritoneal cancer . V. To evaluate tumor protein p53 ( TP53 ) mutation ( presence mutation type mutation ) potential predictive factor benefit ( define response progression-free survival [ PFS ] prolongation ) AZD 1775 ( MK-1775 ) gemcitabine treatment . VI . To evaluate p53 protein expression immunohistochemistry potential predictive factor benefit ( define response PFS prolongation ) AZD 1775 ( MK-1775 ) gemcitabine treatment . TERTIARY OBJECTIVES : I . To evaluate patient report outcomes use Patient-Reported Outcomes ( PRO ) -Common Terminology Criteria Adverse Events ( CTCAE ) . II . To evaluate concordance TP53 mutation tumor specimen TP53 mutation determine tagged-amplicon deep sequencing ( Tam-Seq ) circulate tumor DNA . III . To correlate level circulate DNA TP53 mutation Tam-Seq response . IV . Validation phosphorylated-cyclin-dependent cycle 2 ( pCDC2 ) gamma-H2A histone family , member X ( H2AX ) skin tumor tissue pharmacodynamic marker therapy . V. To correlate change pCDC2 gamma-H2AX survival outcome response rate . OUTLINE : Patients randomize 1 2 treatment arm . ARM I : Patients receive WEE1 inhibitor MK-1775 orally ( PO ) day 1 , 2 , 8 , 9 , 15 , 16 gemcitabine hydrochloride intravenously ( IV ) 30 minute day 1 , 8 , 15 . Courses repeat every 28 day absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . ARM II : Patients receive placebo PO day 1 , 2 , 8 , 9 , 15 , 16 gemcitabine hydrochloride patient Arm I . Courses repeat every 28 day absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . After completion study treatment , patient follow every 6-8 week 1 year .</detailed_description>
