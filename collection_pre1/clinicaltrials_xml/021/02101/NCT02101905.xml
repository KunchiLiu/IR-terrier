	<brief_title>Lapatinib Ditosylate Before Surgery Treating Patients With Recurrent High-Grade Glioma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To achieve intratumoral lapatinib ( lapatinib ditosylate ) concentration least 1.5 uM least 70 % patient 3 hour last dose pulsatile lapatinib . ( Group A ) II . To determine pharmacodynamic ( PD ) effect pulsatile lapatinib ( pulsatile maximum tolerate dose [ MTD ] ) epidermal growth factor receptor ( EGFR ) phosphorylation ( use Mesoscale Discovery enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay [ ELISA ] assay total phospho-EGFR ) . ( Group A Reference Group ) SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . To evaluate safety profile pulsatile lapatinib pre-operative patient EGFR amplify recurrent high-grade glioma . ( Group A Reference Group ) II . To evaluate acute late toxicity associate pulsatile lapatinib . ( Group A Reference Group ) III . To determine effect lapatinib tumor cell proliferation ( marker proliferation Ki-67 [ KI-67 ] stain ) . ( Group A compare Reference Group ) IV . To determine ex-vivo sensitivity tumor sphere culture lapatinib . ( Group A Reference Group ) V. To assess tumor objective response rate ( ORR ) . ( Group A Reference Group ) VI . To estimate overall survival ( OS ) . ( Group A Reference Group ) VII . To estimate progression-free survival . ( Group A Reference Group ) OUTLINE : Patients assign 1 2 treatment group . GROUP A : Patients receive lapatinib ditosylate orally ( PO ) twice daily ( BID ) day -2 0 . Within 3-5 hour last dose lapatinib ditosylate , patient undergo surgical resection tumor day 0 . Within 30 day surgical resection tumor , patient receive lapatinib ditosylate BID 2 day every 7 day . Courses repeat every 28 day absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . REFERENCE GROUP : Patients undergo surgical resection tumor day 0 . Within 30 day surgical resection tumor , patient receive lapatinib ditosylate BID 2 day every 7 day . Courses repeat every 28 day absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . After completion study treatment , patient follow 30 day , every 2 month 2 year , every 6 month thereafter .</detailed_description>
