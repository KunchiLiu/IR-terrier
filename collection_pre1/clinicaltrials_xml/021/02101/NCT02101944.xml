	<brief_summary>This pilot phase I clinical trial study side effect best dose wild-type reovirus combine carfilzomib dexamethasone treat patient multiple myeloma come back follow treatment respond treatment . Drugs use chemotherapy , dexamethasone carfilzomib , work different way stop growth cancer cell , either kill cell , stop dividing , stop spread . A virus call wild-type reovirus may able kill cancer cell without damage normal cell seem work best give chemotherapy . Giving wild-type reovirus chemotherapy may effective treatment chemotherapy alone .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Wild-type Reovirus Combination With Carfilzomib Dexamethasone Treating Patients With Relapsed Refractory Multiple Myeloma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . Determine safety tolerability , define maximum tolerate dose reolysin ( wild-type reovirus ) , carfilzomib dexamethasone patient relapse multiple myeloma . II . Obtain evidence reovirus entry myeloma cell via localization reoviral ribonucleic acid ( RNA ) multiple myeloma ( MM ) cell situ hybridization ( ISH ) , active viral proliferation/replication via localization reoviral capsid protein immunohistochemistry ( IHC ) MM cell cycle 1 day 9 bone marrow biopsies patient enrol dose escalation cohort . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . Obtain preliminary data response determine International Myeloma Working Group criteria protocol therapy . II . Obtain overall progression free survival data treat patient . III . Assess cytokine array peripheral blood obtain day 1 , 2 , 9 , 15 day 22-28 cycle 1 , day 1 cycle 2 successive cycle obtain exploratory data regard inflammatory cytokine concentration correlation response . IV . Investigate pretreatment cycle 1 day 1 9 bone marrow aspirate interferon ( IFN ) -beta MM cell potential marker reolysin resistance . V. Measure induction endoplasmic reticulum ( ER ) stress autophagy marker explore respective role MM cell death follow combination reolysin carfilzomib patient treat dose escalation cohort . VI . Evaluate pretreatment cycle 1 day 1 9 peripheral blood explore antiviral humoral response measure production neutralize reoviral antibody ( NARA ) use functional kill assay . VII . Obtain cycle 1 day 1 pretreatment 1 4 hour treatment , pretreatment cycle 1 day 2 9 peripheral blood , pretreatment cycle 1 day 1 9 bone marrow aspirate sample investigate role carfilzomib modulate antiviral immune mediate response . OUTLINE : This dose escalation study wild-type reovirus . Patients receive dexamethasone intravenously ( IV ) , carfilzomib IV 30 minute , wild-type reovirus IV 60 minute day 1 , 2 , 8 , 9 , 15 , 16 . Treatment repeat every 28 day absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . After completion study treatment , patient follow 4 week every 6 month .</detailed_description>
