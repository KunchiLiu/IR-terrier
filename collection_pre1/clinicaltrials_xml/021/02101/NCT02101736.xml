	<brief_summary>This study , `` A Phase II Study Cabozantinib ( XL l84 ) Plexiform Neurofibromas Subjects Neurofibromatosis Type I Age 16 year great '' participant diagnose Neurofibromatosis Type 1 ( NF1 ) type tumor call plexiform neurofibroma . Neurofibromas tumor develop cell tissue cover nerve . Plexiform neurofibromas disfiguring , painful , life-threatening . These type tumor typically respond well treatment approach chemotherapy , radiation , surgery slow growth location near vital structure body nerve , blood vessel , airway . The purpose Phase II Study determine response rate NFI patient plexiform neurofibromas treat Cabozantinib therapy use MRI scan . Cabozantinib think work tumor block pathway involve growth tumor blood vessel supply tumor . Cabozantinib consider experimental approve Food Drug Administration ( FDA ) .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Cabozantinib Plexiform Neurofibromas ( PN ) Subjects With NF1 ( 16 Years + )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This phase II open label study evaluate adolescent adults neurofibromatosis type-1 ( NF1 ) plexiform neurofibromas treat cabozantinib ( XL184 ) . This study enroll subject either meet clinical diagnostic criterion identify pathogenetic NF1 mutation . Subjects study must clinically significant plexiform neurofibroma define potentially life-threatening , impinge vital structure significantly impair quality life pain symptom . Patients must lesion suspicious malignant tumor MPNSTs ( malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumor ) suspicious tumor must prove negative histopathology prior enrollment study . This study open patient ≥16 year age meet eligibility criterion . The study Simon two-stage study design . It single-arm open-label study cabozantinib primary endpoint ORR cabozantinib 1 year . In first stage , 9 evaluable subject accrue . If least 1 response , accrual continue second stage additional 8 evaluable subject enrol . To allow 10 % unevaluable subject , maximum 19 subject enrol . Radiographic response evaluate primary endpoint 20 % volumetric MRI response target lesion threshold criterion tumor response . A target lesion select time enrollment tumor evaluation occur serially study . All subject start cabozantinib 40 mg . The publish MTD Cabozantinib 140 mg current recommend dose Phase 3 clinical trial subject medullary thyroid cancer 100 mg. Doses 40 mg 60 mg continue show efficacy on-going phase 2 phase 3 trial reduce toxicity . Subjects tolerate 40 mg 2 cycle escalate 60 mg . The rationale majority subject develop toxicity &gt; 2 week drug cabozantinib long half-life . Subjects experience dose-limiting toxicity 40 mg dose reduce 20 mg toxicity resolve . Subjects without toxicity 40mg increase 60mg . Subjects experience toxicity 60 mg dose reduce 40 mg . This dose schema design maximize safety tolerability new population patient . Subjects enter trial carefully monitor development cabozantinib associate toxicity , target modification interruption perform . In consent subject enter trial complete pharmacokinetic profile cabozantinib administration evaluate . In addition , cytokine endothelial progenitor cell biomarkers draw assess treatment effect correlate response . In addition , since plexiform neurofibroma may significantly impact live patient NF1 , study evaluate effect disease treatment Cabozantinib quality life ( QOL ) subject assess NF1 disease-related QOL , pain intensity , pain interference .</detailed_description>

At least 7 day since completion hematopoietic growth factor . 11 . At least 14 day since completion biologic agent . 12 . At least 4 week since receive investigational drug . 13 . Physiologic stress dos steroids allow patient endocrine deficiency . 14 . At least 6 month radiation therapy index tumor least 6 week radiation area outside index plexiform neurofibroma . 15 . At least 2 week surgery AND recover effect surgery . 16 . Adequate bone marrow function . 17 . Adequate renal function . 18 . Adequate liver function . 19 . Blood pressure within upper limit normal . 1 . Active optic glioma lowgrade glioma require treatment chemotherapy radiation therapy . 2 . Malignant glioma , malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumor , malignancy require treatment last 12 month . 3 . Dental brace prosthesis interfere volumetric analysis neurofibroma ( ) . 4 . Unable swallow tablet . 5 . Women pregnant breastfeeding . 6 . Subjects reproductive potential agree use effective contraception . 7 . Subject recover baseline CTCAE ≤ Grade 1 toxicity due prior therapy except alopecia nonclinically significant AEs . 8 . Subject require anticoagulant . Low dose aspirin , lowdose warfarin , prophylactic low molecular weight heparin permit . 9 . Concomitant treatment strong CYP3A4 inducer inhibitor . 10 . History noncompliance medical regimen 11 . A known history HIV seropositivity know immunodeficiency . HIV test require part trial , unless HIV clinically suspect . 12 . Impairment gastrointestinal function gastrointestinal disease may affect absorption cabozantinib . ( e.g . ulcerative disease , malabsorption syndrome , small bowel resection ) . NG tube allow . 13 . Patients uncontrolled infection . 14 . Clinicallysignificant gastrointestinal bleeding within 6 month first dose study treatment 15 . Hemoptysis ≥0.5 teaspoon ( 2.5 mL ) red blood within 3 month first dose study treatment 16 . Any sign indicative pulmonary hemorrhage within 3 month first dose study treatment 17 . Radiographic evidence cavitating pulmonary lesion ( ) . 18 . Concurrent severe and/or uncontrolled medical disease could compromise participation study ( e.g . uncontrolled diabetes , uncontrolled hypertension , severe infection , severe malnutrition , chronic liver renal disease , active upper GI tract ulceration ) 19 . Cardiovascular disorder include : Congestive heart failure ( CHF ) : New York Heart Association ( NYHA ) Class III ( moderate ) Class IV ( severe ) time screen Concurrent uncontrolled hypertension define sustain BP &gt; 140 mm Hg systolic , &gt; 90 mm Hg diastolic despite optimal antihypertensive treatment within 7 day first dose study treatment Any history congenital long QT syndrome Baseline QTc interval &gt; 470 msec woman &gt; 450 msec men Concomitant treatment medication prolong QT interval know risk Torsades de Pointes contraindicate , avoid possible require frequent EKG monitoring .
