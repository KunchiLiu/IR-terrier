	<brief_summary>A double-blind , randomize , placebo-controlled , dose-finding study investigate safety efficacy Lybridos domestic set healthy female subject hypoactive sexual desire disorder maladaptive activity sexual inhibitory mechanism . This 2-arm placebo Lybridos ( 0.5 mg testosterone + buspirone 10 mg ) extension study EB90 ( Clinical Study Protocol EB90a , version 3.0 , 07 June 2013 ) . In present study , efficacy Lybridos evaluate domestic setting healthy female subject HSDD maladaptive activity sexual inhibitory mechanism ( ) . Sexual satisfaction aspect sexual functioning measure within 24 hour sexual activity . The following hypothesis test : Lybridos , compare placebo , significantly increase number satisfy sexual event . Objectives : To investigate efficacy Lybridos compare placebo increase number satisfactory sexual episode healthy female subject hypoactive sexual desire disorder ( HSDD ) maladaptive activity sexual inhibitory mechanism - To identify optimal dose Lybridos take phase 3 clinical development - To confirm Lybridos superior efficacy compare testosterone alone buspirone alone - To evaluate effect Lybridos measure scale sexual satisfaction and/or sexual desire/arousal - To evaluate safety profile Lybridos</brief_summary>
