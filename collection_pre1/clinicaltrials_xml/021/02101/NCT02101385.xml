	<detailed_description>OUTLINE : This multi-center trial . SEQUENCING : DNA archive tumor sample collect time surgery ( residual disease post neoadjuvant chemotherapy ) extract sequence . The result sequence data interrogate known genomic driver sensitivity resistance exist FDA approve agent . CANCER GENOMICS TUMOR BOARD ( CGTB ) : Realizing optimal treatment recommendation make base sequence data alone , CGTB responsible final treatment recommendation . The CGTB consider genomic data along patient 's prior treatment history , ongoing toxicity , comorbidities . Preference give treatment identify sequence data unless significant clinical safety contraindication exist therapy . All participant investigator blind sequence result CGTB deliberation time relapse . PARTICIPANTS WITH A CGTB TREATMENT RECOMMENDATION : Participants CGTB recommendation randomize Experimental Arm A ( genomically direct monotherapy ) Control Arm B ( standard therapy ) . EXPERIMENTAL ARM A ( GENOMICALLY DIRECTED MONOTHERAPY ) : Participants randomize Experimental Arm A receive FDA approve drug standard dose four cycle ( 12-16 week total duration , depend cycle length ) . Clinical laboratory monitor dose-reductions follow FDA package insert guideline . TOP GENOMIC ACTIONABLE BIOMARKERS/PATHWAYS AND DRUG RECOMMENDATIONS : 1 . PIK3CA , PTEN : Everolimus 2 . TOP2A : Doxorubicin 3 . PARP1 , BRCA1 : Cisplatin Olaparib 4 . VEGFA : Bevacizumab 5 . TYMP : Capecitabine 6 . SSTR2 : Octreotide 7 . MGMT : Temozolomide 8 . MYC : Paclitaxel 9 . EGFR : Cetuximab 10 . COX2 : Celecoxib 11. hENT : Gemcitabine 12 . MET : Crizotinib CONTROL ARM B ( STANDARD THERAPY ) ; Recently , randomize phase III trial 900 HER2-negative patient demonstrate improvement disease-free survival ( DFS ) overall survival ( OS ) addition 8 cycle capecitabine post-neoadjuvant setting . The hazard ratio also significant triple negative subgroup . Thus , capecitabine consider standard option set . As represent single trial ( prior data demonstrate benefit addition capecitabine neoadjuvant adjuvant setting unselected patient ) , observation consider option direct treat physician . While recommend , therapy use deem appropriate treating physician . In event disease progression control arm , patient sequence result forward treat physician . PARTICIPANTS WITH NO CGTB RECOMMENDATION : Participants may CGTB recommendation either 1 ) sequence identify match drug 2 ) match drug contraindicate . These participant assign Control Arm B treat describe Control Arm B . As outcome participant without 'actionable ' genomically direct therapy may differ , primary analysis include participant randomize Control Arm B . Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group ( ECOG ) performance status 0 1 within 14 day prior study registration Life Expectancy : Not Specified Adequate laboratory value must obtain within 14 day prior study registration : Hematopoietic : - Hemoglobin ( Hgb ) ≥ 9.0 g/dL - Platelets ≥ 100 K/mm3 - Absolute neutrophil count ( ANC ) ≥ 1.5 K/mm3 Hepatic : - Bilirubin ≤ 1.5 x ULN ( except participant document Gilbert 's disease , must total bilirubin ≤ 3.0 mg/dL ) - Aspartate aminotransferase ( AST , SGOT ) ≤ 2.5 x ULN - Alanine aminotransferase ( ALT , SGPT ) ≤ 2.5 x ULN Renal : - Calculated creatinine clearance ≥ 50 cc/min use Cockcroft-Gault formula Cardiac : - Left ventricular ejection fraction within normal limit obtain within 30 day prior study registration . NOTE : Participants unstable angina myocardial infarction within 12 month study registration exclude . - No clinically significant arrhythmia baseline ECG abnormalities opinion treat physician</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Must histologically cytologically confirm triple negative ( ER/PR/HER2 ) invasive breast cancer , clinical stage IIII diagnosis ( AJCC 6th edition ) base initial evaluation physical examination and/or breast image prior study registration . NOTE : ER , PR HER2 status confirm central pathology review prior randomization . ER PR consider negative ≤ 1 % cell stain weakly positive . HER2 consider negative score 0 1+ immunohistochemistry ( IHC ) 2+ IHC associate fluorescence situ hybridization ( FISH ) ratio &lt; 2.0 &lt; 6 copy per cell . Must complete preoperative ( neoadjuvant ) chemotherapy . NOTE : Acceptable preoperative regimen include anthracycline taxane , . Participants receive preoperative therapy part clinical trial may enroll . Participants may receive adjuvant chemotherapy surgery prior randomization . Bisphosphonate use allow . Must complete definitive resection primary tumor . The recent surgery breast cancer must complete least 14 day prior ( 84 day prior ) study registration . NOTE : Negative margin invasive ductal carcinoma situ ( DCIS ) desirable , however participant positive margin may enroll treatment team believe surgery possible patient receive radiotherapy . Participants margin positive lobular carcinoma situ ( LCIS ) eligible . Either mastectomy breast conserving surgery ( include lumpectomy partial mastectomy ) acceptable . Must significant residual invasive disease time definitive surgery follow preoperative chemotherapy . Significant residual disease define least one following : Residual Cancer Burden ( RBC ) classification II III6 Residual invasive disease breast measure least 2 cm . The presence DCIS without invasion qualify residual disease breast . Residual invasive disease breast measure least 1cm lymph node involvement ( include metastasis lymph node detected immunohistochemistry ) . Any lymph node involvement result 20 % cellularity great regardless primary tumor site involvement ( include residual disease breast ) . Must FFPE tumor block tumor cellularity 20 % great . NOTE : Prior randomization , tumor cellularity confirm central pathology review percent value double check Paradigm ( Next Generation Sequencing Company ) . BREAST RADIOTHERAPY : Whole breast radiotherapy require participant underwent breastconserving therapy , include lumpectomy partial mastectomy . Participants must complete radiotherapy least 14 day prior ( 84 day prior ) study registration . Postmastectomy radiotherapy require participant primary tumor ≥ 5 cm involvement ≥ 4 lymph node . For participant primary tumor &lt; 5 cm &lt; 4 involved lymph node , provision postmastectomy radiotherapy discretion treat physician . Study registration must occur within 84 day completion radiation . For radiation require prior surgery , participant must register within 84 day surgery . Also , participant situation would require additional postmastectomy radiation therapy . For participant require radiation , registration must within 84 day surgery . Age ≥ 18 year time consent . Written inform consent HIPAA authorization release personal health information . HIPAA authorization may include informed consent may obtain separately . NOTE : Central pathology review may conduct time definitive surgery . Consenting participant may preregistered study proceed central pathology review full eligibility confirm . However ALL eligibility criterion must meet formal study registration complete prior submission sample sequence . Must consent allow submission adequate archive tumor tissue sample definitive surgery genomic assessment tumor . Must consent collection whole blood sample genomic analysis Women men childbearing potential must willing use effective method contraception ( e.g . hormonal barrier method birth control ; abstinence ) time consent sign 4 week protocol therapy discontinuation . Women childbearing potential must negative pregnancy test within 30 day prior study registration . Women counsel regard acceptable birth control method utilize time screen start treatment . If prior treatment discussion subject felt treat physician possibility subject pregnant pregnancy test repeat . Women childbearing potential must negative pregnancy test within 30 day prior study registration . Women must breastfeed . No stage IV ( metastatic ) disease , however specific stag study require absence symptom physical exam finding would suggest distant disease . No treatment investigational agent within 30 day prior study registration . No history chronic hepatitis B untreated hepatitis C. No clinically significant infection judge treat physician . No active second malignancy ( except nonmelanomatous skin cancer incidental prostate cancer find cystectomy ) : Active second malignancy define current need cancer therapy high possibility ( &gt; 30 % ) recurrence study . Previous contralateral breast cancer allowable unless meet `` active '' criterion state .</criteria>
