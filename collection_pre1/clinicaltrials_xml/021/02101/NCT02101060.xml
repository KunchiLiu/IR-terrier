	<brief_summary>Research need determine safe effective exercise rehabilitation program prevent improve physical disability old adult live HIV . This problem great importance VA . The majority 25 thousand HIV-infected veteran 50 year age ( 64 % ) . The combined effect age inflammation increase risk physical disability old HIV-infected veteran . This translational exercise training trial examine cardiac skeletal muscle effect combine aerobic exercise resistance training attenuate functional decline age HIV reduce deleterious consequence chronic inflammation . Findings guide future rehabilitation research cardiac remodel inflammation skeletal muscle . The propose research advance goal develop effective rehabilitation strategy improve health old HIV-infected veteran .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The objective study determine effect exercise training central ( cardiovascular ) peripheral ( muscular ) impairment underlie poor physical function compare old HIV-infected veteran randomize combine aerobic resistance exercise training versus usual care . The study hypothesis progressive aerobic resistance rehabilitation program increase aerobic capacity muscle strength , mediate improved diastolic function , increase muscle mass , decrease systemic inflammation . To test hypothesis , investigator conduct randomize 16-week trial progressive aerobic resistance training versus usual care control 40 sedentary old ( 50+ year ) HIV-infected veteran . The study determine effect exercise train aerobic capacity diastolic function , relationship change biomarkers systemic inflammation cardiac fibrosis ( AIM 1 ) . The study also determine effect exercise training strength muscle mass , relationship change biomarkers systemic inflammation ( AIM 2 ) .</detailed_description>
