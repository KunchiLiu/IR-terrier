	<brief_summary>Cellceutix Corporation create new chemical entity treatment psoriasis , term Prurisol™ , ester abacavir . This first-in-human study Prurisol ( abacavir acetate ) perform evaluate pharmacokinetics , safety tolerance single oral dos Prurisol administer healthy volunteer bioequivalence abacavir sulfate ( Ziagen ) . This study follow 505 ( b ) ( 2 ) Phase 2 trial patient moderate severe plaque psoriasis .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Bioequivalence Pharmacokinetic Study Prurisol™ Abacavir Sulfate Healthy Volunteers</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Prurisol™ , abacavir acetate , ester abacavir . Prurisol believe act immune response modifier certain condition , include psoriasis . Abacavir synthetic nucleoside analogue . Ziagen , abacavir sulfate , develop market treatment HIV-1 infection decade . Ziagen inhibit viral DNA synthesis . Consequently , Prurisol consideration possible new therapy moderate severe plaque psoriasis . The nonclinical efficacy Prurisol demonstrate human psoriatic skin xenograft model irradiate severe combine immune deficient mouse . Histologic well visual observation confirm treatment benefit Prurisol animal model . Interleukin-20 ( IL-20 ) recently discover cytokine displaying increase level psoriatic lesion , level IL-20 show decrease anti-psoriasis treatment correlate clinical improvement . IL-20 suggest specific target psoriasis treatment . In comparison vehicle-treated animal , mice transplant human psoriatic tissue treat Prurisol significant reduction plasma IL-20 level great see methotrexate treatment . The expression PRINS ( psoriasis susceptibility-related RNA gene induce stress ) significantly low twice daily Prurisol treatment compare control . This study design open-label , randomize , 2-period , 2-treatment , 2-sequence , single-dose intensive pharmacokinetic ( PK ) study conduct healthy volunteer . In addition , lead-in dosing period allow evaluation PK abacavir 3 escalate single dos Prurisol ( 50mg , 100mg , 200mg ) . Completion dose cohort follow 24-hour safety evaluation period move high dose . Adverse Events , vital sign , physical examination , safety laboratory test ( clinical chemistry hematology ) dose cohort review prior dose escalation next cohort . For subject complete first part , 5 21 day washout period next dose study drug . Subjects randomly assign receive either single dose 350mg Prurisol 300mg Ziagen second dosing period . After 5 21 day washout period , subject receive alternate treatment third dosing period . Blood sample PK analysis obtain 24 hour period dose . Safety tolerability assess ascertainment adverse event , result clinical laboratory test physical examination .</detailed_description>
