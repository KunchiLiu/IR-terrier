	<brief_summary>This trial evaluate surgeon-modified fenestrated-branched stent-grafts ( sm-FBSG ) Abdominal Aortic Aneurysms ( AAA ) custom-made intra-operatively wait period qualify vascular surgeon . In addition , aim examine alternative sm-FBSG patient restrict access center perform clinical trial commercially available device patient aortic emergency .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Complex aortic aneurysm involve renal visceral artery , open repair aneurysms require extensive dissection , aortic clamp renal mesenteric artery , possible reconstruction aortic branch . Recovery time tend longer , include hospital day , endovascular repair , great potential complication . Many high-risk patient aneurysms abdominal aorta ( AAA ) , include thoracoabdominal aortic aneurysm ( TAAA ) , significant co-morbidities deny elective open surgery heighten risk associate open repair complex aneurysm , therefore , potential benefit endovascular option increase well . Endovascular aneurysm repair show effective alternative treating uncomplicated infrarenal thoracic aneurysm elective urgent setting , yet limited experience technology complex condition . Fenestrated graft develop minimally invasive treatment patient complex aortic aneurysm unfit traditional open surgery . Surgeon-modified fenestrated-branch stent graft ( sm-FBSG ) branch visceral vessel custom-made qualified vascular surgeon patient complex aortic condition . It expect minimize surgical risk promote quicker recovery , could represent therapeutic option high-risk patient unfit open surgery .</detailed_description>
