	<brief_summary>Decreased muscle strength report factor contribute increase incidence fall elderly patient cause fracture , joint dislocation , severe soft tissue lesion head trauma . Parkinson 's Disease ( PD ) patient often complain weakness report reduced muscle strength , decrease rate force development , impaired ability maintain constant force , increase muscle coactivation balance perturbation task . The specific cause weakness know , study investigator analyze measure isokinetic muscle strength PD patient clarify issue . The investigator compare data obtain age-matched control .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Determination Muscle Strength Parkinsonian Patients Through Use Isokinetic Dynamometer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>An isokinetic muscle action define performance constant speed velocity . The laboratory measurement isokinetic strength provide torque measurement throughout active range motion maximal effort . Torque force rotate axis produce record angular motion . Consequently , peak torque index muscular strength . Isokinetic testing introduce quantitative measurement statistic dynamic muscular contraction variable involve ( resistance , limb velocity , joint position ) control . This isokinetic muscle test allows objective , valid , reliable measurement force produce skeletal muscle exercise constant velocity accommodate resistance appropriate measure muscle strength muscle endurance across disability spectrum . Decreased muscle strength report factor contribute increase incidence fall elderly patient cause fracture , joint dislocation , severe soft tissue lesion head trauma . Parkinson 's Disease ( PD ) patient often complain weakness report reduced muscle strength , decrease rate force development , impaired ability maintain constant force , increase muscle coactivation balance perturbation task . The specific cause weakness know , study investigator analyze measure isokinetic muscle strength PD patient clarify issue . investigator compare data obtain age-matched control .</detailed_description>
