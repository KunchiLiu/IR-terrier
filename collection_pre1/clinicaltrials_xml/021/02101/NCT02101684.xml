	<brief_summary>Granulosa Cell ovarian carcinoma infrequent subtype neoplasia well differentiate epithelial tumor . They account 5 % ovarian malignancy , incidence 0.4-1.2 case per 100000 habitant , consider rare disease . Though case identify initial stage cure surgical resection , distant recurrence document even 10 year resect primary tumor . At advanced stage lethal disease . Unfortunately low incidence disease randomize clinical trial lack . In fact current evidence treatment provide case report , retrospective study phase II clinical trial perform one decade ago . Orteronel , novel , orally active , selective inhibitor 17,20-lyase , developed endocrine therapy relevant hormone-sensitive cancer prostate cancer breast cancer . Orteronel expect suppress sex hormone level circulation relevant hormone-dependent malignant tissue . Since sex hormone overproduction demonstrate granulosa cell ovarian tumor seem play major role disease , study ass efficacy orteronel treat tumor .</brief_summary>
