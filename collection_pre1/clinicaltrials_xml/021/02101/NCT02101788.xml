	<brief_title>Trametinib Treating Patients With Recurrent Progressive Low-Grade Ovarian Cancer Peritoneal Cavity Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To estimate progression-free survival ( PFS ) hazard ratio trametinib compare `` commercially available therapy '' consist one five commercially available agent woman recurrent low-grade serous carcinoma ovary peritoneum previously treat platinum-based chemotherapy . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . To determine nature , frequency maximum degree toxicity assess Common Terminology Criteria Adverse Events ( CTCAE ) version ( v ) 4 treatment arm . II . To determine quality life , assess Functional Assessment Cancer Therapy-Ovarian ( FACT-O ) . III . To compare trametinib control arm regard patient ' self-reported acute ( post-cycle 6 ) quality life measure FACT-O-Trial Outcome Index ( TOI ) . IV . To compare trametinib control arm regard patient ' self-reported acute ( post-cycle 6 ) neurotoxicity measure FACT-Gynecologic Oncology Group ( GOG ) -Neurotoxicity ( NTX ) . V. To estimate objective response rate ( RR ) patient treatment arm . TERTIARY OBJECTIVES : I . To estimate overall survival ( OS ) patient treatment arm . II . To estimate tumor response rate patient receive trametinib crossover standard care . III . To estimate PFS patient receive trametinib crossover standard care . IV . To compare trametinib `` endocrine standard therapy '' ( i.e. , letrozole , tamoxifen ) regard patient ' self-reported acute quality life neurotoxicity , measure FACT-O-TOI , FACT-GOG-NTX , respectively . V. To examine deoxyribonucleic acid ( DNA ) isolate formalin-fixed , paraffin-embedded section tissue primary diagnosis , recurrence , fine needle aspiration/core biopsy next generation sequence mutational analysis gene mitogen-activated protein kinase ( MAPK ) phosphatidylinositol 3 kinase ( PI3K ) /v-akt murine thymoma viral oncogene homolog 1 ( AKT ) /mammalian target rapamycin ( mTOR ) pathways explore relationship tumor response patient treat trametinib . ( Translational research objective ) VI . To examine protein level estrogen receptor ( ER ) , progesterone receptor ( PR ) , phosphorylated ( p ) mitogen-activated protein kinase 1 ( ERK ) , dual specificity phosphatase 6 ( DUSP6 ) explore relationship tumor response patient treat trametinib . ( Translational research objective ) VII . To identify transcriptional signature ribonucleic acid sequencing ( RNAseq ) predict mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase ( MEK ) addiction sensitivity trametinib . ( Translational research objective ) VIII . To conduct study specific gene cell-free DNA plasma patient explore relationship tumor response trametinib . ( Translational research objective ) IX . To examine pharmacokinetics trametinib . ( Translational research objective ) OUTLINE : Patients randomize 1 2 treatment arm . ARM A : Patients receive clinician 's choice either letrozole orally ( PO ) daily ( QD ) day 1-28 , tamoxifen citrate PO twice daily ( BID ) day 1-28 , paclitaxel intravenously ( IV ) 1 hour day 1 , 8 , 15 , pegylated liposomal doxorubicin hydrochloride ( PLD ) IV 1 hour day 1 , topotecan hydrochloride IV 30 minute day 1 , 8 , 15 . Courses repeat every 28 day absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . Patients develop progressive disease may cross Arm B . ARM B : Patients receive trametinib PO QD day 1-28 . Courses repeat every 28 day absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . After completion study treatment , patient follow every 3 month 2 year , every 6 month 3 year , annually 5 year .</detailed_description>
