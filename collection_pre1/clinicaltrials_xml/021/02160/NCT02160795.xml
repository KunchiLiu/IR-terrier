	<brief_title>Feasibility Identifying Chinese Study Population Eligible Pediatric Cancer Cases , Linking Two Groups Assess Role Periconceptional Folic Acid Supplements Risk Pediatric Cancer .</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Few risk factor consistently link pediatric cancer . During past 15 year , small casecontrol epidemiologic study Caucasian population report reduced risk pediatric leukemia brain tumor offspring mother treat folic acid iron supplement prenatal periconceptional period . We describe feasibility study evaluate potential prospective assessment periconceptional prenatal folic acid supplement postulate risk factor risk pediatric leukemia pediatric cancer . If feasibility study successful , propose carry prospective record linkage Children Families Cohort Study ( CFCS ) ( N=243,779 ) compare risk pediatric leukemia , brain tumor pediatric cancer offspring Chinese mother take v take periconceptional folic acid supplement 1993-1995 community-based intervention trial assess effect occurrence neural tube defect . The original investigator last followed population 2000-2001 The Chinese CDC , U.S. CDC , NCI collaborator carry small pilot study ( N=560 family ) 2011-2013 demonstrate CFCS family successfully identify trace , mother offspring would participate single multi-day interview , referral community hospital ( N=8 ) could locate abstract medical record potentially eligible pediatric cancer case diagnose 1994 present . The propose feasibility study involve three component . The first component test success re-creating original CFCS offspring list 21 county three province . Data collect original 1993-1995 study 2000-2001 follow-up use recreate list include original study ID number , sex , birth date offspring , mother father , place birth ( village , township , hospital ) , residence birth , identify information ; name subject family member available original study list . This component undertaken collaboration county- provincial-level maternal child health organization coordinate public health bureau , family planning , public security agency . The goal component re-identify CFCS offspring 5 county Hebei Province 9 county Jiangsu Zhejiang Provinces , sample 500 randomly select CFCS offspring 7 county Jiangsu Zhejiang Provinces . The second component identify hospital child 21-county study population would diagnose treated pediatric cancer 1994 present . An expanded sample hospital ( N=10 beyond 8 hospital include recent pilot study ) contact asked collaborate propose study . Tasks include identification abstraction medical record pediatric cancer case occur child potentially CFCS offspring ( bear 1994-1996 21 CFCS study county ) . Mothers pediatric cancer patient interview ask provide identify information ascertain offspring CFCS population , provide consent ( together offspring assent ) collaborator access medical record abstract data match offspring CFCS population list . The investigator attempt match potentially eligible pediatric cancer case CFCS list 5 county Hebei Province 9 county Jiangsu Zhejiang Provinces . The third component identify death among offspring ascertain definitely , probably possibly might due childhood cancer . For death among CFCS offspring identified 2000-2001cohort follow-up original study team , cause death ascertain death certificate available medical record interview primary care physician death certificate available . For death among offspring die 2000-2001 , review death certificate among child bear 1994-1996 21 county undertake . Identifying information seek death certificate match decease child CFCS . If identifying information insufficient match , death definitely , probably possibly due childhood cancer , mother decease child trace interviewed obtain additional identifying information , permission review medical record hospitalization near time death , contact information child primary care doctor . For child die 2000-2001and determine definitely probably member CFCS , provisional determination make deceased offspring definitely , probably , possibly diagnosis childhood cancer . The provisional diagnosis review expert pediatric hematologists/oncologists/neurosurgeons final determination assessment level certainty .</detailed_description>
