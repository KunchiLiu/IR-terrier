	<brief_title>Gait Analysis Interdisciplinary Interventions Children With Cerebral Palsy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Children cerebral palsy ( CP ) walk independently often altered gait pattern . Interdisciplinary intervention term orthopaedic surgery , spasticity management , physical therapy orthotics aim improve gait pattern . Standardised measurement use Cerebral Palsy follow-Up Program ass walking . However , measurement describe feature gait pattern reflect underlie neuro-musculoskeletal impairment . This do instrument 3-dimensional gait analysis ( IGA ) . It never investigate whether interdisciplinary intervention design address impairment identify IGA result improve gait pattern compare 'care usual ' without IGA child CP . The aim study test hypothesis , improvement gait pattern follow individually tailor intervention guide IGA superior use 'care usual ' . A prospective , single blind , randomise , parallel group study conduct . Participants recruit Cerebral Palsy follow-Up Program . Children age 5 9 year spastic CP , classify Gross Motor Function Classification System level I II include . The intervention investigation 1 ) Individually tailor interdisciplinary intervention address impairment identify IGA 2 ) 'care usual ' ( interdisciplinary intervention without IGA ) . The primary outcome gait pattern measure Gait Deviation Index . Secondary outcome measure , walk performance patient-reported outcome functional mobility , health-related quality life overall health , pain participation . Explorative outcome measure include walk performance , gait pattern , behavior health care provider apply intervention . The primary endpoint assess outcome two intervention 52 week start intervention . A follow also perform 26 week start intervention ; however , exclusively patient-reported outcome . To knowledge , first randomise control trial compare effect individually tailor interdisciplinary intervention design address impairment identify IGA versus 'care usual ' child CP . Consequently , study provide novel evidence use IGA interdisciplinary intervention .</detailed_description>
