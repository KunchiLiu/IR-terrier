	<brief_summary>1 . Purpose - This study aim evaluate feasibility iPhone base telementoring ultrasonography . 2 . Methods - Study Design : Prospective observational study - Study Setting : Urban academic ED tertiary care teach hospital - Study period : July , 2014 ~ December , 2014 ( six month ) - Study participant : Of patient need undergo ultrasonography ED , agree participate study enrol . 3 . We hypothesize iPhone base real time tele-diagnosis remote expert would different diagnosis via his/her direct ultrasound examination .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>- Teleultrasound system 1 . We already develop telesystem view ultrasound examination perform emergency department ( ED ) use iPhone display simultaneously ED . 2 . Remote mentor view patient examiner 's hand hold ultrasound probe simultaneously view ultrasound image field ultrasound display 3 . The examiner mentor communicate . - Procedures : 1 . The resident perform ultrasonography ED expert observe practice use iPhone . 2 . While view practice , mentor guide examiner ( resident ) manipulate probe get best ultrasound image . 3 . After finish practice , mentor measure speed use mobile network use application 'BENCHBEE ' record predesigned registry . 4 . The registry include patient ' information , time date examination , type mobile network ( 3G , LTE , WiFi etc . ) speed mobile network , use tele-displayer ( iPhone , iPad , iPad mini ) , use probe , perform body organ ( cardiac , lung , Hepatobiliary , vascular , genital organ , appendix intestine include suspected intussusception ) , examiner 's level training ultrasound experience examiner mentor . 5 . The mentor record patient 's diagnosis problem procedure . 6 . The mentor go patient , perform ultrasonography directly confirm patient ' diagnosis . 7 . We investigate diagnostic accuracy iPhone-based tele-ultrasonography comparing diagnosis .</detailed_description>
