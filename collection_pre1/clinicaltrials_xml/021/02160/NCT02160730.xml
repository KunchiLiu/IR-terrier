	<brief_title>Treatment Cushing 's Disease With R-roscovitine</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>To date , R-roscovitine ( seliciclib ) evaluate several Phase I II study show early sign anti-cancer activity approximately 240 patient . Studies include Phase I study single agent seliciclib administer patient advanced non-small cell lung cancer ( NSCLC ) two Phase IIa study seliciclib administer combination gemcitabine cisplatin first-line treatment docetaxel second-line treatment NSCLC . Seliciclib also evaluate Phase I study patient nasopharyngeal cancer ( NPC ) evidence tumor shrinkage concomitant reduction copy count EBV virus causally associate pathogenesis NPC . Results APPRAISE , randomized discontinuation , double-blinded , placebo-controlled , Phase IIb study oral seliciclib capsule monotherapy heavily pretreated patient NSCLC , demonstrate difference seliciclib placebo arm progression free survival substantial increase overall survival observe ( 388 versus 218 day respectively ( Cyclacel Pharmaceuticals press release Dec 21 , 2010 ) . Here , investigator propose exploratory , proof concept clinical trial determine seliciclib safely normalize urinary free cortisol level reduce pituitary corticotroph tumor ACTH production patient Cushing disease .</detailed_description>
