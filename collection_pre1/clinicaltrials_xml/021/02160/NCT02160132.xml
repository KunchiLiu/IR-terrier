	<brief_title>A Controlled Study Steroids Therapy Patients IgA Nephropathy With Active Pathological Changes .</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>It report urinary protein excretion persistently 1g/24h eGFR＞50ml/min/1.73m2 IgA nephropathy ( IgAN ) , KDIGO guideline suggest 6-month course glucocorticoid . The famous study Pozzi C prove patient IgAN proteinuria 1.0-3.5g/24h serum creatinine concentration 133 umol/L less , 6-month course steroid treatment ( 1g/d methylprednisolone intravenously 3 consecutive day , course repeat 2 month 4 month later , oral prednisone 0.5mg/kg/d alternate day 6 month ) could significantly reduce proteinuria protect renal function deterioration IgAN . Furthermore , know , active pathological change IgAN , include crescent , necrosis microthrombus , may turn fibrosis three month would effect prognosis.This prospective , randomize , control , multi-center study . Patients treatment group receive 0.5g/d methylprednisolone intravenously 3 consecutive day 1st-2nd-3rd month , oral methylprednisolone 0.4mg/kg/d consecutive day Patients control group receive 0.5g/d methylprednisolone intravenously 3 consecutive day 1st-3rd-5th month , oral methylprednisolone 0.4mg/kg/d consecutive day . After followed-up 6 month , curative effect steroid therapy proteinuria progression IgAN evaluate .</detailed_description>
