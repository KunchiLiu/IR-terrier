	<brief_title>Examining Efficacy Anxiety Meter Recognition Management Anxiety Signs Autism Spectrum Disorder</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Anxiety prevalent , persistent , disable co-morbidity autism spectrum disorder ( ASD ) . In addition profound negative impact physical mental health , anxiety interacts core deficit ASD exacerbate symptomatology increase functional impairment . Anxiety treatment efficacious non-ASD child ( e.g. , Cognitive-Behavioural Therapy ( CBT ) ) often reduce potency limited applicability ASD population due impairment cognitive ability , communication , emotional awareness , introspection . Despite urgency treat co-morbid anxiety ASD , limit evidence support treatment program higher-functioning individual , evidence lower-functioning . In light urgent need treatment co-morbid anxiety ASD paucity evidence area , investigator propose study establish early evidence technology-supported treatment anxiety child ASD . This approach aim reduce ASD-related barrier treatment ( e.g. , deficit emotional awareness introspection ) provide child visual , real time display arousal level . The propose treatment focus physiological arousal associate anxiety . In particular , investigator propose use physiological indicator anxiety objectively measure promote awareness physiological arousal . To end , investigator develop Anxiety Meter , device measure arousal-related increase heart rate use non-invasive wearable sensor translate visual display child 's arousal level tablet computer . The investigator research question : 1 . Primary : Does Anxiety Meter improve awareness management physiological arousal induce anxiogenic stimulus control set ? Hypothesis : The Anxiety Meter improve awareness management symptom promote awareness arousal - skill impaired ASD . 2 . Secondary : What demographic cognitive behavioural variable predict response Anxiety Meter ? Hypothesis : Age , IQ , sex , severity anxiety symptom baseline affect treatment response . To investigate question , investigator propose randomize controlled trial compare Anxiety Meter control condition child ASD . Both treatment control group teach relaxation technique ( three training session ) ask apply technique control anxiety-inducing task ( one test session ) . During test session , participant seat front computer screen complete five task : 1 . Baseline ( 30 minute ) : Participants watch animate movie clip . This task use successfully `` baseline activity '' investigator previous study target population . 2 . Anxiety condition 1 ( 2 minute ) : In task , participant give 2 minute prepare 3-minute talk . They tell talk deliver audience 3 stranger . 3 . Intervention ( 5 minute ) : Both group use time reflect anxiety level apply relaxation technique feel anxious . Only treatment group receive real-time display physiological arousal Anxiety Meter . The control group Anxiety Meter , marker move . The investigator previous study indicate five minute sufficient heart rate return baseline . 4 . Anxiety condition 2 ( 3 minute ) : Participants deliver 3-minute talk audience 3 stranger . They receive prompt alert remain speaking time every minute . 5 . Return-to-baseline ( 15 minute ) : Participants watch animate movie clip .</detailed_description>
