	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To determine recommended phase II dose lenalidomide ibrutinib combination rituximab previously treat chronic lymphocytic leukemia small lymphocytic lymphoma . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . To determine safety tolerability combination lenalidomide , ibrutinib rituximab previously treat chronic lymphocytic leukemia small lymphocytic lymphoma . II . To describe preliminary evidence antitumor activity combination lenalidomide , rituximab ibrutinib previously treat chronic lymphocytic leukemia small lymphocytic lymphoma define response rate , duration response , progression-free survival . III . To observe record anti-tumor activity . OUTLINE : This dose-escalation study lenalidomide . Patients receive rituximab intravenously ( IV ) day 1 ( 6 course ) , lenalidomide orally ( PO ) daily ( QD ) day 1-21 ( 12 course ) , ibrutinib PO QD day 1-28 . Courses repeat every 28 day absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . After completion study treatment , patient follow 30 day every 6 month 10 year .</detailed_description>
