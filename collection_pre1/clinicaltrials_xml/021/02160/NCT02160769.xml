	<brief_summary>The investigator study aims capture objective effect pterygium surgery tear layer lipid thickness tear layer . Previous objective study tear film limited corneal stain grading , tear break time Schirmer 's test show poor moderate repeatability . The effect pterygium tear layer lipid thickness ( LLT ) previously explore . With LipiView Ocular Surface Interferometer , investigator ability assess optical coherence interference pattern produce light reflect tear film safe non-invasive manner . Software analysis image measure tear LLT use objectively quantify diagnosis lipid-deficient dry eye .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Pterygium condition characterize abnormal conjunctival growth cornea particularly prevalent tropical climate . In severe circumstance , may lead visual loss obscuration visual axis induce corneal astigmatism ( 1 ) . It often also associate dry eye symptom study previously show correlation shorten tear break time ( TBUT ) ( 2 ) Schirmer 's Test ( 3 ) . Schirmer 's Test , corneal stain TBUT often use investigate symptom dry eye diagnosis assessment often difficult due poor repeatability test ( 4 ) . Treatments dry eye often rely patient 's subjective symptomatic improvement measure outcome although literature publish subjective symptom pterygium patient . The effect pterygium surgery tear lipid layer thickness also study . The LipiView Ocular Surface Interferometer HSA-approved image device allows clinician evaluate characteristic thickness tear lipid layer thickness ( LLT ) safe non-invasive manner . The device utilize white light LED source direct tear film inferior corneal region . Reflected light capture high resolution camera optical inference pattern evaluate software determine LLT ( 5 ) . It also find correlate dry eye diagnostic test , tear film break-up time ( TBUT ) , Schirmer 's test corneal staining ( 6,7 ) . LLT also report well correlate symptom objective dry eye test ( 5 ) . LipiView also capable detect significant change longitudinal lipid thickness 10 patient one month blepharoplasty . A similar result may obtain investigator patient post pterygium surgery . This current study aim investigate effect pterygium surgery tear lipid layer thickness LipiView . The result compare effect pterygium surgery TBUT , corneal staining . The subjective improvement dry eye symptom post pterygium surgery also study . Clinical importance This study provide data support pterygium surgery role dry eye management objective reproducible manner . New data pterygium tear lipid layer thickness well subjective dry eye symptom also explore . Study Objectives Purpose The Assesssment Dry Eye Symptoms , Tear Layer Tear Layer Lipid Thickness Pre 1month Post Pterygium Surgery use LipiView Ocular Surface Interferometer ( LipiView ) Study design : Prospective study Rationale : Methods : Participants target sample size Target sample size : 80 40 patient undergoing pterygium surgery recruit study . Another 40 patient recruit general ophthalmology ( ECS ) clinic . These patient clear lid disturbance term function anatomy , serve `` control '' group . Permission seek junior ophthalmologist supervise ophthalmologist ( event train list ) senior ophthalmologist perform surgery . These patient would diagnose pterygium opted surgical excision conjunctival autograft . Pre operatively complete simple questionnaire evaluate dry eye symptom . Participants examine slit lamp fluorescein dye corneal stain fluorescein dye tear break time . The patient undergo LipiView Ocular Surface Interferometer Measurement Tear lipid layer thickness . Visit schedule Two/Three visit require paticipants undergo pterygium surgery . Only one visit require normal control recruit general ophthalmology ( ECS ) clinic . Duration study : 10 month . Procedures : 1 . Assessment Dry Eye Symptoms ( SANDE ) Participants ask score fill dry eye questionnaire assess symptomatic severity frequency dry eye symptom . â€¢ SANDE Questionnaire Consists 3 question frequency severity . VAS apply evaluate dry eye symptom describe Schaumberg et al . ( Schaumberg , Gulati et al . 2007 ) . The score record separately frequency severity dry eye symptom . Patients ask mark `` X '' 100mm line corresponds degree symptom . A global score calculate multiplying frequency score severity score take square root result ( transform back original scale ) . Basic biodata age , race , gender also record . 2 . LipiView Ocular Surface Interferometer Measurement Tear lipid Layer Thickness Prior measure tear lipid layer thickness , participant advise : i. instill eye ointment least 24 hour , ii . instill eye drop wear contact lenses 4 hour , iii . swim chlorinate pool , rub eye put eye cosmetic day measurement . During measurement eye , participant place chin chin rest look single white light source 30 second . During period , participant encourage blink freely comfortable rate assessor measure LLT . Similar step would take eye control eye . Assessment fluorescein tear break time corneal staining conduct LipiView LLT measurement . 3 . Fluorescein Dye Tear Break-up Time ( TBUT ) Fluorescein dye introduce onto low eyelid wet fluorescein strip . The tear film observe blue light use slit lamp point break . The time previous blink break tear film record near second . 4 . Fluorescein Dye Corneal Staining After fluorescein dye introduce , cornea examine green stain indicate epithelial erosion , sign damage due dryness . The number green stain location cornea ( superior , central , inferior , temporal , nasal field ) record . 5 . Patient undergo pterygium excision conjunctival autograft prearrange surgery date . 6 . Steps 1-4 repeat 1 month post operatively . Outcomes : Primary outcome : An increase tear lipid layer thickness 1 month post pterygium surgery operate eye . Statistics : There interim analysis . Analysis perform subject complete required visit withdrawn study . Data analyse sample mean pre post-operative questionnaire score , tear break time , corneal stain tear lipid layer thickness operate un-operated eye . The confidence interval pre post-operative operated un-operated calculate T-test analysis . Expected outcomes : There decrease dry eye symptom operate pterygium eye improvement tear break time , decrease corneal stain increase tear lipid layer thickness compare pre operative . Potential problem No potential problem expect study . Inclusion Criteria 1 . Normal control patient pterygium consent pterygium surgery willing participate study Exclusion Criteria 1 . Active ocular surface condition infection . 2 . Any specified reason determine clinical investigator .</detailed_description>
