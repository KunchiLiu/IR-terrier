	<detailed_description>It estimate 4 5 million men United States testosterone deficient , few 10 % currently receive testosterone replacement therapy . There many reason low number men receive testosterone replacement therapy , one route administration . The currently approve androgen therapy oral product , injectables , patch , buccal system , gel , disadvantage . Oral preparation may associate hepatotoxicity produce unfavorable effect serum lipid profile carbohydrate metabolism . Injectables associate uneven level serum testosterone leading fluctuation mood , libido , energy level . Patches may require intrusive preparation , cause skin irritation adhere properly . A testosterone gel overcome problem gain acceptance , indication men apply gel correctly . Previous study show Androxal significantly increase total testosterone level men low value baseline . Additional study find Androxal non inferior topical gel , find maintain sperm count normal range . Subjects randomize one two treatment arm , use block size 4 . The order treatment assign block randomized process repeat consecutive block subject subject randomize . This process ensure every fourth randomize subject , number subject treatment group equal . To allow subject screen target 50 subject enrol account dropout , 75 randomization code generate . As subject enrol study , assign unique consecutive number start 001 . At least 50 subject meet entry criterion randomize 1:1 approximately 25 subject assign Androxal treatment arm approximately 25 subject assign placebo arm . Placebo control study gold standard clinical trial attempt whenever indication current medical practice allow . This study investigate product increase sperm concentration subject idiopathic male infertility secondary hypogonadism , low testosterone . Subjects idiopathic male infertility require treatment healthy approximately 18 week placebo unlikely harm subject way . Standard care idiopathic male infertility today allow subject physician option medically treat disease . Therefore , use placebo control study well justified provide best mechanism ass treatment effect .</detailed_description>
