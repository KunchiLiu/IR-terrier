	<brief_title>Efficacy Safety Tolvaptan Subjects With Chronic Kidney Disease Between Late Stage 2 Early Stage 4 Due Autosomal Dominant Polycystic Kidney Disease</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The protocol extend understand efficacy safety tolvaptan treatment ADPKD patient late stage 2 early stage 4 CKD ( chronic kidney disease ) . This trial compare efficacy tolvaptan treatment reduce change estimate glomerular filtration rate ( eGFR ) pre-treatment baseline post-treatment follow-up , compare placebo , subject tolerate tolvaptan initial run-in period . The change eGFR , calculate Chronic Kidney Disease-Epidemiology ( CKD-EPI ) formula , provide kidney function data complementary data demonstrate benefit previously observe primarily ADPKD subject earlier stage disease . Also , compare efficacy tolvaptan treatment reduce decline annualized eGFR slope , compare placebo , type subject . Finally , compare overall hepatic safety profile tolvaptan placebo compare incidence ADPKD complication ( outcome ) trial</detailed_description>
