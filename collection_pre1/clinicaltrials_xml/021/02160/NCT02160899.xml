	<detailed_description>Lipoprotein ( ) [ Lp ( ) ] genetic variant low-density lipoprotein ( LDL ) apolipoprotein B ( apoB ) -100 component LDL link disulfide bond apolipoprotein ( ) [ apo ( ) ] , distinct protein component Lp ( ) mainly responsible signature structural functional property . Lp ( ) recognize important genetic risk factor coronary artery disease , stroke aortic stenosis . The purpose study determine ISIS-APO ( ) Rx reduce production apolipoprotein ( ) , apo ( ) . This study enroll 50 patient Lipoprotein ( ) ≥50 &lt; 175 mg/dL 10 patient Lipoprotein ( ) ≥175 mg/dL .</detailed_description>
