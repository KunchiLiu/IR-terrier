	<brief_summary>The purpose study examine effect variation practice , range early functional rehabilitation complete immobilsation post operative patient ankle fixation follow fracture . The primary goal post-operative regimen attain full weight-bearing close pre-injury level activity soon possible . We seek establish effect ( 1 ) functional outcome , ( 2 ) complication rate ( 3 ) time return work three different approach rehabilitation ankle fracture fixation order produce standardise , evidence-based guideline unit . We also aim perform cost analysis approach .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Although indication fixation ankle fracture relatively clear , controversy exist regard post-operative management fracture . This prospective randomise controlled trial . All patient admit Countess Chester NHS Foundation Trust Orthopaedic Unit ankle fracture fixation meet set study inclusion criterion give patient information pack regard trial ask complete consent form enter trial AFTER operation perform . All patient initially ankle immobilised knee backslab apply theatre review 2 week plaster room removal plaster suture . At set patient randomise 1 3 rehabilitation arm use sealed envelope technique . All patient data anonymised follow generation randomisation number . 3 Orthopaedic Consultants ( JH , KT , EW ) thereafter supervise follow-up study population discharge 1 year . Outcome measure record include patient -reported functional score ( MOxFQ ) ; clinical assessment range motion , complication rate ( loss reduction ) ; pain score , satisfaction rate return work . Clinic review organise 2 week randomisation , 6 week first post-op xrays removal plaster/ brace , 8 week clinical review specifically range movement achievable ankle , 3 month repeat Xray clinical assessment , final clinical review clinic 6 month fracture clinic . Telephone/ postal questionnaire gather MoXFQ score 1 year . There ethical legal issue relate study . One potential concern loss reduction fixation ankle fracture follow weight bear without immobilisation . However , study publish Gul et al 2007 relate immediate weight-bearing operatively treat ankle fracture without immobilisation cast show evidence loss reduction hardware failure compare historical control . Patients review closely early period loss reduction safety outcome measure result monitor closely early termination trial concern . There monthly data review monitoring research meeting .
