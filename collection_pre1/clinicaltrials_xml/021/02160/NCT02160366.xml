	<brief_summary>The goal laboratory research study collect analyze treatment , molecular profiling biomarker data . The result data analysis use well understand characterize tumor identify therapy may tailor individual patient identify and/or predict side effect may occur and/or predict therapy may best participant . Research may also do exist tissue identify new biomarkers .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Molecular Profiling/Deep Sequencing : Molecular profile classification tissue base expression certain gene within tumor might predict tumor responds therapy . Deep sequencing detailed type molecular profile allows focus analysis individual gene . Biomarker Data : A characteristic measure evaluated indicator normal biologic process , disease process pharmacologic response therapeutic intervention . Study Participation : If agree take part study , information medical record collect . The information researcher collect include medical history , chemotherapy schedule ( ) , well result test , procedure , and/or therapy may . Your response therapy , side effect , result diagnostic test perform therapy also collect . Researchers want learn could well predict response therapy use information collect study and/or well predict side effect treatment . The data collect medical record store password-protected database MD Anderson use research relate study 10 year . In addition , research study new biomarkers may conduct previously bank blood and/or tumor tissue . Samples collect may include blood , fresh tumor tissue , urine , saliva , bone marrow , pleural fluid , ascites , skin hair follicle . Your name , medical record number , personal identifiable information collect medical record replace code number . No identify information directly link data collect medical record . Only doctor charge study , select member research staff , access code number able link data back . Use Samples : Before banked tissue sample use research , people research must get specific approval Institutional Review Board ( IRB ) MD Anderson . The IRB committee make doctor , researcher , member community . The IRB responsible protect participant involve research study make sure research do safe ethical manner . All research do MD Anderson , include research involve tissue sample bank , must first approve IRB . Your tissue sample give code number . No identify information directly link sample . Only researcher charge bank access code number able link sample . This allow medical data relate sample update need . Other researcher use sample able link data . Length Study : Your participation study either data , blood , tumor tissue sample , and/or archive tumor sample analyze . This investigational study . Up 2000 participant take part study . All enrol MD Anderson .</detailed_description>
