	<brief_summary>Lower lobe atelectasis lung common Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome ( ARDS ) potential adversely impact lung compliance intra-pulmonary shunt . The cephalic shift diaphragm dorsal atelectasis associate commonly use supine position might also contribute shunt . Reports indicate obese patient may likely develop dorsal atelectasis non-obese patient . The investigator hypothesize open body position angle waist typical head bed 30 degree one similar upright reverse trendelenburg position , would alter position diaphragm downward , allow improve aeration lung base . Thus , investigator examine upright body position mechanically ventilated patient ARDS primarily evaluate effect oxyhemoglobin saturation ( O2sat ) , Tidal Volume ( TV ) Respiratory Rate ( RR ) .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Acute respiratory failure acute respiratory distress syndrome life-threatening occurrence . The annual incidence ARDS 141,500 patient , 59,000 death , cost 1,642,000 hospital days/year . Within population , special care need obese patient become clinically important entity within Intensive Care Unit ( ICU ) . ICU literature body position obese mechanically ventilated patient limited . Currently , intubate obese patient place supine position head bed elevated 30 degree . The 30 degree head position adopt patient reflection Ventilator Associated Pneumonia prevention literature . In critically ill patient mechanical ventilation , cephalic shift diaphragm along dorsal atelectasis lung occur . In obese patient alteration may associate great degree impairment lung compliance gas exchange compare non-obese ventilated patient . It possible current ICU body position recommendation obese mechanically ventilated patient may detrimental due obese abdominal compartment hamper normal diaphragm function position . In supine , intubate , mechanically ventilated patient long note low lung lob become atelectatic soon intubation due several factor accumulation fluid , air closure , cephalic shift diaphragm . Obese patient develop atelectasis anesthesia non-obese patient . There attempt correct iatrogenic complication critically ill patient placement patient prone position . Prone position resolve dorsal atelectasis show improvement hypoxia . However mortality benefit prone positioning . Also , continuous lateral rotational patient position mechanical ventilation show similar effects7 . Specific literature regard obese patient unique susceptibility towards phenomenon limit . As BMI increase associate reduction lung volume , expiatory reserve volume , functional reserve capacity . It also know reverse trendelenburg position , gravitational pull allow abdominal content descent toward pelvis . This position abdominal content allow functional diaphragm position . One observational study 10 conduct 12 hour intervention examine upright position patient ' body straight line 40-45 degree ( i.e. , reverse trendelenburg-no bend waist ) . This study demonstrate significant increase PaO2/FiO2 ratio ( ie , oxygenation ) upright position .</detailed_description>
