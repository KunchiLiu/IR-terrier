	<brief_summary>The study prospective , randomize , open-label comparison multimodal regimen standard , narcotic-based regimen postoperative pain control patient undergo surgery operatively indicate , isolated extremity fracture . The investigator measure pain level , narcotic use , patient satisfaction , patient report function , adverse event fracture union . The investigator hypothesize multimodal regimen lead improve pain , less narcotic use improve satisfaction compare standard regimen .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Patients assessed inclusion exclusion admission hospital evaluation clinic emergency room isolate extremity fracture surgery indicate . Once enrol study consent obtain , patient randomize either standard therapy group multimodal therapy group use permute block randomization base injury site . The site fracture follow : - wrist/hand/forearm - elbow/upper arm/shoulder - acetabulum/pelvis - foot/ankle - patella/tibia ( shaft , proximal ) - femur ( proximal distal ) The investigator assume distinct area result similar amount disability pain compare site . This attempt mitigate possible confounder disproportionate number painful debilitate injury fall one study group compare another . Pre-operatively , patient demographic data record include age , gender , BMI , hand dominance , occupation , use tobacco/alcohol/illicit drug , use assistive device , relevant comorbidities ( i.e. , diabetes ) , site injury , mechanism energy ( high low ) . If delay initial presentation surgery , often case distal radius ankle fracture , among others , multimodal patient begin therapy immediately evaluation . Thus , start schedule 1000mg acetaminophen 100mg gabapentin three time daily . They also provide 5mg oxycodone prescription instruction take 1-3 tablet every 4 hour need pain . Standard therapy patient prescribe oxycodone alone , use parameter , ability take acetaminophen need basis . Pre-operatively , multimodal patient receive 1000mg IV acetaminophen , 100mg PO gabapentin 400mg PO celecoxib . All patient peripheral nerve block place indicate , confirm investigator standard care . Patients undergo surgery investigator standardize anesthesia protocol describe protocol . Intraoperatively , multimodal patient receive 8mg IV dexamethasone . Post-operatively , multimodal patient give 1000mg acetaminophen three time daily duration narcotic use 100mg Gabapentin three time daily 1 week , titrate 200mg three time daily 1 additional week . They also receive oxycodone prescription describe previously . Standard therapy patient give oxycodone prescription alone advice take tylenol need basis exceed 4000mg/day . No placebo medication use open label study . Patients instructed avoid anti-inflammatory medication . All patient across group give aspirin 81mg deep vein thrombosis prophylaxis suffer low extremity fracture . Should patient require alternative deep vein thrombosis prophylaxis regimen due allergy aspirin personal history deep vein thromboses , low molecular weight heparin use . Patients give diary record daily narcotic use , daily minimum , maximum average pain score use visual analog scale side effect . Patients provide contact information attend surgeon 's nurse report serious allergy adverse effect study medication . A case case decision make either continue protocol drop patient study make need medication change . Patients follow defined time point surgery include , 2 wks , 6wks , 3mo 6mo . At 2 wk follow visit fill Short Musculoskeletal Function Assessment preoperative functional state well American Pain Society Patient Satisfaction Questionnaire . These fill 3 6 month visit . Union assess 3 6 month visit third party , blind observe . It define three cortex bridge callus 2 orthogonal view . Once fracture union occur nonunion identify control patient allow use non steroidal anti-inflammatory need . Time return work/normal activity , total narcotic usage duration narcotic use also record .</detailed_description>
