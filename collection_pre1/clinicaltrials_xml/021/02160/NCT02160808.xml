	<brief_summary>Pancreatic leak complicate pancreatic resection approximately 20 % case . The pancreatic anastomosis repair refer Achilles heel pancreatic surgery . Unfortunately , despite recognition problem multiple operative technique propose prevent complication , leak continue represent major cause morbidity patient undergoing pancreatic surgery . Treatment leak often require nutritional support total parenteral nutrition diminish leak addition invasive intervention contain leak drain , stent severe case , reoperation . Experiential data suggest intra-operative infusion secretin , naturally occur hormone stimulate bicarbonate release pancreas , follow resection prior abdomen closure , may identify leak present . If secretin demonstrate evidence leak intra-operatively , pancreatic duct leak may able fix prior abdominal closure . The investigator aim determine give intra-operative infusion secretin allow identification treatment leak pancreatic reconstruction prior abdominal closure , lead reduction rate pancreatic anastomotic leak require intervention . The investigator perform double-blind , randomize pilot study 176 patient undergoing pancreatic resection ( pancreaticoduodenectomy distal pancreatectomy ) Dartmouth-Hitchcock Medical Center . 88 patient receive intra-operative secretin infusion prior abdominal closure 88 receive saline placebo . Our primary outcome interest rate pancreas duct leak group measure amount amylase present surgical drain 5 day follow surgery .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>We hypothesize intra-operative , intravenous secretin administration decrease rate pancreatic leak patient undergo pancreatic resection . Our primary objective determine intravenous secretin administration decrease amount pancreatic leak measure drain fluid amylase 5 day follow resection . Our secondary objective determine intra-operative intravenous secretin administration change management pancreatic resection margin intra-operatively impact length stay ( LOS ) Use level detail similar would use submit article publication peer review journal . Explain study procedure , data collection , analysis process . Please define term explain concept might confuse reviewer expert area study . If formal protocol study exists , page reference protocol acceptable . This study design prospective , double-blind , randomized-controlled trial . We enroll patient institution undergo pancreatic resection receive either 1 ) one dose weight-based Secretin give closure pancreatic resection margin complete 2 ) saline placebo . Consent basic demographic garner physician office visit surgery schedule consent surgery obtain . The consent validate treat surgeon pre-procedure area day surgery . The patient undergo schedule surgery . Once pancreatic anastomosis deem acceptable attend physician , prior abdominal closure , patient randomize receive either Secretin ( 0.2 mcg/kg ) saline placebo . The attend surgeon blind assignment . 10 minute receive Secretin placebo , attend surgeon examine anastomosis repair cut edge pancreas determine leakage pancreatic fluid note , leak location ( ) , type ( side branch/main duct ) whether intervention perform effort close leak . Specifics operative intervention document . The patient undergo standard surgical closure abdomen . As standard care DHMC , surgical drain place adjacent anastomosis drain amylase output check POD # 1 , POD # 3 POD # 5 . Pancreatic leak define accord International Study Group Pancreatic Fistula ( ISGPF ) definition drainage &gt; 50 cc/day amylase-rich fluid ( great 3-fold elevation upper limit normal serum ) surgically place drain POD # 5 . Randomization assignment reveal patient discharge hospital follow initial surgical intervention . A follow-up visit patient two week follow discharge , evaluate evidence ongoing pancreatic duct leak . The primary outcome interest presence pancreatic leak base amount drain amylase POD # 5 . Secondary outcome include : 1 ) technical intervention intra-operatively direct leak closure manipulation anastomosis follow Secretin placebo stimulation 2 ) length stay surrogate complication severity pancreatic surgery . Patient demographic , risk factor , operative technique , randomization assignment outcome data record standard case report form - See Case Report Forms Appendix .
