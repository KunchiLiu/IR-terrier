	<brief_summary>The purpose study investigate influence nighttime feed next morning run performance , hydration status , exercise metabolism female endurance athlete . Specifically , effect chocolate milk beverage examine versus non-nutritive , flavor-matched placebo . The investigator hypothesize nighttime consumption chocolate milk , whole food complex , result improve next morning run performance versus placebo . Secondarily , investigator hypothesize potential positive performance outcome chocolate milk treatment may due enhance pre-exercise hydration status improve exercise metabolism .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>This study interventional nature employ crossover , randomize , double-blinded approach . This study include maximal oxygen uptake test three trial : one familiarization trial , two experimental trial . The familiarization serve practice test minimize training effect experimental trial . The experimental trial complete within 2-week period determine luteal phase menstrual cycle ( day 15-28 menstrual cycle , day 1 first day menstruation ) . A minimum 48-72 hour provide test day . Experimental trial consist baseline testing ( height , weight , urinalysis , rest metabolic rate ) , follow treadmill performance protocol . Participants complete 3-stage incremental exercise test ( 55 % , 65 % , 75 % maximal oxygen uptake respectively ) . Metabolic data collect time . Participants complete 10-kilometer running time trial marker intensity monitor various time point ( blood glucose , blood lactate , heart rate , rating perceived exertion ) . Participants primary researcher blind time speed data . Distance known measure progress . Additional blood , urine , body weight measure take immediately post exercise .</detailed_description>
