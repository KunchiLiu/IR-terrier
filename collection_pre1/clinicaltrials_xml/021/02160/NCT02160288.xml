	<brief_title>Effects Botox Obstructed Defecation Syndrome</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Constipation represent one five common physician diagnose gut disorder . Obstructed defecation syndrome ( ODS ) under-treated condition account 30 % - 50 % patient constipation common people age . ODS due abnormal contraction puborectalis muscle ( muscle around anus relax defecation ) . Biofeedback therapy medical management standard care ODS . Typically patient first manage dietary modification ( fiber supplementation , increased fluid ) medication ( laxative , enema ) .
