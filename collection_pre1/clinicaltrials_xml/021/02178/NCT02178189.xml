	<brief_title>RCT High- vs. Standard-Calorie Formula Methadone-Exposed Infants</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Background : Infants expose methadone pregnancy experience high rate neonatal abstinence syndrome ( NAS ) . Common NAS symptom ( tremulousness , increased muscle tone , sweat , excessive cry , vomit diarrhea ) increase infant ' metabolic need . Another frequent NAS symptom , weak uncoordinated suckling , impairs infant ' ability take adequate calorie . These combine problem compromise infant weight gain . The current standard care opiate-exposed infant require evidence poor weight gain excessive weight loss initiate high-calorie formula . We hypothesize inadequate caloric intake among methadone expose infant may result excessive weight loss , slow weight regain exacerbation NAS . These factor lead newborn 's requirement high morphine dos long duration hospitalization . Therefore , methadone expose infant may benefit early caloric enhancement . A nutritional intervention opiate-exposed infant previously evaluate . This application provide data adequacy recruitment , protocol feasibility , performance select measure , preliminary estimate efficacy comprehensive R01 submission . Specific Aims : 1 . For methadone expose infant , compare infant randomize high ( 24 kcal/oz ) versus standard ( 20 kcal/oz ) formula follow outcome : - Weight loss gain pattern . The primary dependent measure day infant return birth weight . Secondary measure maximum percent weight loss day weight nadir . - NAS severity measure : ) total length hospital stay NAS ; b ) duration NAS treatment ; c ) mean Finnegan score day 2-10 ; ) maximum concentration morphine use treat NAS . 2 . Describe suck quality 4-6 day age among methadone expose infant . Evaluate association infant suck quality infant weight loss gain pattern measure NAS severity . Design : Women methadone recruit pregnancy attend single brief visit late pregnancy . After delivery , infant randomize double blind trial either high-calorie standard-calorie formula start 72 hour birth continue 21 day age . Infants weigh daily outpatient study visit 1 3 month . For pilot study , 70 mother enrol 18 month . This pilot study need establish feasibility study method well estimate difference observe group . For primary outcome variable , day infant return birth weight , discrete survival method use . Potential Impact : Early caloric enhancement methadone-exposed infant inexpensive , readily available , easy implement could improve outcomes high-risk infant . High-calorie formula could result normal pattern weight loss gain , less severe NAS symptom shorter hospital stay .</detailed_description>
