	<brief_summary>Polyethylene wear osteolysis remain concern use modular , fix bearing total knee arthroplasty . A variety highly cross-linked polyethylene introduce decrease problem , little data result complication polyethylene posterior-stabilized knee prosthesis . The investigator ask follow question : ( 1 ) Are difference clinical radiographic result highly cross-lined polyethylene compare standard liner ? ( 2 ) What frequency reoperation two group specific complication relate highly cross-linked polyethylene liner .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Outcome Study Highly-cross Linked Polyethylene vs. Standard Polyethylene Primary Posterior Stabilized ( PS ) Total Knee</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This prospective , randomize study seek enroll patient undergo primary total knee arthroplasty . Preoperative evaluation include detailed history physical exam clinical data collection ( SF-36 , WOMAC , Knee Society Scores ) , complete description procedure , demonstration actual type implant tibial insert , outline study protocol inform consent . Intraoperatively , patient undergo total knee arthroplasty utilize standard operative procedure . Each patient receive Zimmer NexGen posterior-stabilized total knee arthroplasty . During procedure preoperative visit , patient randomize seal envelope receive either standard Zimmer UHMWPE tibial insert Zimmer highly cross-linked UHMWPE tibial insert . Both surgeon patient blind type implant use . variation surgical technique hospital management patient throughout course study . Postoperatively , patient see routine follow-up six week , 6 month , 1 year yearly thereafter . Radiographs obtain visit . Clinical data form complete visit . At conclusion study radiograph assess sign polyethylene wear , osteolysis component loosening . preoperative postoperative knee score calculate patient compare patient group standard statistical analysis .</detailed_description>
