	<brief_title>Gemcitabine Hydrochloride Eribulin Mesylate Treating Patients With Bladder Cancer That Advanced Can Be Removed Surgery</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To estimate objective response rate gemcitabine ( gemcitabine hydrochloride ) -eribulin ( eribulin mesylate ) ( GE ) give cisplatin ineligible patient advance unresectable urothelial carcinoma receive prior chemotherapy advance disease . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . To estimate median progression-free survival ( PFS ) . II . To summarize toxicity profile ( use Common Terminology Criteria Adverse Events [ CTCAE ] version [ v ] 4 criterion ) GE regimen patient . OUTLINE : Patients receive gemcitabine hydrochloride intravenously ( IV ) 30 minute day 1 8 eribulin mesylate IV 2-5 minute day 1 8 . Courses repeat every 21 day absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . After completion study treatment , patient follow every 3 month 36 month .</detailed_description>
