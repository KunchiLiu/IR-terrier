	<brief_summary>Endoscopic retrograde biliary drainage self-expandable metal stent ( SEMS ) use principle palliative method distal biliary obstruction patient pancreaticobiliary cancer . With potentially curative surgical resection impossible , maintenance successful biliary drainage patent stent regard key improve quality life survival patient , could prevent biliary infection liver failure , give patient opportunities anti-cancer chemotherapy and/or radiotherapy . Although SEMSs report superior large bore plastic stent term stent patency , still controversial issue resolve relation stent dysfunction adverse event . It widely accept covered SEMSs design overcome stent failure uncover SEMSs related tumor ingrowth , significant high rate stent migration well tumor overgrowth . Therefore cover SEMSs show clear clinical excellence cumulative stent patency uncover SEMSs , despite clinical result randomize trial favor cover SEMSs . From perspective adverse event pancreatitis cholecystitis , conflict result produce . It initially assume covered SEMSs could cause high incidence pancreatitis cholecystitis attribute occlusion pancreatic duct cystic duct cover material . However , significant difference find regard incidence pancreatitis cholecystitis cover uncovered SEMSs several randomize trial meta-analysis . The aim current study compare cumulative stent patency partially cover uncovered SEMS primary objective , investigate overall patient survival , stent dysfunction-free patient survival , incidence adverse event include stent dysfunction secondary objective .</brief_summary>
