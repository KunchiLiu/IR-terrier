	<brief_summary>The current first line treatment patient EGFR activate mutation lung cancer EGFR TKI . Compared platinum-based chemotherapy , EGFR-TKIs superior term response rate progression-free survival . However , acquire resistance occur almost constantly . The second-line treatment include platinum-based chemotherapy absence contraindication . This chemotherapy administer discontinue EGFR TKIs . However , rebound phenomenon disease describe patient discontinue EGFR TKIs . Some clinical team therefore recommend , precaution , order avoid withdrawal phenomenon , never discontinue EGFR TKIs patient develop EGFR TKI acquire resistance . It seem therefore useful conduct study well define therapeutic strategy adopt patient develop acquire resistance receive EGFR TKIs first line treatment .</brief_summary>
