	<brief_title>Pilot Trial KD018 With Neo-Adjuvant Concurrent Chemo-Radiation Therapy Patients With Locally Advanced Rectal Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This pilot study focus KD018 , standardize well-characterized Chinese herbal medicine , investigate effect agent reduce GI toxicity associate combined modality therapy locally-advanced rectal cancer . In study , KD018 administer concomitantly Capecitabine pelvic radiation therapy ( RT ) neoadjuvant setting , hypothesis KD018 reduce gastrointestinal side effect , namely diarrhea , secondary treatment Capecitabine plus external beam radiation therapy ( EBRT ) . The primary endpoint study investigate grade 3-4 toxicity rate associate course chemo-radiation concomitant Capecitabine KD018 , compare toxicity see patient treated Capecitabine radiation therapy alone , patient T3-T4 N0-N2 , M0 rectal cancer . Secondary objective include assessment radiographic response therapy ( use pelvic MRI ) assessment pathologic CR rate examination pathologic specimen . In addition , perform analysis plasma level pro-inflammatory cytokine chemokines . This trial design accrue approximately 24 patient course 24 month .</detailed_description>
