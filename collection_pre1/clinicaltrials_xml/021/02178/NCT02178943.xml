	<brief_title>Utility Donor-Derived Cell Free DNA Association With Gene Expression Profiling</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>AlloMap Molecular Expression Testing perform single laboratory , assess gene expression profile RNA isolate peripheral blood mononuclear cell ( PBMC ) . Per FDA labeling , AlloMap Testing `` intend aid identification heart transplant recipient stable allograft function low probability moderate/severe acute cellular rejection ( ACR ) time test conjunction standard clinical assessment . '' AlloMap non-invasive , blood test method recommend International Society Heart Lung Transplantation ( ISHLT ) guideline surveillance heart transplant recipient rejection . More 52,000 commercial AlloMap test 12,000 patient report XDx Reference Laboratory Brisbane , California , certify Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendment ( CLIA ) 1988 accredit College American Pathologists . In 2013 , registry study name OAR initiate follow long-term outcome allograft recipient receive commercial AlloMap test surveillance ( NCT01833195 ) . The current objective enroll volunteer participate OAR registry ( 1 ) co-participate observational sub-study , name D-OAR , order study new biomarker , dd-cfDNA . dd-cfDNA propose marker cellular injury cause rejection ( 2 , 3 ) . Because dd-cfDNA AlloMap test measure different signal blood , combination two approach could additive since AlloMap measure host immune response dd-cfDNA monitor graft injury . The dd-cfDNA measurement intend quantitative detection plasma dd-cfDNA % total plasma cell-free DNA . Its utility surveillance tool management heart transplant recipient investigate . This observational sub-study subject co-enrolled participate Outcomes AlloMap Registry ( OAR ) . Blood specimen collect assay dd-cfDNA level visit occur AlloMap testing , per OAR Study . As state OAR study , regular surveillance schedule test AlloMap determine participate center 's standard care .</detailed_description>
