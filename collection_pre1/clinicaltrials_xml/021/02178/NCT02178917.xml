	<brief_summary>Spinal Cord Injury ( SCI ) affect person 's ability move feel sensation body . SCI also indirect cause persistent pain , call Central Neuropathic Pain ( CNP ) . This pain typically develop several month injury . In 30-40 % SCI patient , severe CNP affect everyday live include sleep mood . Many patient give work , injury , pain . Medical treatment CNP moderately effective costly , patient health care system . In previous research , characteristic 'signatures ' brain wave probably related CNP define . Based , novel treatment CNP base neurofeedback develop clinically test five SCI patient . Electroencephalograph ( EEG ) use record patient ' brain wave show patient computer screen simple graphical form ( e.g . bar ) . Patients trained change brain activity , consequence , pain reduce . Patients suffer CNP year receive 40 neurofeedback treatment session , reduce pain several day session . The primary aim study apply neurofeedback therapy large number recently injure patient , still hospital . It hypothesise neurofeedback treatment effective people suffer CNP short period time . The secondary aim study define EEG predictor CNP . EEG record recently injure patient chronic pain , know certain number patient develop CNP within week month . These patient follow year EEGs patient develop CNP compare .</brief_summary>
