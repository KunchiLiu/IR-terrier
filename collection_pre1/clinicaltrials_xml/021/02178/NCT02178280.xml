	<brief_summary>Hilar cholangiocarcinoma highly malignant tumor . Surgical resection simple liver transplantation lead poor prognosis accompany high recurrence rate low survival rate . The newly propose neoadjuvant therapy liver transplantation strategy show promise clinical application , report 5-year survival rate 82 % . However , transplantation center conduct kind research limit due complexity long-term . The investigator would like conduct clinical trial unresectable hilar cholangiocarcinoma patient take neoadjuvant brachytherapy chemoradiotherapy follow orthotopic liver transplantation .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Safety Study Liver Transplantation Hilar Cholangiocarcinoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The enrolled patient prescribe several examination admit hospital consist CT , MRI , MRCP , ECT , PET/CT laboratory test . All preoperative examination must indicate enrolled individual diagnose unresectable hilar cholangiocarcinoma . In addition , repetitive ERCP manipulation need order obtain positive result brush cytology . Of course , enrol patient adherent fundamental principle liver transplantation . We employ I-125 radioactive plastic stent ( patent No : ZL 201610116321.3 ) conduct brachytherapy . Each stent compose drainage tube stab end stabilize effect . Two opposite channel make wall stent parallel drainage lumen , irradiation window lateral wall channel . The diameter channel bit small radioactive seed , length width irradiation window . The stent design immobilize seed radiate properly . The radioactive I-125 seed 4.5 mm long 0.8 mm thick , half-life 60.1 day . The nasobiliary radiography perform determine length involvement bile duct.Corresponding radioactive seed put appropriate location biliary stent ERCP procedure . About month later , external beam radiotherapy administrate target dose 30Gy 30 fraction , 1.5Gy twice per day . Concomitantly , Intravenous capecitabine give 1.0g bid two week , repeat 14 day transplantation . Immunosuppressive therapy provide tacrolimus , mycophenolate corticosteroid . Corticosteroids withdrawn week later . Chemotherapy continue 1 month OLT expect 3 course .</detailed_description>
