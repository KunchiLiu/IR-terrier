	<brief_summary>HIV/Tuberculosis ( TB ) co-infection profound effect host 's immune system . TB common cause death patient HIV worldwide . Rifamycins ( rifampicin [ RIF ] ) important component TB therapy unique activity . The problem protease inhibitor ( PI ) non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor ( NNRTI ) use treat HIV significant drug-drug interaction RIF lead reduce concentration agent risk treatment failure resistance . The non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor ( NNRTI ) efavirenz ( EFV ) present significant drug interaction RIF . EFV-based HIV treatment test patient concomitantly treat RIF-containing TB therapy , demonstrate co-administration use safely effectively . However , side effect profile EFV overlap RIF-containing TB regimens make management treatment toxicity complex . Integrase inhibitor ( INI ) , dolutegravir ( DTG ) , may offer important alternative EFV-based therapy TB coinfected patient . A Phase I drug-drug interaction study conduct healthy , HIV-seronegative subject , show DTG 50 mg twice daily give together RIF well-tolerated result DTG concentration similar DTG 50 mg give daily alone , recommend dose INI-naive patient . Therefore , ART regimens use DTG 50 mg twice daily may represent new treatment option TB-infected patient require concurrent treatment HIV infection . This Phase III b , randomize , open-label study describe efficacy safety DTG EFV-containing ART regimens HIV/TB co-infected patient . This study design assess antiviral activity DTG efavirenz ( EFV ) ART-containing regimens 48 week . A total approximately 115 +/-5 % subject randomly assign 3:2 ratio DTG ( approximately 69 subject ) EFV ( approximately 46 subject ) , respectively . This study include Screening Period , Randomized Phase ( Day 1 48 week plus 4-week extension ) , DTG Open-label extension ( OLE ) . During DTG OLE , subject supply DTG locally approve commercially available , subject long derive clinical benefit , subject meet protocol-defined reason discontinuation , ever come first .</brief_summary>
