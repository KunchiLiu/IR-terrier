	<detailed_description>`` AminoIndex Technology '' develop base high-throughput absolute quantitative analysis method amino acid amine use UFLC-MS , create clinical database search amino acid pattern across different disease include cancer . `` AminoIndex Technology '' evaluate certain health condition possibility diseases analyze balance plasma amino acid . Multicenter study Japan conduct develop blood base biomarker panel cancer . This study wil conduct evaluate performance AminoIndexTM ( gynecological ) biomarker base `` AminoIndex Technology '' gynecological cancer US population . This do analyze plasma metabolite include amino acid , endometrial ovarian cancer patient , patient benign gynecological disease , healthy subject use Liquid Chromatography Mass Spectrometry ( LC-MS ) Liquid Chromatography - Tandem Mass Spectrometry ( LC-MSMS ) .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Participants study patient Primary endometrial ovarian cancer , benign gynecological disease ( uterine fibroid , endometriosis , dysplasia , benign ovarian tumor ) , healthy subject meet follow criterion : Age &gt; 20 year ( data currently available use AminoIndexTM patient 20 year age 80 year age ) Willing follow fasting clinic visit requirement Ability understand consent participate study . Women race ethnic group eligible trial . Women exclude study participation follow reason : An inability fast ( food drink water ) 8 hour prior presurgery sample collection . Are known positive HIV/HCV/HBV Pregnancy breastfeeding ( Pregnant breastfeed woman exclude study amino acid level know differ pregnancy ) . Currently receive investigational agent . History drug therapy surgery treatment gynecological cancer Unable come blood sample collection 6:00 AM 12:00 Noon Currently undergo dialysis Congenital metabolic disease The investigator considers individual ineligible base prior medical history , histology finding</criteria>
