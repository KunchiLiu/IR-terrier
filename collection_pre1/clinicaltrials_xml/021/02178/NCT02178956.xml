	<brief_title>A Study BBI608 Plus Weekly Paclitaxel Treat Gastric Gastro-Esophageal Junction Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The goal study determine paclitaxel give together BBI608 second line therapy prolong overall survival compare paclitaxel alone . Approximately 700 patient randomize histologically cytologically confirm metastatic gastric gastroesophageal junction adenocarcinoma . Patients must fail first line therapy platinum/fluoropyrimidine doublet . BBI608/placebo administer daily , paclitaxel administer i.v . day 1 , 8 15 4 weekly cycle .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Cytologically histologically confirm advanced gastric GEJ adenocarcinoma metastatic locally advanced unresectable . Failed treatment one regimen contain least platinum/fluoropyrimidine doublet unresectable metastatic disease.Treatment failure define progression disease ( clinical radiologic ) first line treatment unresectable metastatic disease ≤ 6 month last dose first line treatment . Paclitaxel therapy appropriate patient recommend Investigator . Imaging investigation include CT/MRI chest/abdomen/pelvis scan necessary document site disease do within 21 day prior randomization . Patients either measurable disease OR nonmeasurable evaluable disease eligible . Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group ( ECOG ) Performance Status 0 1 . ･≥ 18 year age . For male female patient child produce potential : Must agree use contraception take measure avoid pregnancy study 6 month final dose Paclitaxel 30 day female patient 90 day male patient , final BBI608/Placebo dose Paclitaxel administer . Women child bear potential ( WOCBP ) must negative serum urine pregnancy test within 5 day prior randomization . Alanine transaminase ( ALT ) ≤ 3 × institutional upper limit normal ( ULN ) [ ≤ 5 × ULN presence liver metastases ] within 14 day prior randomization . Hemoglobin ( Hgb ) ≥ 9.0 g/dL within 14 day prior randomization . Must require transfusion within 1 week baseline Hgb assessment . Total bilirubin ≤ 1.5 × institutional ULN [ ≤ 2.0 x ULN presence liver metastases ] within 14 day prior randomization . Creatinine ≤ 1.5 × institutional ULN Creatinine Clearance &gt; 50 ml/min ( calculate CockroftGault equation ) within 14 day prior randomization . Absolute neutrophil count ≥ 1.5 x 10^9/L within 14 day prior randomization . Platelet count ≥ 100 x 10^9/L within 14 day prior randomization . Must require transfusion within 1 week baseline platelet assessment . Other baseline laboratory evaluation must do within 14 day prior randomization . Patient must consent provision representative formalin fix paraffin block tumor tissue , available , order specific correlative marker assay may conduct . Patient must consent provision sample blood order specific correlative marker assay may conduct . Patients must accessible treatment follow . Protocol treatment begin within 2 work day patient randomization . The patient receive therapy concurrent clinical study patient agree participate interventional clinical study participation trial study treatment . Patients participate survey observational study eligible participate study . Anticancer chemotherapy biologic therapy administer prior first plan dose BBI608/placebo within period time equivalent usual cycle length regimen . An exception make oral fluoropyrimidines ( e.g . capecitabine , S1 ) , minimum 10 day since last dose must observe prior first plan dose BBI608/placebo.Radiotherapy , immunotherapy , investigational agent within four week first plan dose BBI608/placebo , exception single dose radiation 8 Gray ( equal 800 RAD ) palliative intent pain control 14 day randomization . Prior taxanes neoadjuvant adjuvant set progression occur within 6 month completion taxane therapy ; taxanes metastatic setting . More one prior chemotherapy regimen administer metastatic setting . Major surgery within 4 week prior randomization . Any known symptomatic brain metastasis require steroid . Women pregnant breastfeeding . Gastrointestinal disorder ( ) , opinion Qualified/Principal Investigator , would significantly impede absorption oral agent . Unable unwilling swallow BBI608/placebo capsule daily . Uncontrolled intercurrent illness . Peripheral neuropathy ≥ CTCAE Grade 2 baseline . History malignancy except : adequately treat nonmelanoma skin cancer , curatively treated insitu cancer cervix , solid tumor curatively treat evidence disease ≥ 3 year . Prior treatment BBI608 . Any active disease condition would render protocol treatment dangerous impair ability patient receive protocol therapy . Any condition ( e.g . psychological , geographical , etc . ) permit compliance protocol .</criteria>
