	<brief_summary>Magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) diagnostic technique take picture organ body . It use magnetic field radio wave felt . Perfusion MRI use faster image . It also include contrast material give vein . This make specific organ , blood vessel , tumor easy see . Diffusion MRI let u measure motion water tumor . Perfusion diffusion MRI give extra information available regular MRI . A regular MRI show picture tumor . Thyroid MRI scan part current standard care . The purpose study see new MRI method give u information tumor .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Predictive MRI Metrics Tumor Aggressiveness Papillary Thyroid Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The aim pilot study clinical trial provide MRI biomarkers quantitative ( surrogate ) biomarkers aggressiveness papillary thyroid cancer ( PTC ) include PMCs lay scientific basis translation patient management . In study perform specially design diffusion weight MRI ( DW-MRI ) dynamic contrast agent MRI ( DCE-MRI ) protocols PTC patient . DW-MRI allows quantify water diffusion show related tumor cellularity ( 29 ) . Particularly , appropriate model DW-MRI data acquire multiple b value enable quantify tumor cellularity vascularity simultaneously ( 30-32 ) . DCE-MRI proper compartmental model yield metric related tumor-vessel permeability , tumor perfusion , extracellular-extravascular volume fraction ( 33 , 34 ) . These fact provide potential DW-MRI DCE-MRI metric quantitative image biomarkers tumor aggressiveness PTCs . The DW-MRI DCE-MRI may ultimately help personalized management approach , image biomarkers may use recommend either immediate surgery active surveillance PTC patient .</detailed_description>
