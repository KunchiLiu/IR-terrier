	<criteria>Subjects histologically cytologically NSCLC , melanoma , transitional cell carcinoma GU tract , renal cell cancer , triple negative breast cancer , adenocarcinoma endometrium squamous cell carcinoma head neck ( Phase 1 ) Subjects histologically confirm melanoma , NSCLC , transitional cell carcinoma GU tract , TNBC , SCCHN , ovarian cancer , MSI high CRC , RCC DLBCL ( Phase 2 ) Life expectancy &gt; 12 week . Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group ( ECOG ) performance status 0 1 . Presence measurable disease per Response Evaluation Criteria Solid Tumors ( RECIST ) 1.1 Lugano Classification subject DLBCL . Laboratory medical history parameter within protocoldefined range . For Phase 1 : Subjects advance metastatic disease note receive least one prior therapy advance metastatic disease curative treatment available may enrol . For Phase 2 expansion cohort : Subjects NSCLC , melanoma , transitional cell carcinoma GU tract , SCCHN , ovarian cancer , MSI high CRC , RCC , DLBCL , TNBC . Phase 2 expansion : NSCLC Subjects receive least 1 prior platinumbased therapy . Subjects nonplatinumbased regimen may enrol medical monitor approval . Tumors epidermal growth factor receptor mutation positive anaplastic lymphoma kinase fusion oncogene positive treated tyrosine kinase inhibitor permit ; however , subject progress intolerant targeted therapy . Subjects must receive immunotherapy PD1 CTLA4 target therapy . Phase 2 expansion : Melanoma Documentation V600Eactivating BRAF mutation status Subjects must receive immunotherapy antiPD1 , antiPDL1 , antiCTLA4 therapy . Exception : Prior anti−CTLA4 adjuvant set would permit . Ocular melanoma exclude . Phase 2 expansion : Transitional cell carcinoma GU tract Metastatic locally advance amenable curative therapy disease progression platinumbased chemotherapy alternative therapy platinumbased therapy appropriate . Prior PD1 CTLA4 target therapy exclude Phase 2 expansion : SCCHN Histologically confirm metastatic recurrent squamous cell carcinoma amenable local therapy curative intent ( surgery radiation without chemotherapy ) . Carcinoma nasopharynx , salivary gland , nonsquamous histology exclude . Subjects must receive least 1 prior systemic chemotherapy regimen must include platinumbased therapy . Prior PD1 CTLA4 target therapy exclude . Phase 2 expansion : Ovarian cancer Subjects FIGO Stage Ic , Stage II , Stage III , Stage IV , recurrent , persistent ( unresectable ) histologically confirm epithelial ovarian cancer , primary peritoneal cancer , fallopian tube carcinoma . Subjects must receive platinumtaxanebased regimen firstline therapy . Prior PD1 CTLA4 target therapy exclude . Borderline , lowmalignantpotential epithelial carcinoma per histopathology exclude . Phase 2 expansion : Relapsed refractory DLBCL Prior allogeneic stemcell transplantation exclude . Must receive &gt; = 1 prior treatment regimen . Not candidate curative therapy hematopoietic stemcell transplantation ( either due disease burden , fitness , preference ) . Prior PD1 CTLA4 target therapy exclude . Phase 2 expansion : TNBC Histologically confirm breast adenocarcinoma unresectable loco regional , metastatic Pathologically confirm triple negative , source document , define follow : Estrogen receptor ( ER ) progesterone receptor ( PgR ) negative Human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 ( HER2 ) negative per American Society Clinical Oncology/College American Pathologists guideline Subject must receive least 1 prior systemic regimen advance metastatic disease Prior PD1 CTLA4 target therapy exclude . Phase 2 expansion : RCC Subjects histological cytological confirmation clear cell RCC . Not curable surgery . Subjects must receive prior antiangiogenic therapy Subjects must receive prior immunotherapy antiPD1 , antiPDL1 , antiCTLA4 therapy Phase 2 expansion : MSI high CRC Subjects histological confirmation locally advance unresectable metastatic MSI high CRC MSI status , respectively , determine examine CRC tumor Tumor biopsy require . If subject inaccessible lesion , ovarian cancer , highly vascular lesion , RCC , enrollment may consider medical monitor approval , archive tissue may acceptable . Females childbearing potential male use adequate birth control 120 day post dose . • Subjects participate study receipt investigational study drug device occur within 28 day 5 halflives ( whichever longer ) prior first dose . Has receive prior therapy antiPD1 , antiPDL1 , antiPDL2 , antiCD137 , antiCytotoxic Tlymphocyteassociated antigen4 ( CTLA4 ) antibody ( include ipilimumab antibody drug specifically target Tcell costimulation checkpoint pathway ) . Exception : Prior anti−CTLA4 adjuvant set subject melanoma would permit . Has know active central nervous system ( CNS ) metastases and/or carcinomatous meningitis . Subjects previously treat brain metastasis may participate provide stable . Has active autoimmune disease . Has evidence interstitial lung disease pneumonitis .
