	<brief_title>Omega-3 Fatty Acids Supplementation Atherothrombotic Biomarkers Type 2 Diabetes Cardiovascular Disease .</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The study provide insight : 1 . The influence baseline level omega-3 PUFA patient type 2 diabetes mellitus ( T2D ) CVD endothelial function , platelet aggregation thrombotic , inflammatory , oxidative stress biomarkers . 2 . The potential improve endothelial function , reduce oxidative stress decrease atherothrombotic inflammatory biomarkers supplementation moderate dose omega-3 PUFA 3 . The mechanism clinically observed effect omega-3 PUFA T2D patient CVD . SCIENTIFIC BACKGROUND The incidence diabetes grow world number patient already exceed 360 million 2030 rise 552 million . The major source mortality morbidity diabetic patient cardiovascular disease ( CVD ) . On average , estimate people type 2 diabetes ( T2D ) die 5-10 year people without T2D , mostly due CVD . The treatment CVD account large part huge healthcare cost attributable T2D ( 10-12 % European health care expenditure ) . Despite significant improvement treatment CVD antiplatelet agent , statin , angiotensin convert enzyme inhibitor ( ACEI ) new antidiabetic drug mortality diabetic patient CVD continuously significantly high people without T2D . This pattern elevate cardiovascular risk diabetes attribute several possible mediating factor , include development extensive , multi-vessel coronary artery disease , presence impair myocardial systolic contractility , diffuse small vessel endothelial dysfunction presence hypercoagulable pro-thrombotic state attributable diabetes . The increased cardiovascular risk T2D patient generate metabolic disturbance relate diabetes ( hyperglycaemia hypoglycaemia ) include : - irreversible glycation intra- extracellular protein lead change gene expression induction oxidative stress lead endothelial dysfunction , - activation protein kinase C result activation blood coagulation , - increase level various pro-atherothrombotic inflammatory biomarkers e.g . marker platelet activation , thrombin generation , endothelin , von Willebrand factor , adhesion molecule ( eg.VCAM-1 , vascular endothelial cell adhesion molecule ) , growth factor ( VEGF ) , factor VII , CRP , IL-6 ( interleukin-6 ) . Moreover recently describe hyperglycemia T2D lead nonenzymatic glycation fibrinogen . Glycated fibrinogen lead denser fibrin clot stiffer resistant fibrinolysis , thus lead increase thrombotic burden , - alter secretion adipokines adipose tissue obese subject T2D . It demonstrate great adiposity e.g . down-regulates secretion adiponectin , adipokine anti-inflammatory insulin-sensitizing property . All pro-atherothrombotic mechanism T2D patient could potentially subject new development treatment , especially patient CVD . A therapy continue show great promise indication supplementation omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acid ( PUFA ) although underlie mechanism beneficial action precisely know . Numerous prospective retrospective trial show omega-3 PUFA supplementation decrease risk major cardiovascular event , myocardial infarction , sudden cardiac death , coronary heart disease , atrial fibrillation , recently , death patient heart failure . However , none trial perform T2D patient CVD high risk event benefit could considerable clinical importance . Moreover knowledge , randomize , double-blind , placebo-controlled clinical trial explore mechanisms omega-3 treatment T2D patient document cardiovascular disease . Despite fact , Polish Diabetes Association guideline recommend use omega-3 PUFA patient diabetes prevention macrovascular complication . Moreover , unclear whether benefit modify pathophysiological process supplementation omega-3 PUFA occur patient deficiency patient type 2 diabetes . Although several potential benefit consider therapy omega-3 PUFA T2D patient atherosclerotic vascular disease , effect require detailed appraisal clinical study . They : 1 . Platelet activation resistance antiplatelet agent . Platelet dysfunction diabetes mellitus related several mechanism - include metabolic derangement , oxidative stress , endothelial dysfunction . They lead high platelet reactivity associate atherothrombotic complication patient T2DM . Therefore antiplatelet therapy one cornerstone secondary prevention atherothrombotic event patient T2DM . Recent evidence suggest clinical efficacy aspirin clopidogrel compromise subject diabetes mechanism entirely clear . This one reason diabetic patient continue high risk adverse cardiovascular event compare non-diabetic patient . The antiplatelet effect n-3 PUFA explore inconsistent finding . Recently , investigator demonstrate addition n-3 PUFA combination aspirin clopidogrel significantly potentiate platelet response clopidogrel percutaneous coronary intervention ( PCI ) . So far , study evaluate effect n-3 PUFA platelet reactivity response antiplatelet agent patient T2D CVD . 2 . Coagulation fibrinolysis . In patient T2D general increase plasma level procoagulant factor accompany decreased fibrinolytic capacity . The mechanisms alteration complex , insulin resistance hyperglycaemia clear culprit . The net result change increase tendency clot formation , fibrin network display compact structure resistance fibrinolysis . Moreover , increase fibrinogen level observe diabetes correlate degree hyperglycemia fibrinogen glycation affect fibrin polymerization factor XIII-mediated crosslinking . Of note , impaired metabolic control mark fluctuation plasma glucose level show related hypofibrinolysis associate formation dense fibrin clot . The difference fibrin clot structure susceptibility lysis find occur type 2 diabetes may contribute increase CVD risk diabetic patient . A number measure reduce hypercoagulable environment diabetes include glycaemic control , avoidance hypoglycaemia improvement insulin sensitivity . Of pharmacological agent use patient T2D CVD , metformin , aspirin , statins angiotensin convert enzyme inhibitor favourable effect coagulation system show reduce cardiovascular event diabetes . Although unclear whether n-3 PUFA clinically relevant effect insulin resistance human , may affect coagulation system directly via several mechanism . It show apparently healthy subject , omega-3 PUFA increase decrease plasma fibrinogen clot factor , particular factor VII activity , factor VIII von Willebrand factor concentration . There study indicate fish oil supplementation may reduce thrombin generation . Conversely , study fail demonstrate significant change circulate marker thrombosis follow administration omega-3 PUFA . Of note , study conduct patient without diabetes , knowledge effect omega-3 T2D patient CVD treat optimal pharmacotherapy ( include drug affect coagulation ) limit . Regarding effect omega-3 PUFAs fibrinolytic activity finding controversial . In single study perform 20 year ago intake omega-3 PUFAs associate increase plasma plasminogen activator inhibitor ( PAI-1 ) activity non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus patient . Interestingly , recent study , PAI-1 concentration activity increase follow high omega-3 PUFAs beverage compare low omega-3 PUFAs beverage men metabolic syndrome . It also demonstrate respect fibrinolytic measurement , acute chronic intake fish oil may show opposite effect , although underlying mechanistic basis understood . Further research need potentially adverse effect coagulation patient glycometabolic disorder . 3 . Endothelial dysfunction oxidative stress A large body evidence link endothelial dysfunction human diabetes mellitus . Endothelial dysfunction T2D contribute pathogenesis clinical expression atherosclerosis promote inflammation , thrombosis , arterial stiffness , impaired regulation arterial tone flow . Increased oxidative stress vasculature important mechanism endothelial dysfunction insulin resistance diabetes mellitus . For example , circulate marker oxidative stress , include F2 isoprostanes antibody oxidize low density lipoprotein , increase human T2D . In recent year , grow evidence link intake omega-3 PUFA improvement endothelial function . The mechanisms omega-3 PUFAs might influence endothelial function likely multiple complex . They could include suppression thromboxane A2 cyclic endoperoxides , reduce production cytokine , augment endothelial synthesis nitric oxide , improvement vascular smooth muscle cell sensitivity nitric oxide , reduce expression endothelial adhesion molecule . The reduction oxidative stress omega-3 PUFA patient T2D may important factor responsible improvement endothelial function . However , enough data improvement endothelial function reduction oxidative stress patient T2D establish CVD . 4 . Inflammation Chronic inflammation may participate pathogenesis insulin resistance , type 2 diabetes , cardiovascular disease may common denominator link obesity disease state . A variety circulate proinflammatory cytokine acute-phase reactant increase obesity , type 2 diabetes , cardiovascular disease . Moreover , chronic low-grade inflammation occur adipose tissue obese individual link increased insulin resistance lead disturbance adipokines secretion . Although divergent data whether omega-3 PUFA reduce inflammation may modulate adipokine secretion adipose tissue . It demonstrate increase plasma adiponectin level , could potential mechanism EPA DHA improve insulin sensitivity . They also induce leptin visfatin secretion reduce expression several proinflammatory cytokine adipose tissue , include tumor necrosis factor TNFα , IL-6 , monocyte chemotactic protein MCP-1 , PAI-1 . However , clinical study whether omega-3 PUFA supplementation modulate adipose tissue inflammation T2D patient CVD .</detailed_description>
