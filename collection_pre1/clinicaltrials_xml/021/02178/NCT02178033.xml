	<brief_summary>An adequate level bowel preparation crucial efficacy safety colonoscopy . Strong evidence suggest bowel-preparation quality show inverse correlation length interval end cleanse agent intake start colonoscopy ( short interval associate good preparation level ) . Accordingly , use split-dose administration regimen demonstrate significantly improve quality preparation , besides patient acceptability , compare standard administration day colonoscopy . All randomize control trial compare split versus standard preparation primarily aim assess quality colon cleansing , mean either validate not-validated colon cleansing scale . The impact split dose regimen objective colonoscopy performance measure adenoma detection rate ( ADR ) never specifically prospectively evaluate . The present study aim evaluate whether split-dose preparation regimen associate increase adenoma detection . For purpose , asymptomatic subject age 50-69 , undergoing screen colonoscopy positive immunologic fecal occult blood test randomize 1:1 ratio receive low-volume ( 2L ) PEG plus ascorbic acid solution either split-dose ( study arm ) full-dose regimen ( control arm ) . Treatments allocate use computer-generated , randomized code list . The treatment allocation conceal accomplished screen visit non-research personnel involve study . To ensure masking , endoscopists perform colonoscopy involve randomization process pre-procedure data collection . In study primary outcome measure proportion patient least one adenoma ( Adenoma Detection Rate ) harm . Data bowel cleansing , patient compliance , tolerability acceptability also collect . A sample size least 514 patient ( 257 arm ) calculate , hypothesize relative increase 25 % adenoma detection rate split dose preparation group , assume 40 % prevalence one adenoma FIT-positive patient undergo screen colonoscopy ( significance level 0.05 , 90 % power ) .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>All participant receive low-volume ( 2L ) PEG plus ascorbic acid solution ( MOVIPREPÂ®* , Norgine , Harefield , United Kingdom ; liter contain 100.0 g macrogol 3350 , 7.5 g sodium sulfate,2.7 g sodium chloride , 1.0 g potassium chloride , 4.7 g ascorbic acid , 5.9 g sodium ascorbate , lemon orange flavoring ) . Patients allocate `` control arm '' receive whole preparation day colonoscopy , whereas , patient randomly allocate `` active treatment '' take one liter bowel preparation even procedure remain liter day procedure . Participants also receive standardize low-fiber diet colonoscopy , avoid fruit , legumes vegetable 3 day procedure . They normal breakfast light lunch day procedure , solid food permit since . Liquid food ( e.g. , clear soup yoghurt ) permit even meal . Clear fluid take time , 2 hour procedure . Treatments allocate use computer-generated , randomized code list . The treatment allocation conceal accomplished screen visit non-research personnel involve study . To ensure masking , endoscopists perform colonoscopy involve randomization process pre-procedure data collection . Data patient compliance , tolerability acceptability collect morning colonoscopy , immediately procedure , nurse question standardised questionnaire . The endoscopist allow take part question supervise questionnaire .</detailed_description>
