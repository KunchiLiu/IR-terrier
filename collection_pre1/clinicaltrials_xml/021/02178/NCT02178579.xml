	<brief_summary>Cancer treatment , use proteasome inhibitor , potential induce cardiac toxicity include heart failure ( HF ) , hypertension , arrhythmias ischemic heart disease . While presence cardiac event may class effect proteasome inhibitor , effect may profound irreversible inhibition carfilzomib compare reversible inhibition bortezomib . Data available currently publish clinical trial may inadequate fully understand incidence severity cardiac injury patient treat proteasome inhibitor trial design fully assess cardiac event . The purpose study well define understand potential cardiac toxicity begin understand optimal management strategy .</brief_summary>
