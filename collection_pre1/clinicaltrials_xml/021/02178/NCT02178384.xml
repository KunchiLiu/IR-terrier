	<brief_summary>The two structure support mandibular distal extension removable partial denture differ markedly visco-elastic response loading . The difference resilience residual ridge tissue teeth permit periodontal ligament present disparity support contrast uniform support accord tooth-supported removable partial denture . Hence denture tend rotate distal abutment , induce heavy torsional stress alveolar ridge . Many method use control movement , : 1 . Implant support distal extension removable . 2 . Stress breaker provide mean interposing flexible connection tooth-borne retainer portion removable partial denture distally extend tissue-borne segment . 3 . Altered-cast technique . 4 . Design development use mesial indirect retainer rather distal one . The purpose study : ( 1 ) compare bone absorption around abutment teeth nearby free saddle ; ( 2 ) denture displacement pressure soft tissue denture base distal extension RPD ( Removable Partial Denture ) ( 3 ) cellular change soft tissue denture base distal extension RPD .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Removable partial denture ( RPD ) essential role treat partly edentulous . patient large toothless space , without posterior dental support ( Kennedy Class I ) . Rehabilitation Distal-Extension Removable Partial Denture ( DERPD ) deserve special attention difference resilience remain mucosa edentulous area periodontal ligament abutment tooth . When occlusal force affect base , difference resilience mucosa edentulous area periodontal ligament abutment teeth create rotate movement whose axis locate occlusal rest abutment teeth . This may induce horizontal force mainly lateral force upon , cause inflammation , gingival retraction , increase dental mobility distal residual ridge resorption . This movement may cause reduction function , discomfort trauma RPD support tissue . MATERIAL AND METHODS : Patients recruit Department Prosthodontics University Damascus Dental School . Thirty patient randomly divide three group ( A , B , C ) . A mandibular bilateral distal-extension removable partial denture use patient group . But every group specific method distribute load force . In Group A : A Removable partial denture make use altered-cast technique free saddle.The investigator make primary impression use stock tray . This follow final impression individual tray . After metal framework try-in , ridge region remove uncorrected master cast saw . Then , corrective impression ridge obtain soft ZOE impression paste . Therefore , metal framework associate corrective impression reposition tooth portion master cast prior alter distal-extension base . In Group B : Removable partial denture make use precision attachment locate last abutment tooth . At first , crown prepare receive precision attachment , cement respective abutment teeth . So mean interpose flexible connection tooth-borne retainer portion removable partial denture distally extend tissue-borne base provide . In Group C : Removable partial denture make use resilient-layer distal extension removable partial denture .</detailed_description>
