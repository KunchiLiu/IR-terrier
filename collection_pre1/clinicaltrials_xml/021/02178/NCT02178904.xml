	<detailed_description>Coronary artery disease lead cause morbidity mortality United States . At present , professional guideline endorse use array non-invasive test patient suspect coronary artery disease , limited one two approach : 1 ) physiologic demonstration ischemia functional stress test 2 ) anatomic visualization stenosis coronary compute tomographic angiography . Stress test physiologic assessment coronary disease perform commonly prognostic value unsurpassed non-invasive test , risk cardiac event escalate exponentially increase inducible hypoperfusion . However , despite high report performance , `` real world '' accuracy stress test less sanguine demonstrates generally poor discrimination specific vessel accommodate coronary lesion cause ischemia . These finding encourage adoption stress test , positron emission tomography , offer reliable attenuation correction , increase count sensitivity , low radiation dose enhance diagnostic performance . Positron emission tomography also enable measure absolute myocardial blood flow . Coronary compute tomographic angiography alternative test evaluate coronary disease direct anatomic visualization stenosis manner similar cardiac catheterization . Similarly , employ invasive fractional flow reserve identify ischemia , high-grade stenosis observe computed tomography causal ischemia less half time . Multicenter randomize trial data examine invasive method demonstrate combined anatomic-physiologic approach catheterization fractional flow reserve improve identification patient may benefit revascularization , restrict revascularization high-grade stenosis specifically cause ischemia . Nevertheless , combination catheterization fractional flow reserve invasive , widely adopt clinical practice , costly . Computed tomography perfusion novel non-invasive technique evaluate physiologic significance coronary disease , perform add single image acquisition compute tomography setting . The combination compute tomography perfusion compute tomography may represent ideal `` one-stop shop '' may allow anatomic physiologic evaluation coronary disease , serve effective gatekeeper cardiac catheterization , good identify patient would benefit revascularization . The emergence dual energy compute tomography technique enable potentially improve perfusion assessment . In particular , projection-based dual energy compute tomography novel compute tomography method incorporate energy-dependent model basis material decomposition within tissue , may allow absolute quantification myocardial blood [ iodine ] volume high accuracy allow single energy monochromatic imaging retain image stability reduce common compute tomography artifact . Both measure projection-based dual energy compute tomography enable quantitative assessment myocardial iodine uptake , diagnostic performance dual energy compute tomography compare nuclear stress test test systematically date . To date , integrate anatomic-physiologic approach non-invasive method lacking , largely due lack test capable provide accurate anatomic physiologic data single setting . The DECIDE-Gold trial prospective multicenter study evaluate diagnostic performance dual energy compute tomography perfusion detection exclusion hemodynamically significant coronary artery disease , define fractional flow reserve , reference standard . The targeted population subject suspect coronary artery disease refer non-emergent clinically-indicated invasive coronary angiography rest-stress nuclear imaging . The study consider non-significant risk investigator blind dual energy compute tomography perfusion analysis part play role subject 's medical treatment clinical course .</detailed_description>
