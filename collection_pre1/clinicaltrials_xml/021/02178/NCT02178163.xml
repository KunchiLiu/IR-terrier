	<brief_summary>This research trial study comprehensive genomic analysis tissue sample patient non-small cell lung cancer come back stage IV . Comprehensive genomic analysis may identify specific gene mutation ( change deoxyribonucleic acid [ DNA ] ) help doctor tailor treatment target specific mutation .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Comprehensive Genomic Analysis Tissue Samples From Patients With Recurrent Stage IV Non-small Cell Lung Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To assess percentage advance non-small cell lung cancer patient therapy initiate base genomic analysis tumor specimen . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . To estimate percentage patient genomic analysis perform . II . To assess progression free survival response rate patient start therapy base genomic analysis result . OUTLINE : Patients undergo collection tissue sample genomic analysis via mass spectrometry , polymerase chain reaction ( PCR ) , microarray . Based result genomic analysis , patient may begin therapy . After completion study treatment , patient follow every 3 month 2 year , every 6 month 3 year , every 12 month thereafter .</detailed_description>
