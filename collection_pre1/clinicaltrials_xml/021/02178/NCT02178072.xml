	<brief_summary>The purpose study assess activity 5-azacitidine patient Human Papilloma Virus ( HPV ) -positive HPV- negative head neck squamous cell carcinoma ( HNSCC ) . The response activity determine analyze tumor tissue prior treatment 5-azacitidine . Preliminary study mice bear human head neck cancer head neck cancer cell culture laboratory suggest treatment 5-azacitidine increase change cancer cell lead death . This study design determine similar change occur cancer cell patient head neck cancer . The study also aim determine amount specific type protein , p53 treatment . Research show p53 protein associate anti-tumor activity . Finally , study measure amount specific type protein call interferon tumor tissue . Interferons protein make release body response pathogens ( disease cause agent ) virus , bacteria , tumor cell . Interferons allow communication cell trigger protective defense immune system remove pathogen ( disease cause agent ) tumor .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Primary Objectives : The primary objective study • investigate response ( proliferation , apoptosis ) , well reactivation p53 pathways patient treat 5-azacitadine HPV-positive HPV-negative HNSCC . Secondary Objectives The secondary objective study : - investigate response ( proliferation , apoptosis ) , well reactivation IFN pathways patient treat 5-azacitadine HPV-positive HPV-negative HNSCC . - investigate clinical activity 5-azacitadine patient HPV-positive HPV-negative HNSCC . - investigate safety 5-azacitadine patient HPV-positive HPV-negative HNSCC</detailed_description>
