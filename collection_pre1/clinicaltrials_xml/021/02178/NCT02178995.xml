	<brief_summary>Methylphenidate ( MPH ) long use improve attention cognitive difficulty associate ADHD , include child ADHD epilepsy ( Torres et al. , 2008 ) . Methylphenidate ( MPH ) also helpful treat attention cognitive difficulty variety neurological medical condition ( Kajs-Wyllie , 2002 ; Prommer , 2012 ) . We seek evaluate potential efficacy safety medication treat attention deficit , well cognitive difficulty , experience adult patient epilepsy . To knowledge , currently study explicitly examine impact MPH measureable attention deficit cognitive deficit adult patient epilepsy . We hope quantify impact , , methylphenidate attention , addition specific measureable cognitive function , patient cognitive complaint epilepsy , contribute grow body evidence support safety methylphenidate 's use attention deficit patient epilepsy . As effective treatment attention cognitive difficulty patient epilepsy currently available , MPH could represent important option treatment patient .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Prospective participant seizure identify primarily Stanford Neurology Neuropsychiatry clinic Stanford Medical Center , assistance clinic staff provider . Participants may also identify referred physician community well . Informational flier distribute clinic throughout Stanford Medical Center Stanford campus order identify participant epilepsy well healthy volunteer . Prospective participant may also contact study staff directly via contact information list flier provide provider . Those identify contact , either person telephone , study staff . A telephone in-person pre-screening occur , expect last approximately 20-30 minute , order determine eligibility study , interest participating , question relate study . A brief summary study procedure goal review pre-screening . Participants meet inclusion/exclusion criterion may take part initial in-person visit Stanford Medical Center , inform consent obtain sign ( see attach informed consent form ) . Any additional history need order confirm participant 's eligibility review visit . If individual chooses proceed , participant 's blood pressure heartrate measure , necessary ( recent physical exam include cardiac auscultation available ) , brief physical exam perform licensed physician . If vital sign exam ( necessary ) normal , participant ask complete neuropsychiatric questionnaire , self-report questionnaire , quality-of-life questionnaire , seizure diary . The full 40-minute neurocognitive battery perform , baseline score obtain . Participants ask complete seizure diary per week , either in-person visit home . Thereafter , participant ask attend least three additional 2-hour session Stanford Medical Center . The participant ask avoid take non-routine sedating medication within 24 hour his/her schedule visit , refrain eating , drink caffeine , smoke 2 hour prior his/her visit . When participant arrives , give either placebo , 20mg methylphenidate , 10mg methylphenidate ( randomize blind research pharmacy ) , ask remain within hospital 1 hour prior test allow medication enter system . Both study staff participant blind whether receive active medication placebo . During time , participant complete self-report questionnaire report medication change , medical event , significant adverse event , seizure diary review kept study staff . After , full neurocognitive battery complete . Following completion neurocognitive testing , participant 's next visit schedule approximately time day approximately one week , payment provide . This procedure repeat next two visit . Participants receive additional study drug period single dose receive in-person . At participant 's fourth visit , ask repeat neuropsychiatric questionnaire visit # 1 , well usual self-report form seizure diary . Heartrate blood pressure obtain prior administration neurocognitive battery . At end fourth visit , participant ask wish take part four-week open-label phase study , design evaluate ongoing efficacy safety methylphenidate use patient epilepsy . Regardless answer , payment provide fourth visit . Those participant interested participate open-label trial provide prescription two week methylphenidate 10mg PO BID , follow two week methylphenidate 20mg PO BID . Participants provide copy seizure diary ask complete weekly . Participants able contact protocol director phone report significant side effect adverse event trial . At protocol director 's discretion , keep standard care medication , dosage medication may lower ( minimum dose 5mg PO BID ) response side effect experience participant period . Participants open-label trial ask return four week fifth final visit . Participants ask refrain eating , caffeine , nicotine 2 hour prior visit , take prescribed methylphenidate upon arrive Stanford Medical Center . Participants wait 1 hour medication enter system , time complete neuropsychiatric self-report questionnaire , seizure diary review , heart rate blood pressure measure . The cognitive battery administer . Afterwards , participant question answer final financial compensation provide , participant 's involvement end . Data remain blind completion study . Participants wish receive active medication follow termination open-label phase study may discretion physician .</detailed_description>
