	<brief_summary>The purpose study try understand experience labor differs among woman . The investigator want understand woman longer short labor amount pain woman experience different . The investigator hope able consider woman individually term pain progress labor .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Genetic Demographic Factors That Influence Pain Progress Labor</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>There enormous variability among woman progress normal labor . Labor require complex integrate interplay decidua , uterine cervix myometrium take minute , day week occur incompletely understood . Understanding biological variable underlie difference labor progress hamper lack appropriate model allow sensitive statistical analysis . Identification genetic physiognomic factor impact normal labor progress allow individualization labor management well use societal resource . Structural model labor progress first propose Friedman 1950s Columbia University . Aspects Friedman 's model , deceleration phase , debate since time Friedman 's model allow identification quantification latent active phase labor population . These concept modify World Health Organization WHO Partogram , use result reduced requirement oxytocin reduce incidence cesarean section . Dr . Flood 's group develop continuous bi-exponential model labor progress sigmoidal model labor pain investigator statistically experimentally validated several independent database . The investigator model use prospectively individual labor large cohort identify variable significantly affect progress labor . The investigator find previous work parturients carry G 27th amino acid beta-2 adrenergic receptor ( Î²2AR ) develop labor pain rapidly parturients common allele [ 1 ] . investigator also find catechol-O-methyltransferase ( COMT ) rs4633 genotype TT result slow latent phase rate , oxytocin receptor rs53576 genotype GG transition active labor earlier [ 2 ] . In new project , investigator plan use big data base , detect gene association , test pharmacogenetic variation could explain different response medication dose among patient .</detailed_description>
