	<detailed_description>This study evaluate GSK1265744 , investigational , injectable HIV medicine . The purpose study evaluate safety , tolerability , pharmacokinetics GSK1265744 healthy , HIV-uninfected adult . Study researcher evaluate use GSK1265744 prevention HIV infection ( know pre-exposure prophylaxis [ PrEP ] ) treatment HIV infection . This study enroll two cohort participant ( Cohort 1 Cohort 2 ) . Within cohort , participant randomly assign one two group : Group 1 receive GSK1265744 tablet ( also call oral 744 ) injection ( also call GSK1265744 long act 744LA ) , Group 2 receive placebo tablet injection . Participants Cohort 1 attend several study visit Week 81 Week 105 . Participants Cohort 2 attend several study visit Week 85 Week 109 . From study entry Week 4 , participant cohort take GSK1265744 tablet ( Group 1 ) placebo tablet ( Group 2 ) day . For 1 week participant stop take assigned tablet , study researcher assess safety tolerability . If safety tolerability concern identify , participant enter injection phase study . Participants Cohort 1 receive two injection GSK1265744 ( Group 1 ) placebo ( Group 2 ) Weeks 5 , 17 , 29 . Participants Cohort 2 receive one injection GSK1265744 ( Group 1 ) placebo ( Group 2 ) Weeks 5 , 9 , 17 , 25 , 33 . All study visit include HIV counseling , physical examination , medical history review , blood collection . Select study visit include adherence counseling , central nervous system ( CNS ) symptom assessment , behavioral acceptability assessment , urine collection , electrocardiogram ( ECG ) , rectal and/or vaginal swab .</detailed_description>
