	<detailed_description>Study Hypothesis : Our hypothesis pre-treating patient COPD inhale treprostinil prior pulmonary rehabilitation session result improve exercise tolerance session . This turn lead increase response pulmonary rehabilitation , result improve exercise tolerance quality life . Study Background : Pulmonary rehabilitation ( PR ) widely accept intervention patient advance COPD . This consistently show improve patient ' quality life functional ability . Indeed , enrollment completion course PR prerequisite prior major intervention lung volume reduction surgery transplantation . A typical course PR include 20 session supervise exercise educational activity 8 week period . Sessions usually hold three time per week last 2-3 hour . Most patient COPD ventilatory limitation exercise many oxygen dependent , minority patient true hypoxic limitation exercise . Nonetheless , patient COPD ambulate oxygen feel well walk . Indeed , supplemental oxygen remain one intervention demonstrate associated improved survival patient COPD . There study case report utilize inhaled pulmonary vasodilator patient COPD , although none date use treprostinil . One study 10 patient COPD pulmonary hypertension find improve gas exchange exercise tolerance follow use inhaled iloprost alternative inhale pulmonary vasodilator . No adverse effect observe . [ Dernaika TA , Beavin M , Kinasewitz GT . Iloprost improve gas exchange exercise tolerance patient pulmonary hypertension chronic obstructive pulmonary disease . Respiration ; 2010 : 79 ( 5 ) : 377-382 . ) ] A case report patient pulmonary hypertension COPD find sustained improvement exercise tolerance regular use inhale iloprost . [ Hegewald MJ , Elliott CG . Sustained improvement iloprost COPD patient severe pulmonary hypertension . Chest 2009 ; 135 ( 2 ) : 536-537 . ] While limited trial support concept physiologic improvement use inhale pulmonary vasodilator COPD , study differs several important way . This study unique never prior similar study medication pretreatment prior PR enhance exercise performance patient subgroup . Furthermore , treprostinil yet evaluate use need basis . Indication Studied : COPD/Pulmonary rehabilitation Study Objectives : - Primary Objective : To determine effect inhaled treprostinil , administer prior pulmonary rehabilitation session , six minute walk test distance ( 6MWT ) COPD patient complete 8 week course pulmonary rehabilitation - Secondary Objectives : To assess effect inhale treprostinil , administer prior pulmonary rehabilitation COPD patient , secondary outcome include quality life ( measured St. George 's respiratory questionnaire , Clinical COPD Questionaire ) , BODE index , low nadir oxygen saturation 6 minute walk test , number exacerbation , ER visit , hospitalization , change measure strength training . Trial Design : An adaptive , prospective , randomize , double-blind , placebo-controlled study 34 patient advanced COPD refer pulmonary rehabilitation . All patient screen baseline arterial blood gas . A test dose inhale nitric oxide ( NO ) administer subject 2-5 minute . An ABG repeat . Patients worsen A-a gradient screen . Patients randomize receive one dose inhale treprostinil placebo prior exercise session . All patient pretreated albuterol prior dose inhaled treprostinil ( placebo ) . Patient Population : We plan screen 50 patient goal enrol 34 patient . Patients refer pulmonary rehabilitation Inova Fairfax Hospital moderate severe COPD primary diagnosis screen inclusion trial .
