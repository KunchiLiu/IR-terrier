	<brief_summary>Background : - Alpha-mannosidosis rare inherit disorder . It cause problem many organ tissue body . It occur child adult . Because treatment disease , researcher want find . Objective : - To learn Alpha-mannosidosis . Eligibility : - People age 5-60 Alpha-mannosidosis . Design : - Participants recruit patient support organization medical genetics clinic . - Participants 3 study visit , year . A final evaluation make 3 year . - Participants medical history physical exam . - Blood sample urine sample collect . - Cerebrospinal fluid collect . A small area lower back numbed medicine . A thin needle insert spine bone . About 2 tablespoon spinal fluid remove . - Brain magnetic resonance spectroscopy ( MRS ) scan do visit . MRS use strong magnetic field radio wave take picture chemical brain scanner . The participant lie table slide cylinder . While scanner participant hear loud knocking noise . They get earplugs earmuff muffle sound . Medicines might use keep participant asleep MRS. - Participants skin biopsy first visit . A small area participant skin numb . A small circle skin remove biopsy tool .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Alpha-mannosidosis ( AMD ) inherit lysosomal storage disorder cause mutation LAMAN gene , encode lysosomal alpha-mannosidase characterize neurodevelopmental delay , mild immune deficiency , facial skeletal abnormality , hear impairment , intellectual disability , muscle weakness ataxia . The progression neuromuscular skeletal deterioration insidious , occur several decade , render patient wheel-chair dependent . No consistently successful treatment available . To good characterize biochemical phenotype natural history disorder , study 15 patient AMD , range age five 60 year , recruit Departments Biochemical Genetics Medical Genetics university medical center mainly US Canada refer Intl Society Mannosidosis &amp; Related Diseases . Participants study visit NIH Clinical Center 2-3 day undergo clinical biochemical evaluation establish reliable clinical benchmark identify cerebrospinal fluid biomarkers could serve candidate surrogate marker treatment effect future clinical trial . The protocol take advantage NICHD Biomedical Mass Spectrometry Facility generate CSF proteomic profile . Patients also undergo MR spectroscopy ( sedation/anesthesia , appropriate ) order establish phenotypic baseline possible utility guide natural history and/or treatment outcomes future study . If pre-clinical component proposal prove promising , prospect recombinant adeno-associated viral gene therapy trial involve brain-directed ( intrathecal ) approach AMD would possible within 3 year .</detailed_description>
