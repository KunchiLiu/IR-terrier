	<brief_summary>We conduct 7 day cohort study consecutive patient age 16 year old undergoing inpatient noncardiac surgery . Patients follow maximum 30 day . We follow original European Surgical Outcomes Study ( EuSOS ) study design . The primary outcome in-hospital mortality . Secondary outcome include length stay admission intensive care . Centres across South Africa represent public service recruit patient . This study run 19 May 2014 26 May 2014 .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Methods -Seven day , South African national multi-centre cohort study adult ( â‰¥16 year ) patient undergo in-patient non-cardiac surgery . Centres -We aim recruit many South African centre possible . Every Medical University South Africa participate SASOS ( University Cape Town , University Free State , University KwaZulu Natal , University Limpopo , University Pretoria , University Stellenbosch , University Witwatersrand , Walter Sisulu University ) , hospital support serve participate study . Ethics approval - Ethics approval obtain university centre . - This study effect large scale clinical audit , waiver consent approve seven eight medical school ethic committee , similar international precedent already set , original EuSOS study , consent waive 27 28 European country participate . Only University Witwatersrand require patient consent SASOS . Data collection collation - Data collect individual centre paper case record form ( CRFs ) every patient recruit . Paper CRFs store within lock office centre include identifiable patient data order allow follow-up clinical outcome . Data pseudo-anonymised generation unique numeric code transcribe local investigator onto internet base electronic CRF . Each patient identify electronic CRF numeric code ; thus co-ordinating study team trace data back individual patient without contact local team . A participant ( patient ) list use centre match identifier code database individual patient order record clinical outcome supply miss data point . Access data entry system protect username password deliver registration process individual local investigator . All electronic data transfer participate centre co-ordinating centre encrypt use secure protocol ( HTTPS/SSL 3.0 better ) . - Each centre maintain secure trial file include protocol , local investigator delegation log , ethic approval documentation , participant list , etc . - A final summary printout include patient major variable produce centre together final data submission double check completeness accuracy . Dataset - A realistic data set fundamental success investigation , confirm EuSOS study nearly complete data available 46 000 patient . We therefore adopt EuSOS dataset minor change follow advice EuSOS steer committee , believe key data point discourage centre participate excessive burden data collection . The reliability data collection analyse formally use K-statistics intra-class correlation coefficient appropriate . - Centre co-ordinators may request addition limited number data point support national SASOS data collection subsequent regional analysis . All additional data point must discuss co-principal investigator necessary steer committee . - Centre specific data collect hospital include : secondary/tertiary centre , number operating room , number level critical care bed , detail reimbursement status hospital public holiday local factor affect patient throughput study period . - An operating room case record form ( CRF ) surgical ward CRF complete every eligible patient undergoes surgery seven day cohort period . Patients follow hospital discharge . This censored thirty day i.e . patient follow discharge thirty day whichever short period . If patient admit critical care time follow-up period , critical care CRF complete . The critical care CRF may therefore complete patient admit critical care seven day cohort period complete . Sample size calculation - We intend recruit many patient possible seven day period , order establish large , representative sample participate South African centre . Based audit data , believe possible sample size may close 7,500 patient . Assuming overall mortality rate follow surgery 4 % , sample size 7,500 patient yield 300 death . This allow inclusion least thirty variable logistic regression model mortality . - The rate admission critical care likely vary centre . Based anticipated 7,500 patient provide sample 300 admission critical care surgery , base assumption critical care admission South Africa half Europe ( 4 % versus 8 % respectively ) . We expect allow robust logistic regression model outcome . - This dataset sufficient generalisability inform practice peri-operative care national basis South Africa . Statistical analysis - The data collect collected part routine clinical care . Categorical variable describe proportion compare use chi-square test . Continuous variable describe mean standard deviation normally distributed median inter-quartile range normally distribute . Comparisons continuous variable group perform use t-tests , one-way ANOVA equivalent non parametric test appropriate . Univariate analysis perform test factor associate plan unplanned admission critical care / in-hospital death . - Generalized linear mixed model use logit link use identify independent risk prognostic factor binary outcome . These include one-level model hierarchical two-level model account expect correlation outcome within hospital . Data first analyse Province , Country level , use Province independent variable . A stepwise approach use enter new term regression model univariate p &lt; 0.05 set limit inclusion new term . Results report adjusted odds ratio ( OR ) 95 % confidence interval . A single final analysis plan end study . Primary outcome measure -In-hospital mortality Secondary outcome measure - Duration hospital stay - Admission critical care surgery - Duration critical care stay Organisation -The Steering Committee chair Bruce Biccard ( BB ) Thandinkosi Madiba ( TM ) . The study management team appoint Steering Committee lead BB TM . The duty team include administration project task , communication project partner ( include funders , steer committee member , national local co-ordinators , etc ) , data collation management preparation report individual study site . The Steering Committee responsible scientific conduct consistency project . The Steering Committee ensure communication funder ( ) , study management team co-ordinators necessary .</detailed_description>
