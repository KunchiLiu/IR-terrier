	<criteria>Participants must meet follow criterion screen examination eligible participate study : Participants must histologically confirm melanoma metastatic unresectable ; Participants must measurable disease , define least one lesion accurately measure least one dimension ( long diameter record ) ≥ 20 mm conventional technique ≥ 10 mm spiral CT scan . See section 10 evaluation measureable disease ; At least 4 week since prior treatment ( chemotherapy , radiation therapy , hormonal therapy ) ; Age ≥18 year ; Life expectancy great 12 week ; ECOG performance status 01 Recovered toxicity associate prior treatment , acceptable baseline status ( Lab toxicity see limit inclusion ) National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria Adverse Events ( NCI CTCAE ) version 4 , Grade 0 1 , except toxicity consider safety risk , alopecia vitiligo Participants must adequate bone marrow , hepatic , renal function determine within 14 day define : Platelet count ≥ 100,000/mm3 Absolute neutrophil count ≥1,000/mm3 Hemoglobin ≥ 9 g/dL Total bilirubin ≤ 1.5 x ULN ( upper limit normal ) except subject document Gilbert 's syndrome ( &gt; 5 x ULN ) liver metastasis , must baseline total bilirubin ≤ 3.0 mg/dL Aspartate transaminase ( AST ) alanine transaminase ( ALT ) ≤ 3 x ULN ( ≤5 x ULN document liver metastasis present ) Serum creatinine ≤ 2.0 mg/dL calculate creatinine clearance ≥ 50 mL/min determine CockcroftGault equation ; INR &lt; 1.1 X institutional upper limit normal Negative screen test result human immunodeficiency virus ( HIV ) , hepatitis B C. If positive result indicative true active chronic infection , subject enter study discussion Principal Investigator . Females childbearing potential sexually active nonsterilized male partner must use highly effective method contraception 28 day prior first dose investigational product , must agree continue use precaution 180 day final dose investigational product ; cessation contraception point discuss responsible physician . Periodic abstinence , rhythm method , withdrawal method acceptable method contraception . They must also refrain egg cell donation 180 day final dose investigational product . Females childbearing potential define surgically sterile ( ie , bilateral tubal ligation , bilateral oophorectomy , complete hysterectomy ) postmenopausal ( defined 12 month menses without alternative medical cause ) ; A highly effective method contraception define one result low failure rate ( ie , le 1 % per year ) use consistently correctly . Nonsterilized male sexually active female partner childbearing potential must use highly effective method contraception Days 1 90 post last dose . In addition , must refrain sperm donation 90 day final dose investigational product ; Highly Effective Methods Contraception Barrier Methods Male condom spermicide Copper T intrauterine device Levonorgesterelreleasing intrauterine system ( eg , Mirena® ) ( This also consider hormonal method ) Hormonal Methods Implants Hormone shot injection Combined pill Minipill Patch Participants exhibit follow condition screen eligible admission study . Participants chemotherapy radiotherapy within 4 week ( 6 week nitrosoureas mitomycin C ) prior enter study recover adverse event due agent administer 4 week earlier ; Received prior monoclonal antibody CTLA4 ; Any prior ≥ Grade 3 immunerelated adverse event ( irAE ) receive immunotherapy unresolved irAE time study entry Participants history hypersensitivity compound similar biologic composition tremelimumab constituent product ; The last dose prior systemic therapy ( e.g . chemotherapy , target therapy etc ) radiation therapy ( exception palliative radiotherapy ) receive less 14 day prior first day treatment ; Concurrent enrollment another clinical study receipt investigational product within last 4 week ( participation survival followup period study exclusion criterion ) ; Currently receive systemic corticosteroid immunosuppressive medication medical condition require chronic use corticosteroid . Note : inhaled topical steroid permit ; Subjects vaccinate live attenuate vaccine within one month prior start tremelimumab treatment ; Any condition , opinion investigator , would interfere evaluation investigational product interpretation subject safety study result ; Active , untreated central nervous system ( CNS ) metastasis ( subject brain metastasis identify screen may rescreened lesion [ ] appropriately treat subject corticosteroid ) ; Any serious uncontrolled medical disorder active infection would impair subject 's ability receive investigational product , condition associate frequent diarrhea ; History chronic inflammatory autoimmune disease ( eg , Addison 's disease , multiple sclerosis , Graves ' disease , Hashimoto 's thyroiditis , rheumatoid arthritis , hypophysitis , uveitis , etc ) symptomatic disease within last 3 year . Note : Active vitiligo alopecia history vitiligo alopecia basis exclusion ; Active history inflammatory bowel disease ( eg , colitis , Crohn 's ) , irritable bowel disease , celiac disease serious gastrointestinal chronic condition associate diarrhea . Active history systemic lupus erythematosis Wegener 's granulomatosis ; History sarcoidosis syndrome ; Active history diverticulitis . Note diverticulosis permit ; History malignancy unless subject diseasefree least 3 year . Noninvasive cancer history ( carcinoma situ [ CIS ] resect ) allow ; Unresolved toxicities prior anticancer therapy resolve CTCAE , version 4.0 , Grade ≤ 1 baseline , exception alopecia laboratory value list 3.1.8 ; Any condition would prohibit understanding render information consent compliance requirement protocol ; Prior treatment angiopoietin inhibitor , inhibitor Tie1 Tie2 include , limited , AMG386 , CVX060 , XL880 , XL820 ; Current necessity fulldose anticoagulation warfarin equivalent ( i.e . unfractionated and/or low molecular weight heparin ) ; Symptomatic peripheral vascular disease ; Known bleed diathesis coagulopathy ; Significant known vascular disease ( e.g aortic aneurysm , aortic dissection ) ; Pulmonary hemorrhage gross hemoptysis ( bright red blood ≥ ½ teaspoon per episode ) within 6 month prior enrollment ; Serious nonhealing wound , ulcer , bone fracture within 6 month prior enrollment ; Major surgical procedure significant traumatic injury within 28 day prior study enrollment ; Pregnant woman exclude study tremelimumab MEDI3617 monoclonal antibody potential teratogenic abortifacient effect . Because unknown potential risk adverse event nurse infant secondary treatment mother tremelimumab MEDI3617 , breastfeed discontinue mother treated tremelimumab MEDI3617 . These potential risk may also apply agent use study . Patients grade 2 high peripheral neuropathy exclude doseescalation phase protocol</criteria>
