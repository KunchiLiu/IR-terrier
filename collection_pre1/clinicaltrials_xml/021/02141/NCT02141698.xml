	<detailed_description>The drug test study call TAK-438 . TAK-438 test find safe well-tolerated dose . This study look pharmacodynamic pharmacokinetic property ( drug move throughout body ) drug safety ( lab result side effect ) people take TAK-438 . This study design consist 4 sequential substudies : single rise dose study ( Cohorts 1 7 ) , food-effect study ( Cohort 8 ) , multiple rise dose study ( Cohorts 9 11 ) , Japanese bridging study ( Cohort 12 ) . However , protocol halt food effect study ( Cohort 8 ) follow discovery previously unidentified metabolite result , multiple rise dose ( Cohorts 9-11 ) ethnicity ( Cohort 12 ) study carry . The study population Cohorts 1 7 consist 9 subject ; 6 subject randomize receive single dose TAK-438 , 3 subject receive placebo . Subjects Cohorts 1 7 receive single dose study drug 10-hour fast . The start dose 1 mg follow administration 5 , 10 , 20 , 15 , 40 , 30 mg . In Cohort 8 plan assign 12 participant 2-sequence , 2-period crossover design . Six participant receive single dose TAK-438 Day 1 , fast state , follow second single dose TAK-438 Day 15 alternative feed state . The 6 participant receive study drug like-wise fed fast state . To investigate effect multiple dosing , 3 cohort ( Cohorts 9-11 ) , comprise 12 participant introduce protocol follow completion single rise dose study . A final cohort , Cohort 12 , consist 24 Western participant 24 Japanese participant used assess effect TAK-438 esomeprazole safety , tolerability , pharmacokinetics pH stomach 2 ethnic group . This single-centre trial conduct United Kingdom .</detailed_description>
