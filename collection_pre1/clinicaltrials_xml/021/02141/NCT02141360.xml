	<brief_summary>This hypothesis-generating feasibility study conduct determine potential association broad range clinical neurological symptom MR image , data , clinical finding involve mild traumatic brain injury ( mTBI ) . These association examine acute sub-acute period ( approximately 3 month ) follow injury provide information useful optimization MR pulse sequence mTBI application . The intent study broadly generate range potential mTBI biomarkers detectable use investigational MR pulse sequence technology . Feasibility data attain study may use engineering program decision-making support future scientific assessment , engineering development , publish research databases registry mTBI data image , purpose determine Sponsor . The result study intend use regulatory submission . Subjects examine commercially available MR scanner use investigational standard care MR coil series investigational Application Packs contain predetermine set MR pulse sequence optimize GEHC .</brief_summary>
