	<brief_summary>Study Hypothesis : Acetyl-l-carnitine increase nerve regeneration patient severe carpal tunnel syndrome . Carpal tunnel syndrome ( CTS ) common , affect almost 3 % general population . In severe case , nerve regeneration functional recovery incomplete even surgery . The goal pilot project test potentially promising medication , acetyl-l-carnitine ( ALCAR ) . We use randomize , double blind , placebo control study design . Along surgery , treatment group also receive ALCAR half control group give placebo . To gauge effect ALCAR , compare motor sensory nerve growth well functional outcome . The data study provide crucial information design full scale clinical trial . If successful , represent important first step find novel treatment improve functional outcome patient severe CTS .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Trial Conduct : This study conduct compliance protocol approve University Alberta Health Research Ethics Board ( HREB ) Health Canada . The study carry accord Good Clinical Practice standard . No deviation protocol occur approve , unless protocol put patient risk . If deviation need occur , HREB Health Canada notify . Written amendment submit HREB Health Canada approval . Population Adult patient suffer severe CTS would population interest . Severity CTS define clinical symptom electromyography ( EMG ) result . These patient recruit baseline study , motor unit number estimation ( MUNE ) . Motor unit number estimation EMG technique quantifies amount motor unit muscle contains . In various form neuropathy , MUNE decrease . For study , patient include MUNE 2 standard deviation normal . These patient identify referral plastic surgery clinic EMG clinic management.Pre-study Screening Baseline Evaluation The subject complete physical exam include clinical lab ECG . Only normal laboratory ECG finding enrol study . Randomization Randomization - After enrollment , patient randomize placebo acetyl-l-carnitine . A statistician employ develop randomization sequence . Randomization keep computer password encryption . The randomization sequence broken adverse event occur patient . At end study statistician provide research team randomization sequence code . Blinding - The study administer double-blind manner . The randomization sequence keep confidential accessible authorize personnel . Pharmacy distribute identical pill label bottle A B . The research team unaware contain study drug placebo . This maintain final follow-up occur research team unblinded . Duration The duration study approximately 13 month patient . Screening baseline evaluation occur within 1 month preoperatively . The investigator review document screen laboratory test ECG result . Acetyl-l-carnitine regimen begin immediately follow surgery . This continue 2 month duration . The patient complete follow-up visit 1 , 2 , 3 , 6 , 12 month interval . At visit , safety monitoring include periodic blood chemistry , vital sign evaluation overall clinical condition ( detail show table ) . All clinically relevant change occur study examine document . In case laboratory abnormality detect , appropriate medical management advice provide .</detailed_description>
