	<brief_summary>Children cerebral palsy commonly use stand frame position help prevent contracture deformity help function . There lack evidence support correct dosage stand frame use . The aim study pilot randomise control trial clinical effect double duration standing , use stand frame , young child unable walk , cerebral palsy developmental delay . It determine whether feasable carry multi-centred trial . The study objectives determine : 1. presence adverse event 2. recruitment drop rate 3. compliance intervention 4. feasibility randomisation minimisation process 5. proportion outcome measure take 6. effect size estimate 7. require study cost 8. effectiveness blinding procedure</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Clinical Effectiveness Increased Standing Time Non-ambulant Children With Cerebral Palsy : Pilot Study</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Thirty non-ambulant child cerebral palsy randomise one two group either ( ) maintain child 's current standing frame program- control group ( n=15 ) ( b ) double stand time- intervention group ( n=15 ) . Outcome measure take baseline 6 monthly interval blind assessor . Research process flow Families willing participate study provide diary sheet allow record baseline 2 week period frequently child stood position . The diary sheet available word hard copy format . An e mail/ stamp address envelope provide return diary end 2 week . Participants remind via text/ phone / e mail ( depend prefer method communication ) 1 week return diary sheet . On receipt diary sheet participant randomize intervention control group ( see ) . A therapist explain group allocation family home local CDC . The trial run 12 month outcome measure take assessor blind group allocation . The primary outcome measure ( hip migration percentage ) take 0 12 month fit practice across South West increase x ray exposure . The secondary outcome measure take baseline , 6 12 month . The final RCT involve 3 yr follow-up phase . Sample Size We aim recruit 15 people per group . An audit CDC record suggest 5-6 eligible participant 12 month recruitment period . With 8 main recruitment centre would result 40-48 potential participant require recruitment rate 75-63 % . An on-going study look walk child old child CP Plymouth University suggest recruitment rate feasible . Determining actual recruitment rate particular patient population feasibility use multiple centre across one region one objective pilot study . Randomisation Thirty child Cerebral Palsy ( age 1-4 yr ; GMFCS IV-V ) recruit South West base service . Participants randomly allocate intervention control use web-based system . A minimisation algorithm use ensure balance group basis follow : - Age ( &lt; 2 yr Vs &gt; 2 yr ) - Functional ability ( GMFCS=IV Vs GMFCS =V ) - Baseline standing time ( &lt; 30 min Vs &gt; 30 min ) Intervention All participant already perform stand regime prescribe treat therapist . The study design group allocation explain research assistant ( RA1 ) either local CDC participant ' home . The control group continue usual standing-frame base regime . The intervention group double daily standing-frame time . In group guidance sheet provide progress standing time duration trial 10 % /month maximum 1 hr/day control group 2 hr/day intervention group . Following PPI advice guidance personalise include photo set child stand frame correct position supportive strap / correct posture adopt . The research assistant visit group start trial every 3 month . At visit ( ) check position child adopt stand frame ( b ) check footwear splint use fit ( c ) check progression treatment ( ) check record change additional care routine treat therapist . Feedback problem footwear / splinting pass onto child 's treating therapist . Outcome Measures The primary outcome measure take baseline ( 0 month ) 12 month . This fit routine practice cross centre South West although centre take additional x-ray 6 month . All measure take 0 , 6 12 month . Outcomes measure assessor blind group allocation .</detailed_description>
