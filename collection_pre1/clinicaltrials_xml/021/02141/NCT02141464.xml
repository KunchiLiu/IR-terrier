	<detailed_description>Cystic fibrosis ( CF ) genetic disease cause mutation gene encode CF transmembrane conductance regulator ( CFTR ) , chloride channel . Most CF mutation either reduce number CFTR channel cell surface ( synthesis processing mutation ) impair channel function ( gate conductance mutation ) . Ivacaftor ( Kalydeco , VX-770 ) novel , FDA approve new therapy address CFTR dysfunction subject CF `` gate mutation '' , specifically ; potentiate CFTR channel function . For mutation like G551D permit CFTR expression cell membrane compromise activity , Ivacaftor increase probability channel open active . In previous randomize , double-blind , placebo control trial , Ivacaftor treatment result clinically significantly improvement pulmonary function , weight body mass index ( BMI ) , significant decrease sweat chloride reflective increase CFTR activity . The improvement lung function weight occur first 8 week treatment , plateaued sustained 48 week trial . The mechanism rapid sustain weight gain know . Several mechanism consider proposal may result improved energy balance energy utilization , weight gain . These include decreased rest energy expenditure , increase energy fat absorption gut , improve pancreatic enzyme pH secretion , increase energy intake . Improvements weight BMI status expect result improvement energy balance utilization , potential beneficial effect muscle mass function quality life .</detailed_description>
