	<brief_title>Plasmablast Trafficking Antibody Response Influenza Vaccination ( SLVP021 ) - Year 1 , 2011</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The aim study compare cellular immune response different license influenza vaccine analyse vaccine-induced plasmablast , include expression traffic program function polyclonal antibody immunoglobulin gene repertoire derive cell . This work may help improve design new vaccine , influenza respiratory pathogen well . Young adult , 18-30 year age receive 2010-2011 seasonal influenza vaccine enrol . They randomly assign one three 2011-2012 license influenza vaccine [ Fluzone® 2011-2012 Formula ( IM ) , Fluzone® 2011-2012 Formula ( ID ) Flumist® 2011-2012 Formula give intranasally ] . Blood sample conduct assay take pre-immunization , Day 7-8 Day 28 post immunization . A small sub-set 7 young adult , 18-49 year age previously immunize 2010-2011 seasonal influenza vaccine assign receive Flumist® 2011-2012 Formula vaccine .
