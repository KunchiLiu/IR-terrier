	<brief_summary>In clinical practice , amoxicillin + clavulanic acid widely use treatment odontogenic infection . Therefore , study design generate data support use demonstrate efficacy , safety tolerability comparison clindamycin subject acute odontogenic infection without abscess . This two-arm , parallel , comparative , observer blind , randomise study ass efficacy , safety tolerability amoxicillin + clavulanic acid ( 875mg/125mg ) comparison clindamycin ( 150mg ) administer 5-7 day subject acute odontogenic infection without abscess . The study perform adult subject male female ≥18 year age present acute odontogenic infection . A total 472 subject randomize 1:1 ratio , i.e . 236 subject treatment arm . The treatment duration study least 5 day maximum 7 day depend upon treatment response . Subjects assess Day 5 Investigator feel need continue treatment Day 5 treatment continue till Day 7 . For subject show treatment response Day 5 , assessment perform Day 7 .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>This two-arm , parallel , comparative , observer blind , randomise study perform adult subject male female ≥18 year age present acute odontogenic infection without abscess . A total 472 subject randomise 1:1 ratio get 205 evaluable subject study arm . After obtain informed consent , subject undergo surgical intervention include surgical incision , drainage , removal involve tooth , debridement , puncture lavage trephination , deem necessary Investigator . These surgical intervention perform start study treatment . On Day 0 confirm eligibility , subject randomise either study arm . The treatment duration study least 5 day may increase 7 day , Investigator feel need continue treatment Day 5 . In case clinical assessment do Day 7 . Thus efficacy evaluation perform baseline ( Day 0 ) prior study drug administration Day 5 and/ 7 . Safety laboratory evaluation perform Screening Visit repeat end study treatment i.e . either Day 5 Day 7 . On Baseline , Day 2 , Day 5 and/ Day 7 , Visual Analogue Scale ( VAS ) use measure amount pain swell subject experience . This scale numerical rating 0 10 . Zero would mean `` No pain '' 10 would mean `` Worst possible pain '' . The subject ask choose appropriate score VAS best describe his/her pain status last 24 hour . While use VAS swelling , zero would mean `` No swell '' 10 would mean `` Maximum possible swelling '' . The Investigator choose appropriate score VAS best describes subject 's swelling . Sample microbiological culture obtain discretion Investigator perform surgical procedure . When microbiological culture indicate feasible , two set ( consist aerobic anaerobic medium ) obtain . This sample do approximately 80 subject randomly provide consent Screening . The sample collect dispatched appropriate transport medium central laboratory culture antibiotic susceptibility . Protocol waiver exemption allow . The total duration subject 's participation 6-9 day include Screening period 0-1 day ( Day -1 Day 0 ) Treatment period 5-7 day ( Day 0 Day 5-7 ) . The primary objective study compare clinical efficacy ( cure improvement ) treatment arm use VAS assessment pain swell . Since clinical efficacy parameter subjective , mandatory keep observer/Investigator blind study assessment . In addition , design blind study challenge owe different dosage regimen formulation study drug . The study design double blind double dummy recommend view increase pill burden turn impact treatment compliance . The possibility over-encapsulation rule due large pill size amoxicillin + clavulanic acid . Therefore maintain blinding Investigators , study design observer blind Investigator remain blind throughout study period . An unblinded study team member appoint site involve dispense study drug subject . The unblinded study team member remain present subject assessment study visit ensure Investigator remain blinded treatment assignment . Study treatment include amoxicillin + clavulanic acid ( 875mg/125mg ) two time daily clindamycin ( 150mg ) four time daily 5-7 day administer orally meal . Augmentin™ ( amoxicillin + clavulanic acid ) GSK Dalacin-C ( clindamycin ) Pfizer use study treatment . The content label accordance applicable regulatory requirement . Patients receive additional medical therapy analgesic anti-inflammatory drug . However , opioid analgesic antibiotic apart study drug permit entire study period . This study conduct accordance ICH GCP , applicable subject privacy requirement , ethical principle outline Declaration Helsinki 2008 , include IRB/ IEC review approval study protocol subsequent amendment , subject inform consent Investigator reporting requirement .</detailed_description>
