	<brief_title>Computerized Exercise Training Cognitive Remediation Adults With Multiple Sclerosis Treated With Gilenya</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Gilenya represent recent advance MS disease-modification therapy ( DMT ) show promise neuroprotection , feature relevant progressive neurologic damage associate disease . Cognitive impairment accompanies MS 40-60 % case present , additional symptomatic treatment combine DMT require . To date symptomatic pharmacologic therapy show consistent benefit MS associate cognitive dysfunction . However , non-pharmacologic approach show promise . With recent technical scientific advance , cognitive training rapidly evolve become effective intervention cognitive impairment associate wide range neurological condition . However , train program yet study MS . This study randomize open-label clinical pilot trial compare plasticity-based adaptive cognitive remediation ( PACR ) program active control ( ordinary computer game ) 20 adult multiple sclerosis ( MS ) start Gilenya therapy . Primary outcome measure use preliminary indicator effect , improvement program task-related measure change cognitive measure . Secondary outcome measure determine feasibility use program patient MS , indicate compliance patient-reported experience .</detailed_description>
