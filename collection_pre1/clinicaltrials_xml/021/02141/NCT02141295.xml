	<brief_summary>This Phase 2 multicenter , randomize , parallel arm , double-blind study vanucizumab evaluate efficacy safety vanucizumab combination oxaliplatin , folinic acid , 5-fluorouracil ( 5-FU ) ( mFOLFOX-6 ) versus bevacizumab ( Avastin ) + mFOLFOX-6 participant previously untreated metastatic colorectal cancer ( mCRC ) . The study consist 2 part : safety run-in open-label , single-arm part ( Part 1 ) randomize , parallel-arms , double-blind part ( Part 2 ) . During Part 1 least 6 eligible participant receive 2000 milligram ( mg ) vanucizumab every 2 week + mFOLFOX-6 order confirm dose schedule use Part 2 . In Part 2 , eligible participant randomize ratio 1:1 receive either mFOLFOX-6 + vanucizumab mFOLFOX-6 + bevacizumab . Study treatment ( induction maintenance ) give Day 1 14-day cycle . Induction therapy consist 8 cycle mFOLFOX-6 plus either bevacizumab vanucizumab . Maintenance therapy consist 5-fluorouracil folinic acid plus either vanucizumab bevacizumab 24 month disease progression , unacceptable toxicity , Investigator decision consent withdrawal , whichever occur first .</brief_summary>
