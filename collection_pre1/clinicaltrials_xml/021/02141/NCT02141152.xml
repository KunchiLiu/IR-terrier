	<brief_summary>The next generation personalize medical treatment accord type personal genetic information evolve rapidly . The genome analysis need systematic infra database base personal genetic information Therefore , big data genome-clinical information important . To determine feasibility use tumor 's molecular profiling targeted therapy treatment advance cancer determine clinical outcome ( PFS , duration response overall survival ) patient advanced cancer , investigator go take fresh tissue patient process molecular profile receive molecular profile direct treatment .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Next pErsonalized Cancer tX With mulTi-omics Preclinical Model</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This study nickname NEXT-1 trial ( Next pErsonalized cancer tX mulTi ) . A single-center , open label trial analysis genetic information advance cancer . If target confirm molecular profile , subgroup go Umbrella trial type . define : NEXT 1 trial screen feasibility - &gt; NEXT trial BASKET/umbrella study screen protocol ( Molecular screening prolongs survival ) - &gt; NEXT-1.1 ( gastric cancer ) , NEXT-1.2 ( colorectal cancer ) , NEXT-1.3 ( biliary tract cancer/pancreatic cancer ) , NEXT-1.4 ( Rare cancer ) , NEXT-1.5 ( genitourinary cancer )</detailed_description>
