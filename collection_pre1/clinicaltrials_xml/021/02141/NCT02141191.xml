	<brief_title>A Study Lung Clearance After Hypertonic Saline Delivery Using tPAD Device</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Cystic Fibrosis ( CF ) lung disease cause dehydration airway secretion lead mucus adhesion , infection airway inflammation . A simple mean restore hydration CF airway surface inhale hypertonic ( 3-7 % NaCl ) saline , osmotically draws water onto airway surface . Rehydration lubricant layer airway surface liquid facilitates mucociliary clearance ( MCC ) therefore removal inhale infectious agent . Recent study describe ( 1 ) short term ( two week ) beneficial effect inhale hypertonic saline ( HS ) four time daily pulmonary function , MCC , quality life ( 2 ) long term ( one year ) benefit inhale HS twice daily lung function pulmonary exacerbation frequency . Consequently , inhale HS use ~55 % patient CF nationwide . Due large number medication CF patient use daily basis conjunction airway clearance technique , high treatment burden result decrease quality life . Both Cystic Fibrosis Foundation lead CF clinician support idea use hypertonic saline standard care . The investigator believe use specialize transnasal Pulmonary Aerosol Delivery ( tPAD ) device administration HS improve standard care reduce treatment burden CF patient ' waking hour , ensure great compliance potentially improve efficacy tolerability inhale HS . A previous deposition study tPAD , six healthy adult subject , demonstrate ~38 % 7 % HS aerosol emit nasal cannula deposit adult lung , acute safety tolerability issue ( Parion Sciences Protocol PS-D100-102 ; Scott Donaldson , PI ) . This deposition efficiency match Pari LC Star use via oral route , use standard practice comparator . However , 7 % HS nebulization tPAD result peripheral deposition aerosol Pari LC Star comparator . Previously , show administration 5 mL 7 % HS QID Pari LC Star lead significant improvement lung function CF patient . The investigator estimate dose regimen deposit ~400 mg NaCl per day require four ~18 minute administration ( deposition rate = 5.8 mg/min ) . Although HS generally well tolerate CF population , intolerance occur largely related rate NaCl delivery oropharynx airway surface . As nebulizer device capable administer aerosol nasal cannula currently available , Parion Sciences design customized nebulizer spacer entrain aerosol approve marketed Aerogen Aeroneb Pro vibrate mesh nebulizer nasal cannula without significant `` rain '' drip cannula . The tPAD system utilized output rate ~50 ul/min , emit ~3.5 mg/min NaCl deposit ~1.3 mg/min lung ( 38 % deposition efficiency ) . If use overnight 8 hour , investigator estimate 640 mg NaCl deposit lung . Therefore , investigator project novel administration system capacity deliver approximately 50 % great mass NaCl lung use overnight , compare 4 time day treatment standard oral nebulizer , thereby potentially increase efficacy . However , lung deposition rate le 25 % standard oral nebulizer , investigator anticipate tPAD also well tolerate eliminate need daytime HS treatment . In study , investigator explore safety , tolerability effect mucociliary absorptive clearance rate 7 % HS solution administer continuously overnight via transnasal route . The tPAD non-significant risk device compose 510K approve Aerogen Aeroneb Pro vibrate mesh nebulizer custom nebulization chamber allow connection standard nasal cannula .
