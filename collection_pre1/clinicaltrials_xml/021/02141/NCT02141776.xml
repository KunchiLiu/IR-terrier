	<brief_summary>Major depressive disorder ( MDD ) significant public health problem . Existing treatment modality always sufficient alleviate disorder . Treatment refractoriness common clinical problem . Transcranial direct current stimulation ( t-DCS ) , non-invasive brain stimulation technique , show effective alleviate depressive symptom preliminary study . There need explore role t-DCS Treatment-resistant depression ( TRD ) . Therefore , investigator aim undertake exploratory study . Aim : Compare role leave prefrontal cortex anodal t-DCS daily stimulation 4 week ( 20 week day ) sham stimulation alleviate depressive symptom patient TRD . Methodology : Patients seek treatment treatment resistant depression clinic fail respond treatment two antidepressant medication offer enroll study . The aim study 20 patient meet Diagnostic Statistical Manual Mental Disorders , 4th Edition ( DSM-IV ) criterion MDD age 21-65 year . Those subject receive sham stimulation offer active t-DCS stimulation additional 3 week get benefit may otherwise missed sham stimulation group . Results Conclusions : The investigator compare mean baseline end treatment Montgomery Asberg depression rating scale two group . The investigator compare change mean depression score baseline end treatment receive active t-DCS total 7 week duration . This study innovative significance explore role novel , easy administer , safe cost effective treatment modality .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Research Plan : 1 . Patients score &gt; 10 intake screening questionnaire , patient Health Questionnaire ( PHQ-9 ) advise call seek participation study . 2 . Patients seek treatment treatment resistant depression clinic offer enroll study . 3 . Patients fail respond least two antidepressant adequate dosage least 4 week . 4 . The aim 20 patient complete study enrol 24 patient screen another 26 patient meet diagnostic statistical manual , DSM-IV criterion Major depressive disorder , MDD fail treatment least two antidepressant medication . 5 . Patients interview investigator see meet eligibility inclusion study . The evaluation consist medical psychiatric evaluation do last one year monthly urine pregnancy test woman child bear potential . If subject meet eligibility criterion continue receive routine clinical care referral appropriate psychiatric care within outside clinic/department 6 . Stimulation parameter : Left prefrontal anodal t-DCS stimulation daily four week . The stimulation parameter : current 2 mA continuously 30 minute . Conductive electrode cover sponge soak saline use . The current gradually increase 2mA 30 second avoid sensation flash . 7 . Patients allot receive either active sham stimulation use random number assignment ( www.randomizer.org ) . Co-investigator Dr. Holbert assessment rating depressive symptom keep blind type stimulation receive . The machine use give active sham stimulation . 8 . At end four week subject offer stay open label extension study active leave prefrontal anodal t-DCS another three week receive benefit may otherwise receive sham stimulation . 9 . Materials : Montgomery Asberg depression rating scale , MADRS , Patient Health Questionnaire , PHQ-9 , Clinical Global Impression ( CGI ) baseline weekly . Improvement consider 50 % reduction depressive score remission score less 9 MADRS . MADRS 10 item examiner rat scale rate various depressive sign symptom use extensively research brain stimulation techniques.PHQ-9 9 item self-rated questionnaire depressive symptom find reliable study depression primary care psychiatric setting . CGI clinician rat impression treatment response . Procedure outline : Baseline : diagnostic interview , evaluation inclusion exclusion criterion , urine pregnancy test indicate baseline day 31 , fill questionnaire : PHQ-9 , MADRS , CGI Daily : t-DCS stimulation 30 minute ; patient ask discomfort/side effect . Days : 7,14,21,28,35,42,49 : PHQ-9 , MADRS , CGI Specifically , investigator compare baseline post treatment depression score via two-sample t-test , compare active treatment sham use two-sided P-value &lt; 0.05 declare significance . The change MADRS score ( MADRS ) primary outcome variable . Secondary variable analyze similarly pilot study . Significant finding secondary variable consider definitive .</detailed_description>
