	<brief_title>A Pilot Study `` OncozeneTM '' Microspheres Intra-arterial Delivery Doxorubicin</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The study evaluate safety tolerability doxorubicin load ONCOZENE microspheres chemoemobilization treatment unresectable hepatocellular carcinoma . The study also describe overall response rate lesion Oncozene-DEB-TACE ( Trans-arterial chemoemobilization ) per modify RECIST criterion ( Response Evaluation Criteria Solid Tumors ) . Determine progression free survival ( PFS ) overall survival ( OS ) follow Oncozene-DEB-TACE ( Trans-arterial chemoemobilization )</detailed_description>

Tumor suitable resection time study entry . ( Transplant eligible patient allow ) Age ≥ 18 year . Performance status ECOG PS 01 ( Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group Performance Status ) . Child Pugh Score A Adequate organ marrow function define : leukocyte ≥ 3,000/mcL ( Measurement Calibration Lab ) absolute neutrophil count ≥ 1,500/mcL platelet ≥ 75,000/mcl total bilirubin ≤ 3.0 AST ( Aspartate Aminotransferase ) ( SGOT ) /ALT ( Alanine Aminotransferase ) ( SPGT ) ≤ 5 X institutional upper limit normal creatinine ≤ 2.0 INR ( International Normalized Ratio ) ≤ 1.8 Albumin ≥ 2.8 Women childbearing potential men must agree use adequate contraception ( hormonal barrier method birth control ; abstinence ) prior study entry , duration study participation , 90 day follow completion therapy . Should woman become pregnant suspect pregnant participating study , inform treat physician immediately . A female childbearing potential woman ( regardless sexual orientation , undergone tubal ligation , remain celibate choice ) meet follow criterion : Has undergone hysterectomy bilateral oophorectomy Has naturally postmenopausal least 12 consecutive month ( i.e. , menses time precede 12 consecutive month ) .

Chemotherapy radiotherapy within 4 week prior enter study residual treatment relate toxicity great grade 1 addressed inclusion criterion . Any concurrent therapy HCC include concurrent investigational agent . Subjects know brain metastasis exclude clinical trial poor prognosis often develop progressive neurologic dysfunction would confound evaluation neurologic adverse event . History allergic reaction attribute compound similar chemical biologic composition doxorubicin agent use study . Uncontrolled intercurrent illness include , limited , ongoing active infection , symptomatic congestive heart failure , unstable angina pectoris , cardiac arrhythmia , psychiatric illness/social situation would limit compliance study requirement . Subjects must pregnant nursing due potential congenital abnormality potential regimen harm nursing infant .
