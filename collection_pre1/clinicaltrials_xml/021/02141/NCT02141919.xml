	<brief_title>Stereotactic Ablative Body Radiation Therapy Patients With Primary Renal Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Current treatment option primary renal cancer include surgery ablative techniques—all invasive minimally invasive option . The completely noninvasive treatment option stereotactic radiation therapy ( SABR ) , become standard care many cancer site , explore primary renal cancer . With multiple technological advance , feasible safely treat move intra-abdominal tumor kidney . This propose clinical trial evaluate efficacy SABR treating patient early renal cancer . Growing renal mass first biopsied confirm diagnosis renal cancer . Patients undergo treatment SABR 3-5 fraction complete within three week . Treatment response evaluate use sequential MRI scan second tumor biopsy one year treatment . Monitoring treatment toxicity kidney function also perform .</detailed_description>
