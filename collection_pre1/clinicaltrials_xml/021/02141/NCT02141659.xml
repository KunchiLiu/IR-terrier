Patients whose write consent ( signature print name personal seal inform consent form ) obtain study procedure perform . 3 . Japanese male patient 20 year age time informed consent . 4 . Patients , female partner could become pregnant , agree practice appropriate mean contraception time inform consent throughout entire study treatment period 4 month last dose study drug . 5 . Patients stable medical condition , include absence acute exacerbation chronic illness , serious infection , major surgery within 4 week ( 28 day ) prior study treatment initiation . 6 . Patients histologically cytologically confirm prostate cancer . 7 . Patients whose clinical diagnosis T14 N0 M0 , Tx N0 M0 patient undergone radical prostatectomy . 8 . Patients consider eligible hormone therapy prostate cancer . 9 . Patients receive hormone therapy ( e.g. , GnRH agonist , GnRH antagonist , steroidal antiandrogen , nonsteroidal androgen ) prostate cancer . 10 . Patients undergone surgical castration . 11 . Patients serum testosterone screen &gt; 150 ng/dL . 12 . Patients meet either follow criterion PSA screening . Untreated prostate cancer : PSA screen &gt; 4.0 ng/mL Treated* prostate cancer : PSA screen &gt; 0.2 ng/mL * : Patients undergone prostatectomy either high intensity focus ultrasound therapy radiotherapy ( exclude 125Ibrachytherapy ) prior start study . 13 . Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group ( ECOG ) Performance Status [ 17 ] 0 1 ( Appendix G ) 14 . Body mass index ( BMI* ) screen ≥ 18.0 kg/m2 1 . Patients exhibit symptom judge related prostate cancer investigator ( e.g. , bone pain , pelvic pain , ureteral obstruction ) urgently require hormone therapy GnRH agonist , GnRH antagonist , CAB/MAB therapy , chemotherapy , radiotherapy . 2 . Patients receive 5alpha reductase inhibitor ( except patient treated malepattern alopecia ) . 3 . Patients receive chemotherapy prostate cancer ( include estramustine ) . 4 .

Patients underwent prostatectomy within 16 week ( 112 day study treatment initiation . 7 . Treatment investigational compound within 4 week ( 28 day ) prior first dose study drug ongoing participation another experimental trial relate treatment prostate cancer . 8 . Diagnosis treatment another systemic malignancy within 2 year study treatment initiation , receive diagnosis another malignancy evidence residual disease . Patients nonmelanoma skin cancer carncinoma situ undergone complete resection exclude study . 9 . Patients take drug moderate strong CYP3A4 inhibitory induce effect , medication , supplement , food product Pgp inhibitory effect , 2 week ( 14 day ) prior study treatment initiation . 10 . Patients receive TAK385 past clinical study . 11 . Patients would difficult collect blood peripheral vein . 12 . Patients uncontrolled clinically significant nervous , circulatory , pulmonary , hepatic , renal , metabolic , gastrointestinal , urogenital , endocrine disorder , abnormality ( except target disease ) could affect study participation study result . Also , patient meet criterion c . A ) Patients uncontrolled diabetes ( HbA1C &gt; 8 % screening ) . However , patient whose HbA1c bring control diabetes medication may rescreened . B ) Patients uncontrolled hypertension ( systolic blood pressure &gt; 150 mmHg diastolic blood pressure &gt; 90 mmHg 2 separate measurement take 60 minute apart screen ) . Patients whose blood pressure bring control antihypertensive medication may rescreened . C ) Patients myocardial infarction , unstable symptomatic ischemic heart disease , arrhythmias CTCAE Grade &gt; 2 , thromboembolism ( deep vein thrombosis , pulmonary embolism , symptomatic cerebrovascular event ) , heart disease ( e.g. , pericardial effusion , restrictive cardiomyopathy ) . However , chronic stable atrial fibrillation control stable anticoagulant therapy allow . 13 . Patients bilateral hydronephrosis bladder neck outlet obstruction . 14 . Known hypersensitivity TAK385 , TAK385 excipients , GnRH antagonists . 15 . Patients past history gastrointestinal tract treatment ( include gastrectomy ) gastrointestinal disease could affect drug absorption tolerability ( malabsorption , esophageal reflux , peptic ulcer , erosive esophagitis ) . 16 . Patients positive hepatitis B surface antigen ( HBsAg ) , hepatitis C antibody ( HCV ) , human immunodeficiency virus ( HIV ) antibody , serologic test syphilis , lifethreatening disease cancer , screen . 17 . Clinically relevant ECG abnormality , follow ECG abnormality , screen . Qwave infarction , unless identify 6 month prior TAK385 treatment initiation QTcF interval &gt; 450 msec ( calculate QTc interval , Fridericia 's equation [ QT/RR0.33 ] use ) 18 . Patients congenital QT prolongation . 19 . Current use Class 1A Class 3 antiarrhythmic medication . 20 . New York Heart Association Class III IV heart failure . 21 . Patients clinical laboratory abnormality suggest clinically relevant underlying disease , follow abnormal result , screen .
