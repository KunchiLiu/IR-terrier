	<brief_summary>This study evaluate total blood flow retina choroid ( structure back eye ) Doppler optical coherence tomography ( OCT ) OCT angiography . Angiography map blood vessel . The purpose measure blood flow retina choroid 1 . ) determine rare diseases structure cause change blood flow compare healthy eye 2 . ) find area change blood flow line area damage appear conventional testing .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Optical coherence tomography ( OCT ) image technology perform non-contact cross-sectional image retinal choroidal tissue structure real time measure intensity reflect light . Tomographic image generate scan optical probe beam across tissue structure interest . OCT become one widely use imaging technology ophthalmologists . Its advantage include non-contact imaging modality , micron-level resolution , produce digital image view electronically , provide reproducible quantitative measurement . New functional OCT include Doppler OCT OCT angiography may allow assessment retinal blood flow away need invasive fluorescein angiography ( FA ) test . Thus , diagnostic data provide functional OCT least equivalent superior achieve FA , patient healthcare provider could realize substantial benefit utilize technology evaluation retinal vascular disease . Even scenario FA usually clinically indicate , OCT angiography may provide information standard OCT clinical examination history , might help clinicians good understand etiology disease , may even help inform treatment response .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>SubjectLevel Criteria : Inclusion . Diagnosis retinal choroidal disease Exclusion 1 . Inability give inform consent . 2 . Inability complete study test within 30 day period 3 . Significant renal disease , define history chornic renal failure require dialysis kidney transplant . 4 . A condition , opinion investigator , would preclude participation study ( e.g . unstable medical status include blood pressure , cardiovascular disease , glycemic control ) . 5 . Blood pressure &gt; 180/110 ( systolic 180 OR diastolic 110 ) . If blood pressure bring 180/110 antihypertensive treatment , subject become eligible . 6 . Women childbearing potential : pregnant lactate intend become pregnant within next 12 month due unknown safety fluorescein angiography . StudyEye Criteria : Inclusion . Diagnosis retinal choroidal disease Exclusion 1 . Inability maintain stable fixation OCT imaging . 2 . An ocular condition present , opinion investigator , might affect alter visual acuity course study ( i.e . cataract ) 3 . Substantial cataract , opinion investigator , likely decrease visual acuity 3 line ( i.e . cataract would reduce acuity 20/40 bad eye otherwise normal ) . 4 . Media opacity otherwise would prevent either fixation ability obtain adequate image determine examiner .</criteria>
