	<detailed_description>1 . Introduction &amp; rationale Community acquire pneumonia ( CAP ) important health problem significant morbidity , mortality cost . It one main cause disease death worldwide cause deaths infection United States . Streptococcus pneumoniae commonly identify pathogen CAP . ( 1 ) S. pneumoniae gram-positive , alpha haemolytic bacterium surround external polysaccharide capsule . There difference composition capsule 92 different serotypes S. pneumoniae . Each serotype differs virulence prevalence . The external polysaccharide capsule main trigger specific antibody response basis pneumococcal vaccine . As impossible develop vaccine protect child , immune compromise adult old adult serotypes , vaccine base common virulent serotypes . Nowadays 13-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine , Prevnar 13 ( PCV13 ) , use widely vaccinate child . This vaccine contain seven serotypes present PCV7 ( 4 , 6B , 9V , 14 , 18C , 19F 23F ) plus emerge serotypes 1 , 3 , 5 , 6A , 7F 19A . ( 2 ) In Netherlands however 10-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine , Synflorix ( PCV10 ) , still use vaccinate child national infant vaccination . ( 3 ) Van Mens et al investigate contribution S. pneumoniae CAP measure serologic response patient hospitalize due CAP Ovidius Triple P study , two consecutive clinical trial initiate St Antonius Hospital Nieuwegein . This analysis show much high proportion patient pneumococcal pneumonia diagnose conventional method alone ( i.e . blood culture , sputum culture urine antigen test ) . Interestingly patient culture proven pneumococcal pneumonia show serotype specific antibody response infect serotype . ( 4 ) Possibly patient temporarily low titre due infection another explanation might structurally impair immune response S. pneumoniae certain serotypes . Borrow et al vaccinate 107 child PCV7 invasive pneumococcal disease ( IPD ) follow routine infant immunization schedule . Pneumococcal serotype specific antibody measurement perform showed failure respond infect serotype 8 child , even though child receive 2 dos PCV . Two child fail respond serotype different infect serotype . ( 5 ) In study humoral cellular immune response vaccination Prevnar 13 measure patient CAP S. pneumoniae . The patient recruit Ovidius Triple-P study , two consecutive clinical trial initiate St. Antonius Hospital Nieuwegein . ( 6,7 ) Patients survive pneumococcal pneumonia consider high-risk population pneumococcal disease future . ( 8 ) Possibly patient less response pneumococcal vaccination impair immune response S. pneumoniae . Special interest go vaccination response subgroup pneumococcal pneumonia patient without culture match specific antibody response order investigate reflect failure elicit immune response pneumonia find Van Mens et al . 2 . Objectives Primary Objective : • To investigate antibody response pneumococcal vaccination patient community acquire pneumococcal pneumonia compare pneumonia patient another pathogen . Secondary Objective ( ) : - To investigate antibody response pneumococcal vaccination patient community acquire pneumococcal pneumonia fail elicit specific antibody response . - To investigate cellular immune response pneumococcal vaccination patient community acquire pneumococcal pneumonia past compare pneumonia patient another pathogen . - To investigate quality life RAND-36 score patient community acquire pneumococcal pneumonia compare pneumonia patient another pathogen . - To investigate long-term mortality community acquire pneumococcal pneumonia . 3 . Study design The design prospective cohort study response pneumococcal vaccination immune function CAP S. pneumoniae investigate . Patients include Ovidius Triple-P study diagnose pneumococcal pneumonia ( culture , urine antigen test serology ) include . The control group consist patient include Ovidius Triple-P study diagnose community acquire pneumonia another pathogen . 4 . Working plan All patient control receive vaccination Prevnar 13 . During visit information medical history , medication usage daily status obtain . Patients also ask fill-in quality life questionnaire ( RAND-36 ; section F Questionnaires ) . Sera obtain vaccination three - four week vaccination determine antibody response different serotypes S. pneumoniae . The study end last visit last patient ; duration study approximately 2 month ( dependent moment inclusion patient ) .</detailed_description>
