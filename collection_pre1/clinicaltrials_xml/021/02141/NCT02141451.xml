	<brief_summary>This single institution phase I/II study use ADAM17 inhibitor ( INCB7839 ) rituximab consolidation therapy autologous hematopoietic cell transplant ( HCT ) patient diffuse large B cell lymphoma ( DLBCL ) . The study consist two phase . The dose finding phase modify version phase I trial extend phase modify version phase II trial .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>ADAM17 Inhibitor/ Rituximab After Auto HCT DLBCL</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The primary goal dose find phase determine maximum tolerate dose ( MTD ) INCB7839 . Up three dose level test ( 100 mg bid , 200 mg bid , 300 mg bid ) . As 300 mg bid proven safe non-transplant setting , dose escalation follow Fast-Track Design 1 patient enrol per dose level unless grade 2 great treatment emergent event occur within 1st 14 day INCB7839 . At point , dose escalation convert standard 3+3 design two additional patient enrol current dose level . If dose level 3 complete without dose limit toxicity ( DLT ) 1st 3 patient , additional 3 patient enrol level ( without stagger require DLT rule ) prior move phase II component . Once phase I dose escalation complete , additional 12 patient enrol MTD ( dose level 3 , DLT ) obtain detailed toxicity profile well preliminary estimate progression free survival 6 month post-transplant .</detailed_description>
