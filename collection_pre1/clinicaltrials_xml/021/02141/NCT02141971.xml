	<brief_summary>Non-randomized natural history study involve 12 subject Down Syndrome , age 30-60 year old . This study observe 3 different group : four non-demented subject age 30-40 year old , four non-demented subject age 40-50 year old , four demented subject 50-60 year old . Currently available longitudinal data DS suggest high rate transition dementia late 40 early 50 individual . This , together universal presence plaque DS mid 40 make age range ideal study development AD .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The overall goal project determine relationship among clinical , cognitive , image , genetic biochemical biomarker characteristic entire spectrum Alzheimer 's disease ( AD ) , pathology evolves normal age mild symptom , mild cognitive impairment ( MCI ) , dementia adult Down syndrome . This pilot study model Alzheimer 's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative ( ADNI ) inform neuroscience community AD DS , identify diagnostic prognostic marker , identify outcome measure use clinical trial , help develop effective clinical trial scenario . AD common dementia human next decade account major increase morbidity mortality US worldwide . AD usually sporadic disease commonly accept hypothesis etiology amyloid cascade hypothesis . There tremendous activity pharmaceutical industry academia direct towards development disease modify treatment , commonly target amyloid , also tau mechanism . Most effort direct towards Mild Moderate AD prodromal AD relatively little work prevention AD due various challenge , include identification healthy people would treat . Down syndrome common chromosomal disorder human , cause triplication chromosome 21 , account ~1/740 live birth USA even routine prenatal screening . In addition mental retardation classical sign DS , 100 % people DS develop pathological hallmark AD ( plaque tangle ) 40 ~80 % people DS eventually develop clinical dementia . The primary cause triplication APP gene chromosome 21 , result 50 % great level APP mRNA protein . That disease DS indeed AD support pathological , molecular , in-vitro , biomarker clinical evidence . People DS follow major center US EU decade large amount clinical psychometric data gather analyzed . There , however , little data CSF biomarkers due difficulty perform lumbar puncture DS subject . Only recently data begin gather image modality , include Amyloid imaging . There gold standard diagnosis AD population , due MR , standard instrument use . Most major center develop specific instrument follow cognitive functional performance allow detection dementia . The data gather past decade allow construction curve describe transition dementia population show transition begin mid 40 steep slope around age 50 . DS , effect , population highly enriched people , high probability develop AD , expect ADNI-like study investigator well understand trajectory transition dementia population . The ultimate goal project develop treatment prevention AD population . Because investigator would know age slope transition dementia steepest , study could do specific age range require much few subject time expense study general population ( currently impossible determine healthy individual likely develop dementia next year even , thousand would screen ID ) . A study general population might need enroll ten thousand subject observe sufficient transition dementia . The investigator estimate study DS would require 170 subject per arm 36 month study . Success study would provide confidence commit resource large study general population . As mentioned , minimal CSF data image beginning . Thus biomarkers AD DS less developed general population . Additional biomarkers could helpful study AD DS . A biomarker could increase ability predict transition dementia individual ( opposed investigator current ability population level ) would increase efficiency study . The ability track progression improvement dementia might also useful . If biomarker indicate transition dementia earlier clinical instrument , prevention study could conceivably conduct young age great chance success . In addition DS , biomarker would also useful general population . This study pilot study large scale biomarker study , describe , would enable good understand biomarkers natural history AD DS .</detailed_description>
