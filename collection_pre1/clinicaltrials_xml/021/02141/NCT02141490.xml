	<brief_summary>Background : People prostate , bladder , kidney cancer often cancer spread ( metastasize ) lymph node . It important doctor know occur currently hard determine occur standard imaging study like CT MRI . This study use agent call Ferumoxytol identify lymph node might involve cancer . Objective : - To see well Ferumoxytol detect lymph node metastases patient prostate , bladder , kidney cancer . Eligibility : -Adults age 18 prostate , bladder , kidney cancer lymph node involvement . Design : - Participants screen medical history . - Participants blood draw physical exam . Their vital sign measure . They answer question health current medication . - Participants history iron overload allergy Ferumoxytol . - Participants magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) scan . The scanner metal cylinder strong magnetic field . Participants lie table slide scanner . They standard sensor , know coil , wrap around abdomen improve scan . This like small blanket wiring inside . Participants need lie still scan table 1 hour . - Participants ultrasound . This use harmless sound wave provide picture organ tissue inside body . - Participants receive injection Ferumoxytol intravenous line . A thin plastic tube insert vein order inject agent . - Participants another MRI ultrasound 24 48 hour injection . - The study follow participant medical course least 1 year .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Study Ferumoxytol Enhanced MRI Detecting Lymph Node Metastases Prostate , Bladder , Kidney Cancers</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Background : - Conventional imaging modality ( e.g . compute tomography [ CT ] magnetic resonance image [ MRI ] ) currently use detection lymph node metastases many cancer type , include prostate , bladder kidney cancer , however diagnosis base node enlargement neither sensitive specific ( i.e . small node harbor metastasis , large node hyperplastic ) . - As consequence , standard care remove numerous lymph node surgery biopsy enlarge node ascertain lymph node status . - In 2003 Dextran coat ultra small superparamagnetic iron oxide particle ( USPIO ) , also know Ferumoxtran-10 ( Combidex , AMAG Pharmaceuticals , Inc. Lexington , MA , US ) show localize lymph node metastasis much great accuracy unenhanced MRI . Although large study prostate cancer successful , FDA Advisory Panel recommend approval company abandon agent . - In 2009 Ferumoxytol ( Feraheme AMAG Pharmaceuticals , Inc. Lexington , MA , US ) semi-synthetic carbohydrate coat , magnetic iron oxide preparation similar ferumoxtran 10 approve iron replacement therapy . Like ferumoxtran 10 , compound take normal lymph node exclude malignant nodal tissue . - Results recent NCI trial ( 11-C-0098 ) 15 patient reveal use dose 7.5 mg/kg Fe safe yield homogenous accurate signal change benign lymph node comparison 4 6 mg/kg Fe dose . This dose test 5 patient know suspected nodal involvement prostate cancer four five patient positive lymph node low signal drop benign node . The one case uptake positive node may vascular basis . This pilot study stimulate interest large study involve variety cancer type . Primary Objective : -To compare difference signal metastatic normal node prostate , kidney bladder cancer patient . Eligibility - Subject must great equal 18 year old . - Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group Performance score 0 2 . - There 3 parallel arm study . All patient must evidence lymph node involvement ( short axis diameter great equal 1.5 cm ) . - In addition : - Arm 1 : Subject must document diagnosis prostate cancer . - Arm 2 : Subject must document diagnosis bladder cancer ( transitional cell carcinoma ) . - Arm 3 : Subject must document diagnosis kidney cancer ( renal cell cancer type ) . Design : - This single site 3-arm ( arm 1=prostate cancer , arm 2=bladder cancer , arm 3=kidney cancer ) study enrol 50 evaluable patient ( 30 evaluable arm 1 , 10 evaluable arm 2 3 ) document prostate , bladder kidney cancer evidence lymph node involvement [ size great equal 1.5 cm measure conventional imaging ( e.g . CT , MRI ) ] . - All subject undergo pre-infusion , 24 , 48 hour post-Ferumoxytol infusion ( dose 7.5mg/kg Fe ) MRI consist T1 weight ( W ) , T2W T2*W 3 Tesla MRI . - Imaging correlated histology resect biopsied lymph node available . Occasionally , patient may undergo biopsy surgical excision lymph node . This may occur lymph node overtly large therefore highly likely represent lymph node involvement . In case , patient evaluate clinical follow typically occur every three month NCI protocol . If lesion demonstrate growth regression base RECIST 1.1 criterion follow study lesion consider positive tumor . If stable least one year consider non-malignant . The MR image analysis intra-patient . - Patients also undergo ultrasound examination imageable lymph node ( e.g . inguinal node ) pre-infusion 24 , 48 hour post-Ferumoxytol infusion time point . The signal change post-infusion ultrasound visually evaluate determine uptake ferumoxytol alters sonographic feature .</detailed_description>
