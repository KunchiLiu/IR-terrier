	<detailed_description>I . Research Project Title : Adolescent decision make HIV risk avoidance : Neurocognitive factor ( Referred : `` Project DASH '' ) II . Investigator name , degree , title department : PI : Sarah Feldstein Ewing , PhD ( primary ) , Assistant Professor University Honors/ CASAA/ MRN , Mind Research Network ; Angela Bryan , PhD , ( secondary ) , Research Professor , MRN/Psychology/CASAA III . Hypothesis/Study Goals ( question hop answered study ) Young people age 25 great risk sexually transmit disease ( STDs ) include human immunodeficiency virus ( HIV ; Centers Disease Control Prevention ( CDC , 2002 ) . Indeed 50 % new HIV infection worldwide occur among young people age 15 24 ( Wilson et al. , 2010 ) . Young people involve juvenile justice system ( Teplin , Mericle , McClelland &amp; Abram , 2003 ) particularly high risk negative outcome include HIV result risky sexual behavior . In comparison general adolescent population , adolescent involve justice system young first intercourse , high rate anal intercourse , great number sex partner , low rate condom use ( Barthlow , Horan , DiClemente , &amp; Lanier ; 1995 ; DiClemente , 1991 ; 1992 ; Lux &amp; Petosa , 1994 , 1995 ; Montanaro et al. , 2010 ) . Extensive research indicate development region brain important decision-making regard risky situation ( e.g. , OFC , Ursu &amp; Carter , 2005 ; ventral striatum , Van Leijenjorst et al. , 2010 ; IFG , Luna et al. , 2010 , Aron et al. , 2003 ; Chamberlain &amp; Sahakian , 2007 ; VM-PFC , Bechara , 2004 ; ACC , Rueda , Posner , &amp; Rothbart , 2005 ) still occur adolescence ( e.g. , RFA-NR-11-007 ; Van Leijenjorst et al. , 2010 ; Galvan et al. , 2006 ; Casey et al. , 2005 ; 2000 ) . Our work demonstrate neurocognitive network include important brain region associate sexual risk response HIV/STD risk reduction intervention . Additionally , clear current intervention reduce risky sexual decision-making behavior work well , equally effective everyone . Many exist intervention , include ( Bryan et al. , 2009 ) , rely high level cognition . The effectiveness intervention thus likely moderated developmental individual difference neurocognition underlie decision-making condition arousal risk . It stand reason , , basic , reward-based intervention rely heavily likely underdeveloped system cognitive control ( e.g. , impulsivity ) might successful adolescent less developed neurocognitive control network . While neuronal mechanism underlie risky decision-making study laboratory , translate basic finding integrative program research link mechanisms intervention outcome . Consistent NINR RFA `` Interdisciplinary Approaches HIV/AIDS Risk-Avoidance Decision Making Developing Adolescence '' , application seek test two different type intervention `` well understanding role psychosocial predictor neurological biomarkers adolescent risk taking…can lead alternative developmentally culturally appropriate interventions… . '' In follow , employ randomize control trial contrast intervention rely well-developed cognitive control system ( Motivational Interviewing ; MI ) intervention relies basic response schedule reward ( Behavioral Skills Training ; BST ) . The innovative aspect propose research integrative model link neurocognitive , psychological , developmental construct involve risk behavior , use fMRI ass neurocognitive moderator intervention effect , potential translation finding practice via linkage easily-administered , computerized cognitive task . To accomplish , propose specific aim : 1 . The first aim demonstrate association function reward control network brain risky sexual behavior . • Hypothesis 1 . Consistent extant literature ( e.g. , Van Leijenhorst et al. , 2010 ; Bjork et al. , 2004 ) , expect decrease activation control network increase activation reward network brain associate high level risky sexual behavior . 2 . The second aim understand whether variability neurocognitive activation associate control reward system predict effectiveness two commonly used intervention : individually-based MI intervention individually-based BST intervention reduce risky sexual behavior among justice-involved adolescent high risk HIV/STDs . - Hypothesis 2 . Adolescents increase activation control network brain task associate response inhibition ( Go/NoGo ) respond well MI intervention adolescent decrease activation area . - Hypothesis 3 . Adolescents increase activation reward network brain task associate reward salience ( Monetary Incentive Delay ; MID ) respond well BST intervention adolescent decrease activation area . 3 . The third aim examine correlation neurocognitive response fMRI-based response inhibition reward base task parallel set cognitive task easily administer outside scanner ( e.g. , Conners ' Continuous Processing Task ; Monetary Incentive Delay ) assess potential translation neurocognitive finding real-world application . 4 . To determine whether specific genetic factor , previously relate psychosocial treatment response , associate differential brain activation intervention response . - Hypothesis 4 : Individuals DRD4 S genotype evidence great activation key brain region response MI ( e.g. , IFG , insula ) , compare receive BST .</detailed_description>
