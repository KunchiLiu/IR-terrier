	<detailed_description>Operating theater complex system efficient communication critical patient safety . Patient safety check-list use worldwide way improve communication teamwork operate room order decrease perioperative morbidity mortality . Previous study show communication failure OR may associate adverse event . The improvement safety culture ( include communication team work ) may obtain simulation base training . The primary objective before-after study assess efficacy simulation-based curriculum involve OR medical non medical personnel order improve communication OR . In brief , first period , audit ass communication efficacy teamwork realize 125 surgical procedure . Communication failure consequence record use standardized form fill trained personnel . In second phase , OR personnel ( surgeon , anesthesiologist , nurse ) invite participate special training communication teamwork . This curriculum include formal presentation also simulation-based training . Scenarios build improve ability communicate specific situation ( fire OR , haemorrhage , wrong side , anaphylaxis ) . In third phase , audit communication teamwork , similar first phase realize . The primary endpoint frequency surgical intervention least one communication failure consequence . The investigator expect significant decrease rate communication failure phase 1 3 . A fourth phase consist last audit two year phase 1 evaluate long-term effect curriculum .</detailed_description>
