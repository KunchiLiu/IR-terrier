	<brief_title>Inolitazone Dihydrochloride Paclitaxel Treating Patients With Advanced Anaplastic Thyroid Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To determine combination paclitaxel efatutazone ( efatutazone dihydrochloride ) improve confirm response rate patient advance anaplastic thyroid cancer . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . To estimate overall survival ( OS ) , duration response , progression-free survival ( PFS ) , adverse event rate combination paclitaxel efatutazone . TERTIARY OBJECTIVES : I . The association biomarkers clinical outcome data assess exploratory translational analysis . OUTLINE : Patients receive paclitaxel intravenously ( IV ) 3 hour day 1 efatutazone dihydrochloride orally ( PO ) twice daily ( BID ) day 1-21 . Courses repeat every 21 day absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . After completion study treatment , patient follow within 28 day , every 8 week disease progression , every 6 month 5 year .</detailed_description>
