	<brief_summary>This study 12-week , multicenter , randomize , double blind , parallel group , placebo-controlled study . The purpose study replicate therapeutic benefit UMEC/VI 62.5/25 microgram ( mcg ) health-related quality life reflect St. George 's Respiratory Questionnaire ( SGRQ ) score symptom reflect rescue medication use observe 6 month placebo control study ( DB2113373 ) . Lung function assess provide objective measure support subjective patient report outcome SGRQ rescue medication use . The study intend provide additional evidence support use UMEC/VI maintenance treatment COPD Approximately 496 subject randomize approximately 62 center order ensure 422 subject complete 12 week treatment . Eligible subject randomize UMEC/VI 62.5/25mcg placebo 1:1 ratio . All treatment administer once-daily morning via Dry Powder Inhaler ( DPI ) . There total 5 clinic visit . The total duration study participation approximately 15 week . All subject provide albuterol/salbutamol use need relief COPD symptom throughout run-in double-blind treatment period .</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Type subject : Outpatient . Informed Consent : A sign date write informed consent prior study participation . Age : 40 year age old Visit 1 . Gender : Male female subject eligible participate study . A female subject eligible enter participate study : Nonchild bear potential ( i.e . physiologically incapable become pregnant , include female postmenopausal surgically sterile ) . Surgically sterile female define documented hysterectomy and/or bilateral oophorectomy tubal ligation . Postmenopausal female define amenorrhoeic great 1 year appropriate clinical profile ( For example [ e.g . ] age appropriate , &gt; 45 year , absence hormone replacement therapy ; child bearing potential , negative pregnancy test screening , agree one follow acceptable contraceptive method use consistently correctly ( i.e . accordance approve product label , appropriate , instruction physician duration study screen followup contact ) : abstinence ; oral contraceptive ( either combine progestogen alone ) ; injectable progestogen ; implant levonorgestrel ; estrogenic vaginal ring ; percutaneous contraceptive patch ; intrauterine device ( IUD ) intrauterine system ( IUS ) meet SOP effectiveness criterion state product label ; male partner sterilization ( vasectomy documentation azoospermia ) prior female subject 's entry study ( male sole partner subject ) ; double barrier method : condom occlusive cap ( diaphragm cervical/vault cap ) vaginal spermicidal agent ( foam/gel/film/cream/suppository ) . Diagnosis : An established clinical history COPD accordance definition American Thoracic Society/European Respiratory Society . Smoking History : Current former cigarette smoker history cigarette smoke &gt; =10 packyears [ number pack year = ( number cigarette per day / 20 ) x number year smoke ( e.g . 20 cigarette per day 10 year , 10 cigarette per day 20 year equal 10 packyears ) ] . Former smoker define stop smoke least 6 month prior Visit 1 . Pipe and/or cigar use use calculate packyear history . Severity Disease : A pre postalbuterol/salbutamol FEV1/ Forced Vital Capacity ( FVC ) ratio &lt; 0.70 postalbuterol/salbutamol FEV1 &lt; =70 % predict normal value calculate use National Health Nutrition Examination Survey ( NHANES ) III reference equation Visit 1 . Dyspnea : A score &gt; =2 Modified Medical Research Council ( mMRC ) Dyspnea Scale Visit 1 . Pregnancy : Women pregnant lactate plan become pregnant study . Asthma : A current diagnosis asthma . Other Respiratory Disorders : Known alpha1 antitrypsin deficiency , active lung infection ( tuberculosis ) , lung cancer absolute exclusionary condition . A subject , opinion investigator , significant respiratory condition addition COPD exclude . Examples may include clinically significant bronchiectasis , pulmonary hypertension , sarcoidosis , interstitial lung disease . Other Diseases/Abnormalities : Any subject consider unlikely survive duration study period rapidly progress disease immediate lifethreatening illness ( e.g . cancer ) . In addition , subject condition ( e.g . neurological condition ) likely affect respiratory function include study . Severe Hepatic Impairment : Patients severe hepatic impairment ( ChildPugh class C ) exclude unless , opinion investigator , benefit likely outweigh risk . Unstable life threaten cardiac disease : UMEC/VI use caution subject severe cardiovascular disease . In opinion investigator , use consider benefit likely outweigh risk condition : myocardial infarction unstable angina last 6 month ; unstable life threaten cardiac arrhythmia require intervention last 3 month ; New York Heart Association ( NYHA ) Class IV heart failure . Contraindications : Any history allergy hypersensitivity anticholinergic/muscarinic receptor antagonist , beta2agonist , sympathomimetic , lactose/milk protein magnesium stearate . Antimuscarinic effect : Subjects medical condition narrowangle glaucoma , urinary retention , prostatic hypertrophy , bladder neck obstruction include , opinion study physician , benefit outweighs risk . Hospitalization : Hospitalization COPD pneumonia within 12 week prior Visit 1 . Lung Resection : Lung volume reduction surgery within 12 month prior Visit 1 . 12Lead Electrocardiogram ( ECG ) : Investigators provide ECG review conduct centralized independent cardiologist assist evaluation subject eligibility . The Investigator determine clinical significance abnormal ECG find relation subject 's medical history exclude subject would undue risk participate trial . Subjects follow abnormality exclude participation study : Atrial fibrillation rapid ventricular rate &gt; 120 beat per minute ( bpm ) ; Sustained nonsustained ventricular tachycardia ; Second degree heart block Mobitz type II third degree heart block ( unless pacemaker defibrillator insert ) . Medication Prior Spirometry : Unable withhold albuterol/salbutamol 4 hour period require prior spirometry test study visit . Interactions : Concomitant administration betablockers strong Cytochrome P450 3A4 ( CYP3A4 ) inhibitor permit , Investigator 's opinion , likely benefit outweigh potential risk . Medications Prior Screening : Use follow medication accord follow defined time interval prior Visit 1 : Depot corticosteroid ( 12 week ) , systemic , oral parenteral corticosteroid ( 6 week ) , antibiotic ( low respiratory tract infection ) ( 6 week ) , Long act BetaAgonist ( LABA ) / Inhaled Corticosteroid ( ICS ) combination product LABA/ICS therapy discontinue completely ( 30 day ) , LABA/ICS combination product discontinue LABA/ICS therapy switch ICS monotherapy ( 48 hour salmeterol formoterol component 14 day vilanterol component ) , ICS ( dose &gt; 1000 mcg/day fluticasone propionate equivalent ) ( 30 day ) , Initiation discontinuation ICS use ( 30 day ) , Phosphodiesterase 4 ( PDE4 ) Inhibitor ( roflumilast ) ( 14 day ) , Inhaled long act beta2 agonist ( 48 hour salmeterol , formoterol , 14 day olodaterol , indacaterol ) , Longacting muscarinic antagonist ( tiotropium , aclidinium , glycopyrronium , umeclidinium ) ( 7 day ) , LAMA/LABA combination product LAMA/LABA therapy discontinue completely ( Apply whichever mono component long washout ) , Theophyllines ( 48 hour ) , Oral beta2agonists ( Longacting [ 48 hour ] , shortacting [ 12 hour ] ) , Inhaled short act beta2agonists ( 4 hour ) , Inhaled shortacting anticholinergic ( 4 hour ) , Inhaled shortacting anticholinergic/shortacting beta2agonist combination product ( 4 hour ) , Any investigational medication ( 30 day within 5 drug halflives [ whichever longer ] ) Oxygen : Use longterm oxygen therapy ( LTOT ) describe oxygen therapy prescribe great 12 hour day . Asneeded oxygen use ( i.e. , &lt; =12 hour per day ) exclusionary .
