	<brief_title>Trametinib Increasing Tumoral Iodine Incorporation Patients With Recurrent Metastatic Thyroid Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To evaluate effect trametinib enhance radioiodine ( RAI ) activity determine proportion patient alive 6 month without disease progression Response Evaluation Criteria Solid Tumors version 1.1 ( RECIST v 1.1 ) criterion follow treatment RAI co-administration trametinib . ( Cohort A ) II . To evaluate effect trametinib enhance RAI activity determine objective response rate ( ORR ) 6 month follow treatment radioiodine ( RAI ) co-administration trametinib . ( Cohort A ) III . To determine proportion patient follow trametinib therapy increase tumoral iodine incorporation quantify iodine iodine-124 ( I-124 ) positron emission tomography ( PET ) /computed tomography ( CT ) lesional dosimetry . ( Cohort B ) SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . To determine proportion patient follow trametinib therapy increase tumoral iodine incorporation quantify I-124 PET/CT lesional dosimetry . ( Cohort A ) II . To evaluate safety/tolerability trametinib without RAI . ( Cohort A ) III . To evaluate change thyroglobulin level patient treat RAI . ( Cohort A ) IV . To explore potential correlation genomic alteration present tumor and/or tumoral pharmacodynamic change induce trametinib clinical outcome . ( Cohort A ) V. To evaluate effect trametinib enhance RAI activity determine ORR 6 month follow treatment RAI co-administration trametinib . ( Cohort B ) VI . To evaluate effect trametinib enhance RAI activity determine proportion patient alive 6 month without disease progression RECIST v 1.1 criterion follow treatment RAI co-administration trametinib . ( Cohort B ) VII . To evaluate safety/tolerability trametinib without RAI . ( Cohort B ) VIII . To evaluate change thyroglobulin level patient treat RAI . ( Cohort B ) IX . To explore potential correlation genomic alteration present tumor and/or tumoral pharmacodynamic change induce trametinib clinical outcome . ( Cohort B ) X . Preliminary evaluation best objective response ( BOR ) rate patient treat trametinib alone . ( Cohort C ) XI . Preliminary evaluation proportion patient follow treatment trametinib alive 6 month without disease progression RECIST v 1.1 criterion . ( Cohort C ) XII . To evaluate safety/tolerability trametinib . ( Cohort C ) XIII . To evaluate change thyroglobulin level patient treat trametinib . ( Cohort C ) XIV . To explore potential correlation genomic alteration present tumor and/or tumoral pharmacodynamic change induce trametinib clinical outcome . ( Cohort C ) XV . To explore impact continue trametinib upon RAI avidity efficacy . ( Cohort C ) OUTLINE : Patients undergo iodine I-124 PET/CT day 5 week 1 . Beginning day 6 , patient receive trametinib orally ( PO ) daily 4 week absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . Patients undergo second iodine I-124 PET/CT week 5 . If I-124 PET/CT show enough iodine absorption , patient may receive iodine I-131 PO continue receive trametinib another 2 day . If I-124 show thyroid absorb iodine , patient may continue trametinib doctor 's discretion receive iodine I-131 . After completion study treatment , patient follow 30 day .</detailed_description>
