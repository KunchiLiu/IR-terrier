	<brief_summary>Overview : This 6 month , two-arm randomized clinical trial use compare exergaming control group . The investigator randomize Black sedentary overweight/obese woman Wii Fit exercise ( n=50 ) control arm ( n=50 ) . Women Wii Fit exercise group come Georgetown community-based exercise facility 3 days/wk . The control group ask maintain current daily activity exercise duration study . Based investigator previous finding woman engage 75-150 mins/wk brisk walk 18 % decrease risk breast cancer , investigator target level activity investigator intervention arm . Also , 150 min/week physical activity meet current recommendation American College Sports Medicine ( ACSM ) US Department Health Human Services healthy individual line recommendation American Cancer Society ( ACS ) cancer prevention .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>1 . * Purpose project ( one two sentence ) : To examine feasibility acceptability exergaming intervention community-based setting , explore effect exergaming cardiovascular fitness , body mass index percent body fat Black woman sedentary overweight obese . 2 . * Study design ( example , hypothesis , research question , standard experimental procedures/drugs/devices equipment , etc . ) : Overview : This 6 month , two-arm randomized clinical trial use compare exergaming control group . The investigator randomize Black sedentary overweight/obese woman Wii Fit exercise ( n=50 ) control arm ( n=50 ) . Women Wii Fit exercise group come Georgetown community-based exercise facility 3 days/wk . The control group ask maintain current daily activity exercise duration study . Based investigator previous finding woman engage 75-150 mins/wk brisk walk 18 % decrease risk breast cancer , investigator target level activity investigator intervention arm . Also , 150 min/week physical activity meet current recommendation American College Sports Medicine ( ACSM ) US Department Health Human Services healthy individual line recommendation American Cancer Society ( ACS ) cancer prevention . Exercise Intervention : Participants Wii Fit exergaming group goal 150 min/wk moderate intensity exercise last 5 mo 6 mo intervention . Heart rate ( HR ) monitor quantify exercise intensity . Participants exercise HR equal 45-65 % maximal oxygen consumption ( VO2max ) . Given expect VO2max value population , investigator project Wii Fit videogames must elevate energy expenditure 3-4 time rest metabolic rate achieve desire HR response . As summarize , previous study show elevation energy expenditure expect activity . Wii Fit station variety active game available participant Georgetown University Community Based Office . Participants instruct exercise physiologist achieve require HR . The training consist 3 days/wk supervise Wii Fit physical activity . Exercise duration increase gradually 75 150 min/wk wk 477 . Thereafter , woman maintain &gt; 150 min/wk moderate-intensity physical activity . Participants complete daily exercise diary record type duration physical activity , HR . Control Group : After baseline test control group ask maintain current daily activity duration study . The control group option exercise Wii Fit station follow completion study . They receive measure exercise group . Diet : Participants group instruct maintain diet constant throughout study . Wii Fit intervention participant weigh every session lose weight could account exercise counsel return caloric intake start study . * Rationale justification study ( i.e . historical background , investigator 's personal experience , pertinent medical literature , etc . ) : Several risk factor identify increase breast cancer risk , non-modifiable factor ( e.g. , age , family history , race ) modifiable ( e.g. , physical activity , body weight , dietary habit , alcohol intake ) . However , within last 10 year cancer organization start recommend physical activity preventive measure breast cancer . The American Cancer Society ( ACS ) International Agency Research Cancer World Health Organization recommend regular physical activity strategy woman reduce risk develop breast cancer . Specific recommendation breast cancer prevention , initially focus diet , focused maintain healthy weight throughout life balance caloric intake increase caloric expenditure via increased physical activity level , lose weight overweight obese . Obesity significant public health problem associate increase postmenopausal breast cancer incidence mortality . This research proposal ass novel method improve physical activity African American woman , generally less physically active overweight obese woman racial ethnic group . - Treatment Plan : The participant Wii Fit exergaming group encourage meet maintain goal 150 min/wk moderate intensity exercise 6 month . Goals per individual base baseline data . Exercise duration increase gradually 75 min/wk week 1 150 min/wk week 4 . Thereafter , woman maintain &gt; 150 min/wk moderate-intensity physical activity . The training consist 3 days/wk supervise physical activity use Nintendo Wii Fit active videogames . Participants exercise HR equal 45-65 % VO2max . Given expect VO2max value population , investigator project Wii Fit videogames elevate energy expenditure 3-4 time rest metabolic rate achieve desire HR response . As summarize , previous study show elevation energy expenditure expect activity . Participants instructed monitor physical activity order assist perceive behavioral control increase self-efficacy towards meeting goal . During aerobic exercise session , participant wear Polar heart rate monitor determine exercise intensity give instruction exercise physiologist achieve require HR . In addition , participant complete daily exercise diary record type duration physical activity , exercise HR . Because many woman may access gym membership able afford expensive exercise equipment , investigator address environmental barrier establish Wii Fit station variety active game available participant Community Based Office . Exergames select use exercise session choose base energy expenditure data . Those active videogames show achieve energy expenditure level necessary achieve 60 % HRmax investigator specific study population select . For example , active videogames test published study , Wii Fit box Dance Dance Revolution , find achieve physical activity level moderate intensity ( 3.0-6.0 METs ) , meet American College Sports Medicine guideline health fitness . Graves et al . ( 2008 ) , example find physical activity level reach 68 % maximal heart rate ( HRmax ) use Wii Fit also meet ACSM aerobic fitness recommendation ( 60 % HRmax ) .</detailed_description>
