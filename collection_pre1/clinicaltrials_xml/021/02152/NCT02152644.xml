	<brief_title>Prevalence Amyloidosis Carpal Tunnel</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Amyloidosis ( A ) disease cause deposit usually misfolded protein form amorphous fibrillar material different tissue , may cause progressive dysfunction . The prevalence amyloidosis varies population study type amyloid . Although prevalence general population unknown , Mayo Clinic U.S. estimate 1/90666 . This disease generate 0.0084 % ( 1367/16232579 ) total hospital visit April 2008 April 2009 England . The frequent clinical manifestation cardiac , renal hepatic involvement , vary widely depend type amyloidosis , organ affected extent deposit . Infiltration amyloid may produce sign symptom could similar disease , like rheumatologic one . This potentially polymorphous clinic presentation may suggest under-diagnosis low clinical suspicion . Carpal tunnel syndrome frequent patient A may initial manifestation . This syndrome generate progressive infiltration amyloid fibrils retinaculum flexor synovial tissue , cause compression medium nerve . A frequency 13 % carpal tunnel syndrome report patient primary amyloidosis . In 1993 , Breda et al . assess 98 tendon synovial tissue 's biopsy patient operate carpal tunnel syndrome . The pathology reveal amyloid deposition 12 % , 8 evidence systemic disease . This amyloid deposition interpret probably secondary chronic local inflammation . In 1992 , Kyle et al . evaluate incidence systemic amyloidosis retrospective cohort 35 patient carpal tunnel syndrome synovial local deposition amyloidosis without evidence systemic amyloidosis . During follow-up 2 developed systemic amyloidosis 11 show laboratory abnormality ( 9 monoclonal band 2 monoclonal light chain urine ) . In group amyloid deposition identify transthyretin ( TTR ) dependent 32 35 case . Even though estimation regard prevalence A general population worldwide patient carpal tunnel syndrome surgery , local estimation Argentina . Additionally , know presentation amyloid deposit tendon element pathological carpal tunnel correlate subcutaneous amyloid deposit . In project investigator propose estimate prevalence Amyloidosis synovial tissue patient surgical carpal tunnel syndrome correlate deposit amyloid subcutaneous cellular tissue fat . What prevalence amyloidosis , cellular subcutaneous fat biopsy , flexor retinaculum carpus synovial tissue flexor tendon sheath , patient carpal tunnel syndrome surgery ? Primary objective 1 . To estimate prevalence presence amyloid deposit : ( ) biopsy cellular subcutaneous fat , ( ii ) flexor retinaculum carpus ( iii ) synovial tissue flexor tendon sheath , requirement carpal tunnel surgery . Secondary objective 1 . Detect characterize patient subclinical amyloidosis . 2 . Identify protein deposit patient amyloidosis .</detailed_description>
