	<brief_summary>The goal clinical research study find high tolerable dose Femara ( letrozole ) give combination Afinitor ( everolimus ) Herceptin ( trastuzumab ) patient advanced cancer . The safety drug combination also study .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Everolimus , Letrozole Trastuzumab HR- HER2/Neu-positive Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Study Groups : If find eligible take part study , assign dose level trastuzumab everolimus base join study . Up 5 dose level trastuzumab everolimus test . Up 3 participant enrol dose level . The first group participant receive low dose level . Each new group receive high dose group , intolerable side effect see . This continue high tolerable dose trastuzumab everolimus find . All participant receive dose level letrozole . After 4th cycle complete , may consider treatment dose level high dose first assign . In order treat high dose level , must tolerate low dose least 4 cycle therapy . Also , new , high dose receive must high tolerate dose see study far . Once high tolerate dose drug combination find , 2 group 12 participant enrolled expansion group . One group include participant breast cancer group include participant solid tumor . Study Drug Administration : You take letrozole everolimus mouth 1 time every day time . Both drug take either without food every time . You receive trastuzumab vein Day 1 every 21-day cycle Study Visits : On Day 1 every Cycle : - You physical exam . - Blood ( 3 teaspoon ) draw routine test test hepatitis B . - If become pregnant , urine pregnancy test . Every 2 cycle , CT scan MRI check status disease . If doctor think need , perform often . At end Cycle 4 every 4 cycle , ECHO MUGA scan check heart function . Length Study : You may continue take study drug long doctor think best interest . You longer able take study drug disease get bad , intolerable side effect occur , unable follow study direction . Your participation study complete end-of-study follow-up visit . End-of-Study Visit : After last dose study drug , end-of-study visit . At visit : - You physical exam . - Blood ( 3 teaspoon ) urine collect routine test . This investigational study . Letrozole FDA approve commercially available treatment certain kind breast cancer . Everolimus FDA approve treat advance renal cell carcinoma . Trastuzumab FDA approve certain kind gastric breast cancer . The combination drug consider investigational . Up 42 patient take part study . All enrol MD Anderson .</detailed_description>
