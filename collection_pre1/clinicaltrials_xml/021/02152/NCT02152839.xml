	<brief_summary>Maintenance body 's skeletal muscle key healthy old age . However , age lose average 1-2 % muscle year . In order slow loss need understand fully mechanisms regulate muscle mass age . In project aim determine mechanism use new novel technique 'heavy ' water ingestion , allow u measure multiple aspect skeletal muscle mass control normal everyday activity young old individual period 6 week . We also determine influence resistance exercise training period offset decline muscle age use method</brief_summary>
