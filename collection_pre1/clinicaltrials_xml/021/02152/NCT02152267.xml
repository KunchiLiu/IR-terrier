	<detailed_description>1 . INTRODUCTION Pain among main complaint patient seek care hospital primary care unit . Temporomandibular Disorders ( TMD ) patient become part daily routine health care professional . Temporomandibular cranial-facial disorder prevalent , since 1987 , International Headache Society hold meeting classify different type pain associate head . This result publication Manual Classification Headaches - The International Classification Disorders Headache revise 2013 . There different strategy treat TMD patient , best chosen depend type problem diagnose suitable strategy accord professional experience . Strategies range advice lifestyle , psychotherapy , containment jaw , kinesitherapy , ultrasound , TENS , muscle relaxant plat , allopathic homeopathic therapy surgical intervention temporomandibular joint ( TMJ ) . Some technique aim treat muscle , others treat dental occlusion joint structure whose primary focus psycho-emotional factor . As The TMDs due various factor muscular , joint , emotional , inflammatory , autoimmune even infectious reason , treatment include different therapy rehabilitation process , consider best strategy patient . Literature show cause muscular origin prevalent patient type disorder ) . A systematic review use study functional brain imaging , show , although majority disorder associate muscle pain , would secondary process triggered Central Nervous System ( CNS ) . Following theory , behavioral study show TMD , almost always , related preexist psychopathology . Chronic pain involve neuronal excitability . study use transcranial magnetic stimulation ( TMS ) find high threshold side rest motor cortex low regulation response . Furthermore find low response intracortical facilitation inhibition . The transcranial direct current stimulation ( tDCS ) allow neuronal membrane neuromodulate enhance inhibit potential action cortex . Studies animal show anodal stimulation modulate membrane way depolarize result long term potential stimulate area . Some study show improvement subject fibromyalgia chronic pain use neuromodulation . Some author suggest anodal tDCS motor cortex decrease pain modulating activity neuronal network responsible pain , example thalamus . It also facilitate descend inhibition pain . However evidence support efficacy tDCS . Another montage tDCS dorsolateral prefrontal cortex ( DLPFC ) . This area involve anxiety depression without direct analgesic effect . A study show pain level decrease tDCS DLPFC patient emotional affective trouble . The author suggest base emotional modulation pain independent network somatosensory pain perception . A study find anxiety modulation tDCS application DLPFC use cathodal current right side anodal leave side . This result weak evidence tDCS anxiety effect , demand investigate approach . Regarding parameter author suggest , 1 2mA , common use 2 mA . There discussion milliamperage appropriate investigator use cathodal current . A study verify result cathodal anodal 2mA , increase motor evocated potential ( MEP ) whereas 1mA cathodal current decrease cortical excitability . Regarding risk side adverse effect systematic review find adverse effect itch , tingle mild headache linger stimulus remove . The adverse effect depend intensity duration usually protocol recommends use low intensity ( 1 2mA ) short period time 20 30 minute . A questionnaire utilized access effect . 2 . PROBLEM Most strategy treatment TMDs local aim treat directly cranial-facial muscle , apply kinesitherapy TMJ and/or jaws occlusion . Some drug , tricyclic antidepressant , act CNS use patient positive result begin treatment . However , many patient , use drug daily basis , refractory present improvement pain anymore present several side effect . Therefore , investigator want know tDCS DLPFC would analgesic effect reach emotional area different result different amplitude . 3 . HYPOTHESIS The investigator believe neuromodulation tDCS DLPFC would decrease anxiety level consequently muscular hyperactivity important etiological factor TMD . Using motor evoke potential investigator verify change occur 1mA 2mA stimulation change different compare . 4 . OBJECTIVES 4.1- GENERAL PURPOSE Investigate cathodal tDCS right DLPFC analgesic effect subject muscular TMD . 4.2- SPECIFICS PURPOSES 1- Evaluate tDCS effect regard pain perception pressure threshold ; 2- Evaluate tDCS effect anxiety stress ; 3- Measure masseter MEP pre post tDCS ; 4- Correlate pain intensity anxiety masseter MEP pre post tDCS ; 5- Compare tDCS effect pain intensity , anxiety , stress masseter MEP apply different intensity ( 1mA/2mA ) . 5 . BACKGROUND tDCS show promising result treatment chronic pain several type disease , good non-invasive alternative treat pain TMD patient . Also , base study show change brain activity chronic pain patient difficulty face treat TMD , need conduct clinical trial use new technique , neuromodulation , help patient control pain . Therefore , tDCS emerge new tool couple effective treatment already use patient . Furthermore , investigator think tie relationship anxiety muscular hyperactivity evidence say tDCS emotional area decrease anxiety . 6 . MATERIALS AND METHODS 6.1 Sample The IMMPACT ( Initiative Methods , Measurement , Pain Assessment Clinical Trial ) advise effect size 0.5 treat pain disease . Using parameter G*Power 3.1 , 80 % statistical power , alpha 0.05 , measure six measure three intervention group . Therefore sample size 15 subject muscular TMD utilized . Subjects database Occlusion TMJ Center Dentistry Faculty Federal University Bahia . Randomization The subject allocate consecutively randomization intervention order use tool randomization.com website ( Dallal GE , http : //www.randomization.com ) . The investigator use second generation suggest crossover study . 6.2 Materials The material available budget table questionnaire annex . 6.3 Data Collection Procedure All subject treat use three different intervention ( group I1 , I2 e I3 ) respect washout period 7 day avoid residual effect . The intervention order determine randomization per group intervention . After COAT institutional authorization , subject contact phone ask want participate study . Those wish participate qualify accord selection criterion complete pre-screening questionnaire schedule read sign consent form ( 2 copy ) . Women chill-bearing potential require take urine pregnancy test screening process . If subject becomes pregnant course study , withdrawn study . At end first appointment subject take VAS ISTA diary home complete 7 day baseline evaluation . The investigator use average VAS ISTA diary get baseline value . During second visit , clinical neurological assessment perform tDCS stimulation . During second visit ( T2 ) clinical neurological assessment perform . The clinical assessment guide RDC/TMD , pain anxiety diary sensory test ( Von Frey monofilaments algometry/EMG system ) . The neurophysiological assessment do use EEG analyze cortical activity . Each patient clinically neurologically assessed stimulation , allow data collect 6 time ( T2 T7 ) also first visit . To group I1 , parameter use TDCS 1mA cathodal right DLPFC anodal stimulation supraorbital contralateral area . With chosen area investigator aim reach cerebral region responsible anxiety . To group I2 , parameter use ; however current 2mA . The parameter group I3 , control group , active device sham mode . To acquire placebo effect , current use first 30 second reduce gradually zero 20 second . This method show effective previous study accept academic community blind subject without type effect cortical excitability . The current apply use 35cm2 electrode soak saline substance ( 140mMol de NaCl water dissolve Mille-Q ) . The electrode connect device driven 9v battery regulate digital multimeter ( EZA EZ 984 , China ) standard error Â±1.5 % ( Montenegro et al. , 2012 ) . All subject receive one stimulation session type intervention ( I1 , I2 , I3 ) , total 3 session . After tDCS session subject answer adverse effect questionnaire . A trained researcher procedure . A researcher responsible general coordination ( E.P.S . ) hold randomization list responsible tDCS stimulation would know information . 6.4 Study Variables Dependent : Visual Analogic Scale pain , inventory state-trit anxiety , sensory testing , TMS EEG . Independent : Cathodal tDCS DLPFC ( 1mA/2mA ) placebo treatment . 6.5 Data Analysis Data record Excel 2010 sheet analyze biostatistics professional access randomization process . To verify improvement tDCS session intervention group investigator use correlation test , post-hoc ( multiple compare ) , parametric one-way ANOVA data distribution normal non-parametric normal intraclass concordance test . The difference among group analyze multiple variance analysis ( placebo vs. 1mA , Placebo vs. 2mA 1mA vs. 2mA ) p-value correct multiple compare ( Bonferroni ) acquire 0.05 significance level . All data analyze intention treat .</detailed_description>
