	<brief_summary>Summary scientific evidence rationale project : Integrative molecular-genetic approach provide important insight biology glioblastoma . It meanwhile become clear , glioblastoma single tumor entity comprise different molecular subtypes , associate distinct genetic/epigenetic signature prognosis . Multimodal treatment approach combine radio- chemotherapy well recent introduction novel antiangiogenic agent result increase survival time improve quality-of-life glioblastoma patient . Yet , despite intense treatment effort therapeutic efficacy glioblastoma patient limit , lead virtually case tumor recurrence death patient . As limited fraction glioblastoma patient undergo second neurosurgery tumor recurrence ( &lt; 10 % ) , post-therapeutic sample rare systematic , large-scale study exist , address post-therapeutic morphological molecular alteration glioblastoma tumor tissue . Yet , data would help improve understand mechanism involve therapy-resistance tumor progression , develop new therapeutic approach could pave way personalized treatment strategy .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Objectives project : The aim study analyze systematically morphological molecular change associate glioblastoma progression therapy-resistance match pre- post-therapeutic glioblastoma sample . The following primary aim address : 1 . Morphological characterisation change large series match glioblastoma tissue pertain i. Vascularization hypoxia-mediated factor ii . Tumor necrosis chemoradiation-induced necrosis iii . Inflammatory response iv . Tumor cellularity proliferation v. Tumor cell phenotype treatment e.g . glial-mesenchymal transition 2 . Molecular analysis i. Transcriptomic , DNA methylation genomic profiling perform detect change gene expression , methylation copy number aberration post-therapeutic compare pre-therapeutic tumor tissue . ii . The relationship transcriptomic , DNA methylation genomic profile analyze . 3 . Exploratory analysis association morphological molecular change screen set 30 glioblastoma case ( available fresh frozen tissue first second surgery ) subsequent validation relevant finding large glioblastoma cohort ( 150 case match formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded tissue ) appropriate method include immunohistochemistry , fluorescence-in-situ-hybridization , sequence . 4 . Special attention pay gender-specific pattern therapy-related change tumor progression .</detailed_description>
