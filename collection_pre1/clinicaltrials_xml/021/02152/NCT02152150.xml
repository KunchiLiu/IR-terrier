	<detailed_description>An estimate 1.6 billion people worldwide anemic , iron deficiency ( ID ) lead cause anemia . Its prevalence high resource-limited setting , among child woman reproductive age . Even mild ID adversely impact cognitive performance , behavior , physical growth child , physical work cognitive performance adult . Interventions target micronutrient malnutrition dietary diversification , micronutrient supplementation , food fortification reduce ID , universally successful . Biofortification , process increase concentration bioavailability essential nutrient staple crop traditional plant breeding , sustainable cost-effective approach combat micronutrient deficiency . Other form bio-fortification ( agronomic management genetic modification ) also feasible . Rice , maize , wheat , pearl millet , sweet potato , bean , cassava main target crop bio-fortification . Pearl millet ( PM ) primary staple food India , particularly state Rajasthan , Gujarat Maharashtra . The high pearl millet consumption availability recently release pearl millet variety ( ICTP 8203-Fe ) significantly great iron content provide opportunity evaluate efficacy improve iron status human population . We hypothesize daily consumption iron bio-fortified pearl millet ( Fe-PM ) would improve iron status six month . We conduct randomized efficacy trial iron bio-fortified pearl millet improve iron status adolescent Maharashtra , India . The aim study : - To determine iron status adolescent boys girls rural Maharashtra improve consume high-iron bio-fortified PM - To determine adolescent rural Maharashtra consume high-iron bio-fortified PM exhibit high physical performance energetic work efficiency compare adolescent boy girl consume low-iron pearl millet . - To determine adolescent rural Maharashtra consume high-iron bio-fortified PM exhibit higher cognitive perceptual functioning , well difference pattern cortical activation ' compare child consume low-iron pearl millet . The principal hypothesis test intervention study use iron bio-fortified PM high possible level iron content comparison low-iron control : - Iron bio-fortified PM consume dietary iron intervention improve iron status iron deficient adolescent - Iron bio-fortified PM consume dietary iron intervention improve physical performance iron deficient adolescent - Iron bio-fortified PM iron intervention improve cognitive perceptual functioning iron deficient adolescents The long-term goal study show iron bio-fortification PM efficacious potentially effective strategy address iron deficiency develop country .</detailed_description>
