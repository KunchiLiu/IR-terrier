	<brief_summary>Studies use positron emission tomography ( PET ) use great success demonstrate specific abnormality several facet dopaminergic system function human population ( Narendran Martinez 2009 ) . Among first , consistent , broadly replicate finding drug‐ ( include cocaine ) dependent individual reduction subcortical ( striatal ) D2/3 receptor image , commonly , reversible , non‐selective , D2/3 receptor antagonist radiotracer , [ 11C ] raclopride . Certain dissociation D2/3 availability radioligand ( [ 11C ] raclopride vs. [ 11C ] PHNO ) brain region ( striatum vs. SN ; terminal vs. somatodendritic , respectively ) poorly understood relationship prior antagonist tracer result . In current study investigator use pharmacological intervention ( AMPT methylphenidate ) antagonist agonist radiotracers experimentally reconcile discordant finding clarify potential mechanistic inter‐relationships .</brief_summary>
