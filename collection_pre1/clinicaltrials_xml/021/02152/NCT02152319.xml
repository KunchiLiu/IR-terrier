	<detailed_description>Currently , limited access movement disorder specialist center significant portion PD population . Treatment effectiveness judge office visit improvement patient motor symptom quality life . Clinicians evaluate patient perform specific motor task rating severity 0-4 scale . A major limitation single evaluation clinical setting may accurately reflect motor symptom fluctuation experience course day , week , month . Clinicians currently lack effective , affordable medical device easily deliver patient 's home monitoring symptom continuous basis motor symptom typically change throughout day . Kinesia HomeView provide repeatable , automated system clinician use remotely monitor PD motor symptom continuous basis patient 's home . The investigator hypothesize use Kinesia HomeView system improve outcome decrease cost especially patient population area close proximity movement disorder specialist .</detailed_description>
