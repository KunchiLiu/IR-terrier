	<brief_summary>Dyspnea common symptom encounter frequently medical practitioner . The differential diagnosis patient symptom broad time consuming , immediate management distress patient desire . Lung ultrasound ( LUS ) relatively new technique help physicians accurately diagnose manage patient present dyspnea . Focused medical ultrasonography education become integrate many physician residency training program . Recent study indicate possible relationship focus ultrasonography training medical school curriculum improve physical examination accuracy . Thus , short-term training program LUS medical school major impact physician comfortable use skill deal distressed patient prospective residency training . It reduce educational burden physician residency program improve overall physician competency . Simulation-based medical education ( SBME ) ideally suit offer effective train zero-risk environment . It enable trainee gain knowledge confidence deal stressful clinical scenario without expose patient additional risk . SBME also show reliable tool assess learner ' procedural skill teach topic teamwork communication . The investigator hypothesize simulation-based training medical student enable effectively evaluate patient shortness breath use LUS .</brief_summary>
