	<brief_title>Ridge Preservation Comparing Polylactic Acid Membrane vs. Acellular Dermal Matrix Membrane</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The control subject receive bone graft extraction socket , plus additional bone graft outside socket wall cover bioabsorbable membrane make polylactic acid citric acid ester . The test subject receive type technique bone graft acellular dermal matrix membrane cover bone graft . The membrane patient receive randomly assign use coin toss : head assign test group tail assign control . The objective determine 4 month width height jaw bone also soft tissue thickness tooth extract increase , decrease remain . Also amount patient newly form bone determine microscopic examination core jaw bone obtain site implant placement immediately implant place ( implant consider part study ) .</detailed_description>
