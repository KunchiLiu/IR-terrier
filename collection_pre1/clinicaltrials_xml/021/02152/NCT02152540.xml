	<brief_summary>This project study 40 Veterans identify symptom understood characterize mild moderate Traumatic Brain Injury ( TBI ) include Post Traumatic Stress Disorder ( PTSD ) . Following screen informed consent , Veterans randomly assign treatment repetitive Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation ( rTMS ) sham rTMS ( placebo ) . Additional examination compare brain imaging ( structural functional MRI scan rest ) across participant baseline , acute rTMS treatment , 6 month followup . The VA population differs significantly population include prior trial rTMS many condition depression , chronic pain , PTSD . Many return Operation Enduring Freedom ( OEF ) /Operation Iraqi Freedom ( OIF ) personnel Veterans concussion history report cognitive problem , impaired attention , verbal fluency , poor planning , reduce work memory , mental flexibility . The investigator hope show efficacy durability rTMS treat symptom safely Veterans co-morbidities .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>rTMS Improve Cognitive Function TBI</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The goal present study evaluate efficacy durability benefit repetitive Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation ( rTMS ) promise non-invasive therapeutic treatment executive function deficit report Veterans mild moderate Traumatic Brain Injury ( TBI ) patient . Although much progress make towards understand various deficit follow TBI , progress yet make towards identify assess therapeutic treatment option responsive TBI symptom . Many return OEF/OIF Veterans concussion history report cognitive symptom may last month year , affect every day function . Symptoms face Veterans mild moderate TBI include executive function deficit impair attention ( include shift set ) , verbal fluency , poor planning , reduce work memory , mental flexibility . The primary objective ass efficacy rTMS Veterans mild moderate TBI improve executive functioning . A recent VA study report improvement PTSD relate symptom Veterans PTSD receive rTMS ( Watts et al. , 2012 ) . Repetitive TMS method deliver therapeutic , non-invasive brain stimulation currently use VA Palo Alto Stanford University number clinical trial . For pilot study investigator propose enroll 40 Veterans diagnose mild moderate TBI ( age range 20-65 ) . Inclusion Criteria : mild moderate TBI define : post-traumatic amnesia ( PTA &lt; 1 day mild ; 1 day &gt; x &lt; 7days moderate ) . Because extensively document co-occurrence TBI PTSD , ( Veterans TBI without PTSD enrol ) . PTSD assess use standard clinical measure . Exclusionary criterion : patient screen TMS MRI safety . The duration study two year , 1.5 year enrollment period , final half-year follow-up completion . Following preliminary telephone screen , Veterans schedule onsite inform consent , screening , baseline assessment . Using electronic randomization form , participant enrol two group : active rTMS sham rTMS . As double blind placebo control study , subject ID number provide nurse administrate rTMS treatment . After randomization , rTMS nurse test motor threshold ( MT ) rTMS . Each participant trial total approximately ( 28 ) week : 1-2 week screening , ( 2 ) week acute treatment phase ( include MRI pre post rTMS ) 24 week ( 6 month ) follow-up phase ( MRI , neuropsychological test self-report measure ) . Left Dorsolateral Prefrontal Cortex ( DLPFC ) stimulation site show affective treatment depression approve FDA . All participant receive minimum 20 treatment evaluated change executive function ( primary outcome measure ) . The primary hypothesis Veterans receive active rTMS show improvement sham treat Veterans ( performance baseline last assessment &gt; 1 SD either Trail Making Test part B , Delis-Kaplan Executive Function System [ D-KEFS ] Verbal Fluency and/or D-KEFS Color-Word Interference Test ) . Additional analysis include : Sustained Improvement executive function composite score ; secondary consequence TBI score Quality Life ( QOL ) scale , moderator response age , severity symptom baseline , type comorbidity ( e.g. , PTSD ) ; , functional brain activity change rTMS treatment . This pilot study one first demonstrate rTMS treatment executive function deficit Veterans mild moderate TBI . Additionally , would also report efficacy use functional MRI ( fMRI ) biomarker capture improvement executive function .</detailed_description>
