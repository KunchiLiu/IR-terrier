	<brief_summary>The effect radiation normal tissue varies widely individual . Consequently , test measure tissue response radiation could clinically useful permit accurate titration dosage patient undergoing radiotherapy . Also , view emerge concern possible nuclear terrorism test exposure radiation might also useful evaluate victim `` dirty bomb '' explosion . A number different technique previously report epidemiological study estimation prior radiation exposure . This study explore one approach estimate radiation exposure measurement increase oxidative stress detect breath test . In study subject undergo significant exposure therapeutic radiation provide breath sample analysis central laboratory . The hypothesis study analysis sample lead identification set marker radiation exposure .</brief_summary>
