	<brief_summary>This study do evaluate good bad effect BIBF1120 recurrent , platinum-sensitive small cell lung cancer patient see BIBF1120 may may effective well tolerate standard therapy . The purpose study : - Find proportion patient small small cell lung cancer control least 90 day treatment BIBF1120 - Compare response rate , survival side effect BIBF1120 recurrent , platinum-sensitive small cell lung cancer patient - Identify group patient benefit BIBF1120 In study , patient receive BIBF1120 200 mg twice daily continuously . A cycle 21 day . During treatment , dose BIBF1120 hold reduce low dos patient tolerate well doctor concerned side effect BIBF1120 individual patient .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>This study do evaluate effect BIBF1120 recurrent , platinum-sensitive small cell lung cancer patient . Primary Objectives : - To investigate efficacy safety novel VEGFR-2 FGFR-1 targeting agent , BIBF1120 , previously treat , platinum-sensitive small cell lung cancer patient . Secondary Objectives : - To correlate response apoptotic biomarkers , Bcl-XL/Bcl-2 FDGR-1 amplification . - To correlate response baseline FLT-PET SUV uptake change FLT-PET SUV uptake . All eligible patient treat 200 mg bid BIBF1120 daily 21 day consider one cycle</detailed_description>

Definition platinumsensitive disease patient least 3 month progressionfree duration finish firstline platinumbased chemotherapy . Histological diagnosis small cell lung cancer ( include Oat cell carcinoma , small cell neuroendocrine tumor ) . Patients archival tumor sample collect translational study . For archival tumor sample , without due harm , fresh biopsy obtain . As progressionfree survival ( PFS ) PFS rate endpoint , patient enrol must measurable ( per RECIST 1.1 Criteria ) radiological progression disease radiological investigation . ECOG performance status 02 Adequate hematological function define hemoglobin &gt; 90 g/L , ANC &gt; 1500/uL platelet &gt; 100 , 000/uL .

INR/PTT &lt; 1.5 x ULN Left ventricular function echocardiogram &gt; institutional low limit normal . Women childbearing potential must use adequate birth control . A serum pregnancy test must perform within 72 hour enrollment eligible woman childbearing potential . The absence significant psychiatric medical condition potentially affect compliance therapy adversely affect experimental therapy . Able swallow oral medication . Life expectancy least 12 week . All patient enrol must least one prior platinumbased chemotherapy regimen either limit stag extensive stag set . All patient must blood pressure 150/90 mm Hg less time enrollment . Patients antihypertensives eligible blood pressure le 150/90 mm Hg enrollment increase antihypertensive medication 2 week prior enrollment . Signed date write informed consent prior enrollment study accordance ICHGCP guideline local legislation . Symptomatic , untreated brain metastasis . Patients asymptomatic brain metastasis define CNS symptom , concurrent significant edema CT MRI brain concurrent corticosteroid therapy eligible . Those leptomeningeal disease NEVER eligible due overall poor prognosis . Patients treat brain metastasis without concurrent corticosteroid anticonvulsant therapy without progression CT MRI scan brain least 60 day eligible Symptoms congestive heart failure , myocardial infarction angina within 6 month .

Persistence clinically relevant therapyrelated toxicity previous chemotherapy and/or radiotherapy . Leptomeningeal disease . Radiographic evidence cavitary necrotic tumor . Centrally locate tumor radiographic evidence ( CT MRI ) local invasion major blood vessel . As small cell lung cancer often present mediastinal mass , compression mediastinal blood vessel allow .
