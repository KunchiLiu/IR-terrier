	<brief_summary>This randomized phase II/III trial study well temozolomide veliparib work compare temozolomide alone treat patient newly diagnose glioblastoma multiforme . Drugs use chemotherapy , temozolomide , work different way stop growth tumor cell , either kill cell , stop dividing , stop spread . Veliparib may stop growth tumor cell block enzymes need cell growth . It yet know whether temozolomide effective without veliparib treat glioblastoma multiforme .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Temozolomide With Without Veliparib Treating Patients With Newly Diagnosed Glioblastoma Multiforme</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . Test whether experimental combination ABT-888 ( veliparib ) combine TMZ ( temozolomide ) , compare control placebo combine TMZ , significantly extend overall survival newly diagnose glioblastoma multiforme ( GBM ) patient tumor O-6-methylguanine-deoxyribonucleic acid ( DNA ) MGMT promoter hypermethylation . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . Test whether experimental treatment significantly extend progression-free survival . II . Test whether experimental treatment improve objective tumor response . III . Test whether experimental treatment associate significantly great rate grade 3 high adverse event . TERTIARY OBJECTIVES : I . Evaluate utility dynamic susceptibility contrast ( DSC ) diffusion weight imaging ( DWI ) magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) techniques define time progression set large multi-institutional clinical trial . II . Test concordance site-determined MGMT methylation status central laboratory determination MGMT status case local test . III . Evaluate whether genetic epigenetic alteration deoxyribonucleic acid ( DNA ) repair replication gene associate overall survival , progression-free survival , objective tumor response . IV . Test whether polymorphism MGMT , PARP1 , DNA repair protein , associate overall survival , progression-free survival , objective tumor response , rate grade 3 high adverse event . OUTLINE : Patients randomize 1 2 treatment arm . ARM I : Patients receive temozolomide orally ( PO ) daily ( QD ) day 1-5 veliparib PO twice daily ( BID ) day 1-7 . Treatment repeat every 28 day 6 course absence disease progression ( confirmed progression ) unacceptable toxicity . ARM II : Patients receive temozolomide Arm I placebo PO BID day 1-7 . Treatment repeat every 28 day 6 course absence disease progression ( confirmed progression ) unacceptable toxicity . After completion study treatment , patient follow every 3 month 3 year , every 6 month 2 year .</detailed_description>
