	<brief_summary>The goal research study compare effect treatment base molecular profile standard-of-care . Treatment Assignment : From tumor biopsy , molecular profile disease establish . Based genetic profiling , follow intervention follow : A ) If abnormality , patient treat accord patient 's doctor best interest . B ) If abnormality FDA-approved drug tumor type , patient offer treatment . C ) If abnormality FDA-approved drug abnormality tumor type , patient randomly assign Arm A ( target therapy ) Arm B ( standard-of-care therapy ) .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Patients whose tumor progress protocol-assigned treatment achieve primary study endpoint option cross treatment arm . Imaging study repeat every 2 cycle initiation treatment randomize arm .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>1 . Patients metastatic cancer . 2 . Patients may receive unlimited line prior therapy . 3 . Prior randomization , patient metastatic disease must treat establish standardofcare therapy , physician determine establish therapy sufficiently efficacious , patient decline receive standardofcare therapy . 4 . The patient measurable disease . 5 . The patient Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group ( ECOG ) performance status 01 . 6 . The patient biopsyaccessible tumor . For patient prior anticancer therapy surgical resection within year tumor tissue immediately available , tumor analyze biopsy need . 7 . The patient normal organ marrow function , define absolute neutrophil count &gt; /= 1,000/µl ; platelet &gt; /=100,000/µl ( unless abnormality due bone marrow involvement ) . 8 . The patient adequate hepatic function define total bilirubin level &lt; /=1.5 x upper limit normal ( ULN ) , unless patient know Gilbert 's disease , alanine aminotransferase ( ALT ) / serum glutamic pyruvic transaminase level ( SGPT ) &lt; /= 2.5 X ULN ( unless patient liver metastasis ) . 9 . The patient serum creatinine clearance &gt; /= 50 ml/min CockcroftGault formula . 10 . If patient brain metastasis , must stable ( treated and/or asymptomatic ) patient must steroids least 2 week . 11 . The patient &gt; /=18 year age . 12 . The patient provide sign informed consent . 13 . Patients previous malignancy ( patient ' know cancer ) treat successfully diseasefree least 3 year allow . 14 . Patients history basal cell carcinoma skin preinvasive carcinoma cervix eligible . 15 . Women childbearing potential must agree use adequate contraception ( hormonal barrier method birth control ; abstinence ) prior study entry duration study participation . Childbearing potential defined woman menses within past 12 month tubal ligation , hysterectomy , bilateral oophorectomy . Should woman become pregnant suspect pregnant participating study , inform treat physician immediately . 16 . Male subject must agree use effective contraception abstinence study 90 day last dose study drug . 1 . Patients randomize control arm must receive therapy base prior molecular profiling . 2 . The patient receive chemotherapy , surgery , radiotherapy ( therapeutic purpose ) within 3 week initiate study treatment ( 4 week bevacizumab investigational drug ) patient recover ( grade ≥2 side effect previous therapy ) . Patients receive palliative radiation therapy treat immediately completion radiation therapy . 3 . The patient cardiac condition follow : uncontrolled hypertension ( BP &gt; 160/100 ) despite optimal therapy , uncontrolled angina , ventricular arrhythmia , congestive heart failure ( New York Heart Association Class II ) , prior current cardiomyopathy , atrial fibrillation heart rate &gt; 100 bpm , unstable ischaemic heart disease ( MI within 6 month prior start treatment angina require use nitrate weekly ) . 4 . The patient peripheral neuropathy &gt; /= grade 2 . 5 . The patient pregnant ( confirm serum bHCG , applicable ) breastfeeding . 6 . The patient concurrent severe and/or uncontrolled medical disease could compromise participation study ( i.e. , uncontrolled diabetes , severe infection require active treatment , severe malnutrition , chronic severe liver renal disease ) . 7 . The patient refractory nausea vomit chronic gastrointestinal disease ( e.g. , inflammatory bowel disease ) significant bowel resection would preclude adequate absorption ( oral therapy ) . 8 . The patient unable swallow capsule and/or surgical anatomical condition precludes swallow absorb oral medication ongoing basis ( oral therapy ) . 9 . Any condition would , investigator 's judgment , contraindicate patient 's participation clinical study due safety concern compliance clinical study procedure .</criteria>
