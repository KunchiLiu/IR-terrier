	<brief_title>Intrauterine Cleaning After Placental Delivery Cesarean Section : RCT</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Background Caesarean section common major surgical procedure perform obstetric practice . The American College Obstetricians Gynecologists ( ACOG ) estimate 2011 alone , one three woman give birth United States cesarean delivery . Compared vaginal birth , increase rate caesarean birth worldwide well know cause maternal morbidity , include hemorrhage , anesthetic complication , shock , cardiac arrest , acute renal failure , assist ventilation , venous thromboembolism increase risk major postpartum infection . With increase cesarean section rate associated complication , obstetrician challenge reduce perioperative postoperative morbidity adapt surgical skill technique . Over year , randomize clinical trial try answer many question surround safety several cesarean section technique impart maternal morbidity . For example , optimal type cesarean section skin incision , whether create bladder flap , one layer versus two late closure uterus , irrigate abdominal cavity , closure versus non closure parietal peritoneum , suture versus staple skin closure cesarean section . Cleaning uterine cavity follow cesarean section routine practice many obstetrician . To ensure entire placenta membrane remove delivery placenta cesarean , uterine cavity usually clean one hand hold dry sponge remove remain membrane placental tissue , hand place fundus stabilize uterus . However , despite lack evidence support policy routine intrauterine clean placental delivery cesarean section , benefit intrauterine clean routine practice cesarean section remain uncertain . Obstetricians routinely clean uterine cavity placental delivery argue procedure perform routinely vaginal delivery , thus justification cesarean sections.. To date , study , include randomized clinical trial answer important question , hence importance trial . Objective : The goal study employ well design randomize control clinical trial compare efficacy clean versus clean uterine cavity placental delivery cesarean section . We hypothesize omission intrauterine clean cesarean delivery increase intraoperative postoperative complication Our primary outcome measure endomyometritis delivery . Endomyometritis diagnose presence two following : abnormally tender uterus examination , temperature 38.0Â°C time postoperatively , unexplained maternal tachycardia 100 beat per minute ( bpm ) . A diagnosis endomyometritis criterion initiate treatment antibiotic . Secondary outcome include post partum hemorrhage , mean surgical time , retain product conception , retain placenta , quantitative blood loss , length hospital stay , return gastrointestinal function , repeat surgery , hospital readmission rate Potential Contribution : This study may show optimal method deal uterine cavity placental delivery . The result may show long run whether routine cleaning uterine cavity follow placental delivery beneficial . METHODS : Timeline : Once study approve plan recruit patient 18 month . Once recruitment period complete perform data collection analysis two month . We estimate end date 3-4 month recruitment complete . Recruitment : All eligible patient cesarean section Sparrow hospital/Michigan State University OBGYN resident Clinic OBGYN patient Sparrow Perinatal Center evaluate study inclusion . All patient meet study 's inclusion criterion lack exclusion criterion approach consent enrollment . Patients give consent form review home prior admission cesarean section . For unscheduled patient , consent seek follow physician 's decision proceed cesarean section . Patients adequate time consider enrollment discus option physician prior cesarean section . All eligible patient present labor delivery cesarean section examine upon presentation . After inclusion criterion meet , patient approach consent participate study . Patients give study information consent form review . Consent document patient 's signature indicate understanding agreement participate study . Procedures : Patients admit cesarean section meeting inclusion criterion approach consent . Consented patient randomize two group . Group 1 : ( Cleaning uterine cavity ) : These participant uterine cavity clean dry laparotomy sponge delivery placenta . Per standard protocol , uterus explore one hand hold sponge remove remain membrane placental tissue , hand place fundus stabilize uterus . Group 2 : ( Not clean uterine cavity ) : These participant uterine cavity leave alone complete delivery placenta . The placenta inspect delivery make sure complete , include membrane . Assignment perform open sequentially number opaque envelope contain computer-randomized individual allocation . The envelope open circulation nurse operate room silently view surgeon prior surgery . Instructions give verbalize treatment arm reveal . The original randomization perform research staff initiation study use random number table generator , participant blind treatment assign . Information regard basic demographic data , intervention cesarean delivery postpartum course obtain participant 's chart discharge hospital . The protocol labor management group ( labor patient ) , include continuous electronic fetal monitoring external Doppler device . Per standard operative management Sparrow Hospital/Michigan State University , group undergo inspection uterine incision , without closure vesicouterine peritoneum ( bladder flap ) , abdominal peritoneum , rectus muscle per attend preference . Both group undergo standard closure abdominal fascia , consist suture run non lock delay absorbable suture . Irrigation subcutaneous tissue superior close fascia perform group . Staples absorbable suture use skin closure . In addition , participant receive standardize dose 1-2 g cefazolin intravenously antibiotic prophylaxis start surgery . Participants cefazolin allergy receive 900 mg clindamycin . Informed Consent : All eligible patient undergo cesarean delivery Sparrow hospital give study information consent form review . Consent document patient 's signature indicate understanding agreement participate study . Sources Materials : Data abstract participant 's chart include demographic information ( age , race , socioeconomic status ) , obstetric characteristic ( parity , gestational age , indication cesarean section , membrane status time cesarean section , post operative complication list ) . To protect patient confidentiality , individual directly involve study access identifiable private patient information . Data Security : Patient confidentiality protect make sure individual involve study access identifiable patient information . Collected information cod stripped identifier . Statistical analysis : Analysis base intention-to-treat . A Cox proportional hazard model use estimate hazard ratios two group adjust confounders . The proportional hazard assumption check graphically plot log-log survival probability confirm use Schoenfeld residual . Comparison continuous variable do independent t-test categorical variable compare chi-squared test Fisher exact test appropriate . Interval data non- parametric test analyzed Mann-Whitney U test . The 95 % confidence interval ( CIs ) report throughout . A significance level 0.05 use significance test necessary . Logistic regression use analyze potential confounding analysis primary outcome . The predetermined analysis include model variable appear randomly distribute randomization , well variable think potential confounders clinically . Analyses perform use STATA version 13.0 ( Stata Corp , College Station , TX ) . Sample Size estimation : After review literature , consider 20 % reduction group clinically significant . We use 20 % difference type 1 error rate 0.05 power 0.90 two sided test . This require randomization 206 woman ( 103 patient group ) obtain adequate sample size . Assessment Risks benefit Subject Characteristics : Pregnant woman singleton multiple pregnancy , vertex breech presentation intact membrane present labor delivery unit elective cesarean section eligible participation . We anticipate enrol minimum 206 patient . Women exclude follow criterion encounter : preterm premature rupture membrane , spontaneous rupture membrane prior cesarean section , chorioamnionitis , fetal demise , uncontrolled diabetes immunosuppressive disorder . The involvement pregnant woman study , vulnerable population , inevitable since cesarean section procedure perform patient population . The study restrict Sparrow Hospital/Michigan State University . Benefits : The study design provide direct benefit research participant . However , hypothesis true , participant study group may enjoy benefit . Since anticipated risk participant minimal , risks subject reasonable relation anticipate benefit . The knowledge gain study potential significantly impact obstetrical clinical practice . It provide evidence use decision make option present woman cesarean section . The result , hypothesis true , contribute long term goal provide safe efficacious option cesarean section , reduce morbidity , cost health care length hospital stay . Potential Risks : Just like cesarean section , patient risk hemorrhage , chorioamnionitis , anesthetic complication , hemorrhagic shock , cardiac arrest , acute renal failure , assist ventilation , venous thromboembolism post operative infection . In study , even though clean uterine cavity , ensure placenta membrane remove entirety . Protection Risks : Major risk beyond incurred standard medical care anticipate protocol . Cesarean section common procedure obstetrical practice . Not clean uterine cavity cesarean section standard care attending Sparrow . Safety monitor investigator . In case adverse event , submit Human research Protection Office ( HRPO ) Sparrow per standard HRPO reporting guideline . Data Safety Monitoring Plan : Although risk study participant expect minimal great associate routine cesarean section , number measure plan ensure patient safety . Monitoring involve principal investigator monitor , document , report Institutional Review Board , adverse event among study participant . Data Safety Monitoring - Dr Maude Guerin serve consultant research study . She task ensure overall safety subject enrol study . She responsible interpret result interim analysis making decision include stopping study . Interim analysis- Interim efficacy analysis conduct endometritis primary outcome interest . Analyses perform study statistician present DSMB . The board make recommendation regard conduct study . The principal investigator inform result interim analysis unless DSMB determines level unblinding necessary make final decision conduct study . Possible decision include stop study efficacy achieve futility , modify sample size .</detailed_description>
