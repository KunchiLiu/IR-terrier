	<brief_summary>This propose study aim compare effect unilateral bilateral transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation ( TENS ) . It compare effectiveness bilateral TENS + task-oriented training ( TOT ) unilateral TENS+TOTin improve muscle strength , co-ordination , dynamic stand balance , walk performance , functional mobility patient chronic stroke . The null hypothesis bilateral TENS+TOT unilateral TENS+TOT significantly different promote recovery function .</brief_summary>
