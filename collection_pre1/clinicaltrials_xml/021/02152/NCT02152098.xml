	<brief_summary>Firstly , investigator aim study biochemical , structural functional change associate acute muscle strain injury acute phase rehabilitation vivo . Specific factor present injury effect connective tissue cell examine vitro . Secondly , investigator investigate individual chronic pain , scar tissue inferior function previous muscle strain injury test specific rehabilitation program alleviate pain disability associate precede muscle injury . The investigator follow hypothesis : 1 . Humoral growth factor pro-inflammatory macrophage release injured area post strain injury stimulate formation connective tissue vitro . 2 . Early onset rehabilitation superior delay start rehabilitation heal process , regard structural improvement tissue well clinical function . 3 . Scar tissue follow muscle strain injury characterize disorganized structure connective tissue . 4 . Mechanical load form heavy eccentric muscle activity 12 week lead local re-modeling scar tissue , result improve function reduce symptoms patient chronic pain impaired function previous muscle injury .</brief_summary>
