	<brief_summary>Non-invasive brain stimulation therapy increasingly investigate recent year treatment neuropsychiatric disorder , particularly mood disorder . They particularly appeal since many patient either refractory present side effect standard pharmacological regimen . TDCS ( transcranial direct current stimulation ) . novel non- pharmacological brain stimulation technique , might help overcome issue , since low cost , high portability relatively easy use . TDCS consist apply weak , direct current two electrode place scalp ; anode cathode increase decrease cortical excitability beyond period stimulation . It also safe technique mild adverse effect describe . Previous study , group , describe tDCS effective technique major depression . However , role tDCS treatment bipolar depression ( BD ) insufficiently investigate . Therefore , aim address antidepressant effect tDCS BD randomize , sham- control trial refractory sample .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Transcranial Direct Current Stimulation Treatment Bipolar Depression</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>BD represent great burden patient bipolar disorder , since depressive episode frequent also particularly associate suicide 7 . BD treatment controversial , strict guideline recommend lithium , lamotrigine quetiapine first-treatment , whereas others allow use antidepressant ( increase manic switch use association mood stabilizer ) anticonvulsant antipsychotic 8 . For refractory BD available level I evidence scarce , seven study explore issue hitherto 9 . Therefore , importance study proposal justify consider burden disease , paucity current therapeutic study promise result present tDCS unipolar disorder .</detailed_description>
