	<detailed_description>Retinopathy prematurity ( ROP ) major cause blindness world . It vasoproliferative retinopathy affect premature low birth-weight infant . Initial ocular examination infant risk ROP generally conduct 4-6 week postnatally . These exam vital protect preterm infant blindness , exams show cause pain population . Only two study allude impact eyelid speculum pain response score . Specifically , Hered Gyland , question whether Alfonso , spring load , eyelid lid speculum due forceful opening eyelid cause pain . However , study find include type eyelid speculum variable study . In addition , study compare effect different eyelid speculum pain response . Currently two speculum utilize ; spring load Alfonso screw loaded Cook eyelid speculum . There schedule receives speculum exam . The investigator team recognize insertion eyelid speculum cause pain response infant would like determine difference level response two speculum . The investigator study test difference pain response use either spring load eyelid speculum screw load speculum ROP exam premature infant . The objective study evaluate pain response neonatal population , 32 week less , less equal 1500 gram , undergo retractor eye exam retinopathy prematurity ( ROP ) screening . The primary study aim compare N-PASS pain score neonate receive ROP eye exam spring load Alfonso screw load Cook eye speculum .</detailed_description>
