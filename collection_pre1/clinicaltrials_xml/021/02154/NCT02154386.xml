	<brief_summary>Bone graft follow tooth extraction commonly perform preserve bony ridge dimension adequate support subsequent implant placement . Alveolar ridge resorption commonly occur follow tooth extraction , decrease bone volume potential make dental implant therapy impossible without surgery reconstruct ridge . The aim ridge preservation graft prevent minimize resorptive process , thereby preserve adequate volume bone implant placement . Ridge preservation generally involve placement particulate bone graft material tooth socket , follow use membrane similar substance socket entrance contain bone graft . Various graft material recommend ridge preservation procedure , include demineralize freeze-dried bone allograft ( DFDBA ) . The timing dental implant placement follow ridge preservation procedures controversial , study examine effect different heal time interval ridge preservation implant placement . The purpose project evaluate formation new bone site tooth extraction perform follow graft use DFDBA . Two different study group include , one dental implant place 8-10 week tooth extraction ridge grafting , dental implant place 18-20 week extraction grafting .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Effect Healing Time New Bone Formation Following Tooth Extraction Ridge Preservation With Demineralized Freeze-Dried Bone Allograft</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The purpose study compare heal follow tooth extraction ridge preservation DFDBA healing time point 8-10 week treatment compare healing time point 18-20 week treatment . There study determine difference new bone formation use DFDBA purpose various heal time point post-grafting . The primary objective histologically determine amount new bone formation residual graft material present two healing time point graft DFDBA . Histologic heal compare base three criterion : % new vital bone formation , % residual graft material , % nonmineralized connective tissue/bone marrow . The null hypothesis difference % new bone formation 8-10 week graft compare 18-20 week graft . This entire protocol involve procedure standard care . There two subject group study . All subject require extraction non-molar tooth , follow replacement miss tooth dental implant . In order ensure bone core remove implant osteotomy preparation take totally within confines former tooth socket , tooth extract position angulation implant replace tooth . Each group 22 subject . Only one tooth evaluate give subject . Both group consist subject cortical DFDBA graft extraction socket ridge preservation follow tooth extraction . Group 1 biopsy core take time implant placement 8-10 week socket graft . Group 2 biopsy core take time implant placement 18-20 week socket graft . Allocation subject group 1 2 base randomization enrol study . Subjects ask draw seal envelope stack envelope , contain single slip paper cod # 1 # 2 . This determine treatment group . All bone graft material use study come donor ( LifeNet Health ) . The material procure processed manner particle size percent residual calcium . This greatly decrease potential variability inherent bone take different donor process different manner . At time subject enrollment , follow standard care procedure perform : Impressions make fabrication diagnostic cast radiographs take tooth extract . A clear measurement stent make cast vertical horizontal ridge dimension . Following local anesthesia , tooth extract , number bony wall socket record , along presence bony dehiscence fenestration . After extraction , measurement stent place hole make occlusal surface directly buccal bony wall lingual bony wall . Holes make buccal lingual flange measurement stent level approximately 3mm bony crest ridge caliper use make horizontal ridge width measurement . These measurement record . The socket thoroughly debrided , 1.0cc bottle cortical DFDBA hydrate sterile saline DFDBA place socket restore ridge appropriate contour . A collagen barrier ( Collatape Collaplug ) place socket orifice secure suture . Flaps reflect obtain primary closure . If large dehiscence exists follow extraction , would likely affect facial socket wall , collagen barrier long resorption time , Zimmer collagen socket repair membrane BioGide collagen membrane use instead Collatape Collaplug . As part standard care , patient prescribe systemic doxycycline 100mg twice day 7 day surgery ( patient sensitivity doxycycline , alternate amoxicillin 500mg three time day 7 day ) . The patient see 7-10 day extraction/ridge preservation ass healing , 1 month procedure . The implant place 8-10 week ridge preservation Group 1 18-20 week ridge preservation Group 2 . At time implant placement , first osteotomy prepare use hollow trephine drill instead solid drill . Use hollow trephine allow retention bony core ; whereas , use solid drill result removal bone small particle examine histologically . Drilling pilot implant osteotomy historically do way ( trephine drill solid drill ) . The bone core trephine remove trephine , place 10 % formalin , prepare histologic examination . The study end immediately removal trephine bone core . Following initial preparation implant site trephine , osteotomy complete implant appropriate length diameter place . The size implant engage newly form bone socket , least 2-3mm bone apical former socket site . A healing abutment place . All subject examine 7-10 day 1 month follow implant placement . The patient refer restorative dentist final restoration . The histologic core process demineralized section stain . The following histologic parameter measure : percent new bone formation , percent residual graft material , percent connective tissue/other .</detailed_description>
