	<brief_summary>The purpose propose research explore relationship objectively measure physical activity surgical intervention lumbar spinal stenosis ( LSS ) . Our primary hypothesis post-surgery , LSS patient demonstrate increased physical activity compare baseline assessment . A non-intervention control group measure time interval surgical group look test re-test reliability . In event hypothesis reject , surgery lead decrease sedentary behaviour analysis questionnaire-based sedentary behaviour measure objective activity-based measurement examine relationship self-report actual performance-based objective measure . The primary objective proposal determine surgical intervention lead increase activity , decrease sedentary behaviour . The finding propose research inform healthcare stakeholder surgery alone lead increased activity , concert research effort may need make post-surgical rehabilitation , lifestyle physical activity counsel post-surgical patient may make change toward lead active productive life .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Apparatus : Activity Monitors : The ActiGraph GT3X+ monitor ( ActiGraph , Pensacola , FL ) show reliable good validity laboratory free living condition . It one widely respect monitor use measure physical activity sedentary behaviour currently use intervention trial patient LSS . The GT3X+ monitor include triaxial accelerometer , inclinometer light sensor . It capable measure activity count , step , position relative gravity discriminate day night . This accelerometer base sensor system impede normal movement worn throughout day waistband , virtually environment , except water . The wGT3X+ activity monitor capacity collect data 100Hz . Procedure : Each participant give ActiGraph wGT3X+ activity monitor instruction wear monitor waking hour 7 consecutive day except bathing , shower swimming . Each ActiGraph monitor fasten belt anterior axillary line right hip per manufacturer 's recommendation initialize collect data 1 epoch . They also ask complete log sheet record time put monitor take day . Participants complete 2 separate 7-day bout , six week apart . For surgical group ActiGraph use week lead surgical intervention . The follow-up occur 6-weeks post surgery . For intervention group ActiGraph use week immediately determine surgical candidate , follow-up occur 6-weeks later surgical waitlist . Pre-Surgery test : They receive device pre-surgical assessment complete baseline questionnaire , return device upon presentation schedule surgery . Post-Surgery test : When patient present 6-week post surgical follow-up receive device , complete questionnaire form , give device postage-paid Express Post envelope return monitor researcher do . Upon arrival device , participant compensation issue . Pre-No Intervention test : Immediately follow assessment visit determine patient surgical candidate receive device complete baseline questionnaire . In addition , patient give postage-paid Express Post envelope return monitor researcher do . Post-No Intervention test : Six week later , patient ask report laboratory receive device , complete questionnaire form , give device postage-paid Express Post envelope return monitor researcher do . Upon arrival device , participant compensation issue . Statistical Analysis : To identify possible explanatory variable , multiple regression use determine relationship physical activity sedentary behaviour data ( e.g. , number minute sedentary , light , moderate physical activity/day , maximum number consecutive minute 100 activity counts/ min , maximum sedentary bout length ) demographic factor age , duration diagnosis , body mass index , pain rating . Separate pair student 's t-tests use compare participant term baseline follow-up questionnaire score . Separate unpaired student 's t-tests compare questionnaire base outcome measure score group pre post intervention . Repeated measure analysis variance use compare pre- post-intervention measurement physical activity sedentary behaviour within group . Specifically , ActiGraph record measure separate 2 Group ( Surgery , NI ) x 2 Time ( pre , post ) analysis variance ( ANOVA ) design employ . Post-hoc analysis perform effect involve two mean , need , use Tukey 's Honestly Significant Difference ( HSD ) . To compare agreement self-report measure direct activity monitor data , intra-class correlation ( ICC ) two-way mixed model use . Adverse Events/Serious Adverse Events : While study include clinical intervention outcome measure interest pre- post-surgery would predict yield adverse event . The surgical procedure use consider part experimental design . The clinical intervention study routine surgical procedure take patient require surgery degenerative lumbar spinal stenosis . If patient enrol study would equal risk adverse event result clinical intervention . Planned Dissemination : The result study prepared dissemination first relevant clinical scientific conference . Subsequently , work submit peer-reviewed journal consideration publication . Additional Ethical Aspects Protocol : Potential Benefits Participants Others : The potential benefit participation participant include receive $ 10 parking reimbursement , two occasion , online gift card $ 40 grocery store . There direct benefit participate study . Indirect benefit include knowledge contribute advancement scientific understanding relationship physical activity pre post-surgical intervention . There direct benefit others . Indirect benefit include scientific community plan dissemination work . The result study prepared dissemination first relevant clinical scientific conference . Subsequently , work submit peer review journal consideration publication . Potential harm Participants Others : There anticipate potential harm participant regard outcome measure completion . In regard surgical intervention risk potential harm equal patient surgery outside research study . All patient recruit study would otherwise receive surgery even enrol study . To protect participant privacy data collect cod put database format . All data de-identified keep single study computer site password protect locate locked office . As , access study subject information/data highly safeguard accessed Dr. Passmore . Any paper form questionnaires kept locked cabinet lock room . Identifying information collect subject 's name , contact information date birth .</detailed_description>
