	<brief_summary>The purpose study see whether altered schedule give erlotinib combination gemcitabine safe might improve result treatment advanced cancer pancreas . Gemcitabine erlotinib commercially available . Gemcitabine FDA approve first-line treatment patient locally advance , unresectable metastatic cancer pancreas . Erlotinib FDA approve combination gemcitabine first-line treatment patient locally advance , unresectable metastatic pancreatic cancer . The FDA recommend dose erlotinib 100 mg daily . This study investigate experimental administration high dose erlotinib give three day twice month , schedule call `` pulse dosing '' .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Gemcitabine Pulse Dose Erlotinib Second Line Treatment Advanced Pancreatic Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Survival pancreatic cancer patient remain poor , treatment erlotinib remain one agent demonstrate increased survival . Alternative dosing schedule erlotinib explore since chronic low dose therapy fail achieve therapeutically effective concentration many patient lead increase skin toxicity may induce acquire resistance without significantly impact tumor . Therefore , high dos give short period exposure , similar dose chemotherapeutic agent , may achieve effective therapeutic dos chronic low dose therapy may minimize skin toxicity observe erlotinib . No phase I study do combination high dose pulse erlotinib therapy gemcitabine . We propose phase I dose escalation study three day oral dose erlotinib standard dose ( 1000 mg/m2 ) gemcitabine . The start dose erlotinib 750 mg , approximately 50 % dose find safe previous combination study carboplatin paclitaxel pemetrexed [ Riely et al . 2009 , Davies et al . 2009 ] . Since acquire resistance occur rapidly 5 7 day treatment well 3 day treatment , focus 3 day high-dose pulse treatment give every 14 day . This provide 11 day erlotinib dose recovery normal tissue . Levels serum erlotinib also monitor due considerable interpatient variability metabolism erlotinib . The hypothesis study : - High-dose pulse therapy erlotinib safely administer standard dose gemcitabine . - High-dose pulse therapy erlotinib permit recovery epidermis treatment result reduced skin toxicity compare chronic daily dosing . - Disease control high-dose pulse therapy may superior chronic low dose therapy .</detailed_description>
