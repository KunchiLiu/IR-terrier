	<brief_summary>Inflammatory periodontal disease often result loss bone around teeth . Bone defect certain size shape ( call intrabony intraosseous defect ) may improve use graft material bony defect . The purpose study compare heal periodontal intrabony defect treat use demineralize freeze dry bone allograft ( DFDBA ) versus autogenous platelet-rich fibrin . The null hypothesis significant difference bone fill , CAL gain , PD reduction recession site treat PRF compare site treat DFDBA .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Clinical Radiographic Evaluation Demineralized Freeze-Dried Bone Allograft Versus Platelet Rich Fibrin Treatment Periodontal Intrabony Defects Humans</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This entire protocol involve procedure standard care . The purpose research evaluate whether difference result periodontal surgical treatment use PRF intrabony defect versus use DFDBA intrabony defect . The DFDBA use study approve product use approved manner . The PRF use study autologous product derive patient 's blood also use approve manner study . The primary outcome evaluate study include soft tissue parameter gain clinical attachment level ( CAL ) hard tissue parameter bone fill ( BF ) . Secondary outcome evaluate include soft tissue parameter probe depth ( PD ) reduction change gingival recession ( GR ) . These parameter evaluate 6-month period follow intraoperative application material advance periodontal defect 44 subject ( 22 subject per group expect completion 15 subject per group ) . Six month surgery , final post-operative clinical radiographic measurement make . Each subject randomly assign ( 1:1 ) receive either flap surgery autologous platelet-rich fibrin ( PRF ) place intrabony defect ( test ) flap surgery demineralize freeze-dried bone allograft ( DFDBA ) place intrabony defect ( control ) . Subjects randomize draw seal envelope stack envelope , contain slip paper write PRF DFDBA . The number envelop per group equal total number subject enrol per group . Because collection processing PRF require specific equipment , subject randomize prior surgical procedure perform ( delivery local anesthesia ) rather flap reflection debridement . Each subject contribute 1 study site . If subject one interproximal bony defect area treat surgically , 1 site choose study site . The site deep CEJ-BD measurement choose . All nonstudy site surgical area treat material adjacent study site ( PRF DFDBA ) . Clinical measurement time surgery 6-month follow-up make one two examiner mask study group . The clinical examiner make measurement time surgery also make measurement 6-month follow-up . Patients give post-operative antibiotic 7 day surgery part standard care ( amoxicillin 500mg three time day 7 day ; allergic amoxicillin , patient receive doxycycline 100mg twice day 7 day ) . Subjects see 10-14 day surgery routine follow-up procedure include removal suture removal visible plaque . Subjects follow routine postoperative procedure 1 month , 2 month , 4 month surgery . The final postoperative visit take place 6 month post-surgery include final radiographic clinical assessment study site . The study 6-month follow-up visit . Routine radiograph make standard care procedures pre-operatively 6-month follow-up time point . Radiographs standardize use Rinn XCP holder customize bite registration , 1mm radiopaque square grid ( Fixott-Everett grid ) place digital sensor plate allow ease linear measurement digital radiographic image . Radiographic measurement make mask examiner . Hard tissue measurement make radiographs baseline 6-month follow-up include CEJ base bony defect ( CEJ-BD ) .Measurements make near 0.5mm.Bone fill linear change ( mm ) CEJ-BD measurement baseline examination 6-month follow-up . Soft tissue measurement make baseline 6-month follow-up include probe depth ( PD = gingival margin base soft tissue pocket ) , clinical attachment level ( CAL = CEJ base soft tissue pocket ) , gingival recession ( GR = CEJ gingival margin ) defect site . North Carolina 15mm ( UNC-15 ) periodontal probe use measurement round near 0.5mm . Intraoperatively , bony defect measure CEJ-BD near 0.5mm . This measurement make facial lingual aspect interproximal defect ( i.e. , depth interproximal bony defect measure facial lingual aspect deep depth ) . In addition , number bony wall characterize one 7 category : 1 ) 1-wall , 2 ) 2-wall , 3 ) 3-wall , 4 ) combination 1,2-wall defect , 5 ) combination 1,3-wall defect , 6 ) combination 2,3-wall , 7 ) circumferential defect . At 6-month follow-up , clinical evaluation bone fill make use transgingival probe periodontal pocket CEJ bony crest . This measurement also make facial lingual aspect interproximal defect . This standard care procedure do use topical anesthetic . Surgical re-entry performed . For final analysis , defect characterize location deep CEJ-BD measurement time surgery . For example , treat defect distal aspect tooth # 19 CEJ-BD measurement 8.5mm facial aspect 7.5mm lingual time surgery , change soft tissue parameter ( CAL , PD , recession ) hard tissue parameter ( bone fill ) defect determine use PD , CAL , recession bone fill measurement take facial aspect ( rather use mean facial lingual measurement characterize defect ) .</detailed_description>
