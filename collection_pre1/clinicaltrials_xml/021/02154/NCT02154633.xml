	<brief_summary>Mutations BRCA1/2 gene primary cause hereditary breast/ovarian cancer syndrome . Genetic test identifies mutation carrier enable manage cancer risk ( i.e . chemoprevention , risk-reducing surgery , intensive surveillance ) . However , uptake genetic testing among at-risk individual low , imply information disease genetic testing communicate effectively among family member . Mutation carrier distress disclose test result , relative understand implication positive test result health . Thus , intervention support family communication genetic risk , address psychological distress family member could contribute effective management hereditary breast/ovarian cancer . The project aim develop family communication decision-support intervention 1 ) increase family communication BRCA1/2 mutation ; 2 ) reduce psychological distress associate mutation ; 3 ) increase inform decision-making regard uptake BRCA1/2 test among at-risk family member . Focus group mutation carrier at-risk relative inform refinement intervention , well time mode delivery . Two group , pre-post test study new sample mutation carrier family member use test feasibility , acceptability , effect intervention .</brief_summary>
