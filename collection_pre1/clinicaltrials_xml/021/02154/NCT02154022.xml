	<brief_summary>Background : - Certain drug even mean help people cause side effect . These unwanted effect drug . There many reason drug might cause side effect one person another . It may much drug person blood one time . Researchers want study blood people drug side effect well understand happen . Objective : - To obtain blood sample patient treat investigational FDA approve drug National Cancer Institute bad side effect think due large amount drug blood . The sample use ass cause side effect . Eligibility : - People 2 year old cancer currently enrol clinical trial National Cancer Institute . Design : - Participants give blood sample .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Collection Pharmacokinetic Samples From People With Unanticipated Response Toxicity</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Background : - Pharmacology study pharmaceutical compound , encompass several parameter , include body handle substance ( pharmacokinetics , PK ) , substance body molecular level ( pharmacodynamics ) , overall efficacy ( response ) , adverse event toxicity encounter . - The Clinical Pharmacology Program ( CPP ) within Center Cancer Research ( CCR ) National Cancer Institute ( NCI ) sensitive , state art bioanalytical instrumentation accurately precisely quantitate drug concentration plasma . - Currently , CPP analyze sample clinical trial explicit instruction ( within Pharmacokinetics section ) IRB approve protocol . - However , clinical trial protocol without Pharmacokinetics section may still need occasional pharmacokinetic plasma sample draw drug concentration measurement perform help explain unexpected AEs toxicity . Objectives : - To obtain PK plasma sample patient treat investigational agent FDA approve therapy NCI exhibit toxicity believe due high drug concentration order ass cause toxicity adverse event . Eligibility : - Any cancer patient currently enrol IRB approve clinical trial National Cancer Institute eligible . Design : - The CPP measure drug plasma concentration ( send sample third party assay commercially available ) . - The accrual ceiling study 100 patient . The anticipated accrual rate protocol le 10 patient per year , base accrual ceiling , duration accrual total study duration 5 year .</detailed_description>
