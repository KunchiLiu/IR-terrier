	<brief_summary>It well known patient undergone major surgical procedure vulnerable consequence inadequate calorie nutritional intake . Clinical study demonstrate early post-operative feeding increase strength heal intestinal anastomosis , reduce surgical site infection length hospital stay . The 'Enhanced recovery programme ' , ERP , include early post-operative nutrition one key goal , however guidance type food offer patient programme . Anecdotally , many patient healthcare professional believe difference food taste early post-operative patient . If change taste follow surgery affect food choice patient make early post-operative period . No study address question date . In study hope describe affect consider significance change background current hospital food option . We hypothesise food preference taste desire alter early post operative period affect patient eat critical time .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Nutrition vital component good health recovery illness . It particularly clear patient chronic disease undergo major surgical procedure vulnerable consequence inadequate calorie nutritional intake . Over last decade , surgical practice evolve encourage patient resume early enteral feed order avoid post-operative under-nutrition . Inadequate nutrition previously show associated prolongation acute phase response increase incidence septic morbidity . More recently clinical study demonstrate early post-operative feeding increase strength heal intestinal anastomosis . Further also evidence benefit patient reduction surgical site infection complication . Along cost save low complication rate financial benefit reduce mean length hospital stay . Over last 5 year importance non-surgical factor patient recovery development complication highlight . This result development near universal adoption 'Enhanced recovery programme ( ERP ) ' . The ERP multidisciplinary initiative aim improve patient ' journey : - Optimizing pre-operative health status - Reducing postoperative complication surgical physiological stress response change traditional surgical method - Early mobility - Early feeding Post-operative nutrition key component ERP approach , however , many unit run ERP report encouraging early post operative patient increase oral intake difficult . Our experience dysgeusia ( distortion sense taste ) common postoperative group . At present publication literature best support delivery nutrition important group literature food preference patient recently undergone surgery . To date research subject peri-operative taste change outside surgical field directly affect sensory system taste ( Ear , nose throat surgery ) . Although descriptive study calorie intake peri-operative period study perform confirm existence post-operative taste change describe . In order optimise recovery surgery part ERP programme , patient provide food choice encourage great intake . It know optimise early post-operative nutrition contribute early discharge uncomplicated recovery knock benefit inpatient cost . In order provide vital consider issue presume dysgeusia affect food choice . In order begin process follow study propose . It hop result study allow re-evaluation hospital menu optimise post-operative nutrition .</detailed_description>
