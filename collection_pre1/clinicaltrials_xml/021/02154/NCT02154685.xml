	<brief_summary>Smoking occurs approximately 21 % US population , responsible annual mortality rate approximately 438,000 citizen , associate healthcare economic burden $ 167 billion . Although pharmacotherapies improve cessation outcome , vast majority individual make quit attempt relapse within 5-10 day cessation . The hypothesis examine study may potentially important implication smoke cessation treatment , therefore , target single great addiction-related cause morbidity mortality.This study investigate novel behavioral strategy alter important memory process underlie human smoking-related nicotine addiction . This strategy use study employ establish cue exposure procedures putatively update smoking-related memory information suppress respond smoke cue . The goal alter exist nicotine-related memory directly rather rely exclusively establishment inhibitory extinction process , via traditional cue exposure therapy , know vulnerable spontaneous recovery , renewal reinstatement . Positive finding would represent significant advance exposure-based therapy addiction could lead treatment uniquely target problem cue-elicited craving reactivity , thereby address major obstacle successful smoking cessation .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>We propose examine effect two session retrieval-extinction ( R-E ) training smoker make quit attempt . Retrieval initiated brief ( 5-min . ) video smoking-related content extinction consist protract ( 1 hr . ) exposure smoke cue . A control group receive treatment except retrieval video nonsmoking/neutral content serve demonstrate retrieval key feature R-E training . Effects train smoke crave cue reactivity assess 1-day , 2-weeks 4-weeks post-training , whereas training effect indices smoke behavior/cessation preliminarily assess 2-weeks 4-weeks post-training . It expect R-E training result significant enduring reduction crave reactivity novel familiar smoking cue favorable impact smoking . Positive finding study could lead safe effective behavioral intervention help smoker overcome threat cessation pose cue-elicited craving reactivity , thereby reduce burden levy society costly addiction . Additionally , intervention could modify treat addiction substance .</detailed_description>
