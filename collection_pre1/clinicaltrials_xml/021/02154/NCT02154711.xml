	<brief_summary>The purpose study use new research imaging technique , kind magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) , measure important metabolic feature muscle , include mitochondrial function , people mitochondrial disease healthy individual . ( Mitochondria tiny organelle generate energy body . ) It hop new strategy help physician understand good health problem people mitochondrial disease . Eventually , could lead well diagnostic treatment approach .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Magnetic Resonance Imaging ( MRI ) Muscle Phenotyping Mitochondrial Disease</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>There two study-related visit . The first visit `` screening '' visit ensure eligibility . This include fasting blood test . The second visit MRI scanning session . This also take around 2 - 3 hour , 1.5 hour spend actual MRI machine . It may possible complete two visit day . Otherwise , MRI session occur within 3 month screen visit . In addition , optional physical capacity visit occur day MRI session .</detailed_description>
