	<brief_summary>This study three-arm randomize , control trial investigator run 2014 approximately 4,000 user app call Achievemint . AchieveMint reward user point ( redeem prize ) every step take . The investigator test three different point-based program design encourage user build exercise habit course month : stable incentive , increase incentive , decrease incentive . After investigator ' month-long intervention period , investigator observe user ' step count month-long follow-up period test investigator ' habit-building program leave user best exercise habit ( high step count ) conclude . The time frame observation 8 month .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Past research show pay people exercise repeatedly create exercise habit last long cash incentive remove ( Charness Gneezy , 2009 ; Acland Levy , 2013 ) . investigator ' research examine kind incentive program build long-lasting habit effectively . Specifically , investigator compare long-term effect ( base step count one month conclusion investigator ' intervention ) three different intervention : ( 1 ) incentive take step remain stable course month ( stable incentive ) ; ( 2 ) incentive ( equal net value ) take step start low grow large course month ( increase incentive ) ; ( 3 ) incentive ( equal net value ) take step start high decrease course month ( decrease incentive ) . For example , month-long intervention , user group ( 1 ) receive 6x usual point every day step take ; user group ( 2 ) receive 2x usual point several day , 3x usual point , 10x usual number point ; finally , group ( 3 ) incentive schedule group ( 2 ) reverse - start 10x multiplier decline . The question : Is well ease people exercise try help form lasting habit , start intensively ease pressure , maintain steady , constant incentive exercise ? By examine step take member investigator ' three experimental group month follow investigator ' intervention , investigator able assess whether increase , decrease , stable incentive ideal create lasting habit incentive remove . The anticipated output project publish research paper . The time frame observation 8 month .</detailed_description>
