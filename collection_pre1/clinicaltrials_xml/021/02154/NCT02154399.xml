	<brief_title>EF5 Measuring Tumor Hypoxia Patients With Stage I-III Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I. Assess frequency degree hypoxia measure EF5 bind patient non-small cell lung cancer . II . Correlate hypoxia measure EF5 bind potential serum/plasma marker hypoxia patient non-small cell lung cancer . III . Correlate hypoxia measure EF5 bind tissue marker hypoxia patient non-small cell lung cancer . IV . Correlate hypoxia measure EF5 bind tumor angiogenesis patient non-small cell lung cancer . V. Correlated hypoxia measure EF5 bind apoptosis patient non-small cell lung cancer . VI . Measure characterize tumor perfusion relationship hypoxia patient non-small cell lung cancer . VII . Correlate tumor perfusion microvessel density tumor sample patient non-small cell lung cancer . VIII . Determine longevity EF5 adduct human lung tumor . OUTLINE : Patients receive EF5 intravenously ( IV ) 1-2.5 hour . Beginning 24-55 hour later , patient undergo tumor hypoxia measurement use polarographic needle electrode intraoperative tumor measurement undergo surgical biopsy resection . After completion study treatment , patient follow 4-6 week .</detailed_description>
