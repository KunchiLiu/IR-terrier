	<brief_summary>Mechanical ventilation vital therapeutic support , widely use pediatric intensive care . Invasive ventilation ( IV ) associate risk major complication ( nosocomial pneumonia , secondary pulmonary barotrauma injury , pneumothorax ) , increase : duration ventilation , mortality , length ICU stay health cost . The practitioner ask benefit continuation IV daily adapt , limit complication . The evaluation work breathe key element understand pathophysiology respiratory distress also key element improve management ventilatory support adjustment ventilatory parameter . It show increased work breathe child admit ICU clinical acute respiratory distress significantly reduce ventilatory support . There probably relationship proportional work breathing ( PTP ) result respiratory request trigger respiratory drive electrical activity diaphragm ( Edi ) . The validation correlation PTP / Edi direct impact monitoring ventilate patient ability monitor physiological factor maintain classical treatment child simply monitor Edi without additional invasive device .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Study Improve Treatments Follow-up Children Who Need Respiratory Support</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>It important respirator detect child 's breathing effort . This make possible reduce pressure use respirator push air child 's lung , improve oxygen distribution throughout child 's body reduce level sedation Typical system really detect change breathe effort , rather volume exhale air . Therefore , respirator always synchronize patient 's respiration may delay breathe cycle ventilator 's , lead increase respiratory effort . Assessing respiratory work key element improve management ventilatory support adaptation ventilatory parameter . At time , routinely used measurement include quantitative measurement respiratory work , require installation probe pressure head . There new technology know Neurally Adjusted Ventilatory Assist ( NAVA ) employ probe inserted stomach detect electrical activity diaphragm ( primary breathing muscle ) .The probe connect respirator trigger respiratory assistance diaphragm electrical activity , thereby ensure respiratory assistance adapt child 's need . This artificial ventilatory mode already widely use invasive ventilation adult short period time infant , child premature newborn . Health Canada authorize use NAVA ventilatory mode within context study . The aim study ass whether relation electrical activity diaphragm respiratory work . This enable use diaphragm activity record daily child 's bedside element respiratory monitoring allow early detection dangerously high low respiratory level . The study plan recruit 20 patient CHU Sainte-Justine , hospital take part study . The investigator replace probe place stomach child artificial ventilation study probe . The probe change regularly part routine care . The study probe equip microelectrodes measure diaphragm activity well fine balloon measure pressure . The patient 's diaphragm activity respiratory work assess 2-hour period two different ventilatory condition ( NAVA mode conventional mode ) random order . The investigator perform random draw determine initial ventilator mode . The two period , last 60 minute , proceed follow : The conventional ventilation period : ventilation parameter adjust care team base practice effect within department ; researcher intervene . The NAVA mode period : initial setting determine target support similar prescribed care team adjust base NAVA clinical protocol effect within department During final 30 minute period , computer record ventilation parameter , diaphragm activity respiratory effort . These data record use simple connection ventilator change patient 's equipment require . If study naso-gastric tube still place time extubation , 3 additional measurement ( 10 minute ) take assess change diaphragm activity respiratory work around extubation : An initial record hour extubation ; A second one extubation ; ; A third one two hour extubation . The investigator follow patient progress another 48 hour extubation . Data collect child 's medical record purpose study .</detailed_description>
