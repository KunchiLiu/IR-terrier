	<criteria>Key Females histologically cytologically confirm HER2positive breast cancer . HER2positive define 3+ stain immunohistochemistry HER2 gene amplification fluorescent situ hybridization silver situ hybridization HER2/CEP17 ratio ≥ 2.0 Metastatic disease progress previous therapy previous therapy tolerate Subjects Phase 1b portion Group 1 Group 3 Phase 2a portion may receive number prior therapy breast cancer . Subjects Group 2 Phase 2a portion may receive 3 line therapy metastatic setting ( include adjuvant neoadjuvant therapy ) Must include trastuzumab , pertuzumab , trastuzumab emtansine . Subjects start initial systemic therapy HER2positive breast cancer prior June 2012 require pertuzumab If subject ER+ breast cancer , prior therapy must include least 1 hormonal therapy Subjects asymptomatic brain metastasis find screen MRI may enter Phase 1b Group 2 Phase 2a without prior radiation therapy brain . Subjects minimally symptomatic brain metastasis find screen MRI may enter Phase 1b Group 2 Phase 2a without prior radiation therapy brain require immediate surgical radiation therapy Subjects leptomeningeal metastasis may may brain metastasis . When brain metastasis present , need progress radiation therapy At least 1 measurable breast cancer lesion ≥ 10mm one dimension ( ≥15mm short axis lymph node ) spiral CT scan brain MRI Subjects Group 3 require measurable disease must cytologic confirmation leptomeningeal disease No increase steroid dose week prior screen brain MRI No history another malignancy past 5 year , except treat nonmelanoma skin cancer superficial bladder cancer carcinomainsitu cervix Adequate organ bone marrow function Serum potassium magnesium level within normal limit Cardiac ejection fraction within normal limit measure echocardiogram Women childbearing potential must negative urine pregnancy test . Sexually active woman must agree use two form accept method contraception course study 3 month last dose study drug . Effective birth control include IUD plus one barrier method ; stable dos hormonal contraception least 3 month plus one barrier method ; 2 barrier method . Effective barrier method male female condom , diaphragm , spermicide ; vasectomize partner Key CSF cytology positive malignant cell symptomatic leptomeningeal carcinomatosis Phase 1b portion . In Group 3 , subject require CSF cytology positive malignant cell Taking medication know inhibit CYP3A4 isozyme drug CYP3A4 inducer ( include phenytoin ) , drug associate torsades de pointes know prolong QTc ( f ) interval within 2 week prior Day 1 treatment study . A stable regimen antidepressant SSRI class allow Evidence active heart disease within 3 month prior study entry ; symptomatic coronary insufficiency heart block ; congestive heart failure ; moderate severe pulmonary dysfunction , torsades de pointes , ventricular tachycardia fibrillation , pathologic sinus bradycardia , heart block , congenital long QT syndrome Has active infectious process Has mark prolongation QTc interval screen baseline use Fridericia method correction heart rate History gastrointestinal condition might interfere drug absorption</criteria>
