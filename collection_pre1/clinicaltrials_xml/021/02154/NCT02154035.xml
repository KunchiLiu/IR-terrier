	<brief_summary>Background : Human Immunodeficiency Virus ( HIV ) virus cause AIDS . HIV hide blood many year , even people HIV infection control . HIV hide blood call latent HIV reservoir . Researchers want find study . This knowledge may help develop new way prevent control HIV . This study draw participant Rakai Health Sciences Program rural southwestern Uganda . Objective : - To measure learn latent HIV reservoir Ugandans HIV . Eligibility : - Men woman least 18 year age HIV . Design : - Participants medical history physical exam . Their medical record review . Researchers ask participant health recent illness . Participants able get pregnant urine test pregnancy . - Participants finger prick see enough red blood cell eligible study . - If eligible , participant blood drawn needle arm . Their blood also test disease . - After blood draw , participant ask stay seat lie feel well 30 minute .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Quantitative Measurement Correlates Latent HIV Reservoir Virally Suppressed Ugandans</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Despite prolonged antiretroviral therapy ( ART ) , HIV-1 persist transcriptionally inactive provirus rest memory CD4+T cell . This latent reservoir long half-life , believe large impediment cure ART alone . The latent reservoir may establish activated CD4+ T cell become infected subsequently revert back rest memory state . A major approach eradicate HIV-1 involves reverse latency patient ART . Cells harbor induced provirus could lysed HIV-1-specific cytolytic T lymphocyte , ART block new round infection . The description Berlin patient Mississippi baby suggest functional cure HIV possible . This led expansion research examine HIV latency context sustain viral suppression eye towards develop possible cure regimen could use large scale . However , recently demonstrate latent HIV reservoir could 60 time large previously believe . The recent report two HIV patient receive CCR5-competent bone marrow transplant reemergence circulate HIV fully suppressive therapy discontinue suggest functional cure large group individual continue elusive goal . The vast majority HIV-infected individual currently live sub-Saharan Africa fully suppressive ART expand rapidly . Due expansion , large number Africans eligible candidate cure treatment one come available . However , strategy need establish functional cure may differ African population due difference endemic infectious disease load cellular immune activation among Africans compare Western population . To date , systematic study quantify latent reservoir HIV-infected Africans . This longitudinal , descriptive study measure size latent HIV reservoir virally suppress HIV-infected individual reside Uganda examine immunological virologic correlate latent reservoir . The study draw participant National Institutes Health ( NIH ) International Center Excellence Research ( ICER ) site , locate Rakai Health Sciences Program ( RHSP ) rural southwestern Uganda . One group subject comprise 90 HIV-infected patient ART suppressed viral load &lt; 40 copy per ml period 10-18 month , include 20 individual know window seroconversion ( HIV-negative test result 18 month first HIV-positive test result ) . A second group comprise 10 HIV-infected subject suppress viral load &lt; 40 copy per ml period 10-18 month . Study participation require visit finger stick hemoglobin screen blood draw , year period three year . Plasma cell blood separate processed quantitative viral latency , circulate cytokine chemokine analysis , co-culture , flow cytometric serologic assay select immunological parameter . Viral latency result compare within individual change reservoir size might occur three year continual viral suppression order calculate T 1/2 decay rate latent reservoir . Samples collect individual know infection date use estimate</detailed_description>
	<criteria>INCLUSION CRITERIA : 1 . At least 18 year age 2 . Hemoglobin &gt; 9g/dL assessed fingerstick rapid test 3 . A historical diagnosis HIV infection indicate positive serological test ( ELISA , HIV rapid test , Western Blot ) 4 . Virally suppressed define least two historical viral load &lt; 40 copies/ml obtain 10 18 month apart , intervene detectable viral load result &gt; = 40 copies/ml obtain period 5 . Most recent historical viral load result obtain within year prior screen visit 6 . Willingness undergo genetic test EXCLUSION CRITERIA : 1 . Women pregnant exclude require blood draw may cause anemia 2 . Inability follow study instruction provide inform consent 3 . Any condition deem investigator contraindication study participation include active , serious infection ( HIV infection ) 2 week prior enrollment 4 .
