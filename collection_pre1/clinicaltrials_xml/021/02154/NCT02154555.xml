	<brief_summary>Chronic rhinosinusitis ( CRS ) common sinus nasal condition affect 33 million Americans . The treatment CRS typically begin maximal medical therapy however , fail improve patient symptom , surgical intervention consider . Endoscopic sinus surgery ( ESS ) well-established treatment refractory CRS approximately 600,000 sinus surgery perform annually United States alone . Despite success intervention , 26 % patient experience complication follow surgery , include middle meatal ( MM ) synechiae , edema , polyp recurrence , middle turbinate lateralization . Currently , consensus postoperative care regime effective minimize prevent potential complication . Therefore need study role debridement , examine patient undergo endoscopic sinus surgery concurrently address potential confounders maximal medical therapy postoperative setting . This prospective , randomize , single-blind , control study design investigate efficacy postoperative debridement follow ESS . Patients undergone ESS one nare randomize debridement debridement first week post-operative visit . In way , patient act control order account inter-patient variability disease severity . The primary outcome ass synechiae formation attribute ESS . Secondary outcome include pain ( side-specific ) attribute debridement procedure well compare pre post endoscopy score SNOT-22 questionnaire response .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Randomized Controlled Trial Evaluating Postoperative Debridement Following Endoscopic Sinus Surgery</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The significant heterogeneity present current literature regard use postoperative debridement warrant additional study document postoperative protocol use universally accept endoscopy score order consistently track patient outcome . Further investigation efficacy postoperative debridement especially interesting potential benefit reduce synechiae formation edema . Conversely , objective evidence fails demonstrate benefit postoperative debridement , could significant cost time save healthcare professional remove therapy postoperative protocol . We hypothesize postoperative debridement significant effect reduce rate synechiae formation . In addition , hypothesize improvement synechiae development also match improvement postoperative endoscopic sinus scoring , patient 's overall symptom 1 3 month postoperatively . This study clarify efficacy postoperative debridement potential benefit reduce synechiae formation edema , thus decrease rate complication revision surgery . Conversely , objective evidence fails demonstrate benefit postoperative debridement , could significant cost time save healthcare professional remove therapy postoperative protocol .</detailed_description>
