	<brief_title>Retinal Nerve Fiber Layer Macular Thickness Changes During Pregnancy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>There several know ophthalmic physiologic change pregnancy : 1 . Refractive Change : progesterone-mediated change fluid content partially account refractive change lens cornea ; myopic shift less 1 D observe 15 % participate pregnant woman 2 . Night vision decrease mainly low serum vitamin A level pregnant woman . 3 . Fall IOP second half pregnancy ( 10 % drop ) 4 . Corneal change ( increased thickness ; decrease sensitivity ) = contact lens intolerance The retina optic nerve consider part central nervous system , retina choroid highly vascularize . Due change CSF brain volume , vascular fluid change pregnant woman 's body expect find change RNFL macular thickness pregnancy .</detailed_description>
