	<brief_summary>Despite therapeutic effectiveness Parkinson 's disease ( PD ) current deep brain stimulation ( DBS ) strategy could achieve even well clinical result adapt patient 's condition . As intracerebral activity analyze record local field potential ( LFPs ) DBS electrodes correlate PD symptom , new stimulation approach would `` intelligent '' adaptive DBS system able change stimulation setting automatically patient 's need use LFPs control variable .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Clinical Study Adaptive Deep Brain Stimulation ( aDBS ) Controlled Intracerebral Activity Parkinson 's Disease</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Despite proven efficacy treat Parkinson 's disease ( PD ) , deep brain stimulation ( DBS ) system could optimize maximize treatment benefit . In particular , current DBS strategy base fix stimulation setting leave typical parkinsonian motor fluctuation rapid symptom variation partly uncontrolled , research focus develop novel adaptive DBS ( aDBS ) system able adapt moment-by-moment patient 's clinical condition . aDBS consist simple closed-loop model design measure analyze control variable reflect patient 's clinical condition change stimulation setting send `` intelligent '' implant stimulator . Intracerebral activity analyze record local field potential ( LFPs ) electrodes implanted DBS past 15 year help clarify basal ganglia pathophysiology relation PD symptom . Many LFP study reveal unknown function basal ganglia PD patient execution motor , cognitive , behavioral task show existence `` code '' LFP oscillation correspond patient 's clinical condition . LFP-clinical correlation provide rationale develop implement new aDBS device able adapt stimulation parameter moment-by-moment individual patient 's need use LFPs control variable feedback .</detailed_description>
