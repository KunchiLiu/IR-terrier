To evaluate frequency severity toxicity associate investigational therapy versus SoC . ( Phase III ) TERTIARY OBJECTIVES : I . To evaluate treatment arm randomization acceptance rate ( TARAR ) within treatment arm sub-study define percentage patient randomize treatment arm receive protocol treatment . ( Design # 1 : Phase II/III Design ) II . To identify additional predictive tumor/blood biomarkers may modify response define resistance target therapy ( TT ) /targeted therapy combination ( TTC ) beyond choose biomarker biomarker-driven sub-studies . III . To evaluate potentially predictive biomarkers non-match therapy ( NMT ) non-match study . IV . To identify potential resistance biomarkers disease progression . V. To establish tissue/ blood repository patient refractory SCCA lung . OUTLINE : Patients assign biomarker-driven targeted therapy phase II study .
