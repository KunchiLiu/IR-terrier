	<brief_summary>Background : - The autonomic nervous system help control thing happen automatically body , like blood pressure , heart rate , digestion . When work properly , call dysautonomia . Researchers want learn dysautonomias train doctor learn good diagnose . Objectives : - To allow people autonomic disorder evaluate . - To help fellow NIH Autonomic Disorders fellowship program see variety disease train . Eligibility : - People age 18 old dysautonomia ; child age 2 might benefit - Healthy adult volunteer Design : - Participants different procedure depend symptom . They one visit . They test . - Participants medical history physical exam . They may test problem think . They may complete symptom questionnaire . They may temperature blood pressure take . - Participants may intravenous line place . A needle guide thin plastic tube arm vein . - Participants may blood drawn several time . They may give urine sample . - Participants may electrocardiogram . - How much blood participant heart pump and/or much blood flow arm may measure . The total amount blood bloodstream may measure . - Participants may ability sweat and/or sense smell test . - Breathing , bowel sound , and/or body function may monitor . - Pupil size , response environmental temperature change , and/or breathing may measure . - Participants may bladder ultrasound . - Small piece skin may take study .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Clinical Autonomic Disorders : A Training Protocol</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Objective : This Protocol facilitate training Fellows evaluation clinical disorder autonomic nervous system . The training necessary enable Fellows sit pas certify examination autonomic disorder administer United Council Neurologic Subspecialties ( UCNS ) maintain UCNS accreditation Fellowship . A secondary objective include result evaluation test Protocols , future data analysis . Study population : Referred patient know suspected abnormality one component autonomic nervous system healthy adult volunteer . Volunteers study Fellows practice gain normative value pupillometric function . Design : Clinical physiologic , neuropharmacologic , neurochemical testing perform outpatient clinic visit inpatient admission , depend individual testing schedule . Inpatient test may do conjunction Protocols ( e.g. , 03-N-0004 ) . Most test Protocol complete single outpatient visit course workday . Testing procedure Protocol perform need adequate Fellow training . In addition autonomic medical history physical examination , clinical testing procedure may include ( A ) monitoring hemodynamics , sweat , physiologic parameter associate Valsalva maneuver , orthostasis , external temperature manipulation ; ( B ) venous blood sample assay level catecholamine related neurochemical ; ( C ) administration autonomic test drug ; ( D ) skin biopsy ; ( E ) blood volume measurement ; ( F ) pupillometry ; ( G ) gastrointestinal phonography ; ( H ) urinary bladder ultrasound ; ( I ) neurobehavioral rating scale . Outcome measure : The main outcome measure competency clinical laboratory evaluation autonomic disorder , base assessment Fellow Principal Investigator approximately 6-month interval . A secondary outcome measure result obtain Protocol , may analyze report research data along data Protocols .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>INCLUSION CRITERIA PATIENTS : Patients may include least 18 year old know suspected failure one component autonomic nervous system , small fiber neuropathy , inherited dysautonomia , orthostatic intolerance , neurocardiogenic syncope , status post endoscopic thoracic sympathectomy , disorder catecholamine synthesis fate . Children great two year old may enrol Protocol might personally benefit test Protocol establishment diagnosis . EXCLUSION CRITERIA PATIENTS : There exclusion criterion study whole . INCLUSION CRITERIA HEALTHY VOLUNTEERS : Healthy adult Volunteers ( least 18 year old ) may include , pending normal medically insignificant result history physical examination . A repeat history physical examination require 6 month go previous workup . EXCLUSION CRITERIA HEALTHY VOLUNTEERS : A candidate Healthy Volunteer exclude person follow : symptom autonomic dysfunction , include lightheadedness , fainting , abnormality sweat , frequent nausea , vomit , constipation , diarrhea , urinary frequency retention . If Volunteer condition require medication judgment Investigators affect result pupillometric test Protocol , Volunteer may include training purpose .</criteria>
