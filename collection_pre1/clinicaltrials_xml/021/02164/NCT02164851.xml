	<brief_title>Non-Invasive Shock : Differentiating Shock Emergency Department</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Shock common final pathway many disease state , occur oxygen nutrient delivery sufficient maintain normal cellular function . The incidence shock emergency department ( ED ) approximate 1-3 % ED patient ( 1 ) , carry high mortality , range 20-50 % depend underlying cause shock ( 2 ) . Early recognition treatment shock significantly improve outcome critically ill patient ( 2 , 3 ) , majority effort point focus identify patient shock . The many etiology shock may group several broad category : cardiogenic , distributive , hemorrhagic , hypovolemic , anaphylactic , neurogenic . These category cause shock different mechanism , significant amount clinical overlap ( 4-7 ) , make differentiate cause shock challenge emergency provider . While overlap also exist treatment category , several vastly different therapeutic approach . Since early treatment shock influence outcomes ( 2 , 3 , 8 , 9 ) , identify correct etiology treat logically impact outcomes well , although study shock patient . However , Moore , et al. , show physicians able correctly identify cause hypotension 25 % hypotensive patient ED , speak difficulty diagnose shock etiology high percentage patient undifferentiated shock ( 10 ) . Recently , number different device biomarkers suggest clinical utility differentiate shock guide resuscitation ( 11-13 ) . These device potential aid differentiation shock . We conduct prospective , observational study patient find shock `` near-shock '' physiology emergency department . We identify patient meet inclusion criterion identify shock `` near shock '' patient . Inclusion criterion include : HR &gt; 120 , SBP &lt; 90 , shock index ( HR/SBP ) &gt; 1 least five minute . Patients meet vital sign requirement , lactate &gt; 4 mmol/L , also include . Enrolled patient undergo physiologic assessment use echocardiography , Microscan , Non-invasive cardiac output monitor ( NICOM ) , extremity temperature device , well blood draw biomarker assessment .</detailed_description>
