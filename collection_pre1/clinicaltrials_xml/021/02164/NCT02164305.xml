	<detailed_description>Significance The human shoulder complex sacrifice stability exchange large range motion necessary hand manipulation . Due inherent instability bony congruence ligament constraint , dynamic control muscle play important role stabilize shoulder motion . The rotator cuff muscle serve chief stabilizer shoulder joint , deltoid provide torque necessary motion . Therefore , coordination deltoid rotator cuff muscle essential smooth efficient shoulder function . Impairment neuromuscular control muscle may lead injury pain . Consequently , rehabilitation program aim restore normal neuromuscular control shoulder muscle order help decrease pain improve shoulder function . Although rehabilitation program demonstrate positive effect pain decrease functional improvement , still unknown serve improve neuromuscular control shoulder muscle . While deltoid provide torque necessary elevation shoulder , also produce superiorly directly force glenoid . This shear force tend pull humeral head superiorly , result decrease subacromial space . When rotator cuff muscle function properly , line action rotator cuff muscle result center force , help maintain humeral head center glenoid fossa . However , hypothesize rotator cuff muscle able produce sufficient force arm movement , superior shear force produce deltoid result humeral head superior translation . This abnormal displacement result impingement subacromial tissue ultimately lead tissue injury pain . Traditionally , shoulder rehabilitation program focus strengthen rotator cuff muscle use shoulder movement rotator cuff muscle show high muscle activity . However , although activity lead strengthen rotator cuff , unknown whether repetitive stress impose rotator cuff result neuromuscular adaptation help counteract deltoid shear force . This stress rehabilitation may induce neurological physiologic change neuromuscular structure thus alters neuromuscular control entire shoulder complex . Kinematics electromyographic ( EMG ) measurement widely use study neuromuscular control . While kinematic measure show movement pattern , EMG demonstrate timing , sequence , magnitude muscle firing . Abnormal kinematics EMG pattern demonstrate patient shoulder impingement . Measuring parameter neuromuscular control lead well understanding underlying mechanism shoulder exercise training neuromuscular structure adapt stress exercise training . More specifically , assessment use ass whether rehabilitation program result positive adaptation help shoulder muscle handle stress activity overhead sport activity carry lift heavy object . Ultimately , could use design efficient train program athlete effective rehabilitation program patient shoulder injury . Innovation When shoulder neuromuscular control investigate field biomechanics , orthopaedic rehabilitation , sport , focus generally kinematics EMG . These kinematics EMG parameter represent shoulder complex control movement result motor command execution . Corticospinal excitability , widely examine patient neurological disorder , also recently apply biomechanics , orthopaedic rehabilitation , sport field . Corticospinal excitability represent efficacy neural transmission along corticospinal pathway . In addition neurological impairment , orthopaedic injury pain also affect corticospinal excitability . For example , subject non-traumatic shoulder instability , low trapezius demonstrates decrease excitability . Also , experimental tonic muscle pain first dorsal interosseous result inhibition cortical spinal excitability . Similarly , experimentally-induced acute low lumbar pain associate different effect trunk muscle . The deep abdominal muscle , transversus abdominis , show reduce corticospinal excitability . In contract , superficial muscle , lumbar erector spinae external oblique abdominis , demonstrate increased excitability . In addition kinematics EMG measurement , demonstrate overall motor strategy , corticospinal excitability another promising parameter investigate detail deltoid rotator cuff muscle control primary motor cortex spinal cord muscle . While consistent evidence suggest motor skill train associate increased excitability , effect strength train corticospinal excitability still well know may depend muscle train task . The training neuromuscular control may associate motor learn strength training . The control fire pattern may directly re-learned consciously , involve increase strength motor learning . Since associate learning process , excitability may increase training . It show change excitability correlate motor learn effect , change excitability training may correlate change rotator cuff EMG . After repetitive practice , conscious movement pattern may become automatic thus change EMG pattern rotator cuff activation . The purpose study ( 1 ) investigate effect exercise training neuromuscular control shoulder complex healthy subject , include kinematics , EMG corticospinal excitability , ( 2 ) examine relationship corticospinal excitability , EMG force measure . The result study may help understand underlie neurological biomechanic mechanism exercise training help design training rehabilitation protocols athletes patient shoulder injury . Approach A randomized controlled experimental design use investigate effect rotator cuff exercise . Healthy subject recruit randomly assign two group , exercise control group . All measure make twice , four-week treatment . Fine-wire electromyography ( EMG ) electrodes inserted supraspinatus infraspinatus muscle rotator cuff . Surface EMG electrode use middle deltoid scapular muscle . Transcranial magnetic stimulation ( TMS ) use assess corticospinal excitability deltoid rotator cuff muscle . A flat double-coil stimulation coil use provide single-pulse stimulus motor cortex , approximately 4 cm lateral bisection mid line biauricular line . Electromagnetic track sensor attach arm , scapula thorax measure shoulder kinematics . The parameter corticospinal excitability also measure arm 90° elevation baseline muscle contraction level 10 % maximum voluntary contraction ( MVC ) . TMS stimulation intensity set 10 % threshold increase 5 % increment response saturates . Five stimulus deliver intensity stimulation . The peak-to-peak amplitude motor evoke potential ( MEP ) measure average across five trial intensity . The curve relationship stimulation intensity MEP amplitude sigmoidal fit Boltzmann equation . MEP ( ) = MEPmax/ ( 1+ e^ ( ( S - 50 ) ) ) In equation , MEP ( ) amplitude motor evoke potential , MEPmax maximum MEP amplitude , slope function , S50 stimulus intensity MEP 50 % MEPmax . The peak slope function occur S50 . The threshold curve x-intercept tangent function point maximal slope . Three parameter , MEPmax , , x-intercept threshold , use model corticospinal excitability , provide detail excitability corticospinal tract . The value x-intercept threshold similar motor threshold represent stimulus intensity need activate excitable corticospinal element motoneuron . The slope indicate recruitment efficiency ( gain ) corticospinal tract . The MEPmax reflect balance excitatory inhibitory component corticospinal tract . Scapular humeral kinematics dynamic EMG rotator cuff deltoid muscle record three trial arm elevation scapular plane . The root mean square EMG data calculate four 30° increment motion arm elevation 0° 120° . Scapular kinematics present 30° , 60° , 90° 120° humeral elevation . The subject test shoulder proprioception . They wear goggle , give visual cue guide reach target . Three target position present : humerothoracic elevation angle 50° , 70° , 90° scapular plane . The subject instruct reach target without visual cue relax arm side . The error target angle angle return calculate . Both treatment program last four week . The subject exercise group standard rehabilitation exercise shoulder impingement syndrome . The exercise base previous treatment study conduct Dr. Karduna modify emphasize facilitation strengthen rotator cuff muscle . The subject control group receive exercise . The control subject ask maintain regular activity two assessment . A two-way mixed-design analysis variance ( ANOVA ) use examine difference neuromuscular control follow treatment control exercise group . The dependent variable change kinematics , EMG excitability follow treatment . The independent variable humeral elevation angle group . The correlation change TMS measure , EMG measure , force examine correlation analysis .</detailed_description>
