	<brief_summary>The study evaluate efficacy fluticasone furoate/umeclidinium bromide/vilanterol ( FF/UMEC/VI ) reduce annual rate moderate severe exacerbation compare dual therapy FF/VI UMEC/VI subject COPD . Published study assess use 'open ' triple therapy ( use Inhaled Corticosteroid [ ICS ] / Long-acting Muscarinic Receptor Antagonists [ LAMA ] ) / Long Acting Beta-Agonist [ LABA ] deliver via multiple inhaler ) moderate-severe COPD patient , report improvement lung function , Health Related Quality Life ( HRQoL ) , hospitalization rate rescue medication use , compare dual therapy ( ICS/LABA ) LAMA alone . These study also show similar safety profile dual monotherapy dose period one year . Given clinical experience FF , UMEC VI , associate risk compound anticipate known pharmacology , potential benefit new therapy option patient moderate severe COPD support development close triple combination ( deliver via one inhaler ) . In current study subject meet inclusion/exclusion criterion complete 2-week run-in period ; 52 week treatment period 1-week safety follow-up period . Eligible subject randomize one follow double-blind treatment group FF/UMEC/VI 100 microgram ( mcg ) /62.5 mcg/25 mcg daily ( QD ) , FF/VI 100 mcg/25 mcg QD , UMEC/VI 62.5 mcg/25 mcg QD</brief_summary>
