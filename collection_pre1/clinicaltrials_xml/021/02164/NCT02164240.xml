	<brief_title>Phase Ib Study SUnitinib Alternating With REgorafenib Patients With Metastatic and/or Unresectable GIST</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This non-randomized , open label , single-center , single-arm , phase Ib study evaluate safety preliminary efficacy short cycle sunitinib alternate regorafenib participant metastatic and/or unresectable gastrointestinal stromal tumor GISTs prior failure tyrosine kinase inhibitor ( TKI ) . The study consist two cohort : dose-escalation , dose-finding cohort , dose-expansion cohort . Between 6 15 patient expect included escalation cohort . A total 20 eligible evaluable patient include expansion cohort ass toxicity evaluate preliminary efficacy . Each treatment cycle last 28 day ( 4 week ) , time take study drug , sunitinib , first 3 day week , follow study drug , regorafenib , last 4 day week . The study drug take continuously 4 week cycle , unless study team instructs otherwise . Each participant receive study diary . The diary also include special instruction take study drug .</detailed_description>
