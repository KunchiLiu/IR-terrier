	<brief_title>Effect Soluble Dietary Fiber Bacterial Translocation Crohn 's Disease</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Bacterial translocation ( BT ) propose mechanism CD . Microorganisms culture 18-48 % drain mesenteric lymph node CD patient . A breakdown barrier function `` late stage '' CD observe patient require surgery . In addition , find BT influence response biological therapy clinical relapse CD . Therefore , reduce BT may therapeutic importance treatment CD . The role soluble dietary fiber Crohn 's disease ( CD ) still inconclusive . Population base study show long-term intake dietary fiber associate low risk CD . However , meta-analysis show benefit induce maintain remission . In addition , possible mechanism dietary fiber CD still unclear . The rationale relate beneficial effect fiber may due production fiber metabolites short-chain fatty acid ( SCFAs ) , particularly butyrate . Dietary substrate may modify commensal microbiota metabolites enhance epithelial barrier function . Recently , find dietary fiber metabolite SCFA regulatory mucosal regulatory T cell . The current study examine impact dietary fiber bacterial translocation , intestinal luminal microbiology , mucosal immunology CD patient .</detailed_description>
