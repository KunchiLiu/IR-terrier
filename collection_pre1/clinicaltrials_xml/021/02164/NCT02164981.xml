	<brief_title>A Proof Concept Study Intravenous Sodium Nitroprusside Adults With Symptomatic Schizophrenia</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This phase II proof concept ( POC ) , multi-center , prospective , randomize , placebo-controlled , Sequential Parallel Comparison Design ( SPCD ) study , total 60 subject schizophrenia enrol . The study conduct two stage . The study treatment administer double-blind fashion subject throughout stage study . A total 60 subject schizophrenia randomize 1:1:1 ratio drug-drug sequence [ n=20 ; i.v . sodium nitroprusside ( 0.5 μg/kg/min 4 hour ) week 0 week 2 ] , placebo-drug sequence [ n=20 ; i.v . placebo week 0 i.v . sodium nitroprusside ( 0.5 μg/kg/min 4 hour ) week 2 ] , placebo-placebo sequence [ n=20 ; i.v . placebo week 0 week 2 ] . The 4-week double-blind phase treatment divide two phase : Phase 1 , week 0 week 2 , Phase 2 week 2 week 4 . At end Phase 1 ( week 2 ) , randomized subject assess categorized responder non-responders , base 20 % reduction baseline PANSS total score per evaluation Randomization Visit ( week 0 ) . The data patient deem placebo non-responders phase 1 go either stay placebo receive treatment sodium nitroprusside pool data Phase 1 subject , accord SPCD .</detailed_description>
