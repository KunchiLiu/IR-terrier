	<brief_title>Wheelchair-bound Senior Elastic Band ( WSEB ) Exercise Program Demented Seniors</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>A three-year , longitudinal , triangulation research method apply . First Year ( Phase I ) : A preliminary WSEB , include hard copy description DVD demonstration exercise , send 12 expert Delphi advisory panel critique evaluation . First Year ( Phase II ) : A quasi-experimental , one-group , pretest-posttest design use pilot-test feasibility WSEB group 15-20 demented , wheelchair-bound senior long-term care facility . Second Year : A quasi-experimental , pre-post test , non-equivalent control group design use test long-term effect instructor-led WSEB functional fitness ( cardiovascular-respiratory function , body flexibility , range joint 's motion , muscle strength endurance ) , daily life function , depression , problem behavior demented , wheelchair-bound senior long-term care facility . Eight long-term care facility 150 demented , wheelchair-bound senior southern Taiwan recruit randomly assign base facility WSEB experimental group waiting-list control group . Participants experimental group receive WSEB lead pre-trained certified instructor , three time per week , 40 minute per practice 24 week ; participant waiting-list control group remain regular activity facility . One pre-test two post-tests , 12 week apart , conduct . Third Year : Using method second year , participant second year continue practice WSEB , guide DVD , another 36 week . The feasibility , compliance , effectiveness DVD-led WSEB demented , wheelchair-bound senior long-term care facility test , another three post-tests , 12 week apart , conduct outcome measurement second year .</detailed_description>
