	<brief_summary>Invasive fungal infection ( IFIs ) frequent cause morbidity mortality high-risk patient , immunocompromised patient . Candida currently predominant fungal pathogen patient population associate significant morbidity high mortality . Micafungin ( MCF ) semisynthetic compound belong new class antifungal agent , echinocandin lipopeptides , potent vitro experimental vivo activity variety pathogenic Candida specie Aspergillus specie . Its applied indication treatment and/or prophylaxis Candida Aspergillus infection . MCF currently license treatment candidiasis dose either 100 150 mg day . The efficacy MCF link area concentration-time curve 24 h steady state divide MIC ( AUC0-24/ MIC ratio ) . On one hand : - It demonstrate 98 % invasive candidiasis patient MCF AUC/MIC ratio 3 12 achieve microbiological clearance , oppose 85 % AUC/MIC ratio &lt; 3 . In case infection Candida parapsilosis , exhibit drug MICs 50- to100-fold high , 100 % patient AUC/MIC ratio &gt; 285 achieve microbiological clearance , oppose 82 % exposure level . ( 1 ) On hand : - It well known patient intensive care unit ( ICU ) characterize particular pharmacokinetic parameter higher apparent volume distribution ( VC/F ) and/or high apparent systemic clearance ( CL/F ) . In population healthy volunteer , observe CL/F MCF present high interpatient variability . ( 2 ) - Whether ICUs patient achieve optimal AUC/MIC ratio threshold standard dos investigate far . In particular , low AUCs might reach patient high VC/F value . Such patient would risk therapy failure would benefit individualized-dosing strategy . In context , study pharmacokinetics MCF critically ill patient seem necessary .</brief_summary>
