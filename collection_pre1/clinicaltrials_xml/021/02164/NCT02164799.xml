	<brief_title>The Epidemiology Approach Differentiating Etiologies Shock Emergency Department</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Specific Aim # 1 : To study epidemiology shock emergency department Hypothesis 1 : We good understand shock state determine shock etiology among patient present emergency department carefully conduct observational prospective study . Specific Aim # 2 : To determine accuracy physician diagnosis underlie etiology shock . Hypothesis 2 : Physician assessment underlie cause shock challenge often inaccurate early stage care emergency department . Specific Aim # 3 : To optimize evidence-based approach assist diagnosis shock etiology element readily available patient demonstrate shock physiology Emergency Department . Hypothesis 3 : An evidenced-based , standardized approach clinical decision make integrating element history , physical exam , early test improve physician 's ability accurately differentiate etiology shock .</detailed_description>
