	<brief_title>LEONIDAS : Quality Life Study Chronic Myeloid Leukemia Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The development molecular target therapy ( i.e. , oral tyrosine kinase inhibitor [ TKIs ] ) treat chronic myeloid leukemia ( CML ) one great triumph modern oncology one spearhead personalize medicine . Since introduction 2001 , number people live CML double , trend expect continue . This study ( i.e. , LEONIDAS ) set generate evidence-based data produce information advance scientific knowledge , clinical practice health service management facilitate clinical decision-making CML . In effort promote patient-centered care CML patient advocacy organization , : CML Advocates Network , involve project key representative advisory board team . The CML Advocates Network , host patient-run , non-profit Leukemia Patient Advocates Foundation worldwide network 82 non-profit organization 63 country support patient CML relative . Rationale Significance Some ten year ago , treatment CML relatively straightforward patient receive imatinib first-line treatment fail imatinib , available proven alternative allogeneic stem cell transplantation . Nowadays , three effective drug ( i.e. , imatinib , nilotinib dasatinib ) , use frontline newly diagnose chronic phase ( CP ) CML patient , treatment decision-making individual patient daily clinical practice thus rapidly grown complexity . Moreover , new tyrosine kinase inhibitor ( TKI ) , bosutinib , recently approve second-line treatment undergo clinical trial assess efficacy frontline strategy CML . To complicate scenario , fact despite nilotinib dasatinib show high rate cytogenetic molecular response ( compare imatinib ) , none three drug dramatically good others . To illustrate , slightly difference exist term progression-free survival nilotinib difference overall survival 24 and/or 36 month amongst imatinib , dasatinib nilotinib . Nevertheless , physician-reported toxicity data suggest drug different toxicity profile , imatinib induce high proportion low-grade side effect second generation tyrosine kinase inhibitor ( TKI ) ( i.e . nilotinib dasatinib ) . While wealth biomedical laboratory data exist clinical efficacy three drug , impact patient ' perspective , term Quality Life ( QoL ) symptom burden , poorly investigate . No data exist QoL patient treat nilotinib dasatinib know drug provide good QoL outcome imatinib use first line therapy . Such information would critical current CML arena make inform treatment decision . This significant gap knowledge respect modern management CML , also , long-term continuous exposure tyrosine kinase inhibitor ( TKI ) necessary , even low grade side effect heavily impact patient ' QoL . Thus , objective study investigate difference exist ( area magnitude ) QoL symptoms patient CML treat first line therapy dasatinib versus receive first line therapy imatinib , well characterize medication-taking behavior associate imatinib dasatinib .</detailed_description>
