	<detailed_description>Complete resection liver malignancy remain best treatment offer possibility long-term survival cure . At diagnosis , many patient locally advanced disease often preclude curative resection . During past two decade , good assessment resectability modern image technique along new multimodal therapy introduction modern chemotherapy regimen allow increase pool candidate surgical treatment patient locally advanced disease . The current principle safe liver resection focus mainly liver parenchyma remain resection rather liver resect . In fact , one main conditioning factor posthepatectomy liver failure ( PHLF ) amount quality future liver remnant ( FLR ) . The induction hypertrophy healthy parenchyma use either portal vein embolization ( PVE ) ligation ( PVL ) , set 1-stage 2-stage liver resection , nowadays consider standard care patient locally advance liver tumor small FLR.2,5-8 However , need long interval intervention ( 6-12 week ) , result resectability rate rarely exceed 60-80 % . In 2012 , Schnitbauer et al introduce novel 2-stage technique allow tumor resection 25 patient 5 German center marginally resectable primarily nonresectable disease mean rapid large FLR hypertrophy . This technique later popularize acronym ALPPS `` Associating Liver Partition Portal Vein Ligation Staged Hepatectomy '' . The promising preliminary result obtain new surgical proposal term hypertrophy possibility challenge previous method generate pronounced reaction surgical community world-wide rarely see history hepato-pancreato-biliary ( HPB ) surgery . However , possibility achieve short-term hypertrophy high resectability rate counteract published series increase risk morbidity mortality . The aim study evaluate result ALPPS procedure single high-volume HPB center , special emphasis safety feasibility new 2-stage strategy . Data patient undergo 2-stage hepatectomies ALPPS approach HPB Surgery Section Hospital Italiano de Buenos Aires June 2011 April 2014 analyze intention treat basis . Patient demographic , clinical characteristic ( body mass index , anesthesiological risk score , Charlson comorbidity index , preoperative chemotherapy ) , tumor type , surgical detail , FLR hypertrophy , postoperative liver function , postoperative complication , length hospital stay survival analyze . Regarding surgical procedure , first stage complete tumor resection ( clean-up ) FLR perform bilateral disease present , either trough anatomical atypical resection . Subsequently , portal vein diseased hemi-liver ( DH ) divide either total ( inferior vena cava ) partial ( middle hepatic vein ) parenchymal transection use Cavitron Ultrasonic Surgical Aspirator ( CUSA ; Valley Lab , Boulder , CO , USA ) carry . At end first stage , DH either wrap plastic bag plastic sheath place cut surface . Once volumetric CT analysis demonstrate enough FLR hypertrophy provide patient good condition , second stage carry next available operative day resect DH . The type liver resection perform defined use Brisbane 2000 nomenclature .</detailed_description>
