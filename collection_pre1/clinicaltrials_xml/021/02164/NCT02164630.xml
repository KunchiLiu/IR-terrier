	<detailed_description>In recent year , increase interest contribution positive psychological factor ( e.g. , optimism , pain acceptance , hope ) pain pain-related coping . Although research support significance resilience factor pain adaptation , psychological intervention base upon bolster resilience receive far less attention .

Although hope-based intervention successfully apply clinical condition ( i.e. , cancer ) , utility chronic pain disorder examine . To examine effectiveness approach , two-arm randomize trial conduct individual TMD . In Study Arm 1 , participant receive hope-based therapy . In Study Arm 2 , participant receive pain education . Participants attend 5 session period 5 week . Two session involve quantitative sensory pain testing ; three session include delivery treatment intervention . Pain outcomes measure pre- post-treatment . Aims : 1 . Examine degree state trait level hope predictive clinical pain , disability , affective distress , experimental pain . 2 . Investigate effect hope intervention , compare education control group , clinical experimental pain individual TMD . 3 . Identify psychosocial ( e.g. , hope , optimism , positive affect , catastrophizing ) , biological ( e.g. , inflammatory , endogenous opioid , neuroendocrine ) , psychophysical factor associate positive treatment response ( i.e. , reduction clinical pain ) .</detailed_description>
