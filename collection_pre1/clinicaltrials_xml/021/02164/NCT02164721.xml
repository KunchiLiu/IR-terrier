	<brief_summary>The purpose trial study determine cardiac resynchronization therapy ( CRT ) benefit people impaired heart function due past treatment chemotherapy and/or chest radiation . The investigator look enroll approximately 30 eligible subject heart failure trial . All patient enrol registered study implant cardiac resynchronization therapy device include implantable cardiac defibrillator ( CRT-D ) . Clinical history , physical exam , external device test collected time enrollment trial follow-up study visit . Following implantation CRT-D , patient contact phone 3 month schedule clinic visit follow-up 6 month .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Multicenter Automatic Defibrillator Implantation Trial - Chemotherapy-Induced Cardiomyopathy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>With advent new therapy increase number long-term cancer survivor , incidence consequently interest chemotherapy-induced cardiomyopathy ( CHIC ) increase . CHIC dose-dependent cardiomyopathy present congestive heart failure several month year administration chemotherapy and/or chest radiation include heart . Greater one-half patient expose class drug show evidence cardiac dysfunction , 5 % present overt symptomatic heart failure . The overall incidence CHIC significantly underestimate within US alone , great 60,000 patient receive anthracyclines every year . Despite , little data response conventional heart failure therapy . There preliminary evidence two small , retrospective case-series suggest patient CHIC evidence conduction tissue disease ( i.e . wide QRS duration ) may significantly benefit cardiac resynchronization therapy ( CRT ) . MADIT-CHIC multicenter , non-randomized , prospective observational study . The primary aim determine CRT-D ( Defibrillator ) high-risk patient chemotherapy-induced cardiomyopathy significantly improve leave ventricular ejection fraction ( LVEF ) echocardiography within 6 month initiate CRT without adversely affect mortality . The study last 6 month conduct 10-15 clinical center United States . Following implantation CRT-D device ( Defibrillator ) , patient follow 6 month . The first follow-up contact phone time study personnel review patient 's health status . The last study contact 6-month clinic visit . At 6-month visit , patient 's health status review , function CRT-D ( Defibrillator ) test echocardiogram conduct . After 6-month visit , study-required follow-up complete patient continue CRT-D ( Defibrillator ) clinical follow-up base physician direction . During course study , Subjects outline inclusion criterion continue stable optimal pharmacologic therapy cardiac condition guideline-based may include one follow medication : Loop diuretic , Angiotensin convert enzyme ( ACE ) inhibitor and/or angiotensin receptor blocker ( ARB ) , Aldosterone antagonists and/or Beta-blockers unless subject indicate , contraindicate , intolerant medication .</detailed_description>
