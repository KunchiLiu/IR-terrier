	<brief_summary>This trial first study axitinib child adolescent . The primary objective Phase 1 trial determine maximum tolerate dose ( MTD ) recommend Phase 2 dose ( RP2D ) axitinib pediatric patient refractory solid tumor . Additional objective include measurement pharmacokinetic pharmacodynamic parameter , description toxicity profile agent child adolescent , assessment response within confines Phase 1 trial . A standard roll 6 design use dose escalation . Further development axitinib focus development joint cooperative group ( COG/ECOG ) Phase 2 study axitinib pediatric , adolescent young adult translocation renal cell carcinoma .</brief_summary>
