	<brief_title>Evaluation Metabolic Acid-base Abnormalities Pre-eclamptic Women Applying Stewart-Fencl Approach</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Studies evaluate acid/base imbalance scarce pre-eclamptics , tool thoroughly evaluate lack . The detection metabolic acidosis propose diagnostic criterion severe disease state8 , 11 , however study entirely reject presence metabolic acid-base disorder pre-eclampsia10 . One reason controversy may lie fact study perform full comprehensive acid base analysis . Whereas measure plasma pH , HCO3 BE8 , 11 others focus AG1 AG HCO32 , 10 . Merely one study correct AG low albumin1 , study focus independent variable . While cite report base retrospective chart review without differentiate mild severe disease state1 , 2 , prospective study available low sample size include total number 311 98women severe pre-eclampsia . As indicated , totally legitimate use traditional approach describe change hydrogen ion concentration HCO3 . The Henderson-Hasselbach equation differentiate well respiratory metabolic acid-base change . However , unable quantify metabolic causes15 . SBE quantifies net change metabolic acid-base status vivo , tell u mechanisms16 . The AG insufficient detect unmeasured anions17 , 18 , correct low albumin detect unmeasured cations16 . Intravascular volume depletion disorder electrolytes albumin common finding pre-eclampsia1 , 2 impact disorder acid-base homeostasis increasingly acknowledge last decade3 , 19 . Decreased serum albumin alkalize effect plasma , result hypoalbuminemic alkalosis . Furthermore , derangement volume , sodium chloride homeostasis , well accumulation unmeasured anion , common finding pre-eclampsia7 may result multiple acid-base disorder . The presence hyponatremia hyperchloremia acidify effect blood pH , whereas hypernatremia hypochloremia lead alkalosis . The accumulation unmeasured anion , lactate uric acid , lead acidemia , otherwise compensated3 , 20 . We hypothesize comprehensive analysis , clinically significant complex metabolic derangement might discover pre-eclamptics potentially impact care plan . To knowledge , first time Stewart-Fencl methodology use determine cause acid-base status pre-eclamptics , take account multiple , potentially oppose , electrochemical disturbance observe patient population . Specific Aims Aim 1 : Prevalence The primary aim description prevalence acid-base disorder pregnant woman pre-eclampsia three time point : 1. time diagnosis mild pre-eclampsia , 2. time progression severe pre-eclampsia , 3. time delivery . Pregnant woman without pre-eclampsia use comparison group ( ) ( b ) test whether the.prevalence acid-base disorder higher pre-eclampsia pregnancy without pre-eclampsia . Aim 2 : Changes time acid base status This aim describe test change three time point prevalence acid-base disorder among woman progress mild severe pre-eclampsia , change initial diagnosis delivery among woman whose pre-eclampsia remain mild . Aim 3 : Acid-base clinical predictor This aim test whether acid-base variable time diagnosis mild pre-eclampsia predict woman progress severe pre-eclampsia and/or need urgent delivery . Significance ( Note—include significance relation translational health science ) Pre-eclampsia complicate 2-8 % pregnancy , major contributor fetal maternal morbidity/mortality worldwide5 , 21 , 22 . The cure pre-eclampsia delivery . However , especially remote term , premise delay delivery allow fetus continue grow thrive utero big part expectant management try achieve . The challenge remain day balance benefit prompt delivery ( undeniably benefit mother ) versus allow fetus remain utero ( although placental insufficiency severe endothelial dysfunction critical , baby may well well deliver ) . Unfortunately , strict criterion ( hemodynamic , metabolic ) predictive model may guide obstetrician decision proceed prompt delivery allow prudent expectant management . Therefore , management mostly guide expert opinion-based guideline , accurately predict adverse maternal events23 , 24 . The fullPIERS-model , recently publish result large clinical trial , considers gestational age , chest pain dyspnea , oxygen saturation , platelet count , serum creatinine level aspartate transaminase concentration , predict adverse maternal outcome sensitivity 75 % specificity 87 % 25 . However , predictor worst value record first 48 hour study use predict complication within 48 hour time frame 26 . In practice , model base exclusively information available admission still need . The data evaluate propose Stewart-method would add physiologic understanding disease , would easy obtain admission possibly discover new predictor adverse maternal perinatal event . Research Approach In prospective case-control study , previously normotensive woman diagnose mild pre-eclampsia define American Association Hypertension 27 enrol . Blood sample woman pre-eclampsia healthy control gather , plasma pH , HCO3- BE measure . According Stewart-Fencl methodology parameter dependent variable follow four factor 12 , 28 : - The difference strong cation anion concentration , 'strong ion difference ' ( SID ) - The pCO2 - The concentration weak acid , mainly albumin phosphate ( Atot ) - The presence acid , call unmeasured anion ( UMA ) strong ion group ( SIG ) Based concept , BE define : ( A ) plasma dilution/concentration ( =changes Na+-concentration , ( BENa+ ) ) ( B ) change chloride concentration ( BECl- ) ( C ) change albumin concentration ( BEAlb ) ( D ) change lactate ( BELac ) ( E ) change unmeasured anion ( BEUMA ) . BE = BENa+ + BECl- + BEAlb + BELac + BEUMA Each component identify quantified described Gilfix et al.17 . ( A detail explanation find Appendix application ) . Statistical Analysis Because descriptive exploratory nature pilot study , control multiple comparison make . Any result study interpreted hypothesis generating , justify large study . Aim 1 : Prevalence The primary aim description prevalence acid-base disorder pregnant woman pre-eclampsia three time point : ( ) time diagnosis mild pre-eclampsia , ( b ) time progression severe pre-eclampsia , ( c ) time delivery , comparison pregnant woman without pre-eclampsia . For BE measure , abnormal define differ +/-2mEq/l . If one BE measure abnormal , woman classify acid-base disorder . Descriptive display ( table and/or bar chart ) use describe percent woman acid-disorder ( ) ( b ) control woman . In addition , describe many case offset disorder total BE normal , i.e . would identify traditional approach . Further display describe prevalence abnormal value 5 component separately . In addition , explore utility displaying mean SDs 5 BE component . Logistic regression use test difference prevalence acid-base disorder pre-eclampsia versus control , ( ) ( b ) time point , control gestational age covariate . Linear regression use test difference mean BE component pre-eclampsia control , control gestational age . Aim 2 : Changes time acid base status This aim describe test change three time point prevalence acid-base disorder among woman progress mild severe pre-eclampsia , change initial diagnosis delivery among woman whose pre-eclampsia remain mild . Mixed model binary outcome data , use example xtlogit Stata , use test change time prevalence . Further analysis use mixed model continuous outcome test change mean individual BE score time . Aim 3 : Acid-base clinical predictor This aim test whether acid-base variable time diagnosis mild pre-eclampsia predict woman progress severe pre-eclampsia and/or need urgent delivery . A chi-square test use test whether fraction woman progress sever pre-eclampsia different abnormal versus normal acid-base time diagnosis mild pre-eclampsia . Further analysis use logistic regression analyse test whether 5 BE component predict probability progression . Potential confounding variable medication ( e.g furosemide ) use control symptoms severity disease also evaluate see whether control variable change association acid-base variable risk progression . We explore variety neonatal maternal outcome variable possible association acid-base predictor . Please find secondary outcome variable describe detail appendix revise application . Please find also clarified variable categorical continuous . • Sample size Sample size base observation pilot sample 25 paired arterial venous blood specimen woman severe pre-eclampsia mean venous BE ( Alb ) = + 4.4 ( ± 0.75 ) mEq/l . Considering power 1.0 alpha 0.05 , sample size 25 woman group need show difference 20 % BE ( Alb ) case control group .</detailed_description>
