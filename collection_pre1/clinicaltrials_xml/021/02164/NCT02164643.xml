	<detailed_description>Alzheimer 's disease ( AD ) common cause dementia elderly , affect approximately 7.3 million people Europe . AD clinicopathologic entity definitive diagnosis require presence clinical sign dementia pathological evidence amyloid plaque brain ( obtained autopsy ) . Currently , diagnosis AD early stage disease hamper lack noninvasive validated biomarkers underlie pathology . On one hand , suggest 10 % 20 % patient currently diagnose AD , base clinical evidence solely , lack AD pathology autopsy , hand community physician may diagnose AD 33 % patient mild sign symptom . Thus , need validate diagnostic biomarker could help clinician separate patient AD pathological sign refer evaluation care management . Furthermore , little know prognosis value dementia conversion current biomarkers AD pathology preclinical presymptomatic stage . Recently , 18F-labeled positron emission tomography ( PET ) image agent develop bind high affinity amyloid-β ( Aβ ) peptide fibril constitute amyloid plaque , thus , potential value image biomarkers amyloid deposit subject cognitive impairment isolate cognitive complaint . The principal objective ancillary study investigate prospective association PET amyloid load , measure twice two year apart , either Florbetapir ( 18F ) Flutemetamol ( 18F ) radioligands , dementia incidence 5 year follow-up sample individual present spectrum cognitive profile range isolated cognitive complaint cognitive deficit without dementia . The secondary objective follow : - To assess association change amyloid load clinical evolution participant ( functional cognitive ) - To estimate prevalence new research criterion preclinical Alzheimer 's disease - To investigate long-term outcome preclinical Alzheimer 's disease accord NIA-AA criterion - To assess determinant change amyloid load two year - To study interrelationship biomarkers - To assess added value amyloid bind agent ( Florbetapir ( 18F ) Flutemetamol ( 18F ) ) combination biomarkers ( neuropsychological , genetics , plasma , serum , CSF , structural neuroimaging , 18F-FDG-PET ) predict clinical dementia onset - To assess diagnostic accuracy amyloid agent Florbetapir ( 18F ) Flutemetamol ( 18F ) differentiate AD type dementia ( differential diagnosis ) - To study link amyloid binding agent survivalstudy design</detailed_description>
