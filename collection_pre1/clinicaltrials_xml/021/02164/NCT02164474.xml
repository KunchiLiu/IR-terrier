	<brief_summary>Exercise proven strategy prevent type 2 diabetes . Traditionally individual prescribe moderate-intensity continuous aerobic exercise adherence standard exercise program dismal . High-intensity interval training ( HIIT ) novel form exercise involve brief , repeat burst vigorous exercise separate period recovery . HIIT elicit many favourable cardiometabolic adaptation similar traditional exercise lower amount exercise substantially less time moderate-intensity continuous exercise . Therefore , HIIT tout `` time-efficient '' exercise strategy improve health . Whether overweight individual risk pre diabetes show great adherence HIIT moderate-intensity continuous exercise long-term ( 12-months ) test . Because exercise adherence require complex self-regulation , intervention design improve adherence include behavioural component . The investigator assess adherence HIIT moderate-intensity continuous exercise 12 month follow short-term ( 2 week ) intervention either HIIT moderate-intensity continuous exercise . Both condition include self-regulatory component target increase participant ' confidence engage regular , independent exercise . The result help determine whether HIIT feasible option promote exercise adherence pre diabetes prevention traditional moderate-intensity continuous exercise . The investigator hypothesize ) 12 month follow-up subject randomize HIIT likely adhere compare moderate-intensity continuous exercise , b ) 12 month follow-up subject randomize HIIT high rate adherence level total physical activity , c ) great increase self-regulation ( include goal setting , self-monitoring , self-regulatory efficacy ) follow HIIT mediate high rate adherence , ) 10-days HIIT moderate-intensity continuous exercise improve cardiorespiratory fitness , increase insulin sensitivity , reduce circulate inflammatory marker , improve glucose control e ) Improvements cardiometabolic health factor great follow HIIT compare moderate-intensity continuous exercise .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Eligible participant randomize HIIT moderate-intensity continuous exercise condition . Each condition involve two-week supervised exercise period consist ten session . Exercise prescription condition progressive nature two week supervise period match external work . Specifically , individual randomize HIIT begin four interval last 1-minute ~85-90 % peak oxygen uptake [ VO2peak ] increase 10 X 1-min interval day 10 . Individuals randomize moderate-intensity exercise condition begin 20 minute continuous activity ~55-60 % V02peak gradually increase duration 50 minute day 10 . Participants self-select exercise modality ( walk outdoors , elliptical machine , treadmill walking , stationary cycling ) . One trainer supervise participant 2-week training program . Participants complete 3 10 training day ( day 4 , 7 9 ) home unsupervised . Participants wear heart rate monitor exercise session ( supervise unsupervised ) monitor exercise intensity ensure compliance . In addition , participant record exercise bout logbook lab home training day . Participants condition receive 10 minute behavioural counsel day train lab ( total 70 minute ) . Following supervised training , participant instruct maintain HIIT moderate-intensity continuous exercise three day per week independently . Specifically , individual randomize HIIT prescribe three exercise session per week involve 10 X 1-minute interval ~85-90 % VO2peak , participant randomize moderate-intensity continuous exercise prescribe three session per week 50-minute continuous exercise ~55-60 % VO2peak . Training log provide participant instructed estimate exercise intensity base physiological cue teach supervised training day .</detailed_description>
