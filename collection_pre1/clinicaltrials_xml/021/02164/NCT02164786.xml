	<brief_summary>Acute severe disease major public health challenge often affect young adults.In past decade , lot new technique develop aim improve outcome acute severe disease , But work success . According recently study , mortality multiple organ dysfunction syndrome（MODS ) major cause death patient suffer acute severe disease , improve . On contrary , MODS predict early stage acute severe disease , death prevent . Because acute severe disease pose complex injury involve multiple pathological process , understand cellular metabolic network malfunction acute severe disease crucial clinical monitoring intervention . Human metabolism complex network hundred cross-linked path . During critical illness , metabolic network dynamically disturb multiple point . Classical research typically isolate small part network investigate impact pathological physiology molecular mechanism clinical outcome . In particular , researcher examine metabolic disturbance cytokine network dysfunction , skeletal muscle breakdown , insulin resistance , dyslipidemia , testosterone growth hormone/Insulin like growth factor （IGF）dysfunctions , low thyroxine syndrome , deficiency vitamin D calcium secondary hyperparathyroidism . These complex metabolic disturbance appear interact different stage pathological process acute severe illness . Therefore , integrated approach combine biochemical/molecular change network disturbance key understand acute severe illness system biology level establish accurate quantitative model clinical monitoring . An interdisciplinary method include high-throughput quantitative technique effective mathematical visualization tool necessary . Furthermore , interdisciplinary method present opportunity develop innovative clinical diagnosis monitoring method severe injury . The aim study provide novel high-throughput method integrate proton-nuclear magnetic resonance ( NMR ) metabolomic fingerprint High Performance Liquid Chromatography advance mathematics tool model metabolic dynamic acute severe disease .</brief_summary>
