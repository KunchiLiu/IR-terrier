	<brief_title>S1406 Phase II Study Irinotecan Cetuximab With Without Vemurafenib BRAF Mutant Metastatic Colorectal Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To evaluate progression-free survival ( PFS ) v-raf murine sarcoma viral oncogene homolog B ( BRAF ) mutant metastatic colorectal cancer patient treat irinotecan ( irinotecan hydrochloride ) , cetuximab , vemurafenib , compare control arm irinotecan cetuximab . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . To evaluate frequency severity toxicity associate treatment arm patient population . TERTIARY OBJECTIVES : I . To evaluate overall survival ( OS ) treatment Arms 1 2 . II . To evaluate overall response rate ( ORR ) , include confirm unconfirmed , complete partial response , treatment Arms 1 2 subset patient measurable disease . III . To estimate rate OS , ORR , PFS patient register Arm 3 disease progression Arm 1 . IV . To evaluate low-frequency Kirsten rat sarcoma viral oncogene homolog ( KRAS ) neuroblastoma RAS viral ( v-ras ) oncogene homolog ( NRAS ) mutation detect high-depth sequence predictive biomarkers efficacy . V. To evaluate phosphatidylinositol-4,5-bisphosphate 3-kinase , catalytic subunit alpha ( PIK3CA ) pathway activation PIK3CA mutation phosphatase tensin homolog ( PTEN ) protein loss predictive biomarker innate resistance regimen . VI . To evaluate gene expression signature screen patient v-raf murine sarcoma viral oncogene homolog B wild type ( BRAFWT ) BRAFV600E tumor . VII . To provide validation BRAF immunohistochemistry ( IHC ) use complementary sequence methodology screen patient BRAFWT BRAFV600E tumor . VIII . To confirm estimate sensitivity detectable BRAF V600E circulate cell-free deoxyribonucleic acid ( DNA ) non-invasive biomarker BRAF V600E mutation detect IHC primary tumor . IX . To correlate radiographic tumor response change quantification BRAFV600E alleles circulate cell-free DNA . X . To monitor known mechanism acquire resistance epidermal growth factor receptor ( EGFR ) inhibition circulate cell-free DNA ( KRAS , NRAS mutation ) . OUTLINE : Patients randomize 1 2 treatment arm . ARM I : Patients receive cetuximab intravenously ( IV ) irinotecan hydrochloride IV day 1 14 . Courses repeat every 28 day absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . Patients disease progression may cross Arm II . ARM II : Patients receive cetuximab irinotecan hydrochloride Arm I vemurafenib orally ( PO ) twice daily ( BID ) day 1-28 . Courses repeat every 28 day absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . After completion study treatment , patient follow every 2-6 month 3 year .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>STEP I INITIAL REGISTRATION : BRAFV600E TESTING : Patients must histologically cytologically document adenocarcinoma colon rectum either metastatic , locally advanced unresectable Patients must BRAFV600E mutant status document Clinical Laboratory Improvements Amendments ( CLIA ) certify laboratory pathology report prior Step 2 registration ; use Food Drug Administration ( FDA ) approve test prefer although BRAF test CLIAcertified laboratory may also accept ; BRAFV600E mutation know , patient must register Step 2 Randomization immediately follow Step 1 Initial Registration ; test perform locally , BRAFV600E test must complete central lab prior Step 2 Randomization ; specimen BRAFV600E mutation , patient ineligible Step 2 Randomization Brain metastasis allow adequately treat radiotherapy surgery stable least 90 day prior Step 1 Initial Registration ; eligible patient neurologically asymptomatic without corticosteroid treatment least 7 day prior Step 1 Initial Registration Patients must one two prior regimen systemic chemotherapy metastatic disease ; prior treatment irinotecan allow ; maintenance regimen 5fluorouracil capecitabine , without bevacizumab , count separate line treatment ; prior treatment metastatic disease require patient experienced disease recurrence within 6 month completion adjuvant chemotherapy Patients must treat follow prior Step 2 Randomization : Cetuximab , panitumumab , monoclonal antibody EGFR inhibitor EGFR BRAF inhibitor include , limited , vemurafenib dabrafenib ; regorafenib consider BRAF inhibitor purpose determine trial eligibility Mitogenactivated protein/extracellular signalregulated kinase ( MEK ) inhibitor include , limited , trametinib selumetinib Previous chemotherapy , immunotherapy , radiation therapy must complete least 14 day prior Step 1 Initial Registration toxicity must resolve Common Terminology Criteria Adverse Events version 4.0 ( CTCAE v4.0 ) grade 1 ( exception CTCAE v4.0 grade 2 neuropathy ) prior Step 1 Initial Registration Patients must tumor mutation detect codon 12 13 KRAS ; patient must tumor known mutation detect codon 61 , 117 , 146 KRAS NRAS SPECIMEN SUBMISSION CRITERIA : Patients must tumor ( slides block ) available submission V600E BRAF test Patients must additional tumor available willing submit tissue blood sample SPECIMEN SUBMISSION CRITERIA REGULATORY CRITERIA : Patients legally authorize representative must inform investigational nature study must sign give write informed consent accordance institutional federal guideline ;
