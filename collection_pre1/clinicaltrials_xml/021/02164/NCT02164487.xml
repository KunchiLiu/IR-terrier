	<detailed_description>Methods : In Assaf Harofe medical center 50 adolescent ( mainly girl ) age 10-18 year treat annually eat disorder multidisciplinary team . Their nutritional medical condition assess also blood analysis routinely . The investigator plan check thiamine status eat disorder female patient different stage treatment , compare age sex match control eat disorder problem . The control group recruit patient treated outpatient day hospital blood test anyhow n't suffer eat , metabolic , nutritional gastrointestinal disorder . The researcher look correlation different type eat disorder , nutritional state , treatment progress level vitamin B1 . Thiamin determine whole blood use High-Performance Liquid Chromatography ( HPLC ) superior previous method describe , determine thiamin diphosphate ; physiologically active form vitamin B1 accurately . Sample size : A previous study thiamine concentration 50 healthy French volunteer find standard deviation ( SD ) 15 nmol/l ( 7 ) . 17 patient group require order detect 15 nmol/l difference mean thiamine level power 80 % Alfa 0.05 .
