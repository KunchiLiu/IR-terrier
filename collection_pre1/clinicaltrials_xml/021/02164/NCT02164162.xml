	<detailed_description>In Parkinson 's disease , gait disturbance represent one disable motor symptom , frequently associate increase risk fall , loss independence negative impact quality life . Patients Parkinson 's Disease , display abnormal gait pattern ( reduce gait speed , shorten stride length , long double-limb support phase ) typically unable generate proper stride length maintain steady gait rhythm . Therefore , improve gait ability primary goal physical therapy patient Parkinson 's Disease . Conventional Physiotherapy aim enable patient maintain maximum level activity independence often prescribe , treatment gait give limited benefit . Promising report suggest external sensory cueing ( acoustic , visual , verbal cue ) , attention mechanism , may help increase deficient internal cue Parkinson 's Disease , thus improve gait pattern.Treadmill training , induces constant horizontal movement , generate rhythmic input locomotion , coordinate upper low limb , offer useful retrain modality complement conventional therapy . In last decade researcher focus use partial body weight support system ground combination treadmill train ( Body weight support-treadmill ) . These system , improve ability stand upright position redistribution force trunk , thus disengage girdle upper limb , suggest great improvement motor performance walk ability compare conventional phisiotherapy . In recent year , interest automate robotic device gait train Parkinson 's Disease patient grown . With consistent , symmetrical lower-limb trajectory , robotic device provide many proprioceptive input may increase cortical activation improve motor function minimize intervention therapist . Moreover , proprioceptive input may share mechanisms common external cue , thus stimulate cerebellar-premotor pathway improve gait . Besides , preprogrammed walk pattern corresponds normal gait kinematics include : gait cycle timing , inter-limb inter-joint coordination , appropriate limb loading , afferent signaling . A recent randomized control trial compare comprehensive rehabilitative program vis-à-vis robot-assisted gait train show latter display advantage . A pilot , non-controlled study explore effect robot-assisted gait training freezing gait.Still , despite recent interest automate locomotion training , still little evidence support superiority technique traditional gait training . A computerized gait analysis represent useful aid study gait disturbance . The analysis set objectives defines quantitative data gait change occur patient , relation progression underlie disease th effectiveness treatment administer ( medication , surgery physical ) . So main aim study analyze , clinical instrumental evaluation , effectiveness Lokomat gait training subject affect Parkinson 's disease comparison ground conventional gait training</detailed_description>
