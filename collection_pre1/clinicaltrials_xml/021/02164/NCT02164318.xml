	<brief_summary>This project examine enhance Nitric Oxide ( NO ) bioavailability increase rate arteriovenous fistula ( AVF ) maturation end stage renal disease patient require vascular access hemodialysis . To enhance NO bioavailability study team utilize program forearm exercise training , application nitroglycerin ointment . Goals study ( A ) measure recruit subject tolerate intervention protocol , determine dependent variable measure , include surgery outcome , measurement physiologic biologic marker , obtain ; ( B ) To measure subject compliance adherence rate intervention arm test visit ; ( C ) To examine intervention combination intervention demonstrate strong preliminary effect order estimate power pivotal intent treat trial ; ( D ) explore group difference clinical vascular marker biologic marker vein tissue .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>This project examine enhance Nitric Oxide ( NO ) bioavailability increase rate arteriovenous fistula ( AVF ) maturation end stage renal disease patient require vascular access hemodialysis . To enhance NO bioavailability study team utilize program forearm exercise training , application nitroglycerin ointment . Following entry study , approximately 4 week prior surgery subject undergo series non-invasive test vascular function arm fistula creation . Following vascular function testing , subject follow intervention treatment 4 week . After 4 week intervention treatment prior surgery , vascular function analysis repeat determine intervention effect arm vascular function . Surgery create AVF follow second vascular function analysis . A discard sample vein use create AVF blood sample collect surgery assess potential biologic difference intervention group . The intervention continue 4 week follow surgery . Subjects follow determine AVF mature successfully use dialysis .</detailed_description>
