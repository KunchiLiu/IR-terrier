	<brief_title>Young Adult Cardiovascular Health Trial</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Young adult history preterm birth identify unique risk profile develop hypertension reduce exercise capacity . Globally , 15 million annual preterm birth . In Europe , incidence 6-15 % birth , 6 million adult United Kingdom preterm birth history . Understanding association early life exposure early cardiovascular risk extremely important able target primary prevention strategy . As yet clear explanation reduce exercise capacity elevate risk hypertension report preterm born young adult . Magnetic resonance image study young adult born premature demonstrate altered heart shape , increase leave ventricular mass , reduce cavity size reduce stroke volume . The change cardiac size identify study similar see disease group equate great 50 % increase risk cardiovascular clinical event group . These structural change may account reduced exercise capacity observe preterm born young adult This study aim understand physiological determinant limited exercise capacity associate cardiovascular risk profile adult preterm bear population .</detailed_description>
