	<brief_summary>Breast milk gold standard early infant nutrition breastfed infant advantage several short long term outcome compare formula-fed . The first aim study evaluate effect add bovine lactoferrin infant formula . The general hypothesis bovine lactoferrin reduce previously observe difference formula-fed breast-fed infant regard health development . The main outcome study effect immune function . The second aim study effect low iron concentration infant formula test hypothesis iron lower without negative effect health development . The main outcome study iron status . Other outcomes trial microbiota composition , metabolomics , growth , body composition cognitive development . To test lactoferrin hypothesis , formula-fed infant recruit fed low iron ( 2 mg/L ) control formula , formula supplement bovine lactoferrin . To test iron hypothesis , third group feed formula ( lactoferrin ) high iron concentration ( 8 mg/L ) . Group allocation formula-fed infant double-blind randomize . Additionally , breast-fed infant recruit used reference group ( gold standard ) .</brief_summary>
