	<brief_summary>Hospitalized patient community-acquired pneumonia ( CAP ) reduce functional capacity , peripheral muscle strength quality life . Despite high incidence severity yet demonstrate whether physical training program change outcomes . Objectives : To evaluate effect exercise train program patient hospitalized CAP , compare effect traditional physical therapy ass whether inflammatory marker correlate functional status patient type treatment . Methods : A control , prospective , randomized clinical trial . Patients hospitalized CAP , adult , conscious , hemodynamically stable independent walk study . In first day , medical history , measure dyspnea , incremental shuttle walk test , Glittre test , measurement peripheral muscle strength , spirometry , application quality life questionnaire Shor Form 36 held . The measurement inflammatory marker ( C-reactive protein tumor necrosis factor ) also hold . Patients randomize two group : one perform program physical training ( stretch , active resistance exercise aerobic exercise ) group hold traditional physical therapy ( bronchial hygiene , breathe exercise walk ) eight day . On tenth day assessment carry initially describe .</brief_summary>
