	<brief_summary>This study look two new technology develop measure cancer bone . One technology substance call Sodium Fluoride ( NaF ) . Fluoride normal body substance . The amount patient receive show safe . One study 400 patient show adverse reaction receive recommended dosage . NaF ( know radiotracer ) take bone normal process researcher measure amount within patient 's bone image system call Positron Emission Tomography/Magnetic Resonance Imaging ( PET/MRI ) . This system combine aspect PET study part regular standard care MRI study . The belief combination two study well either study alone.People enrol study receive clinically request PET/CT scan part normal diagnostic care follow say recommendation study pregnant , fasted overnight , etc . Subjects return within 7 day 10 mCi NaF PET/MRI study . The patient ' imaging time 120 minute depend MRI sequence acquire . Imaging PET portion study take approximately 20-30 minute rest time devote MRI sequence .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>NaF PET/MRI Evaluation Bone Metastases Breast Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The primary aim study ass NaF PET/MRI compare FDG PET/CT , NaF PET/CT standard care image make available assessment bone metastasis breast cancer . NaF PET/CT image obtain fusion software . Researchers fuse Non AC AC NaF image low dose CT obtain FDG PET/CT study . Researchers use currently available approve MRI sequence attenuation correction localization well non FDA approve sequence assess ability modality identify bone metastasis . Study Goals : 1 . Assess sensitivity , specificity , accuracy NaF PET/MRI vs. current standard care image . This do lesion lesion basis base prior study look NaF PET/CT . Lesions positive NaF PET/MRI image follow future image see eventually become positive give physiology change anatomy . Follow include review surveillance standard care image 6 month NaF PET/MRI do . 2 . Assess various NaF MRI sequence attenuation correction localization approve developmental sequence compare NaF CT attenuation correct image software . 3 . Assess ability MRI sequence acquire attenuation correction localization evaluate bone metastasis comparison modality . 4 . Assess image quality various NaF MRI sequence acquire attenuation correction localization use approve developmental sequence . 5 . Ascertain , lesion identify NaF PET/MRI study see FDG PET/CT study , would change subsequent patient management .</detailed_description>
