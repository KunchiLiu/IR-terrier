	<brief_title>Early Response Assessment Induction Chemotherapy Acute Myeloid Leukemia Patients Using F-18 FLT PET/CT</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Assessment treatment response AML important determine next treatment . Standard treatment AML begin induction chemotherapy . NCCN guideline recommend ass treatment response via bone marrow examination approximately 7-10 day completion induction chemotherapy . However , possibility sample error risk infection bleed limitation bone marrow biopsy . F-18 fluorodeoxythymidine ( FLT ) radiopharmaceutical PET , reflect proliferation cell . F-18 FLT trap phosphorylation thymidine kinase1 , whose expression increase replicate cell . There several study report F-18 FLT PET could measure health proliferation bone marrow . The aim study evaluate F-18 FLT PET/CT suitable early response assessment induction chemotherapy acute myeloid leukemia patient .</detailed_description>
