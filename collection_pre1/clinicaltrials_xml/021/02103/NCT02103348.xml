	<detailed_description>Asthma heterogeneous disease characterize airway hyperreactivity chronic airway inflammation . Published literature last year show asthma behave like single disease syndrome vast heterogeneity pathogenesis , severity , treatment response . Various clinical phenotype endotypes describe advance understanding difference mechanisms underlie . We propose subgroup asthmatic patient sputum abnormal biophysical property . Healthy airway mucus compose lightly cross-linked gel easily transport mucociliary apparatus , cough expectorate swallow . Pathologic mucus , contrast , abnormally high elasticity . This due cross link structure give sputum property solid make sputum difficult mobilize . Increased sputum elasticity make expectoration sputum difficult lead airflow obstruction . Pathologic mucus contributes airflow obstruction airway infection multiple lung disease , include asthma . Mucus plug particular problem asthmatic patient allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis ( ABPA ) The identification phenotype severe asthma pathologic mucus contribute disease severity may change think severe asthma , move towards therapy target mucus clearance condition cystic fibrosis . Pathologic mucus severe asthma characterize cellular inflammation , high concentration mucin DNA polymer . Knowledge specific cellular biochemical constituent pathologic mucus severe asthma guide target mucolytic treatment n-acetylcysteine , rhDNAse , novel mucolytic agent . As part Severe Asthma Research Program ( SARP ) , UCSF unique position recruit large number severe asthmatic subject within expect portion demonstrate high sputum elasticity . We also CAESAR recruit additional subject moderate severe airflow obstruction . We perform rheological measurement subject recruit site identify group asthmatic case elastic modulus ≥1 &lt; 1 compare property sputum subject healthy control .</detailed_description>
