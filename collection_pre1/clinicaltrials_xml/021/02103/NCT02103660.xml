	<brief_summary>The purpose study determine acceptability randomization contraceptive option estimate effect progestin contraception HIV genital shed inflammatory/immune perturbation woman may may antiretroviral therapy , well HIV-uninfected woman control . It hypothesize progestin-containing contraception lead inflammatory change may affect local immune activity , influence HIV acquisition transmissibility risk .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Hormonal contraception central component prevention unintended pregnancy ; however concern certain method may increase risk heterosexual HIV acquisition transmission . Some study , others , suggest link hormonal contraceptive use enhance HIV-susceptibility , rapid HIV disease progression , increase transmissibility partner . Hormonal contraception modifies genital mucosa several way , interaction endocrine immune system complex incompletely understood . In cross-sectional study , hormonal contraceptive appear associate increased shed HIV DNA , RNA , genital tract , significance finding HIV transmissibility unclear . Very study examine genital HIV shed prospectively initiation contraception . The effect hormonal contraception set antiretroviral therapy ( ART ) also unknown . Hormonal contraception , particularly injectable DMPA , widely use many part world , include setting high HIV prevalence . It important effect hormonal contraception HIV acquisition HIV shed subsequent transmissibility determine . The effect progestin contraceptive implant , levonorgestrel rod implant ( LNG implant ) , HIV shed unknown , interest evaluate compare injectable progestin ( DMPA ) , give different kinetics hormone release , difference progestin type , high efficacy method . We propose pilot study among 100 HIV-infected woman 30 uninfected woman Lilongwe , Malawi randomize either DMPA LNG implant : 1 ) ass effect compare impact type progestin-containing contraception ( injectable versus implant ) HIV viral shed genital tract HIV+ woman , 2 ) ass effect compare impact type progestin-containing contraception ( injectable versus implant ) inflammatory/immune marker genital tract HIV+ HIV- woman , 3 ) ass interaction progestin-based hormonal contraception ART examining : i. contraceptive efficacy ( measure systemic hormone level pregnancy rate follow-up ) , ii . ART efficacy ( drug concentration blood genital tract HIV viral load response plasma woman ART ) . An overall study aim determine feasibility need large study determinant HIV transmissibility acquisition population . The study would take place Bwaila Maternity Hospital , site CDC-sponsored Breastfeeding , Antiretrovirals , Nutrition ( BAN ) clinical trial , partner project study . Women attend clinic Bwaila ( large proportion participate BAN study ) desire start hormonal contraception inform new study counsel progestin-based contraceptive available within study . BAN woman specifically target recruitment radio message . Eligible woman provide inform consent agree randomization either DMPA LNG implant enrol . HIV-infected woman may ART may pre-ART . To address primary outcome HIV shed mucosal immune activation , quantify genital tract HIV RNA inflammatory/immune marker two time point four time point randomization 100 HIV-infected 30 HIV-uninfected woman DMPA LNG-implant . The two time point prior randomization occur within prior menstrual cycle , one visit occur follicular phase occur luteal phase cycle . Assessments initiation contraception occur day 3 , 30 , 90 , 6 month . Antiretroviral level blood genital tract also assess time point . Based recent evidence suggest LNG implant may decrease contraceptive efficacy use combination antiretroviral efavirenz , study follow-up extend include visit 9 , 12 , 15 , 18 , 24 month initiation contraception . Assessments visit address outcomes contraceptive ART efficacy HIV shed . To analyze effect progestin contraception HIV shedding , well effect contraceptive type , HIV-infected woman progestin-based contraception compare within study arm ( initiation contraception ) , well two contraceptive arm . Antiretroviral use evaluate independent effect HIV shed also determine modifies effect menstrual cycle progestin contraception HIV shed . To analyze effect progestin contraception genital inflammatory/immune marker , HIV-infected HIV-uninfected woman progestin-based contraception compare separately combine , HIV status treat potential effect modifier , within study arm ( initiation contraception ) , well two contraceptive arm . This study provide information acceptability randomization contraceptive option , overall study retention , estimate effect progestin contraception HIV genital shed inflammatory/immune perturbation woman may may antiretroviral therapy , well HIV-uninfected woman control . This information instrumental determine need feasibility large study address outcome .</detailed_description>
