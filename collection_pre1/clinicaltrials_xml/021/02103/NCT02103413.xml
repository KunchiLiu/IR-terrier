	<brief_summary>Although ERCP almost always successful patient malignant biliary obstruction , selective biliary cannulation fail case conventional ERCP may possible patient tumor invasion duodenum major papilla , surgically alter anatomy ( e.g. , Roux-en-Y anastomosis ) , complex hilar biliary stricture . In case , percutaneous transhepatic biliary drainage ( PTBD ) useful alternative . However , PTBD various complication presence external drainage catheter would also cosmetic problem relate external drainage adverse impact quality life ( QOL ) terminally ill patient . Since endoscopic ultrasound-guided bile duct puncture describe 1996 , sporadic case report EUS-guided biliary drainage ( EUS-BD ) suggest feasible effective alternative patient fail conventional ERCP stenting . The potential benefit EUS-BD include one-stage procedure ERCP unit , internal drainage avoid long-term external drainage case external PTBD drainage catheter internalize , thus significantly improve QOL terminally ill patient , possibly low morbidity PTBD surgery . Up date , case series EUS-BD small number patient publish , know feasibility safety term incidence procedure-related clinical outcomes.10-21 There comparative study outcome PTBD EUS-BD focus QOL , cost-effectiveness , complication . The researcher investigate technical success EUS-BD PTBD patient malignant biliary obstruction fail conventional ERCP prospective randomize comparative study multicenters . Secondary endpoint cost-effectiveness complication rate EUS-BD PTBD .</brief_summary>
