	<brief_title>An Exercise RCT Targeting African-American Women With Metabolic Syndrome High Risk Breast Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>1 . To assess impact exercise biomarkers related obesity , insulin-related pathway , inflammation , hormone , microRNAs . 2 . The primary aim study compare effect 2 type exercise intervention ( supervise self-directed compare control ) biological parameter relate breast cancer development . It important understand participant study respond good exercise program able engage ( self-directed ) participate exercise program supervision prefer . A study Pinto utilize home-based exercise program among breast cancer survivor comment home-based program several advantage include 1 ) mitigate transportation schedule difficulty , 2 ) less expensive supervised program . Another study compare effect supervise exercise program self-directed exercise group control group physical function health-related quality life among breast cancer survivor find participant self-directed exercise group improve physical functioning somewhat great degree supervise group . The author propose one reason result could attribute fact self-directed program include many feature think comprise effective home training include follow : baseline fitness evaluation , write guideline home exercise , education pulse checking/heart rate guideline , daily activity log bi-weekly telephone call exercise specialist . In current study , plan employ feature similar self-directed exercise program effort determine self-directed group improve great extent control group well comparable supervised group . An added feature current study administer participant satisfaction questionnaire ass participant 's experience respective group . This information , part , help u plan future study . All participant complete baseline assessment prior randomization , indicate Table 1 attach grant proposal ; follow-up measure also conduct indicated table . Participants require provide medical clearance health care provider nurse practitioner . 3 . * Rationale justification study ( i.e . historical background , investigator 's personal experience , pertinent medical literature , etc . ) : In United States , breast cancer commonly diagnose cancer woman , non-melanoma skin cancer , second common cause cancer death among woman . Several risk factor identify increase breast cancer risk , non-modifiable ( e.g. , age , family history , race ) modifiable ( e.g. , physical activity , body weight , dietary habit , alcohol intake ) . Breast cancer rate , increase worldwide , parallel increase lifestyle disease include Type 2 diabetes , obesity , metabolic syndrome ( MetS ) . MetS represent cluster risk factor associate increase risk cardiovascular disease , include several component individually relate breast cancer etiology , i.e. , central obesity , hypertension , hyperglycemia , low high-density lipoprotein cholesterol . However , recent study suggest MetS underdiagnosed African-American woman less likely decreased HDL increase triglyceride compare woman races/ethnicities . Breast cancer hormone relate thus , effect establish risk factor disease , include obesity , differ menopause . Among African-American woman , MetS prevalent breast cancer mortality rate high , hypothesize intervene MetS improve MetS profile may prove mean reduce breast cancer risk . The American Cancer Society ( ACS ) International Agency Research Cancer World Health Organization recommend regular physical activity strategy woman reduce risk develop breast cancer . Specific recommendation breast cancer prevention , initially emphasize diet , focused maintain healthy weight throughout life balance caloric intake increase caloric expenditure via increased physical activity level , lose weight overweight obese . Obesity major public health problem associate increase postmenopausal breast cancer incidence mortality . Our propose pilot project compare two exercise intervention : supervise facility-based home-based exercise intervention control group African-American woman metabolic syndrome high risk breast cancer ( base CARE model ) .This study 6-month three-arm RCT ass impact exercise intervention biomarkers related obesity , insulin-related pathway , inflammation , hormone . The specific aim propose study compare impact supervise facility-based home-based exercise intervention obesity , metabolic syndrome know breast cancer biomarkers postmenopausal African-American woman metabolic syndrome increase risk breast cancer .</detailed_description>
