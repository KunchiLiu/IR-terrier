	<detailed_description>This proposal aim describe oculometric feature present K-D testing subject experience sports-related concussion . The investigator aim good describe underlie oculomotor anomaly present cohort lead increase K-D test time . Understanding anomaly allow well understanding effect sports-related concussion may provide rapid reliable metric diagnose concussion well monitor long-term recovery . The main objective include : 1 . Describing oculometric deficit present subject acute sports-related concussion . 2 . Analyzing quantify oculometric change occur subject recovery . 3 . Identifying possible oculometric feature potential biomarkers may lead reliable , rapid method recognize acute concussion .</detailed_description>
