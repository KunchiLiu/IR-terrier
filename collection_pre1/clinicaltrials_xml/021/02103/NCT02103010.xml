	<brief_summary>Radiotherapy integral component current multimodality treatment approach locally advanced head neck cancer ( HNC ) . There grow evidence aggressive treatment regimen improve tumour control survival . However , intensified treatment expense increase toxicity , particular severe acute mucositis . In addition increase importance , late irreversible treatment-related side effect , include xerostomia swallow dysfunction , occur considerable proportion patient negatively affect quality life . High-risk human papilloma virus ( HPV ) , specifically HPV type-16 , implicate causative factor proportion HNC , especially oropharynx . HPV-related cancer respond well chemoradiotherapy compare HNC related tobacco alcohol . Furthermore , incidence HPV-related oropharyngeal cancer rise Western country . Given significant toxicity associate concurrent chemoradiotherapy , subset patient could manage differently . The first objective project develop predictive model radiation-induced dysphagia xerostomia HNC patient . Clinical characteristic , treatment parameter , dose-volume effect healthy tissue whole-genome genetic data consider . The second objective project study prognostic value HPV status together panel tumour biomarkers oropharyngeal cancer patient . The overall aim project stratify patient accord risk ( side-effects ) benefit ( survival ) cancer treatment use develop risk model . Clustering patient different risk category may aid treatment decision make reduce therapy toxicity without compromise survival .</brief_summary>
