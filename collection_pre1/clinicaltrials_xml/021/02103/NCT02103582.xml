	<brief_title>Quit Fit : A Tobacco Cessation Energy Balance Pilot African Americans</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>1 . * Purpose project ( one two sentence ) : The feasibility phase propose study comprise two-arm randomized pilot trial evaluate feasibility , satisfaction , preliminary efficacy 'Quit &amp; Fit ' . Women ( N=40 ) receive 12 weekly smoking cessation telephone counseling session . Participants randomize either fitness intervention ( Quit &amp; Fit ) contact time control ( Quit Life ) . 2 . * Study design ( example , hypothesis , research question , standard experimental procedures/drugs/devices equipment , etc . ) : The Quit &amp; Fit intervention design 12-week , tailored multiple health outcome intervention promote smoke cessation , achieve energy balance , reduce post-cessation weight gain regular PA healthy nutrition AAW smoker . Culturally tailored comprehensive intervention address smoking-cessation obesity/weight-control among AAW need . The conceptual basis proposal Albert Bandura 's social cognitive Theory ( SCT ) , posit people learn observation model behavior , attitude , emotional reaction . When applied smoke cessation health behavior change , social learning view transition stage increase knowledge , self-efficacy , social support , culminate readiness change behavior . The SCT model allow target factor relevant give individual tailoring message participant 's cultural value . Participants randomize one study group : 'control arm ' 'exercise arm ' . Both group receive 12 week smoke cessation counseling , telephone counsel receive 10 week nicotine replacement therapy ( NRT ) form nicotine lozenge . Participants randomize 'control arm ' ask maintain current daily activity 12 week . They also require visit study site 3 time per week 12 week view videos different wellness topic . Control participants anthropometric measurement weight , height , hip size waist size take begin study , 6 week , 12 week . Control participant also fitness test treadmill , full body scan , blood pressure , heart rate questionnaire give begin study , 6 week 12 week . Participants randomized 'intervention arm ' ask come study site exercise 3 day per week 12 week . The exercise duration increase time 75 minute per week 150 minute per week . Intervention participant anthropometric measurement weight , height , hip size waist size take begin study , 6 week , 12 week . Intervention participant also fitness test treadmill , full body scan , blood pressure , heart rate questionnaire give begin study , 6 week 12 week . The propose design intervention provide high education , support , NR , structure exercise optimize success experience build self-doses first session . As intervention progress , support mobile phone use assist problem solve social support participant transition self-management . Content base extant literature tobacco cessation , nutrition , exercise intervention , emphasis give publish description intervention tailor AAW . Examples resource content may draw include Commit Quit , Smoke Free Woman ( NCI ) , Pathways Freedom ( 2003 version ) , Diabetes Prevention Program . Key content message develop counsel session . print material specifically target visual image content find engage AAW . Focus group conduct woman represent target population order develop message visual content . These qualitative data critical development intervention material engage connect woman . Focus group conduct first 3 month award , primary goal further tailor intervention material protocols live African-American woman reside urban District Columbia ( DC ) neighborhood . A total 4 group run 8 woman . The demographic makeup group resemble target population factor educational attainment socio-economic status ( SES ) . Participants recruit outreach method ( flyer , community talk ) use successfully Dr. Adams-Campbell 's community lab . The multiple principal investigator ( MPIs ) refine focus group facilitator 's guide review focus group transcripts note maintain protocol integrity . Open-ended question probe view target health behavior well preferred information delivery modalities way remain contact provide optimal support . All focus group audio-taped , research assistant take note session . Audiotapes transcribe translate order analyze content . 3 . * Rationale justification study ( i.e . historical background , investigator 's personal experience , pertinent medical literature , etc . ) : Smoking lead cause preventable morbidity mortality US . African Americans experience clear disparity disease death smoking . African American woman ( AAW ) important subgroup study distinct non-AAW male African American counterpart biopsychosocial factor relevant smoke behavior . In particular , AAW low smoking rate compare Caucasian woman ( CAW ) yet similar lung cancer rate . Additional evidence indicate AAW likely develop cancer larynx , esophageal cancer , cerebrovascular disease , cardiovascular disease CAW . African American smoker less likely screened provider tobacco use , receive advice quit , use cessation aid quit attempt , even control health service use socioeconomic factor . Smoking cessation single important preventative health behavior AAW engage significantly reduce chance morbidity premature mortality relate smoking related illness . Due disparate smoking-related health outcome , target tailor smoking cessation intervention extremely critical AAW . Along disease burden tobacco use , sedentary lifestyle obesity pose heighten concern chronic disease diabetes vascular disease among AAW . In 2008 , AAW high incidence mortality attribute coronary heart disease , stroke , heart failure , high blood pressure , compare non-Hispanic Whites Hispanics . Energy balance define balance energy take , generally food drink , energy expand . Lifestyle behavior strongly link obesity take , generally low level physical activity ( sedentary lifestyle ) high consumption rate high-fat energy-dense diet , . African Americans find different dietary tradition Caucasians consume high percentage calorie fat even control individual characteristic neighborhood SES . Despite robust evidence cancer-protective health promote influence physical activity ( PA ) , 50 % Americans engage adequate lever PA. A recent study identify physical inactivity smoke two health behavior relative inequality increase among less formal education compare . SES-related obesity disparity also increase woman among African Americans . There indeed public health call evidence-based research regionally culturally targeted energy balance strategy effectively reach engage African Americans . Nearly evidence-based smoking cessation program address importance post-cessation weight gain dietary choice PA . However , issue typically emphasize centrally important likelihood success cessation attempt . Likewise , weight control program initiative promote PA give minimal attention tobacco cessation . Questions remain effective way implement intervention simultaneously address multiple health behavior . However , evidence continue emerge suggest intervention feasible , advantage approach focus single health promotion behavior . A targeted multiple health outcome intervention promise change health behavior lead improve health ultimately reduce cancer death disparity among AAW . Culturally tailor comprehensive intervention address smoking-cessation obesity/weight-control among AAW need . This pilot project seek develop combined health promotion intervention tailor urban AAW smoker . `` Quit &amp; Fit '' design 12-week program promote smoke cessation achieve energy balance regular PA healthy nutrition . The first several week intervention provide maximum structured in-person support taper time follow tailor mobile phone session provide ongoing support , counseling , assist transition initial structure counsel self-management . The program employ evidence-based strategy meet needs preference AAW urban environment . Many study focus various health problem aim target , study , intervention focus one aspect problem , e.g. , smoke cessation alone PA alone . The success propose multiple health outcome intervention would also contribute novel finding address lead health behavior ( tobacco use , PA , diet ) associate morbidity mortality among minority low-income population country . The opportunity engage woman one time across multiple behavior target cost-effective way significant implication . Moreover , use technology ( cell phone ) provide support adherence program cut edge health care delivery . Cell phone cost-effective way maintain contact , provide support difficult-to-engage patient . As reviewed , tailor message deliver phone find effective change energy balance among urban African Americans . Moreover , focus study build self-efficacy structure exercise counsel initial session provide support transition behavior structure session home environment unique design optimize retention sustain behavior change . This program could profound impact reduce tobacco-related health disparity important implication develop cost-efficient way engage many patient population .</detailed_description>
