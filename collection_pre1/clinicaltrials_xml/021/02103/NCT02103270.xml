	<brief_summary>Determine whether peanut oral immunotherapy ( OIT ) induce clinical tolerance assess initial 3 month avoidance period Secondary Objectives : - Identify basic immune mechanism explain difference effect OIT desensitize vs. tolerant individual . - Determine whether immune monitoring measurement reflect underlie mechanism OIT use predict response OIT individual subject , ultimately , improve safety efficacy outcomes peanut OIT protocol .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>The Peanut Oral Immunotherapy Study : Safety , Efficacy Discovery</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>All arm undergo Initial Dose Escalation ( IDE ) Day updosing regimen maintenance phase OIT placebo maximum 4,000 mg protein daily , peanut flour , OIT group , maximum equivalent amount oat flour placebo group . After maintenance achieve , subject begin perform DBPCFCs ( stag ensure safety ) Week 104 every 13 week thereafter . At Week 104 , individual reach criterion , base randomization do start study , either stop therapy peanut switch oat flour , maintain 300 mg peanut protein per day placebo subject decrease equivalent volume oat flour ( approximately 600 mg oat flour ) optimize blind . All subject evaluate every 13 week thereafter DBPCFCs end study . Individuals Arm A define `` clinically tolerant '' clinical reactivity Week 104 Week 117 DBPCFC . Clinical reactivity define reaction ≥ Grade 1 base Bock 's Criteria . Individuals Arm A meet definition `` clinically tolerant '' continue avoid peanut protein ( i.e . continue 600 mg per day oat flour ) long subsequent DBPCFC ( perform every 13 week end study ) show clinical reactivity . Individuals Arm B define `` desensitize '' minimum 300 mg per day peanut protein show clinical reactivity DBPCFCs ( week 117 end study ) . Individuals Arm C define `` natural loss responsiveness '' show clinical reactivity DBPCFCs ( week 117 end study ) . We plan identify basic immune mechanism explain difference effect OIT individual become clinically tolerant determine whether immune monitoring predict safety efficacy outcomes peanut OIT protocol . After initial screen enrollment , three phase study : - Dose escalation Build Phase - Maintenance phase - Tolerance Desensitization Testing phase Overall , 120 subject eligible undergo Initial Dose Escalation Day . Subsequent updosing visit occur every 2 week part build-up phase . They continue updose reach 4,000 mg protein daily , maximum maintenance amount protein . We expect active OIT treatment subject reach 4,000 mg peanut protein 44-78 week . Treatment Desensitization Failures : A treatment failure define ) failure reach 1.5 mg peanut protein ( single dose ) Initial Dose Escalation Day b ) failure reach 1,000 mg peanut protein week 104 . Subjects meet criterion Week 104 demonstrate clinical reactivity consider desensitization failure . If Arm B subject demonstrate clinical reactivity DBPCFC Week 117 end study , consider desensitization failure . If Arm A subject demonstrate clinical reactivity ( ≥Grade 1 , DBPCFC Week 117 end study , consider tolerance failure . Treatment failure , desensitization failure , tolerance failure unblinded ( participant research staff ) follow end study specify study visit undergo DBPCFCs . They consider statistical analysis intent-to-treat population .</detailed_description>
