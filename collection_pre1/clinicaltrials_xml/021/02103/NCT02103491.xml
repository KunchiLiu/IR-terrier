	<brief_summary>Background : Ultradistance athlete frequently consume salt supplement competition compensate loss electrolyte sweat . The aim study investigate effectiveness oral salt supplementation improve exercise performance half-ironman triathlon . Methodology : Twenty-six experienced triathletes match age , anthropometric data training status randomly place salt group ( 113 mmol Na+ 112 mmol Cl- ) control group ( cellulose ) . The experimental treatment provide unidentifiable capsule ingest race . Participants compete real half-ironman triathlon race time measure mean chip timing . Pre post-race , body mass , maximal force whole-body isometric strength test , maximal height countermovement jump , blood sample obtain . Sweat sample obtain run section .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Participants Forty healthy well-trained triathletes recruit email internet announcement participate study . Before enrol investigation , questionnaire medical history , previous training , previous triathlon experience best race time half-ironman triathlon race fill participant . Potential participant previous history muscle disorder , cardiac kidney disease take medicine two prior week discard . Finally , twenty-six participant select match ( pair ) age , anthropometric data , train best race time . Then , equal number triathletes ( n = 13 ) randomly assign control group salt ingestion group . Main morphological variable , train status best performance time half-ironman distance similar group ( P &gt; 0.05 ; Table 1 ) . All participant inform risk discomfort associate experiment sign write consent participation investigation . The study approve Camilo Jose Cela Ethics Committee accordance late version Declaration Helsinki . Experimental Protocol Participants instruct perform light exercise avoid pain-relieving strategy ( e.g. , analgesic medication , manual massage , ice , etc ) two day race . In addition , participant instruct avoid source caffeine alcohol 24 h onset race . Three hour race , participant arrive area close start line drunk 500 mL tap water two hour arrival . Participants habitual pre-competition meal standardize among participant avoid affect participant ' pre-competition routine . However , pre-competition meal analyze afterwards content carbohydrate , protein salt similar group . On arrival , participant rest 10 minute recumbent chair 5-mL venous blood sample drawn antecubital vein . The blood allow clot centrifuge 5000g obtain serum . Participants complete 10-min standardized warm-up consist running , dynamic leg exercise practice jump . After , participant perform two countermovement vertical jump ( CMJ ) maximal height force platform ( Quattrojump , Kistler , Switzerland ) ass pre-race leg power output . On command , participant flexed knee jump high possible maintain hand waist landed foot . The high value jump height peak muscle leg power concentric phase jump use statistical analysis . Participants previously familiarize jump test . After , whole-body isometric muscle strength measure mean hand-held pull gauge ( Isocontrol Isométrico , EV-Pro , Spain ) set frequency 1000 Hz . For measurement , participant stand 50 × 50 cm iron base connect handle-bar non-elastic cable . The isometric gauge insert within cable height cable individually set provide 135º knee flexion back arm completely extend . Participants instruct perform maximal pull 3-s use whole body ( mainly legs arm ) maintain position . Verbal motivation provide test . An adjustable lumbar-back protector use support protection execution . Maximal mean isometric strength obtain test . Participants previously familiarize measurement . After , participant provide 3 plastic bag one contain 4 white capsule ( e.g. , total 12 capsule ) . In salt group , capsule fill commercially available product contains buffer electrolyte salt ( Saltstick cap , Saltstick , California US ) . The total amount electrolyte provide salt group : 2580 mg sodium ( 113 mmol ) , 3979 mg chloride ( 112 mmol ) , 756 mg potassium ( 19.3 mmol ) 132 mg magnesium ( 5.4 mmol ) . In control group , participant receive number capsule exact appearance fill isocaloric placebo ( cellulose ) . All participant instruct ingest content first bag transition swim cycling section , second bag around middle cycling leg third bag transition cycle run section . This schedule use facilitate ingestion electrolyte absorption race . Participants receive sample capsule ( fill placebo ) week race practice ingestion protocol transition cycling sector . Participants encourage ingest capsule program schedule report incidence capsule ingestion throughout race . Just 15-min race ( habitual warm-up ) , participant weigh competition clothes ( without wetsuit ) segmental bioelectrical impedance analysis perform ( BC-418 , Tanita , Japan ) predict pre-to-post race total body water change . The race start 12:00 h consist 1.9 km swimming , 75 km cycling ( 1100 net increase altitude ) 21.1 km run . Environment condition record 30-min interval mean ± SD ( range ) dry temperature event 22.5 ± 2.7ºC ( 18.8 - 26.6 ºC ) relative humidity 36.8 ± 8.3 % ( 32 - 45 % ) . The swim section perform natural lake water temperature 17.5 ± 0.3ºC . All participant wear neoprene wetsuit swim section . Participants drink consume food ad libitum swam , cycle ran pace instruction give experimenter ( apart relate capsule ingestion ) . During second transition ( cycle run leg ) , two sweat patch ( Tegaderm+Pad , 3M , US ) place forearm collect sweat sample . For purpose , participant go area locate outside transition area forearm skin clean distilled water alcohol dry clean gauze eliminate remain previous sweat skin . After , sweat patch firmly adhere skin fasten elastic tubular net bandage ( Elastofix , Insfarma , Germany ) . This process take approximately 1-min time subtract final race time participant . Within 1-min end race , participant go finish area body mass body bioelectrical impedance immediately measure use apparatus describe previously . Participants instruct avoid drinking finish line till post-race weigh experimenter assure compliance . Then , participant perform two countermovement vertical jump whole-body isometric muscle strength test , previously describe . These performance test complete within 5-min end race . Participants rest 5-min venous blood sample obtain . During rest period , sweat patch remove use clean tweezer place sterile 10 mL- tube . Sweat patch detach skin present leak discard . After protocol , rate perceive exertion race self-rated use Borg scale ( 6 20 point ) perceive leg muscle soreness self-rated use visual analog scale ( 0 10 point ) . Participants also fill detailed questionnaire fluid food intake race . Data questionnaire use calculate fluid , calorie carbohydrate intake race . With self-reported questionnaire , also calculate electrolyte intake race ( apart salt ingest capsule treatment ) . Finally , participant report incident intake capsule side-effects derive ingestion . Blood sweat sample analysis The blood allow clot situ serum separate centrifugation ( 10 min 5000 g ) frozen -80ºC day analysis . At later date , serum portion analyze osmolality ( 1249 , Advance 3MO , Spain ) , sodium , chloride , potassium magnesium concentration ( Nova 16 , NovaBiomedical , Spain ) . In addition , serum creatine kinase concentration measure blood marker muscle damage mean autoanalyzer ( AU5400 , Beckman Coulter , US ) . The sweat separate patch centrifugation ( 10 min 3000 g ) , transfer 5-mL sealed tube refrigerate 4 ºC . At later date ( within 2 day race ) , sweat osmolality measure osmometer employ serum sample sweat electrolyte concentration measure use ion selective electrode analyzer ( Cobas 6000 , Roche , Madrid , Spain ) . Statistical Analysis The normality variable initially test Shapiro-Wilk test . All variable present normal distribution . For variable obtain experiment ( race time , body mass change , sweat electrolyte concentration , self-rated fatigue muscle soreness , etc ) comparison group ( salt v control ) perform use Student 's test independent sample . For variable obtain twice experiment ( body mass , blood variable , jump performance , etc ) comparison group perform use mixed model ANOVA ( time × treatment ) repeat measure variable time . The data analyze statistical package SPSS version 19.0 ( SPSS Inc. , Chicago , IL ) . The significance level set P &lt; 0.05 . Data present mean ± SD .</detailed_description>
