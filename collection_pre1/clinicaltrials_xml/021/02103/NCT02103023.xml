	<detailed_description>Influenza pose heavy burden health service . Seasonal , zoonotic pandemic influenza constant global threat . The WHO estimate seasonal influenza cause 250,000-500,000 death worldwide year , even high mortality pandemic period . Moreover zoonotic influenza avian-origin H5N1 recently H7N9 influenza associate much high mortality seasonal influenza . Vaccine immunogenicity among elderly individual also suboptimal due immunosenescence . Various strategy include intradermal vaccination new vaccine adjuvant show improve immunogenicity . Recently , imiquimod , synthetic Toll-like receptor 7 ( TLR7 ) agonist useful treatment DNA virus infection , show improve vaccine immunogenicity influenza virus mouse model . The objective prospective double-blind randomize control trial evaluate effect safety topical treatment imiquimod immediately intradermal influenza vaccination . Our priori hypothesis imiquimod pretreatment would expedite augment immunogenicity influenza vaccination .</detailed_description>
