	<brief_summary>Even though grow interest use train Diabetes Alert Dogs ( DADs ) way monitor blood glucose type 1 diabetes ( T1D ) , scientific study confirm ability DADs accurately detect extreme high low blood sugar . The current project first preliminary investigation accuracy DADs , use scientifically rigorous research method similar require demonstrate accuracy blood glucose meter . The primary aim project test hypotheses DADs accurate detect extreme blood sugar level adult child T1D . The propose project several secondary aim , include determine : 1 ) glycemic threshold time course hypo- hyperglycemic DAD alert , 2 ) degree alert accuracy consistent across different DADs , 3 ) whether DAD owner appear experience well psychosocial status quality life compare individual T1D .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Accuracy Blood Glucose Detection Diabetes Alert Dogs</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>In propose project , DAD alert compare blood glucose ( BG ) read continuous glucose monitoring ( CGM ) device , well BG meter . CGM , BG meter , DAD alert data collect 4-wk period . CGM device `` blind '' BG reading show . This allow direct comparison objective glucose reading generate approved BG monitoring device DAD alert . This study also utilize two method measure DAD alert : ( 1 ) use event recorder mechanism CGM device , ( 2 ) collection detail qualitative data DAD alert use diary ( Daily DAD Diaries ) collect information concern occurrence , timing , type DAD alert .</detailed_description>
