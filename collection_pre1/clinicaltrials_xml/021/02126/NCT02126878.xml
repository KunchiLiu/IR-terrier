Inflammation trochanteric process femur gluteus medius tendon/ iliotibial tract cause trochanteric bursitis . Several treatment exist trochanteric bursitis , include local steroid injection . The injection consist mixture local anesthetic steroid medication . The steroid routinely mixed local anesthetic . The anesthetic act diluent steroid well act pain reliever . Various steroid preparation use , vary dos , trochanteric bursitis . The steroid preparation , triamcinolone commonly use various reason . Besides procedure associate injection site risk , risk associate use steroid , though rare , exist . Short term , steroid raise blood sugar level use caution appropriately monitor diabetic . Additionally , steroid suppress immune system . Long-term risk relate dose frequency use . These risk include thin skin , easy bruising , weight gain , elevate blood pressure , cataract formation , thin bone joint . Studies show effectiveness local steroid injection trochanteric bursitis . Unfortunately , limited data ideal dose steroid preparation . Triamcinolone 40mg/ mL commonly use , , study show effectiveness various dos , range 20 160 mg/mL .
