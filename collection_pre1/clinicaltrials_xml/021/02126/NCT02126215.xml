	<brief_summary>Hypothesis : Patients blue cerebrovascular reactivity ( CVR ) regional map hypercapnic CO2 challenge great risk develop post-operative delirium ( POD ) stroke follow major surgery . The blue CVR map show predictive POD stroke ultimately represent diagnostic test patient risk . These blue CVR map enable neurologic risk stratification patient undergo major surgery . A secondary hypothesis location extent blue CVR map strongly indicate risk neurologic sequelae operative procedure . Background : Major surgery associate significant risk postoperative morbidity mortality . POD dread complication anesthesia surgery . The prevalence delirium cardiac surgery report occur 50 % patient . Using definitive diagnostic tool Confusion Assessment Method - Intensive Care Unit ( CAM-ICU ) result high proportion report . Delirium serious complication result prolong length stay , increase health care cost , high mortality . As much $ 6.9 billion Medicare hospital expenditure attribute delirium . At cost , good diagnosis treatment urgently need . Pre-emptive diagnosis lead well management delirium post-operatively clearly one fundamental problem confront modern anesthesia peri-operative medicine . Specific Objectives : The investigator seek address ( ) identity patient great vulnerability surgery ( b ) investigate risk test appropriate risk mitigation . Understanding POD immense import help control hospital 's surgical critical care cost . Patients neurological consequence include POD often represent choke point optimize critical care utilization . At least , improve understanding diagnostic test highlight patient risk POD would welcome . Such advance would permit rational strategy limit problem allow well design therapeutic arc patient know risk . This especially important patient undergo complicate major surgery focus pilot project .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>An MRI Study Post-operative Delirium Patients Undergoing Major Surgery</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Methods : Informed witness consent obtain participant . Patients Mini Mental State Exam ( MMSE ) prior MRI study . This take 10 - 15 minute . Patients CVR map blood oxygen level dependent ( BOLD-MRI ) pulse sequence do standard RespirAct ( computer-controlled gas blender ) protocols association anatomic image 3.0 Tesla magnet . The clinical care team patient blind CVR result . Patients standardized anesthesia per usual approach major surgery standard POD assessment tool ( CAM-ICU ) . Storage anesthesia hemodynamics digital data acquisition system later collation . End-tidal CO2 target 40 mmHg surgical procedure ventilate period post-operatively . Standard fast-track protocol admission surgical special care unit ( SSCU ) undertaken facilitate patient management . Any patient obvious POD , post-op delirium stroke manage per usual protocol . Prior discharge second 3.0T CVR image sequence do - additional diffusion weight imaging ( DWI ) pulse sequencing ( sensitive approach identify low level ischemia ) . Multiple CVR map ( 650 study ) do University Health Network Toronto . As well 75 study conduct Health Sciences Centre University Manitoba past 2 year . Significance/Importance : This study potential make important contribution understand POD surgical procedure specifically window problem major surgery . A positive study base hypothesis fundamentally change understand cognitive dysfunction surgery . Large follow-up multicentre trial construct base initial finding pilot study study bear fruit . At least , elucidation POD major surgery expect study .</detailed_description>
