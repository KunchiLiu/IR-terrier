	<brief_summary>Hashimoto 's thyroiditis ( HT ) common form autoimmune thyroid disease , affect 2 % general population . The annual incidence HT worldwide estimate 0.8 - 3.5 case per 1000 person . The thyroid gland attack variety cell- antibody-mediated immune process . Various auto-antibodies may present TPO Tg , ADCC substantial factor behind apoptotic fall-out HT . Activation cytotoxic T-lymphocytes response cell-mediated immune response affect helper T-cells central thyrocyte destruction . Recent study show high pro-inflammatory cytokine serum patient HT , suggest HT associate regulatory T-cells dysfunction , imbalance ratio Th1 cell Th2 cell , overexpression Th17 cell . Several study suggest pregnant woman HT , even euthyroid state high risk spontaneous miscarriage , frequent post-partum depression higher depressive , anger , total mood disturbance risk compare without HT . Presence thyroid auto-antibodies also associate negative pregnant outcome include gestational hypertension , late abortion , fetal death , premature delivery neonatal respiratory distress . Neonates mother ATD high rate transient hypothyroidism . Children mother ATD high risk positive serum thyroid auto-antibodies development goiter thyroid dysfunction . However , suggest treatment subject HT normal thyroid function . Low-iodine diet regularly follow-up suggest . Plaquenil ( hydroxychloroquine ) anti-malarial agent , use treat several autoimmune disease , include lupus erythematosus rheumatoid arthritis century . It reduce lymphocyte , production auto-antibodies , cytokine , immune mediator , NK cell activity , inhibit antigen present CD4 T-cells B cell , dendritic cell monocytes . This study focus effect Plaquenil thyroid auto-antibodies , inflammatory marker , cytokine , goiter size euthyroid woman HT .</brief_summary>
