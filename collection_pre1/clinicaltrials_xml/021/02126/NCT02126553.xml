	<brief_title>Lenalidomide Maintenance With High Risk ( HR ) Acute Myeloid Leukemia ( AML ) Remission</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Study Drug Administration : If find eligible take part study , take lenalidomide mouth water 1 time day 28-day cycle . If doctor think need , amount lenalidomide take study may increase . Study VisitsL Every month first 3 month , every 3 month Month 12 , every 6 month , physical exam . Blood ( 2-3 teaspoon ) draw routine test 1-2 time every week Cycle 1 , every 2-4 week Cycles 2-6 , every 4 week . After cycle 1 , 3 month therapy , every 3 month Cycle 12 , every 6 month , bone marrow aspiration/biopsy check status disease . This may perform time doctor think need . As part study , enrol special program call REMS inform risk lenalidomide pregnancy . As part program , require regular pregnancy test female able child . Length Treatment : You may continue take study drug 24 cycle long doctor think best interest . You longer able take study drug disease get bad , intolerable side effect occur , unable follow study direction . This investigational study . Lenalidomide FDA approve commercially available treatment myelodysplastic syndrome ( MDS ) multiple myeloma ( MM ) . Its use patient high risk AML remission investigational . Up 50 participant enrol multicenter study . All take part MD Anderson .</detailed_description>
