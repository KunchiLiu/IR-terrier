	<detailed_description>This study multisite , randomize , double-blind , placebo-controlled , phase 2 study MG01CI ( low high dos metadoxine daily ) 6 week compare placebo 1:1 ratio 60 adolescent adult subject FXS . Following Screening , subject randomize MG01CI match placebo Baseline ( Day 0 ) 6 week Double-blind Treatment Period begin Day 1 . The first 4 week treatment period dose-optimization period , subject 's dose MG01CI placebo optimize . Investigators subject blind regard whether subject take active drug placebo . Subjects blind anticipate dose ( low vs high dose ) , Investigators blind anticipate dose , low dose v high dose . Every two week subject receive 2-week supply treatment . A phone follow-up assessment safety tolerability occur titration 1 3 week treatment ; investigator significant concern regard safety tolerability , subject assess site unscheduled visit . All subject assess site 2 week 4 week treatment . All subject start either low dose match blind placebo ( 2 tablet daily ) . At weekly visits/phone assessment , investigator evaluate dose base upon investigator 's assessment safety tolerability . If subject demonstrate safety tolerability concern low dose 1 2 week treatment , subject discontinue . If concern safety tolerability 2 week treatment , dose increase 2 tablet either high dose active treatment placebo . If high dose concern safety tolerability , dose either keep reduce low dose remainder treatment period . The last 2 week treatment period dose-maintenance period . During dose-maintenance period , subject maintain optimal dose determined end dose-optimization period . A phone follow-up assessment safety tolerability occur 5 week treatment ( 1 week dose maintenance ) . If investigator significant concern regard safety tolerability , subject assess site unscheduled visit . The subject assess site 6 week treatment ( 2 week dose maintenance ) . There 2-week Follow-up Period last dose study treatment early termination .</detailed_description>
