	<brief_summary>The purpose study evaluate feasibility effectiveness acupuncture treatment phantom limb syndrome low limb amputee pilot acupuncture protocol . The study comparative effectiveness study compare acupuncture standard care versus standard care alone randomise control trial use mixed method approach . The study hypothesis course acupuncture reduce symptom phantom limb syndrome lower limb amputee . The study base Amputee Rehabilitation Unit , London . Twenty low limb amputee phantom limb syndrome randomly assign either receive usual care usual care plus acupuncture . Acupuncture intervention include 8 treatment 4 week treatment involve use body auricular acupuncture point . Usual care include physiotherapy , occupational therapy , pharmacological intervention intervention deem appropriate clinical staff . An eleven point numerical rating scale primary outcome measure study . Secondary outcome measure include Short Form McGill Pain Questionnaire 2 , EQ-5D-5L , Hospital Anxiety Depression Scale , Perceived Stress Scale , Insomnia Severity Index , Participant Global Impression Change information also obtain rescue medication . A cheek swab also take explore potential subgroup responder relation genetic polymorphism glucocorticoid receptor . Outcomes recorded weekly duration study one three month post completion study . In order identify protocol acceptability acceptability outcome measure five participant interview post completion study . Data also inform feasibility recruitment rate , completion rate reason dropout . Data study guide development full randomise controlled trial .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The feasibility study comparative effectiveness study . A randomised control trial ( RCT ) use mixed method approach employed evaluate effect acupuncture phantom limb syndrome . The RCT open pragmatic effectiveness trial , parallel fix size design usual care control . It unstratified , balance randomization ( 1:1 ) . It conduct Amputee Rehabilitation Unit ( ARU ) Lambeth Community Care Centre , London , UK . Quantitative data collect use standardise , validate outcome measure . Qualitative data collect post completion study one one semi-structured interview . Twenty participant approach recruit whilst inpatient ARU . Those felt meet inclusion criterion identify key contact rehabilitation team . Potential participant approach researcher , provide verbal write information study advise take seven day consider wish participate study . No consent obtain time provide information study . Participants consent involve study screen eligibility eligible randomly assign either , usual care plus acupuncture ( group A ) usual care ( group B ) . Randomisation allocation concealment use ensure selection bias . A computer generate random number table use study randomisation unstratified balance ( 1:1 ) . Allocation concealment implement use sequentially number , opaque , seal envelope . Randomisation allocation concealment generate researcher directly involve study . As study pragmatic group receive usual care . Usual care include medical intervention , physiotherapy / rehabilitation intervention use ARU . Group A receive usual care standard course acupuncture ( already agree expert panel acupuncture practitioner ) . Group B receive standard care . The acupuncture intervention study pragmatic strict guideline adhere within pragmatic approach . These guideline develop though current literature Delphi study acupuncture practitioner consist specific acupuncture point point select patient accord Chinese diagnosis . Acupuncture guideline include : - Using combination body auricular acupuncture - Treating opposite limb amputation possibly also residual limb - Using auricular acupuncture point shen men , sympathetic , point correspond low limb - Using body acupuncture point around stump ( depend health tissue patient ) , mirror local distal point needle opposite limb , point low back take segmental approach dermatomal pain - Including point ; LI4 + LR3 , LR3 , GV20 , SP10 individual specific point accord specific symptom - Electro-acupuncture may use - Retaining needle 20-30 minute - Treating twice weekly four week At commencement study group A group B participant baseline demographic data collect researcher group A , full Traditional Chinese Medicine Assessment complete acupuncture practitioner administer treatment . In group initial outcome measure also complete time cheek swab take . For duration study outcome measure collect weekly group researcher . Outcome measure also collect one three month post completion study assess long term effect acupuncture intervention . At two time point participant post questionnaire complete return researcher . In order identify protocol acceptability acceptability outcomes meaningful participant would potentially demonstrate impact acupuncture future trial , five participant consult post completion study . This phase study take qualitative approach comprise one semi-structured interview . This approach take allow participant time develop account issue important aim generate detail data . If participant still inpatient ARU time interview interview take place . If participant discharge interview take place participant 's home follow outpatient appointment . Data analysis test within-patient group difference measurement take begin study , study , end one month three month post completion study . An intention treat approach take . In order include miss data impute use last observation carry forward ( LOCF ) . Analysis primary outcome measure ( numerical pain rating scale ) : As numerical rating scale produce ordinal data , median range value evaluate . Raw change percentage change calculate . A 95 % confidence interval use study . Statistical analysis perform verify rejection null hypothesis P value 0.05 select indicative statistical significance . As data ordinal small sample size non-parametric test use analysis . ( Non parametric test use small sample sizes condition hard see data normally distribute ) . The non-parametric Mann Whitney U test use analysis group . Difference baseline last observation score analyse use Wilcoxon signed-ranks test . All analysis undertake use SPSS Version 21 software . Analysis secondary outcome measure : As secondary outcome produce ordinal data treat numerical rating scale report median range value use nonparametric test list . A P value 0.05 consider indicative statistical significance . Baseline characteristic : Categorical data ( gender ethnicity ) show n ( % ) . As study small expect data normally distribute therefore continuous data ( age duration PLSd ) show median range value . Categorical baseline characteristic analyse use Fisher 's exact test ( data categorical / nominal unrelated ) . Continuous data analyse use Mann-Whitney U test . As outcome measure P value 0.05 select indicative statistical significance . Feasibility Study Specific : Compliance protocol examine number count drop out / nonattendance completion rate outcome measure deviation protocol . Qualitative data analysis : Framework analysis use analyse data semi-structured interview . NVIVO 10 software use data analysis . Data analysis transparent , comparative reflexive . Analysis focus latent content text . Transcripts read researcher completely familiar data . Data cod , analytical framework develop . Data indexed analytical framework , chart map . Reporting : Consolidated Standards Reporting Trials ( CONSORT ) guideline adhere reporting . The STandards Reporting Interventions Clinical Trials Acupuncture ( STRICTA ) comprise checklist expands generic content CONSORT statement include information acupuncture intervention also use study . Information record style acupuncture , reason treatment provide , extent treatment vary , number needle insertion per subject per session , name point use , depth insertion , response seek , needle stimulation , needle retention time , needle type ( diameter , length , manufacturer material ) , number treatment session , frequency duration treatment session , detail intervention administer ( e.g . lifestyle advise ) , setting context treatment , practitioner background , precise description rationale control .</detailed_description>
