	<detailed_description>Epilepsy serious disease . It affect approximately 2.4 million Americans , lifetime risk estimate 3 % . More 181,000 Americans develop epilepsy every year , substantial proportion seizure control available medication . For vast majority patient epilepsy , understand biological basis disease ; know whether give anti-epileptic drug ( AED ) effective ; predict severity seizure disorder , potential emergence co-morbidities , likelihood remission . The Human Epilepsy Project seek answer unknowns collect high-resolution clinical information treatment response , MRIs , EEGs , blood urine sample biomarkers . A major outcome project create open data repository clinical information biologic sample future study . HEP may transformative impact epilepsy diagnosis treatment identify critical clinical feature biomarkers onset epilepsy use predict outcome guide therapy . We hope identify subset patient high risk pharmacoresistance may benefit aggressive initial therapy earlier consideration surgical treatment . The existence biomarkers predict likelihood disease remission would dramatically affect treatment decision counsel million patient . In addition impact current clinical care , data specimen collect HEP , include sequential neuroimaging , electrophysiology metabolite profile , bank DNA purpose future genomics study , potential provide new insight biological basis focal epilepsy , advance effort discover effective treatment cure disorder .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Clinical seizure ( ) history consistent focal epilepsy At least two confirm spontaneous seizure , least 24 hour apart , 12 month prior enrollment Complete AED history prior enrollment ( approximate date dos ) available ( exception make AEDs take &lt; 1 week ) Age ≥12 year ≤60 year time seizure onset Age ≥12 year ≤60 year time enrollment Treatment institute 4 month prior enrollment One following : 1 . Normal MRI interictal EEG show focal abnormality ( focal sharp wave focal slow ) 2 . Normal MRI normal interictal EEG , clinical electrographic seizure activity ictal EEG 3 . Definitive clinical history recurrent seizures consistent focal epilepsy , adjudicated central reviewer , normal MRI normal EEG 4 . Focal lesion ( nonprogressive ) MRI normal EEG ( acceptable focal lesion include MTS , FCD , single cavernoma , AVMs large size lack significant amount hemosiderin ) Idiopathic symptomatic generalize epilepsy Any epilepsy etiology could produce significant gliosis brain injury would likely alter biomarkers . These include : 1 . Epilepsy etiology occur previous two year would produce significant CNS injury ( e.g. , traumatic brain injury involve direct disruption brain tissue , stroke , encephalitis ) 2 . History intracranial bleeding ( e.g. , subarachnoid , intraparenchymal ) Identified genetic epilepsy syndrome Presence moderate great developmental cognitive delay prior seizure onset ( e.g. , adolescent , selfcontained classroom ; IQ document , &gt; 70 ) History chronic drug alcohol abuse within last 2 year IGE/focal epilepsy mixed syndrome Progressive neurological disorder ( brain tumor , AD , PME , etc . ) Major medical comorbidities renal failure require dialysis , metastatic cancer , HIV , significant liver renal disease Autism Spectrum Disorder Seizures pregnancy History previous current significant psychiatric disorder would interfere conduct study</criteria>
