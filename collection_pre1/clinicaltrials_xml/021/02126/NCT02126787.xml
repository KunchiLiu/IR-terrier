	<brief_title>Short-term , Intensive Psychodynamic Group Therapy Versus Cognitive-behavioral Group Therapy Day Treatment</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Anxiety disorder among prevalent mental disorder , lifetime prevalence 30 % US ( Kessler et al. , 2005 ) 9,9 % Poland ( Moskalewicz , Wciórka , Kiejna , Wojtyniak , 2012 ) , study similar methodology , like U.S . Many study suggest strong comorbidity personality disorder country . Recent meta-analysis 125 study conduct Friborg , Martinussen , Kaiser , Overgård Rosenvinge ( 2013 ) show risk comorbid anxiety disorder personality disorder vary 35 % 52 % . Alongside anxiety disorder , frequently co-occurring cluster C personality disorder . Epidemiologic study also show high comorbidity rate anxiety depressive disorder , range 40 % -80 % ( Jacobi et al. , 2004 ; Lamers et al. , 2011 ) . The data relationship comorbid mental disorder treatment outcome inconsistent . Reviews Reich Green ( 1991 ) Reich Vasile ( 1993 ) include 38 study show comorbid anxiety disorder personality disorder negatively related treatment outcome . However , Dressen Arntz ( 1997 ) analyze 15 study share conclusion . Day treatment care direct precisely patient need treatment great intensity treat outpatient care . Group psychotherapy ( often use together pharmacotherapy ) employ day care since 1940s ( cf . Cameron 1947 ; Goldman , 1989 ) . This form therapy choose economic basis . The treatment usually take place day week last several month . Different type psychotherapy different treatment method ( e.g . therapeutic community , psychodrama , art therapy , psycho-drawing , movie therapy , social skill train ) often apply together . In Poland , group psychotherapy widely use day care . Nowadays 300 ward exist Poland . Psychotherapy anxiety disorder personality disorder lasting month ( often three month ) provide approximately 8000 patient year ( IPIN , 2009 ) . The effectiveness day care investigate small degree , compare frequent usage ( cf . Marshall et al 2001 ) . However , difficulty identify basic effective component treatment large diversity treatment program make difficult generalize result . Among scarce number publish study , four randomize control trial ( RCT ) . Three study compare psychotherapy day care unit outpatient psychotherapy ( Tyler et al. , 1987 ; Dick et al. , 1991 ; Arnevik et al. , 2009 ) one study use wait list control group ( Piper , Rosie , Azim , &amp; Joyce , 1993 ) . Tyler et al . ( 1987 ) find significant difference day care outpatient care anxiety disorder . Dick et al . ( 1991 ) find significant difference improvement personality disorder pathology , favor day care . In first study psychotherapy modality mention , second eclectic psychotherapy apply . In another study Arnevik et al . ( 2009 ) , day care ( 18 week group psychodynamic cognitive-behavioral psychotherapy ) compare individual psychotherapy patient personality disorder significant difference improvement observe two group . Piper et al . ( 1993 ) find day care patient suffer affective disorder personality disorder experience significant improvement continue follow-up 8 month ( 18 week group psychodynamic psychotherapy ) , compare patient wait list control group . Authors Cochrane review day care versus outpatient care notice small number exist study : `` limited evidence justify provision day treatment program transitional day hospital care , evidence support provision day care center '' ( Marshall et al . 2001 ) . Existing data therefore sufficient justify use group psychotherapy day care , high quality research need . The question treatment two widely use , psychodynamic CBT , effective also await answer . These question relevant light large expenditure incur national health fund finance treatment . They also important health care Poland , type treatment common . Objectives The main objective plan research evaluate clinical effectiveness intensive , short-term , psychodynamic cognitive-behavioral group psychotherapy anxiety disorder comorbid depressive personality disorder day care condition . More specific objective : 1 ) Demonstrating effectiveness treatment day care set relative wait-list control ; 2 ) Demonstrating relative short- long-term effectiveness two active treatment ; 3 ) Preliminary examination predictor moderator treatment response ; 4 ) Preliminary examination mediator therapeutic change ; 5 ) Detailed comparison impact method treatment outcome use measure . Study design This study randomize control trial ( RCT ) participant allocate one three condition : 1 ) psychodynamic group therapy ; 2 ) cognitive-behavioral group therapy ; 3 ) waiting-list control group ( WL ) . Participants allocate wait list condition start treatment 12-week waiting period . The total duration study three year . Figure 1 show trial design .

The study carry day unit Wola Center Mental Health Hospital Wola Warsaw use clinical set II Department Psychiatry Medical University Warsaw . Participants ( recruitment , inclusion exclusion criterion , randomization ) Participants anxiety disorder comorbid personality disorder recruit outpatient clinic . Subjects meet inclusion criterion randomize two modality treatment wait list . Inclusion exclusion criterion list Table 1 . The number exclude patient reason exclusion record . The diagnostic criterion base DSM-V system . Independent researcher involve treatment make diagnosis personality Structured Clinical Interview DSM-IV Axis II Disorders ( SCID-II ; First , Gibbon , Spitzer , Williams , Benjamin , 1997 , 2010 ) clinical disorder International Neuropsychiatric Interview 5 ( M.I.N.I . ; Sheehan et al. , 1998 ; Masiak &amp; Przychoda , 1998 ) . Diagnosis qualification treatment modality carry ambulatory session . Up 6 individual session require recruitment procedure include 3 session certify clinical psychologist , 2 session psychiatrist , one outcome measure . Pharmacological consultation take place randomization . Waiting time admission plan 4 8 week . Participants randomize use random number table . Baseline measurement occur day begin therapy . A recruitment flow chart present Figure 1 . Patients plan enrolled study period three year . Before participate study , patient provide write information study invite give write consent inclusion . Participants meet inclusion criterion offer suitable alternative treatment option . The focus treatment psychotherapy , medication continue initiated necessary screening procedure least 4 week begin group psychotherapy ( stable medical treatment SSRI SNRI without dose change psychotherapy ) . Due high comorbidity anxiety depressive disorder , depressive disorder patient mild depression disorder exclude , however patient main depressive pathology include . Assessments Patients subject 4 assessment : 1 ) screening ; 2 ) baseline randomization ; 3 ) end 12 week treatment ; 4 ) six month end therapy , order evaluate longer-term effect treatment . Information screen use perform stratify randomization validate inclusion exclusion criterion . Patients assessed independent trained clinician , blind treatment condition involve direct clinical care . Primary outcome measure secondary outcome measure distinguish study . Primary outcome measure include self-report symptom anxiety , observer rat symptoms anxiety , global improvement dichotomize diagnosis anxiety disorder . Secondary outcome measure include personality , depression , self-esteem , defense mechanism , belief self others , interpersonal problem , object relation , parental bonding , meta-cognition , mindfulness quality life . The following socio-demographic data collect : sex , age , marital status , education , past treatment , symptom history , medication . We also examine patient ' expectancy change treatment .
