	<brief_summary>The long-term objective research prophylactic approach reduce incidence fall result injury among old adult risk thus reduce escalate medical cost . This project explore perturbation training use treadmill device motor learn approach , experience slip-like perturbation generate treadmill use prepare motor system develop put use fall-resisting skill outside training environment ( cross-environment transfer ) . The computer-controlled treadmill portable , safe easy operate , thus conducive use clinic community center . The study logically build complement team 's previous current research program , test single session , old adult risk retain cross-environment transfer reduce likelihood fall everyday live next 6 12 month . Finally , study explore reduction fall come merely person ' familiarity training test setup , protocol environment .</brief_summary>
