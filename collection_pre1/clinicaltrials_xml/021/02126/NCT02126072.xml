	<detailed_description>A common finding trauma patient admit ER serious injury presence alcohol abuse . Alcohol involve 40 % death motor vehicle crash , 60 % deaths intentional injury , 50 % hospital admission injury . Chronic alcohol consumption lead decrease gut wall integrity actively drink alcoholic patient alcohol induce liver disease . Animal study show mucosal damage cause alcohol consumption increase permeability gut macromolecule . This facilitate translocation endotoxin bacterial toxin gut lumen portal circulation . In addition increase endotoxemia study show initial event response alcohol increase influx leukocyte lead enhanced release noxious mediator , reactive oxygen specie , leukotrienes histamine mast cell . Alcohol consumption thus lead decrease gut wall integrity increase endotoxemia result induces inflammatory response . Data effect acute alcohol consumption gut wall integrity non-alcoholics still scarce . In patient expose severe trauma , loss gut wall integrity implicate important contributor development excessive inflammation [ 6 ] . Intestinal mucosal damage develop early trauma leading loss gut wall integrity result translocation luminal bacteria toxin gut wall . This associated development inflammatory response . This excessive inflammation turn lead systemic inflammatory response syndrome ( SIRS ) ultimately lead multiple organ failure ( MOF ) death . Up 20 % death trauma patient due consequence SIRS MOF . When assess effect alcohol severe trauma gut wall integrity combine fact two co-exist frequently one hypothesize outcome trauma patient influence alcohol detrimental . Literature regard issue unequivocal , consist relatively small retrospective series . Population ( base ) 15 healthy adult male human volunteer include study Inclusion criterion - male volunteer - age 18 60 year - write informed consent Exclusion criterion - medical history alcohol abuse - use medication - medical history bowel disease Volunteers confirm meet inclusion criterion sign informed consent . Sample size calculation As currently data available effect alcohol gut wall integrity measure FABP investigator conduct pilot study . The chosen population size 15 volunteer base upon financial organisational benefit . Investigational product/treatment Subjects consume either 1g/kg wine ( 12 % ) 600 ml water within 45 minute . METHODS Main study parameter/endpoint Primary Objective : The aim study determine immediate effect oral alcohol consumption healthy volunteer gut wall integrity measure I-FABP LBP . The gut wall integrity assess use I-FABP measure integrity enterocyte . Lipopolysaccharide bind protein ( LBP ) , protein bind LPS , serve measure endotoxemia . Furthermore , effect alcohol gut wall integrity marker per se assess artificially add alcohol blood compare non-alcoholised blood . The following 'patient ' characteristic acquire assess possible effect FABP/LBP level correct variance witness : age , weight , length , body temperature race . Study procedure After informed consent fifteen healthy adult male volunteer , age 18-60 , participate study . They randomize two group : one consume alcohol , consume water ( see ) . One week later , group switch Volunteers medical history alcohol abuse bowel disease subject use medication exclude study . Volunteers fast 6 hour sample obtain reproducible alcohol uptake . To avoid dehydration hypoglycaemia , volunteer allow drink tea , water clear fruit juice 2 hour sample . Blood sampling : volunteer two sample blood collect without additive . The first sample ( S1 ) 14 ml blood divide two half : 5ml blood analyze gut wall integrity without addition ethanol , 5 ml analyze addition 5 µl 96 % pure ethanol obtain blood concentration 1‰ ethanol . After first sample volunteer randomize drink either 1 g/kg ethanol wine ( 12 gr/100 ml ) obtain blood alcohol level 1 ‰ drink amount water . The beverage consume maximum 45 minute . Thirty minute last glass beverage consume , second sample ( S2 ) 8 ml blood collect . The next 4 sample take one hour interval ( S3 , S4 , S5 S6 respectively ) . The last sample take second visit 19:00 day . One week visit protocol repeat alcohol water group cross . In sample I-FABP , L-FABP , LBP , IL-6 , ALT , AST , GGT measure well alcohol permillage . Withdrawal individual subject Subjects leave study time reason wish without consequence . Any data collect far destroy . The investigator decide withdraw subject study urgent medical reason . Replacement individual subject withdrawal Replacement individual withdraw whatever reason take place necessary . This conclude analysis do pilot study . Replacement take place subject able complete protocol . SAFETY REPORTING In accordance section 10 , subsection 1 , WMO , investigator inform subject review accredit METC anything occur , basis appear disadvantage participation may significantly great foreseen research proposal . The study suspend pending review accredit METC , except insofar suspension would jeopardise subject ' health . The investigator take care subject keep informed . Adverse serious adverse event Adverse event define undesirable experience occur subject study . All adverse event report spontaneously subject observe investiga¬tor staff record . A serious adverse event untoward medical occurrence effect dose : - result death ; - life threaten ( time event ) ; - require hospitalisation prolongation exist inpatient ' hospitalisation ; - result persistent significant disability incapacity ; - congenital anomaly birth defect ; - new event trial likely affect safety subject , unexpected outcome adverse reaction , lack efficacy IMP use treatment life threaten disease , major safety find newly complete animal study , etc . All SAEs report web portal ToetsingOnline accredit METC approve protocol , within 15 day sponsor first knowledge serious adverse reaction . SAEs result death life threaten report expedite . The expedited reporting occur later 7 day responsible investigator first knowledge adverse reaction . This preliminary report another 8 day completion report . Suspected unexpected serious adverse reaction ( SUSAR ) Adverse reaction untoward unintended response investigational product relate dose administer . Unexpected adverse reaction adverse reaction , nature , severity , consistent applicable product information ( e.g . Investigator 's Brochure unapproved IMP Summary Product Characteristics ( SPC ) authorise medicinal product ) . The sponsor report expedite follow SUSARs web portal ToetsingOnline METC : - SUSARs arisen clinical trial assess METC ; - SUSARs arisen clinical trial sponsor medicinal product , could consequences safety subject involve clinical trial assess METC .
