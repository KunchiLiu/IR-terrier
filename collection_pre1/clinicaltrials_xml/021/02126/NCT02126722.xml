	<brief_summary>H. pylori infection important causative agent gastritis , subsequent atrophic gastritis . The endoscopic diagnosis H. pylori infection relies urease test Clo test . However , treatment proton pump inhibitor ( PPI ) impair diagnostic yeld urease test . The EndoFaster test ( NISO BioMed , Turin , Italy ) new technology advantage , conventional urease test , real-time analysis gastric juice provide information regard Helicobacter pylori infection pH value gastric content . A well design clinical study therefore warrant fully assess performance EndoFaster test detect H. pylori infection patient treat PPI . We aim perform clinical study adult population United Kingdom order determine diagnostic accuracy Endo Faster test compare Clo test , histological diagnosis faecal antigen test evaluate H.pylori infection . Patients PPI undergo gastroscopy multiple biopsy exam NISO Biomed EndoFaster test , well Clo test , carry . H. pylori faecal antigen test also perform use gold standard . Diagnostic accuracy different method determine .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Urease test Clo test diagnosis Helicobacter pylorus infection widely use simple , cheap , easy carry ( 1 , 2 ) . They perform endoscopic exam give relatively rapid result . However , treatment proton pump inhibitor ( PPI ) may alter result change milieu bacteria present , especially antrum , render inhospitable consequent decrease bacterial load . In addition , PPI may antiurease property ( 3 ) . Another reason false-negative result presence intestinal metaplasia ( 4 ) , also correspond inhospitable environment Helicobacter pylorus . EndoFaster test new technology advantage , conventional urease test , real-time analysis gastric juice provide information regard Helicobacter pylori infection pH value gastric content . Sensitivity , specificity , PPV NPV EndoFaster test Helicobacter pylorus infection result 98.5 % , 87.6 % , 84.4 % 98.8 % , respectively . This test may accurate conventional urease test diagnosis Helicobacter pylorus infection subject PPI indeed increase analyse area , thereby allow evaluate bacterial density gastric antrum corpus . No data currently available performance EndoFaster test subject PPI well-designed clinical study warrant . The main aim study conduct comparative study NISO BioMed EndoFaster test , urease-based test ( Clo test ) , histologic diagnosis faecal antigen test ( use gold standard ) diagnosis Helicobacter pylori infection PPI-treated patient . We perform clinical study use NISO BioMed Endofaster test diagnose Helicobacter pylorus infection patient PPI therapy . The study conduct collaboration NISO BioMed ( Turin , Italy ) Homerton University Hospital ( London , UK ) . The study perform Homerton Hospital . One hundred patient PPI enrol among patient dyspepsia refer gastroscopy Homerton University Hospital ( London , United Kingdom ) . A control group 50 patient dyspepsia , PPI , also enrol study . On day endoscopic procedure patient bring stool sample detection Helicobacter pylorus antigen . Subsequently , gastroscopy multiple biopsy perform exam NISO Biomed EndoFaster test , well Clo test , carry . Directed biopsy collect antrum corpus , follow protocol Operative Link Gastritis Assessment ( OLGA ) Sydney classification chronic gastritis . Biopsies examine Pathology laboratory University College London Hospital interpret use OLGA stag system well Sydney system classification gastritis ( 5-8 ) . The performance EndoFaster test diagnosis Helicobacter pylorus infection compare Clo test , histologic diagnosis faecal antigen test . In particular , statistical analysis consist calculation performance indicator EndoFaster test , include ROC analysis cut-off value give optimal sensitivity/specificity balance . The principal goal clinical study establish performance EndoFaster test detect Helicobacter pylori infection rate study population . For endpoint , calculate sensitivity ( SE ) , specificity ( SP ) , negative predictive value ( NPV ) , positive predictive value ( PPV ) AUC ( area ROC curve ) , collectively individually 4 test . ROC analysis use estimate best SE/SP balance single test . One aim establish best cut-offs order give EndoFaster test optimal performance . Additionally , clinically significant condition ( gastric atrophy , intestinal metaplasia , gastric cancer ) record association rate Helicobacter pylorus infection study ( 9,10 ) . The necessary preparation study execution Homerton University Hospital NHS Foundation Trust start immediately hospital reach agreement NISO BIOMED . The study plan necessitate review institutional review board ( IRB , Ethical Committee ) permission start . We aim obtain unbiased ( i.e. , 100 % confirm gold standard , i.e . faecal antigen test ) estimate performance EndoFaster test detect Helicobacter pylori infection rate patient PPI treatment . This include determine optimal cut-offs give optimal SE/SP balance detect study endpoint . Application cut-offs clinical practice would lead optimised performance EndoFaster test .</detailed_description>
