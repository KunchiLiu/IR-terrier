	<brief_summary>Preclinical study provide strong support concept fast evokes resistance multiple form stress . Fasting reduces plasma level growth factor modulate intracellular nutrient sense system , thereby divert energy growth maintenance . Accordingly , currently available preclinical evidence suggest short-term fasting protects normal cell peril chemotherapy . In contrast , cancer cell protect , result self-sufficiency growth signal . This phenomenon term Differential Stress Resistance ( DSR ) . DSR reduce severity toxic side-effects chemotherapy interestingly , simultaneously render cancer cell vulnerable chemotherapeutics . Importantly , extensive preclinical evidence preliminary clinical data indicate specifically design low calorie , low amino acid substitution diet ( `` Fasting Mimicking Diet , FMD '' ) effect cancer therapy similar fasting . This study aim evaluate impact FMD tolerance efficacy neoadjuvant chemotherapy woman stage II III breast cancer .</brief_summary>
