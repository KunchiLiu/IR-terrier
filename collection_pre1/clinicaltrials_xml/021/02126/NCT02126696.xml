	<detailed_description>Background Owing successful scale-up decentralization anti-retroviral therapy ( ART ) rural Lesotho , number person infect HIV stay alive increase dramatically . The new situation HIV turn deadly disease chronic manageable condition create new challenge health care provider rural facility country . Patients long-time ART may suffer comorbidities endanger success ART health and/or ART-failure due development resistance virus . The magnitude burden comorbidities well ART- failure examine extensively Lesotho yet . Objectives Study The study six major objective : 1 . To assess prevalence virologic failure genotype-resistance HIV among patient ART rural Lesotho . 2 . To assess prevalence hepatitis C hepatitis B among patient ART rural facility Lesotho 3 . To assess prevalence diabetes mellitus , arterial hypertension dyslipidaemia among patient ART rural facility Lesotho 4 . To assess prevalence depression alcohol use disorder among patient ART rural facility Lesotho 5 . To examine association chronic comorbidities virologic outcome among patient ART rural Lesotho 6 . To follow-up patient virologic failure and/or comorbidity ( y ) among patient ART rural Lesotho Design/Methods The study plan take place two district Lesotho : Botha-Bothe Thaba-Tseka . Prevalence select comorbidities measure cross-sectional , facility-based survey eight health center two hospital two district . Patients detectable viral load receive enhance adherence counsel second viral load measurement 2-3 month . In case confirm virologic failure , genotype resistance test do patient switch second-line . Patients specific comorbidities patient virologic failure switch second-line ART followed-up cohort study 12-18 month survey . Expected Results Impact Prevalence select comorbidities inform Ministry Health well implement partner chronic condition might urgent addressed among patient ART Lesotho national HIV-programme may use leverage chronic condition . Data virologic failure inform prevalence virologic failure among previously virologically monitored cohort . Moreover provide data resistance pattern among patient fail first-line ART one-year outcome switch second-line regimen .</detailed_description>
