	<brief_summary>This phase I clinical trial study side effect best dose auranofin sirolimus give together treat patient non-small cell lung cancer . Immunosuppressive therapy , auranofin sirolimus , may effective treatment non-small cell lung cancer . Sirolimus may also stop growth tumor cell block enzymes need cell growth . Giving auranofin sirolimus may effective treatment non-small cell lung cancer .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Auranofin Sirolimus Treating Patients With Advanced Solid Tumors Recurrent Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To determine maximally tolerate dose ( MTD ) auranofin plus sirolimus ( Cohort I ) . II . To determine confirm response rate auranofin plus sirolimus ( Cohort II ) . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . To describe adverse event toxicity profile associate treatment combination . II . To evaluate response , time progression , progression-free survival ( PFS ) , overall survival ( OS ) , time treatment failure patient treat treatment combination . TERTIARY OBJECTIVES : I . To evaluate tumor biomarkers protein kinase C ( PKC ) mammalian target rapamycin ( mTOR ) signal activity predictor clinical outcome ( i.e . response , PFS , OS ) patient receive auranofin/sirolimus therapy . II . To evaluate use surrogate biomarkers PKC mTOR inhibition peripheral blood lymphocyte ( PBLs ) predictor clinical outcome ( i.e . response , PFS , OS ) patient receive auranofin/sirolimus therapy . OUTLINE : This cohort I , dose-escalation study follow cohort II study . Patients receive auranofin orally ( PO ) daily ( QD ) sirolimus PO QD day 1-28 . Courses repeat every 28 day absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . After completion study treatment , patient follow every 3-6 month 2 year .</detailed_description>
