	<brief_summary>Acute pancreatitis ( AP ) common disease whose incidence US reach 35 per 100,000 population annually . Its main cause adult gallstone migration common bile duct alcohol abuse . Approximately 80 % patient AP develop mild disease management mainly conservative . However 20 % develop severe form , know associate development local complication , pancreatic peripancreatic necrosis , pseudocysts , systemic complication , adult respiratory distress syndrome renal failure . In severe form AP mortality rate reach 17 % mainly due multiple organ failure pancreatic necrosis . In particular , pancreatic necrosis associate death rate 40 % . Epidural anesthesia ( EA ) widely use induce analgesia perioperative period also use decrease pain patient AP . In addition , experimental study show specific beneficial effect EA AP , attribute anti-inflammatory effect local anesthetic administer epidural space combine sympathetic nerve blockade , redistribute splanchnic blood flow non-perfused pancreatic region . To date , EA adequately test intensive care unit ( ICU ) patient severe AP , regard clinical outcome . The objective study therefore test effect EA lung dysfunction severe AP , hypothesize EA could limit lung failure require invasive mechanical ventilation ( MV ) duration invasive MV</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>BACKGROUND : Mild acute pancreatitis low mortality rate , patient severe acute pancreatitis ( AP ) likely complication much high death rate . Severe pancreatic injury occur 20 % patient , 15 % 25 % patient survive . The amplify effect inflammatory oxidative impairment often lead SAP-induced complication , often regard hallmark severe AP herald note poor outcome . Since respiratory failure main cause death patient severe AP , work need u prevent treat AP-associated lung dysfunction Despite recent substantial improvement multidisciplinary management AP ( special emphasis fluid therapy , intensive care management , prevention infectious complication , nutritional support , biliary tract management necrotizing pancreatitis management ) , prognosis severe AP remain poor patient develop acute respiratory failure require intubation invasive respiratory support . Animal study suggest epidural analgesia ( EA ) may decrease severity AP . EA associate sympathetic nerve blockade , redistribute splanchnic blood flow non-perfused pancreatic region , may improve pancreatic hypoperfusion induce AP . EA also decrease severity metabolic acidosis tissue injury , thus prevent progression edematous disease necrotizing AP . To date , EA adequately test patient severe AP compare conventional management , special emphasis putative beneficial ventilatory effect . DESIGN NARRATIVE : The purpose multicenter , prospective , randomize , control , trial test effect thoracic EA pulmonary outcome patient severe AP . After inclusion , ICU patient severe AP randomize 2 group : `` conventional group `` available guideline analgesia apply , `` EA `` group patient receive thoracic EA least 3 day . Beyond analgesic strategy , recent consensual guideline management severe AP apply .</detailed_description>
