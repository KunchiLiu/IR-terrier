	<brief_summary>Children chronic kidney disease , even transplantation , may risk bone problem due imbalance calcium phosphorus blood , especially kidneys progressively fail function . While drug diet treatment available prevent bone disease , many child refuse take due bad taste tummy cramp . If calcium phosphorus status remain abnormal long time , hard crystal form blood vessel , eventually clog result heart problem . Investigators study possible new method help kidneys maintain normal balance nutrient blood important grow healthy bone prevention side effect blood vessel lead heart disease . One method improve team work hormone FGF-23 protein call Klotho together stimulate kidney increase phosphate removal . Investigators propose problem may due low blood zinc level often occur child kidney disease . Thus , study , investigator propose first measure zinc blood child chronic kidney disease ( CKD ) kidney transplant assess zinc phosphate status , hormone FGF-23 assistant Klotho . If zinc status low , child receive zinc supplementation 3 month . After treatment zinc , blood measurement repeat determine zinc supplement help hormone remove phosphate body . If pilot project successful , investigator consider large scale project involve adult patient well pediatric patient pediatric center . This project also guide investigator whether need introduce zinc measurement part routine test CKD transplant patient . In addition measure zinc level study participant , trace element ( TE ) also measure . These include heavy metal cadmium , chromium , nickel , vanadium , copper , lead , manganese selenium . Very little known level metabolism TE CKD especially dialysis . In adult , cadmium , chromium , nickel , vanadium probably accumulate hemodialysis patient , copper lead may accumulate . Manganese , selenium probably deficient . The study allow investigator obtain information TE group pediatric patient .</brief_summary>
