	<detailed_description>Neuromuscular block agent ( NMBAs ) routinely use standard part modern , balance anesthesia regime . A residual duration action exceed end surgery , also call residual neuromuscular paralysis , common undesired side effect increase risk postoperative pulmonary complication aspiration pneumonia delay patient ` discharge post-anesthesia care unit . To limit incidence residual paralysis daily anesthesia care , quantitative neuromuscular monitoring recommend injection NMBAs . If residual effect NMBA detect end surgery , reversal agent cholinesterase inhibitor , e.g . neostigmine selective relaxant binding agent , e.g . sugammadex administer . However , reversal agent adequately dose , risk residual neuromuscular blockade re-occurs . Accordingly , neuromuscular monitoring also useful control action administer reversal agent . Although several technique neuromuscular monitoring establish clinical practice , electromyography ( EMG ) acceleromyography ( AMG ) common quantitative neuromuscular monitoring device . Electromyography , gold standard detect residual neuromuscular block , base measure summarized spike evoke muscle contraction . Acceleromyography measure acceleration evoke muscle contraction also commercially available easy use . This acceleration , however , measure one-dimensionally three-dimensionally . This study evaluate three describe neuromuscular monitoring device regard precision detect residual paralysis administration NMBAs recurrence neuromuscular blockade administration reversal agent clinical setting . We plan include randomize total 200 patient . The study participant recruit patient schedule surgery Klinikum rechts der Isar der Technischen Universität München , Munich , Germany . In patient , acceleromyography ( either one- three-dimensional ) compare calibrated electromyography . The finding help indicate neuromuscular monitoring device suitable detect residual paralysis recurrent neuromuscular blockade .</detailed_description>
