	<brief_title>Optimization Treatment Acute HF Non Invasive Cardiac System-a Randomized Control Trial</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Heart failure complex clinical syndrome result structural functional impairment ventricular fill ejection blood . Although survival improve , absolute mortality rate HF remain approximately 50 % within 5 year diagnosis . In ARIC study , 30-day , 1-year , 5-year mortallity rate hospitalization HF 10.4 % , 22 % , 42.3 % , respectively . HF represent major burden develop world . In United States , HF primary diagnosis 1 million hospitalized patient annually . A significant number patient acute decompensated heart failure baseline renal insufficiency . Yet perhaps important change renal function hospitalization . Gottlieb et al . show even small increase serum creatinine , e.g. , 0.1 mg/dl worsen outcome patient . It also noteworthy significant rise serum Cr generally may occur first 3 admission hospital . The mortality rate ADHERE registry 4 % patient ; however , mortality patient significant renal insufficiency , i.e. , Cr &gt; 3 mg/dl , 9.4 % , length hospital stay also lengthen compare renal insufficiency . In another study 1681 patient admit ADHF , Krumholz et al . find worsen renal function hospitalization 28 % patient . In-hospital mortality double versus without worsen renal function ( 7 % versus 3 % ) . This significant difference remain 30 ( 10 % versus 6 % ) 6 mo ( 25 % versus 19 % ) . The CHARM investigator also study predictor outcome three component trial 2680 patient average 34 mo . They find every 10 ml/min decrease eGFR increase adjust HR cardiovascular death readmission hospital 10 % ( 1.10 , CI 1.07 1.13 , P &lt; 0.001 ) . Therefore , even small change Cr important impact in-patient mortality well postdischarge mortality . Patients hospitalize HF high risk all-cause rehospitalization , 1-month readmission rate 25 % [ 4 ] . In 2013 , physician office visit HF cost $ 1.8 billion . The total cost HF care United States exceed $ 30 billion annually , half cost spend hospitalization [ 3 ] . Presently , HF lead cause hospitalization among patient &gt; 65 year age ; large percentage expenditure relate HF directly attributable hospital cost . Moreover , addition cost , hospitalization acutely decompensated HF represent sentinel prognostic event course many patient HF , high risk recurrent hospitalization ( 50 % 6 month ) . Median length in-hospital stay United States approximately 4 day , whereas length stay Europe generally markedly longer median 9 day report EuroHeart Failure Survey II . Although systemic pulmonary congestion main reason hospitalization patient , many decrease body weight hospital stay discharge sign symptom HF . Given re-hospitalization drive much cost associate HF , increase interest predicting risk re-hospitalization mean control health care cost reduce future risk . These risk stratification model serve important clinical tool help identify patient end spectrum risk ; patient high risk may observe closely treated intensively , whereas patient low risk may need less rigorous follow-up monitoring . In cohort OPTIMIZE-HF study 60- 90-day follow-up data , important predictor combine endpoint death re-hospitalization admission serum creatinine concentration , systolic blood pressure , admission hemoglobin level , discharge use ACE inhibitor ARB , pulmonary disease . In EVEREST trial , compose patient admit worsen HF reduce ejection fraction , independent predictor hospitalization readmission mortality include low admission Kansas City Cardiomyopathy Questionnaire score , high BNP , hyponatremia , tachycardia , hypotension , absence beta blocker therapy , history diabetes arrhythmias . Nevertheless , model fail provide treat physician simple decision make tool predict patient stable enough discharged hospital without high risk readmission . On regard , high level BNP find reliable prognostic marker HF patient readmission discharge . Hospitalized patient HF classify important subgroup . These include patient acute coronary ischemia , accelerate hypertension acutely decompensated HF , shock , acutely worsen right HF . Each various category HF specific etiologic factor lead decompensation , presentation , management , outcomes . Noninvasive modality use classify patient hospitalize HF . The history physical examination allow estimation patient 's hemodynamic status , , degree congestion ( `` dry '' versus `` wet '' ) , well adequacy peripheral perfusion ( `` warm '' versus `` cold '' ) . There limited previous randomize trial therapy tailor continuous hemodynamic monitoring heart failure . Use indwell pulmonary artery catheter adjust therapy advanced heart failure first describe Kovick et al subsequently Pierpont vasodilator therapy decompensated heart failure high systemic vascular resistance . There 11 additional randomize trial PACs critical care . A meta-analysis trial , include ESCAPE , show PAC neutral effect mortality rehospitalization . These trial support safety PACs overall neutral effect , highlight challenge assess diagnostic tool without consistent strategy response effective therapy . These result might explain balance effect improve treatment tailored medicine counteract invasive nature PAC . The Non-Invasive Cardiac System ( NICaS : NI Medical , Hod-Hasharon , Israel ) , calculate cardiac output ( CO ) measure whole body bio impedance tetra-polar mode , derive electrode place wrist one wrist contra-lateral ankle . This simple operate , non-invasive technique validate several study reliable estimation CO compare traditional , invasive technique different setting include HF patient . A previous study demonstrate parameter derive system show highly significant correlation echocardiogram estimate ejection fraction serum BNP chronic HF patient equally able predict complication population</detailed_description>
