	<brief_summary>Although major progress realize recent year , temporal cognition still poorly understood . However , abnormal temporal cognition underestimate aspect several neurological disorder , particularly basal ganglion ( BG ) affect . Therefore , interest study temporal cognition double : firstly , essential function necessary guide behavior ; secondly , seem sensitive integrity dopaminergic pathway . It well known Parkinson 's disease ( PD ) partly due degeneration neuron produce dopamine Substantia Nigra par compacta ( SNc ) . Therefore , project , PD patient healthy volunteer use model study role dopamine temporal expectation . An expectation internal representation event likely occur future . Temporal expectation builds-up time elapse upcoming event . The role temporal expectation oculomotor domain often study use anticipatory eye movement tool . Indeed , expectation evokes anticipatory eye movement . However , knowledge investigator , expectation anticipation far studied experimental task temporal information essential voluntarily control . This usually refer 'automatic ' 'emergent ' timing : timing eye movement adapts time target , implicitly without voluntary control subject . However , anticipatory movement also base explicit estimation time , e.g . music playing . In summary , time base cognitive ( explicit ) automatic ( implicit ) processing . The originality behavioral task investigator use study require explicit comparison memorize duration elapse time order anticipate target appearance . In task , expectation upcoming event build explicit temporal information . Same PD patient test treatment ( `` ON '' ) without treatment ( `` OFF '' ) determine effect dopamine time expectation . Only levodopa responsive Parkinson patient include among receive levodopa and/or dopa agonists three time daily stable dosis since 30 day . investigator hypothesize eye movement latency linearly covary objective time `` OFF '' PD patient . In treated PD patient , recovery linear relationship subjective objective time expect . This would clearly demonstrate role dopamine temporal expectation human .</brief_summary>
