	<brief_summary>Hu14.18K322A monoclonal antibody develop St. Jude Children 's Research Hospital ( SJCRH ) make bind cancer cell molecule call GD2 surface . Sometimes human body make antibody therapeutic antibody ( like hu14.18K322A ) give treatment . These call human anti-human antibody ( HAHA ) . When test HAHA previous cohort patient receive hu14.18K322A , found patient test positive high level antibody receive hu14.18K322A anti-GD2 antibody . In study , investigator would like know nature pretreatment antibody , often present , laboratory increase kill tumor cell . OBJECTIVES : - To determine whether pretreatment anti-therapeutic antibody ( PATA ) represent antibody reactive epitope ( allotypic determinant ) find anti-GD2 antibody hu14.18K322A - To determine PATA increase anti-tumor efficacy anti-GD2 antibody vitro</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>In propose study , investigator seek determine nature antibody detect HAHA test group patient , , laboratory , increase kill tumor cell , account observation patient test positive may improve outcome . The study analyze DNA blood sample SJCRH patient treat hu14.18K322A anti-GD2 antibody . Serological study confirmatory genotyping study perform laboratory University Wisconsin .</detailed_description>
