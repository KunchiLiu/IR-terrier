	<brief_title>Ibrutinib Palbociclib Treating Patients With Previously Treated Mantle Cell Lymphoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To evaluate safety ibrutinib plus PD 0332991 ( palbociclib ) patient previously treat mantle cell lymphoma ( MCL ) select recommend phase 2 dose schedule . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . To estimate toxicity profile ibrutinib plus PD 0332991 ( palbociclib ) . II . To estimate overall response rate ( ORR ) complete response ( CR ) rate . III . To estimate progression-free survival ( PFS ) . IV . To estimate response duration ( RD ) . TERTIARY OBJECTIVES : I . To evaluate genomic profile MCL cell pre-treatment relapse . II . To estimate pharmacokinetic profile ibrutinib give concurrently PD 0332991 ( palbociclib ) . III . To evaluate level cell-free tumor deoxyribonucleic acid ( DNA ) time conjunction response therapy . IV . To evaluate presence circulate MCL cell time . OUTLINE : This dose-escalation study . Patients receive ibrutinib orally ( PO ) daily ( QD ) day 1-28 palbociclib PO QD day 1-21 . Courses repeat every 28 day absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . After completion study treatment , patient follow 2 year .</detailed_description>
