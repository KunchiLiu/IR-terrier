	<brief_summary>Continuous glucose monitoring ( CGM ) tool use treatment patient type 1 diabetes . A continuous glucose monitor ( CGM ) subcutaneous tissue sensor , provide tissue fluid glucose measurement every 1 5 minute . Since CGM measure glucose level sensor subcutaneous tissue , uncertainty estimation blood glucose level . The accuracy certain CGM system assess compare glucose level estimate CGM measure glucose level plasma . In current study , compare accuracy 2 CGM system available market clinical use patient type 1 diabetes . The aim current study evaluate effectiveness , safety treatment satisfaction 2 different CGM system among adult type 1 diabetic patient .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Accuracy Two CGM Systems Tested Simultaneously Ambulatory Patients With Type 1 Diabetes</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Each study patient subcutaneous tissue CGM sensor insert . Each sensor produce maximum 1,440 tissue fluid glucose measurement per 24 hour 8,460 measurement 6 day study . The plan study 36 50 ambulatory patient hole study period . The two CGM data set ( DexCom4G Medtronic Enlite ) compare time-matched reference blood glucose measurement . The HemoCue Analyser- venous blood finger-stick blood cuvette , use measure concentration glucose . Each ambulatory patient sample capillary blood measure concentration glucose 6 10 time per day max 6 day . The concentration finger-stick capillary blood glucose measure use HemoCue meter daily live additionally HemoCue Analyser research visit use lancet . Each patient admit clinical research unit ( CRU ) 7 measurement venous sample two occasion : day 1-3 4-6 study interval least 15 minute . An intravenous catheter insert facilitate blood sample acquisition day study . Three capillary finger-stick blood sample 2 occasion , 1 first venous measurement ( one day day 1-3 ) one last venous sample ( one day day 4-6 ) . Blood sample acquisition handle standardized minimize pre-analytical error . The sensor insertion sit observed detect bleeding , inflammation infection skin subcutaneous tissue . Insertion sit photograph abnormal finding exist end study individual patient . The subject record self monitor blood glucose ( SMBG ) , meal , activity data write diary .</detailed_description>
