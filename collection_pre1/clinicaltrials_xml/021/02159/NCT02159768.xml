	<brief_summary>The Airtraq battery power single use optical laryngoscope channel hold guide tracheal tube trachea . It enable tracheal intubation patient normal difficult airway , enable laryngoscopy without neck movement . As single use device , cost effective place emergency equipment kit , use emergency military personnel . However , several limitation . The Airtraq require user place his/her eye eyepiece order see advancement laryngoscope tracheal tube , may difficult patient ground emergency scenario . Only user see eyepiece assistant unable view larynx , make difficult assistant help operator . Many handphones incorporate high quality camera . In study , evaluate effectiveness use iPhone aid laryngoscopy Airtraq optical laryngoscope laryngoscopy intubation 30 patient present elective surgery general anaesthesia . We manufacture attachment fit eyepiece Airtraq , hold iPhone eyepiece . This enable operator assistant simultaneously view insertion Airtraq , view larynx view passage tracheal tube trachea .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Visualization Larynx With Airtraq Laryngoscope Image Transmission</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This study single-cohort study design . 30 patient undergoing elective surgery general anaesthesia recruit . They endotracheal intubation do Airtraq optical laryngoscope handphone camera assist visualization . The Airtraq optical laryngoscope fit attachment hold camera handphone prepare loaded appropriately sized endotracheal tube . A standard general anaesthesia technique use . This include standard monitoring include pulse oximetry , non-invasive blood pressure , ECG capnography , start induction anaesthesia . Anaesthesia induce proprofol fentanyl , muscle relaxation atracurium . The airway management procedure start induction anaesthesia muscle relaxation . The Airtraq optical laryngoscope use . The Airtraq fit attachment hold camera handphone , load endotracheal tube . The Airtraq insert manipulated best view patient 's laryngeal opening see camera handphone screen . The endotracheal tube place patient 's trachea cuff inflate . Successful intubation confirm 3-point auscultation presence end-tidal carbon dioxide tracing .</detailed_description>
