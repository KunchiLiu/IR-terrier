	<brief_title>Oral Misoprostol Cervical Priming Before Hysteroscopy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>All patient admit hysteroscopy offer participation study , choose participate assess accord inclusion exclusion criterion study protocol . The investigator include non pregnant patient consider medically fit schedule operative hysteroscopy , regardless age indication hysteroscopy . Patients positive history vascular coronary artery disease patient use product could affect consistency cervix local estrogen laminaire exclude study . To achieve mean difference 0.5 diffculty dilation mean difference 0.5 First Hegar power 80 % 0.05 statistical significance , sample 163 patient arm need . However , investigator patient pool permit recruit 70 woman investigator take convenience sample total 70 woman agree recruited trial . An informed consent obtain explain patient benefit eventual risk adverse effect associate medication . Studied factor : age , parity , reason procedure , history cervical dilation history cervical surgery . Seventy close numbered envelope , contain capsule either 200mcg 400mcg misoprostol randomly distribute 70 patient . Each envelope cod randomly pharmaceutical department hospital know content envelope keep list code . The misoprostol administer floor nurse , per-os patient one hour hysteroscopy small amount water . The number envelope note nurse document relative patient . Hence , patient , physician performing biopsy , nurse research associate know exact dose misoprostol ingest patient . Three physician contribute study . Before begin procedure , operator note pelvic examination position cervix . He note size/number first Hegar dilator use , maximal dilation reach , difficulty dilate intervention ( measure scale 1 10 ) , cervical injury , bleed uterine perforation duration operation . A rigid hysteroscope ( Storz , 27 F ) use procedure . Adverse effect could relate misoprostol ( uterine cramp , nausea , vomit , diarrhea fever ) , report 6 hour surgery . Statistical analysis perform use SPSS version 18 . Means comparison do use t-test continuous variable difficulty dilation first Hegar ( data normally distribute ) . Frequency percent distribution compare two treatment group use Ï‡2 test expect cell count 5 ; case expect cell count less 5 , Fisher exact test use instead</detailed_description>
