	<brief_summary>This randomized phase II trial study well sipuleucel-T without tasquinimod work treat patient hormone-resistant prostate cancer spread part body . Vaccines make person 's tumor cell white blood cell may help body build effective immune response kill tumor cell . Tasquinimod may stop growth prostate cancer block growth new blood vessel necessary tumor growth . It yet know whether sipuleucel-T effective without tasquinimod treat prostate cancer .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Sipuleucel-T With Without Tasquinimod Treating Patients With Metastatic Hormone-Resistant Prostate Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To determine whether tasquinimod augments immune response sipuleucel-T . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . To assess safety tolerability combination sipuleucel-T tasquinimod patient castration-resistant metastatic prostate cancer . II . To obtain preliminary evidence clinical benefit combination sipuleucel-T tasquinimod ; include change prostate specific antigen ( PSA ) time , duration progression-free survival/overall survival . OUTLINE : Patients randomize 1 2 treatment arm . ARM I : Patients receive sipuleucel-T intravenously ( IV ) 60 minute day 4 . Treatment repeat every 2 week 3 course absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . ARM II : Patients receive tasquinimod orally ( PO ) daily ( QD ) begin day -14 sipuleucel-T IV 60 minute day 4 . Treatment repeat every 2 week 3 course absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . Patients continue tasquinimod treatment day 42 disease progression . After completion study treatment , patient follow every 3 month 3 year .</detailed_description>
