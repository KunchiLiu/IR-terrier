	<brief_summary>Nasal mucus first line defense barrier nasal mucosa contains variety proteins act functional unit . We recently show nasal mucus proteome allergic rhinitis patient healthy control significantly alter . On protein level , immune response allergic rhinitis enhance barrier function reduce reflect increased epithelial permeability . Moreover , unfavorable imbalance innate anti-proteases . Proteases pollen grain could therefore adequately deactivated mucus damage epithelium lead submucosal penetration allergen facilitate presentation antigen present cell . The aim present project show change nasal mucus proteome allergic rhinitis patient healthy control pollen non pollen season determine whether proteome change immunotherapy . For first aim patient healthy control enrol two time point namely pollen season pollen season . Statistical difference determine within group group . The protein change time course reflect allergics also healthy control react allergen challenge . The result give insight possible biomarkers could use diagnostics therapy . Protein substitution inhibition may future therapy reinforce barrier function nasal mucus treat allergic rhinitis symptom . The effect immunotherapy sole causal therapy determine therapy responder compare non-responders . We hypothesize responder show proteome change similar healthy condition . This concretize distinct protein biomarkers could use therapeutic agent . Moreover proteome change could use predict monitor therapeutic success failure patient may stratify subject therapeutic strategy immunotherapy save time money . Mucus collect special suction device equip mucus trap . Then , proteomic analysis perform LC MS/MS mass spectrometry . Database search identify distinct proteins function , origin etc . annotate . Protein group analyze pathway enrichment cluster analysis . By mean complex proteomic data visualize well understand global change protein networks function . Investigating nasal mucus proteome diseased healthy state lead well understand barrier function reaction allergen . Distinct proteins and/or protein group could use biomarkers novel diagnostic therapeutic approach . Furthermore , mechanism immunotherapy responder success failure therapy could determine .</brief_summary>
