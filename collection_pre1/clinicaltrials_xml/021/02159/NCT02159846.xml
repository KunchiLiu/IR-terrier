	<detailed_description>INTRODUCTION Diabetes mellitus group metabolic diseases characterize hyperglycemia result defect insulin secretion , insulin action , [ 1 ] . Symptoms mark hyperglycemia include polyuria , polydipsia , weight loss , sometimes polyphagia , blurred vision . Impairment growth susceptibility certain infection may also accompany chronic hyperglycemia [ 2 ] . Several pathogenic process involve development diabetes . These range autoimmune destruction β-cells pancreas consequent insulin deficiency abnormality result resistance insulin action . Patients diabetes increased incidence atherosclerotic cardiovascular , peripheral arterial , cerebrovascular disease . Hypertension abnormalities lipoprotein metabolism often find people diabetes [ 3 ] . The vast majority case diabetes fall two broad etiopathogenetic category call type 1 diabetes mellitus ( T1DM ) type 2 diabetes mellitus . In T1DM , cause absolute deficiency insulin secretion . In , much prevalent category , T2DM , cause combination resistance insulin action inadequate compensatory insulin secretory response [ 4 ] . Despite considerable progress treatment diabetes mellitus , 's prevalence rise globally exponential rate extent severe pandemic 21st century . World Health Organization ( WHO ) estimate prevalence diabetes age-groups worldwide , increase 2.8 % 2000 4.4 % 2030 whereby total number people diabetes project rise 171 million 2000 , 366 million 2030 [ 5 ] . Conventionally , insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus treat exogenous insulin non insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus synthetic oral hypoglycemic agent ( OHA ) like sulphonylureas biguanides [ 6,7 ] .Insulin therapy affords glycemic control type 1 diabetes , yet shortcomings ineffectiveness oral administration , short shelf life , requirement constant refrigeration , fatal hypoglycemia event excess dosage , reluctance patient take insulin injection , development resistance due prolong administration , limit usage [ 8 ] . Similarly , treatment T2DM patient sulfonylureas biguanides , also associate side effect [ 9 ] . For various reason recent year , popularity alternative medicine increase . Surveys conduct Australia United States indicate almost 48.5 % 34 % respondent respective country , use least one form unconventional therapy , include herbal medicine [ 10 ] .Natural material like herb spice today seem use widely traditional remedy certain disease . Spices add , preparation food , taste aroma show effective control hyperglycemia animal human study [ 11 ] . Several study conduct throughout world , recognize blood glucose lower effect herbs spice animal well human being . Bunching Onion flavor taste enhancer contain many health promote compound lower , low density lipoprotein cholesterol ( LDL-c ) raise high density lipoprotein cholesterol ( HDL-c ) level , prevent cancer , stabilize blood sugar level [ 12 ] . Similarly Holy Basil contain essential oil posse antibacterial , antioxidant , anti-inflammatory immune modulating effect , well blood sugar lower property diabetic patient . Curry Leaves inhibitor pancreatic enzyme α-amylase . This enzyme degrade starch glucose gastrointestinal tract , release blood stream . So inhibiting α-amylase enzyme , leave able prevent degradation starch simple sugar ( glucose ) , thus help control hyperglycemia patient T2DM [ 13 ] . Onion ( Allium cepa ) common vegetable . Onion bulb leave part diet . Ether soluble fraction onion ( 0.25mg/kg , orally ) observe low blood sugar level normal rabbit exhibit potent antioxidant activity [ 14 ] . In clinical study , treatment diabetic patient juice Allium cepa bulb , control blood sugar level [ 15 ] . Dipropyl-disulphideoxide onion oil produce significant hypoglycemic effect [ 16 ] . A sulphur contain amino acid , S-methyl-cystein-sulphoxide ( dose 200mg/kg 45 day ) onion show potent hypoglycemic activity alloxan induce diabetic rat [ 17 ] . S-allyl-cystein-sulphoxide onion significantly reduce blood glucose level alloxan induce diabetic rat [ 18 ] . Prolonged administration freeze dry onion powder ( 3 % ) diet produce anti-hyperglycemic , hypolipidemic antioxidant activity STZ diabetic rat [ 19 ] . Allium cepa juice ( 0.4g/100g 4 week ) exhibit anti-hyperglycemic antioxidant effect alloxan induce diabetic rat , also repair hepatic renal damage cause alloxan [ 20 ] .Coriander use many year low blood glucose traditional herbal medicine . It report streptozotocin induce diabetic mouse feed coriander feed drinking water cause significant reduction blood glucose [ 21 ] .The anti-diabetic , hypolipidaemic antioxidant activity aniseed ( star anise ) coriander seed compare T2DM patient . The seed powder ( 5 g/day ) administer two group T2DM patient 60 day . The result indicate 36 % decrease fast blood glucose aniseed treat , 13 % decrease coriander treat T2DM patient , 11 % rise fast blood glucose control group . Significant decrease serum cholesterol triglyceride aniseed treat coriander seed treat patient also observe . Both seed anti diabetic , hypolipidemic antioxidant effect diabetic patient [ 22 ] . Methodology This study conduct Medical Out Patient Department ( M-OPD ) , HTAA , Kuantan , Department Nutrition Sciences , Kulliyyah Allied Health Sciences , International Islamic University Malaysia ( IIUM ) , Kuantan . In present study , 20 patient T2DM recruit M-OPD , HTAA , Kuantan ; equally divide control test group . These patient either fed placebo ( maize starch ) 4 g daily mixed herb ( wet weight basis ) . Informed consent obtain patient . This study submit Kulliyyah Postgraduate Research Committee ( KPGRC ) approval subsequently IIUM Research Ethics Committee ( IREC ) Clinical Research Committee ( CRC ) . The four type herbs namely , coriander leaf ( Coriandrum sativum ) , bunch onion ( Alliumfistulosum L. ) , curry leaf ( Murraya koenigii ) , holy basil leaf ( Ocimum tenuiflorum , also know Ocimum sanctum ) , purchase local market/supplier , thoroughly clean . These weigh freeze-dried , weighed weight loss determine . The freeze dry herbs ground coffee mill appropriate amount encapsulate offered patient . The consumption capsule spread day number capsule consume per day tailor 4 g wet herb . The total duration trial 30 day . The herb use trial , new patient , one use among community Malaysia decade preparation food daily , thing new observe dose effect blood sugar lipid profile T2DM patient . Data Collection All patient request provide blood sample Day 0 , Day 31 , analysis various parameter , ass possible effect induce consumption mixed herb . Blood Sample Analysis The blood sample collect immediately process analyzed Biochemistry Laboratory HTAA , FBS , 2HPP , HbA1c , lipid profile use appropriate kit respectively . Statistical Analysis The current study design Quasi-experimental study design register T2DM patient . Two-way ANOVA use statistical analysis . Furthermore , data express mean ± SD difference mean ascertain 95 % confidence interval ( P &lt; 0.05 ) .</detailed_description>
