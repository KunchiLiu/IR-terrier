	<brief_summary>1 . Nutritional support critical illness important improve clinical outcome patient . Recently , apply early enteral nutrition recommend critically ill patient basis data enteral nutrition helpful prevent hospital-acquired infection . - However , critically ill patient , smooth progress nutritional support often hinder gastrointestinal intolerance , underlie clinical condition , temporal necessity procedure operation . - Continuous feed method , compare intermittent feeding , expect reduce risk gastrointestinal intolerance , improve nutritional support , hypothesis support appropriate evidence . 2 . We elucidate compare efficacy safety continuous feed method critically ill patient , compare intermittent feed method . - Prospective , randomize control study - Primary outcome : achievement rate target nutritional goal within 7 day start enteral nutrition - Secondary outcome : gastrointestinal tolerance , In-ICU/hospital mortality , frequency hospital-acquired infection , ICU/hospital length-of-stay , duration mechanical ventilation</brief_summary>
