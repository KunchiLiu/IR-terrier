	<brief_summary>The long-term purpose investigator 's research understand pathophysiological basis chronic pain . This help provide framework development effective treatment . The purpose specific study find abnormal brain rhythm patient fibromyalgia syndrome ( FM ) pain since indicate particular type treatment . FM disorder muscle and/or joint , patient experience sever fatigue . FM occur often woman men ( 3.4 % woman , 0.5 % men ) . The disease appear age , case occur woman childbearing age . FM consider chronic pain condition since pain persistent . Pain tenderness widespread throughout body . FM patient sensitive sound pressure stimulation healthy control , indicate may change brain . Also , pain make bad condition stress . Treatments FM pain include life style change exercise , dietary change , cognitive-behavioral therapy , medication even surgery , accept `` best '' treatment . This partly underlying cause pain well understood . The design study record brain activity find abnormal brain rhythm people FM present healthy adult age . Specifically , investigator test hypothesis constant low frequency oscillation present patient chronic pain due FM . This found people type pain call Thalamocortical Dysrhythmia ( TCD ) . The study two part . In first part , complete medical history obtain , include description person 's pain . In second part investigator use magnetoencephalography ( MEG ) non-invasively record brain activity . The MEG data analyze term presence normal alpha rhythm abnormal low high frequency oscillation . Each person MRI investigator localize rhythm record MEG person 's brain use MRI . The people record analyze MEG recording know person healthy control FM patient . The two part join test hypothesis find correlation people abnormal low frequency brain rhythm presence degree pain .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Brain Rhythms Fibromyalgia : A Magnetoencephalography ( MEG ) Study</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The investigator use magnetoencephalography ( MEG ) non-invasively record brain activity woman fibromyalgia ( FM ) pain healthy subject . The MEG data analyze term presence normal alpha rhythm abnormal low frequency gamma oscillation source person 's brain use MRI . The investigator use clinical evaluation , MEG record MRI scan achieve follow aim : 1 . Determine abnormal brain rhythm delta ( &lt; 4Hz ) theta ( 4-8Hz ) frequency band present patient FM pain . The hypothesis predict low frequency activity present FM patient pain , healthy control patient pain . 2 . To determine brain activity gamma ( 35-55Hz ) frequency range present FM patient . The hypothesis predict , FM patient , area low frequency activity `` edge '' area high frequency activity . 3 . To determine brain activity alpha ( 8-12Hz ) frequency range present FM patient decrease MEG record make eye open compare recording eye close . Such normal activity expect FM patient healthy control . 4 . To determine location source generate abnormal brain rhythm normal alpha rhythm FM patient pain healthy control patient pain . The hypothesis predict low frequency region high frequency 'edges ' two location : ) pain localize , somatosensory cortex region pain , b ) orbitofrontal cortex portion pain pathway associate emotional aspect pain . The source normal alpha rhythm patient control localized posterior brain , particularly visual cortex . A multi-disciplinary treatment approach take FM patient . This include life style change exercise , dietary change , cognitive-behavioral therapy well medication even surgery . There accepted `` best '' treatment , even `` best '' medication . This partly underlying cause pain well understood . The design study record brain activity find abnormal brain rhythm patient FM present healthy adult age . Such find would inform direct treatment would direct cause pain , rather symptom . Recently , abnormal brain connectivity report FM patient ( Napadow et al. , 2010 ) . Also , activation frontal cortex , motor cingulate brain region see FM patient pain anticipation correlate subsequent pain report ( Burgmer et al. , 2010 ) . These result consider context comprehensive clinical evaluation determine thalamocortical dysrhythmia ( TCD ) present patient pain ( Jeanmonod , 1993 ; Llinas et al , 1999 , 2001 , 2005 ) . The investigator also find abnormal brain rhythm correlate presence degree pain difference patient pain healthy adult . II . Study Design . The investigator follow recent protocol use study abnormal rhythm complex regional pain syndrome ( Walton et al. , 2010 ) . Those meet criterion inclusion exclusion enrol study . III . METHODS AND PROCEDURES 1 . Clinical Examination Patients Information collect clinical assessment include : - Demographics : age , sex , employment status . - A detailed history fibromyalgia . - A review pain characteristic : location severity , quality pain , timing , duration context pain , associate sign symptom , exacerbate factor , alleviate factor , motor/sensory loss , effect activity daily live . - A complete medical history important family medical history . - A social history : tobacco , alcohol , illicit drug use . - A review concomitant medication . - Vital sign : blood pressure , heart rate , respiratory rate , height , weight . - A physical exam . - Confirmation presence American College Rheumatism 's 1990 criterion fibromyalgia . - Completion follow clinical assessment patient : - Visual Analogue Scale-average weekly recall pain - Pain Drawing localization - Fibromyalgia Impact Questionnaire - Patient 's Global Assessment Fibromyalgia - Medical Outcomes Study Sleep Scale - Hospital Anxiety Depression Scale Healthy Controls procedures patient ; Clinical Screening , MEG MRI . 2 . MEG recording Informed consent obtain MEG record . If obtain , confirm . ( A member study team bring copy sign informed consent MEG recording session . ) The head shape , include location three fiducial marker ( leave right preauricular point , nasion ) obtain subject use 3D track system move stylus fiducial point surface head ( Fastrak , Polhemus , Colchester , VT ) . Each participant seat MEG instrument locate inside multi-layer mu-metal magnetically shielded room . The location head monitor begin end run use electrode attach three fiducial marker point use obtain head shape . Head position change â‰ˆ0.5 cm accept . ( The fiducial point use MRI co-register MEG MRI data . ) Each person three MEG record session . Two MEGs record eye close ( EC ) , one record eye open ( EO ) . Including time fill paperwork , measure head shape , time MEG recording , investigator estimate participant spend 60-90 minute New York University Center Neuromagnetism . Instructions participant MEG recording . An investigator explain purpose record look brain activity patient relaxed . There three 7-minute recording . The first eye close . They tell please relax , try fall asleep . Next , record period eye open . They tell please try move eye , look something entire time . Third , another record eye close . The investigator let person know record begin , half way record , come see record . The person ask please try move head recording . Magnetoencephalography FDA approve routinely use brain map epilepsy pre-surgical patient standard care case ( Shiraishi et al. , 2005 ; Makela et al. , 2006 ) . However , recording perform exclusively research purpose . Magnetic field record use 275-channel whole-head MEG system ( CTF Systems Inc. , Port Coquitlam , British Columbia , Canada ) ( McCubbin et al. , 2004 ) . A third-order software gradient ( Weinberg et al. , 1984 ) use record bandpass 0.25-125 Hz . 3 . Data Analysis Data Monitoring . During run magnetic field record 42 consecutive 10-sec trial . In way , person move session , 10 sec trial occur eliminate analysis . Neuromagnetic field record eyes-closed state minimize signal ocular muscle high-frequency visual system activation , eyes-open fixated state decrease amplitude alpha-range ( 8-12 Hz ) peak ( thereby well facilitate examination spectrally proximal signal ) . Spectral analysis independent component analysis carry previous study ( Walton et al , 2010 ) . MRI Source Reconstruction The purpose MRI ( without contrast ) provide anatomical image person 's brain use localize brain activity record MEG . The MEG MRI recording must co-registered aligned accurately . The location marker , call fiducial marker ( see ) , must use MEG MRI . So , best recording do day . The MRI MEG MEG instrument detect magnetic field small 10-15 Tesla . The MRI generate magnetic field , although small , detected MEG instrument interferes record brain activity . The location three MEG fiducials mark use fine point magic marker . The person escort MRI suit 3 MRI fiducials put person use magic marker point guide . All MRI scan carry 3 T Alegra platform , due well single-to-noise ration ( SNR ) , spatial spectral resolution , compare 1.5 T instrument . Where MRI data present investigator maintain degree uniformity across experiment perform MRI constrain modify minimum norm inverse model data set . The MRI constrain inverse compute assume current source density confine grey matter segment MRI data . Each subject 's MRI segment , tessellate cortical surface reconstruct hemisphere use software FreeSurfer ( Dale et al. , 1999 ) . These cortical surface sub-sampled create source pace ~40,000 vertex . The lead field matrix , L , compute dipole moment normal cortical surface component . Potential bias problem . A potential bias analysis MEG data . This mitigate since person analyze data blind pain status subject . Study subject identify code data . Procedures , situation , material may hazardous . None . 3 . Data Storage Confidentiality . Trained staff conduct interview respectful sensitive manner . Records cod , store review participant number . These cod record keep locked file lock office . Access computer-based data restrict protection code login password , computer keep room restricted access .</detailed_description>
