	<brief_title>Omacetaxine Patients With Intermediate-1 Higher Risk Myelodysplastic Syndrome ( MDS ) Post Hypomethylating Agent ( HMA ) Failure</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Study Drug Administration : Each cycle 4-7 week , depend well disease responds study drug . If find eligible take part study , receive omacetaxine injection skin 2 time day , 12 hour apart , Days 1-3 every 28-day study cycle . You receive instruction give injection . You give Research Drug Diary record drug take day . You must bring Research Drug Diary unused drug study visit . You also tell properly store drug . Depending disease responds study drug , number day receive injection may stay , increase , decrease . Your doctor discus . During Cycle 1 , doctor think need , give hydroxyurea mouth decrease risk side effect . You may ask study staff information drug give risk . Study Visits : At begin every cycle , physical exam dose study drug . Every week ( +/- 2 day ) , blood ( 2-3 teaspoon ) draw routine test . If disease appear get good , blood drawn every 2-4 week still receive study drug . If live far clinic , blood drawn clinic close home , result report study doctor . If study doctor think need , may additional bone marrow aspirate time study check status disease cytogenetic testing . Length Study : You may continue take study drug 24 cycle treatment . You longer able take study drug disease get bad , intolerable side effect occur , unable follow study direction . Your participation study follow-up visit . Follow-Up : You follow-up visit clinic every 3-6 month 5 year stop take study drug . You ask health new drug may take . If come clinic , call study staff ask health . These call last 5-10 minute . Every 4-8 week last dose study drug , blood ( 2-3 teaspoon ) draw routine test . This investigational study . Omacetaxine FDA approve commercially available treatment chronic myelogenous leukemia ( CML ) . It investigational use omacetaxine patient MDS . The study doctor explain study drug design work . Up 80 participant enrol study . All take part MD Anderson .</detailed_description>
