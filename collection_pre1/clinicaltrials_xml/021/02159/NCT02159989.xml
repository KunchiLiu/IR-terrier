	<brief_summary>This phase I trial study side effect best dose sapanisertib ziv-aflibercept treating patient solid tumor come back spread another place body remove surgery . Sapanisertib may stop growth tumor cell block enzymes need cell growth . Ziv-aflibercept may stop growth solid tumor block growth new blood vessel necessary tumor growth . Giving sapanisertib ziv-aflibercept may kill tumor cell .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To evaluate safety tolerability , determine maximum tolerate dose ( MTD ) recommend phase II dose combination MLN0128 ( TAK-228 ) ( sapanisertib ) ziv-aflibercept patient advance cancer refractory standard therapy . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . To give early indication efficacy evaluation tumor size . II . To evaluate v-akt murine thymoma viral oncogene homolog 1 ( Akt ) /mechanistic target rapamycin ( serine/threonine kinase ) ( mTOR ) signal adaptive response ; test phosphorylation level biomarkers , limited , vascular endothelial growth factor ( VEGF ) 1 2 , AKT eukaryotic translation initiation factor 4E-binding protein 1 ( 4E-BP1 ) follow treatment MLN0128 ( TAK-228 ) ziv-aflibercept peripheral blood mononuclear cell ( PBMCs ) biopsy sample expansion cohort . III . To determine change blood flow parameter angiogenesis assessment dynamic contrast enhanced-computed tomography ( DCE-CT ) expansion cohort . OUTLINE : This dose-escalation study . Patients receive sapanisertib orally ( PO ) daily ( QD ) day 2-4 , 9-11 , 16-18 , 23-25 ziv-aflibercept intravenously ( IV ) 60 minute day 1 15 . Courses repeat every 28 day absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . After completion study treatment , patient follow 4 week .</detailed_description>
