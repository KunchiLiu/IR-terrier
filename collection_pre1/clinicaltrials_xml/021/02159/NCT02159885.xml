	<brief_summary>Automatically titrate continuous positive airway pressure ( APAP ) continuous positive airway pressure ( CPAP ) consider first-line treatment obstructive sleep apnea . There grow body evidence suggest early patient education intervention may improve adherence positive airway pressure .

	<detailed_description>Obstructive sleep apnea high-priority clinical condition Veterans Health Administration . With approximately 2 % middle-aged woman 4 % middle-aged men OSA , disorder place significant burden healthcare system . Obstructive sleep apnea ( OSA ) link major cardiovascular disorder coronary artery disease , congestive heart failure , hypertension , stroke , well increase risk motor vehicle crash . Positive airway pressure ( PAP ) therapy consider treatment choice obstructive sleep apnea . However , adherence rate CPAP APAP therapy disappointingly low . Veterans , especially socioeconomically disadvantage psychiatric disease , demonstrate poor adherence compare general population . Effective intervention need improve adherence among patient diagnose OSA . Currently , veteran diagnose OSA Philadelphia VA sleep center treat home APAP machine record adherence smart card . They schedule follow-up appointment within one three month initiation APAP therapy discus question concern regard machine well mask download adherence data . Given limit availability clinic appointment , patient may wait long . More recently , APAP machine distribute VA system offer possibility use wireless transmission track adherence data , include hour use , mask leak , apnea-hypopnea index ( transmission require hook telephone require patient internet access ) . This offer opportunity see remote monitoring within first several week APAP treatment improve adherence , turn , improve clinical response treatment . At present time , patient enrol Philadelphia Veterans Administration Medical Center ( PVAMC ) newly diagnose OSA provide APAP machine modems allow wireless transmission data Phillips Respironics HIPPA compliant website , www.encoreanywhere.com . Review modem data perform limited basis patient . If remote monitoring improve adherence , investigator may want implement APAP user . At present , investigator know clinically effective cost effective model deliver health care . The investigator baseline chart review . It include assessment APAP setting ( auto-titrate pressure range ) , model size mask interface , baseline sleep study result ( mean AHI ) , review survey obtain part routine clinical care investigator sleep center , include : Epworth Sleepiness Scale ( ESS ) score , functional outcome sleep questionnaire ( FOSQ ) score , center epidemiological study depression scale ( CES-D score ) , short form health survey ( SF-12 ) , health survey score client satisfaction questionnaire ( CSQ-8 ) . Sleep center staff also perform chart review obtain demographic information ( age , sex , race ) , BMI , daytime oxygen saturation ( available ) , co-morbidities ( congestive heart failure , diabetes , hypertension , obesity , chronic obstructive pulmonary disease ( COPD ) , depression psychological disorder ) part problem list computerize VA medical record . investigator use chart review compute Charlson Morbidity Index . The investigator plan randomize 126 patient either usual care usual care addition telemonitoring . Standard Care Arm : Patients assign receive standard care set-up APAP machine Eagle Home Medical , contract local home health care agency . Patients also receive sleep staff 's phone number encounter problem use new equipment . Patients schedule see sleep practitioner within one three month initiation APAP therapy . At follow-up office visit , practitioner assess mask leak , mean daily APAP usage , AHI either secure digital ( SD ) card Encore Anywhere . Practitioners also calculate patient 's ESS score inquire frequent complication associate APAP-usage , dry mouth mask discomfort . After three month treatment , patient usual care arm also EncoreAnywhere data review . They receive phone call sleep center staff assess experience APAP machine . If patient follow-up clinic visit , schedule one . In addition , subject mail survey reassess functional outcome include : ESS score , FOSQ- 10 , another subjective measurement sleepiness , CES-D score , assessment depression symptom , CSQ-8 , assessment patient satisfaction , SF-12 health survey , assessment health . Telemonitoring Arm : Patients set-up APAP machine Eagle Home Medical , contract local home health care agency . Patients also receive sleep staff 's phone number encounter problem use new equipment . Patients schedule see sleep practitioner within one three month initiation APAP therapy . At follow-up appointment , APAP setting , APAP adherence , mask comfort , humidifier usage , ESS score assess . In addition , patient telemonitoring arm adherence data monitor sleep research staff . Patients demonstrate poor adherence receive phone call schedule interval ( Day 2 , Day 9 , Day 16 ) . Poor adherence define large mask leak 30 % night , 30 % day le 4 hour use , AHI &gt; 10 events/hr . Day 2 ( Can call 120 hour initiation treatment ) Two day initiation APAP data , intervention arm patient data review sleep study staff . Patients receive follow-up call follow present : large mask leak , 30 % day le 4 hour use , machine measure average AHI &gt; 10 events/hr . Patients assess symptom dry mouth , mask issue , discomfort device , problem . Interventions improve adherence ( i.e . : different mask , chin strap , modification pressure setting , modification humidifier setting , saline nasal spray ) prescribe need . Patients also give sleep center number question regard use equipment . Day 9 : ( Can call 120 hour Day 9 ) Patients intervention arm data reviewed . They receive follow-up call poor adherence note . Symptoms assess intervention improve adherence offer . Day 16 : ( Can call to120 hour Day 16 ) Patients intervention data review call poor adherence and/or efficacy note . Symptoms assess intervention improve adherence offer . Three Month Follow-up : All patient EncoreAnywhere data review . If patient follow-up visit within one three month APAP set-up , schedule one . Surveys mailed subject reassess functional outcome , include : ESS , FOSQ , CES-D , SF-12 health survey , CSQ-8 .</detailed_description>
