	<brief_summary>Gastric carcinoma ( GC ) second leading cause cancer death throughout world . In previous multi-center study , find prevalence GDNF family receptor alpha 1 ( GFRA1 ) , serum response factor ( SRF ) , ZNF382 methylation alteration inversely coordinately associate GC metastasis patient ' overall survival throughout discovery test cohort China , Japan Korea . The present cohort study investigate whether methylation gene predict metastasis prognosis GC .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Background : Metastasis lead cause death gastric carcinoma ( GC ) . Currently , GC prognosis primarily determine base clinical data pathological stage patient time diagnosis treatment . However , successful management GC patient still hamper lack highly sensitive specific biomarkers capable predict prognosis likelihood metastasis . GFRA1 hypomethylation along SRF ZNF382 hypermethylation find potential synergistic biomarkers prediction GC metastasis previous multi-center study . In addition , p16 E-cadherin also correlate GC metastasis Chinese cohort . To investigate predictive value gene ' methylation metastasis potential GC , carry prospective cohort study . Methods : 198 early stage GC patient without lymph node distal metastasis include present study . Baseline information E-cadherin , GFRA1 , p16 , SRF ZNF382 methylation status GC 191 case obtain MethyLight . The follow-up examination carry double-blind study 6-month interval . The association gene methylation metastasis GC analyze SPSS16.0 software . All P-values two-sided .</detailed_description>
