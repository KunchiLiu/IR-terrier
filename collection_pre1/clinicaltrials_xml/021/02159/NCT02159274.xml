	<brief_summary>Breast cancer affect large proportion Danish woman late morbidity follow breast cancer treatment include pain , reduce motility force arm shoulder , disturbed sensitivity , lymph edema affect many patient . The risk late complication previously carefully describe u others patient operate traditional method , follow-up study rather short , long time follow-up result available . The impact new oncoplastic technique allow woman breast conserve surgery know yet . These operation extensive therefore might accompany complication . The purpose study give answer question.The study include three part . First questionnaire patient breast conserve surgery perform one three breast unit Central Region Denmark . It contain question regard arm morbidity , quality life , comorbidity , body image . The questionnaire fill preoperatively 18 month surgery . The second part consist objective evaluation shoulder arm function cosmesis breast conserving surgery without oncoplastic technique . This perform baseline surgery 18 month later . The third part long time follow-up patient breast conserve surgery without oncoplastic technique . This group patient recruit three breast unit Central Region Denmark . It contain question regard arm morbidity , quality life , comorbidity , body image . The questionnaire fill preoperatively 18 month surgery . The second part consist objective evaluation shoulder arm function cosmesis breast conserving surgery without oncoplastic technique . This perform baseline surgery 18 month later . The third part long time follow-up patient breast conserve surgery without oncoplastic technique .

	<brief_title>Shoulder Disability Late Symptoms Following Oncoplastic Breast Surgery</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Aims perspective : During last 20 year increase focus morbidity follow breast cancer treatment . This lead new less mutilating surgical technique replace traditional operation : Breast conserve surgery ( BCS ) instead mastectomy sentinel lymph node dissection ( SLND ) instead axillary lymph node dissection ( ALND ) . Lately , oncoplastic technique introduce . These technique increase ability preserve breast breast cancer expect increase cosmetic result compare traditional technique , somewhat large procedure might therefore lead increased morbidity treatment . Hitherto evaluate clinical research trial . The aim present study examine oncoplastic technique relation breast cancer treatment independent influence morbidity quality life compare traditional BCS . In addition , group breast cancer patient treat BCS 10 year ago undergo similar study back , invite reevaluation shoulder function morbidity . Background : Previously , mastectomy apply surgical procedure relate breast cancer . Until begin 1990 's , DBCG ( Danish Breast Cancer Cooperative Group ) , recommend standard treatment . During transition towards gentle surgical procedure , use oncoplastic technique incorporated1,2 . The definition oncoplastic breast surgery define DBCG : `` breast conserving procedure , include technique plastic surgery , traditional breast conserving surgery would lead cosmetic unsatisfactory result , mastectomy would alternative . The requirement classify procedure oncoplastic 'the transfer tissue require skin incision breast conserve surgery ' 3 . The oncoplastic technique breast cancer surgery divide 3 group : volume displacement , volume reduction volume replacement3-5 . The oncological result oncoplastic breast surgery evaluate study find comparable oncological result traditional BCS mastectomy6 . Increasing evidence show among breast cancer patient substantial fraction suffer late symptom include impairment shoulder function , pain , disturbance sensibility , lymph edema7-9 . The sequel attributable treatment related factor , include breast surgical procedure10 , axillary dissection11 , radiation therapy12 . Studies indicate sentinel lymph node biopsy ( SNLB ) reduce shoulder morbidity compare ALND11,13 , shoulder impairment also occur procedure14 . Recently , occurrence late symptom address two Danish publication base questionnaires7,8 2-3 years8 5 years7 observation , respectively . These study show chronic pain 2-3 year surgery problem 47 % patient 13 % suffer severe 39 % moderate pain8 . More five year treatment , chronic pain record 29 % patients7 , associate poorer quality life high medicine consumption . Furthermore , large part long time survivor report arm swelling ( 25 % ) , phantom symptom ( 19 % ) , paresthesia ( 47 % ) , allodynia ( 15 % ) 7 . The reported frequency Lymph oedema follow breast cancer treatment vary considerably , probably depend different definition different method measurement . As state earlier , many patient report subjective feeling swelling , though proportion affect patient seem low study , objective measure apply . In study node negative patient compare result sentinel node biopsy ( SNB ) axillary dissection ( ALND ) 11 18 month surgery , arm swelling report 7 % 44 % , respectively , emphasize advantage limited procedure . Using water displacement method difference arm volume group modest , although statistically significant . At 18 month , arm volume operate side 10 ml less non-affected arm SNB group , compare increase 28 ml ALND group . The water displacement method simplify validated since15,16 . Shoulder morbidity median three year surgery include ALND measure study 132 patient ( mastectomy 67 % , BCT 33 % ) 10 . The shoulder function assess Constant Shoulder Score ( CSS ) , combine subjective symptom objective measure range motion ( ROM ) strength . Thirty-five percent patient reduction ROM , case flexion abduction affect . Among patient CSS reduce 12 % treated side compare non-treated shoulder . Patients normal ROM comparable CSS two side . In comparison BCS radiotherapy , mastectomy combine postoperative radiation , often lead reduce ROM ( OR 8.5 ) . In study Husted Madsen et al.11 recently operate node negative patient , ALND turn significantly associate poor outcome dependent variable absence presence subjective arm shoulder complaint . Most study concern morbidity , especially objective evaluation patient , short follow-up period typically year . No study long-term follow-up 5-10 year available . A study aim describe effect physiotherapy shoulder-arm morbidity13,17 , confirm well outcome physiotherapy include general advice recommendation use protect affected arm instruction exercise . In randomized study Lauridsen et al.13 , team instruct physiotherapy consist 12 session 60 minute twice week institute 6th 8th postoperative week compare treatment postpone 26th postoperative week . The team instruct physiotherapy commence early immediately improve shoulder function , treatment could improve shoulder function significantly even institute long six month postoperatively . In recently publish randomize study , Veiga et al.18 find indication well quality life self-esteem BCS include oncoplastic surgery patient undergoing traditional BCS . On hand , study include 101 patient find breast symmetry BCS effect quality life19 . In study symmetry evaluate breast analyze tool ( BAT ) , one available objective measure . Most often , symmetry evaluate subjectively panel expert , consider gold standard . Lately , Cardoso et al . introduce another objective method cosmetic outcome evaluate semi-automatically systematic clinical fotos20 . They report 70 % agreement expert panel measurement . The cosmetic outcome BCS evaluate Lyngholm et al.21 use `` breast retraction assessment '' ( BAT ) estimate symmetry base measurement clinical photos22 . The relation oncoplastic surgical technique shoulder disability , chronic pain , lymph edema hitherto systematically investigate , attempt make describe impact shoulder function post-mastectomy reconstructive surgery . In study Sweden23 , shoulder function reconstructive procedure involve latissimus dorsi flap examine . The main finding reconstruction lead insignificant increase long-term shoulder morbidity , also note small subset patient develop long-term impairment . Design method : The study include three part : 1 . A questionnaire describe occurrence loco-regional morbidity patient undergone breast conserving surgery without oncoplastic technique . 2 . Objective evaluation shoulder arm function cosmesis breast conserving surgery without oncoplastic technique . 3 . Long time follow-up patient breast conserve surgery without oncoplastic technique . Part 1 The questionnaire combine previous use validate form address shoulder arm function , pain , sensibility , cosmesis body image , QoL . The questionnaire fill preoperatively 18 month surgery . Patients include longtime follow-up study describe ask answer questionnaire , include question follow : - Arm morbidity : Pain , sensibility , swell , restriction movement , force - Quality life ( EORTC QLQ-C30 QLQ-BR23 ) - Comorbidity - Charlsons Comorbidity Index - Body Image - Physiotherapy Part 2 Cohort study 18 month follow-up . Patients evaluate baseline surgery 18 month follow method : - Passive Range movement ( pROM ) . The passive motion shoulder measure supine position use goniometer : flexion , extension , abduction , inner outer rotation - Constant Shoulder Score ( CSS ) . Including active Range movement ( aROM ) flexion , abduction , rotation strength shoulder abduction upright stand position IsoForceControl dynamometer - Sensibility record - Arm circumference - Arm volume - simplified water displacement method - Cosmetic outcome - use clinical photo breast region ( frontal- side view ) estimation BRA ( Breast Retraction Assessment ) Re . part 1 2 Inclusion : Patients , undergo breast conserving surgery invasive breast cancer carcinoma situ one three breast surgical unit hospital Central Denmark Region ( Viborg , Randers , Aarhus ) . They divide two group : - BCS include oncoplastic surgical technique - BCS without oncoplastic surgical technique Exclusion : - Patients unable sign inform consent form - Patients age 75 year age 18 year . - Patients previously operate contralateral breast , shoulder arm Part 3 The study perform Husted Madsen et al . 2003-4 include 395 patient . Surviving patient cohort ask e new evaluation shoulder arm function follow procedure describe Part 1 2 . Statistics : Based previous experience statistical calculation estimate investigator need 495 participate questionnaire ( Part 1 ) 220 patient objective evaluation ( Part 2 ) Further detail add If request . Ethics : Patients include part 1 2 contact breast unit confirmation diagnosis decision treatment make . Before inclusion oral write information study give patient ask sign inform consent form . For part 3 study , patient receive letter invitation patient also ask sign inform consent form enter study . There minor discomfort associate objective evaluation major complication side effect expect . The protocol submit The Local Research Ethics Committee Central Region Denmark approval .</detailed_description>
