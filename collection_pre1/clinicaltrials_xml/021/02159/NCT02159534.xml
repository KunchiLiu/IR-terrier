	<detailed_description>Preterm low birth weight infant risk neurodevelopmental disorder , include cerebral palsy , sensory impairment intellectual disability . Several early intervention approach design hope optimise neurological development context . These programme show high variety type intervention , frequency session total duration intervention , well duration follow-up . Depending study , inconstant benefit cognitive behavioural development first 2 year preschool age . According recent study , seem important intervention take account parental mental health , focus parent-child interaction last sufficiently long . This prospective randomized-controlled clinical study design evaluate effect additional parent-administed programme usual care developmental risk population , . The intervention carry home parent coach physiotherapist term-age 6 month correct age . The monitoring evaluation period infant participate study end 18 month correct age include clinical , neurodevelopmental , parental stress neurophysiological assessment .</detailed_description>
