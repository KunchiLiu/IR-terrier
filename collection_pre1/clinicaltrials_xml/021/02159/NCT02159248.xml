	<brief_summary>The purpose study : - Evaluate safety toxicity tolfenamic acid use gemcitabine radiation therapy patient locally advance metastatic pancreatic cancer . - Determine maximum-tolerated dose ( MTD ) tolfenamic acid use gemcitabine radiation pancreatic cancer . - Characterize pharmacokinetic profile tolfenamic acid use gemcitabine radiation . - Assess anti-tumor response tolfenamic acid use gemcitabine radiation patient advance pancreatic malignancy .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Tolfenamic Acid , Gemcitabine Radiation Locally Advanced Metastatic Pancreatic Cancer Requiring Radiation</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This phase I , open-label , non-randomized , single-center , dose-escalation study utilizes tolfenamic acid combination gemcitabine radiation patient locally advance metastatic pancreatic malignancy require definitive palliative radiation . Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug ( NSAIDs ) know variety anti-neoplastic mechanism , include inhibition cell growth , promotion apoptosis inhibition angiogenesis . Tolfenamic acid oral ( NSAID ) migraine medication demonstrate anti-tumor activity preclinical pancreatic model use Gem/XRT ( gemcitabine radiation therapy ) single agent . Each patient enrol receive tolfenamic acid combination Gem/XRT . Depending cohort assignment , patient self-administer tolfenamic acid either 200mg , 400mg , 600mg 800mg three time per day . Gemcitabine administer intravenously 400 mg/m2 , every seven day maximum 5 dos , start second week tolfenamic acid administration . Radiation give 5 day per week ( Monday-Friday ) 5 ½ week maximum dose 50.4 Gy , begin second week tolfenamic acid administration . A maximum 24 patient enrol dose escalation portion study . After maximum tolerate dose ( MTD ) tolfenamic acid determine , patient enrol expansion cohort ( MTD high dose level achieve MTD reach ) ass safety anti-tumor response treatment tolfenamic acid plus Gem/XRT .</detailed_description>
