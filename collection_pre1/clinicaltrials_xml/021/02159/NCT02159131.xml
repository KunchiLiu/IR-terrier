	<brief_summary>This open-label , fixed-sequence crossover study aim evaluate effect GSK1265744 ( 744 ) oral administration pharmacokinetics ( PK ) pharmacodynamics ( PD ) commonly use oral contraceptive ( OC ) product ( combination ethinyl estradiol levonorgestrel ) , 20 healthy female subject . Each subject participate Run-in Period ( need ) , follow single-sequence Treatment Period . Subjects receive oral contraceptive contain Levonorgestrel Ethinyl Estradiol Days 1 21 OC free Days 22 28 , withdrawal menses occur . Subjects receive OC alone Days 1 10 . Levonorgestrel ( LNG ) ethinyl estradiol ( EE ) PK determine Day 10 . Subjects co-administer 744 OC Days 11 21 . Levonorgestrel ethinyl estradiol PK determine Day 21 ass co-administration 744 result significant change OC exposure compare OC alone . Subjects return study center final follow-up evaluation 7 14 day last dose study medication ( Days 28 35 ) .</brief_summary>
