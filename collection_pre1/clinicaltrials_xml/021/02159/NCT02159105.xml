	<brief_title>Abdominal Ultrasound Assessment Post-cesarean Patient</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Hemorrhage second lead cause maternal mortality United States . Women increase risk hemorrhage cesarean sections.Uterine atony culprit 80 % case , post-operative patient , intra-abdominal bleed require return operate room must also consider . The Focused Assessment Sonography Trauma ( FAST ) use emergency department evaluate intra-abdominal bleeding trauma . FAST evaluation study post-operative period evaluation intra-abdominal bleeding . Ultrasound rapid readily-available modality type evaluation , obstetrician already familiar technology . But one must cautious , certain amount free fluid CT common postoperative patient . Before base clinical decision FAST scan , much determine much fluid normal patient cesarean delivery . We hypothesize certain amount fluid abdomen visualize ultrasound may normal cesarean delivery , ultrasound become valuable modality ass intra-abdominal bleed post-cesarean patient , amount normal fluid must determine . However , order interpret `` appropriate '' amount fluid would , also need assessment patient hemoglobin level . Thus , would additionally plan validate rapid , non-invasive hemoglobin measurement use post-cesarean obstetric patient . The Pronto7 device measure blood 's absorption multiple wavelength light determine hemoglobin . The device avoids blood draw associate pain . It also provide immediate result . We anticipate identify association amount fluid see ultrasonographic evaluation cesarean delivery adverse outcomes large expect decrease hemoglobin , need transfusion need take-back operating room . We also anticipate use non-invasive hemoglobin measurement may provide rapid , painless assessment postoperative hemoglobin ; may allow u identify patient merit earlier postoperative monitoring traditional CBC . It may also allow u identify woman need invasive CBC postoperative day 1 , may decrease blood draw cost future .</detailed_description>
