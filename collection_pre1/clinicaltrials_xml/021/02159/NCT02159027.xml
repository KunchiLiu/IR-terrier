	<detailed_description>We hypothesize maraviroc ( MVC ) lead improve cognition assess improvement neuropsychological ( NP ) performance . We hypothesize MVC therapy lead ( 1 ) decrease HIV infection monocyte ( MO ) , particularly CD16-expressing MO ( 2 ) phenotypic functional secretory change suggestive decrease MO immune activation , change lead less HIV infect activated MO trafficking CNS , less CNS inflammation neuronal damage , ultimately improve cognition . We test 48 week trial 42 HIV infected individual suppressive antiretroviral therapy ( ART ) mild moderate cognitive dysfunction . These individual randomize intensify ART double-blind fashion MVC v placebo . The primary endpoint change NPZglobal . Magnetic resonance spectroscopy ( MRS ) /magnetic resonance spectroscopic imaging ( MRSI ) conduct assess potential alteration inflammatory neuronal brain chemical .</detailed_description>
