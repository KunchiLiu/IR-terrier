	<brief_title>Uniport Multiport Epidural Catheters Post-surgical Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Epidural analgesia ( pain relief ) effective treatment post-surgical acute pain . The factor determine effectiveness pain relief epidural analgesia study almost exclusively lumbar ( low back ) space obstetrics ( childbirth ) . These factor include design epidural catheter , type dose medication , volume solution use . One important issue specific catheter design whether tip one end-hole , multiple side hole . The number hole suggest affect spread epidural anesthetic time , especially low volume solution . This demonstrated old , stiff epidural catheter design , show true newer , flexible epidural catheter . The thoracic ( upper back ) epidural analgesia widely employ many type surgical pain . While mechanism pain relief similar lumbar space , may differences two site . Firstly , thoracic catheter tend use low volume , high concentration medication solution , likely spread effectively . Secondly , thoracic catheter often need use prolonged period time . Whereas typical obstetric epidural use less 12 hour , post-surgical catheter typically require one three day ( ) . Finally , thoracic space narrow , thinner thecal sac , might promote difference spread epidural solution . Thoracic epidural analgesia routinely use control post-operative pain wide variety surgical procedure . Based improved effectiveness one end-hole flexible epidural catheter obstetrics , design commonly use thoracic epidural analgesia . It observe thoracic epidural somewhat less effective period time compare effectiveness labor epidural . This may part due inappropriate assumption thoracic epidural space post-surgical patient lumbar space parturient . The investigator seek determine whether difference analgesia provide thoracic multi-port epidural catheter compare thoracic uniport epidural catheter measure pain score , medication give breakthrough pain , need add intravenous opioids . As mentioned previously , catheter study extensively labor patient strike paucity literature regard anesthetic solution spread thoracic epidural space non-pregnant post-surgical patient may affect catheter type . If hypothesis support result , may change practice within study institution , possibly , much large scale . This study may also provide foundation research physiology thoracic epidural space , differs lumbar epidural space , medication solution spread within unique space .</detailed_description>
