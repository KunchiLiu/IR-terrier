	<brief_title>DanceFit Prime : A Dance Based Physical Activity Nutritional Intervention Primary Care - A Feasibility Study</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Regular physical activity improve physical mental health reduces risk heart disease , stroke , cancer , diabetes , dementia , obesity premature death cause ( Department Health &amp; Prevention. , 2004 ) . Unfortunately majority adult active enough reap benefit ( Chaudhury &amp; Roth , 2006 ) . Specific psychological technique use overcome known barrier increase activity . People inactive identify primary care use standard risk tool . Similarly , standard risk tool identify people high risk stroke , heart disease diabetes , people risk dementia identify diagnosis mild cognitive impairment . Combining clinical indicator identify people inactive high risk may therefore benefit activity intervention . These high risk patient offer physical activity programme design increase longterm adherence . Aerobic dance activity combine physical , social cognitive stimulation allows easily adjust intensity level meet individual need . Engagement activity program also provide opportunity offer advice healthy nutrition associate meal preparation skill . Information technology use increase activity participation . Video material produce guide activity participation home , thereby increase overall activity participation . TRIAL DESIGN The investigator plan longitudinal study participant follow total 24 week . Outcome measure collect three time point separate two phase . Phase 1 consists group base weekly intervention plus access online material Phase 2 consist access online material . The time point : baseline ( Time 0 ) , 12 week post intervention ( Time 1 ) 24 week post intervention ( Time 2 ) . Outcomes measured time 1 use determine effect Phase 1 immediately follow participation , measure 24 week ( Time 2 ) determine outcomes 12 week end group base intervention intervention therefore long term effect support online material . Participants therefore serve control Phase 2 comparison Phase 1 . In word investigator compare result participant follow Phase 1 result follow Phase 2 determine effect remove group facilitation .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>1 . Male female patient identify Inactive/Moderately Inactive GPPAQ high risk due presence one follow additional risk factor : 20 % high 10 year risk stroke heart attack use QRISK2 stroke ( HippisleyCox , Coupland , Vinogradova , et al , 2008 ) . 20 % high 10year risk type 2 diabetes QDS measure ( HippisleyCox , Coupland , Robson , et al , 2009 ) . Diagnosis mild cognitive impairment memory clinic . Diagnosed transient ischaemic cardiac cerebral event ( stable ischaemic heart disease , transient ischaemic attack ) . 2 . Aged 17 year old . 3 . At low risk serious adverse effect increase physical activity indicate performance revise Physical Activity Readiness Questionnaire ( PARQ ) ( Thomas , Reading &amp; Shephard , 1992 ) . 4 . Participants suitable exercise space available home safe participation online component . 5 . Participants access internet home , determine follow home visit research team access online material safely participate . 1 . Blood pressure 160/100 mmHg . 2 . Body mass index 40 kg/m2 . 3 . Musculoskeletal medical problem prevent safe participation regular moderate intensity exercise ( 6577 % predict maximum heart rate ) . This include rest tachycardia ( heart rate 100 bpm ) history myocardial infarction , unstable angina transient cerebral ischemia within last month , severe osteoporosis , uncontrolled diabetes , febrile illness destabilise arrythmias . 4 . Participants modifiable exclusion criterion reconsider successful management . Patients refer medical /cardiological review management prior commence exercise indicate PARQ intervention guide PARmedX ( Chisholm , Stewart &amp; Crooks , 1987 ) . 5 . Participants take medication affect heart rate need stable dose regimen 3 month prior commence order control potential spurious result fitness measure cause treatment . 6 . Participants necessary space , internet connection computer equipment allow participate safely use online material .</criteria>
