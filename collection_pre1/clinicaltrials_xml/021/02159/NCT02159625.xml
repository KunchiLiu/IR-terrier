	<brief_summary>Hemodialysis ( HD ) patient end stage renal disease ( ESRD ) experience high rate cardiovascular ( CV ) morbidity mortality general population many population chronic disease . This exceptional risk explain part know risk factor , diabetes , hypertension , uremia-related factor , include vascular calcification stiffness , autonomic dysfunction , high burden circulate inflammatory mediator . Recent study suggest blood pressure variability , especially intra-dialytic hypotension ( IDH ) significant risk factor CV event . Studies also show use IAB capable improve cardiovascular function avoid minimize development orthostatic hypotensive episode ( OHE ) patient autonomic dysfunction , orthostatic hypotension ( OH ) diabetes patient child orthostatic intolerance , post-dialytic orthostatic hypotension ( PDOH ) . The investigator propose study examine use abdominal compression elastic support ( ACES ) prevent development IDH patient know prone episode . The ultimate goal facilitate effective safe dialysis therapy . The ACES configuration similar back-support work belt inflatable abdominal band ( IAB ) . All device wrap around compress abdomen waist .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>I . Study Design : Biomedical 1 . Controls use . For safety ACES five healthy subject use control assess safety tolerability device . The regular HD treatment study patient serve control assess effect ACES use HD treatment . The control data derive treatment log four eight HD regular treatment take patient . 2 . The study design open trial . 3 . No placebo involve 4 . This single center study do Medical Center University Virginia ( UVa ) . II . Human Participants Ages : 18 old Sex : Male Female Race : All Subjects Patients : 1 . 5 healthy subject 20 dialysis patient complete protocol . 2 . There could 50 % drop rate dialysis patient . 3 . 30 ( Up 5 healthy subject Up 35 dialysis patient ) enrol site 4 . All 30 subject patient sign consent form protocol . 5 . The estimated time line study 100 % enrollment within 10 month III . Statistical Considerations 1 . Is stratification/randomization involve ? No 2 . What statistical consideration protocol ? In analyze data , systolic blood pressure ( SBP ) give patient compare first blood pressure read initiate dialysis large threshold 20 mmHg ( condition A ) decrease mean arterial pressure large 10 mmHg development hypotensive symptom ( condition B ) , session ( hour ) identify IDH session ( hour ) . The data may divide two group ( one condition A one condition B ) analysis impact condition effectiveness ACES . In study design , countermeasure implement `` control '' session may different . Our study lead answer whether use ACES effective alleviating IDH `` control '' countermeasure . The researcher handle quantitative data analysis enumeration quantitative data . To assure integrity correctness data analysis , data forward statistician physically involve study independent evaluation . 3 . Provide justification sample size use protocol . A . On safety issue : Due low compression pressure adverse effect see use IAB , expect investigator see development adverse effect current clinical trial . When investigator carry 40 ACES session Phase II show adverse effect , likely hood adverse effect develop 2.5 % . Even occurrence frequency 25 % , sample size 16 session adequate demonstrate safety hypothesis confidence well 99 % ( i.e . P &lt; 0.01 ) . B . On reduction occurrence frequency . The patient participate study least 2 episode month . It add occurrence frequency 25 % . This say 20 80 control session IDH develop . If occurrence frequency reduce 12.5 % ( i.e . 12 session IDH 80 ACES session ) , data 80 ACES session adequate show confidence level 99 % chi square test ( P &lt; 0.01 ) use ACES effective reduce occurrence frequency . On hand , frequency estimate data Phase II reduce 18 % ( instead 12.5 % ) , data 80 ACES session Phase II yield χ2 2.0 . With data 80 ACES session Phase II , value χ2 decrease occurrence frequency may increase 4 indicate reduction occurrence frequency confidence level 95 % ( P &lt; 0.05 ) . The computation analysis expand examine test size value occurrence rate affect value χ2 subsequently whether occurrence rate significantly reduce use ACES . The investigator find three test size ( 80 test mention , 160 test 480 period mention later ) set use protocol adequate carry statistical determination . Currently investigator certain way predict IDH develop . Thus , investigator consider HD session do patient independent . 4 . The investigator work retired statistician design protocol . IV . Biomedical Research 1 . Healthy subject : In order fulfill study statistical requirement , five ( 5 ) healthy subject test safety tolerability wear ACES 3 hour . Each healthy individual wear ACES three consecutive hour supine seat position , except use restroom need , assess measure parameter . If major concern identify healthy population use ACES device offer use dialysis patient three episode IDH 4 week lead recruitment . 2 . Dialysis Patients Hemodialysis patient University Virginia Kidney Center hemodialysis do seat position ( 30° 90° ) . The investigator use ACES device patient seat position . In order fulfill study statistical requirement , ten ( 10 ) ESRD patient HD test safety tolerability wear ACES dialysis session . Screening trial session Dialysis Patients After patient read sign consent form pass inclusion exclusion criterion , investigator undergo trial session ACES . This trial session do day consent form do another day patient come regular dialysis session . This trial session design find whether patient tolerate compression ACES whether his/her SBP heart rate significantly alter compression . Over course screen trial , patient advise request removal ACES whenever he/she wish . 3 . Control &amp; ACES Sessions : The patient undergo HD treatment prescribe attend nephrologists . The investigator expect characteristic treatment follow general feature : • The HD set lead Kt/V large 1.2 • A procedure countermeasure prescribe set standard care deal development IDH . - The measurement blood pressure heart rate perform usual dialysis machine give patient , provide internal equipment standardization - The blood pressure cuff apply bare skin patient 's arm - The data obtain eight regular HD treatment without wear ACES identify control data . For patient , four HD treatment session conduct use ACES Phase II four do Phase III data Phase II call . Preparation start hemodialysis ACES • Before screen test patient , investigator get waist circumference patient . The size ACES choose specification : 22 '' ~27 '' ( 56~68cm ) -Small , 28 '' ~33 '' ( 71~84cm ) -Medium , 34 '' ~40 '' ( 86~101cm ) -Large , 41 '' ~47 '' ( 104~119cm ) -Extra-Large , 48 '' ~54 '' ( 122~137cm ) -Extra-Extra-Large 55 '' ~61 '' ( 140~155cm ) . • Put ACES band tip already align white marking . At `` load '' marking , compression pressure impose ACES le 2 mmHg . This step do patient seat attach blood line . • The HD treatment start usual . During HD Control ACES session patient experience IDH SBP drop If study investigator deem patient experience symptom IDH see SBP drop 20 mm Hg , chart course use countermeasure employ . Post-dialytic care data collection • Post dialytic procedure care include : Removal ACES one BP pulse measurement , Discharge patient diagnose PDOH , Whether patient ask come back another HD treatment next day , If patient classify one PDOH , procedure discharge patient prescribe physician follow . If prescribed take stand test , do ACES . If patient send home , ACES take patient another stand test do . If patient send emergency center , physician make decision whether send patient ACES . 4 . Events call decompression ACES . If following complication develop ACES use device remove • A decrease toe O2 saturation 90 % , • An increase leg circumference 10 % indicate leg edema , • Pain cramp abdominal area and/or low extremity severe norm - Vomiting severe norm - Any threatening complication - The patient request removal device ( reason request record ) The study team investigate whether complication result abdominal compression impose ACES . If ACES deem cause , ACES decompress . When level aspartate aminotransferase ( AST ) alanine aminotransferase ( ALT ) become available Global Monitor , Inc. find high norm , retrospective analysis make determine whether level increase relate use ACES . V. Data Safety Monitoring Plan An adverse event consider undesirable sign , symptom medical psychological condition even event consider related investigational drug/device/intervention . Medical condition/diseases present start investigational drug/intervention consider adverse event worsen start study treatment/intervention . An adverse event also undesirable unintended effect research occur human patient result collection identifiable private information research . Adverse event also include problem associate use investigational device adversely affect right , safety welfare patient . The symptoms disease development describe exclusion criterion ( i.e . beyond first six ) consider adverse effect . The symptom excessive decrease SBP , example , normally associate hypotension development find common HD patient UVa clinic report consider adverse event use trigger discontinue ACES session . The adverse event report FDA case report form .</detailed_description>
