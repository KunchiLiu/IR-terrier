	<brief_title>High Intensity Training Patients With Facioscapulohumeral Muscular Dystrophy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Clinical trial recent year demonstrate aerobic exercise , effective safe patient facioscapulohumeral muscular dystrophy . Previous study test exercise moderate intensity . No study far investigate whether high-intensity-training ( HIIT ) exercise increase fitness , training cause muscle damage . However , know patient facioscapulohumeral muscular dystrophy get increase muscle damage single exercise high intensity . Investigators aim investigate whether patient facioscapulohumeral muscular disease may increase fitness improve function everyday life without muscle injury time-saving high intensity training . To investigate whether HIIT safe effective , three group participant include . Two train group , one group patient another healthy match subject . The training do ergometer-bike three time week 8 week . One weekly training supervise . The training consist interval train program ( 10-20-30 ) . The third group none-training control group patient . This group undergo test two train group . To investigate wether participant would continue HIIT train 8 week supervise training , two training group , one group patient one group healthy match subject , test additional 8 week home base optional training . To investigate wether patient muscular dystrophy facioscapulohumeral perform unsupervised HIIT training whether effective supervised training , control group patient train first 8 week , instruct home base HIIT 8 week .</detailed_description>
