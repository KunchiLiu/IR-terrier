	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To examine anti-tumor activity safety administer ex vivo expand T cell genetically modify use self-inactivating ( SIN ) lentiviral vector express co-stimulatory CD123-specific chimeric antigen receptor ( CAR ) well truncate EGFR ( CD123CAR-CD28-CD3zeta-EGFRt+ T cell [ CD123+ CAR T cell ] ) follow lymphodepletion adult patient CD123+ relapse refractory acute myeloid leukemia ( AML ) ( arm 1 ) , CD123+ persistent recurrent Blastic Plasmacytoid Dendritic Cell Neoplasm ( BPDCN ) ( arm 2 ) . II . To determine recommended Phase II dose ( RP2D ) arm ( AML BPDCN ) . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . To assess activity form CD123+ CAR T cell persistence , estimate duration response , 6 month progression free survival ( PFS 6mo ) rate , 1 year overall survival ( OS ) rate , describe immunogenicity CD123+ CAR T cell . TERTIARY OBJECTIVES : I . To assess impact hematopoiesis , change baseline number CD123+ blood cell , CD123 expression malignant cell hematopoietic cell , clinical efficacy EGFRt mediate CAR T cell ablation . OUTLINE : This dose-escalation study autologous allogeneic ( relate unrelated donor ) CD123+ CAR T cell . Patients undergo lymphodepleting regimen 3-7 day prior CD123+ CAR T cell infusion determine principal investigator protocol team . Patients receive either cyclophosphamide intravenously ( IV ) day -4 and/or -3 ; fludarabine phosphate cyclophosphamide IV day -5 -3 ; fludarabine phosphate IV day -5 -3 cyclophosphamide IV day -4 and/or -3 . Patients receive autologous allogeneic CD123+ CAR T cell IV 15 minute day 0 . Patients evidence disease &gt; 28 day , continue expression CD123 antigen , experience dose-limiting toxicity ( DLT ) may receive second infusion CD123+ CAR T cell 28 day . After completion study treatment , patient follow 24 hour , every 2 day 14 day , every week 1 month , every month 1 year yearly 15 year .</detailed_description>
