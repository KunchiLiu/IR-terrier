	<brief_summary>This research study people previously receive cancer vaccine . The investigator test form therapy know interferon alfa-2a , commercially available drug Roferon®-A , see use help boost effect cancer vaccine help immune system attack cancer . It believe body 's immune system attack tumor cell kill . This thought due immune cell call T cell recognize special protein surface tumor signal fight cancer . However , vaccine may work well protein signal weak T cell find tumor . The investigator think interferon alfa-2a signal cancer cell body make protein may allow T cell recognize kill cancer cell well .</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Must receive cancer vaccine target tumor antigen . 6 month follow last dose prior vaccine . Measurable disease define RECIST criterion ( lesion accurately measure least one dimension long diameter ≥ 20 mm use conventional technique ≥ 10 mm spiral CT. ) Karnofsky performance status great equal 70 % Estimated life expectancy &gt; 6 month . Age ≥ 18 year . Adequate , hematologic function : WBC ≥ 3000 mm3 hemoglobin ≥ 9 mg/dL ( may transfuse use erythropoietin achieve level ) platelets ≥ 100,000/mm3 Adequate , renal hepatic function : serum creatinine &lt; 2.5 mg/dL bilirubin &lt; 2.0 mg/dL SGOT/SGPT &lt; 1.5 x upper limit normal No prior grade 3 4 major organ allergic toxicity attributable prior vaccine Ability understand provide sign informed consent fulfills Institutional Review Board guideline . Ability return Duke University Medical Center adequate followup , require protocol . Patients concurrent chemotherapy , radiation therapy , immunotherapy exclude . Patients may receive interferon previously . Patients either previously irradiate new CNS ( central nervous system ) metastases entry exclude . Preenrollment head CT require indicated clinical sign symptom . Patients history autoimmune disease , restrict , inflammatory bowel disease , systemic lupus erythematosus , ankylose spondylitis , scleroderma , multiple sclerosis . Patients serious intercurrent chronic acute illness , cardiac disease , ( NYHA class III IV ) , hepatic disease , illness consider PI unwarranted high risk investigational drug treatment . Patients medical psychological impediment probable compliance protocol . Concurrent second malignancy nonmelanoma skin cancer , control superficial bladder cancer . Presence active acute chronic infection include : urinary tract infection , HIV ( determine ELISA confirm Western Blot ) viral hepatitis ( determine HBsAg Hepatitis C serology ) . HIV patient exclude base immunosuppression , may render unable respond vaccine ; patient chronic hepatitis exclude concern hepatitis could exacerbate injection . Patients steroid therapy ( immunosuppressive , azathioprine cyclosporin A ) exclude basis potential immune suppression . Patients must 6 week discontinuation steroid therapy ( except use premedication chemotherapy contrastenhanced study ) prior enrollment . Patients egg allergy allergy component vaccine exclude protocol . Pregnant nursing woman exclude protocol since research may unknown harmful effect unborn child young child . If patient sexually active , patient must agree use medically acceptable form birth control order study . It know whether treatment use study could affect sperm could potentially harm child maybe father study .</criteria>
