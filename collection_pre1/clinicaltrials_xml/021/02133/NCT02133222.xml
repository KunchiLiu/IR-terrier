	<brief_summary>Therapies target specific molecule markedly inhibit cancer growth several malignancy , provide valuable strategy treatment advance melanoma . In recent year , BRAF KIT become establish therapeutic target melanoma patient show activate mutation oncogene . However , crucial genetic mutation present melanoma lesion identify investigator design tailormade therapy individual patient . The tumour genotype determine selection molecular-targeted therapy usually identify primary tumour ; however , primary tumour always representative metastasis . Circulating free DNA may source valuable information obtain via routine blood sampling , provide real-time information patient 's current disease state , allow monitor molecular characterization chemotherapy . The aim study determine mutational status circulate DNA melanoma metastatic patient , Sequenom Mass Array , next generation sequence technology . Results obtain treatment compare primary tumor genotype .</brief_summary>
