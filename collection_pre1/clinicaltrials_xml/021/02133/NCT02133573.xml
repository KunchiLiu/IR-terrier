	<detailed_description>In United States , approximately 1 every 100 newborn diagnose congenital heart disease ( CHD ) . Many newborn ( 25 % -35 % ) require either corrective palliative open heart surgery . As recently 1960 's , 20 % newborns critical CHD survive adulthood . Today , thanks well diagnostic technology method ( include prenatal diagnosis ) , advance surgery , improve postoperative care , early survival 90 % . However , improve early outcome come sober recognition ongoing risk late mortality , well significant morbidity child . In particular , neurodevelopmental disability recognize common complication critical CHD ( i.e . patient require cardiac surgery infancy ) negative impact quality life , academic performance opportunity independence adult . The altered fetal hemodynamics secondary CHD lead decrease blood flow and/or oxygen delivery fetal brain . In turn , impairment blood flow oxygenation result impair brain growth alter structural cellular maturation , particularly white matter . Fetal MRI study show third trimester , normally time rapid brain growth development , brain infant CHD fail grow rate brain fetuses without CHD . This growth delay result microcephaly , immature cellular element white matter decrease cortical folding birth . It demonstrate brain immaturity birth primary major risk factor underlie hypoxic-ischemic white matter brain injury subsequent neurodevelopmental disability see 50 % infant follow surgery CHD . In addition , increase evidence CHD population even late pre-term birth ( prior 39 week GA ) associate increased mortality , increase peri-operative morbidity , bad neurodevelopmental outcome . Progesterone essential hormone occurrence maintenance pregnancy . Progesterone administration also show neuroprotective variety clinical situation , include traumatic brain injury ( TBI ) . Sex steroid hormone , include progesterone , critically involved axonal myelination , form basis white matter connectivity central nervous system ( CNS ) . Progesterone metabolites promote viability regeneration neuron , also act myelinating glial cell oligodendrocyte CNS play important role formation myelin sheath . Progesterone also show increase myelination enhance maturation immature oligodendrocytes progenitor cell mature oligodendrocyte , resistant hypoxic/ischemic injury . Therapeutic administration progesterone also demonstrate prevent preterm birth . Thus , two potential mechanism pre-natal progesterone therapy may improve neurodevelopmental outcome neonates CHD : 1 ) direct neuroprotective effect , 2 ) decrease occurrence pre-term birth . Study Objectives Primary : Develop preliminary evidence support multi-institutional study determine whether , woman carry fetus ( maternal-fetal dyad ) CHD , prophylactic vaginal natural progesterone therapy neuroprotective , compare placebo improve neurodevelopmental outcomes 18 month age . Secondary : Develop preliminary evidence support multi-institutional study determine whether , woman carry fetus ( maternal-fetal dyad ) CHD , prophylactic vaginal natural progesterone therapy neuroprotective , compare placebo : 1. improves fetal brain growth maturation , 2. increase myelination fetal brain development , 3. reduces pre-operative brain white matter injury , 4. reduces post-operative white matter injury .</detailed_description>
