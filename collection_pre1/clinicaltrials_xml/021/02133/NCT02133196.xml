	<brief_summary>Background : The NCI Surgery Branch develop experimental therapy involve take white blood cell patient ' tumor , grow laboratory large number , give cell back patient . These cell call Tumor Infiltrating Lymphocytes , TIL give type treatment 100 patient . In study , select specific subset white blood cell tumor think effective fighting tumor use cell make tumor fight cell . Objective : The purpose study see specifically select tumor fight cell cause non-small cell lung cancer ( NSCLC ) tumor shrink see treatment safe . Eligibility : - Adults age 18-70 NSCLC tumor safely remove . Design : - Work stage : Patients see outpatient NIH clinical Center undergo history physical examination , scan , x-ray , lab test , test need - Surgery : If patient meet requirement study undergo surgery remove tumor use grow TIL product . - Leukapheresis : Patients may undergo leukapheresis obtain additional white blood cell . { Leukapheresis common procedure , remove white blood cell patient . } - Treatment : Once cell grown , patient admit hospital conditioning chemotherapy , TIL cell aldesleukin . They stay hospital 4 week treatment . Follow : Patients return clinic physical exam , review side effect , lab test , scan every 1-3 month first year , every 6 month 1 year long tumor shrink . Follow visit take 2 day .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>T Cell Receptor Immunotherapy Patients With Metastatic Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Background : - Patients metastatic non-small cell lung cancer ( NSCLC ) approve therapeutic option exist transient benefit . - Recent clinical experience experimental agent release checkpoint host immune response ( anti-PD-1 anti-PDL1 antibody ) induce tumor regression patient NSCLC . - Data sequence genome human cancer show , like malignant melanoma , NSCLC high rate tumor-specific genomic mutation . - In metastatic melanoma , tumor infiltrate lymphocyte cell therapy product ( TIL ) mediate regression bulky disease site administer autologous patient high dose aldesleukin follow non-myeloablative lymphodepleting chemotherapy preparative regimen . - Recent study tumor infiltrate lymphocyte melanoma demonstrate frequently recognize tumor-specific mutated protein foreign antigens one hypothesis melanoma immunogenic tumor . - We propose investigate feasibility , safety , efficacy grow administer autologous tumor infiltrate lymphocyte product ( TIL ) patient metastatic NSCLC . Objectives : Primary objective : -To determine rate tumor regression patient advance non-small cell lung cancer ( NSCLC ) receive autologous tumor infiltrate lymphocyte product ( TIL ) plus aldesleukin follow lymphodepleting preparative regimen . Eligibility : - Patients 18 year age old must : - Advanced NSCLC refractory standard therapy - A site tumor excise minimal morbidity mortality require excision clinical indication - At least one remain site measurable disease - Normal basic laboratory value . - Patients may : - Concurrent major medical illness preclude aldesleukin administration immunosuppression ; - Severe hepatic function impairment due liver metastatic burden ; - Any form immunodeficiency ; - Severe hypersensitivity agent use study ; - Symptomatic brain metastasis 3 CNS metastasis Design : - Patients undergo biopsy resection obtain tumor generation autologous tumor infiltrate lymphocyte culture autologous cancer cell line . - The TIL product generate accord current TIL-lab standard operating procedure , use interleukin-2 OKT3 antibody . - All patient receive non-myeloablative lymphocyte deplete preparative regimen cyclophosphamide fludarabine - Cohort 1 receive TIL day 0 begin high-dose aldesleukin ( 720,000 IU/kg IV ) ; cohort 2 receive TIL day 0 begin low-dose aldesleukin ( 72,000 IU/kg IV ) . Assignment cohort make concomitant medical condition would preclude use high-dose aldesleukin - Clinical immunologic response evaluate 4-6 week TIL infusion . - For cohort 1 2 , use Phase II design , 21 patient initially enrol group ass toxicity tumor response . If two first 21 patient per group show clinical response ( PR CR ) , accrual continue 41 patient , target 20 % goal objective response . In order allow small number non evaluable patient , total 85 patient may enrol 5 year .</detailed_description>
