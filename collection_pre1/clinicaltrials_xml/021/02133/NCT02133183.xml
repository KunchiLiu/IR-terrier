	<brief_title>Sapanisertib Before After Surgery Treating Patients With Recurrent Glioblastoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To evaluate penetration sapanisertib ( MLN0128 [ TAK-228 ] ) across blood brain barrier achieve concentration 70 nM tissue resect contrast enhance region tumor 60 % recurrent glioblastoma ( GBM ) patient . ( Part I ) II . To determine ability MLN0128 ( TAK-228 ) inhibit TOR complex ( TORC ) 1/2 enhance component tumor determine modulation RPS6 phosphorylated Ser-235 ( pS235 ) reverse phase protein array ( RPPA ) assay . ( Part II ) SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . To evaluate penetration MLN0128 ( TAK-228 ) across blood brain barrier determine concentration tissue resect non-contrast enhance region tumor . ( Part I ) II . To assess plasma pharmacokinetics MLN0128 ( TAK-228 ) patient recurrent GBM . ( Part I ) III . To determine ability MLN0128 ( TAK-228 ) inhibit TORC1/2 non-enhancing component tumor determine modulation RPS6 pS235 RPPA assay . ( Part II ) IV . To assess ability MLN0128 ( TAK-228 ) inhibit TORC1/2 evaluate pharmacodynamics ( PD ) marker immunohistochemistry pS235 , pS236 , phosphorylated 4E-binding protein ( p4EBP ) , phosphorylated-mechanistic target rapamycin ( serine/threonine kinase ) ( pmTOR ) , AKTpSer473 . ( Phase II ) V. To evaluate safety profile MLN0128 ( TAK-228 ) pre-operative patient recurrent GBM . VI . To estimate response rate , progression-free survival , overall survival . TERTIARY OBJECTIVES : I . To perform mass spectrometry imaging ( MSI ) qualitatively assess ability MLN0128 ( TAK-228 ) penetrate blood brain barrier enter tumor tissue enhance non-enhancing region tumor . ( Part I ) II . To determine ex-vivo sensitivity tumor neurosphere culture ( patient derive cell line [ PDCL ] ) establish surgical specimen MLN0128 ( TAK-228 ) . ( Part II ) III . To explore potential association tumor genotype progression-free survival among patient treat MLN0128 ( TAK-228 ) . ( Part II ) IV . To determine ability MLN0128 ( TAK-228 ) inhibit TORC1/2 determine modulation additional TORC1/2 marker RPPA assay . ( Part II ) OUTLINE : PART I : COHORT A : Patients receive sapanisertib orally ( PO ) daily ( QD ) 7-9 day ( include 2-4 hour surgery ) . On day 0 , patient undergo surgery . Within 30 day surgery , patient receive sapanisertib PO QD . Courses repeat every 28 day absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . If patient demonstrate adequate sapanisertib tumor tissue concentration , patient enrol Cohort B. COHORT B : Patients receive sapanisertib PO 2-4 hour surgery day 0 . Within 30 day surgery , patient receive sapanisertib PO weekly . Courses repeat every 28 day absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . PART II : Patients randomize 1 2 treatment arm . ARM I : Patients receive sapanisertib PO accord result Part I . Patients also undergo surgery day 0 . Within 30 day surgery , patient receive sapanisertib PO accord result Part I . Courses repeat every 28 day absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . ARM II : Patients undergo surgery day 0 . Within 30 day surgery , patient receive sapanisertib PO accord result Part I . Courses repeat every 28 day absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . After completion study treatment , patient follow 30 day , every 2 month 2 year , every 6 month thereafter .</detailed_description>
