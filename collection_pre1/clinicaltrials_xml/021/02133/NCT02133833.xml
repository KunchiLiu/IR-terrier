	<brief_title>Quantum Spectrum Radiation Emitter Adhesive Capsulitis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Adhesive capsulitis ( also term frozen shoulder , stiff painful shoulder , periarthritis ) common cause shoulder pain estimate affect 2-5 % general population . The disorder characterize spontaneous onset shoulder pain progressive global stiffness glenohumeral joint accompany significant disability . Most study suggest self-limiting condition lasting average two three year , although significant number people residual clinically detectable restriction movement beyond three year , small number residual disability . Many intervention advocate treatment adhesive capsulitis , although limit data randomise controlled trial available . In addition , enough data either support refute efficacy commonly use intervention condition , include non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug , corticosteroid injection , physiotherapy . Oral steroid first advocate 1950s , claim expedite recovery reduce need manipulation anaesthesia . However , medication associate many adverse reaction . The aim study determine whether three week ' treatment quantum spectrum radiation emitter patient adhesive capsulitis effective improving pain , function , range motion .</detailed_description>
