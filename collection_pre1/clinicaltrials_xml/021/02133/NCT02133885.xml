	<brief_summary>Hypertension ( HTN ) single prevalent risk factor cardiovascular disease , diabetes , obesity metabolic syndrome . Despite advance life style modification multi-drug therapy , 20-30 % hypertensive patient remain resistant . These individual exhibit autonomic dysregulation due elevate sympathetic activity norepinephrine spillover , low parasympathetic activity . It generally accept uncontrolled , resistant HTN primarily `` neurogenic '' origin , involve activity sympathetic nervous system initiate sustains HTN . Thus , mechanism-based breakthrough imperative develop novel strategy prevent perhaps eventually cure neurogenic hypertension ( NH ) . This study double-blind , placebo-controlled , cross-over design test hypothesis minocycline treatment would produce antihypertensive effect drug-resistant neurogenic hypertensive individual .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Study 2 : Effect Minocycline Treatment Drug-Resistant Hypertensive Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This double-blind , placebo-controlled , cross design evaluate effect minocycline patient resistent hypertension . After provide informed consent , patient baseline followup visit brief physical examination perform , medical history , assessment medication compliance tolerance , vital sign complete . Subjects undergo blood ( lipid panel , high sensitivity-C reactive protein , high sensitivity troponin , glucose , metabolic profile , lipid panel , Cystatin C albumin ) urine study baseline visit 16 , 19 , 35 54 week . Patients ambulatory BP monitoring baseline end treatment period . Patients randomized drug scheme A B . One scheme follow follow order : 16 week minocycline , follow 3 week wash period , 16 week placebo , 3 week wash final 16 week period minocycline . The scheme consist 16 week placebo , follow 3 week wash period , follow 16 week minocycline , 3 week wash final 16 week placebo . Study visit occur study entry ( baseline/randomization ) , 16 week , 19 week , 35 week , 38 week , 54 week group . Patient participation end 56 week .</detailed_description>
