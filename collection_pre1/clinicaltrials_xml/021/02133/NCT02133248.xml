	<brief_summary>Many people wait list kidney transplant harmful antibody , call donor specific antibody ( DSA ) , attack foreign tissue transplant organ . These people consider '' sensitize '' . Prior receive kidney , patient undergo desensitization treatment remove harmful antibody . Levels DSA measure desensitization , cell produce DSA , donor specific B cell ( DSB ) , generally measure . Additionally , person experience chronic rejection due antibody also desensitize , DSA measure . This study measure DSA , use new technique , DSB two study group : receive organ experience chronic antibody mediate rejection receive organ . The hypothesis people high level DSB desensitization likely develop antibody mediated rejection .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Identification Donor Specific B Cells Antibody Mediated Rejection</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Patients sensitize , panel reactive antibody ( PRAs ) &gt; 20 % , comprise disproportionate increase cluster wait list ( 33 % ) , wait longer receive transplant non-sensitized patient . By 36 month wait list , 10 % die receive transplant . Those receive transplant require desensitization . The current desensitization protocol include anti-CD20 monoclonal antibody remove B cell , proteasome inhibitor eliminate plasma cell plasma exchange and/or intravenous immunoglobulin ( IVIG ) remove pre-formed donor specific antibody ( DSA ) . The success protocol measure use single antigen bead ( SAB ) luminex technology . These desensitization protocol show significantly decrease mean fluorescence intensity ( MFI ) . Desensitization protocols typically effective remove antibody recognize HLA Class I molecules recognize HLA Class II molecule . Unfortunately , even pre-conditioning , sensitize patient likely develop antibody mediate rejection ( ABMR ) patient donor specific antibody prior transplant . Currently , serum level DSA measure desensitization , donor specific B cell ( DSB ) . It possible B cell and/or plasma cell remain treatment . Donor specific B cell , upon transplant accompany exposure antigen , re-stimulated produce antibody also develop plasma cell produce antibody . Therefore , potentially good mean determine whether desensitization successful would look DSA level use SAB technology describe look DSB determine cell adequately clear desensitization protocol . Specific Aim 1 Hypothesis : Patients adequate clearance serum DSA , still significant population DSB likely develop ABMR . In Specific Aim 1 , investigator utilize cut edge technology observe level anti-HLA antibody , particularly donor specific antibody , present sensitize patient stain DSB HLA class I tetramers . This method allow enumeration characterization source DSA , DSB . The investigator determine number DSB donor specific plasma cell ( DSPC ) prior desensitization well later post transplant . In addition , investigator look phenotype activation state DSB prior transplant transplant . HLA class I tetramers MHC class I molecules particular allele refolded peptide peptide bind groove , biotinylated C terminal tail tetramerized use streptavidin conjugate fluorophore phycoerythrin ( PE ) . Similarly , HLA class II tetramers make MHC class II alleles . B cell retain membrane bound antibody exact specificity soluble antibody also produce . The tetramers bind B cell antibodies specific HLA class I allele surface , since binding determine specificity antibody . At time , cell stain marker determine activation state phenotype DSB . This assay do use flow cytometry . Additionally , investigator measure BAFF APRIL cytokine level Elisa time point . These cytokine closely related B cell development . There data suggest BAFF elevate form desensitization , could enhance new B cell development . Specific Aim 1 Hypothesis : Patients adequate clearance serum DSA , still significant population DSB likely develop ABMR . In Specific Aim 1 , investigator utilize cut edge technology observe level anti-HLA antibody , particularly donor specific antibody , present sensitize patient stain DSB HLA class I tetramers .

This assay do use flow cytometry . Additionally , measure BAFF APRIL cytokine level Elisa time point . These cytokine closely related B cell development . There data suggest BAFF elevate form desensitization , could enhance new B cell development . The investigator obtain blood draw subject consent obtain utilize sample establish baseline B cell produce antibody recognize HLA class I tetramers type previously identify SAS anti-HLA antibody analysis . Immediately prior patient receives transplant , SAB anti-HLA antibody analysis , tetramer analysis , BAFF/APRIL Elisas repeat . Analyses also perform 6 week 2 month transplant . Specific Aim 2 Hypothesis : During chronic rejection , patient respond well desensitization able maintain tolerance desensitization few residual DSB . In Specific Aim 2 , investigator utilize technology quantify characterize DSA DSB patient experience chronic rejection due ABMR . In case , patient may DSA transplant , develop de novo DSA ( dnDSA ) transplant , cause rejection . Or patient may DSA , desensitize successfully , maintain tolerance period time , either lose tolerance develop dnDSA . The timeline similar specific aim 1 - investigator take sample follow timepoints : upon diagnosis ABMR , 1 week desensitization , 2 3 month desensitization look rebound . In addition enrollment new subject , investigator also enroll healthy normal individual serve control .</detailed_description>
