	<brief_summary>Hypertension ( HTN ) single prevalent risk factor cardiovascular disease , diabetes , obesity metabolic syndrome . Recent American Heart Association ( AHA ) statistic indicate one-third adult United States America suffer HTN . Despite advance life style modification multi-drug therapy , 20-30 % hypertensive patient remain resistant . These individual exhibit autonomic dysregulation due elevate sympathetic activity norepinephrine spillover , low parasympathetic activity . It generally accept uncontrolled , resistant HTN primarily `` neurogenic '' origin , involve activity sympathetic nervous system initiate sustains HTN . A surgical approach recently develop `` Simplicity Catheter '' assist renal denervation remain one option available patient . Thus , mechanism-based breakthrough imperative develop novel strategy prevent perhaps eventually cure neurogenic hypertension ( NH ) . This study design evaluate low high dose minocycline test hypothesis minocycline treatment would produce antihypertensive effect drug-resistant neurogenic hypertensive individual . Minocycline select demonstrated effect inhibit microglial activation ability penetrate blood brain barrier . There compound available safer display specificity well Minocycline inhibit microglial activation . Thus , potential therapeutic benefit inexpensive , well tolerate , already FDA-approved drug minimal side effect would enormous .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Study 1 : Effect Minocycline Treatment Drug-Resistant Hypertensive Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>One hundred seventy-five ( 175 ) subject randomize receive either Minocycline 100 mg 200 mg b.i.d . ( twice day ) . At baseline , subject undergo blood test ( lipid panel , high sensitivity-C reactive protein , high sensitivity troponin , glucose , metabolic profile , lipid panel , Cystatin C , albumin flow cytometry ) . Peripheral blood mononuclear cell isolate used generate human induce pluripotent stem cell ( iPSCs ) use mechanism study . In addition blood collection , physical exam conduct office systolic blood pressure ( BP ) , diastolic blood pressure ( DBP ) pulse pressure ( PP ) record . Patients also fit ambulatory blood pressure monitor ( ABPM ) system . Patients wear ABPM 24 hour point mail monitor back research personnel . A week later , second ABPM baseline reading conduct patient return clinic fit ABPM . At visit , study drug dispense patient instructed start study medication complete 24- hour ABPM monitoring period . After visit , patient ask return every month till end study 6 month . Monthly visit ( 1 , 2 , 3 , 4 , 5 6 month visit ) , include brief physical examination assessment medication compliance tolerance . One tablespoon blood drawn flow cytometry analysis iPSCs isolation baseline , 3 6 month visit . Study drug dispense measurement SBP , DBP , PP vital sign also complete . Office BP read take seated position 5 minute rest accord Joint National Committee VII Guidelines . At baseline , BP measure arm , arm high BP use subsequent reading . Averages triplicate measure calculate used analysis . At baseline followup visit , patient ask wear ABPM 24 hour . Subjects mail cuff back research personnel complete . ABPM perform use oscillometric Spacelabs 90207 monitor ( Spacelabs Healthcare , Issaqua , WA ) read take every 30 minute daytime every 60 minute nighttime . ABPM reading average , daytime ( 8 AM 5 PM ) , nighttime ( 10 PM 7 AM ) . Patients assess adhere usual diurnal activity nocturnal sleep routine . The antihypertensive drug , dos , use visit record standardized form along report adverse experience know occur drug use ( e.g . lightheadedness , dizziness , syncope , etc. ) . Only final visit , blood test baseline repeat . When patient complete 6 month treatment , come final visit , return ABPM monitor , participation trial consider complete .</detailed_description>
