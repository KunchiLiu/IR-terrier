	<brief_summary>The time peritoneal dialysis may limit significant number patient use modality renal replacement therapy due inability peritoneal membrane clear solute achieve adequate ultrafiltration , term peritoneal membrane failure ( PMF ) . This devastate patient become accustomed quality life provide peritoneal dialysis otherwise do well therapy . There clinical evidence suggest icodextrin preserve peritoneal membrane transport characteristic may link reduced cumulative glucose exposure peritoneal mesothelial cell . Theories explain role dextrose PMF focus part high intracellular concentration glucose without consideration potential pathogenic role glucose transporter allow glucose entry cell . Experimental evidence non-mesothelial cell line indicate cellular process occur high glucose condition may relate intracellular glucose metabolism type glucose transporter allow glucose entry . 3,4 However , little know glucose transporter peritoneal mesothelial cell potential role development PMF . We hypothesize follow - The presence Sodium Glucose Co-transporter ( SGLT1 ) peritoneal mesothelial cell play role PMF hyperglycemic condition . - Regulation pro-fibrotic mediator reactive oxidative specie , transform growth factor Î² , vascular endothelial growth factor modulate SGLT1 activation glucose rather glucose metabolism concentration . - Icodextrin activate SGLT1 transporter establish mechanism may explain beneficial effect icodextrin peritoneal membrane transport .</brief_summary>
