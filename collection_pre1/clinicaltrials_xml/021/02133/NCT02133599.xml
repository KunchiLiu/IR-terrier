	<brief_summary>Each year approximately 2,900 child adolescent le 20 year old diagnose acute lymphoblastic leukemia acute lymphoblastic lymphoma United States . ( For purpose protocol , ALL use refer patient either acute lymphoblastic leukemia acute lymphoblastic lymphoma patient treat manner . ) High-dose methotrexate ( HDMTX ; 5 g/m2 ) remain important component standard treatment ALL patient . However , high plasma intracellular MTX concentration ( define MTX level &gt; 1 µmol/L 42 hour &gt; 0.40 µmol/L 48 hour ) quickly lead acute kidney , bone marrow , liver , skin , central nervous system , gastrointestinal toxicity require extend hospitalization delay subsequent chemotherapy treatment . This study seek identify sensitive marker kidney injury could serve good predictor delay excretion and/or toxicity HDMTX . This study pilot repeated-measures feasibility study . Hypothesis 1 : Directly measure GFR ( mGFR , type test measure filter rate kidney ) iohexol clearance obtain prior HDMTX demonstrate great sensitivity specificity prediction delay MTX excretion and/or toxicity child adolescents ALL serum creatinine ( sCr ) alone sCr use eGFR calculation . If study prof mGFR good predictor delay MTX excretion and/or toxicity , another study develop future determine modify HDMTX dose adjust supportive care base mGFR prevent delay clearance toxicity without impact patient survival . Hypothesis 2 : Those participant prospectively demonstrate delay MTX excretion toxicity exhibit elevation kidney injury biomarkers less 24 hour follow initiation HDMTX infusion compare pre-chemotherapy measurement . These biomarkers increase prior measurable sCr elevation .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Prediction Excretion Toxicity High Dose Methotrexate Children Adolescents With Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia Lymphoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Using approach , retrospective clinical data patient population identify significant number HDMTX treatment associate delayed MTX excretion ( defined MTX level &gt; 1 µmol/L 42 hour &gt; 0.40 µmol/L 48 hour ) secondary toxicity . From January 2012-May 2013 , 16 ALL patient receive 64 total HDMTX dos ( 4 cycle ) . At 48 hour post-HDMTX infusion , 27 dos ( 42 % ) exhibit delayed MTX clearance [ median plasma MTX level 0.41 µmol/L ( range , 0.01-1.6 µmol/L ) 48-hour clearance level 0.40 µmol/L ] . Mucositis , cytopenia , skin rash , subsequent chemotherapy delay note 31 % , 31 % , 6 % , 34 % dose respectively . Toxicities combination delay MTX clearance occur 17 dos ( 27 % ) toxicity without delayed clearance occur 18 dos ( 28 % ) . Also , mean increase sCr 17 % ( range 0-57.6 % ) pre-HDMTX baseline observe . Although measurement sCr use per standard care indirect marker kidney injury , know delay sCr rise follow nephrotoxic ( drug-induced ) kidney injury ( KI ) eliminate use point care surrogate marker kidney toxicity . Therefore , study seek identify sensitive marker kidney injury could serve good predictor delay excretion and/or toxicity HDMTX . This study pilot repeated-measures feasibility study . Substantial evidence demonstrate sCr , alone used estimate glomerular filtration rate ( eGFR ) , overestimate kidney filter function compare direct measurement GFR [ 3 ] . A new , commonly use equation estimate GFR use value sCr , blood urea nitrogen ( BUN ) , cystatin C. Conversely , direct measurement kidney filter function ( mGFR ) accomplish determine plasma ( part blood ) iohexol ( Omnipaque300 , GE Healthcare ) clearance rate ( rate iohexol remove body kidney ) period 300 minute , document sensitive accurate measure renal filtering function [ 4 ] . Plasma clearance iohexol optimal method determine mGFR , particularly child , radioactive , non-ionic , low osmolality , proven safe non-toxic X-ray contrast medium , excrete plasma exclusively kidneys [ 5 ] . Iohexol well-known contrast agent already FDA-approved use urographic procedure , angiographic procedure , measurement GFR ( See Appendix I information history safety iohexol use GFR measurement ) . Iohexol clearance plasma show several study suitable method determine GFR adult [ 6 ] child [ 7 , 8 , 9 ] . Given standard oncology care rely sCr value eGFR , kidney filter function likely often overestimate , result increase incidence delay MTX excretion subsequent toxicity . Therefore , mGFR may provide optimal method accurately determine kidney filter function thereby allow prediction ALL patient develop delay MTX excretion and/or toxicity . The utility mGFR predict MTX excretion delay and/or toxicity previously study . In addition , early recognition kidney injury follow HDMTX administration could also evaluate use biomarkers blood urine . If biomarkers find useful diagnose early kidney injury , test may become new clinical point care future could allow early thus effective clinical intervention ALL patient . These intervention include increase intravenous hydration , decrease associate end-organ toxicity . Urinary kidney injury molecule-1 ( KIM-1 ) clusterin , serum cystatin C , plasma fibroblast growth factor 23 ( pFGF23 ) biomarkers appear earlier sensitive sCr set kidney injury . In fact , detectable increase sCr occur 24-48 hour primary renal injury [ 2 ] . KIM-1 , type 1 transmembrane glycoprotein , express normal kidney , exhibit high level proximal tubule epithelial cell excrete urine within 6-12 hour toxic ischemic injury [ 10 , 11 , 12 ] . Similarly , clusterin expression induce glomerular , tubular , papillary kidney injury , increase urine concentration 8 , 24 , 48 hour post-toxic exposure [ 12 , 13 ] . Cystatin C , cysteine protease inhibitor , affected age , gender , race , overall muscle mass , make useful glomerular filtration marker early KI . In prospective study , cystatin C rise precede increase sCr 1-2 day [ 14 ] . FGF23 increase early within one hour acute KI induction mouse remain elevate chronically compromise GFR , thereby serve useful biomarker acute chronic KI [ 15 ] . In addition , plasma FGF23 recently show strong predictor risk adverse outcome adult acute kidney injury ( AKI ) , median FGF 23 level obtain within 24 hour admission 5.5 time high patient AKI compare `` control '' ICU patient without kidney injury almost 20 time high upper limit normal [ 16 ] . Therefore , KIM-1 , clusterin , cystatin C , FGF23 could provide early detection kidney injury relate HDMTX compare sCr measurement . The utility biomarkers identify early kidney injury follow treatment HDMTX previously study . This study compare biomarkers sCr pre- , intra- , post-HDMTX treatment determine utility detect early kidney injury .</detailed_description>
