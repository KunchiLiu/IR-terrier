	<brief_summary>The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency traditionally examine effect single pollutant exposure human health outcome ; however , provide good assessment pollutant exposure-associated effect human health Agency move toward multi-pollutant approach . Ozone ( O3 ) nitrogen dioxide ( NO2 ) national ambient air quality standard ( NAAQS ) criteria pollutant major constituent ambient air pollution . This study address Agency 's goal investigate cardiopulmonary health effect sequential exposure O3 NO2 healthy adult human volunteer . The finding study provide data inform risk assessment model O3 NO2 exposure . Additionally , finding provide insight human health effect multi-pollutant exposure differ single pollutant exposure .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Effects Sequential Exposure Nitrogen Dioxide Ozone Healthy Adult Human Volunteers .</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Despite improvement air quality past several decade , 100 million people U.S. still live county meet National Ambient Air Quality Standards ( NAAQS ) one pollutant . During course daily living individual expose multiple pollutant various source natural anthropogenic origin . It become increasingly clear air pollutant exposure risk factor exacerbation perhaps even progression pulmonary cardiovascular disease . The majority control human exposure study examine individual pollutant ; however , real-world exposure occur context complex mixture pollutant . Different pollutant reach peak level different time day , raise concern exposure one pollutant may sensitize individual response subsequent exposure may enhance . Thus sequence exposure agent may affect relative health effect result certain exposure scenario deleterious others . To define multi-pollutant exposure relevant real world scenario consult expert EPA Office Air Radiation ( OAR ) , advise u study effect sequential exposure NO2 O3 , two ubiquitous NAAQS criterion pollutant . Ambient diurnal profile two pollutant indicate level NO2 often peak even morning hour , follow peak ambient O3 concentration mid-day . Using information design study describe determine whether sequential exposure NO2 O3 , O3 NO2 , result great pulmonary cardiovascular effect exposure either pollutant alone . Ozone major component photochemical smog one thoroughly study gaseous pollutant . Controlled human exposure study critical demonstrating cause airway inflammation , include increase neutrophil infiltration lung production pro-inflammatory mediator , ultimately decrements lung function . More recent study show ozone also increase vascular inflammation , well alter autonomic nervous system control heart rate . Nitrogen dioxide oxidant produce natural anthropogenic process . The majority man-made NO2 result large-scale combustion-related process , automobile emission generation electricity . Although traffic-related exposure account majority NO2 emission . Emissions natural gas cooking appliances kerosene-fueled space heater inadequate ventilation serve significant source human exposure NO2 indoors . Previous study show NO2 concentration reach 600ppb area surround operate gas stove , peak level may exceed 2000ppb . Controlled human exposure study indicate exposure NO2 alone ( range 110-2000ppb ) result little observable decrement lung function ; however , NO2 exposure associate increase airway hyper-responsiveness , susceptibility pulmonary infection , increase pulmonary inflammation . More recently , exposure 500ppb NO2 associate change cardiac electrophysiology . Recent epidemiological data indicate exposure NO2 vehicle emission associate respiratory cardiovascular-related mortality . Previous study show sequential exposure NO2 O3 ( concentration similar propose study ) result great lung function decrement increase non-specific airway responsiveness compare O3 exposure precede clean air exposure young woman . Additional study demonstrate sequential exposure ozone , separate 24 hour , result great lung function decrement , assess forced expiratory volume first second exhalation ( FEV1 ) , follow second exposure observe first . Ozone exposure also show prim effect subsequent exposure sulfur dioxide ( SO2 ) adolescent asthmatic allergen-induced response perennially allergic asthmatic . Additionally , ongoing research EPA Human Studies Facility demonstrate sequential exposure human diesel exhaust ozone result great lung function decrement exposure either pollutant alone . Given complex nature pollutant exposure , interested determining exposure one pollutant sensitize person subsequent exposure second pollutant would cause pronounced response would expect base exposure second pollutant alone . Thus , study examine two exposure scenario involve sequential exposure NO2 O3 . The first involve determine whether initial exposure NO2 `` prime '' individual subsequent O3 exposure . The second involve determine whether initial exposure O3 , concentration result small cardiopulmonary change resolve within 24 hour , augment subsequent exposure NO2 . Generally speak , exposure NO2 alone associate robust change metric cardiopulmonary function ; however , believe modify , modify , ozone exposure . Specifically , study test two general hypothesis . First , hypothesize pre-exposure relatively low concentration NO2 `` sensitize '' individual subsequent O3 exposure lead great change cardiopulmonary function compare O3 exposure precede clean air exposure . Second , hypothesize pre-exposure O3 , concentration previously associate small change cardiopulmonary function , prime individual great response NO2 compare pre-exposure clean air . The information obtain course study enable EPA good evaluate risk associate sequential multi-pollutant exposure potentially provide advice activity mitigate effect .</detailed_description>
