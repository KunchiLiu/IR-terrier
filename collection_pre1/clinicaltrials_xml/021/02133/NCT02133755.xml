	<brief_summary>The primary aim study determine effect dopamine agonist therapy insulin resistance lean vs. obese woman polycystic ovary syndrome . Polycystic ovary syndrome ( PCOS ) common metabolic abnormality woman . The diagnosis PCOS rely constellation symptom sign ( problem ovulation , clinical and/or biochemical sign hyperandrogenism cystic ovary ) . Though diagnostic feature , insulin resistance ( IR ) hallmark PCOS 80 % woman PCOS IR . Although IR significant obese woman PCOS , even lean woman insulin resistant . No current therapy address problem insulin resistance PCOS . Studies suggest dopamine deficiency patient PCOS , may underlie insulin resistance may pathogenetic role development PCOS . No study date assess impact dopamine agonist therapy IR patient PCOS .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Effect Bromocriptine Insulin Resistance Polycystic Ovarian Syndrome - A Pilot Study</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Does bromocriptine improve measure insulin resistance female polycystic ovarian syndrome differential benefit base Body Mass Index ( BMI , kg/m2 ) . This study use single subject design patient PCOS regular clinical laboratory test treatment bromocriptine . It pilot study comprise 20 woman normal BMI ( &lt; 25 ) 40 woman BMI â‰¥27 . Study data collect participant regularly schedule clinic visit ( enrolment ) 3 month later ( follow-up ) . Standard care examination , blood work pelvic ultrasound perform include study data . The main outcome interest evaluate change HOMA-IR ( Homeostatic Model Assessment - Insulin Resistance ) baseline . It calculate use fast glucose insulin level . Additionally , determine magnitude effect HOMA-IR measure insulin sensitivity lean compare obese woman effect insulin sensitivity without insulin resistance . Other measure interest change glycated hemoglobin ( A1C ) , serum androgen pituitary hormone level . No additional test obtain do course usual assessment patient PCOS Change HOMA-IR value calculate individual patient test use pair t-test determine therapy significant impact HOMA-IR value . A multivariate linear regression apply determine change HOMA-IR value influence either BMI baseline HOMA-IR value along potentially confound variable .</detailed_description>
