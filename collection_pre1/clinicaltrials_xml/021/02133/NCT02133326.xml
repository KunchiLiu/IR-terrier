	<brief_summary>This study compare effective single dose intravenous ( IV ) ibuprofen compare single dose IV acetaminophen reduce pain . We administer study medication thirty minute prior removal wisdom teeth . We want see administer drug prior surgery may reduce post-operative pain . Administration nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug onset inflammation surgery reduce postoperative pain follow third molar extraction compare acetaminophen group . Subjects receive nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug consume less opioid medication compare receive preemptive acetaminophen .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The surgical removal third molar common surgical procedure perform dentistry . Surgery extract impact third molar due various reason infection , caries , pain , cyst tumor formation , facilitate orthodontic treatment . Both clinician patient concerned postoperative pain follow surgery . Rationale model selection The oral surgery model well-suited measurement acute pain.The model show sensitive effect analgesic drug useful examine peripheral biochemical measure drug vivo.This model recommend US Food Drug Administration patient usually healthy without complicate medical condition patient pain short , predictable period surgery . Rationale drug selection Pain surgical incision tissue manipulation associate surgical procedure instigate immediately . This give way inflammatory pain follow inflammatory cell recruitment injured area within course several hour . Inflammatory pain generally continue several day , depend nature surgical procedure . As consequence tissue damage release neurogenic inflammatory mediator , activation specific receptor pathways contribute central sensitization development hyperalgesia persistent pain . While various pharmacological strategy , include use opioids , provide adequate attenuation pain , use associate undesirable side effect , drug interaction , pharmacokinetic variability , often inadequate dosing , lead ineffective analgesia prolong suffering . Opioids interrupt inflammatory component pain . The study drug Caldolor速 intravenous formulation ibuprofen approve FDA June 2009 . Caldolor速 first injectable product available United States treatment pain fever . This first study dentistry evaluate use Caldolor速 preemptive analgesia . Southworth et al colleague randomize 406 patient undergoing elective single-site orthopedic abdominal surgery 400 mg intravenous ( IV ) Caldolor , 800 mg IV Caldolor , placebo . The result show patient 800 mg group 25.6 % low median morphine use ( P = .026 ) first 24 hour treatment placebo group . Patients 400 mg group lower use morphine , 400 800 mg group report less pain rest movement placebo . The comparator group Ofirmev速 intravenous acetaminophen recently approve FDA management mild moderate pain , management moderate severe pain adjunctive opioid analgesic , reduction fever . In study conduct total abdominal hysterectomy , preemptive IV paracetamol ( acetaminophen ) 1 g provide good quality postoperative analgesia , decrease consumption morphine minimal side effect . Studies show use 1 g paracetamol single intravenous preemptive dose abdominal surgery perioperative epidural analgesia reduce analgesic consumption intensity pain postoperative period . Use Pain Scale VAS Pain Scale Score : The primary end point clinical report pain . Pain intensity assess use 100 mm VAS anchor `` pain '' `` bad pain imaginable '' 4-point category scale ( `` none '' , `` mild '' , `` moderate '' , `` severe '' ) pre-operatively post-operative observation period 30-minute interval post- surgical time . The category scale include purpose obtain patient-reported assignment moderate pain ( definition clinically significant pain ) , compute cut-offs pain sensitivity .</detailed_description>

Full bony : The entire tooth level alveolar bone . 2 . Partial bony : A portion height contour tooth level alveolar bone . Subjects must physically able tolerate conventional surgical procedure ( ASA I/II ) Subjects must agree follow study protocol . Subjects know pregnant think may pregnant . ( Female patient ask perform pregnancy test day surgery confirm meet study criterion ) Subjects know allergy and/or contradiction ibuprofen acetaminophen . Subjects history alcohol drug abuse ( selfreported ) . Subjects currently receive antiinflammatory pain medication suffer chronic pain condition . Subjects refuse participate follow protocol include complete pain diary . Actively infected third molar swell , trismus , and/or purulent discharge . Subjects lidocaine epinephrine contraindicate ( e.g. , allergy drug ) .</criteria>
