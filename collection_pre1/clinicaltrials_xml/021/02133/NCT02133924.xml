	<brief_summary>This research trial design study safety effectiveness combine study drug , Natalizumab ( Tysabri® ) standard treatment , use steroid , new treatment acute graft versus host disease ( acute GVHD ) . GVHD common serious complication , bone marrow transplant . GVHD occur donor cell ( graft ) , treat recipient 's body `` foreign '' attack cell recipient 's body . During immune system response , donor cell damage body tissue , skin , liver , stomach , and/or intestine . Acute GVHD severe severe , potentially fatal transplant recipient . Acute GVHD usually happen within first several month transplant . The goal research develop safe effective treatment acute GVHD , particularly acute GVHD affect gastrointestinal ( GI ) tract , ultimate goal safer effective transplant therapy blood cancer leukemia , lymphoma , multiple myeloma .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Multicenter Study Of Natalizumab Plus Standard Steroid Treatment For High Risk Acute Graft-Versus-Host Disease</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The proven effective treatment patient acute graft v host disease steroid . Patients respond steroid treatment high risk death . Unfortunately , base early symptom , possible tell whether patient respond steroid , GVHD diagnose treatment steroid , prednisone , start . This research trial design study safety effectiveness combine study drug , Natalizumab ( Tysabri® ) use steroid treat acute GVHD patient early stage clinical symptom , , use proprietary method develop University Michigan Icahn School Medicine Mount Sinai , predict high risk respond steroid therapy , standard care . Investigators Mount Sinai develop research method believe might make possible predict high risk respond steroid . This method , call Ann Arbor GVHD scoring , use level naturally occur chemical blood ( call biomarkers ) determine patient 's GVHD score ( 1 , 2 , 3 ) . A hypothesis patient Ann Arbor score 3 GVHD , respond well steroid treatment . The investigator research show almost half patient Ann Arbor grade 3 GVHD , die within 6 month GVHD diagnosis . Most death due intestinal GVHD , sometimes develop , standard steroid treatment already begin . Only patient Ann Arbor score 3 GVHD , eligible study treatment . It important understand Ann Arbor GVHD grade approve clinical use . It use test research purpose . In study , patient must blood tested determine , qualify Ann Arbor score 3 GVHD , must start study treatment within 3 day start systemic steroid treatment acute GVHD . The study test whether investigator improve steroid response prevent death GVHD combination therapy , block donor cell get intestine causing damage . Natalizumab ( Tysabri® ) drug work block signal cause immune cell like donor cell , travel organ like intestine brain . Natalizumab FDA-approved adult , treat Crohn 's disease , chronic condition immune cell cause damage digestive system ( stomach , intestine ) . It also use treat multiple sclerosis immune cell cause damage nervous system brain . Its intended use patient disease respond standard treatment , tolerate side effect standard treatment . Natalizumab never use treat GVHD . It experimental drug study , investigator investigate new use drug , GVHD treatment .</detailed_description>
