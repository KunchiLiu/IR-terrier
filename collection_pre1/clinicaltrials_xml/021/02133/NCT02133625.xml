	<brief_title>A Study Pioglitazone Carboplatin Patients With Advanced Solid Tumors</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>- In Part I study , maximum tolerate dose ( MTD ) determine . During part I , Cycle 1 , day 1-28 , pioglitazone administer daily . On cycle 1 , day 8 , first dose carboplatin administer . On cycle 2 , day 1 , carboplatin pioglitazone administer . Cycles 2 onward 21-day cycle , pioglitazone administer daily carboplatin administer every 3 week . Part I study end MTD determine minimum 6 patient . - In Part II trial , MTD Expansion Cohort may utilize characterize safety profile pharmacodynamics drug . Patients MTD Expansion Cohort receive carboplatin alone cycle 1 , day 1 . Over day 15-21 cycle pioglitazone administer alone . On cycle 2 , day 1 , carboplatin pioglitazone administer . Cycle 2 onward 21-day cycle , pioglitazone administer daily carboplatin administer every 3 week .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Histologically confirm malignancy curable standard approach carboplatin appropriate therapy . During Part I trial ( MTD determine phase ) , measurable evaluable disease acceptable . For Part II trial ( expanded cohort ) , participant must measurable disease RECIST criterion version 1.1 . Participants enrol Part II trial ( expanded cohort ) must disease amenable biopsy reasonable safety also willing undergo least two serial tumor biopsy correlative biomarker investigation define Section 8.2.2 . Any number prior therapy permit . Prior carboplatin allow . Patients document allergy carboplatin may receive carboplatin desensitization . Age ≥18 year old . ECOG performance status ≤ 1 ( Appendix A ) . Participants must normal organ marrow function define : Absolute neutrophil count ≥1,500/L Hematocrit ≥ 27 Platelets ≥100,000/L Total bilirubin within normal institutional limit AST ( SGOT ) /ALT ( SGPT ) ≤ 2.5 X institutional upper limit normal Creatinine within normal institutional limit creatinine clearance ≥ 60 mL/min/1.73 m2 subject creatinine level institutional normal . Able swallow oral medication . Women childbearing potential men must agree use adequate contraception ( hormonal barrier method birth control ; abstinence ) prior study entry duration study participation . Ability understand willingness sign write informed consent document . Participants exhibit follow condition screen eligible admission study . Subjects treat standard chemotherapy molecularly target agent within past 3 week prior trial first drug administration . Subjects receive experimental therapy must wait 3 week last dose prior enrolling . Subjects treat nitrosoureas mitomycin C enrol 6 week elapse since last treatment . Extensive prior radiotherapy 25 % bone marrow , prior bone marrow/stem cell transplantation . Prior radiation local disease management allow last fraction complete least 4 week prior trial entry . Subjects undergone major surgical procedure within 6 week prior trial entry . History untreated central nervous system ( CNS ) metastases . Subjects history prior treat brain metastasis eligible provide 1 month follow treatment stable CT scan without evidence cerebral edema , requirement corticosteroid . Diabetic patient currently require oral hypoglycemic agent insulin therapy . Patients currently receive rosiglitazone pioglitazone , receive dosing agent know PPAR agonist within 3 month prior study entry . Left ventricular ejection fraction ≤ 50 % ECHO MUGA Uncontrolled concomitant illness include , limited ongoing active infection , symptomatic congestive heart failure , unstable angina pectoris , uncontrolled cardiac arrhythmia , psychiatric illness/social situation would limit compliance study requirement . Pregnant nursing woman . Known HIV positivity , active hepatitis C , active hepatitis B . Patients ≥ CTCAE Grade 2 peripheral neuropathy . Subjects know history gastrointestinal disorder ( partial esophageal , gastric , small large bowel obstruction ) , surgery malabsorption could potentially impact swallow absorption study drug . Patients take CYP2C8 inhibitor inducer ( rifampin , gemfibrozil , trimethoprim , montelukast , quercetin ) exclude trial . Other significant disease Investigator 's opinion would exclude subject trial .</criteria>
