	<brief_summary>This phase I/Ib trial study side effect best dose azacitidine sonidegib decitabine see well work treat patient myeloid malignancy . The hedgehog ( Hh ) signal pathway play important role cellular growth , differentiation repair . Inappropriate activation Hh pathway signal uncontrolled cellular proliferation may associate mutation Hh-ligand cell surface receptor Smo . Sonidegib bind Hh cell surface receptor Smo , may result suppression Hh signal pathway inhibition cancer cell . Azacitidine decitabine may stop growth cancer cell block enzymes need cell growth . Giving azacitidine together sonidegib decitabine may safe successful treatment patient myeloid malignancy .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Azacitidine Sonidegib Decitabine Treating Patients With Myeloid Malignancies</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To estimate maximally tolerate dose ( MTD ) LDE225 ( sonidegib ) ( day 1-28 ) combination azacitidine ( overall ) ; LDE225 ( day 1-7 ) combination azacitidine ( overall ) ; LDE225 ( day 1-28 ) combination decitabine ( overall ) . ( Phase I ) II . To estimate efficacy LDE225 ( day 1-28 ) combination azacitidine follow subgroup : untreated acute myeloid leukemia ( AML ) /chronic myelomonocytic leukemia ( CMML ) /myelodysplastic syndrome ( MDS ) /myeloproliferative neoplasm ( MPN ) overlap ; relapsed/refractory AML/CMML/MDS/MPN overlap ; myelofibrosis ( MF ) . ( Phase Ib ) SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . To estimate duration response , time progression , overall survival , time AML death ( MDS subject ) LDE225 ( day 1-28 ) combination azacitidine ( overall cohort ) . ( Phase I/1b ) TERTIARY OBJECTIVES : I . To conduct correlative study measure HH pathway activation inhibition explore biomarkers response . II . To evaluate quality life ( QOL ) patient-reported symptom use Myeloproliferative Neoplasm Symptom Assessment Form ( MPN-SAF ) European Organization Research Treatment Cancer ( EORTC ) Quality Life Questionnaire ( QLQ ) -Core ( C ) 30 subject treat LDE225 combination azacitidine decitabine . OUTLINE : This dose-escalation study erismodegib . Patients receive azacitidine subcutaneously ( SC ) intravenously ( IV ) day 1-7 , sonidegib orally ( PO ) daily ( QD ) day 1-28 1-7* decitabine IV day 1-5 . Courses repeat every 28 day absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . *NOTE : Sonidegib PO QD give day 1-7 combination azacitidine day 1-28 give combination decitabine . After completion study treatment , patient follow every 3 month progressive disease every 6 month 2 year .</detailed_description>
