	<detailed_description>The investigational medicinal product denosumab protein ( monoclonal antibody ) work slow bone destruction cause cancer spread bone ( bone metastasis ) . Denosumab use adult cancer prevent serious complication cause bone metastasis ( e.g . fracture , pressure spinal cord need receive radiation therapy surgery ) . Results one study lung cancer patient bone metastasis suggest add denosumab standard chemotherapy may lead possible survival benefit . All patient receive standard chemotherapy consist combination platinum-based agent plus gemcitabine pemetrexed , depend nature lung cancer , every 3 week 3-4 month : Patients assign one two group , know 'arms ' . The treatment arm follow : Arm A : 4 - 6 cycle chemotherapy best supportive care Arm B : 4 - 6 cycle chemotherapy + denosumab 120 mg , administer subcutaneously every 3-4 week . Denosumab treatment may continue thereafter 2 year study evaluate . A total 1000 patient center Europe , Switzerland Israel expect enrolled study period 37 months.The study take approximately 51 month complete</detailed_description>
