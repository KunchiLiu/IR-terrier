	<brief_summary>The West African Treatment Cohort Hepatitis B ( WATCH ) study component European Commission Funded FP7 project PROLIFICA . It aim evaluate number step require successfully treat patient chronic hepatitis B virus infection prevent cirrhosis liver cancer . The first step determine whether screen hepatitis B use point care test feasible effective . The second monitor linkage screen care . The third evaluate cheap non-invasive assessment determine need treatment . The fourth determine proportion patient meet treatment eligibility criterion . The fifth step establish treatment cohort use measure adherence therapy avoidance HBV related complication . A parallel untreated cohort establish determine whether treatment criterion relevant West African set monitoring complication HBV infection .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Objectives Primary : To determine whether suppression HBV nucleotide analogue reduces risk liver cancer West African population . Secondary : To demonstrate HBV replication effectively suppress nucleotide analogue West African population To evaluate whether European treatment guideline applicable West Africa To establish applicability efficacy population base screening , clinical assessment treatment West Africa To enumerate proportion adult population carry HBV To evaluate proportion HBV infect population meet European Association Study Liver ( EASL ) criteria treatment Endpoints Primary : Incidence Hepatocellular Carcinoma period study treat cohort patient chronic HBV compare historical control Secondary : Proportion adult population Gambia Senegal chronic HBV infection Proportion patient chronic HBV infection meet EASL treatment criterion Proportion patient undetectable HBV DNA &lt; 400 copies/ml 1 , 2 , 3 , 4 5 year treatment . Incidence hepatocellular Carcinoma patient meet EASL treatment criterion . Treatment adherence rate . Average change Fibroscan score 3 5 year treatment Emergence resistance treatment Study Phase 4 Study Design A two part study : Part 1 - Population base screen HBV infection use point-of-care test . Part 2 - Non-randomised , open label , treatment cohort parallel observation cohort Number Subjects Part 1 : Approximately 13,500 adult general population . Part 2 : 300 subject treatment group 600 subject observation group Study Population Part 1 : Males female age 30 year Part 2 : Patients chronic hepatitis B virus infection identify population base screening . Treatment Cohort There single treatment group 300 patient meet EASL treatment criterion . Schedule Study Visits Part 1 : A single visit individual home workplace screen HBV infection perform use point-of-care test.. Part 2 : One screen visit perform determine viral load , liver function test , clinical examination , ultrasound examination liver fibrosis assessment . A second visit , 1 - 3 month later , use verify viral load ALT value For treatment cohort : A baseline visit take place 2 week second screen visit study drug dispense instruction patient . First follow-up 1 month check adherence Second follow-up 3 month viral load liver function test Treatment subject see every 3 month dispense study drug check compliance Viral load , liver function , renal function , AFP ultrasound perform every 6 month . Serum/plasma urine sample biomarkers cancer development take baseline annually . Population Screening ( Part 1 ) Communities sensitise study prior visit fieldworker individual home , place work recreational facility . A point-of-care test base detection hepatitis B surface antigen ( HBsAg ) finger-prick blood sample use screening . Subjects positive test give hospital appointment full clinical assessment . Efficacy Evaluations ( Part 2 ) Detection liver cancer - Surveillance liver cancer make use ultrasound serum AFP every 6 month subject . In centre image available . Liver cancer diagnose accord follow criterion : - Liver mass typical feature hepatocellular carcinoma two imaging modality ( ultrasound , bubble ultrasound CT ) , - liver mass ultrasound AFP &gt; 400 iu/ml - histological cytological confirmation diagnosis . Viral Load - viral load measure EDTA plasma sample use in-house real-time PCR assay verify accuracy commercial assay every 6 month . Safety Evaluations ( Part 2 ) Liver function test , serum phosphate renal function test every 6 month Evaluation treatment guideline Subjects meet EASL treatment criterion baseline enrol observational study surveillance liver cancer every 6 month Detection viral resistance Viral load monitoring patient treatment study every 6 month use detect possible virological resistance . A rise viral load nadir value reappearance detectable viraemia patient achieve undetectable viral load investigate emergence viral sequence variant adherence therapy</detailed_description>
