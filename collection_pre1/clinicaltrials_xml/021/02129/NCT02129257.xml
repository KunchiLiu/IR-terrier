	<brief_summary>The AMALTHEA ( Aflibercept MAintenance first-Line THErapy FOLFIRI+Aflibercept metastatic colorectal cancer patient ) trial investigator-initiated , single arm , open-label , phase II study . Patients histologically proven metastatic colorectal carcinoma treat combination FOLFIRI aflibercept 6 month . Both Kirsten rat sarcoma viral oncogene homolog ( KRAS ) wild type ( wt ) mutant ( mut ) patient wil enrol . In absence Progressive Disease ( PD ) 6 month combination chemotherapy aflibercept , patient treat maintenance therapy aflibercept alone PD unacceptable toxicity , investigator 's decision patient 's refusal treatment death , whichever come first .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Statistical hypothesis sample size calculation : It estimate progression-free survival ( PFS ) rate 1year improve 33 % ( correspond median PFS 7.5 month [ null hypothesis ] ) 47 % ( correspond median PFS 11 month [ alternative hypothesis ] ) combination first-line Folinic acid/5-Fluorouracil/Irinotecan ( FOLFIRI ) plus aflibercept therapy patient metastatic colorectal cancer ( mCRC ) . Using one-stage Fleming 's design , order reject null hypothesis one-sided test type I error 5 % power 80 % , 73 patient need enter study . Analysis population : - Intent-to-treat ( ITT ) population : patient give informed consent correctly register study - Evaluable population tumor response : treated patient , without major protocol deviation , least one tumor evaluation treatment ( except early disease progression death ) evaluable response - Safety population : subset ITT population take least one dose study medication Primary analysis : The primary efficacy parameter PFS rate 1 year calculate ITT population . Analysis secondary endpoint : Response treatment describe frequency table along correspond percentage 95 % exact confidence interval . Kaplan-Meier method use estimate median PFS overall survival ( OS ) value 95 % confidence interval . All analysis perform ITT population . Analysis objective response rate ( ORR ) additionally present evaluable population tumor response . Adverse Events ( AEs ) safety population FOLFIRI-aflibercept treatment part maintenance therapy present frequency table accord grade , along correspond percentage ( N , % ) . Exploratory endpoint : Univariate multivariate Cox regression analysis also perform explore prognostic factor among basic clinicopathological characteristic evaluate biomarkers , respect PFS OS . Time-to-event distribution expression examine marker estimate Kaplan-Meier method compare use log-rank test . Formalin-fixed embed tumor tissue block collect primary metastases immunohistochemical messenger ribonucleic acid ( mRNA ) study key angiogenic effector regulator , : vascular endothelial growth factor A ( VEGF A ) , vascular endothelial growth factor A-121 ( VEGFA-121 ) , vascular endothelial growth factor A121b ( VEGFA121b ) , short long VEGFA isoforms , metalloproteinase inhibitor 3 ( TIMP3 ) , vascular endothelial growth factor B ( VEGF-B ) , placental growth factor ( PlGF ) , vascular endothelial growth factor-C ( AVEGF-C ) , Semaphorins , hypoxia-inducible factor 1 ( HIF1 ) , vascular endothelial growth factor receptor 1 ( VEGFR1 ) , vascular endothelial growth factor receptor 2 ( VEGFR2 ) , neuropilin 1 ( NRP1 ) , neuropilin 2 ( NRP2 ) , thrombospondin 1 ( TSP1 ) , thrombospondin 2 ( TSP2 ) , angiopoietin-1 ( Ang1 ) , Angiopoietin-2 ( Ang2 ) , Tie2 , interleukin 8 ( IL8 ) , CXC chemokine receptor 1 ( CXCR1 ) , CXC chemokine receptor 2 ( CXCR2 ) Pharmacokinetic ( PK ) /Pharmacodynamic analysis ( PD ) PK/PD assessment ( plasma analytes , plasma free VEGF-bound aflibercept ) perform registered treated patient specify timepoints FOLFIRI-aflibercept induction aflibercept maintenance therapy , ass free/bound aflibercept ratio cycle potential correlation clinical endpoint ( safety efficacy ) .</detailed_description>
