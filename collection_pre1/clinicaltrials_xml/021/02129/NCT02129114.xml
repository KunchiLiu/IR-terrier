	<detailed_description>1 . Dura mater important structural cell layer surface brain serve important barrier brain protection . Dural defect could cause vast variety factor , include trauma , tumor invasion , increased volume intra-cranial content , certain congenital disease , surgical procedure etc . Most dural defect may lead subcutaneous effusion CSF leakage , may result infection ; besides , direct adhesion brain tissue sub-scalp tissue also increase risk epilepsy , severe case , dural defect consider life-threatening condition . Repairing dura mater restore full integrity prove reduce incidence complication , CSF leakage , epilepsy etc . In particular , outcomes neurosurgery largely dependent post-operative integrity dura mater . 2. currently available product require surgical dural suturing , elongate duration operation ; nevertheless , surgical site unsuitable suturing . The currently market non-suture dural substitute mainly make single material single-layered structure , significantly different natural structure extracellular matrix , poorly mimic microstructure dural mater ; hence , structure surface property product meet requirement local cellular regeneration post dural repair , result poor repair outcome . Besides , increase contractility product water absorption also impose certain extent risk practical application , since dural repair surgery mainly conduct defective site soft cerebral tissue . 3 . As product prepare use bionic technology , Dural Repair Patch manufacture Guangzhou Medprin Regenerative Medical Technologies Co. , Ltd. able mimic porous fiber biomimetic structure facilitate cellular growth stent . Through effective control bionic technology parameter , diameter , aperture porosity fiber almost identical vivo tissue structure , improve cellular adhesion growth sten . Increased strength , suitable ductility improve hydrophilicity contribute excellent flexibility adhesiveness finish product able adhesive closely autologous tissue , meet clinical requirement . Being make absorbable polymer material widely accept clinical product , product highly bionic 3-dimensional structure prove facilitate migration growth regenerative cell , well accelerate growth repair regenerative meninges . While material degrade gradually absorb body , regenerative meningeal tissue gradually form , achieve true reconstruction dura mater . 4 . Design methods 4.1 Subjects meet inclusion criterion randomize accordance admission time ; routine blood test , liver kidney function test , well cellular humoral immunity test conduct prior surgery . 4.2 Location , characteristic size defect , well condition surgical incision observe intra-operatively . 4.3 Dura mater membrane repair surgery conduct closely attach either appropriately-sized test product reference product defect part dura mater membrane , incision skull close use conventional approach . 4.4 The subjects'conditions review Day 1 , 3 , 5 , 7 10 post operation , respectively . 4.5 Lumbar puncture conduct Day 10±2 post operation base subject 's condition , order measure intracranial pressure test cerebrospinal fluid leakage ; routine blood , liver kidney function , well cellular humoral immunity re-tested Day 10±2 post operation value obtain compare pre-operative baseline measurement record , evaluate clinical significance ; On Day 10±2 post operation , cerebrospinal fluid leakage subcutaneous effusion examine CT scan clinical examination , ass relationship event test/reference product . 4.6 For subject receive re-operation location second neurosurgery , condition test product reference product repair site observe , e.g . examine ( combined histological test ) product adhesion cerebral tissue etc . 4.7 The subject ask attend return visit telephone follow-up session Day 90±10 180±20 post operation .</detailed_description>
