	<detailed_description>1 . Several author report frequent admixture clear cell ovarian carcinoma serous , mucinous , endometrioid tumor . However , paper address difference response chemotherapy survival patient pure mixed-type advance clear cell carcinoma . 2 . Recent trend clinical management advance ovarian cancer include increase attention maximal cytoreduction general acceptance paclitaxel-platinum-based adjuvant chemotherapy . 3 . The introduction paclitaxel markedly change postoperative management ovarian cancer patient , result value new effort therapy apply clear cell carcinoma yet undetermined . 4 . Today , paclitaxel-platinum-based chemotherapy become standard regimen ovarian cancer worldwide . Previous research suggest potential benefit paclitaxel plus carboplatin regimens stage I clear cell carcinoma . However , paper specifically address efficacy paclitaxel-platinum-based chemotherapy advance clear cell carcinoma clear cell carcinoma occur rarely Western country .</detailed_description>
