	<brief_summary>The purpose study evaluate efficacy Cook Biodesign mesh repair complex ventral incisional hernia . Using material reinforce tissue defect indicate standard care type surgery . The Cook Biodesign mesh currently FDA-approved implantation reinforce soft tissue weakness exists , investigator would like collect additional follow-up information continue ass durability repair placement hernia mesh . This follow-up would include collection information complication infection seromas ( collection fluid around surgery site ) , well hernia recurrence quality life questionnaire . Patients qualify take part study diagnose ventral incisional hernia schedule surgical hernia repair . This surgery `` open '' surgical procedure reinforce tissue material indicate type hernia repair .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Observational Study Evaluate Ventral Incisional Hernia Repair Using Biologic Mesh ( Cook Biodesign )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Prior schedule surgery , patient consent complete brief quality life survey . They also ask question medical history pertain study , current/ past abdominal infection surgery , history hernia , comorbidities , etc . During surgery , key data point record research coordinator , time surgery , type case , size mesh use , size hernia defect , technique use , type suture use , etc . The mesh place either retrorectus intraperitoneally , component separation complete . The mesh use `` bridge , '' fascial layer close completely . The research staff may photograph repair enrolled patient 's hernia treatment supply copy photograph Cook Medical , Inc. sponsor 's review request . Any photograph take research purpose keep password-protected , encrypted database separate patient identify information .</detailed_description>
