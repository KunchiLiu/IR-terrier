	<brief_summary>The researcher study observe treatment multi-drug resistant Mycobacterium tuberculosis ( MDR-TB ) South Africa . MDR-TB treat usual TB drug need treat special drug . The patient need take drug two year . Certain hospital already agree participate research project , half hospital assign nurse case manager half . The researcher study benefit nurse case manager improve treatment response patient drug resistant TB . The researcher believe nurse case management ( NCM ) intervention sit increase MDR-TB cure completion rate ( i.e . treatment success ) comparison usual care ( UC ) , i.e . standardize programmatic management alone , patient without HIV co-infection . To , researcher review medical information collect hospital part patient 's treatment obtain patient 's permission .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Nurse Case Management Intervention Improve MDR-TB/HIV Co-Infection Outcomes</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Mycobacterium tuberculosis ( TB ) remain leading cause death among person live Human Immunodeficiency Virus/Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome ( HIV/AIDS ) southern Africa . This syndemic place overwhelm burden healthcare worker health system . Drug-resistant TB remain grow threat public health despite advance treatment diagnosis past decade . South Africa world 's high rate TB/HIV co-infection rank fourth worldwide multi-drug resistant ( MDR ) TB incidence HIV prevalence . Treatment MDR-TB , define resistance isoniazid rifampin , remain challenge treatment course complex . Success second line treatment regimens considerably less likely first line treatment significantly adverse drug reaction ( ADRs ) . Prospective cohort study South Africa report less 50 % treatment success ( i.e . cure completion ) significant difference patient without HIV note . Differences sex gender well age rarely evaluate . In addition management complexity length treatment , system level factor access care healthcare capacity contribute poor treatment outcome . Insufficient number train physician capable clinically competent manage challenge integrate MDR-TB/HIV care commonplace . These circumstance place heavy burden abundant healthcare resource South Africa , nurse . Nurses proficiency care model diseases essential improve treatment outcomes . The investigator experience dictate , however , patient endure lengthy treatment little assessment , support guidance nursing professional due lack training well lack evidence-based intervention delineate model care MDR-TB patient . Nurse case management ( NCM ) model register nurse facilitates coordinate treatment plan ensure timely , evidence-based care give improve treatment outcome . Presently , little evidence describe model TB/HIV co-infected patient globally , specifically less evidence MDR-TB/HIV sub-Saharan Africa . Many study , however , demonstrate substantial improvement disease outcomes utilizing nurse case manager . Complex diseases heart failure , diabetes , HIV drug susceptible TB among . Substantial gap remain , however , investigator understand impact intervention among co-infected patient , influence model among different age group cost-benefit resourced setting . Prior study provide strong evidence intervention must multi-faceted foster system level approach improve treatment outcome ( i.e . NCM patient-centered care service couple system level approach care coordination ) . The Chronic Care Model identify essential element health care system encourage high-quality chronic disease care system approach . These element provide conceptual model implementation structure propose NCM plus health system strengthen ( i.e . NCM-plus ) intervention , multi-faceted health system patient-centered intervention improve MDR-TB/HIV treatment outcome . The propose 5-year cluster randomize trial , evaluate NCM-plus intervention MDR-TB treatment outcome South Africa , epicenter MDR-TB/HIV epidemic . Primary Aim : To determine impact NCM model ( i.e . NCM-Plus ) MDR-TB outcomes patient without HIV co-infection South Africa cluster randomize trial . Hypothesis : Nurse case management ( NCM ) intervention sit increase MDR-TB cure completion rate ( i.e . treatment success ) comparison usual care ( UC ) , i.e . standardize programmatic management alone , patient without HIV co-infection . Secondary Aims : 1 . To conduct sub-group analysis ) HIV co-infection ; b ) sex gender ; c ) age 2 . To compare frequency time identification adverse drug event intervention control sit . 3 . To conduct cost analysis cost-effectiveness evaluation intervention .</detailed_description>
