	<brief_summary>Aldosterone target mineralocorticoid receptor imply development cardiovascular disease arterial high blood pressure cardiac failure . Serum aldosterone level insufficient know mineralocorticoid receptor activate . The aim study identify biomarkers mineralocorticoid receptor activity . The first `` candidate biomarker '' Neutrophil gelatinase-associated lipocalin ( NGAL ) `` lipocalin '' measure blood urine . According scientific knowledge 's evolution , others biomarkers could test later thanks blood urinary sample take study .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>This study break 5 group : The first pre-analytical study determinate optimum condition lipocalin sample . The second focus intra-individual variation lipocalin level blood urine . The third determinate normal value lipocalin blood urine . Fourthly , study role renal function serum urine lipocalin level . Fifthly , study role anti-aldosterone treatment patient suffer primary hyperaldosteronism .</detailed_description>
