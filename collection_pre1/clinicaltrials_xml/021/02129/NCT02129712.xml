	<brief_summary>This research leverage novel pilot research conduct investigator take important first step address neurocognitive late effect intervene early , treatment , promise computerized cognitive remediation program prevent downward trajectory neurocognitive function experience pediatric brain tumor survivor . Specifically , propose test feasibility , acceptability , initial proof concept neuroplasticity-based adaptive cognitive training program ( Cogmed ) train work memory ( WM ) attention newly diagnose youth brain tumor . Further , test feasibility use intervention true prospective design begin pre-surgery examine effect intervention deflect downward trajectory cognitive function child brain tumor treatment . We also use functional neuroimaging ( near infrared spectroscopy - `` NIRS '' ) examine effect program brain activation frontal region affect treatment . Findings pilot study inform development large multi-site randomize efficacy trial test individualize cognitive training program . Aim 1 . To test feasibility acceptability enrol youth ( 7 16 years-old ) newly diagnose brain tumor time diagnosis , follow patient 10 week , deliver Cogmed computer-based training program randomize trial 10-weeks post-diagnosis , follow patient 1 year post-diagnosis . Aim 2 . To test initial acceptability efficacy Cogmed training program cognitive function newly diagnose pediatric brain tumor patient .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Neuroplasticity-Based Cognitive Remediation Pediatric Brain Tumor Survivors</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Over 4,000 child diagnose brain tumor U.S. year advance treatment lead significant increase survival rate patient . However , result disease treatment surgery , radiation , chemotherapy , pediatric brain tumor patient show deficit frontal lobe function include several aspect executive function , show significant decline time . Remediation deficits critical target research . Major change brain maturation connectivity occur childhood adolescence , make potentially critical window opportunity neuroplasticity-based cognitive intervention support neural change integrate multiple key region . Computerized cognitive training program use successfully patient schizophrenia , individual ADHD , prodromal adolescent risk psychosis . However , program limit application pediatric brain tumor survivor untested brain tumor patient undergoing treatment . We aim blend longitudinal intervention research design use successfully previous study test feasibility , acceptability , initial efficacy neuroplasticiy-based cognitive training program , Cogmed , enhance work memory attention child adolescent diagnose brain tumor . First , use longitudinal design , collaboration Dr. Wellons ( pediatric neurosurgeon ) Dr. Friedman ( pediatric hematology/oncology ) , recruit patient time diagnosis conduct cognitive test pre-surgery approximately 10 week post diagnosis ( randomization ) , 5-7 week post Cogmed start ( post-intervention ) , 10-20 week post Cogmed start ( follow-up ) , 1 year post diagnosis ( long term follow-up ) . Second , embed test efficacy Cogmed longitudinal design randomize patient 10-weeks post-diagnosis . Half undergo Cogmed computerize adaptive cognitive training ( treatment condition ) 5 week half assign non adaptive Cogmed computerize cognitive training ( control condition ) . We use near infrared spectroscopy , noninvasive functional imaging method use infrared light detect change cortical hemoglobin level randomization , post-intervention , follow-up , long term follow-up . We expect Cogmed , administer home hospital , feasible acceptable majority ( 85 % ) patient . Further , hypothesize adaptive Cogmed training help improve work memory attention skill increase frontal cortical activity brain tumor patient receive remediation program compare receive non-adaptive control version program . Using growth curve analysis , expect patient receive intervention show deflection negative trajectory cognitive function time . Findings pilot study use develop application multi-site randomized clinical trial test intervention large sample pediatric brain tumor patient .</detailed_description>
