	<brief_summary>In study , evaluate efficacy sustainability Linking Families Together ( LIFT ) intervention improve parental monitoring transition middle high school particularly risky time student ' academic performance health behavior . This study base middle school around Los Angeles County region high prevalence teen risky health behavior . The aim study : 1 . To conduct randomized trial LIFT intervention examine whether provide detailed academic information parent child 's 7th 8th grade increase parental monitor end two year intervention one year follow . We partner 3-10 middle school recruit 500 student-parent dyad : 250 randomize intervention arm 250 usual care control group . 2 . To determine whether LIFT intervention improve student ' academic outcome , measure grade , attendance , standardized test score end two year intervention one year follow . 3 . To evaluate whether LIFT intervention lower rate adolescent risky health behavior , specifically substance use ( alcohol , marijuana , inhalant , drug ) end two year intervention one year follow .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Despite parental monitoring school involvement among important protective factor lead positive teen academic health trajectory , theoretically base rigorously evaluated intervention test strategy support low income parent adolescent transition middle high school , particularly risky time student ' academic health behavior . In successful pilot study , student 's miss assignment information communicate directly parent . Intervention parent nearly twice likely report child tell enough school work control parent . After 6 month , intervention student 0.19 standard deviation increase GPA control group 0.20 standard deviation high standardized math test score . In proposed study , evaluate efficacy sustainability intervention improve parental monitoring thus improve academic outcome reduce risky health behavior . The adapted intervention also include session parent build positive parent-child communication awareness school expectation . We propose randomize controlled trial 2 arm examine whether provide parent detailed information child 's academic behavioral performance school combination basic parent support , increase parental monitoring low-income , minority family . We hypothesize good parental monitoring lead improve academic behavioral performance . Using design determine whether impact information parent intervention also protective teen engage risky health behavior . We compare experimental control group parent examine whether provide high-quality academic information parent middle school student increase parental monitoring , student academic performance , teen health outcome middle school beyond . If intervention boost adolescent academic health outcome hypothesize , result propose study offer school low-cost strategy simultaneously positively influence student academic health trajectory . These finding potential stimulate new research improve health innovative intervention bolster parent teen relationship gain accrue throughout life span . The aim study : 1 . To conduct randomized trial LIFT intervention examine whether provide detailed academic information parent child 's 7th 8th grade increase parental monitor end two year intervention one year follow . We partner 3-10 middle school recruit 500 student-parent dyad : 250 randomize intervention arm 250 usual care control group . 2 . To determine whether LIFT intervention improve student ' academic outcome , measure grade , attendance , standardized test score end two year intervention one year follow . 3 . To evaluate whether LIFT intervention lower rate adolescent risky health behavior , specifically substance use ( alcohol , marijuana , inhalant , drug ) end two year intervention one year follow . Thus propose study build extends earlier pilot study recruit middle school around Los Angeles , offer parent additional support parent workshop , assess program 's impact adolescent behavioral outcome . Successfully implement study allow u demonstrate feasibility future randomize control trial ass effect size parental monitoring health outcome .</detailed_description>
