	<brief_summary>People type 1 diabetes need regular insulin injection continuous delivery insulin use pump . Keeping blood sugar normal range know reduce long term complication . However , achieve treatment goal difficult due risk low glucose level ( hypoglycaemia ) . One solution use system amount insulin inject closely matches blood sugar level continuous basis . This achieve know `` close loop system '' small glucose sensor place skin communicates computer contain algorithm drive subcutaneous insulin pump . Previous study conduct carefully control clinical research facility environment , Cambridge , United Kingdom , well several centre show closed-loop glucose control superior usual insulin pump therapy . The next logical step development pathway test close loop system home environment . An essential requirement conduct closed-loop study outside clinical research facility automate system wireless data transmission take place glucose sensor insulin pump . The purpose present study evaluate efficacy safety automate overnight closed-loop , child adolescent type 1 diabetes , use novel system great potential use home setting . The study take place clinical research facility two occasion , use standardise protocol . The performance closed-loop system evaluate day 1 continuous glucose monitoring ( CGM ) sensor life compare day 3 4 sensor life . Data experience gain study use refinement development system future home use .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Automated Closed-loop Children Adolescents With Type 1 Diabetes</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The main objective current study evaluate efficacy , safety utility/reliability novel automate overnight closed-loop glucose control system child adolescents type 1 diabetes . This inform future development closed-loop system child adolescent age 6 18 year type 1 diabetes . This open-label , randomised , 2-period cross-over study , use Medtronic Android close loop platform similar , compare safety efficacy overnight closed loop glucose control day 1 compare day 3 4 CGM sensor life . Participants randomise undergo two overnight study clinical research facility , glucose level control computer-based closed-loop algorithm day 1 CGM sensor insertion day 3 4 sensor insertion . A total 16 child adolescent T1D 6 18 year age recruit Outpatient Diabetes Clinic Department Paediatrics , Addenbrooke 's Hospital Paediatric Diabetes Centres London , Norwich , Ipswich , allow 12 available assessment . All participant insulin pump treatment good knowledge insulin dose adjustment . The study take place Wellcome Trust Clinical Research Facility ( WTCRF ) , Cambridge . Participants admit clinical research facility even stay follow morning . During two closed-loop visit , automate closed-loop glucose control wireless data transmission perform . A Model-Predictive-Control algorithm determine insulin infusion rate base interstitial glucose measure continuous subcutaneous glucose monitoring ( CGM ) system . Intravenous sample glucose insulin level also carry study visit post hoc validation glucose sensor data future modelling purpose . The primary efficacy endpoint time spend target plasma glucose range 3.9 8 mmol/L . Safety evaluation focus frequency duration episodes hypoglycaemia .</detailed_description>
