	<brief_title>Immune Reconstitution Stem Cell Transplant Recipients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The investigator propose systematically collect specimen blood plasma donor recipient SCT . For recipient , sample may collect follow time point transplant milestone . If recipient able present SCCC/UMHC window one milestone visit , specify collection may miss due unavailability . The recipient may resume sample collection subsequent collection period . Collections may receive within 30 day prior transplantation , approximately 30 day ( +/- 7 business day ) , 60 day ( +/- 14 business day ) , 100 day ( +/- 21 business day ) , six month ( +/- 21 business day ) , one year ( +/- 21 business day ) , annually ( +/- 21 business day ) thereafter follow SCT . Up three additional sample , collect frequently weekly , may collect recipient experience complication ( e.g. , viral reactivation ) associate abnormal T cell immune recovery SCT . A sample may also remove equal less 1 % total product volume donor collection , prior recipient infusion . For donor , one sample collect prior stem cell mobilization G-CSF . Assays perform may include follow : 1 ) Functional study antigen-specific T cell response pathogen ( e.g. , cytomegalovirus ) antigens ( e.g. , define epitope identify potential malignancy-specific target ) ( 8,15 ) ; 2 ) T cell immunophenotyping ( define recovery T cell subset associate `` naive '' `` memory '' T cell phenotype ) ( 16,17 ) ; 3 ) Studies examine molecular diversity T cell repertoire ( 18,19 ) ; 4 ) Studies identify recent thymic emigrant peripheral blood determine extent thymic function occur steady state follow BMT ( 11,20 ) ; 5 ) Assays plasma level cytokine ( e.g. , interleukin-7 ) may important T cell reconstitution ( 21,22 ) . Some study may perform time collection . In case , cryopreserved PBMC plasma sample use assay . Cryopreserved cell excess requirement study immune reconstitution bank allow access investigator specimen . By increase understand immune recovery post-stem cell transplantation , investigator able develop strategy improve immune recovery reduce graft-versus-host disease test future clinical trial . It investigators ' goal develop graft engineering strategy improve important clinical problem SCT patient . The purpose protocol study immune reconstitution graft-versus- host disease stem cell transplant recipient , study role donor cell clinical regimen process .</detailed_description>
