	<brief_title>Comparison Outcomes During MRI Sedation With Midazolam-dexmedetomidine Versus Ketamine-dexmedetomidine</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The randomize , double-blind , prospective study . All patient refer UCSS brain MRI dexmedetomidine would otherwise sedation regimen choice eligible enrollment . The investigator propose limit study patient undergo brain MRI study predictable length ( 25-30 minute ) ; therefore sedation regimen easily standardize . Parents eligible patient would approach prior pre-sedation assessment tell study , agree enroll , informed consent would obtain . Assent obtain child 7 year age great , otherwise developmentally capable give assent . The goal enroll 50 subject ( 25 per treatment group ) would sufficient detect 25 % great difference mean maximal heart rate blood pressure decrease baseline 2 group . Following consent , subject would randomize sedated either midazolam-dexmedetomidine ketamine-dexmedetomidine , upon achieve appropriate depth sedation , undergo MRI . Monitoring MRI subsequent recovery would occur compliance current Norton Children 's Hospital Sedation policy . Recovery-related behavior would assess use Pediatric Anesthesia Emergence Delirium Scale .</detailed_description>
