	<detailed_description>The work evaluate metabolic cost daily activity across lifespan evaluate influence functional impairment . The project simultaneously conduct cross-sectional case-control study . The primary aim investigate cross-sectional association old age energy expenditure daily activity recruit approximately 25 adult 7 age group ( 20-30,30-40,40-50,50-60,60-70,70-80,80+ ) total 180 individual . A secondary aim investigate effect functional impairment energy expenditure daily activity conduct case-control study . An additional 25 old adult functional impairment recruit age decade ( 60-70 , 70-80 , 80+ year old ) accomplish aim . Additional outcomes evaluate rating perceive exertion difference daily activity . A tertiary aim investigate use accelerometer predict metabolic cost daily activity .</detailed_description>
