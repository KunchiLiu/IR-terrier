	<brief_summary>Lumbar spondylolysis relatively common condition cause severe perennial back pain young population . Conservative treatment condition may futile , may eventually require surgical treatment direct repair par defect segmental lumbar fusion anterior posterior approach . Recently , surgical treatment method spondylolysis , direct repair surgery par defect focus due inherit strength . Most importantly , fusion surgery cause affected segment lose nature range motion furthermore adjacent segment adversely affect adjacent disc disease degeneration , direct repair theoretically could preserve motion affect segment , cause adjacent segment problem fusion surgery , well could produce good surgical outcome relatively less invasive technique compare fusion surgery . Moreover , previous article demonstrate direct repair surgery spondylolysis lumbar spine could achieve great functional radiological outcome . However , previous study conduct use low level design study retrospective small sample size , thereby prior literature provide clear information therapeutic outcome direct repair lumbar spondylolysis , especially manage spondylolysis young population . Therefore , The investigator aim evaluate determine outcome direct repair surgery lumbar spondylolysis young population . To knowledge , first report describe functional radiological outcome direct repair spondylolysis young population prospective cohort study design relatively large sample size .</brief_summary>
