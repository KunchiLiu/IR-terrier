	<brief_summary>A significant amount preclinical correlative clinical data suggest HER2-positive breast cancer could amenable immune¬therapeutic approach . The presence HER2-overexpression breast cancer associate high level proliferation , high histologic grade high level tumor infiltrate lymphocyte ( TILs ) compare HER2-negative tumor . The investigator therefore hypothesize HER2-positive tumor , avoidance destruction host immune system must important mechanism contribute tumor growth progression . The term `` immune evasion '' refers ability tumor suppress change host anti-tumor immune reaction . The programmed cell death 1 ( PD-1 ) pathway represent major immune control switch may engage tumor cell overcome active T-cell immune surveillance . The ligands PD-1 ( PD-L1 PD-L2 ) constitutively express induced various tumor . High expression PD-L1 tumor cell ( less extent PD-L2 ) find correlate poor prognosis survival various solid tumor type . Furthermore , PD-1 suggest regulate tumor-specific T-cell expansion patient malignant melanoma . These observation suggest PD-1/PD-L1 pathway play critical role tumor immune evasion could consider attractive target therapeutic intervention several solid organ type . MK-3475 ( previously know SCH 900475 ) potent highly-selective humanized mAb IgG4/kappa isotype design directly block interaction PD-1 ligands , PD-L1 PD-L2 . MK-3475 strongly enhance T lymphocyte immune response culture blood cell healthy human donor , cancer patient , primatesMK-3475 also modulate level interleukin-2 ( IL-2 ) , tumor necrosis factor alpha ( TNFα ) , interferon gamma ( IFNγ ) , cytokine . The investigator therefore propose evaluate addition immunotherapy reverse trastuzumab resistance improve clinical outcome HER2-positive disease . In study investigator determine monoclonal antibody target PD-1 , T cell negative regulator , reverse trastuzumab resistance patient previously progress trastuzumab .</brief_summary>
