	<brief_summary>Ulcerative colitis ( UC ) represent one major entity idiopathic inflammatory bowel disease define chronically relapse inflammation gastrointestinal tract due specific pathogen . It characterise superficial , continuous mucosal inflammation , predominantly affect large intestine . The clinical course typically mark period asymptomatic remission punctuate unpredictable recurrent attack . The symptoms patient mark persistent diarrhoea severe faecal urgency often incontinence , rectal bleeding , abdominal cramp weight loss . Uncontrolled activation mucosal effector T cell identify main pathogenic mechanism involve initiation perpetuation intestinal inflammatory reaction . Patients moderate UC initially treat mesalazine , apply orally rectally . If symptom improve , systemic corticosteroid administer . Patients respond systemic corticosteroid may become eligible treatment calcineurin inhibitor anti-tumor necrosis factor ( TNF ) α antibody . Alternatively , patient may undergo major colorectal surgery . Patients adequately respond treatment strategy exhibit serious drawback . Colorectal surgery may result severely compromise quality life . Therefore , patient moderate severe UC may significantly benefit new therapeutic alternative . The transcription factor GATA-3 interesting target novel therapeutic strategy UC . GATA-3 key regulation factor Th2-driven immune response . It indispensable differentiation activation Th2 cell , integrate Th2 signal , induces Th2 cytokine expression . Results recent clinical trial child show GATA-3 involved pathogenesis acute phase UC . The investigational product SB012 contain DNAzyme hgd40 target GATA-3 . By cleave GATA-3 mRNA hgd40 reduces specific cytokine production thereby reduce key feature mucosal inflammation . DNAzymes completely generate chemical synthesis , use living organism therefore biological drug . This study evaluate efficacy , safety , tolerability pharmacokinetics topical formulation SB012 available concentration 7.5mg/ml hgd40 30ml PBS daily ready-for-use enema patient active UC .</brief_summary>
