	<brief_title>Safety Study Carotid Body Neurostimulation Treat Cerebral Vasospasm</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The Delta system intend deliver electrical modulation signal carotid body , result cerebral vasodilation blood flow augmentation brain , treatment patient suffer vasospasm post aSAH . In clinical trial Delta system intend used patient rupture aneurysm secure , hospitalize neuro ICU ( Intensive Care Unit ) anesthetize intubate , diagnose suffer cerebral vasospasm , fulfill inclusion criterion none exclusion detail study protocol . The system intend used 7 day hospital supervision routinely provide stabilize patient follow SAH secure aneurysm . Follow period 30 day end treatment . The Delta system comprise two main element : Electrical Stimulation Unit ( ESU ) Delivery kit.The ESU reusable external autonomic stimulator unit , cable graphic user interface ( GUI ) software base PC tablet . The delivery kit disposable stimulate lead shaft accessory . The procedure include insertion lead shaft guide needle via patient neck , electrode position adjacent carotid body . Therapy parameter set physician monitoring continue patient hospitalization determine therapy discontinue shaft remove . Twenty three ( 23 ) patient recruit study , include 3 roll-in patient . The study open label , uncontrolled , non-randomized , multicenter feasibility study . This study recruit male female adult patient aSAH secondary rupture aneurysm , secure coil clipping , WFNS grade I-IV . Only anesthetized intubated patient recruit study . This study evaluate safety performance Delta system . The potential benefit risk participation study clearly identify informed consent form explain subject prior participate study . Study treatment - The Delta system insert minimally exposure carotid bifurcation . The system electrically stimulate carotid body chemoreceptor , aim achieve sustainable cerebral vasodilation induce enhancement cerebral perfusion thereby minimize ischemia consequently prevent delay neurological deficit . Treatment delta system intend seven ( 7 ) day . Manufacturing assemble Delta system do certify facility . Further information complete detail regard device material , specification , design , quality assurance , etc . find Investigator 's Brochure . Risk benefit rational - reverse vasospasm increase cerebral blood flow ( CBF ) major component cerebral perfusion augmentation , result reduce rate vasospasm complication . The Delta system may provide vasospasm subject novel treatment option . Based Delta system design , extensive pre-clinical test conduct system comparison similar device alternative treatment , company believe system safe use beneficial reduction delay cerebral ischemia complication vasospasm relate . Statistical analysis plan - Sample size study determine secondary end point . Sample size N=20 achieve : - 88 % power detect CBF decrease ≥ 15 % least one affected cerebral artery measure TCD . - 88 % power detect increase artery diameter ≥15 % least one affect main cerebral artery measure DSA CTA . - 99 % power detect CBF increase ≥20 % measure CerOx monitor system Licox® monitoring system . All estimate standard deviation 0.2 alpha 0.05 , use one-sample t-test analysis . The sample size also serve qualitative analysis primary end point . A t-test statistical hypothesis test test statistic follow Student 's distribution null hypothesis support . It use determine two set data significantly different continue parameter ( artery diameter ) , commonly apply test statistic would follow normal distribution value scale term test statistic know . The estimation significant clinical difference well assumed standard deviation base previous experience device . When scale term unknown replace estimate base data , test statistic ( certain condition ) follow Student 's distribution . Data management plan - Data management directly provide contract sponsor compliant requirement ISO 14155:2011 . The Sponsor designee provide investigator Case Report Form ( CRF ) booklet subject enrol study train site personnel correct manner record data . The appropriate CRFs complete signed Investigator appropriate . All CRFs complete legible manner blue black ink . Any correction make draw single line incorrect entry , enter correct information , initial date change . Data entry box space leave blank , instead indicate : NA applicable , ND do `` - '' miss available data . The original signed form , copy , return Sponsor . All clinical data generate study submit Sponsor designee quality assurance review , data entry , statistical analysis . All form review completeness . Any recording error correct contact appropriate clinical site . Double-entry routine utilized reduce data entry error , computerize edit routine use identify unusual data entry verification prior statistical analysis .</detailed_description>
