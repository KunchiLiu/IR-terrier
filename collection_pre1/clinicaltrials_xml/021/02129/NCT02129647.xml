	<brief_title>Study Axitinib Patients With Neurofibromatosis Type 2 Progressive Vestibular Schwannomas</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>NF2 condition mainly affect skin nervous system . It cause non-cancerous tumor grow nerve around person 's body . Some sign NF2 include gradual loss hearing tumor grow skin , brain spinal cord , lead complication . AXITINIB oral drug ( take mouth ) approve United States Food Drug Administration ( FDA ) treatment type tumor . However , research study , AXITINIB consider investigational approved FDA treatment NF2 . Much know regard well tolerate ( handle ) , investigator know effective treating NF2 . This research study test whether AXITINIB may shrink tumor commonly find patient NF2 stop grow . This help decide AXITINIB use treat NF2 patient future . AXITINIB drug use treat various form cancer . It study treatment tumor NF2 patient . Investigators select AXITINIB clinical trial patient NF2 NF2-related tumor similar drug , bevacizumab , shrink Vestibular Schwannomas ( VS ) NF2 patient . Pfizer , Inc. , manufacturer study drug , AXITINIB , provide AXITINIB use study . Primary Objective : To estimate objective volumetric response rate axitinib adult NF2 patient VS . Secondary Objectives : To assess toxicity axitinib give daily patient NF2 examine association objective measure response MRI , i.e . volumetric tumor analysis clinical measure response , i.e . ( audiogram ) , well quality life assessment ( NFTI-QOL ) . In addition , response non-VS tumor , schwannomas meningioma , may explore .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Inclusion criterion Age ≥18 year Meets clinical diagnostic criterion NF2 At least one volumetrically measurable ≥1 cc NF2related VS ( histological confirmation require ) MRI evidence progression ( either &gt; 2 mm increase maximum linear diameter conventional MRI , &gt; 20 % volume increase 3D volumetrics ) past ≤18 month , OR progressive hear loss , define decline word recognition score 95 % critical difference interval baseline score related VS ( i.e. , due prior intervention surgery radiation ) Karnofsky performance status ( PS ) 60100 % . Note : Patients unable walk paralysis , wheelchair , consider ambulatory purpose assess performance score . Adequate bone marrow function show : absolute neutrophil count ≥1.5 x 10^9/L , Platelets ≥100 x 10^9/L , Hb &gt; 9 g/dL Adequate liver function show : serum bilirubin ≤1.5 x upper limit normal ( ULN ) ALT AST ≤2.5x ULN INR ≤1.5 . ( anticoagulation low molecular weight heparin allow stable dose &gt; 2 week time enrollment . ) Adequate renal function : serum creatinine ≤1.5 x ULN Fully recover acute toxic effect prior chemotherapy , biological modifier radiotherapy Any neurologic deficit must stable ≥1 week Able provide sign informed consent Exclusion criterion Patients currently receive medical anticancer therapy receive medical anticancer therapy within 4 week start study drug ( include chemotherapy , antibody base therapy , etc . ) Radiation therapy study target tumor within 1 year prior enrollment , radiation therapy within 4 week prior enrollment . Patients major surgery significant traumatic injury within 4 week start study drug , patient recover side effect major surgery ( define require general anesthesia ) patient may require major surgery course study Prior treatment bevacizumab agent target vascular endothelial growth factor ( VEGF ) VEGF receptor Prior treatment investigational drug within precede 4 week Unstable rapidly progressive disease , include patient require glucocorticoid symptomatic control brain spinal tumor Treatment strong CYP3A4 enzyme inhibitor inducer , include limited ketoconazole , itraconazole , ritonavir , phenytoin , carbamazepine , rifampin , rifabutin , phenobarbital St. John 's wort Requirement therapeutic anticoagulant therapy oral vitamin K antagonists ; lowdose anticoagulant maintenance patency central venous access devise prevention deep venous thrombosis allow ; therapeutic use low molecular weight heparin ( similar parenteral drug ) venousthromboembolic disease allow . Other malignancy within past 3 year except adequately treat carcinoma cervix basal squamous cell carcinoma skin . Patients severe and/or uncontrolled medical condition condition could affect participation study : Symptomatic congestive heart failure New York heart Association Class III IV unstable angina pectoris , symptomatic congestive heart failure , myocardial infarction within 6 month start study drug , serious uncontrolled cardiac arrhythmia clinically significant cardiac disease severely impaired lung function define spirometry diffusion capacity lung carbon monoxide ( DLCO ) 50 % normal predict value and/or O2 saturation 90 % less rest room air active ( acute chronic ) uncontrolled severe infection liver disease cirrhosis severe hepatic impairment ( ChildPugh class C ) . Impairment gastrointestinal function gastrointestinal disease may significantly alter absorption axitinib ( e.g. , ulcerative disease , uncontrolled nausea , vomit , diarrhea , malabsorption syndrome small bowel resection ) Patients active bleed diathesis Female patient pregnant breast feeding , adult reproductive potential use effective birth control method . Adequate contraception must use throughout trial 8 week last dose study drug , sex . ( Females childbearing potential must negative serum pregnancy test within 7 day prior administration axitinib ) Male patient whose sexual partner ( ) woman child bear potential , willing use adequate contraception , study 8 week end treatment History noncompliance medical regimen Patients unwilling unable comply protocol</criteria>
