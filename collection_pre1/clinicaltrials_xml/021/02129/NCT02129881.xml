	<brief_summary>A study ass cell therapy treatment prevent kidney transplant rejection . The trial involve purification naturally occur regulatory T cell ( nTregs ) living-donor renal transplant recipient . The cell grown laboratory re‐infused patient five day kidney transplant . This trial part international European Union fund consortium aim evaluate cellular immunotherapy solid organ transplantation ( The ONE Study ) . It anticipate immune regulation induce nTreg therapy eventually use recude need conventional immunosuppression transplant recipient .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>The ONE Study UK Treg Trial</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Decades immunosuppressive drug development produce array powerful pharmacological agent , various drawback treatment leave considerable room improvement . By harness power suppressive mechanism human immune system , regulatory cell therapy may able support peripheral tolerance induce level donor-specific unresponsiveness allows reduction use conventional immunosuppression organ transplant recipient . Several alternative regulatory cell type identify potential adjunct immunotherapy solid organ transplantation approach stage development would allow clinical test early-stage trial . The EU-funded international ONE study consortium aim answer question whether Treg treatment , immunoregulatory cell-based therapy , advance clinical management solid organ transplant recipient . This particular Treg trial aim explore potential Treg therapy adjunct immunosuppressive treatment living-donor renal transplant recipient clinical protocol design share investigator ONE study group test additional regulatory cell therapy seperate trial .</detailed_description>
