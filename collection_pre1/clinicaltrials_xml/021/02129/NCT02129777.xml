	<brief_title>Efficacy Safety Namilumab ( MT203 ) Plaque Psoriasis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The drug test study call namilumab . Namilumab test prove effectiveness treat moderate severe chronic plaque psoriasis . This study look improvement plaque psoriasis participant take namilumab . The study enrol 122 participant . Participants randomly assign ( chance , like flip coin ) one five treatment group undisclosed patient study doctor study ( unless urgent medical need ) : - Namilumab subcutaneous injection 300 mg Day 1 , 150 mg Days 15 , 43 71 - Namilumab subcutaneous injection 160 mg Day 1 , 80 mg Days 15 , 43 71 - Namilumab subcutaneous injection 100 mg Day 1 , 50 mg Days 15 , 43 71 - Namilumab subcutaneous injection 40 mg Day 1 , 20 mg Days 15 , 43 71 - Placebo ( dummy inactive subcutaneous injection ) - liquid solution look like study drug active ingredient Days 1 , 15 , 43 71 . This study consist two part . Eligible participant receive 10 week treatment double-blinded study medication , follow extended treatment period ( active extension period , intend 52 week ) open-label study medication . At Week 12 , participant assess primary endpoint response , determine course progression open-label treatment period . Participants show &gt; =75 % reduction Baseline ( Day 1 ) PASI Week 12 , `` Responders '' , begin washout interval ( maximum 24 week ) use study medication : interval continue partial ( 25 % ) loss Week 12 treatment response record assessment conduct 2-weekly basis - thereby prompt start dose open-label ( OL ) study medication ( Day 0 OL Week 52 OL ) . In contrast , participant show &gt; =75 % reduction Baseline PASI score Week 12 , `` Partial/Non-Responders '' , begin open-label extension period 4 week final dose blind study medication . Participants followed-up 18-week post-treatment assessment period medication give . During open-label extension period participant begin dose 80 mg namilumab ; however , inadequate treatment response record , dose escalation 150 mg namilumab implement .</detailed_description>
