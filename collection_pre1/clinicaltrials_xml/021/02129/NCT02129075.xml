	<brief_summary>This randomized phase II trial study well DEC-205/NY-ESO-1 fusion protein CDX-1401 ( CDX-1401 ) neoantigen-based melanoma-poly-ICLC vaccine ( poly-ICLC ) vaccine therapy work give without recombinant flt3 ligand ( CDX-301 ) treat patient stage IIB-IV melanoma . The cancer vaccine CDX-1401 attache protein make tumor cell . The vaccine help body recognize tumor fight cancer . The CDX-301 vaccine may help body make tumor fight cell , know dendritic cell . The poly-ICLC vaccine stimulate immune system may help dendritic cell mature recognize tumor . It yet know whether CDX-1401 poly-ICLC work well without CDX-301 treat melanoma .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>CDX-1401 Poly-ICLC Vaccine Therapy With Without CDX-301in Treating Patients With Stage IIB-IV Melanoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To determine whether immune response cancer/testis antigen 1B ( NY-ESO-1 ) elicit vaccination CDX-1401 ( anti-DEC205-NY-ESO-1 fusion protein vaccine ) plus polyinosinic-polycytidylic acid stabilize poly-L-lysine carboxymethylcellulose ( poly-ICLC ) substantially increase prior expansion number circulate dendritic cell ( DC ) therapy CDX-301 ( fms-related tyrosine kinase 3 ligand [ Flt3L ] ) ( recombinant flt3 ligand ) . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . To assess effect vaccine regimen immune response ongoing nascent antitumor response antigen associate melanoma ( e.g. , preferentially express antigen melanoma [ PRAME ] , melanoma antigen family A , 3 [ MAGE-A3 ] , tumor protein p53 [ p53 ] , premelanosome protein [ gp100 ] ) well memory viral response ( influenza A ) chronic viral response ( cytomegalovirus [ CMV ] , Epstein-Barr virus [ EBV ] ) . II . To assess effect vaccine regimen frequency phenotypic character peripheral blood mononuclear cell ( PBMC ) subsets include DCs , monocyte population , T cell , natural killer ( NK ) cell . III . To assess safety , tolerability , clinical efficacy vaccine regimen . OUTLINE : Patients randomize 1 2 treatment arm . ARM I : Patients receive recombinant flt3 ligand subcutaneously ( SC ) day -7 -1 , 1-3 , 22-28 course 1 day 1-3 course 2 ; DEC-205/NY-ESO-1 fusion protein CDX-1401 SC intradermally ( ID ) day 1 ; poly-ICLC SC day 1 . ARM II : Patients receive DEC-205/NY-ESO-1 fusion protein CDX-1401and poly-ICLC Arm I . In arm , treatment repeat every 28 day 4 course absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . After completion study treatment , patient follow 4 12 week annually thereafter .</detailed_description>
