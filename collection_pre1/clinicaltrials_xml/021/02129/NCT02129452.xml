	<brief_summary>The purpose study evaluate olfactory neuroepithelium biomarker Alzheimer disease . The early diagnosis Alzheimer disease importance obtain good response treatment , recently report biomarkers limitation . Olfactory neuroepithelium tissue accessible office-based biopsy without difficulty know reflect brain pathology confirm diagnosis Alzheimer disease . This study help early detection treatment Alzheimer disease .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Alzheimer disease common form dementia characterize insidious onset slow progression . Pathological change brain Alzheimer disease ( AD ) precede clinical symptom many year , early treatment provide good outcome . Consequently , detection AD early stage need . Biologic marker include beta-amyloid tau protein study early diagnosis AD . Recently remarkable biomarkers draw attention include CSF protein PIB ( Amyloid-binding carbon 11-labeled Pittsburgh compound B ) PET finding , pertain supportive marker since reflect brain pathology indirectly . Postmortem study AD patient reveal beta-amyloid tau protein find olfactory neuroepithelium correlate brain pathological change . Olfactory neuroepithelium tissue obtain office-based biopsy safely easily nasal endoscopy . Especially , early pathological change AD find entorhinal cortex piriform cortex adjacent olfactory neuroepithelium , study would valuable early detection AD . MicroRNAs small , single-stranded RNA comprise 20 nucleotide involve cell differentiation , growth death . Recently investigator report microRNA 206 important role pathomechanism AD , thus new biomarker disease-modifying therapeutic target AD . Study participant enrol primary care clinic department Neurology , Seoul National University Hospital . Patients ' clinical presentation , MMSE ( Mini mental status exam ) , CDR ( Clinical Dementia Rating ) ADAS-COG-K ( Alzheimer Disease Assessment Scale Cognitive Subscale ) collect routinely execute exams clinic . Participants categorize four group accord CDR , group enroll 10 patient respectively . The number 10 patient per group calculate base previous study , cost , time ethical perspective . Method olfactory neuroepithelium biopsy adopt Lovell et al . ( Arch Otolaryngol . 1982 ) . Concentrations beta-amyloid tau protein analyze ELISA , microRNA 206 RT-PCR , northern blot microarray . These data evaluate clinical feature exam result participant use general statistical method .</detailed_description>
