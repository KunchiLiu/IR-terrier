	<brief_title>Ibrutinib Treating Patients With Relapsed Refractory B-cell Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To evaluate efficacy ibrutinib patient relapse refractory B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia ( B-ALL ) measure objective response rate ( ORR ) . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . To evaluate global safety profile ibrutinib patient relapse refractory B-ALL . II . To assess response duration . III . To assess Bruton 's tyrosine kinase ( BTK ) target inhibition , biomarkers , gene expression profile B-ALL patient sample treatment ibrutinib . OUTLINE : Patients receive ibrutinib orally ( PO ) daily ( QD ) day 1-28 . Courses repeat every 4 week absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . After completion study treatment , patient follow 30 day .</detailed_description>
