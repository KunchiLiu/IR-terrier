	<brief_summary>This research study look imatinib affect dasatinib absorb eliminate body . Both imatinib dasatinib class medication call tyrosine kinase inhibitor ( TKI ) use treat certain type leukemia ( cancer begin white blood cell ) . Both imatinib dasatinib give safely healthy volunteer . In study investigator evaluate pharmacokinetics interaction imatinib dasatinib co-administered . The hypothesis imatinib increase blood level dasatinib inhibit drug metabolize enzyme efflux transporter involve dasatinib absorption removal . This research provide important new insight combination TKI therapy term transporter- enzyme- mediate pharmacokinetic interaction . The research result also help guide doctor know much tyrosine kinase inhibitor give safely reach best effect TKI combination therapy .</brief_summary>
