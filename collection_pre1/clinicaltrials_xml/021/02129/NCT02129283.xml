	<detailed_description>This study evaluate whether end-of-life simulation training critical care physicians nurse throughout Israel use standardized patient improve communication interpersonal skill lead improvement ICU care process , teamwork family satisfaction . Design- Simulation training include approximately 10-15 staff member 4-5 ICUs first 12 month study ( intervention group ) compare use stepped wedge design staff member another 4-5 ICUs receive initial simulation training ( control group ) first year receive training second year . To evaluate whether simulation training simulate standardized patient improve ICU professional 's communication interpersonal skill , baseline evaluation training evaluation training require . Training use 9 essential skill communication interpersonal relationship study Steering Committee chose include : How elicit patient preference ( include patient vs. family goal care ) ? How one listen ? How compassionate , show empathy respect ( include address emotion ) ? How handle unrealistic patient/family expectation ( include family request `` everything do '' ) ? How handle prognostic uncertainty ? How handle decision make ? How handle conflict sibling within team ? Physicians nurse work together , Becoming knowledgeable understanding Israeli Terminally Ill Law . Simulation sessions- The simulation session include 6 scenario . The simulation training compose several teaching session intersperse clinical scenario simulate standardized patient ( actor ) perform ICU doctor nurse several subsequent debriefing session . The entire interchange trainee ( ) actor video-taped educational purpose use subsequent debriefing . Evaluations- 1 . Baseline evaluation consist questionnaire self-evaluation , ICU process , teamwork family satisfaction performance test use simulation evaluation 9 skill teach training session . The trainee questionnaire include demographic information include age , gender , country birth , profession , education , year practice , hospital type ( private , governmental , health fund ) , number ICU bed , religion , religiosity , previous experience death Israeli Terminally Ill Law . The simulation evaluation access level knowledge , skill attitude . The baseline questionnaire administer morning simulation training prior date possible training begin . The questionnaire baseline repeat questionnaire 3-6 12 month train unit mail . The control group receive questionnaire ( baseline questionnaire repeat questionnaire 3-6 12 month later ) first year study ( second year simulation training occur ) ICUs mail . As National Project hope train ICU doctor nurse Israel next several year , try obtain baseline data ICU professional around country . The Israeli Society Critical Care Medicine agree participate study . Therefore , also obtain baseline information ICUs - include included study . ICU doctor nurse also answer doctor-nurse questionnaire ICU mail . It important see difference unit study . It also important repeat questionnaire ICUs study 1-2 year . 2 . Post- train questionnaires- immediately simulation train 3-6 12 month later self-assessment questionnaire 3-6 12 month later ICU process , teamwork family satisfaction questionnaire . The control group also post-training questionnaire , ICU process teamwork evaluation 3-6 12 month first assessment first 12 month study period . It important evaluate whether train intervention affect change short period ( 3-6 month ) prolong period ( 12 month ) . Potential variable questionnaire include : ICU process questionnaires- terminal illness define Law , advance directive durable power attorney , designate surrogate , physician nurse ask patient preference , documentation patient and/or surrogate preference , document family conference , receive CPR , ventilation , vasopressor dialysis , death precede DNRs , limitations life-sustaining treatment CPR , time ICU admission first discussion limitation , DNR death , time first discussion limitation death ; teamwork questionnaires- include nurse initiated discussion doctor , nurse initiated discussion family patient/family preference , unrealistic family expectation , family conflict , inappropriateness care , decision share nurse physician , nurse involvement EOL decision work autonomy ; family satisfaction questionnaires- complete family member ICU patient 2-4 month patient dy discharge ICU . They include completeness information , listening , trust , respect , ask patient preference family opinion , inclusion decision making , quality frequency communication , adequate time ask question , express fear emotion , emotional support , compassion show family , support family decision , consideration family need , achieve appropriate level care perception quality palliative care quality death die . Sample size justification statistical analyses- The power analysis show limit sample size smallest require prove disprove hypothetical effectiveness intervention , rather estimate chance reproduce significant improvement sample size suggest limited budget try best learn process . Power analysis perform use PowerAndPrecision ( version 4.1 ) use one tail alpha set 0.05 . The following example question likely answer current step wedge design cluster unit 30 40 team member : 1. knowledge team regard obligation current law provide support family die patients- Current survey show 50 % team aware legal obligation clearly improve workshop . A power analysis show n=30 group ( control intervention ) 91 % chance show increase 50 % 85 % ( Chi square Fisher 's exact test ) . 2. skill listening- If baseline , capacity listen rat self-assessment 3.5 Likert scale 1-5 , power analysis show n=40 group ( control intervention ) , 84 % chance show statistical significant increase 4.1 ( nearly 20 % ) workshop ( t-test ) . We compare change basic skill ( self-assessment questionnaire performance test ) , ICU process , teamwork care family satisfaction baseline period post-training period serve primary outcome study . Professional demographic organizational variable correlate actual improve skill performance , ICU process care , teamwork family satisfaction use multivariate analysis determine important variable lead change . The variable assess include : age , gender , profession , country train , year practice , religion , religiosity , previous experience death , large small ICU ( &lt; 10 vs. &gt; 10 bed ) hospital type ( private , governmental , health fund ) .</detailed_description>
