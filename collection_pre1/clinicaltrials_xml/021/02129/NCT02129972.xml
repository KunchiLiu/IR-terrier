	<brief_summary>The incidence Inflammatory Bowel Diseases ( IBD ) continuous progression adult child . The colonoscopy consider gold standard exam diagnosis follow-up patient present suspected IBD . The follow-up financial management kind pathology much dependent quality endoscopic image . Because colonoscopy expensive invasive technique assume general sedation , many effort do develop new less expensive less invasive technique order offer alternative classic colon endoscopy . One new technique colon videocapsule ( CVC ) endoscopy ( PillCam® colon 2 - Given Imaging , Yoqneam , Israel ) . This new promise semi-invasive endoscopic technique successfully validate adult . We hypothesize CVC use child similar result term efficacy , case adult . This prospective simple blind multicenter study , investigate diagnostic value CVC compare conventional colonoscopy general sedation detection control colon lesion child present IBD . If feasibility efficacy colon video capsule technique also proven use child , new technique might become interesting alternative endoscopic examination colon less expensive less invasive . Moreover , technique would useful mean lesion detection along digestive tract limit colon .</brief_summary>
