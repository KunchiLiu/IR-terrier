	<brief_summary>Glioblastoma multiforme ( GBM ) common malignant central nervous system ( CNS ) tumor adulthood median survival 12-16 month . The drastically short life expectancy , intellectual change rapid physical decline patient devastate impose profound chronic stress patient family . There extensive evidence chronic stress promote cancer growth progression . In set GBM patient , three major question still answer analysed study : 1 . Is prognostic significance stress patient newly diagnose GBM treatment tolerance ( progression free ) survival ? 2 . Can stress modulated factor , like stress patient partner patient physical activity , know independent prognostic factor recurrent glioma patient ? 3 . How longitudinal course patient partner stress physical condition disease course influence ( progression free ) survival ? Answers question help establish future project study non drug intervention patient patient partner help improve clinical tumor relate outcome patient newly diagnose GBM . The investigator hypothesize chronic stress , specifically measure disruption diurnal cortisol rhythmicity , independent prognostic factor patient GBM . Furthermore , physical activity patient stress level patient ` partner may impact - stress-modulating factors- stress patient prognosis . Aiming identify stress-related prognostic factor potential target novel treatment approach , propose , first step , prospective multicenter cohort study : patient newly diagnose GBM good performance status ( KPS ≥ 50 % ) undergo standard treatment combine radiochemotherapy temozolomide ( RCT ) follow 6 month cyclic temozolomide , eligible . In addition , one `` partner '' , define close person live home close daily contact patient , ask inclusion .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>General Aim The aim prospective , multicenter observational cohort study determine impact baseline bio-behavioral stress ( Aim I ) cancer progression survival patient newly diagnose glioblastoma ( GBM ) undergo standard radiochemotherapy . The role baseline physical activity ( PA ) baseline partner 's distress stress-modulating factor assess exploratory analysis . Secondary aim include longitudinal assessment self-reported psychological distress homogenous patient cohort partner ( Aim II ) -in translational subproject - determine role serum copeptin biomarker distress ( Aim III ) . Specific Aims Specific Aim I : Prognostic role stress time diagnosis GBM patient In analysis , baseline neuroendocrine stress correlate progression-free survival ( PFS ) . More specifically aim assess IA ) Whether stress-induced disruption diurnal cortisol rhythmicity measure salivary cortisol slope independent prognostic factor ( progression-free ) survival patient newly diagnose GBM undergo standard multimodal treatment . IB ) Whether increase baseline self-reported physical activity correlate low level stress ( i.e . act stress-modulating factor ) prolong ( progression-free ) survival IC ) Whether high level stress patient ' partner ( baseline diurnal cortisol slope ) correlate high level stress patient ( i.e . stress-modulating factor ) shorter ( progression-free ) survival Specific Aim II : Longitudinal cohort patient-partner dyad In cohort patient ( Aim I ) aim describe distress time ( three-monthly ) start combine radiochemotherapy disease progression patient - pair dyad - one close partner . Specific Aim III : Copeptin biomarker subproject In translational subproject aim assess prognostic role baseline serum copeptin- easy test serum biomarker stress many clinical situation , never assess cancer patient . Methods Study design Since prognostic role stress GBM study , propose first step observational , prospective multicenter cohort study well-defined group patient , stage disease ( initial diagnosis ) undergo standard multimodal treatment ( surgery follow radiochemotherapy accord R.Stupp et al. ) . Patients All patient good performance status ( Karnofsky Performance Score ( KPS ) ≥ 50 % ) , age 18 year old , histologically confirm , previously untreated GBM eligible prior start initial treatment radio-chemotherapy . In order participate , patient need give informed consent ethics-approved consent form need willing able ( judged investigator ) comply protocol . Cardiovascular contraindication 6-minute walk test ( 6MWT ) and/or history instable angina pectoris New York Heart Association ( NYHA ) grade II great congestive heart failure ( accord Thoracic Society recommendation ) preclude trial inclusion . Equally , patient sign symptom ( include laboratory finding ) condition , either metabolic psychological , interfere adequate assessment stress axis ( e.g . chronic use corticosteroid , psychiatric disorder medication ) exclude . Perioperative dexamethasone treatment exclusion criterion short time treatment clearly affect HPA axis synthetic corticosteroid discriminate salivary cortisol measurement . Inability follow study procedure , e.g . due language problem , psychological disorder , dementia confusion , another reason study exclusion . Patients ' partner Each patient designate close partner , ( necessarily intimate partner ) , either person live household daily contact ( husband/wife , marry partner , family member ) . In order participate , patient 's partner must older 18 year , good performance status ( KPS≥50 % ) , willing able ( judged investigator ) comply protocol must give informed consent . If patient partner partner willing part trial , participation cohort still possible ( group patient without partner analyze separately ) . Primary Endpoint Aim I The primary endpoint PFS , i.e . time diagnosis disease progression ( accord RANO criterion ) death cause . Response evaluation MRI do use criterion MacDonald et al . , specify RANO criterion . In brief , definition `` progression '' following : At least 25 % increase size solid mass contrast-enhancing lesion MRI ( CT ) appearance new lesion clinical deterioration . Secondary Endpoints Aim I Secondary endpoint include overall survival measure treatment tolerance : - Number patient , stop treatment reason progressive disease - Percentage plan temozolomide dos receive Study Flow Assessments Assessments Baseline ( T1 ) : predictor variable Baseline Assessment occur strictly defined time point ( T1 ) order minimize time-dependent confounders predictor variable ( particularly stress lab ) : Physical functioning test questionnaire perform day -3 start radiochemotherapy . Salivary cortisol sample perform day -2 -1 start radiochemotherapy . Baseline Consolidation ( T2 ) The visit take place 28d T1 patient start treatment ( `` steady-state '' ) , non-progressing patient ( vast majority early time-point ) include assessment T1 . The purpose T2 assessment validate T1 i.e . confirm T1 ( baseline ) representative condition patient partner early treatment exclude T1 assessment unrepresentative due impend start unknown treatment . T2 assessment analyze confirmatory baseline prognostic factor non-progressing patient . Follow visit progression ( FU1 ) Follow-up visit do every 12 week . The purpose FU1 visit ) measure disease status MRI aim I ( 1° endpoint ) ii ) longitudinally describe distress , emotional functioning quality life ( QoL ) patient partner aim II . Follow visit progression death ( patient ) ( FU2 ) After progression patient contact every three month survival status ( dead alive ) . Study procedures Stress Aim I ( predictor variable ) : Baseline Stress measurement patient well partner baseline ( T1 ) 4 week ( T2 ) ) Neuroendocrine stress evaluation use standard laboratory essay ( salivary diurnal cortisol slope , cortisol awaken response ( CAR ) , short adrenocorticotropic hormone ( ACTH ) -test well ii ) Self-reported psychological distress evaluation questionnaire ( distress thermometer perceive stress scale ) Aim II ( descriptive variable ) : Distress longitudinal cohort evaluate every three month patients-partners dyad self-reported measure DT PSS ( ii ) . Quality life emotional functioning also describe measure FACT-Br HADS-D score Ad . ) - Diurnal Cortisol Slope : Salivary cortisol level peak 30-60 minute awaken drop nadir sleep . This diurnal rhythm disrupt chronically stressed patient : lead flatten slope ( beta ) curve connects salivary cortisol concentration time ( awaken bedtime ) . Salivary cortisol measure two consecutive day ( patient receive kit `` salivettes '' container use home store refrigerator next day hospital visit ) . Salivary sample collect wake morning , 30 minute later ( CAR ) , 4pm 9pm . Cortisol level analyse do immunoassay ECLIA ( E170 Roche , Switzerland ) reference hospital ( University Hospital Basel ) . Sample storage shipment perform -20°C . - The cortisol awaken response ( CAR ) describe increase 50 % saliva cortisol level , occur 20-30 minute wake morning . It think link hippocampus ' preparation hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis ( HPA ) face anticipated stress independent circadian variation HPA axis . CAR provide easy measure capacity HPA axis react stress . An increased CAR associate burnout , worry chronic stress work . For CAR saliva sample collect two consecutive day passive drooling , immediately awaken ( 0 ` ) 30 min ( 30 ` ) later [ 45 ] . - As perioperative dexamethasone usually give patient , short `` low-dose '' ACTH test ( Synacthen test ) perform , rule relative adrenal insufficiency . The test reflect adrenal function validate save tool routinely use daily practice . A baseline sample Cortisol perform 1 ug Synacthen apply intravenous route . Stimulated Cortisol serum level measure exactly 30min Synacthen application . The test perform morning . Cortisol level analyse do immunoassay ECLIA ( E170 Roche , Switzerland ) . Ad ii ) The distress-thermometer ( DT ) 10-point scale display thermometer format originally develop Roth colleague ( Appendix 1 ) . Validity DT examine outpatient cancer patient well relative . The perceived stress scale ( PSS ) universally accept , standardized unidimensional scale ass perceive stress ask respondent report whether life seem unpredictable uncontrollable , feel overburden . It assess cognitively mediate emotional response objective event , rather objective event . Quality life ( QOL ) measure Functional Assessment Cancer Therapy ( FACT ) . The FACT comprise series questionnaire measure general QOL , well cancer- condition-specific symptom cancer treatment . The questionnaire broadly use validated several language , include German . The following scale use : FACT-Br ( brain ) , contain 37 item physical wellbeing , family/social wellbeing , emotional wellbeing functional wellbeing . For comparable evaluation partner , adapt version FACT-G ( general ) generate . Emotional functioning : The German version Hospital Anxiety Depression Scale ( HADS-D ) use assess current level depression anxiety . Each scale comprise 7 item , answer 4-point scale . The scale widely use evaluate emotional wellbeing patient chronic physical condition validated German language . Physical activity Exercise behavior evaluate patient well partner self-reported physical activity MET-hours per week , Godin-Leisure-Time-Exercise Questionnaire ( GLTEQ ) . In questionnaire -validated glioma patients- patient partner ask complete self-explanatory four-item query usual leisure-time exercise habit . -Physical condition ( patient ) test use internationally standardize test need extensive equipment ( important practicability multicenter set ) : A 6-Minute walking test ( 6MWT ) simple method evaluate functional capacity test multiple setting . Patients instructed walk fast pace cover long possible distance 6 minute supervision physical therapist . During exercise , oxyhemoglobin saturation heart rate monitor pulse oximetry . Aim III : Copeptin Arginine Vasopressin ( AVP ) hypothalamic stress hormone , produce hypothalamus release posterior pituitary . Together corticotropin-releasing hormone , lead secretion ACTH cortisol . With recent development novel sandwich immunoassay copeptin ( C-terminal glycoprotein pre-provasopressin ) , stable easy measure surrogate AVP secretion become available . ( Direct AVP measurement hamper technical , pre-analytical difficulty ) . As stress hormone copeptin mirror individual stress level even subtly cortisol .</detailed_description>
