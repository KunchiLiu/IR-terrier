	<brief_summary>Patients advance metastatic cholangiocarcinoma ( CCA ) eligible curative surgery , transplantation , ablative therapy receive nab-paclitaxel gemcitabine chemotherapy . The purpose study evaluate effectiveness safety combination nab-paclitaxel gemcitabine . The effectiveness determine improvement length time treatment , CCA get bad .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Phase II Trial Nab-Paclitaxel Gemcitabine First-Line Treatment Patients With Cholangiocarcinoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Advanced cholangiocarcinomas ( CCAs ) aggressive tumor median survival time diagnosis le 12 month , five-year overall survival ( OS ) ~5 % systemic chemotherapy . Currently available systemic therapy CCA largely ineffective , thus rationale propose research investigate target delivery chemotherapy . The goal study evaluate efficacy gemcitabine plus nab-paclitaxel patient advance CCA . This base premise nab-paclitaxel bind SPARC ( secrete protein acidic rich cysteine ) interaction albumin , leading increase intra-tumoral concentration gemcitabine decrease deoxycytidine deaminase ( CDA ) enzyme . We hope improve OS patient advance CCA use synergistic combination nab-paclitaxel gemcitabine specifically target SPARC protein peri-tumoral stroma . We aim provide critical data develop pharmacologic strategy target desmoplastic stroma order increase chemotherapy responsiveness CCAs . We also examine whether circulate tumor cell ( CTC ) level target gene expression analysis stromal SPARC level correlate patient outcome thus serve prognostic biomarkers . We evaluate role Human Equilibrative Nucleoside Transporter 1 ( hENT1 ) , CDA tumor fibrosis additional prognostic predictive biomarkers CCA . This clinical trial hope improve poor prognosis patient advance CCA establish activity platinum-free doublet , nab-paclitaxel plus gemcitabine show clear clinical benefit pancreatic cancer close biological parallel CCA . A maximum 70 patient enrol attain 67 eligible/evaluable patient . Stage I enroll 37 patient . If 21 patient alive progression-free 6 month , study proceed Stage II additional 33 patient enrol . Procurement archive tissue , available , previous diagnostic biopsy mandatory enrollment . If available , preclude participation trial , additional biopsy perform research purpose . Optional blood sample request .</detailed_description>
