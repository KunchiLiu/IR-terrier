	<brief_title>Mesenchymal Stem Cell Therapy Lung Rejection</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The overall clinical development strategy project conduct Phase I dose escalation study entitle `` A pilot Study Evaluate Safety Feasibility Mesenchymal Stem Cells Induce Remission Lung Transplant Patients Experiencing Treatment-Refractory Moderate Lung Rejection '' . This study perform current IND application limit propose 9 subject ( 3 subject dose escalate subject cohort ) . In application propose evaluate safety feasibility allogeneic , bone marrow ( BM ) derive mesenchymal stem cell ( MSC ) induce remission moderate treatment refractory bronchiolitis obliterans ( BO/BOS ) . Lung transplant patient treatment refractory BO/BOS ( grade 3 ) qualify second transplant near 100 % mortality extreme disability . MSCs multi-potent cell capacity induce tissue repair modulate immune response . They use successfully preclinical clinical study treat graft versus host disease ( GVHD ) inflammatory bowel disease . Patients progress moderate BO despite adequate medical treatment qualify second transplant receive intravenous treatment allogeneic MSC . The safety measure include tolerance MSC infusion absence significant cardiopulmonary compromise . The feasibility assessment include ease recruitment , practical issue transporting , prepare infuse MSCs . The clinical assessment initial safety study intend demonstrate safety human MSC subject BO evaluate cell dose demonstrate sign efficacy . Pending favorable safety result pharmacokinetic pharamcodynamic data obtain current propose study likely conduct additional human study direct focus evaluation efficacy collect additional safety information .</detailed_description>
