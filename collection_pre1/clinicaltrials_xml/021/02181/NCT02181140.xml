	<detailed_description>Endoscopic ultrasound establish examination method tumor gastrointestinal tract pancreas . Since image limited differential diagnosis tumor , EUS guide fine needle aspiration see valid complementary method . Since fine-needle aspiration ( FNA ) mainly base cytological diagnostics , method limit also lack supplementary immune- histochemical diagnostics . Here , obtainment little histologically evaluable tissue sample ( punched barrel ) would benefit . A new punch needle device call Pro-core needle ( Cook ) ( 22 / 19 gauge ) offer possibility increase number valid extraction histologically evaluable tissue due well target precision maneuverability comparison device kind ( tru-cut needle , e.g. ) . A little notch pinpoint allow obtainment little tissue sample , keep within device aspiration . This study compare obtainment tissue Proc-core needle conventional aspiration punction system .</detailed_description>
