	<brief_summary>This proof concept study propose target delivery broad-spectrum cytotoxic agent ( doxorubicin ) , via specially formulate LTSL ( ThermoDox® ) activate mild hyperthermia , use focus ultrasound ( FUS ) , achieve enhance intra-tumoural doxorubicin concentration systemic dose .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Targeted Chemotherapy Using Focused Ultrasound Liver Tumours</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The study split two part . Part I identify optimal FUS exposure parameter range patient BMIs tumour location within liver use real time thermometry data implant thermistor . After least 5 14 participant intervention use real-time thermometry , data review Trial Management Group ( TMG ) confirm readiness proceed without real-time thermometry . Part II , require thermistor implantation , design reflect therapy would implement clinical practice . All evaluable participant Part I Part II include endpoint analysis . To date , purely pharmacological approach fail address essentially threefold challenge : ( ) deliver therapeutically significant concentration active agent tumour vasculature minimize target effects; ( ii ) release therapeutic agent 'on-demand ' target site; , ( iii ) improve distribution spread therapeutic agent intra-tumoural pressure gradient order achieve therapeutically relevant concentration throughout tumour . If study demonstrate successful target drug delivery human subject use LTSLs release mild-hyperthermia , could potentially transform future chemotherapy clinical practice ; target therapy use LTSLs contain chemotherapeutic agent trigger non-invasively mild hyperthermia could apply solid organ cancer . This single centre trial sponsor University Oxford . The recruiting study site Oxford University Hospitals NHS Trust . Both extensive clinical FUS experience . The first extracorporeal FUS device Europe use study perform Oxford 2002 2004 . Recent pre-clinical study perform Oxford use ThermoDox® release use FUS show increase uptake target site achievable . Hence great promise use combination therapy achieve increase tumour uptake local dose equivalent dose doxorubicin use systemic chemotherapy human subject , well establish safe toxicity profile . Patients receive treatment 1 day follow 30 day .</detailed_description>
