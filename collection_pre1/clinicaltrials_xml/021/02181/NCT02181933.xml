	<brief_summary>The primary objective study evaluate efficacy nevirapine versus ZDV+3TC ( Zidovudine + Lamivudine ) , administer labor postdelivery , reduce peripartum mother child transmission HIV ( Human Immunodeficiency Virus ) . The secondary objective ass overall HIV transmission rate 2 group ( intrauterine , intrapartum postpartum 6 week ) well explore relationship infection time maternal dose relative birth , infant feeding method , maternal peripheral blood viral load , potential risk factor transmission . Following introduction second third Amendments Protocol , 2 substudies add . The objective substudies evaluate frequency resistance-conferring mutation nevirapine ( Amendment 2 ) ZDV+3TC ( Amendment 3 ) ; determine whether reversion resistant virus wild type ; determine resistant virus transmit mother child .</brief_summary>
