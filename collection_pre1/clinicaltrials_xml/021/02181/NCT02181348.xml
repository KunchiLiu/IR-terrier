	<detailed_description>Anemia one major health problem develop country world [ 1 ] . According WHO reference criterion , adult label anemic , blood hemoglobin concentration fall 13.0 g/dL men le 12.0 g/dL non-pregnant woman [ 2 ] . Hemoglobin concentration low limit normal common laboratory find apparently healthy people general population world [ 3-5 ] . Many mildly anemic individual investigate sufficiently establish probable cause anemia thus may end morbidity health problem , especially young woman develop country [ 4 ] . A human study past year suggest possible use antioxidant vitamin correction anemia [ 6 ] . Vitamin E essentially require lipophilic vitamin variety antioxidant non-antioxidant function . It show treatment vitamin E result increased number colony form unit erythroid precursor experimental animal protect bone marrow drug- induced toxicity [ 7 ] . In clinical trial patient hematological disorder , vitamin E supplementation show decrease red blood cell deformability enhance blood hemoglobin level [ 8,9 ] . Although clinical benefit vitamin E increase hemoglobin level disease state publish , yet effect presumably healthy adult population abnormality mild anemia hardly report . Hypothesis : Vitamin E supplementation three month mildly anemic healthy adult ( past history iron supplement ) would result improved post-supplemental level blood hemoglobin compare basal level . Objective present study : To investigate association vitamin E supplementation mildly anemic healthy adult post-supplemental blood hemoglobin level general population Karachi , Pakistan . Study Participants In placebo-controlled single blind study , 357 healthy volunteer subject , 235 male 122 non-pregnant female age 18-45 year recruit enrolled general practitioner ' ( GP ) clinic various locality Karachi personnel Aga Khan University , Karachi . The recruitment start 2008 complete 2011 . The clinical examination study subject carry general physician . The participant nonsmoker ; history gastrointestinal disorder chronic disease iron deficiency last 6 month ; take vitamin E supplement receive blood transfusion past 6 month , dehydrate . They screen presence mild anemia ( 10.0-13.9 g/dL , males 8.4-11.2 g/dL , non-pregnant female use criterion follow Aga Khan University Hospital ( AKUH ) , Karachi . After screen , 124 subject ( 80 male 44 female ) find mildly anemic fulfilling criterion include intervention trial . Eighty two subject randomly place Intervention group 42 Control group . Supplementation Intervention group : Each subject provide 400 mg oral capsule vitamin E ( Evion , contain dl-alpha tocopheryl acetate ) ask take one capsule daily continuously three month . Control group : Each subject provide placebo ( edible oil ) capsule take daily three consecutive month . The placebo capsule identical vitamin E capsule size , shape , color , appearance taste . The compliance participant monitor count number capsule consume every 4 week . Blood Sampling Measurement Biomarkers Ten mL fast blood collect start supplementation participant another sample ( 10 mL ) obtain 3 month supplementation . Each blood sample divide two equal part ; one part blood transfer tube contain anticoagulant , part transfer plain tube obtain serum . Blood sample analyze blood hemoglobin level automate hematology analyzer . Serum/plasma sample kept frozen -70 degree Centigrade analysis biomarkers .</detailed_description>
