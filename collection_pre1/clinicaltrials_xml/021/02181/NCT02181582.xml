	<brief_summary>Background : - A brain protein call translocator protein ( TSPO ) show change brain disease . A radioactive drug call 11C- ( R ) -PK 11195 used take picture TSPO use camera call positron emission tomography ( PET ) . Researchers want find well 11C- ( R ) -PK 11195 take picture . Objective : - To evaluate radioactive chemical 11C- ( R ) -PK 11195 . Eligibility : - Healthy volunteer age 18-55 . Design : - Participants screen medical exam . - Participants scan 4 visit . - PET scan use 11C- ( R ) -PK 11195 : - A small tube ( catheter ) put artery wrist elbow , needle . The needle remove , leave catheter artery . Blood sample take catheter . - Another catheter place vein arm hand . - 11C- ( R ) -PK 11195 injected second catheter . - The PET scanner shape like doughnut . Participants lie bed slide . They may get plastic mask face head . - Participants receive dose emapunil mouth . Participants another PET scan . - Participants may magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) scan . The MRI scanner metal cylinder surround magnetic field . The participant lie table slide cylinder . Participants get earplugs loud knocking noise . - After scan , participant get follow-up phone call . Two seven day take emapunil , participant return follow-up visit .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Objective : The 18kDa Translocator Protein ( TSPO , formerly know peripheral benzodiazepine receptor ( PBR ) ) express activate microglia reactive astrocyte . It therefore use image target positron emission tomography ( PET ) investigate disease involve microglial activation and/or macrophage recruitment , multiple sclerosis , herpes encephalitis , Parkinson disease , Alzheimer disease ischemic stroke . The vast majority PET study report date use 11C- ( R , S ) 11C- ( R ) -PK 11195 , 3-isoquinolinecarboxamide antagonist , nanomolar affinity TSPO . Several second generation radioligands , include 11C-PBR28 , 11C-DPA-713 , 11C-ER176 developed . Although ligand great signal noise ( specific nondisplaceable uptake ) ratio 11C- ( R ) -PK 11195 , bind TSPO affect single nucleotide polymorphism ( SNP ) . Specific nondisplaceable ratio 11C-PBR28 recently report . However , one ever measure specific nondisplaceable ratio TSPO radioligands include 11C- ( R ) -PK 11195 , 11C-DPA-713 11C-ER176 human subject . In addition , difference bind site specie preclude comparison base study animal . The purpose study measure signal noise ratio ( i.e. , ratio specific non-displaceable uptake ) 11C- ( R ) -PK 11195 , 11C-ER176 11C-DPA-713 human subject two scan subject : baseline emapunil , agonist TSPO site putative anxiolytic base study animal human study effect SNP vivo specific bind PET ligand . Study population : 75 healthy volunteer total age 18 55 year . Of , 25 11C- ( R ) -PK 11195 , 25 11C-DPA-713 scan , 25 11C-ER176 . Design : Healthy volunteer ( n = 25 ) two scan session use 11C- ( R ) -PK 11195 : ) baseline i.e. , medication-free b ) block i.e . medication . For block , give one oral dose emapunil ( 15 90 mg ) , 1.5 hour second injection radioligand . Both scanning session would include arterial line measurement input function parent radioligand separate radiometabolites well plasma free fraction radioligand . Additional 25 healthy volunteer two scan session use 11C-DPA-713 design , one baseline another one oral dose emapunil . An additional 25 healthy volunteer two scan session use 11C-ER176 design , one baseline another one oral dose emapunil . The total number participant 75 ( = 25 + 25 + 25 ) Outcome measure : Baseline scan measure total binding i.e. , total distribution volume ( V [ T ] ) . By apply Lassen plot , combine data baseline scan administration emapunil measure nonspecific binding i.e. , nondisplaceable distribution volume ( V [ ND ] ) . From V [ T ] V [ ND ] value , specific-to-nondisplaceable ratio calculate ( V [ T ] V [ ND ] ) / V [ ND [ influence SNP specific binding , V [ S ] = V [ T ] - VND also study .</detailed_description>
