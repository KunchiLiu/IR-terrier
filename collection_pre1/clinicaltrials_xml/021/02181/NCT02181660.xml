	<brief_title>Dose Escalation Study Investigate Safety , Tolerability Pharmacokinetics ASP2215 Japanese Patients With Relapsed Refractory Acute Myeloid Leukemia</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This study conduct determine safety , tolerability , PK , PD , efficacy single repeat oral dose ASP2215 daily patient relapse refractory AML . After determination MTD and/or RD , expansion cohort might set investigate safety efficacy ASP2215 . This study consist single-dose period ( Cycle 0 , 2 day ) repeated-dose period ( Cycle 1 subsequent cycle , cycle consist 28 day ) . The enrolled subject orally receive assign single dose Cycle 0 ( Day −2 ) , follow 2-day observation period ( dose day inclusive ) . In Cycle 1 subsequent cycle ( one cycle define 28 day ) , subject receive oral ASP2215 daily repeatedly one discontinuation criterion meet . Another dose regimen may consider dose twice daily base safety PK data become available . In study , Bayesian-Continual Reassessment Method ( hereinafter , Bayesian-CRM ) use reference dose-escalation procedure , base onset DLTs , RD level subsequent cohort set high low . DLTs assess Cycle 0 Cycle 1 ( 30 day ) . ASP2215 may escalate one dose level subject meet criteria end cycle Cycle 1 investigator/sub-investigator judge escalation ASP2215 clinical benefit . Dose reduction ASP2215 consider study drug-related toxicity observe subject .</detailed_description>
