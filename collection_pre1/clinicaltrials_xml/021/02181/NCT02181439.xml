	<brief_summary>It single-center , prospective clinical study medical device , control , randomize , non-stratified , double-blind ( neither patient parent know area irradiate / practitioner performs measure evaluate class I achievement non also ignore irradiated area ) . Children include clinical trial control , area receive LASER irradiation receive simulation LASER irradiation ( placebo side , inactive laser ) . In maxilla , segment use technique introduction sectional side ( portion elgiloy arch support molar , canine premolar ) serve support Intermaxillary Strength II ( Intermaxillary Elastics II ) . The patient put Intermaxillary Elastics II , force adapt amount class II dental , 24h/24 . The patient position him/herself intermaxillary elastic first mandibular molar maxillary canine ; action , case maximum mandibular anchorage , reduce maxillary canine order obtain report class I . In mandible , maximum anchor realize . Maximum molar anchor place root mandibular molar vestibular cortex order anchor . This allow low canine , premolar maxillary molar action FIM without cause mutual advancement mandibular arch . This procedure differ usual treatment . The application laser diode appear , biomodulatrice action , show promising result accelerate kinetics tooth movement orthodontic treatment . The main hypothesis research increase rate correction Class II irradiate side , i.e . 1-month short delay obtain class I irradiate area vs. non irradiate one . The main objective study evaluate effect application low energy laser ( LLLT ) time require obtain Class I canine patient undergo FIM II ( Class II elastic )</brief_summary>
