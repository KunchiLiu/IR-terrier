	<brief_summary>There concern literature regard egg consumption diabetic people . The investigator hypothesis compare oatmeal-based breakfast , egg-based breakfast increase risk heart disease diabetic people may reduce inflammation , population characterize chronic low grade inflammation . This cross-over study subject randomly allocate consume 1 egg per day breakfast bowl oatmeal lactose-free milk 5 week . After 3 wk washout period , subject allocate alternate treatment additional 5 week . Blood collect baseline end dietary period measure plasma lipid , glucose , insulin , glycosylated hemoglobin inflammatory marker .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>This study conduct diabetic patient give two distinct breakfast : egg oatmeal crossover design . The investigator hypothesis eggs increase risk heart disease population compare oatmeal likely reduce inflammation due presence carotenoid , lutein zeaxanthin highly available egg . In study , investigator evaluate three main thing - Atherogenic dyslipidemia measure plasma lipid lipoprotein mean size subfractions nuclear magnetic resonance . - Glucose metabolism measure plasma glucose , insulin , insulin resistance glycosylated hemoglobin . - Inflammation measure liver enzyme , C reactive protein , tumor necrosis factor-alpha , interleukin-6 . All measurement do 24 week completion study All data present 1 year completion study</detailed_description>
