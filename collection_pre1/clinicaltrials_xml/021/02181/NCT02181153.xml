	<brief_summary>Although precise etiology inflammatory bowel disease ( IBD ) still unknown , last decade active research allow gain precise insight pathophysiology IBD indicate chronic inflammation intestinal mucosa direct microbiota gut particularly susceptible individual . Genetic study recently genome-wide association study ( GWAS ) allow identify 70 susceptibility gene confer increase risk develop IBD . In last year attention researcher shift identification early immunological change occur already preclinical stage disease , try also identify disease show . Recently , ability combination serological marker predict development IBD demonstrate adult . However , study evaluate cohort child high risk disease , first immunological change underlie development IBD could study , include combination genetic , serological , fecal clinical marker . The purpose study evaluate population genetically well-characterized , sibling twin patient affected IBD , early genetic , serologic , fecal clinical marker disease , may present even year develop disease . The identification marker predispose individual could help implement strategy prevention early treatment modify natural history IBD .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>This multicenter , prospective , study evaluate role serological , genetic , fecal clinical marker predict development IBD high risk population . The study divide two phase . In first phase prevalence genetic , serologic , fecal , clinical risk factor 100 sibling child affect IBD compare 100 healthy child family history IBD evaluate . The estimated duration first phase study 12 month . In second phase , long-term follow-up ( 5 year ) perform order evaluate accidental case IBD population .</detailed_description>
