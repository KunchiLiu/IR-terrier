	<brief_summary>The purpose research study find maximum tolerated dose drug call romidepsin give treatment regimen call GemOxD . GemOxD routine treatment certain type lymphoma , involve administration three drug : gemcitabine , oxaliplatin , dexamethasone . In addition find maximum tolerate dose romidepsin , investigator want look side effect drug give together , well lymphoma responds treatment .</brief_summary>
