	<brief_summary>The purpose study find effect , good and/or bad , radiation lung patient synovial sarcoma spread lung . The standard treatment synovial sarcoma spread lung chemotherapy without surgery remove tumor lung . However , tumor often come back lung chemotherapy and/or surgery . Since synovial sarcoma know sensitive radiation , study look whether radiation therapy target entire lung reduce chance cancer return . This type radiation commonly use type sarcoma treat cancer spread lung may useful synovial sarcoma well . In study , special type radiation use , call Intensity Modulated Radiation Therapy ( IMRT ) . With IMRT radiation beam customize focus radiation tumor cell deliver less radiation area like heart . The goal study also measure pulmonary toxicity see IMRT feasible less toxicity .</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Patients synovial sarcoma confirm MSKCC pathological review Patients single multiple lung metastasis diagnosis develop course treatment . After completion chemotherapy , lung metastasis must ≤ 2cm . Age ≥12 month age Karnofsky performance status ( KPS ) must ≥ 70 patient ≥ 16 year age Lansky performance status must ≥ 70 patient &lt; 16 year age . Normal cardiac function No active coronary artery disease ; No New York Heart Association class II , III IV disease ; No arrhythmia require treatment . Baseline echocardiogram shorten fraction ≥27 % ejection fraction ≥ 50 % . Female patient childbearing potential must negative pregnancy test within 14 day radiation start . Female patient lactate must agree stop breastfeeding . Sexually active patient childbearing potential must agree use effective contraception . Patients history prior radiation therapy thorax . Patients require field size &gt; 40 cm IMRT perform extended SSDs . Patients concurrent medical psychiatric condition disease , investigator 's judgment , would make inappropriate candidate entry study .</criteria>
