	<brief_summary>The purpose study determine Extracorporeal Photopheresis ( ECP ) effective treatment progressive Bronchiolitis Obliterans Syndrome ( BOS ) patient lung transplantation . Lung transplantation become treatment choice select patient end-stage lung disease . However , long-term survival transplantation remain disappointing . Chronic rejection ( bronchiolitis obliterans syndrome [ BOS ] ) emerge lead obstacle well long-term outcome , represent lead cause death beyond first year transplantation . BOS diagnose decline FEV1 measurement pulmonary function test . The management BOS disappointing . In general , BOS treat intensify immunosuppressive regimen . Despite treatment , patient continue show progressive decline lung function result worsen functional status , quality life , ultimately graft failure death . Extracorporeal Photopheresis ( ECP ) use salvage treatment progressive BOS favorable clinical result many case show patient improvement . On May 2 , 2012 , Center Medicare Services issue decision memo statin ECP cover Medicare beneficiary treatment BOS follow lung allograft transplantation wehn procedure provide clinical research study . It highly unlikely provider currently order ECP BOS patient already fail optimized immunosuppressive drug therapy would willing randomize half patient continue fail drug therapy.What well understood time , however , whether certain coexist disease state patient-related demographic , functional , treatment-related diagnostic variable might prove predictive value identify subset BOS patient likely , unlikely , experience reduce rate decline stabilization FEV1 follow ECP treatment . This Registry study enroll 160 patient multiple U.S. center ( 1 ) confirm ECP significantly reduce rate FEV1 decline BOS patient refractory standard immunosuppressive drug therapy , ( 2 ) capture ass specify patient demographic , treatment-related , diagnostic , functional co-morbidity- related variable may predict outcome ECP therapy .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>There evidence support ECP benefit patient , n't know predict patient benefit . Patients identified physician investigator co-investigators , study staff , review relevant administrative database maintain routine clinical care purpose ( e.g . lung transplantation division database , pulmonary function laboratory database , etc . ) , subject local IRB approval . Once eligibility confirm patient provide informed consent , patient assign unique case number create electronic data base . The patient demographic , co-morbidities , medical history include date lung transplantation , underlie disease necessitate lung transplantation , vital sign , height , weight , current medication regimen , maintenance immunosuppression change medication enter electronic case report form . All FEV1 measurement capture within 6 month prior enrollment enter electronic case report forms.Certain source document require verified form electronically submit . Necessary source document clearly request electronic case report form . Patients receive 24 ECP treatment 6-month period follow enrollment , accordance follow schedule : - 8 10 treatment first 30 day follow treatment initiation ; - 8 10 treatment next 60 day ( month 2 3 ) ; - 6 treatment next 90 day ( month 4 6 ) rate 2 treatment per month . During ECP , blood take body standard venous catheter cell separate centrifugation via specialized pheresis machine . The machine treat blood agent call methoxsalen becomes active exposed ultraviolet light inside machine . This change white blood cell well enable reduce rejection well suppress BOS . The machine return blood patient catheter . . An improvement FEV1 measurement take pulmonary function test use ass success benefit ECP treatment . Patient 's spirometry first week therapy , Day 30 , 60 , 90 , 120 , 150 , 180 , 240 , 300 , one year . Statistical Methods -Based 95 % power analysis assume 5 % loss follow-up enrol patient , 160 patient need enrol detect least 50 % reduction rate FEV1 decline one-year follow-up . A 50 % decrease rate FEV1 decline importantly extend survival improve opportunity receive new lung allograft , well delay time onset severe physical limitation . Our power analysis base finding previously publish 60 patient series . Specifically , first calculate value reflect difference pre-intervention post-intervention FEV1 slope value . The corresponding value standard deviation slope difference adjust possible great variability post-treatment period study . These value derive slope difference ( 50 % 87 ml/month ) correspond standard deviation value ( 150 ) use calculate require enrollment use treatment effect 50 % reduction FEV1 decline use power 95 % . This analysis , 5 % late loss , indicate require enrollment 160 patient .</detailed_description>

Progressive BOS ( define ongoing decline FEV1 despite least one follow treatment ; azithromycin , highdose steroid , antithymocyte globulin , total lymphoid irradiation , sirolimus , everolimus ) . At minimum four FEV1 measurement obtain interval one six week apart , 6 month precede initial ECP treatment ( may include FEV1 measurement prior first ECP procedure date ) . Participation another clinical treatment trial investigational agent . Any condition may interfere subject 's ability perform pulmonary function test . Known allergy hypersensitivity pharmacologic agent use ECP . Any condition would significantly affect participant 's ability adhere protocol , affect interpretation study result , put participant unacceptable risk studyrelated complication judge refer clinician . This may include patient specific acute contraindication receive ECP due acute condition new evolve myocardial infarction central nervous system disorder , hemodynamic instability hypovolemia , acute bleeding , respiratory distress . Inability provide inform consent comply study treatment assessment ( e.g . due cognitive impairment geographic distance ) .</criteria>
