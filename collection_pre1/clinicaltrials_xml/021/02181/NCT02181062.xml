	<brief_summary>Stroke cruel disease disproportionately kill disables African-Americans , Latinos , Chinese-Americans Korean-Americans ; senior high blood pressure particularly high risk . There high incidence hemorrhagic stroke African Americans , Latinos , Chinese Americans relative non-Latino white . Asian-Americans 1.4 high relative risk stroke death compare U.S. non-Latino white . A critical need therefore exist sustainable scalable mechanism disseminate culturally-tailored stroke knowledge/prevention education community-based setting large number high-risk ethnic minority old adult group regularly serve , federally fund Multipurpose Senior Centers ( MPCs ) exist across nation ( 16 Los Angeles alone ) . The overall objective propose study develop test implementation train program case manager senior center implement stoke knowledge/prevention education program among four high-risk ethnic minority old adult group -- Korean-American , Chinese-American , African-American , Latinos . We propose develop culturally-tailored case manager training curriculum , implement train 4 community-based site , evaluate train model use randomize wait-list control trial ( n=244 ) test hypothesis training case manager decrease old adult participant ' stroke risk sustainable fashion increase preventative behavior ( i.e . increase physical activity -- mean steps/day -- 1 3 month ) . Findings inform similar community-academic partnership effort around stroke disease-specific prevention research/interventions ; also determine next step term whether case manager-centric model scale deployed community-based setting .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Culturally Tailoring Stroke Intervention Community Senior Centers</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>As many 30 % ischemic stroke U.S. population attribute physical inactivity . With goal eliminate racial/ethnic stroke disparity , interdisciplinary team propose develop , implement , test culturally-tailored behavioral intervention reduce stroke risk ( primary prevention ) increase physical activity ( walk ) 4 different racial/ethnic group ( Korean-Americans , Chinese-Americans , African-Americans Latinos ) Los Angeles community senior center . The intervention combine stroke stroke risk factor knowledge ( use material develop American Heart Association American Stroke Association ) theoretically-grounded behavioral change technique focus reduce stroke risk increase physical activity ( walk ) . The study team conduct focus group ( n=144 ) identify culture-specific belief stroke stroke risk factor , assess feasibility acceptability intervention , work Community Action Panels culturally-tailor intervention . The intervention consist 4 week twice-weekly 1-hour group session implement 4 community senior center train case manager part regular senior center staff support congressionally-mandated Older Americans Act Title III funding . The project team test effectiveness intervention randomize wait-list control trial ( n=240 ) test hypothesis intervention increase mean steps/day ( measure pedometer ) 1 3 month , increase mediate change stroke/stroke risk knowledge self-efficacy . Blood pressure examine secondary outcome . In collaboration SPIRP Biomarker Collection &amp; Analysis Core , team collect biological specimen ( finger prick ) explore relationship intervention biological marker health ; also explore relationship intervention healthcare seek take medication control stroke risk factor . The team evaluate barrier facilitator successfully integrate intervention senior center order inform large-scale implementation culturally-tailored stroke risk factor reduction/walking intervention .</detailed_description>
