	<brief_summary>There recent interest role 5-HT1B receptor possible modulating factor cocaine dependence , certainly preclinical model . The Yale Positron Emission Tomography ( PET ) Center develop novel 5-HT1B receptor antagonist radioligand , [ 11C ] -P943 , validate human study . We hypothesize 5-HT1B receptor play key role cocaine dependence . The long term goal project would study pharmacological manipulation 5-HT1B receptor potential molecular target cocaine dependence .</brief_summary>
