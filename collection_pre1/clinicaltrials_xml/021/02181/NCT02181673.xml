	<brief_title>A Study Golimumab Participants With Active Psoriatic Arthritis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This Phase 3 , multicenter ( one hospital medical school team work medical research study ) , randomize ( study drug assign chance ) , double-blind ( neither researcher participant know treatment participant receiving ) , placebo-controlled ( inactive substance ; pretend treatment [ drug ] compare clinical trial drug test drug real effect ) study golimumab compare placebo participant active psoriatic arthritis . The study include 4 phase : Screening phase ( 6 week ) , Double-blind placebo-controlled phase ( Week 0 Week 24 ) , Active treatment phase ( Week 24 Week 52 ) , Safety follow-up phase ( 8 week last study drug administration ) . Total duration study 60 week per participant . Eligible Participants randomly assign either Treatment Group 1 : Placebo Treatment Group 2 : Golimumab . Participants randomize Placebo Group , receive intravenous infusion placebo Weeks 0 , 4 , 12 20 . At Week 24 , participant receive placebo begin receive intravenous infusion golimumab ( 2 mg/kg ) Week 24 , 28 thereafter every 8 week Week 52 . Participants randomize Golimumab Group , receive intravenous infusion golimumab 2 mg/kg Week 0 , 4 thereafter every 8 week Week 52 . At Week 24 , participant randomize golimumab Group receive placebo infusion maintain blind . The efficacy assess primarily measure percentage participant achieve 20 percent improvement baseline assessment use active psoriatic arthritis Week 14 .
