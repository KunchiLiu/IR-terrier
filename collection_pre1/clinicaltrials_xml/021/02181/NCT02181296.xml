	<detailed_description>Abstract Brief abstract ( 250 word less ) describe study language understandable lay person . Include brief description purpose , target disease/condition applicable , key eligibility criterion , main study intervention . The interscalene brachial plexus block well-suited surgical procedure shoulder proximal humerus . A well-established hazard interscalene block ipsilateral hemidiaphragm paresis nearly 100 % patient secondary phrenic nerve blockade . This side effect well-tolerated patient ; however , extreme caution employ patient pulmonary disease , may experience acute pulmonary failure unilateral phrenic nerve blockade result hemidiaphragm paresis . This study seek determine use low concentration ropivacaine result less diaphragm dysfunction reduction pulmonary function high concentration local anesthetic . Patients randomize one two group -- Group A Group B . Group A receive ultrasound-guided interscalene block 20mL 0.1 % ropivacaine preoperative hold area prior induction general anesthesia . Group B receive ultrasound-guided interscalene block 20mL 0.2 % ropivacaine preoperative hold area prior induction general anesthesia . The primary outcome variable degree phrenic nerve blockade assess ultrasonographic evaluation diaphragm function bedside spirometry ( lung function test ) . Secondary outcome variable assess various time interval . They include oxygen saturation measurement , oxygen requirement , motor strength sensation block extremity , pain score , opioid requirement , PACU length stay , patient satisfaction quality recovery score . We hypothesize interscalene brachial plexus block perform low concentration ropivacaine result le pulmonary dysfunction without compromise analgesia . Objectives Overall objective 1 . Primary Objective : Compare degree phrenic nerve blockade ultrasound-guided interscalene block use either 0.1 % ropivacaine 0.2 % ropivacaine 2 . Hypothesis : Using low concentration local anesthetic result lesser degree phrenic nerve blockade . Specifically , hypothesize outcome measure follow patient receive low concentration ropivacaine : 1 . Less dysfunction diaphragm movement , 2 . PFT value drop less low concentration group , 3 . Less oxygen desaturation PACU , 4 . Less symptomatic shortness breath post-block , 5 . Less need supplemental oxygen PACU , 6 . Less unplanned hospital admission 3 . Secondary Objective : Compare analgesia efficacy well block duration 0.1 % 0.2 % ropivacaine . Assess quality recovery well overall satisfaction patient undergo arthroscopic shoulder surgery combine regional/ general anesthesia . Also compare evaluate presence complication arise two group Primary outcome variable ( ) The primary outcome variable degree phrenic nerve blockade assess ultrasonographic evaluation diaphragm function bedside spirometry . Secondary outcome variable ( ) Secondary outcome variable include oxygen saturation measurement oxygen requirement block performance , 20 minute block performance , PACU ; motor strength sensation affect extremity block performance , 20 minute block performance , PACU ; pain score opioid requirement PACU 72 hour post-operatively , PACU length stay , patient satisfaction quality recovery score 24 hour post-operatively . Background Describe succinctly clearly past finding justify plan project . A summary relevant literature area interest report previous study include . The brachial plexus , form anterior root spinal nerve C5- T1 innervate shoulder , axilla , upper extremity . The roots exit posterior vertebral artery travel laterally troughs correspond cervical transverse process finally join form trunk posterior cervical triangle anterior middle scalene muscle . C5 C6 join form superior trunk . C7 form middle trunk , C8 T1 join form inferior trunk . The trunk pass first rib clavicle association subclavian artery branch anterior posterior division . The posterior division join form posterior cord . The lateral cord form anterior division superior middle trunk . The medial cord form anterior division inferior trunk . The cord descend axilla one major branch addition several minor branch become terminal nerve upper extremity . Branches lateral medial cord form median nerve . A branch lateral cord become musculocutaneous nerve . The posterior cord become radial nerve axillary nerve . The medial cord form ulnar nerve well medial brachial medial antebrachial cutaneous nerve ( 1,2 ) . Each peripheral nerve predictable cutaneous innervation pattern map along upper extremity ; furthermore knowledge peripheral nerve dermatomal innervation help guide decision regional anesthetic approach employ give surgical intervention . The brachial plexus provide motor sensory innervation shoulder except cephalad cutaneous portion shoulder receive sensory innervation supraclavicular nerve superficial cervical plexus , nerve root C3-C4 . It therefore easy understand complete surgical anesthesia shoulder must employ regional technique block cervical brachial plexus . The brachial plexus block along multiple anatomic level depend area upper extremity proceduralist wish anesthetize . The preferred approach depend surgical site risk complication . The interscalene brachial plexus block well-suited surgical procedure shoulder proximal humerus block cervical plexus ( form ventral ramus C1 C4 spinal nerve root ) addition brachial plexus , effectively anesthetize skin shoulder . It less suited surgery forearm hand incomplete blockade inferior trunk result incomplete analgesia ulnar nerve distribution . A well-established hazard interscalene block ipsilateral hemidiaphragm paresis nearly 100 % patient secondary phrenic nerve blockade spread local anesthetic around anterior scalene muscle . This side effect well-tolerated majority patient ; however extreme caution employ patient COPD pulmonary disease , may experience acute pulmonary failure unilateral phrenic nerve blockade result hemidiaphragm paresis . Because interscalene nerve block provide excellent post-operative pain control shoulder surgery may preclude use general endotracheal anesthesia inherent risk patient severe pulmonary disease , would helpful establish variable regional technique affect phrenic nerve blockade . There publication analyze degree phrenic nerve blockade diaphragmatic function interscalene brachial plexus block . A detailed review study show reduction volume concentration local anesthetic associate decreased reduction pulmonary function test diaphragmatic dysfunction ( 3,4 ) . There ; however , still essential question remain unclear improvement study design make . Specifically , study do Al-Kaisy et al . 1999 show low concentration bupivacaine associate less reduction pulmonary function less diaphragmatic dysfunction look 11 healthy volunteer . These volunteer surgery receive block therefore representative true clinical situation . In addition , sample size 11 small draw conclusion . Furthermore , study use nerve stimulator-based approach interscalene brachial plexus blockade therefore deposition local anesthetic visualized . Without direct visualization local anesthetic deposition , impossible say block study consistently perform . This lack consistency block could contribute variance outcome . An ultrasound-guided block approach effective maintaining consistency block performance may decrease variance outcome . Also Al-Kaisy et al . use bupivacaine study use ropivacaine ( 3 ) . All subject enrol research study consider receive suboptimal treatment . The standard care shoulder surgery general anesthesia plus regional anesthesia regional anesthesia contraindicate . Regional anesthetic perform different local anesthetic different concentration . In fact , study show low concentration ropivacaine achieve analgesic effect less diaphragmatic dysfunction , many patient previously deem candidate interscalene blockade due pulmonary disease , may receive block receive superior post-operative pain control would without block . Study Design Phase* Not applicable Design This study prospective , randomize , double blind study 40 patient . Patients randomize one two group -- Group A Group B . Group A receive interscalene block 20mL 0.1 % ropivacaine preoperative hold area prior induction general anesthesia Group B receive interscalene block 20mL 0.2 % ropivacaine preoperative hold area prior induction general anesthesia . Interscalene block perform ultrasound guidance attend anesthesiologist experience regional anesthesia resident physician direct supervision attend anesthesiologist experience regional anesthesia . They perform accordance standard procedure Penn Presbyterian Medical Center ambulatory surgery center . The syrinx concentration ropivacaine supply research investigational pharmacy . Study duration We plan begin enrollment March 2014 . The enrollment subject project complete December 2014 data analysis follow . The study expect complete June 2015 . The length participation subject 72 hour post-operative period .</detailed_description>
