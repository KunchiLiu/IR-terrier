	<brief_summary>The purpose study determine effect ixazomib citrate maintenance therapy progression-free survival ( PFS ) , compare placebo , participant newly diagnose multiple myeloma ( NDMM ) response ( complete response [ CR ] , good partial response [ VGPR ] , partial response [ PR ] ) induction therapy follow high-dose therapy ( HDT ) autologous stem cell transplant ( ASCT ) .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Study Oral Ixazomib Citrate ( MLN9708 ) Maintenance Therapy Participants With Multiple Myeloma Following Autologous Stem Cell Transplant</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The investigational drug test study call ixazomib citrate . Ixazomib citrate test slow disease progression improve overall survival people NDMM type positive response induction therapy follow HDT ASCT . This study look effect ixazomib citrate length time participant free disease progression overall survival . The study enroll approximately 652 participant . Participants randomly assign ( chance , like flip coin ) one two treatment groups—which remain undisclosed patient study doctor study ( unless urgent medical need ) : - Ixazomib citrate 3 mg - Placebo ( dummy inactive pill ) - capsule look like study drug active ingredient All participants ask take one capsule Days 1 , 8 15 28-day cycle , 26 cycle ( approximately 24 month ) . This multi-center trial conduct globally . The overall time participate study 107 month . Participants make 28 visit clinic treatment period continue make visit 4 follow-up period ( PFS , PD , PFS2 , OS ) . Participants assess disease response PD PFS Follow-up period undergo follow every 4 week next line therapy begin . Participants start next line therapy enter PFS2 Follow-up period . During PFS2 Follow-up period , follow-up occur every 12 week PD2 occurs . After participant PFS2 Follow-up period PD2 next-line therapy , enter OS Follow-up period . During OS Follow-up period , follow-up occur every 12 week death termination study .</detailed_description>
