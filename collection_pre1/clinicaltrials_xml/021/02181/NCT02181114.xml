	<brief_summary>Because decease donor organ shortage , kidney patient consider whether receive kidney family friend , process call live donor kidney transplantation ( LDKT ) . Although Blacks 3.4 time likely develop end stage renal disease , less likely receive LDKTs . To address disparity , randomize control trial ass whether Black White transplant patient ' knowledge receipt LDKTs increase receive access Your Path Transplant computerize Expert System ( YPT ) . This trial also examine know patient , family , healthcare system barrier LDKT impact YPT 's effectiveness . Nine hundred ( 900 ) Black , White Hispanic ESRD patient present transplant medical evaluation University California-Los Angeles Kidney Pancreas Transplant Program ( UCLA-KPTP ) Los Angeles , California stratify race randomly assign one two education condition ( YPT vs. Usual Care Education ) . As undergo transplant evaluation , patient YPT condition receive individually-tailored feedback report , coach , socioeconomic resource guidance associate reduce barrier access LDKT . Control patient receive usual care transplant education provide UCLA-KPTP . Changes knowledge , readiness pursue LDKT , pros/cons LDKT , self-efficacy assess four time point : prior present transplant center ( baseline ) , transplant evaluation ( approximately 2 month post-baseline ) , 4- 8-months post-baseline . Completion transplant evaluation receipt LDKTs assess 18-months post-baseline . At conclusion study , develop innovative cost-effective YPT Computerized Expert System could utilize tailor LDKT discussion education different medical setting base need individual patient different race .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Your Path Transplant : A Randomized Control Trial A Tailored Computer Education Intervention Living Donor Kidney Transplant</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This longitudinal , parallel randomize control trial two treatment condition equal allocation , YPT intervention standard care transplant education provide UCLAKPT . Patients group assess four time point : 1 ) phone survey baseline ; 2 ) phone survey 4 month post-baseline ; 3 ) phone survey 8 month post-baseline ; 4 ) medical record review 4 , 8 18 month post-baseline . Additionally , patient YPT intervention group receive individualize YPT transplant education various time point : 14 day post-baseline phone , in-person transplant education ( ITE ) session , 4 month post-baseline survey , 8 month post-baseline survey . The date ITE education session fix may occur different point patient 's transplant evaluation process . As patient record receive via transplant database , data manager determine eligible study , assign eligible patient PIN pre-randomized treatment group upload record recruitment database . Randomization complete use computer software program call TTMX ( Transtheoretical Model Expert ) . Knowledge treatment assignment require stage YPT expert system deliver patient randomize intervention condition . Patients randomize one two group : usual care intervention group . Usual Care Control Group-UCLA The control group trial consist usual care transplant education , facility , begin referral make . A physician , patient medical group dialysis center make referral . Once UCLAKPTP receive patient 's information via patient information form insurance verify , patient call schedule Education Seminar one-on-one evaluation appointment . Next , UCLAKPTP mail `` Appointment Letter '' patient complete bring Evaluation Day . These packet include UCLAKPTP Appointment Letter Doctor 's Information Worksheet . Patients ask fill bring Information Worksheet appointment day . The evaluation day full day group education , physician appointment , meeting several coordinator care necessary complete several medical test blood urine collection . During two hour group education power point presentation give review different transplantation option include live deceased donor well high risk donor . The social worker conclude education review important insurance information group . Next , patient series individual appointment transplant physician ( either nephrologist surgeon ) , social worker transplant coordinator ask question receive additional information transplant . Psychosocial evaluation complete social worker identify risk factor red flag would contradict transplant treatment . This routine standard patient evaluate transplant . Patients group survey baseline , 4 month 8 month post baseline . These survey conduct phone last 50 minute . YPT Intervention Group Patients intervention group receive individualize YPT transplant education four time point . Their total participation estimate 2.5 hour . Printed material video sent patient time point . Patients also receive individualized feedback report base stage readiness pursue DDKT LDKT . In addition tailor individual 's stage readiness , report address concern patient mention well answer knowledge question patient may miss . YPT intervention : baseline time point . We first administer verbal consent form ass ineligibility criterion . After consent give eligibility determine , conduct baseline assessment patient 's demographic , knowledge , decision making , readiness , self-efficacy DDKT LDKT . Family support live donor availability also assess LDKT . This time point estimate last 40 minute . At end survey patient ask schedule time conduct first education session.The education session occur time 14 day baseline assessment last 20-30 minute . The coach discus patient 's readiness pursue DDKT . This guide patient 's stage change . Next , coach address benefit DDKT provide coaching concern patient mention assessment . After , coach discus patient 's confidence pursuing DDKT provide itemized feedback problem patient believe prevent pursue DDKT . The coach provide education coaching LDKT . At end education session coach inform patient meet patient day ITE . The coach mail folder contain first set educational material include factsheets , brochures patient 's personalize , tailor feedback report . YPT intervention : ITE time point . The ITE session occur UCLAKPTP patient 's medical evaluation visit . It expect last 40 minute . Patients take semi-private area transplant center either facility re-assess patient 's readiness pursue DDKT LDKT well perceive benefit concern . The patient 's confidence pursuing DDKT LDKT also re-assessed . We provide feedback patient base change readiness , confidence , perceive benefit concern may occur since initial assessment . DDKT feedback occur directly DDKT re-assessment LDKT feedback occur LDKT re-assessment . The patient ask watch 10 minute video print patient 's personalized feedback report . Based patient 's stage change , one two video show : `` Pursuing Donation '' patient pre-contemplation contemplation phase `` Exploring Donation '' patient stage . At end session give patient second folder educational material , DVD , personalize feedback report . YPT intervention : 4 month 8 month time point . We contact patient four month eight month baseline survey . Pre-survey reminder postcard send one month prior survey . It estimate survey last 45 minute . These interview similar baseline survey give begin trial . However , re-assess demographic information , comorbidities , unmet need . At time point , provide tailor feedback throughout interview . This occur immediately re-assessment potential barrier pursue transplant , knowledge , transplant decision make DDKT LDKT . During eight month interview , ask patient question regard cultural competency medical provider , decision treatment pursue , ability make informed decision whether pursue DDKT LDKT . As previous time point , individualized feedback report tailor education send patient follow phone call . YPT patient : 4 , 8 , 18 month medical record review . Patients ' medical record review 4 , 8 18 month baseline survey order determine whether : 1 ) waitlisted transplant ; 2 ) receive DDKT ; 3 ) receive LDKT ; 4 ) go inactive determine ineligible transplant ; 5 ) die .</detailed_description>
