	<brief_summary>The posincisional hernia consider delicate complication , incidence 10-12 % patient undergoing laparotomy may reach 45 % case emergency high-risk patient . It estimate United States make million reoperations correction complication , million despite myriad study do recent year decrease incidence loss mortality complication . Given seriousness problem last global consensus guideline send surgical community three main area : Identify importance problem , improve theoretical knowledge technical capacity closure abdominal wall Implement prophylaxis select patient . The technique reinforce tension line ( RTL ) propose hollinsky collaborator strengthen abdominal incision placement suture run lateral edge incision closure abdominal wall perform usual manner surgete continuous suture closure place lateral suture reinforcement . In present study may contribute guideline group patient high risk identify apply RTL technique demonstrate use safe useful reduce presence complication could implement prophylaxis handling . The RTL method apply experimentally body close abdominal wall also use cohort patient hernia repair wall , show use abdominal wall resistant shear force theoretical foundation exist show could prevent development incisional hernia . There study literature compare technique conventional method closure abdominal wall prevention .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The patient time schedule surgery either electively urgently plan preoperatively make approach midline invite participate study , family patient report detail thereof shall obtain informed consent participate . The patient include experimental group ( RTL ) ( conventional ) control accord list random number . Estimated Enrollment : 76 Study Start Date July 2014 Estimated study completion date : May 2015 Estimated Primary Completion Date : January 2015 . Arms . Assigned intervention . Experimental : Procedure/ Surgery . Method RTL . The method consist two line suture , , fascial wound edge . It start suture strand ( study use PDS number 0 ) one end fascial wound suture run longitudinally parallel aponeurotic edge . The needle go interval 1 cm away always keep 0.5 cm edge fascia . Upon reach opposite angle wound suture strand another repeat process fascial edge otherwise use . The end two suture strand tie fascial angle . Thus fascial wound suture two line strengthen edge . Then proceed close wound continuous súrgete always ensure suture line remain anchored suture reinforcement . Other Conventional midline mass closure technique . Upon completion surgical procedure closure abdominal wall make number 0 monofilament PDS , start knot one end wound , continuous continuous súrgete , move point centimeter away . Each point distance one centimeter edge fascia . At opposite end wound procedure initiate find two suture line midpoint wind proceed tie two suture 4 square knot . Participants surgeon evaluate patient postoperative monitoring prior hospital discharge , search data hernia . After hospital discharge , participant surgeon evaluate patient first external consultation attend surgeon look data incisional hernia . Follow-up time 6 month hold outpatient 6 month CT make identify presence incisional hernia variable Main outcome : presence incisional hernia ( dichotomous categorical ) Secondary outcome : presence complication surgical wound ; infection , hematoma , ecchymosis , seroma ( categorical nominal ) Main predictor : technique closure abdominal wall ( dichotomous categorical ) Conformation : gender ( dichotomous ) , age ( categorical nominal ) , comorbidities ( categorical nominal ) , emergency surgery ( dichotomous ) , cough ( dichotomous ) , type surgery ( categorical nominal ) . The presence incisional hernia define loss continuity abdominal wall surgical closure , formation peritoneal sac protrusion different structure cavity . Is clinically define presence lump region surgical wound secondary physical effort well palpation defect continuity wound abdominal wall . The gold standard diagnosis compute tomography area disruption evaluate well size organ involve , define tomographic sign separation distance upright great 25 mm . The present Study make perform Hospital Regional de Alta Especialidad del Bajio . Population . Patients 18 year age undergoing diagnostic laparotomy regardless whether background urgent schedule high risk develop incisional hernia . Universe : Laparotomy patient schedule either elective emergency risk factor develop incisional hernia . Calculation sample : The sample size calculate base study Van Ramshorts , find 40 % incisional hernia patient high risk score high 6 predictor scale , 12 % submission high-risk patient , earn total 76 patient , divide 2 group 38 patient technique , consider able detect difference least 28 % proportion patient without hernia , 80 % power alpha 0.5 % two tail .</detailed_description>
