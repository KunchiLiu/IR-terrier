However , insufficient knowledge child . All child adolescent , start treatment ADHD medication public Child Adolescent Psychiatry unit Stockholm Gotland , ask participate study . The investigator intend monitor patients´clinical symptom possible side-effects treatment start . The investigator collect background information saliva sample patient his/her parent able study genetic ( hereditary ) marker predict positive negative outcome ADHD medication .

	<detailed_description>The specific aim ADAPT study : 1 . Investigate certain gene polymorphism associate poor effect ADHD drug ( non-responders ) . 2 . Investigate biologically , phenotypic psychosocial factor associate poor effect ADHD drug ( non-responders ) . 3 . Investigate frequency side-effects ADHD drug differs child different genotype . 4 . Investigate frequency side-effects ADHD drug differs child different phenotypic and/or psychosocial factor Method : This study naturalistic design . The aim map new treatment ADHD drug 13 public BUP unit Stockholm County one BUP unit Gotland . The participation mean medication initiate plan normal clinical practice child´s ordinary physician , beyond mean somewhat denser structured follow-up . In addition , investigator ask saliva sample patient his/her parent . The investigator aim include least 1000 individual total study . Part data collect via national Quality Register ADHD Treatment Follow-up ( BUSA ) , approve security procedure approve Swedish Data Inspection Board . Case report form computerize separate database registry collect study data . The database detail variable list construct collaboration professional database manager . Standard Operation Procedures design collaboration project coordinator , study nurse principal investigator , may revise pilot phase . Collected sample store KI biobank . Data analysis : 1 . To judge patient responder ADHD drug SNAP-IV rating ADHD symptom ( medication start ) use . The patient 3 month least 40 % reduction SNAP-IV score reckon `` responder '' time point le 20 % change SNAP-IV score reckon `` non-responders '' . Differences group analyze logistic regression , responder status depend variable , genotype risk marker ( biological , phenotypic , psychosocial marker ) independent variable correction symptom baseline . Even 50 % drop-out rate ( i.e . 1000 estimated 2000 eligible individual ) give 98 % power identify 49 % increase non-responder proportion specific genotype . 2 . Concomitantly , outcome side-effects , heart rate , blood pressure , weight ( z-score ) length ( z-score ) analyze linear regression independent variable . 3 . The analysis perform separately ADHD drug . 4 . There significantly boys girl ( 4:1 ) ADHD . Given sex difference prevalence obvious also include sex covariate analysis treatment outcome . 5 . Missing data treat accord principle complete case multiple imputation .</detailed_description>
