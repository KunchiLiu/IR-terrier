	<brief_summary>The purpose study investigate whether exercise class cognitive ( brain ) training component effective usual combine aerobic resistance exercise class older adult cognitive complaint ( concern change memory think skill ) . It hypothesize group randomize exercise class include additional brain training great improvement brain health .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Body Brain Exercise Older Adults With Memory Complaints</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Older adult self-reported cognitive complaint ( CCs ) may increase risk development Alzheimer 's disease dementia . Cognitive decline older adult , particularly reduced memory executive function associate functional decline , institutionalization , increase health care cost . Similarly , cardiovascular risk factor associate cognitive functional impairment age . Aerobic exercise show improve vascular function blood flow brain 's prefrontal cortex . In turn , resistance training produce functional change within distinct cortical region encode recall association task show increase circulate neural growth factor ( i.e. , propose mechanism cognition may preserve improved old age ) . Recent evidence also suggest cognitive training may improve cognitive performance old adult . Therefore , investigate impact combine exercise program ( multi-modality exercise ; M2 ) compare combined exercise program cognitive component ( multi-modality , mind-motor exercise ; M4 ) cognition , cognitive-motor , mobility , neural function vascular outcome older adult cognitive complaint . Community-based exercise program older adult provide widespread access , relatively inexpensive , provide opportunity social interaction . The primary purpose study compare effect M2 M4 exercise program brain health . This study also examine effect different exercise program cardiovascular risk factor mobility . In subset participant , cognitive-motor neural functioning outcome examine .</detailed_description>
