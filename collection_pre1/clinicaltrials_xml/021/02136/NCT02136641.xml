	<detailed_description>Sedation set action aim achieve patient quiet , comfortable , free pain / bad memory diagnostic therapeutic procedure perform . Given regional anesthetic technique frequently use clinical practice relatively traumatic painful procedure , partner multiple occasion sedation , make intervention comfortable patient make easy peer collaboration . Not anesthesiologists use sedation indicate similarly , vast majority practice . Some apply consistently puncture regional block event require multiple puncture , use patient anxious . There various drug sedation anesthesiology multiple anxiolytic , amnesic , analgesic , include barbiturate , benzodiazepine , opioid analgesic , combination thereof , proof ketamine , midazolam , fentanyl , propofol , dexmedetomidine , others . There clear need implement sedation technique provide effectiveness , safety side-effects well low cost search anxiolysis , amnesia , analgesia / drowsiness patient undergoing procedure spinal anesthesia . Reducing anxiety decrease neurological metabolic response surgical trauma become requirement treat anesthetic plan , sedation play key role seek ensure adequate hemodynamic stability locoregional anesthetic technique conscious sedation , , sedation patient respond normally verbal stimulus , preservation cognitive function coordination , without alteration ventilation cardiovascular function . The ideal state sedation depend type patient , type procedure medication use , however recommend maintain level sedation 2 3 conscious sedation , accord Ramsay sedation scale achieve great wellness collaboration , without require intervention keep airway , maintain adequate spontaneous ventilation cardiovascular function normally hold . The objective determine effectiveness three sedation scheme patient schedule undergo spinal anesthesia . MATERIALS AND METHODS A clinical trial , randomize , prospective , single-blind experimental study conduct , three scheme compare sedation patient undergoing spinal anesthesia . Informed consent obtain admitted patient . The study approve ethic committee University Cartagena . Patients meet selection criterion randomize ( accord table random number generate website : http : //stattrek.com/tables/random.aspx ) assign one research group , period June 2011 June 2012 . 3 group form follow : Group 1 give midazolam 0.03 mg / kg , Group 2 apply Midazolam 0.015 mg / Kg + Fentanyl 0.8mcg/kg Group 3 use Midazolam 0,015 mg / Kg + ketamine 0.25 mg / kg , administer single dose group . Sample size , reliability 95 % , power 80 % expect rate improvement experimental group 80 % calculate , total 75 patient , randomly assign one three study group , group consist 25 patient . The investigator select patient meet inclusion criterion age 18 60 year , schedule elective surgery , pre-anesthetic assessment , classify accord risk ASA I ASA II , body mass index 18.5 29.99 , pregnant , high fast 8 hour day procedure , require regional anesthetic technique without contraindication procedure perform patient lateral decubitus , know history allergy , n't exclusion criterion malformation spine level would prevent spinal block without difficulty . Procedure : assign randomly select patient use scheme sedation , 75 number randomly generator random number table , minimum value 1 maximum value 3 , select patient apply corresponding scheme sequential order . On admission operating room patient channel peripheral vein 18 -20Gauge , monitor electrocardiogram ( ECG ) , non -invasive blood pressure ( NIBP ) oxygen saturation pulse oximetry ( O2Sat ) vital sign monitor ; hemodynamic variable record income . Was apply intravenously one pre-established scheme sedation accord patient weight oxygen administer nasal cannula 1Litre/minutes , hemodynamic change record 2.5 5 minute scheme implement evaluate Ramsay scale time . The patient position carry anesthetic technique , Quincke needle 26 Gauge , spinal anesthesia team experience anesthesiology place , correspond author study , number attempt difficulty blockade note , end surgical procedure satisfaction survey perform patient experience spinal block . The data collection perform use format include sociodemographic characteristic , variable interest two measuring scale use : The first RANSAY SCALE , scale use assess depth sedation , validate 30 year ago , easy use gold standard many study evaluate sedation ; increase level scale , increase degree sedation . Being awake patient find level 1 , refer anxious / agitate patient level 2 , partner quiet focus spontaneous eye opening , level 3 closed eyelid , quickly respond verbal stimulus . When patient find asleep , level 4 call still close eye responds quickly tactile verbal stimulus strong , level 5 slow response respond important / painful stimulus level 6 respond stimulus . In addition , SATISFACTION SCALE TYPE LIKERT use subjectively evaluate satisfied patient spinal anesthesia sedation , scale validate , give score 1 refer satisfy , 2 felt satisfied , score 3 dissatisfy , 4 meant feeling unsatisfied finally rating 5 meant dissatisfy . Data analysis : counting categorical variable report absolute number percentage . Differences baseline characteristic post-intervention estimate hypothesis test . For qualitative variable Chi square test Fisher 's exact test use , appropriate . In quantitative variable normal verify Shapiro-Wilk test comparison group ANOVA , analysis support Epi Info v7 Stata software . Ethical issue : declaration Helsinki regulation force Colombia ( 1993 Resolution No.008430 MOH 2378 resolution 2008 good clinical practice ) adjust . No action incur ethical proposal register . Assessment require ethic committee Hospital , give endorsement proceed development , report individual informed consent patient perform .</detailed_description>
