	<brief_summary>The age-related macular degeneration ( AMD ) age-dependent , multi-factorial disease . In Western industrial country , main cause visual impairment . In Germany , approximately 4.5 million people suffer AMD . Genetic well nutritional aspect mainly important AMD development . Until , AMD-patients advise use supplement base carotenoid lutein zeaxanthin , comprise high dos isolate form . Results show effect food item ( kale , spinach ) rich lutein improvement vision scarce . And much need within diet ? Within plan project , human intervention study investigate whether oil-based kale extract fresh kale use improve vision AMD-patients person age 50+ ( without AMD ) . The first study use volunteer without AMD ( &gt; 18 ) investigate dose-dependent effect lutein zeaxanthin ( kale extract ) macular pigment optical density ( MPOD ) . This study also compare bioavailability carotenoid extract supplement . A second study ( also use volunteer without AMD , &gt; 18 ) compare bioavailability lutein zeaxanthin extract kale purée . The third study investigate effect oil-based kale extract improvement MPOD vision AMD-patients control group ( volunteer 50+ without AMD ) . Usually , intestinal absorption lutein zeaxanthin determine analyze change concentration blood plasma . A fast , non-invasive sampling evaluate check efficacy increase uptake lutein . Thus , project test usability buccal mucosa cell detect metabolic change uptake carotenoid . Besides , determination carotenoid content skin check use biomarker carotenoid plasma macula . Thus , plan research project evaluate two non-invasive marker exposition usability marker absorption lutein zeaxanthin blood macula . In addition , minimally need dosage lutein zeaxanthin AMD prevention determine reduce possible risk currently recommend dos compound . The project also present alternative ( kale extract , kale purée ) AMD prevention improve vision use instead currently use high-dose supplement .</brief_summary>
