	<brief_summary>The purpose pilot study determine whether early treatment acute exacerbation chronic obstructive pulmonary disease ( AECOPD ) combination therapy , Salmeterol + Fluticasone Propionate ( SFP - Advair ) reduce use prednisone , know conventional treatment . Primary objective : To determine whether early treatment combination therapy ( SFP ) reduce use prednisone ( conventional treatment ) event AECOPD . Secondary objective : - To evaluate feasibility treatment approach provide pilot data ( need large multi-centre clinical trial ; - To evaluate feasibility need assessment exacerbation onset , health-related quality life physical activity ; - To evaluate safety approach ; term delay start prednisone unfavourable outcome ( ER visit and/or hospitalization ) .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Strategy Early Treatment Exacerbations COPD : Standing Prescriptions Advair With Written Action Plan Event Exacerbation</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>BACKGROUND Acute exacerbation COPD ( AECOPD ) major importance since associate adverse effect morbidity , health status , cost . Conventional treatment include use antibiotic oral corticosteroid ( OCS ) . However , OCS associate significant side effect . This considerable importance since exacerbation occur average 2 4 time per year COPD patient . Alternative treatment high dose inhale corticosteroid also show effective treatment AECOPD . Recently , study clearly demonstrate effect combination therapy ( SFP ) key inflammatory cell mark enhance anti-inflammatory effect compare inhaled corticosteroid alone . Inhaled corticosteroid high level topical anti-inflammatory activity low level systemic . Additionally , combination therapy inhaled corticosteroid long-acting β2-adrenoceptor agonist ( SFP ) appear produce significant anti-inflammatory effect COPD airways see inhaled oral steroid use alone . This could offer potential alternative treatment oral corticosteroid AECOPD . RATIONALE None inhale treatment likely adopt replace use OCS treatment AECOPD unless use promptly onset symptom worsen . Early treatment show clinical importance accelerate symptom recovery reduce hospital admission . Recently , investigator demonstrate early treatment AECOPD achieve implementation write action plan part self-management education . The use action plan help COPD patient recognize symptom change , implement self-care self-initiate customize prescription ( antibiotic &amp; oral steroid ) event exacerbation . Self-management education program write action plan include stand prescription combination therapy ( SFP ) event exacerbation may promise reduce use prednisone AECOPD , conventional treatment .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Diagnosis stable COPD ; 40 year old ; Smoking history least 10 packyears ; Forced Expiratory Volume one second ( FEV1 ) ≤ 70 % predict value FEV1 / Forced Vital Capacity ( FVC ) &lt; 0.70 ; Dyspnea ≥ 2 Medical Research Council ( MRC ) scale ; At least 2 exacerbation require prednisone treatment past 3 year ; Using write action plan demonstrate adequate use selfadministered antibiotic &amp; prednisone ( adequate use define prednisone start patient within 72 hour symptom worsen patient call casemanager recommend follow response ) ; Already Advair BID ( twice day ) maintenance therapy able switch Advair already take another combination medication ( Symbicort ) maintenance therapy COPD . History asthma allergic rhinitis age 40 ; Regular use oxygen , oral corticosteroid , antibiotic ; Unstable life threaten comorbid condition ; Medical condition take medication know affect tremor and/or heart rate ( HR ) . Preexisting medical condition concomitant medication contraindicate salmeterol fluticasone propionate ( e.g . monoamine oxidase inhibitor tricyclic antidepressant , betaadrenergic receptor block agent , non potassiumsparing diuretic , inhibitor cytochrome P450 ( ritonavir , ketoconazole ) ) ; On theophylline . Colonized pseudomonas aeruginosa .</criteria>
