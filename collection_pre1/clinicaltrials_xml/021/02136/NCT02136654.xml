	<detailed_description>South Asians live Canada globally high rate chronic disease include hypertension , type 2 diabetes ( diabetes ) cardiac disease ( 1-3 ) . Diabetes arguably one press chronic disease among South Asian ( SA ) population occur 50 % high rate SA patient general population , develop 5-10 year earlier , one principal cause premature heart attack death group ( 1 ) . Despite burden diabetes population , diabetes management remain poor . Under current health care system , SA patient less likely exercise , follow healthy diet ( 4 ) , participate exercise program ( 5 ) , 24 % le likely achieve glucose , blood pressure lipid target diabetes general population ( 6 ) . 55-60 % SA patient non-adherent diabetes life-saving medication , compare 30-35 % non-adherence general population ( 7 ) . This large gap diabetes care surprise give language communication barrier primary care provider SA patient ( 8-10 ) , lack knowledge diabetes ( 8-11 ) , preference alternative therapy ( 12-14 ) fundamentally different cultural belief diabetes diabetes management ( 15-18 ) . Although preliminary evidence culturally tailor , chronic disease model may improve outcome ( 21-24 ) , current evidence base insufficient justify system modification require provide culturally tailor care across primary care setting Canada . We propose conduct randomize controlled trial ass impact novel culturally tailor lifestyle medication adherence intervention SA patient poorly control diabetes . The study call Novel Model South Asian diabetes Treatment ( NaMaSTe-Diabetes ) trial primary care . The study aim recruit 600 patient type 2 diabetes randomize either culturally tailored lifestyle medication adherence intervention ( family base , culturally tailor diabetes self management education ongoing peer support ) versus usual care glycemic control ( change A1C level ) change blood pressure ( systolic diastolic blood pressure ) baseline 6 month SA patient poorly control type 2 diabetes . The NaMaSTe trial multi-center individual randomize controlled trial 600 SA patient poorly control diabetes ( A1C ≥8 % ) living British Columbia , Canada .</detailed_description>
