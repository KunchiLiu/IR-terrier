	<brief_summary>The investigator study adaptation motion perception manual control alter gravity , include effect drug ( promethazine ) . The investigator also study whether promethazine affect motion perceptual threshold .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Countermeasures Reduce Sensorimotor Impairment Space Motion Sickness Resulting From Altered Gravity Levels</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Adaptation alter gravity concern early report space motion sickness , Apollo exploration era , current planning exploration mission . The propose research program take new approach could lead effective , practical acceptable protocol preadapting astronaut space flight . By use gravito-inertial alteration possible centrifugation different body orientation investigator quantify individual 's sensory adaptation capability use predict minimize consequence movement gravity environment - eventually include weightlessness . The investigator also study whether drug ( promethazine ) affect motion perception motion sickness .</detailed_description>
