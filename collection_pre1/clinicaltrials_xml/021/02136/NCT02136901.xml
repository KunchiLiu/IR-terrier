	<brief_summary>The NUsurface® Meniscus Implant Randomized Study multi-center , prospective randomize , interventional clinical trial test hypothesis NUsurface implant superior non-surgical standard care treat target population.The rationale perform clinical study gather clinical data evaluate safety effectiveness NUsurface device compare Standard Care .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>The VENUS Clinical Study ( Verifying Effectiveness NUsurface® System )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The NUsurface® Meniscus Implant intend use patient medial compartment pain previous partial medial meniscectomy . Patients meet inclusion/exclusion criterion assign balanced randomization one two group : Meniscus Implants versus non-surgical standard care . The KOOS ( Knee injury Osteoarthritis Outcome Score ) IKDC ( International Knee Documentation Committee ) form use provide comprehensive evaluation patient ' pre-intervention post-intervention condition include activity level , pain , swell , lock , stability , support , sport activity , quality life assessment .</detailed_description>
