	<brief_summary>The objective study follow : - To evaluate pharmacokinetic profile Sildenafil cardiac surgery patient risk acute kidney injury - To determine safety tolerability Sildenafil cardiac surgery patient risk acute kidney injury</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Study Determine Pharmacokinetic Profile , Safety Tolerability Sildenafil ( REVATIO® ) Cardiac Surgery</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Acute kidney injury occur one third patient follow cardiac surgery . It manifest acute decline kidney function result significant increase postoperative complication well almost fourfold increase risk postoperative death . Our understand underlying process poor recent systematic review conclude effective treatment . Experimental study demonstrate preservation endogenous Nitric Oxide ( NO ) bioavailability reno-protective response variety injurious stimulus . Endogenous NO activity increase administration phosphodiesterase type 5 ( PDE-5 ) inhibitor sildenafil citrate . This use clinically treatment erectile dysfunction ( Viagra® , Pfizer ) recently , pulmonary hypertension acute right ventricular failure ( Revatio® , Pfizer ) . We develop preclinical swine model extracorporeal circulation ( cardiopulmonary bypass ) mediate acute kidney injury show significant homology occur post cardiac surgery patient . Administration intravenous sildenafil prevents acute kidney injury model association increase NO bioavailability . There recognize clinical need develop prevention treatment strategy AKI result obtain preclinical study indicate Sildenafil suitable development potential prevention strategy post cardiac surgery AKI . Prior conduct safety efficacy trial however intend first establish dose Sildenafil tolerate cardiac surgery patient compare pharmacokinetics dose effective dose identify preclinical work . We therefore propose evaluate pharmacokinetic profile , safety tolerability sildenafil 36 patient undergoing cardiac surgery , open label , dose escalation Phase I study . This study inform design subsequent randomized Phase IIb trial determine efficacy safety</detailed_description>
