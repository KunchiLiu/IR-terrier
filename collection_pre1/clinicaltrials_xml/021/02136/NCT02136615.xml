	<brief_summary>In recent series study perform group , show exposure hyperbaric oxygen ( HBOT ) lead increase insulin sensitivity male subject improvement measure men , diabetes . The aim study investigate time course effect explore mechanism involve exposure HBOT induce increase peripheral insulin sensitivity . Aims : 1 . To determine whether insulin sensitise effect HBOT apparent 24-hours HBO session . 2 . To examine mechanism underpin increase insulin sensitivity follow HBOT .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Does Hyperbaric Oxygen Therapy Lead Sustained Increase Insulin Sensitivity ?</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>All participant attend Hyperbaric Medicine Unit 5 occasion . Day 1 baseline assessment . Days 2 5 consecutive day follow week . An overnight fast required prior day . Day 1 . Baseline assessment . The participant attend overnight fast 0830 frequently sample intravenous glucose tolerance test ( FSIGT ) . Two IV line place baseline blood sample ( 30ml ) drawn measurement gluco-regulatory hormone metabolite time 0 . A glucose bolus administer antecubital vein IV ( 300mg/kg , 25 % Dextrose infuse 1-minute ) time 0 . Blood sampling ( 3ml ) perform 2,4,6,8,10,12,14,16,19,22,25,30,40,50,60,70,90,120,150,180 minute completion glucose bolus . Each blood sample analyse glucose insulin . Total blood collect procedure approximately 60mls . A urine sample collect . A meal provide . Day 2 . The following week , participant attend 0800 overnight fast . They place supine bed subcutaneous adipose tissue biopsy perform use technique Bergstrom : cleansing skin abdomen lateral umbilicus chlorhexidine solution , place fenestrated drape , anaesthesia administer ( 5mL Xylocaine 2 % , adrenaline ) . A 7.5mm incision make skin ( # 11 scalpel ) 5mm Bergstrom needle insert collect approximately 250mg adipose tissue suction . Two three pass use obtain approximately 500mg adipose tissue . The sample wash sterile phosphate buffer solution snap frozen liquid nitrogen . Upon completion biopsy incision close sterile bandage , sterile dress applied pressure apply 10-minutes . Blood take glucose , insulin inflammatory marker ( 30mls ) . The participant sit chair 2-hours routine HBOT session 0830-1030 ( 10:90:30 profile ) . After first HBOT , blood sample take inflammatory marker . Food provide . Day 3 . After overnight fast , participant undergo second routine HBOT session 0830-1030 , follow second fat tissue biopsy . Blood take glucose , insulin inflammatory marker ( 30mls ) HBOT . Food provide . Day 4 . After overnight fast , participant undergo third HBOT session 0830-1030 . This undertaken simultaneously FSIGT . The IV glucose bolus administer begin HBOT hyperbaric chamber reach treatment pressure ( 2 atmosphere absolute ) . On completion FSIGT , meal provide . Day 5 . After overnight fast , participant attend 0830 fourth blood sample inflammatory marker . An FSIGT perform room air outside hyperbaric chamber . A meal provide . A urine sample collect . With blood take three FSIGTs together 5 blood sample take inflammatory marker , total 330 ml blood drawn 9 day .</detailed_description>
