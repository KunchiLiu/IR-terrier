	<brief_title>Addition Daratumumab Combination Bortezomib Dexamethasone Participants With Relapsed Refractory Multiple Myeloma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This open-label ( physicians participant know identity assign treatment ) , randomize ( study medication assign chance ) , multicenter , active-controlled study compare daratumumab , VELCADE , dexamethasone ( DVd ) VELCADE dexamethasone ( Vd ) participant relapse refractory multiple myeloma . Approximately 480 participant randomly assign 1:1 ratio receive either DVd Vd . Randomization stratify International Staging System ( ISS ) , number prior treatment program ( 1 vs. 2 3 vs. &gt; 3 ) , prior VELCADE treatment ( `` '' vs. `` yes '' ) . Within stratum , participant randomize one treatment groups.The study consist Screening Phase , Treatment Phase , Follow-up Phase .
