	<detailed_description>The optimum size endotracheal tube ( ETT ) general anaesthesia remain matter debate . Choice ETT size may particular pertinence thyroid surgery , number reason . Because strong attachment thyroid gland trachea , intraoperative mobilization thyroid lead inevitable movement trachea larynx fix ETT , consequent risk traumatic injury tracheal mucosa , vocal cord , arytenoid . Thus thyroidectomy likely associate great risk laryngeal trauma related ETT operation outside Head Neck region movement larynx . On top , postoperative vocal impairment comprise one important concern thyroidectomy , usually attribute impaired vocal fold function secondary recurrent laryngeal nerve injury . However , post-thyroidectomy vocal impairment also occur case recurrent laryngeal nerve preserve . Thus , concern regard vocal outcome thyroidectomy tend foremost mind surgeon patient , measure take minimize post-thyroidectomy hoarseness , might include choose optimal ETT size , would appear constitute worthwhile endeavor . Laryngeal trauma due endotracheal intubation probably common appreciate , however , give symptom sore throat hoarseness operation generally self-limiting , usually major cause concern . On hand , postoperative vocal symptom may major cause anxiety thyroidectomy , due fear damage recurrent laryngeal nerve external branch superior laryngeal nerve ( SLN ) . Laryngeal trauma without impairment vocal fold function report significant cause vocal symptom thyroid surgery . However , previously publish study attempted correlate post-thyroidectomy vocal symptom sign laryngeal trauma ETT size . The hypothesis present study intubation small size ETT would lead less trauma larynx thyroidectomy intubation standard size tube , would reflect less postoperative throat symptom objective laryngeal alteration . The rationale hypothesis small caliber tube would less unyielding larynx move , thus would lead less laryngeal injury . In order address question , investigator design randomize control trial , compare impact intubation small size tube ( size 6.5 female , size 7 male ) intubation ETTs standard size use investigator department ( size 7.5 female , size 8 male ) .</detailed_description>
