	<brief_summary>Stereotactic ablative radiotherapy ( SABR ) new radiation treatment delivers high-dose , precise radiation small tumor 1-3 week treatment . The study combine SABR surgery treat non-small cell lung cancer . SABR do first , surgery do approximately 10 week later . There extra image do SABR . The purpose study determine effective SABR kill cancer cell , SABR help make surgery effective .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Phase II Trial Measuring Integration Stereotactic Radiotherapy Plus Surgery Early Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The advent stereotactic ablative radiotherapy ( SABR ) provide novel , promise treatment patient early-stage non-small cell lung cancer . SABR use modern radiotherapy planning target technology precisely deliver large , ablative dos radiotherapy . The use SABR neoadjuvant therapy prior surgery may provide novel therapeutic opportunity . In oncology , use neoadjuvant radiotherapy chemoradiotherapy prior surgery become widespread several type cancer , many instance improve local control and/or survival compare surgery alone . Neoadjuvant radiotherapy provide several theoretical advantage , include potentially decrease rate positive margin , decrease size require resection , sterilize tumor avoid seed circulate tumor cell surgery . Although radiologic outcome SABR illustrate local control rate approximately 90 % many study , presence residual post-treatment fibrosis may confound assessment recurrence . The goal study evaluate novel treatment approach : combination neoadjuvant SABR follow surgical resection patient T1T2N0 non-small cell lung cancer , order measure true pathologic rate local control SABR , develop new image biomarkers response , assess clinical outcome , include toxicity , relapse pattern , survival .</detailed_description>
