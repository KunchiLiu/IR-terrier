	<brief_summary>CD39 CD73 know protein express surface Th1 Th17 cell modulate immune relate reaction . Cardiopulmonary bypass ( CPB ) induce inflammatory reaction cardiac surgery , induce immunosuppression . In recent previous study , CD39 CD73 know important role cancer patient induce immunosuppressive reaction consequently induce cancer cell proliferation . However , immunosuppressive effect CD39 CD73 CPB time evaluate previous study . The author hypothesize CD39 CD73 would important role CPB induce immunosuppression . Therefore , present study determine effect CD39 CD73 CPB .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>After obtain permission Institutional Review Board Konkuk University Medical Center , Seoul , South Korea , patient schedule undergo elective cardiac surgery cardiopulmonary bypass ( CPB ) sign write informed consent agreement prospectively participate present study . All patient get cardiac surgery moderate hypothermic cardiopulmonary bypass ( CPB ) one cardiac surgeon . Also , 6ml blood 6ml urine sample obtain total 8 time consecutive order . 1 . Before operation ( pre-CPB1 ) 2 . 15 minute successful CPB weaning ( post-CPB1 ) 3 . 3 hrs CPB weaning ( post-CPB2 ) 4 . 24 hrs CPB weaning ( post-CPB3 ) 5 . 48 hrs CPB weaning ( post-CPB4 ) The following intraoperative exclusion criterion apply : 1 . Emergency operation could obtain pre-CPB1 sample 2 . Patients infectious factor operation 3 . Patients immunosuppressive agent underlying disease operation 4 . Patients history cancer previously 5 . Patients young 19 year old Using blood urine sample , author examine follow 1 . Flow cytometry Th 17 Th 1 cell . 2 . Immunocytochemistry CD39 , CD73 . 3 . Assay IL 1,4,6,8,10 , TNF-α 4 . Other Routine Lab : Cardiac enzyme ( CK-MB , TnI ) , ABGA , OT/PT , BUN/Cr , CBC diff . count , ESR , CRP 5. patient vital sign operation Statistical analysis conduct use SPSS 18.0 ( SPSS Inc. , Chicago , IL , USA ) . CD39 CD73 analyse use Repeated Measures Analysis Variance pairwise multiple comparison perform via tukey method . The comparison continuous variable perform paired Wilcoxon Signed Rank test . The linear regression analysis use determine possible correlation CD39 , CD73 laboratory routine lab . Data express mean ± SD ( 95 % confidence interval . CI ) median ( 25 % -75 % ) , number patient . A p value le 0.05 consider statistically significant .</detailed_description>
