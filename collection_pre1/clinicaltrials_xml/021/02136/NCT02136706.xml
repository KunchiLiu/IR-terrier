	<brief_summary>Encouraged recent data publish , investigator think wait time 10 minute feasible preserve diagnostic accuracy would like assess feasibility diagnostic efficacy W10 compare W30 image pilot study . By combine W10 image half-time acquisition , time technetium-99m myocardial perfusion image procedure could shorten least 50 % , last 40 minute W10 ( 10-minute waiting ) imaging compare 90 minute W30 imaging ( 30-minute waiting ) . The investigator hypothesize ( 1 ) W10 MPI clinically feasible tolerable patient , ( 2 ) W10 MPI provide high image quality ( 3 ) W10 MPI provide diagnostic accuracy comparable W30 MPI .</brief_summary>
