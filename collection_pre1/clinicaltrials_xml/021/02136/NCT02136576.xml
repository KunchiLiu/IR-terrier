	<brief_summary>The aim pilot research project compare clinical effect dentinal hypersensitivity three product : Casein Phosphopeptide-Amorphous Calcium Phosphate ( CPP-ACP ) paste fluoride , 5000 Sodium Fluoride ( NaF ) dentifrice contain Tri-Calcium Phosphate ( TCP ) , dentifrice contain Potassium Nitrate . The hypothesis study CPP-ACP fluoride 5000ppm NaF TCP exhibit great reduction dentinal hypersensitivity compare control ( dentifrice contain Potassium Nitrate ) . The result pilot study validate negate need large clinical study may provide generalizable result use caries-prevention product additional benefit minimize dentinal hypersensitivity .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Dentinal hypersensitivity commonly occur patient gingival recession , result reduced periodontium patient undergone non-surgical surgical periodontal therapy ( Pradeep 2010 , Yilmaz 2011 ) . When gingiva recede , root surface teeth expose ( West 2008 ) . In addition , non-surgical surgical periodontal procedure , cementum root surface remove result scale root planing . This leave dentin expose root surface open dentinal tubule . In addition , dentin le mineralized enamel great susceptibility faster progression root caries dentinal hypersensitivity ( Saunders 2005 ) . Root caries commonly occur patient undergone periodontal therapy extensive root caries often result extraction tooth ( Hull 1997 ) . Dental professional often make variety recommendation remedy dental hypersensitivity , include application fluoride varnish , anti-hypersensitivity toothpaste , gingival grafting procedure various restorative procedure , aim occlude dentinal tubule desensitize pulpal nerve ending ( Brahmbhatt 2012 , Orsini 2010 ) . Since introduction Caries Management By Risk Assessment ( CAMBRA ) Journal California Dental Association 2007 ( Jenson 2007 , Young 2007 ) , marketplace anti-caries product surge . As result , many approach management dental caries introduce dental practitioner sale representative promote several anti-caries product . In addition , reduction abatement progression dental caries ( coronal , root interproximal ) result caries management program report ( Featherstone 1992 , Ito 2012 ) . Many caries management product ingredient include fluoride calcium phosphate ( Amorphous Calcium Phosphate-Casein Phosphopeptide ( Recaldent ™ ) , ( Wang 2012 ) Tri-Calcium Phosphate ™ Novamin ™ ) ( Su 2011 ) . Moreover , encourage clinical finding report , include , limited reduction white spot enamel lesion dentinal hypersensitivity ( Kowalczyk 2006 ) . The topical application `` antihypersensitivity '' material common recommendation ( least invasive `` standard care '' recommendation ) diminish dentinal hypersensitivity serve provide data research study . The study evaluate product result great reduction dentinal hypersensitivity . The application experimental product reduction dentinal hypersensitivity research purpose . The method use test sensitivity study use publish study ( Brahmbhatt 2012 , Holland 1997 ) . The VAS scale use study also use tooth sensitivity study ( Holland 1997 , Hughes 2010 ) . A 30 % decrease VAS score show clinically meaningful ( Ritter 2006 , Raymond 2008 ) . This pilot study would investigate ability anti-caries product reduce dentinal hypersensitivity compare sensitivity-reducing dentifrice . It would novel contribution dental community material proven reduce tooth decay also proven reduce dentinal hypersensitivity . The result may potentially tremendous impact dental community may provide dental professional scientifically-supported approach improve comfort quality life periodontal patient ( patient treat gum disease/ bone loss around teeth ) increase lifespan teeth undergo periodontal treatment .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>At least 18 year age Tooth expose root surface and/or expose dentin Tooth VAS score great equal 3 No adjacent tooth/teeth sensitivity ( define 2 high VAS ) Participation another dental study may alter result study . A medical condition could interfere reliable pain reporting ( e.g. , pain disorder ) Any chronic medical condition require regular use pain antiinflammatory medication Used desensitize dentifrice within precede four week Have receive antihypersensitivity treatment ( varnish precipitate solution ) identify tooth within precede four week Undergoing active orthodontic treatment . Teeth carious lesion , buccal vertical crack enamel , evidence irreversible pulpitis ( pain last five second air stimulation ) Pregnant/ lactate patient ( Clinpro5000 5000ppm fluoride risk ingest product ) Patients Milk Allergy ( CPPACP dairy base product ) Patients Kidney Dialysis ( due free calcium CPPACP , dialysis patient diet limited calcium )</criteria>
