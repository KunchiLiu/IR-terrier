	<brief_summary>The purpose study investigate whether increase blood flow heart ( cardiac output ) , induced administration intravenous fluid , lead increase blood flow vital organ , patient undergo bowel surgery . This study involve 2 phase . Firstly , potential volunteer invite meet research fellow ( medical doctor ) undertaking study , check suitability participate study obtain informed consent . The second phase study take place whilst volunteer bowel operation . They attend theatre normal way , anaesthetise ( put sleep ) , special monitor call oesophageal doppler probe place oesophagus ( food pipe ) via nose . This monitor frequently use bowel surgery help assess much intravenous fluid administer patient measure cardiac output ( amount blood pump heart minute ) . Using cannula ( drip ) already insert arm allow administration anaesthetic , special fluid , call ultrasound contrast agent , injected drip , allow contrast enhance ultrasound scan abdominal organ perform , measure blood flow organ . A small sample blood take earlobe allow u measure chemical blood call lactate . After , intravenous fluid administer order increase amount blood pump heart . Once oesophageal doppler monitor suggest adequate amount fluid give , second ultrasound scan perform measure whether blood flow abdominal organ also increase . A blood sample take earlobe measure change lactate level . At completion operation , third ultrasound scan perform another sample blood take earlobe , help ass blood flow organ .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Potential participant ( patient colorectal cancer offer operation ) highlight Derbyshire NHS trust colorectal multidisciplinary team meeting . All patient fulfil entry requirement see research fellow outpatient meeting particular surgeon ( agree ) . Information pack contain detail study ( information sheet consent form ) give question answer . Patients allow take pack away decide whether would keen participate . Interested patient consent research fellow subsequent pre-operative clinic appointment . The study take place intra-operatively . Monitoring institute determined necessary attending anaesthetist , minimum consist pulse oximetry , ECG non-invasive blood pressure record . Intravenous cannulae sit general anaesthesia induce anaesthetist responsible patient , would normal type surgery . Once patient transfer operating theatre , research fellow insert ODM probe via either nasal oral route CO SV measure ; constitutes normal care . A sterile Phillips iU22 USS probe place patient 's abdomen research fellow administer SonoVue contrast agent intravenously via cannula already sit facilitate anaesthesia , maximum dose 2.4ml . Visceral MVBF measure use CEUS technique . Capillary blood sample take earlobe measurement blood lactate level research fellow . At stage , would typically occur operation nature , research fellow administer intravenous colloid suspension boluses 3ml/kg , maximum 15ml/kg , CO maximise , judge ODM . At stage , research fellow perform CEUS abdominal viscera administer Sonovue contrast agent ( 2nd dose 2.4ml ) measure MVBF Phillips iU22 . Repeat sample capillary blood drawn measure lactate level research fellow . At end operation , 3rd CEUS abdominal viscera , along SV &amp; CO reading , make .</detailed_description>
