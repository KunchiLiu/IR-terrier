	<brief_summary>Losmapimod new anti-inflammatory medication potentially may benefit patient Acute Coronary Syndrome , ( ACS ) , condition include heart attack . There grow understand inflammatory response ACS integral subsequent evolution plaque instability . Losmapimod inhibit p38 mitogen activate protein kinase ( MAPK ) , enzyme may play central role inflammation set heart attack . Inhibition p38 MAPK may stabilize atherosclerotic plaque , reduce risk subsequent plaque rupture , indirectly improve vascular function prevent subsequent thrombosis , thus reduce infarct size risk subsequent cardiac event . This study test whether losmapimod safely reduce risk subsequent cardiovascular event ( death , heart attack , near heart attack require urgent treatment ) start immediately ACS ( specifically , heart attack ) . Patients present heart attack qualify study randomly assign receive 3 month treatment either losmapimod twice daily placebo , administer addition usual standard care therapy heart attack . Following in-hospital period , subject return outpatient visit 4 12 week , well follow visit 24 week .</brief_summary>
