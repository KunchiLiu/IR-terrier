	<detailed_description>Transplantation treatment choice cause end stage renal disease . ( 1 , 2 ) However , without modification recipient 's immune system allograft succumb rejection . To prevent , patient must take immunosuppressive drug life , generally combination steroid , calcineurin inhibitor ( CNI ) , cyclosporine tacrolimus , antiproliferative agent ( azathioprine , mycophenolate mofetil sirolimus ) . ( 3-6 ) Induction brief course anti-T lymphocyte antibody preparation ( daclizumab , basiliximab , muromonab , alemtuzumab , polyclonal anti-thymocyte globulin ) also use approximately 70 % U.S. transplant center . Dependence immunosuppression temper substantial benefit obtain transplantation ( 1-13 ) . The typical regimen relatively complex expensive . More importantly , increase risk opportunistic infection malignancy , many non-immune side effect hamper tolerability . Specifically , CNIs nephrotoxic , side effect significant concern renal transplantation . Steroids exacerbate osteoporosis hyperlipidemia , cause avascular osteonecrosis . Both class agent worsen glucose tolerance hypertension , associate cosmetic effect cause non-compliance . As , method transplantation lessen dependence chronic immunosuppression stand reduce risk expense transplantation . They must , however , also prevent rejection . Development alternate therapy help minimize need lifelong immunosuppression , eliminate entirely need drug induction tolerance , therefore great interest .
