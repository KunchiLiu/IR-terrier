	<brief_summary>One promising approach treatment cancer inhibition modulate crucial signal transduction pathway PI3K-Akt-mTOR . Several PI3K inhibitor test clinical trial cancer treatment head neck cancer yet . BYL719 alpha specific I PI3K inhibitor . It show significant , concentration dependent cell growth inhibition induction apoptosis . We suggest multicenter single arm phase II study determine anti-tumor effect BYL719 patient recurrent and/or metastatic SCCHN fail prior chemotherapy regimen . Enrollment do 5 clinical trial center Korea . Primary objective evaluate disease control rate ( DCR ) 8 week BYL719 , efficacy evaluate investigator analysis base RECIST version 1.1 .</brief_summary>

	<criteria>1 . Histologically cytologically confirm recurrent metastatic squamouscell carcinoma head neck ( SCCHN ) , except nasopharyngeal carcinoma 2 . 18 year age old 3 . Patients must progressive disease one two prior chemotherapy regimen include platinumbased chemotherapy give treatment recurrent and/or metastatic disease , within 6 month concurrent chemoradiation ( without induction chemotherapy ) give definitive treatment . 4 . Life expectancy least 12 week 5 . Ineligibility local therapy ( surgery radiation curative intent ) 6 . At least one lesion measurable accord RECIST 1.1 criterion CT MRI 7 . ECOG performance score 02 8 . Availability tissue sample ( archival tissue rebiopsied tissue ) molecular analysis ( representative paraffin block unstained section tumor diagnostic specimen mandatory ) 9 . Adequate organ function laboratory parameter define : Absolute neutrophil count ( ANC ) ≥1.5x109/L Hemoglobin ( Hgb ) ≥ 9 g/dl ( may reach transfusion ) Platelets ( PLT ) ≥ 100 x 109/L ( may reach transfusion ) AST/SCOT ALT/SGPT ≤ 2.5xULN ( upper limit normal ) ≤ 5 x ULN liver metastases present Serum bilirubin ≤ 1.5 x ULN Serum creatinib ≤ 1.5 x ULN calculate directly measure CrCl ≥ 50 % LLN ( low limit normal ) Fasting plasma glucose ( FPG ) &lt; 140 mg/dL/7.8mmol/L 1 . Prior treatment PI3K pathway inhibitor 2 . Nasopharyngeal carcinoma 3 . Uncontrolled , untreated brain metastasis . Patients treated/controlled asymptomatic CNS metastasis may participate trial . The patient must complete prior treatment CNS metastases ≥ 28 day ( must include radiotherapy and/or surgery ) , corticosteroid therapy , receive stable low dose ( e.g . dexamethasone 4 mg equivalent dose another corticosteroid least 14 day start study treatment ) . 4 . Surgery , chemotherapy irradiation within 3 week study entry 5 . Concomitant chemotherapy , hormonal therapy immunotherapy 6 . Clinically significant cardiac disease impair cardiac function , : Congestive heart failure ( CHF ) require treatment ( New Yort Heart Association ( NYHA ) Grade ≥ 2 ) , leave ventricular ejection fraction ( LVEF ) &lt; 50 % determine multigated acquisition ( MUGA ) scan echocardiogram ( ECHO ) , uncontrolled arterial hypertension define blood pressure &gt; 140/100 mmHg rest ( average 3 consecutive reading ) History current evidence clinically significant cardiac arrhythmia , arterial fibrillation and/or conduction abnormality , e.g . congenical long QT syndrome , high grade/complete AVblockage Acute coronary syndrome ( include myocardial infarction , unstable angina , coronary artery bypass graft ( CABG ) , coronary angioplasty , stenting ) , &lt; 3 month prior screen QT interval adjust accord Fredericia ( QTcF ) &gt; 480 msec screen ECG 7 . Patients diabetes mellitus require insulin treatment and/or clinical sign FPG ≥ 140 mg/dL/7.8mmol/L , history document steroidinduced diabetes mellitus . 8 . Patient take oral drug 9 . Impaired GI function GI disease may significantly alter absorption oral BYL719 ( e.g . ulcerative disease , uncontrolled nausea , vomit , diarrhea , malabsorption syndrome , small bowel resection ) 10 . Patients currently receive medication know risk prolong QT interval induce Torsades de Pointes ( TdP ) treatment either discontinue switched different medication prior start study drug treatment . 11 . Previous concomitant malignant disease , except adequately treat basal cell cancer skin cervical cancer situ , superficial bladder tumor ( Ta , Tis &amp; T1 ) cancer curatively treat &gt; 3 year prior study entry 12 . Pregnant woman , Breastfeeding woman 13 . Other severe acute chronic medical condition laboratory abnormality may increase risk associate trial participation investigational product administration may interfere interpretation trial result , judgment investigator , would make patient inappropriate entry trial ( infection/inflammation , intestinal obstruction , social/psychological complication ) .</criteria>
