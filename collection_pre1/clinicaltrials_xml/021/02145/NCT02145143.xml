	<brief_summary>The purpose study find effect , good and/or bad , drug call vemurafenib , either alone combine another treatment call radioactive iodine , patient thyroid cancer . It known vemurafenib work thyroid cancer . This study test small number patient use radioactive iodine treat thyroid cancer . This type study call pilot study . If result positive , large study patient may do test treatment .</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Patients must histologically cytologically confirm thyroid carcinoma follicular origin ( include papillary , follicular , poorly differentiate subtypes respective variant ) . Confirmation CLIA certify laboratory FDAapproved assay one patient 's thyroid tumor ( primary tumor , recurrent tumor , metastasis ) possess BRAF mutation V600 . Patients must measurable disease , define least one lesion accurately measure least one dimension ( long diameter record nonnodal lesion short axis nodal lesion ) ≥ 20 mm conventional technique ≥ 10 mm CT scan , MRI , caliper clinical exam . See Section 11 evaluation measurable disease . Tumors previously irradiate field may consider measureable evidence tumor progression radiation treatment . RAIrefractory disease structural imaging , define one following : 1 . A metastatic lesion radioiodineavid diagnostic radioiodine scan perform 2 year prior enrollment current study , 2 . A radioiodineavid metastatic lesion remain stable size progress despite radioiodine treatment 6 month prior entry study . There size limitation index lesion use satisfy entry criterion . 3 . The presence least one fluorodeoxyglucose ( FDG ) avid lesion SUVmax ≥ 5 . No recent treatment thyroid cancer define : 1 . No prior 131I therapy allow &lt; 6 month prior initiation therapy protocol . A diagnostic study use &lt; 10 mCi 131I consider 131I therapy . 2 . No external beam radiation therapy &lt; 4 week prior initiation therapy protocol . ( Previous treatment radiation indication allow investigator judge previous radiation significantly compromise patient safety protocol . ) 3 . No chemotherapy target therapy ( e.g. , tyrosine kinase inhibitor ) allow &lt; 4 week prior initiation therapy protocol . Age ≥ 18 year . ECOG performance status ≤ 2 ( Karnofsky ≥60 % Life expectancy great 3 month . Able swallow retain orallyadministered medication clinically significant gastrointestinal abnormality may alter absorption malabsorption syndrome major resection stomach bowel . All prior treatmentrelated toxicity must CTCAE v4.0 grade ≤ 1 ( except alopecia ) . Grade 2 prior treatment related toxicity may allow discussion Principal Investigator . Patients must normal organ marrow function define : Absolute neutrophil count ( ANC ) ≥ 1.5x109/L Hemoglobin ≥ 9 g/dL Platelets ≥ 100 x 109/L Albumin ≥ 2.5 g/dL Total bilirubin ≤ 1.5x institutional ULN Aspartate aminotransferase ( AST ) alanine aminotransferase ( ALT ) ≤ 2x institutional ULN unless related primary disease Creatinine ≤ 1.5 mg/dL OR calculate creatinine clearance ( CockcroftGault formula ) ≥ 50 mL/min OR 24hour urine creatinine clearance ≥ 50 mL/min Negative pregnancy test within 7 day prior start study premenopausal woman . Women nonchildbearing potential may include without pregnancy test either surgically sterile postmenopausal ≥ 1 year . Fertile men woman must use effective method contraception treatment least 6 month completion treatment direct physician . Effective method contraception define result low failure rate ( i.e. , less 1 % per year ) use consistently correctly ( example implant , injectables , combine oral contraception intrauterine device ) . At discretion Investigator , acceptable method contraception may include total abstinence case lifestyle patient ensures compliance . ( Periodic abstinence [ e.g. , calendar , ovulation , symptothermal , postovulation method ] withdrawal acceptable method contraception . ) Ability understand willingness sign write informed consent document . Patients must agree undergo two research biopsy malignant lesion . Patients may exempt biopsy 1 ) investigator person perform biopsy judge tumor accessible biopsy , 2 ) investigator person perform biopsy feel biopsy pose great risk patient , 3 ) patient 's platelet count &lt; 100,000/mcl he/she safely remove anticoagulation therapy ( anticoagulation therapy need temporarily hold biopsy procedure ) . If tumor accessible biopsy also lesion use RECIST v1.1 response evaluation , patient may exempt biopsy . The goal minimum 3 patient undergo one research biopsy . Accrual may limited subject whose tumor safely accessible biopsy ensure accrual goal research biopsy describe meet ( e.g. , 7 10 patient accrue without biopsy obtain , subsequent subject register must qualify attempted research biopsy order enrol . ) Availability archival tumor tissue thyroid cancer primary metastasis ( tissue block minimum 30 unstained slide would require . Patients less archival tissue available may still eligible study discussion MSK Principal Investigator . ) Concomitant malignancies previous malignancy within last 3 year . Exception : Patients diseasefree 3 year , patient history completely resect nonmelanoma skin cancer , and/or patient indolent secondary malignancy , eligible . Use investigational drug within 28 day precede first dose vemurafenib study . Symptomatic untreated leptomeningeal brain metastasis spinal cord compression . Have know immediate delay hypersensitivity reaction idiosyncrasy drug chemically relate vemurafenib thyrotropin alpha ( Thyrogen ) . History evidence cardiovascular risk include follow : Corrected QT ( QTc ) interval ≥ 450 msec baseline history congenital long QT syndrome uncorrectable electrolyte abnormality History evidence current , clinically significant uncontrolled arrhythmia ( exception : patient control atrial fibrillation &gt; 30 day prior initiation therapy protocol eligible ) . History acute coronary syndrome ( specifically , myocardial infarction unstable angina ) , severe/unstable angina , coronary angioplasty , stenting within 6 month prior initiation therapy protocol . History symptomatic congestive heart failure within 6 month prior initiation therapy protocol . History cerebrovascular attack transient ischemic attack within 6 month prior initiation therapy protocol . Uncontrolled intercurrent illness include , limited , ongoing active infection psychiatric illness/social situation would limit compliance study requirement . Pregnant , lactating , breast feeding woman . Patients unable follow low iodine diet require medication high content iodide ( amiodarone ) . Patients receive iodinated intravenous contrast part radiographic procedure within 3 month study registration . Those iodinated intravenous contrast within time frame may still eligible urinary iodine analysis reveals excess iodine adequately clear last intravenous contrast administration . Unwillingness inability comply study followup procedure .</criteria>
