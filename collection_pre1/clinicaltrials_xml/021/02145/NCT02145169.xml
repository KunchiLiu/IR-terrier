	<detailed_description>Drugs fentanyl , midazolam , propofol widely use emergency department procedural sedation analgesia rapid onset short duration action . Unfortunately , agent may cause respiratory depression , particularly combine sedative agent , administer large dos , give patient underlie respiratory disease . Ketamine hydrochloride phencyclidine derivative cause dissociation cortical limbic system prevent high center perceive visual , auditory , painful stimulus . It possess rapid onset short duration action produce profound sedation analgesia . Ketamine also non-competitive NMDA antagonist , complement NO . However , laryngeal reflex maintain respiratory depression rare . These property make ketamine popular agent procedural sedation analgesia pediatric emergency department patient . Unfortunately , give adult patient , frequently cause emergence anxiety , nightmare , hallucination , delirium . These emergence reaction limit use ketamine adult . The incidence reaction 7-10 % child . Emergence reaction may product state patient becomes disassociate . Therefore , patient relax prior ketamine administration adjunct use NO , adverse emergence reaction may reduce . A number agent include diazepam , lorazepam , fentanyl , droperidol , others use vary success reduce prevent emergence reaction associate ketamine use . Diazepam lorazepam successful , use may prolong recovery time , make less desirable emergency department set . Midazolam show low rate emergence reaction use concurrently ketamine adult . However , like benzodiazepine , small risk respiratory depression hypoxia use midazolam , could lead adverse respiratory event . Inhaled nitrous oxide may ideal adjunct prevention emergence reaction adult treat ketamine . Nitrous oxide colorless gas diffuse rapidly across pulmonary alveolus provide analgesia anxiolysis minimal sedative effect , rapid induction , emergence . Nitrous oxide weak sedative agent potential significant analgesic effect . Noncompetitive antagonist activity NMDA receptor along activation opioid receptor contribute anesthetic mechanism . There rare adverse event , often cite case report chronic acute toxicity cause myeloneuropathies polyneuropathies . Nitrous oxide use general anesthesia 2 century , use outside operating room begin Tunstall introduce nitrous oxide/oxygen mixture analgesic agent labor . Since inception , nitrous oxide/oxygen mixture use readily field dentistry , gastrointestinal procedure , child 's procedural sedation . Nitrous oxide often administrated via continuous flow on-demand concentration 50-70 % . There early data describe favorable adverse event profile nitrous oxide single agent adult . Hennequin et al . demonstrated support efficacy nitrous oxide major adverse cardio respiratory event . Although approximately 10 % participant receive mild gastrointestinal behavioral side effect ( e.g . agitation ) . Greater 90 % study participant state would receive nitrous oxide . In large prospective trial , Babl et al . find 2 patient 655 suffer serious adverse event ( i.e. , chest pain oxygen desaturation ) . Both patient administer 70 % nitrous oxide compare conservative 50 % concentration . Additionally , increase incidence minor adverse event ( i.e. , emesis agitation ) high concentration nitrous oxide . Kariman et al . compare nitrous oxide versus parental fentanyl analgesic long bone fracture find similar pain score rapid decrease pain score nitrous oxide group compare opiate group . Nitrous oxide show safe effective agent procedural sedation child , include work combine opiate benzodiazepine nitrous continuously . Burton et al . conduct small , randomize control trial study effectiveness nitrous oxide anxiety score child laceration repair . They find significant decrease group use nitrous oxide compare placebo group . This finding validate Luhmann et al . 50 % continuous flow nitrous oxide result less distress anxiety well increase patient satisfaction compare midazolam topical anesthetic agent . The study also show main adverse event associate nitrous oxide nausea vomiting , whereas midazolam group significant ataxia dizziness . There demonstrable advantage combination midazolam nitrous oxide regard patient satisfaction versus nitrous oxide alone , increase adverse event midazolam include . A study perform Evans et al . demonstrate pain memory procedure child receive either nitrous oxide versus child receive intramuscular meperidine combination promethazine fracture reduction similar , increased satisfaction decrease length stay nitrous oxide group . Seith et al . demonstrate addition intranasal fentanyl nitrous oxide child result deep level sedation compare nitrous oxide alone ; however , serious adverse event . Nitrous oxide use ketamine administration may ideal combination prevention emergence reaction adult sedate ED . Like ketamine , nitrous oxide excellent cardio-respiratory profile well analgesic anxiolytic quality . The anxiety pain surround procedural sedation limited procedure , elapse time time patient enters ED time spend preparation procedure significant lead increase anxiety , may exacerbate emergence reaction adult . Using nitrous oxide ketamine administration may mitigate . While midazolam show efficacy reduce emergence reaction adult sedate ketamine , believe inhale nitrous oxide may equivalent midazolam , good cardio-respiratory profile . Since novel concept , believe pilot study evaluate safety efficacy 50/50 nitrous oxide/oxygen administration adult ketamine administration warrant .</detailed_description>
