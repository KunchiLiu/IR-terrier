	<brief_summary>This multicenter , randomize , blind , 2-arm phase IIb trial compare efficacy safety Lenalidomide maintenance Bortezomib/Melphalan/Prednison ( VMP ) induction VMP without maintenance ( Placebo ) . In addition trial ass treatment Revlimid/low dose Dexamethasone ( Rd ) Salvage VMP without sufficient response ( less PR ) observational arm . Key eligibility criterion include patient newly diagnose multiple myeloma 65 year age old candidate high-dose chemotherapy autologous stem cell transplantation . Patients poor performance status serious coexistent medical condition exclude study . After registration patient receive 6 cycle VMP ( modify accord Mateos et al. ) . Patients receive least PR complete VMP randomize either Lenalidomide 10 mg/d continuously maintenance placebo . Randomization stratify accord quality response VMP induction ( PR vs. VGPR + stringent complete remission [ sCR ] + CR ) . Patients able complete VMP due toxicity reach least PR minimum four cycle therapy immediately proceed randomization . Blinded phase continue progression end study . After unblinding , patient receive placebo treat Rd . Patients reach PR induction VMP progressive treatment VMP randomize , switch observation arm treat Rd immediately . The study treatment end confirm progression maintenance treatment ( Lenalidomide placebo ) patient reach PR induction treatment , confirm progression second-line therapy Revlimid® Dexamethasone patient reach PR induction treatment . All patient follow every 3 month end study treatment , end study . The study end two year Last Patient In ( i.e . randomization maintenance ) sufficient event primary endpoint receive , later 8 year trial initiation ( whatever come first ) .</brief_summary>

	<criteria>1 . Must understand voluntarily sign informed consent form . 2 . Must ≥18 year age time sign informed consent form . 3 . Must able adhere study visit schedule protocol requirement . 4 . Previously untreated , symptomatic multiple myeloma define 3 criterion : Multiple Myeloma ( MM ) diagnostic criterion ( 3 require ) : Monoclonal plasma cell bone marrow ≥10 % and/or presence biopsyproven plasmacytoma Monoclonal protein present serum and/or urine Myelomarelated organ dysfunction ( least one follow ) : [ C ] Calcium elevation blood ( serum calcium &gt; 10.5 mg/dl upper limit normal ) [ R ] Renal insufficiency ( serum creatinine &gt; 2 mg/dl ) [ A ] Anemia ( hemoglobin &lt; 10 g/dl 2 g &lt; laboratory normal ) [ B ] Lytic bone lesion osteoporosis AND measurable disease protein electrophoresis analysis define follow : Immunoglobulin ( Ig ) G multiple myeloma : Serum monoclonal paraprotein ( Mprotein ) level 1.0 g/dl urine Mprotein level 200 mg/24 hour IgA multiple myeloma : Serum Mprotein level 0.5 g/dl urine Mprotein level 200 mg/24 hour IgM multiple myeloma ( IgM Mprotein plus lytic bone disease document skeletal survey plain film ) : Serum Mprotein level ≥ 1.0 g/dl urine Mprotein level ≥ 200mg/24hours IgD multiple myeloma : Serum Mprotein level 0.05 g/dl urine Mprotein level 200 mg/24 hour Light chain multiple myeloma : Serum Mprotein level 1.0 g/dl urine Mprotein level 200 mg/24 hour AND least 65 year age old , young 65 year age , candidate stem cell transplantation : The patient decline undergo stem cell transplantation OR : Stem cell transplantation available patient 5 . Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group ( ECOG ) performance status score 0 , 1 , 2 6 . Female childbearing potential ( FCBP ) † must : Understand potential teratogenic risk unborn child Understand need effective contraception , without interruption , 4 week start study treatment , throughout entire duration study treatment , dose interruption 28 day end study treatment Be capable comply effective contraceptive measure agree use two reliable form contraception simultaneously practice complete abstinence heterosexual contact follow time period relate study : 1 ) least 28 day start study drug ; 2 ) participate study ; 3 ) dose interruption ; 4 ) least 28 day study treatment discontinuation . The two method reliable contraception must include one highly effective method one additional effective ( barrier ) method . FCBP must refer qualified provider contraceptive method need . The following example highly effective additional effective method contraception : Highly effective methods* : Intrauterine device ( IUD ) ** Progesterone hormonal contraceptive ( birth control pill , injection , implant ) * Tubal ligation Partner 's vasectomy Additional effective method : Male condom ( partner ) Diaphragm Cervical Cap ( * ) Because increase risk venous thromboembolism patient multiple myeloma take Lenalidomide Dexamethasone , combine oral contraceptive pill recommend . If patient currently use combine oral contraception switch one effective method list . The risk venous thromboembolism continue 4 6 week discontinue combined oral contraception . The efficacy contraceptive steroid may reduce cotreatment Dexamethasone . ( ** ) Implants levonorgestrelreleasing intrauterine system associate increased risk infection time insertion irregular vaginal bleeding . Prophylactic antibiotic consider particularly patient neutropenia . Be inform understand potential consequence pregnancy need notify study doctor immediately risk pregnancy Agree two medically supervised pregnancy test minimum sensitivity 25 mIU/ml ( milliInternational Units per milliliter ) prior start Lenalidomide . The first pregnancy test must perform within 10 14 day prior start Lenalidomide second pregnancy test must perform within 24 hour prior start Lenalidomide . The patient receive Lenalidomide study doctor verify result pregnancy test negative . She must understand need commence study treatment soon study drug dispense follow second negative pregnancy test . This requirement also apply FCBP practice complete continue abstinence . Must understand need accepts undergo pregnancy test frequency follow : FCBP regular menstrual cycle must agree pregnancy test weekly first 28 day study participation every 28 day study , study discontinuation , day 28 follow study drug discontinuation . If menstrual cycle irregular , pregnancy test must occur weekly first 28 day every 14 day study , study discontinuation , day 14 28 follow study drug discontinuation . This requirement also apply FCBP practice complete continue abstinence . Females must agree abstain breastfeed study participation least 28 day study drug discontinuation .
