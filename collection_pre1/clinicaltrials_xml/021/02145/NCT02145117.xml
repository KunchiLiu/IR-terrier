	<brief_summary>This project aim develop test structural functional brain image biomarkers improvement chronic pain mind/body intervention perspective critical veteran population , namely veterans post traumatic headache ( PTH ) associate mild traumatic brain injury ( TBI ) . The project also aim examine feasibility sample veteran PTH perform rest state structural neuroimaging protocol , obtain active participation completion MBSR training . Lastly , exploratory analysis brain imaging data perform determine hypothesize candidate biomarkers associate positive outcome MBSR determine estimate effect size future study PTH population .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Brain Biomarkers w/Mind-Body Tx Veterans With Post Traumatic Headache ( PTH )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Returning veteran Iraq Afghanistan ( OIF/OEF veteran ) high incidence TBI ( 14-23 % ) large number mild TBI ( i.e. , discernible structural brain damage ) 63.5 % persistent headache . Treatment PTH population difficult mind/body intervention include Mindfulness Based Stress Reduction ( MBSR ) may offer significant benefit . A biomarker support clinical endpoint ( `` surrogate endpoint '' ) help predict clinical benefit , could use efficiently completely assess mind/body treatment effect clinical trial PTH , compare various complementary alternative medicine ( CAM ) treatment , potentially target specific treatment patient likely benefit . This project aim investigate candidate biomarkers MBSR response veteran PTH . Primarily , subject interested appropriate study , undergo screen regular clinic visit VAGLAS physical medicine rehab department . If subject respond advertisement screen use tool enrollment criterion require veteran VAGLAS . We expect need enroll screen less 33 subject order complete 20 evaluable subject analysis . The study subject evaluate severity PTH , impact PTH life , extent disease/pain condition . If eligible nurse coordinator contact schedule pre-MBSR functional MRI visit . At MRI evaluate pattern activity ( functional connectivity ) brain rest , look cortical thickness . Following MRI visit subject complete 9-week modify MBSR train qualified instructor . Mid-study ( MBSR class 4 ) subject ask complete mid-study questionnaire home Survey Monkey paper choose . At end MBSR training subject complete least 3 visit , functional ( f ) MRI procedure repeat compare first . Three month complete study follow-up visit complete behavioral/symptom/quality life questionnaires line via SurveyMonkey . This see change biomarkers mediate change behavioral measure 3-mo post Treatment ( i.e . measure stability ) . All , complete study subject screen visit , pre post training MRI visit , 9 MBSR training visit , mid study questionnaire , 4-hr retreat visit week 6 final 3-mo f/u visit questionnaire .</detailed_description>
