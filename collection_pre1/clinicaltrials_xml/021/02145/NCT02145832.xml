	<brief_title>Fluconazole Versus Micafungin Neonates With Candidiasis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The epidemiology candidiasis rapidly change ; recent estimate nearly 50 % Candida bloodstream isolate non-albicans Candida specie require use treatment active . Because high risk associate candida infection premature baby fluconazole prophylaxis recommend Neonatal Intensive Care Units ( NICUs ) high incidence fungal infection . As candida infection difficult prove require urgent treatment , particular avoid central nervous system ( CNS ) infection , treatment often start high risk patient infection suspect , i.e . clinical argument without wait positive culture ( 10 % case ) . Fluconazole approve use treatment neonatal candidiasis . In contrast , efficacy echinocandins treatment invasive candidiasis suggest pre-clinical clinical study . Related Micafungin , available data suggest dosage great currently recommend infant ( 2 4 mg/kg/day ) may ensure adequate coverage CNS , give ability low dosage micafungin penetrate cerebrospinal compartment diffuse cerebrospinal fluid deem suboptimal . The dos administer higher currently use order optimize efficacy , concept load dose use drug project , present antifungal treatment strategy adult , never apply infant preterm neonate .</detailed_description>
