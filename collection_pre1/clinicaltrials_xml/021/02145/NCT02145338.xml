	<brief_summary>This research project design find whether people suffer repeat urinary tract infection ( UTI ) relate need empty bladder intermittently fine plastic tube ( catheter ) ; process call clean intermittent self-catheterisation ( CISC ) , benefit take continuous daily low-dose antibiotic ( antibiotic prophylaxis ) . The investigator estimate 40,000 people United Kingdom need use CISC regularly empty bladder either nerve damage multiple sclerosis failure bladder muscle contract , 25 % ( 10,000 people ) suffer frequent UTI . One way reduce problem may take small daily dose antibiotic study aim find whether treatment effective worthwhile people suffer problem National Health Service ( NHS ) . The two option compare trial firstly , daily preventive dose ( prophylaxis ) antibiotic routinely use purpose ( either nitrofurantoin trimethoprim cefalexin ) , secondly prophylaxis . The investigator think overall decrease 20 % frequency UTI would large enough future patient use CISC get troublesome recurrent UTIs offer antibiotic prophylaxis routinely . The investigator also assess harm cause continuous use antibiotic , particularly side effect people take change resistance bacteria antibiotic . The investigator work whether balance benefit harm make use prophylaxis worthwhile people carry CISC NHS whole .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The AnTIC trial 40-site , pragmatic , patient randomise superiority trial compare experimental strategy daily antibiotic prophylaxis control strategy prophylaxis . Both group otherwise receive usual care include demand discrete treatment course antibiotic treatment UTI . The trial set primary secondary National Health Service ( NHS ) care . Participants clinician blind allocate intervention central trial staff manage analyse trial data , far possible , unaware participant allocation . The investigator also assess participant perception benefit firstly completion treatment satisfaction questionnaire exit secondly qualitative analysis semi-structured interview trial completion explore view attitude purposive sample participant towards trial intervention . The primary economic analysis ass cost per UTI avoid also perform cost-utility analysis contingent valuation study . Bacterial ecological change assess comparing change resistance pattern E. coli urine perianal swab . The investigator formulate recruitment plan progressively build target 372 participant 24 month . The primary objective determine relative clinical effectiveness cost-effectiveness experimental UTI prevention strategy continuous once-daily prophylactic antibiotic therapy control strategy prophylaxis people carry intermittent bladder catheterisation suffer recurrent UTI . Outcomes collect 12 month participant analyse trial termination accord intention treat . Primary objective : - Determine relative impact incidence UTI 12 month - Determine incremental cost per symptomatic UTI avoid Secondary objective : - Clinical - Determine relative effect quality life ( QoL ) amongst trial participant - Measure overall satisfaction prophylactic antibiotic treatment - Assess participant ' perception benefit 12 month - Record adverse effect related prophylaxis treatment antibiotic use - Determine relative rate hospitalisation UTI - Measure difference estimate glomerular filtration rate ( eGFR ) 12 month - Determine rate asymptomatic bacteriuria 12 month - Assess ecological change E. coli isolate urine perianal swab - Economic - Measure incremental cost per quality-adjusted life year ( QALY ) gain repeat completion SF-36 - Assess participant ' willingness pay avoid UTI contingent valuation end trial participation incorporate data economic evaluation use cost-benefit framework . The investigator recruit population adult user CISC . The set NHS hospital community sit throughout UK CISC use teach and/or monitor . The investigator expect randomise least 372 participant 24 month period . For primary outcome purpose , follow continue 12 month intervention . Participants consent separately submit additional urine sample perianal swab six month trial completion ( 18-month timepoint ) ass return baseline E. coli ecology . Separate consent also ask permission access clinical record extend follow nine year ( ten year total ) life-long linkage central NHS database . Allowing four-month analysis phase , total plan trial duration 42 month .</detailed_description>
