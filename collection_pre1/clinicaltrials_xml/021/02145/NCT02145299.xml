	<detailed_description>The primary objective study compare technical success in-hospital safety TruePath device CROSSER device patient symptomatic femoro-popliteal CTO . Subjects follow clinically hospital 1 month follow index procedure . All subject undergo procedural intravascular ultrasound ( IVUS ) imaging . The study population consist 75 patient symptomatic femoro-popliteal CTO indication revascularization . Subjects must previously document conventional percutaneous procedure concurrent fail attempt cross CTO use conventional guidewire technique . All subject must meet inclusion exclusion criterion sign Informed Consent Form approve local Institutional Review Board ( IRB ) prior enrollment randomization .</detailed_description>
