	<brief_title>Phase 1/2 Study Determine Optimal Dose Treating Bone Metastases Using Novel STAT-RT Workflow</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The purpose research study evaluate safety effectiveness experimental procedure call Focused Radiation may result fast way plan deliver radiation treatment pain cause metastatic bone tumor ( cancerous tumor originally come another organ spread bone ) . Focused radiation ( radiation focus tumor bone reduce radiation dose normal tissue ) use standard care treatment patient painful metastatic tumor spin one treatment . In study , focus radiation use treat tumor bone well . The current standard care radiation treatment planning delivery take 2 3 week start finish depend many treatment give although standard care treat patient 1-10 treatment . The University Virginia develop experimental workflow/process : radiation treatment planning delivery workflow call `` STAT RAD '' ( STAT mean `` right away '' , RAD mean radiation ) . This experimental workflow shorten time take plan treat painful bone metastases 1-2 hour . When one treatment give standard radiation dose 8 Gray . This result radiation retreatment rate treat bone 20 % prior study persistent recurrent bone pain . In study patient treat high dos target radiation determine high dos , report safely deliver bone metastasis spine low re-treatment rate , safely deliver non-spine bone metastasis . After treatment , patient follow pain relief treat bone , need pain medication , quality life , toxicity , need retreat bone metastasis persistent recurrent pain .</detailed_description>
	<criteria>Patient 13 major painful osseous metastasis ( target lesion ) Radiographic evidence ( CT , MR , PET CT ) consistent osseous metastatic disease CT , MR , PET CT obtain within 4 week treatment use prestudy treatment delivery . The GTV target lesion determine radiographic study must â‰¤ 250 cubic centimeter . NOTE : Patient still eligible diagnostic image set available within 4 week treatment patient undergo kVCT simulation Department Radiation Oncology contour directly onto image set . Patient medically able undergo palliative radiation therapy Patient pain persistent distinguishably associate target site treat Planning Target Volume 1 ( PTV1 ) must &gt; 5mm spinal cord brain Women Childbearing age men must consent use adequate contraception six month follow study entry Inability lie treatment table 1 hour Systemic therapeutic radionuclide delivery within 30 day prior treatment Target lesions previously treat external beam radiation Long bone target lesion Mirels fracture score &gt; 7 Unstable bone target lesion require surgical stabilization PTV1 locate within 5mm spinal cord brain A serious , uncontrolled medical disorder Pregnancy</criteria>
