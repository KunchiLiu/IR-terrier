	<brief_summary>As function grow population old adult , estimate 3.48 million total knee arthroplasty ( TKA ) procedures perform annually U.S. 2030 . Despite near-universal success surgery mitigate chronic knee pain , TKA successful restore long-term physical function older adult , primarily quadriceps muscle atrophy , explain 77 % strength deficit . Overall , strength functional mobility TKA patient 30-50 % age-matched healthy control . Functional task stair-climbing remain clinical problem 75 % patient follow TKA . Muscle atrophy occur operative non-operative leg , essentially permanent old patient impaired ability increase muscle mass . The purpose clinical research determine effect essential amino acid ( EAA ) supplementation muscle mass , strength , functional mobility follow TKA old adult . Based strong preliminary data , investigator hypothesize twice-daily ingestion 20 g EAA 1 wk 6 wk TKA increase basal rate muscle protein synthesis via inactivation catabolic signal , up-regulation anabolic cyto-protective protein . The investigator hypothesize short-term atrophy prevention accelerate return functional mobility lead longer-term structural functional adaptation , improve quality life old TKA patient v . Placebo . Identifying mechanisms up-regulated EAA treatment preserve muscle volume mobility major impact rehabilitation science . This study accomplish two specific aim : ( 1 ) determine EAA elevate basal rate muscle protein synthesis up-regulating anabolic pathway cyto-protective protein , inactivate catabolic pathway short term v . Placebo ( 2 ) determine short-term prevention atrophy , weakness , functional mobility lead positive change muscle cell structure function , improve quality life long term v . Placebo .

	<brief_title>Mechanistic Approach Preventing Atrophy Restoring Function Older Adults</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The investigative team complete recent study show essential amino acid ( EAA ) supplementation attenuate quadriceps atrophy accelerate return functional mobility follow TKA . For patient EAA , quadriceps atrophy -6 % -3 % operative non-operative quadriceps , respectively , 6 wks TKA , -18 % -10 % , respectively , patient Placebo , threefold difference . Of clinical relevance , patient EAA able maintain strength demonstrate accelerated return functional mobility v . Placebo 6 wks post-TKA . Positive change cellular level likely responsible reduction muscle loss preservation strength , explain acceleration return functional mobility . As , hypothesize twice-daily ingestion 20 g EAA 1 wk 6 wks TKA increase basal rate muscle protein synthesis via inactivation catabolic signal ( FoxO3a ) , up-regulation anabolic cyto-protective protein . We also propose short-term atrophy prevention accelerate return functional mobility translate long-term ( 6 mo 1 yr post-TKA ) structural functional adaptation , lead improve quality life TKA patient EAA supplementation v . Placebo . The study use two-arm parallel design determine effect EAA supplementation post-TKA muscle cell structure function , quality life short term ( 6 month post-TKA ) long term ( 1 yr post-TKA ) v . Placebo . Subjects 80 old male female adult primary TKA Slocum Center Orthopedics Sports Medicine , Eugene , Oregon . Slocum study staff pre-screen/identify potential subject recruitment base inclusion/exclusion criterion . Eligible patient invite join study . After completion inform consent procedure , participant assign unique patient identification number , randomly assign either EAA Placebo 1:1 allocation ratio , blind treatment condition subject research staff/statisticians collect data . Twice-daily ingestion 20 g supplement begin 7 day prior TKA end 6 wks post . EAA subject receive EAA Placebo subject receive non-essential amino acid Alinine . Subjects document compliance supplement protocol log book return empty vial . Subjects follow 1 yr. Key research question : ( ) Does EAA prevent shorter-term ( 6 wks post-TKA ) bilateral muscle atrophy , preserve quadriceps strength , accelerate return functional mobility v . Placebo ? ( b ) Are shorter-term sex difference outcome measure ? ( c ) Will EAA increase longer-term ( 6 mo post-TKA ) quadriceps strength functional mobility v . Placebo ? ( ) Does EAA improve long-term ( 1 yr post-TKA ) functional mobility measure quality life v . Placebo ? ( e ) Are long-term sex difference functional mobility measure quality life ? Assessment point 6 wks , 4 wks , 1 wk prior surgery , 1 wk , 2 wks , 6 wks , 6 mo , 1 yr post-TKA . At different assessment point , collect demographic , medical ( e.g. , length hospital stay , tourniquet use ) , physiological ( e.g. , muscle biopsy , MRI , DEXA , strength ; blood test ) , pharmacologic , functional mobility , physical activity ( accelerometer ) , psychometric ( e.g. , quality life ; Veterans RAND 12-item Health Survey [ VR-12 ] ) , food intake ( 3-day diary ) , physical therapy , perceive pain data . The following schedule assessment follow : 6 mo pre-TKA ( enrollment screening ) , 6 wks pre-TKA ( screen , survey , DEXA scan , MRI test , physical activity food record ) , 4 week pre-TKA ( blood draw , strength functional mobility testing , muscle fat biopsy ) ; 1 wk pre-TKA hospital ( physical activity food record ) ; 1 wk post-TKA ( physical activity food record ) ; 2 wks post-TKA ( blood draw , physical activity food record ) ; 6 wks post-TKA ( blood draw , MRI test , strength functional mobility testing , physical activity food recording , muscle fat biopsy ) ; 3 mo post-TKA ( survey , strength functional mobility testing , physical activity food record ) ; 6 mo post-TKA ( survey , DEXA scan , MRI test , strength functional mobility testing , physical activity food recording , muscle fat biopsy ) , 1 yr ( survey , DEXA scan , MRI test , strength functional mobility testing , physical activity food recording , muscle fat biopsy ) . Data collect variety source , include survey , electronic medical record , medical functional test , staff report . Data enter double-verified password-protected spreadsheet sand database store behind firewall . Any electronic medical record data capture use secure data transfer HIPAA-compliant protocol approve University Oregon IRB . Staff report forward directly project data manager . All personal data identify number rather names . Interim report project result make Data Safety Monitoring Board . Power analyse indicated sample size 80 subject would sufficient detect anticipated effect primary outcome : operative leg quadriceps volume ( MRI ) , non-operative leg quadriceps volume ( MRI ) , isometric strength , Get Up And Go test , stair climb test , stair climb test , six-minute walk test . The mean effect size across outcome , base baseline- 6-week percent change pilot data ) = 1.01 , reflect large effect . For sample size 30/group , study detect ESs &gt; .79 85 % power , minimally detectable ES drop 0.68 0.52 pretest covariates r = .50 .75 . Every effort make reduce attrition obtain data participant assessment point . However , attrition expect . Because study power detect anticipate physiological functional effect 30 subject per condition , enroll 80 total subject ( 40/condition ) account possible attrition . The EAA intervention design attenuate muscle loss , improve functional outcome , enhance quality life . Data analyse focus shorter-term , longer-term result , change time . Preliminary analysis employ descriptive statistic understand nature data ensure data distribution appropriate statistical test employ . Chi-square test analyse variance , appropriate , conducted evaluate equivalence continue participant vs. dropout demographic , medical history , recent level dependent variable . We conduct random coefficient analysis ( RCA ) model muscle functional mobility across time , well covariates could affect outcome , age , sex , physical activity , dietary intake . RCA model trajectories assessment nest within subject ; test condition represent interaction time factor treatment condition . The RCA avoids many pitfall associate traditional repeated measure ANOVA : It adjust within-individual dependence autocorrelation data , model nonlinear growth , require fix space among assessment , accommodate miss value time . By use available data across time , RCA limit effect miss data , reduce bias increase power . Based preliminary data , estimate able collect &gt; 92 % data point . Expected study outcomes follow : 1 . With successful completion research , expect demonstrate EAA prevents muscle atrophy bilaterally , preliminary data suggest . To date , know EAA prevent atrophy . 2 . We expect show atrophy prevention lead strength gain accelerate return functional mobility . We expect show EAA may positive effect central activation deficit , preliminary data suggest strength increase 6 wks EAA . To date , know preserve muscle follow TKA increase strength augment return functional mobility . 3 . We expect document EAA increase muscle cell size ( CSA ) bilaterally , vastus lateralis operative non-operative quadriceps . It known atrophy prevention early return functional mobility stimulate positive gain muscle cell structure . 4 . We expect demonstrate EAA increase mitochondrial mass bilaterally increase mitochondrial respiration rest . By sample non-operative ( control leg ) operative leg , expect show EAA normalize mitochondrial function time ( 6 mo and/or 1 yr post-TKA ) . It know early gain functional mobility positively impact muscle cell function . 5 . We expect show quality life ( measured instrument VR-12 ) significantly increase EAA . It known extent positive gain longer-term ( 6 mo 1 yr ) quality life . We expect stimulate transformative . EAA supplement inexpensive ( $ 800/patient $ 16/day ) , well tolerate , implement immediately .</detailed_description>
