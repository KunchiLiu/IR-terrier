	<brief_title>Chemoradiation Bladder Preservation After Complete Response Neoadjuvant Chemotherapy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>1 . Transurethral Resection Bladder Tumor ( TURBT ) Cystoscopy perform participate urologist : - cystoscopic evaluation - bimanual examination anesthesia , - thorough possible transurethral resection ( TUR ) bladder tumor , - biopsy prostatic urethra include mucosa stroma use resection loop . 2 . Neoadjuvant Chemotherapy , per standard care : All patient receive neoadjuvant course chemotherapy . The recommended neoadjuvant chemotherapy regimen consist Gemcitabine Cisplatin give 21-day cycle.This regimen begin within 8 week follow TURBT cystoscopic evaluation urologic surgeon ; 3 . Post-Neoadjuvant Evaluation : This evaluation take place ≤ 6 week follow completion neoadjuvant chemotherapy . Evaluation include : - urine cytology , - cystoscopy , - tumor site transurethral biopsy , - bimanual examination biopsy - biopsy TURBT site 4 . For subject complete response neoadjuvant chemotherapy : Chemoradiation within 6 week post-neoadjuvant evaluation . Intensity Modulated Radiation Therapy ( IMRT/VMAT ) , concurrent Cisplation therapy , per standard care ; OR 5 . For subject pT1 bad tumor response neoadjuvant chemotherapy : Radical Cystectomy within 12 week post-neoadjuvant evaluation ; 6 . Post-Consolidation Endoscopic Evaluations : The first post-treatment evaluation 30 day +/- 14 day within end chemoradiation , surgery progression . Subsequent cystoscopic evaluation every three month first year , every four month second year , every six month third year ( evaluation occur +/- 14 day ) . Each evaluation include serum , plasma , whole blood , urine cytology .</detailed_description>
