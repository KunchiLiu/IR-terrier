	<brief_summary>Women PCOS suffer excess male hormone ( androgen ) production ovary . Androgen make cell surround follicle contain egg . As follicle ( egg ) grow mature , androgen produce cell . Women PCOS follicles normal woman therefore androgen produce cell . While androgen production associate number follicle , relationship individual size follicle PCOS normal woman . This study intend determine whether size number ovarian follicle correlate androgen production PCOS normal woman .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Ovarian Morphology Theca Cell Androgen Production Women With Polycystic Ovary Syndrome ( PCOS )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>In woman polycystic ovary syndrome ( PCOS ) , major abnormality excessive ovarian androgen production mark increase serum testosterone ( T ) androstenedione ( A ) level . Studies determine alteration ovarian steroidogenesis lead abnormal production ovarian androgens reveal increased CYP17 gene expression accentuate 17-hydroxylase activity lead exaggerated 17-hydroxyprogesterone ( 17P ) response LH stimulation . In contrast , T A responses distinguish PCOS normal woman , although androgen clearly great former compare latter group . As result , 17P responsiveness employ determine functional capacity ovary produce androgen . Stimulatory agent include GnRH agonist , Lupron , dose 10 microgram per kilogram , hCG dose 10,000 IU . The investigator recently show hCG administer intravenously dose-response fashion reveal gradual increase 17P non-dose dependent increase serum T A . The pattern steroid hormone production reveal predominant pathway androgen generate woman PCOS . Extending study , investigator select mid-maximal dose hCG stimulate ovarian androgen include morphometric measure ovary , ovarian follicle number ( determine ultrasound ) relate hormone , anti-mullerian hormone inhibin B , product ovarian follicle . The result show increased androgen 17P response PCOS woman associate increased antral follicle number great AMH level compare normal woman . Inhibin B level similar group . Based response observe normal woman , PCOS woman divide two group . Those 17P response exceed normal mean plus 2 standard deviation ( normal responder PCOS ; NR-PCOS ) exceed normal response ( high responder PCOS ; HR-PCOS ) . This separation occur rate 50 % . Notably , serum AMH level 2-fold high NR-PCOS compare HR-PCOS . This find puzzle serum AMH level show correlate number small follicle present ovary suggest AMH may surrogate small follicle number . However , PCOS subgroups equivalent follicle number . The investigator hypothesize NR-PCOS great number small follicle compare HR-PCOS . To address issue investigator propose assess number small follicle NR- HR-PCOS woman normal control . In secondary consideration HR-PCOS group heavy NR-PCOS . This imply HR-PCOS woman may great insulin resistance hyperinsulinemia may contribute significantly high 17P response hCG . As result , investigator also perform oral glucose tolerance test subject . Power Analysis Results investigator ' pilot study show approximately 50 % PCOS woman exhibit 17OHP response hCG stimulation similar normal woman . Consequently , sample size 20 subject group 80 % power detect difference mean 0.820 ng/ml ( difference average 17OHP expression level high responder PCOS woman ( HR-PCOS ) , 2.840 ng/ml , normal responder PCOS ( NR-PCOS ) woman , 2.02 ng/ml ) , 33 % increase . In proposed study , investigator believe HR-PCOS ( n=20 ) show significantly great ( 33 % ) 17OHP production response hCG stimulation NR-PCOS ( n=20 ) power 0.8 type I error rate 0.05 . The investigator recruit 25 subject group allow subject drop . A secondary analysis perform woman PCOS normal control ( n=20 ) .</detailed_description>
