	<brief_summary>The primary objective study identify optimal method fascial closure laparotomy incision high risk patient intra-abdominal complication . The investigator hypothesize interrupted closure associate decreased complication rate compare running/continuous closure . Secondary objective determine rate dehiscence continuous interrupted suture technique , determine rate wound infection , hernia formation , mortality associate suture technique .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Optimal Method Fascial Closure High Risk Patients Undergoing Laparotomy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Secure wound closure essential requirement uncomplicated expedient recovery abdominal operation . The incidence dehiscence range 0-6 % different patient series associate mortality rate range 10-35 % [ 1 ] . Median laparotomy common technique abdominal incision simple , provide adequate exposure , rapid open usually blood spar [ 2 ] . The two common method fascial closure continuous interrupt absorbable non-absorbable suture . There little debate significant difference two type suture material . However , ongoing debate concern optimal technique closure . Both closure technique consider standard care time . The best method wound closure would one provide adequate tensile strength incision wound heal , approximates tissue way normal heal mechanisms occur optimal circumstance , remain secure even presence local systemic infection , suture material well tolerate short long term basis , , finally , do expediency . Previous randomize controlled trial abdominal fascial closure fail determine best technique ideal suture [ 3 ] . Fagniez et al . randomized 3135 patient receive continuous interrupted suture stratify accord type wound : clean , clean-contaminated , contaminate . This study look patient , elective emergent , statistically significant difference wind dehiscence continuous interrupted suture technique [ 4 ] . A similar conclusion wound dehiscence show Gislason et al . compare 599 adult major GI operation receive continuous interrupted suture [ 5 ] . In another prospective randomize trial , 571 patient compare continuous vs. interrupted suture ; dehiscence rate significant two group [ 1 ] . The common denominator trial inclusion patient , elective well emergent , undergo laparotomy . None trial compare suture technique patient require emergency laparotomy wind dehiscence primary outcome . Results study often conflict leave many surgeon uncertain ideal technique abdominal fascial closure , leave alone patient undergo emergency surgery . There prospective randomized trial look optimal method fascial closure high risk patient undergo laparotomy . Through research study , investigator aim determine identify optimal method fascial closure ( interrupt vs. running/continuous suture ) laparotomy incision high risk patient intra-abdominal complication</detailed_description>
