	<brief_summary>Various preclinical animal study show potential stem cell re-vascularising ischemic limb promote collateral vessel formation . SVF potential facilitate formation new blood vessel skeletal muscle . Early pilot clinical study indicate stem-cell transplantation feasible may beneficial effect CLI . Injury inflammation prerequisite participation circulate stem cell home differentiate microenvironment . The increased vascular permeability expression adhesion protein like integrin assist stem cell home . The migratory capacity stem cell dependent natural growth factor vascular endothelial growth factor ( VEGF ) , Stromal cell derive factor ( SDFI ) stem cell factor ( SCF ) . The expression VEGF , SDFI SCF highly unregulated hypoxic muscular tissue responsible recruitment stem cell assist repair mechanism consequent improvement limb function . In addition regenerate potential SVF , several advantage ; easily isolate without culture . Most importantly SVF show significantly high expression pluripotent marker similar human embryonic stem cell yet non-tumorogenic safe . MSCs angiogenic activity hence may excellent source develop neo-vasculature hence could explore therapeutic potential treat Critical Limb Ischemia . MSC 's also display membrane-bound insoluble secrete molecule involve cell attachment neighbour cell extra cellular matrix19 Adipose derive Stromal vascular fraction Mesenchymal Stem Cells find preclinical study safe effective . The current Phase I/II study adipose derive stromal vascular fraction Mesenchymal stem cell conduct broad objective establish safety efficacy .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Adipose Derived Stromal Vascular Fraction ( ADSVF ) Stromal Vascular Fraction ( SVF ) obtain tumescent liposuction . The SVF contain variety cell pre-adipocytes , endothelial cell , smooth muscle cell , pericytes , fibroblast , adult stem cell ( ASCs ) . In addition , SVF also contain blood cell capillary supply fat cell . These include erythrocyte red blood cell , B T cell , macrophage , monocyte , mast cell , natural killer ( NK ) cell , hematopoietic stem cell endothelial progenitor cell , name . It also contain growth factor transform growth factor beta ( TGF-β ) , platelet-derived growth factor ( PDGF ) , fibroblast growth factor ( FGF ) , among others . This consistent secretion cell presence extracellular matrix . The SVF also contain various protein present adipose tissue extracellular matrix laminin interest due ability help neural regeneration.Entire procedure SVF preparation isolation SVF cell carry cGMP compliance clean room . Pure stromal vascular fraction tune 99 % isolated clinical trial eliminate unnecessary cell RBC leukocytes . Adipose Derived Mesenchymal Stem Cells ( ADMSC ) Human mesenchymal stem cell ( MSCs ) present rare population cell adipose tissue almost 30-40 % nucleated cell , rapidly grow culture without lose stemness . MSCs expand vitro ≥ 2 million -fold retain ability differentiate several mesenchymal lineage . MSCs several characteristic Ease isolation , High expansion potential , Genetic stability , Reproducible attribute isolate isolate , Reproducible characteristic , Compatibility tissue engineering principle , Potential enhance repair many vital tissue , Uniform dose Better quality control release criterion . Beside autologous use MSC also use allogenic therapy . Several study use allo-MSC vivo experience suggest allo-MSCs reject many positive effect engraftment.MSC 's isolated various tissue , culture ex vivo , expand many fold.18 Cultured-expanded MSC 's appear represent homogeneous population flow cytometric measure cell-surface marker . These cell retain ability undergo vitro differentiation osteogenic , adipogenic chondrogenic lineage , even clonally expanded.19 Human adipose tissue derive MSCs capable differentiate endothelial cell vitro later form capillary-like structure semisolid medium suggest differentiation potential MSCs restrict mesodermal lineage also transdifferentiation MSCs lineage like endothelial could realize vitro vivo8 MSCs know give rise limb-bud mesoderm ( osteoblast , chondrocytes , adipocytes , stroma cell , skeletal myoblasts ) also differentiate cell visceral mesoderm ( endothelial cell ) .9 MSCs facilitate vasculogenesis increase vascular endothelial growth factor ( VEGF ) level . After MSCs intramyocardially inject infarct zone , local VEGF level rise , vascular density regional blood flow increase , contractility improves . MSCs anti-fibrotic activity hence may excellent source tackle pulmonary fibrosis hence could explore therapeutic potential treating Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis . MSC 's also display membrane-bound insoluble secrete molecule involve cell attachment neighbor cell extra cellular matrix.18 This cell surface configuration may enable mesenchymal stem cell home bloodstream mesenchymal tissue .</detailed_description>
