	<brief_title>Efficacy Fentanyl Reduce Time Severe Postoperative Pain Relief Compared Morphine</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Postoperative pain severe problem high incidence worldwide . According systematic review literature Dolin et al , incidence moderate severe postoperative pain 41 % patient find , , 23 % experienced relief ( 1 ) . International Association Study Pain defines pain unpleasant sensory emotional experience associate actual potential damage , describe term damage ( 3 ) . The postoperative pain important cause suffer unpleasant experience patient , also involve harmful effect body ( 4 ) . Thus , secondary stress pain trigger release series hormonal mediator activation sympathetic nervous system conjunction surgical trauma previous comorbidities patient , cause dysfunction multiple organ system , include cardiovascular ( 5 , 6 ) , GI ( 7-10 ) respiratory ( 11,12 ) , among others , increase incidence postoperative complication myocardial ischemia , atelectasis ( 25-75 % abdominal surgery ) , respiratory infection ( pneumonia 1-3 % cardiac surgery ) , ileus , deep vein thrombosis cognitive dysfunction . Thus increase morbidity patient recovery delay . ( 5 ) Similarly observe postoperative pain increase stay post anesthesia care unit , readmission pain management , delay rehabilitation reintegration patient activity daily live , consequent increase cost ( 5 ) . Considering argument , obvious timely intervention generates profit problem multiple level . While management postoperative pain include issue range education patient prior analgesic plan late recovery period post-anesthesia care area crucial . This show poor control postoperative pain ( 3 ) early hour associate high level pain 48 hour . There grow interest question , despite availability different drug technological advance allow well understand pathophysiology pain , achieve great impact incidence problem ( 13 ) . Opioids important drug postoperative pain control . In post-anesthesia care area , especially face patient severe unbearable pain ( 14,15 ) , analgesic opioid titration effective strategy control postoperative pain ( 16 ) . The study use today opioid morphine , pharmacokinetic characteristic provide important balance speed onset maintenance analgesia ( 17 ) . However , alternative analgesic titration , fentanyl , favorable pharmacokinetics faster response thus may shorten time need decrease pain severe mild ( 14,15 ) . There comparative study fixed-dose fentanyl morphine emergency service preliminary test recovery area ( 18,19 ) . The recent analgesic titration trial compare appropriate dos opioids patient weight would improve efficacy safety ( 20 ) . The test know used fentanyl morphine compare fixed-dose 10 minute interval . Fentanyl potent opioid , theoretically 100 time potent morphine severe acute postoperative pain act faster congener ( morphine ) pain relief . In literature study corroborate theoretical assumption proposes compare few adverse effect . This drug produce effect similar report morphine less magnitude advantage postoperative period respiratory depression , antitussive effect , gastrointestinal discomfort physical dependence manifest significantly less degree . Trying solve management postoperative pain relief , objective determine control clinical trial superiority adult patient undergoing surgery , fentanyl reduces faster qualification time severe pain mild pain postanesthesia care unit compare morphine .</detailed_description>
