	<brief_summary>Due unexpectedly high number infant death whoop cough 2012 , Department Health act protect newborn birth completion primary immunisation , period great risk disease . Vaccination pregnant woman whoop cough vaccine third trimester pregnancy instigate nationally , antibody produce Mum would cross placenta unborn child , give passive protection vulnerable time . This antibody transfer known time compare two whooping cough vaccine use pregnancy . Any effect raise antibody might infant response vaccine give first month life also measure . This particularly important infant immunisation include component whooping cough vaccine , include diphtheria , tetanus polio . Previous study show high level antibody prior vaccination may affect subsequent antibody response . It therefore important ass whether administration whoop cough vaccine pregnancy adversely affect protection afford infant vaccine , particularly similar , namely tetanus diphtheria well meningitis C Hib vaccine include diptheria tetanus component structure . This study ass immune response mother baby ( ~200 pair ) vaccination allow comparison two whooping cough vaccine use pregnancy . This do take small amount blood , way measure antibody level ( proxy immune response ) , vaccination . A group unvaccinated woman baby ( 50 pair ) also recruit allow comparison immune response .</brief_summary>
