	<brief_summary>This pilot clinical trial study whether level certain gene tissue blood relate well patient stage IV non-small cell lung cancer respond chemotherapy . Genes may affect sensitive resistant tumor chemotherapy . Studying level gene relate tumor response chemotherapy may help doctor learn whether predict well patient respond treatment .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Gene Expression Levels Predicting Treatment Response Patients With Stage IV Non-small Cell Lung Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To describe association baseline gene expression level protein messenger ribonucleic acid ( mRNA ) level best treatment response two cycle single-agent multi-agent chemotherapy SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . To describe change protein mRNA level ribonucleotide reductase M1 ( RRM1 ) , thymidylate synthetase ( TS ) , excision repair cross-complementing rodent repair deficiency , complementation group 1 ( ERCC1 ) serial biopsy obtain patient treated gemcitabine ( gemcitabine hydrochloride ) , pemetrexed ( pemetrexed disodium ) , platinum . II . To describe association change marker level change tumor diameter . TERTIARY OBJECTIVES : I . To explore relationship marker level circulate tumor cell solid tumor specimen . II . To explore relationship marker level viable peripheral blood mononuclear cell ( PBMCs ) , circulate tumor cell , tumor specimen . III . Should sufficient amount number tumor specimen remain analysis , use ass gene implicate non-small cell lung cancer ( NSCLC ) outcome response treatment might useful prognostic predictive marker patient outcome . OUTLINE : Patients receive 1 3 chemotherapy regimen discretion primary oncologist , include docetaxel intravenously ( IV ) day 1 , pemetrexed disodium IV day 1 , gemcitabine hydrochloride IV day 1 8 . Treatment repeat every 3 week 2 course absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . After course 2 , patient may continue treatment off-study discretion treat physician . After completion study treatment , patient follow 12 month .</detailed_description>
