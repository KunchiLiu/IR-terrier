	<brief_summary>Postoperative bleeding common consequence heart surgery significantly impact outcome cost [ Wynne R , Christensen MC , Dixon B ] . When bleed occurs , reliable postoperative blood evacuation pleural , mediastinal pericardial space chest tube imperative facilitate pulmonary reexpansion mediastinal decompression patient recovers . When post operative blood evacuation inadequate , retain blood complication result ( herein describe Retained Blood Complications ( RBC ) . RBC presence post-operative pericardial and/or pleural fluid blood diagnose may necessitate drainage acute subacute setting . The need treatment intervention condition represent impediment patient recovery involve resource economic consumption heart program healthcare system large . Clinically , Retained Blood Complications ( RBC ) recognize acutely subacutely . When present acutely , usually fresh thrombus around heart lung present tamponade hemothorax . When present subacutely , result bloody pleural pericardial effusion [ Light RW , Light RW , Light RW , Ikaheimo MJ ] . These effusion often drive breakdown remain thrombus . Once RBC occurs , subsequent procedure may need remedy . A recent review literature indicate additional procedure RBC demonstrate approximately 15 % 20 % patient heart surgery . In prospectively collect United States Nationwide Inpatient Sample ( NIS ) data 2010 , RBC could demonstrate 17 % patient . In analysis , mortality double 4 % 8 % , length stay increase 5 day , average cost 55 % high . Patients RBC , therefore , represent increase risk population complication cost . Postoperative obstruction conventional chest tube blood fibrinous material set postoperative bleeding contributes RBC . ( Shalli ) In recent study postoperative cardiac surgery patient Cleveland Clinic , 36 % patient find evidence chest tube obstruction [ Karimov JH ] . Active Clearance PleuraFlow show prevent chest tube clogging , reduce RBC . ( Shiose , Arakawa , Perrault ) The purpose registry evaluate effectiveness PleuraFlow System , commercial Class II ( US ) , Class IIb ( Canada , Europe , Australia ) , management blood evacuation cardiac surgery . Additionally , purpose educate incidence complication post-surgical intervention consistent Retained Blood Complications ( RBC ) adult cardiac surgery . The purpose registry also collect post-market surveillance data PleuraFlow ACT .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>This prospective multicenter observational registry retrospective component . The registry two track . One track -- ALL-ACT -- sit enrol consecutive cohort cardiac surgery patient ( Track A ) . The second track -- VAD-ACT -- site enrol patient post ventricular assist device ( VAD ) surgery ( Track B ) . There two condition participation registry : First , sit require enter registry database anonymized matched historical data element cohort cardiac surgery patient do precede 12 24-month period ( Phase 0 ) . These retrospective data element use baseline information purpose comparative analysis prospective data set collect prospective enrollment phase . Second , sit required participate roll-in phase ( Phase 1 ) . The purpose roll-in phase allow user participate site familiarize product use ACT . To implement clinical use protocol provide ClearFlow , Inc. commercial user part product training , ; demonstrate consistency compliance clinical use protocol . Phase 0 phase 1 execute parallel . Participating site may start prospective enrollment ( Phase 2 ) completion phase 0 1 . Investigators shall report PleuraFlow-related serious injury Sponsor soon become aware injury later 48 hour . Investigators shall report death Sponsor Regulatory authority compliance applicable State , Country condition impose review Ethical Committee .
