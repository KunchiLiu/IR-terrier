	<brief_summary>The purpose study evaluate overall response rate ( ORR ) ( complete response [ CR ] rate plus partial response [ PR ] rate ) ibrutinib ( IMBRUVICAâ„¢ ; PCI-32765 ; JNJ-54179060 ) , assess Independent Review Committee ( IRC ) , participant relapse refractory mantle cell lymphoma ( MCL-a cancer lymph node tissue ) .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>This Phase 2 , single-arm , open-label ( know intervention study ) , multicenter ( 1 hospital medical school team work medical research study ) study explore efficacy , safety pharmacokinetics ( study way drug enters leave blood tissue time ) ibrutinib Japanese participant relapse ( return medical problem ) refractory ( respond treatment ) MCL . The study consist Screening Phase 30 day prior first dose study drug follow treatment Phase post-treatment follow-up Phase . Participants receive ibrutinib 560 milligram ( mg ) orally , daily 28-day cycle disease progression ( relapse participant achieve CR ) , unacceptable toxicity , study end , whichever occur first . Treatment Phase disease assessment every 8 week 24 week start study drug , every 12 week thereafter assess efficacy 2 year last participant enrol . Efficacy primarily evaluate ORR . Participants ' safety monitor throughout study .</detailed_description>
