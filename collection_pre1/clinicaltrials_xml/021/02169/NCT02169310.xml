	<brief_summary>Background : - People traumatic brain injury ( TBI ) trouble make best possible decision . Researchers want learn part brain control decision make . They also want know different people . This may help predict people make decision TBI . Objective : - To learn part brain involve make decision decision may hurt TBI . Eligibility : - Adults age 18 60 . Design : - Participants screen medical history physical exam . They also take memory , attention , concentration , think test . - Participants 2 experiment . - For Experiment 1 , participant may 3 scan : - PET : chemical inject thin tube arm vein . Participants lie bed slide scanner . - MRI : strong magnetic field radio wave take picture brain . Participants lie table slide metal cylinder . It make loud knock noise . Participants get earplug . They might ask task . A coil place head . - MEG : cone magnetic field detector lower onto participant head . - After scan , participant perform decision-making task . - For Experiment 2 , participant perform decision-making task receive transcranial direct current stimulation ( tDCS ) . - tDCS : wet electrode sponge place participant scalp forehead . A current pass electrode . It stimulate brain . - Participants return 24-48 hour later repeat decision-making task .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Objectives Deficits decision-making commonly find individual traumatic brain injury ( TBI ) severe negative impact quality life . Converging evidence animal model human study suggest decision-making deficit link abnormal mesocorticolimbic network structure function , could potentially mitigate intervention improve function within neuronal circuit . The objective protocol : ( 1 ) quantify difference performance decision-making task TBI patient healthy volunteer ; ( 2 ) determine whether baseline feature mesocorticolimbic network structure function predict subsequent decision-making performance TBI patient healthy volunteer ; ( 3 ) determine facilitatory transcranial direct current stimulation ( tDCS ) apply dorsolateral prefrontal cortex ( dlPFC ) , mesocorticolimbic network region crucially involved decision-making , improve decision-making TBI . Study Population Up 40 healthy adult volunteer 40 TBI patient recruit protocol participate two experiment . Design We plan accomplish two objective list within two experiment . Experiment 1 examines performance difference TBI patient healthy volunteer decision-making task , explore whether baseline feature mesocorticolimbic network structure function predict subsequent decision-making performance TBI patient healthy volunteer . Experiment 2 , proof-of-principle study , use sham-controlled , double-blind experimental design examine whether facilitatory tDCS , non-invasive intervention use recently augment range cognitive function , enhance decision-making performance cohort TBI patient healthy volunteer . Outcome Measures The primary outcome measure Experiment 1 2 performance computerize decision-making task . Secondary outcome measure include quantitative estimate structural functional mesocorticolimbic network feature , include MRI-based structural functional connectivity , MEG-based functional dynamic , baseline dlPFC GABA concentration measure magnetic resonance spectroscopy ( MRS ) imaging , dopamine D2 receptor bind potential within mesocorticolimbic subcortical nucleus measure [ 11C ] raclopride PET ( Experiment 1 ) . Multimodal data fusion modeling use explore predictive relationship baseline mesocorticolimbic network state decision-making task performance within unified state-space framework ( Experiment 1 ) , well ability network state predict inter-individual difference effect tDCS decision-making task performance ( Experiment 2 ) .</detailed_description>
