	<brief_summary>The incidence coronary heart disease ( CHD ) significant super-obese diabetic . Inflammation believe play important part development CHD , large collection abdominal fat obese person vast source inflammation . Diabetics abnormal glucose cholesterol metabolism ultimately compromise body ' circulatory system nerve function . Cholesterol play vital role CHD . Low-density lipoprotein ( LDL ) particles carry cholesterol deposit blood vessel wall become damaged result . When LDL particles undergo change chemically ( call oxidation ) result high circulating blood glucose ( call glycation ) , become harmful body . High-density lipoprotein ( HDL ) particles protective function CHD . Not transport cholesterol away blood vessel liver broken , property oxidation inflammation . These property relate activity enzyme HDL call paraoxonase 1 ( PON1 ) . Super-obese patient increasingly treat weight-reducing surgery ( bariatric surgery ) . In study examine whether weight loss follow bariatric surgery result reduce inflammatory state , improve HDL function ( high PON1 activity ) , good control blood glucose less nerve damage . We study PON1 activity , inflammation glucose control patient type 1 diabetes ( without kidney damage ) type 2 diabetes . We also study effect rapidly rise blood glucose level PON1 glycated LDL patient undergo oral glucose tolerance test .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>High-density lipoprotein ( HDL ) know protective role cardiovascular disease . Apart transport cholesterol peripheral blood vessel back liver process , HDL ability inhibit chemical change ( call oxidation ) low-density lipoprotein ( LDL ) would make latter toxic body . HDL also stop inflammatory particle damage vessel wall . The anti-oxidation anti-inflammatory property HDL associate enzyme HDL call paraoxonase 1 ( PON1 ) . It level measure HDL level PON1 activity important preventing cardiovascular disease . PON1 activity determine quality HDL effect vascular disease . Obese patient accumulate fat within abdomen ( termed visceral fat ) . It known visceral fat produce large quantity inflammatory particle obese patient increase systemic inflammation thus high risk vascular disease . The impact heighten inflammatory status HDL function PON1 activity know . Weight-reducing ( bariatric ) surgery result significant weight loss obese patient . It unclear whether weight loss associate improvement HDL function , possible reversal lipoprotein abnormalities physiological parameter . We plan study population obese patient schedule bariatric surgery surgery compare result match population healthy control patient . Diabetic patient increase risk develop cardiovascular disease . HDL diabetic patient often dysfunctional . Even though HDL level normal , PON1 activity may reduce . LDL able interact raise level blood glucose ( call glycation ) become harmful body . Glycation lipoproteins associate PON1 may affect PON1 activity . We plan study glycated lipoprotein PON1 activity population diabetic patient either type 1 type 2 diabetes . Some type 1 diabetic diabetic kidney disease , patient know particularly high risk cardiovascular complication . We also plan recruit cohort patient diabetes abnormal blood glucose test . These patient oral glucose tolerance test ( OGTT ) establish whether diabetes . During OGTT , patient give oral glucose load result rapid rise blood glucose . We see accelerated change blood glucose level effect glycation lipoprotein .</detailed_description>
	<criteria>Patients Type 1 diabetes receive lipidlowering drug , omega fatty acid supplement thiazolidinediones without clinical and/or ECG evidence CHD . Type 2 diabetic patient receive omega fatty acid supplement thiazolidinediones without clinical and/or ECG evidence CHD . Patients impaired fast glucose undergoing oral glucose tolerance test . Patients schedule bariatric surgery . Healthy control major acute chronic illness , receive regular medication take omega fatty acid supplement , clinically overt ischaemic heart disease . Subjects ( male female ) age 20 75 . Subjects capacity understanding informed consent process . Type 1 diabetic use lipid lower therapy , thiazolidinediones , omega fatty acid supplement . History and/or ECG evidence ST segment change indicative CHD . Type 2 diabetic receive thiazolidinediones , omega fatty acid supplement . History and/or ECG evidence ST segment change indicative CHD . Healthy control history CHD , vascular insufficiency , diabetes . Use lipidlowering drug omega fatty acid supplement .</criteria>
