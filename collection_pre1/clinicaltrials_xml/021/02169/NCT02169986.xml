The change EASI score patient study difference amount moisturizer use per body surface area secondary outcome . The number time calendar label mark reflect adherence treatment . Other data severity eczema , amount moisturizer use collect . The height , weight , severity eczema use steroid/calcineurin inhibitor provide additional information could use indirectly measure adherence . Regarding data analysis : Mean difference experimental control group adherence EASI score analyze use Student 's t-test independent group . Possible difference treatment compliance baseline post-implementation within group explore use Student 's dependent t-test pair sample . This pilot study 's sample size sufficient plan analysis , help determine effect size power need conduct large study topic . Univariate descriptive statistic report variable .</detailed_description>
