	<brief_summary>Urticaria frequent skin condition characterize transient wheal flare type skin reaction associate severe pruritus . In Europe alone , 5 million patient thought suffer persist urticaria symptom , either occur spontaneously , i.e . chronic spontaneous urticaria ( CSU ) , result environmental physical stimulus friction , pressure , UV irradiation cold ( physical urticaria ) . Urticaria factitia ( also know dermographic urticaria symptomatic dermographism ) characterize whealing itch follow minor stroking pressure , rub scratch skin . The majority patient urticaria factitia benefit treatment nonsedating antihistamine . Some patient , however , achieve adequate symptom control even updosing antihistamine may suffer substantial quality life impairment . Since even minor stroke skin lead development wheal severe itching , patient example limited choice clothing impaired social interaction partnership . In patient history wheal stroke skin , provocation test perform . This do stroking skin lightly smooth blunt object ( e.g . tip close ball point pen wooden spatula ) purpose-built instrument , know dermographometer . For diagnosis symptomatic dermographism , smooth blunt object hold perpendicular skin use apply light stroke pressure skin upper back volar forearm . The reaction consider positive patient show weal response report pruritus site provocation . Patients positive test reaction evaluate individual pressure threshold . For purpose provocation device ( FricTest ) develop allows reproducible standardized threshold testing . Threshold test enables physician assess disease severity treatment response precisely .</brief_summary>
