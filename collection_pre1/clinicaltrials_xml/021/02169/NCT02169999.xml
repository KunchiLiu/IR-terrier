	<brief_title>Personalized Decision Support Older Patients With Diabetes</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>In 2003 , first geriatric diabetes care guideline publish encouraged old patient provider consider less intensive glucose control goal ( HbA1C &lt; 8 % ) among frail , old patient limited life expectancy , continue pursue intensive glucose control ( HbA1C &lt; 7 % ) among relatively healthy old patient . The guideline also emphasize importance cardiovascular prevention , encourage routine screening geriatric syndrome influence treatment decision ( i.e. , polypharmacy fall ) , advise provider acknowledge patient ' preference make treatment decision . These guideline represent conceptual advance care old diabetes patient ; however , little effort implement evaluate recommendation practice set . This may partially due fact many recommendation difficult carry busy clinical practice without sophisticated decision support tool . Determining whether old patient benefit intensive glucose control complex cognitive task require simultaneous consideration multiple , sometimes contradictory , clinical criterion ( e.g . advanced duration diabetes limit life expectancy ) . Completing task accurately may possible computer simulation model . Along barrier implement care guideline , also consensus elicit patient preference set chronic disease management account view decision-making process . To overcome challenge , develop web-based Geriatric Diabetes Decision Aid ( GDDA ) combine decision analytic model diabetes complication late prognostic tool geriatrics . This personalized decision support tool encourage individualization diabetes care among old patient educate patient diabetes , deliver prognostic information provider , provide personalize data risk benefit diabetes care patient provider , elicit treatment preference patient . In proposed set study , develop GDDA input patient provider assess impact individual interview . The findings series study important establish feasibility use GDDA practice , provide estimate intervention 's effect process care power calculation future large scale randomize controlled trial . This pilot randomize control trial one first trial formally examine new care recommendation grow population old patient live diabetes .</detailed_description>
