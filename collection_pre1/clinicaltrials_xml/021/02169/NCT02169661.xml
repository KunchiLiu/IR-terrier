	<brief_title>Burger Beetroot Study - Lipid Oxidation Study</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Many lipid oxidation product malondialdehyde know genotoxic potentially detrimental health . Consequently aim study ass whether consumption `` ready meal '' rich certain fat lead post-prandial increase lipid oxidation product plasma whether ameliorated reformulating meal natural extract rich phytochemical potential antioxidant activity stomach . Diet design requirement : The basic `` ready meal '' turkey burger consist - 50 % fat - 20 % protein - 30 % carbohydrate . However , four experimental form burger . 1 . The fat unsaturated ( stripped corn oil ) 2 . The fat saturate ( lard ) 3 . The fat unsaturated diet also contain beetroot extract concentration 10g/100g . 4 . The fat saturate diet also contain beetroot extract concentration 10g/100g . Beetroot ( http : //www.kanegrade.com/powders.htm ) select burger reformulation Scottish product rich phytochemical potential antioxidant efficacy . An additional benefit may blood pressure lower effect . Initial taste test indicate acceptable palatability . All component burger formulate similar possible . Fatty acid profile `` basic eight '' use food label determine diet . Susceptibility diet oxidise assess use RANCIMAT . Ready Meal Intervention : This latin square format whereby volunteer consume 4 treatment separate occasion . This powerful design ass whether incorporation phytochemical Scottish product improve health benefit process food volunteer act his/her control . Volunteers randomly allocate four group - Treatment A High polyunsaturated ( PUFA ) ready meal ( ie . burger ) - Treatment B High saturate ( SFA ) fat ready meal - Treatment C High PUFA ready meal incorporate food extract - Treatment D High SFA ready meal incorporate food extract There washout period least 7 day treatment . Volunteers : Healthy volunteer age 21 60 year recruit attend HNU fast 22.00h previous even four test day . On arrival , ask provide urine sample . The volunteer cannula insert trained nurse initial baseline blood sample take ( volume 10 ml ) . The subject ask consume assign breakfast within 15 minute period . Water provide . Volunteers request provide 10ml blood sample 1h , 2h , 4h 6h 24 hr . A 24 hr urine sample also obtain , start day test day . Blood pressure record time point . Volunteers include - Are take medicine prescribe GP - Have know allergy beetroot - Are vegetarian vegan - Regularly take nutritional supplement - Have give large blood donation last three month</detailed_description>
