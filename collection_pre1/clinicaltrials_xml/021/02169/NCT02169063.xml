	<brief_summary>This clinical trial study carbon-11 acetate fluorine F 18 sodium fluoride positron emission tomography ( PET ) biomarker treatment response patient prostate cancer respond treatment hormone spread part body . Carbon-11 acetate fluorine F 18 sodium fluoride radioactive drug may useful evaluate prostate cancer activity response treatment . Comparing result diagnostic procedure carbon-11 acetate fluorine F 18 sodium fluoride PET do therapy may help doctor predict patient 's response treatment help plan best treatment .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . Demonstrate carbon-11 acetate ( 11C-acetate ) 18F-fluoride ( fluorine F 18 sodium fluoride ) PET scan change result treatment men metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer comparison pre-treatment 6-12 week post-treatment image ( standardize uptake value [ SUV ] , influx constant [ Ki ] , rate constant [ K1 ] ) clinical response measure . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . Compare result 11C-acetate 18F-fluoride PET scan patient 's clinical bone scan determine predict clinical response well . II . Compare change 11C-acetate 18F-fluoride PET change prostate-specific antigen ( PSA ) level . III . Compare change 11C-acetate 18F-fluoride PET change urinary N-telopeptide bone alkaline phosphatase . IV . Determine either baseline uptake change uptake 11C-acetate and/or 18F-fluoride PET correlate progression-free survival Prostate Cancer Working Group 2 ( PCWG2 ) criterion ( Scher , 2008 ) . V. Determine either baseline uptake change uptake 11C-acetate and/or 18F-fluoride PET correlate skeletal-related event ( SREs ) define radiographic pathologic fracture , need radiation bone , need surgery , spinal cord compression malignant hypercalcemia . VI . Percentage patient experience adverse event Common Terminology Criteria Adverse Events , version 4.0 . VII . For patient tissue/blood biomarkers obtain indication , directly compare baseline uptake change uptake 11C-acetate and/or 18F-fluoride PET biomarkers . OUTLINE : Patients receive carbon-11 acetate intravenously ( IV ) fluorine F 18 sodium fluoride IV 1 minute undergo PET baseline 6-12 week systemic therapy start . After completion treatment , patient follow every 3 month 5 year .</detailed_description>
