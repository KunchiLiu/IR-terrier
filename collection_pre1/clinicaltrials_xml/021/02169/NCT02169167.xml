	<brief_summary>Prevalence diabetic foot ulcer report 15 % patient suffer diabetes ulceration present 84 % diabetes-related amputation . Peripheral neuropathy lead unperceived trauma seem major cause diabetic foot ulcer 45-60 % ulcer consider merely neuropathic 45 % mixed , neuropathic ischemic etiology . Ulceration low limb one common complication relate diabetes one major cause hospitalization diabetic patient . The significant contributor diabetic low limb ulceration neuropathy , deformity , uncontrolled elevate plantar pressure , poor glycemic status , peripheral vascular disease , male gender duration diabetes . Treatment low limb ulcer impose enormous burden health care resource worldwide , least 33 % expense spend treat diabetic ulcer manifest complication diabetes . Although least 170 topical wound care product available , evidence superiority one another tenuous , well-designed randomized , control trial rare , number case-control observational study limit . In recent year , salve prepared Norway spruce ( Picea abies ) resin successfully use medical context treat acute chronic wound ulcer various origin . The objective prospective , randomize control clinical trial investigate heal rate healing time neuropathic diabetic foot ulcer patient , suffer infect fore- mid-foot ulceration ( PEDIS-classification ≥ Grade II ; 19 ) originate Type I II diabetes , patient whose diabetic ulceration candidate topical treatment resin ( Study treatment ) octenidine ( Control treatment ) . In addition , factor contribute delayed healing ulceration , antimicrobial property , safety cost-effectiveness resin salve treatment control treatment analyze .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES Primary objective : - scrutinize complete heal neuropathic diabetic foot ulceration time . - analyze successful eradication rate pathogenic bacteria ulcer within study period document negative swab culture . - analyze rate ulcer 50 % decrease ulcer size disappear clinical sign infection time . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES Secondary objective : - ass potential contributor delay ulcer healing . - study safety compliance relate treatment method . - estimate overall cost ulcer treatment resin salve treatment octenidine treatment . INCLUSION AND EXCLUSION CRITERIA Inclusion criterion : - adult patient ( 18-80 year ) infect neuropathic foot ulceration due type I II diabetes . - PEDIS-classification ≥ Grade II . Exclusion criterion : - patient whose life expectancy le 6 month . - ulceration ischemic neuroischemic origin . - presence systemic inflammatory response sign . - heel ulceration . - presence osteomyelitis . - pregnancy . - know hypersensitivity ingredient include study control treatment product . - patient unable give inform consent . - patient advance malignant disease . METHODS Patient selection Altogether 40 adult patient ( 18 - 80 year ) suffering infected neuropathic fore- mid-foot ulceration originate type I II diabetes ( PEDIS-classification ≥ Grade II ) randomly allocate two group ( n = 20 patient / group ) receive either topical resin salve treatment topical octenidine treatment appropriate diabetic ulceration . The patient recruit current study , select physician , specialize treatment diabetes complication . Treatment commence followed-up outpatient clinic Diabetic Foot Clinic Regional Diabetic Centre , Department Hypertension Diabetology , Gdansk , Poland . Informed consent obtain patient . FOLLOW-UP Demographics , clinically relevant medical , follow-up data gather Clinical Report Form ( CRF ) responsible physician every patient begin study , within every visit Diabetic Foot Clinic Regional Diabetic Centre study end six month later , last . Thus , recruit patient visit Diabetic Foot Clinic : 1. begin study , 1 , 2 , 3 , 4 week time-points thereafter . After , consecutive visit every 3 4 week arrange end 6 month initiation . If patient 's clinical situation require frequent visit Diabetic Foot Clinic , arrange basis decision research physician . If ulcer heal take less 6 month , last follow-up information CRF fill ulcer consider fully heal ( primary objective achieve ) . If ulcer fully heal 6 month , treatment consider unsuccessful , follow-up discontinue ( primary objective achieve ) . Photographs take within every control visit outpatient department . Any notable improvement , deterioration , factor might contribute ulcer heal follow-up , e.g . mechanical / surgical ulcer revision , cleanse , antibiotic treatment register CRF : Thus , CRF include detail : - size ulcer [ width ( mm ) x length ( mm ) x depth ( mm ) ] . - sign infection . - swab culture . - plain x-ray . - erythrocyte sedimentation rate ( ESR ) . - C-reactive protein ( CRP ) . - full blood count . - photograph appropriate measure . - use antibiotic . - rate dressing change . - potential side-effects ( i.e . sign hypersensitivity allergic reaction ) . - use off-loading shoe , specific note observation treatment period . SAFETY ISSUES Hypersensitivity allergy resin control treatment take account , symptoms allergic reaction i.e . contact dermatitis appear , study discontinue particular patient .</detailed_description>
