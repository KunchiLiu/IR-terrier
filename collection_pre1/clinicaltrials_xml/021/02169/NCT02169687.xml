	<detailed_description>Hyperthyroidism define decrease thyrotropin ( TSH ) level associate elevate normal free T4 T3 ( subclinical hyperthyroidism ) . The frequent etiology old population toxic adenoma toxic multinodular goiter . Several study demonstrate hyperthyroid status associate increase cardiac arrhythmia ( atrial fibrillation ) increase cardiovascular mortality . Nevertheless , management patient present subclinical hyperthyroidism remain controversial . Surgery indicate case large toxic adenoma especially young patient . In European country , radioiodine treatment indicate old patient , especially present cardiothyreosis surgery contraindicate . Radioiodine simple , cost-effective , safe procedure treatment autonomously hyperfunctioning thyroid nodule . In prospective study [ Nygaard , 1999 ] , 45 % decrease total thyroid volume within 3 month radio-iodine treatment , 75 % patient previous anti-thyroid drug treatment normalize thyroid function within 3 month . In another recently publish prospective study [ Endorgan , 2004 ] , decrease hot nodule volume assess US 28.8 % 3 month , 46.2 % 6 month 54 % 12 month radioiodine treatment , 66.7 % patient euthyroid 3 month , 71.8 % 6 month , 76.9 % 12 month . The AACE guideline diagnosis management thyroid nodule [ Feld , 1996 ] recommend patient toxic autonomous thyroid nodule require treatment remind radioactive iodine treatment choice patient toxic nodule . Nevertheless , present time publish data demonstrate effectiveness radioiodine treatment prevention cardiac complication case subclinical hyperthyroidism . When radioiodine treatment propose , physicians must follow regulation policy 131I Europe US . The European Union recently adopt main international commission radiological protection ( ICRP ) recommendation radiation protection . Such regulation may raise number practical problem 131I treat patient . With exception country Germany Switzerland , often legislation define maximal dose radioiodine administer ambulatory basis . Policies recommendation propose reduce radiation hazard public family leave around radioiodine treat patient . Therefore , radioprotection recommendation , contraindication surgery radioiodine case , alternative treatment toxic nodular nodule , HIFU , may suggest . The aim study assess efficacy safety HIFU treatment autonomous hyperfunctioning thyroid nodule . The main objective study assess rate patient TSH normalization ( increase ) . US change treat nodule , especially nodule volume , evaluate .</detailed_description>
