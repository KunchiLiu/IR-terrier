	<brief_summary>The purpose pilot study evaluate effectiveness novel regional anesthesia technique develop investigator institution , part quality improvement initiative , assist multilevel thoracic pain control post-Nuss procedure patient . The investigator hypothesize local anesthetic infusion via bilateral multiperforated soaker catheter place extrathoracic sub-paraspinal muscle location ultrasound guidance would significantly improve pain control , reflect decrease pain intensity score , reduction opiate requirement improvement infunctional rehabilitation measure score patient underwent Nuss procedure pectus excavatum repair . However , goal pilot study detect statistically significant difference primary outcome control treatment group ( number study subject choose necessity could complete within specified time period ) , estimate parameter allow appropriate power sample size calculation future multi-institutional study .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>This study underwent initial peer review Biomedical Research Committee Nemours award internal funding Nemours Funding committee . Scientific progress review conduct annually basis subsequent year funding . Ten eligible patient recruit allocated one two group accord computer generate random allocation table : five patient allocated treatment group receive bilateral ultrasound-guided placement multi-perforated soaker catheter sub-paraspinal location intravenous PCA post-operatively ; five patient allocate control group two sham multi-perforated soaker catheter tap back receive intravenous PCA post-operatively . In treatment group , catheter position consider adequate live ultrasound imaging confirm placement directly rib surface lateral transverse process T2-T10 level . A 7.5 inch On-Qr multi-perforated catheter place via introducer patient 5 ' 7 '' ( 170.18 cm ) 10 '' ( 25.4 cm ) catheter place 5 ' 7 '' ( 170.18 cm ) . An infusion ropivacaine 0.2 % start immediately catheter placement via On-Q infusion system rate 0.25 mg/kg/hour per catheter ( maximum 8 ml/hr catheter [ maximum pump infusion rate ] ) . Maximum total ropivacaine infusion rate limit 0.5 mg/kg/hr avoid toxicity . The local anesthetic infusion stop post-operative day number 3 catheter remove . Catheters dress way conceal insertion sit therefore precluded pain observer determine group assignment pump appear infuse blinded viewer . The peri-operative anesthetic surgical approach standardize study . A single anesthesiologist surgeon responsible recruitment , anesthesia provision , surgical technique , multi-perforated soaker catheter insertion . Post-operative pain management carry group blind anesthesiologist accord post-operative protocol . Three recovery room nurse , six floor nurse three physical therapist select limit inter observer variability educate post-operative expectation consistent use pain functional independent measure ( FIM ) score patient population . With exception primary investigator , personnel blind patient 's group assignment . The outcome evaluate base total amount narcotic per kilogram require , pain score functional performance measure derive physical therapist .</detailed_description>
