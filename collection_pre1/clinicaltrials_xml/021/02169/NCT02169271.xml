	<brief_summary>This randomized phase II trial study acetylsalicylic acid compare placebo treat high-risk patient subsolid lung nodule . A nodule growth lump may malignant ( cancer ) benign ( cancer ) . Chemoprevention use drug keep cancer form come back . The use acetylsalicylic acid may keep cancer form patient subsolid lung nodule .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Acetylsalicylic Acid Compared Placebo Treating High-Risk Patients With Subsolid Lung Nodules</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . The evaluation effect aspirin ( acetylsalicylic acid ) chemopreventive agent lung cancer . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . The modulation biological marker treatment correlation finding modification lung nodules diameter . II . The per-lesion analysis include evaluation lung nodule density treatment , number size non target lesion include solid nodule evaluation response accord modify Response Evaluation Criteria Solid Tumors ( RECIST ) criterion . OUTLINE : Patients randomize 1 2 treatment arm . ARM I : Patients receive acetylsalicylic acid orally ( PO ) daily ( QD ) 12 month . ARM II : Patients receive placebo PO QD 12 month . After completion study treatment , patient follow 1 month .</detailed_description>
