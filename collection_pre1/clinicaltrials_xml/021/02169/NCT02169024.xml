	<detailed_description>This study address intractable challenge adverse birth outcome , include preterm delivery low birthweight , propose development , implementation evaluation model group prenatal care could scale nationally . Group prenatal care model demonstrate rigorous research provide significantly improve birth outcome implication maternal-child health substantial cost saving . However , group prenatal care currently available small fraction four million woman give birth annually US . Through development , implementation evaluation new model group prenatal care , create outcomes-focused model group prenatal care scalable nationally eye toward improve US birth outcome . Specific Aims : The long-term objective propose study reduce risk adverse perinatal outcome pregnancy among woman family receive prenatal care health center 3 geographic location serve vulnerable population : Hidalgo County Texas , Nashville Tennessee , Detroit Michigan . We develop , disseminate , evaluate new improve model group prenatal care , `` Expect Me , '' base previous research group model prenatal care , already yield favorable behavioral biological result two randomize control trial . The overall objective project improve maternal health reduce adverse birth outcome . We meet objective achieve three specific goal : 1 . Develop new improve model group prenatal care , include curriculum , train material , IT infrastructure marketing material support broad adoption group prenatal care , enhance consumer experience , monitor patient outcome , ensure national scalability . 2 . Implement group prenatal care three community high risk adverse perinatal outcome ( Hidalgo County TX , Nashville TN , Detroit MI ) , engage train provider group facilitation establish curriculum , engage patient improve in-reach outreach strategy , implement IT infrastructure improve uptake , patient experience , sustainability monitoring patient outcome . 3 . Evaluate effect implement group prenatal care rigorous process outcome evaluation identifies barrier national scalability examine maternal health birth outcome resultant cost implication . Specific Study Hypotheses We hypothesize , relative woman receive standard individual prenatal care , woman receive `` Expect Me '' group prenatal care significantly likely : 1. good perinatal outcome , include good health behavior pregnancy ( e.g. , nutrition , physical activity ) , good birth outcome ( e.g. , decrease preterm labor , low birthweight , Neonatal Intensive Care Unit stay ) , good postpartum indicator ( e.g. , increased breastfeeding ) ; 2. report great change risk-related behavior psychosocial characteristic could consider potential mechanisms program 's effectiveness ; 3. low rate sexually transmit disease rapid repeat pregnancy one year postpartum ; 4. low healthcare cost improve outcome ( e.g. , appropriate care utilization , few complication , reduce NICU admissions/length stay )</detailed_description>
