	<brief_title>Efficacy Safety Fexinidazole Patients With Stage 1 Early Stage 2 Human African Trypanosomiasis ( HAT ) Due T.b . Gambiense : Prospective , Multicentre , Open-label Cohort Study , plug-in Pivotal Study</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Primary Objective -To demonstrate success rate fexinidazole one year follow-up stage 1 early stage 2 patient great 80 % . An 80 % success rate consider unacceptable . Secondary Objectives - To verify whether success rate fexinidazole treatment depend stage disease ( stage 1 versus early stage 2 ) ; , difference 2 stage significant , show success rate great 80 % compatible historical success rate NECT early stage 2 patient historical success rate pentamidine stage 1 patient . - To verify whether success rate fexinidazole treatment depend number WBCs CSF treatment initiation . - To assess change success rate time . - To evaluate safety fexinidazole determine whether safety profile comparable historical safety profile pentamidine .</detailed_description>
