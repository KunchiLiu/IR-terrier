	<brief_summary>The investigator ' study plan randomize treatment naive patient vestibular migraine 8 week trial escalate dose either nortriptyline topiramate follow 8 week crossover drug patient willing , patient want stay first medication continue follow . During first 8 week intolerance first drug switch drug point follow medication remainder study . Response therapy quantify Migraine Specific Quality Life ( MSQ ) Dizziness Handicap Inventory ( DHI ) administer multiple time point study . Three group patient eligible study include 1 ) Patients Neuhauser dVM ; 2 ) Patients pVM ; 3 ) Patients dizziness fall outside Neuhauser criterion ( non-Neuhauser vestibular migraine nNVM ) . The investigator ' hypothesis even patient dizziness outside Neuhauser dVM pVM spectrum respond treatment vestibular migraine , thus likely migraine cause dizziness . Previous research group suggest patient fact respond migraine therapy1 . A second goal study evaluate comparative efficacy nortriptyline topiramate treatment three subgroup patient vestibular migraine .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Trial Nortriptyline Topiramate Initial Treatment Vestibular Migraine</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>After identification trial entry , complete intake questionnaire determine type vestibular migraine category patient qualify , standard care office visit history physical ( Standard Care ) review symptoms previous treatment , patient height weight ( standard care ) obtain . Patients complete standard care audiology assessment , follow questionnaire : MSQ ( Migraine Symptom Questionnaire ) Version 2.1 , DHI ( Dizziness Questionnaire ) , C-SSRS ( Columbia Suicide Severity Rating Scale ) MoSQ ( Motion Sensitivity Questionnaire ) . All drug naive patient undergo one month lead treatment involve dietary behavioral control migraine . Emphasis give cessation know migraine trigger caffeine , soda , chocolate , alcohol ( especially red wine ) age cheese . Patients complete control symptom diet behavior modification alone follow total 4 month determine durability symptom relief . Patients fail behavior modification 2 4 month time point chose enter drug treatment portion study , define . At one month point , patient bring clinic office visit history , physical , weight check complete MSQ V2.1 , DHI , C-SSRS MoSQ , randomization either nortriptyline topiramate occur . Randomization occur open low number stack envelop contain randomly preselected card indicate drug use . The nortriptyline give escalate fashion , start 25 mg PO qhs 2 week , follow 50 mg PO qhs 2 week , finally 75 mg PO qhs . Patients encourage use low effective dose self-titrate medication . Topiramate dose 25 mg PO qhs 1 week , follow 25 mg BID 1 week , follow 25 mg morning 50 mg qhs 1 week , finally 50 mg BID . Patients allow considerable leeway adjust dosage encourage stay lowest effective dose . Medication provide open label patient pay patient ' insurance , intervention fall within current standard practice , investigational . After two , three four month drug patient bring clinic office visit history , physical , weight check complete MSQ V2.1 , DHI , C-SSRS MoSQ , patient offer opportunity switch drug . Those patient wish switch drug first wean current drug one week time period . Patients elect stay initial drug follow total four month . Patients opt trial second drug start second drug via self-titrating protocol describe follow drug 4 month . The investigator ' clinical experience show occasion patient refuse take dos nortriptyline topiramate due intolerable side effect . Such patient allow immediately initiate therapy drug . The medication change do phone call pharmacy without office visit , do standard care . Also , patient already follow rigorous migraine diet allow enter drug treatment phase immediately . In experience , patient make less 5 % population present treatment vestibular migraine . The response therapy assess monthly visit use MSQ , DHI MoSQ questionnaire . Patients provide compensation participate study . $ 60 dollar pay patient month participate study . Our goal recruit 100 patient span one year . Data collect include age , sex , height , weight , body mass index ( BMI ) , prior head MRI CT , result vestibular testing , family history migraine . A careful history focus vestibular migraine comorbidities visual scotoma , ability ride back seat car , history `` sinus pain '' . Patients identify one three subtypes vestibular migraine , base symptom history obtain initial visit . Criteria Neuhauser definite vestibular migraine ( dVM ) : ( Neuhauser , 2009 ) : 1 . Episodic vestibular symptom least moderate severity . 2 . Current previous history migraine accord 2004 criteria International Headache Society ( IHS ) 3 . One follow migrainous symptom 2 attack vertigo : migrainous headache , photophobia , phonophobia , visual aura , aura 4 . Other cause rule appropriate investigation Criteria probable vestibular migraine ( pVM ) : 1 . Episodic vestibular symptom least moderate severity 2 . One follow A. current previous history migraine accord 2004 criterion IHS B. migrainous symptom vestibular symptom C. migraine precipitant vertigo &gt; 50 % attack : food trigger , sleep irregularity , hormonal change D. Response migraine medication 50 % attack 3 . Other cause rule appropriate investigation Criteria ( non-Neuhauser vestibular migraine nNVM ) include patient fit criterion dVM pVM felt investigator underlie migraine possible cause dizziness . This include patient remote history migraine , visual aura without headache , recur self-described `` sinus pain '' significant motion intolerance , either head motion motion surroundings . Due know drug interaction , patient take following medication exclude . Nortriptyline : monoamine oxidase inhibitor ( MAO ) phenelzine . Patients oral contraceptive ask use secondary method nortriptyline reduce effectiveness oral contraceptive . Topiramate : acetazolamide ( kidney stone ) , digoxin An electronic health record ( EPIC ) use secure collection patient data . Questionnaires fill patient scan EPIC . A sample size 100 , net 90 subject randomize medication trial ( two equal group 45 subject ) , yield power 82 % detect difference patient-reported effectiveness/acceptability nortriptyline topiramate group two month medication use . This sample size estimate assume 60 % subject use nortriptyline report effective/acceptable , contrast half many subject ( 30 % ) use topiramate . The power calculation base two-sized Z-test pool variance target significance level ( alpha ) 0.05 . The expected difference outcome two group base prior research ( Mikulec , 2012 ) . Adverse effect two drug assess . Specifically , follow know side effect ask record . Nortriptyline : somnolence , weight gain , dry mouth , blur vision Topiramate : Weight loss , parasthesias , forgetfulness , nausea , diarrhea , fatigue The subject allow maintain therapy taper drug . It anticipate derive benefit drug choose stay . All patient option remain care outside study .</detailed_description>
