	<brief_summary>Obesity become global epidemic huge public health implication . Although clinical significant weight loss achieve combination diet behavioral modification , strong metabolic adaptation , increase appetite suppress energy expenditure , activate , compromise weight loss maintenance increase risk relapse . The aim project compare effect intermittent versus continuous energy restriction compensatory responses previously describe use two low calory diet , similar macronutrient distribution . More specifically , study analyze , short-term , intermittent energy restrict diet associate less appetite low reduction energy expenditure compare continuous energy restrict diet . This project bring large practical benefit concern design weight loss program minimize weight relapse .</brief_summary>
