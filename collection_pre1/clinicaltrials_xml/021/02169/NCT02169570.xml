	<brief_summary>Pakistan rank fifth amongst high tuberculosis- ( TB ) burden country , TB persist major cause misery death . The Diabetes Mellitus- ( DM ) also rise Pakistan people suffer DM prone catch TB compare healthy individual . This concurrence two outbreak may increase frequency TB Pakistan . The TB DM co-occurrence result various clinical issue TB DM patient increase blood glucose , make DM difficult treat , DM raise risk treatment failure , relapse death among TB patient . In addition , DM TB usually coexist micronutrient deficiency like vitamin D , vital role immunity , insulin function respiratory health . It suggest combined supplementation vitamin D calcium might beneficial improve glucose metabolism current knowledge limit . In resource restrain country double burden infectious non-infectious disease , integrate approach modification treatment option may benefit management outbreak . Therefore , study aim whether vitamin D calcium supplementation could influence recovery patient TB lung DM .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Effect Supplementary Vitamin D Patients With Diabetes Mellitus Pulmonary Tuberculosis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Pakistan go epidemiological transition subject dual burden communicable chronic disease . According WHO , Pakistan rank seventh diabetes prevalence fifth amongst high TB burden country . Pakistan face challenge control disease combine prevalence 16 % . This co-occurrence DM TB represent big health risk population , diabetes effect susceptibility TB make frequent treatment failure could result community acquire TB infection . On hand , TB worsen glycemic control patient diabetes . Moreover , overlap various drug use treatment might affect glycemic control pharmacokinetics anti-TB treatment , result management TB patient DM complex . Additionally , DM TB often coexist micronutrient deficiency like vitamin D calcium . A vital role vitamin D immunity , insulin resistance respiratory health suggest . Vitamin D calcium deficiency might adversely affect glycemic control , combine supplementation micronutrient might helpful improve glucose metabolism turn improve treatment outcome disease . There suggestion combine supplementation vitamin D calcium might beneficial improve glucose metabolism current knowledge limit one randomize control trial co-morbid group carry India . Even trial independent effect Vitamin D remain unknown used combination therapy calcium vitamin D. Furthermore , trial include radiological change occur follow-up period remain major limitation . Therefore , study assess role supplementation vitamin D calcium recovery ( positive radiological change , weight gain , sputum conversion , glycemic control ) pulmonary TB patient type 2 DM.The goal trial well understand role micro nutrient supplementation among patient active TB type 2 DM disease prognosis . The objective follow : 1 . To determine whether 3 dos vitamin D 600,000 IU interval 4 week alone combination calcium 1000mg 3 month give standard TB type 2 DM treatment make rapid improvement clinical indicator weight TB score among 30 60 year old patient active pulmonary TB type 2 DM attend Ojha Institute Chest Disease ( OICD ) . 2 . To determine whether mentioned dos vitamin D calcium standard TB type 2 DM treatment expedite radiological resolution sputum conversion . 3 . To determine whether mentioned dos vitamin D calcium standard TB type 2 DM treatment efficacious glycemic control among patient . 4 . To guide future clinical treatment patient . Methods : Study Design Setting : A double blind randomize placebo-controlled trial Ojha Institute Chest Disease ( OICD ) . Duration study : Three year grant approval Sample size : We require sample size 144 patient arm measure increase â‰¥ 10 % weight gain improvement 15 % chest radiograph among patient combine supplementation vitamin D calcium compare placebo group . A total 432 round 435 patient require reject null hypothesis 5 % level significance 80 % power 15 % loss follow . Sampling strategy : We approach patient come OICD diagnose active pulmonary TB type 2 DM , prior commencement anti-tuberculosis therapy ( ATT ) . We include type diabetic patient ; either already diagnose type 2 DM screen positive type 2 DM consenting study . Total number visit 7 ( 0 , 4 , 8 , 12 , 16 , 24 week 1 follow ) Data collection Procedure Data collect trained data collector . Medical provider OICD OPDs would provide information potential participant data collector , would invite patient initiate anti-TB treatment ( ATT ) consider enrol study . On basis clinical history record , screen type 2 DM , patient would enrol study . A block randomization ; computer generate , stratify , random assignment list , would use randomize eligible participant . The patient 3 study arm would either receive ATT 600,000 IU intramuscular ( I/M ) vitamin D3 ( cholecalciferol ) 3 dos 0 , 4 12 week color taste match placebo calcium ATT 600,000 IU ( I/M ) vitamin D3 3 dos 0 , 4 12 week daily 1000 mg calcium carbonate ATT placebo color match vitamin D color taste match placebo calcium . All patient would adjust oral hypoglycemic agent insulin glycemic control . Chest radiograph , serum-25- ( OH ) D3 level , serum calcium , Random Blood Sugar ( RBS ) , Fasting Blood Sugar ( FBS ) hemoglobin A1c ( HbA1c ) would obtain 0 , 8 , 16 24 week sputum examination 0 , 4 , 8 , 12 , 16 24 week therapy . Clinical examination would use calculate TB score every visit . Weight would also measure visit . At baseline parameter include Complete Blood Count ( CBC ) , Erythrocyte Sedimentation Rate ( ESR ) , Liver Function Test ( LFTs ) , lipid profile , serum albumin , urine microalbumin would test . All blood test would perform Dow Diagnostic Research Laboratory ( DDRL ) Chest X-ray Radiology department DUHS Ojha campus . Consultant Radiologist report radiological find establishment final diagnosis outcome . Consultant Pulmonologist select participant , follow consultation , establishment final diagnosis outcome . All participant would assure information regard would share one information would use research purpose . Pro forma , blood sample chest x-ray would mark identification . assign participant . Data would enter data entry officer clean miss variable . Data collection tool : Pro forma would use collect basic demographic clinical information . X-ray , sputum , blood urine test Radiology department DUHS ojha campus DDRL respectively . Data analysis Plan : Epi Data Entry software version 1.3 would use data entry . Data would enter cleaned miss entry . Data would analyze 'intention-to-treat ' analysis use software SPSS version 16 . Outcome variable would report either mean standard deviation percentage . Statistical comparison 0 , 12 24 week would perform use Pearson Chi-squared test Student 's t-test categorical continuous variable respectively . A two-tailed p-value &lt; 0.05 would consider significant .</detailed_description>
