	<brief_summary>This study look protection 10-11 15-16 year old , immunized infant Hepatitis B ( HB ) vaccine see still residual protection Hepatitis B disease . Adolescents invite blood test without minimal level protection ( antibody titer ) offer `` test '' vaccination see still capacity recall immune response . About one month later get another blood test see booster response occur . A participant lose protection ( booster response ) offer second HB vaccination restore protection . Results study could influence way child British Columbia ( BC ) immunize HB disease .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Purpose : The purpose study ass whether individual immunized infant Hepatitis B vaccine residual immunity pre-adolescent adolescent year . Two age group ( 10 , 11 year old 15 , 16 year old ) invite blood take measure level protection ( antibody titer ) . Those without minimum protective titer offer Hepatitis B `` test '' vaccination determine still capacity recall immune response ( ie immune memory ) , second line protection infection . A second blood sample obtain determine booster response occur ( immune memory persists , protection intact ) . The study vaccine pediatric dose HB vaccine ( EngerixB ) make GlaxoSmithKline Canada ( 10mcg ) , license product use public immunization program British Columbia ( BC ) currently . Hypothesis : The hypothesis test protection lose sufficient proportion 15-16 year old warrant consideration pre-adolescent HB booster , model 10-11 year old whose protection expect uniformly reinforceable . Justification : This first Canadian study duration HB immune memory infant immunization . According systematic review 46 study , evidence progressive loss immune memory protection decade infant HB vaccination clear . Provinces Canada recently take leap faith drop adolescent HB immunization program , assume HB protection infancy life-long . This project investigate residual HB immunity 10 15 year infant vaccination evaluate prototype booster program provide health official timely , strategic information maintain optimal , informed HB disease control . Research Methods : The study conduct BC use consistent infant HB dosing schedule throughout . Eligible participant healthy 10-11 15-16 year old . After obtain informed consent/assent , blood sample ( 8 ml ) obtain measure serum anti-HBs ( anti-HB surface antigen ) titer . Participants titer ≥10 IU/L inform ongoing protection exit study . Those titer ≤10 IU/L invite return second visit HB challenge immunization . Participants ask return 28 day post-vaccination another blood test . Those developed booster response inform immune exit study . Those boost invite return additional ( remedial ) HB vaccination final titer check available confirm restoration protection . Tests carry BC Center Disease Control 's Hepatitis Laboratory . Booster response expect strong ( titer &gt; 100 IU/L ) . Samples post-booster titer 10-99 IU/L may retested ass antibody avidity distinguish primary secondary type response . Data assemble study center team . Electronic case report form capture case laboratory information , use commercial platform . Statistical Analysis Plan The baseline blood test identify participant residual anti-HBs titer minimum protective threshold 10 IU/L . Based meta-analysis study involve 10 15 year follow-up infant immunization , investigator project 30 % young 60 % old participant titer &lt; 10 IU/L . The booster challenge identify able mount anamnestic/recall response ( titer ≥100 IU/L ) , possible primary response ( titer 10-99 IU/L , low avidity ) response ( titer &lt; 10 IU/L ) . The investigator project 25-30 % old booster recipient anamnestic response , represent 15-20 % overall study population . To detect susceptibility rate 15 % precision ± 0.05 95 % confidence interval , necessary screen 220 individual , allow 10 % drop-out rate . Among young booster recipient , investigator project 10 % anamnestic response , represent overall susceptibility rate ~3 % . For precision ± 0.03 95 % confidence interval , number young subject screen 140 , allow 10 % drop-out rate . Multivariable analysis undertaken identify factor associate loss detectable protection , age final dose , interval since vaccination , gender etc . The apparent rate decline titer 10 16 year age calculate . Mathematical model economic analysis immunization program option include aid subsequent decision-making health authority . Among option model intervention ( rely herd immunity adjacent age group ) single booster dose age 10-11years ( grade 6 BC , locus cancel adolescent HB vaccination program ) .</detailed_description>
