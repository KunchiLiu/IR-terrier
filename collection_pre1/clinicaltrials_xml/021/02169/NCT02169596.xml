	<brief_summary>Background Acute coronary syndrome ( ACS ) term represent disease related reduction blood flow heart characterise clot formation segment blood vessel narrow . A major constituent clot blood cell call platelet many medication use ACS target platelet function . Ticagrelor known reduce platelet activity clot formation block specific step process ( P2Y12 receptor ) . A recent study find presence ticagrelor may also reduce clot formation significantly enhance another process involve molecule nitric oxide ( NO ) . This particular interest translate clinical practice , many patient heart disease abnormal function blood vessel lining . This know cause reduction available nitric oxide . Does therefore mean patient reduce response ticagrelor therapy subsequently increase risk clot formation ? Aims 1 . Will ticagrelor increase anti clot effect vessel lining produce nitric oxide ? 2 . Do patient diabetes smoker , poor function vessel lining , reduce response ticagrelor ? Methods This pilot study propose look 64 patient know disease heart blood vessel , equal mix smoker , diabetic , smoke diabetic non smoke non diabetic . We also recruit ten healthy normal subject ensure test produce result basic science study mention . To answer question pose perform blood test , primarily look platelet function , non-invasive blood vessel line assessment . This do ticagrelor treatment participant , enable statistical comparison .</brief_summary>
