	<brief_title>Secondary Breast Reconstruction With Flap Skin From Back</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Women , treat breast cancer mastectomy , usually eligible subsequent reconstruction breast . Depending various condition reconstruction either immediate delayed . Several different surgical technique delay breast reconstruction describe . An important factor applies delay reconstruction lack excessive , healthy skin area breast remove purpose surgical technique develop therefore provide sufficient amount skin and/or tissue recreate contour breast . The method broadly classify either expander/implant base autologous-tissue base . Though full autologous reconstruction prefer many surgeon patient due superior result always possible implant need combination tissue flap provide sufficient volume . In irradiated patient simple expansion skin often impossible transfer autologous tissue normally require . A wide armamentarium different method available utilize either pedicled free flap tissue transfer . The widely use technique general reconstruction abdominal flap . However , woman eligible either reconstruction abdominal flap microsurgical reconstruction free flap well-known much use technique reconstruction Latissimus Dorsi-flap ( LD-flap ) . Using method island skin subcutaneous tissue provide upper part patient 's back blood supply derive two main branch thoracodorsal artery , imbed underlying Latissimus Dorsi muscle . A call musculocutaneous tissue-flap raise patient 's back tunnel front thorax carry entire Latissimus Dorsi muscle paddle overlie skin . At front chest muscle usually use drape silicone implant , skin use recreate breast mound . This method well-described literature , offer safe reliable option breast reconstruction often use purpose . Donor site sequela however debate . A direct consequence transfer Latissimus Dorsi muscle procedure loss muscle function shoulder upper arm involve extension , adduction rotation shoulder joint . Partial impairment form reduce strength and/or restrict movement thus expect pain weakness neck , shoulder upper arm . Other muscle replace lose function Latissimus Dorsi , sufficient rehabilitation training patient expect regain normal function time . Long term sequela form chronic pain , discomfort , weakness and/or restrict range motion describe evidence particular area ambiguous . There systematic review evidence publish literature paper comprise case report retrospective cohort study although prospective study also exist . The different paper indicate vary rate long-term morbidity associate shoulder arm risk impairment chronic pain ignore base available evidence . At Vejle Hospital Denmark , adopt new technique total breast reconstruction alternative LD-flap July 2011 . This method make use fasciocutaneous flap , also raise patient 's back . Although blood supply also derive Thoracodorsal artery imbed Latissimus Dorsi muscle flap contain skin subcutaneous tissue . The perfusion blood instead supply perforator artery , normally arise descend branch main vessel . This flap call Thoracodorsal Artery Perforator-flap ( TAP-flap/TDAP-flap ) first describe literature 1995 . Use TAP flap pedicled perforator flap describe several case aid treatment defect trunk , upper extremity , head neck . In field breast surgery primarily use oncoplastic procedure , although paper describe preliminary use TAP-flap combination implant total reconstruction breast . As technique recently adopt none publish study examine long term result advantage use TAP-flap . A single retrospective study investigate shoulder function harvest flap find affection shoulder joint upper arm . We choose perform modify version technique combine TAP-flap implant use acellular dermal matrix ( ADM ) . This matrix use drape lower pole implant sense create internal bra support prosthesis . We presume part replaces supportive effect normally provide muscle use LD-flap . The ADM thus use substitute patient 's tissue time become integrated part . Applying technique upper part silicone implant cover Major Pectoral muscle , low part drape ADM . The matrix suture free , low edge muscle well chest wall desire level new inframammary fold . This cover fixate implant relieve pressure flap afterwards use cover reconstruct mound . We believe enhances sufficient blood supply flap thus provide optimal condition term obtain complication-free healing . Harvest TAP-flap allows Latissimus Dorsi muscle leave undissected case . When indicate small cuff muscle surround dominate perforator include flap small back cut inferiorly perforator make allow tension free rotation skin paddle . In case procedure expect leave muscle function intact . Though TAP flap well-described several reconstructive purpose application flap tool total breast reconstruction new endeavour importance yet establish . Based flaps property gentle dissection/harvest tissue leave underlie Latissimus Dorsi muscle intact presume application new technique facilitate statistically significant reduction associate morbidity term impairment and/or chronic pain shoulder , back upper arm experience LD-flap base reconstruction . Furthermore expect use TAP-flap cause decrease need postoperative physical rehabilitation term physiotherapy training . The aim study thus test whether hypothesis true order establish whether TAP-flap base reconstruction offer advantage favour conventional LD-based reconstruction . The main objective study determine whether detectable difference shoulder affection distinguishes two technique . For purpose design two separate trial : Retrospective Follow-up Trial This part study intend examine compare historical data woman already delay breast reconstruction one two method . The main goal pilot study collect analyse exist information order provide sound background knowledge serve basis follow RCT . Most importantly study provide sufficient data perform accurate calculation sample size . Randomized Clinical Trial This trial conduct confirmatory superiority trial . The intend collect , examine compare data two surgical technique order test superiority TAP-flap base reconstruction accordance hypothesis specify . The trial thus design two parallel study-arms patient allocate reconstruction either LD-flap TAP-flap ratio 1:1 . As clinically important parameter seem objective change shoulder function serve primary end-point . Patient report discomfort/pain well need physical rehabilitation also investigate analysed supportive secondary end-points . In addition data number patient-related outcome collect part trial . These issue address tertiary end-points exploratory nature . We expect data supply useful knowledge investigation separate study . Designed multicentre trial patient enrolment collection data perform academic hospital Denmark Norway . All Danish unit specialize plastic reconstructive surgery familiar technique use protocol invited participate trial . In addition one centre Skien , Norway , adopt TAP-flap technique prior initiation trial , invited participate . To avoid bias relate possible effect outcome measure cause surgical procedure mastectomy axillary surgery perform simultaneously reconstruction delay procedure study , also commonly case autologous tissue transfer require . A password protect , electronic database place secure server establish . This database accessible primary investigator member research group involve analysis data . Data blind relation allocate treatment . This study provide good knowledge expect outcome delay breast reconstruction , perform one two surgical technique . Thus investigator expect result help determine TAP-flap combination ADM may represent good gentler method reconstruction breast low morbidity well cost-effectiveness conventional LD-flap . In case result trial enable u provide patient well objective information , subject delay breast reconstruction .</detailed_description>
	<criteria>To avoid bias relate possible effect outcome measure cause surgical procedure mastectomy axillary surgery perform simultaneously reconstruction delay procedure study , also commonly case autologous tissue transfer require . Patients thus assessed eligibility include woman refer participate centre unilateral , delayed breast reconstruction inclusion period . The criteria participation follow : Inclusion criterion : 1 ) Women 18 year age refer period 1st September 2013 30st August 2015 purpose unilateral , delayed breast reconstruction , find best suit reconstruction pedicled tissue flap back . Exclusion criterion 1 . Patients find well suit reconstruction another method i.e . abdominal free flapreconstruction expander/implantbased reconstruction . 2 . Patients severe dementia make impossible collect data obtain informed consent 3 . NonDanish speaking patient informed consent obtain interpreter 4 . Patients suit perforator Thoracodorsal artery identify colour Doppler ultrasonography . All woman refer delayed breast reconstruction inclusion period assess eligibility meeting criterion study population invite participate study . The assessment conduct preliminary examination outpatient clinic one centre consultant assign trial . Invited patient receive oral write participant information period minimum 14 day require patient enrol trial accordance The Danish Health Act . Patients consider participation invite second consultation write informed consent obtain accept invitation . Randomization perform immediately afterwards allocate patient reconstruction either LDflap TAPflap . Patients enrol trial offer reconstruction LDflap must consider standard care .</criteria>
