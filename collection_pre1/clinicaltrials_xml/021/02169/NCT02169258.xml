	<brief_summary>1 . The prevalence significant complex obstructive coronary artery disease ( CAD ) high patient low extremity artery disease ( LEAD ) . 2 . Long-term prognosis LEAD undergo percutaneous transluminal angioplasty ( PTA ) remain poor CAD independent predictor total mortality PTA . 3 . This prospective randomized control trial evaluate prognostic effect routine versus selective coronary angiography PTA LEAD elucidate potential mechanism .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>1. participant 1. eligible participant randomly assign systemic strategy selective strategy - participant allocate systemic strategy receive routine coronary angiography PTA without previous non-invasive stress test - subject allocate selective strategy undergo non-invasive evaluation possible myocardial ischemia use dobutamine stress echocardiography ( DSE ) dipyridamole thallium 201 myocardial perfusion scintigraphy ( dTS ) follow coronary angiography test positive ischemia 2. participant willing randomize included registration group 2. revascularization 1. stag approach ( myocardial revascularization first follow PTA ) simultaneous approach ( percutaneous coronary intervention immediately follow PTA time clinically suitable ) allow 2. duration revascularization PTA within 60 day 3. percutaneous coronary intervention perform time coronary angiography , use bare metal drug-eluting stent 3. blood sampling , genotyping , measurement biomarkers microRNA a. bood sample ( 20 mL ) obtain peripheral artery study subject PTA 10 mL PTA prepare store enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay ( ELISA ) , genotyping measurement microRNAs plasma peripheral blood mononuclear cell 4. outcome follow-up a. clinical outcome obtain chart review patient still hospital follow clinic visit , telephone call direct contact participant subject ' family 30 day indexed PTA patient discharge hospital every 6 month thereafter</detailed_description>
