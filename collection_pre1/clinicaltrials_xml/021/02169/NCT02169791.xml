	<detailed_description>Overview Study Design : In attempt reduce relapse risk improve outcome follow haploidentical transplantation patient high risk hematologic malignancy , investigator implement several strategy augment well document effect NK cell alloreactivity see HLA-mismatched transplantation . These strategy include ( 1 ) choose potential haploidentical donor optimal NK-alloreactivity , ( 2 ) utilize proteasome inhibition post-transplant MLN9708 sensitize tumor cell NK cytotoxicity protect graft-versus-host disease ( GVHD ) , ( 3 ) eliminate mycophenolate mofetil post-transplant immunosuppression regimen improve NK cell reconstitution follow haploidentical peripheral blood stem cell transplantation . Patients receive nonmyeloablative haploidentical transplant use T-cell replete allograft post-transplant cyclophosphamide previously describe center ( Bashey et al . J Clin Oncol . 2013 ; 31 ( 10 ) :1310-6 ) . MLN9708 administer weekly 3 week 28 day cycle one-year post-transplant . Post-transplant immunosuppression consist tacrolimus ( MLN9708 substitute mycophenolate mofetil second GVHD prophylactic medication ) . The primary endpoint trial risk relapse and/or progression one-year post-transplant . Experience literature suggest follow nonmyeloablative haploidentical transplant use post-transplant cyclophosphamide ( haplo-pCy ) , risk relapse approximately 50 % one year post-transplant . It hop protocol , rate 25 % . Thus investigator statistically formalize study test null hypothesis p , PFS rate 0.25 less versus alternative hypothesis p great 0.5 . A sample size 25 patient give 90 % power alpha=0.05 , use formula one sample binomial ( two-sided ) test proportion .</detailed_description>
