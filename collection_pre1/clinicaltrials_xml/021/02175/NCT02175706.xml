	<brief_summary>Rationale : The introduction drug-eluting stent ( DES ) treatment coronary artery disease lead significant reduction morbidity demand DES performance . Such demand optimize performance challenge coronary lesion ; third generation DES develop effort improve DES performance challenge lesion . Two CE-certified third generation DES ( Resolute Integrity Promus Element stent ) currently available ; data indicate advantage one DES . Objective : To investigate whether clinical outcome similar implantation Promus Element versus Resolute Integrity stent ( non-inferiority hypothesis ) . Study design : Multicenter , prospective , randomize single-blinded study . Study population : Patients require percutaneous coronary intervention ( PCI ) treatment coronary stenosis indication DES use , accord current guideline and/or operator clinical judgement . All clinical syndrome include . Intervention : In patient eligible DES implantation , type DES implant randomize ( Resolute Integrity stent versus Promus Element stent ) . At start study , DES also use routine clinical practice . Main study endpoint : The primary endpoint incidence target vessel failure one year follow-up . Target vessel failure ( TVF ) composite endpoint consist cardiac death , target vessel MI , clinically driven target vessel revascularization . Further secondary clinical angiographic endpoint investigate , define accordance suggestion Academic Research Consortium ( ARC ) . Of note , angiographic assessment base clinically indicated projection result additional x-ray exposure . There routine angiographic follow-up . If angiographic data available patient undergo symptom-driven re-catheterization , analyze data get insight mechanism potential DES restenosis . Nature extent burden risk associate participation , benefit group relatedness : Patients receive routine clinical treatment . As consequence , risk trial exceed risk routine PCI procedure .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>1 . OBJECTIVES Primary research question To investigate whether outcome randomize implantation Resolute Integrity versus Promus Element drug-eluting stent similar , assess non-inferiority set compare target-vessel failure ( TVF ) stents one year follow-up post stent implantation . In brief , want compare drug-eluting stent combine endpoint ( 1 ) cardiac death , ( 2 ) myocardial infarction relate target vessel relate another vessel , ( 3 ) clinically indicate revascularization relate target-vessel . Based result RESOLUTE all-comers trial ( study stent RESOLUTE comer trial use coating drug use current trial different bare metal stent platform ) , non-inferiority Resolute Integrity Promus Element expect . This test controlled randomize trial yet . Secondary research question Effectivity , safety , clinical short- long-term outcome , acute angiographic result implantation two third-generation drug-eluting stent compare `` real world '' , all-comers scenario . Angiographic comparison base routine coronary angiography run record diagnostic coronary angiography PCI procedure . No additional mandatory angiographic study index PCI require . 2 . STUDY DESIGN The DUTCH PEERS Study multi-center prospective single-blinded randomize study . Randomization involve type DES use study population . Patients blind type DES receive . The general practitioner patient request disclose information patient . Analysts perform data analysis blind type DES use well . 3 . STUDY POPULATION 3.1 Population ( base ) All patient fulfil inclusion criterion undergo PCI potential DES implantation ask participate DUTCH PEERS , unless meet one exclusion criterion . Patients receive drug-eluting stent accord guideline ( Guidelines NVVC/ESC ) and/or clinical decision interventional cardiologist . 3.2 Inclusion criterion - Minimum age 18 year - Coronary artery disease lesion ( ) eligable treatment drug elute stent accord clinical guideline and/or operator ' judgement - Patient willing able cooperate study procedure require follow-up visit ; patient inform agrees participation sign EC approve write informed consent . 3.3 Exclusion criterion - Participation another randomize drug device study reach primary endpoint - Planned surgery within 6 month PCI unless dual antiplatelet therapy maintain throughout peri-surgical period - intolerance P2Y12 receptor antagonist result patient 's inability adhere dual-antiplatelet therapy , intolerance aspirin , heparin , component two DES examine . - Known pregnancy - Life expectancy less 1 year 4.1 Randomisation , blind treatment allocation Patients randomised computer program ( block stratify randomization V5.0 S. Piantadosi ) . The randomisation do block 8 4 random order . No stratification employ . The study single blind physician know stent implant . The patient know . Every attempt make outcome assessment blind . The analyst perform QCA IVUS analysis blind type DES use . Demographics Medical Data At baseline data collect researcher , research nurse , and/or nurse practitioner . Demographic medical data also collect review patient 's medical chart : - demographic include : date birth , gender , family history cardiovascular disease , smoke habit ; - medical history include : arterial hypertension , diabetes mellitus , hypercholesterolemia , previous myocardial infarction , previous revascularization mean CABG / PCI , previous cerebrovascular accident ( CVA ) transient ischemic attack ( TIA ) , renal failure require haemodialysis ; - current medication ; - body-mass index , arterial blood pressure , heart frequency ; - indication PCI ; - symptom prior PCI : angina pectoris ( CCS class ) , dyspnea ( NYHA class ) . Blood sample Laboratory test perform local laboratory participate centre part clinical routine practice . In elective primary PCI day PCI procedure , blood test perform ( assessment Hb , Kreatinine , CK , CK-MB , Troponines ) . If patient suffer persistent chest pain PCI , additional control cardiac marker perform day PCI part clinical routine . In case symptom suspicious acute coronary event patient schedule elective PCI , assessment cardiac marker prior PCI consider good clinical practice perform . PCI procedure Routine PCI perform accord routine medical practice include centre deviation routine protocol . No additional angiographic view require . Patients receive one DES PCI . The type DES use PCI randomize . Detailed technical information PCI procedures provide current European society cardiology guideline PCI . [ 27 ] If clinically indicate , IVUS-guidance use PCI . Mixture stent avoid permit operator unable insert study stent , case crossover another non-study stent possible . Treatment coronary lesion aim one session , however stag procedure ( define procedure plan time index procedure perform within 6 week type study stent ) permit . In case unplanned revascularization procedure require stent implantation , recommend physician use study stent . Medical therapy Medical therapy differ current routine medical treatment . In brief , patient oral aspirin therapy receive load dose least 300 mg prior PCI . In elective PCI patient , clopidogrel therapy 75 mg daily start one week PCI . In urgent PCI , load dose 600 mg clopidogrel give soon possible , either PCI ( least ) directly PCI perform . In case prasugrel use , patient receive load dose 60 mg prasugrel follow daily dose 10 mg least 12 month . Directly prior PCI , adequate dose unfractionated heparin administer i.v . i.a . In general , intracoronary bolus nitrate administer prior PCI . The use glycoprotein IIb/IIIa inhibitor leave operator ' discretion . Following index PCI procedure , patient generally maintain aspirin &gt; =80 mg daily entire trial ( preferably lifelong ) . In general , clopidogrel 75 mg daily recommend prescribed period 12 month addition aspirin . If patient require oral anticoagulation therapy ( e.g . atrial fibrillation ) , aspirin &gt; =80 mg daily prescribe one month PCI clopidogrel 12 month . Further medical treatment perform accord current medical guideline , clinical standard , judgment refer physician . Follow-up data collection Follow-up data collect routine visit outpatient clinic and/or phone call . If data available outpatient clinic visit , require data collect phone call . The phone call follow-up conduct blinded member research team ( nurse practicioners , cardioresearch personnel research fellows ) . Through outpatient clinic visit telephone call patient ask recurrence symptom new symptom indicate presence restenosis . Patients also ask possible revascularization myocardial infarction follow-up period . In case death , information obtain patient 's medical chart , GP cardiologist . Patients call 1 month , 12 month 24 month . The mode data acquisition follow ( telephone outpatient visit ) register . In order determine whether myocardial infarction relate unrelated target vessel , Critical Events Committee consist two independent cardiologist ask provide independent conclusion location infarction electrocardiogram . Adverse event , comprise primary endpoint , monitor independent external contract research organisation . In addition , intend secondary clinical endpoint least 10 % patient monitor , .</detailed_description>
