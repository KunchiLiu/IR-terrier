	<brief_summary>In second-line treatment set MBC , many agent , include antitubulin drug ( Taxanes , Vinorelbine ) antimetabolites ( Capecitabine , Gemcitabine ) , demonstrated activity , agent clearly superior . Although combination cytotoxic agent provide small progression-free survival advantage , none demonstrate OS advantage , toxicity generally great single agent . At present , standard treatment set . New treatment could delay disease progression without systemic toxicity would represent significant advancement .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Safety Efficacy Study Eribulin Combination With Bevacizumab Second-line Treatment HER2- MBC Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Metastatic breast cancer ( MBC ) incurable , majority patient succumb disease within 2 year diagnosis . Patients MBC usually receive treatment endocrine cytotoxic chemotherapeutic agent , treatment decision generally guide hormone receptor Human Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor 2-Negative status disease , number location metastasis , prior treatment history adjuvant metastatic setting . In first- second-line treatment setting Metastatic Breast Cancer , numerous cytotoxic chemotherapy agent demonstrated activity , include anti-tubulin drug ( Taxanes , Vinorelbine ) , Anthracyclines , anti-metabolites ( Capecitabine , Gemcitabine ) . However , single agent demonstrate clear survival advantage another , use sequential single-agent therapy frequent approach . The choice chemotherapy agent ( ) often determined number factor , include history prior therapy , treatment-free interval , patient preference . Thus , single standard treatment exist patient advanced disease . Patients progress first treatment Metastatic Brest Cancer typically short progression-free interval 4-6 month survive 8-12 month . New treatment modality need improve clinical outcome maintain quality life patient .</detailed_description>
