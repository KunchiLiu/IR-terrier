	<brief_title>Amoxicillin/Metronidazole Based Quadruple Therapy Helicobacter Pylori Eradication</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Helicobacter pylori successful human pathogen infecting estimate 50 % global population . It common potentially curable cause dyspepsia peptic ulcer disease . Eradication patient peptic ulcer even functional non-investigated dyspepsia cost effective approach . Most Consensus Conferences Clinical Guidelines recommend prescription triple therapy include proton pump inhibitor ( PPI ) clarithromycin either amoxicillin metronidazole , first-line treatment . However , effectiveness triple-therapy regimen seem diminished time , largely result emerge resistance organism clarithromycin . Due low efficacy achieve treatment , deem unethical comparators clinical trial . As antimicrobial resistance become prevalent worldwide , treatment failure rate likely continue increase , suggest new regimen H pylori eradication must seek . Bismuth-containing quadruple therapy use widely H. pylori therapy many permutation dos duration variable result . Classical bismuth-based quadruple therapy contain PPI , bismuth , tetracycline metronidazole recommend first-line treatment Maastricht IV Consensus Conference report H. pylorus Study Group Chinese Society Gastroenterology . But regiment high rate side effect tetracycline . Standard triple therapy-based , bismuth-containing quadruple Therapy also alternative . Though addition bismuth prolong treatment duration overcome H. pylorus resistance clarithromycin , use first-line treatment limited area high clarithromycin resistance . Amoxicillin low resistance rate well low percentage side effect . The combination amoxicillin metronidazole bismuth-containing quadruple therapy may better choice , avoid clarithromycin resistance reduce side effect . Therefore , randomize trial compare eradication rate 14-day amoxicillin metronidazole base bismuth-containing quadruple therapy amoxicillin clarithromycin base quadruple therapy Helicobacter pylorus infection .</detailed_description>
