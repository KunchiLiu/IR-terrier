	<brief_title>18FFLT-PET Predictive Imaging Biomaker Treatment Responses Regorafenib</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Recent advance make treatment patient metastatic colorectal cancer ( mCRC ) owe introduction target agent , include bevacizumab , cetuximab , panitumumab , aflibercept . And addition , regorafenib , new tyrosine kinase inhibitor ( TKI ) , approve treatment mCRC patient . Regorafenib ( BAY 73-4506 ) orally available multikinase inhibitor activity multiple target , include tumor angiogenesis ( VEGFR-1 , -2 , -3 TIE-2 ) , oncogenesis ( KIT , RET , RAF-1 , BRAF , BRAFV600E ) , tumor microenvironment ( PDGF FGFR ) . Regorafenib show antitumor activity multiple solid tumor , demonstrate significant efficacy outcomes patient advance gastrointestinal stromal tumor colorectal cancer . The CORRECT study , compare regorafenib v placebo mCRC patient treated standard treatment , show survival improvement statistical significance ; median OS 6.4 v 5.0 month , HR 0.77 , p=0.0052 ; median PFS 1.9 v 1.7 month , HR 0.49 , p &lt; 0.000001 . Above result , regorafenib monotherapy recently approve treatment mCRC patient refractory standard therapy . However , still biomarkers establish predictive treatment response field treatment mCRC patient ; KRAS BRAF mutation lack responses anti-EGFR agent , cetuximab panitumumab . There still biomarker would predictive treatment response bevacizumab , aflibercept regorafenib . The difficulty search biomarkers agent might come fact follow ; either bevacizumab aflibercept act directly tumor combine cytotoxic agent show efficacy ; regorafenib multikinase inhibitor many potential target . Above reason , image modality fascinate alternative candidate predictive biomarkers treatment response . Conventional anatomic imaging study compute tomography ( CT ) scan hardly predict treatment response earlier , RECIST use CT scan , widely use measurement treatment response , might several limitation measurement efficacy target agent cystic necrosis without tumor shrinkage . In CORRECT study , overall response rate RECIST 1 % , although rate disease stabilization 40 % , might good example limitation RECIST use conventional anatomical image study response evaluation regorafenib . Among image study , PET scan useful tool noninvasive measurement functional change treatment target agent , [ 18F ] FLT-PET potentially useful tool earlier prediction treatment response detect early change cellular proliferation use [ 18F ] FLT ( fluorothymidine ) , radiotraceable substitute thymidine essential DNA synthesis . Several study report [ 18F ] FLT-PET may allow early assessment response chemotherapy include targeted agent . There also report [ 18F ] FLT-PET could predict treatment response BRAF inhibitor colorectal cancer xenograft model ; regorafenib also inhibitory effect BRAF . Therefore , investigator plan study hypothesis [ 18F ] FLT-PET could useful identify subgroup mCRC patient clinical responsiveness regorafenib .</detailed_description>
