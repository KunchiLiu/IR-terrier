	<brief_summary>Tuberculosis burden Vietnam increase contribution low detection rate increase drug resistance . There need identify MDR-TB ( MultiDrug Resistant Tuberculosis ) among notify TB case contact community . Traditional contact trace often focus household contact strain TB circulate home , school , workplace , beyond . Social network Analysis ( SNA ) comprehensive approach include set person connection among used analysis structure disease transmission . In study , SNA use collect network data 60 newly detect Rifampicin resistant TB patient include expected 50 MDR-TB patient live Hanoi , identify test potential MDR-TB case .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Intensifying Multi-Drug Resistant Tuberculosis Contact Tracing Social Network Analysis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The study identify recruit 60 newly detect Rifampicin resistant TB patient include expected 50 MDR-TB patient live Hanoi ( index case ) undergo SNA contact place stay 3 month precede TB diagnosis include residence , travel history , place social aggregation relation risk behaviour . Patients interviewed investigate contact confirmation MDR-TB ( early contact detection minimize risk information lose due patient default treatment ) . Data analysis focus MDR-TB social network use Cytoscape software . After first two enrolled Rifampicin resistant MDR-TB case , social network data analyze identify close contact , mutual contact , mutual place high risk location . The Social Network Questionnaire ( SNQ ) contextualized Vietnamese setting validate pilot study . Eligible contact location undergo MDR-TB screening . Approximately 720 contact undergo active screening ( 2 occasion per individual : time contact identification 6 month later ) . Contacts include household contact , close contact , mutual contact symptomatic individual significant exposure index case mutual location within closed environment . Contact screen involve clinical assessment , chest X-ray sputum gastric aspirate collection TB culture , molecular technique microbiological identification . If contact screen detected Rifampicin resistant TB , invite included SNA analysis . The number MDR-TB detect SNA determine whether transmission MDR-TB otherwise detect routine contact investigation ( household contact trace ) important . While traditional contact tracing practice Vietnam mainly focus household contact detect secondary case TB , SNA expect identify secondary case MDR-TB within extend catchment also identify source case MDR-TB patient `` turn tap '' MDR-TB transmission . Moreover , place identify source sustain transmission target case find along appropriate resource allocation . In study analysis focus cost contact trace Social Network Questionnaires , proportion MDR-TB among eligible contact subgroup , proportion MDR-TB among Rifampicin resistant TB patient genotyping pattern MDR -TB patient .</detailed_description>
