	<detailed_description>Study population : Fifty patient admit cardiac arrest undergone acutte PCI inclded trial . All patient hospitalize cardiologic intensive department , RH , receive ticagrelor ( Brilique ) nasogastric tube enrol study . Administration ticagrelor follow usual indication thus use patient consider suffer acute coronary syndrome ( ACS ) . Blood sample collect already inserted central venous catheter ( CVC ) therefore affect patient . The first sample collect directly first dos medicine give ( t0 ) , sample thereafter repeatedly take ( 2 ( ±1 ) , 4 ( ±1 ) , 8 ( ±1 ) ,12 ( ±1 ) , 24 ( ±2 ) hour , hereafter daily ( kl . 6-8 ) first day patient receive tablet orally , intensive care treatment terminate ( though , 5 day sample , addition first day ) . Medical treatment All study participant receive antithrombotic treatment clinical indication : aspirin + ticagrelor ( brilique ) , thus antithrombotic give without indication dos ( bolus maintain dose ) give accord product information . Time set medicine administration control EPM ( electronic patient medication module ) . The Ticagrelor use `` medicine-off-the-shelf '' administrate follow dos : Ticagrelor : bolus 180 mg p.o . soon possible PCI insertion naso-gastic tube . Maintenance dos ( 90 mg ) administrate 6 AM ( +/- 1h ) 6PM ( +/- 1h ) first maintenance dose administrate &lt; 12 hour bolus 6AM 6 PM whatever come first . Contraindications state respectively product 's summary follow . Blood sample Blood collect platelet function analysis analyse immediately VerifyNow Multiplate TEG-platelet mapping available . In addition , 50 ml blood save research bio bank collect analysis concentration ticagrelor ( active metabolite parent compound ) end study . Residual blood destroyed . The maximum total amount blood collect 150 ml . Informed consent trial in-capacitated patient In trial , patient unconscious due prior cardiac arrest due cardiogenic shock participate . Most patient connect life support others unconscious state , exclude possibility obtain informed agreement . All patient &gt; 18 year old . The study conduct Danish international guideline good clinical practice ( ICHP-GCP ) study approve regional scientific ethical committee Danish Medical Agency . The participate study person unconscious , sedated cerebral situation reasonable consider involvement scientific study , therefore able give inform consent acute phase .

There establish committee two `` legal guardian '' ( Danish : forsøgsværge ) , agree patient 's involvement trial make individual judgement single patient 's suitability participate . The `` legal guardian '' ( Danish : forsøgsværge ) time , receive update study protocol information material otherwise would present patient/next kin context obtain informed consent .
