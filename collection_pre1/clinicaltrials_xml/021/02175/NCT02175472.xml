	<brief_summary>Light treatment originally employ Parkinson 's disease ( PD ) determine might effective treat co-existing symptom depression insomnia . However , preliminary double-blind study well study report significant improvement motor co-existing Parkinsonian symptom . As yet , long term double blind study validate finding . This study use double-blind design evaluate safety efficacy non-invasive light therapy device use ongoing pharmacotherapy PD , six month treatment period .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Efficacy Study Light Therapy Adjunctive Treatment Parkinson 's Disease</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Parkinson 's disease ( PD ) traditionally describe disorder compromise dopamine ( DA ) function nigro-striatal dopamine ( NSD ) system . This system extend midbrain , hypothalamus forebrain critical area involve control motor performance . Restoration DA content system administer DA precursor L-dopa DA agonists reinstates motor control , provide symptomatic relief wan efficacy disease advance . Symptoms depression sleep disturbance also commonly see PD patient , manifestation symptom suggest impaired circadian function . Although involvement circadian system PD intimate first formal account disorder provide James Parkinson , recently circadian malfunction specifically cite play major role development progression disease . In addition scatter report depict circadian-like feature PD relate syndrome , large body evidence describes benefit light therapy PD preclinical clinical perspective . While development formal understanding largely omitted basis therapeutic effect exert light , recent study show nigro-striatal dopamine system comprise cell type cell retina pineal . Such cell drive visual input whereby dopamine melatonin sit functional opposition regulate day night activity include sleep , mood , reproduction , anti-oxidation movement . Hence one may conclude circadian system play major role many aspect PD . Recent work PD also suggest efficacy light therapy mediate melatonin dopamine function retina . On basis would reasonable assume intervention function circadian system light therapy PD patient might well serve modify course consequence disease . The present study serf extend find point provide practical , non-invasive method help patient .</detailed_description>

Have plan travel two week outside two time zone home involvement Investigation 16 . Planned travel outside two time zone home last two month Subject 's involvement Investigation 17 . Current use use within previous 1 month photosensitize medication opinion investigator would interfere safety Subject trial include amiodarone benoxaprofen chlorpromazine demeclocycline fleroxacin nalidixic acid ofloxacin piroxicam porfimer psoralens quinidine temoporfin tetracycline oral isoretinoin ( Accutane ) St. John 's wort melatonin 18 . Have history significant eye trauma disease , retinopathy , and/or cataract level would significantly affect transmission processing light either eye 19 . Other neurological disorder opinion Investigator would interfere conduct study 20 . Preexisting major joint problem opinion Investigator would interfere conduct study 21 . History cerebral insult central nervous system infection opinion Investigator would preclude successful participation Investigation relate procedure 22 . Cognitive impairment , e.g . determine Montreal Cognitive Assessment , opinion Investigator would interfere conduct Investigation 23 . Focal neurological deficit opinion Investigator would interfere conduct Investigation 24 . High dopamine replacement therapy ( DART ) dosage level severe dyskinesia attributable DART would preclude successful participation Investigation relate procedure intervention opinion site Investigator</criteria>
