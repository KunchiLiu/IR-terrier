	<brief_summary>Several study exist patient performance drive simulator especially around surgery . Recommendations concern ability drive preoperatively base study , generate data use drive simulator . However , datasets drive performance remain highly individual . Since drive simulator readily available normal general practitioner surgery would helpful convenient clinical test evaluate patient individual ability perform emergency stop . This study aim evaluate different possibility performance might predict . Patients knee osteoarthritis patient receive total knee arthroplasty test clinically result compare gold standard experiment - drive simulator .</brief_summary>
