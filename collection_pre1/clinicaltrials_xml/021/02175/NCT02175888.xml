	<brief_summary>Iron deficiency ( ID ) without anaemia ( IDA ) major public health problem worldwide , especially woman reproductive age young child . Iron supplementation effective strategy prevent treat ID IDA . There lack data iron bioavailability different supplementation regimen optimize bioavailability cost-effective patient-friendly way . The present study test whether fractional total iron absorption iron supplement ( 60 mg ) administer daily 14 day differs iron supplement ( 60 mg ) administer every second day 28 day . The prevail serum hepcidin concentration ( SHep ) major determinant iron absorption erythrocyte iron utilization . Therefore monitor SHep whole supplementation period . We hypothesize fractional total iron absorption daily administration 60 mg low administration every second day due increase SHep level supplement administer daily . The study provide important insight optimization iron bioavailability different supplementation regimen include performance SHep , key regulator human iron metabolism .</brief_summary>
