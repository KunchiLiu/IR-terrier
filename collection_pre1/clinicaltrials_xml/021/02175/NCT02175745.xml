	<brief_title>18F-FDOPA PET/CT PET/MRI Measuring Tumors Patients With Newly-Diagnosed Recurrent Gliomas</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This clinical trial compare fluorine F-18 fluoro-dihydroxyphenylalanine ( 18F-fluorodopa 18F-FDOPA ) positron emission tomography ( PET ) standard magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) measure tumor patient glioma newly diagnose recurrent ( return ) . 18F-FDOPA radioactive drug bind tumor cell capture image PET . Computed tomography ( CT ) MRI use PET describe information regard function , location , size tumor . PET/CT PET/MRI may accurate standard MRI help doctor find measure brain tumor .</detailed_description>
