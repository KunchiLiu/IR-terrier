	<brief_title>A Study Evaluate Safety , Tolerability , Pharmacokinetics Escalating Doses AGS67E Given Monotherapy Subjects With Refractory Relapsed Lymphoid Malignancies</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The dose escalation study two part : 1 . Dose Escalation AGS67E without myeloid growth factor ( GF ) 2 . Dose Escalation AGS67E myeloid growth factor ( GF ) Subjects enrol sequentially dose cohort start AGS67E without GF . All subject receive single 30 minute intravenous ( IV ) infusion AGS67E every three week . Subjects continue treatment disease progression , intolerability AGS67E , investigator decision consent withdrawal . This dose escalation first determine maximum tolerate dose ( MTD ) AGS67E without GF determine MTD AGS67E GF . Once MTD establish , study may enroll subject respective expansion cohort 12 subject dose recommend data review team ( DRT ) ( expansion cohort without GF and/or expansion cohort GF ) . During dose escalation , Data Review Team review cumulative unaudited data interim basis review subject safety , recommend explore additional dos and/or schedule , expansion exist cohort .</detailed_description>
