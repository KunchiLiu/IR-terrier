	<brief_title>SANICS II Trial : Stimulation Autonomic Nervous System Colorectal Surgery Perioperative Nutrition</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Postoperative ileus ( POI ) anastomotic leakage ( AL ) important clinical determinant short-term morbidity mortality follow colorectal surgery . Importantly , AL also risk factor local recurrence colorectal cancer significant impact disease-free overall survival . It therefore believe improve postoperative outcome follow colorectal surgery also improve long-term oncological outcome regard overall survival tumour recurrence . POI common complication colorectal surgery cause discomfort patient also lead prolonged hospital length stay increase health care cost . For POI believe formation inflammatory infiltrate muscular layer intestine follow bowel manipulation surgery lead decrease gastrointestinal motility . In recent year investigator demonstrate experimental model administration enteral nutrition modulates inflammatory response via autonomic nervous system release cholecystokinin ( CCK ) . Composition enteral nutrition time administration essential magnitude effect . For optimal effect , nutrition give high fraction lipid protein administer , directly incite event . In way , inflammatory response optimally dampen via release CCK . In experimental study show lipid-enriched enteral nutrition reduces systemic inflammation postoperative ileus CCK-dependent manner give directly bowel manipulation . Next , investigator perform study healthy volunteer effect continuous low volume enteral nutrition investigate inflammatory parameter human endotoxemia model . In study show lipid enrich nutrition reduce inflammatory response upon endotoxemia man . Also clinical set investigator show enteral nutrition reduces inflammation postoperative ileus . In randomized controlled trial investigator show enteral nutrition early colorectal surgery reduce POI . Furthermore , model sham-feeding use chew gum show inflammation postoperative ileus reduce follow colorectal surgery . Interestingly , clinical study sham feed early enteral nutrition reveal yet unaccountable effect anastomotic leakage . Evidence relation POI anastomotic leakage scarce great impact . It seem early intervention enteral nutrition shortly , early colorectal surgery may reduce inflammation reduce important determinant postoperative morbidity POI anastomotic leakage . All patient receive self-migrating nasojejunal tube one day surgery . The position nasojejunal tube verify mean X-ray night surgery . Preoperatively , patient receive standard care fast solid ( oral ) food 6 hour ( oral ) fluid fast 2 hour administration . Three hour surgery pump start administer nutrition standardize amount . Enriched enteral nutrition ( produce Danone research ) administer via program Flocare enteral feeding pump . The pump connect opaque branch system connect nasojejunal tube seal container . Patients either allocated experimental group , blind branched system lead enteral nutrition via nasojejunal tube patient . Via route , patient experimental group receive enteral nutrition , directly surgery . In patient allocate control group , blind branched system lead enteral nutrition container . Consequently , feed pump start surgery , patient control group receive nutrition . In group , pump enteral nutrition stop 6 hour surgery normal intake resume . Based previous result power calculation perform . For POI sample size least 91 patient per group need base power 0.8 alpha 0.05 . For AL reduction AL least 75 % observe previous clinical study . Using power 0.8 drop-out percentage 5 % total 140 patient need per group . Since perioperative nutrition new concept , safety analysis perform inclusion 40 patient feasibility safety preoperative nutrition assess . The effect size determine base previous study substantial . Considering size effect , interim-analysis perform inclusion 140 patient . All analyse do accord intention-to-treat approach randomize patient include , regardless adherence study protocol . Occurrences primary secondary endpoint compare treatment group . Results present risk ratio correspond 95 % confidence interval . A two-tailed P &lt; 0.05 consider statistically significant . To compare group , data test normal distribution unpaired T-test perform appropriate , otherwise Mann-Whitney U Chi-square test . SPSS ( Statistical Package Social Sciences version 20 ) use analyze data . The investigator respect Dutch Scientific Code conduct regard collection storage data . The investigator hereby mind criterion retrievability , accessibility interchangeability data . The investigator obtain write informed consent patient , state record use save research purpose minimum 15 year . Anonymity confidentiality data guarantee compliant CBP ( Commission Protection Personal Data ) guideline . Thus , variable register anonymously , via secure code , personally identifiable information retrieve . The investigator verify completeness patient Data Management Strategy via Data Archiving Networked Services checklist .
