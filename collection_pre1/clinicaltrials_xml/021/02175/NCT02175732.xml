	<brief_title>Reducing Distress And Improving Glycemic Control In Adults With Type 1 Diabetes</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>A behavioral randomize control trial ( RCT ) high diabetes distress . In Phase 2 propose practical two-arm , nine month RCT reduce high DD improve glycemic control disease management . We compare two active intervention : ( 1 ) Type 1 diabetes education protocol ( 'KnowIt ' ) bring together new advance diabetes education behavioral management , ( 2 ) A DD-reduction protocol ( 'OnTrack ' ) help identify address personal stress strain diabetes . Patients study arm receive three month intervention six month follow-up . Each arm include one-day in-person group workshop 8-10 participant ; four real-time , 65-minute web-based group meeting ; six individual telephone call group leader . The web-based meeting occur two , four , eight 12 week workshop . Four personal phone call occur one week prior web-based group meeting provide support encourage participation group meeting ; two personal phone call occur week 20 28 ( month thee nine ) maintain support participation . Assessment take place baseline , 12 36 week initial workshop . Hypotheses : H1 . The OnTrack arm superior KnowIt primary outcome ( HbA1c DD ) secondary outcome ( diabetes management ) 12 36 week . H2 . ( mediator hypothesis ) . Differential between-group change primary outcome mediate change self-efficacy fear hypoglycemia across time . H3 . ( moderator hypothesis ) . The difference two study arm change primary outcome qualify : ( ) patient characteristic , strong positive effect patient young age , short diabetes duration , high baseline distress HbA1c , BMI , frequent hypoglycemic episode ; ( b ) intervention engagement , strong positive effect patient attend call high use intervention medium . We test finding null hypothesis difference two group . All statistical test two tail . Statistical Analyses : We perform analysis determine whether differential attrition occur patient characteristic . Likelihood base approach ( e.g . GLMMs ) multiple imputation use handle miss data . Background demographic examine describe sample include multivariate analysis relate outcome p &lt; .2 , differ treatment arm , associate dropout . Correlations among variable examine redundant measure combine eliminate avoid multicollinearity . We select potential moderator retain p &lt; .2 reassess model assess significant interaction . Assessment Primary &amp; Secondary Outcomes : We fit regression model cross-sectional longitudinal outcome . Demographics compare two arm baseline . Comparisons OnTrack KnowIt change DD HbA1c estimate linear mixed model generalize linear model generalize estimate equation ( e.g. , SAS PROC MIXED ROC GENMOD , SAS Institute Inc. , 1999 ) . Generally , seek model longitudinally trajectory outcome function time , intervention group assignment , group-by-time interaction . We begin fit base model , minimum covariates , longitudinal model , restrict residual covariance structure . Additional covariates consider . Similar model use examine secondary outcome diet , physical activity , self-management , e.g. , BG variability ) . We examine change baseline outcome dependent variable . In addition test groups-by-time interaction term , custom contrast assess group difference time point . Mediating &amp; Moderating Analyses . These analysis elaborate observe treatment effect . A first set determine whether demographic stratum , use medium , dose effect moderate intervention effect . Each outcome regress onto measure intervention , baseline covariates interaction intervention group assignment . A second set analysis test specific mediation hypothesis . Cost Estimates . To calculate per-participant cost intervention , first adjust cost obtain project record inflation constant US dollar final year study use Bureau Labor Statistics ' Consumer Price Index . Capital cost annualized discounted investment interest rate final year program . Fixed cost allocate among participant arm , divide group leader cost number respective participant . After adjustment allocation complete , newly calculate per-participant cost combine additional cost compute total per-participant cost intervention . These cost estimate use project cost future dissemination implementation effort . Power Analysis . Sample size power estimate comparison OnTrack KnowIt Phase 2 base alpha = 0.05 2-sided t-tests change baseline 12 , 24 36 week . Estimates mean ( SDs ) follow-up similar study type 1 adult ( 48 , 51 ) previous experience REDEEM suggest effect size small moderate , 0.35 .40 SD unit difference . A sample 116 participant assign OnTrack KnowIt provide power exceed 0.80 test primary outcome DD HbA1c . This allow detectable mean difference change baseline magnitude 0.48 HbA1c . At project sample size group , power discriminate OnTrack KnowIt least 80 % . This sample size also allow u determine medium effect size mediation effect ( H2 ) fear hypoglycemia difference 15 % , self-care behavior difference 17 % arm . Sample size estimate moderator effect ( H3 ) base upon group-by-moderator stratum interaction test regression model . Findings ( 48 ) show between-group difference age range -1.2 0.55 . Based upon estimate , propose study power detect moderator effect , conditional main effect , equal 0.93 . Our preliminary finding group baseline HbA1c interaction literature suggest power least 0.80 . Procedures : Following screen assess initial eligibility interest , research assistant email baseline survey use Qualtrics unique study ID number assign researcher . The survey begin consent form complete electronically . The research assistant also email patient PDF copy consent form brochure assist patient fully consider participation , retain copy study consent form keep reference . Baseline assessment ( assessment 1 ) : Following informed consent Qualtrics , participant navigate complete baseline survey . The survey include Type 1 Diabetes Distress Scale ( T1-DDS ) , plus scale assess self-management , eat weight pattern , medication adherence , mindfulness , problem solving , depression quality life . Once participant complete survey , T1-DDS score calculate . If meet inclusion threshold ( mean score 2.0 ) participant send slip baseline blood draw measure HbA1c cholesterol level community laboratory ( Quest ) choose . Participants whose mean diabetes distress score ( measure use T1-DDS scale ) 2.0 informed letter phone call longer eligible . Participants meet threshold severe symptom depression ( PHQ score 15 ) also inform letter phone call research assistant , administer script encourage participant seek help symptom screen suicide risk . Laboratory result review determine whether HbA1c result meet inclusion criterion ( 7.5 % ) . Participants meet HbA1c criterion randomize research assistant . Upon completion baseline assessment participant compensate via gift card ( pro-rated partial baseline completion ) survey completion blood draw . Group workshop ( week 0 ) : Participants randomly allocate either OnTrack KnowIT . Both program length contain frequency type event , however content differs deliver separate , trained interventionists . We plan deliver workshop 8-10 participant . Each workshop deliver trained interventionist workshop . Participants opportunity participate group discussion share experience throughout workshop reflect material deliver . During workshops height , weight blood pressure participant ( require baseline characteristic assessment outcome analysis ) record private location one attend member study team . Participants group receive copy baseline HbA1c result , cholesterol result blood pressure result . In addition , participant OnTrack group receive copy diabetes distress score profile ( since diabetes distress specifically target intervention arm ) . At end workshop , participant group write brief Action Plan allow participant develop series personal goal enhance diabetes management . Participants group give copy workshop content end workshops reference . Group web meeting individual phone call ( week 1- 12 ) : Following workshop , participant receive four 10-15 minute individual phone call group facilitator one , three , seven 11 week follow initial workshop , mutually agree time . The purpose call review participant progress Action Plans enable participant discuss challenge one-on-one facilitator . Participants also take part four 65 minute online web group meeting use WebEx , two , four , eight 12 week workshop . WebEx allow individual connect online meeting use video audio . The purpose meeting reinforce build upon workshop content , allow participant support raise challenge experience reach Action Plan goal . Assessment 2 ( week 12 / 3 month ) : Participants ask complete survey blood draw complete baseline . A research assistant email personalize confidential link survey via Qualtrics , mail lab slip blood draw local community laboratory participant ' preference . MAINTENTANCE PHASE ( WEEKS 13 - 39 ) : Following workshop , participant receive two 10-15 minute individual phone call group facilitator 20 28 week follow workshop review progress Action Plans . Assessment 3 ( week 39 / 9 month ) : Participants ask complete survey blood draw complete baseline assessment 2 .</detailed_description>
