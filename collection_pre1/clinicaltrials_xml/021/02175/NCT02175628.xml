	<brief_summary>Purpose : This study evaluate new ultrasound imaging technology call acoustic angiography . Acoustic angiography use ultrasound contrast agent , already FDA approve use cardiology , enhance image blood vessel . Since acoustic angiography use ultrasound , x-rays , patient expose ionize radiation , unlike traditional angiography mammography . Specific goal evaluate quality image provide acoustic angiography human breast , furthermore evaluate whether acoustic angiography provide additional diagnostic information traditional ultrasound could provide improvement assess breast lesion . Specifically , additional diagnostic information hopefully enable u reduce false positive test discriminate lethal cancer non-lethal disease . Participants : The investigator recruit 60 patient UNC Breast Clinic undergo core needle biopsy surgical biopsy ( BIRADS 4 5 breast lesion ) . Procedures ( method ) : Acoustic Angiography imaging perform conjunction standard diagnostic imaging , include b-mode ultrasound . Then , reader study conduct compare modality . Finally , image analyze image processing technique determine quantitative metric exhibit blood vessel morphology image . These metric utilize develop `` malignancy score '' equation predict malignancy lesion .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Increasing sensitivity specificity diagnostic imaging patient high risk breast cancer could provide substantial clinical benefit improve diagnosis , prevent over-treatment , reduce healthcare cost . Acoustic angiography new type contrast enhance ultrasound image specifically sensitive microvascular structure density . It evaluate tumor micro-vasculature may provide powerful prognostic tool diagnosis breast cancer , eventually treatment evaluation . Sixty patient clinical surgical breast biopsy base result pre-study standard care ( SOC ) image recruit UNC Breast Clinic participation study . The primary objective single arm study compare sensitivity specificity acoustic angiography traditional b-mode ultrasound distinction malignant versus benign breast lesion . Secondary objective include comparison area curve ( AUC ) acoustic angiography versus b-mode ultrasound , comparison radiologist preference two image technique 3 lesion characteristic , quantification vessel tortuosity base acoustic angiography image result . These metric use develop predictive model malignancy subsequently compare result radiology review .</detailed_description>
