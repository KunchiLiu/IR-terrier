	<brief_summary>Interscalene plexus block widely use technique provide anesthesia analgesia surgery upper extremity ( shoulder upper arm ) ; standard-of-care many institution worldwide . Local anesthetic inject around nerve supply arm ( Plexus brachialis ) specific location arm ( scalenus muscle , thus call `` interscalene plexus block '' ) . The optimal volume injection regard efficacy , safety avoidance untoward effect subject intense debate long time . In spite evidence small volume ( 5 7 ml ) effective adequate postoperative analgesia , large volume 40 ml still frequently use many practice . However , use large dos , adverse event know occur increased frequency , include paralysis diaphragm spread local anesthetic spinal cord . This study intend help evaluate effect small large injection local anesthetic around brachial plexus , correlate distribution clinical efficacy , block duration , possible side effect . It randomize , control , observer-blinded trial ; patient undergo shoulder upper arm surgery randomly allocate receive either 5mls 20mls local anesthetic interscalene plexus block . Magnetic resonance imaging perform immediately afterwards , follow series neurological exams hospital stay . Test lung function ( spirometry ) ultrasound diaphragm use evaluate effect block respiratory mechanic .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Background : Interscalene plexus blockade ( ISB ) frequently use surgery upper limb . The use ultrasound significantly reduce time onset total volume local anesthetic comparison nerve localization stimulators . ( 1-4 ) The introduction technique correlate decreased volume effective local anesthetic 40 milliliter 10 milliliter less . ( 3-4 ) As injection site ISB locate close proximity anatomical structure spinal cord , spread local anesthetic could potentially cause adverse event , include contralateral blockade total spinal anesthesia . Case report complication publish previously . ( 5-11 ) In recently publish study show phenomenon epidural spread reproduce cadaver seem positively correlate injection-volumes exceed 10 milliliter . ( 12 ) Moreover , observe trend towards cranial spread contrast agent investigate specimen along course nerval root towards spinal cord . In another cadaveric study Orebauch et al. , cranial epidural spread also detectable follow injection dye nerval root brachial plexus . ( 13 ) Magnetic resonance imaging yet use visualization spread local anaesthetic ISB . Given ultrasound provide excellent visualization target-structures regional anesthesia therefore enables physicians place injection needle enormous accuracy , question arise whether critical volume local anesthetic increase complication epidural spread consequence contralateral blockade . The aim study confirm finding cadaveric study vivo show frequency epidural spread correlate injection increase volumes local anesthetic . Primary endpoint : Spread local anesthetic epidural space Secondary endpoint : - Contralateral epidural spread . - Spread local anesthetic phrenic nerve . - Bed side spirometry ultrasound investigation diaphragm PACU . - Oxygen saturation PACU - Self-reported block duration . - Self report pain score first 24 postoperative hour - Time first analgesic consumption demand . - Total analgesic consumption ( ropivacaine PCA ) .</detailed_description>
