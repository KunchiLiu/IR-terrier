	<brief_summary>Rationale : Palliative care integration treatment pathway , palliative care network institutional collaboration health service delivery seem promising approach reduce fragmentation discontinuity . Integrated Palliative Care ( IPC ) approach Europe largely unknown under-investigated . The investigator aim explore experience patient advanced cancer , Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease ( COPD ) Chronic Heart Failure ( CHF ) , family professional caregiver within IPC . This include perceive quality life , quality care , burden/rewards care give , symptom collaboration caregiver patient 's care network . Objectives : To investigate patient advanced cancer , COPD CHF , family professional caregiver within selection IPC initiatives Belgium , Germany , Hungary , The Netherlands United Kingdom experience care delivery last phase disease . - To investigate opinion patient family caregiver ( continuity ) quality care deliver - To investigate patient rate symptom quality life - To investigate family caregiver rate burden / reward care give - To investigate care network patient organise respect type , property quality relationship patient family / professional caregiver Study design : Longitudinal multiple embed case study . Study population : Adult patient advance cancer , COPD , CHF care IPC initiatives five participate country , family professional caregiver . The investigator aim enroll 288 patient , 288 family caregiver 192 professional caregiver total . Study parameter : Experiences IPC initiative , quality care , quality life , perceive symptom , perceive collaboration professional caregiver , burden reward care give . Methods : Semi-structured interview , patient diary , Social Network Analysis follow questionnaire : Palliative care Outcome Scale ; Canhelp Lite , Caregiver Reaction Assessment .

	<detailed_description>Monitoring Quality Assurance : Training researcher : In order ensure best quality study , researcher take part least two compulsory training session . During train ethical professional issue also discuss , : - ethical issue ( e.g . handle vulnerable group interview situation ) - data management ( protection privacy medical research record ) - interview training order standardise interview technique - analyse qualitative quantitative data , synthesize research ( analyse researcher partner country ) . Qualitative data : Interviews tape record transcribed verbatim , evaluate content analysis use qualitative software package NVivo 10 . After two pilot interview responsible researcher partner country discuss preliminary code book . These code theme form basis coding strategy throughout data collection data analysis . Analysis ongoing throughout fieldwork order allow emergent theme feed back data collection . During data collection new relevant code include code book . The interview cod national language five country examination . This result five country report experience patient advanced cancer , COPD CHF , family professional caregiver within selection IPC initiatives particular country care delivery last phase disease . These country report translate English analyse result one overall report . Quantitative data : Statistical analysis perform use SPSS Statistics 20 . The investigator use descriptive statistic frequency , crosstabs , mean , standard deviation . The quantitative data use background description population . The overall analysis involve synthesis qualitative quantitative data . During analysis phase investigator integrate quantitative variable , qualitative finding evaluation order get complete insight topic . Treatments miss data : The investigator use follow approach miss data : omit question miss data perform analyse question remain . Missing data account analysis implication make clear . Handling storage data document : The confidentiality data collect within patient study secure accord national European regulation . Data patient anonymised disclosure information study third party limit undertake legitimate peer review scientific ethical aspect study , co-worker patient , consent obtain customary medical care provide . Patient confidentiality welfare always maintain high priority . All data gather document store anonymously . Each patient , family caregiver professional caregiver allocate unique identification number . No identify information link person identification number keep data base . The investigator analyze data identification number . Patient data store protected database log function . The master database keep centre research coordinator Radboud University Medical Centre . Assessment progress quality : Researchers ( fieldwork IPC initiatives involve ) report fieldwork progress ( patient recruitment data collection ) quality data collect every week lead researcher ( responsible research particular country ) . Contents progress quality report : 1 . Number person ( patient family caregiver ) involve 2 . Number complete questionnaire interview 3 . Quality complete questionnaire interview 4 . Attrition ( death patient , early terminate interview ) 5 . Other research-related event ( e.g . delay ) Lead researcher summarize research ' report send progress quality report study principal investigator every month ( The study principal investigator responsible research framework InSup-C project . ) The study principal investigator organize 3‚Äêmonthly structure ( tele ) conference monitor progress quality report Project Management Office ( PMO ) . The PMO work supervision Executive Board project . The PMO provide Executive Board project process report least every six month frequently necessary . Annual progress report : The Principal Investigator submit summary progress study accredit ethical committee year . Information provide date inclusion first subject , number subject include number subject complete trial , ( serious ) adverse event , problem , amendment . End study report : The Principal Investigator notify accredit ethical committee end study within period eight week . The end study define last study participant 's last interview . In case study end prematurely , responsible researcher notify accredit ethical committee within 15 day , include reason premature termination . Within one year end study , responsible researcher submit final study report result study , include publications/abstracts study , accredit ethical committee . Public disclosure publication policy : Public disclosure publication policy regulate InSup-C . Dissemination Strategy ( October 2013 ) , available request . An outline publication timeline suggest topic , lead work package author scientific target journal detailed Dissemination Strategy . An interactive website develop . The website signpost study result become available . Monitoring level relate risk classification : As previous section estimate study negligible risk , minimal monitoring take place . Table 4 display activity monitor perform . Monitoring conduct qualified monitor knowledge current legislation regulation independent study . Findings report coordinate investigator Radboud umc fix format . If monitor identifies substantial and/or frequent fault , report head department and/or company board .</detailed_description>
