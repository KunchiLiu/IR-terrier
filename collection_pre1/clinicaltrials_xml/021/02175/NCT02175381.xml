	<brief_title>Carboplatin Plus Gemcitabine Elderly Patients With Stage IV NSCLC</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>About 50 % newly diagnose case NSCLC concern patient older 65 year , 30-40 % case diagnose patient old 70 year . Furthermore , recent data suggest last decade , incidence mortality NSCLC decrease young patient , increase among old patient . Based observation , becomes clear NSCLC represent significant health problem elderly patient . However , elderly patient frequently underrepresented clinical trial evaluate new treatment NSCLC . Indeed , 75 % patient old 65 year metastatic NSCLC never receive kind chemotherapy daily clinical practice . In elderly patient lack prospective data regard role platinum-based doublet . It clear whether elderly patient gain survival benefit platinum-based doublet whether chemotherapeutic regimen result significant increase toxicity . There clear need prospectively evaluate tolerability efficacy platinum-based doublet first-line chemotherapy old NSCLC patient . On basis would interest initiate phase I/II study gemcitabine/carboplatin combination first line treatment old NSCLC patient .</detailed_description>
