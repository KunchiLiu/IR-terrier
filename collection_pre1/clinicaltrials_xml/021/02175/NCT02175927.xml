	<brief_title>High Dose Amoxicillin Versus Tetracycline Second-line Treatment Resistant Helicobacter Pylori Infection</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Helicobacter pylori successful human pathogen infecting estimate 50 % global population , associate spectrum disease state , include chronic gastritis , duodenal gastric ulcer , gastric adenocarcinoma , gastric mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue lymphoma ( MALToma ) . Most Consensus Conferences Clinical Guidelines recommend prescription triple therapy include proton pump inhibitor ( PPI ) clarithromycin either amoxicillin metronidazole , first-line treatment . However , effectiveness triple-therapy regimen seem diminished time , largely result emerge resistance organism clarithromycin . Avoiding problem due antibiotic resistance become important issue decide second-line rescue therapy H. pylori infection Bismuth-containing quadruple therapy use widely second-line therapy H. pylorus infection , recommend Maastricht IV Consensus Conference report . Quadruple therapy achieve high rate eradication success second-line treatment . A meta-analysis quadruple therapy show metronidazole resistance limited effect outcome adequate dosage duration use . This meta-analysis also show compliance quadruple therapy high . Classical bismuth-based quadruple therapy consist PPI , bismuth , tetracycline metronidazole . This regiment meet propose criterion second-line treatment : contain key antibiotic original regimen ( clarithromycin ) , treatment affect clarithromycin resistance , metronidazole resistance vitro affect outcome quadruple therapy significantly , compliance regimen high regimen effective part world . But regiment high rate side effect tetracycline . Amoxicillin low resistance rate well low percentage side effect . The replacement tetracycline high dose amoxicillin classical bismuth-containing quadruple therapy may better choice . Therefore , randomize trial compare eradication rate 14-day high dose amoxicillin metronidazole base bismuth-containing quadruple therapy classical quadruple therapy second-line Helicobacter pylorus treatment .</detailed_description>
