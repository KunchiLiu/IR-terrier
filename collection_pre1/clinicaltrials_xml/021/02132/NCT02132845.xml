	<brief_summary>This randomize clinical trial study well next generation sequence target-directed therapy work treat patient cancer . Next generation sequence test screen mutation cancer relate gene . Target-directed therapy type treatment use drug substance identify attack specific type cancer cell may less harm normal cell . Next generation sequencing may help identify specific type cancer cell .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Next Generation Sequence Target-Directed Therapy Treating Patients With Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . Overall ( composite ) response rate ( ORR ) . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . 4-month progression free survival ( PFS ) . II . Mutation rate . III . Adverse event rate/severity . IV . Overall survival . TERTIARY OBJECTIVES : I . Targeted agent rate . II . Available protocol rate . III . Protocol enrollment rate . IV . Disease site influence . OUTLINE : Patients randomize 1 2 treatment arm . ARM A : Patients undergo collection tissue blood sample analysis via next generation sequence . Patients receive standard care therapy base discretion treat physician . ARM B : Patients undergo collection tissue blood sample analysis via next generation sequence . Based result next generation sequencing , patient receive target-directed therapy . After completion study treatment , patient follow every 3 month 2 year , every 6 month 2 year , annually thereafter .</detailed_description>
