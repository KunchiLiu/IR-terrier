	<brief_summary>This project two primary goal . The first goal scientific understanding marijuana abuse examine two recognize factor marijuana use relapse : ( 1 ) stress/anxiety ( 2 ) atypical reactivity marijuana-related stimulus ( e.g. , attentional bias ) . The second goal attenuate influence stress/anxiety attentional bias marijuana stimulus via administration buspirone . Buspirone uniquely suit project effect neurotransmitter system know modulate stress/anxiety attentional bias .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Buspirone , Stress , Attentional Bias Marijuana Cues</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>For nearly 40 year marijuana remain widely use illicit drug US , 50 % first-time user &lt; age 18 . Marijuana account ≈ 60 % illicit substance use disorder ( SUD ) US , bear percent large US public health burden among illicit substance . Across preclinical , human laboratory , clinical interview data , compel evidence phenomenon cue reactivity relate drug seek relapse . Attentional bias measurable component cue reactivity , operationally define differential attention ( e.g. , reaction time difference ) towards drug-related stimulus vs. neutral stimulus . This phenomenon demonstrate SUD population across many class abuse drug , include alcohol , nicotine , stimulant , opiate , - importantly - marijuana . Cue reactivity attentional bias exacerbate acute chronic stress anxiety . Notably , stress well-documented predictor marijuana abuse marijuana relapse . Therapeutic intervention attenuate attentional bias marijuana cue potentially important component treatment marijuana SUD . Due well-documented association stress , intervention simultaneously address stress attentional bias could uniquely efficacious . Currently , pharmacotherapies exist marijuana SUD , none presently know address attentional bias marijuana cue . This application explore potential anxiolytic buspirone modify attentional bias stress . Buspirone unique compound mark modulation serotonin ( 5-HT1A ) dopamine D3 receptor . Importantly , 5-HT1A receptor know play key role stress relate anxiety , preclinical work indicate D3 antagonist significantly decrease cue reactivity number abuse drug . This combination effect suggest buspirone may advantageous target stress attentional bias factor contribute problem marijuana use . Accordingly , project seek examine effect chronic buspirone administration attentional bias stress/anxiety marijuana SUD . Using laboratory-based methodology sensitive attentional bias towards marijuana cue well validated measure stress anxiety , examine buspirone 's unique mechanism action ( ) produce attenuation attentional bias marijuana cue , ( b ) pronounce condition attentional bias relate high level stress anxiety .</detailed_description>
