	<brief_summary>Aortic stenosis condition whereby one heart valves ( aortic valve ) become narrowed , due calcium deposition , time . This lead chest pain , heart failure sudden death . It common valve disease require surgery develop world population become increasingly old , predict prevalence aortic stenosis double next 20 year . Currently treatment replacement aortic valve . Whilst excellent treatment , everyone suitable . The primary objective study determine whether 2 drug use treatment osteoporosis ( condition bone thin ) halt/retard progression aortic stenosis . This basis study suggest altered regulation calcium metabolism may important mechanism perpetuate disease . Both drug work reduce calcium release bloodstream bone therefore calcification aortic valve . 150 patient therefore randomly allocate either trial drug denosumab , bisphosphonate ( alendronic acid ) , placebo . Positron Emission Tomography ( PET ) scan technique biochemically active molecule inject take site ongoing calcification activity emit radiation detect PET scanner . We previously show technique demonstrate area newly develop calcification aortic valve . We therefore propose patient receive bisphosphonates denosumab reduce evidence active calcification slow progression disease two year assess Echocardiography ( ultrasound ) change calcium score ( quantity calcium aortic valve measure use Computed Tomography [ CT ] ) . The data study use design large trial .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Study Investigating Effect Drugs Used Treat Osteoporosis Progression Calcific Aortic Stenosis .</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>BACKGROUND Aortic Stenosis common cause valvular heart disease valve cusps become progressively calcified . The available treatment aortic valve replacement previous attempt provide medical therapy modify disease process prove unsuccessful . Pathophysiology Aortic Stenosis . The initiating event believe caused mechanical damage cell line valve process similar occurs atherosclerosis . However propagate mechanism likely active calcification . In support , grow body pre-clinical clinical data indicate treatment osteoporosis , work prevent breakdown bone therefore calcium release blood , reduce calcium deposition ( calcification ) blood vessel . These agent therefore hold considerable promise novel therapy aortic stenosis . Denosumab Aortic Stenosis Denosumab drug prevents bone cell call osteoclast break bone release calcium blood . For reason use treat osteoporosis . It work specific pathway believe important regulating calcium release bone . Mice engineer defect within pathway find increase bone breakdown blood vessel calcification . Furthermore two study assess role pathway patient aortic valve disease . Both study also demonstrate altered regulation within pathway Bisphosphonates Aortic Stenosis Bisphosphonates group drug widely use treatment osteoporosis also prevent bone breakdown osteoclast . They also show important cardiovascular effect consistent reduction calcification blood vessel aortic valve . This part appear consequence inhibition bone breakdown also reduce production key inflammatory substance implicate early stage aortic stenosis . We plan use alendronic acid bisphosphonate commonly use management osteoporosis . PET CT scan Aortic Stenosis . 18F-NaF ( Sodium Fluoride ) biochemical compound preferentially bind region newly develop calcification emits radiation . When used combination Computed Tomography ( CT ) enable localize . This way able identify area newly develop calcification aortic valve . In previous study institution , demonstrate could quantify 18F-NaF uptake aortic valve progressive rise activity increase disease severity . We find At 1 year , baseline 18F-NaF uptake emerge powerful predictor progression aortic valve calcification . Following analysis 2 year follow data , 18F-NaF emerge independent predictor aortic valve replacement cardiovascular mortality Therefore finding lead u propose 1 . Calcification key driver Aortic Stenosis Progression 2 . We want reduce calcification activity use Denosumab Biphosphonates 3 . We predict reduce 18F-NaF signal disease progression Echocardiography CT. STUDY DESIGN This double-blind , randomize , placebo-control trial denosumab alendronic acid patient aortic stenosis . Study population randomization We aim recruit 170 patient total non-rheumatic calcific aortic stenosis . 20 patient participate scan-rescan reproducibility study . They proceed randomization stage . Of remain 150 patient , 75 subject randomize ( 2:1 ) either subcutaneous denosumab 60 mg ( n=50 ) match placebo ( n=25 ) every 6 month ; 75 randomize ( 2:1 ) oral alendronate 70 mg ( n=50 ) match placebo ( n=25 ) weekly Assessment follow All subject undergo standardized clinical assessment baseline every six month . Data collect respect symptomatic status , trial safety endpoint , routine biochemical profiling , biomarkers , quality life questionnaires electrocardiography . Aortic stenosis severity assess baseline every 6 month echocardiography perform single , dedicate sonographer maximize reproducibility . Severity assess use peak mean aortic valve pressure gradient ( technique use monitor aortic stenosis severity ; high pressure gradient across aortic valve severe narrowing ) . We also calculate aortic valve area calcification score . PET CT CT calcium scoring . Both perform use combine PET 128-multidetector CT scanner ( Biograph 128 , Siemens ) . CT calcium score measure amount calcium valve assess baseline , 6 month 2 year . It act additional marker disease severity progression alongside Echocardiography . Those heart rate &gt; 65 /min give heart-slowing medication ( beta blocker ) deem safe . The region aortic valve scan breath hold . 18F-NaF PET uptake measure baseline , 6 month assess early impact intervention valvular calcification activity . PET image difficult interpret tell radiation come . For reason PET need perform alongside CT give u image aortic valve . By superimpose two image able identify 'PET signal ' originate . To ensure optimal image quality patient require adhere high fat , low carbohydrate diet 48 hour prior scan . The subject cannulate enable injection 18F-NaF tracer . They rest quiet environment 60 minute enable tracer reach valve transfer image suite . Those heart rate &gt; 65 /min give beta-blockade deem suitable safe . This routine practice cardiac CT. A scout CT perform allow optimal alignment PET CT scanner ( sure radiation detect come aortic valve ) . The patient ask lie still 30 minute PET data acquire . Finally 'CT angiogram ' perform aortic valve . This involve image acquisition follow injection radio opaque dye aorta . This allow accurate localization PET signal . The additional twenty patient undergo repeat PET/CT imaging within 2 week baseline scan investigate scan-rescan reproducibility 18F-NaF PET signal . They proceed trial beyond stage avoid facing increase radiation exposure .</detailed_description>
