	<brief_summary>There significant association autonomic dysfunction symptom experience NAFLD patient mediate increased systemic inflammation insulin resistance , result deteriorate quality life affect patient ; fatigue symptom drive worsen autonomic dysfunction patient . We aim describe severity autonomic dysfunction ( AD ) non-alcoholic fatty liver disease ( NAFLD ) relationship AD symptom experience NAFLD patient ( fatigue , chronic pain , depression , sleep disturbance , cognitive dysfunction ) , quality life NAFLD patient . We also hope examine impact systemic inflammation insulin resistance mediator manifestation AD symptom experience NAFLD patient .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Aim 1 . Describe severity AD NAFLD relationship AD symptom experience NAFLD patient ( fatigue , chronic pain , depression , sleep disturbance , cognitive dysfunction ) ( Aim 1a ) quality life NAFLD patient ( Aim 1b ) . Primary screen inclusion/exclusion criterion do VCUHS clinic . Subjects meet inclusion criterion approach study participation routine NAFLD clinic visit . Those agree participate study return study visit CCTR Clinical Research Services . All subject ask fast avoid caffeine 12 hour prior study visit . Demographic clinical data collect study coordinator . After focused exam , conduct hepatologist determine health status participant , PI research nurse interview participant assess symptom AD ( Aim 1 ) . Blood ( 20 ml ) sample collect via venipuncture serum plasma inflammatory marker IR ( Aim 2 ) . Aim 2 . Examine impact systemic inflammation ( SI ) insulin resistance ( IR ) mediator manifestation AD symptom experience NAFLD patient . Increased presence adipocytes may produce high , chronic level cytokine IL-6 TNF-α result high level APRPs contribute overall inflammation well cognitive decline fatigue . Secondly , elevated level IL-6 TNF-α low level CTRPs exacerbate IR , AD , muscle cardiac problem report NAFLD . Through use plasma analysis , level cytokine IL-6 , TNF-α , APRPs perform high throughput BioPlex® assay ( Bio-Rad Laboratories , Inc. : Hercules , CA ) . We extensive experience type assay generate data use human sample numerous study conduct Center Excellence Biobehavioral Approaches Symptom Management ( CEBASM ) School Nursing . CTRP family member also express plasma detectible level . We perform ELISA analysis compare circulate level various CTRPs use commercially available CTRP ELISA kits/reagents . Insulin resistance ( IR ) assess HOMO-IR utilize fast glucose insulin .</detailed_description>
