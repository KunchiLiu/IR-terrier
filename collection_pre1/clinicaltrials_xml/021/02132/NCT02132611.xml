	<brief_title>Coronary Orbital Atherectomy System Study</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This prospective , single-arm , multi-center , global study design evaluate performance Diamondback 360® Coronary Orbital Atherectomy System Micro Crown ( OAS Micro Crown ) treat de novo , severely calcified coronary lesion .</detailed_description>
	<criteria>Subjects must 18 old . Subjects must clinical indication coronary intervention . CK CKMB must less equal upper limit lab normal value within 8 hour prior procedure . The target lesion must de novo coronary lesion previously treat interventional procedure . The target vessel must native coronary artery . The target vessel reference diameter must &gt; = 2.5mm &lt; = 4.0 mm . The lesion length must exceed 40 mm . The target vessel must TIMI flow three ( 3 ) baseline . The target lesion must fluoroscopic , IVUS OCT evidence severe calcium deposit lesion site . The lesion must crossable study guide wire . Inability understand study requirement history noncompliance medical advice . Unwilling sign COAST ICF . History cognitive mental health status would interfere study participation . Currently enrol preapproval investigational study . Female subject pregnant plan become pregnant within study period . Known hypersensitivity contraindication aspirin , heparin , ticlopidine clopidogrel without adequate alternative medication . Known sensitivity contrast medium , adequately premedicated . Diagnosed chronic renal failure unless hemodialysis , serum creatinine level &gt; 2.5 mg/dl .
