	<brief_summary>Healthy volunteer recruit participate ten-week double-blinded crossover trial . The trial consist two , three-week period intermittent fasting , subject receive either antioxidant supplementation placebo , order randomly determine . A one-week preconditioning precede invention period , two week `` wash-out '' period follow first intervention period . Serum-based assay perform assess level reactive oxidant specie , antioxidant gene , sirtuins , marker mitochondrial biogenesis age . The investigator hypothesize intermittent fast diet healthy young volunteer improve marker cellular age beneficial effect abrogate supplementation antioxidant . This study proof-of-principle study shed light mechanism effect IF anti-aging dietary intervention absence weight loss . It inform design dietary intervention effective improve marker age feasible patient practice long-term basis .</brief_summary>
