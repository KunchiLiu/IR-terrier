	<brief_summary>This 5-part dose-escalation study determine maximum tolerate dose ( MTD ) /maximum administer dose ( MAD ) MK-4166 participant advance solid tumor . In Part A , MK-4166 dos escalate quickly successive cohort base safety event may progress Part B , preliminary MTD identify . Based safety event study may progress Part C MTD confirm . In Part D , participant receive escalate dos MK-4166 plus fix dose pembrolizumab ( MK-3475 ) 200 mg determine MTD MK-4166 combination pembrolizumab . Based safety event Part D , study may progress Part E MTD MK-4166 combination pembrolizumab confirm . With Amendments 05/06 , dose confirmation Part E ( combination MK-4166 pembrolizumab ) limit participant advance malignant melanoma . The primary study hypotheses MK-4166 single agent MK-4166 combination pembrolizumab acceptable safety tolerability .</brief_summary>
