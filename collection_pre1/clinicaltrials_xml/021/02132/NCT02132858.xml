	<brief_title>Genetic Mutations Blood Tissue Samples Predicting Response Treatment Patients With Locally Advanced Rectal Cancer Undergoing Chemoradiation</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To evaluate tumor-specific mutation ( ) detect use CancerCode™ mutation panel predictor pathologic response chemoradiation patient rectal adenocarcinoma undergoing chemoradiation . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . To assess feasibility utilize biopsy specimen locally advance rectal adenocarcinoma perform CancerCode™ mutation panel genetic testing . II . To assess disease-free survival ( DFS ) overall survival ( OS ) patient treat study . III . To collect pilot data regard clonal heterogeneity rectal adenocarcinoma , relationship heterogeneity treatment response . IV . To evaluate treatment response utilize multiple fludeoxyglucose F 18-positron emission tomography ( FDG-PET ) parameter include heterogeneity textural feature exploratory study . OUTLINE : Patients undergo collection blood tissue sample analysis via sequence . After completion study , patient follow every 3 month 3 year .</detailed_description>
