	<brief_summary>The VHA estimate 15,000 Veterans incur stroke year . As population older Veterans grows , stroke become increasingly important problem VHA . Recovery walk function common goal stroke survivor . The propose study test whether train accurate walking task engage damage supraspinal motor pathway effective training steady state walking . The investigator expect train accurate task effective , thereby improve walk function Veteran stroke survivor reduce burden care place family VHA . Furthermore , rehabilitation approach accomplish comparable cost exist rehabilitation approach , important give VHA invest $ 88 million per year toward outpatient care , include physical rehabilitation , first six month stroke . This research also implications rehabilitation neurologically injured population , include traumatic brain injury incomplete spinal cord injury .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Current approach rehabilitation walk follow stroke sufficiently restore mobility function . For instance , few 50 % individual stroke-induced walk dysfunction recover ability walk independently community . New breakthrough rehabilitation need target motor impairment responsible poor walk function individual post-stroke . Functional recovery occur response task-specific neuroplasticity damage brain circuitry . The corticospinal tract important target neuroplasticity play important role control walk human . Research show , compare steady state walking , accurate gait modification ( ACC ) task potent behavioral stimulus activate corticospinal tract . Therefore , investigator propose train ACC task ( e.g. , obstacle crossing/avoidance , accurate foot placement , etc . ) may superior train steady state walking ( SS ) elicit corticospinal neuroplasticity recovery walk function . Most rehabilitation paradigm previously focus SS training . This largely therapists consider premature progress ACC task persistent deficit steady state walking still remain . However , reason might counter-productive , train steady state walking may sufficiently stimulate neuro-plasticity damage corticospinal pathway . In contrast , ACC train specifically design stimulate corticospinal neuroplasticity . Importantly , since ACC train target central mechanism , benefit expect generalize across walk condition . Furthermore , expect benefit stroke survivor possess least minimal residual capability activate corticospinal tract . ACC training also provide opportunity practice task analogous challenge encounter home community environment . Accordingly , strong mechanistic practical rationale ACC training . A number early study cumulatively establish excite preliminary evidence show walk function enhance train ACC task . However , prior study specifically design sufficiently power determine extent `` accurate gait modification '' ingredient crucial recovery walk function . Also know extent ACC training reduces neural impairment underlie poor walk function . The central hypothesis study ACC training superior SS training increase walk function reduce underlying neural control paretic leg adult post-stroke hemiparesis . Each intervention involve twelve week training , 3 day per week ( 36 session total ) , emphasize motor learn principle high intensity , repetition task-specificity . Assessments conduct immediately pre-intervention , immediately post-intervention follow-up session 3 month later . Walking function measure lab `` real world '' . Neural impairment measure include electromyography-based measure inter-muscular coordination corticospinal drive . The investigator expect benefit ACC train justify large randomize control trial optimize use ACC training , include time relative stroke , combination therapeutic approach , identify individual likely benefit approach . This research expect enhance walk function stroke survivor , include 15,000 Veterans suffer stroke year .</detailed_description>
