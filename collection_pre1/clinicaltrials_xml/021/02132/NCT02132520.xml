	<brief_summary>The purpose study determine whether combination low frequency repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation ( rTMS ) motor-imagery-based brain computer interface ( BCI ) train effective enhance motor recovery stroke . The PI 's hypothesis , comparison traditional physical therapy alone , subject receive supplementary rTMS BCI training show great functional improvement hand motor ability time well recovery normal motor connectivity pattern .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The goal present study develop evaluate brain base approach improve motor recovery stroke , combine rTMS BCI training . Treatments consist low frequency rTMS apply contralesional hemisphere , follow BCI train encourage activity within lesioned hemisphere . The primary objective study test main hypothesis stroke patient population . Subjects also undergo period BCI treatment completion combine rTMS BCI portion .</detailed_description>
