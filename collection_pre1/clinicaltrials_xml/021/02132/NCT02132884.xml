	<brief_summary>This randomize clinical trial study well genetic sequencing-informed target therapy work treat patient stage IIIB-IV non-small cell lung cancer . Targeted therapy type treatment use drug substance identify attack specific type tumor cell may less harm normal cell . Genetic sequencing may help identify specific type tumor cell patient non-small cell lung cancer .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Genetic Sequencing-Informed Targeted Therapy Treating Patients With Stage IIIB-IV Non-small Cell Lung Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . The three month progression free survival ( PFS ) patient treat targeted agent second line set base tumor molecular signature define CancerCode 40 % vs 20 % standard cytotoxic chemotherapy . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . Response rate ( RR ) . II . Overall survival ( OS ) . III . Proportion Arm-B patient whose second line therapy change result physician access CancerCode-50 result . IV . Concordance variant identify sequence performed sample patient collect baseline follow-up time point . OUTLINE : Patients randomize 1 2 treatment arm . ARM A : Patients receive standard care therapy base discretion treat physician . ARM B : Patients undergo collection tissue blood sample analysis via sequence . Upon disease progression follow front-line treatment , patient receive specific target therapy base mutational status obtain sequence . After completion study treatment , patient follow every 3 month 2 year , every 6 month 1 year , annually thereafter .</detailed_description>
