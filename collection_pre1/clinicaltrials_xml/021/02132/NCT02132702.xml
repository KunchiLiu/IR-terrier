	<criteria>Inpatient outpatient 15 65 year age time entry trial Motor complete ( ASIA Impairment Scale [ AIS ] A B ) , neurological level injury ( NLI ) C7L2 ( inclusive ) , motor incomplete ( AIS C D ) , NLI C1L2 ( inclusive ) , determine International Standards Neurological Classification SCI ( ISNCSCI ) Greater 30 day since SCI occur Height 157 188 centimeter ( 5 ' 2 '' 6 ' 2 '' ) individual meet criterion follow criterion may use assess per Ekso operate manual : Max hip width= 16.5 '' 42cm Upper leg length= 20 '' 24â…› '' 51cm 61.4cm Lower leg length= 19 '' 25 '' 48cm 63.4cm Maximum weight 100 kilogram ( 220 pound ) Sufficient upper extremity ( UE ) strength use front wheel walker ( FWW ) either manual muscle test ( MMT ) ( minimum triceps strength bilaterally 3/5 , shoulder abduction/adduction flexion/extension 4/5 ) and/or functional stand test FWW . Participants impaired hand function may use cuff grip . Sufficient range motion ( ROM ) achieve normal , reciprocal gait pattern , normal sit stand transition . 1 . Hip extension great equal 5 degree 2 . Knee extension great equal 5 degree 3 . Ankle dorsiflexion great equal 0 degree Demonstrate adequate trunk stability upper extremity strength utilize Ekso evidence ability complete level ( near level ) surface wheelchair mat transfer minimal assistance . Medically stable clear physician full weight bear locomotor training include 15 minute stand frame trial ass stand tolerance Have train Ekso past except one two training/demonstration session Utilizing another robotic device locomotor train Any medical issue opinion Investigator preclude full weight bear locomotor training include limited : 1 . Spinal instability ( spinal orthotic unless cleared physician ) 2 . Acute deep vein thrombosis ( DVT ) activity restriction 3 . Severe , recurrent autonomic dysreflexia ( AD ) require medical intervention 4 . Heterotopic ossification ( HO ) low extremity result ROM restriction hips knee 5 . Two pathological fracture last 48 month major weight bear bone ( femur tibia ) low extremity 6 . Hip subluxation ( xrays obtain individual injure prior 10 year age ) Any medical issue opinion Investigator would affect participant safety either due cognitive deficits/impulsivity , intolerance mild exercise factor Any issue opinion Investigator would confound result concurrent neurological injury disorder ( SCI ) factor Modified Ashworth Scale ( MAS ) = 4 majority low extremity joint ( e.g . great equal four joint movement bilateral low extremity test hip flexion/extension , knee flexion/extension , ankle dorsi/plantar flexion ) Skin integrity issue area contact device ( include abdominal ostomy ) would prohibit sit Pregnancy</criteria>
