	<brief_summary>In childhood nephrotic syndrome , kidneys leak protein , cause body swell variety possible complication infection , blood clot , kidney failure . The first-line treatment nephrotic syndrome corticosteroid . Many child respond prednisone treatment , disease come back ( relapse ) prednisone stop dose reduce . Children frequently relapse steroid dependent nephrotic syndrome risk toxicity frequent exposure corticosteroid . Currently , standard treatment frequently relapse steroid dependent nephrotic syndrome involve variety medication suppress immune system , produce serious side effect . We propose study examine effect different medication , ACTH , nephrotic syndrome . ACTH hormone naturally find body . Recently , adult study , ACTH show effective treatment nephrotic syndrome . It also show mild reversible side effect . ACTH potentially attractive therapeutic alternative treatment frequently relapse steroid dependent nephrotic syndrome child . Our study randomly assign patient frequently relapse steroid dependent nephrotic syndrome either ACTH treatment treatment . This allow u study effect ACTH disease side effect , compare patient ACTH treatment versus treatment . We hypothesize ACTH gel superior treatment maintain remission child frequently relapse steroid dependent nephrotic syndrome .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Adrenocorticotropic Hormone ( ACTH ) Frequently Relapsing Steroid Dependent Nephrotic Syndrome</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Our hypothesis follow : Hypothesis 1 : ACTH gel superior treatment maintain remission child frequently relapse steroid dependent nephrotic syndrome ( NS ) . Hypothesis 2 : Relapses child frequently relapse steroid dependent nephrotic syndrome receive ACTH gel increase dose ACTH gel reduce 50 % . Hypothesis 3 : ACTH gel increase percentage child frequently relapse steroid dependent nephrotic syndrome remain relapse free medication . Primary end-points : The primary end-point related Hypothesis 1 proportion patient arm relapse initial 6 month treatment . The primary end-point related Hypothesis 2 proportion relapse-free patient first 6 month second 6 month treatment ACTH . This include patient initially randomize ACTH patient receive ACTH rescue therapy follow initial relapse patient randomize treatment . The primary end-point related Hypothesis 3 proportion patient relapse 6 month follow completion one year ACTH . This compare proportion patient relapse initial 6 month patient randomized treatment . Secondary end-points : Our secondary end-points follow : 1 . The total prednisone exposure initial 12 month two group . 2 . The number relapse initial 6 month two group . 3 . The change body mass index ( BMI ) , height standard deviation score ( SDS ) , cholesterol study period group Study Design Methods The experimental design multi-center , prospective , control open label , randomize trial compare ACTH gel treatment prevent relapse pediatric patient frequently relapse steroid dependent nephrotic syndrome . Patients randomize 1:1 ratio either treatment treatment ACTH gel . The primary outcome presence relapse within 6 month start ACTH gel treatment . After initial recruitment , enrollment begin screen visit determine eligibility obtain informed consent assent . Randomization wean medication treatment NS begin remission achieve active relapse . There 2 week overlap ACTH current immunosuppressive medication : 1 . ACTH initiate 2 week prior completion prednisone taper patient receive prednisone time consent . 2 . ACTH initiate 2 week prior stop preventive medication tacrolimus , cyclosporin , mycophenolate . Patients randomize treatment follow 6 month disease relapse , whichever occur first . Patients relapse within 6 month give option reassignment ACTH treatment group remission achieve use conventional corticosteroid therapy . Patients randomized ACTH treatment give ACTH 12 month . During second 6 month , ACTH dose reduced 50 % start dose . The outcome interest presence relapse dose reduction . Follow-up occur throughout 12 month therapy , also 6 month follow completion ACTH therapy . The outcome interest percentage patient relapse 6 month complete 12 month course ACTH treatment . The primary end-point study statistical power base proportion patient relapse 6 month follow randomization either ACTH ACTH . We hypothesize 6 month relapse rate patient receive treatment 70 % . In order detect 6 month relapse rate 30 % patient receive ACTH gel , randomize 30 patient arm use two side z test alpha=.05 . Our statistical power detect difference 91 % assume two interim analysis 50 % 100 % accumulate information . That , 30 patient 6 month relapse data , conduct first interim analysis . The last one complete relapse data 60 patient . The table give operate characteristic design : Number Patients 6 Months Data Boundary p-value 30 0.006 60 0.045 Using method Lan-DeMets , list boundary p-value sequential design . Thus , first interim look , reject null hypothesis equal 6 month relapse rate ACTH gel treatment test statistic render p-value &lt; .006 . According intent treat principle , patient analyze accord treatment assign randomization procedure . The odds ratio ACTH versus ACTH , plus Wald 95 % confidence interval , also calculate . The primary end-point relate specific aim 2 proportion relapse-free patient first 6 month second 6 month treatment ACTH . This include patient initially randomize ACTH patient receive ACTH rescue therapy follow initial relapse . We estimate 6 month 12 month relapse-free rate use method Kaplan-Meier compare treatment use log-rank test . The primary end-point relate specific aim 3 proportion patient relapse 6 month follow completion one year ACTH . This compare proportion patient relapse initial 6 month patient randomize treatment use z test statistic . Odds ratios ACTH v ACTH also calculate . We also compare patient randomized secondary endpoint total prednisone exposure 12 month , number relapse , cholesterol change BMI two sample t-tests . If normality assumption hold , appropriate non-parametric method use . Growth data collect study summarize descriptively treatment group time point . Based height data collect study publish reference height information , height standard deviation score ( SDS , also call z-score ) compute patient time point : ( Height - mean height age category ) / SD height age category . Descriptive statistic endpoint presented time point z-scores allow identification potential outlier . Treatment Assignment Randomization Treatment assignment stratify accord clinical center . The treatment assignment generate Data Coordinating Center ( DCC ) use pseudo-random-number generator randomly permutated block use ensure balance number subject assign treatment ( ACTH ACTH ) . Before study start , institutional research coordinator clinical center give batch 20 seal , sequence , opaque envelope contain treatment assignment unique identification number consist clinical center stratum . Patients assign one two treatment arm ratio 1:1 .</detailed_description>
