	<brief_summary>This multicenter , non-randomized , open-label , phase II study design evaluate safety efficacy Perjeta combination Herceptin anthracycline-based chemotherapy neoadjuvant treatment patient HER2-based locally advanced , inflammatory , early-stage breast cancer . Each investigator choose treatment regimen ( A B ) patient follow . Treatment A ( Cohort A ) : Patients first give doxorubicin ( 60 mg/m2 IV ) cyclophosphamide ( 600 mg/m2 IV ) . This follow administration paclitaxel ( 80 mg/m2 IV ) , Perjeta ( 420 mg IV ) Herceptin ( 6 mg IV ) four cycle . Treatment B ( Cohort B ) : Patients first receive 5-fluorouracil ( 500 mg/m2 IV ) , epirubicin ( 100 mg/m2 IV ) , cyclophosphamide ( 600 mg/m2 IV ) . This follow docetaxel ( 100 mg/m2 IV ) , Perjeta ( 420 mg IV ) Herceptin ( 6 mg IV ) treatment four cycle . Patients cohorts subsequently undergo surgical treatment resume Perjeta Herceptin treatment . Total time treatment expect last 1 year ; patient followed-up 4 year .</brief_summary>
