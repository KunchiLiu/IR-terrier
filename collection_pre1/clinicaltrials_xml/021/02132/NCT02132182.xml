	<brief_summary>The purpose study identify phenotypic ( cell surface receptor expression ) functional difference monocyte population human osteosarcoma compare published historical data normal human monocyte value . The biologic similarity canine human osteosarcoma make disease model hold promise translational research possibility . The phenotypic functional difference investigator expect find canine human monocyte normal osteosarcoma subject pilot work allow u launch program investigation understand characteristic associate improved survival canine human osteosarcoma . Such data represent foundation upon investigator plan future investigation design exploit potential anti-tumor capability monocytes macrophage canine human osteosarcoma .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Research canine osteosarcoma lend well comparative study osteosarcoma human dog develop spontaneous tumor similar human cancer add benefit frequently prevalent1 . Osteosarcoma diagnose 8000 dog every year , affect mostly middle-aged old dogs.2 The majority ( 75 % ) canine osteosarcoma occur appendicular skeleton.3 Osteosarcoma diagnose 1-3 million human every year , disease primarily 10 25 year old . Human osteosarcoma also occur primarily appendicular skeleton , like dog , often find metaphyses long bone . Pulmonary metastasis common site spread dog human , usually cause death patient undergone standard care therapy ( surgical resection tumor , chemotherapy ) .4 The reported median survival time canine osteosarcoma plateaued notable improvement last 20 year , despite attempt various permutation adjunctive chemotherapy.5,6,7 Targeting metastatic disease key improve survival canine human osteosarcoma . Interestingly , one arena median survival time osteosarcoma extend - patient develop infection limb-spare surgery observe double median survival time . Lascelles et al . note infected dog half likely die , half likely develop metastasis , survival effect due delay metastasis rather control local tumor recurrence.8 A similar phenomenon increase survival infected human osteosarcoma patient observe . Jeys et al.reported 10-year survival rate human significantly well infected limb-spares : 84.5 % infected patient versus 62.2 % non-infected patients.9 An upregulation antitumor immunity postulate potentially responsible favorable survival face infection dog human . Characterization phenotype function circulate canine human monocyte normal subject , osteosarcoma subject without infection crucial furthering understand cell involve pathogenesis potential suppression osteosarcoma .</detailed_description>
