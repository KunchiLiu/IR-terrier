	<detailed_description>This pilot study prospective clinical trial compare parent knowledge , child outcome clinically indicate PSG part routine care . Comparisons take place either educational intervention usual clinical care prepare child PSG KKI . Interested family recruit Kennedy Krieger Institute ( KKI ) Sleep Disorders Clinic flyer distribute KKI subspecialty clinic clinically indicate PSG may order . Families whose child PSG clinically recommend KKI Sleep Disorders Clinic inform consent obtain parent assent child clinic , randomization occur time . Alternately , family whose child PSG clinically recommend clinic others may contact research coordinator phone screening ( telephone script attach ) order consent assent ; randomization take place informed consent receive . Families randomize educational story intervention group receive print copy educational story , well instruction use .

Parent Beliefs Scale ( arrival laboratory ) Because Dr. Paasch Dr. Accardo blind randomization study subject , able score pre-PSG questionnaire enter data need throughout study . Research procedure complete sleep technician night study follow : 1 . Adapted Wong-Baker FACES distress scale ( base child distress ) 2 . Audio video record equipment setup . Clinical PSG accompany audio video record part routine care , investigator extend video record include equipment setup specifically purpose research order quantify duration setup time number escape behavior . Research procedures parent prior discharge laboratory consist post-PSG qualitative questionnaire ( prior discharge laboratory ) regard experience laboratory . In case intervention group , also ask educational story helpful whether parent recommend change make helpful future . After completion PSG completion questionnaire , study complete . Therefore average length time study take place , approximately 3-4 week . Following completion clinically indicate PSG perform clinical care purpose , several step occur : 1 . The PSG score per laboratory protocol certify registered PSG technician . 2 . The Primary Investigator , Dr. Accardo , review data generate clinical interpretation PSG detail whether sleep concern diagnosis identify study . 3 .
