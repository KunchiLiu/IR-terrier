	<brief_summary>As U.S. population age prevalence osteoarthritis ( OA ) among old adult rise , prevention OA-associated disability important public health priority . Accordingly , efficacious intervention need manage pain maintain physical function among old adult OA . Because skeletal muscle weakness primary contributory factor progression pain functional decline among person OA , optimal intervention capable improve skeletal muscle strength . High-intensity resistance exercise best-known method improve muscle strength ; however high-compressive load typically induce significant joint pain among person OA . Accordingly , current recommendation include performance low- moderate-intensity physical exercise - despite fact train paradigms sub-optimal enhance muscle strength . This application propose conduct pilot study investigate potential innovative training paradigm potential stimulate improvement skeletal muscle strength utilize low-intensity load . This paradigm , know KAATSU training , involve perform low-intensity exercise externally-applied compression mildly restrict blood flow active skeletal muscle . The overarch objective present application evaluate efficacy feasibility chronic KAATSU training improvement skeletal muscle strength physical function among person age &gt; 60 year symptomatic knee OA mild moderate physical limitation . Up 72 participant recruit participate three month intervention study . Participants randomly assign one two intervention condition : ( 1 ) standard exercise intervention consist center-based , moderate-intensity resistance training , ( 2 ) KAATSU train program match overall workload . This study provide novel information regard therapeutic potential KAATSU training improve strength function well attenuate pain among individual . The study also provide critical information regard long-term , clinical viability paradigm evaluate participant safety , discomfort , willingness continually engage KAATSU train program .</brief_summary>
