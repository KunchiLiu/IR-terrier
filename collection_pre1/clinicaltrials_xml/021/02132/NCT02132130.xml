	<brief_summary>The goal study evaluate safety , tolerability , potential ability CGF166 deliver IL-infusion improve hear vestibular function . CGF166 recombinant adenovirus 5 ( Ad5 ) vector contain cDNA encode human Atonal transcription factor ( Hath1 ) .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Safety , Tolerability Efficacy CGF166 Patients With Bilateral Severe-to-profound Hearing Loss</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The study evaluate safety , tolerability , potential efficacy CGF166 associate delivery procedure patient severe-to-profound bilateral hearing loss . Eligible patient require documented , non-fluctuating hearing loss . Part A include safety tolerability cohort ( N=3 ) . Patient dosing stagger ; dose next patient cohort base safety review available data 4 week post-dose previously dose patient ( ) . Part B include volumetric escalation design evaluate infusion volume CGF166 concentration ( 5.0 x 10E11vp/mL ) 4 cohort patient ( n=3/cohort ; total 12 patient ) . Part C expansion cohort high safe tolerable dose identify Part B , assessment efficacy .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>For Parts A , B C study , Inclusion criterion : 1 . Written informed consent must obtain assessment perform . 2 . For Parts ( A , B C ) study , male female patient , 18 75 year old , inclusive , severetoprofound bilateral hearing loss intact vestibular function non operative ear . Nonfluctuating severetoprofound hearing loss require study ear define : PTA within 10 dB PTA obtain least 11 month previously . Word recognition within 20 % previous test least 11 month previously [ AAO HNS Hearing Classification System ] 3 . Candidate ear ( `` study ear '' ) : Minimal residual hearing base pure tone average 0.5 , 1 , 2 , 4 kHz threshold ≤110 dB HL 4 . Candidate ear ( `` study ear '' ) : Pure tone audiometric threshold ≥50 dB HL testable octave frequency 0.125 0.250 kHz , ≥ 70 dB HL testable octave frequency 0.5 8 kHz sentence recognition score ≤50 % screening . Subject response monitor vibrotactile sensation , particularly lowfrequency stimulus ( e.g. , 125 250 Hz ) . A frequency elicit vibrotactile response level 70 dB HL consider `` testable '' hear threshold frequency testable hear threshold consider patient inclusion/exclusion study . 5 . Contralateral ear ( `` nonstudy ear '' ) : Despite use hearing aid , must meet cochlear implantation criterion . Pure tone average 0.5/1/2/4 kHz ≥70 dB HL ≤110 dB HL sentence recognition use AzBio test ≤60 % screen 6 . Patients intact vestibular function least one ear ( nonstudy ear ) measure vestibuloocular reflex , caloric nystagmography , vestibular evoke myogenic potential ( VEMP ) 7 . Able communicate well investigator , understand comply requirement study 8 . Meet surgical requirements/eligibility ( include MRI scan within 3 month screen confirm suitability inner ear surgery ) 9 . Patients must weigh least 40 kg participate study , must body mass index ( BMI ) &lt; 45 kg/m2 . BMI = Body weight ( kg ) / [ Height ( ) ] 2 1 . Patients hear loss cause genetic/developmental disorder , e.g. , cochlea aplasia autoimmune ear disease 2 . Patients exist conductive hearing loss mixed hearing loss judge Principal Investigator follow thorough review trial hearing assessment , especially immittance test part DPAOE ; 3 . Patients cochlear implant past cochlear implant candidate study ear 4 . Hearing loss due cause would expect respond hair cell regeneration , example mechanical trauma central auditory lesion lack auditory nerve 5 . Patients require ototoxic drug routine therapy course study , oncology patient platinumbased chemotherapy 6 . Any contraindication plan surgery anesthesia determine surgeon anesthesiologist 7 . Previous surgery study ear 8 . Any otological history , chronic otitis , cholesteatoma , tympanic membrane perforation , suggest poor candidacy cochlear implant inner ear surgery suggest potential interference study auditory vestibular function test 9 . Pregnant woman 10 . Abnormal vital sign and/or ECG suggest potential contraindication plan study anesthesia 11 . Past serious adverse reaction anesthesia 12 . Meniere 's Disease 13 . History radiation therapy head neck 14 . Participation clinical trial within last 30 day 15 . Immunocompromised patient , judge investigator base patient history , physical exam CBC</criteria>
