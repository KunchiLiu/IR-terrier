	<detailed_description>Nationwide cost estimate 60 major illness place alcohol use disorder 2nd drug use disorder 7th costly health problem . Both related high rate HIV risk behavior associate human immunodeficiency virus ( HIV ) together represent 3 top 10 modifiable behavioral cause mortality US . Studies indicate effective strategy manage substance use disorder ( SUD ) must address chronic cyclical nature , HIV risk part . For many , substance use create circumstance increase HIV risk ( e.g. , needle use , trade sex ) others , substance use cop mechanism negative impact lifestyle choice ( e.g . illegal activity , lose custody child , trade sex ) . Post-discharge monitoring , feedback early re-intervention become standard practice manage numerous chronic conditions.10 Mobile technology potential radically improve odds sustain recovery providing tool ongoing monitoring , assessment access recovery support intervention anytime anywhere . This particularly important 90 % needing treatment n't receive . Therefore apply smartphone technology provide recovery management anytime anywhere potentially significant . Using smartphone-based suite relapse-prevention intervention , Gustafson colleagues11 conduct RCT sample 350 adult alcohol use disorder discharge 2 residential substance abuse treatment program follow 12 month . Patients self-initiated access intervention 24/7 ; type intervention range professionally support EMIs like `` ask expert '' allow participant receive personal response question addiction expert Panic Button trigger automated reminder participant , alert key people ( e.g. , counselor , sponsor , family member ) may reach participant via phone person . Their system design support recovery promote autonomous motivation , cop competence , relatedness.12 Relative participant assign recovery support service usual , receive support system report significantly few heavy drinking day likely abstinent alcohol end study.13-15 In addition , study demonstrate provide recovery support via smart phone feasible population . Despite encouraging outcome , full potential provide 24/7 access recovery support via smartphones may yet realize . For example , participant rat protective risk factor weekly , opportunity intervene `` moment need '' lose individual self-initiate use application , rating subject recall bias , `` teachable moment '' participant could cognitively link risk factor desire actual use unexplored . More frequent monitoring current circumstance ( vs. past generalized week ) use method like Ecological Momentary Assessment ( EMA ) may well suit context improve one 's level self-monitoring , provide additional opportunity intervene moment risk , minimize recall bias provide participant opportunity learn relationship current circumstance use.16,17 The primary goal propose trial examine effect combine frequent self-monitoring via EMAs automate intervention via Ecological Momentary Interventions ( EMIs ) provide smartphone , day abstinence drug alcohol HIV risk behavior 6 month follow treatment discharge . We recruit total 400 participant 4 cohort 100 people sequential discharge ( plan unplanned ) 2 month start month 7 , 19 , 31 , 43 follow 6 month post discharge . Using urn randomization , randomly assign participant discharge 2 x 2 factorial design receive EMAs , EMIs , combine EMA+EMI control ( EMA EMI ) . Post-randomization , participant assign EMA , EMI combine EMA/EMI group receive smartphone 6 month 450 call minute , 500 text message unlimited data plan monthly . Those EMA EMA/EMI combine group ask 6 randomly select time day ( 183 day total ) record past-30-minutes involvement HIV risk behavior substance use , exposure internal external risk protective factor rate extent factor support recovery , make want use drug and/or alcohol . Those EMI EMA/EMI combine group continuous access suite smartphone base support service ( EMIs ) . To minimize interference treatment , phone issue training do discharge . To minimize potential contamination across condition , training condition occur separate day . During month follow treatment discharge &amp; training , participant three experimental group return research office 2 time week research staff check participant 's proficiency operate phone collect urine screen . To control effect attention , control group also return research office 2 time week urine screen short survey non-phone related topic . Research office visit train do Protocol Monitors ( interviewer ) . Research Interviewers blind condition conduct discharge , 3 6 month post discharge interview urine test . EMA EMI utilization data electronically record immediately via mobile/web application use track implementation . The primary hypothesis H1 Random assignment ) EMA ( vs. ) , b ) EMI ( vs. ) , c ) interaction associate day abstinence drug alcohol 6 month post discharge . H2 Random assignment ) EMA , b ) EMI , c ) interaction associate few HIV risk behavior 6 month post discharge . H3 Days abstinent 3 month post discharge mediate effect ) EMA , b ) EMI c ) interaction HIV Risk behavior 6 month post discharge .</detailed_description>
