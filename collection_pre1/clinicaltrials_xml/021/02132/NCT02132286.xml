	<brief_summary>Major depressive disorder ( MDD ) highly prevalent , chronic and/or recurrent condition substantial morbidity mortality . It one lead cause disability worldwide . Despite significant advance pharmacological treatment depression last two decade , significant proportion patient ( 10-20 % ) resistant currently available treatment . The development new effective treatment depression limit fact MDD heterogeneous disorder subgroup base variation etiological factor treatment response . Functional magnetic resonance imaging ( fMRI ) approach offer promise prediction evaluation clinical response antidepressant treatment . Previous fMRI study identify increased activity dorso-lateral prefrontal cortex ( DLPFC ) decrease amygdala activity baseline image marker antidepressant response patient MDD . However , study examine MDD homogenous group without specify type patient group , brain region priori hypothesis.We therefore need study use combined genetics neuroimaging measure biomarkers prediction evaluation clinical response antidepressant . In study attempt determine image clinical efficacy marker previously define brain region ( amygdala prefrontal region ) two class antidepressant ( citalopram quetiapine extend release ( XR ) ) differential action serotonin transporter inhibition subgroup MDD patient high risk allele ( S/Lg ) serotonin transporter gene polymorphism .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Background The atypical antipsychotic quetiapine find significant antidepressant action addition antipsychotic action . Unlike citalopram selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor ( SSRI ) quetiapine effect serotonin transporter ( 5-HTT ) increase post synaptic 5-HT1A binding potential regulate 5-HT2A receptor consistently ( Tarazi et al. , 2002 ) due direct antagonistic effect 5-HT2A receptor agonistic effect post synaptic 5-HT1A receptor . The quetiapine induce regulation 5-HT2A receptor increase density 5-HT1A receptor attribute antidepressant effect ( Thase et al. , 2006 ) . Taking account contrary SSRIs , quetiapine mediate antidepressant effect depend 5-HTT inhibition , possible genetic factor regulate 5-HTT expression may less influence outcome quetiapine treatment SSRI treatment depress patient . Rationale study In experiment , propose study efficacy quetiapine relative citalopram patient MDD high risk serotonin transporter gene polymorphism ( 5-HTTLPR ) S/Lg alleles . Since 5-HTTLPR-S/Lg allele confers vulnerability depression context emotional stress ( Caspi et al. , 2003 ) also mediate poor slow response SSRI antidepressant ( Serretti et al. , 2007 ) , study nature significant treatment implication depress patient high risk stress induced relapse treatment resistance . Given quetiapine affinity 5-HTT may normalize receptor change occur condition low 5-HTT expression ( S Lg carrier patient MDD ) , predict compare citalopram treatment , quetiapine treatment effective reduce amygdala response negative stimulus well depressive symptom patient MDD high risk S/Lg alleles . It also predict direct action post synaptic 5-HT1A 5-HT2A receptor , quetiapine treatment show early onset action amygdala responses citalopram treatment especially patient S allele . Primary Hypothesis : There significant decrease amygdala response negative facial stimulus depress patient S/Lg allele short term ( 1 week ) long term ( 8 week ) quetiapine treatment compare citalopram treatment . Secondary Hypotheses : The reduction amygdala responses week 8 treatment correlate clinical improvement , reduction amygdala responses week one treatment may predict subsequent clinical response week 8 . Study Objective To examine effect short term ( 1 week ) long term ( 8 week ) treatment quetiapine 150-300 mg citalopram 10-20 mg amygdala response negative emotional stimulus patient major depression high risk allele ( S/Lg ) Study Plan Procedures This eight-week , parallel-group , randomize , double blind comparative trial repeat measure design patient major depression randomly assign 1:1 ratio receive treatment either quetiapine 300 mg citalopram 20mg 8-week period . The subject undergo image three separate 60-minute session : 1 ) baseline week 0 , 2 ) one week initiation treatment , 3 ) 8 week baseline initiation treatment . Genotyping performed participant . 64 Caucasians gender age range 20-55 year meet criterion DSM-IV ( American Psychiatric Association 2000 ) criterion major depressive disorder accord Structured Clinical Interview ( First et al.,2000 ) DSM-IV Axis 1 disorder recruit Calgary Health Region outpatient mental health clinic local newspaper advertisement . Eligible patient randomly assign 1:1 ratio receive either quetiapine citalopram . Thus treatment arm 32 subject . Clinical assessment treatment At baseline , Structured Clinical Interview I II perform determine DSM IV diagnosis MDD also exclude Axis I psychiatric disorder . Hamilton rating scale depression ( HRSD ) ( use ass severity depressive symptom ( Hamilton 1960 ) Hamilton anxiety rating scale ( HAM-A ) ( Hamilton 1959 ) use rate anxiety symptom . Additionally , temperament character inventory ( TPI ) ( Cloninger et al 1994 ) childhood trauma questionnaire ( CTQ ) administer assess control personality trait fear anxiety child hood abuse know affect amygdala response fearful stimulus After baseline assessment prior initiation treatment , first fMRI session perform . Then quetiapine XR initiate 50mg/day first 2 day 150 mg/day day 3 titrate 300mg/day day 4 , citalopram initiate dose 10 mg /day titrate 20 mg/day day 4 . The patient treatment arm continue dosage completion study protocol 8 week later . For patient could tolerate develop adverse effect , quetiapine dose reduce 150 mg/day citalopram dose reduce 10 mg/day . The patient could tolerate quetipine 150 mg/day citalopram 10 mg/day terminate study.During participation study , patient undergo clinical assessment week one titration quetiapine citalopram second fMRI session . Depressive anxiety symptom rat use HRSD HAM-A . Then , patient evaluate every two week week 8 use HRSD HAM-A . At week 8 , third fMRI session perform . Adverse effect record . The patient could tolerate study medication terminate study Genotyping Genotyping 5-HTTLPR functional single nucleotide polymorphism ( SNP ) ( A-G ) rs 25531 promoter region perform use polymerase chain reaction ( PCR ) follow double restriction endonuclease digestion report previously ( Wendland et al. , 2006 ) . High resolution agarose gel use determine four allele : Sa-469 bp ( uncut ) , Sg-402+67 bp , La- 512 bp ( uncut ) , Lg-402+110bp . fMRI fMRI perform three occasion : ) baseline , ii ) 1 week optimize treatment , iii ) 8 week optimization An fMRI block design presentation angry fearful facial expression interleave sensorimotor control task use elicit activation amygdala . This paradigm perceptual processing facial expression negative emotion show effectively consistently activate amygdala previous study ( Hariri et al. , 2002 ) . The paradigm consist total 6 run run , 3 block emotional task interleave 4 block sensorimotor control task present . During emotion task , subject view trio face select one two face express emotion target face top . Each emotion block consist 6 image , three gender , target affect ( angry fear ) . Each facial stimulus present 5 second . The identity three face always different . During sensorimotor control task , subject view trio geometric shape ( circle , vertical horizontal ellipsis ) select one two shape match target shape . Each control block consist 6 different image , image present 5 second . Accuracy reaction time record scan . Method statistical analysis The first level analysis generation fMRI map brain activity use FMRIB Software Library ( FSL ) , statistical software package specifically design fMRI application , use general linear model compute contrast parameter estimate explanatory variable ( case , explanatory variable face task vs. sensorimotor task ) pixel brain image . The result estimate response magnitude give pixel surpasses specify statistical threshold ( typically , p = 0.01 ) . The main variable interest magnitude activity within amydala . For patient , region interest ( ROIs ) drawn manually encompass amygdala within hemisphere aid patient 's anatomical image . Magnitude activity ROIs record . A generalized linear mixed model use analyze group data treatment , time session ( baseline , 1-week , 8-week ) factor analysis . As expect sample size patient La/La genotype small treatment group , primary analysis do MDD patient S/Lg allele prove hypothesis . To examine association change amygdala activity response depression severity change HAM-D patient 8 week regress correspond change amygdala activity . A similar approach use correlate 1-week change activity 8-week change depression severity . The region functionally structurally connect amygdala anterior cingulate region ( ACC ) , dorso-lateral prefrontal cortex ( DLPFC ) , dorso-medial prefrontal cortex ( DMPFC ) , precuneus ( PCC ) also select exploratory analysis The potential confounding factor age , sex , childhood adversity personality index fear anxiety , baseline depression anxiety score control group covaried intergroup difference variable . Determination sample size As expect approximately 70 % participant express S/Lg allele , magnitude activity within amygdala estimate meta-analysis Munafo et al ( 2008 ) . 0.10 standard deviation 0.11 Assuming difference mean change ( baseline 8 week ) group 0.05 change standard deviation 0.07 , total 32 patient per group require detect difference 80 % power two-sided 5 % level significance . A 50 % difference mean change reasonable base upon result Sheline et al ( 2001 ) .</detailed_description>
