	<detailed_description>In patient primary metastatic liver tumor , potentially curative therapeutic option represent hepatic resection . Nowdays extend resection perform acceptable morbidity mortality . There unanimous definition criterion resectability ability perform less extensive liver resection defer expertise center surgical team . The investigator consider tumor resectable surgical procedure damage vital structure , normal function organ preserved tumor completely remove ( R0 resection ) . One limit factor execution liver resection , particular extend , 's represent future remnant liver ( FRL ) hepatic resection . In case normal organ function FRL 25 % consider sufficient . In case impaired hepatic function history chemotherapy , consider safe least 40 % . Many method develop proposed increase resectability patient undergo major liver resection . In case bilobar tumor , two-step approach ( two-stage hepatectomy ) propose . This procedure imply one two lobe initially free disease tumor resection ablation . After achieve adequate compensatory hypertrophy lobe free tumor ( usually 4-6 week ) , contralateral liver resection do treat remnant tumor . To increase FRL another approach occlude portal branch towards one liver lobe . This do surgical ligation ( laparotomy laparoscopy ) radiologically , use portal embolization . The technique allow increase 10 % 46 % FRL possibility obtain resection R-0 70-100 % case . It unclear whether difference method portal occlusion ( ligation v embolization ) . To increase hypertrophy portal occlusion liver tumor occupy right liver , researcher propose embolize portal branch segment 4th together right portal vein . The group Regensburg introduce new technique two stage tumor right lobe , combine method mention . This two-stage approach consist ligation right portal vein associate resection liver along falciform ligament ( step 1 ) . Step 2 , period 9 day ( median - 5-25 day ) , volumetric CT ensure adeguate hypertrophy leave lateral lobe , patient undergo right trisectionectomy . The hypertrophy leave lateral lobe show 74 % , high technique ligation portal embolizatiol propose literature . The rationale technique complete portal devascularization right lobe plus segment 4 produce great stimulus hypertrophy leave lateral segment . This occur less time method describe allows reduce timeframe two step minimizes risk interprocedural progression underlie disease ( incidence drop out two-stage hepatectomy 20 % progression disease ) . The morbidity two-stage approach 44 % ( complication Clavien grade III IV ) mimic data report literature extend hepatic resection ( 20-50 % ) . The 12 % mortality rate similar one described Lang et al leave trisegmentectomies . On basis clinical experience report investigator design new protocol two-stage hepatic resection treatment primary secondary tumor right lobe . Step1 : laparoscopic radio frequency / microwave ablation future transection plane segment 4 leave lateral lobe surgical ligation embolization right portal vein . The ablation purpose devascularize segment 4 significance resection liver along falciform ligament describe Regensburg group . Step2 : After period time 9 ± 2 day , follow volumetric CT show adequate liver volume gain ( ratio FRL / patient body weight &gt; 0.5 ) , patient undergo second-stage surgery : laparoscopic/ laparotomic right trisectionectomy</detailed_description>
