	<brief_summary>Fatigue one common debilitate symptom experience Parkinson 's Disease ( PD ) Multiple Sclerosis ( MS ) . There multiple propose mechanisms disorder-related fatigue , however , unknown whether PD MS patient experience compromise blood lactate response acute bout exercise , subject exercise-related fatigue . These population may experience high energy expenditure rest due increase rigidity , however , limited data exists investigate rest energy expenditure population . Researchers hypothesize PD MS patient display high rest energy expenditure healthy age-matched control , level energy expenditure correlate amount rigidity spasticity . Also , hypothesize baseline level lactate different PD/MS control group , post-exercise blood lactate level significantly high PD/MS group .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Patients diagnose Parkinson 's Disease ( PD ) Multiple Sclerosis ( MS ) frequently experience increase level muscle weakness fatigue ; This impairment exacerbate onset exercise alleviate rest sleep . Importantly , 1/3 PD patient , fatigue consider debilitating , even , inconclusive evidence suggest anti-PD anti-MS drug improve fatigue . The precise mechanisms pathogenesis disorder-specific fatigue PD MS remain elusive . Both peripheral central cholinergic system affect PD , however , show peripheral cholinergic neuron neuromuscular junction normal functioning . Even , recruitment necessary motor unit may greatly affect due peripheral neuropathy common PD MS . Following repetitive nerve stimulation PD MS , consistent evidence decrease number function motor unit decrement muscle response . This promote progressive fatigue decrement amplitude movement . Therefore , recruitment motor unit may major cause rapid fatigue repetitive movement PD MS patient , even though peripheral neuromuscular junction seem affect . In addition skeletal muscle inefficiency , work rate efficiency breathe use respiratory muscle significantly low PD population repetitive stimulation , use simulate exercise-induced repetitive contraction . Respiratory inefficiency MS include , limited reduce forced vital capacity , hypoxemia , respiratory muscle weakness . In addition possible neurological mechanism PD- MS-related fatigue , rigidity , define involuntary state continuous muscle tension PD , spasticity rigidity MS may also profound effect fatigue outcome . Adequate muscle length require effective muscle contraction . Rigidity likely change length muscle rest , therefore contribute ineffective muscle contraction active . In addition inefficient muscle contraction , increase continuous active contraction , tone , muscle result increase rest energy expenditure compare healthy individual , even pharmacologically treat PD patient . Interestingly , rest energy expenditure MS patient show comparable age-matched healthy control ; however , important note MS patient remain medicated study . In addition , rigidity spasticity , common PD MS , respectively may provide vary level rest energy expenditure ; however , research date examine difference . In total , energy expend rest , hypothetically , PD MS patient inadequate energy store exercise respective full capacity . This could potentiate early onset lactic acid hydrogen accumulation active muscle , decrease pH active muscle , contribute early fatigue repetitive task . Purportedly , combination early onset skeletal respiratory muscle fatigue , addition muscle rigidity would create environment similar high intensity exercise , even low intensity rest . The ensue result may likely accumulation lactic acid hydrogen ion , make muscle environment acidic . However , change level rest post-exercise blood lactate level elucidate . Therefore , plan measure rest energy expenditure use ventilation face mask noseclip . Blood lactate sample rest , simulate high-intensity exercise , ten minute rest ( lactate significantly increase ) . The exercise consist perform 5 set static , shallow 120 degree squat 1 minute , 1 minute seat rest squat . Sustained isometric contraction 2/3 maximal voluntary contractile force 2 3 minute find occlude local blood flow enough local oxygen store deplete . Muscle lactate also increase 12-fold upon fatigue isometric hold squat . This environment lactic acid buildup simulate circulatory occlusion well 60-second isometric quadricep contraction . Isometric squat employ observe difference blood response PD compare healthy individual . Therefore , purpose study analyze difference rest energy expenditure exercise-induced lactate production PD MS compare healthy , age-matched control .</detailed_description>
