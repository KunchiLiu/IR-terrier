	<brief_summary>The purpose Oxy-CAHN study improve monitoring capability newborn infant recover congenital heart surgery . Currently , utilize important unsophisticated measure , vital sign lactate measurement , monitor patient . Although useful categorize patient well unwell , sign currently lack power quantify patient 's risk cardiac arrest . More point , mostly indirect measure really assess , tissue oxygen delivery . Our group signiﬁcant expertise device quantify amount oxygen baby consumes every minute . Historically , value commonly use combination measure assess nutritional metabolism status . In critically ill patient , however , volume oxygen consume patient may limited amount oxygen circulation delivers . This may represent critical relationship , previously describe , exploit purpose identify patient critically low oxygen delivery . The aim study therefore ( 1 ) demonstrate oxygen consumption safely precisely measure continuously newborns undergo one two common congenital heart surgery , ( 2 ) determine whether postoperative circulatory failure associate precedent change oxygen consumption , ( 3 ) determine whether addition oxygen-based measurement ( include oxygen consumption venous oxygen saturation ) standardly measure parameter add power predict patient experience postoperative circulatory failure . If successful , study may improve capacity non-invasively continuously monitor patient follow high risk congenital heart surgery , future , create algorithm quantiﬁes patient risk cardiac arrest . This may permit provider intervene patient earlier , improve morbidity mortality associate congenital heart disease .</brief_summary>
