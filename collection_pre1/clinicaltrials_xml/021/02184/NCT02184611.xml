	<criteria>Type subject : outpatient , Asian ancestry . Informed Consent : A sign date write informed consent prior study participation . Age : 40 year age old Screening ( Visit 1 ) . Gender : Male female subject eligible participate study . A female eligible enter participate study : Nonchild bear potential ( i.e . physiologically incapable become pregnant , include female postmenopausal surgically sterile ) . Surgically sterile female define documented hysterectomy and/or bilateral oophorectomy tubal ligation . Postmenopausal female define amenorrhoeic great 1 year appropriate clinical profile , e.g . age appropriate , &gt; 45 year , absence hormone replacement therapy . However , questionable case , postmenopause status may confirm analysis blood sample folliclestimulating hormone ( FSH ) &gt; 40 million international unit per milliliter ( MIU/ml ) estradiol &lt; 40 picogram ( pg ) /ml ( &lt; 140 picomole per liter ( pmol/L ) confirmatory . OR Child bear potential , provide subject negative pregnancy test screening , agree one follow acceptable contraceptive method use consistently correctly ( i.e . accordance approve product label , instruction physician duration study Screening FollowUp contact ) : Abstinence\ Oral contraceptive either combine progestogen alone\ Injectable progestogen\ Implants levonorgestrel\ Estrogenic vaginal ring\ Percutaneous contraceptive patches\ Intrauterine device ( IUD ) intrauterine system ( IUS ) \ Male partner sterilization ( vasectomy documentation azoospermia ) prior female subject 's entry study male sole partner subject\ Double barrier method condom occlusive cap ( diaphragm cervical/vault cap ) vaginal spermicidal agent ( foam/gel/film/cream/suppository ) . COPD History : An established clinical history COPD accordance definition American Thoracic Society/European Respiratory Society follow : COPD preventable treatable disease state characterize airflow limitation fully reversible . The airflow limitation usually progressive associate abnormal inflammatory response lungs noxious particle gas , primarily cause cigarette smoking . Although COPD affect lung , also produce significant systemic consequence . Tobacco Use Smoking History : Current former cigarette smoker history cigarette smoke &gt; = 10 packyears [ Number pack year = ( number cigarette per day /20 ) x number year smoke ( e.g . 20 cigarette per day 10 year , 10 cigarette per day 20 year equal 10 pack year ) ] . Former smoker define stop smoke least 6 month prior Visit 1 . Note : Pipe and/or cigar use use calculate packyear history . COPD patient use pipe and/or cigar eligible . Severity Disease : A pre postsalbutamol/albuterol FEV1/FVC ratio &lt; 0.70 pre postsalbutamol/albuterol FEV1 &lt; =70 % predict normal value calculate use National Health Nutrition Examination Survey III reference equation Visit 1 . Dyspnea : A score &gt; =2 Modified Medical Research Council Dyspnoea Scale ( mMRC ) Screening ( Visit 1 ) Pregnancy : Women pregnant lactate plan become pregnant study . Asthma : A current diagnosis asthma . Other Respiratory Disorders : Known alpha1 antitrypsin deficiency , active lung infection ( tuberculosis ) lung cancer absolute exclusionary condition . A subject , opinion investigator significant respiratory condition addition COPD exclude . Examples may include clinically significant bronchiectasis , pulmonary hypertension , sarcoidosis interstitial lung disease . Other Diseases/Abnormalities : Subjects historical current evidence clinically significant cardiovascular , neurological , psychiatric , renal , hepatic , immunological , endocrine ( include uncontrolled diabetes thyroid disease ) haematological abnormality uncontrolled and/or previous history cancer remission &lt; 5 year prior Visit 1 ( localize carcinoma skin resect cure exclusionary ) . Significant defined disease , opinion investigator , would put safety subject risk participation , would affect efficacy safety analysis disease/condition exacerbate study . Chest XRay : A chest Xray compute tomography ( CT ) scan reveals evidence clinically significant abnormality believe due presence COPD . A chest Xray must take Visit 1 chest Xray CT scan available within 6 month prior Visit 1 . Contraindications : A history allergy hypersensitivity anticholinergic/muscarinic receptor antagonist , beta2agonist , lactose/milk protein magnesium stearate medical condition narrowangle glaucoma , prostatic hypertrophy bladder neck obstruction , opinion study physician contraindicates study participation use inhale anticholinergic . Hospitalization : Hospitalization COPD pneumonia within 12 week prior Visit 1 . Lung Resection : Subjects lung volume reduction surgery within 12 month prior Screening ( Visit 1 ) . 12Lead electrocardiogram ( ECG ) : An abnormal significant ECG find 12lead ECG conduct Visit 1 , include presence pace rhythm 12lead ECG cause underlie rhythm ECG obscure . Investigators provide ECG review conduct centralized independent cardiologist assist evaluation subject eligibility . Specific ECG finding preclude subject eligibility list . An ECG finding would preclude subject enter trial define 12lead tracing interpret , limited , follow : Sinus tachycardia ≥120 bpm*Note : sinus tachycardia ≥120bpm confirm two additional reading least 5 minute apart . Sinus bradycardia &lt; 45bpm*Note : Sinus bradycardia &lt; 45bpm confirm two additional reading least 5 minute apart.Multifocal atrial tachycardia.Supraventricular tachycardia ( &gt; 100bpm ) .Atrial fibrillation rapid ventricular response ( rate &gt; 120bpm ) . Atrial flutter rapid ventricular response ( rate &gt; 120bpm ) . Ventricular tachycardia ( non sustain , sustain , polymorphic , monomorphic ) . Ventricular flutter . Ventricular fibrillation . Torsades de Pointes . Evidence Mobitz type II second degree third degree atrioventricular ( AV ) block . AV dissociation . Trifascicular Block . For subject QRS duration &lt; 120 m : QTc ( F ) ≥450msec ECG unsuitable QT measurement ( e.g. , poor define termination T wave ) . For subject QRS duration &gt; 120 : QTc ( F ) ≥480msec ECG unsuitable QT measurement ( e.g. , poor define termination T wave ) . Myocardial infarction ( acute recent ) * Note : Evidence old ( resolve ) myocardial infarction exclusionary . The study investigator determine medical significance ECG abnormality list . Screening Labs : Significantly abnormal finding clinical chemistry haematology test Visit 1 .
