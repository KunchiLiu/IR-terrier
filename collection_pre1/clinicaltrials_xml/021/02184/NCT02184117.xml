	<brief_summary>The purpose study determine diagnostic performance iodine contrast medium rest condition predict fractional flow reserve ( FFR ) . Reference FFR measure use standard adenosine . We hypothesize contrast FFR offer superior diagnostic agreement compare resting condition .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>We conduct diagnostic accuracy study . The reference standard adenosine-derived FFR . The diagnostic test undergo evaluation rest condition hyperemia induce intracoronary injection contrast medium . While test give continuous result , apply binary cutoff comparison FFRâ‰¤0.8 reference standard . Subjects select prospectively consecutive patient undergo FFR assessment standard clinical indication . The paired comparative design mean patient undergo resting ( baseline ) , post-contrast , adenosine-derived measurement . To enhance test integrity , pressure recording analyze central physiology core laboratory blind clinical data recruit site .</detailed_description>

Extremely tortuous calcify coronary artery preclude intracoronary physiologic measurement . Operators may exclude subtotal similar highgrade lesion , judgment may threaten pressure wire placement . Known severe leave ventricular hypertrophy ( septal wall thickness echocardiography &gt; 13 mm ) . Inability receive adenosine ( example , severe reactive airway disease , mark hypotension , advance atrioventricular block without pacemaker ) . Recent ( within 3 week prior cardiac catheterization ) STsegment elevation myocardial infarction ( STEMI ) arterial distribution ( specifically target lesion ) . Culprit lesion ( base clinical judgment operator ) either STEMI nonSTEMI include . Severe cardiomyopathy ( ejection fraction &lt; 30 % ) .
