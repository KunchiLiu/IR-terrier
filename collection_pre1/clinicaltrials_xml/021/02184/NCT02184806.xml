	<brief_title>Autograft Human Ovarian Tissue : Efficiency Safety</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Ovarian tissue cryopreservation new technique female fertility preservation gonadotoxic treatment . The first ovarian tissue cryopreservations perform 10 year ago . There two main method use frozen ovarian cortex : autograft ovarian fragment vitro follicular growth . At present time , none mature oocyte obtained culture . Since 2000 , around twenty publication state autograft ovarian cortex report 8 pregnancy 6 life birth healthy baby . Since 1998 2008 , unit reproduction biology pitie-salpetriere hospital Paris , France , 330 patient ovarian tissue cryopreservation fertility preservation gonadotoxic treatment . Among , present time , 180 procreative age consequence , could ask use ovarian cortex . The general aim protocol propose woman wish baby , ovarian tissue transplantation patient premature ovarian failure . The principal aim study evaluate efficiency safety ovarian transplantation . Before graft , absence contra- indication check . An informed consent sign patient . Autograft ovarian cortex perform either orthotopic heterotopic localization accord pathology possible contra-indication orthotopic position . After graft , month hormonal assessment , ovarian echography , 3 month , MRI , perform . Assisted Reproductive Technologies ( ART ) perform case heterotopic graft necessary case orthotopic graft . The efficiency ovarian tissue autograft appreciate delay recovery ovarian function , oocyte embryo quality case ART . Finally , number pregnancy live birth also appreciate well possible recurrence pathology .</detailed_description>
