	<brief_title>Study Of The Impact Of Inlyta In 2nd Line On The Treatment Outcomes Of mRCC Patients Treated With Sutent In 1st Line In The Real Life Setting</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Patients enrol start treatment Sutent 1st line Inlyta 2nd line post Sutent treatment . The possible sequence treatment investigation : - Sutent ( prospective ) - Inlyta - Sutent ( retrospective ) - Inlyta - Sutent - active treatment ( supportive care ) - Sutent - second line treatment ( Nexavar ( sorafenib ) , Votrient ( pazopanib ) , Afinitor ( everolimus ) , Torisel ( temsirolimus ) , ) ) The study enroll approximately 750 adv/mRCC patient 1st 2nd line treatment level . Patients enrolled start treatment Sutent 1st line Inlyta 2nd line post Sutent treatment . Therefore patient retrospective Sutent data collection . The primary endpoint study patient adv/mRCC PFS TTF patient receive Inlyta 2nd line , combine PFS TTF patient receive Sutent-Inlyta sequence . In non-interventional real life study , objective descriptive sample size rely precision estimate .</detailed_description>
