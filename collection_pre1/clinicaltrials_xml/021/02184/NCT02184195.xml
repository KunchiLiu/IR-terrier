	<brief_title>Olaparib gBRCA Mutated Pancreatic Cancer Whose Disease Has Not Progressed First Line Platinum-Based Chemotherapy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Approximately 145 patient randomise use Interactive Voice Response System /Interactive Web Response System ( IVR/IWR system ) 3:2 ratio ( Olaparib : placebo ) treatment specify : - Olaparib tablet p.o . 300 mg twice daily - Matching placebo tablet p.o . twice daily Eligible patient patient pancreas cancer previously treat metastatic disease progress follow completion least 16 week ( ) first line platinum-based chemotherapy . All patient must know deleterious suspect deleterious germline BRCA mutation randomise ; may determine prior enrolment study may assess part enrolment procedure study ( via centrally provide MyriadIntegrated BRAC . Patients randomise within 6 week last dose chemotherapy ( last dose day last infusion ) treatment start soon possible less 4 8 week last chemotherapy dose . At time start protocol treatment , previous chemotherapy treatment discontinue . Following randomisation , patient attend clinic visit weekly first 4 week treatment ( Days 8 , 15 , 22 29 ) . Patients attend clinic visit every 4 week whilst study treatment . Patients continue receive study treatment objective radiological disease progression per RECIST assess investigator long investigator 's opinion benefiting treatment meet discontinuation criterion . Once patient progress patient follow second progression ( PFS2 ) every 8 week survival final analysis .</detailed_description>

Documented mutation gBRCA1 gBRCA2 predict deleterious suspect deleterious Patients treatment first line platinumbased ( cisplatin , carboplatin oxaliplatin ) regimen metastatic pancreas cancer , receive minimum 16 week continuous platinum treatment evidence progression base investigator 's opinion . Patients receive platinum potentially curative treatment prior cancer ( eg ovarian cancer ) adjuvant/neoadjuvant treatment pancreas cancer eligible provide least 12 month elapse last dose platinumbased treatment initiation platinumbased chemotherapy metastatic pancreas cancer . Major gBRCA1 and/or gBRCA2 mutation consider non detrimental ( eg , `` Variants uncertain clinical significance '' `` Variant unknown significance '' `` Variant , favour polymorphism '' `` benign polymorphism '' etc . ) Progression tumour start first line platinum base chemotherapy metastatic pancreas cancer randomisation .
