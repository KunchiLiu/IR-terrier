	<brief_summary>Laryngeal cancer common Taiwanese population . Before early 80 's , open laryngectomy suggest treatment modality laryngeal cancer . Patients laryngectomy lose speech communicate use prosthesis . So 90 's , medical organ preservation chemoradiation therapy take place operation . Unfortunately , recent review , five-year survival rate decrease even low report 10 year ago . In 1983-1985 68.1 % decrease 64.7 % 1992-1999 . It cancer type decrease survival 24 index cancer . Laser resection laryngeal tumor first report Jako Strong widely use Europe . Dr Steiner colleague develop non-en block resection technique make microscopic resection easily would limited tumor location size much . The investigator use transoral microscopic laser ( TLM ) early glottic cancer report five-year overall survival 97 % . TLM five-year disease control rate report 85 % . There report TLM advance stage laryngeal cancer overall 5-year survival rate achieve high 55 % . Present project plan develop comprehensive organ preservation protocol base microinvasive TLM primary treatment modality early glottic cancer without neck distant metastasis . The object project follow . 1 . Long term outcome perform treatment protocol . The outcome measurement include local control rate , overall disease specific survival , larynx preservation rate . 2 . The difference surgical sample pretreatment image examination . 3 . The role adjuvant therapy . 4 . Management follow-up neck metastasis . 5 . Searching risk factor predictor factor . 6 . Adequate salvage treatment local regional recurrence . 7 . Realizing failure pattern appropriate follow-up protocol accord .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Laryngeal cancer associate cure rate 30 90 % primary treatment irradiation therapy , open surgical excision microinvasive endolaryngeal surgical excision base stage . Prior advance endoscopic surgical technique , radiation therapy without chemotherapy offer treatment less morbidity open surgical resection . Therefore , throughout late part 20th century , radiation therapy become standard management laryngeal cancer . In America , Surveillance , Epidemiology , End Results ( SEER ) Program National Cancer Data Base ( NCDB ) data show survival rate laryngeal cancer decrease 1990 's . Five-year relative survival laryngeal squamous cell carcinoma record NCDB range high 68.1 % 1985 low 62.8 % 1993 . Treatment pattern change increase nonsurgical management irradiation alone chemoradiation . Radiation chemoradiation therapy provide treatment choice preserve larynx . However , increase nonsurgical management parallel increase mortality across year study survival analysis perform ( 1985-1996 ) . In past two decade , evolution microinvasive TLM surgery make possible eradicate tumor preserve laryngeal function . It demonstrate cure rate obtain comparable treatment modality . In addition , morbidity treatment TLM substantially less morbidity associate open surgical technique may less morbidity associate radiation chemoradiation therapy . Therefore , TLM initial treatment modality laryngeal cancer commonly practice . TLM offer advantage form treatment . First usually accomplish single intervention early stage disease- thus decrease overall treatment time cost compare radiation therapy . Second , oppose open surgical technique , resection endoscopic method require tracheotomy airway maintenance . Third , rehabilitation time independent swallow show multiple series reduce compare open surgical technique . And forth , leave opportunity adjuvant salvage therapy . Due advance , TLM surgery laryngeal cancer become widely use recent year focal small lesion also demonstrate comparable survival rate local control rate advance stage form treatment . The primary object study improve tumor control rate organ preservation protocol base microinvasive TLM surgery . This prospective phase II study expect provide evidence future treatment plan laryngeal cancer .</detailed_description>
