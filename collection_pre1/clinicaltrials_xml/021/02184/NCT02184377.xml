	<brief_summary>Mandarin Chinese phonemically distinguish four tone , Tone 1 high-level pitch , Tone 2 high-rising pitch , Tone 3 low-dipping pitch , Tone 4 high-falling pitch The segmental context carry different meaning depend tone . The function deficit cricothyroid ( CT ) muscle , innervated external branch superior laryngeal nerve ( eSLN ) , would impair speech tone adjustment . The defect tone adjustment may interfere communication function Mandarin Chinese speaker language user . This may explain peripheral unilateral vocal fold paralysis ( UVFP ) patient eSLN injury bad outcome sole recurrent laryngeal nerve paralysis . The neuromuscular control laryngeal muscle evaluate laryngeal electromyography ( LEMG ) . The investigator utilize quantified LEMG ( denote Q-LEMG ) previous research measure neuromuscular control thyroarytenoid- lateral cricoarytenoid ( TA-LCA ) adductor complex . However , task measure CT muscle function Q-LEMG develop yet . It thus utmost interest develop standardize task measure neuromuscular function CT muscle Mandarin speaker . In Mandarin speak patient UVFP , lexical tone influence CT muscle discover technique . The investigator also want measure lexical tone correction conventional laryngoplasty influence CT muscle activity . The data lexical tone correlation CT contractile activity important attempt pitch adjust artificial electrolarynx .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Purposes : 1 . Searching standard task measure CT function Q-LEMG . 2 . Correlate data among Q-LEMG activity CT muscle , lexical tone Mandarin vocal cord position impaction vocal function . 3 . Detect influence lexical tone conventional laryngoplasty peripheral UVFP eSLN injury . Study design : The current research two-year study . In first year , investigator develop standardized task quantify LEMG analysis CT muscle control eSLN . In second year , patient acute UVFP enrol study . By comprehensive evaluation include Q-LEMG analysis , impact injection laryngoplasty tone adjustment identify . The result UVFP without CT muscle damage also compare . Predictive outcome : 1 . Developing standard tool , Q-LEMG , measure function CT muscle . 2 . Achieve correlation neuromuscular control lexical tone CT muscle . 3 . Analyze impaction early temporary injection speech modal tone Mandarin speaker neuromuscular control CT muscle . 4 . Applying data tone CT signal future pitch control artificial electrolarynx animal model .</detailed_description>
