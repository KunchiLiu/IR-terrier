	<brief_summary>Purpose : This project ass effectiveness cognitive train add-on intervention drug treatment child adolescent diagnose Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder ( ADHD ) compare placebo training . The cognitive training consist 6 computerized game base principle neuroplastic change . ADHD : current treatment - International clinical guideline indicate pharmacological intervention particular stimulant first-line treatment ADHD . However , 30 % child affect disorder respond medication alone , exhibit partial response tolerate adverse effect . In addition group parent accept use medication treatment ADHD child . In recent year cognitive training receive considerable attention treatment ADHD . The evidence base cognitive training program still form randomize placebo-controlled study . However , approach seem effective either treatment ADHD - others cognitive disorder childhood - tool enhance cognitive ability school performance child adult . No previous study evaluate cognitive intervention clinical trial placebo-controlled intervention adjunctive treatment medication . Additionally , investigator assess brain change associate intervention use neuroimaging ( fMRI ) .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Material Methods Trial design Randomized clinical trial placebo control . This study compare cognitive training program versus placebo condition ass reduction residual symptom , improvement neurocognitive function brain activation change child adolescent ADHD receive stimulant . Sixty subject , six thirteen years-old ADHD confirm Kiddie Schedule Affective Disorders Schizophrenia ( K-SADS ) randomly assign 12 week cognitive placebo training . Participants To include study child adolescent need meet follow criterion ( ) age 6-13 year , ( b ) diagnosis ADHD classify accord criterion Diagnostic Statistical Manual Mental Disorders ( 5th edition ) , ( c ) medicate stabilized psychostimulants partially restore - inattention SNAP score ( mean score parent teacher &gt; = 1 ) , ( ) full scale intelligence quotient ( IQ ) least 80 , ( e ) access computer windows vista 7 speaker , access internet . Participants exclude case ( ) another comorbid psychiatry diagnosis clinically significant require treatment time enter study protocol . Sample Size Calculation There previous study use design propose investigation . Considering reduction 20 % high SNAP-IV score active group intervention ( stimulant + cognitive training ) , sample size group 27 participant standard-deviation magnitude half medium score group ( moderate variability ) , study able detect moderate effect size ( ES = 0,4 ) . Calculating sample loss 10 % group , define sample size per group 30 individual . Cognitive intervention protocol : A portuguese version new Cognitive Computerized Training create partnership Yale University research team . The cognitive training program compose computerized exercise six different game divide multiple level sublevels increase difficulty . During game , several neuropsychological domain require participant working memory , sustain attention , response inhibition others . In session participant play 6 game divide 5 minute block . The aim game engage activate target neurocognitive system This protocol run school . It consist 4 times/week session ( 3 time school 1 time home ) 12 week 30 min duration . The placebo cognitive training ( control group ) contain exposure time active group without element regard cognitive training . Pharmacological protocol All subject must receive pharmacological treatment ADHD stable dose stimulant least 1 month dos inferior 0.3mg/kg/per day methylphenidate 30mg/per day lisdexamphetamine . Any increase dose protocol permit . Neuropsychological protocol An assessment begin intervention pos-treatment do trained neuropsychologist use three test NIH toolbox ( C8Kids platform ) : Flanker Test , Go/NoGo Test List Sorting Test Working Memory neuropsychological battery create team use six test : CPT II ( Conner´s Continuous Performance Test II ) , Digit Span , Spatial Span , Reaction Time Task , Trail Making Test Picture Concepts . Neuroimaging protocol A subgroup 10 participant group draw functional resonance exam ( MRIf ) immediately cognitive placebo training . During exam neuropsychological test ( Go/NoGo ; N-Back - work memory - SAT - sustain attention test ) . Statistical method Statistical analysis perform Statistical Package Social Sciences ( SPSS ) 12.0 . The univariate analysis perform student test / Mann-Whitney continuous variable Chi-Square test ( X² ) / Fischer test categorical variable . The variable present relationship outcome maintain multivariate model . The effective intervention time assess analysis mixed model .</detailed_description>
