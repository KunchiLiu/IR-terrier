	<brief_summary>The overall objective study conduct two-group randomize control trial ( RCT ) compare two treatment provide telephone - cognitive-behavioral base physical therapy ( CBPT ) program focus self-management strategy education program postoperative recovery - effective improve patient-centered outcome old adult recover lumbar spine surgery degenerative condition . Our central hypothesis CBPT intervention focus self-management decrease pain disability improve general health , physical activity physical function community-dwelling adult undergoing spine surgery , reduction fear movement increase pain self-efficacy .</brief_summary>
