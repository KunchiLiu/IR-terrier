	<brief_summary>This single-centre , 5-cohort , randomized open-label , parallel-group study healthy volunteer subject . This study aim provide sufficient pharmacokinetic ( PK ) evidence support safe usage Tafenoquine ( TQ ) study market Artemisinin-based Combination Therapies ( ACTs ) standard care patient Plasmodium vivax malaria ( i.e. , co administration TQ ) . The objective study ass pharmacokinetics , safety tolerability TQ co-administered chosen ACTs ( AL DHA + PQP ) , administer concomitantly healthy subject . Specifically , study evaluate whether drug-drug interaction TQ ACTs interaction consider clinically significant . The co-primary objective study characterize effect 300 milligram ( mg ) single dose TQ pharmacokinetics ; change ( area concentration-time curve 0 time ) AUC ( 0-t ) , AUC ( 0-infinity ) , maximum observed concentration ( Cmax ) two Artemisinin-based Combination Therapies ( ACT ) accord prescribe dose co-administered well effect ACTs PK TQ . A total 120 subject ( 24 subject 5 cohort ) plan enrol order ensure target sample size least 22 subject complete study per cohort . All subject arrive unit least 24 hour prior dose discharge 72-hour post first dose assessment complete . Subjects return outpatient visit Days 7 , 14 , 21 , 28 , 56 first dose .</brief_summary>
