	<brief_summary>This study open-label , randomize , single dose , three way crossover study healthy male subject . The aim study evaluate pharmacokinetic parameter two formulation fix dose combination ( FDC ) capsule dutasteride tamsulosin hydrochloride ( HCl ) ( 0.5 milligram [ mg ] /0.2 mg ) relative co-administration dutasteride 0.5 mg capsule tamsulosin hydrochloride 0.2 mg tablet feed fasted state . Approximately 84 healthy adult male subject enrol study split two cohort ( fed fast ) , allow approximately 36 subject complete cohort . Subjects cohorts receive single oral dos 3 treatment period randomize one six different treatment sequence ( ABC , ACB , BAC , BCA , CAB , CBA ) wherein A= FDC1 : Dutasteride tamsulosin HCl ( 0.5 mg/0.2 mg ) , B= FDC2 : Dutasteride tamsulosin HCl ( 0.5 mg/0.2 mg ) , C= Co-administration commercial formulation dutasteride ( 0.5mg ) tamsulosin HCl ( 0.2mg ) . Each treatment period separate minimum 28 day washout period . Blood sample pharmacokinetic analysis take regular interval dose . Safety assess measurement blood pressure , heart rate review adverse event .</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Males age 18 65 year age inclusive , time signing informed consent . Healthy determine responsible experienced physician , base medical evaluation include medical history , physical examination , laboratory test cardiac monitoring . A subject clinical abnormality laboratory parameter ( ) is/are specifically list inclusion exclusion criterion , outside reference range population study may include Investigator , consultation GSK Medical Monitor require , agree document find unlikely introduce additional risk factor interfere study procedure . Body weight &gt; =50 kilogram ( kg ) body mass index ( BMI ) within range 18 32 kg/m^2 ( square meter ) ( inclusive ) . Male subject female partner childbearing potential must agree use condom . This criterion must follow time first dose study medication 50 day postlast dose . Capable give write informed consent , include compliance requirement restriction list consent form . Able swallow retain oral medication . Aspartate aminotransferase ( AST ) Alanine aminotransferase ( ALT ) &lt; 2x ( Upper limit normal ) ULN ; alkaline phosphatase bilirubin &lt; =1.5xULN ( isolated bilirubin &gt; 1.5xULN acceptable bilirubin fractionate direct bilirubin &lt; 35 % ) . Based single average correct QT ( QTc ) value triplicate electrocardiogram ( ECGs ) obtain brief recording period : QT duration correct heart rate Fridericia 's formula ( QTcF ) &lt; 450 millisecond ( msec ) Criteria Based Upon Medical Histories Current chronic history liver disease , know hepatic biliary abnormality ( exception Gilbert 's syndrome asymptomatic gallstone ) . History sensitivity study medication , component thereof history drug allergy , opinion investigator GlaxoSmithKline ( GSK ) Medical Monitor , contraindicate participation . History postural hypotension , dizziness , poor hydration , vertigo , vasovagal reaction sign symptom orthostasis , opinion investigator could exacerbate tamsulosin result put subject risk injury . History regular alcohol consumption within 6 month study define US site : average weekly intake &gt; 14 drink male &gt; 7 drink female . One drink equivalent 12 gram ( g ) alcohol : 12 ounce ( 360 millilitre [ mL ] ) beer , 5 ounce ( 150 mL ) wine 1.5 ounce ( 45 mL ) 80 proof distil spirit . History diabetes peptic ulcer disease uncontrolled medical management . History breast cancer clinical breast examination find suggestive malignancy . History malignancy within past five year , except basal cell carcinoma skin . Subjects prior malignancy evidence disease least past 5 year eligible . Prior medical history evidence prostate cancer ( e.g. , positive biopsy , suspicious ultrasound , suspicious digital rectal examination [ DRE ] ) . Patients suspicious ultrasound DRE negative biopsy within precede 6 month stable prostate specific antigen ( PSA ) eligible study . Note : The investigator make every appropriate effort exclude possibility prostate cancer , include consideration prostate biopsy subject know abnormal PSA . Criteria Based Upon Diagnostic Assessments A positive prestudy Hepatitis B surface antigen positive Hepatitis C antibody result within 3 month screen ; A positive prestudy drug/alcohol screen . A positive test Human Immunodeficiency Virus ( HIV ) antibody . Other Criteria Where participation study would result donation blood blood product excess 500 mL within 56 day period . The subject participate clinical trial receive investigational product within following time period prior first dose day current study : 30 day , 5 halflives twice duration biological effect investigational product ( whichever longer ) . Exposure four new chemical entity within 12 month prior first dose day . Unable refrain use prescription nonprescription drug , include vitamin , herbal dietary supplement ( include St John 's Wort ) within 7 day ( 14 day drug potential enzyme inducer ) 5 halflives ( whichever longer ) prior first dose study medication , unless opinion Investigator GSK Medical Monitor medication interfere study procedure compromise subject safety .</criteria>
