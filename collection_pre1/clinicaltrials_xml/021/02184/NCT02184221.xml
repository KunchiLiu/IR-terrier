	<brief_summary>Transcranial magnetic stimulation ( TMS ) effective alternative pharmacotherapy major depressive disorder , effectiveness clear due stimulate region , frequency intensity magnet field . Standard TMS technique stimulate superficial cortical area electric field decrease rapidly function tissue depth，while depression also interconnect deep neuronal region . Deep-brain magnetic stimulation ( DSM , deep TMS , DTMS ) allow stimulation deeper cortical region . Previous research demonstrate alpha frequency ( 8-13 Hz ) EEG activity may particular relevance response antidepressant , reduction alpha frequency ( 8-13 Hz ) could lead negative symptom . It report alpha frequency low-field magnetic stimulation could improve depressive symptom . The objective study compare effectiveness two different parameter DMS treatment major depressive disorder . The change brain derive neurotropic factor ( BDNF ) also investigate make relevant analysis improvement depressive symptom .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Deep-brain Magnetic Stimulation ( DMS ) Treatment Major Depressive Disorder</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The study design randomize , double-blinded , active-controlled trial major depressive disorder . Patients male female , 18 60 year age , right-handed , outpatient inpatient status , diagnosis major depressive episode ( single recurrent ) DSM-IV . The HAMD-17 total score le 18 enrollment . The patient drug free least 30 day enter trial . The eligible patient randomize one two treatment group use 1:1 ratio alpha frequency ( high frequency ) 0.5Hz ( low frequency ) group . Throughout course study , DMS session administer trained physician 20 minute time , 5 session per week , 6 consecutive week . Raters blind treatment arm perform evaluation . The effective outcome assess HAMD-17 HAMA every two week include randomization . Serum BDNF level also test visit ( Week 0 , 2 , 4 6 ) . The safety study assess adverse event reporting , clinical laboratory measurement physical examination . Primary efficacy measure assess base decrease HAMD-17 randomization endpoint ( Week 6 ) .</detailed_description>
