	<brief_summary>The primary goal preliminary project study effect etanercept , medicine approve Health Canada treatment rheumatoid arthritis , inflammation certain blood vessel . In particular , inflammation aorta carotid artery study . This study 's goal determine etanercept ( block TNF ( tissue necrosis factor ) alpha ) could effect blood vessel inflammation . As well , information study use determine number patient recruit future study . This study evaluate effect etanercept 10 patient rheumatoid arthritis one rheumatology clinic Montreal . The 10 patient recruited Montreal Rheumatology Institute ( Institut de Rhumatologie de Montr√©al ) image blood vessel take medical imaging center analyze Montreal Heart Institute . To evaluate vascular inflammation subject undergo PET scan ( Positron Emission Tomography ) .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Etanercept Rheumatoid Arthritis Vascular Inflammation</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This study 16 week , single center , open label trial , study effect etanercept vascular inflammation ascend aorta carotid artery patient rheumatoid arthritis ( RA ) . Patients active RA already receive methotrexate least 3 month receive etanercept 16 week . Etanercept administer sub-cutaneously use dose approved Canadian product monograph RA ( 50 mg every week ) . Patients continue methotrexate stable dose study unless dose reduction cessation require judge necessary study investigator . Positron Emission Tomography ( PET ) Scan perform baseline after16 week study treatment etanercept . At end study , PET Scan image analyze blinded manner Montreal Heart Institute core laboratory . Safety assess use adverse event collection laboratory hematology chemistry analysis ( screen Week 4 ) pregnancy test .</detailed_description>
