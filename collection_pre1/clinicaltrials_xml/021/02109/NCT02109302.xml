	<brief_summary>The main objective study identify first genetic etiology primary Premature Ejaculation ( PE ) . We test evaluate existence genetic determinism confer susceptibility life-long syndrome ( primary premature ejaculation ) patient . To end , plan establish collection biological sample database patient extreme syndrome , analyze Genome Wide analysis . This lead improvement biological understanding , `` knowledge '' physician disease , improve patient ' quality life . Not PE case physiopathology treatment efficiency , depend specific mechanism involve clinical context . Our work make possible develop new therapeutic approach suitable large proportion individual present PE . This integrative approach combine researcher , patient ethic committee facilitate profound reflection , promote creation suitable structure capable receive patient appropriate consultation . This unique study PE also favor industrial partnership .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>2.1 Main Objective - To identify molecular basis primary premature ejaculation ( PPE ) humans development new adapt therapy . - Check confirm genetic hypothesis PPE fill void genetic knowledge syndrome . - Improve knowledge physician disease increase comfort life patient . 2.2 Secondary Objectives - Provide basis new therapeutic approach . - Expanded knowledge aetiology PE allow well management patient . - Develop strategy prevent consequence , sometimes severe , condition intimate , personal , social professional life patient . Because PE pathophysiology treatment success depend relevance specific mechanism clinical form concern . - Increase comfort life patient . - Eliminate public prejudice base misconception .</detailed_description>
