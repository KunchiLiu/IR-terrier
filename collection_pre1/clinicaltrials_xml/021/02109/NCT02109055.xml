	<brief_summary>The major cause mortality worldwide due cardiovascular disease . A way treat disease coronary artery bypass grafting , one common surgical procedure world . The incidence post-operative complication contribute functional decline patient , reduce quality life post-discharge mortality . Also , cardiac surgery lead change lung capacity respiratory muscle strength , cause decrease function lung . Physical therapy prove effective tool combat change result cardiac surgery , demonstrate beneficial result pulmonary function , functional capacity , peripheral respiratory muscle strength . The Pilates method study therapeutic way healthy subject various kind disease , study literature evaluate effect method patient coronary artery bypass surgery . The aim study investigate effect Pilates functional capacity , flow lung volume , respiratory peripheral muscle strength coronary artery bypass grafting . Randomized clinical trial patient eligible elective coronary artery bypass surgery , randomly allocate two group : conventional physiotherapy group ( n = 15 ) Pilates method associate conventional physiotherapy group ( n = 15 ) . The outcome assess blinded evaluator data randomization perform electronic randomization.The intervention take place length stay hospital , totalize maximum six day intervention . It expect application Pilates method exercise method associate conventional physiotherapy patient postoperative coronary artery bypass graft improves functional capacity , flow lung volume respiratory peripheral muscle strength .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Application Exercises Based Pilates Coronary Artery Bypass Grafting</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The exercise program hold period hospitalization six day , often two three session per day , total 12 session . The intervention start first day postoperatively . The program may exceed 30 % maximum heart rate reserve patient calculate Karvonen formula ( Karvonen , Kentala et al. , 1957 ) . The exercise conduct patient 's bedside , use light resistance spring represent low possible burden spring use Pilates method . The exercise perform upper limb alternate leave right upper limb likewise would run low limb mean protocol consist four exercise limit resistance patient interrupt pre-established criterion . One set exercise range two minute exercise hold . In first three day intervention 10 repetition exercise remain three day total 15 repetition movement perform .</detailed_description>
