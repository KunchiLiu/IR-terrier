	<brief_summary>Despite early goal-directed maintenance normal macrocirculation , reduction 60-day mortality patient severe sepsis septic shock remain unsatisfied ( 56.9 % 44.3 % ) . One major cause high mortality microcirculatory dysfunction . Delayed diagnosis treatment microcirculatory dysfunction may cause tissue hypoperfusion result multiple organ dysfunction death . Dexmedetomidine highly selective Î±2-adrenoreceptor agonist exhibit sedative analgesic effect . Recent study suggest dexmedetomidine also anti-coagulation anti-inflammatory effect , reduce mortality endotoxemic rat patient severe sepsis . The investigator conduct two animal study one clinical trial investigate effect dexmedetomidine microcirculatory dysfunction organ injury rat endotoxemia patient severe sepsis septic shock . Sixty patient severe sepsis septic shock enrol randomized control group dexmedetomidine group . In control group , patient treat accord clinical practice guideline . If sedation require , non-dexmedetomidine sedative agent use . In dexmedetomidine group , patient treat accord clinical practice guideline , also receive continuous infusion dexmedetomidine ( infusion rate range 0.1 0.7 mcg/kg/h ) 24 hour need . The sublingual microcirculation , serum level Endocan , NGAL ( Neutrophil Gelatinase-Associated Lipocalin ) , BNP ( B-type natriuretic peptide ) examine preset time point 24 hour . The vital sign , hemodynamic parameter , survival 28-day 90-day record analyze .</brief_summary>
