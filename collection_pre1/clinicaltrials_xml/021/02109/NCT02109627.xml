	<criteria>Relapsed refractory AML define one follow criterion : 1 . First relapse within 12 month date first CR CRi 2 . Persistent AML document bone marrow biopsy least 28 day day 1 first induction cycle cytotoxic chemotherapy 3 . Hypercellular bone marrow great 20 % cellularity 10 % blast least 14 day first induction cycle day 1 Age &gt; =18 Prior induction therapy include two cycle cytotoxic chemotherapy least one induction cycle must consist anthracycline anthracenedione cytarabine combination reasonable schedule/dose accord discretion investigator Histologically confirm AML hematopathology review perform within four week prior study entry Ejection fraction &gt; =40 % transthoracic echocardiogram radionuclide ventriculogram , i.e . MUGA scan Treatment nonhematologic malignancy great 6 month prior enrollment acceptable . Transplantation AML ( allogeneic autologous ) allow unless within 90 day study entry No active graft versus host disease ( GVHD ) immunosuppression prevention treatment GVHD within two week study entry Prior treatment myelodysplastic syndrome myeloproliferative neoplasm hypomethylating agent acceptable . Cytoreduction therapy plasmapheresis hydroxyurea acceptable . Females must negative serum pregnancy test 24 hour prior start treatment surgically biologically sterile postmenopausal ( amenorrheic least 12 month ) Adequate liver function define total bilirubin ≤ 2.0 mg/dL ( ≤ 3.0 mg/dL patient know Gilbert 's syndrome ) AST/ALT ≤ 3 time upper limit normal , unless think due AML Adequate renal function creatinine ≤ 2.0 mg/dL The effect ficlatuzumab develop human fetus unknown . For reason cytarabine pregnancy category D , woman childbearing potential men must agree use adequate contraception : hormone , barrier method birth control , abstinence prior study entry duration study participation . Should woman become pregnant suspect pregnant partner participate study , inform treat physician immediately . Men treat enrol protocol must also agree use adequate contraception prior study , duration study participation , least one month completion study drug administration . Ability understand write informed consent document , willingness sign Acute promyelocytic leukemia ( FAB M3 AML ) More 2 cycle prior induction therapy AML Allogeneic autologous transplant AML infusion stem cell within 90 day study entry active immunosuppressive therapy ( GVHD ) within 2 week study entry Cytarabine contain regimen excess 2 g/m2/day within 6 month study entry Chemotherapy , radiation , immunotherapy , within 2 week prior study entry , specify inclusion criterion ( hydroxyurea hypomethylating agent ) Known active HIV , hepatitis B C infection . Exception patient hepatitis B antiviral low viral load , determine discretion investigator . Uncontrolled infection Uncontrolled intercurrent illness psychiatric illness/social situation would limit compliance study requirement Active second malignancy opinion PI may interfere adversely affected treatment . Prior exposure investigational agent anticMet , antiHGF antiVEGF direct therapy within six month prior study entry Prior grade 4 toxicity attribute cytarabine Known suspect drug sensitivity cytarabine investigational agent ficlatuzumab Inability provide consent Pregnant woman exclude study effect ficlatuzumab develop fetus remain unknown cytarabine pregnancy risk category D drug know teratogenic abortifacient effect . Because potential adverse event nurse infant secondary treatment mother ficlatuzumab cytarabine , breastfeed discontinue study . Patients become pregnant study remove study pregnancy confirm .</criteria>
