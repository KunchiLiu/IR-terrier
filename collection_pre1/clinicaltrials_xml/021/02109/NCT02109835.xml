	<brief_summary>The purpose study identify sub-group diabetic patient high risk progression coronary disease also likely suffer heart attack/angina heart failure . The total number patient recruit study 250 type-2 diabetes know heart disease . These patient objective measure function lining artery , CT scan artery heart ultrasound scan heart artery neck do baseline along blood test identification new marker malfunction line inflammation artery . Patients follow 18 month . During follow-up visit , addition blood test , CT scan heart artery ultrasound heart artery neck repeat assess progression non-calcified , calcify mixed plaque coronary artery .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Hypothesis : We hypothesise combination CT coronary angiography , ultrasound heart artery neck , evaluation expression genetic marker bio-markers blood help identify diabetic patient high risk heart disease progression , result angina , heart attack , heart failure cardiovascular death . Previous study use coronary calcium scan diabetic patient show great progression calcify plaque coronary artery high risk heart attack . However , coronary calcium scan identify calcify plaque able pick non-calcified , cholesterol rich plaque . Cholesterol rich non-calcified plaque often associate witn acute heart attack . CT coronary angiography identify calcified non-calcified plaque therefore add significantly predictive ability . Certain chemical substance ( biomarkers ) measure blood indicate severity plaque burden inflammation coronary artery . A combination CT coronary angiography , expression genetic marker , measure function cell line blood vessel biomarkers help identify diabetic patient high risk heart attack , allow u start appropriate risk reduction treatment patient . In previous study coronary artery calcium , patient suffer heart attack also high progression coronary artery calcium ( CAC ) score . In diabetic , particular , patient poor control blood glucose also great progression CAC score . In order test validity hypothesis , decide base study population establish diabetic difficult control blood pressure , high cholesterol chronic complication small blood vessel , i.e . involvement retina ( back eye ) peripheral nerve well protein urine . Patients chronic complication diabetes known high incidence heart disease well . Methodology Timetable : Patients recruit Diabetes clinic NHS hospital North West London . If eligible trial , informed consent obtain patient general practitioner subsequently inform participation trial . Once recruited trial , CT coronary angiogram ( CTCA , CT arteries heart ) , ultrasound scan heart carotid artery neck well measure endothelial function perform Wellington Hospital St. Johns Wood , London within 1-2 week . At time , blood sample also obtain bio-markers . A report CTCA forward consultant in-charge patient 's care well GP . If narrowing moderate degree ( 70 % ) note CT angiogram , patient bring back Wellington Hospital within 2 week heart perfusion scan evaluate relative discrepancy flow blood heart muscle help plan management . If significant reduction blood flow note perfusion scan , patient refer back consultant clinical management . During first visit Wellington Hospital CT scan , blood sample take stored on-site biomarker analysis . Patients follow 18 month time recruitment trial , second CTCA , ultrasound artery neck perform assess degree progression calcium cholesterol deposit within coronary artery thickness line artery neck addition blood sample collection bio-markers . Patients significant narrowing coronary artery ( &gt; 70 % ) require stent insert first scan exclude follow . Patients normal coronary artery initial scan also exclude follow-up .</detailed_description>
