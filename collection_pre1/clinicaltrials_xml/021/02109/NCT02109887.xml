	<brief_summary>PCP ( Pneumocystis jiroveci pneumonia ) one important opportunistic infection immunocompromised patient include HIV-infected patient , transplant recipient , immunosuppressant user . About one third non-HIV patient PCP evidence co-infection CMV . In difficult clinical situation , physicians difficulty decide whether anti-CMV treament help patient evidence CMV co-infection . However , objective test differentiate true co-infection CMV innocent bystander CMV PCP . The investigator thus evaluate usefulness CMV-specific ELISPOT assay patient PCP differentiate true co-infection CMV inocent bystander CMV . This finding may guide physician decide anti-CMV treatment patient PCP CMV co-infection .</brief_summary>
