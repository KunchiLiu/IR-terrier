	<brief_summary>Two key requirement discharge hospital major abdominal surgery adequate oral analgesia resumption oral nutrition . Up 40 % patient suffer delayed discharge abdominal surgery due delay return gut function , manifest nausea , vomit , constipation abdominal distension . Opiates derivative mainstay postoperative analgesic regimen abdominal surgery highly effective achieve adequate pain control . However , opioids cause impaired gut function reduce normal forward propulsion increase gut spasm . Opioid receptor blocker Alvimopan counteract effect accelerate postoperative gut recovery expensive cause cardiac complication ; alternative painkiller non-steroidal anti-inflammatory less effective opioids link increase risk anastomotic leak . Targinact combination prolong release opioid analgesic ( oxycodone hydrochloride ) naloxone hydrochloride ( opioid receptor blocker ) . The formulation product confines naloxone action gut reduce unwanted side-effects gut function . Targinact show patient chronic severe pain provide comparable analgesia opioid analgesic whilst reduce unwanted side-effect constipation . The Investigators wish test hypothesis Targinact provide adequate analgesia colonic resection reduce postoperative gastrointestinal dysfunction . The surgical procedure choose test hypothesis laparoscopic segmental colectomy , consistently reproducible intervention postoperative gut dysfunction rate 40 % ( prospective data Edinburgh Colorectal Unit ) . The main outcome study return normal gut function time plan discharge ( Day 3 ) .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Comparison Targinact vs. Oxycodone Gut Function After Colorectal Surgery</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Study hypothesis : Targinact effective oral analgesia major colorectal surgery associate less gut dysfunction Oxycodone . Up 40 % patient suffer delayed return gut function elective colorectal surgery , lead prolonged hospital stay high inpatient cost . For patient , characterise variety symptom include nausea vomiting , delay ability regain normal oral intake , abdominal discomfort/distension constipation . Although post-operative gut dysfunction tend resolve spontaneously 3-7 day , symptom supportive treatment ( nasogastric tube insertion , repeat venous cannulation intravenous fluid administration etc ) unpleasant . Elective colorectal surgery common hospital intervention hence reduction prevalence post-operative gut dysfunction would expect benefit large number patient attendant reduction health service cost . The objective aligns well current national dissemination Enhanced Recovery Surgery programmes UK Department Health Scottish Government . Post-operative gut dysfunction multifactorial . Opioid analgesics contributory Enhanced Recovery Surgery ( ERAS ) program emphasise strategy minimise systemic opioid use ( eg use regional local anaesthetic technique ) . Targinact evaluate set short-term post operative analgesia colorectal surgery offer potential achieve effective analgesia low incidence gut dysfunction therefore important role within ERAS program colorectal surgery . Oxycodone currently oral opioid analgesic choice unit patient prescribe combination oxycodone oxynorm step-down analgesia follow cessation systemic epidural analgesia , often combination fentanyl patch . Data collect patient hospital record questionnaires administer principal investigator research study nurse . Multiple measure employ record presence good function absence dysfunction . - Time first flatus - Time first bowel movement - Time surgery cessation iv fluid - Total dose rescue antiemetic ( protocol ondansetron include ) - Reinstitution iv fluid ( Y/N ) Quantity laxative use - Measurement oral nutritional intake : Preoperative intake record mean recall diary . Postoperative oral intake record participant use food diary 7 day date surgery . Energy intake estimate use CompEat Pro® forWindows® ( Nutrition Systems , Banbury , UK ) . Time attain maintain 80 % normal solid food intake percentage Recommended Nutritional Intake ( RNI ) achieve day 1-3 day 5-7 surgery use comparison study group . - Validated nausea vomit score ( Miles Wengritzky ) - Presence abdominal distension ( Y/N ) - 13C Stable Isotope Gastric Empyting Breath Test measure gastric motility second postoperative morning . The technique previously use Edinburgh Department Surgery validate reproducible accurate measurement upper GI motility . Additional data record : - Patient demographic , co morbidity , regular medication - Pre op bowel function questionnaire - Postoperative nausea vomit prediction data ( Apfel score ) - Day 3 achievement discharge criterion ( pain control oral analgesia , tolerate adequate oral diet fluid , independently mobile willing go home ) Y/N - 30-day/Inpatient mortality - Duration hospital admission - Complications ( record organ system severity assess Clavien/Dindo scale ) - Unscheduled readmission hospital within 30 day discharge - Patient-reported outcome questionnaire</detailed_description>
