	<brief_summary>Aortic valve disease common form heart valve disease major burden society . Aortic valve disease also expect become prevalent age Canadian population . Currently , 1 million individual North America aortic stenosis , narrow aortic valve , lead symptom heart failure sometimes death . Valve replacement potential cost complication remain avenue treatment , symptom develop . Despite major importance disease , currently medical treatment prevent development aortic stenosis.The lack preventative treatment stem large part poor understanding cause disease . Using cutting-edge genetic technology , investigator recently identify individual genetic predisposition elevation type cholesterol normally screen , call lipoprotein ( ) , much high risk develop aortic valve disease . The investigator also show lipoprotein ( ) cause harden valve , early sign valve narrow . The investigator plan evaluate randomize controlled trial whether lower unusual form cholesterol early stage disease could slow stop development aortic valve narrow The investigator currently propose pilot project evaluate feasibility type study . If successful , propose treatment would notable two way . First , would represent first medical treatment prevent valve disease , could lead major reduction societal burden important disease . And second , would herald major success genomic medicine would represent one first treatment borne recent genetic study . In way , proposal could significantly impact health many Canadians also highlight innovative research perform Canada . Recruitment ( n=238 ) project echocardiography laboratory McGill University affiliate hospital . Individuals aortic sclerosis mild aortic stenosis ( aortic valve area [ AVA ] &gt; 1.5 cm2 , mean gradient [ MG ] &lt; 25 mmHG ) high Lp ( ) eligible inclusion propose study .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Screening : Potentially eligible participant echocardiography laboratory screen member research team inclusion exclusion criterion ask review sign consent form explain study . Run-in : Participants elevate Lp ( ) normal liver renal index , meet inclusion exclusion criterion start low dose niacin ( 500 mg/d ) 6 week run-in phase prior randomization ass tolerability compliance intervention . The niacin dose increase 500 mg increment weekly , tolerate , maximum 1500 mg/day ( Participants remain compliant &gt; 85 % ( pill count self-report ) tolerate least 1500 mg/d niacin least 2 week undergo randomization 1500 mg/d immediate release niacin match placebo . Randomization : perform via Internet website participant give unique identifier match allocate drug kit.Blocking use random block 2 4 ensure similar number patient randomize two arm study study center . The study double blind - neither patient , physician , study personnel know participant receive active treatment . After 6-week run-in phase , participant able tolerate intervention randomize 1:1 niacin extend release placebo . After randomization , treatment phase 2 year ( 104 week ) . Data collect 5 visit : ( ) Randomization visit ; ( ii ) 6-month follow-up visit ; ( iii ) 12-month follow-up visit ; ( iv ) 18-month follow-up visit ; ( v ) Final visit ( 24-month ) .

Cardiac CT ( ii ) Follow-up visit ( 6 , 12 18 month randomization ) Collection clinical data ( : side-effects ) , compliance therapy blood .
