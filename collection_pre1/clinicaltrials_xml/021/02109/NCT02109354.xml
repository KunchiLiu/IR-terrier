	<brief_summary>The HIV Vaccine Trials Network ( HVTN ) study test 2 experimental HIV vaccine combination 2 licensed vaccine tetanus hepatitis B. HIV virus cause AIDS . Tetanus infection cause muscular spasm . Hepatitis B virus cause liver failure . About 100 people take part study multiple site . The US National Institutes Health ( NIH ) pay study . We study answer several question . - Are HIV study vaccine safe give people ? - Are people able take HIV study vaccine without become uncomfortable ? - How people 's immune system respond HIV study vaccine ? ( Your immune system protect disease . ) - Can people 's immune response tetanus hepatitis B vaccine help u understand immune system might respond HIV study vaccine ? - Is common immune response license vaccine like tetanus hepatitis B vaccine ?</brief_summary>
