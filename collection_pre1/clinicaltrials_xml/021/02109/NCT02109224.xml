	<brief_summary>This phase I trial study side effect best dose ibrutinib treat B-cell non-Hodgkin lymphoma return respond treatment patient human immunodeficiency virus ( HIV ) infection . Ibrutinib may stop growth cancer cell block enzymes need cell growth . It yet know whether safe patient HIV infection receive ibrutinib also take anti-HIV drug .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Ibrutinib Treating Relapsed Refractory B-Cell Non-Hodgkin Lymphoma Patients With HIV Infection</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To evaluate safety tolerability single-agent ibrutinib combination antiretroviral therapy ( ART ) specifically respect ibrutinib metabolism HIV-infected patient relapse refractory B-cell neoplasm . II . To determine maximum tolerate dose ( MTD ) ibrutinib set . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . To characterize ibrutinib pharmacokinetics relation ART-cytochrome P450 , family 3 , subfamily A , polypeptide 4 ( CYP3A4 ) interaction . II . To describe toxicity relation plasma concentration ibrutinib main metabolite . III . To estimate objective response rate , clinical benefit , time tumor response progression , 6-month 1-year progression-free overall survival . IV . To describe change HIV viral load , immunologic parameter , Epstein-Barr virus ( EBV ) human herpesvirus 8 ( HHV-8 ) deoxyribonucleic acid ( DNA ) copy number plasma peripheral blood mononuclear cell ( PBMC ) relation ibrutinib therapy . OUTLINE : This dose-escalation study . Patients receive ibrutinib orally ( PO ) daily ( QD ) day 1-28 . Courses repeat every 28 day 2 year absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . After completion study treatment , patient follow 30 day .</detailed_description>
