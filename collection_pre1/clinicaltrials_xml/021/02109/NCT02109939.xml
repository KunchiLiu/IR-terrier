	<brief_title>Impact GeneSight Psychotropic Response Psychotropic Treatment Outpatients Suffering From Major Depressive Disorder ( MDD ) Having Had Inadequate Response Least One Psychotropic Medication Included GeneSight Psychotropic</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Major depressive disorder ( MDD ) highly prevalent ( Hasin et al. , 2005 ) mental disorder lead source disease burden worldwide ( Lopez et al. , 2006 ) . Epidemiological study estimate 12-month lifetime prevalence MDD United States 5.3 % 13.2 % , respectively ( review Blanco et al. , 2010 ) . MDD expect second great cause disability 2020 show cause significant morbidity , affect people 's ability work , function relationship , engage social activity . Moreover , MDD increase risk suicidal ideation , attempt suicide , death complete suicide . Prospective longitudinal study patient sample show MDD chronic illness , characterize remit recurrent depressive episode ( Solomon et al. , 1997 ; Mueller et al. , 1999 ) . A major depressive episode characterize low mood inability experience pleasure ( anhedonia ) , , 2 week , combine several cognitive vegetative symptom occurrence distress impairment ( review Rot et al. , 2009 ) . In US , nearly 1 5 people experience major depressive episode point life ( review Rot et al. , 2009 ) . Drugs currently available treat depression fall category main effect increase norepinephrine ( NE ) ( tricyclic tetracyclic antidepressant [ TCAs ] ) , increase serotonin ( 5-HT ) ( selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor [ SSRIs ] ) , increase NE 5-HT ( monoamine oxidase inhibitor [ MAOIs ] serotonin norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor [ SNRIs ] ) . While antidepressant achieve similar level efficacy , treatment failure relatively high range 30 60 % ( Simpson DePaulo ) . Additionally , many compound associated significant adverse event ( AEs ) . The GeneSight Psychotropic product pharmacogenomic decision support tool help clinician make inform , evidence-based decision proper drug selection , base test clinically important genetic variant multiple pharmacokinetic pharmacodynamic gene affect patient 's ability tolerate respond medication . The GeneSight Psychotropic product contain commonly prescribe antidepressant antipsychotic medication , include full representation SSRI SNRI drug class . Tricyclic antidepressant , MAOI , typical atypical antipsychotic also represent . The clinical utility GeneSight Psychotropic evaluate three previous prospective trial . Hall-Flavin et al report result open-label pilot study ( n = 44 ) compare GeneSight guide treatment treatment usual ( TAU ) without benefit pharmacogenomic testing ( 2012 ) . The GeneSight guide arm demonstrate 30.8 % improvement HAM-D17 score end 8 week treatment period , compare 18.2 % improvement TAU arm ( p = 0.04 ) . Results large ( n = 165 ) open-label trial ( Hall-Flavin , et al 2013 ) mirror finding , demonstrate 46.9 % improvement HAMD17 score GeneSight arm , compare 29.9 % improvement TAU arm ( p &lt; 0.0001 ) . The third trial use randomize , double-blind trial design ( n = 51 ) . Due small sample size , trial underpowered detect significant difference improvement two arm ( TAU GeneSight ) . However , effect size improvement reflect see previous trial . The GeneSight group experience 30.8 % improvement HAMD17 , compare 20.7 % TAU . Odds ratios response calculate , show GeneSight-guided subject 2.14 time great likelihood response compare TAU subject , similar 4.67 ( small trial ) 2.06 ( large trial ) odds ratio calculate two study . Previous study utilize open-label design show significant improvement patient outcome follow use GeneSight test . However , although effect size similar see open-label study , small ( n = 51 ) blind , randomize control trial detect statistically significant outcome . Therefore , primary rationale trial replicate previous finding improvement clinical outcome subject treat benefit GeneSight test utilizing double-blind , randomize control trial ( RCT ) design . It expect result trial use inform guideline use pharmacogenomic testing treatment major depressive disorder . Results may also share regulatory body United States abroad .</detailed_description>
