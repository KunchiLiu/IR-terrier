	<brief_summary>There preliminary data suggest patient suffer non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus , treat metformin , improve local tumor control . A reduction tumor 's hypoxia may responsible phenomenon . Therefore , aim study test hypothesis three cohort patient suffer advanced stage non-small cell lung cancer undergo concurrent radiochemotherapy : 1 . Patients diabetes mellitus treat metformin ; 2 . Patients insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus treat metformin ; 3 . The remain patient serve control .

	<detailed_description>There preliminary clinical preclinical data suggest patient suffer non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus , treat metformin , improve local tumor control . The reduction oxygen consumption tumor cell thus relative reduction tumor 's hypoxia may responsible . Non-small cell lung cancer frequent solid tumor many Western country number one cause cancer-related death . Even though introduction concurrent chemoradiotherapy improve local tumor control thus overall survival , 5-year overall survival still low 14 % . Furthermore , many patient eligible undergo concurrent treatment thus reduce chance defeat disease . Additionally , concurrent chemoradiotherapy associate increased toxicity compare sequential treatment . Therefore , alternative additive improve effect radiotherapy without increase toxicity unbearable level search . One possible pharmaceutical metformin ; many patient use past without evident increase toxicity , cheap , widely available . Thus , aim study test hypothesis metformin increase overall survival without enhance treatment-related toxicity . For mean , three cohort patient suffer advanced stage non-small cell lung cancer undergo concurrent radiochemotherapy : 1 . Patients diabetes mellitus treat metformin ; 2 . Patients insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus treat metformin ; 3 . The remain patient serve control . Using Kaplan-Meier statistic well uni- multivariate analysis , overall survival toxicity cohort compare . Other potentially confound factor test secondary endpoint .</detailed_description>
