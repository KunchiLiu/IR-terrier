	<brief_summary>The investigator conduct two-arm , randomize control trial effect emotional content online video extent video disseminate ( forward ) . Dissemination assess term number view increase result share forward video . In study , experiment video control video , approximately 2.5 minute long , uploaded YouTube , visit video share website . The video concern WOMAN trial , large RCT tranexamic acid postpartum hemorrhage . The experimental group receive video strongly emotional content ( interview postpartum hemorrhage survivor husband ) . The control group receive short video researcher conveys information ( without first hand experience survivor husband ) . Otherwise , two videos identical . Participants , select clinician researcher obstetrics gynecology , randomly allocate two group . An e-mail link either videos sent participant . In e-mail , ask watch video forward link colleague find helpful . The primary outcome video forwarding . The secondary outcome number access video participant generate . Data collect 14 day e-mails sent participant . The relative risk ( RR ) forward video calculate effect measure compare use chi-square test . The distribution number access video participant generate compare use Wilcoxon signed-rank test . The hypothesis online video emotional content high chance forward people therefore , get high number view less emotional online video .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>[ Statistical analysis plan DIFFUSION trial ] SETTING Two video upload YouTube new account create study . The uploaded video embed two independent website white background . A computer programme create collect data access video . International journal obstetrics gynaecology publish 2013 2014 seek participant recruitment . The author article publish journal meet inclusion criterion assign ID number randomise receive either intervention control video . Randomised participant send unique web address ( URL ) video allocate e-mail via mass e-mailing service , Campaign Monitor . Each URL link participant 's ID number database . They ask watch video forward colleague find helpful . If randomise participant forward URL another person , person click , click record participant 's ID number computer programme . Therefore , multiple access ID number , either participant watch video participant forward URL people watch video . This trial coordinate London School Hygiene &amp; Tropical Medicine ( University London ) conduct worldwide online . SAMPLE SIZE AND STATISTICAL POWER Two main factor determine number patient need trial . These estimate event rate size treatment effect . The investigator power trial main outcome : percentage participant forward video least arm . ESTIMATED EVENT RATE : Based study , baseline e-mail forward rate assume 10 % . SAMPLE SIZE AND SIZE OF INTERVENTION EFFECT THAT SHOULD BE DETECTABLE : Assuming change baseline 7.5 % ( 75 % increase 10 % 17.5 % ) , sample size require study calculate . The calculation suggest 1000 participant , 500 per group , require test null hypothesis 5 % significance level 90 % power . We learn pilot trial around 14 % e-mail recipient click link watch video . In order get 1000 participant watch video , 7000 participant require give video view rate 14 % . CRITERIA FOR EVALUATION All participant randomly assign one video analyse together , regardless whether watch video , intention treat basis . This analysis examine effect intervention practical scenario . In addition , watch video analyse per-protocol basis estimate efficacy intervention . RANDOMISATION An independent statistician randomly allocate ID number participant either intervention control group use computer programme . Allocation conceal person recruit participant . Randomisations balance 1:1 . BLINDING AND UNBLINDING As two video apparently different , participant blind trial . However , participant send video principle tell receive video less emotional content . The study coordinator conduct data analysis mask allocation . The data unblinded SAP submit ClinicalTrial.gov data analysis complete . The data keep password-secured online archive ( Google drive ) . Access data limit trial coordinator technical assistant develop computer programme data collection . ANALYSIS PRINCIPLES FOR FINAL ANALYSIS - Two different analysis conduct primary outcome intention-to-treat basis per-protocol basis . - All test two-sided , nominal level Î± 5 % main analysis . - All statistical analysis unadjusted except indicate . - Missing value impute unless specify otherwise . Where number miss observation substantial , number observation use analysis report . - P value adjust multiplicity . However , outcomes clearly categorise degree importance ( primary secondary ) . DATA COLLECTION AND OUTCOME ASSESSMENT Every time someone click URL access video computer program collect four variable : ( ) ID number ( b ) IP address URL click , ( c ) date time access ( record Great British Time regardless country IP address ) ( ) type device ( web browser , phone computer device ) Definition access person video : As way detect forwarding , access video unique individual count close indicator forwarding . It also impossible precisely distinguish access unique individual , word , tell video access person different people . Therefore , investigator need make assumption base data collect programme . In main analysis , investigator consider access ID number IP address mean person watch video . Accesses ID number different IP address consider access unique individual . The data variable ( time type device ) consider sensitivity analysis . Multiple access ID IP address within five minute count one access , allow possibility person watch video video play first time parson want confirm information video . CHARACTERISTICS OF PARTICIPANTS AND BASELINE COMPARISONS Description baseline characteristic list presented intervention group . The country participant base categorise low , middle high income country base classification World Bank . Discrete variable summarise frequency percentage . Percentages calculate accord number participant data available . Where value miss , denominator ( less number patient assign treatment group ) state either body footnote correspond summary table . Continuous variable summarise use standard measure central tendency dispersion , i.e . either mean median SD . DESCRIPTION OF ANALYSES The outcome assessor mask identity participant use ID number instead individual name e-mail address . Accesses videos count substitute measure forward . Therefore , even participant forward URL another person , person click link , forward count . This lead underestimate effect intervention . PRIMARY OUTCOME : A standard chi-square test use primary test statistical significance effect intervention allocation proportion video forwarding . Frequencies percentages per arm , risk ratio measure intervention effect 95 % confidence interval ( CI ) also report . SECONDARY OUTCOMES : Distribution number access generate participant compare . The difference mean ( SD ) arm estimate order ass effect intervention along P value . To test statistical difference distribution , Wilcoxon signed-rank test conduct . In case distribution complex , data stratify group chi-square test conduct test statistical difference distribution . After assess distribution , t-test Mood 's median test conduct test statistical difference mean median number access videos participant generate respectively . SENSITIVITY ANALYSES : The effect intervention may vary accord definition access unique person . Therefore , investigator conduct sensitivity analysis outcomes use two different definition access unique person : conservative definition liberal definition . The possible large effect intervention difference outcomes two group estimate use liberal definition forwarding . Likewise , possible small effect intervention difference outcomes two group estimate use conservative definition . With liberal definition , investigator count access different person . With conservative definition , investigator count access different person data category different .</detailed_description>
