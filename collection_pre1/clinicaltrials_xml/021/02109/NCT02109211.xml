	<brief_title>Does Altering Magill Forceps Affect Nasal Intubation Time</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The Magill forceps ( MF ) instrument choice nasal tracheal intubation ( NTI ) . It serve aid insert endotracheal tube tip past vocal cord NTI . NTI prefer oral tracheal intubation ( ETT ) certain instance pediatric dental surgery . This NTI permit excellent access intraoral structure reduce risk inadvertent displacement orotracheal tube . Although literature look MF design alteration reduce complication improve us , literature examine effect design alteration time successful intubate ( TTI ) . Our study premise base concept MF ideally structure pediatric airway anatomy . Knowing larynx considerably anterior pediatric airway , hypothesize + 45Â° angle change 2cm tip MF help align direction instrument carry endotracheal tube anatomic direction airway thus help reduce TTI.. If reduction TTI show would significant benefit could add another tool NTI . Even though , current MF satisfactory use , deter u look opportunity improve current standard . To test hypothesis , include hundred participant part open label , control , single center , randomize study 50 patient intubated conventional MF 50 patient intubate altered MF . We expect result show least 5 second reduction TTI thus statistically significant p value le 0.05 sample size . Our expected conclusion reduce TTI clinically beneficially reduce apnea time pediatric patient , population know physiological limitation respiratory reserve . This , turn , could point reduction intra-operative post-operative respiratory complication .</detailed_description>
