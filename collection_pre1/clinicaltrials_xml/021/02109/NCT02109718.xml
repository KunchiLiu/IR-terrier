	<brief_summary>The Effectiveness open dress petrolatum jelly minor burn clearly establish . This study determine use open dressing petrolatum jelly effective standard gauze dress silver sulfadiazine treat minor burn term time-to-re-epithelialization , incidence wound infection , incidence adverse reaction , patient acceptance . Non-extensive superficial partial thickness burn constitute major proportion burn injury . Conventional treatment involve regular change absorptive dressing include application topical antimicrobial , commonly silver sulfadiazine . A systematic review find insufficient evidence support refute antimicrobial prophylaxis . Another review compare silver sulfadiazine dressing occlusive non-antimicrobial dressing find insufficient evidence guide practice . Other research suggest dressing petrolatum gel effective silver sulfadiazine . This trial seek compare effectiveness conventional silver sulfadiazine dressing treatment petrolatum gel alone .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Trial Comparing Efficacy Safety Open Dressing With Petrolatum Jelly vs. Standard Gauze Dressing With Silver Sulfadiazine</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Patients superficial partial thickness burn less 10 % Total Body Surface Area recruit . Patients burn involve primary area ( face , hand , groin , joint , foot ) , previous treatment burn wound , previous burn injury area , electrical burn , patient inhalation injury exclude Also exclude patient diabetes , know sensitivity allergy one dressing constituent allergy NSAIDS , treat systemic steroid medication , patient AIDS AIDS relate complex . Participants randomize undergo either open dressing petrolatum jelly standard gauze dressing silver sulfadiazine cream . The number day complete re-epithelialization record patient . The incidence wound infection adverse reaction , notably occurrence allergic contact dermatitis also record . The study also assess dressing term adherence wound bed , ease dress removal , pain application removal dressing , time required dressing change number dress change follow-ups.. A total 50 participant recruit . Age , sex , race , health condition , location burn , % Total Body Surface Area area affect , time lag , causative agent , presence initial cool maneuver , medical condition , associate injury similar petrolatum jelly silver sulfadiazine group . There significant difference regard number day re-epithelialization . There also significant difference two treatment group regard pain experienced application removal dressing , number dress change require follow-up . There , however , significant difference open dressing petrolatum jelly silver sulfadiazine gauze dress term adherence wound bed , ease removal dressing time require change dressing . Open dressing petrolatum jelly find less adherent , easy remove , require less time dress change . Single-center , randomize , control clinical trial . Consenting adults 18-45 year old superficial partial thickness burn less equal 10 % total body surface area see within 24 hour injury randomize daily dress either petrolatum gel without top dressing conventional silver sulfadiazine treatment gauze dressing . Primary outcome blind assessment time complete re-epithelialization , wound infection allergic contact dermatitis . Secondary outcome include assessment ease , time pain dressing change . 50 patient recruit follow data available 38 . Mean time re-epithelialization shorter treatment group one day within overall mean healing time 7.0 day ( p = 0.050 ) . No wound infection dermatitis observe either group . Scores adherence wound , ease dress removal time require change dressing significantly good petrolatum treatment arm ( p &lt; 0.01 ) . Petrolatum gel without top dressing may least effective silver sulfadiazine gauze dressing regard time re-epithelialization , incidence infection allergic contact dermatitis . Petrolatum gel appear effective , affordable widely available alternative treatment minor superficial partial thickness burn adult .</detailed_description>
