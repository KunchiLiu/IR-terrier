	<detailed_description>Research Methods Design Experimental Design : This randomize , double-blinded , placebo control , within-subjects counter-measured study design include 100 male athlete variety sport . Females include study hormonal contraceptive use , common among female athlete , time menstrual cycle significant effect caffeine metabolism exercise test performance measure . Controlling factor would require much large pool participant require considerable resource time . However , finding propose research show promising result men would aim replicate finding female athlete . Participants complete 4 visit ( ~90-120 min ) Human Physiology Research Laboratory Goldring Center University Toronto . All test take place Monday Saturday various time . Participants instruct maintain regular diet ( pre-testing meal replicate visit ) sleep habit , avoid strenuous activity 48 hour visit , abstain caffeine one week prior first visit duration data collection ( 4 week ) . Sample Size Calculation Parameters : Effect size = 0.25 : Although large effect size main treatment effect find previous research ( 0.38 ) , decide conservative , trial would power detect small-medium effect size still physiological importance . Additionally , interested effect two dos caffeine assume small main treatment effect . Therefore , small-medium effect size need ensure sufficient statistical power make between-caffeine-effect conclusion time trial analysis . Finally , parameter assessment Vertical Jump power likely small effect size time-trial report Tucker et al . ( 2013 ) study vertical jump performance male basketball player . Therefore , small effect size would require adequately power study outcome measure ( i.e . power , strength anaerobic , aerobic etc . ) - Alpha ( error probability ) = 0.025 : In general , alpha = 0.05 standard value use parameter . However , study participant enrol number independent trial , therefore decide use lower alpha take account error arise multiple comparison sport ( power endurance ) plus genotype ( risk common variant ) . - Power ( 1-Beta probability ) = 0.8 : The conventional value 0.8 used power . - Number group = 2 : Number stratification require genotype subgroup analysis - Number measurement = 4 : The laboratory exercise test - Correlation among repeat measure = 0 : Zero correlation measurement assume . - Sample Size = 74 : Based calculation 74 participant require . We recruit 100 athlete order account possible withdrawal 25 % , without potentially compromise statistical significance result . In addition , choose use multiple comparison ( genotype + sport ) would benefit large sample minimize drop effect size . Recruitment Recruitment carry University Toronto , Ryerson York University campuses , Canadian Sport Institute Ontario , local running/triathlon club flyer post appropriate location . A standardized email study contact information also send head coach and/or program director sport teams/clubs ( location list ) eligible athlete , choose make athlete aware study . Parameters Assessment Physiological data collect two trained kinesiologists , PhD level exercise physiologist , one student assistant Nanci Guest , graduate student . Anthropometric Clinical Characteristics - Resting systolic ( SBP ) diastolic ( DBP ) blood pressure measurement , well pulse rate , take twice , one minute apart . The mean two consecutive reading take . - Heart rate measure test ensure participant calmness similar physiological state test test day . - Heart rate monitor throughout duration trial ( Visit 2-4 ) Polar Heart Rate Monitors ( Polar Electro , Finland ) - Height measure near 0.1 cm use wall-mounted stadiometer body weight measure near 0.1 kg use digital scale participant wear light clothing without shoe . - Body weight value use determine 2 4 mg per kilogram body mass dosages caffeine treatment ( plus placebo dose ) ingest random order ( derive research assistant blind investigator ) visit 2 , 3 4 , follow three week . - Body Composition assess bioimpedence scale ( BC-558 Ironman Segmental Body Composition Monitor ) Exercise Tests Descriptive Characteristics Maximal Aerobic Capacity assess VO2 max test cycle ergometer . This test part descriptive data use determine resistance set time trial test ( 65 % peak power ) . Participants undergo grade exercise test Monark cycle ergometer ( Groningen , The Netherlands ) volitional fatigue . To determine maximal oxygen consumption ( VO2Max ) , air sample analyze oxygen carbon dioxide concentration via indirect open circuit spirometry system ( Parvomedics , Metabolic Cart , Sandy , Utah ) . Subjects set Polar Heart Rate monitor . Four main outcome measure ( power , strength , anaerobic aerobic capacity ) - Muscular Power assess use Vertical Jump Test ( VJT ) describe previously ( 5 ) . Participants complete two attempt two vertical jump test force plate ( AMTI , Watertown , MA , USA ) . 1. squat jump ( SJ ) : squatting position ( knee angle : 90Â° approximately ) preliminary counter movement perform ; 2. counter-movement jump ( CMJ ) : upright stand position preliminary counter movement ; There 30 second rest period jump best score two record . - Strength ( upper body ) assess use Handgrip Dynamometer ( Lafayette Instrument Company model 78010 ) . The high score 3 trial record ( kg ) . - Anaerobic Capacity assess use Wingate Anaerobic Test cycle ergometer ( Ergomedic 849E , Monark , Sweden ) . Participants cycle fix resistance 0.085kg / kg body mass . Three main measure record test : - Peak power ( PP ) : measure maximal anaerobic power , maximum power output reach 5-second period first 10 second test . PP record Watts ( W ) W/kg . - Mean power ( MP ) : measure anaerobic capacity , mean power output achieve 30-second test . MP record W W/kg . - Fatigue Index ( FI ) : measure rate power decrease , difference high 5-second power output low 5-second power output , divide elapsed time . FI record percentage . - Endurance/Aerobic Capacity power output assess Cycling Time Trial ( TT ) . Participants instruct complete 10 km TT , carry cycle ergometer ( Monarch Sports Medical , Vansbro , Sweden ) , quickly possible temporal , verbal , physiological feedback.Time require complete test average power output record completion test . Additional Tests Exercise Testing - Blood Lactate Testing . Immediately Wingate test participant finger prick disposable lancet puncture skin obtain capillary blood sample analysis Lactate Pro analyzer ( LT-1710 , Arkray Inc , Kyoto , Japan ) - Rating Perceived Exertion ( RPE ) - The Borg scale RPE use assess subject ' perception fatigue . Genotyping Saliva sample collect Visit 1 exercise test use Oragene-500 kit DNA isolation use standard procedure describe previously.We conduct genome-wide association study , approach involve scan marker across genome study participant together , individual , find genetic variation associate particular trait VO2 max , lactate clearance efficiency , muscle fiber type change exercise performance follow caffeine . We also examine know genetic variation associate caffeine metabolism response , determine gene also affect response exercise subject ingest caffeine . Dietary Intake Assessment Subjects complete 196-item semi-quantitative food frequency questionnaire determine habitual caffeine intake well dietary factor . Dietary intake information use identify potential effect modifier usual caffeine consumption . Health , Lifestyle Physical Activity Assessment The General health , lifestyle physical activity questionnaire ( GHLPA ) include detailed question caffeine ( e.g . intake habit , withdrawal effect etc ) , previously use lab , combine validate habitual physical activity/sport history questionnaire previously use assess sport/physical activity athlete . Statistical Analysis Analyses carry use SAS ( Version 9.2 , NC , USA , 2009 ) statistical software . Briefly , report descriptive data ( height , weight , age , blood pressure , caffeine intake habit , body fat % , VO2max , year sport , train hour per week , dietary assessment data lifestyle measure ) comparison genotype group use independent t-tests . Potential difference VO2max , 10 km time trial , anaerobic capacity , lactate threshold , power strength rate perceive exertion assess use repeat measure analysis variance ( RMANOVA ) treatment within participant factor genotype between-participants factor . For RMANOVA procedure , posthoc test perform use independent dependent t-tests Bonferroni correction P &lt; 0.05 required threshold significance . Experimental Procedure Initial Screening - phone call in-person visit Potential participant verify sport participation ability commit four 2-hour visit lab 7 day apart . Participants remind importance maintain regular diet . The importance require caffeine abstinence , include caffeine-containing supplement 7 day prior first visit duration study ( 4 week ) emphasize reiterate . Visit 1 ( ~90 min ) The first visit laboratory involve familiarization , obtain write informed consent participant explanation aim , benefit , risk involve study . Participants inform free withdraw study time . Each subject complete `` exercise readiness '' questionnaire ( PAR-Q ; Physical Activity Readiness Questionnaire ) descriptive anthropometric data collect , include date birth , height , body mass , blood pressure , also provide saliva sample DNA isolation genotyping . During first visit , maximal oxygen uptake ( VO2 max ; describe ) also measure descriptive baseline data , derive workload level experimental time trial subsequent test visit . Visit 2 , 3 4 ( ~120 min ) All three visit identical exception 20 min wait period ( 10 min pre-testing warm-up begin ) serum concentration caffeine level reach peak level , participant complete different questionnaire sit quietly activity . Upon arrival participant randomly assign ( maintain blinding ) ingest either supplement 2 4 mg caffeine per kg body weight , dextrose placebo ( PLAC ) . Each participant ingest number capsule identical color size visit , whether 0 , 2 4 mg/kg , order maintain double-blinding treatment . Each subject complete questionnaire sit quietly ( e.g . reading , use e-devices etc . ) wait first exercise test . Exercise test protocol identical visit 2 , 3 4 . After 20 min , participant warm-up 10 min carry 4 exercise test ( commence 30 min post-caffeine ingestion ) determine different measure performance : . Muscle power - Vertical Jump Test ii . Strength - Handgrip Dynamometer iii . Anaerobic Capacity - Wingate iv .
