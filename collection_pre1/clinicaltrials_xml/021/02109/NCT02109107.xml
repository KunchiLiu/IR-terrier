	<brief_title>Study Low Level Laser Light Therapy Circumference Reduction</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The American Society Plastic Surgeons ( ASPS ) 2011 report state market cosmetic procedure show significant growth past two year , 13.8 million cosmetic plastic surgery procedure perform United States 2011 , 5 % since 2010 . While surgical cosmetic procedure significantly increase 2010 2011 , overall growth cosmetic procedure primarily drive substantial rise minimally-invasive procedure , increase 6 % , nearly 12.2 million cosmetic minimally-invasive procedure perform 2011 . This highlight grow consumer demand non- minimally-invasive cosmetic procedure involve surgical procedure liposuction associate risk , potential complication lengthy painful recovery process . Low level laser light therapy offer simple , non-invasive , safe , effective side-effect free alternative achieve body circumference reduction . Justification assertion anticipate safety effectiveness application Erchonia® EZ6 Laser low level laser therapy reduction body circumference find three Food Drug Administration ( FDA ) clearances Erchonia® Low Level Laser device body circumference reduction indication , follow : K123237 ( 532 nanometer ( nm ) green light diode ) : Erchonia® Zerona™ 2.0 Laser : indicate use non-invasive dermatological aesthetic treatment adjunct individual intend undergo liposuction procedure reduction circumference hip , waist , thigh . K121695 &amp; K082609 ( 635 nm red light diode ) : Erchonia® ML Scanner ( MLS ) &amp; Erchonia® Zerona : indicate use non-invasive dermatological aesthetic treatment adjunct individual intend undergo liposuction procedure reduction circumference hip , waist , thigh . K121690 &amp; K120257 ( 635 nm red light diode ) : Erchonia® MLS , Zerona : indicate use non-invasive dermatological aesthetic treatment adjunct individual intend undergo liposuction procedure reduction circumference upper arm . Therefore , Erchonia low level laser determine safe effective FDA application body circumference reduction indication multiple body area . The intended application/indication EZ6 study comparable FDA-cleared indication , study intent evaluate comparative efficacy six week , weekly 60 minute treatment administration protocol employ 6 red light diode establish efficacy current two week , thrice weekly 40 minute treatment administration protocol application five red light diode reduction hip , waist , thighs upper abdomen circumference .</detailed_description>
