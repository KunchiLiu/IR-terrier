	<brief_title>Low-Dose Total Lymphoid Irradiation Treating Patients With Refractory Chronic Graft-versus-Host Disease After Donor Stem Cell Transplant</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To determine safety total lymphoid irradiation ( TLI ) cohorts select population refractory chronic graft-versus-host disease ( GvHD ) patient , give cohort total cumulative dos TLI 100 , 150 , 200 , 250 300 centigray ( cGy ) . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . To evaluate efficacy ( failure free survival [ FFS ] 6 month ) therapy study population . II . Approximate efficacy different dose level use GvHD summary score . TERTIARY OBJECTIVES : I . Determine effect therapy relevant subpopulation immune cell attempt elucidate mechanism action . OUTLINE : This dose-escalation study . Patients undergo LD-TLI daily 1-2 day . After completion study treatment , patient follow day 45 , 3 6 month , 1 year , every 6 month thereafter .</detailed_description>
