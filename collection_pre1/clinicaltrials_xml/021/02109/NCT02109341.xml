	<brief_summary>At moment , FOLFIRINOX best treatment select patient ( pt ) metastatic pancreatic cancer ( mPC ) . Investigator would like evaluate substitution CPT11 Oxaliplatin FOLFIRINOX schedule Nab-paclitaxel ( Nab-p ) [ Nab-FOLFIRI Nab-FOLFOX ] . Doses Nab-FOLFIRI Nab-FOLFOX determine phase I trial . One schedule evaluate successive phase II part .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Phase I/II Study Evaluate Nab-paclitaxel Substitution CPT11 Oxaliplatin FOLFIRINOX Schedule First Line Treatment Metastatic Pancreatic Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The primary objective phase I study determine MTD Nab-p use substitution OXA CPT11 FOLFIRINOX schedule , first-line treatment pt mPC . The dose finding strategy base classical 3+3 dose escalation design . -Analysis set : Modified intention-to-treat population : consist pt allocate receive least one dose component study treatment . Pts group accord randomize treatment assignment . Pts treat phase I step included population . Safety population : consist pt allocate receive least one dose component study treatment . Groups define study treatment actually receive . Pts treat MTD phase I step included population . Statistical method Best ORR summarize 95 % confidence limit calculate accord exact method treatment arm include phase II step . All analysis primary secondary efficacy variable perform modified intention-to-treat population . The overall incidence AEs summarize . Pts experience event one occasion count calculation event frequency , high intensity ever observe . Serious adverse event summarize . All safety analysis perform safety population . -Sample size : The experimental treatment , consider clinically worthwhile , determine overall best RR equal great 40 % . According Fleming single stage design , 90 % power towards alternative hypothesis ORR equal great 40 % one-sided type I error rate 5 % , respect null hypothesis ORR equal less 20 % , 42 pt must include final evaluation , arm phase II step . According exact binomial test , experimental treatment consider sufficiently promise candidate study case major objective response see least 14 pt .</detailed_description>
