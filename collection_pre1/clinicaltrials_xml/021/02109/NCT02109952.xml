	<brief_summary>The purpose study monitor fracture risk associate bone tumor cancer patient . Previous study lab suggest possible compute mechanical strength bone tumor use compute tomography ( CT ) scan , like three-dimensional X-ray picture affect bone . The next step determine usefulness type strength analysis see accurately predict risk bone fracture patient high risk fracture . This non-invasive analysis may help physician determine best treatment reduce risk impend bone fracture future .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>If patient agrees participate study , ask patient complete two write , self-administered questionnaire . The questionnaire take fifteen minute complete contain question patient 's general health well question specific site bone tumor . The patient ask complete first questionnaire upon enrollment study , second participation study conclude . The patient ask complete return questionnaire project coordinator time . If reason patient unable complete questionnaire time , he/she ask return project coordinator within two week use stamp , pre-addressed envelope , provide . The treat physician order X-ray picture three-dimensional CT scan image involve bone plus contralateral limb ( low limb ) . He/she provide standard report radiologist describe appearance bone tumor bone treat physician use determine course treatment he/she deem appropriate . We perform special analysis CT image allow u estimate strength bone tumor . Based engineering analysis strength bone , treat physician may alter prescribed treatment decrease risk bone fracture . If patient fracture within follow-up period ( four month ) , he/she undergo second CT scan determine response tumor treatment change strength bone . If patient fracture within follow-up period , he/she undergo second CT scan determine integrity remain bone help physician plan next course action . We use second CT scan estimate weak bone prior fracture . In either case , patient 's participation study conclude second CT scan . Patient participation study last four month . If patient fracture four month , his/her participation end time . The investigator and/or treat physician may decide take patient study 1. patient refuse unable complete study procedure ; 2. patient develop weakness numbness his/her limb due disease ; 3. patient 's bone fracture due significant trauma ( e.g. , traffic accident , fall height ) ; 4. different bone fracture , limit patient 's ability put pressure bone interest ; 5. patient relocate . The patient end his/her participation time . The patient 's decision withdraw study affect way his/her medical care and/or benefit . If patient decides end his/her participation study , encourage him/her discus decision treat physician . STUDY LOCATION Privacy Patients approach treat physician clinic privately ( examination room ) , privately describe study , answer question patient might potentially enroll patient study . Patient privacy confidentiality strictly observe step recruitment , report data follow conversation . Physical Setting All patient related activity conduct hospital patient undergoes treatment . CT data analysis perform Center advance Orthopaedic Studies BIDMC . DATA SECURITY All data keep behind BIDMC firewall access control computer designate study . Additionally , patient data anonymized number assign protect patient identity , therefore conduct analysis CT data access patient identifiable information .</detailed_description>
