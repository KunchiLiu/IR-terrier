	<brief_title>Analysis Tumor Tissue Circulating Genetic Material Blood Obtain Further Insight Effectiveness Everolimus When Combined With Exemestane</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Rationale study : Everolimus combine exemestane show improve progression-free survival compare exemestane monotherapy patient hormone receptor-positive breast cancer previously treat non-steroidal aromatase inhibitor . Since January 1st , 2013 , everolimus reimburse category patient . For many patient mean , interest treatment possibility become available . However , patient benefit everolimus exemestane , others deal side-effects require adjustment dose even discontinuation treatment . In study proposal investigator plan gain insight tumor characteristic order predict patient high chance long progression-free survival . Study objectives : 1 . It propose compare progression-free survival combination everolimus exemestane patient whose metastatic tumor express marker phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase ( PI3K ) pathway activation versus patient whose metastatic tumor express PI3K pathway activation . 2 . It propose carry immunohistochemistry activate member PI3K pathway primary tumor tissue patient treat everolimus exemestane compare find outcome treatment specifically , result study . 3 . It propose associate protein expression/ phosphorylation proteomics tumor biopsy cancer mutation , PI3K pathway activation progression-free survival exemestane everolimus combination . 4 . It propose establish incidence mutation phosphatidylinositol-4,5-bisphosphate 3-kinase , catalytic subunit alpha ( PIK3CA ) protein kinase B ( AKT ) peripheral blood advance breast cancer patient amenable treatment everolimus exemestane explore whether presence mutation associate outcome treatment patient . Study population : Postmenopausal woman hormone receptor-positive locally advanced metastatic breast cancer whose disease refractory non steroidal aromatase inhibitor ( NSAIs ) document recurrence progression last therapy breast cancer . Number patient center : - 175 patient blood sample archive tumor tissue , 50 fresh tumor biopsy , another 30 fresh tumor biopsy upon progressive disease - 30 hospital Netherlands . Treatment phase : Patients treat 10 mg daily dos everolimus ( either 2 x 5 mg 1 x 10 mg tablet ) combination exemestane ( 25 mg daily tablet ) . Dose adjustment ( reduction , interruption ) accord safety finding allow . Treatment continue one follow condition apply whichever come first : tumor progression , unacceptable toxicity accord investigator 's judgment , patient 's wish , death , discontinuation study reason . Further treatment progression investigator 's discretion . Physicians collect data demographic , previous treatment , efficacy everolimus exemestane well toxic effect combination accord good clinical practice ( GCP ) patient 's file . Statistical consideration : Since majority study involve use new technique , study mainly explorative design . For blood sample analysis analysis archival tumor tissue least 175 patient require . For tumor tissue biopsy number 50 patient expect give insight difference patient clinical benefit ant early progressive disease ; 30 patient tumor biopsy collect upon progressive disease .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>1 . Adult woman ( ≥ 18 year age ) metastatic locally advanced breast cancer amenable curative treatment surgery radiotherapy . 2 . Histological cytological confirmation estrogenreceptor positive ( ER+ ) breast cancer 3 . Postmenopausal woman . Postmenopausal status define either : Age ≥ 55 year one year amenorrhea Age &lt; 55 year one year amenorrhea , estradiol assay &lt; 40 pg/ml Surgical menopause bilateral oophorectomy 4 . Disease refractory NSAI , define : . Recurrence within 12 month end adjuvant treatment letrozole anastrozole , b . Progression within one month end letrozole anastrozole treatment advance breast cancer ( locally advance metastatic ) Note : Letrozole anastrozole last treatment prior enrollment . Other prior anticancer therapy , e.g . tamoxifen , fulvestrant allow . Patients must recover grade 1 good adverse event ( except alopecia ) relate previous therapy prior enrollment . Radiological clinical evidence recurrence progression last systemic therapy prior enrollment . Note : There restriction last systemic therapy prior enrollment . 5 . Adequate bone marrow coagulation function show : Absolute neutrophil count ( ANC ) ≥ 1.5 ×109/L Platelets ≥ 100 ×109/L Hemoglobin ( Hgb ) ≥ 5.6 mmol/L INR ( international normalize ratio ) ≤ 2.0 6 . Adequate liver function show : Serum aspartate aminotransferase ( AST ) alanine aminotransferase ( ALT ) ≤ 2.5 ULN ( upper limit normal ) ( ≤ 5 hepatic metastasis present ) Total serum bilirubin ≤ 1.5 × ULN ( ≤ 3 × ULN patient know Gilbert Syndrome ) 7 . Adequate renal function show : Serum creatinine ≤ 1.5 × ULN 8 . Fasting serum cholesterol ≤ 7.75 mmol/L fast triglyceride ≤ 2.5 × ULN . In case one threshold exceed , patient include initiation statin therapy lipid lower drug ( eg fibrates ) , mention value achieve 9 . Written inform consent obtain screening procedure accord local guideline . 1 . HER2overexpressing patient local laboratory testing ( IHC 3+ stain situ hybridization positive ) . 2 . Previous treatment mTOR ( mammalian target rapamycin ) inhibitor . 3 . Radiotherapy within four week prior enrollment except case localize radiotherapy analgesic purpose lytic lesion risk fracture complete within two week prior enrollment . Patients must recover radiotherapy toxicity prior enrollment . 4 . Currently receive hormone replacement therapy , unless discontinue prior enrollment . 5 . Patients receive concomitant immunosuppressive agent chronic corticosteroid use , time study entry except case outline : 6 . Topical application ( e.g . rash ) , inhale spray ( e.g . obstructive airway disease ) , eye drop local injection ( e.g . intraarticular ) allow . 7 . Patients stable low dose corticosteroid least two week enrollment allow case treatment brain metastasis . 8 . Bilateral diffuse lymphangitic carcinomatosis metastasis lung manifestation disease ( &gt; 50 % lung involvement ) , evidence metastasis estimate third liver define sonogram and/or CT scan . 9 . Patients known history HIV seropositivity . 10 . Active , bleed diathesis , oral antivitamin K medication ( except low dose warfarin acetylsalicylic acid equivalent , long INR ≤ 2.0 ) 11 . Any severe / uncontrolled medical condition : Unstable angina pectoris , symptomatic congestive heart failure , myocardial infarction ≤6 month prior enrollment , serious uncontrolled cardiac arrhythmia Uncontrolled diabetes define fast serum glucose &gt; 1.5 × ULN Acute chronic , active infectious disorder ( except hepatitis B C positive patient ) nonmalignant medical illness uncontrolled whose control may jeopardize complication study therapy Impairment gastrointestinal function gastrointestinal disease may significantly alter absorption study drug ( e.g. , ulcerative disease , uncontrolled nausea , vomit , diarrhea , malabsorption syndrome ) Significant symptomatic deterioration lung function . If clinically indicate , pulmonary function test include measure predict lung volume , DLco ( diffuse capacity lung carbon monoxide ) , O2 saturation rest room air consider exclude restrictive pulmonary disease , pneumonitis pulmonary infiltrates . 12 . Patients test positive hepatitis B ( HBV ) C ( HBC ) ( patient test negative HBVDNA , HBsAg , HBcAb , positive HBsAb prior history vaccination Hepatitis B eligible see also 1.4 ) 13 .
