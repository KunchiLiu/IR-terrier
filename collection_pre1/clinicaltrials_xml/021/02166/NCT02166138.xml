	<brief_title>Non-Ablative Fractional Resurfacing Total Knee Replacement Scars</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Patients undergoing unilateral , primary total knee replacement enrol study treat surgeon 's office time surgery indicate schedule . Patient 's ask enroll study indicate treat surgeon primary total knee replacement , 18 year age old , , history wound heal problem , chronic infection connective tissue disorder Fitzpatrick skin type I VI . Patients exclude study : prior history surgery indicate knee ; mental psychological illness prohibits consent complete necessary form ; refuse consent study ; , history wound heal problem , diagnose skin connective tissue disease . Standard baseline health information demographic collect time enrollment ( gender , age , co-morbidities , etc. ) . On day surgery , patient randomize surgical incision treat non-ablative fractional laser treat placebo laser . Randomization computer-generated store opaque seal envelope . For patient , randomization take place prior surgery hold area day surgery . At discharge , laser technician open seal envelope reveal allocation control experimental group . The technician treat patient appropriately per protocol . Proper randomization ensure technician , principal investigator co-investigators . The patient , principal investigator co-investigators collect data blind randomization . The technician provide laser therapy blind . The incisional length determine treat surgeon time surgery base deems adequate give patient 's body habitus technical demand surgery . The skin incision always make new , sharp , sterile 10 blade . Subcutaneous dissection do scalpel well . Closure wound do 0-vicryl suture arthrotomy deep subcutaneous tissue . The suture tie interrupted simple pattern . The superficial subcutaneous tissue layer close interrupt buried 2.0-vicryl suture . The skin close 4.0 monocryl run subcuticular stitch . The wound dress sterile dress come post operative day two . After primary dressing take , wound leave open air unless active drainage . If active drainage present , sterile gauze keep wound dry . As dry wound pre-requisite patient discharge , patient discharge drain wound . On day discharge , patient first non-ablative , fractional laser treatment do hospital . This perform registered technician train use non-ablative , fractional laser . The technician trained company provide device complete hospital 's require laser training prior use device patient . The laser setting preset 15 mjs 50 mj . The number pass use per patient 5 pass , determine plastic surgeon include study individualize patient 's Fitzpatrick skin type . The technician know status patient 's randomization either treat patient laser turn laser apply standard fashion without activate device . The technician also apply Lidocaine patch order numb area treat laser device keep patient blind treatment . The patient ask wear opaque glass prevent see technician use laser remain blind treatment . Additionally , ask wear noise-cancelling headphone minimize sound active laser make . On day discharge patient first non-ablative , fractional laser treatment perform hospital register technician trained use non-ablative fractional laser . The patient give strict instruction standardize wound care regimen . They complete standard post TKR rehabilitative course . At 4-week 8-week time point patient return clinic wind check 2nd 3rd laser therapy treatment . The patient see surgeon 4-week follow visit , standard care . At week 8 , non-Standard Care visit , treat surgeon 's nurse laser technician see patient . If patient , nurse technician concern status wound , Principle Investigator notify . Patients charge 8-week visit . At 4 week , 8 week , 3 month 1 year visit surgical scar photograph standardize , control fashion . Dr. Rothaus , plastic surgeon , extensive experience standardize cosmetic photography provide expertise . Briefly , camera , lens , light position use patient time point . The goal variable appearance scar . At visit , patient complete validate scar assessment outcomes tool , Patient Observer Scar Assessment Scale ( POSAS ) . ( 22 ) Additionally , one three expert ( Dr. Rothaus , Ms. Trezza , Dr. Cornell ) train scar assessment inspect patient 's scar complete observer portion scar assessment instrument . In addition POSAS , patient also complete valid knee outcome instrument , Knee Injury Osteoarthritis Outcome Score ( KOOS ) ( 23 ) visit . The data collect physician 's private office prior schedule surgery surgery visit . An identified co-investigator , appropriate HIPAA human subject research training responsible administer knee instrument , answer patient 's question , collect instrument complete . This ensure surgeon access patient 's response . The primary outcome difference POSAS score patient treat laser treated placebo . Secondary outcome include difference POSAS observer score well difference KOOS score experimental control group . While investigator group first use technology Total Knee Replacement scar , Vasily et al . 2009 report effectiveness laser treatment post-surgical traumatic scar find relative baseline , 73 % scar improve 50 % , 43 % improve 75 % . Overall , treated scar demonstrate clinical improvement mean overall improvement 52 % . Side effect minimal include swell ( 95 % ) , erythema ( 94 % ) purpura ( 5 % ) . ( 9 ) All side effect completely resolve one-month follow-up visit . Additionaly , investigator pilot study demonstrate laser treatment safe , investigator apply treatment ten patient , manor mention , see complication thus far . On basis data pilot study , treatment non-ablative fractional laser deem safe effective .</detailed_description>
	<criteria>Patients include : They indicate primary total knee replacement Have history wound heal problem , chronic infection , know skin connective tissue disease . Are 18 year age old Have skin type classify Fitzpatrick type IVI . Patients exclude follow reason : Any prior history surgery knee Mental psychological illness prohibits patient complete necessary form</criteria>
