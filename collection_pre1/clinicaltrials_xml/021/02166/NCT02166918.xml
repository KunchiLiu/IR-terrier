The recruitment assessment subject complete within first semester third year . The analysis data collect complete second semester third year . PROCEDURES AND ASSESSMENT TOOLS In subject blood sample 20 ml withdrawn peripheral vein genetic analysis . 1 . Evaluation aspect related disease . For patient clinical form fill data age type disease onset , course disease treatment . All available source information ( patient , family , medical record mental health worker ) use complete form . The Premorbid Adjustment Scale ( PAS ) use assess premorbid adjustment . It evaluate achieve level function onset schizophrenia four area ( social accessibility/isolation , peer relationship , ability function outside nuclear family , capacity form intimate social - sexual tie ) 4 period subject 's life ( childhood ; early adolescence ; late adolescence ; adulthood ) , well high achieve global level functioning . It comprise 26 item score range 0 ( healthy end adjustment range ) 6 ( indicate least healthy end ) . General psychopathology positive symptom evaluate use Positive Negative Syndrome Scale ( PANSS ) . Negative symptom assess use Brief Negative Symptom Scale ( BNSS ) . This scale include 13 item assess 5 domain negative symptom : anhedonia , asociality , avolition , blunt affect alogia , well control item , include negative domain , `` Distress '' . For item 5 domain high score associate great impairment/presence symptom , item Distress high score associate reduction absence negative emotion . Depressive symptom investigate use Calgary Depression Rating Scale ( CDRS ) , rating scale design assess level depression people schizophrenia . It include 9 item ( depression ; hopelessness ; self depreciation ; guilty idea reference ; pathological guilt ; morning depression ; early wakening ; suicide ; observe depression ) score range 0 ( absent ) 3 ( severe ) . The possible presence extrapyramidal symptom , whose assessment require exclude observed negative symptom secondary , verified mean St. Hans Rating Scale ( SHRS ) , multidimensional rating scale comprise four subscales : hyperkinesias , parkinsonism , akathisia dystonia . Each subscale include one item score range 0 ( absent ) 6 ( severe ) . Neurocognitive function evaluate mean Measurement Treatment Research Improve Cognition Schizophrenia ( MATRICS ) Consensus Cognitive Battery ( MCCB ) . The battery include test assessment seven distinct cognitive domain : ) process speed , b ) attention/vigilance , c ) work memory , ) verbal learning , e ) visual learning , f ) social cognition g ) reasoning problem solve . The assessment social cognition , partly include MCCB , complete use Facial Emotion Identification Test theory mind test The Awareness Social Inference Test ( TASIT ) . In Facial Emotion Identification Test ( FEIT ) , 55 face present screen ; subject choose facial emotion express face among 7 possibility ( anger , disgust , neutral , happiness , surprise , fear , sadness ) . The TASIT include three section : 1 ) Emotion Evaluation Test , examine ability recognize basic emotion show people , 28 vignette present subject choose emotion express target actor multiple-choice array ( surprise , happiness , anger , sadness , anxiety , disgust , neutral ) ; 2 ) Test Social Inference ( Minimal ) , evaluate ability perceive social inference , specifically involve use sarcasm ; 15 vignette present subject answer , vignette , four question regard , respectively , one actor `` '' , he/she try `` say '' , he/she `` think '' he/she `` feeling '' ; 3 ) Test Social Inference ( Enriched ) , evaluate ability perceive social inference involve lie use sarcasm ; 16 vignette presented question second section ask . 2 . Assessment personal resource The evaluation physical health status carry application standardize protocol develop unit N. 5 Naples . The assessment coping style make mean Coping Orientation Problems Experienced inventory - Brief , include 28 item , divide 14 scale : positive reframing , self-distraction , expression , use instrumental support , active coping , denial , religion , humor , behavioral disengagement , use emotional support , substance use , acceptance , planning , self-blame . The tool aim capture wide range cop strategy real life situation . The evaluation self-esteem carry use Self-Esteem Rating Scale ( SERS ) , assess different aspect self-esteem , feel socially self-competent , worth respect , feel intelligent able solve problem . SERS compose 40 item , rating 7-point Likert scale . The recovery style evaluate use Recovery Style Questionnaire . This self-administered instrument consist 39 item refer construct continuity , ownership , responsibility , curiosity , education , help-seeking , blame , cause , optimism , impact , fear , like satisfaction . For person categorize sealer integrator . Resilience evaluate Resilience Scale Adults ( RSA ) . The RSA scale provide multidimensional assessment resilience general characteristic . It include 33 item examine intra-and inter-personal protective factor think facilitate adaptation face psychosocial adversity . Factor analysis show six factor : ) personal competence , b ) positive perception future , c ) social competence , ) , personal structure , ) family cohesion , f ) social resource . The relationship mental health service evaluate Service Engagement Scale ( SES ) , include 16 item group 4 subscales : ) availability , b ) cooperation c ) help seek ) adherence treatment . The person give score 4-point Likert scale . c ) Evaluation factor related context . For evaluation subject 's family social - economic status Social Economic Status use . The SES base : ) education b ) type work . The educational level measure 7-level scale ( 1=elementary school , 7=post-degree/specialization course ) type work rat 9-level scale ( 1=laborer , 9=high level managerial position ) . To calculate index education level type work parent weight . The amount social policy expenditure unemployment rate geographical macro-area ( Northeast , Northwest , Central , South Islands ) take late Italian National Institute Statistic ( ISTAT ) table . The availability disability pension , access family social incentive investigate social - demographic questionnaire develop ad hoc data sex , age , marital status , schooling , housing , luxuries habit also collect .

Each item rat scale 1 `` never '' 4 `` always '' . The evaluation stigma associate mental illness carry use two instrument : Internalized Stigma Mental Illness ( ISMI ) , administer patient evaluate experience stigma internalize self-rejection , Perceived Devaluation Discrimination Scale ( PDD ) , measure perceive stigma , i.e. , attitudes general population respect mental disorder , administer subject . The ISMI scale include 29 item 5 subscales self-assessment subjective experience stigma . Each item rat 4-level Likert scale , high score indicate great level internalize stigma . The PDD include 12 item , rat 5-level Likert scale , high score indicate great stigma . ) Assessment functional capacity real-life function The functional capacity evaluate use short version Performance-based Skills Assessment , University California , San Diego ( UCSD ) , performance-based instrument investigate two area : Financial Skills ( count money , count change pay bill ) Communication Skills ( dial telephone number emergency , information , dial telephone number memory ; reschedule appointment telephone ; understand remember instruction Medical Doctor Appointment Letter ) . Individual real-life functioning assess Specific Level Function Scale ( SLOF ) , hybrid instrument explore many aspect function base judgment caregiver/operator ( direct observation ) behavior function patient . It consist 43 item include follow domain : ) physical efficiency ; b ) skills self-care ; c ) interpersonal relationship ; ) social acceptability ; e ) community activity ( e.g. , shopping , use public transportation ) ; f ) work ability . The scale assess `` Personal Social Functioning '' ( PSF ) also use ; evaluate area self-care , socially useful activity , personal social relationship disturb aggressive behavior . GENETIC ASSOCIATION ANALYSES WITH THE PHENOTYPES OF INTEREST The Naples research unit n. 6 perform association study select putative schizophrenia gene specific psychometric , neurophysiological neurocognitive schizophrenia endophenotypes ; moreover , research unit search de novo copy-number variation ( CNV ) putative risk factor schizophrenia schizophrenia endophenotypes de novo protein-altering mutation may contribute genetic component schizophrenia endophenotypes . STATISTICAL ANALYSIS OF DATA To identify factor affect real-life functioning people diagnose schizophrenia multiple regression statistical model use . Real-life functioning functional capacity index define dependent variable . The three block variable , i.e . disease-related variable , personal resource context-related variable , independent variable predictor . structural equation model ( SEM ) , accord author robust problem multicollinearity occur regression model linear correlation among independent variable , use . This analysis allow draw assumption causality variable , base path analysis identify potential factor mediate moderate relationship dependent independent variable . The explored model subsequently test confirmatory analysis . Estimated sample size analysis least 5 independent observation index model . Therefore , include model : 3 demographic index ( age , sex education ) , 15 variable related disease ( PANSS-general PANSS-positive subscale score , 2 negative symptom domain derive BNSS , 6 cognitive domain MCCB , 4 index social cognition , derive specific section MCCB , TASIT FEIT , total score depression Calgary scale ) , 36 index related personal resource ( 6 factor Resilience , 14 Coping factor , 13 Recovery style factor , 1 score Self-Esteem , 1 index relationship mental health service , 1 physical health index ) 10 relate context ( 1 index economic status , 5 index financial opportunity work/family social incentive , 2 stigma index , 2 social network factor ) , total 64 index , estimate appropriate sample patient 64x5=320 subject . The effect dichotomous variable ( eg , gender ) ordinal ( eg , social class ) assess one- multiple-way analysis variance . The analysis conduct use Statistical Package Social Science ( SPSS ) .</detailed_description>
