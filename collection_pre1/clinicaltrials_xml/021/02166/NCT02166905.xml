	<brief_summary>This partially randomized phase I/IIb trial study side effect best dose IDO1 inhibitor INCB024360 combination DEC-205/NY-ESO-1 fusion protein CDX-1401 poly ICLC see well work treat patient ovarian , fallopian tube , primary peritoneal cancer long evidence disease . Antigens ( cancer/testis antigen [ NY-ESO-1 ] protein ) find many cancer cell . Vaccines make NY-ESO-1 protein may cause immune system produce immune cell antibody may help locate NY-ESO-1 and/or cancer/testis antigen 2 ( LAGE-1 ) antigens cancer cell . By find , immune system may work control eliminate remain cancer cell . INCB024360 inhibitor enzyme call indoleamine 2,3 dioxygenase ( IDO ) . This enzyme produce tumor cell disable immune cell , limit efficacy immune attack . Giving DEC-205/NY-ESO-1 fusion protein CDX-1401 poly ICLC IDO1 inhibitor INCB024360 may generate strong long lasting anti-cancer immune response patient ovarian , fallopian tube , primary peritoneal cancer remission .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To determine safety fix dose DEC205mAb-NY-ESO-1 fusion protein ( DEC-205/NY-ESO-1 fusion protein CDX-1401 ) adjuvant poly-ICLC give vaccine combination INCB024360 ( IDO1 inhibitor INCB024360 ) . ( Phase I ) II . To evaluate toxicity define National Cancer Institute ( NCI ) Common Terminology Criteria Adverse Events ( CTCAE ) Version 4.0 . ( Phase I ) III . To determine progression free survival ( PFS ) ( primary endpoint ) use standard immune-related response criterion ( irRC ) criterion . ( Phase IIb ) SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . To determine effectiveness INCB024360 enhance vaccine efficacy assess cancer-testis antigen ( NY-ESO-1 ) specific cellular humoral immunity . II . Peripheral blood NY-ESO-1 specific cluster differentiation ( CD ) 8+ CD4+ T cell . III . Peripheral blood NY-ESO-1 specific antibody . IV . Peripheral blood frequency CD4+CD25+forkhead box P3 ( FOXP3 ) + regulatory T cell . V. Pharmacokinetics INCB02360 relation T cell frequency function correlation PFS . OUTLINE : PHASE I : Patients receive DEC-205/NY-ESO-1 fusion protein CDX-1401 via intracutaneous injection day 1 , poly ICLC subcutaneously ( SC ) day 1 2 , IDO1 inhibitor INCB024360 orally ( PO ) twice daily ( BID ) day 1-28 . Treatment repeat every 28 day 5 course absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . Patients receive IDO1 inhibitor INCB024360 7 course . PHASE IIb : Patients randomize 1 2 treatment arm . ARM I : Patients receive DEC-205/NY-ESO-1 fusion protein CDX-1401 poly ICLC Phase I . ARM II : Patients receive DEC-205/NY-ESO-1 fusion protein CDX-1401 , poly ICLC , IDO1 inhibitor INCB024360 Phase I . After completion study treatment , patient follow 30 day 3 , 6 , 12 month .</detailed_description>
