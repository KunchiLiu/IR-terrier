	<brief_summary>Transverse myelitis ( TM ) inflammatory disorder spinal cord lead disability gait . Dalfampridine , sustained-release potassium inhibitor show effective improve gait neurologic function multiple sclerosis . Dalfampridine potential improve neurologic function patient transverse myelitis rare disorder share similar pathogenic process multiple sclerosis . The clinical trial test efficacy dalfampridine TM . The clinical trial investigator propose conduct focus TM evaluate dalfampridine primary neurologic outcome , 25-foot time walk , several secondary outcome include valid behavioral neurophysiological test . This re-launch previous trial , include additional behavioral clinical testing .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Fampridine ( 4-aminopyridine ) potassium channel blocker study since 1970s effect amplify conductivity peripheral nerve , potentiate neurotransmitter release muscle increase post-synaptic action potential spinal cord . It test neurologic condition next two decade find limited therapeutic window due stimulation seizure high dos . The first randomize , placebo-controlled , double-blinded study fampridine 70 patient find significant improvement number neurophysiological parameter fampridine compare placebo . Since , least six additional study oral fampridine MS conduct found significant neurologic function . Although small incidence seizure alter mental status report study , concern fampridine causing seizure remain barrier acceptance fampridine MS therapy general neurology community . Recently , Biogen-Idec Acorda team development sustained-release formulation fampridine , dalfampridine , plasma concentration drug avoids toxic dos lead seizure . In two clinical trial , dalfampridine show beneficial two large cohort multiple sclerosis patient note improvement gait low extremity muscle strength . Seizures see high dos 20 mg whereas benefit evident approve dose 10 mg twice daily . The Food Drug Administration ( FDA ) approve dalfampridine use multiple sclerosis 2009 base key study evaluate gait time 25-foot walk . About 35-40 % study participant respond group improve walk speed 20 % . The investigator 's interest dalfampridine focus narrowly subset patient demyelinate disorder restrict spinal cord , transverse myelitis ( TM ) , include previous human trial dalfampridine . In contrast MS , affect entire system , transverse myelitis affect spinal cord largely spar brain . It associate increase risk seizure . Transverse myelitis define episode inflammation spinal cord lead disability level lesion . The majority TM lesion strike thoracic cord causing impairment low extremity . A single lesion cause symptom . The goal use dalfampridine patient amplify axonal conductance across lesion . This would manifest improve neurologic function involve low extremity include gait . This straightforward proof concept model prove mechanism action dalfampridine .</detailed_description>
