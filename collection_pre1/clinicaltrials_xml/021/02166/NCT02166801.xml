	<brief_summary>Children cerebral palsy ( CP ) life-long motor disorder typically subject extensive treatment throughout childhood . Despite lack evidence support effectiveness treatment aim improve motor function activity daily life . The primary area interest research programme determine effectiveness early intervention program child young 12 month age risk develop CP . A randomised control trial plan , address hand use , mobility communication home-based program . New treatment principle base recent knowledge brain plasticity employ . The overarch goal research programme develop evaluate new intervention principle child neurodevelopmental disorder base upon theory early learn induce brain plasticity . Our overall aim formulate follow : To evaluate effect early intervention programme overall development child risk develop cerebral palsy neurodevelopmental disorder . The program include intensive intervention towards focus : hand use , mobility communication home base program The hypothesis design Small-Step-Program intervention , clear focus specific area development different time period conduct child 's home environment , facilitate development effective usual care . The second hypothesis child learn practice , mean child rapid development within focus specific step training , compare , time , untrained step . The third hypothesis child 's ability learn within different step intervention programme influence specific characteristic underlie brain pathology . The fourth hypothesis parent study group less stress well cope child 's situation parent child receive usual care . Thus , tool provide within Small-Step-Program intervention , like education , supervision feedback practice communication task performance make parent able cope child 's delayed development .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Rational subject selection : Signs CP may visible already first month , accord recommendation diagnosis CP typically make 2-4 year age . The reason individual developmental trajectory muscle tone , postural control motor function vary considerably first two year . A child late development may recover atypical sign may disappear , opposite , CP may develop although early sign . Thus , dilemma late wait early intervention CP diagnosis make . In project address problem develop criterion infant high risk develop CP base early sign atypical motor development perinatal risk factor . That mean include infant get infant get CP diagnosis . Children meeting criterion CP 2 year age exclude analysis . The investigator assume intervention influence course development help child function high level , intervention `` cure '' CP prevent later diagnosis . Infants increase risk develop CP recruit project . The study group recruit infant expose increase perinatal risk factor , preterm birth , hypoxia , infection , retinopathy prematurity ( ROP ) chronic lung disease heart insufficiency , small gestational age , hypoxic ischemic insult morphological brain abnormality . These child commonly participate clinical follow programme child 's hospital regular examination 3months . The high-risk preterm infant follow examination exhibit delayed psycho-motor development display clinical sign abnormal neurology recruit . Recruitment also include child 8 month , demonstrate delay psycho-motor development clinical sign abnormal neurology refer physiotherapy department child neurologist hospital . Randomisation The aim include 40 child study group neurodevelopmental disorder reach sufficient power study . This number high investigator expect 50 % fulfil diagnose criterion 2 year age base previous experience intervention study . The aim include 20 child CP , reasonable approximation study population size reach sufficient power . The child allocate group block randomisation . The intervention group ( n=20 ) take part newly develop Small-Step-Program . The comparison group ( n=20 ) continue ordinary follow programme . Stratification use control gestational age ( preterm &lt; 37 term &gt; 37 week ) . Children Small-Step-Program '' randomise start mobility step hand use step . Rational second randomisation Our hypothesis train step improve , non-trained step result minor change child control group continuous developmental pace . The randomised step hand use mobility . The child group assess four occasion , start ( first examination ) , 12 week ( second examination ) 30 week ( third examination ) well 2 year age ( fourth examination ) . For child study group 3 additional time assessment order investigate second hypothesis . Parents group ask fill questionnaire ' four examination . Both parent ask fill questionnaire .</detailed_description>

Neurological sign investigate Hammersmith Infant Neurological examination ( HINE ) together clinical neurological examination . Magnetic resonance imaging ( MR ) use available support risk development CP , MR do clinical purpose use . The risk factor suggest inclusion intervention program confirm child neurologist . unstable health , uncontrolled epilepsy , progressive disorder , diagnosis specific syndrome . Parent 's communication language Swedish English satisfactory skill either language simple conversation . If child show catchup development second assessment ( 12 week ) show sign neurodevelopmental disorder program terminate</criteria>
