	<brief_summary>Aging human physically refers multidimensional process change accumulate person time . These age change responsible progressive increase chance disease death associate . So far , several theory develop understand age process , cross-linking , lead Maillard Reactions . Maillard Reaction complex series reaction reduce sugar/aldehydes amino group proteins . Under physiological condition , aldehyde product various exogenous endogenous amine catalyze semicarbazide-sensitive amine oxidase ( SSAO ) , family heterogeneous enzyme . It report SSAO show significant high catalytic activity , produce aldehyde age-related disease . However , SSAO perfect candidate monitor evaluate age , widely distribute tissue , readily accessible sample-sources clinical application . In work , investigator find 6 biomarker candidate develop standard-free , label-free MS-based proteomics method base standard protein ( human serum albumin , high abundance protein human plasma ) model vitro . Then , investigator want verify biomarker candidate clinical plasma sample see significant quantitative difference among people different age .</brief_summary>
