	<brief_title>NEOX® CORD 1K v Standard Care Non-healing Diabetic Foot Ulcers</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Patients identify study non-healing diabetic ulcer , 1-25cm² size . The patient 's wound ( ) monitor 2 week document wound pathology . Patients less 30 % wound area reduction 2 week screen period meet inclusion none exclusion criterion , enrol study . All patient assign study control group undergo sharp debridement . NEOX® CORD 1K matrix apply treatment group day debridement , cover wound veil , standard dressing . Both group monitor weekly , % decrease wound size record Baseline Weeks 1 , 2 , 3 , 4 , 6 , 8 12 . If wound progressing , additional application NEOX® CORD 1K may apply . The time complete closure record group . The study duration 12 week . Subjects control group continue suffer non-healing wound week 12 visit offer opportunity cross-over NEOX treatment follow additional 12 week .</detailed_description>
