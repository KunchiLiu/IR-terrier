	<brief_title>Laparoscopic Myomectomy Using Barbed Conventional Sutures</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>- Uterine leiomayomas common pelvic tumor woman . About 25 % uterine fibroids cause symptom bleed , pain , infertility , recurrent abortion pelvic pressure symptom . Surgery main line treatment symptomatic uterine fibroid . Hysterectomy typical management patient desire fertility .Myomectomy usually consider patient desire future fertility decline hysterectomy . Myomectomy traditionally perform laparotomy . During past decade , laparoscopic , hysteroscopic , robotic myomectomy largely replace open myomectomy . - A recent meta-analysis reveal laparoscopic myomectomy associate less hemoglobin drop , reduce operative blood loss , diminish postoperative pain few overall complication . On , operative time significantly longer laparoscopic myomectomy . The main difficulty encounter laparoscopy cause prolongation operative time difﬁculties knot tie difficulty maintain adequate tension suture line . - Recently , barb suture system use gynecologic surgery . In barbed suture system , delayed-absorbable non-absorbable material interrupt barbs prevent slippage tissue use suture tissue without knot . With barbed suture , wound tension evenly distribute across length filament rather knots end suture . The absence knot uniform tension thread tissue lead less ischemic damage , subsequent reduction pain adhesion . - A retrospective study compare perioperative outcome laparoscopic myomectomy use bidirectional barbed suture ( 107 patient ) laparoscopic myomectomy use conventional smooth suture ( 31 patient ) reveal use bidirectional barbed suture find significantly shorten duration surgery reduce duration hospital stay . - Till , one small randomize controllrd study ( n=22 arm ) compare use barbed suture conventional suture laparoscopic myomectomy .The myoma bed close either conventional polyglactin suture unidirectional barbed suture . The operative time shorter barb suture group ( 73.3 ± 21.4 min Vs. 80.7 ± 18.6 min ) difference fail reach statistical significance small sample size . However , time required suture myoma bed significantly low barbed suture group .</detailed_description>
