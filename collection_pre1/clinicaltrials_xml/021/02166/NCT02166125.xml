	<brief_title>Endoscopic Sutures For Gastrointestinal Tract Disorders : A Prospective Multicenter Registry</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Our institution performs therapeutic Interventional Endoscopy around 500-1000 patient year . We come across several gastrointestinal disorder fistula leak repair , gastric outlet revision , ( dilated anastomosis ) , stent migration , gastric wall defect perforation , ulcer repair , closure transgastric entrance NOTES procedure ( Natural orifice translumenal endoscopic surgery ) require placement suture and/or approximation soft tissue . Conventionally , surgery endoscopic alternative use resolve mitigate issue . However , surgery high morbidity mortality rate , endoscopic alternative may successful either . With advent endoscopic suture system Apollo Endosurgery OverStitch™ Endoscopic Suture System ( ESS ) ( Endo Stitch™ , SILS™ Stitch ) , advanced endoscopists place endoscopic suture deploy multiple run interrupted stitch single insertion endoscope within gastrointestinal tract . Currently , endoscopy unit use Apollo Endosurgery OverStitch™ Endoscopic Suture System ( ESS ) suture placement various gastrointestinal disorder ; include suture stent prevent stent migration esophagus . Even though several case report animal study publish report clinical success endoscopic suturing , hardly large sample size study verify safety efficacy endoscopic suturing . Our study report 12 case promise result esophageal stent subject . 1-16 We lack enough data evaluate verify technical feasibility , clinical success safety endoscopic suture specific gastrointestinal disorders.1-16 Evaluation factor would help u compare conventional treatment modality ; consequently help u identify appropriate treatment technique improve clinical management patient . The purpose prospective registry ass long term data efficacy , safety clinical outcome endoscopic placement suture ( ) approximation soft tissue within Gastrointestinal tract various GI tract disorder . The registry evaluate technical feasibility , clinical outcome , safety profile overall clinical management medical chart review . The procedure evaluate clinically indicate prescribe someone participate research study . Study Design : Prospective , observational , medical chart review least 6 standard care visit 1 year subject consent study participation . Interventions : None Subject Participation : Subject 's participation study allow u collect data least 6 standard care visit 1 year consent participate registry study . Subject undergo standard care clinically indicate Endoscopic procedure subsequent follow clinic visit part standard medical care . Subject sign separate clinical consent Endoscopic procedure placement suture ( ) . That consent form explain procedure well risk involve procedure . Subject undergo endoscopic suture subsequent follow clinic visit regardless participation study . Subject undergo additional test procedure part study . This registry study allow prospective review collection clinical data relate endoscopic suture safety efficacy assessment . Study duration : At least 6 standard care visit 1 year subject - Once subject consent , data collect clinically indicate standard care procedure visit follow visit . - Standard care follow visit endoscopic suture usually 1 month , 3 month 6 month post procedure . No additional research relate visit request . - All data collect Medical chart . - No subject survey questionnaire administer .</detailed_description>
