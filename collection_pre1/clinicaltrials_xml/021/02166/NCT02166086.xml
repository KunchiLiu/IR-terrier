	<brief_title>Advanced Imaging Registry Diagnosing Pancreatico-biliary Disorders</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Advanced image technique SpyGlass pCLE ( probe-based Confocal laser endomicroscopy ) use Cellvizio probe enable high sensitive specific diagnosis strictures tumor bile pancreatic duct . However , advanced endoscopists recently start employ technique diagnostic purpose . Hence lack enough data evaluate sensitivity , specificity , accuracy , technical feasibility safety image device . Evaluation factor would help u compare conventional diagnostic option ; consequently help u identify appropriate advanced image technique biliary pancreatic disorder improve clinical management patient . The purpose registry record information evaluate impact advanced image technique management pancreatico-biliary disorder . The registry evaluate diagnostic performance overall clinical management impact advanced imaging technique . This multi-center registry initiate : - To document impact advanced image technique pancreatico-biliary disorder clinical management pancreatico-biliary disorder include malignancy . - To assess sensitivity , specificity , accuracy , technical feasibility safety advance image technique pancreatico-biliary disorder . The registry review document : - All patient advance image do pancreatico-biliary disorder . - No subject intervention involve study . Subject contact need database review . Study Design Secondary site : - Other site must either database review protocol and/or clinical trial would collect data advance image do pancreatico-biliary disorder prior participate registry . - These site would IRB approve protocol collect send advance imaging procedure data primary site ( WCMC ) . Additionally , secondary study site would mention WCMC entity could receive PHI respective protocol consent/HIPAA form . - All secondary study site ' IRB approval send primary/coordinating study center WCMC . The primary center forward IRB approval WCMC IRB soon receive secondary study site . - Relevant IRB documentation maintain primary secondary site .</detailed_description>
