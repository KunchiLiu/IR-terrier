	<brief_summary>Malignant obstructive jaundice common complication advance stage pancreatic adenocarcinoma cholangiocarcinoma . Over 50 % common bile duct ( CBD ) obstruction due malignancy , majority neoplasms unresectable time diagnosis . Biliary drainage placement self-expanding metal stent ( SEMSs ) palliation therapy choice set patient . Conventional stent placement provide palliation limited duration subject come back obstructive jaundice . Due age , comorbidities , malignant disease status , good conduct reduce number therapeutic endoscopy reduce number complication . Additionally , biliary stenting may provide palliation , increase duration survival . Currently , two therapy . Recently , photodynamic therapy ( PDT ) evaluate palliative potential neoadjuvant modality . Therefore RFA confers similar benefit , may potentially use alternative PDT , give low adverse event profile . More recently , RFA recognize potential palliative treatment malignant biliary stricture . Based publish data , RFA provide palliation seem increase survival duration pancreatic cancer . Our limited experience show . The goal randomize control trial definitely confirm benefit Radiofrequency ablation ( RFA ) provide increase survival time quality life patient non-resectable cholangiocarcinoma pancreatic cancer . These benefit improve clinical practice make RFA new standard care unresectable cholangiocarcinoma ( CCA ) pancreatic cancer ( PC ) . It also enhance scientific knowledge open door new opportunity , e.g . RFA potential use neoadjuvant therapy downstaging agent surgically resectable patient .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma ( PC ) deadly disease . It remain fourth common cause death cancer USA one deadly cancer world . Although treatment improve , average PC 5-year survival around 5 % . Malignant obstructive jaundice common complication advance stage pancreatic adenocarcinoma . Over 50 % common bile duct ( CBD ) obstruction due malignancy , majority neoplasms unresectable time diagnosis . Biliary drainage placement self-expanding metal stent ( SEMS ) palliation therapy choice set patient . Metal stenting result biliary decompression great 80 % case low complication rate surgery . When compare plastic stent , SEMSs present significantly reduce risk recurrent biliary obstruction . SEMSs also cost effective plastic stent patient life expectancy longer 4 month . Despite numerous benefit , SEMS become occluded 50 % patient first 6-8 month . Covered SEMSs resistant tumor overgrowth sludge formation thus stent occlusion result increase morbidity mortality . This relief temporary since stent tend become obstruct . More recently , RFA recognize potential palliative treatment malignant biliary stricture . Photodynamic therapy ( PDT ) previously evaluate palliative potential neoadjuvant modality patient biliary obstruction cholangiocarcinoma . Therefore RFA confers similar benefit , may potentially use similar manner PDT , addition give low adverse event profile , may confer great patient tolerance . EndoHPB , intervention arm , endoscopic bipolar catheter design ablate tissue malignant tumor within luminal structure , biliary tree pancreatic duct . By use radiofrequency ( RF ) energy heat tissue duct prior insertion stent , surround tissue becomes coagulate may delay tumor growth time stent lumen become block . Thereby , allow increase period need intervention stent deployment . If EndoHPB use luminal RF demonstrate effective luminal tumor ablation , may additional role form neoadjuvant therapy pancreatic cancer . RFA use high frequency alternate current generate heat achieve coagulative necrosis contact tissue . Within bile duct , RFA appear safe may result decreased benign epithelial hyperplasia tumor ingrowth . Two recent study show efficacy safety RFA advance pancreatic cholangiocarcinoma . Subsequently , retrospective collection data cohort 26 patient treat endobiliary RFA malignant biliary obstruction Institution confirm safety approach suggest potential survival benefit 90 180 day post treatment compare matched control . A pilot study initiate IRB approve Weill Cornell Medical College 2011 primary investigator Dr. Michel Kahaleh . The study close Nov 2013 result show RFA significantly increase bile duct diameter . Analysis also show survival duration slightly increase Pancreatic Cancer group . - Hypothesis : Luminal application RF energy use EndoHPB bile duct patient cholangiocarcinoma pancreatic cancer provide ablation tumor cause biliary obstruction ( ) . Effectiveness assess look change diameter ( ) , cholangiography ass time till stent occlusion . - Study Design : Randomized , Controlled , 2- arm , Non-Blinded , Randomised control trial Treatment group : Endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography ( ERCP ) RFA biliary stenting . Control group : ERCP biliary stenting - Primary outcome measure : survival time , measure date randomization date death last date patient know alive . - Secondary outcome measure : Number Participants Adverse Events . To assess safety endoscopic bipolar radiofrequency catheter ( EndoHPB ) management unresectable cholangiocarcinoma pancreatic cancer . - Condition : - Unresectable Cholangiocarcinoma Pancreatic Cancer - Intervention : Endoscopic radiofrequency ablation use ENDOHPB probe .</detailed_description>
