	<brief_title>APN401 Treating Patients With Melanoma , Kidney Cancer , Pancreatic Cancer , Other Solid Tumors That Are Metastatic Can Be Removed By Surgery</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To determine toxicity establish maximal tolerate dose ( MTD ) APN401 . II . To determine effect APN401 immune response . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . To document clinical response survival . OUTLINE : This dose-escalation study . Patients receive autologous siRNA-transfected peripheral blood mononuclear cell APN401 intravenously ( IV ) 30 minute 1 course absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . After completion study treatment , patient follow every 3 month 2 year , every 6 month 2 year , annually 1 year .</detailed_description>
