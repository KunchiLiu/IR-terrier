	<brief_summary>Thioredoxin reductase play critical role lung cancer patient , vitro study show , ethaselen , specific inhibitor thioredoxin reductase , could inhibit lung cancer cell growth induce apoptosis . In China , phase 1 clinical trial ethaselen showed 1200 mg dose ethaselen could well tolerate , pre-clinical study find , approximately 50 % non-small cell lung cancer harbor high thioredoxin reductase expression ( IHC result ++ +++ ) , phase 1a/b ethaselen finished 2008 , result show 1200mg ethaselen per day safety tolerate Chinese malignant tumor patients.In pre-clinical research , group find , elevate thioredoxin reductase activity associate expression thioredoxin reductase test immunohistochemistry , mean high expression enzyme may favourite predicted factor ethaselen , specific inhibitor thioredoxin reductase .</brief_summary>
