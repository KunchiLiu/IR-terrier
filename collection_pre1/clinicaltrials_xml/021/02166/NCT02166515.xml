In recent year , incidence cervical cancer , especially young woman significantly increase ; ovarian cancer , although incidence malignant tumor female reproductive system rank second , mortality rate already first place ; morbidity mortality endometrial cancer also rise . The key gynecologic malignancy early diagnose treat . With advancement science technology , molecular biology technique widely use medical field , early diagnosis , proper treatment aspect gynecologic malignancy expect achieve breakthrough . Genome-wide scan strategy , make whole genome linkage analysis gynecological malignancy possible . Therefore , investigator intend find specific mutation provide new early screening approach gynecological malignancy , later result early diagnosis specific treatment gynecological malignant tumor .</brief_summary>
