	<brief_title>Postoperative Pain Control Results Using Periarticular Versus Intra-capsular Injection Bupivacaine Liposome Injectable Suspension Total Knee Arthroplasty</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This study do determine difference exist two method intraoperative ( surgery ) administration long-acting local anesthetic ( pain relief ) . Local pain relief medication accept standard care part comprehensive plan pain relief follow total knee replacement ( arthroplasty ) ( TKA ) . We expect addition ExparelTM usual post-surgery pain control medicine procedure result less need additional pain medication . It possible local injection tissue around total knee replacement joint ( periarticular tissue ) may provide effective pain relief injection directly joint ( intracapsular ) , vice versa . It also possible pain relief either method approximately equivalent . On day surgery , patient undergo total knee arthroplasty care utilizing standard protocol patient undergo total knee arthroplasty Broward Health Medical Center . Patients Group 1 receive amount ExparelTM inject intracapsularly . Those Group 2 receive standardize medication regimen include ExparelTM local infiltration periarticular tissue conclusion TKA procedure . Study participant undergo injection manner conclusion study . All subject provide method postoperative pain control follow TKA surgery patient enrol study .</detailed_description>
