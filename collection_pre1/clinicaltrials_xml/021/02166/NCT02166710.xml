	<brief_summary>Total knee arthroplasty ( TKA ) frequent effective surgery knee osteoarthritis . This major surgery associate reduction knee extensor muscle strength persist several week surgery . This decrease strength correlate poor functional recovery . Its cause multifactorial , include deficit quadriceps activation , acute postoperative atrophy muscle important limitation relate postoperative pain . Peripheral nerve block use local anesthetic frequently use postoperative analgesia follow TKA . Femoral nerve blockade reduces pain opioid consumption allow early passive mobilization surgery . This block also facilitate functional recovery allow early discharge hospital . However , block involve proximal femoral nerve contribute quadriceps weakness duration nerve blockade . Quadriceps weakness , turn , result functional impairment increase recovery time . A possible long-term quadriceps weakness associate femoral nerve block even suggest recently publish abstract . Hence , need alternative technique could minimize postoperative pain well femoral nerve block without cause weakness quadriceps muscle . Femoral nerve block perform level adductor canal seem promising alternative classic inguinal approach femoral nerve block . Studies compare femoral nerve block perform canal adductor level inguinal approach report similar quality analgesia , reduction motor block well functional recovery early postoperative period canal adductor block group . The long-term effect femoral nerve block perform level adductor canal knee extensor strength surgery remain study . This study ass knee extensor muscle strength ( principally quadriceps muscle ) 24h , 48h 6 week follow TKA patient femoral nerve block adductor canal level compare simulated block . Hypothesis : The adductor canal block allow superior recovery knee extensor muscle strength compare simulate block 6 week total knee arthroplasty .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>On arrival operating room , patient randomly assign receive adductor canal block ultrasound guidance simulate block . In adductor canal block group , 18 Gauge Tuohy needle insert position adductor canal adjacent femoral artery confirm use ultrasound guidance . Once adequacy position confirm , anesthesiologist administer 15 mL bupivacaine 0.25 % epinephrine divide dos examine quality spread . A 20 Gauge polyamide catheter insert 2 cm space . The needle withdrawn catheter fix place . Three mL mixture local anesthetic administer catheter anesthesiologist observe quality distribution . In simulated block group , insertion Tuohy needle injection 15 mL bupivacaine 0.25 % epinephrine simulate . The insertion polyamide catheter , withdrawal needle injection local anesthetic catheter also simulate . Surgery perform spinal anesthesia . A standardized dose bupivacaine morphine administer spinal anesthesia . In group , infusion local anesthetic initiate arrival recovery room continue first 48 hour . To preserve blind simulated block group , Luer-lock connector 50 mL empty pouch intravenous fluid affix catheter collect infuse local anesthetic . The empty pouch insert opaque dress . Patients adductor canal block receive infusion bupivacaine 0.125 % 12 mL/h patient simulate block group infusion medication infusion rate 1 mL/h . The infusion rate hidden patient . Multimodal analgesia use patient . Patients ask complete Knee injury Osteoarthritis Outcome Score ( KOOS ) questionnaire 6 week follow surgery . Knee extensor muscle strength measure use hand-held dynamometer pre-operatively 24 hour , 48 hour 6 week follow surgery . Pain score rest strength assessment collect . Opioids consumption side-effects attributable analgesia record . Patients ask rate global satisfaction regard quality analgesia 48 hour surgery . Time discharge record .</detailed_description>
