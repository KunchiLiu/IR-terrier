	<brief_title>A Study Cabazitaxel Patients With Breast Lung Cancer Recurrent Progressive Brain Metastases - Cabazitaxel Brain Metastases ( CaBaMet )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Cabazitaxel new taxane compound exhibit broad spectrum vivo antitumor activity , docetaxel - sensitive tumor model , also tumor model docetaxel poorly active . In contrast taxanes , cabazitaxel ability cross blood-brain-barrier . Marked antitumor activity obtain nude mouse bear intracranial glioblastoma . Consequently , good rationale investigate cabazitaxel patient breast lung cancer recurrent progressive brain metastasis . The primary object study measure objective tumor response brain metastases patient breast lung cancer recurrent progressive brain metastasis .</detailed_description>
