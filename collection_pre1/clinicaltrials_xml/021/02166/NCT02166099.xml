	<brief_summary>The purpose registry record information evaluate impact SpyGlassTM Direct Visualization System choledochoscopy management pancreatico-biliary disorder . The registry evaluate diagnostic performance overall clinical management impacted SpyGlass . This multi-center registry initiate : - To document impact SpyGlass Choledochoscopy pancreatico-biliary disorder clinical management pancreatico-biliary disorder include malignancy . - To assess sensitivity , specificity , accuracy , technical feasibility , safety cost effectiveness SpyGlass compare diagnostic modality .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Choledochoscopy Multicenter Registry</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Our institution performs therapeutic Interventional Endoscopy around 750-1000 patient year . During interventional procedure , advance emerge image technique include choledochoscopy , choledochopancreatoscopy , confocal endomicroscopy , chromoendoscopy , narrow band imaging , etc . conduct presumptive definitive diagnosis patient suffer pancreatico-biliary disorder ; include malignancy . Early accurate diagnosis necessary improve prognosis pancreatic cancer cholangiocarcinoma . Initial study show advanced image include confocal microendoscopy may majorly impact clinical management patient provide accurate diagnosis early . Choledochoscopy use microendoscopic visualisation lumen mucous membrane , diagnosis , classification therapy abnormally function gall-bladder pancreatic system . New refinement allow single user direct imaging endobiliary biopsy . SpyGlassTM Direct Visualization System ( Boston Scientific , Natick , MA ) platform design enhance diagnostic accuracy ERCP ( Endoscopic Retrograde Cholangiopancreatography ) allow guide biopsy . It FDA approve instrument ability perform cholangiopancreatoscopy single endoscopist ERCP . A 1.2 mm work channel exists within Spyglass system allow instrument access biliary pancreatic tree . Advanced Endoscopists various center U.S , outside U.S. , use Choledochoscopy SpyGlass assist confirmation diagnosis patient Billiary lesion . However , little data thus neglibible evidence regard agreement SPY interpretation within doctor . However , advanced endoscopists recently start employ SpyGlassTM Direct Visualization System single operator choledochoscopy . Hence lack enough data accurately evaluate sensitivity , specificity , accuracy , technical feasibility , safety cost effectiveness image device . Evaluation factor would help u compare conventional diagnostic option ; consequently help u identify appropriate image technique biliary pancreatic disorder improve clinical management patient . The purpose registry record information evaluate impact SpyGlassTM Direct Visualization System choledochoscopy management pancreatico-biliary disorder . The registry evaluate diagnostic performance overall clinical management impacted SpyGlass .</detailed_description>
