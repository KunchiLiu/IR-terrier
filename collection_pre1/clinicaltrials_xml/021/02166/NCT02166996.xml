	<brief_summary>A single-center , prospective , randomized comparison blind assessment cosmetic outcome . To compare cosmetic outcome surgical defect head neck , repair non-resorbable monofilament suture aspect suture removal time 7 14 day . Data gather standardized form time surgery concern width length surgical excision , patient systemic cortisone treatment diabetes mellitus . At time surgery patient randomise suture time 7 14 day postoperatively receive write information postoperative care restriction . Photographs scar take one month one year procedure rat use visual analogue scale ( VAS ) three independent assessor blind intervention suture time . The width scar measure one ear . Study hypothesis leave non-resorbable monofilament suture clean surgical wound head neck area 14 day lead poor cosmetic outcome .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Prospective Comparison Suture Removal Time Simple Surgical Defects Head Neck</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Patients cutaneous tumor undergo excision either biopsy-proven suspect cutaneous malignancy head neck area April 2010 November 2011 include trial . Patients include less 18 year old skin flap graft use . For patient several cutaneous change remove time excision register separately . The excision perform 11 surgeon . Four surgeon perform 66 % procedure . The assist nurse document data standardize form wound closure . Patient factor age , sex , diabetes corticoid treatment record . The width length skin excision measure , number suture place wound count size needle document . Whether wound edge undermine , whether excision orient natural skin tension line whether subcuticular suture use record . Skin closure monofilament nylon ( EhilonÂ® ) suture ( size 5.0 6.0 ) . After suture place , adhesive tape place perpendicular wound edge . The location wound mark cartoon later use follow . Patients randomize block 8 removal suture either 7 14 day . Randomization open seal envelope wound closure.Thus surgeon blind suture removal time . All Participants receive write information wound care instruct wet wound 48 hour operation . After could take shower take bath suture remove . After suture removal new adhesive tape place manner participant inform leave place least 7 day also protect scar sunlight least 6 month . For practical reason patient several excision randomize one suture removal time . Sutures remove surgical department conduct trial . Photographs take one twelve month skin closure . Photographs wound take standardized fashion one month follow use Canon EOS 550 research assistent . At twelve month follow scar width measure three point scar mean value calculate . The photographs twelve month follow take professional photographer use Canon EOS Mark 2 . The image assess two blind otorhinolaryngologist one blind plastic surgeon three station University Hospitals . Each image rat twice . A validated visual analogue scale ( VAS ) overall cosmesis use . The VAS 100-mm line 0 represent worst cosmetic outcome possible 100 represent best possible result . The minimum clinically important difference ( MCID ) 100-mm VAS 10-25 mm . Using line continuous entity , surgeon mark line , opinion best reflect overall cosmetic outcome . The score measure millimeter 0 point . Raters instruct take account variable scar width , contour irregularity , step-off border presence inflammation . Raters also ask note ( twice ) whether noticed puncture mark scar . This study power 90 % discriminate MCID 15-mm VAS 37 patients/scars require group ( p=0.05 ) . This base use standard deviation 19.4 previous study use VAS . Statistical analysis perform computer software ( Microsoft Excel 2011 SPSS ) together statistician Department Research Development Sundsvall hospital . Ethical committee approval grant study , inform write consent obtain patient participation . The study conduct Otorhinolaryngology division Surgical Center Sundsvall Hospital receive referral dermatology division , primary health sector private practicing otorhinolaryngologist ( ORLs ) .</detailed_description>
