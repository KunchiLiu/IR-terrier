	<brief_summary>Achieving near-normoglycemia establish main objective patient diabetes . However , postprandial glucose control challenge issue everyday diabetes care . Indeed , excessive postprandial glucose excursion major contributor plasma glucose ( PG ) variability subject type 1 diabetes ( T1DM ) . In addition , poor reproducibility postprandial glucose response burdensome patient healthcare professional . Automatic glucose control , so-called artificial pancreas closed-loop system , may represent ideal solution reach therapeutic goal diabetic patient . Intuitively , closed-loop insulin delivery may superior open-loop insulin delivery due good compensation variability subcutaneous insulin absorption intra-subject insulin sensitivity . However , several challenge exist effectively realize optimal postprandial closed-loop control blood glucose . Indeed , eat process induces one major glucose perturbation need control artificial pancreas currently one main challenge find clinical validation exist prototype artificial pancreas . In particular , experiment carry currently use algorithms glucose control ( call PID MPC ) show closed-loop insulin delivery often tend overcorrect hyperglycemia thus increase risk hypoglycemia . In project , rigorous clinical test novel closed-loop controller ( 'artificial pancreas ' ) carry T1DM patient treat continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion ( CSII ) . The innovative element controller safety auxiliary feedback base slide mode reference conditioning ( SMRC ) , demonstrate ( simulation study ) limit over-insulinization result hypoglycemia , reduce glycaemic variability . Standardized meal test study perform T1DM subject treat CSII , compare administration classical bolus ( open-loop study ) controller-driven prandial insulin delivery ( closed-loop study ) base continuous subcutaneous glucose monitoring ( CGM ) . The hypothesis close loop control provide good postprandial control , especially term reduction glucose variability incidence hypoglycemia .</brief_summary>
