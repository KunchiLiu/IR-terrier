	<brief_title>Valproate Dose Reduction Its Clinical Evaluation Introducing Lamotrigine Japanese Women With Epilepsy - Single Arm , Multicenter , Open-label Study -</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>RATIONALE In several study investigate effect utero exposure AEDs ( antiepileptic drug ) fetal malformation intellectual development child birth , report VPA cause neonatal malformation decrease intelligence child dose dependent manner , whereas risk low LTG ( Hernandez-Díaz et al. , 2012 ; Meador et al. , 2013 ) . It also report LTG adjunctive therapy VPA effective inhibiting seizure patient poorly control seizure , adverse event VPA monotherapy relieve subsequently reduce VPA dose LTG combine ( Sale et al. , 2005 ; Jozwiak et al. , 2000 ; Morris et al , 2004 ; Buchanan , 1996 ) . Thus , consider benefit replace VPA LTG childbearing woman , examine whether VPA dose reduce introduce LTG Japanese female epilepsy patient VPA monotherapy ( age ≥ 15 year , pre-menopausal ) . STUDY DESIGN Single arm , multicenter , open-label study TIME FRAME - Screening ( Retrospective review medical record 12 week ) - LTG escalation phase ( 8-18 week ) - VPA reduction phase ( 3-16 week ) - LTG &amp; VPA maintenance phase ( 12 week ) - Follow ( 1-4 week ) PRIMARY OBJECTIVE To examine whether VPA dose reduce additional administration LTG ( 200 mg/d safety concern ) Japanese pre-menopausal female epilepsy patient age 15 year old , whose seizure well control VPA monotherapy ( fixed maintenance dose 400-1200 mg/d ) . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES - To investigate steady state concentration LTG immediately VPA dose reduction , time VPA dose reduction , LTG &amp; VPA maintenance phase . - To investigate safety tolerability associate additional administration LTG follow dose reduction VPA .</detailed_description>

( Target disease ) Epilepsy patient follow seizure type classify International Classification Epileptic Seizures Partial seizure ( without secondary generalization ) Tonicclonic seizures without myoclonus without generalized seizure type ( ) 2 . Subjects confident diagnosis epilepsy uncomplicated pseudoseizures psychogenic nonepileptic seizure 3 . Subjects whose seizure control 12 week prior start investigational product stable maintenance dose VPA monotherapy ( 4001200 mg/d ) 4 . ( Age gender ) Japanese premenopausal woman least 15 year old time consent , lactating , agree use follow type contraception reliable fashion : 1 . Complete abstinence study well period study account elimination investigational product ( minimum 2 week ) 2 . Consistent correct use follow contraceptive method Surgical sterilization male partner ( i.e. , male partner sole sexual partner female subject sterilize prior subject 's entry study ) Intrauterine device failure rate le 1 % per year Double barrier method ( e.g. , spermicide plus condom diaphragm ) Note : Women hysterectomy tubal ligation consider nonchildbearing potential . Since pharmacokinetic interaction observe LTG estrogenbased oral contraceptive , use hormonal therapy contraception hormone replacement therapy allow . 5.Outpatients 6.Subjects keep seizure diary 7.Subjects understand sign inform consent . If subject 20 year old time consent , subject subject 's legally acceptable representative sign consent participate study . 8.QTc &lt; 480 msec subject bundle branch block QTc &lt; 450 msec subject , QTc measure either single triplicateaveraged ECG 9.Subjects comply dose investigational standard product study procedures 1 . Subjects history hypersensitivity LTG 2 . Subjects history rash associate AED treatment . 3 . Subjects receive another AED besides VPA 12 week prior start investigational product 4 . Subjects status epilepticus 6 month prior start investigational product 5 . Subjects history substance ( include alcohol drug ) dependence substance abuse define DSMIVTR within 12 month 1 month , respectively , prior start investigational product 6 . Subjects severe acute chronic illness likely impair drug absorption , distribution , metabolism , excretion ; subject unstable physical symptom likely require hospitalization study 7 . Subjects severe psychiatric disorder affect procedure study drug assessment 8 . Subjects acute progressive neurological disorder organic disease 9 . Subjects clinically significant cardiac , renal , hepatic medical condition . Any patient condition exclude study even condition control chronic therapy . 10 . Subjects unstable liver disease ( define presence ascites , encephalopathy , coagulopathy , hypoalbuminaemia , oesophageal gastric varix , persistent jaundice ) , cirrhosis , know biliary abnormality ( exception Gilbert 's syndrome asymptomatic gallstone ) Note : Chronic stable hepatitis B C acceptable subject otherwise meet inclusion criterion . However , subject chronic stable hepatitis B exclude significant immunosuppressive agent administer due risk hepatitis B reactivation . 11 . Subjects pregnant lactating , may pregnant , plan pregnancy study 12 . Subjects suspect urea cycle disorder : Subjects history encephalopathy coma unknown cause Subjects family history infant death unknown cause urea cycle disorder 13 . Subjects take inducer LTG glucuronidation ( i.e. , rifampicinor lopinavir/ritonavir ) , atazanavir/ritonavir , risperidone , oral contraceptive hormone drug contain estrogen 14 . Subjects take carbapenem antibiotic ( i.e. , panipenem/betamipron , meropenem hydrate , imipenem hydrate/cilastatin sodium , biapenem , doripenem hydrate , tebipenem pivoxil ) 15 . Subjects participate clinical study within 3 month prior start investigational product 16 . Subjects active suicidal plans/intent suicidal thought past 3 month prior start investigational product ; subject history suicide attempt last 1 year prior start investigational product multiple suicide attempt lifetime 17 .
