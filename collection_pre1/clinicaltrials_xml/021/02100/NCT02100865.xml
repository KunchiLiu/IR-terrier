	<brief_summary>Globally , approximately 2.1 million child die pneumonia year . Most deaths occur resource-poor setting Africa Asia . Oxygen ( O2 ) therapy essential support life patient . Large gap remain case management child present African hospital respiratory distress , include essential supportive therapy supplemental oxygen . We hypothesize novel strategy oxygen delivery , solar-powered oxygen , implement remote location non-inferior standard oxygen delivery compress gas cylinder .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Arterial hypoxemia pneumonia result several mechanism : pulmonary arterial blood flow consolidate lung result intrapulmonary shunt , intrapulmonary oxygen consumption , ventilation-perfusion mismatch . Hypoxemia risk factor mortality pediatric pneumonia , associate 5-fold increase risk death study Kenya Gambia . In one report Nepal , prevalence hypoxemia ( SpO2 &lt; 90 % ) 150 child pneumonia 39 % overall , increase rate hypoxemia across stratum pneumonia severity ( 100 % severe , 80 % severe 17 % pneumonia patient ) . General feature respiratory distress associate hypoxemia study , include chest indrawing , lethargy , grunting , nasal flaring , cyanosis , inability breastfeed drink . Few study report use solar power oxygen ( SPO2 ) delivery . One online report describes use battery-powered oxygenator Gambia could adapt use solar power ( http : //www.dulas.org.uk ) . Otherwise , intervention knowledge first example SPO2 delivery . New way deliver oxygen child pneumonia Africa could improve outcome save numerous life . If study document non-inferiority SPO2 relative standard oxygen delivery , novel method provide life-saving oxygen could roll across centre sub-Saharan Africa oxygen cylinder widely available electrical power reliable . The potential energy efficiency , low cost ease use make solar power attractive avenue investigation use resource-constrained setting . Proof-of-concept sun use drive oxygen delivery could stimulate commercial interest technology . The SPO2 system could thus achieve rapid penetration remote rural setting sub-Saharan Africa .</detailed_description>
