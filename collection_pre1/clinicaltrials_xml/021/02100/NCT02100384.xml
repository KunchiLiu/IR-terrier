	<brief_summary>Nowadays , dental implant attractive affordable treatment option patient . According American Society Implant Dentistry dental implant market U.S project reach $ 1.3 billion 20101 . Despite high success rate dental implant , clear osseointegrated implant susceptible disease . The prevalence dental implant complication rise number individual receive implant treatment also increase . One peri-implant complication inflammatory condition know peri-implant mucositis occur 64.6 % 80 % implant population . The lack preventive maintenance therapy subject peri-implant mucositis associate high incidence peri-implantitis , eventually may lead implant loss . One important method prevention peri-implant mucositis reduction plaque accumulation , individual oral hygiene procedure regular peri-implant professional maintenance . It highly important patient educate importance develop good oral hygiene habit attend regular periodontal maintenance appointment . The clinician recognize significance monitoring maintain peri-implant health . Unfortunately , unclear different maintenance regimens treatment strategy peri-implant mucositis peri-implantitis effective . There lack information peri-implant maintenance protocol offer best outcome term reduction inflammation improve patient comfort . According Grusovin et al , `` low quality evidence effective intervention maintain recover health peri-implant soft tissue reliable evidence regimen effective long term maintenance '' . Moreover , current approach implant maintenance somewhat haphazard standardize . It assume appropriate teeth also beneficial implant ; state Persson et al , 2010 `` therapy propose management peri-implant disease currently base evidence available treatment periodontitis '' . Two conventionally use method biofilm calculus removal teeth North America hand instrument ( curettes scaler ) ultrasonics . In teeth two modality treatment study extensively ; conversely , few study dental implant . Renvert et al , 2008 conclude mechanical non-surgical treatment might effective treat peri-implant mucositis peri-implantitis ; however , data support literature review scarce . The research group compare ultrasonic instrumentation specific-implant tip titanium curettes treatment peri-implantitis found group difference treatment outcomes improvement plaque bleed score effect probe depth . In addition , method fail eliminate reduce bacterial count group difference find ability reduce microbiota six month period . One main concern dental implant metal scaler ultrasonics generate roughen surface implant , turn facilitates plaque accumulation therefore make maintenance plaque free surface difficult . It observe recent study special coat scaler ultrasonic tip show vitro compatible implant surface , however confirm vivo . The previous finding agreement current study , demonstrate roughness value titanium surface implant treat piezoelectric ultrasonic scaler newly develop metallic tip plastic hand curette , equal surface 's roughness untreated implant . Mann et al , 2012 show vitro study plastic-coated scaler cause minimal damage implant surface leave plastic deposit behind implant surface , suggest research need evaluate use plastic tip debridement implant . An additional factor , evaluate efficacy different instrumentation peri-implant maintenance , need take consideration , patient perception . There currently data evaluate patient perception comfort regard hand vs. ultrasonic instrumentation . This information important method debridement consider equal efficacy , patient preference may play role practitioner 's selection instrumentation . Knowing patient comfort increase patient 's compliance maintenance therapy , evaluation factor necessary .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Long Term Comparison Ultrasonic Hand Instrumentation Maintenance Peri-implant Tissues : A Randomized Clinical Trial</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Long term comparison ultrasonic hand instrumentation maintenance peri-implant tissue : A randomized clinical trial Objective The aim study determine clinical effect , presence inflammatory cytokine , patient ' perceive discomfort compare titanium scaler ultrasonic instrumentation use implant insert patient population healthy peri-implant tissue implant peri-implant mucositis one-year period peri-implant maintenance . Hypothesis There insufficient study literature guide clinician technique offer good result maintain health decrease inflammation long term around dental implant peri-implant maintenance . It postulate study ( 1 ) peri-implant therapy beneficial clinical effect , decrease presence inflammatory cytokine well tolerate patient population ( 2 ) difference outcomes two peri-implant maintenance therapy . Materials Methods Previous approval Biomedical Research Ethics Board University Manitoba randomize clinical trial conduct May , 2014 May , 2015 Periodontics Clinic University Manitoba . The Oral Biology Laboratory University Manitoba perform analysis sample peri-implant crevicular fluid . The Consolidated Standards Reporting Trials , CONSORT Statement follow . 66 participant least one single dental implant recruit randomly assign one two peri-implant maintenance group . Subjects enrol study regular patient Periodontics Graduated Clinic University Manitoba , Faculty Dentistry . Each participant sign write informed consent . The randomization computer-generated second person involve study . A total 352 site ( 6sites/implant ) study . Cohen effect size use calculate sample size . Small medium effect size range Cohen : 0.2mm 0.5mm . In addition , independent t-test alpha=0.05 , power ( 1-beta ) =80 % , 95 % confidence interval two tailed test . Allocation ratio , n1/n2=1 . G*Power 3.1.7 software use sample size calculation . An attrition rate 6 participant calculate . A code assign participant . Only research coordinator access patients/codes match list correspond therapy . The peri-implant maintenance perform two experienced Dental Hygienists previous intra inter-examiner calibration . A single blind calibrated examiner ( MC ) record clinical finding sample baseline , 3 , 6 12 month . The following inclusion criterion : ( 1 ) subject least one single unit dental implant ( 2 ) probe depths 5mm 6 aspect around implant ( MB , B , DB , ML , L DL ) , ( 3 ) bone loss beyond 2mm/implant baseline confirm periapical radiograph cone paralleling technique . The next criterion exclude study : ( 1 ) implant support removable prosthesis , ( 2 ) use antibiotic within precede 3 month ( 3 ) smoker ( 4 ) miss exam baseline . The parameter assess 6 sites/implant following : ( 1 ) Modified plaque index Mombelli ( 2 ) Modified gingival index Mombelli , ( 3 ) probe depth ( PD ) , ( 4 ) presence keratinize gingiva ( 0 , 0.5-1.5mm , 2 great ) , ( 5 ) recession ( REC ) distance gingival margin occlusal point restoration , ( 6 ) Cytokine level peri-implant crevicular fluid , 1 sample deep site implant ( ) collect baseline , 3 , 6 12 month . In addition , patient also ask fill pain questionnaire end study period ( Visual analogue scale , VAS ) . To collect peri-implant crevicular fluid , site isolate saliva use cotton roll dry sample . Periopaper strip ( Oraflow ) introduce deep site implant sulcus 30 sec . The volume peri-implant crevicular fluid measure use Periotron . Until analysis strip store -80C seal plastic tube previously identify code correspond name patient . Pro-inflammatory/pleiotropic cytokine , find inflammatory process cellular level ass . The fluorescence base multiplex protein quantification system ( BioPlex , BioRad , Hercules CA , USA ) use measure follow eight cytokine : GM-CSF , IFN-gamma , IL-2 , IL-4 , IL-6 , IL-8 , IL-10 TNF-Î± . Ethical Considerations The patient ask review sign write consent form . Only individual involve study access data collect study . The record patient assign unique number store principal investigator desk within clinic premise . The master sheet link patient identifier unique number store safe clinic administrative office . In case possible continuation line investigation , data could compare new data ( introduction air abrasive ) . The master sheet patient record shred end 4-5 year . To thank participation study receive free maintenance appointment end study ( 12 month ) . Relevance study This study relevant currently long term vivo study determine effectiveness peri-implant maintenance also possible difference and/or similar outcome curettes ultrasonics peri-implant maintenance protocol .</detailed_description>
