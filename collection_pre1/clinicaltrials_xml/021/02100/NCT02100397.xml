	<brief_summary>Enteric fever responsible 20 million illness 200,000 death year . S. Paratyphi A account substantial increase proportion case , high 90 % region Asia . There currently vaccine direct S. Paratyphi A , although candidate preclinical phase 1 trial . This study fund European Vaccine Initiative Bill Melinda Gates Foundation . Paratyphoid human-restricted infection , currently small animal model available . In order understand host-pathogen interaction , study develop novel human challenge model investigate infection , use recent successful typhoid challenge model template . Healthy subject ingest dose Salmonella enterica serovar Paratyphi A , strain NVGH308 , drink bicarbonate buffer . Intensive follow 14 day establish whether participant meet clearly define criterion diagnosis paratyphoid infection . Statistical analysis perform outcome determine consistently give attack rate 60 75 % . If reach first cohort 20 participant , dose escalated process repeat . A maximum 80 participant enrol . Total follow course one year . Descriptive clinical laboratory data collect participant observation , sample blood , faeces , urine saliva allow insight disease host response . These insight forward knowledge paratyphoid disease may help discover develop diagnostic method . This study fund European Vaccine Initiative Bill Melinda Gates Foundation .

Anticipating development successful live challenge model study , possibility evaluate novel paratyphoid vaccine currently early clinical phase test . This serve important function field trial endemic area expensive time consume . Speeding process use model great benefit endemic area .</brief_summary>

Anyone take longterm medication ( e.g . analgesia , antiinflammatories antibiotic ) may affect symptom report interpretation study result . Contraindication ciprofloxacin , betalactam antibiotic trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole therapy . Female participant pregnant , lactate unwilling ensure partner use effective contraception one month prior challenge continue two negative stool sample , minimum 2 week completion antibiotic treatment , obtain . Fulltime , parttime voluntary occupation involve : Clinical social work direct contact young child ( define attend preschool group nursery age 2 year ) , Clinical social work direct contact highly susceptible patient person paratyphoid infection would particularly serious consequence ( unless willing avoid work demonstrate infected S. Paratyphi accordance guidance Public Health England willing allow u inform employer ) . Full time , part time voluntary occupation involve : Commercial food handling ( involve prepare serve unwrapped food subject heat ) Close household contact : Young child ( define attend preschool group , nursery age less 2 year ) Individual ( ) ( ) immunocompromised . Scheduled elective surgery procedure require general anaesthesia study period . Participants participate another research study involve investigational product might affect risk paratyphoid infection compromise integrity study within 30 day prior enrolment ( e.g . significant volume blood already take previous study ) . Detection abnormal result screen investigation ( clinical discretion study investigator ) . Inability comply study requirement ( discretion study investigator participant General Practitioner ) . Any social , psychological health issue , opinion study investigator , may Put participant contact risk participation study , Adversely affect interpretation primary endpoint data , Impair participant 's ability participate study . Having previously receive live oral typhoid vaccine ( receive Vi polysaccharide vaccine exclude ) . Having resident enteric fever endemic country 6 month . Have previously diagnose laboratoryconfirmed typhoid paratyphoid infection give diagnosis compatible enteric fever . Have participate previous typhoid challenge study ( ingestion challenge agent ) .
