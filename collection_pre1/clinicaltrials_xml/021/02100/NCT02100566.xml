	<brief_summary>People life-limiting illness often receive aggressive healthcare desire include costly procedure provide little medical benefit . Advance Directives ( AD ) reduce effect various factor limit adoption . A randomized trial target hospitalize patient serious , life limit illness test behavioral economics principle endowment ( possess something ) focusing ( feature something important patient ) motivate AD completion . Investigators examine offer patient AD default , combination frame rationale AD completion ( emphasize patient control caregiver burden ) improve AD completion family conversation compare no-intervention group . The study hypothesis determine rate AD completion family conversation high among patient receive intervention focus reduce caregiver burden ; two intervention group higher rate control group . The investigator suspect small change patient information frame ( endowment focusing use tandem ) potentially leverage large increase AD completion target HHC patient allow AD discussion early disease trajectory participate care decision .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Primary research question : Does offer patient Advance Directive ( AD ) document ( default ) , combination frame rationale AD completion ( emphasize either : A. patient control ; B. reduction caregiver burden ) improve AD completion compare no-intervention control group ? Study Design : The project conduct 3-group randomized trial ADs provide hospitalized patient default two treatment group . When discuss benefit AD completion , intervention group A nurse focus ADs ' potential promote patient ' control care receive . In intervention group B , nurse focus potential AD completion reduce caregiver burden . In control group , patient receive ADs actively request ( standard practice ) . Specially trained nurse responsible conduct intervention . Training RNs consist didactic experiential learn apply endowment focus effect script consistent manner true behavioral economic principle . Intervention occur hospital patient present one three option RN depend random assignment . Patients intervention group give AD default . Patients elect complete AD complete RN hospitalization separate visit hospital worker train Advance Care Planning ( ACP ) . Methodology Patient Eligibility : The research RN complete `` Selection Patient Form '' determine eligibility participation study ( see subjects/sample ) . Patients determine eligible study , ask willing participate study ask sign consent form . Intervention : Patient assign one three intervention group provide one three packet ( packet include script , copy `` Your Health , Your Choice : My Advance Directive '' , self-addressed stamp envelope ) . The RN provide designate script regard advance directive ( see `` Scripts Intervention Groups '' ) . Four possible outcome occur follow visit : A ) patient indicate desire complete AD hospital ; B ) patient indicate desire complete AD ACP facilitator separate visit ; C ) patient elect complete AD , D ) patient decline complete AD . A ) . Subjects/Sample : Hospitalized patient reside County randomize one three group . Eligibility determine discharge . Inclusion criterion adult patient , 50 year old , serious , life-limiting illness require hospitalization ( see ) . Eligible patient identify select concurrently new intake Genesys Regional Medical Center . Inclusion Criteria : A subject eligible study participation he/she meet 1 &amp; 2 criterion : 1.1 Age 50 year old 2.0 Subject must one follow serious life limit illness require hospitalization ( determine review medical record clinical judgment ) 2.1 . Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease ( COPD ) respiratory ( pulmonary ) disease require home oxygen use ( e.g . interstitial lung disease , sleep-disordered breathing ) , 2.2 . End Stage Renal Disease 2.3 . Peripheral vascular disease ( PVD ) 2.4 . NYHA Class III IV Heart Failure ( HF ) Class III : Marked limitation activity due symptom , even less-than-ordinary activity , e.g . walk short distance ( 20-100 ) . Comfortable rest . Class IV : Severe limitation . Experiences symptoms even rest . Mostly bedbound patient . 2.5 . Cancer discharge diagnosis ( type ) Type : 2.6 . Neuromuscular/movement disorder : Myasthenia gravis , ALS , Parkinson 's , Multiple sclerosis Exclusion Criteria : A subject eligible study participation he/she meet follow criterion 3.1 . Patient sign legal document consent AD ( Impaired decision-making capacity ) 3.2 . Previously specify write AD 3.3 Patient previously enrol study . Data Management Statistical Analysis : Sample Size- Calculated primary outcome AD completion rate , investigator use estimate baseline completion 10 % control group . A two-tailed test comparing completion rate default option standard , well , compare two framing intervention require total 350 participant ( 125 intervention 100 control ) . This achieve minimum 88 % power detect 15 % absolute difference group alpha 0.05 account 5 % attrition rate . The hypothesis AD completion rate differ least 15 % two group within arm ( default option compare control ; autonomy frame compare caregiver burden framing ) analyze use Chi-square analysis . Expected Outcomes Study : It hypothesize offer patient AD document ( default ) , combination frame rationale AD completion ( emphasize either : A. patient control ; B. reduction caregiver burden ) improve AD completion compare no-intervention control group .</detailed_description>
