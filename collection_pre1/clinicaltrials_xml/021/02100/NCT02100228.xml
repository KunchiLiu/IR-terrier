	<brief_summary>Some people develop abnormal heart beat know `` Atrial fibrillation '' `` AF '' put risk develop clot heart . Those clot travel blood circulation brain cause brain attack ( `` stroke '' ) . To prevent clot form , blood thinner ( anti-coagulants ) use . Apixaban blood thinner work stop one blood substance require clotting ( `` Factor Xa '' ) . It approve used prevent clot form people `` AF '' . Other establish blood thinner work stop clot substance make , know `` Vitamin K antagonist '' `` VKAs '' . An example type Warfarin ( Coumadin ) . The good effect blood thinner prevent clot , may also bad effect increase chance bleeding . People `` AF '' , abnormal heart beat , may benefit change back normal regular rhythm , know medically `` cardioversion '' . When do , people currently commonly treat `` VKA '' blood thinner ( e.g . warfarin ) . The purpose study assess good bad effect ( `` efficacy '' `` safety '' ) apixaban compare warfarin people `` AF '' early cardioversion plan .</brief_summary>
