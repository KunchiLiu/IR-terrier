	<detailed_description>This Phase II open-label study approximately 240 ( 400 ) healthy male non-pregnant female , 6 month 17 year old , inclusive . This study design assess safety , reactogenicity , immunogenicity two dos administer intramuscularly approximately 21 day apart unadjuvanted subvirion monovalent inactivate influenza H3N2 variant ( H3N2v ) vaccine ( MIV ) manufacture sanofi pasteur . Subjects stratify age ( approximately 120 ( 200 ) subject 6-35 month old , approximately 60 ( 100 ) subject 3-8 year old , approximately 60 ( 100 ) subject 9-17 year old ) . Subjects 6-35 month old cohort randomize receive either two dos H3N2v MIV , administer intramuscularly 7.5 microgram ( mcg ) hemagglutinin ( HA ) /0.25 milliliter ( mL ) dose ( approximately 60 ( 100 ) subject ) , approximately 21 day apart , two dos H3N2v MIV , administer intramuscularly 15mcg HA/0.5mL dose ( approximately 60 ( 100 ) subject ) , approximately 21 day apart . All subject 3-8 year old cohort 9-17 year old cohort receive two dos H3N2v MIV , deliver intramuscularly 15mcg HA/0.5mL dose , approximately 21 day apart . Subjects may receive licensed seasonal influenza vaccine prior ( &gt; 2 week give inactivated vaccine &gt; 4 week give live , attenuated vaccine ) first H3N2v vaccination . Alternatively , subject may receive licensed seasonal influenza vaccine time completion Visit 05 follow early termination visit . Safety measure occurrence solicit injection site systemic reactogenicity time H3N2v vaccination 7 day H3N2v vaccination . Unsolicited non-serious adverse event ( AEs ) collect time H3N2V vaccination ( Day 0 ( Visit 01 ) ) approximately 21 day last H3N2v vaccination ( approximately Day 42 ( Visit 05 ) subject receive two H3N2v vaccination ; approximately Day 21 ( Visit 03 ) subject receive one H3N2v vaccination ) . After approximately 21 day last H3N2v vaccination , non-serious AEs limit new-onset chronic medical condition , document approximately 7 month first H3N2v vaccination ( Visit 08 ) . Serious adverse event ( SAEs ) collect time first H3N2v vaccination ( Day 0 ( Visit 01 ) ) approximately 7 month first H3N2v vaccination ( Visit 08 ) . Immunogenicity test include perform hemagglutination inhibition ( HAI ) neutralizing ( Neut ) antibody assay serum obtain prior H3N2v vaccination ( Day 0 ( Visit 01 ) approximately Day 21 ( Visit03 ) ) approximately 21 day second H3N2v vaccination ( Visit 05 ) .</detailed_description>
