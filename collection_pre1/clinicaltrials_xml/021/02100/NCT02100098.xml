	<brief_title>Peripheral Nerve Block Anaesthesia Ankle Fracture Surgery - Exploratory Study : Is Rebound Pain Problem ?</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Peripheral nerve block ( PNB ) widely use anaesthesia postoperative pain control surgery . Several study suggest multiple benefit PNB 's primarily show elective surgery . Acute condition like ankle fracture different pain profile risk benefit PNB 's sufficiently research case . A recent study ( Goldstein et al . 2012 ) suggest rebound pain effect occur upon cessation PNB effect define pain increase significantly high level observe patient PNB point surgery . With prospective , exploratory study aim examine postoperative pain profile PNB anaesthesia ankle fracture surgery focus plausibility rebound pain effect ( define ) upon PNB cessation . Secondarily explore variety factor related postoperative pain profile feasibility PNB anaesthesia ankle surgery include efficacy , risk factor , time factor well postoperative recovery overall patient satisfaction . Results provide focus follow randomize controlled trial .</detailed_description>
