	<brief_title>Role Lung Ultrasound Pulsed-wave Doppler Lung Consolidations Mechanically Ventilated Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Ventilator-associated pneumonia considerable impact morbidity mortality intensive-care patient . Chest radiography , frequently use imagery test bedside lung evaluation mechanically ventilated patient , recognize poorly sensitive non-specific diagnosis ventilator-associated pneumonia . Bronchoalveolar lavage use bronchoscope remain reliable tool diagnosis nosocomial infection . However , bronchoscopy may feasible patient wait time final result become available may cause delay initiation treatment , thus increase risk mortality . Lung ultrasound promise non-invasive , non-radiant , portable easy use tool especially critically-ill patient . Dependent atelectasis frequent phenomenon mechanically ventilated patient . The presence clinical infection sign raise question nature infiltrate . A consolidation infectious nature differs atelectasis local hypoxic pulmonary vasoconstriction inhibition . In patient breathe spontaneously , possible detect difference use RAcT , measure pulsed-wave Doppler arterial blood vessel locate pulmonary consolidation visible ultrasound examination . The use pulsed-wave Doppler measure RAcT consolidation add value general lung ultrasound could help determine infectious atelectatic nature consolidation mechanically ventilate patient . However , RAcT never study patient positive pressure ventilation . In observational study , investigator explore role measure RAcT general lung ultrasound diagnostic tool detect pneumonia mechanically ventilated patient .</detailed_description>
