	<brief_title>Curcumin Cholecalciferol Treating Patients With Previously Untreated Stage 0-II Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia Small Lymphocytic Lymphoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To determine overall response rate ( ORR ) base National Cancer Institute-Working Group ( NCI-WG ) criteria chronic lymphocytic leukemia ( CLL ) Cheson criterion small lymphocytic lymphoma ( SLL ) . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . To determine time first cytotoxic treatment ( TFCT ) , progression free survival ( PFS ) , overall survival ( OS ) use regimen . OUTLINE : Patients receive curcumin orally ( PO ) daily day 1-28 cholecalciferol PO daily day 8-28 course 1 day 1-28 subsequent course . Treatment repeat every 28 day 6 course absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . Patients achieve partial response well may receive treatment total 2 year . After completion study treatment , patient follow 30 day every 3-6 month 2 year .</detailed_description>
