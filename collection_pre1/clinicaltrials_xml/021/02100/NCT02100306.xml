	<brief_summary>Stroke one lead cause disability , estimate prevalence 50,000 case per year Canada . Less half stroke patient regain use arm hand . There currently intervention regime gold standard , despite variety therapeutic technique use treat upper extremity post-stroke . The use external feedback improve motor learn technique le studied show promise . Therefore , purpose proof principle study test whether different auditory feedback frequency facilitate reach ability people stroke . In addition brain scan collect enable u determine stroke severity may impact one 's ability improve technique . We hypothesize patient receive less feedback ( 50 % alternate ) enhance learn relative patient receive feedback ( 100 % ) .</brief_summary>
