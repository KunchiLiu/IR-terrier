	<brief_summary>The investigator hypothesize Phase 2 cellular adoptive immunotherapy study use human leukocyte antigen ( HLA ) -haploidentical hematopoietic cell transplantation ( HCT ) follow early , post-transplant infusion donor natural killer ( NK ) cell Day +7 well-tolerated heavily-treated population ( safety ) , also provide mechanism treat high-risk solid tumor , lead improved disease control rate ( efficacy ) . Disease control rate define combination complete ( CR ) partial ( PR ) response stable disease ( SD ) . The investigator propose infusion donor NK cell influence development particular NK T cell subtypes provide immediate/long-term tumor surveillance , infectious monitoring , durable engraftment . Patients high-risk solid tumor ( Ewings Sarcoma , Neuroblastoma Rhabdomyosarcoma ) either measurable unmeasurable disease meet eligibility enrol trial goal enrollment 20 patient 4 year .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Phase 2 STIR Trial : Haploidentical Transplant Donor Natural Killer Cells Solid Tumors</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Patients receive reduced-intensity conditioning regimen 6 day consist Fludarabine 150 mg/m2 , Cyclophosphamide 29 mg/kg , 3 Gy total body irradiation ( TBI ) , follow HLA-haploidentical marrow family member Day 0 . On Days +3 +4 , Cyclophosphamide 50 mg/kg infuse selective vivo T cell depletion . Additional post-grafting immune suppression consist mycophenolate mofetil either tacrolimus sirolimus . Non-mobilized peripheral blood mononuclear cell collected donor Day +6 , NK cell select infused patient Day +7 . Patients monitor transplant-related complication undergo disease monitoring every three month first two year post-transplant . Research study conduct follow patient 's immune status quality life post-transplant .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>1 . No age restriction 2 . Only subject appropriate candidate autologous HLAmatched sibling hematopoietic cell transplant ( HCT ) may enrol . 3 . Diseases eligible 1 . High Risk Neuroblastoma ( NB ) : Must progress recurred standard frontline therapy include autologous HCT , ineligible autologous HCT . 2 . Ewing Sarcoma Family Tumors ( EWS ) [ include bone soft tissue Ewing Peripheral Primitive Neuroectodermal Tumors ( PNET ) ] . Must progress recurred standard frontline therapy include doxorubicin ifosfamide . 3 . HighRisk Rhabdomyosarcoma ( RMS ) Intermediate Risk Alveolar RMS recur locoregional tumor : Must progress recurred standard frontline therapy include chemotherapy vincristine , actinomycin , cyclophosphamide AND either surgery radiotherapy . 4 . Osteosarcoma : Must progress recurred standard frontline therapy . If first relapse , must recur ) ≥ 4 lung nodule ; b ) bilateral lung involvement ; c ) relapse outside lung . 5 . CNS tumor : High risk malignant brain tumor recurrent refractory standard frontline therapy eligible . Diagnoses include : Medulloblastoma , primitive neuroectodermal tumor ( PNET ) , ependymoma , high grade ( grade 3 4 ) glioma/astrocytoma , germcell tumor , atypical teratoidrhabdoid tumor ( ATRT ) Exclusion Criteria 1 . Rapidlyprogressing disease prior HCT , define clinical radiographic evidence disease progression ≤ 3 week prior protocol registration despite previous achievement stable disease ( Appendix C &amp; D ) ( Note : disease eligibility determine , additional imaging study necessary three week start condition unless clinical concern ) . 2 . Patients reach radiation threshold limit exclude receive 3 Gy TBI . 3 . Diffuse intrinsic pontine glioma ( DIPG ) exclude . 4 . Performance status : Karnofsky Lansky &lt; 60 % Note : Patients unable walk paralysis , wheelchair , consider ambulatory purpose assess performance score 5 . Patients , opinion investigator , may able comply treatment plan safety monitoring requirement study Page 16 86 Children 's Hospital Wisconsin Medical College Wisconsin PI : Monica S. Thakar , MD 6 . Significant organ dysfunction would prevent compliance conditioning , GVHD prophylaxis , would severely limit probability survival , define : 1 . Cardiac : For patient take inotropic medication cardiac failure require therapy : Symptomatic coronary artery disease ejection fraction &lt; 35 % , unable obtain ejection fraction , shorten fraction &lt; 26 % . If shortening fraction &lt; 26 % cardiology consult require PI final approval eligibility . For patient take inotropic medication : Patients display corrected cardiac function eligible , i.e. , patient take inotropic medication maintain EF ≥ 35 % SF≥ 26 % cardiac function eligibility . 2 . Pulmonary : DLCO &lt; 40 % TLC &lt; 40 % , FEV1 &lt; 40 % and/or receive supplementary continuous oxygen 3 . Liver : Patient clinical laboratory evidence liver disease evaluate cause liver disease , clinical severity term liver function , bridge fibrosis , degree portal hypertension . The patient exclude he/she find fulminant liver failure , cirrhosis liver evidence portal hypertension , alcoholic hepatitis , esophageal varix , history bleed esophageal varix , hepatic encephalopathy , uncorrectable hepatic synthetic dysfunction evince prolongation prothrombin time , ascites related portal hypertension , bacterial fungal liver abscess , biliary obstruction , chronic viral hepatitis total serum bilirubin &gt; 3mg/dL , symptomatic biliary disease 7 .

Fertile female unwilling use contraceptive technique twelve month follow treatment , well females pregnant actively breast feed 11 . Fertile male unwilling use contraceptive technique twelve month follow treatment 12 . Life expectancy severely limited disease malignancy 13 . Patients receive prior allogeneic HCT ineligible DONOR SELECTION An Unrelated Donor Search require entry trial . Lack HLAmatched relate unrelated donor requirement entry trial . A . Inclusion Criteria 1 . Related , HLAhaploidentical donor identical one HLA haplotype mismatch number HLAA , B , C , DRB1 DQB1 locus unshared haplotype . 2 . Marrow prioritize hematopoietic stem cell source choice . In case adequate stem cell collect , fresh ( prefer ) cryopreserved donor PBSC may substitute . In case PBSC use , donor must 18 year age old . 3 . HLAhaploidentical donor selection base standard institutional criterion ; otherwise specific prioritization make amongst suitable available donor . B. Exclusion Criteria 1 . Children le 12 year age ( marrow ) less 18 year age ( PBSC ) . 2 .
