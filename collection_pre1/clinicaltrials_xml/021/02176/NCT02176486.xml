	<detailed_description>The drug test study call ixazomib . Ixazomib test find safe well tolerate dose participant lupus nephritis . This study look side effect lab result participant take ixazomib , along determination pharmacokinetics ( PK ) . This study design randomize , sequential-panel , multiple rise dose study . The study enroll approximately 40 participant . The study population consist 4 Cohorts . At least 5 participant ( 4:1 ) recruit 0.5 mg dose group ( Cohort A ) , least 5 participant ( 4:1 ) 2.0 mg dose group ( Cohort B ) , 8 participant ( 6:2 ) 3.0 mg dose group ( Cohort C ) , 8 participant ( 6:2 ) 4.0 mg dose group ( Cohort D ) . Participants Cohort ask take one capsule Days 1 , 8 15 28-days cycle , 3 cycle . PK sample collect Predose Days 1 , 8 15 . Cycle 1 - Postdose Day 1 0.25 , 0.5 , 1 , 1.5 , 2 , 4 , 8 , 24 , 168 hour . Cycle 2 - Postdose Day 15 168 hour . Cycle 3 - Postdose Day 15 follow third dose , sample collect 0.25 , 0.5 , 1 , 1.5 , 2 , 4 , 8 , 24 , 168 312 hour . The start dose Cohort 1 0.5 mg follow administration 2 , 3 4 mg subsequent cohort . This multi-center trial conduct United States Europe . The overall time participate study 196 day . Participants make 19 visit clinic treatment period make follow-up visit monthly 3 month follow-up assessment .</detailed_description>
