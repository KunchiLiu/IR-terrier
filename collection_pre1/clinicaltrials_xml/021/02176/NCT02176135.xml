	<brief_title>Oral Auranofin Reduction Latent Viral Reservoir Patients With HIV Infection</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The investigator propose novel approach order reduce HIV viral reservoir . This approach exploit effect auranofin , gold base compound use treatment rheumatoid arthritis . Auranofin induce partially selective apoptosis differentiation towards short-lived phenotype T lymphocyte memory subset encompass main viral reservoir patient . The hypothesis target memory cell would either die decrease persistence body , associate latent viral reservoir reduce . The study conduct two phase : A sequential dose-escalation phase evaluate two dos auranofin , follow expansion maximum tolerate dose ( MTD ) . A total 20 patient treated MTD . Auranofin treatment administer 12 week . Safety tolerability evaluate repeated laboratory panel physcial examination 12 week auranofin therapy 8 week thereafter . The latent reservoir measure assessment inegrated viral DNA CD4+ cell circulate blood gut biopsy .</detailed_description>
