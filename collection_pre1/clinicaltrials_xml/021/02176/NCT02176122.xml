	<brief_summary>No randomize control trial ( RCTs ) yet perform compare different treatment option AmpC ESBL-producing Enterobacteriaceae . During last 10 year see exponentially increase rate carbapenem resistance worldwide , include Australia New Zealand . The investigator urgently need data well-designed RCTs guide clinician treatment antibiotic resistant Gram-negative infection . The investigator face situation commonly use antibiotic infection ( meropenem ) may drive carbapenem resistance . For reason , investigator seek compare carbapenem-sparing regimen carbapenem treatment infection . Formal evaluation safety efficacy generic antibiotic treatment infection immense clinical public health importance , formal trial yet conduct address issue . The international collaboration team clinician researcher , leader field , make highly likely outcome trial significant impact clinical practice . The investigator ' hypothesis piperacillin/tazobactam ( carbapenem-sparing regimen ) non-inferior meropenem ( widely use carbapenem ) definitive treatment bloodstream infection due third-generation cephalosporin non-susceptible E. coli Klebsiella specie .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>RCT Meropenem v Piperacillin-Tazobactam Definitive Treatment BSI 's Due Ceftriaxone Non-susceptible Escherichia Coli Klebsiella Spp .</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Escherichia coli Klebsiella spp . common cause bacteraemia , may acquire gene encode extended-spectrum beta-lactamase ( ESBLs ) AmpC beta-lactamase ( 1 ) . ESBL AmpC producer typically resistant third generation cephalosporins ceftriaxone , susceptible carbapenems ( 1 ) . Observational study perform evaluate antibiotic choice ESBL producer ( 2-9 ) . In study outcome treatment serious infection ESBL producer significantly surpass carbapenems ( 2-9 ) . Despite potential advantage carbapenems treatment ceftriaxone non-susceptible organism , widespread use carbapenems may cause selection pressure lead carbapenem-resistant organism . This significant issue since carbapenem-resistant organism treat `` last-line '' antibiotic colistin . Some new beta-lactam antibiotic beta-lactamase inhibitor , active ESBL , AmpC carbapenemase produce organism , advance clinical development ( 10 ) . However , antibiotic likely expensive may best hold reserve infection alternative . Therefore , see need establish efficacy generically available alternative carbapenems serious infection . The susceptibility ESBL producer AmpC producer piperacillin/tazobactam less predictable carbapenems . By definition , ESBLs inhibit beta-lactamase inhibitor tazobactam ( 1 ) . However , E. coli Klebsiella may produce multiple beta-lactamase type resistant inhibition tazobactam . Additionally , case outer membrane protein loss may contribute resistance tazobactam . By definition , AmpC inhibit beta-lactamase inhibitor tazobactam . However , despite limitation , approximately 50 % ceftriaxone non-susceptible E. coli Klebsiellae remain susceptible vitro piperacillin/tazobactam ( 1 ) . No randomised control trial yet perform compare different treatment option ceftriaxone resistant Enterobacteriaceae . The large observational study analysis treatment outcome publish February 2012 Rodriguez-Bano colleague ( 9 ) . They perform post-hoc analysis six publish cohort patient bacteraemia due ESBL produce E. coli . Two nonmutually exclusive cohort ( empirical therapy definitive therapy ) construct analysed separately . In cohort , carbapenems superior beta-lactam/beta-lactamase inhibitor combination ( BLBLIC ) . Specifically , definitive therapy cohort , mortality rate 30 day significantly different - 9.3 % receive BLBLIC 16.7 % receive carbapenem ( p &gt; 0.20 ) ( 9 ) .</detailed_description>
