	<brief_summary>This phase III trial study well response biology-based risk factor-guided therapy work treat young patient non-high risk neuroblastoma . Sometimes tumor may need treatment progress . In case , observation may sufficient . Measuring biomarkers tumor cell may help plan effective treatment necessary best treatment . Response biology-based risk factor-guided therapy may effective treat patient non-high risk neuroblastoma may help avoid risks side effect related standard treatment .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Response Biology-Based Risk Factor-Guided Therapy Treating Younger Patients With Non-high Risk Neuroblastoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To eliminate therapy initial approach infant &lt; 12 month age small International Neuroblastoma Risk Group ( INRG ) stage L1 neuroblastoma maintain overall survival ( OS ) 99 % . II . To eliminate therapy initial approach non-high-risk patient &lt; 18 month age localize neuroblastoma favorable biology ( histologic genomic feature ) maintain OS 99 % . III . To achieve 3-year OS &gt; 81 % infant &lt; 18 month age INRG stage Ms neuroblastoma use objective criterion early initiation response-based treatment algorithm . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . To describe time intervention tumor progression , type intervention site progression patient localized neuroblastoma experience progression initial period observation . II . To characterize pharmacokinetic profile chemotherapeutic agent carboplatin etoposide patient stage Ms disease . III . To define genomic profile tumor patient non-high-risk neuroblastoma initial biopsy time subsequent biopsy surgical resection . IV . To describe histology tumor specimen obtain time subsequent biopsy surgical resection . V. To determine salvage rate ( OS ) patient tumor relapse disease progression . VI . To determine procedural complication rate ( initial biopsy , resection [ intraoperative postoperative ] , subsequent biopsy ) correlate degree surgical resection . VII . To determine rate reduction image define risk factor ( IDRF ) L2 tumor follow observation chemotherapy . OUTLINE : Patients assign 1 3 treatment group . GROUP A : Patients undergo clinical observation 96 week absence disease progression . GROUP B : Patients undergo clinical observation 3 year absence disease progression . Upon disease progression , patient undergo surgery receive first-line chemotherapy comprise carboplatin intravenously ( IV ) 1 hour day 1 ( course 1 , 2 , 4 , 6 , 7 ) , etoposide IV 1 hour day 1-3 ( course 1 , 3 , 4 , 5 , 7 ) , cyclophosphamide IV 1 hour day 1 ( course 2 , 3 , 5 , 6 , 8 ) , doxorubicin hydrochloride IV 15 minute day 1 ( course 2 , 4 , 6 8 ) . Treatment chemotherapy repeat every 21 day 2-8 course absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . Once partial response ( PR ) well achieve , patient undergo clinical observation 3 year . GROUP C : Patients high risk deterioration poor outcome immediately receive first-line chemotherapy Group B . All patient undergo clinical observation 3 year absence disease progression . Upon disease progression , patient receive first-line chemotherapy Group B . Once PR well achieve , patient undergo clinical observation 3 year . After completion study treatment , patient follow annually 5 year .</detailed_description>
