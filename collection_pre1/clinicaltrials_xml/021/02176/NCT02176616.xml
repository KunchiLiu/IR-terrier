	<brief_summary>1 . Purpose study 1 ) To compare clinical outcome , procedure time , complication rate patient change paroxysmal atrial fibrillation persistent atrial fibrillation ablation conventional pulmonary vein isolation ablation conventional pulmonary vein isolation conventional linear ablation . 2 . Scientific evidence study 1 . In atrial fibrillation patient , maintenance normal sinus rhythm show significant reduction mortality . 2. drug therapy anti-arrhythmic drug show many complication side effect , thus non-drug therapy catheter ablation develop . 3. catheter ablation perform 10years world-wide , show superior treatment outcome compare drug therapy . 4 . However , consensus proper ablation strategy patient change paroxysmal atrial fibrillation persistent atrial fibrillation . 5. additional ablation make extent myocardial injury paradoxically increase recurrence rate , thus still controversial . 6 . Therefore , compare conventional pulmonary vein isolation additional conventional linear ablation . 3 . Methods 1 . Treatment All patient atrial fibrillation perform accord standard treatment guideline atrial fibrillation . 2. additional blood sampling , image study , invasive procedure accord inclusion study . 4. study content 1 ) evaluate superior ablation strategy patient change paroxysmal atrial fibrillation persistent atrial fibrillation - compare conventional pulmonary vein isolation additional liner ablation , strategy conventional ablation strategy perform world-wide .</brief_summary>
