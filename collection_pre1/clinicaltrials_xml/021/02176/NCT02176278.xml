	<brief_summary>In quality improvement program ( DKD-TMT ) , patient recruit multiple site across Asia , site recruit least 300 type 2 diabetic patient Diabetic Kidney Disease ( DKD ) . After explanation train doctor nurse , write informed consent , patient randomize UC ( n=100 , usual care ) group , EC ( n=100 , empower care ) group , TEC ( n=100 , team-based , empowered care ) group . Patients 3 group undergo comprehensive assessment ( CA ) guide template Joint Asia Diabetes Evaluation ( JADE ) portal baseline month 12 . They also self-administer set questionnaire assess quality life psychological distress CA time point . During 12 month 2 CAs : - Patients UC group receive UC accordance practice health institution . - Patients EC group receive JADE summary report personalize risk prediction , treatment target decision support explanation doctor nurse . In addition receive UC accordance practice health institution , nurse telephone patient 3-monthly remind adhere treatment , provide support empower discus doctor treatment need concern . - Patients TEC group follow doctor-nurse team least 3 monthly achieve multiple target , tailor patient ' risk profile .

	<brief_title>Using Diabetic Kidney Disease ( DKD ) Registry Treat Multiple Targets ( TMT )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Hypothesis : Patient empowerment team-based care augment JADE program feature risk stratification decision support improve multiple risk factor control Asian type 2 diabetic patient chronic kidney disease . Attaining multiple treatment target reduce diabetes-related endpoint high risk patient . Objectives : To use JADE program 1 ) include task delegation change workflow augment 2 ) web-based portal consist feature risk stratification , feedback , recommendation decision support set DKD registry order 1 ) document control risk factor care standard real practice Asian type 2 diabetic patient ; 2 ) empower doctor patient make informed decision 3 ) use team approach treat multiple target reduce diabetes related clinical outcome . Study design : This multicentre randomize translational program compare effect usual care ( UC ) versus empower care ( EC ) versus team-based , empower care ( TEC ) risk factor control clinical outcome 3000 patient DKD Asian country . Intervention : All patient undergo comprehensive assessment ( CA ) guide template JADE portal baseline month 12 . All patient also self-administer set questionnaire assess quality life ( EQ-5D-3L , WHOQOL-BREF , Time Trade-Off ( TTO ) question ) psychological distress ( PHQ-9 DASS-21 ) CA baseline month 12 . During 12 month 2 CAs : - Patients UC group receive UC accordance practice health institution . - Patients EC group receive JADE summary report personalize risk prediction , treatment target decision support explanation doctor nurse . In addition receive UC accordance practice health institution , nurse telephone patient 3-monthly remind adhere treatment , provide support empower discus doctor treatment need concern . - Patients TEC group follow doctor-nurse team least 3 monthly achieve multiple target , tailor patient ' risk profile . The patient receive telephone reminder also give JADE follow report 3-monthly . Outcome : The primary composite endpoint attainment treatment goal and/or control risk factor .
