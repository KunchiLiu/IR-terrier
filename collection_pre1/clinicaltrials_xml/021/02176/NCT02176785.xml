	<brief_title>The Effect Pre-Frontal tDCS Sleep Propensity During Afternoon Nap : RCT</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Recent study demonstrate cortical direct current ( DC ) change accompany sleep onset transition sleep state stereotype manner . In study determine negative potential shift occur prior transition wakefulness sleep transition Rapid Eye Movement sleep ( REM ) sleep , Non-Rapid Eye Movement ( NREM ) sleep . In subset experiment demonstrate DC potential shift occur transition wake sleep afternoon nap . The recorded DC potential shift occur predominantly pre-frontal cortex ( F3 , F4 ) , spread central area . No current literature exist explore whether tDCS could use modulate cortical activity prior sleep , result either increase decreased sleep propensity . The application focal , non-invasive brain stimulation already lead novel effective treatment neuropsychiatric disease minimal side effect ( Most well study depression repetitive Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation , rTMS ) . Should application tDCS modulate sleep propensity would represent novel study paradigm potential lead completely novel treatment sleep disturbance . With small pilot study , propose take first step explore utility tDCS modulate sleep propensity . We propose recruit 15 healthy non-treatment seek participant community expose three total nap condition randomize counter balance fashion , 10 minute either , Anodal , Cathodal , Sham tDCS stimulation occur prior nap opportunity .</detailed_description>
