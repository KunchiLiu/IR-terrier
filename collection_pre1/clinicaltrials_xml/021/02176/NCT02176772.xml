	<brief_summary>Background : The disease burden tuberculosis ( TB ) , second HIV/AIDS among infectious disease , major public health problem develop country . Accumulating evidence suggest iron status primary determinant TB progression . Anaemia prevalent patient TB , particularly sub-Saharan Africa , associate increased mortality . Anaemia TB may due inflammation , dietary iron deficiency , , distinguish among aetiology difficult . Iron supplementation commonly use treat anaemia TB patient , may unnecessary inflammation cause . Body iron sequester TB inflammation mobilize treatment use correct anaemia . Moreover , supplemental iron may retain within macrophage , potentially increase susceptibility TB lead poorer clinical outcome . Thus , good understand iron metabolism TB aetiology TB-related anaemia would clarify potential role iron pathogenesis optimal management disease . The investigator hypothesize : ) TB increase circulate hepcidin thereby impair dietary iron absorption systemic utilization iron , result iron sequestration anaemia ; b ) TB treatment resolution inflammation 6 month decrease circulate hepcidin , correct impairment improve iron status hemoglobin ; c ) majority iron utilized replenish hemoglobin recovery TB come mobilization sequester iron store rather iron absorption . Objectives : Use iron stable isotope characterize iron balance six month TB treatment , specifically : ) quantify oral intravenous iron incorporation ( oral absorption systemic iron utilization ) three time point TB treatment ( acute disease , intensive treatment phase completion continuation treatment phase ) ; b ) determine effect treatment iron mobilization store replenish hemoglobin . Methods/Subjects : Using triple stable-isotope technique , iron absorption label test meal ( 57Fe ) systemic iron utilization label intravenous dos ( 54Fe , 58Fe ) determine 18 Tanzanian subject newly diagnose pulmonary TB . The subject study three time point ( ) day TB diagnosis infect , ( ii ) 8 week intensive phase treatment , ( iii ) another 16 week continuation phase treatment . Iron status , hemoglobin , hepcidin inflammation index measure time point . Isotope enrichment two treatment phase measure estimate relative rate iron absorption mobilization store intensive continuation phase determine relative contribution iron absorption iron mobilization store TB treatment recovery . Outcome : These study provide important new insight aetiology anaemia iron metabolism TB patient . The result provide essential data evidence-based recommendation timing , administration route efficacy iron therapy patient TB , make possible , safer effective treatment anaemia TB decrease morbidity mortality disease .</brief_summary>
