	<brief_title>Low-Fat Diet Fish Oil Men Active Surveillance Prostate Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To determine 1-year low-fat fish oil ( omega-3 fatty acid ) intervention result decrease prostate cancer proliferation compare control group men active surveillance . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . To evaluate effect low-fat ( LF ) /fish oil ( FO ) intervention prostate biopsy tissue marker proliferation cell cycle progression , prostate biopsy pathologic feature ( Gleason grade , percent core cancer , percent tissue cancer ) , prostate-specific antigen ( PSA ) , long-term clinical outcome ( clinical progression , prostate cancer therapy ) . II . To evaluate potential surrogate biomarkers proliferation ( red blood cell [ RBC ] membrane fatty acid analysis , ex-vivo bioassay ) . III . To determine correlation exists free fatty acid receptor 4 ( GPR120 ) level antiproliferative response LF/FO intervention . IV . To evaluate compliance 1-year LF/FO intervention . V. To evaluate safety 1-year LF/FO intervention . OUTLINE : Patients randomize 1 2 arm . ARM I : Patients receive intervention . ARM II : Patients receive dietary counseling research dietitian weekly 1 month monthly 11 month . Patients give guideline recommend meal follow low-fat diet comprise 20 % kilocalorie ( Kcal ) fat , 15 % Kcal protein , 65 % Kcal carbohydrates 1 year . Patients also receive 4 fish oil capsule per day orally ( PO ) 1 year . After completion study , patient follow yearly 15 year .</detailed_description>
