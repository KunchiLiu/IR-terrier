	<brief_summary>The purpose study examine impact Sleep Disordered Breathing ( SDB ) treatment person chronic Spinal Cord Injury ( SCI ) . The central hypothesis treatment SDB Positive Airway Pressure ( PAP ) improve cognition , sleep quality , health relate quality life ( HRQOL ) , pain Cardiovascular Disease ( CVD ) surrogate measure person chronic SCI .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Investigators examine effect PAP therapy sleep apnea thinking ( especially memory , learn concentration ) , quality life , sleep quality , risk future heart ( cardiovascular ) problem person chronic spinal cord injury ( SCI ) . SDB condition pause breathe shallow breathing sleep due airway narrow . This lead low oxygen level sleep sleep disruption . The usual treatment sleep apnea PAP ( Positive Airway Pressure ) wear sleep . This involve use usually mask connected machine supply enough pressure keep airway open sleep . SDB diagnose SCI participant use unattended portable level II polysomnography ( PSG ) ( portable home sleep study one night ) . Sleep quality ( SQ ) , SDB risk , insomnia severity , daytime sleepiness , pain severity , mood , HRQOL measure use questionnaire . Cognitive evaluation complete prior randomization participant also complete portable PSG evaluate general pre-morbid function , immediate verbal memory , simple sustain attention , process speed , executive function . Blood urine sample take participant SDB diagnosis randomization . All randomized subject fit nasal full-face mask head gear . PAP deliver auto-titrating device . These device automatically set level deliver pressure ensure upper airway patency , treat detect apnea , hypopnea . All subject instruct use device nightly sleep , ensue four month . All outcome measurement reassess four month PAP .</detailed_description>
