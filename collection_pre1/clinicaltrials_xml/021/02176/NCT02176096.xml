	<brief_summary>The objective demonstration project compare novel long-acting starch , Glycosade , hydrothermally process high amylopectin maize starch , versus gastrostomy tube-dextrose infusion maintain euglycaemia overnight child GSD-I . Glycosade report increase duration euglycaemia . Its slow release long period normal blood sugar achieve would preclude need overnight dextrose infusion eliminate need surgical insertion gastrostomy tube purpose . Glycosade also reportedly cause few gastrointestinal side effect , thus potentially improve compliance therapy . The investigator intend evaluate Glycosade patient determine efficacy glucose control , length normoglycemia achieve determine reduce side effect patient GSD-I . This accomplished open label study Glycosade GSD-I patient consent protocol .</brief_summary>
