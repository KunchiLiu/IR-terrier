	<brief_title>Does Using 'Virtual Clinic ' Urogynaecology Improve Patient Experience Reduce Cost ?</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>ePAQ web-based interactive questionnaire ( electronic pelvic floor assessment questionnaire ) provide detailed evaluation woman 's pelvic floor symptom impact quality life . Touch-screen technology combine computer programming ( Dot Net &amp; SQL Server ) exist paper-based instrument produce interactive user-friendly system facilitate immediate data entry , analysis storage . The instrument evolve several year ' collaborative work colleague range discipline , include Gynaecology , Medical Physics , Colorectal Surgery , Urology General Practice , well involve woman 's health user-group regular survey patient ' views.1 Research primary secondary care establish psychometric property instrument.2 The system National award innovation ( HITEA ) cite Lord Warner 's Annual Report NHS Innovation.3 EPAQ Systems Ltd one first NHS spin-out technology company establish UK ( create jointly Sheffield Teaching Hospitals NHS Trust November 2006 ) . More recent development work result creation website , subject securely anonymously access use ePAQ system via Internet . This potentially allow subject use system advance clinic appointment ( oppose current practice complete arrival clinic , immediately prior appointment ) . This study aim evaluate impact use ePAQ way may efficiency quality patient care . Initial survey data suggest many woman attend urogynaecology clinic access Internet would willing use system on-line &amp; advance clinic appointments.4 The facility also available Gynaecology Unit woman without Internet access attend specifically supervise use system . The in-depth assessment provide ePAQ may use support initial telephone consultation clinician , follow patient may direct appropriate clinic , well provide information advice form treatment initiate ( behavioural therapy ) . The propose randomise study aim compare outcome woman use ePAQ system way woman undergo standard care Urogynaecology Unit . The major advantage electronic system , compare paper questionnaire , relate practicality clinical data capture . Electronic questionnaire comparable term reliability superior term efficiency response rate . In addition , electronic touch-screen questionnaire show acceptable patient , regardless age educational background . Data quality high , even disadvantage technophobic subject cost analysis show potential economic advantages.5,6,7,8,9 Pelvic floor disorder woman , incontinence prolapse , share common aetiology commonly coexist . Estimates vary , though estimate approximately 20 % adult woman experience regular urinary incontinence , 5 % incontinence faeces 11 % suffer prolapse.10,11,12 However , despite good understanding condition , bowel , bladder , vaginal sexual dysfunction remain understandably taboo subject many woman still regard inevitable consequence childbirth age . The personal cost individual high , however simple effective treatment increasingly available . Many disorder respond well behavioural , physical medical therapy conservative treatment generally recommend prior consideration invasive investigation surgery.13 In clinical practice , clinical assessment central diagnosis management restoration function , view improve quality life , principal aim treatment . It well recognise clinical interview data may unreliable , base clinician ' rather patient ' view condition . It seem appropriate therefore , seek way improve clinical assessment order enhance quality care reliably measure outcome . Many woman pelvic floor disorder manage community GPs , nurse , physiotherapist continence nurse advisor . In secondary tertiary care , urologist , gynaecologist , colorectal surgeon geriatrician likely involve . However , level , inconsistency clinical assessment represent impediment effective communication multidisciplinary approach advocate DoH , 2000 recommend following : - Full assessment lead first line treatment primary care set , treatment &amp; management plan agree individual patient . - The provision integrate continence service , bring together agree protocol procedure primary , secondary tertiary care . - A comprehensive continence service , home home , bring together relevant health discipline . The development ePAQ potential substantially augment process use on-line assessment support patient ' initial management triage . Using ePAQ advance clinic appointment may provide patient clinician prompt valuable information assist direct patient appropriate clinic primary secondary care . However , development warrant scrutiny term patient experience cost . The ePAQ establish part standard care routine use Sheffield Urogynaecology Unit . All new patient give opportunity complete questionnaire , online , home print result use inform subsequent clinical consultation . The aim research measure impact use virtual clinic ( ePAQ-PF advance clinic appointment + telephone consultation ) patient care cost compare standard care ( ePAQ-PF advance clinic appointment + face face consultation ) .</detailed_description>
