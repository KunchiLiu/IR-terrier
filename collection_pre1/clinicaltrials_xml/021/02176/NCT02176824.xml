	<brief_title>Chronotherapy Randomized Controlled Trial</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>There consistently report , rapid antidepressant response single night total sleep deprivation unipolar , bipolar depression . The clinical utility technique limit however , responder typically relapse rapidly follow recovery sleep . The addition pharmacotherapy , sleep phase advance ( shift earlier sleep schedule normalization three day ) , bright light therapy sleep deprivation demonstrate efficacy prevent relapse depression . Combined total sleep deprivation , sleep phase advance , bright light therapy , dub Triple Chronotherapy along concomitant pharmacotherapy demonstrate rapid improvement depressive symptom remain durable long 9 week post intervention . If early , encouraging result Triple Chronotherapy hold study , technique represent near ideal inpatient treatment , inexpensive , relatively easy carry , minimal side effect . Despite encourage early result , one publish report attempt use triple chronotherapy suicidal patient , trial bipolar depress patient include , one single variation chronotherapy test ( Three night sleep deprivation every night three light therapy session , combine lithium ) . The lack data acutely suicidal patient significantly limit utility intervention United States , non-suicidal patient admit . Published trial point also exclude comorbid illness , also limit clinical usefulness intervention minority patient . Furthermore sparse randomize adequately control trial , still limited durability data technique . We recently explore tolerability feasibility technique acutely depress suicidal inpatient admit inpatient unit encouraging result . We subsequently propose explore utility technique pilot effect compare active sham condition determine study indicate . Should study warrant , hope use collect pilot data determine necessary number participant detect effect .</detailed_description>
