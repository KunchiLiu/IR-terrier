	<brief_summary>It previously show [ 18F ] Fluorodopa ( FDOPA ) PET image result intend management change 41 % brain tumor patient . However , impact patient outcome define survival , cost , and/or quality life demonstrate . Regulatory agency require randomized trial determine impact PET patient management outcome . In study hypothesize addition FDOPA PET improve patient outcome accurately identify presence absence tumor recurrence conventional imaging .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Response Monitoring Trial Patients With Suspected Recurrence Glioblastoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Malignant glioma aggressive primary brain tumor almost always lead rapid patient deterioration death . Timely diagnosis recurrent disease well accurate monitoring therapeutic response critically important glioblastoma patient . Despite introduction new treatment approach patient prognosis poor less half patient progression-free first 6 month diagnosis disease recurrence ( 6-month-progression-free survival rate 46 % ) . The current diagnostic standard care diagnose monitoring brain tumor contrast-enhanced , multi-planar magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) . However , ability MRI early detection disease recurrence progression limit . Moreover , determination treatment responses difficult since benign tissue change radiation and/or chemotherapy appearance tumor recurrence progression MRI . Positron emission tomography ( PET ) establish image technique utilizes small amount radioactivity attach minimal amount substance ( tracer ) inject via hand arm vein . These substance track certain feature cancer visualize use PET-CT scanner . For instance , number different PET-tracers use study brain tumor metabolism detect primary recurrent tumor . These include tracer glucose ( [ 18F ] FDG ) amino acid metabolism ( e.g. , [ 11C ] methionine [ 18F ] FDOPA ) . Metabolic image brain tumor amino acid analogue advantage FDG . Since FDG ass glucose metabolism normal brain consumes lot glucose difficult detect tumor high glucose use normal brain tissue . FDOPA successfully use clinically many year . The advantage FDOPA normal brain tissue consume little FDOPA . Thus , tumor see easily low background activity . FDOPA PET image detects brain tumor high accuracy affect management 40 % patient . However , impact patient outcome define survival , cost , and/or quality life demonstrate . Randomized trial need evaluate impact PET patient management outcome . We determine randomize patient suspect recurrence glioblastoma manage use conventional diagnostic image versus receive conventional imaging plus FDOPA PET . Randomization like flip coin . Patients 50 % chance undergo standard image standard imaging combine FDOPA PET . Approximately 25-40 % patient suspected tumor recurrence pseudo-progression MRI ( i.e. , image suggest tumor recurrence fact recurrence ) . These patient correctly negative FDOPA PET scan . In patient initiation treatment postpone . In contrast , patient positive FDOPA PET scan undergo kind treatment discretion treat physician ( radiation therapy , chemotherapy surgery ) . We find whether management treatment change base FDOPA PET affect survival patient affect cost care patient .</detailed_description>
