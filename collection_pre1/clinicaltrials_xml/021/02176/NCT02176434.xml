	<brief_summary>This pilot study combine kidney hematopoietic stem cell transplantation attempt establish protocol induce immunological tolerance new strategy prevent renal graft rejection . If successful , strategy would restore renal function , avoid risk associate long-term standard anti-rejection therapy , would represent first option cure end-stage renal disease .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Pilot Feasibility Study Combined Kidney Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation Cure End-stage Renal Disease</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Trial design This open-label feasibility study combine Human Leukocyte Antigen ( HLA ) -matched sibling hematopoietic stem cell kidney transplantation . The study perform University Hospital Zurich . The pilot study include 5 donor 5 recipient . We expect 4 5 recipient immunosuppressive therapy 6-12 month . Study protocol 1 . Non-study-specific intervention transplantation Donor recipient screen accord establish internal guideline live donor kidney hematopoietic stem cell transplantation Transplantation Center University Hospital Zurich . 2 . Study-specific intervention transplantation - Potential candidate inform study treat physician . Interested patient inform detail study protocol , potential benefit risk . The patient sufficient time decide participate study undergo standard transplantation , read sing informed consent form . - Total lymphoid irradiation : optimal planning total lymphoid irradiation , map CT perform 2-4 week therapy repeat day 1 kidney transplantation . - Blood draw establishment chimerism determination . - The recipient undergo one leukapheresis procedure start condition regimen order bank cell future scientific study . - Stem cell mobilization isolation donor leukapheresis perform accord standard protocol Stem cell transplantation center University Hospital Zurich - Donor-derived hematopoietic progenitor cell isolated peripheral leukocyte positive selection ( CD34+ cell ) use Magnetic-Activated Cell Sorting ( MACS ) technology accord SOPs certify hematology laboratory University Children 's Hospital Zurich . CD34 negative cell analyze Fluorescence-Activated Cell Sorting ( FACS ) determine amount CD3 positive cell . Stem cell flow frozen transplant accord standard operating procedure ( SOP ) stem cell transplantation center University Hospital Zurich . - Since irradiation might reduce fertility possibility sperm conservation transplantation offer male recipient . 3 . Induction protocol - Kidney transplantation ( day 0 ) - A CT scan perform day 1 transplantation correct definitive plan irradiation protocol . - Immunosuppression : first week kidney transplantation recipient treat standard immunosuppression , include methylprednisolone , prednisone , mycophenolate mofetil cyclosporine A . - Additionally patient treat : Rabbit anti-thymocyte globulin ( ATG ) : Thymoglobuline® 1.5 mg per kg ; 5 daily injection day 0 day 4 . Total lymphoid irradiation : 10 dos 120 centigray ( cGy ) ( total dose 12 Gy ) supradiaphragmatic lymph node , thymus , subdiaphragmatic lymph node spleen ; 10 daily dos day 1 day 11 . • Hematopoietic stem cell transplantation ( day 11 kidney transplantation ) : Infusion isolate CD34+ hematopoietic progenitor cell ( ≥10x10^6 cells/kg ) Additionally patient receive 1x10^6 CD3+ T cell / kg body weight CD34- fraction promote engraftment hematopoietic progenitor cell ( T cell add-back ) 4 . Immunosuppression anti-microbial prophylaxis - Methylprednisolone : steroid rapidly taper first day transplantation . All patient steroid day 14 . - Mycophenolate mofetil : 2 g per day , start day 11 ( 4 6 hour stem cell transplantation ) discontinue 1 month stem cell transplantation . - Cyclosporine A : First 3 month : whole blood level ( C0 ) 250-300 µg/ml Month 3-6 : cyclosporine taper discontinue 6 month follow criterion fulfil : - Sustained chimerism least 180 day - No clinical sign rejection - Protocol biopsy show evidence acute chronic rejection - No clinical sign graft versus host disease - Anti-microbial prophylaxis : Amoxicillin/clavulanic acid 2.2 g preoperatively Sulfamethoxazole/Trimethoprim 6 month Valganciclovir : ) low risk ( D-R- ) - prophylaxis ; b ) intermediate risk ( R+ ) - prophylaxis valganciclovir 450mg daily , start 1 month post transplant ; c ) high risk ( D+R- ) - prophylaxis valganciclovir 450mg daily , start immediately transplantation . 5 Post-operative monitoring - Donor recipient follow life-long outpatient clinic nephrology division accord local practice . During immunosuppression taper first month immunosuppression renal function closely monitor early detection rejection episode . Therefore , participate study patient agree weekly creatinine testing , might also perform patient 's family doctor . - Graft versus host disease monitor clinically regular visit well measurement liver function test . - The donor include control program stem cell donor live kidney donor regular transplant procedure ( national registry live kidney stem cell donor ) - Chimerism level peripheral blood regularly assess - Kidney allograft biopsy perform 6 month ( withdraw cyclosporine A ) 1 year transplantation - Immune reconstitution analyze FACS peripheral blood leukocytes additional functional assay vitro . - Functional immunological tolerance measure vitro assay 1 , 2 , 6 , 12 , 18 24 month . These additional test scientific interest , influence clinical patient management . - Quality life assess routinely perform context Swiss transplant cohort study ( www.stcs.ch ) - Regular monitoring cancer development do conventional transplantation ( skin cancer , breast cancer , prostate cancer ) . Duration subject participation follow-up The active portion trial begin approximately 2 month prior transplantation continue 2 year post-transplant . Study-related data collect minimum 2 year post-transplant . All subject follow indefinitely graft patient survival routine clinical follow-up .</detailed_description>
