	<brief_summary>Ferric pyrophosphate ( FePP ) water-insoluble , food grade iron compound use fortify rice , infant cereal chocolate-drink powder cause organoleptic change food vehicle . However , low absorption man . Therefore , strategy enhance bioavailability FePP , add citrate decrease particle size FePP need investigate . The primary objective present study : 1 ) test whether presence citrate iron fortify rice FePP result higher iron bioavailability , 2 ) test whether presence citrate rice grain extrusion cook process result higher iron bioavailability compare iron-fortified rice citrate add shortly consumption . As secondary objective investigator compare absorption different FePP combination reference meal fortify ferrous sulphate . The investigator hypothesize addition citrate enhances iron absorption positive effect great citrate add extrusion . The investigator conduct iron absorption study 20 woman , 18 45 year old evaluate iron bioavailability extrude rice fortify 1 ) regular FePP , 2 ) regular FePP citrate ( extruded rice kernel ) , 3 ) regular FePP citrate add time consumption , 4 ) normal rice fortify ferrous sulphate time consumption . Iron absorption measure erythrocyte incorporation stable iron isotope least 14 day administration isotopically label test meal . The iron absorption different meal within participant compare repeated-measures ANOVA follow Bonferroni correct pairwise comparison . The present study provide important data iron bioavailability rice accurately directly measure use stable isotopic label absorption tracer . This direct data use base decision level fortification , potentially reduce cost optimize iron delivery target population iron fortification program .</brief_summary>
