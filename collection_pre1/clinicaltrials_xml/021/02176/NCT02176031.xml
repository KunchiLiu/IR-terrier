	<brief_summary>This research study Phase II clinical trial , test safety effectiveness investigational drug Natalizumab treat Acute Graft versus Host Disease Gastrointestinal Tract .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Phase II Trial Natalizumab ( Tysabri® ) Plus Prednisone Initial Therapy Acute Graft Versus Host Disease ( aGVHD ) Gastrointestinal Tract</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Natalizumab drug initially discover treatment autoimmune condition . Natalizumab approve use patient Multiple Sclerosis Crohn 's disease . In disease , drug work inhibit dysfunctional immune cell responsible symptom see disease . Acute graft versus host disease cause similar dysfunction immune cell ; Natalizumab think inhibit immune cell , similarly Multiple Sclerosis Crohn 's disease . In research study , investigator look see whether Natalizumab provide additional benefit patient receive standard treatment acute graft versus host disease gastrointestinal tract . Participants fulfill eligibility criterion enter trial receive Natalizumab . - Participant receive dose natalizumab intravenous infusion . Participants may receive second dose Day 28 experience partial response good partial response . - Scheduled Physical Examination screening , week first dose 28 day , 56 day , 100 day , 180 day one year .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Participants must meet follow criterion screen examination eligible participate study : Participants must acute GVHD low gastrointestinal tract define clinical impression treat physician , require systemic treatment . Minimum criterion GI GVHD include diarrhea great 500 mL/day . Biopsy GI tract require study entry must confirm diagnosis acute GVHD . Stool sample rule infectious cause diarrhea , include norovirus , Clostridium difficile clinically indicated infection must also negative . Eligibility include : Acute GVHD develop allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation ( HSCT ) use bone marrow , peripheral blood stem cell , umbilical cord blood . Recipients nonmyeloablative , reduced intensity myeloablative transplant eligible . Patients develop acute GVHD donor lymphocyte infusion ( DLI ) eligible . There specified time window day 0 transplant acute GVHD define clinical manifestation . Patients must experience neutrophil engraftment HSCT define absolute neutrophil count ≥ 500 / µL × 3 consecutive measurement . Absolute neutrophil count ( ANC ) calculate use standard formula ( Neut + Bands ) ( WBC × 101 ) . The presence hepatic , upper GI and/or cutaneous acute GVHD permit . Steroids start 7 day prior administration natalizumab . Age ≥ 18 Ability understand willingness sign write informed consent document . Exclusion Criteria Participants exhibit follow condition screen eligible admission study : Patients entity Acute/Chronic GVHD overlap syndromes . Requiring mechanical ventilation Vasopressor requirement Concurrent hepatic venoocclusive disease ( VOD ) base clinical examination Karnofsky performance status &lt; 30 Participants may receive study agent least 7 day prior enrollment Prior use natalizumab reason allow Pregnant woman exclude study potential teratogenic effect natalizumab . Because natalizumab enters breast milk , effect unknown infant , breastfeed discontinue mother treated natalizumab .</criteria>
