	<brief_summary>Non Small Cell Lung Cancer ( NSCLC ) represent first cancer relate cause death worldwide 1.4 million deaths every year . Current standard therapy include platinum-containing drug one year diagnosis survival rate still low ( 30-40 % ) . The purpose study evaluate role platinum-free drug , name Vinorelbine , administer call `` metronomic schedule '' order prolong progression free survival patient .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Maintenance Low Dose Oral Navelbine In Patients With Non Small Cell Lung Cancer - MA.NI.LA Trial</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Systemic therapy remain mainstay treatment advance stage NSCLC . Combination chemotherapy platinum-based regimen emerge standard therapy patient advanced stage disease . Observations support finding several clinical trial , establish notion efficacy plateau reach advanced stage NSCLC patient treat platinum-containing drug . Recent phase III trial suggest benefit `` switch '' `` continue '' maintenance treatment different drug . As `` switch therapy '' , Vinorelbine select base anti-mitotic role . In fact , use anti-mitotic drug low dose high frequency ( metronomic schedule ) seem augment anti-angiogenetic effect kind drug , thus augment efficacy therapy . Therefore , purpose current study evaluate role `` switch maintenance '' oral vinorelbine administer metronomic schedule term Progression Free Survival ( PFS ) advance NSCLC patient stable disease first line platinum base chemotherapy .</detailed_description>
