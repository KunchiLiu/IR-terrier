	<brief_summary>As validated tool assess patient report outcome health relate quality life idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis ( IPF ) , different study utilise different method . This mean comparison outcome study difficult inaccurate . By collect different quality life tool patient report outcome time , possible map model result one tool group tool onto another . 250 patient IPF ask complete EuroQoL 5D , Kings Brief Interstitial Lung Disease questionnaire , St George 's Respiratory Questionnaire , MRC dyspnoea scale , University California , San Diego shortness breath questionnaire Hospital Anxiety Depression Scale , along spirometry every 3 month , undergo 6 minute walk test every 6 month , 12 month period . Prognostic model construct clinical ( questionnaire function ) measure linear regression model .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>There validate accept tool assess health relate quality life ( HRQOL ) dyspnoea patient idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis ( IPF ) accept recommended tool assess patient report outcomes clinical trial patient IPF . Assessment outcomes important patient may consider crucial outcome measure intervention IPF . With mind , majority recently report randomised clinical study IPF evaluate HRQOL dyspnoea , commonly secondary outcome , achieve different tool . For example Capacity study ( 1 ) utilise St George 's Respiratory Questionnaire whereas ASCEND ( Efficacy Safety Pirfenidone Patients With Idiopathic Pulmonary Fibrosis ) ( http : //clinicaltrial.gov/ct2/show/NCT01366209 ) study currently assess dyspnoea use University California , San Diego shortness breath questionnaire . As method directly compare HRQOL different clinical evaluation IPF , desperate need produce algorithms relate different outcome measure IPF . The St George 's Respiratory Questionnaire ( 2 ) commonly utilised tool trial IPF ( 3-5 ) . Although relates physiological impairment IPF ( 6 ) , develop patient Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease ( COPD ) therefore lack content validity . An abbreviated version ( SGRQ-I ) contain question relevant IPF therefore develop validate ( 7 ) . The Kings Brief Interstitial Lung disease ( K-BILD ) questionnaire recently validate tool patient interstitial lung disease specifically idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis ( 8 ) utilise multicentre study measure treatment intervention IPF . The EuroQol 5D ( EQ5D ) well-validated global health status instrument design use clinical health-economic trial ( 9 ) . This validated chronic respiratory disease use several study ( 4 , 5 , 10 ) . In term assess dyspnoea , study utilise University California , San Diego ( UCSD ) shortness breath questionnaire ( SOBQ ) ( 4 , 11 ) , medicine research council ( MRC ) dyspnoea score ( 5 ) , transition dyspnoea index ( 12 ) . The investigator conduct brief mapping exercise base data patient randomise placebo arm Treating idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis addition co-trimoxazole ( TIPAC ) study ( 5 ) . The SGRQ data map onto EQ5D data use pair data individual time point addition demographic lung function data ( unpublished ) . This mapping exercise produce equation great predictive strength use data COPD patient show model algorithms disease specific information share different respiratory condition . The investigator wish undertake large study generate accurate model approximate EQ5D also explore relationship patient report outcome measure . It undertaking work , result individual study compare .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Age great 40 year . IPF base multidisciplinary follow review clinical history , thoracic high resolution compute tomography ( HRCT ) and/or usual interstitial pneumonia ( UIP ) histology confirm surgical lung biopsy consensus accord international guideline . Patients may receive oral prednisolone dose 10 mg per day , antioxidant therapy pirfenidone study entry . A recognised significant coexist respiratory disease , define respiratory condition exhibit clinically relevant effect respiratory symptom disease progression determine principal investigator follow multidisciplinary discussion . For example , patient bronchiectasis include bronchiectasis deem traction bronchiectasis result idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis . Airflow obstruction define FEV1/FVC &lt; 60 % predict residual volume great 120 % predict . Significant medical , surgical psychiatric disease opinion patient 's attending physician would exhibit clinically relevant effect patient 's health relate quality life .
