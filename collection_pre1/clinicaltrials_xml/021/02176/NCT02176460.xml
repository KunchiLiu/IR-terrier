	<brief_summary>Uric acid may involve activation innate immune response osteoarthritis ( OA ) pathology progression . This suggest traditional gout therapy may beneficial OA . Our goal therefore assess colchicine , exist commercially available agent gout , new therapeutic indication-knee OA . The investigator propose randomized clinical trial ( RCT ) 16 week ' therapy standard daily dose oral colchicine placebo knee OA . The investigator hypothesize colchicine block inflammasome mediate inflammation , thereby improve sign symptom OA , reduce synovial fluid , serum urine inflammatory biochemical joint degradation biomarkers . This trial potentially provide data support new treatment option knee OA .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>In knee OA cohort clinical evidence self-report gout , The investigator recently find significant correlation synovial fluid uric acid radiographic scintigraphic measure OA severity [ 1 ] . The investigator also observe strong correlation OA severity ( radiographically scintigraphically determine ) synovial fluid uric acid synovial fluid Interleukin ( IL ) -18 IL-1β ; two cytokine classically produce gout attack innate immune system activation mediate uric acid crystal-induced inflammasome assembly macrophage . These result strongly support involvement uric acid innate immune system OA pathology progression . Whereas gout flare , uric acid crystal form trigger innate immune response , suspect OA , uric acid microcrystalline particulate form pathogenic agent -- able trigger innate immune response ; lead release inflammatory cytokine like IL-18 , IL-1β subsequently tumor necrosis factor - α perpetuate cartilage degradation . This new conception pathogenesis OA important treatment implication ; suggest exist therapy gout may benefit OA . Colchicine may effective treatment OA due capacity suppress innate immune response various level . At micromolar concentration colchicine suppresses activation crystal-induced ( NACHT ) , ( LRR ) ( PYD ) domains contain protein-3 ( NALP3 ) inflammasome ; IL-1β processing release ; L-selectin expression neutrophil [ 2 ] . At nanomolar concentration colchicine block release crystal-derived chemotactic factor neutrophil lysosome ; block neutrophil adhesion endothelium modulate distribution adhesion molecules endothelial cell ; inhibits urate crystal-induced production superoxide anion neutrophil macrophage . The pain symptom relieving effect colchicine knee OA demonstrate three small well-performed human randomize control trial [ 3-5 ] ; however , mechanism action colchicine OA never evaluate . The investigator therefore propose RCT colchicine examine effect sign symptom knee OA evaluate mechanism action analysis synovial fluid systemic biomarker profile . Hypothesis : The investigator hypothesize colchicine block inflammasome mediate inflammation , thereby improve sign symptom OA , reduce synovial fluid serum urine inflammatory biochemical joint degradation biomarkers . Aim 1 . To determine whether daily oral colchicine standard clinical dos ( 0.5 mg two time daily ) , compare placebo , decrease pain symptomatic OA knee improve function use adjunctive daily therapy addition background therapy patient 's current stable analgesic regimen . Aim 2 . To evaluate mechanism action colchicine reduce knee OA sign symptoms analyse synovial fluid , serum , urine biomarker profile - interrogate characterize state activation joint metabolism ( joint degradation synthesis marker ) , inflammatory mediator , innate immune system NALP3 inflammasome component specifically ( baseline ) 16 week therapy ( study end ) oral colchicine versus placebo treatment . This pilot phase II study use double-blinded , randomize , placebo , control design . Patients symptomatic radiographic knee OA ( n=120 ) randomize colchicine ( SIN 12490P ) 0.5 mg bid ( n=60 ) placebo ( n=60 ) daily 16 week . Patients permit remain baseline adjunctive therapy , include non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug ( NSAIDs ) without change duration study . They also allow use paracetamol 2 g/day rescue analgesia pill count end study conduct determine amount rescue medicine utilized course 16-week study .</detailed_description>
