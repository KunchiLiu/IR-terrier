	<brief_title>Ethnicity Onset Cardiovascular Disease : A CALIBER Study</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>There evidence epidemiological study different ethnic group associate increased incidence specific cardiovascular disease . However , majority exist study examine association one two acute condition stroke coronary heart disease focus particular ethnic group . The aim study examine differ association four ethnic group initial lifetime presentation broad range cardiovascular disease , include chronic presentation stable angina . The hypothesis heterogeneity association different ethnic group full range cardiovascular disease study . The study use data CALIBER data set clinically collect electronic health record data England . This study part CALIBER ( Cardiovascular disease research use link bespoke study electronic record ) programme fund 5 year National Institute Health Research ( NIHR ) Wellcome Trust . The central theme CALIBER research linkage Myocardial Ischaemia National Audit Project ( MINAP ) primary care ( Clinical Practice Research Datalink - CPRD ) resource . The overarch aim CALIBER good understand aetiology prognosis specific coronary phenotype across range causal domain , particularly electronic record provide contribution beyond traditional study . CALIBER receive Ethics approval ( ref 09/H0810/16 ) ECC approval ( ref ECC 2-06 ( b ) /2009 CALIBER data set ) .</detailed_description>
