	<brief_summary>Study Hypotheses : 1 . Anaemia , frequent conception well early pregnancy , affect metabolism foetal growth trajectory , influence risk NCDs offspring . 2 . Anaemia conception till end 2nd trimester detrimental foetal newborn ' health , compare 3rd trimester anaemia . 3 . Anaemia conception till end 2nd trimester affect foetal newborn health poor placental development reflect increased villous branch change umbilical uterine blood flow . 4 . Anaemia early pregnancy disrupts vascular endothelial growth factor A ( VEGF-A ) /placental growth factor ( PlGF ) balance insulin-like growth factor ( IGF ) axis result poor placental development , poor health newborn . This may reflect specific methylation pattern . 5 . Anaemia 's impact risk NCDs offspring may mediate via epigenetic mechanism , include change DNA methylation pattern .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Specific objective : 1 . Characterize health woman age 18-40 year conception pregnancy , focus prevalence anaemia , infection , nutritional status , Non-Communicable Diseases ( NCDs ) . 2 . Describe 1st 2nd trimester anaemia compare 3rd trimester anaemia alters foetal growth newborn ' body composition . 3 . Evaluate 1st 2nd trimester anaemia compare 3rd trimester anaemia affect villous branch placenta , well uterine umbilical artery blood flow . 4 . Characterize 1st , 2nd 3rd trimester anaemia differentially change vascular endothelial growth factor A ( VEGF-A ) /placental growth factor ( PlGF ) balance insulin-like growth factor axis . 5 . Determine marker foetal programming methylation regulatory gene relate metabolism haematopoiesis may discover early exposure anaemia in1st 2nd trimester compare 3rd trimester anaemia . Outcome parameter pre-pregnancy study ( . ) : 1 ) Prevalence severity anaemia among non-pregnant Tanzanian woman fertile age nutritional status . 2 ) Incidence conception among woman . Outcome parameter pregnancy study ( ii . ) : 1 ) Foetal growth rate 2nd 3rd trimester offspring anaemic mother vs Foetal growth rate non-anaemic mother ' offspring , 2 ) Comparison anaemic mother ' v non-anaemic mother ' newborn 's body composition , placental villous branching , umbilical uterine blood flow , VEGF-A/PlGF level , insulin-like growth factor axis . For analysis main exposure variable anaemia ( Hb &lt; 5mmol/L ) 1st , 2nd and/or3rd trimester pregnancy . Confounding exposure variable chronic health condition ( e.g . HIV ) , temporary condition mention ( e.g . malaria ) well socioeconomic status paternal characteristic . Regression model use multiple linear logistic regression well model repeat measure use statistical analysis . For genetic epigenetic change , finding subgroup 180 other/newborns , remain significant correction multiple comparison , validate remain cohort . This enable u within one study replicate initial finding one representative distinct subgroup another large comparable study group overall homogenous study . Indeed , finding survive correction multiple test initial hypothesis generate array approach , well replicate remain study group single target validation technique , highly likely biological important . Possible finding candidate gene approach correct multiple test significant result compare previous finding gene study muscle adipose tissue conduct Diabetes Metabolism , Copenhagen University Hospital .</detailed_description>
