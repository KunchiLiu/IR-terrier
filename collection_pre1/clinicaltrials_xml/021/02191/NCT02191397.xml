	<brief_summary>This multi-centre study follow randomise , double-blind , parallel-group , active-controlled design evaluate efficacy , safety tolerability bupropion extended-release ( XL ) ( 300 mg/day ) compare escitalopram ( 10-20 mg/day ) outpatients inpatient major depressive disorder ( MDD ) . The total duration study 11 week consist three phase . The screening phase ( phase I ) last 0-14 day , subject randomise bupropion XL escitalopram 1:1 ratio acute phase treatment phase ( phase II ) 8 week . There 3 dose level acute treatment phase . The 3-dose level plan design ensure drug titrate accord prescribe information reach optimal clinical dose . Finally patient enter taper phase ( phase III ) 1 week ass reduce possible withdrawal symptom . In China almost exist antidepressant available market , bupropion XL yet approve . This Phase III clinical trial use purpose register bupropion XL China .</brief_summary>
