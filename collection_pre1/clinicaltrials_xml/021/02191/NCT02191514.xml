	<detailed_description>Background : Approximately 12.000 stroke occur Denmark annually . The evidence base pharmacological treatment ischemic stroke thrombolysis within time-window 4.5 hour symptom onset ( 1 ) . In 2012 , 12 % patient ischemic stroke Denmark receive thrombolysis treatment . The probability favourable 3-month outcome stroke decrease time symptom onset thrombolysis : onset needle time ( 2 ) . Therefore , high importance identify potential target prehospital time reduction , thereby reduce delay definitive care . Prompt recognition stroke symptom EMD ambulance personnel crucial step , provide access fast track acute stroke service . In context , role EMS essential , contact hospital EMS oppose private transport correlate decreased onset-to-door time ( 3 ) . EMS prenotification stroke centre correlate short door-to-evaluation time , door-to-needle time onset-to-needle time ( 4 ) . In Denmark EMS prenotification acute stroke well establish . According Danish guideline treatment acute stroke transient ischaemic attack ( TIA ) , prehospital diagnosis stroke improve use validated test . No yet implement Capital Region Denmark . Preliminary data show mean time ambulance personnel arrive scene start transport hospital ( `` scene time '' ) 18 minute Capital Region Denmark . American guideline suggest on-scene-time less 15 minute case ( unless extenuate circumstance extrication difficulty present ) ( 1 ) , however organisation stroke care Scandinavia USA vary largely . The aim study : 1 . To establish rate recognition stroke symptom healthcare personnel EMD , ultimately aim optimize performance , identify barrier fast correct EMS-response . 2 . To assess prehospital time consumption ambulance personnel scene stroke , create baseline future comparison generate explorative hypothesis forthcoming intervention . The study consist 3 arm : 1 . An epidemiological analysis prospectively collect data 2-year period , order establish rate identification stroke symptom healthcare personnel EMD . 2 . A quantification statistical analysis on-scene-time stroke patient , base prospectively collect data registration form fill ambulance personnel respond stroke . The focus form time spend predefined task aim assess time consumption scene , generate explorative hypothesis forthcoming intervention . 3 . Based EMS data , investigator establish baseline on-scene-time transportation time patient admit fast track stroke service 6 month period , future comparison analyse data conjunction in-hospital delay . Method arm : 1 . The epidemiological analysis base prospectively collect data Danish Stroke Registry ( DSR ) National Patient Registry ( NPR ) . In DSR NPR , ICD-10-codes link Danish personal identification number , unique number every Danish citizen . The investigator shall compare ICD-10 code DSR NPR dispatch code EMS database , determine amount diagnose stroke patient recognize emergency call . The date incident report EMS match admission date correlate discharge ICD-10 code , case patient admit . 2 . To quantify analyse prehospital time consumption , investigator develop registration form ambulance personnel fill respond stroke patient . This registration form include registration time interval spend : - Clinical task ; include prior medical history , clinical examination measurement vital parameter - Communication relation prenotification stroke centre - Mobilization patient on-scene condition - Patient preparation ; include IV-accesses 12-lead ECG As well information regarding : - Patient preparation ; include IV-accesses 12-lead ECG - Language/communication barrier - Specifications ambulance ( operator , level education ) - Patient/relative related condition - Visitation acute stroke fast track Statistical analysis : Poisson regression analysis make dispersion take account , order identify specific time interval task correlate extend decreased total on-scene-time . This model yield distribution similar previously collect data . A power calculation make , base distribution assumption clinically relevant difference , define time interval case consider high on-scene-time , ( &gt; 15 min . ) twice amount case consider low on-scene-time ( ≤15 min. ) . This show estimate demand 500 registration form order achieve power 0,8 5 % two-sided confidence interval . 3 . The establishment on-scene-times transportation-times make extract specific time point ( e.g . ambulance arrival scene , departure towards hospital arrival hospital ) EMS database 6 month period , analysed conjunction data in-hospital delay . The stroke centre provide Danish personal identification number patient refer stroke centre well door-to-needle time treatment decision order determine correlation be-tween recognition treatment decision stroke fast track patient . As prior comparable registration , impossible estimate clinically relevant difference order make power calculation determine amount necessary registration . Thus decide 6-month registration provide reliable baseline . To avoid bias , registration variable , start end registration form period . The overall aim study , ensure best possible prehospital care stroke patient . The study determine , EMD high international level regard stroke recognition , potential decrease on-scene time . This serve future comparison effect structure future education prehospital service , potentially improve outcome acute ischemic stroke .
