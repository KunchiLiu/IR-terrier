	<brief_summary>This study open-label , multi-center , phase 1 , dose escalation study phase 2 expansion cohort determine safety , pharmacokinetics preliminary anti-tumor activity intravenous TKM-080301 subject advance hepatocellular carcinoma ( HCC ) . This study do : - Test safety tolerability TKM-080301 subject advance hepatocellular carcinoma - Find high dose TKM-080301 give without cause side effect , call maximum tolerate dose ( MTD ) . - Provide preliminary assessment anti-tumor activity TKM-080301</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Study design : Open label , multi-center , 3 + 3 dose-escalation study expansion cohort maximum tolerate dose ( MTD ) investigate safety , tolerability , PK , preliminary anti-tumor activity TKM 080301 subject HCC . Sequential cohorts 3 6 subject receive escalate dos TKM 080301 accord pre-specified dose escalation scheme . Assessment dose-limiting toxicity ( DLTs ) make Cycle 1 determine maximum tolerate dose ( MTD ) . Once MTD level establish , approximately 20 subject enrolled expansion cohort confirm safety tolerability TKM-080301 MTD . Study Population : A minimum 9 approximately 18 adult male female subject histologically cytologically confirm metastatic locally advanced inoperable HCC life expectancy 3 month plan dose escalation phase . Approximately 20 subject plan expansion cohort . Study Treatment : TKM-080301 administer intravenous ( IV ) infusion , weekly 3 consecutive week follow 1 week rest period . This 28-day treatment period constitute 1 cycle . Subjects demonstrate clinical benefit without progression per RECIST 1.1 guideline may receive treatment beyond 6 cycle Investigator consider best interest subject , approval Medical Monitor . Subjects would continue TKM 080301 therapy withdrawal consent , disease progression unacceptable toxicity occur . Pharmacokinetics ( PK ) Subjects undergo blood sample collection PK analysis cycle 1 2 . Study Duration : Each treatment cycle duration 28 day subject typically receive 6 cycle treatment . The total duration study expect approximately 28 month .</detailed_description>
