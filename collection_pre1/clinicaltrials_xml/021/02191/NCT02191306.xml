	<brief_summary>Utilizing Computed Tomographic Angiography Evaluate Coronary Artery Disease Patients Long-Term Antiretroviral Therapy Intro : It well know HIV treat antiretroviral drug increase risk coronary artery disease . Studies document various method include analyze effect retroviral therapy cardiac risk factor diabetes , lipids hypertension . Still study look carotid brachial artery intimal thickness . Our study , , aim evaluate relationship HIV medication coronary atherosclerosis use novel method . Coronary artery CT angiography relatively new diagnostic procedure evaluate heart disease cardiac patient . We apply test HIV patient longstanding antiretroviral therapy directly examine coronary artery ass heart disease . Hypothesis : We hypothesize HIV patient antiretroviral therapy increase coronary artery disease compare general population . Methods : This project conduct collaboration Florida Heart Center Associates infectious Disease - two community base infectious disease cardiology practice . We identify HIV positive patient see within 1 month timeframe infectious disease office . These patient filter exclusion/inclusion criterion . After obtain informed consent , draw blood patient gather lab value A1C , cholesterol , inflammatory marker , marker associate coronary artery disease . Each enrol patient schedule receive 64 slide coronary CTA Florida Heart Center . The result CTA scan categorize mild , moderate , severe coronary artery disease . The data , , consist parameter measure blood work , result coronary CTA . Inclusion Criteria : 1 . Patients age 35 50 HIV retroviral therapy least 5 year . Exclusion Criteria : 1 . Patients prior document coronary artery disease , heart attack , stent placement , heart surgery . Statistical Analysis : We conduct multivariate analysis cardiac risk factor take patient history bloodwork ( diabetes , lipid etc ) correlate result CTA . We also conduct basic analysis support hypothesis long term antiretroviral therapy increase coronary artery disease . Funding : The bloodwork CTA test order study pay insurance company available . In case insurance company pay , Florida Heart Center pay CTA test Associates infectious Disease fund bloodwork . Humans Subjects Protection : This projective chart review study require access protect health information . Thus , seek full IRB approval FSU IRB committee inform consent . An informed consent document give patient explain risk benefit study addition method . Recruitment do office staff medical assistant research team . After patient recruitment , medical record flag study undergo require testing . At completion test , result record final data sheet , medical record longer flag study . No identify data record final data sheet , data store encrypted excel sheet secure password protect personal laptop run antivirus firewall . Third party ( family member ) access research data regardless authorization receive study subject . All test result labwork perform study go patient 's individual medical record respective office . Thus , authorized third party wish view test result , via normal method doctor 's office .</brief_summary>
