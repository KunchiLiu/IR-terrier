	<brief_summary>Vitiligo autoimmune cutaneous disorder destroy melanocyte lead depigmented area skin . In United States , vitiligo affect 1 % patient , cause change color skin , also significant cosmetic concern quality life issue . Current treatment modality , include topical corticosteroid , intralesional corticosteroid , phototherapy , systemic immunosuppression , variably effective induce repigmentation . Unfortunately , case vitiligo refractory treatment . There need new , effective modality treat patient otherwise refractory vitiligo . Needling office base procedure theoretically transpose healthy , pigmented skin cell depigmented area use needle vitiligo patient . Two preliminary study needle novel treatment vitiligo promise result limit small sample size subjective result . The propose randomized control trial ( RCT ) investigate use needle treat vitiligo . It differ previous study seek identify cause clinical benefit compare needle alone needle corticosteroid , examine large number patient , quantifies improvement use confocal microscopy . Confocal microscopy ( CFM ) allow non-invasive visualization skin cellular level use past diagnose cutaneous pigmentary condition . This study would first RCT needle vitiligo use objective measure quantify result , thus potential establish needle novel , effective treatment vitiligo evaluate utility CFM monitoring response treatment .</brief_summary>
