	<detailed_description>Acute urticaria define hive persist less 6 week . Some patient acute urticaria may progress need urgent management urgent care clinic emergency room . Nonsedating H1-antihistamines represent mainstay corticosteroid various immunosuppressive therapy use severely affected patient , patient experience poor response antihistamine . However , even though already treat antihistamine , symptom still last longer 3 day 34 % patient . Efficacy omalizumab chronic spontaneous urticaria demonstrate phase II phase III study .
