	<detailed_description>3 Background The use cardiopulmonary bypass ( CPB ) cardiac surgery elicit generalize non-specific systemic inflammatory response syndrome ( SIRS ) subsequent activation cytokine , complement , coagulation-fibrinolytic cascade ( 1 ) . In approximately 11 % patient SIRS may deteriorate severe multi-organ failure ( MOF ) result mortality rate 40-98 % . Inflammatory modulation intraoperative administration anti-inflammatory substance advocate attenuate effect SIRS . Attempts subsequently focus aprotinin inhibits protease key mediator complement , coagulation , fibrinolytic system . Related anti-inflammatory property aprotinin include inhibition platelet , neutrophil kallikrein activation . Reduction blood loss reduce need allogenic blood transfusion propose additional mechanism aprotinin limit inflammatory response ( 2 ) . The use aprotinin cardiac surgery , however , discontinue follow alarm result term high rate bypass graft occlusion overall inferior postoperative outcome . AAT-1 mechanism action : Similar aprotinin , α1-Antitrypsin ( AAT ) 52-kDa circulate serine protease inhibitor classify SERPIN protein . Besides ability inhibit serine protease , accumulate data suggest AAT-1 posse independent anti-inflammatory tissue-protective effect ( 3 ) . AAT-1 modifies dendritic cell maturation promote regulatory T-cell differentiation , induces interleukin ( IL ) -1 receptor antagonist IL-10 release , protect various cell type cell death , inhibit caspases-1 -3 activity inhibit IL-1 production activity ( 4 ) . Contradictory classic immunosuppressant , AAT-1 allow undeterred isolated T-lymphocyte response ( 5 ) .These effect repeatedly corroborate . Unlike aprotinin , AAT-1 produce human plasma , strong pro coagulant characteristic . AAT-1 different clinical setting : Circulating AAT-1 level increase 4-fold acute-phase response ( 3 ) . Patients low circulate level AAT-1 increase risk lung , liver pancreatic destructive disease , particularly emphysema ( 3 ) . Preclinical clinical study show AAT-1 therapy non-deficient individual safe , may modify disease progression type 1 type 2 diabetes , acute myocardial infarction , rheumatoid arthritis , inflammatory bowel disease , cystic fibrosis , transplant rejection , graft versus host disease multiple sclerosis ( 6-17 , 32,33,37,38 ) . AAT-1 treatment subsequently advance replacement therapy potential treatment broad spectrum inflammatory immune-mediated disease . AAT-1 also appear antibacterial inhibitor viral infection , influenza human immunodeficiency virus ( HIV ) ( 18 ) . Human pharmacokinetic data : In patient AAT-1 deficiency , intravenous administration AAT-1 dose 60 mg per kg body weight maintain plasma level resemble acute phase response immediately administration , retain appropriate level serum AAT protective threshold ( 50 mg/dl ) week afterwards ( 39 ) . Rational AAT-1 dosage : Based previous study clinical practice , administration multiple intravenous dosage 60 mg per kg body weight AAT-1 safe associate low incidence benign side-effects . Derived pharmacokinetic study ( 39 ) , AAT-1 plasma level immediately follow administration external dosage resembles acute phase response . A 30 % reduction AAT-1 plasma level anticipate gradual return preoperative level termination CPB ( 40 ) . Risk/ benefit study : The role AAT-1 mitigate inflammatory response establish . CPB potent stimulator inflammatory cascade associate bleed diatheses , coagulation abnormality , potentially lead organ dysfunction . To date , administration AAT-1 patient undergo cardiac surgery CPB explore . It may postulate inherent AAT-1 effect may offset deleterious CPB effect . This may clinically result improved preservation organ function , reduce postoperative bleeding reduce hospital stay . The benefit protease inhibitor correspond setting recently demonstrate ( 41-43 ) . As mention , administration AAT-1 various clinical setting consider safe low rate side effect ( see section 6.1 - potential risk ) . 4 Methods 4.1 Primary Objective 1 . To evaluate efficacy safety preoperative AAT-1 administration patient undergo CABG CPB . 2 . Postoperative blood loss organ function assess . To date , data exists regard AAT-1 effect setting CPB .
