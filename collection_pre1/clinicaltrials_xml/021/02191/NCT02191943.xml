	<detailed_description>The aim plan in-vivo trial investigate effectiveness caries infiltration technique repression approximal caries progression . . Within framework investigation intend hypothesis substantiate carious cavity , treat caries infiltration technique , exhibit significantly reduce radiological progression cavity treat use standard treatment . Modern dentistry , focus towards preventive minimally invasive treatment , attempt - aid fluoride therapy improve oral hygiene - prevent onset progression carious lesion much possible . Even today , approximal lesion pose particular problem treat dentist . A primary reason difficulty access localized area carious cavity . Treating area usually require invasive treatment , healthy tooth structure must remove . Furthermore , possible fill material may deteriorate result age process , mean restoration require replacement point future . In order prevent , development treatment orient towards prevention minimal invasion key . For number year option seal pit fissure occlusal surface , assessed literature highly efficacious effective ( Splieth et al . 2010 , Ahovuo-Saloranta et al . 2008 , Griffin et al . 2008 ) . It constitute vital component caries prevention approach especially event increase risk caries ( Hiiri et al . 2010 ) . In recent year attempt transfer treatment concept application approximal area , order prevent unnecessary substance ablation . A fissure seal resin dental adhesive use first time attempt create surface diffusion barrier ( Gomez et al . 2008 , Gomez et al . 2005 , Paris et al . 2006 , Martignon et al . 2006 , Robinson et al . 2001 ) . Coating tooth surface approximal area various plastic foil tooth separation open whole new treatment approach deal carious lesion ( Alkilzy et al . 2010 , 2009 ) . The caries infiltration technique constitute additional new treatment concept . Here , surface alone exclusively coated diffusion barrier instead create inside cavity , penetration `` infiltrant '' carious lesion ( Paris et al . 2010 , Meyer-Lueckel et al . 2010 , 2009 , 2008 , Phark et al . 2009 ) . In current study , possible demonstrate inhibition progression carious lesion infiltration technique , bovine teeth situ artificially generate carious lesion human teeth vitro ( Paris et al . 2010 ) . The development infiltration technique start back 1970 's first low-viscosity plastic material . However , never put clinical application due toxicity ( Robinson et al.1976 ) . During course development , adhesive system employ seal carious lesion ( Donly et al . 1992 , Garcia-Godoy et al . 1997 ) . These also exhibit caries-inhibiting effect . However , possible determine limit penetration depth . The reason surface morphology carious cavity , limited pore volume surface , characteristic adhesive ( Paris et al . 2007 ) . In order facilitate removal limit surface layer , hydrochloric acid gel use infiltration technique place orthophosphoric acid gel adhesive technology . Using conditioner possible guarantee well penetration material depth 58 µm due erosive removal surface layer ( Meyer-Lueckel et al . 2007 , Paris et al . 2007 , 2009 ) . In order well utilize capillary effect alter surface thereby increase penetration depth material , monomer mixture develop high penetration coefficient . These enable fast penetration infiltrant alter carious surface depth 750 µm ( Paris et al . 2007 , 2009 ) . The seal carious cavity longer restrict surface alone , also encompass body cavity . The anticipated result trial shall deliver information long-term effectiveness caries infiltration thereby result improvement caries prevention within scope dental treatment , prevent progression exist carious lesion . This micro-invasive form treatment , largely facilitate delay avoidance conventional invasive initial dental treatment associate inevitable loss healthy tooth structure . Further study optimization infiltration technique build upon result . In long-term , possible use finding develop new prevention treatment option approximal carious lesion .</detailed_description>
