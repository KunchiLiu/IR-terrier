	<brief_summary>Chronic traumatic encephalopathy ( CTE ) progressive degenerative brain disease symptom include memory loss , problem impulse control , depression lead suicide . As disease progress , lead dementia . Currently CTE diagnose postmortem over-accumulation protein call tau observe . There new experimental measure make possible , first time , measure tau protein live human brain use novel positron emission tomography ( PET ) ligand , [ F-18 ] AV-1451 ( aka , [ 18F ] -T807 ) . The main objective study use novel PET approach measure tau accumulation brain . The presence CTE autopsy decease National Football League ( NFL ) player well document . Accordingly , conduct study group retire NFL player clinical symptom CTE suspect CTE base high level tau spinal fluid abnormality see research brain scan . We compare control group former elite level athlete experience brain trauma , deny clinical symptom , completely normal spinal fluid tau amyloid level , brain scan . We also include group subject AD . All participant recruit ongoing study , head Partnering PI proposal , Dr. Robert Stern , Boston University Center Study Traumatic Encephalopathy Alzheimer 's Disease Center . We use beta amyloid PET scan ( [ 18F ] -florbetapir ) tau PET scan ( [ 18F ] -T807 ) consecutive day . With beta amyloid scan expect little evidence amyloid NFL player presume CTE , evidence amyloid control group athletes history repetitive brain trauma . In contrast expect see beta amyloid accumulation AD patient brain . With new tau ligand , expect NFL player presume CTE show elevate level tau protein brain , observed athlete without history brain trauma , see AD patient ' brain . Another goal use late MRI technology develop specific tau image biomarkers correlate PET spinal fluid tau measure without radiation PET invasiveness spinal tap . The development surrogate image marker tau , critically important diagnose CTE . This turn lead study relevant treatment prevention devastate disease . Finally , exploratory method examine possible genetic risk CTE , also use cut edge genetic analysis blood sample subject proposal compare tau load , measure PET tau ligand uptake cerebrospinal fluid ( CSF ) p-tau level , measure genetic susceptibility tau load , refer genetic risk score tau .</brief_summary>
