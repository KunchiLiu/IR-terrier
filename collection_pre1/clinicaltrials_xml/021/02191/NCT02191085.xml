	<brief_summary>Access medical care patient breathe disorder sleep major problem Canadians . Recently , increase interest health care provider physician help improve access medical care patient , unclear whether patient severe sleep-disordered breathing receive care non-physician provider response treatment patient receive care physician . Since severe high risk develop cardiac respiratory complication hospitalize , initiative improve access use non-physician provider could great benefit individual patient health care system . The objective project : 1. determine whether patient severe breathe disorder sleep response treatment care non-physician health care provider ( respiratory therapist ) care physician ; 2. determine effect non-physician health care provider treatment patient access ; 3. determine health care utilization relate cost associate non-physician health care provider treatment .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Evaluation `` Fast Track '' Respiratory Therapy Clinic Patients With Suspected Severe Sleep-Disordered Breathing</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The difficulty provide timely access sleep specialist widespread . These delay particularly important patient severe SDB due increase risk adverse clinical outcome potential associate healthcare cost . The lack timely access spark interest use alternate care provider ( ACPs ) manage patient SDB . Our group others demonstrate ACPs effective efficient substitute physician patient uncomplicated SDB . However , role ACPs management patient severe SDB remain unclear . Prompted wait time far exceed current Canadian guideline , recently implement ACP-led `` Fast Track '' clinic patient refer Foothills Medical Centre ( FMC ) Sleep Centre suspect severe SDB . In clinic , patient suspect severe SDB assess sleep-trained registered respiratory therapist function ACP . Decisions regard sleep testing treatment make patient ACP , guidance sleep physician . This model care differs physician-led model use FMC Sleep Centre . To evaluate novel care delivery model , design randomized trial compare outcome patient `` Fast Track '' clinic undergo conventional , physician-led care . The specific goal study : 1. compare clinical effectiveness ACP-led clinic patient suspect severe SDB physician-led management ; 2. determine whether cycle time referral diagnosis treatment patient refer suspect severe SDB reduce ACP-led clinic ; 3. determine impact ACP-led clinic demand sleep physician , ACPs diagnostic testing ; 4. compare cost-effectiveness model care use data healthcare utilization , cost , patient report health-related quality life ( HRQOL ) . Patients `` Standard Management '' arm assess sleep respirologist follow management plan determine sleep physician patient . This plan may involve polysomnography initiation PAP therapy . If test order , follow-up may occur physician ACP , physician 's discretion . For patient initiate PAP therapy , decision delegate follow-up ACP leave physician , intent study observe real-world practice change management individual patient . In `` Fast Track '' arm , ACP perform initial assessment determine management plan patient . To ensure patient safety , management plan discuss sleep respirologist , designate patient 's primary sleep physician . This sleep physician available FMC Sleep Centre `` Fast Track '' clinic assist assessment patient appear unwell ( e.g . severe hypoxemia , decompensated cardiorespiratory failure , etc. ) . As `` Standard Management '' arm , follow-up visit review test result , discuss initiate treatment , assess treatment response may occur ACP perform initial assessment may delegate ACP . As usual procedure FMC Sleep Centre , ambulatory sleep test requisition complete ACPs physician , whereas polysomnogram requisition complete primary sleep physician ensure adequate blinding patient assignment . The research associate ensure test interpret advance clinic visit . Patients follow ACPs either arm refer primary sleep physician assessment non-respiratory sleep disorder , persistent symptom daytime sleepiness .</detailed_description>
