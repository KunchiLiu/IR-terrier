	<brief_summary>To ensure minimal cervical motion intubation trauma patient important prevention cervical spine injury ( CSI ) deterioration exist CSI . Intubation require secure airway patient anesthesia management mechanical ventilation intensive care unit . Laryngoscopes assist tools intubation . The widely use laryngoscope type one Macintosh blade . However , various type laryngoscope develop used case difficult intubation , intubation patient head neck trauma , intubation attempt carry inexperienced individual . Truview EVO2® Airtraq® newly develop laryngoscope , integrated optical view system . The Truphatek TruView EVO2® ( Truphatek International Ltd , Netanya , Israel ) recently introduce , easy view type laryngoscope , modify blade Macintosh type laryngoscope , angle 46° end blade include camera system magnifies image . The Airtraq® laryngoscope ( ATQ ; King Medical Systems , Newark , DE ) also newly develop type laryngoscope , include optical imaging system . There channel device placement endotracheal tube . Endotracheal tube insert channel laryngoscopy . It report Airtraq novel single use laryngoscope provide glottis display without deviation normal position oral , pharyngeal tracheal ax . In literature , many study compare effect newly develop laryngoscopes cervical motion different scenario cadaver normal patient . However , study , individual vertebral motion report placement tube , angulation head neck difficulty intubation clear . In study first hypothesis cervical motion endotracheal intubation Truview EVO2® Airtraq® type laryngoscope less Macintosh . The second one endotracheal intubation time similar Macintosh use often .</brief_summary>
