	<criteria>Male female subject normal renal function , define Creatinine Clearance ( CrCl ) &gt; 80 mL/min screening ( Group 1 ) , male female patient Type 2 diabetes mellitus ( T2DM ) normal renal function , define CrCl &gt; 80 mL/min screening ( Group 7 ) Male female patient Renal impairment ( RI ) , determine value CrCl Screening estimate accord CockcroftGault formula . Patients classify group CrCl value : Mild RI : CrCl &gt; 50 ≤80 mL/min ( Group 2 ) Moderate RI : CrCl &gt; 30 ≤50 mL/min ( Group 3 ) Severe RI : CrCl≤30 mL/min ( Group 4 ) Endstage renal disease ( ESRD ) : CrCl≤30 mL/min , require hemodialysis ( Group 5 ) T2DM severe RI : CrCl≤30 mL/min ( Group 6 ) Age 18 80 year BMI 18 40 kg/m2 , minimum body mass least 45 kg female Signed date write informed consent prior admission study accordance Good Clinical Practice ( GCP ) local legislation Participants ( without RI ) meet follow criterion include trial : Relevant gastrointestinal tract surgery ( except appendectomy , cholecystectomy , herniotomy ) Diseases central nervous system , epilepsy , seizure , relevant neurological disorder , psychiatric disorder History relevant orthostatic hypotension , faint spell blackout ; systolic blood pressure &lt; 100 &gt; 160 mm Hg , diastolic blood pressure &lt; 60 &gt; 100 mm Hg , pulse rate &lt; 50 &gt; 100 1/min Chronic relevant acute infection History allergy/hypersensitivity ( include drug allergy ) deem relevant trial judge investigator Intake drug long halflife ( &gt; 24 h ) within least one month prior study start , plan intake study medication within ≤10 halflives administration another medication . Medications patient RI currently take treatment renal disease include criterium . Use medication trial within 10 day prior administration study medication might reasonably influence result trial , base knowledge time protocol preparation . Comedications know inhibit induce Pglycoprotein CYP3A allow . Inhibitors Pglycoprotein CYP3A include protease inhibitor ( ritonavir , lopinavir , nelfinavir ) ; azole antimycotic , ( itraconazole , ketoconazole , miconazole ) ; macrolide antibiotic , ( clarithromycin , erythromycin ) ; amiodarone , cimetidine , diltiazem , fluvoxamine , mibefradil , nefazodone , verapamil , tacrolimus , quinidine , reserpine , cyclosporine A. Inducers Pgp CYP3A include carbamazepine , phenobarbital , phenytoin , rifabutin , rifampin , St. John 's Wort troglitazone . In uncertain case , casebycase decision make consultation sponsor .
