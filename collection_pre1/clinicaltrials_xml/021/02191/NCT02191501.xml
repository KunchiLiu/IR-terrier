	<brief_title>Endoscopic Suturing Gastric Pylorus Delay Gastric Emptying Treat Obesity</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The purpose study evaluate safety , technical feasibility , effectiveness endoscopic guide treatment obesity - endoscopic pyloric suturing . The hypothesis rationale study gastric pyloric restriction cause early prolong satiety lead decrease food intake eventual weight loss . Both safety efficacy endoscopic pyloric suturing demonstrate animal model . Screening participant do 6-8 week prior procedure . Screening include general history physical examination , biochemical laboratory analysis inform consent . A baseline patient visit perform 4-6 week prior procedure . The baseline visit involve four hour gastric empty scan order determine rate empty stomach , regional empty upper low stomach , frequency amplitude contraction low stomach . The baseline visit also include nutritional counselling . The procedure perform endoscopy suite outpatient procedure . Patient prepped follow usual practice place left lateral decubitus position . Following induction sedation anesthesia anesthesia provider , complete endoscopic evaluation esophagus , stomach jejunum follow standard medical practice perform . The endoscope mount suture device advance over-tube antrum ass target area stitch placement ( physician select appropriate target site relation participant 's anatomy ) . The number suture require vary procedure base size pylorus ; however , think one two suture across pylorus sufficient enough achieve functional restriction pylorus . Participants observe minimum 1 hour follow procedure monitor adverse event . Patients recommend take follow medication order minimize complication follow pyloric suturing procedure ; Proton Pump Inhibitor Omeprazole 40 mg recommend daily 1 week prior plan procedure date - 40 mg twice daily procedure , Anti-Emetic -- Reglan Zofran end procedure need procedure , Scopalamine Patch prevent nausea vomit . All participant require adhere follow-up schedule outline unless withdrawn consent die . The reason ( ) participant follow documented investigator . Follow-up participant include telephone contact 1 18 week clinic visit 2,4 , 8,10,12 24 week . At 4 week visit , participant undergo repeat four hour gastric empty scan . At 3 month procedure participant undergo repeat endoscopy access stomach suture site .</detailed_description>
