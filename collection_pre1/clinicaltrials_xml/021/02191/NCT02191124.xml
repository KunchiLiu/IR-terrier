	<brief_summary>In recent year , measurement-based care ( MBC ) gain attention treatment depression allow psychiatrist individualize treatment decision patient base change psychopathology tolerance toward antidepressant . Several study , Sequenced Treatment Alternatives Relieve Depression ( STAR*D ) trial use MBC , find MBC-informed sequential algorithm successfully integrated clinical practice improve patient ' outcome However , despite strong theoretical rationale MBC data support ability implement MBC clinical practice setting , currently randomize control trial MDD patient compare MBC usual/standard care . The investigator compare MBC clinician 's treatment decision , standardize care two commonly prescribed antidepressant . Therefore , aim study determine effect MBC patient MDD compare standard treatment ( ST ) . The research hypothesis compare ST , estimate time response remission would significantly shorter MBC group without increase dropout rate side effect burden .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Objective : To compare effectiveness feasibility measurement-based care ( MBC ) treatment depression clinician 's treatment decision , standardize treatment ( ST , clinician ' choice decision ) two commonly prescribed antidepressant . Methods : Selecting patient psychiatric hospital general hospital depression , multi-center randomize control study design . Refer STAR-D `` measurement-based care '' mode , establish whole measurement-based evaluation system . Eligible patient randomly assign 24 week MBC ST , restrict treatment paroxetine ( 20-60mg/day ) mirtazapine ( 15-45mg/day ) group . ST group maximize simulate actual clinical situation , patient MBC group require complete prospective Life-chart Methodology ( LCM-p ) , 16-item Quick Inventory Depressive Symptomatology Self-Report ( QIDS-SR16 ) relate symptoms side effect self-assessment , doctor make comprehensive assessment accord result self-assessment , adjust treatment accord research program . This 1-year follow-up study ; independent member blind assessment baseline visit point view . Depressive symptom measure use Hamilton Rating Scale Depression ( HAMD ) QIDS-SR .</detailed_description>
