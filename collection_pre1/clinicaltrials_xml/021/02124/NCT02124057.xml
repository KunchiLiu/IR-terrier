	<brief_summary>Background : - Spinal bulbar muscular atrophy ( SBMA ) inherit disease . It cause weakness muscle use swallowing , breathing , speaking . SBMA mainly affect men , woman carry gene . Researchers think may link SBMA excess fat liver . Objective : - To look fatty liver liver injury people SBMA , people motor neuron disease , people carry gene SBMA . Eligibility : - Adults 18 year old SBMA , motor neuron disease , carrier SBMA . - Healthy adult volunteer . Design : - Participants screen medical history , physical exam , blood test . - Participants 1 outpatient visit 1-2 day . Women urine pregnancy test . All participant : - Blood test . - Liver ultrasound . A probe place abdomen certain location angle take picture . The painless procedure take 20-30 minute . - Liver magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) scan . The MRI scanner metal cylinder magnetic field . Participants lie table slide . They scanner 30 minute . They get earplugs loud noise . - Some participant abnormal liver test biopsy ( small piece ) liver take . The biopsy site locate ultrasound , clean numb . The physician quickly pas needle liver participant hold breath . Afterward , participant monitor bed 6 hour . - Participants may return follow-up another 1-2 day outpatient visit yearly 2 year .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Study Hepatic Function Patients With Spinal Bulbar Muscular Atrophy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Objectives : Spinal bulbar muscular atrophy ( SBMA ) , Kennedy disease , slowly progressive hereditary motor neuron disease currently effective treatment . Whether liver affect SBMA unclear . Preliminary analysis SBMA patient show change include increase hepatic fat , require additional investigation . Female carrier patient motor neuron disease also participate study evaluate liver fat function via image laboratory test . Study Population : We plan enroll 15 men genetically confirm SBMA , 15 age-matched healthy control men , 15 SBMA carrier woman , 15 age-matched healthy control woman 15 male motor neuron disease patient disease control . Design : Subjects complete liver evaluation NIH may include blood work , liver MRI image spectroscopy ( MRS ) , ultrasound , biopsy . Liver biopsies do 20 subject evidence fatty liver MRS : 10 subject SBMA , 5 female carrier , 5 patient form motor neuron disease . Liver biopsy perform subset subject clinical indication biopsy analysis . Liver tissue analyze NIH Clinical Center Pathology Department , additional study do research laboratory NIH . Patients may undergo repeat non-invasive test determine liver finding change time . An evaluation muscle fat MRI spectroscopy do subset 10 subject receive liver study . Outcome measure : Subjects assess use several different type measurement include blood work fatty metabolism , muscle function , hepatic function . Liver biopsy use determine pattern degree fatty infiltration . Liver muscle image use detect fat . Ultrasound elastography use assess extent fibrosis loss elasticity liver .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>INCLUSION CRITERIA : The study population consist several subgroup patient . An individual must meet one follow subgroup inclusion criterion participate study . SBMA subgroup : 1 . Male 2 . Genetically confirm SBMA 3 . Able travel NIH 4 . Greater 18 year old SBMA carrier : 1 . Female 2 . Genetically confirm SBMA heterozygote 3 . Able travel NIH 4 . Greater 18 year old Other motor neuron disease patient : 1 . Diagnosis motor neuron disease SBMA ( e.g.. amyotrophic lateral sclerosis ( ALS ) , spinal muscular atrophy ) 2 . Able travel NIH 3 . Greater 18 year old 4. . Male Healthy male control : 1 . Male 2 . No history diagnosis liver disease 3 . No history SBMA motor neuron disease 4 . Greater 18 year old 5 . No diagnosis diabetes insulin resistance 6 . No history alcohol abuse within last 1 year 7 . No history hyperlipidemia ( LDL &lt; 195 ) hypertriglyceridemia ( TAG &lt; 225 ) Healthy female control : 1 . Female 2 . No history diagnosis liver disease 3 . No history SBMA motor neuron disease 4 . Greater 18 year old 5 . No diagnosis diabetes insulin resistance 6 . No history alcohol abuse within last 1 year 7 . No history hyperlipidemia ( LDL &lt; 195 ) hypertriglyceridemia ( TAG &lt; 225 ) EXCLUSION CRITERIA : Diagnosed acquire inherit liver disease eg. , hepatitis B , hepatitis C , HIV , autoimmune hepatitis , cholestatic liver disease , Wilson disease , iron overload disease , alpha1 antitrypsin deficiency , hepatocellular carcinoma , ( hepatic neoplasm metastasis , etc . ) injury except fatty liver disease . Contraindications MRI contraindicate nonremovable metal device ( i.e . pacemaker , defibrillator , insulin pump , metal clip , nonremovable jewelry ) claustrophobia . Currently pregnant pregnant within past 6 month . Pregnant woman exclude study know associated abnormality liver function occur population . The long term effect MRI develop fetus unknown would present risk participation . In addition criterion , patient receive liver biopsy need meet additional exclusion criterion : Coagulopathy ( PT/PTT value prolong &gt; = 3 second upper limit normal , include treatment oral parenteral anticoagulant ) , thrombocytopenia ( &lt; 70,000 ) , abnormal bleeding time platelet dysfunction . Taking antiplatelet agent cardiovascular protection safely stop performance liver biopsy . Obesity , define BMI &gt; 30 .</criteria>
