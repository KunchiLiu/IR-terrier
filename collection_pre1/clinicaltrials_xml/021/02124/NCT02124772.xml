	<brief_summary>This 3-part ( Part A , Part B , Part C ) , Phase I/IIa , multi-center , open label , study pediatric subject refractory recurrent tumor . Part A repeat dose , dose escalation monotherapy study identify recommended phase II dose ( RP2D ) continuous dose schedule use 3 + 3 dose-escalation procedure . Part B evaluate preliminary activity trametinib monotherapy 4 disease-specific cohort subject . Each cohort enroll least 10 response-evaluable subject ( evaluable response define subject pre-dose least 1 post-dose disease assessment clinical assessment progression disease ) . Part C 3+3 study design determine safety , tolerability preliminary activity RP2D trametinib combination limit dose escalation dabrafenib . Part C enroll 18 subject . . The overall goal trial efficiently establish safe , pharmacologically relevant dose trametinib infant , child adolescent determine preliminary activity trametinib monotherapy select recurrent , refractory unresectable childhood tumor .</brief_summary>
