	<brief_summary>The primary objective study assess suitability autoinjector self-administration belimumab subject SLE real-life condition . The study ass use autoinjector inside clinic set outside clinic setting . The study also assess safety tolerability belimumab administer subcutaneously ( SC ) via autoinjector . Subjects self-administer belimumab SC thigh abdomen use autoinjector device 8 weekly dos . Subjects return follow-up visit 4 week last SC dose belimumab . All injection assess investigator success base direct observation and/or subject diary . A total 118 subject ( treat least one dose study drug ) plan enrol study .</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Male female age least 18 year time signing informed consent . Have clinical diagnosis SLE accord American College Rheumatology ( ACR ) criterion . Active , autoantibody positive SLE , define presence anti nuclear antibody ( ANA ) antidouble strand deoxyribonucleic acid ( dsDNA ) antibody ( screen historically ) . Are SLE treatment regimen include intravenous ( IV ) belimumab every 28 day least three 28day cycle . Day 0 ( i.e. , day first dose study agent ) schedule 2 week last dose IV dose belimumab may schedule 1 week 4 week last IV dose . A female subject eligible participate : Nonchildbearing potential define premenopausal female document tubal ligation hysterectomy ( definition , `` document '' refers outcome investigator's/designee 's review subject 's medical history study eligibility , obtain via verbal interview subject subject 's medical record ) ; postmenopausal define 12 month spontaneous amenorrhea ( questionable case blood sample simultaneous follicle stimulate hormone [ FSH ] &gt; 40 milli international unit/milliliter [ MIU/mL ] estradiol &lt; 40 picogram/mL [ &lt; 147 picomoles/Liter ] confirmatory ) . ( Females hormone replacement therapy [ HRT ] whose menopausal status doubt require use one contraception method wish continue HRT study . Otherwise , must discontinue HRT allow confirmation postmenopausal status prior study enrollment . For form HRT , least 2 4 week elapse cessation therapy blood draw ; interval depend type dosage HRT . Following confirmation postmenopausal status , resume use HRT study without use contraceptive method . ) ; Childbearing potential negative pregnancy test determine serum human chorionic gonadotropin ( hCG ) test screen urine hCG test prior dose ; Agrees use one contraception method 2 week prior day dose sufficiently minimize risk pregnancy point . Female subject must agree use contraception Day 112 ; OR samesex partner , prefer usual lifestyle Alanine aminotransferase ( ALT ) &lt; 2x upper limit normal ( ULN ) , alkaline phosphatase bilirubin &lt; =1.5xULN ( isolated bilirubin &gt; 1.5xULN acceptable bilirubin fractionate direct bilirubin &lt; 35 % ) . Capable give write informed consent , include compliance requirement restriction list consent form . Have previously participate study SC belimumab . Have receive live vaccine within 30 day Day 0 anticipate receipt live vaccine study within 120 day last injection study drug . Have receive nonbiologic investigational agent within 60 day Day 0 . Have severe active central nervous system ( CNS ) lupus ( include seizure , psychosis , organic brain syndrome , cerebrovascular accident ( CVA ) , cerebritis CNS vasculitis require therapeutic intervention within 60 day Day 0 . Have clinical evidence significant unstable uncontrolled acute chronic disease due SLE ( i.e. , cardiovascular , pulmonary , hematologic , gastrointestinal , hepatic , renal , neurological , malignancy , infectious disease ) , opinion principal investigator , could confound result study put subject undue risk . Have plan surgical procedure History medical disease ( e.g. , cardiopulmonary ) , laboratory abnormality , , opinion investigator , make subject unsuitable study . Have require management acute chronic infection , follow : Currently suppressive therapy chronic infection ( tuberculosis , pneumocystis , cytomegalovirus , herpes simplex virus , herpes zoster , atypical mycobacteria ) ; Hospitalization treatment infection within 60 day Day 0 ; Use parenteral ( IV intramascular [ IM ] ) antibiotic ( antibacterial , antiviral , antifungal , antiparasitic agent ) within 60 day Day 0 . History positive test human immuno virus ( HIV ) Screening . A positive Hepatitis B surface antigen Hepatitis B core antibody , positive Hepatitis C antibody result within 3 month Screening positive Screening . Have Immunoglobulin A ( IgA ) deficiency ( IgA level &lt; 10 milligrams/deciliter ) . Have Grade 3 great laboratory abnormality base Adverse Event Severity Grading except follow allow : Stable Grade 3 prothrombin time ( PT ) secondary warfarin treatment ; Stable Grade 3 partial thromboplastin time ( PTT ) due lupus anticoagulant relate liver disease anticoagulant therapy ; Stable Grade 3/4 proteinuria ( &lt; =6 grams/24 hour equivalent spot urine protein creatinine ratio allow ) ; Stable Grade 3 hypoalbuminemia due lupus nephritis , relate liver disease malnutrition ; Stable Grade 3 gamma glutamyl transferase ( GGT ) elevation due lupus hepatitis , relate alcoholic liver disease , uncontrolled diabetes , viral hepatitis . If present , abnormality ALT and/or aspartate aminotransferase ( AST ) must &lt; = Grade 2 ; Stable Grade 3 neutropenia stable Grade 3 white blood cell count . Note : All Grade 3 great laboratory abnormality flag laboratory report . Therefore exception determine Investigator Medical Monitor .
