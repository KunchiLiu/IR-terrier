	<brief_summary>The propose study double-blind randomize control trial healthy pregnant woman ( BMI 18.5 - 29.9 kg/m2 , age 18 - 40 yr ) receive prenatal care Athens Regional Midwifery clinic ( ARMC ) . The primary goal propose study determine relative change blood folate DNA methylation level response 2 different supplemental dos folic acid one provide Institute Medicine 's recommended folate intake pregnant woman second provide high dose routinely take pregnant woman over-the-counter prenatal supplement . The specific aim study : 1. compare maternal serum red blood cell ( RBC ) folate level % change woman take either 400 800 mcg/day supplemental folic acid first prenatal visit ( &lt; 10 week ) delivery ; 2. compare infant 's cord blood folate level response different maternal folic acid intake ( 400 mcg/d v 800 mcg/d ) ; 3. determine relative difference level oxidize folic acid maternal infant blood response 400 800 mcg/d folic acid dose , 4. determine genome wide gene specific DNA methylation response pregnant woman receive prenatal supplement contain either 400 800 mcg folic acid per day</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Folic Acid Supplementation Pregnant Women : Dose Response</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The study conduct healthy woman BMI within range 18.5 - 35.0 kg/m2 . There two treatment group : ( 1 ) one group take 400 mcg per day folic acid part prenatal supplement , begin study enrollment ( &lt; 10 week gestational age ) ( 2 ) second group take 800 mcg per day folic acid part prenatal supplement . Both group provide identical composition prenatal supplement folic acid content . Repeated measure outcome variable determine blood sample collect various time pregnancy delivery . Due role prenatal supplementation help maintain optimal nutrition status throughout pregnancy , placebo control . Women recruit Athens Regional Medical Center Midwifery Practice blood draw associate study conduct schedule prenatal visit . The research protocol consistent standard care provide clinic affect prenatal service provide research participant . Following consent first prenatal visit , participant randomly assign receive prenatal supplement contain either 400 800 mcg folic acid ( ingredient unmodified concentration ) . The 400 mcg dose approximate current Recommended Dietary Allowance ( RDA ) pregnant woman 600 mcg Dietary Folate Equivalents ( 400 mcg folic acid â‰ˆ 600 mcg DFEs ; conversion factor base high bioavailability folic acid : 1 mcg folic acid = 1.7 mcg DFE ) . The high dose 800 mcg folic acid represent amount commonly find over-the-counter prenatal supplement . Women ask take supplement daily throughout duration gestation follow standard prenatal diet , exception avoid highly fortify ( &gt; 100 % RDA ) ready-to-eat cereal fortify energy/snack bar drink , due high folic acid content . At first visit , participant instruct use dietary recall data collection sheet ( food diary ) ask complete specific time point study . Each set dietary recall include information three 24-hr period non-consecutive day include one weekend day . Dietary recall information obtain approximately week 16 32 gestation . This permit assessment typical dietary intake total calorie specific nutrient , include folate . Blood sample collect , non-fasting state , first , 28 week 36 week prenatal visit mother cord blood delivery determination primary outcome measure .</detailed_description>
