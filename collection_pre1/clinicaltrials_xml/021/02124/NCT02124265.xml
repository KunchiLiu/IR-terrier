	<brief_summary>In patient moderate severe thermal injury ( &gt; 20 % TBSA ) adequate fluid resuscitation main priority achieve successful outcome . Soon burn injury substantial amount fluid accumulate rapidly wound lose third space . Without intervention process lead hypotension shock . The Parkland formula devise calculate much intravenous ( IV ) fluid , i.e . crystalloids , need adequate resuscitation first 24 hour post-burn . However , IV resuscitation lead overexpansion ( third space ) volume , lead severe complication compartment syndrome pulmonary edema . In major population center , catastrophic event cause mass casualty disrupt many hospital emergency service , potentially delay acute IV fluid resuscitation . Burn patient case report show oral rehydration therapy ( ORT ) use supplement place IV therapy efficacious . ORT could easily apply mass burn casualty . ORT generally know third world treat life-threatening dehydration due diarrhea . The glucose-sodium co transport mechanism enable affect human intestine absorb sufficient amount water electrolytes replace large fluid loss due severe diarrhea , even adverse field condition . No electrolyte disturbance record case . Studies enteral resuscitation animal burn model show high rate small intestinal absorption adequate resuscitation follow major burn injury . The optimal composition oral rehydration solution resuscitation burn wound determine . In cholera patient , Ceralyte速 proven superior WHO Oral Rehydration Solution , increase fluid absorption intestine . The Ceralyte速 90 solution , 90mEq/L sodium low osmolarity &lt; 275mOsm , may also contribute optimal intestinal fluid uptake without cause electrolyte disturbance thermal injury . ORT use might reduce occurrence compartment syndrome pulmonary edema since fluid regulate intestine accord physiologic requirement . The investigator propose conduct prospective study use Ceralyte速 90 show oral resuscitation therapy ( ORT ) burn reduce total amount IV fluid need adequate resuscitation test efficacy safety ORT resuscitation burn patient .</brief_summary>
