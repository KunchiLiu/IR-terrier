	<brief_summary>Exercise cornerstone pulmonary rehabilitation treatment Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease ( COPD ) . Although researcher show numerous benefit exercise COPD patient , study look exercise tolerance psychological outcome follow training . COPD characterise persistent inflammation cause progressive decline lung function multisystemic complication . This inflammation amplify patient suffer acute exacerbation . There wellknown relationship exercise , immune function risk infection . Exercise also show antiinflammatory effect perform regularly . There lack research look inflammatory immune response exercise patient COPD . The exercise within study individually tailor patient COPD base validate 6 minute walk test ( 6MWT ) protocol involve interval exercise use previously . This type exercise consider appropriate research mechanism benefit maintains exercise train effect modality ( e.g . continuous low intensity aerobic exercise ) avoid occurrence limitation exercise people lung problem ( e.g . dynamic hyperinflation ) . It also closely mirrors daily activity someone COPD . The investigator want explore effect exercise specifically immune function 15 people COPD compare change 15 Controls . By good understanding mechanism exercise affect inflammation , investigator could eventually design good Pulmonary Rehabilitation intervention , especially risk .</brief_summary>
