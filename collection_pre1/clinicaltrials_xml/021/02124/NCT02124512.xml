	<brief_summary>Metabolic syndrome condition involve elevated level fat blood , tendency towards diabetes , hypertension , much fat around abdomen ( increased waistline ) . Individuals metabolic syndrome often impaired glucose tolerance , condition blood sugar normal fasting ( eat ) , high drinking sugary drink . This due abnormality body 's sensitivity insulin ( insulin resistance ) , due part inability muscle take glucose . People metabolic syndrome inflammation fat tissue blood stream , change level inflammatory chemical produce cell fat tissue study . One possible source inflammation may bacteria intestine . When individual eat fatty food , bacterial product become attached fat blood get direct fat tissue . The investigator wish determine whether individual excessive amount inflammation fat tissue , whether inflammation come bacteria intestine . To determine , investigator wish treat individual antibiotic reduces bacteria intestine blood , determine whether reduces overall level inflammation .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Blood Lipopolysaccharide ( LPS ) Rifaximin Study</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This randomize , placebo control proof concept study examine investigational drug Rifaximin Soluble Solid Dispersion ( SSD ) ability reduce gut microbiota thereby reduce adipose inflammation improve insulin resistance . Each subject enrol undergo fat tolerance test high fat meal , oral glucose tolerance test , fat biopsy , euglycemic clamp . Following successful completion procedure subject randomize study treatment . That treatment involve receive investigational drug,80 mg per day rifaximin soluable solid dispersion ( SDD ) , placebo 8 week . All procedure perform Clinical Services Core CCTS . The initial visit involve inform consent , routine lab ( comprehensive metabolic panel , lipid panel , TSH , CBC platelet ) . These routine lab safety purpose rule exclusionary disorder . A stool sample also collect frozen possible future analysis bacterial microflora . Subjects ask allow principal investigator bank blood tissue sample collect study use study related test . No additional blood tissue sample collect . If subject agree banking blood tissue sample store Principal Investigator 's laboratory University Kentucky indefinite period time use . Stored sample use future research test learn prevent , detect , treat insulin resistance , metabolic syndrome , diabetes health problem . Each subject undergo total body composition test use total body dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry ( DXA ) scan . The DXA scan measure subject 's bond density body fat .</detailed_description>
