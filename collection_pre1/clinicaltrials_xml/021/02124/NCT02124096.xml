	<detailed_description>The bidirectional transmission influenza A virus animal human clearly important part complex dynamic influenza evolution , however thorough understanding process remain mystery . The role swine overall human influenza evolution unclear , long history study swine origin influenza reveal influenza evolves swine population North America Europe . In 2009 , pandemic occur emergence H1N1 pandemic ( pdm ) virus find originated North American European swine lineage , reinforce virus evolve swine lead important human pathogen . Interestingly virus transmit back swine bird North America . In 2011 , H3N2 swine origin influenza virus know H3N2v contain H1N1pdm matrix genomic segment report cause human infection multiple part US . In 2012 , case increase , especially summer month . Since 2011 , 321 confirm case report 13 state include 107 case Ohio . Almost case link swine exposure farm agricultural fair . Study zoonotic transmission event agricultural fair necessary order well understand event occur , human pathogen emerge , potentially prevent event occur . These event could lead new pandemic epidemic prevention crucial . The goal study examine rate bidirectional zoonotic transmission Ohio agricultural fair . Through collection virus host sample , hope begin answer question regard virus cross specie barrier , adapt new host , event could impact overall influenza virus evolution .</detailed_description>
