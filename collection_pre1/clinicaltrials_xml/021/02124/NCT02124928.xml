	<brief_summary>The aim study investigate association sonographic histological feature plaque among biomarkers cardiovascular risk . The predictive value factor concern long-term clinical outcome carotid endarterectomy also assess . This may help improve identification patient carotid artery stenosis benefit carotid endarterectomy . The investigator major hypothesis morphology carotid plaque associate objectifiable sonographic parameter , particular greyscale median . Second , investigator hypothesize sonographic histological plaque morphology associate certain biomarkers cardiovascular risk . Identification 'vulnerable plaque ' basis peripheral blood draw sonographic investigation may enable treat physician focus resource patient benefit form therapeutic intervention primary prevention ischemic stroke .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The indication revascularization carotid artery stenoses typically base degree stenosis presence symptom . Recent evidence suggest risk embolization atherosclerotic plaque may associate plaque density assess sonographically determination greyscale median . Also , association serum proteins vascular endothelial growth factor ( VEGF ) , hypoxia inducible factor ( HIF ) pigment epithelium-derived factor ( PEDF ) , matrix metalloproteinases 2 , 8 9 unstable plaque report . The VUCAP study include patient undergoing carotid endarterectomy symptomatic asymptomatic carotid artery disease . Sonographic serological marker plaque vulnerability compare histological feature plaque clinical presentation ( symptomatic vs. asymptomatic ) . Preoperatively , greyscale median plaque assess . Histomorphological investigation carotid plaque perform . Serological investigation include marker inflammation , thrombo-modulatory factor , lipid fraction parameter associate unstable plaque . The aim present study assess ability pigment epithelium-derived factor ( PEDF ) , vascular endothelial growth factor ( VEGF ) , hypoxia-induced factor 1 alpha ( HIF 1-Î± ) , matrix metalloproteinases 2 , 8 9 differentiate vulnerable stable carotid artery plaque . Identification 'vulnerable plaque ' basis peripheral blood draw sonographic investigation may enable treat physician focus resource patient benefit form therapeutic intervention primary prevention ischemic stroke .</detailed_description>
