	<brief_summary>Schizophrenia major mental illness characterize variety different symptom include hallucination , paranoia , difficulty formulate express thought , feeling similar depression , problem cognitive process . Individuals schizophrenia usually treat class medication call anti-psychotics , typically help alleviate symptom disorder . In general , anti-psychotic medication completely cure disorder , many patient leave degree ongoing symptom . Furthermore , estimate 20-30 % individual schizophrenia consider treatment refractory resistant respond anti-psychotic medication . The Food Drug Administration approve one antipsychotic medication use patient consider treatment resistant schizophrenia ( TRS ) . This medication , clozapine , show beneficial patient TRS , though many 40-70 % patient fail respond partially responsive treatment clozapine . In extensive search medical psychiatric literature , impressed potential minocycline , tetracycline antibiotic , adjunctive therapy patient schizophrenia base report neuroprotective anti-inflammatory effect . It fairly inexpensive drug , well tolerate , two randomize clinical trial demonstrate favorable result early-phase schizophrenia . Only one case series two patient investigated minocycline patient schizophrenia clozapine . Minocycline also interest medication augmentation clozapine , interested previous finding increase inflammation brain patient schizophrenia potential role inflammation treatment resistant schizophrenia . Though many marker increase inflammation brain , current study , interested general marker inflammation call C-Reactive Protein ( CRP ) . We hypothesize patient may increase level inflammation brain , measure CRP level ( drawn peripheral blood ) , patient increase level CRP may respond good augmentation minocycline . The propose pilot study compare minocycline augmentation clozapine individual high vs low inflammation measure CRP . We hypothesize minocycline well tolerated result improvement symptom schizophrenia , cognition , well improve quality life patient preferentially patient high CRPs . We plan use variety different scale measure improvement varying symptom schizophrenia well cognitive function , administer patient three week interval total study time twelve week . We hypothesize minocycline could prove effective , well tolerate , inexpensive medication treatment resistant patient schizophrenia particular difficulty social interaction , obtain maintain employment , overall quality life . Furthermore , hypothesize data obtain study contribute ongoing exploration role inflammation brain patient schizophrenia help understand target role various inflammatory marker pathophysiology treatment treatment resistant schizophrenia .</brief_summary>
