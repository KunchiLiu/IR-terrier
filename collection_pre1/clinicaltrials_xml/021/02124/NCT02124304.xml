	<brief_summary>Cervical pain condition affect 14.6 % adult annually . Of annual prevalence , 37.3 % experience persistent neck pain periodic recur episode . The purpose study compare muscle activation pattern cervical musculature exercise elastic versus manual resistance neck pain asymptomatic population . Methods : A convenience sample 15 healthy , physically active participant 15 current patient diagnose non-radicular cervical pain recruit . Exclusionary criterion include : current cervical upper extremity injury ( healthy group ) , history neck surgery , corticosteroid treatment within last two week , radicular sign symptom . Surface electromyography use quantify activity level bilateral SCM , AS , Cervical Paraspinal ( CP ) , Upper Trapezius ( UT ) muscle perform series 6 exercise elastic resistance use Thera-Band® Resistance Bands manual resistance . The area prepped surface electrode place correspond muscle . The movement standardize use peak activation ( PA ) muscle full flexion-extension movement create percentage peak activation ( % PA ) . The test battery consist 6 exercise elastic resistance manual resistance , total 12 different trial . Each trial involve 5 repetition , hold 5 second . The exercise include cervical : extension , flexion , leave rotation , right rotation , leave side bending , right side bending . The men use green woman use red Thera-Band® Resistance Band . The order exercise randomize two part minimize effect fatigue . First , cervical flexion extension manual elastic resistance randomize . Secondly , remain 8 exercise randomize . Following exercise , patient rate perceive level exertion Thera-band® Resistance Intensity Scale Exercise ( RISE ) .</brief_summary>
