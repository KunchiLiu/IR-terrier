	<detailed_description>The study conduct Center Smoking Cessation , State University ( UEL ) , Brazil . A sample 32 outpatient select , refractory first-line smoking cessation treatment . All patient include study condition understand signing informed consent approval research Ethics Research Committee UEL . Prior randomization clinical trial , participant assess questionnaire provide information demographic , smoke history , nicotine dependence , depressive disorder , anthropometric measurement , height , weight , body mass index ( BMI ) , waist circumference ( WC ) , well heart rate ( HR ) blood pressure ( BP ) .The diagnostic criterion research depressive disorder tobacco use disorder assed trained psychiatrist accord Structured Clinical Interview . The primary outcome measurement significant reduction number cigarettes/day . Secondary outcome measurement : reduction exhale Carbon Monoxide , reduction Hamilton Depression Rating Scale score , improvement Sheehan Quality Life scale measurement . The Fagerstrom Test nicotine dependence ( FTND ) use assess severity tobacco dependence FTND . The FTND scale six item score 0-10 . The cutoff point FTND nicotine dependence &gt; 5 . The assessment severity depression among study participant conduct use Hamilton Depression Rating Scale- 17 item ( HDRS ) . HDRS translate adapted Brazilian population . Minnesota Nicotine Withdrawal Scale ( MNWS ) MNWS 5-point scale ( none , slight , mild , moderate , severe ) measure withdrawal symptoms.The scale ass damage patient due illness . It self - administer scale consist 3 item . A score 0-10 correspond patient 's opinion . Assesses disability damage three area : 1 ) occupational , 2 ) social life , leisure , 3 ) family life , activity , household activity . Can score 0-10 , 0-3 mild injury , 4-6 moderate damage 7-10 injury grave.The number pack-years calculate accord definition : number cigarette smoke per day multiply number year smoke divide 20 ( 1 pack 20 cigarette ) .This clinical trial design investigate efficacy NAC treatment tobacco use disorder . Data collect face-to-face interview baseline week 4 , 8 12 . Smoking status also evaluate use exhaled carbon monoxide ( COEXH ) . COEXH measure use Micro CO Meter electrochemical sensor ( Micro CO - Micro Medical Ltd , Rochester , Kent , UK ) . All participant instruct breathe deeply hold breath 20 second exhale slowly completely mouthpiece . Smoking reduction validate breath carbon monoxide concentration , cut-off point COEXH level categorize â‰¤ 6ppm smoke cessation ( Middleton et al. , 2000 ) . Both group receive monthly meeting Group Behavioral Therapy course study . Participants ( n=32 ) randomize two group 16 patient group , double-blind manner receive NAC placebo . The dose NAC 3000mg/day administer 500 mg capsule two daily dos , 3 capsule morning 3 evening . The chosen dosage base previous study similar dosage show effective well tolerate . Individuals randomize NAC placebo , group individual equal gender , age , score FTND depressive disorder . Statistical analysis perform repeated measurement design analyse variance , post hoc test .</detailed_description>
