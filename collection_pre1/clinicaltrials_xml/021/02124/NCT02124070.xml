	<brief_summary>Background : - ( Degree ) ystinosis inherited disease . If treat correctly , cause muscle waste weakness kidney damage . Researchers want learn growth hormone ( GH ) help people cystinosis . Objective : - To learn GH treatment slow reverse muscle waste improve muscle strength people cystinosis . Eligibility : - People 18 old already enrol protocol 78-HG-0093 . Design : - Participants admit clinic eight 3 4 day visit , mostly four month apart . - At visit , participant history physical exam give urine blood sample . - At month 0 13 , participant take test repeat 12- 25-month visit : - They eye exam , medical consultation , strength movement test . - They complete questionnaire . - They may test heart activity lung function . - They ultrasound image arm hand muscle . They scan leg lie magnetic resonance imaging machine ( big metal cylinder ) . They DEXA bone scan ( two X-ray beam measure body composition ) . They also swallow barium X-ray imaging record throat muscle . - Participants randomly assign either receive receive GH first 12 month . Then , month 13 , receive GH , switch next 12 month . - Participants take GH daily injection . They teach give injection .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Cystinosis autosomal recessive storage disorder due defective transport amino acid cystine cellular lysosome . Cystine accumulation lead cellular dysfunction organ tissue . Available treatment cystine-depleting agent , cysteamine , prevent delay organ damage , include muscle . In poorly treat patient , however , progressive vacuolar myopathy muscle waste begin second decade life significantly debilitate patient . Muscle biopsy demonstrate prominent unrimmed vacuole small ring fiber evidence endomysial inflammation . Plasma muscle carnitine deficiency , impair mitochondrial fatty acid metabolism , might also limit muscle energy production . Growth Hormone ( GH ) potentially counter muscle waste cystinosis patient . It consistently induce anabolic effect patient malnourish catabolic state , enhance growth development bone , connective tissue , viscera , fat , musculoskeletal muscle . GH , dose approximately 0.006 0.1 mg/kg/day , proven safe effective HIV/AIDS wasting , parenteral nutrition-dependent short bowel syndrome , pediatric chronic kidney disease , adult pediatric GH-deficiency state . The current protocol randomize ( treatment treatment ) crossover clinical trial determine GH ( 0.03 mg/kg/day ) beneficial muscle waste cystinosis . Patients examine NIH Clinical Research Center every 4 month 2 year . Change muscle mass serve primary outcome parameter , rhGH ( Humatrope ) provide Eli Lilly . HumatropeR ( somatropin ) currently approve FDA : - Treatment child short stature growth failure associate growth hormone ( GH ) deficiency , Turner syndrome , idiopathic short stature , SHOX deficiency , failure catch height small gestational age birth . - Treatment adult either childhood-onset adult-onset GH deficiency .</detailed_description>

Age &lt; 18 Psychiatric illness neurological disease interfere compliance communication health care personnel Current malignancy history malignancy Uncontrolled hypertension ( blood pressure &gt; 180 systolic &gt; 95 diastolic ) Poor control hyperglycemia ( fast blood glucose level &gt; 160 ) Serum creatinine level &gt; 1.8 mg/dL Pregnancy Children exclude critical issue dosage safety answer adult , child cystinosis rarely affect symptom myopathy . Patients chronic renal failure , treat hemodialysis exclude study , GH contraindicate patient . Patients receive renal transplant exclude study GH treatment contraindication patient . Enrolled patient must able travel NIH case adverse event occur locally discharge NIH Clinical Research Center . Other medical exclusion help avoid spurious assignation side effect rhGH .</criteria>
