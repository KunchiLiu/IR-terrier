	<brief_summary>Patients chronic severe asthma ( CSA ) cripple disease current available treatment satisfactory . Thus , management CSA remain major unmet need . Although evidence exist randomize controlled trial fail support definite role immunomodulatory drug patient due major methodologic drawback , finding low-dose methotrexate ( MTX ) encouraging . However , large well design clinical trial require establish beneficial role MTX CSA detection key characteristic go respond drug . This study first multi-centre RCT investigate role add-on immunological modifier clinically useful therapeutic strategy patient well-phenotyped chronic severe asthma . As , study overlap research currently ongoing .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Patients recruit accessible asthmatic patient list tertiary referral center . All patient meet stringent diagnostic criterion CSA , include requirement regular use Step 5 medication ( i.e . oral prednisone and/or omalizumab ) . The experimental design propose study take form double-blind parallel-randomized placebo-controlled trial consist total eight visit include run-in run-out period . Patients randomly allocate receive either MTX match placebo week add-on therapy exist medication run-in . Physiological , laboratory clinical assessment measure regularly throughout study compare baseline assessment . We expect MTX reduce Step 5 medication dosage patient CSA without compromise overall disease control . Improvement several indicator asthma severity control also investigate</detailed_description>
