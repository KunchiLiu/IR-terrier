	<brief_summary>This small preliminary study conduct explore new method potential aid diagnosis liver fibrotic disease well predict disease progression . There total 4 visit spread approximately 8 week . You ask drink `` heavy water '' time . `` Heavy Water '' also know deuterated water , physically chemically similar ordinary drinking water . It taste feel exactly like regular water . It odorless know harmful effect dose give . Heavy water occur naturally , minor component water ingest daily .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Management NASH NAFLD remain significant unmet medical challenge grow importance part obesity epidemic . Minimally invasive tool monitor disease progression evaluate therapeutic intervention NASH would extremely valuable . Utilizing vivo heavy water labeling , multiple pathway relate protein metabolism ( fibrogenesis ) lipid metabolism quantify human subject . We recently discover plasma lumicam synthesis represent non-invasive kinetic biomarker tissue fibrogenesis patient viral hepatitis . In addition , synthesis fatty acid plasma VLDL-triglycerides provide window hepatic lipid metabolism . Stable isotope long history safe , effective tracer measure synthesis molecule human ( 1 ) . Recently , new development stable isotope label technique advance mass spectrometry make vivo kinetic measurement slow metabolic process possible . Through use 2H2O source labeling , others measure T-cell proliferation ( 2 ) , mammary epithelial cell proliferation ( 3 ) , prostate epithelial cell proliferation ( 4 ) , triglyceride synthesis ( 5 ) protein synthesis ( 6 ) human . We recently evaluate approach measurement fibrogenesis patient fibrotic liver disease . Excess accumulation collagen liver term fibrosis . Fibrosis common pathological feature several chronic liver disease ( e.g . Hepatitis C , alcoholic liver disease , primary biliary sclerosis , drug/toxin induce liver disease , etc. ) . Currently , standard method detection fibrosis liver biopsy histochemical analysis tissue collagen content ( 8 , 9 ) . Although effective diagnose exist , advanced fibrosis , single biopsy measure current disease activity predict rate progression . To determine whether disease progress use current method , second biopsy require . If significant additional collagen accumulate since first biopsy , suggest disease progressing . However , measurement represent history disease , current disease activity time second biopsy . There also significant limitation current method , since change collagen pool size measurable histochemistry measure small change collagen content intra-laboratory variability inherent histochemical assay reduce sensitivity ( 10 , 11 ) . This stable isotope / mass spectrometry base method apply quantification fibrogenesis vivo ( bone marrow biopsy ) identification novel biomarkers fibrogenesis plasma patient receive investigational therapy . If successful , research identify plasma protein easily measure tandem mass spectrometry ( LC/MS/MS ) method whose synthesis rate reflect disease activity heart . Ideally , set marker related NASH/ NAFLD develop detect differentiate among multiple disease phenotype , base kinetic signature measure single blood draw patient label deuterated water . The role de novo lipogenesis ( DNL ) suggest several clinical study ( Donnelly JCI 2005 , Puri Hepatology 2009 ) . DNL contribute significantly accumulation lipid NASH ( Donnelly JCI 2005 ) . Moreover DNL elevate many inflammatory state may useful marker hepatic inflammation . DNL well hepatic TG assembly cholesterogenesis easily measure plasma dry blood spot sample patient consume 2H2O , several day label plasma DNL reach steady state reflect hepatic DNL rate .</detailed_description>
