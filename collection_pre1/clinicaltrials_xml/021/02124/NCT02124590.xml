	<brief_summary>This longitudinal study support Pfizer collaboration DMPI ( Duke Molecular Physiology Institute ) DIAL ( Duke Image Acquisition Laboratory ) measure effect acute exercise carnitine acylcarnitine level muscle insulin sensitivity plasma . This pilot study seek explain moderate intensity exercise provide improvement glucose control pre-diabetic patient vigorous intensity . The investigator hypothesize moderate intensity exercise might beneficial elderly individual overweight obese , specifically : 1 . Reducing damage excess protein acetylation ( measure muscle biopsy ) , 2 . Improving acylcarnitine/carnitine ratio ( measure MRS ) , 3 . Improving overall mitochondrial function reflect reduced phosphocreatine recovery time ( measure MRS ) 4 . Increasing insulin sensitivity measure 4-hour oral glucose tolerance test . Investigators intend use result study show feasibility measure mitochondrial function Duke large federal grant submission . Investigators hypothesize carnitine insufficiency might contribute mitochondrial dysfunction obesity-related impairment glucose tolerance insulin action .</brief_summary>
