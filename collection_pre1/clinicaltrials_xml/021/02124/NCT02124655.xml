	<brief_summary>The accumulation maturation oral biofilm gingival margin widely recognise primary aetiological factor development chronic gingivitis . Based association , current treatment gingivitis focus biofilm disruption , normally include mechanical process , professionally home . However , patient , easy achieve proper level plaque control . The efficient plaque control technique time consume require special motivation skill optimum use . It point mouthwashes become important , due fact include diverse type antimicrobial agent complement result mechanical oral hygiene measure . Chlorhexidine consider `` gold standard '' oral antiseptic ; nevertheless recommend long period time due well-known secondary effect . All inconvenience limit acceptability among dental professional user ; contrast , however , exceptional antiseptic property , promote interest researcher alternative antiplaque agent . Mouthwashes contain essential oil formulation receive lot attention . Their antiplaque activity demonstrate numerous clinical study , use conjunction mechanical oral hygiene measure . In order achieve good understand clinical effect antimicrobial agent produce interior biofilm , necessary apply methodology biofilm grow directly interior oral cavity three dimensional structure distort manipulation . The aim study evaluate situ antiplaque effect 2 antimicrobial agent ( essential oil formulation 0.2 % chlorhexidine ) short term posterior analysis `` non-destructured '' biofilm Confocal Laser Scanning Microscope combine fluorescence staining .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The volunteer wear two individualised splint capable hold 6 glass disk ( 6 mm diameter , 1 mm thickness ) ; polish 800 grit . . These splint form 2 sheet , internal 1 mm soft vinyl sheet disk attach external 1 mm rigid one make polyethylene terephtalate fenestrated . • Mouthwash protocol During 96 hour ( 4 day ) duration course study , volunteer wear splint glass disk , withdraw oral cavity meal ( store opaque container humid condition ) perform oral hygiene procedure , use mechanical removal bacterial plaque water , without use toothpaste mouthwash . Using permitted mechanical oral hygiene measure ( without splint ) , volunteer perform follow protocol base manufacturer ' instruction , splint oral cavity , 4 day morning ( 8.30 ) breakfast night ( 22.00 ) dinner : A ) 20 ml rinse 30 second essential oils/2 time daily . -- -- 14 day -- -- B ) 10 mL rinse 30 second 0.2 % chlorhexidine/2 time daily . -- -- 14 day -- -- C ) 20 mL rinse 30 second sterile water ( negative control ) . Using internet-based balance randomisation system , indicate mouthwash subject would use first , second third , volunteer perform 3 rinsing cycle , rest period 14 day test . • Collection sample Plaque like-biofilm Sample collection do individually 8 morning , sample volunteer analyse different day . It determine minimum 10 hour elapse since last mouthwash previous night . As glass disk remove splint , immediately immerse 100 µL fluorescence solution LIVE/DEAD® BacLight™ keep dark chamber room temperature 15 minute . Microscopic observation perform single investigator unaware study design , use Leica TCS SP2 laser scan spectral confocal microscope ( Leica Microsystems Heidelberg GmbH , Mannheim , Germany ) HCX APOL 63x/0.9 water-immersion lens . • Processing sample Plaque like-Biofilm Four select field XYZ series central part disk evaluate . These field consider representative whole sample observer 's general examination . Fluorescence emission determine series XY image image correspond Z position ( depth ) . The optical section scan 1 µm section surface biofilm base , measure maximum thickness field subsequently mean thickness biofilm correspond sample . The maximum thickness biofilm field define distance substrate ( perpendicular ) peak high cell cluster . The maximum biofilm thickness field divide 3 zone equivalent layer : outer layer ( layer 1 ) , middle layer ( layer 2 ) inner layer ( layer 3 ) . The capture data do setting case . The spatial scan mode ( XYZ ) 1024x1024 pixel scan format resolution use . The Argon-ion DPSS laser use 13 % 78 % maximum intensity , respectively . The value pinhole , zoom scan speed 121.58 micron , 1 400Hz , respectively . The value different depend sample offset ( range -1 % 1 % ) PMT gain different channel red green , general term , high green red ( test positive control ) , due fact presence green red signal , negative control opposite . These value always adjust get good quality capture without background noise , avoid excessive saturation bright pixel image . As technician blind experiment , advise make adjustment always consistent see objective microscope , obtain image close possible reality . Quantification bacterial vitality series XY image determine use cytofluorographic analysis ( Leica Confocal Software ) . In analysis , image fluorochrome define `` channel '' ( SYTO 9 occupies green channel propidium iodide red channel ) . Square capture mask use measure area occupy ( µm2 ) pixel channel , determine total area occupy biofilm corresponding percentage vitality . The intensity range consider positive signal 100 255 . Determination mean percentage bacterial vitality field require section minimum area biofilm 250 µm2 , mean percentage bacterial vitality biofilm calculate corresponding sample biofilm layer . For quantification percentage surface substrate cover biofilm ( cover grade ) , cytofluorogram use . From maximum projection ( superposition plane capture ) analyse field , percentage cover grade obtain calculate sum bacterial mass ( vital non-vital ) regard total surface field ( % positive within total area ) .</detailed_description>
