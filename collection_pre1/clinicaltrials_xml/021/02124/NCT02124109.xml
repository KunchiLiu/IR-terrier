	<brief_summary>Background : - An acquired heart disease one person get bear . Two rheumatic heart disease ( RHD ) endomyocardial fibrosis ( EMF ) . They find commonly people live Africa place world . Researchers want learn disease . They especially want know role gene factor play . Objective : - To identify genetic risk factor RHD EMF sub-Saharan Africa . Eligibility : - Children adult RHD EMF . - Healthy volunteer age 10 . Design : - Participants come exist study group Uganda Nigeria . - Participants may require provide sample DNA . They either blood saliva sample swab mouth . - Collected sample label code sent lab United States analysis . Remaining portion participant sample store unlimited period time . They may use future study . - Some genetic health information participant might place one scientific databases . - Participant name identify information keep private . But small chance someone could trace genetic information .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Recent advance genomic technique make possible new wave genetic discovery many complex disease . However , genetic risk factor two form acquire heart disease particularly common Africa - rheumatic heart disease ( RHD ) endomyocardial fibrosis ( EMF ) remain unknown . In application , propose evaluate genetic risk factor rheumatic heart disease ( RHD ) endomyocardial fibrosis ( EMF ) . A number factor facilitate identification genetic risk variant underlie two condition . First , form acquire heart disease endemic sub-Saharan Africa ( SSA ) . Second , affect patient develop condition share common environment . Finally , availability high density SNP array capture common rare variation make characterization genomic variation well ever . Patients enrol Uganda Heart Institute Kampala , Uganda , College Medicine , University Lagos , Nigeria , potential include African site . Genomic study do NIH .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>INCLUSION CRITERIA : Rheumatic Heart Disease : Patients definite diagnosis rheumatic heart disease base 2006 World Health Organization/National Institutes Health Joint Criteria ( http : //www.niaid.nih.gov/topics/strepThroat/Documents/groupasequelae.pdf ) control meet criterion . Uganda Heart Institute : Participants meet criterion note RHD consider case consider control . Additionally , parent invite participate control . For control , child age 10 consider increase likelihood exposure S. pyogenes . University Lagos : Participants meet criterion RHD consent case negative RHD consent control . Additionally , parent invite participate control . For control , child age 10 consider increase likelihood exposure S. pyogenes . Endomyocardial Fibrosis ( EMF ) : Cases : study include patient diagnosis EMF base echocardiography , history , physical exam perform cardiologist ; additionally , newly diagnose patient Uganda Heart Institute offer participation . Controls : Geographic age match control use association study . Controls disease free , base criterion . We exclude control le 15 year age base disease peak around age 10 . Controls select screen RHD EXCLUSION CRITERIA : Anyone unwilling provide inform consent ( adult , behalf child minor ) assent .</criteria>
