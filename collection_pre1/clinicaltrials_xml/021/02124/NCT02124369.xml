	<brief_summary>Pancreatic cancer difficult treat , even situation operation perform remove cancer , disease unfortunately come back soon afterwards . When pancreatic cancer advance , outcomes even less positive . Recently , large international study show combine chemotherapy drug standard treat pancreatic cancer , call gemcitabine new chemotherapy drug call Abraxane effective gemcitabine alone patient advance pancreatic cancer . The purpose study determine whether combination gemcitabine Abraxane shrink pancreatic cancer think operable enough enable remove surgery . It hop way , treatment may improve outcome . In addition , study would like analyse appearance tumour use imaging , collect blood tumour sample try confirm laboratory research carry treatment .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Pancreatic Resectability Cancers With Known Limited Extension ( PRICKLE )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This single-centre , non-randomised , phase 2a , single arm , Simon two-stage design trial nab-paclitaxel gemcitabine ( ABX/GEM ) patient histological documentation pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma ( PDAC ) determine central radiological review `` category 2 '' borderline unresectable LAPC . We investigate feasibility administer ABX/GEM term safety efficacy , study activity term radiological response feasibility downstaging patient `` category 1 '' status , order attempt resection 6 cycle combination treatment . In addition add data safety tolerability combination , peri- post-operative morbidity follow treatment evaluate . As part trial , detailed correlative study undertake evaluate mechanism action combination , tissue level , circulate biomarker level radiological level . We propose tumour shrinkage ( response ) see Stage IV pancreatic cancer patient result ABX/GEM may translate realistic prospect downstaging borderline unresectable LAPC tumour sufficiently enable resection . Notionally , even absence classical partial response RECIST criterion ( ≥30 % reduction sum long diameter ) beneficial outcome may arise tumour shrinkage sufficient permit tumour separate major vessel thus render resectable . Such outcome may significantly alter poor survival outcome group patient . The PRICKLE clinical study paradigm useful evaluate novel agent combination show impressive activity pre-clinical advance set offer opportunity detail correlative translational study evaluate activity therapy .</detailed_description>

Documented histological cytological diagnosis pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma . ECOG performance status 01 . Life expectancy least 12 week . Willing able comply schedule visit , treatment plan , laboratory test study procedure . Adequate haematological function define : Absolute neutrophil count ( ANC ) ≥1,500 cells/mm3 ( 1.5 x 109/L ) . Haemoglobin ≥8.0 g/dL ( 80 g/L ) ( may increase level transfusion long evidence active bleeding ) . Platelets ≥100x 109/L Adequate renal function define serum creatinine≤1.5 x ULN calculate creatinine clearance CockcroftGault ≥50 ml/min . Adequate hepatic function define : Aspartate aminotransferase ( AST ) and/or alanine aminotransferase ( ALT ) ≤2.5 x upper limit normal ( ULN ) Total bilirubin ≤1.5 x ULN Patients may endoscopic radiologic stenting treat biliary obstruction . If , bilirubin must return ≤1.5 x ULN prior enrolment . Received prior therapy disease . Measurable disease RECIST 1.1 criterion . Tumour assessment measurement must do within 28 day patient receives first dose ABX/GEM . All Women Child Bearing Potential ( WoCBP ) sexually active male patient must agree use effective contraception method throughout study 6 month final dose trial drug . Patients metastatic PDAC , disease amenable resection curative intent . These include tumour define Category 1 3 central radiological review . Other invasive malignancy diagnose within last 5 year , exception adequately treat localized cured prostate cancer , situ carcinoma cervix uteri basal squamous cell carcinoma skin . Cancer survivor , undergone potentially curative therapy prior malignancy , evidence disease three year deem negligible risk recurrence , eligible trial . Known allergy hypersensitivity ABX GEM . Routine use oral antioxidant supplement : betacarotene , selenium , lutein , zeaxanthin , lycopene , pycnogenol , fernblock , omega3S , vitamin C , vitamin E , astaxanthin . If recent use , washout period 5 halflives require . Patients preexistent ischemic heart disease particularly active treatment coronary disease , exclude Sonuvue dynamic contrast enhance ultrasound investigation due sporadic report cardiac ischemia population . They eligible rest study , long cardiac status preclude surgery . Significant acute chronic medical psychiatric condition , disease laboratory abnormality judgment Investigator would place patient undue risk interfere study . Examples include , limited : Patients venous thromboembolic event ( e.g. , pulmonary embolism deep vein thrombosis ) require anticoagulation appropriately anticoagulated NCI CTCAE ( version 4.0 ) Grade 2 great bleeding episode 4 week Day 1 . Patients take warfarin , unless possible patient switch low molecular weight heparin duration study Patients significant history stroke , unstable angina , myocardial infarction , ventricular arrhythmia require medication mechanical control within last 6 month .
