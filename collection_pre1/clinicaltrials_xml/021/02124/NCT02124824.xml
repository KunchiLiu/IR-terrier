	<brief_summary>Heart disease lead cause death United States , account one every four death 2010 cost $ 300 billion annually health care , medication , lose productivity . Heart failure ( HF ) , clinical syndrome develop consequence heart disease , characterize worsening symptom , dyspnea fatigue , upon exertion , collectively define `` exercise intolerance '' . Surprisingly , exercise intolerance correlate degree cardiac contractile ( ventricular ) dysfunction , suggest change peripheral circulation may blame exercise intolerance cohort . Though host factor may contribute impairment , disease-related increase circulate endothelin-1 ( ET-1 ) may significant factor sequela exercise intolerance HF . Thus , overall purpose Small Projects Rehabilitation Research ( SPiRE ) proposal explore contribution ET-1 chronic vasoconstriction HF patient , examine whether inhibition pathway could improve vasodilatory ability , thus exercise tolerance , Veterans HF .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Specific Aim 1 determine direct effect vascular endothelin-1 ( ET-1 ) skeletal muscle vasoconstriction HF age-matched control . Intra-arterial infusion ETA subtype receptor undertaken pharmacologically probe disease-related change ET-1 pathway rest exercise . It hypothesize ET-1-mediated vasoconstriction elevate HF compare control rest , ETA receptor blockade augment blood flow HF patient great degree age-matched control . During exercise , investigator anticipate inhibition ETA receptor augment skeletal muscle blood flow HF patient compare age-matched control , lead improve exercise tolerance reduce skeletal muscle fatigue patient group . Specific Aim 2 determine potentiate effect vascular endothelin-1 ( ET-1 ) sympathetic vasoconstriction HF age-matched control . At rest , investigator hypothesize infusion sympathomimetic drug ( norepinephrine , NE ) produce great vasoconstriction HF patient compare age-matched control , demonstrate hypersensitivity alpha-adrenergic receptor . Inhibition ETA receptor reduce `` sensitivity '' NE-mediated vasoconstriction HF patient towards age-matched control , identify ET-1 contributor alpha adrenergic hypersensitivity HF . During exercise , anticipate NE-mediated vasoconstriction great HF patient compare age-matched control . Inhibition ETA receptor reduce NE-mediated vasoconstriction exercise . This augment skeletal muscle blood flow , lead improve exercise tolerance reduce skeletal muscle fatigue HF patient . The investigator anticipate finding propose work ET-1 inhibition could thus provide `` miss link '' information investigator ' understanding skeletal muscle blood flow regulation exercise tolerance HF , ultimately lead enhance quality life cohort .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>General Inclusion/ The study group include subject history stable cardiomyopathy ( ischemic nonischemic , &gt; 3 month duration , age 4575 yr ) despite minimum 6 week optimal treatment . Optimal therapy accord AHA/ACC HFSA HF guideline , include treatment ACE blocker therapy ( least 6 week ) , document reason variation , include medication intolerance , contraindication , patient preference , personal physician 's judgment . Patient enrollment limited individual NYHA class II III symptom , LVEF &lt; 35 % , minimal smoke history ( &lt; 15 pk yr ) , without pacemaker . Patients atrial fibrillation HF believe secondary atrial fibrillation exclude . Patients HF secondary significant uncorrected primary valvular disease ( except mitral regurgitation secondary leave ventricular dysfunction ) also exclude . Patients sedentary , define regular physical activity least prior 6 month current activity level document activity questionnaire . Patients must orthopedic limitation would prohibit perform kneeextensor exercise . Due typical age patient HF , woman postmenopausal ( either natural surgical ) define cessation menses least 2 year , woman without uterus , follicle stimulate hormone ( FSH ) &gt; 40 IU/L . Women currently take hormone replacement therapy ( HRT ) exclude propose study due direct vascular effect HRT Comorbidity Exclusion Criteria : Patients significant noncardiac comorbidities , present could alter study result , exclude . These include diagnosis Dementia Severe COPD Peripheral Vascular Disease Anemia Sleeprelated Breathing Disorder Severe Valvular Heart Disease Diabetes ( insulin therapy ) Endstage Malignancy The investigator also exclude morbidly obese patient ( BMI &gt; 35 ) , patient uncontrolled Hypertension ( &gt; 160/100 ) , Anemia ( Hgb &lt; 9 ) Severe Renal Insufficiency ( individual creatinine clearance &lt; 30 CockcroftGault formula ) .</criteria>
