	<brief_title>Intra-abdominal Pressure Monitoring Patients With Open Abdomen Undergoing Early Closure</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The detrimental effect elevate intra-abdominal compartment pressure know time actively manage surgical critical care physician . Similarly , well know occasionally abdomen immediately close patient due concern elevate intra-abdominal pressure ongoing contamination ; patient typically stay hospital , often expensive ICU 's final closure - even , patient get definitive reconstruction abdominal wall many month later , add expense care . Thus , move give patient early , aggressive closure abdomen , often use combination negative pressure wound therapy biologic mesh . Currently group patient early aggressive closure incompletely study ; although abdominal compartment pressure measurement routinely make , commonly do intra-operatively closure perform ; patient study continuous monitoring . This especially striking consider occlusive nature negative wound therapy dressing : anecdotal increase abdominal pressure note patient , sometimes dangerous level . As accumulate evidence diligent management intra-abdominal pressure improve outcome variety patient , opportunity apply accurate monitoring patient group also likely benefit . The investigator propose prospective observational study patient unable definitively close time surgery candidate early aggressive abdominal closure . The investigator monitor abdominal pressure use AbViser continuous abdominal pressure monitoring device ascertain whether episode intra-abdominal hypertension patient , whether improves definitive closure . The research team attempt correlate abdominal pressure measurement outcomes . Finally team compare patient historical control use propensity score explore difference outcome . Intra-abdominal pressure monitoring initiated patient identify require open abdomen . The monitoring do patient 's abdominal wound close elevated measurement . Once patient discharge intensive care unit , AbViser system discontinue . Patients continue follow duration hospital stay outcome measure assess discharge hospital , expect average 2 - 3 week .</detailed_description>
