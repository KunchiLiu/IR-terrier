	<brief_summary>Objectives : The overall study objective compare sensitivity specificities morphometric analysis technique use structural MRI image base pre- postsurgical localization epileptic focus patient undergoing presurgical evaluation medically refractory epilepsy . To carry analysis , aim establish age-stratified normative imaging database use healthy volunteer . Additional objective identify abnormal network patient use rest state fMRI/EEG MEG/EEG , use language memory fMRI task examine effect epileptogenic zone surgery cognitive function network associate function . Study population : 150 adult child ( age 8-65 ) uncontrolled focal epilepsy , 100 age-stratified healthy volunteer . Design : A retrospective prospective natural history study . Research procedures patient study include neuropsychological test 1-4 MRI session presurgical evaluation additional 1-3 MRI session neuropsychological test approximately 12 month post-operatively . Research test ( research neuropsychological test MRI scan sequence ) do visit clinical test whenever possible , likely reduce number require visit . Patients also optional MEG 7T structural imaging . Data also obtain patient already undergone epilepsy surgery procedure outline protocol willing share data . Healthy volunteer receive subset pre-operative procedure patient , require least 3 visit . In order ensure adequate data acquisition , subject may re-scanned three time portion study participate , possibly require additional visit . Outcome measure : The main outcome establishment normative value morphometric analysis method age-stratified normal control , comparison sensitivity specificity measure pre- postsurgical localization epileptogenic zone . Secondary outcome measure include determination sensitivity specificity source localization use MEG/EEG rest state fMRI/EEG , evaluate change activation rest , well language memory fMRI task patient pre- postsurgically , examine effect epileptogenic zone surgery cognitive function network underlie function .</brief_summary>
