	<brief_title>Efficacy Azithromycin Treatment Bronchiectasis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Previous study various macrolides small sample size report benefit reduction sputum volume bronchiectasis patient . However , macrolide therapy could yet confidently use treat bronchiectasis , give diffuse nature finding . These study wide range hypothesis , necessarily focus anti-inflammatory effect macrolides . Furthermore , study number , placebo-controlled double-blinded . This , combine small sample size use , limit reliability result . This study aim expand limit publish finding investigate large sample population different endpoint . Sputum volume quality life select important variable aid assess efficacy . This study aim independent previous study number way . This study bronchiectasis patient formally investigate quality life treatment macrolide , potential carryover effect azithromycin therapy . This study also expand finding previous study macrolides bronchiectasis incorporating large sample size trial .</detailed_description>
