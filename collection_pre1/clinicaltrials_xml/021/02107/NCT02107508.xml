	<brief_summary>Obesity increase rapidly world adult also among child . As modifiable component total energy expenditure ( TEE ) , amount energy expended physical activity play important role prevent weight gain . Decreased physical activity , couple over-consumption calorie , lead change body composition store energy fat.Although several study simultaneously examine body composition energy expenditure independent role body composition activity energy expenditure ( AEE ) less firmly establish . It 's suspect shrewdly energy expenditure partly influence body composition . The aim study examine relation AEE body composition population school-age child .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Body composition ( ie . FAT % FFM ) evaluate mean bioelectrical impedance analysis ( BIA ) Inbody 720 ( Biospace , Seoul , South Korea ) . Anthropometric dimension record participant accord standard procedure . Height record near 1.0mm use field stadiometer ( Seca Corporation , Germany ) . FitMate metabolic system ( Cosmed , Rome , Italy ) use estimate AEE . Subjects test 10-minute submaximal exercise test use FitMate system take cycling test 50 Watts electrically brake bicycle ergometer . Each subject connect calibrate respiratory gas analyzer , portable metabolic analyzer design measurement oxygen consumption exercise via face mask . Heart rate simultaneously measure use Cosmed wireless HR monitor track participant 's heart rate level .</detailed_description>
