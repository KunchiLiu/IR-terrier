	<brief_summary>This phase II trial study effectiveness combination stereotactic radiation therapy ipilimumab patient metastatic melanoma spread four few site body ( oligometastatic ) . Stereotactic radiation therapy type external beam radiation therapy use special equipment position patient precisely give either single large dose radiation therapy tumor several large dos radiation therapy tumor use precision accuracy guide onboard daily image prior radiation therapy . Monoclonal antibody , ipilimumab , block tumor growth different way . Some monoclonal antibody find tumor cell help kill carry tumor-killing substance . Giving stereotactic radiosurgery together ipilimumab may kill tumor cell cause addition melanoma antigen present immune system .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To determine progression-free survival patient oligometastatic melanoma treat combination stereotactic ablative radiation therapy ( SABR ) ( stereotactic radiosurgery ) ipilimumab patient oligometastatic melanoma use modified World Health Organization ( mWHO ) criterion . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . To evaluate 6-month progression-free survival combination SABR 3 mg/kg ipilimumab patient oligometastatic melanoma use immune relate response criterion ( irRC ) criterion . II . To evaluate tolerability safety combination . III . To evaluate response rate base mWHO &amp; irRC criterion . IV . To evaluate local control rate . V. To evaluate overall survival rate . TERTIARY OBJECTIVES : I . Evaluate change blood serum marker : absolute lymphocyte count , T-cell activation marker , T-cell suppression marker , T-helper cell related cytokine , T-regulatory ( T-reg ) marker , co-stimulatory molecule , serum cytokine SABR add ipilimumab regimen . II . Evaluate genomic deoxyribonucleic acid ( DNA ) mutation key melanoma gene correlation response , progression-free survival , overall survival . OUTLINE : Patients receive ipilimumab intravenously ( IV ) 90 minute day 1 week 1 , 4 , 7 , 10 . Treatment repeat every 3 week 4 total dos absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . At approximately 5-6 week , patient undergo stereotactic radiosurgery 2-3 day per week . Patients stable disease confirm partial complete response completion ipilimumab therapy week 12 may receive re-induction ipilimumab discretion treat physician . After completion study treatment , patient follow 30 90 day , every 3 month 2 year , every 6 month 3 year , annually 5 year .</detailed_description>
