For first sampling period , control hyperglycemia induce withdraw insulin provide high carbohydrate load diet ( 70-75 % carbohydrate ) . Hyperglycemia exceed 9 hour , reverse reinstituting insulin . The second sampling period , also 24 hour , perform condition euglycemic control . During two sample period , sample withdraw via venous catheter RBC deformability vitamin C concentration .
