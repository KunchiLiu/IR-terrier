	<detailed_description>This Phase 3 , multicenter , open-label , safety efficacy study ataluren patient nonsense mutation cystic fibrosis participate previous Phase 3 study ataluren ( PTC124-GD-009-CF ; Study 009 ) . The primary objective study determine long-term safety tolerability ataluren patient nmCF , assessed adverse event laboratory abnormality . The secondary objective study include assessment efficacy ataluren , measure FEV1 pulmonary exacerbation rate , change baseline safety parameter ( eg , 12-lead ECG measurement , vital sign ) . Study subject enrol approximately 17 site United States , Europe Israel previously participate Study PTC124-GD-009-CF . All study subject receive 10- , 10- , 20-mg/kg ataluren ( PTC124 ) 3 time per day ( morning , midday evening , respectively ) 192 week .
