	<brief_summary>The main aim research investigate whether use cognitive event-related potential interest way identify subgroup alcoholic patient display specific clinical symptom cognitive disturbance order help clinicians adapt pharmaceutical approach specific need patient . Nowadays , fundamental question remain : How investigator identify among alcoholic patient likely benefit use naltrexone , acamprosate baclofen , ? The goal application identify subgroup alcoholic patient display specific clinical symptom cognitive disturbance link consistent biological marker . Investigators propose might help clinician improve treatment alcoholic patient focus therapy individual cognitive disturbance , adapt pharmaceutical approach identify brain pathophysiology . In word , investigator suggest specify cognitive profile individual patient may help clinicians choice suitable drug program . To reach aim , investigator suggest join investigation early ( P100 ) late ( P300 ) brain event-related potential ( ERP ) component may help create subgroup alcoholic patient homogenous cognitive deficit , `` classification '' might help optimize drug treatment . More precisely , investigator suggest relapse chronic alcoholism partly due ( 1 ) preferential attentional allocation alcohol-related information ( e.g . sight bottle wine ) . As P100 component already show enhance motivationally relevant stimulus , investigator think component well-suited purpose ; ( 2 ) impairment inhibitory control , necessary suppress inappropriate prepotent response . The Go/No-Go task simple procedure , already proven highly reliable evidence deficit inhibitory control process alcoholic , indexed No-Go P3 decrease amplitude less anterior topography . In summary , investigator two simple experimental procedure , oddball task Go/No-Go task , easily carry clinical setting , provide interest data concerning , respectively , existence implicit attentional bias towards alcohol-cues deficit inhibitory control towards prepotent response , observation well-known well-described cognitive ERP component , i.e . P100 P3b component . The main goal project test effect different drug medication attentional ( P100 ) inhibitory ( P300 ) deficits observable alcoholic patient .</brief_summary>
