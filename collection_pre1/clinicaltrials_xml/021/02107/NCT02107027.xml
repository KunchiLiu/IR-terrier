	<brief_summary>The aim study compare two type ablation catheter pulmonary vein isolation ( PVI ) subject atrial fibrillation . Currently , two technology irrigate ablation catheter available PVI . One two , `` conventional '' catheter widely use atrial fibrillation ( AF ) treatment specifically create pulmonary vein isolation , therefore , point point encircle lesion cumbersome time consume . The second new ablation catheter circular shape provide 10 irrigated electrode design create encircle lesion , necessary obtain pulmonary vein isolation , could allow easy fast isolation compare conventional way . These two type catheter never compare atrial fibrillation . If one two catheter appear efficient cause few complication , use catheter could favor conduct AF ablation .</brief_summary>
