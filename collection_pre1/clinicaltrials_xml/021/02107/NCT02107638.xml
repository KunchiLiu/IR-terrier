	<brief_summary>Parkinson 's disease ( PD ) define progressive disorder nervous system affect patient 's mobility , balance cognition . Tremor , slow movement , rigidity physical symptom contribute postural gait abnormality see many PD patient . Other symptom include loss balance restrict range motion , increase risk fall . Osteopathic manipulative medicine ( OMM ) form manual treatment provide osteopathic physician . This form treatment aim help decrease muscle spasm improve joint range motion movement . We propose pilot study investigate impact OMM balance , motor function , fall PD patient . We also go screen serum biomarker change investigate potential effect OMM . Our research team institution experience provide osteopathic care physical rehabilitation PD patient . In study , balance motor function evaluate subject throughout study period . We also keep track number fall . Balance measure use Sensory Organization Test ( SOT ) motor function measure use Movement Disorder Society Unified Parkinson 's Disease Rating Scale ( MDS-UPDRS ) . Both tools non-invasive clinically proven method measure balance motor function .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Annually , 60,000 people within United States diagnose PD.1 The cardinal feature PD include rest tremor , rigidity , asymmetric onset , bradykinesia.2 These characteristic appear affect balance . Balance complex system involve maintain posture , facilitate movement , recover equilibrium control one 's body within limit stability . Balance involve coordination vestibular , visual , auditory , motor , high level premotor system , many compromise PD.3 Previous research find 46 % PD subject fell within three month period , 21 % subject first fall three month period.4 Postural instability hallmark sign PD compromise balance control increase risk falling.5,6 Many fall PD occur postural instability inability organize sensory information . The SOT identifies abnormalities postural control , somatosensory , visual , vestibular sensory system . It offer composite score percentage base normal age control . We recently present abstract World Parkinson 's Conference Montreal , Canada show individual 's PD ( n=20 ) categorize faller , score low SOT non-fallers PD.7 The pathogenesis PD progressive neurologic depletion dopaminergic neuron basal ganglia manifest common motor extrapyramidal sign : tremor , bradykinesia , rigidity . As severity PD progress frequently postural instability disability . There relatively study investigate effect OMM PD patient . One previous research study demonstrate single session osteopathic manipulative medicine protocol 10 PD subject improve gait compare age-matched sham-controls , particularly stride length , cadence , maximum velocity upper low extremities.8 Other study non-PD subject show OMM improve subject balance . In pilot study 20 elderly subject OMM protocol apply weekly four week show improvement postural instability , measure change anterior-posterior medial-lateral sway force plate observations.9 OMM also show improve subject dizziness . The outcome measure use SMART Balance Master© . It find composite score SMART Balance Master© significantly improve immediately intervention well one week later . ( P &lt; .001 ) 10 OMM utilized improve gait PD patient address muscle hypertonicity joint motion restriction use muscle energy articulatory technique spine extremities.8 OMM technique use address balance focus remove muscle spasm restriction spine cranium . Based experience treat PD patient clinical practice improvement symptom forementioned study develop PARK-OMM protocol utilize study . The protocol start CV4 technique , help address cranial restriction , potentially affect patient 's autonomic function.11,12 The protocol proceeds address major spinal region extremity decrease muscle hypertonicity increase joint range motion direct OMM articulatory muscle energy technique . These technique select due document efficacy improve joint mobility general population well PD clinical practice document prior studies.13 Hypothesis : OMM treatment twice week 6-week period PD subject use define OMM protocol produce prolonged improvement motor function measure Movement Disorders Society 's Unified Parkinson 's Disease Rating Scale ( MDS-UPDRS ) balance measure NeurCom SMART Balance Master© Sensory Organization Test ( SOT ) lead reduce number fall . We also go screen serum biomarker change investigate potential effect OMM . We expect OMM cohort significantly improve motor function score , balance , associate decrease fall . This would help establish role OMM treatment PD . Positive finding may also lead additional study investigate OMM impact quality life PD patient . It could also promote investigation potential mechanism OMM amongst PD population .</detailed_description>
