	<brief_summary>The investigational drug study protocol Incobotulinumtoxin A ( Xeomin® ) . Botulinum toxin ( BoNT ) prevent release acetylcholine peripheral nerve , inhibit muscle contraction . BoNT effective relax overactive muscle . In musician 's dystonia , ability reduce abnormally overactive muscle hand critical musical professional continue career . With use EMG/electrical stimulation and/or ultrasound guidance , injector precisely localize individual muscle affect condition great accuracy . Prior study show BoNT injection produce beneficial effect forearm muscle , less effect shoulder proximal arm muscle . Possible risk treat patient BoNT include excessive weakness inject muscle . The drug may also affect non-targeted muscle . However risk minimize screening period carefully target affected muscle administer low dos BoNT . Small booster dos may give follow visit ( 2 , 4 , 14 16-weeks primary injection date ) initial injection insufficient produce sufficient efficacy relief focal dystonia produce excess weakness target muscle .</brief_summary>
