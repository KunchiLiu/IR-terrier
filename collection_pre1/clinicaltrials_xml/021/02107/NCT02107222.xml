	<brief_summary>A Multicenter , Randomized , Controlled Trial Determine Safety Efficacy Pump Assisted Lung Protection ( PALP™ ) Low Flow Carbon Dioxide ( CO2 ) Removal Conjunction Liberation Mechanical Ventilation Compared Mechanical Ventilation Alone Patients COPD Exacerbation Respiratory Failure</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>The PALP™-COPD Trial ( Low-Flow CO2-Removal ( ECCO2-R ) Exacerbated COPD )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Primary Study Objectives • To evaluate clinical effect PALP™ reducing time invasive ventilation patient exacerbation COPD require invasive mechanical ventilation . Secondary Study Objectives - To evaluate safety tolerability PALP™ patient exacerbation COPD require invasive mechanical ventilation . - To determine rate adverse event ( AEs ) reduce patient receive PALP™ invasive mechanical ventilation v invasive mechanical ventilation alone . - To determine mortality rate patient receive PALP™ invasive mechanical ventilation v invasive mechanical ventilation alone . - To determine PALP™ effectively reduce number subsequent acute decompensations require hospital admission ventilatory support ( invasive noninvasive ) .</detailed_description>
