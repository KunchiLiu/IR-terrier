	<brief_title>Study TENS Reducing Symptoms Peripheral Neuropathy Induced Chemotherapy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Chemotherapy-induced peripheral neuropathy ( CIPN ) result damage dysfunction peripheral nerve one common side effect antineoplastic chemotherapy neurotoxic drug use . Pain paresthesia symptom prevalent , cause chronic discomfort loss functional ability whilst also interfere negatively quality life patient 's autonomy . In pilot study patient CIPN , evidence Transcutaneous Electrical Nerve Stimulation ( TENS ) improve painful symptom patient CIPN . This study aim investigate effect TENS reduce symptom pain numbness improve daily life cancer patient CIPN . 1 . Primary Objectives Evaluate effect TENS reduction symptom related peripheral neuropathy due chemotherapy treatment high moderate neurotoxic potential cancer patient . Secondary Objectives : - Evaluate therapeutic response TENS frequency variation ( FV ) symptoms paresthesia - Evaluate therapeutic response TENS frequency variation ( FV ) activity daily live patient - Evaluate therapeutic response TENS frequency variation ( FV ) symptoms neuropathic pain . - Evaluate factor associate well treatment response paresthesia , pain activity daily live . Eligibility criterion : The participant research include patient cancer diagnosis subject chemotherapy either adjuvant neoadjuvant therapy , contain protocol least one chemotherapeutic drug moderate high neurotoxic potential . The participant research receive TENS within follow parameter : VF mode TENS variable frequency 7 Hz 65 Hz . It pulse width 200 µs , high tolerable intensity still remain comfortable patient . It application time 60 minute high tolerable intensity , still remain comfortable patient . The treatment give day chemotherapy , give home within 3 cycle . The participant divide 2 group : Experimental Group ( EG ) administer active TENS Control Group ( CG ) administer placebo TENS . The evaluation effect measure follow instrument : Classification neuropathy CTCAE ( Common Terminology Criteria Adverse Events ) version 4.02 2009 , scale functionality ECOG , Questionnaire Neurotoxicity Induced Antineoplastics ( QNIA ) evaluation symptom CIPN , Analogue Visual Scale ( AVS ) ass symptom pain paresthesia . The error α estimate 5 % .</detailed_description>

Patients without Diabetes Mellitus chemotherapy treatment . Patients undergone previous chemotherapy regimen neurotoxic drug . Patients ECOG performance status ≤ 2 ( Karnofsky ≥ 50 % ) . Patients cardiac pacemaker . Patients without change sensitivity prior chemotherapy . Patients without skin lesion site around site application electrode . Patients without cognitive comprehension difficulty . Agree participate study sign Free Clarified Term Consent FCTC Patients already undergone chemotherapy previously drug association neurotoxic drug present neuropathic pain and/or sensory peripheral neuropathy . Patients previously acupuncture treatment neuropathic pain and/or sensory peripheral neuropathy .</criteria>
