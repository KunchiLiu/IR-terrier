	<brief_title>SGI-110 Higher Risk Myelodysplastic Syndrome ( MDS )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Study Drug Administration : If find eligible take part study , receive injection SGI-110 skin 5 day every study cycle . Each study cycle 4-8 week depend tolerate drug disease respond . The study staff tell often receive drug . You need stay Houston receive study drug , may return home finish dose cycle . When study visit receive study drug ( describe ) , test perform visit perform local doctor . Study Visits : On Day 1 every cycle , physical exam . At Cycle 1 , need screen physical exam perform within 2 day visit . Every week first cycle , every 2-8 week , blood ( 1/2 teaspoon ) drawn routine test . The study doctor tell often need test perform . At end Cycle 1 and/or 2 , bone marrow aspirate check status disease . If disease appear get well end Cycle 2 , next bone marrow aspirate depend result blood test . These sample also use cytogenetic testing . Cytogenetic test look change cell DNA ( genetic material ) may affect disease may react study drug . Length Study : You study 24 cycle ( 2-4 year ) . You longer able receive study drug disease get bad , intolerable side effect occur , unable follow study direction . Follow-up Visits : About 30 day last dose study drug , every 2 month , call member study team ask feeling . Each call last 10 minute . This investigational study . SGI-110 FDA approve commercially available . It currently use research purpose . The study doctor explain study drug design work . Up 100 patient take part study . All enrol MD Anderson .</detailed_description>

Have severe concurrent disease , history serious organ dysfunction disease involve heart , kidney , liver , organ system may place patient undue risk undergo treatment . 4 . Patients systemic fungal , bacterial , viral , infection control ( define exhibit ongoing signs/symptoms related infection without improvement , despite appropriate antibiotic treatment ) . 5 . Pregnant lactating patient . 6 . Any significant concurrent disease , illness , psychiatric disorder would compromise patient safety compliance , interfere consent , study participation , follow , interpretation study result . 7 .
