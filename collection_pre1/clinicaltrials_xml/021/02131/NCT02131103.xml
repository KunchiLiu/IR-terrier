	<brief_summary>1 . Objective : To evaluate short- long-term STEMI patient successfully thrombolysis early routine delay percutaneous coronary intervention low-intermediate risk patient . 2 . Educational/ application advantage : To evaluate time early delay PCI receive fibrinolysis effect short- long-term clinical outcome low- intermediate GRACE risk score patient . No available randomize control study group patient .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>1.Research design : Intervention trial 1.1 Study domain : STEMI patient receive fibrinolysis reperfusion therapy 1.2 Target population : STEMI patient receive percutaneous coronary intervention fibrinolysis Lampang Regional hospital Maharaj Nakorn Chiang Mai hospital . 1.3 Study population : STEMI patient receive percutaneous coronary intervention fibrinolysis year 2013-2014 Lampang Regional hospital Maharaj Nakorn Chiang Mai hospital Inclusion criterion : 1 . The patient receive percutaneous coronary intervention fibrinolysis 2 . Adult patient age 18 year old 3 . GRACE risk score le 155 ( low-intermediate risk ) Exclusion criterion : 1 . The patient receive primary PCI rescue PCI 2 . The patient previous history coronary-artery bypass surgery 3 . The high risk patient ( cardiogenic shock , complete heart block , GRACE ≥155 ) 1.4 Occurrence relation Y ( Composite outcomes ) = f ( Treatment early vs. delay | confounders ) 1.5 Setting : The study conduct Lampang Regional hospital Maharaj Nakorn Chiang Mai hospital . 1.6 Determinant ( x ) : Time percutaneous coronary intervention ( early vs. delay ) . 1.7 Events ( ) : composite outcome ( include death , re-infarction , recurrent ischemia ) , re-hospitalized ACS , worsen heart failure .</detailed_description>
