	<brief_summary>Crohn 's disease ulcerative colitis inflammatory disorder gut cause major life-long disability . They affect male female , common age onset childhood , teens early adult life . Previously restrict almost exclusively West , condition become much common Asian country , include Hong Kong - cause dramatic change unknown . The cause IBD widely accept relate mucosal immune response stimulation gut bacteria , background genetic susceptibility . The bacteria organism gut play central role development IBD West . However unknown gut bacteria differ Chinese patient IBD non-IBD ( healthy subject ) Hong Kong , whether affect diet change diet . A family history large risk factor disease . More 50 different gene associate IBD recently identify West preliminary data show Chinese patient different genetic profile Western population . This project aim explore true incidence IBD Hong Kong factor may contribute , cause , increase IBD Hong Kong . Investigators aim investigate number new case IBD within five year period factor may account case . Investigators also study choice medical therapy , quality life quality health care patient IBD .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Epidemiology IBD Hong Kong : An Inception Cohort Follow Study</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Investigators create first web-based Hong Kong inception cohort database . Via web registration investigator intend form new prospective , uniformly diagnose , population-based inception cohort patient IBD . Physicians , gastroenterologist , family doctor , surgeon pathologist study area notify repeatedly study letter , telephone , internet , personal visit investigator , encourage inform investigator every possible new case IBD ( persistent relapse diarrhoea , blood and/or mucus stool three week , abdominal pain weight loss ) . Endoscopic , pathology radiology record canvass repeatedly likely case , electronically manually . By method investigator intend capture 90 % possible case . New patient include five-year period , 01.04.2011 - 31.03.2016 , follow five year follow-up period 31.03.2021 . All patient require meet diagnostic criterion IBD basis clinical symptom , endoscopic radiological evidence mucosal biopsy . Infectious gastroenteritis , tuberculosis , entamoeba cancer rule . The web-based Database application use online registration various registration form questionnaire ( see list additional material ) , database locate central secure server .</detailed_description>
