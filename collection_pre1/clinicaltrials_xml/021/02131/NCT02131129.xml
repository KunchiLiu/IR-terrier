	<detailed_description>Schizophrenia chronic disable illness typically begin late teen early adult years.1 This illness associate significant impairment area independent living , social functioning , vocational functioning.2 Indeed , 10 % people schizophrenia employ , translate annual lose wage nearly 15 billion dollars.3,4 Schizophrenia also represent important societal burden illness estimate cost 40 billion dollar year United States alone.5 Repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation ( rTMS ) novel treatment neuropsychiatric illness . A non-invasive intervention , rTMS utilizes application repetitively pulse magnetic field scalp induce electric field within discrete area cerebral cortex . This electric field result alter ion flow across neuronal cellular membrane ultimately change neuronal polarization . The end result alter neuronal activity area cerebral cortex rTMS applied.12 rTMS safe well-tolerated intervention receive FDA approval treatment refractory major depressive disorder 2008 since become commonly used clinical practice.13 This study propose examine application rTMS treatment cognitive dysfunction FEP . This important population study effective , rTMS may represent preventative treatment development social vocational impairment associate cognitive dysfunction schizophrenia . This study also seek refine understanding brain circuitry mediate potential pro-cognitive effect rTMS use functional magnetic resonance imaging ( fMRI ) baseline follow course rTMS administration .</detailed_description>
