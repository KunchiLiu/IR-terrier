While botulinum toxin injection improve symptom , require repeated injection train physician patient stop respond injection never respond . Therefore , alternative treatment option CD need . One new agent drug target glutamate receptor think involve dystonia . This drug , perampanel , originally develop epilepsy license use USA Canada treat epilepsy .

	<detailed_description>Idiopathic cervical dystonia ( CD ) common form focal dystonia prevalence approximately 60 case per million population . ( Nutt et al.,1988 ) . Current oral medical treatment CD variable efficacy often mark side effect . Botulinum toxin injection may effective pharmacological therapy , currently best available therapeutic option . However , repeat injection , administer physician trained area require every 3-4 month . ( Brans et al.,1996 ) This often difficult costly patient . Furthermore , subgroups patient simply respond treatment 5-20 % patient may become secondary non responder due development block antibody botulinum toxin . ( Mejia et al. , 2005 ) Thus , new therapeutic option require . The neural mechanism underlie idiopathic dystonia well know . Classical basal ganglion circuitry model predict underactivity output region basal ganglion , medial globus pallidus substantia nigra par reticulata ( ; Mitchell et al 1990 ) . In subject dystonia undergo DBS , intraoperative recording demonstrate underactivity medial globus pallidus ( Vitek et al , 1999 , Lozano et al 1997 ) . One mechanism responsible basal ganglion output change may overactivity corticostriatal glutamatergic pathway , similar neural mechanism think underlie hyperkinetic movement ( Brotchie 2005 ) . The best studied hyperkinetic movement disorder levodopa-induced dyskinesia Parkinson 's disease dystonia , often head neck , may occur . In animal model levodopa-induced dyskinesia , increase striatal glutamatergic signal via alpha-amino-2,3-dihydro-5-methyl-3-oxo-4-isoxazolepropanoic acid ( AMPA ) receptor demonstrate ( Perier et al 2002 , Silverdale et al 2010 ) . To date validate animal model idiopathic dystonia . However , one model use pharmacological study , result extrapolate idiopathic dystonia , paroxysmal dt ( sz ) dystonic hamster ( Loscher Richter 1998 ) . In model , intrastriatal systemic injection NBQX selective AMPA receptor antagonist reduce dystonic severity ( Richter et al 1993 , Sander Richter 2002 , Kohling et al 2004 ) . Other study suggest cerebellar outflow pathway , use AMPA receptor may also mediate dystonic symptom . Thus excitatory amino-acid kainite inject rodent cerebellar vermis result dystonic symptom , effect revere NBQX , suggest action AMPA receptor ( Pizoli et al 2002 ) . Thus AMPA receptor antagonist may alleviate dystonia . To date , clinical study use glutamate antagonist CD limit due lack available drug . A single 6-week open-label pilot study non-selective glutamate antagonist riluzole ( 50 mg twice day ) six patient cervical dystonia ( CD ) report 26 % improvement CD side-effects ( Muller et al 2002 ) . The aim study conduct multicentre phase I/IIa open label study determine safety tolerability AMPA antagonist , perampanel subject primary cervical dystonia . Exploratory analysis determine effect dystonia disability subjective measure include quality life global impression change . The importance initial safety study due lack knowledge relate use class drug ( AMPA antagonist ) population patient . The long term aim thus generate preliminary data randomise control efficacy study .</detailed_description>
