	<brief_summary>Preserving kidney function removal kidney tumor become increasingly important rate chronic kidney disease increase . A novel modifiable factor ( suture closure defect cause tumor removal ) discover retrospective study account nearly two-thirds 15 % volume loss commonly see operate kidney . We hypothesize randomize controlled surgical trial show omitting suture closure preserve renal function lead unreasonable postoperative complication .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Investigating Novel Modifiable Factor Affecting Renal Function After Partial Nephrectomy : Cortical Renorrhaphy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Purpose : To evaluate never study modifiable factor affect renal function partial nephrectomy : suture closure renal cortex tumor removal ( renorrhaphy ) . Background : There increase interest preserve renal function remove renal tumor . This partly due study link chronic kidney disease cardiovascular event overall survival . There approximate loss 10 % overall renal function partial nephrectomy along loss 15 % volume operate kidney . Studies point 3 factor leading loss renal function partial nephrectomy : 1 ) Poor preoperative renal function , 2 ) Ischemia time ( clamp renal blood vessel decrease bleed surgery , 3 ) Loss renal volume surgery . The factor consider modifiable ischemia time , especially 20-25-minutes duration . Modern technique aid keep ischemia time 25-minute cutoff . Leading expert institution Cleveland Clinic , The University Southern California , The Mayo Clinic conclude important factor preserve renal function , renal volume loss , modifiable . Specific Aims : Our question : remove non-functional tissue ( tumor ) loss renal volume ( 15 % ) function ( 10 % ) ? We hypothesize omit one particular step surgery , sew close defect cause tumor removal , able improve renal volume loss function ( RENORRHAPHY CLIP http : //youtu.be/NXOtUHdigj4 ) . Indiana University unique position study hypothesis two surgeon routinely omit closing defect leave tumor removal ( NO RENORRHAPHY CLIP http : //youtu.be/ZisMjrm85s8 ) . In recently accept abstract , discover omit cortical closure ( n=28 ) result 0.8 % loss glomerular filtration rate use closure result 7.3 % loss ( p=0.03 ) . Following discovery 3D modeling project perform isolate volume loss operate kidney use pre- postoperative CT scan ( yet publish ) . In study , discover 15 % volume loss cortical closure ( n=38 ) compare 5 % loss without closure ( n=20 , p &lt; 0.001 ) . Bias confounders completely remove retrospective data make hard believe others consider hypothesis without randomize control trial ( RCT ) . We propose RCT robotic partial nephrectomy ( 20 stitch closure vs. 20 stitch closure ) primary outcome volume change affect kidney .</detailed_description>
