	<brief_summary>Background : Balance control rely accurate perception visual , somatosensory vestibular cue . Sensory flow impair Multiple Sclerosis ( MS ) little known ability sensory system adapt neurological lesion reduce sensory impairment . The aims present study verify whether : 1 . Balance rehabilitation administer challenging sensory condition would improve stability upright posture 2. improvement treat sensory condition would transfer non treated sensory condition . Methods : Fifty three person Multiple Sclerosis , median ( min-max ) Expanded Disability Status Scale score 5 ( 2.5-6.5 ) , participate Randomized Controlled Trial randomly assign two group . The Experimental group receive balance rehabilitation aim improve motor sensory strategy . The Control group receive rehabilitation treatment include train sensory strategy . Persons Multiple Sclerosis blindly assess mean stabilometric platform eye open , eye close dome , firm surface foam . Anterior-posterior medio-lateral sway , velocity sway length Center Pressure ( CoP ) trajectory calculate six sensory condition .</brief_summary>
