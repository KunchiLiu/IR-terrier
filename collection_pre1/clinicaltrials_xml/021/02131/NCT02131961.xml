	<brief_title>EZCast-DFU Study With Portal Application Topical Medications</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The accepted care diabetic foot ulcer include clean wound dead die tissue around wind , daily wound care , good nutrition , adequate relief pressure . Pressure reduction , commonly know `` off-loading , '' often achieve patient wear `` off-loading boot '' . However , use cast similar cast use treat broken bone result less activity well wound heal . The cast consider best method off-loading foot use often method cast cover foot ulcer allow perform daily clean examination . This study apply Total Contact Cast ( TCC ) System leave open ulcer treat daily basis investigator . Patients ask apply ointment call Santyl ® ulcer daily basis . Santyl ® ointment FDA approve drug routinely used foot ulcer . The Santyl ® ointment clean wound promote well environment wound heal . It help remove nonliving tissue without harm new heal tissue . Trial last 14 day consist 4 visit . In first visit , patient ' wound clean dead die tissue ( debridement ) first modify contact cast apply . Patients provide Santyl apply daily reapplication foam dress . Patients return day 3 , weekly 2 week standard evaluation debridement wound measurement day 3 , week 1 visit reapplication modify contact cast .</detailed_description>
