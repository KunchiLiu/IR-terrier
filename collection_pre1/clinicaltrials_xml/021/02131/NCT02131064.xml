	<brief_summary>In randomize , multicenter , open-label , two-arm study , Kadcyla ( trastuzumab emtansine ) plus Perjeta ( pertuzumab ) compare chemotherapy plus Herceptin ( trastuzumab ) plus Perjeta treatment operable HER2-positive breast cancer . Patients randomize 1 : 1 ratio receive either follow neoadjuvant treatment total six 3-week cycle : Arm A : Docetaxel + carboplatin + Herceptin + Perjeta Arm B : Kadcyla + Perjeta Following treatment , patient undergo surgery . After recovery , patient give follow adjuvant treatment : Arm A : Herceptin + Perjeta Arm B : Kadcyla + Perjeta Treatment stop due disease recurrence , unacceptable toxicity , withdrawal consent , study termination .
