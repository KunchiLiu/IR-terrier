	<brief_summary>The purpose study use USS Virginia Closed-Loop system overnight insulin delivery adult Type 1 Diabetes ( T1DM ) outpatient set evaluate system 's ability significantly improve blood glucose level . This protocol test feasibility `` bedside '' closed-loop control - approach comprised standard sensor-augmented pump therapy day use off-the-shelf device overnight closed-loop control use experimental device outpatient setting . The rationale study follow : anticipate closed-loop control may ultimately adopt patient T1DM selective manner . Patient may choose start use system overnight control , e.g . alleviate well document fear hypoglycemia asleep . To test paradigm `` bedside '' closed-loop control , subject study continuous glucose monitoring ( CGM ) -augmented usual pump therapy day follow overnight use USS Virginia Closed Loop Control .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The subject participate Experimental Control Admissions . The order two admission randomize . During Control Admission home , subject use study insulin pump along continuous glucose monitor receiver . During Experimental Admission , subject research house/hotel subject control DiAs . Participation study require 5 study visit 11-14 week .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>1 . Clinical diagnosis , base investigator assessment , type 1 diabetes least one year use insulin least 1 year insulin pump least 6 month Criteria document hyperglycemia ( least 1 must meet ) : i. Fasting glucose ≥126 mg/dL ii . Twohour Oral Glucose Tolerance Test ( OGTT ) glucose ≥200 mg/dL iii . HbA1c ≥6.5 % document iv . Random glucose ≥200 mg/dL symptom v. No data diagnosis available participant convince history hyperglycemia consistent diabetes . Criteria require insulin diagnosis ( 1 must meet ) : . Participant required insulin diagnosis continually thereafter ii . Participant start insulin diagnosis upon investigator review likely need insulin ( significant hyperglycemia respond oral agent ) require insulin eventually use continually iii . Participant start insulin diagnosis continue hyperglycemic , positive islet cell antibody consistent latent autoimmune diabetes adult ( LADA ) require insulin eventually use continually 2 . Age ≥21 &lt; 65 year 3 . HbA1c &lt; 10.0 % 4 . For female , currently know pregnant If female sexually active , must agree use form contraception prevent pregnancy participant study . A negative urine pregnancy test require premenopausal woman surgically sterile . Subjects become pregnant discontinue study . 5 . Demonstration proper mental status cognition study 6 . Currently use insulintocarbohydrate ratio calculate meal bolus size 7 . Ability access Internet upload CGM data via DexCom company software data collection period . 8 . Willingness remain within approximately 30 mile radius study site day time hour Visit 4 . 9 . An understanding willingness follow protocol sign inform consent Additional Inclusion Criteria UVA subject participate 5 day athome portion Availability significant family member commit participate training activity , knowledgeable time participant 's location , present available provide assistance system use night Commitment maintaining uninterrupted availability via cell phone avoid overnight travel duration period time use closedloop system home . Access internet cell phone service home 1 . Admission diabetic ketoacidosis 12 month prior enrollment 2 . Severe hypoglycemia result seizure loss consciousness 12 month prior enrollment 3 . History seizure disorder ( except hypoglycemic seizure ) , unless write clearance receive neurologist 4 . Coronary artery disease heart failure , unless write clearance receive cardiologist 5 . Cystic fibrosis 6 . A known medical condition judgment investigator might interfere completion protocol follow example : Inpatient psychiatric treatment past 6 month Presence know adrenal disorder Abnormal liver function test result ( Transaminase &gt; 2 time upper limit normal ) ; test require subject take medication know affect liver function diseases know affect liver function Abnormal renal function test result ( calculated GFR &lt; 60 mL/min/1.73m2 ) ; test require subject diabetes duration great 5 year post onset puberty Active gastroparesis If antihypertensive , thyroid , antidepressant lipid lower medication , lack stability medication past 2 month prior enrollment study Uncontrolled thyroid disease ( TSH undetectable &gt; 10 mlU/L ) ; test require within three month prior admission subject goiter , positive antibody , thyroid hormone replacement , within one year otherwise Abuse alcohol recreational drug Infectious process anticipate resolve prior study procedure ( e.g . meningitis , pneumonia , osteomyelitis ) . Uncontrolled arterial hypertension ( Resting diastolic blood pressure &gt; 90 mmHg and/or systolic blood pressure &gt; 160 mmHg ) . Oral steroid Uncontrolled microvascular complication current active proliferative diabetic retinopathy define proliferative retinopathy require treatment ( e.g . laser therapy ) past 12 month . 7 . A recent injury body limb , muscular disorder , use medication , carcinogenic disease , significant medical disorder injury , medication disease judgment investigator affect completion protocol 8 . Basal Rates &lt; 0.01 units/hour . 9 . Current use follow drug supplement : Acetaminophen Any medication take low blood glucose , Pramlintide , Metformin , glucagonlike peptide ( GLP ) 1 Analogs Liraglutide , nutraceuticals intend low blood glucose Beta blocker Any medication investigator believe contraindication subject 's participation</criteria>
