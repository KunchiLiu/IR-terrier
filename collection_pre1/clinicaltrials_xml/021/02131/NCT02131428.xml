	<detailed_description>There five million Americans live heart failure ( HF ) , another 670,000 new case diagnose year . HF characteristically unstable condition costly diagnosis Medicare population common cause hospitalization . The instability HF disease reflect short-term fluctuation HF disease biomarker , B-Type Natriuretic Peptide ( BNP ) . Patient self-management behavior important minimize HF disease instability . Depression often comorbid HF , elevate depressive symptom associate marked increase adverse clinical outcome . For depressed non-depressed HF patient , worsen depressive symptom mark substantially increase risk cardiovascular hospitalization death . Despite risk associate depressive symptom , nature association worsen HF disease trajectory adverse clinical outcome poorly understood . Converging evidence suggest association depressive symptom accelerate HF disease progression may involve multiple behavioral pathophysiological pathway . This study propose innovative , prospective bio-behavioral monitoring study 220 HF patient design address issue depressive symptom bio-behavioral manifestation implicate worsen HF disease . Using home-monitoring biotechnology , propose track fluctuation HF disease severity use biweekly assessment BNP 16-week period . Symptoms depression HF-related health behavior also assess biweekly via concurrent monitoring . This biweekly bio-behavioral monitoring frame comprehensive baseline 4-month assessment depression , HF disease severity , pathophysiological mechanism relate presence depressive symptom implicate progression HF disease . Clinical outcome also assess subsequent average 3-year follow-up period . This study create unique data structure allow u use contemporary statistical method serve elucidate causal association depressive symptom , self-management health behavior , pathophysiological process , HF disease progression clinical outcome . The study finding expect yield important advance understand depressive symptom may particularly detrimental presence HF help inform design future clinical trial .</detailed_description>
