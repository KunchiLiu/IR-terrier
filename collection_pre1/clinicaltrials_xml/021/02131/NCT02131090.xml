	<brief_summary>A number method currently use prevent movement epidural catheter woman labour . These usually consist sticky dressing apply patient 's back . The purpose study compare much epidural catheter move secure three commonly use different fixation dressing aim identify best method secure epidural catheter . Movement epidural catheter several clinical implication . Usually short length epidural catheter leave epidural space , therefore significant movement could result catheter move epidural space lead loss pain relieve effect epidural . Once epidural failure occur due catheter migration , second catheter must insert order re-establish pain relief thus patient expose risk epidural insertion second time . If researcher study identify method fix epidural catheter result least amount catheter movement , patient could benefit reliable epidural pain relief , few repeat procedure risk associate repeated procedure . The principle objective study determine epidural fixation dress result least amount epidural catheter movement time epidural insertion ( labour ) time epidural removal ( labour ) .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Comparison Intrapartum Epidural Fixation Devices : A Randomised Controlled Trial</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The null hypothesis difference epidural catheter migration epidural catheter fixation device . The study design choose researcher fairly assess different commercially available epidural fixation device perform real life scenario labour , time epidural particularly important well-being labour woman . Three different epidural fixation method study . These three method choose already use different hospital across UK never compare together . 1 . Women admit labour ward St. George 's Hospital invite participate study . Written inform consent obtain potential participant . 2 . Women labour request epidural randomly allocate one three different dressing use secure epidural . The epidural perform duty anaesthetist accord standard practice . The three epidural dressing : 3M Tegaderm , Smiths Medical Lockit Plus Unomedical Epifix . All dress apply standardised manner . Since 3M Tegaderm current dressing used St. George 's Hospital form control group . 3 . Epidurals insert duty anaesthetist use standard technique appropriate dressing apply . In order avoid bias woman inform device receive . 4 . Patient characteristic document epidural , include length catheter skin time insertion , depth epidural space , intervertebral interspace use ( e.g . L3-4 ) , patient position epidural insertion ( lateral sit ) , time date epidural insertion , patient body mass index ( book ) . No identify patient data record . 5 . If epidural remove delivery epidural fixation device alter reason intervention document e.g . inadequacy epidural analgesia , loss integrity fixation device . Any specific event precipitate problem epidural fixation device document e.g . discomfort site dress transfer patient onto operating theatre table . 6 . After delivery baby , epidural catheter remove . Removal encourage within first hour follow delivery patient mobilise bed . If possible woman adopt position ( either sit lateral ) removal epidural insertion . Removal catheter either midwife duty anaesthetist . 7 . After removal epidural follow patient characteristic collect midwife anaesthetist remove catheter : length catheter skin time removal , patient position epidural removal ( lateral sit ) , time date epidural removal , integrity epidural dressing , whether patient transfer operating theatre table , additional problem encounter epidural dressing . 8 . No specific restriction place participant follow epidural insertion , routine labour woman epidural . However woman move bed walk removal epidural catheter exclude study , since walking may cause epidural catheter migrate would usually labour . Data analyse determine whether null hypothesis accept reject . Information study conclusion drawn publish locally nationally order inform decision make regard epidural catheter fixation device best suit reduce epidural migration labour woman .</detailed_description>
