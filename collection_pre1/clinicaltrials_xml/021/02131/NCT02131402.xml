	<brief_title>Clinical Performance Hydrogel vs. Silicone Hydrogel Contact Lenses</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This 60-subject , double mask , randomize , contra lateral , non-dispensing fitting trial compare different lens material ( hydrogel v silicone hydrogel ) . It anticipate study involve 2 visit , lens pair , follow : Visits : V1 ( lens dispense ) , V2 ( 1 hour post lens settle ) . Each subject randomize wear test control lenses series three short fit comparison .</detailed_description>
