	<brief_title>Outcome Cognitive Behavioral Therapy Patients With Severe Health Anxiety Treated Group Only . A RCT .</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>BACKGROUND Classification comorbidity Hypochondriasis broadly define international classification system mental disorder ICD-10 ( WHO ) DSM-IV ( APA ) somatoform disorder preoccupation fear belief serious disease condition last least 6 month . It non-delusional , symptom well explain another mental disorder , cause distress impairment function persists despite appropriate medical reassurance . Somatoform disorder define syndromes physical symptom , sufficiently explain physical cause alone , define somatic illness comorbid mental disorder . A less stigmatizing name : health anxiety suggest , new research report valid diagnostic criterion continuous rumination fear belief serious disease last least 2 week presence minimum one five symptom : preoccupation illness body , preoccupation medical information , suggestibility autosuggestibility , fear infection contamination fear medication . A degree severity also introduce either mild severe health anxiety split presence minimum one severely distress symptom significant impairment function [ 1 ] . Hypochondriasis Health Anxiety ( HA ) use synonymously . HA like somatoform disorder show high degree mental comorbidity depressive disorder 15,3-45,2 % , anxiety disorder 22-52,4 % , somatoform disorder 8-21,4 % mental comorbidity total 54-78,6 % [ 11,34,46 ] . HA also show high degree mental comorbidity personality disorder ( PD ) 63-76 % [ 34,35 ] use questionnaire assessment , seem overestimate prevalence [ 36 ] 40-74 % use SCID-II , semi-structured interview develop DSM , present golden standard diagnose PD [ 39,40 ] . A high degree mental comorbidity rise question classification , HA primary mental disorder therefore disease entity , symptom secondary another mental disorder like melancholic depression , HA well classify personality disorder [ 37 ] anxiety disorder [ 38 ] . In DSM-V ICD-11 disorder entity suggest preserved keep categorized somatoform disorder , name suggest change illness anxiety disorder DSM-V health anxiety ICD-11 . Epidemiology Studies report prevalence HA communities 0,2-4,5 % [ 2,28 ] primary care 0,8-7.0 % [ 3-7 ] , use new valid criterion 9,5 % ( 12.1 % incl . mild degree ) [ 1 ] secondary care 10-20 % [ 8-9 ] . Severe HA early onset mean age onset = 25 year [ 1 ] , equal sex distribution , fluctuate persistent median duration treatment 2- 20 year [ 10,11,31,45 ] , distress disable therefore also costly health social care system [ 12,13 ] . Personality characteristic Only 2 former study assess patient HA use SCID-II . One small sample size 21 psychiatric outpatient , 74 % patient find comorbid PD compare 52 % psychiatric outpatient Greece . Here prevalent PD HA histrionic obsessive-compulsive personality disorder [ 39 ] . The study include 42 patient HA comorbid OCD Social Phobia recruit community USA . This study find , 40 % HA comorbid PD , prominent type paranoid , obsessive-compulsive avoidant PD . Here group HA compare group patient OCD Social Phobia , find significant difference prevalence PD HA compare prevalence PD either 2 anxiety disorder [ 40 ] . Few study personality dimension HA make . One study use questionnaire Personality Assessment Schedule ( PAS ) find hypochondriacal PD high degree personality trait : hypochondriasis , anxiousness , consciousness dependence [ 37 ] . Other personality trait HA report high degree neuroticism , narcissism avoidance histrionic borderline trait [ 37,43,44 ] . Treatment Patients suffer HA often diagnose treat well doctor [ 5 ] . It cause frustration doctor patient . Doctors feel powerless towards patient continue suffer complaint , patient feel take seriously doctor get sufficient help , extensive somatic focus medical examination contribute chronic development disorder [ 48,49,59 ] . On Zealand app . 2.5 million inhabitant 40 patient HA refer medical doctor specialize treatment exist 2 clinic Liaison Psychiatry 2011 . Earlier HA consider untreatable , psychotherapy cognitive behavioural therapy ( CBT ) HA develop past 2 decade show effective . There also evidence 2 study report moderate treatment effectiveness SSRI medication HA [ 22,23 ] , prior treatment patient HA favour psychological treatment pharmacological treatment , although pharmacological treatment equally tolerate [ 22-24 ] . A meta-analysis 2007 include 6 randomized control trial ( RCT ) find evidence effectiveness treatment HA short term individual CBT . The effective factor CBT health anxiety symptom primary outcome measure find cognitive restructuring ( cognitive therapy ) , response-prevention , exposure , behavioural stress management , resource use secondary outcome measure also psychoeducation [ 14 ] . CBT personality disorder far show effective long term treatment [ 65 ] . Group CBT might advantage individual CBT cost-effectiveness , less therapist time spend per patient , individual CBT vulnerable session cancellation patient possible effective group dynamic . No study far compare effectiveness group CBT individual CBT HA , generally cost-effectiveness group dynamic little empirical evidence need research [ 16-21 ] . 5 study effectiveness group CBT HA formerly make . They show treatment effective acceptable [ 25,26,29,30 ] , one study also show cost-effective society save health care [ 27 ] . But sample size 3 study small , design control , two RCT study one begin therapy 8 individual session CBT [ 30 ] , intervention second study mostly psychoeducational [ 29 ] . Prior treatment patient generally prefer individual CBT group CBT , attrition satisfaction treatment show equal end treatment dropout rate 10-47 % [ 20,21,47 ] . Predictors outcome Only study far examine predictor outcome CBT HA often conflict result . 2 study find predictive value sociodemographic variable [ 33,62 ] , one study find positive predictive value marital status [ 32 ] one negative predictive value high age [ 66 ] . 3 study find negative predictive value high degree health anxiety treatment [ 32,33,66 ] , result pretreatment anxiety , general psychopathology chronicity inconsistent [ 32,33,62,66 ] . One study also find negative predictive value dysfunctional cognition relate bodily function , disability work utilization health care treatment predictive value comorbid anxiety depressive disorder [ 33 ] . The influence comorbid PD HA treatment outcome knowledge investigate one former study . The design include control group , include 36 patient non-respondant previously give pharmachological treatment , afterwards treat different duration individual insight psychotherapy anti-anxious medication . Here comorbid PD negative predictive value outcome [ 62 ] . Studies patient depressive anxiety disorder comorbid PD generally find bad treatment outcome pharmacological psychological treatment [ 41,42,60 ] . RATIONALE No RCT outcome effectiveness classical group CBT severe health anxiety hypochondriasis yet conduct . Group CBT compare individual CBT ( usual care ) patient health anxiety might therapeutic advantage due manualised structured treatment , favourable group dynamic , improve social skill create support group , group-CBT might less costly therefore well cost-effectiveness , attrition might worse , need investigation . Initial assessment prior CBT also include categorical dimensional assessment personality possible relevance prognosis , treatment preference possibility , creation homogenous group group therapy improve acceptability outcome , individual design CBT element group CBT . But good general knowledge personality vulnerability patient HA use best diagnostics large sample size new well assessment questionnaire personality dimension trait also relevant design effective treatment protocol individual group CBT future . As general practitioner become educate CBT program Shared Care introduce , time treatment HA might also possible integrate primary care close patient . AIMS In randomise controlled trial examine treatment outcome specialize classical cognitive behaviour therapy ( CBT ) deliver group set patient severe health anxiety ( HA ) include evidence base effective factor individual CBT HA [ 14 ] . More specifically : 1 . To examine patient severe HA reduce level health anxiety even cure 6 month treatment group CBT compare wait-list group receive usual care . 2 . To examine patient severe HA experience well mental physical health improve social function 6 month treatment group CBT compare wait-list group receive usual care . 3 . To examine patient severe HA show reduction health care use sick day 6 month treatment group CBT compare wait-list group receive usual care . 4 . To categorical dimensional assessment personality patient severe HA refer doctor use large sample size best diagnostics new instrument dimensional trait assessment ( PID-5 ) yield new general knowledge personality vulnerability patient severe HA . 5 . To examine predictor outcome group CBT patient severe HA especially personality disorder . 6 . To examine cost-effectiveness group CBT compare wait-list group receive usual care standard duration individual CBT patient severe HA . 7 . To examine illness perception patient severe health anxiety change treatment group CBT compare wait-list group receive usual care . 8 . To examine illness perception relate personality patient severe HA outcome group CBT compare wait-list group receive usual care . 9 . To examine course patient severe health anxiety short term group-CBT afterwards long term psychotherapeutic treatment comorbid personality disorder 2 year follow-up . Hypotheses Main hypothesis : Patients severe HA receive group CBT 6-month follow-up compare wait-list group receive usual care show significantly reduction health anxiety . Additional hypothesis : Patients severe HA receive group CBT 6-month follow-up compare wait-list group receive usual care significantly : ) good mental physical health improve global social functioning , b ) low use health care service c ) less sick day . 30-60 % patient severe HA comorbid personality disorder . Both patient severe HA without comorbid PD show reduction health anxiety short term group CBT , patient comorbid personality disorder show significantly low cure-rate , patient without comorbid personality disorder . Patients severe health anxiety comorbid PD ( comorbid mental disorder ) afterwards therefore need long term psychotherapeutic treatment cure . This hypotheses examine 24 month follow-up , part patient group CBT also receive long term psychotherapy PD . Group CBT significantly cost-effective wait-list group receive usual care standard duration individual CBT patient severe HA . Group CBT feasible acceptable treatment patient ( high satisfaction low drop-out ) . Patients severe HA receive group CBT 6-month follow-up compare wait-list group receive usual care show significantly sound illness perception . Patients severe HA comorbid personality disorder group CBT less sound illness perception patient without comorbid personality disorder . METHODS 84 patient severe health anxiety consecutively refer family physician , medical specialist hospital ward Zealand The Clinic Liaison Psychiatry Koege , Region Zealand . The project communicate relevant homepage , regionsjaelland.dk sundhed.dk , arrange visit medical doctor . The patient block randomize per 14 patient 2 group : group CBT wait-list receive usual care 9 month offer group CBT . Expected drop-out rate 20 % group CBT wait-list . DATA AND PROCEDURES Diagnostic assessment The patient refer initially screen inclusion telephone interview specialist psychiatry ( MS ) . The telephone interview consist direct question inclusion exclusion criterion , WI-7 , diagnostic criterion severe health anxiety seek verbal consent send first online questionnaire . Each patient fulfil inclusion assess use SCAN interview ( Schedules Clinical Assessment Neuropsychiatry ) , thorough semi-structured diagnostic interview recommend WHO apply diagnostics general mental disorder define ICD-10 DSM-IV criterion [ 50 ] , use SCID II [ 51 ] , semi-structured diagnostic interview personality disorder develop DSM-IV . Just semi-structured interview perform non-structured clinical interview assessment perform end psychoeducation joint creation individual illness model cognitive behaviour therapy . Global assessment functioning ( GAF-F ) diagnostic assessment use DSM-V , ICD-10 criterion severe health anxiety also perform initial clinical assessment . The clinical diagnostic interview perform specialist psychiatry ( MS ) , certify SCAN training centre Copenhagen train SCID-II assessment project start . If need second opinion patient another medical doctor clinic Koege possible ( JS ) . For inter-rater-reliability assessment 5 % patient similarly clinically assess blind second rater specialist psychiatry . After patient answer 5. online questionnaire ( 6 month end treatment ) , diagnostically assess severe health anxiety direct question diagnostic criterion severe health anxiety telephone interview perform blinded second rater specialist psychiatry . Right telephone interview MS see patient clinic conclusion treatment possibility patient refer psychotherapeutic treatment , indicate comorbid mental disorder want patient . Course The patient follow mean various self-reporting health measure report online ( Survey Xact ) ; clinical assessment ( telephone interview include verbal consent ) ( SCAN SCID-II ) , 14 day group start ( baseline ) , end treatment , 3 , 6 24 month end treatment ( see attach Flowchart Figure 1 ) . Dimensions traits personality assess baseline questionnaire Personality Inventory DSM-V ( PID-5 ) [ 52 ] develop DSM-V , include Appendix . 6 month end treatment patient clinical assess severe HA telephone interview blind second rater ( Cure define either diagnosis severe HA WI-7 score &lt; 21,4 6 month end treatment ) . Use health care service sick day period 9 month precede treatment 6 month end treatment drawn relevant register . The 6. online questionnaire send patient 2 year follow-up . Most patient receive short term group-CBT . Some patient afterwards also receive long term psychotherapeutic treatment comorbid personality disorder . The patient control group offer group CBT immediately answer 6 month follow-up questionnaire RCT ( . 5 ) , also function baseline questionnaire . The patient control group also give questionnaire . 5 9 month ( Their 6 month follow-up group CBT ) . The patient control group give one questionnaire RCT treatment group total 7 questionnaire 24 month follow-up prospective cohort study . Randomisation After patient give write informed consent , put wait-list block randomization total 14 patient . When 14 patient answer 2. online questionnaire , randomize 2 group ; group therapy ( n=7 ) , start shortly randomization , wait-list ( n=7 ) offer start group therapy 9 month . Patients randomize mean computer algorithm use predefined concealed random number . Treatment Group CBT The patient treat group 7 2 therapist , either medical doctor , psychologist , psychomotoric nurse train cognitive behaviour therapy experience treat patient HA CBT . 2 team therapist ( 4 therapist ) deliver treatment , MS take part therapist necessary . The therapist project supervise regularly external psychologist . The group therapy include 12 weekly meeting 3 hour excl . 15 minute break booster-meeting 3 hour deliver 3 month end treatment . The treatment follow write manual meeting , give patient first meeting . The treatment manual generally consist CBT element goal setting , psychoeducation , symptom registration , relaxation training , stress management , cognitive restructuring include individual design behavioural experiment , response prevention , exposure , relapse prevention homework . For assessment therapist competency adherence manual group-CBT video-recorded , app . 5 % essential material assess blinded rater . The therapist satisfaction group-CBT rat questionnaire . Usual care group After diagnostic assessment randomization , patient , refer doctor , family physician inform write diagnosis , way patient randomize group CBT . But patient put group usual care offer receive group CBT 9 month . This group CBT part primary research project ( RCT ) , still take place The Liaison Psychiatric Clinic Koege . Patients usual care group receive letter state randomize 9-month usual care , period continue usual care health care provider . The patient usual care group followed-up questionnaire way patient randomize group CBT ( see attach flowchart Figure 1 ) . For detail regard time characteristic treatment element deliver group CBT see attached Figure 3 . Drop-outs The patient drop-out ( inclusion ) followed-up questionnaire way patient randomize either group CBT wait-list . This do intention treat analysis . Also patient telephone examine reason drop-out . Attending le 8 total 13 treatment meeting also define drop-out .

Expectations satisfaction treatment along full course treatment clinic Definition sufficient treatment : Sufficient treatment demand attendance group-CBT meeting least 8 meeting 13 meeting total . If less attendance occurs , patient define drop-out . Perspectives Health anxiety costly social health care system cause suffer disability patient . This study hopefully form basis effective evidence-based group therapy patient impair health anxiety thereby help increase patient ' quality life functional level reduce social health care cost . As general practitioner train cognitive behaviour therapy Shared Care introduce primary care , element develop group-CBT use prevention treatment patient lesser degree HA primary care .
