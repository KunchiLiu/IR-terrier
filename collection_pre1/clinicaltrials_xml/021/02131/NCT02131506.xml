	<detailed_description>Title : A Phase Ib Study Lapatinib Combination Caelyx Patients Advanced HER2 positive pretreated Breast Cancer . Protocol Code : IRST 174.01 Phase : Ib Study Design : open-label , single arm study patient advance HER2 positive breast cancer . Treatment Plan : Lapatinib give escalate dos orally continuously day 1-21 . Caelyx administer escalate dos 60-minute i.v . infusion day 1 . Each cycle define 21 day . Four dose level plan . Dose level -1 , Caelyx 30 mg/mq &amp; Lapatinib 1000 mg die ; dose level 1 , Caelyx 30 mg/mq &amp; Lapatinib 1250 mg die ; dose level 2 , Caelyx 30 mg/mq &amp; Lapatinib 1500 mg die ; dose level 3 , Caelyx 40 mg/mq &amp; Lapatinib 1500 mg die . Three patient initially enrol dose level start level 1 . If none first triplet patient develop DLT , dose escalate next level subsequent three patient . If one first triplets patient develop first-course DLT , maximum 3 additional patient enter dose level . The MTD define dose two patient experience DLT . Lapatinib self-administered patient outpatient set dose assigned step . Patients take drug daily mouth day 1 21 cycle . Caelyx administer intravenous infusion exact period 1 hour ( preferably pump guarantee constant speed infusion ) day 1 cycle repeat every 21 day . Objectives : Primary : define MTD safety profile Lapatinib ( Tyverb ) plus Caelyx . Secondary : preliminarily explore anti tumour activity , determine objective tumor response rate use RECIST criterion . Sample Size : No formal sample size estimation perform primarily descriptive phase I trial safety tolerability . STATISTICAL METHODOLOGY : Evaluation toxicity : patient evaluable toxicity time first treatment Caelyx Lapatinib . Evaluation response : patient include study must assess response treatment , even major protocol treatment deviation ineligible . Each patient assign one follow category : 1 ) complete response , 2 ) partial response , 3 ) stable disease , 4 ) progressive disease , 5 ) early death malignant disease , 6 ) early death toxicity , 7 ) early death cause , 9 ) unknown ( assessable , insufficient data ) . All patient meet eligibility criterion ( possible exception receive study medication ) include main analysis response rate . Patients response categories 4-9 consider failing respond treatment ( PD ) . Thus , incorrect treatment schedule drug administration result exclusion analysis response rate . All conclusion base eligible patient . Subanalyses may perform basis subset patient , exclude major protocol deviation identify ( e.g. , early death due reason , early discontinuation treatment , major protocol violation , etc. ) . However , subanalyses may serve basis draw conclusion concern treatment efficacy , reason exclude patient analysis clearly report . The 95 % confidence interval also provide .</detailed_description>

Subjects must tumors overexpress ErbB2 define +3 IHC FISH positive ErbB2 gene amplification . The status ErbB2 expression must document prior study entry . Subjects must disease progression ( RECIST ) follow prior therapy taxane trastuzumabcontaining regimen ( contraindicate ) . Patients may number prior chemotherapy , immunotherapy , hormonal therapy , investigational radiotherapy regimen , therapy must discontinue least 4 week study entry ( 6 week last regimen include BCNU mitomycin C ) . Age &gt; 18 year . Life expectancy great 12 week . ECOG performance status &lt; 2 ( see Appendix A ) . Cardiac ejection fraction within institutional range normal measure echocardiogram ( ECHO ) . Previous anthracycline use inferior 360 mg/mq epirubicin 200 mg/mq doxorubicin ( provided patient offtreatment least one year progress treatment ) .

Should woman become pregnant suspect pregnant participating study , inform treat physician immediately . Ability swallow retain oral medication . Ability understand willingness sign write informed consent document . Participation another clinical trial investigational agent within 30 day prior study screen . Prior treatment Caelyx Lapatinib . Previous malignancy except cervical carcinoma situ , adequately treat basal cell carcinoma , superficial bladder tumor , malignancy curatively treat &gt; 3 year study entry . Patients symptomatic brain metastasis exclude clinical trial poor prognosis often develop progressive neurologic dysfunction , would confound evaluation neurologic adverse event . Asymptomatic patient allow . History allergic reaction attribute compound similar chemical biologic composition Caelyx Lapatinib agent use study . Uncontrolled intercurrent illness include , limited , ongoing active infection , symptomatic congestive heart failure , unstable angina pectoris , cardiac arrhythmia , psychiatric illness/social situation would limit compliance study requirement . Have current active hepatic biliary disease ( exception patient Gilbert 's syndrome , asymptomatic gallstone , liver metastasis stable chronic liver disease per investigator assessment ) ; Malabsorption syndrome disease significantly affect gastrointestinal function .</criteria>
