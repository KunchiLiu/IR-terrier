	<brief_summary>The PROPS trial men consider radiotherapy due suspicion prostate cancer recur follow surgical removal prostate ( prostatectomy ) . This suspicion base rise see Prostate Specific Antigen ( PSA ) blood test . Only men demonstrate absence disease standard image scan ( Computed Tomography ( CT ) bone scan ) invite participate . This study assess image probe 18-F Fluorocholine ( 18F-FCH ) use Positron Emission Tomography ( PET ) Magnetic Resonance Imaging ( MRI ) scan , good predict benefit radiotherapy identify source cancer recurrence . This determine measure number men disease identify outside prostate bed ( small pocket depression prostate use ) 18F-FCH PET scan . Since F-18-FCH show sensitive detect prostate cancer may spread lymph node bone , may potentially identify area prostate cancer spread see standard imaging .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>PET/MRI Men Being Considered Radiotherapy Suspected Prostate Cancer Recurrence Post-Prostatectomy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The study non-randomized , prospective study men suspect local recurrence prostate cancer post-prostatectomy negative conventional re-staging study ( bone scan CT abdomen pelvis ; MRI pelvis part re-staging allow institutional standard care ) . The clinician develop initial treatment plan base conventional re-staging information . Patients enrol onto trial undergo hybrid PET/MR image use 18F-FCH ( site without access hybrid PET/MR scanner conduct 18F-FCH PET/CT addition full body MRI ) . A consensus stag report base local centralize review 18F-FCH PET imaging provide attend clinician , document second treatment plan base additional information . The treatment plan implement ( initial second ) leave clinician discretion , document .</detailed_description>
