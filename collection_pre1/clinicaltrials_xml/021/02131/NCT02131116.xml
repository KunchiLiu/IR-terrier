The novel intervention integrate number previously establish therapeutic approach , metacognitive , narrative , cognitive behavioral motivational interviewing , hence label Integrated Metacognitive Therapy ( IMT ) . In order measure efficacy IMT , subject undergo battery assessment domains prior follow either novel intervention ( N = 10 ) treatment usual ( N = 10 ) period approximately six month . Throughout study , IMT session ( N = 10 , 24 session ) audio record , transcribe , de-identified allow careful ongoing qualitative analysis potential active inert ingredient approach ultimately development IMT manual test large , rigorous randomize control trial .

	<detailed_description>The National Advisory Mental Health Council recently call development non-pharmacological treatment identify target specific disease process clinical improvement schizophrenia psychotic illness . One illness process , vital positive outcome , impaired awareness illness insight . Insight often think factual knowledge acknowledgement one 's illness . More specifically , insight psychosis conceptualize multi-dimensional construct , several independent overlap dimension , ability appropriately label aberrant mental event ( e.g . hallucination delusion ) , recognition illness , willingness engage treatment . Relative individual mental illness , psychotic illness impair insight , present number challenge , include : poor treatment engagement adherence , frequent hospitalization , great positive negative symptom , poor psychosocial functioning . This problem particularly relevant early phase psychotic illness , remain paucity data . Data available show decreased insight associate increase symptom poorer cognitive functioning , potential impact illness course . Two reason account lack attention development treatment insight : ) lack adequate model force cause sustain poor insight ii ) failure consider integrate treatment . Without idea process sustain poor insight , intervention able offer education nature illness equip respond underlying process block emergence insight treatment . While early literature frame insight failure grasp specific fact , recent effort suggest poor insight primarily result failure create coherent account complex event personal experience relate psychiatric illness . These difficulty become aware one 's illness may multi-determined result factor include deficit metacognition , neurocognition , symptom . The development insight complex highly dependent upon metacognitive process , unique , potentially moderate role . Metacognition involve range faculty allow individual form representation mental state self others , lead formation revision thought , belief , feeling , behavior , even individual aspiration . Therapies target metacognitive mentalizing deficit successfully implement personality disorder , depression anxiety . In psychotic disorder , decrease metacognitive capacity think result difficulty identify source one 's experience , illness consequence . This lead inability perceive self active agent world problem understand act upon social cue ( emotion intention ) others . A recently propose Integrated Metacognitive therapeutic approach argues insight improve individual utilizes construct narrative make sense experience . In word , illness consequence understood individualize , personally relevant acceptable way . Importantly , approach address many obstacle gain insight address approach , include learn deal related emotional pain depression , loss , internalized stigma . This view also consistent intervention research show establishment personal meaning important recovery , promote improved function reduce symptom . Case study group others provide evidence therapy target metacognitive process feasible psychotic disorder indeed improve insight function person chronic schizophrenia . However , approach tailor target insight , evaluate test patient early phase psychosis . In addition metacognitive deficit , neurocognitive deficit also commonly observe schizophrenia involve decrement capacity attention/vigilance , verbal memory executive function . Deficits executive function find predict concurrent prospective assessment poorer insight , spur hypothesis impairment executive function leave person unable synthesize illness relate experience coherent adequate story ill . Deficits attention memory may additionally obscure historical event connect . As whole , neurocognitive deficit may cause difficulty piece together individual 's experience illness coherent whole result poor insight . Therefore , development personal narrative use integrated therapy would allow subject opportunity well understand illness experience , hence improve insight . The research present suggest improve insight early psychotic disease process would likely result improved treatment participation , ultimately lead well outcome . Motivated clear press need good address illness insight early psychotic illness recent positive finding relate , present investigation serve test novel Integrated Metacognitive Therapy ( IMT ) target insight important domain early psychosis . Assuming IMT successful , ongoing qualitative analysis IMT session allow manual development , future randomize control trial , ultimately treatment dissemination .</detailed_description>
