	<brief_summary>A large panel oral dental disease exist patient suffer chronic kidney disease ( CKD ) end-stage renal disease : concern teeth , peridontium , alveolar bone saliva already describe literature . The consequence oral disease systemic health substantial , include increase inflammatory parameter , alteration nutrition increase cardiovascular risk factor . It show several oral disease consider cardiovascular risk factor general population diabetic patient chronic inflammatory pathway . In CKD patient , influence oral disease progression chronic kidney disease yet establish , study focus stage 5 CKD dialysis patient . That 's interaction dental health CKD evaluate population patient , different stage disease ( stag 2 5 ) . The main objective describe oral disease stage CKD . Secondary objective : ( 1 ) To evaluate link oral health chronic kidney disease stage , nutritional inflammatory status ; ( 2 ) Among patient need dental treatment , evaluate 6 month 12 month whether dental care influence nutrition parameter , inflammatory status CKD ; ( 3 ) evaluate completion dental treatment dental consultation include advises dental health .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The consequence oral dental diseases general health substantial , include acute infectious process start teeth peridontium , benign malignant disease start mucosa teeth/peridontium overall reduction nutrition index decrease quality life marker . More recently , augmentation systemic inflammatory reaction marker show correlated periodontal disease , lead increase cardiovascular disease and/or diabetic risk patient . A large panel oral dental disease describe patient suffer chronic kidney disease ( CKD ) terminal stage dialysis ( haemodialysis peritoneal dialysis ) . In CKD patient , influence oral disease progression chronic kidney disease establish today , study focus stage 5 CKD dialysis patient . That 's interaction dental health CKD evaluate patient , different stage disease ( stag 2 5 ) . In study , hypothesize augmentation inflammation alteration nutrition due oral disease impact alteration CKD patient , chronic inflammatory pathway . We evaluate oral dental health Day 0 , 6 month 12 month use several index : oral hygiene-simplified index , community periodontal index treatment need index , decay miss fill per tooth index , number functional teeth index , oral health impact profile index , saliva composition , evaluation halitosis mucosa evaluation . In parallel , evaluation influence chronic oral disease nutrition , inflammation progression chronic kidney disease do : biological check-up , nutrition intake statement body mass index .</detailed_description>
