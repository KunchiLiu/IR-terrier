	<brief_title>Study Comparing Ibandronate Versus Placebo Hip Osteonecrosis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Aseptic osteonecrosis hip ( AOH ) concern 1 Swiss young adult 1000 ( 30-40 year old ) . They responsible severe joint destruction majority case joint replacement . AOH represent 10 % hip replacement Switzerland . It could multiple . In situation , associate specific disease , justify collaboration surgeon specialist bone diseases rheumatologist . Initially patient AOH present mechanical pain dysfunction . Either surgeon rheumatologist suspect diagnosis . To hip , distinguish 4 stage osteonecrosis accord Ficat : 1 , 2 , 3 , 4 . The unfavourable evolution bad stage common depend necrosis surface : le 10 % 3 year surface small , 25 % surface moderate , 84 % surface extend . In case fortuitous discovery , natural evolution collapse stage 1 55 % , stage 2 56 % stage 3 96 % median time 39 month . Mainly , case early Ficat stage ( 1 ) , final diagnosis support specific image MRI . It could confound differential diagnosis transient osteoporosis . Stage 3 4 AOH management unanimous surgical . But management stage 1 2 unclear . Based physiopathology , associate 2 hypothesis ( one vascular , one osseous ) , bisphosphonates could interest decrease pain bone defect evaluate joint collapse . Bisphophonates mainly use bone osteoporosis disease . They decrease bone turn , risk fracture . They decrease bone marrow oedema pain associate oedema . Ibandronate bisphosphonate rapid effect , short half-life , easy manage , side effect . Regarding consideration , study gathering surgeon , specialist bone diseases radiologist necessary . An interdisciplinary approach need increase knowledge pathology well manage patient . The exact diagnosis AOH need radiologic expertise , well management movement stag evolution need orthopaedic management , deliverance treatment bone efficacy need bone disease expertise . A prospective randomize double blind placebo study design . All consecutive patient ( 18-50 yo ) see OTP RHU/CMO unit CHUV confirm diagnosis single stage 1 2 accord Ficat AOH MRI could include . After informed sign consent , randomize receive either placebo 3 mg ibandronate . Infusion perform 15 minute . Size effect ( pain VAS , Harris , Womac , EQ5D , gait parameter , blood analysis ) side effect record day 3 , 7 , month 1 , 3 , 6 . If patient persistent pain ( bad VAS ) M3 , second infusion perform , ibandronate . At M1 M3 MRI perform confirm stage 1 ( DD transient osteoporosis ) stage 1 previous diagnose patient . At M3 M6 X ray MRI perform patient analyze stage progression . The primary end point M6 pain VAS radiological progression . Patients need second infusion 3 month would consider survival . We hypothesize reduction 20 mm VAS scale ( SD 10mm ) ibandronate group versus placebo , non radiological progression treat group . With power 90 % alpha 0.05 want include 50 patient . Drugs : Patients allow pain killer NSAI prescribe investigator GP . All drug note diary . All patient receive physiotherapy prescription one treatment per week , period 3 month . Moreover , patient may freely choose physiotherapist . The prescription give investigator . Furthermore , session space last three month , investigator discretion . On one hand participant ask overwork . On hand , participant ask adapt non weight-bearing status either . From economical point view , look CHUV scale , 10 % hip arthroplasty make AOH mean 30 patient year . If treatment allow postpone 10 year need arthroplasty one study publish low methodology suggest , mean economy CHF 1'200'000 year .</detailed_description>
