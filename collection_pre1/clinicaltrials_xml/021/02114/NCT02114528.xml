	<brief_summary>The purpose study determine whether catheter base ablation well conventional anti-arrhythmic drug ( AAD ) therapy reduce recurrent shock patient implantable cardioverter defibrillator ( ICD ) . The second purpose study determine safety catheter-based ablation effect quality life patient . The study hypothesis catheter ablation superior AAD therapy prevent recurrent ventricular arrhythmia subject . This pilot trial provide data regard recruitment potential feasibility conduct large trial .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Anti-arrhythmic Therapy v Catheter Ablation First Line Treatment AICD Shock Prevention</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>AAD catheter ablation show reduce incidence recurrent AICD shock . The disadvantage AAD include side effect medication lack compliance long-term therapy . Previous trial demonstrate feasibility , safety efficacy catheter ablation `` first-line '' treatment reduce recurrent ventricular arrhythmia AICD shock subject population . However , catheter ablation trial systematically compare efficacy catheter ablation AAD therapy . While treatment strategy show effective set unclear compare prevent AICD shock . This single centre , parallel group , two-arm , unblinded randomize vanguard pilot trial compare catheter ablation AAD therapy prevent recurrent AICD shock . Eligible consent subject equally randomize receive either AAD therapy catheter ablation procedure . A 30-day treatment period provide allow adequate time implement two treatment . Subjects randomized antiarrhythmic therapy arm receive clinically effective loading dos either sotalol , mexiletine , procainamide amiodarone ( oral IV ) alone combination , choose study investigator . Subjects randomize catheter ablation arm undergo procedure within 30 treatment period . Concomitant antiarrhythmic therapy amiodarone AAD avoid possible ablation group . However , AAD may use suppress ventricular arrhythmia result AICD shock anti-tachycardia pacing ( ATP ) wait catheter ablation procedure . Subjects see baseline randomization visit , 3 , 6 , 9 12 month enrollment every 3 month thereafter end study . Subjects follow minimum 12 month maximum 24 month . Quality life questionnaires do visit . Standard care blood work , chest x-ray , ECG do AAD arm depend AAD chosen treatment . ICD program standardized subject .</detailed_description>
