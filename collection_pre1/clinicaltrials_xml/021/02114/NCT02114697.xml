	<brief_summary>The goal study ass slimy substance settles/deposits along blood vessel wall . This slimy substance call plaque . Plaque could make fat , calcium . Plaque deposition narrow vessel . This lead decreased blood flow various part body . Blood vessel include vessel supply heart ( coronary ) , vessel brain ( carotid ) , vessel kidney ( renal ) vessel legs ( femoral ) . Decreased blood flow cause symptom brain stroke , heart attack , leg pain . Similarly individual risk cardiovascular disease certain marker elevate blood measure simple blood test . High increase plaque deposition see neck vessel cancer patient receive radiation chest head neck part cancer treatment . Cancer survivor increase risk plaque development therefore call high-risk population . Exercise +/- fat lower medicine potentially decrease plaque deposition statins one several fat lower medication .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Atherosclerosis High Risk Population Groups : An Assessment Magnetic Resonance Imaging</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Cardiovascular disease ( CVD ) cancer lead cause suffer death amongst American population . While ever-increasing number cancer survivor favorable outcome due advance cancer treatment ; cancer survivor remain high risk develop CVD early age . There scant information available pathogenic process contributes cardiovascular threat amongst cancer survivor little known intervention , may interrupt decrease risk CVD population . Importantly , early-subclinical marker may substantially precede clinical marker . The objective project accurately determine constituent characteristic atherosclerotic plaque carotid artery magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) techniques cancer survivor ; different data interval : administration treatment ( medical life style modification ) correlate contrast agent dynamic serum marker inflammation test cardiac vascular dysfunction , available . The propose study involve 100 asymptomatic patient receive prior chest head neck radiation therapy ( HNXRT ) part cancer treatment . MRI data ( direct assessment atherosclerosis ) would correlate indirect measure atherosclerosis ( blood surrogate marker &amp; metabolomics ) . The investigator intend conduct initial baseline MRI , blood test ( correlate surrogate marker inflammation ) test whenever available cardiac vascular dysfunction . This cohort follow medication and/or life style modification regimen period initially18 month subsequently 36 month . A repeat baseline study ( MRI blood test ) would perform part 18 36-month follow-up . The plaque characteristic find MRI correlate result blood test ( baseline , 18 36 month ) change one expected end point study .</detailed_description>
