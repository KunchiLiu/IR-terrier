	<detailed_description>Randomized Controlled Trial Study Effect Nasal Continuous Positive Airway Pressure ( NCPAP ) Cycling Successful Weaning Compared Continuous Nasal Positive Airway Pressure ( NCPAP ) Premature Infants 25-28 week gestation Background : In Canada , preterm baby &lt; 28 week gestation constitute 12 % newborn admission survival increase 65 % 72 % . In Alberta , premature birth rate increase past several year although preterm infant make small percentage birth , add disproportionately mortality , morbidity cost medical care . Their rate long-term neurodevelopmental disability also disproportionately high . Advances neonatal ventilation neonatal care include increase use antenatal steroid , postnatal surfactant , improved mechanical ventilation early use total parenteral nutrition improve survival extremely low birth weight ( ELBW ) premature infant . Despite advance , incidence Bronchopulmonary Dysplasia ( BPD ) infants remain high Southern Alberta . Perinatal risk factor duration mechanical ventilation , include high inspire oxygen , high peak inspiratory pressure , low positive end-expiratory pressure , high ventilation rate hypocarbia ( Partial pressure carbon dioxide &lt; 40 cm water 48 96 hour ) associate later development BPD premature infant . Although pressure-induced injury might play role injury lead 'new ' BPD , alveolar distention likely important contribute factor . Atelectasis also contribute BPD ventilation atelectatic lung lead pulmonary parenchymal injury sheer stress repeatedly reinflating collapse alveolus . Despite various preventive treatment strategy include permissive hypercapnia , high frequency ventilation , antioxidant , indomethacin , fluid restriction use diuretic , prevalence BPD continue unacceptably high . It unclear whether minimum ventilator pressure exposure premature lung could prevent increase incidence BPD use nasal continuous positive airway pressure ( NCPAP ) cycling ( NCPAP hour alternate continuous nasal flow ) compare continuous NCPAP . High pressure ventilator continuous NCPAP possibly remain underlying mechanism pressure volume induce injury lung exhaustion respiratory muscle . Prolonged ventilation may predispose diaphragmatic myofibril disuse atrophy failure normal growth , contributes , difficulty wean infant mechanical ventilator support include Nasal continuous positive airway pressure ( NCPAP ) . Age gestation dependent change contractile function diaphragm include decrease fatigue resistance advance maturation Ventilator Induced Diaphragmatic Dysfunction ( VIDD ) . The combination high work , rapid breathing , low-oxidative capacity suggest respiratory muscle fatigue infant respiratory disease . Even short-term control mechanical ventilation produce significant remodel functional alteration diaphragm , could impede effort discontinue ventilator support . Prolonged use mechanical ventilation also associate infection , subglottic stenosis aspiration . Therefore , clinician strive wean early ventilator avoid reintubation infant extubated . Clinical sign respiratory failure extubation include apnea ( prolonged cessation respiration 20 second and/or associate cyanosis ; abrupt , mark pallor hypotonia ; bradycardia ) , respiratory acidosis increase oxygen requirement . These problem may lead reintubation ventilation attendant morbidity economic cost . NCPAP appear stabilize upper airway , improve lung function reduce apnea . Randomized trial show NCPAP , apply prophylactically extubation , reduces need additional ventilatory support associate low incidence BPD compare mechanical ventilation . NCPAP support compliant chest wall neonate provide pneumatic splint counteract tendency move paradoxically inspiration collapse upon expiration . NCPAP use prevent extubation failure alternative intubation ventilation respiratory distress syndrome preterm infant . The optimal method wean infant NCPAP remain unanswered . Although Neonatal intensive care unit try abrupt discontinuation NCPAP , wean ad hoc basis gradually decrease either time spent Infant Flow Driver ( IFD ) NCPAP pressure . Early discontinuation NCPAP may carry risk pulmonary atelectasis , apnea bradycardia . The common reason failure wean NCPAP respiratory acidosis , apneas , bradycardia , increase oxygen requirement 60 % . Similarly , common reason re-ventilation respiratory acidosis . In prospective study 2011 preterm infant resolve respiratory distress syndrome , NCPAP impede systemic pulmonary venous return compromise systemic arterial pressure heart rate . The important issue , therefore , rationale continue NCPAP supplemental oxygen requirement end , absence moderate-to-severe apnea . Mechanical ventilation NCPAP tend cause barotraumas possibly BPD premature infant . It unclear whether preterm infant undergo NCPAP cycling free flow oxygen less risk BPD compare dependent continuous NCPAP . In randomized controlled trial discontinuation NCPAP 2011 , author find almost preterm infant breathe room air tolerate 6 hour pause NCPAP increase apnea bradycardia . A reduction subsequent use NCPAP also observe . These finding lead development strategy reduce ventilator induced trauma thus BPD . This strategy use non-invasive intermittent continuous positive airway pressure ventilation alternate NCPAP continuous nasal flow ( CNF ) via nasal prong ELBW infant . This method ventilation term cycle NCPAP . In subjective clinical experience , cycle NCPAP CNF reduce duration respiratory support therefore would expect reduce incidence BPD . Cycling reduce duration NCPAP dependency , trauma deviation nasal septum , feed intolerance due gastric distension , agitation pain/discomfort nosocomial infection . The benefit cycle NCPAP comparison continuous NCPAP premature infant study clinical trial . The aim pilot study establish ability NCPAP cycling prevent reintubation , decrease duration respiratory support thereby , incidence BPD . Rationale study : There evidence literature premature infant treat NCPAP cycle alternate continuous nasal air flow ( CNF ) versus NCPAP without alternate CNF good bad immediate newborn period . We speculate NCPAP cycle wean gradually shift work breathe supportive intervention baby without produce fatigue respiratory muscle trauma develop lung . Currently , mode respiratory support use Neonatal intensive care unit . It largely determine personal preference little clinical data , experimental anecdotal evidence without long-term outcome data . A retrospective study confirm benefit cycle NCPAP CNF versus continuous NCPAP feasible since duration alternative therapy vary infant different gestational age . There equipoise regard role cycling NCPAP CNF versus continuous NCPAP without CNF premature infant . Therefore , would prudent study benefit NCPAP cycle versus continuous NCPAP premature infant . Our pilot study address importance NCPAP cycling useful wean mode ELBW infant . Results pilot study inform future power sample size calculation large randomize control trial . Information obtain study also fill gap exist knowledge neonatal medicine resolve current controversy concern use NCPAP cycling CNF versus continuous NCPAP ELBW infant . Hypothesis : We hypothesize infant receive NCPAP cycle CNF successfully wean nasal prong 72 hour compare continuous NCPAP . Rationale pilot study : Our pilot study initial preliminary investigation design test research hypothesis , gather data , validate scientific approach methodology NCPAP CNF cycle versus continuous NCPAP .
