	<brief_title>REVITIVE Treatment Patients With Venous Insufficiency</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This pilot randomise control trial ass efficacy neuromuscular electrical stimulation device improve venous blood flow patient ' symptom patient chronic venous insufficiency . The Revitive IX device neuromuscular electrical stimulation device give wide pulse pattern electrical stimulation via foot pad . A cycle treatment consist 30 minute programme 15 varying waveform last minute . Twenty patient venous insufficiency screen accord eligibility criterion . Patients randomise either treatment control ( sham device ) group . Patients advise use device 30 minute day , everyday , 6 week . Compliance monitor data logger diary card . Primary outcome measure : ) improvement venous haemodynamics . Secondary outcome measure : 1. improvement low limb oedema 2. improvement clinical symptom 3. reduction low limb pain discomfort 4. improvement quality life measure 5. device satisfaction .</detailed_description>
