	<brief_summary>This research study investigate use smart low limb robotic exoskeleton ( developed CSIC , Spain ) rehabilitation stroke . It compare robotic-assisted rehabilitation supervise motor practice . Additionally , also examine use noninvasive scalp electroencephalography ( EEG ) learn specific brain wave pattern associate learn walk power low limb exoskeleton . The finding use understand human-robot interaction design smart orthotic device control thought activity assist lose part walk ability .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Stroke lead cause neurological disability United States account poor physical health social dysfunction evident survivor . Gait impairment large contributor long-term disability ambulatory function daily live . Many patient , however , lose ability walk independently , furthermore , large proportion regain normal walk speed follow stroke . In context , new robotic-aided therapeutic tool `` wearable '' lower-limb robotic exoskeleton develop , allow user augment mechanically actuated low limb joint either completely partially assist movement low limb segment depend patient need . The H2 exoskeleton ( develop Technaid S.L. , Spain ) example one system hip , knee ankle joint actuate low limb . These device new , therefore , systematic investigation therapeutic benefit device lack field . Further , nature plasticity brain trigger wear training exoskeleton unknown . In exploratory research study , investigator aim compare robotic-assisted rehabilitation use H2 exoskeleton supervise motor practice particularly term functional recovery . Additionally , study also examine brain plasticity associate robotic-assisted training use non-invasive scalp electroencephalography ( EEG ) change low limb joint kinematics robotic-assisted training . Taken together , finding research use understand human-robot interaction design smart power orthotic device control directly brain activity assist lose part walk ability due neurological disease injury . Moreover , study systematically track neuroplasticity associate functional recovery stroke , help determine optimal window treatment would maximize therapeutic benefit . Lastly , also help characterize marker learn use new device , important clinical set modify adapt rehabilitation protocol suit change need patient ( user ) .</detailed_description>
