	<brief_summary>Voluntary involuntary attention process think play important role development maintenance anxiety disorder include OCD . Individuals OCD pay great attention threat information relate illness difficulty shift attention trigger . Studies suggest change attention bias may lead change anxiety vulnerability . However , study directly examine causal role attention bias maintenance anxiety underlie OCD whether modification bias may reduce pathological anxiety symptom particularly child . In proposal , aim translate basic finding research cognitive bias anxiety novel computerize intervention child Obsessive Compulsive Disorder ( OCD ) . The treatment design target basic cognitive vulnerability OCD , namely selective processing threaten OCD-related information . 52 child OCD randomly assign either 12-session attention modification program ( AMP ) attention control condition ( ACC ) . Clinical assessment symptom severity along brief neurocognitive battery conduct treatment . We hypothesize child AMP group end treatment show ( 1 ) decrease attention bias OCD-related trigger use independent measure attention bias assess change ( b ) reduce OCD severity . This study initial step towards demonstrate feasibility efficacy novel computerized attention train program OCD ultimately may prove highly transportable accessible intervention childhood psychiatric disorder .

	<detailed_description>In proposal , aim translate basic finding research cognitive bias anxiety novel computerize intervention child OCD . The treatment design target basic cognitive vulnerability OCD , namely selective processing threaten OCD-related information . Briefly , computerized procedure involve repeatedly redirect participant ' attention away OCD-relevant threat cue order induce selective processing neutral ( non-threat ) stimulus . This study initial step towards demonstrate efficacy potentially highly transportable accessible intervention OCD . Furthermore , project also examine neurocognitive performance attention modification elucidate possible predictor mechanisms treatment response . Aim 1 : To examine preliminary efficacy 12-session computerized attention modification program ( AMP ) attention bias symptom severity child OCD . Hypothesis 1a : AMP treatment compare attention control condition ( ACC ) associate decrease attention bias towards threat-cues youth OCD . Hypothesis 1b : AMP treatment associate decrease OCD symptom severity among OCD youth measure clinician-administered diagnostic interview symptom rating scale . Aim 2 : To examine change neurocognitive status course treatment AMP child adolescent OCD . Hypothesis 2 : Those child respond AMP exhibit improve performance relevant neurocognitive measure post-treatment . Aim 3 : To examine relationship baseline neurocognitive status response AMP . Hypothesis 3 : Baseline neurocognitive performance associate great AMP-related improvement symptom severity among youth OCD . Exploratory Aim : To investigate potential relationship AMP change behavioral electrophysiological ( EEG ) correlate cognitive control affect regulation treatment AMP ACC . The objective examine feasibility , acceptability suitability use Error-Related Negativity ( ERN ) , evoke response potential ( ERP ) generate cognitive activation paradigm assess action-monitoring conflict resolution neutral emotional context , elucidate potential neural mechanism underlie treatment . Although powered formal test mediation , explore preliminary fashion whether neural index may serve potential biomarkers pediatric OCD well predictors/mediators treatment response . Preliminary hypothesis : 1 ) Youth OCD characterize high amplitude ERN , change treatment ; 2 ) AMP treatment associate change EEG reflect great engagement top-down ( indexed P3 component ) versus bottom-up ( indexed P1/N1 component ) neural process , particularly among child exhibit improved performance cognitive control task ; 3 ) Baseline executive function interference control action monitoring associate great AMP-related improvement OCD severity ; 4 ) We also explore relationship key variable trait anxiety , self-reported attention control , baseline OCD symptom severity attention bias response AMP . OCD chronic often disable psychiatric condition , affect 2-4 % child adolescents1 . In absence effective treatment , often associate considerable social , academic familial impairment along considerable psychiatric comorbidity include Tourette 's Chronic Tic Disorders . Although number empirically support treatment , behavioral pharmacological , exist OCD , many child family either able adequately access treatment derive partial benefit . Thus , critical importance expand treatment option develop effective treatment potential widely accessible child suffer OCD . One etiological model OCD propose symptom arise abnormal process threat-relevant information . According model , selective attention threaten information heightens anxiety anxiety-related avoidance perceive threat , avoidance behavior , turn , prevent disconfirmation fear-related beliefs serf maintain anxiety . Thus , attention bias towards threat may causally related behavioral avoidance perceive threat . Research indicate attention bias towards OCD relate material ameliorates effective cognitive behavioral therapy , thus highlight attention bias malleable . Nevertheless , critical question remain whether reduction attention bias cause reduction OCD symptoms whether attention bias epiphenomenon symptom . Recently , study begin directly manipulate attention bias address question . In one study , attention train adult OCD contamination fear build contingency location OCD-related word active condition control condition modify dot-probe task . Participants attention training group show significant reduction attention bias threat OCD symptom severity . The extension research clinical patient child sample multi-session treatment protocol yet conduct . To date , study investigate attention training child OCD , although data suggest positive result adult OCD well Social Phobia Generalized Anxiety Disorder . A number recent study demonstrate willful direction attention presence threaten stimuli activates prefrontal region think involved attention control , turn appear down-regulate activation amygdala , structure involve emotional processing fear/threat stimulus . Many task involve technique like cognitive reappraisal alter cognitive processing threatening . The question remain whether similar neurobiological mechanism underlie effect attention training . Given importance higher-level attention control reduce bias attention process dampen anxious state , help anxious individual improve attention control may important mechanism reduce negative impact development psychopathology . In attempt gather preliminary data possible neurocognitive predictor mechanisms treatment response , also plan assess aspect response inhibition memory/learning implicated neurocognitive study OCD treatment AMP . We hypothesize train attention away OCD-related threat stimulus decrease attention bias towards threat base assumption attention bias causally relate anxiety symptom , decrease bias would lead decrease avoidance threaten stimulus . More specifically , predict compare control condition ( ACC ) , AMP decrease attention bias towards threat facilitate behavioral approach towards fear stimuli child OCD along overall decrease symptom severity . The present study focus child adolescent two important reason . First , OCD typically onsets childhood , enhance understanding neuro-developmental correlate OCD mechanisms underlie treatment age potential prevent long-term morbidity . Second , focus age group allow u study disorder prior development significant secondary psychiatric psychosocial morbidity , commonly accompany OCD adulthood . Thus far , limited research effect attention modification train OCD severity conduct child . This study may generate significant new information concern neurocognitive underpinnings OCD , commonality underpinnings neurodevelopmental disorder childhood , neurocognitive correlate response potentially new relatively accessible nonpharmacological treatment intervention . This knowledge use develop effective treatment eye towards match intervention specific individual basis characteristic pre-treatment cognitive profile .</detailed_description>
