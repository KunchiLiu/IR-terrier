	<brief_summary>In present study , investigator want investigate whether prior BCG-vaccination improves efficacy influenza ( `` flu '' ) vaccination young and/or old healthy volunteer consequently could protect influenza virus infection .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Effects BCG Influenza Induced Immune Response</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Influenza virus infection lead million case severe illness worldwide estimate 500.000 death annually . The potential sudden emergence pandemic influenza strain represent incessant threat even large scale . seasonal influenza vaccination backbone influenza management . However , antibody generate vaccination , often effectively neutralize emergent strain due high mutation rate influenza viral genome . In addition , although vaccination effective 85 % healthy adult , 40-60 % elderly able mount protective antibody response due agerelated decline immune function ( so-called immunoscenescence ) . As result , protective effect influenza vaccination limit , strategy improve host immune defenses influenza virus infection per se , follow influenza vaccination , highly warrant . It suggest prior vaccination Bacille Calmette-Guérin ( BCG ) could enhance resistance infectious disease addition protection tuberculosis ( TBC ) , mice , protection prior BCGvaccination influenza infection demonstrate long ago . However , recently substantial evidence nonspecific beneficial effect BCG-vaccination human provide several randomized clinical trial . Considering potentiate effect BCG-vaccination , could viable strategy improve efficacy influenza vaccination , and/or enhance immune defenses influenza virus infection per se . If , would enormous impact clinical practice .</detailed_description>
