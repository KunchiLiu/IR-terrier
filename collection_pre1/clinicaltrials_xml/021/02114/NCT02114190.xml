	<detailed_description>Adolescent obesity one major global health challenge 21st century . Currently , 35 % adolescent overweight ( BMI &gt; 85th percentile ) , one six diagnose metabolic syndrome . While adoption maintenance healthful dietary practice identify high priority topic future research , endure treatment strategy identify . The cause adolescent obesity multi-factorial ; psychological family factor largely contribute epidemic along biological environmental influence . However , majority standard weight loss program fail adequately address impact psychological factor eat behavior beneficial contribution parental involvement make dietary change overweight adolescent population . Meditation-based program may improve efficacy establish weight-loss intervention adolescent address key psychological variable affect weight . Mindfulness-Based Stress Reduction ( MBSR ) well-established , systematic patient-centered educational approach use train mindfulness meditation increase awareness ability respond skillfully experience contribute emotional distress maladaptive behavior . The efficacy MBSR reduce psychological distress symptom stress adult consistently show controlled study . Significant improvement physiological measure relate metabolic syndrome include blood pressure , cholesterol , glycemic control also demonstrate . Similar meditation program successfully implement adolescent address problem hypertension , depression , eat behavior . Furthermore , recent expansion mindfulness program include family relationship show immense potential broadening customarily individual focus meditation-based intervention include broad factor think influence adolescent health outcome . This important give great involvement family think increase effectiveness intervention aim adolescent weight control , weight maintenance weight loss . Recently , researcher begin modify MBSR program specifically populations attempt make dietary health change . One newly modify program adult Mindful Eating &amp; Living ( MEAL ) , brief 6-session program design teach skill lead increased awareness eating , emotion , judgment . Preliminary data research adult show significant change eat behavior obesity relate problem , include reduced psychological distress , regulation intake pattern , disorder eating , improve metabolic regulation , weight loss . Although theoretically compelling , mindful eating intervention never examine overweight adolescent population . Thus , unprecedented opportunity exist develop systematic program research investigate mindfulness approach eat behavior weight loss specifically tailor adolescent family . This critical give adolescence period special developmental consideration , clear weight loss program develop child adult effective adolescent . Interventions aim adolescent eat behavior meet mixed success , theorize may due , part , inadequate understanding factor ( e.g . psychological family-based ) associate eating behavior among adolescent need addressed intervention . To address gap , study proposes systematically adapt , pilot , refine , evaluate developmentally appropriate Mindful Eating intervention overweight adolescent base current protocol format teach adult MEAL program . We design three-phase iterative development process include : 1 ) community key informant consultant input ; 2 ) beta-testing refinement program ; 3 ) formal pilot test . Study aim include : Aim 1 : Adapt mindful eat intervention protocol ( Mindful Eating -A ) overweight adolescent population ( BMI ≥ 85th percentile ) , age 14-17 . The intervention tailor unique developmental challenge adolescence , suitable use apply community setting , demonstrate feasibility acceptability . Aim 2 : Develop 'family enhance mindful eat -A ' ( Mindful Eating -A+F ) intervention protocol integrate family system perspective Mindful Eating -A . The goal expand focus Mindful Eating -A include family factor influence adolescent eating behavior . These include food-related parenting style , food organization behavior , family support , parent ' eating-related behavior . Mindful Eating -A+F demonstrate feasibility , acceptability , suitable use apply community setting . Aim 3 : To examine overall efficacy optimize Mindful Eating -A+F , relative Mindful Eating -A intervention . Within examination , post-treatment 3-month follow-up comparison across two treatment approach make . Effect size within treatment assess . We expect Mindful Eating -A+F show strong endure effect Mindful Eating -A alone adolescent outcome . Primary outcome include adolescent weight , BMI , eat behavior . Secondary outcome include adolescent 's marker metabolic syndrome , psychological distress , family barrier , mindfulness .</detailed_description>
