	<brief_title>Balloon Dilation Selected Subjects With Refractory Eustachian Tube Dysfunction</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The Eustachian tube biological tube connects back nose middle ear . It usually close need actively open action certain muscle swallow , yawn , activity keep air pressure middle ear ( part ear behind eardrum ) air pressure environment . If Eustachian tube open swallowing , middle-ear pressure progressively decrease person may feel `` stuffed '' and/or `` full '' middle ear , may difficulty hear and/or may develop fluid middle ear . The usual treatment Eustachian tube open well insert tiny tube ( call ventilation tympanostomy tube ) eardrum keep air pressure middle ear environment . However , tube naturally `` fall '' time , Eustachian tube open function improve place , new tube need insert . In past year , doctor U.S. Europe describe simple procedure call `` balloon dilation Eustachian tube '' ( BDET ) `` balloon tuboplasty '' believe correct underlying cause Eustachian tube dysfunction resolve symptom , sign consequence . For procedure , tiny balloon insert Eustachian tube , inflate physically open Eustachian tube , deflate remove . Doctors use method adult child symptom Eustachian tube dysfunction report BDET safe cause short-term , perhaps , long-term resolution symptom . However , one measure Eustachian tube function procedure , know BDET truly improve function , , function change . In study , enroll adult subject tympanostomy tube insert least one eardrum chronic perforation least one eardrum physician-diagnosed Eustachian tube dysfunction middle-ear fluid document presence/absence measurable Eustachian tube dysfunction use standard test . If present , determine Eustachian tube dysfunction improve medical treatment disease know cause Eustachian tube dysfunction . If Eustachian tube dysfunction significantly improve , perform BDET procedure measure change Eustachian tube function different time procedure .</detailed_description>
