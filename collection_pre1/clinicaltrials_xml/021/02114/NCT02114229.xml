	<brief_summary>This study incorporate alisertib , small-molecule inhibitor Aurora A activity , treatment patient young 22 year age . Patients recurrent refractory AT/RT MRT receive alisertib single agent . Patients newly diagnose AT/RT receive alisertib part age- risk-adapted chemotherapy . Radiation therapy give child ≥12 month age . Patients AT/RT concurrent extra-CNS MRT eligible . Alisertib administer single agent day 1-7 21-day cycle recurrent patient enrol Stratum A . For patient newly diagnose stratum ( B , C D ) , alisertib administer sequence chemotherapy radiotherapy . This study 3 primary stratum : ( A ) child recurrent/progressive AT/RT extra-CNS MRT , ( B ) child &lt; 36 months-old newly diagnose AT/RT , ( C ) child &gt; 36 month old newly diagnose AT/RT . Children concurrent MRT treat accord age risk stratification scheme outline stratum B C additional treatment local control . Children synchronous AT/RT treat age CNS risk-appropriate therapy , also receive surgery and/or radiation therapy local control non-CNS tumor . PRIMARY OBJECTIVES - To estimate sustained objective response rate disease stabilization pediatric patient recurrent progressive AT/RT ( atypical teratoid rhabdoid tumor CNS ) ( Stratum A1 ) treat alisertib determine response sufficient merit continue investigation alisertib population . - To estimate sustained objective response rate disease stabilization pediatric patient recurrent progressive extra-CNS MRT ( malignant rhabdoid tumor outside CNS ) ( Stratum A2 ) treat alisertib determine response sufficient merit continue investigation alisertib population . - To estimate 3-year PFS rate patient newly diagnose AT/RT young 36 month age diagnosis metastatic disease ( Stratum B1 ) treat alisertib sequence induction consolidation chemotherapy radiation therapy ( depend age ) determine rate sufficient merit continue investigation alisertib population . - To estimate 1-year PFS rate patient newly diagnose AT/RT young 36 month age diagnosis , metastatic disease ( Stratum B2 ) treat alisertib sequence induction consolidation chemotherapy determine rate sufficient merit continue investigation alisertib population . - To estimate 3-year PFS rate patient newly diagnose AT/RT 3 year age great diagnosis metastatic disease gross total resection near total resection ( Stratum C1 ) treat alisertib sequence radiation therapy consolidation chemotherapy determine rate sufficient merit continue investigation alisertib population . - To estimate 1-year PFS rate patient newly diagnose AT/RT 3 year age great diagnosis metastatic residual disease ( Stratum C2 ) treat alisertib sequence radiation therapy consolidation chemotherapy determine rate sufficient merit continue investigation alisertib population . - To characterize pharmacokinetics pharmacodynamics alisertib pediatric patient relate drug disposition toxicity . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES - To estimate duration objective response PFS patient recurrent/progressive AT/RT MRT ( Strata A1 A2 ) . - To estimate PFS OS distribution patient newly diagnose AT/RT ( Strata B1 , B2 , B3 , C1 C2 ) . - To describe toxicity experience patient treated trial , specifically toxicities alisertib administer single agent combination therapy multiple course toxicity relate proton photon radiation therapy . - To describe pattern local distant failure newly diagnose patient ( Strata B1 , B2 , B3 , C1 C2 ) . Local control relative primary-site radiation therapy , criterion infield , marginal , distant failure also report descriptively .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Phase 2 Study Alisertib Therapy Rhabdoid Tumors</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>We propose study 3 primary treatment stratum accord participant 's previous treatment , age presence extra-CNS disease , substrata presence focal metastatic disease : - STRATUM A - RECURRENT OR PROGRESSIVE DISEASE : Patients &lt; 22 year age diagnosis recurrent progressive MRT ( either CNS and/or extra-CNS ) measurable disease define protocol . - Stratum A1 : patient AT/RT ( CNS MRT ) . - Stratum A2 : patient extra-CNS MRT ( patient concurrent progression AT/RT MRT eligible therapy , data analyze separately ) . - Stratum A3 : patient synchronous AT/RT extra-CNS MRT - STRATUM B - NEWLY DIAGNOSED DISEASE IN YOUNG CHILDREN &lt; 36 MONTHS : Patients &lt; 36 month age diagnosis CNS-AT/RT , prior therapy : - Stratum B1 : Patients metastatic disease ( M0 ) . - Stratum B2 : Patients metastatic disease ( M+ ) regardless degree resection . - Stratum B3 : Patients CSF lumbar puncture obtain clinical reason evidence metastatic disease ( MX ) . - STRATUM C - NEWLY DIAGNOSED DISEASE IN CHILDREN &gt; 3 YEARS : Patients &gt; 3 year ( 36 month ) age diagnosis AT/RT , prior therapy : - Stratum C1 : Patients gross total ( GTR ) near total resection ( NTR ) define &lt; 1.5 cm2 residual tumor , metastatic disease . - Stratum C2 : Patients metastatic disease ( M+ ) and/or bulky residual tumor &gt; 1.5 cm^2 . STRATUM D - SYNCHRONOUS EXTRANEURAL AT/RT EXTRA-CNS MRT : Treatment base extent CNS extra-CNS disease . CNS-directed therapy give accord Strata B1 , B2 , C1 C2 accord age metastatic status . In addition , patient may receive irradiation accord best clinical management local control extra-CNS disease . - Stratum D1 : Patients &lt; 36 month time diagnosis synchronous AT/RT extra-CNS MRT metastatic CNS disease ( M0 ) . - Stratum D2 : Patients &lt; 36 month time diagnosis synchronous AT/RT extra- CNS MRT metastatic CNS disease ( M+ ) . - Stratum D3 : Patients &lt; 36 month time diagnosis synchronous AT/RT extra-CNS MRT CSF lumbar puncture obtain clinical reason without evidence metastatic disease ( MX ) - Stratum D4 : Patients ≥ 36 month time diagnosis synchronous extra-CNS MRT without metastatic CNS disease regardless degree tumor resection . Biological parent participant ATRT/MRT may consent provide genomic blood specimen DNA extraction analysis . OVERVIEW OF TREATMENT PLAN : Patients recurrent disease ( Stratum A ) receive alisertib single agent day 1-7 21 day . Newly diagnose patient ( Strata B , C D ) receive alisertib sequence chemo radiotherapy . Patients sub-strata B1 D1 receive focal RT &gt; 12 month age . Patients sub-strata B2 D2 , disseminate disease receive CNS radiation therapy ( RT ) . Patients sub-strata C1/C2/D4 receive risk-stratified craniospinal irradiation ( CSI ) boost primary tumor site follow adjuvant chemotherapy . Patients sub-strata B3 D3 receive therapy similar sub-strata B2 D2 consider local radiotherapy depend age , response therapy , subsequent metastatic staging . Those patient concurrent CNS extra-CNS MRT may undergo irradiation extra-CNS MRT accord best clinical management addition CNS direct therapy . Alisertib administer eligible patient supervision investigator identify sub-investigator ( ) .</detailed_description>

Myocardial infarction within 6 month prior enrollment New York Heart Association Class III IV heart failure , uncontrolled angina , severe uncontrolled ventricular arrhythmia , electrocardiographic evidence acute ischemia active conduction system abnormality . If reason electrocardiogram obtain study enrollment , abnormality detect document clinically irrelevant . Other severe acute chronic medical psychiatric condition , include uncontrolled diabetes , malabsorption , resection pancreas upper smallbowel , requirement pancreatic enzyme , condition would modify absorption oral medication small bowel laboratory abnormality may increase risk associate study participation investigational product administration may interfere interpretation study result , judgment investigator , would make patient inappropriate enrollment study .</criteria>
