	<criteria>Male female subject confirm diagnosis sickle cell disease ( HbSS HBSÎ²0 thalassemia ) age 18 65 year , inclusive Subjects treat hydroxyurea must stable dose least 8 week , intent remain dose hydroxyurea throughout clinical trial include protocolspecified followup period . Subjects treat hydroxyurea plan begin treatment study period . Body Mass Index ( BMI ) 17.5 35 kg/m2 ; total body weight &gt; 40 kg ( 88 lbs History recent major surgery , within 3 month baseline visit . Serious infection ( require hospitalization parenteral antibiotic ) within 1 month baseline visit . History cerebrovascular accident seizure disorder . Subjects history clinically significant orthostatic blood pressure ( BP ) change clinically significant orthostatic symptom . Known previous diagnosis acute hepatitis aetiology Hepatitis B C Human immunodeficiency virus ( HIV ) infection . History malignancy except subject basal squamos cell cancer treat fully resolve minimum 5 year . History evidence cardiac disease include : myocardial infarction , cardiac arrhythmia Systemic therapy follow medication strong moderate CYP3A4 inhibitor within 7 day 5 halflives ( whichever longer ) CYP3A inducer within 28 day prior first dose trial medication , trial . Use PDE5 inhibitor within 7 day prior first dose trial medication , time trial . Creatinine clearance &lt; 30ml/min . Hemoglobin level &lt; 6 gm/dL . Alanine transaminase ( ALT/SGPT ) Aspartate aminotransferase ( AST/SGOT ) &gt; 2x upper limit normal , ( base clinic laboratory normal range ) . Any condition possibly affect drug absorption ( eg , gastrectomy ) . A positive urine drug screen illicit drug . History regular alcohol consumption exceed 14 drinks/week female 21 drinks/week male ( 1 drink = 5 ounce ( 150 mL ) wine 12 ounce ( 360 mL ) beer 1.5 ounce ( 45 mL ) hard liquor ) within 6 month Screening . Treatment investigational drug within 2 month ( determined local requirement , whichever long ) 5 halflives precede first dose study medication . 12lead ECG demonstrate QTc &gt; 450 QRS interval &gt; 120 msec msec Screening . Other severe acute chronic medical psychiatric condition laboratory abnormality may increase risk associate study participation investigational product administration may interfere interpretation study result , judgment investigator , would make subject inappropriate entry study . A family history long QT syndrome and/or ECG abnormalities screen randomization , include list : Subjects prerandomization evidence QTcF prolongation ( define &gt; 450 m ) screen baseline eligible randomization . Predominant heart rhythm normal sinus rhythm eg , atrial fibrillation , atrial flutter , supraventricular tachycardia . Atrioventricular ( AV ) block great first degree . Use concomitant medication prolong QT/QTc interval Pregnant female , breast feeding female females childbearing potential ; male female subject childbearing potential unwilling unable use highly effective method contraception outline protocol duration study least 30 day last dose investigational product . Subjects lack capacity consent .</criteria>
