	<brief_summary>This Randomized Controlled Trial ( RCT ) regard conservative treatment Patellofemoral Pain Syndrome ( PFPS ) . Patellofemoral Pain Syndrome ( PFPS ) common cause knee pain young active adult high rate recurrent and/or chronic occurrence . PFPS notoriously difficult treat refer `` one vexatious clinical challenge rehabilitative medicine '' . Its etiology unclear commonly think relate pathomechanics patellofemoral joint ( PFJ ) . There many factor influence PFJ mechanic . Among , quadriceps strength time show important . As , treatment PFPS traditionally base correction pathomechanics influence quadriceps strength timing . However , grow body evidence reveal importance strength control hip abduction external rotation PFPS . Hip strength ab/adduction rotation think influence femoral position patellofemoral joint , thereby affect PFJ mechanic . Several cohort small RCT study within last 7 year show additional exercise hip strength control give improve effect pain function compare quadriceps base train alone . A small RCT 2012 compare isolated hip strengthen exercise control group find surprisingly good result pain function hip strengthen group . The investigator plan RCT isolate hip strengthen compare traditional quadriceps train control group receive structure training . Primary outcome pain function . This high-quality study include 40-50 patient group , make one large kind conservative treatment PFPS . In contrast vast majority study type , study also include men , potentially help fill significant gap literature subject . The investigator study therefore important contribution elucidate etiology PFPS improve treatment option men woman future . As well , role psychometric parameter examine standardized clinical test hip abduction endurance develop .</brief_summary>
