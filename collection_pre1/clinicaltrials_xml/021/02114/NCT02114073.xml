	<brief_title>Comparison Effect Postoperative Cyclosporine A 2 % Ophthalmic Emulsion Betamethasone Eye Drop Surgical Success Trabeculectomy Procedure</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Trabeculectomy still popular filter surgery glaucomatous patient . In type surgery , postoperative care management highly important surgical success . A principle component postoperative regimen anti-inflammatory medication . However , corticosteroid eye drop , frequently use agent , side effect , include raise intraocular pressure . Cyclosporine A could interesting alternative , acceptable anti-inflammatory effect could reduce ocular surface problem , also minimal direct effect intraocular pressure . In study , compare effect topical cyclosporine A betamethasone surgical outcome postoperative course trabeculectomy patient . The study prospective study compare effect topical betamethasone cyclosporine A postoperative finding glaucoma patient , undergo trabeculectomy surgery . In study , trabeculectomy patient , fulfill study criterion , randomize either study group follow-up visit do masked fashion . In visit , detailed history take eye examination do examiner unaware study group . A third party would data control patient safety . At conclusion study , data two group would compare . All human research ethical code strictly respect Ethical Committee University ongoing inspection study step . We hypothesize cyclosporine A could provide good inflammation intraocular pressure control may enhance surgical success rate . However , null hypothesis result study group differ statistically significantly .</detailed_description>
