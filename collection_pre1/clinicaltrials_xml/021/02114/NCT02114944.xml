	<brief_summary>Patients severe chronic disease often admit hospital complain shortness breath . Some patient decide want placement breathe tube windpipe assist breathing . In situation , patient treat oxygen , variety medication like morphine mask connect breathe machine , something call bilevel positive airway pressure ( BiPAP ) noninvasive ventilation ( NIV ) , help breathing . Not much know much noninvasive ventilation help patient , especially comfortable feel much family think help . Our aim monitor use way help breathe patient n't want breathe tube , see often noninvasive ventilation use ask survive patient , patient 's family caregiver experience noninvasive ventilation much seem help . With finding , hope improve use noninvasive ventilation patient come way relieve shortness breath provide much comfort possible .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Treatment Dyspnea Do-not-intubate Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Background : Respiratory symptom , dyspnea acute respiratory failure often report patient admitted Hospital do-not-intubate ( DNI ) order . These patient routinely treat medical therapy , sometimes reverse underlying process , also often achieve palliation . The therapy include opioids anxiolytic , oxygen , CPAP non-invasive ventilation ( NIV ) depend underlying disease . Rationale : Considering available data palliative use NIV limit short-term prognosis collect select DNI patient among subject already receive NIV treatment . A prospective observational study focus therapy offer patient enter hospital switch DNI status hospitalization would helpful fill blank regard current palliative treatment dyspnea critically ill DNI patient . The assessment patient ' symptom comfort family member ' perspective would important understand discussion healthcare proxy family address relation end-of life-decisions . In addition , collection health care provider ' impression use different treatment alleviate dyspnea respiratory distress situation could help good understand implement palliative treatment respiratory symptom DNI patient . Our aim monitor establish prevalence use NIV among DNI patient assess patient , family member ' caregiver ' perspective patient 's experience NIV relative approach palliate symptom . Study design : A prospective , observational study enrol consecutive patient dyspnea and/or acute respiratory failure DNI order admit study site . Study procedure : Subjects participate study treat per hospital procedure accord attend physician order , maintain oxygen saturation target level optimize patient comfort use anxiolytic narcotic indicate . No change standard care perform base participation study . Some data ( demographic , medication , vitals , arterial blood gas , history present illnes past medical history , treatment plan ) extract medical record . A daily assessment dyspnea score ( Numeric rating scale , ( NRS ) ) , comfort ( NRS ) pain ( NRS ) perform . Patients family member ask fill questionnaire day 3 . Heal care provider ( attend physician , nurse RT ) ask fill questionnaire discharge . Family member and/or patient contact phone 30 day discharge get additional information patient 's outcome . Research plan : Demographics baseline characteristic patient summarize group overall cohort ( DNI NIV , DNI CPAP , DNI ventilator support ) . Continuous variable report mean Â± standard deviation . Categorical variable report n % . For primary outcome , one-way ANOVA use compare difference mean group . If data normally distribute , Krusman-Wallis test performed . Regression analysis also conduct evaluate consistency treatment effect across cohort , control potential confounding factor baseline . A Chi-square test ( Fisher 's exact test count 5 ) use compare distribution categorical outcome group . Where appropriate , generalized linear model fit categorical count data evaluate consistency treatment effect across cohort , control potential confounding factor baseline .</detailed_description>
