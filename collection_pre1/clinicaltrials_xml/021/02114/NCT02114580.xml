	<brief_summary>The propose study aim explore brain mechanism mediate cognitive benefit aerobic exercise patient mild cognitive impairment- prodromal stage Alzheimer disease . We perform FMRI experiment , well laboratory behavioral test advance knowledge nature mechanism . Participants participate individual- tailor aerobic training program . Pre post evaluation identify brain change follow training use advanced technique brain imaging . Cognitive performance assess prior end program , well endocrine marker reflect improvement learn ability . Moreover , demonstrate cortical plasticity subject aMCI tremendous practical significance subject .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Brain Plasticity Following Aerobic Exercise Patient With Mild Cognitive Impairment : Neuroimaging Study</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Mild cognitive impairment ( MCI ) , prodromal stage Alzheimer disease ( AD ) , refers transitional state cognition normal age dementia AD . To date , therapeutic approach AD symptomatic modest efficacy . Nontheless , recent study animal model healthy subject , show aerobic exercise affect brain plasticity . The current proposal aim explore brain mechanism mediate cognitive benefit aerobic exercise patient amnestic MCI ( aMCI ) , compare control group subject aMCI receive stretch exercise . More specifically , aim perform two fMRI experiment , advance knowledge nature mechanism cognitive benefit result aerobic exercise . Our preleminary result suggest subject aMCI show different hierarchy reliable response process long time scale auditory task . Therefore , first experiment , evaluate pattern temporal hierarchy language processing affect aerobic exercise . Next , explore whether aerobic exercise affect memory enocoding task , rely area medial temporal lobe bear heavy neuropathological burden MCI . The insight gain study may important clinical implication patient early stage Alzheimer 's disease</detailed_description>
