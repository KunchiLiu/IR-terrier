	<brief_summary>Background : Atrophic gastritis ( AG ) single important precursor condition gastric cancer ( GC ) know far . H. pylori infection important causative agent gastritis , subsequent AG . The GastroPanel test ( Biohit HealthCare , Helsinki , Finland ) , blood test evaluate four biomarkers specific gastric mucosa pepsinogen I ( P-PGI ) , pepsinogen II ( P-PGII ) , gastrin-17 ( P-G-17 ) H. pylorus antibody ( P-HpAb ) , first non-invasive diagnostic tool provide possibility detect patient risk GC peptic ulcer well malabsorption vitamin B12 , iron , magnesium , calcium drug . A well design clinical study warrant fully assess performance GastroPanel examination detect gastric lesion lead GC . The investigator aim perform clinical study adult population United Kingdom order determine diagnostic accuracy GastroPanel test evaluate AG specific gastric condition associate increase risk GC . Methods : Two hundred fifty patient ( 45 year old , gender ) enrol among patient dyspepsia refer gastroscopy Homerton University Hospital ( London , United Kingdom ) . During visit , patient subject gastroscopy examination , direct biopsy antrum corpus , follow protocol operative link gastritis assessment ( OLGA ) classification chronic gastritis Sydney Classification . Biopsies examine Pathology laboratory Homerton University Hospital interpret use OLGA stag system well Sydney system classification gastritis . Specific aim : The principal goal clinical trial establish performance GastroPanel examination detect AG specific gastric condition associate increase risk GC . In particular , investigator evaluate AG antrum , AG corpus , AG antrum corpus ( =atrophic pangastritis ) , biopsy-confirmed dysplasia ( intestinal metaplasia ) gastric mucosa . For condition , investigator calculate diagnostic accuracy GastroPanel test .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Gastropanel Gastric Atrophy Cancer Risk Assessment</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>At present , diagnosis gastric oesophageal disease , require endoscopic examination invasive , time-consuming expensive procedure . At present , non-invasive method ( e.g . test Helicobacter pylorus ) available diagnosis upper gastrointestinal tract disease . Any test , however , give possibility comprehensive diagnosis different phenotype gastritis , i.e. , whether superficial atrophic , locate antrum corpus . Importantly , test give clue severity ( grade ) lesion , define Sydney OLGA classification . To obviate excessive use invasive expensive procedure ( endoscopy ) , urgent need develop non-invasive diagnostic tool capable accurately detect patient high risk GC , i.e . different phenotype gastritis well relate H. pylori infection . After ELISA-testing P-PG I , p-PG II , P-G-17 P-Hp-Ab plasma sample , endoscopic examination preserve patient whose GastroPanel test result suggest AG , whereas endoscopic examination avoid subject negative GastroPanel result , test biomarkers indicate non-atrophic gastritis healthy stomach ( 18 ) . Gastroscopy also recommend GastroPanel examination reveals high acid output ( P-G-17 1,0 pmol/l ) chronic H. pylori infection symptom . This clinical trial conduct collaboration Biohit HealthCare ( Helsinki , Finland ) Homerton University Hospital ( London , UK ) ( hereafter call `` Partners '' ) . The study perform Homerton Hospital , supervise steer committee consist member research Partners . Enrolment patient study take place Homerton Hospital include consecutive patient 45 year age , refer gastroscopy Outpatient Department Endoscopy . The estimated cohort screen least 250 subject ( gender ) , reach cohort 100 patent enrich equal number ( n=25 ) condition ( see : Section 2 , ) classify study endpoint . Patient enrolment take place single step . In brief , potentially eligible patient identify among gastroscopy-referral outpatient member research team . At stage , every patient ask consent study sign write consent participate . Because patient enrol among subject attend 11 Endoscopy clinic due appointment gastroscopy , preparation compliant preparatory step need GastroPanel examination ( detail ) . Eligible patient adult female male , dyspeptic symptom ( epigastric pain , bloat epigastric discomfort ) . However , follow patient consider non-eligible : 1 ) patient whose treatment require surgery , immediate follow-up treatment major symptom , well 2 ) refuse participate . In study , patient examine GastroPanel test subject gastroscopy , provide histological confirmation use gold standard calculate performance indicator test . All patient participate study shall undergo routine gastroscopy examination , complement biopsy sample antrum corpus , accord principle Sydney OLGA classification sample . In endoscopy , observe abnormal mucosal lesion note photographed , necessary ( e.g . suspicion malignancy ) subject additional biopsy . All statistical analysis perform use SPSS 21.0.0 Windows ( IBM , NY , USA ) STATA/SE 13.0 software ( STATA Corp. , Texas , USA ) . The descriptive statistic do accord routine procedure . Performance indicator ( sensitivity , specificity , positive predictive value , PPV , negative predictive value , NPV 95 % CI ) individual marker whole GastroPanel test calculate separately study endpoint , use STATA/SE software diagti algorithm introduce Seed et al . ( 2001 ) . This algorithm also calculate area ROC ( Receiver Operating Characteristics ) call AUC , biomarker endpoint . Because GastroPanel quantitative ELISA test , ROC curve use identify optimal sensitivity/specificity balance give biomarker optimal threshold detection study endpoint . Significance difference AUC value estimate use STATA 's roccomb test 95 % CI .</detailed_description>
