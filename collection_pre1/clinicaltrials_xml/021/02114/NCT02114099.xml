	<detailed_description>Background Kawasaki disease ( KD ) characterize fever , bilateral nonexudative conjunctivitis , erythema lip oral mucosa , change extremity , rash , cervical lymphadenopathy . Incidence late coronary artery aneurysm ectasia , may lead myocardial infarction ( MI ) , sudden death , ischemic heart disease , decrease introduction intravenous immunoglobulin therapy . However , significant persistent coronary arterial lesion aneurysm may still occur 1-3 % patient . Aspirin warfarin , recommend medication prevent decrease incidence coronary artery event , ca n't guarantee coronary patency KD patient . Thus , 's urgent look effective safe treatment make sure coronary lesion stabilize even regress gradually . Several group study clinical characteristic KD patient coronary sequela show association elevate inflammatory marker persistence coronary lesion .
