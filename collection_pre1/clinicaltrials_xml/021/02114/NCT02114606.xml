	<brief_summary>The current endoscopic method diagnose monitor treatment response Eosinophilic Esophagitis ( EoE ) costly , inconvenient , risky . Novel diagnostic method need , minimally-invasive Cytosponge hold great promise . It show safe accurate Barrett 's esophagus , advantage ( string test ) obtain true tissue sample , preliminary data support study EoE . The propose prospective cohort study , conduct expert esophageal disease EoE , assess accuracy Cytosponge compare endoscopy biopsy EoE , determine safety acceptability technique . Use Cytosponge would fundamentally change paradigm clinical management EoE allow collection non-endoscopic esophageal biopsy , thus minimize need invasive test . It would also facilitate future genetic , mechanistic , pathogenesis research EoE .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Diagnosis Monitoring Eosinophilic Esophagitis Using Cytosponge</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Study design overview ( Aims ) This prospective cohort study , patient enrollment conduct UNC Mayo Clinic sample analysis perform University Cambridge . In Aim 1 , patient EoE enrol , tissue obtain Cytosponge endoscopy , method compare single time point determine accuracy Cytosponge quantify esophageal eosinophil count . In Aim 2 , patient treat followed tissue assess time Cytosponge endoscopy determine utility Cytosponge monitoring treatment response patient EoE . For patient , safety monitor subject complete survey acceptability Cytosponge ( Aim 3 ) . Cytosponge protocol : After study explain patient provide informed consent , Cytosponge administer prior endoscopy train research staff physician supervision . If subject opt receive local anesthetic , provide 2 % lidocaine gargle prior administration Cytosponge . The Cytosponge administer accord 's instruction use . After retrieval , string cut sponge ( contain tissue specimen ) place container , immersed fixative , store refrigerator 4 oC . The fixative spun centrifuge , pelleted cell embed paraffin block use standard technique . Upper endoscopy biopsy : After Cytosponge remove , patient undergo standard care ( routine care ) upper endoscopy biopsy , clinically indicate . During exam , record endoscopic feature EoE , include ring , furrow , white plaque , decrease vascularity , stricture . The severity endoscopy finding measure use recently validate EREFS score system.23 Four esophageal biopsy take distal ( 5 cm gastro-esophageal junction ) proximal ( 15 cm gastro-esophageal junction ) esophagus . This number biopsies show maximize diagnostic sensitivity EoE.24 Histology eosinophil count : All tissue sample Cytosponge endoscopy cod subject 's ID number , otherwise masked clinical data , include EoE activity , symptom , patient characteristic , treatment prescribe . Using paraffin block , pathology slide cut tissue process routine H &amp; E staining . The slide digitize , use Aperio ImageScope ( Aperio Technologies , Vista , CA ) , maximum eosinophil density ( eosinophils/mm2 [ eos/mm2 ] ) determine use previously validate protocol.25 For purpose comparison previous study , eosinophil density convert eosinophil count ( eos/hpf ) assume hpf size 0.24 mm2 , size average field report literature.26 The study pathologists UNC Mayo Clinic review specimens site , study pathology Cambridge provide second review specimens ensure accurate quantification eosinophil count possible . Safety accessibility assessment : Patients assess multiple point determine safety Cytosponge EoE . We assess symptoms event soon sponge capsule swallow , well immediately expand sponge remove . We also contact 1 7 day endoscopy assess adverse event . For Aim 3 , administer acceptability survey 7 day follow-up point , patient adequate time reflect experience tissue collection approach . In particular survey record patient 's experience swallowing Cytosponge , whether would , whether prefer Cytosponge endoscopy diagnosis monitoring EoE .</detailed_description>
