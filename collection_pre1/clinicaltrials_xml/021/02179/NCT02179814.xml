	<brief_summary>Bulimia nervosa severe psychiatric disorder characterize recurrent binge eat episode follow inappropriate compensatory behavior prevent weight gain self-induced vomiting . With project , investigator want investigate role neurotransmitter dopamine bulimia nervosa . Dopamine report important influence neural reward system involve processing gain loss . The reward system functionally connect individual perception reward environment . A previous study reveal catecholamine depletion include dopamine depletion woman suffer bulimia nervosa past report mild bulimic symptom reward process become dysfunctional : ability use reward stimulus task solve diminish . The aim study investigate role reduce dopamine availability development maintain bulimia nervosa dysfunctional processing reward stimulus negative visual information . Therefore , investigator hypothesize catecholamine depletion achieve oral administration alpha-methyl-paratyrosine ( AMPT ) induce mild bulimic symptom female suffer bulimia nervosa past . In addition , reveal dysfunction reward emotional processing catecholamine depletion . Using functional magnetic resonance imaging , investigator propose reduce activation nucleus accumbens , neural structure reward system , neural correlate dysfunctional reward processing . Furthermore , amygdala , neural structure involve emotional processing , show high activation catecholamine depletion . Genetic factor additionally influence dopaminergic system . Therefore , investigator hypothesize genetic factor , example COMT val-158-met polymorphism may effect behavioral neural response catecholamine depletion . In sum , investigation may help understand change reward emotional processing may lead reoccurrence bulimic symptom . In future , finding study may help develop individual pharmacological psychotherapeutical intervention enhance outcome treatment .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Neural Response Catecholamine Depletion Subjects Suffering From Bulimia Nervosa Their Past Healthy Controls</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Background The Monoamine Deficiency Hypothesis one solid theory neurobiology mood , anxiety disorder , addiction . There increase evidence monoamine deficiency also play important role bulimia nervosa . Many indication reveal disturbance catecholamine system bulimia nervosa . In symptomatic bulimic patient , concentration norepinephrine dopamine cerebrospinal fluid peripheral blood lower healthy control . The neurotransmitter dopamine think importantly involved process reward stimulus . One instructive paradigm investigate relationship catecholaminergic function psychiatric disorder involve behavioral response catecholamine depletion achieve oral administration alpha-methyl-paratyrosine ( AMPT ) . This medication tyrosine hydroxylase inhibitor , therefore , reduces availability catecholamine brain deplete central norepinephrine dopamine store . A relatively large interindividual variation response catecholamine depletion consistently observe . Genetic factor may conceivably contribute variation . The COMT val-158-met polymorphism find play critical role activity enzyme catechol-O-methyltransferase ( COMT ) metabolize catecholamine release synaptic cleft . The enzyme activity individual homozygous val-158 allele 40 % high homozygotes met-158 allele . A high activity enzyme think associate high reduction catecholamine , particularly dopamine prefrontal cortex . In previous study Gregor Hasler colleague first use catecholamine depletion evaluate role play norepinephrine dopamine pathophysiology bulimia nervosa . The result study revealed catecholamine depletion remit bulimic participant show dysfunction motivate behavior reward task . In addition study provide preliminary evidence COMT val-158-met polymorphism explain variance behavioral response catecholamine depletion . However , eat disorder , pathway leading genetic polymorphism neural activity neuropsychological abnormality risk eat disorder remains determine . With new study investigator want investigate neural substrate induce bulimia-associated neuropsychological abnormality functional magnetic resonance imaging ( fMRI ) . An additional goal examine effect COMT val-158-met polymorphism neural activity . In follow investigator present central hypothesis : 1 . Remitted bulimic participant reveal impairment motivate behavior abnormal neural activation reward task follow catecholamine depletion . 2 . Remitted bulimic participant show increase amygdala activation encode negative picture catecholamine depletion . 3 . Participants homozygous val-158 allele COMT val-158-met polymorphism show increase activation ventral striatum reward task . 4 . Participants least one met-158 allele COMT val-158-met polymorphism show high amygdala activation encode negative emotional visual information . Objective This study elucidate etiology pathophysiology bulimia nervosa various level , range role specific genetic factor activity specific neural network neuropsychological abnormality clinical symptom . It may provide important insight specific pathogenetic pathway bulimia nervosa relate catecholaminergic particular dopaminergic neurotransmitter system . Since range drug target neurotransmitter system available , study may directly inform development novel therapeutic strategy tailor individual patient . Methods Remitted bulimic healthy control participant enrol double-blind , placebo-controlled cross-over catecholamine/sham depletion study . The initial assessment comprise physical examination , structure psychiatric interview , clinical rating neuropsychological testing . Catecholamine depletion induce administration AMPT 24 hour . Sham depletion include diphenhydramine first medication intake time point AMPT mostly induce mild sedation . Based previous report , investigator expect maximal depletion 30 hour first dose AMPT . Blood sample take time measure serum prolactin level proxy catecholamine synthesis . Behavioral experiment ( task assess reward emotional processing ) conduct MR-scanner . The participant complete various self-report rating first , medication intake .</detailed_description>
