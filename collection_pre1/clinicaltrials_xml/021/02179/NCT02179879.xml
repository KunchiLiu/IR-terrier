	<brief_summary>Procedural skill play important role anaesthetic expertise . More focused training assessment procedural skill need future train move apprenticeship base training system competency base assessment . Currently various technique exist assess procedural skill anaesthetist . For epidural catheter placement , task specific check list , global rating scale cumulative sum technique develop validate . These technique aim either well qualitative outcome sacrifice objectivity rely self-reporting . A decrease objectivity turn hamper inter-rater reliability essential component valid assessment model . Checklists type assessment force developer comprehensively characterize procedure interest validate complete procedure characterization . This approach quantitatively show high assessment reliability level compare Likert-scale assessment . The objective project develop validate comprehensive procedure characterization labor epidural catheter placement . Another objective compare new assessment tool exist checklist global rating scale labor epidural establish concurrent validity.5 A well-developed objective , validated procedure characterization serve master tool multiple application . It help build train programme procedure , allow provide metric base feedback trainee use simulator , help assess performance trainee future might use benchmark allow competency base progression training .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Development Validation Metrics Lumbar Labor Epidural Catheter Placement</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Study part 1 After ethic committee approval group expert ( n = 3 ) conventional lumbar epidural catheter placement select ( expert define one perform 500 labor epidural precede 5 year period ) . During number face-to-face meeting expert identify , characterize define procedure . They analyze task identify unit behavior measure constitute step-wise fashion procedure optimally perform deviation optimal procedure performance describe previously . After informed consent patient anaesthetist perform procedure , 2 video recording expert perform epidural 2 video recording novice ( define one do less 50 epidural ) perform epidural record detailed review metric development meeting . Study part 2 The developed metric subject assessment construct validity ( set procedure evaluate test instrument base degree test term identify quality , ability trait design measure ) concurrent validity ( evaluation relationship test score score another instrument purport measure construct relate ) . We also evaluate inter-rater reliability metric use ) proportion agreement raters , ii ) correlation strength ( use Pearson 's Correlation Coefficient ) iii ) Coefficient Alpha . After informed consent,10 expert ( part committee develop metric ) perform one lumbar epidural catheter placement labor 10 novice perform one lumbar epidural catheter placement labor video record . Two expert review video record score performance base checklist base system develop compare likert-scale checklists/global rating scale system .</detailed_description>
