	<brief_summary>Synthetic human growth hormone ( HGH ) available decade specific indication child adult . Past Randomized Control Trials ( RCT ) HGH ( off-label use ) improve ovarian function show combination traditional gonadotropin ovulation induction protocol , addition HGH effective increase pregnancy rate , increase egg production IVF woman document diminished ovarian reserve ( DOR ) . The investigator hypothesize initiate HGH least 6 week prior IVF start , investigator able increase production oocytes improve pregnancy chance . This hypothesis base prior observation effect growth hormone small antral follicle fact prior study utilized HGH principally ovulation induction . The investigator plan recruit 30 woman ( 15 group ) open label randomize control trial HGH augmentation ovarian response among woman document DOR poor prior response ovulation induction . Eligible participant woman &lt; 45 year document history prior retrieval 2 few oocyte maximal ovulation induction despite prior supplementation dehydroepiandrosterone ( DHEA ) . Women treat 1.9 mg ( 5.7 unit ) HGH per day , begin 6 week start treatment cycle . Cost treatment HGH cost participate patient . HGH cost patient approximately $ 800 per week treatment . Patients randomize non-HGH treat group , conceive , follow cycle offer HGH supplementation outside clinical trial . This subsequent cycle part study dataset patient also responsible cost HGH . Even 7 patient group , trial 99 % power ( error 0.05 % ) detect mean increase 4 oocyte treat group . The investigator plan recruit 15 patient group allow possible dropout .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Synthetic HGH develop 1985 approve FDA specific use child adult ( 1996 ; 2003 ) . In child , HGH injection approve treat short stature unknown cause well poor growth due number medical cause , include : - Turner 's syndrome , genetic disorder affect girl 's development . - Prader-Willi syndrome , uncommon genetic disorder cause poor muscle tone , low level sex hormone , constant feeling hunger . - Chronic kidney insufficiency . - HGH deficiency insufficiency . - Children born small gestational age . In adult , approve us HGH include : - Short bowel syndrome , condition nutrient properly absorb due severe intestinal disease surgical removal large portion small intestine . - HGH deficiency due rare pituitary tumor treatment . - Muscle-wasting disease associate HIV/AIDS . HGH supplementation potentially useful ovulation induction . Over last decade , recombinant HGH become commercially available , many study look effect HGH ovulation induction . Almost study administer HGH along routine fertility medication ovulation induction cycle . Most study use HGH dose 4 unit 12 Units . A study start GH day 21 previous cycle . A recent Cochrane review find , HGH improve result routine IVF cycle `` evidence increase pregnancy birth rate woman consider 'poor responder ' vitro fertilization . '' HGH report modulate action follicle stimulate hormone ( FSH ) follicles up-regulating local synthesis IGF-1 . A similar effect , interestingly , note Casson et al . ( Casson , Santoro et al . 1998 ; Casson , Lindsay et al . 2000 ) early experiment use DHEA treat patient increase IGF-1 . Much focus gonadotropin /IGF-1 interaction revolve around effect granulosa cell culture increase aromatase activity , estradiol production progesterone production Luteinizing Hormone ( LH ) receptor formation . However , Insulin-Like Growth Factor-1 ( IGF-1 ) also propose role stimulate early follicle development oocyte maturation ( Yoshimura , Ando et al . 1996 ; Yoshimura , Aoki et al . 1996 ) . Based observation , believe HGH past trial use maximal effect . Since HGH , like DHEA , appear affect small grow follicle , week month remove gonadotropin sensitivity , great potential HGH , hypothesis , would use , attempt affect small grow follicle . In analogy DHEA supplementation , would mean HGH supplementation would initiate least 6 week prior IVF cycle stimulation start . Theoretically , administration HGH 6 week start IVF cycle effect develop antral follicle present large good quality cohort follicle ovulation induction begin .</detailed_description>
