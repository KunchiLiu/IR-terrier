	<brief_summary>One fundamental goal anesthesia care optimize tissue perfusion oxygenation , especially critically ill patient . The standard monitor blood pressure , heart rate pulse oximetry directly reflect tissue information mislead sometimes . Coherent hemodynamics spectroscopy ( CHS ) base cerebral oximetry propose continuous non-invasive tool assess cerebral microvascular hemodynamics . The investigator propose study explore validity CHS via comparison transcranial Doppler measurement anesthetize surgical patient . The hypothesis : 1 ) CHS effectively measure cerebral microvascular hemodynamic change associate mechanical ventilation adjustment anesthesia . 2 ) CHS assess functional status cerebral autoregulation alter hypercapnia inhalational anesthetic agent .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>One essential goal take care anesthetized surgical patient maintain adequate tissue perfusion oxygenation . This especially true vital organ like brain . Unfortunately , neither cerebral oxygen consumption cerebral oxygen delivery directly monitor clinical set type information particular importance take care patient inflict critical neurologic condition . In addition , cerebral autoregulation - mechanism maintain constant cerebral blood flow face arterial blood pressure fluctuation , also routinely monitor . The recent establishment Coherent Hemodynamics Spectroscopy ( CHS ) promise offer need context . The uniqueness CHS add additional monitoring modality cerebral oximeter base near-infrared spectroscopy ( NIRS ) currently use clinical care . However , CHS base innovative algorithm quantifies microvascular cerebral blood flow oxygen consumption , separate arterial venous blood , assess functional status cerebral autoregulation conventional cerebral oximeter . The investigator establish collaboration Dr. Fantini Tufts University Dr. Tromberg Beckman Laser Institute lead scientist Biophotonics research development . Based clinical strength UCSF , investigator collaborative plan explore clinical application CHS patient without intracranial pathophysiologies . The study protocol submit review UCSF .</detailed_description>
	<criteria>Patients 18 year age older Relative healthy ( ASA III ) Scheduled elective intraabdominal surgery include colorectal , urological gynecological procedure general anesthesia placement endotracheal tube radial arterial catheter . Paralysis require surgery A total 30 patient recruit . These 30 patient randomly divide 2 group base technique anesthesia maintenance surgery . The anesthesia one group ( n=15 ) maintain use inhalational agent . The anesthesia group ( n=15 ) maintain use intravenous agent . Patients &lt; 18 year age ASA physical status â‰¥III Emergent urgent surgery Laparoscopic surgery History pulmonary disease include COPD Asthma Restrictive lung disease , etc . History cardiac disease include symptomatic coronary artery disease , heart failure , arrhythmia , moderate severe valvular abnormality , cardiomyopathy History neurological disease include carotid artery disease , stroke TIA , etc .</criteria>
