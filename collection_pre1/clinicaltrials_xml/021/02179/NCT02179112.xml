	<brief_title>Determining Universal Processes Related Best Outcome Emergency Gastrointestinal Surgery : International Evaluation</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Background : With 200 million surgical operation per year worldwide nearly every acute hospital provide surgical service , outcomes emergency general surgery represent internationally important healthcare marker . Best practice modifiable process relevant good patient outcome around world require validation use patient-level data . Aim : The primary aim study identify internationally relevant , modifiable surgical practice ( term modifiable equipment clinical management ) associate best care . These factor include use imaging , supplementary oxygen , pulse oximetry , critical care , safety checklist . Method : This multicentre , international , prospective cohort study . Any hospital world perform acute surgery eligible enter . Any patient undergoing emergency surgery incision enter peritoneal cavity eligible . Routine , anonymised clinical data consecutive patient collect two week period surgical centre , 30 day follow-up data collect . The primary outcome 24-hour post-operative mortality rate . Secondary outcome include 30-day inpatient post-operative mortality rate , 30-day serious complication rate . Participating centre also ask complete survey collect data hospital structural resource characteristic . Data enter stored securely via University Edinburgh 's REDCap system . This pragmatic protocol ( deliver across many low-resource setting ) allow independent verification data entry . Data collection norm lay protocol , data definition also clearly provide . Sample size relevant exploratory audit . Centres include least 95 % data completeness . Potential explanatory variable explore subsequent analysis include country Human Developmental Index , resource difference .</detailed_description>
	<criteria>Centre Any acute surgical unit worldwide eligible enter All participate centre require register detail , complete online training module , complete pilot audit prior commence . Centres must ensure include consecutive patient provide least 95 % data completeness . There minimum number patient per centre , long patient ( ) include consecutive . All sequential patient undergo emergency intraperitoneal surgery choose 2week period include . Emergency ( unplanned , nonelective , admission ) procedures . This include patient undergo emergency reoperation previous procedure inpatient stay . Laparoscopic , laparoscopic convert open case include . Any age patient ( adult paediatric ) include . Elective ( plan ) semielective ( patient initially admitted emergency , discharge hospital , readmitted later time surgery ) procedure . Caesarean section . These patient represent separate operative group , different priority treatment pathway . They study detail elsewhere , frequency would skew result study .</criteria>
