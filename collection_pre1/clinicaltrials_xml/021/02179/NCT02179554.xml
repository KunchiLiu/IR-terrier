	<detailed_description>Objectives : To investigate incidence anosmia arise patient undergo cardiopulmonary bypass , compare control group . Hypothesis : Patients undergo cardiopulmonary bypass may suffer anosmia . Methodology : Potential participant identify via scheduled operating list Manchester Royal Infirmary . Suitable patient inform , include informational leaflet study , permission seek informed consent form . Once recruit , patient come pre-operative assessment , olfactory assessment carry use Sniffing Sticks smell kit validate questionnaire ( Dresden Questionnaire Olfactory Disorders ) . The Sniffing Sticks smell kit composes 12 different pen-like odour dispenser . Each stick present patient chooses four different answer , one best represent odour . The patient receive score 0 12 . A reassessment via questionnaire smell kit repeat 1 week discharge ( whichever earlier ) patient 's surgery . Data Management Statistical Analyses : All participant information store electronically password protect trust computer . Participant identifier also keep separate password protect folder main database individual participant information . We use MS Excel compiling data . Study Type : Prospective , single-centre , observational study Target Sample size : 50 patient undergoing elective surgery require cardiopulmonary bypass ( study group ) 50 patient total Procedures Obtaining Documenting Consent : All patient undergo major surgery require attend preoperative planning clinic . Information leaflets disseminated time , include contact detail involve researcher . Depending availability , principal researcher would present preoperative clinic answer question . Contact detail take patient consider participate point whilst patient initially refuse choose participate later require contact researcher opt back . Potential participant contact via mode choice ( email/telephone ) ass want participate . On day plan admission hospital elective surgery , another agree upon time , write consent obtain question address immediately study conduct . Patients undergo major surgery normally admitted hospital day surgery . This time period opportunistic experience , patient ample free time till day surgery distraction would probably welcome . However , opportunity foreseen , separate appointment hospital ground make suitable time . After operation , repeat study do , ideally conjunction one follow visit hospital , normally involve wait time . Otherwise , alternate suitable appointment arrange . Any arranged appointment restrict work hour ( Mon-Fri 8am-5pm ) ENT outpatients department Manchester Royal Infirmary . Risks benefit : There risk patient participate study . There also direct benefit participant free objective measurement sense smell learn nature study . Patient participation purely voluntary . Confidentiality : Each participant identify assigned code number . This stored separate file main database , accessible password protect server . Thus , participant 's data keep anonymous . Informed consent form lock separate file cabinet .</detailed_description>
