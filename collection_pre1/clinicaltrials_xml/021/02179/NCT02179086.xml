	<brief_summary>This randomized phase II trial study well dose-escalated photon intensity-modulated radiation therapy ( IMRT ) proton beam radiation therapy work compare standard-dose radiation therapy give temozolomide patient newly diagnose glioblastoma . Radiation therapy use high-energy x-ray type radiation kill tumor cell shrink tumor . Specialized radiation therapy delivers high dose radiation directly tumor may kill tumor cell cause less damage normal tissue . Drugs , temozolomide , may make tumor cell sensitive radiation therapy . It yet know whether dose-escalated photon IMRT proton beam radiation therapy effective standard-dose radiation therapy temozolomide treat glioblastoma .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Dose-Escalated Photon IMRT Proton Beam Radiation Therapy Versus Standard-Dose Radiation Therapy Temozolomide Treating Patients With Newly Diagnosed Glioblastoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To determine dose-escalated -intensified photon IMRT proton beam therapy ( use dose-per-fraction escalation simultaneous integrate boost ) concomitant adjuvant temozolomide improve overall survival , compare standard-dose photon irradiation concomitant adjuvant temozolomide . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . To indirectly compare dose-escalated -intensified photon IMRT dose-escalated -intensified proton beam therapy term overall survival . II . To indirectly compare record toxicities dose-escalated -intensified photon IMRT versus dose-escalated -intensified proton beam therapy directly compare toxicity approach versus standard-dose photon irradiation backbone concomitant adjuvant temozolomide . III . To indirectly determine dose-escalated -intensified proton beam therapy concomitant adjuvant temozolomide improve perceive cognitive symptom severity , compare dose-escalated -intensified photon IMRT , directly compare symptom burden approach versus standard-dose photon irradiation backbone concomitant adjuvant temozolomide . IV . To indirectly determine dose-escalated -intensified proton beam therapy concomitant adjuvant temozolomide improve neurocognitive function , compare dose-escalated -intensified photon IMRT , directly compare neurocognitive function approach versus standard-dose photon irradiation backbone concomitant adjuvant temozolomide . TERTIARY OBJECTIVES : I. Tissue banking future translational science project determine base state science time primary endpoint report submitted National Cancer Institute ( NCI ) review approval . II . To prospectively compare cluster differentiation ( CD ) 4 lymphopenia dose-escalated intensified proton beam therapy , dose-escalated -intensified photon IMRT , standard-dose photon irradiation . III . To explore appropriate clinically relevant technological parameter ensure quality effectiveness throughout radiation therapy process , include imaging , simulation , patient immobilization , target critical structure definition , treatment planning , image guidance delivery . - To establish feasibility clinical relevancy quality assurance guideline . - To evaluate efficacy quality assurance tool . OUTLINE : Patients assign 1 2 group depend enrol institution . Within group , patient randomize 1:2 favor experimental arm . GROUP I ( PHOTON IMRT CENTERS ) : Patients randomize 1 2 treatment arm . ARM A1 : Patients undergo standard-dose photon irradiation use 3-dimensional conformal radiation therapy ( 3D-CRT ) IMRT daily ( QD ) , 5 day week 23 fraction plus boost 7 additional fraction . ARM B : Patients undergo dose-escalated -intensified photon IMRT QD , 5 day week total 30 fraction . GROUP II ( PROTON CENTERS ) : Patients randomize 1 2 treatment arm . ARM A2 : Patients undergo standard-dose photon irradiation use 3D-CRT IMRT Arm A1 . ARM C : Patients undergo dose-escalated -intensified proton beam radiation therapy QD , 5 day week total 30 fraction . In treatment arm , patient receive temozolomide orally ( PO ) QD day 1-49 radiation therapy . Beginning 4 week later , patient receive temozolomide PO QD day 1-5 . Treatment repeat every 28 day 12 course absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . After completion study treatment , patient follow every 3 month 1 year , every 4 month 1 year , every 6 month thereafter .</detailed_description>
