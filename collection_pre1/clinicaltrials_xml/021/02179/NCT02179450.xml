	<brief_summary>Based recent finding botulinum toxin injection cranial muscle might reduce emotional processing ( Havas 2011 ) , increase number popular newspaper tabloid suggest negative effect cognition . The underlying research article address `` facial feedback hypothesis '' . The hypothesis indicate expressive behaviour , include facial mimic expression influence subject 's brain via feedback . ( Alam 2008 ) Other systemic neurological disease , e.g inflammatory origin , may lead temporary bilateral facial nerve palsy ( BF ) . During recovery process , palsy usually remit completely . The effect bilateral facial muscle palsy cognition emotional possessing never evaluate . The result pilot study might provide new information effect bilateral facial palsy emotional processing cognition facial feedback hypothesis . The aim control pilot study assess cognitive function emotional processing patient bilateral facial palsy . In addition , difference cognitive function emotional processing patient different manifestation dystonia evaluate . According facial feedback theory , paralyse mimic muscle might alter emotional processing . Therefore , investigator compare patient bilateral facial muscle palsy healthy control . Investigators expect influence facial muscle palsy cognitive function test group ; investigator expect mild impairment emotional processing patient group bilateral facial muscle palsy ( BEB BF ) . In addition , investigator expect difference emotional processing patient different manifestation dystonia ( BEB CD ) remission . There might slight difference emotional processing patient different manifestation dystonia ( BEB CD ) time prominent facial palsy .</brief_summary>
