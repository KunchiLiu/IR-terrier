	<brief_title>Docetaxel Plus Bevacizumab Elderly Patients With Stage IV NSCLC</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>About 50 % newly diagnose case NSCLC concern patient older 65 year , 30-40 % case diagnose patient old 70 year . Furthermore , recent data suggest last decade , incidence mortality NSCLC decrease young patient , increase among old patient . Based observation , becomes clear NSCLC represent significant health problem elderly patient . However , elderly patient frequently underrepresented clinical trial evaluate new treatment NSCLC . Indeed , 75 % patient old 65 year metastatic NSCLC never receive kind chemotherapy daily clinical practice . According retrospective data , addition bevacizumab standard , platinum-based chemotherapy regimen improve overall survival patient advance non-squamous-cell , non-small-cell lung cancer good ECOG performance status . In addition , bevacizumab prolongs progression-free survival improves response rate . In elderly patient complete lack prospective data regard role bevacizumab . It clear whether elderly patient gain survival benefit addition bevacizumab standard chemotherapeutic regimen result significant increase toxicity . There clear need prospectively evaluate tolerability bevacizumab add standard first-line chemotherapy elderly NSCLC patient . Therefore , investigator propose study efficacy elderly ( &gt; 70 year ) patient treat cytotoxic chemotherapy combination bevacizumab context 1st line treatment .</detailed_description>
