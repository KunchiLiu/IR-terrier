	<brief_summary>Most new mother United States start breastfeed . For mother , despite follow best practice , able meet breastfeeding goal due unexplained low milk supply . At time , nearly 1 4 new mother pre-diabetic ( elevated blood sugar , yet diabetic ) . My progression research suggest metabolic factor cause pre-diabetes may also cause low milk supply . Metformin widely prescribe drug treat high blood sugar . This study preliminary , small scale randomize trial design test trend hypothesis metformin safe potentially effective treat low milk supply insulin resistant pre-diabetic mother .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Metformin Augment Low Milk Supply ( MALMS ) Study</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Through progression research , PI develop central hypothesis wan insulin secretion context insulin resistance important cause low milk supply . The specific aim research describe protocol enact small-scale randomize placebo-controlled trial ( RCT ) inform future large double-masked RCT adjuvant metformin treatment versus placebo early postpartum low milk supply woman evidence insulin resistance base presence least one following : elevated fasting glucose ( FPG , define &gt; 95 g/dL ) , history polycystic ovary syndrome , history gestational diabetes , current abdominal obesity . The pilot study design demonstrate feasibility , obtain variance estimate , test trend follow primary hypothesis : 1 ) Among eligible woman low milk supply , randomly assign 4 week metformin treatment experience great increase milk output compare placebo group . The RCT precede '' process test phase '' recruitment data collection logistics confirm enact study protocol , except without drug assignment . Upon completion process test phase , protocol amend accord insight gain . Once revise protocol receive IRB approval , RCT phase begin . During phase , mother meet Stage 1 eligibility criterion undergo baseline measurement cardio-metabolic health breast milk output . Among mother meet stage 2 eligibility criterion , include FPG &gt; 95 g/dL , N=30 randomly assign metformin placebo use 2:1 allocation , replacement non-completers . All low milk supply participant receive standard guidance increase milk supply breast pumping . We test follow secondary hypothesis : 2 ) Mammary epithelial cell transcriptomes within metformin group , placebo , exhibit significantly great modulation insulin-stimulated gene baseline post treatment . Milk fat globule rich source mammary epithelial cell mRNA . We isolate milk fat RNA baseline post treatment randomly select subset RNA-sequencing . 3 ) Fasting plasma glucose &gt; 95 g/dL correctly identify low milk supply case &gt; 75 % sensitivity ; &lt; 95 g/dL correctly identify abundant milk supply ( comparator group ) &gt; 90 % specificity . Fasting plasma glucose ( FPG ) woman abundant milk supply derive 30 consecutively consent breastfeed medicine patient meet RCT eligibility criterion except low milk supply ( i.e. , diagnosis related infant feed breast poor latch , abundant milk output ) . We combine available baseline FPG data determine sensitivity specificity FPG &gt; 95 g/dL biomarker low milk supply cause maternal metabolic impairment . 4 ) Metformin treatment safe adequately tolerate lactate mother breastfeed infant .</detailed_description>
