	<brief_summary>The identification abnormal narrow blood vessel non-invasive coronary angiography remain exciting goal . While Computed Tomography ( CT ) establish clear role patient retain limitation . Primarily , alteration blood flow lead restriction blood supply tissue accurately predict anatomical assessment abnormal narrow blood vessel - limitation invasive , compute tomographic , angiography . This important , raft evidence demonstrate revascularisation consider presence restriction blood supply tissue . The gold standard method identify restriction blood supply tissue measurement fractional flow reserve ( FFR ) , dimensionless value generate ratio circulatory pressure narrow blood vessel . At present , patient indeterminately significant abnormal narrow blood vessel identify use CT must go test restriction blood supply tissue , prior decision revascularisation make . As part governance commitment maintain reporting standard , undertake ongoing audit cardiac CT practice . The investigator recently identify group patient undergone FFR measurement part routine clinical care , compare clinical report , ensure appropriate recommendation make . It appear ability predict important abnormal narrow blood vessel reasonable ( ~70 % ) hence propose formulation research question explore . The primary objective study determine accuracy visual assessment likely significance blood flow narrow blood vessel identify cardiac CT , comparison invasive , fractional flow reserve . The secondary objective evaluate feature abnormal narrow blood vessel likely significant impact blood flow . The investigator ' work hypothesis cardiac CT FFR useful predictor abnormal narrow blood vessel .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>This retrospective study diagnostic accuracy . We intend undertake intervention require patient involvement stage research . The study would utilise anonymised patient data , identify part previous audit . FFR value already know patient . The image dataset would retrieve matched FFR . At stage data , include image , would anonymised . The image would review independently two expert reader would record impression likely haemodynamic significance particular stenosis . Two week later , minimise bias , reader would re-review image identify feature stenoses know , likely , cause haemodynamic significance , include stenosis length , territory vessel , calcification . The result would directly compare FFR reading feature would subject multivariate analysis identify salient anatomical feature may predict haemodynamic significance .</detailed_description>
