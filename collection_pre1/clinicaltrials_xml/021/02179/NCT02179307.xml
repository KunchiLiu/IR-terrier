	<brief_summary>The literature clear training volume employ initial phase resistance training program ensure optimal muscular adaptation . The purpose study therefore compare effect strength training low versus moderate volume muscular function hypertrophy previously untrained , healthy individual . Furthermore , investigator relate individual variation response proxy marker individual training state , baseline muscular function muscle fiber type . The study include 25 woman 25 men consist 12-week resistance training protocol . Each study participant act control , perform low- ( 1-set ) moderate-volume ( 3-sets ) protocol , allocate either dominant non-dominant leg , stratify randomized fashion . Primary outcome measure thigh muscle cross section area unilateral knee extension strength . Additionally , muscle fiber type composition evaluate well additional parameter muscular function . The primary hypothesis low-volume protocol beneficial individual glycolytic muscle phenotype , whereas opposite true individual aerobic phenotype .</brief_summary>
