	<brief_summary>Rationale : The PneumRx RePneu Lung Volume Reduction Coil ( RePneu LVR-coil ) bronchoscopic lung volume reduction treatment design compress area lung parenchyma damage emphysema . The LVRC treatment find feasible , safe effective previous study . However , patient-based outcome besides quality life questionnaire hardly measure intervention treatment COPD . Furthermore , exact underlying physiological mechanism LVR-coil treatment unknown . Another aspect treatment date fully understand group patient benefit treatment group patient , know responder rate already 60 % . Objective : The objective study gain knowledge 1 ) effect LVRC treatment patient-based outcome like physical activity , 2 ) underlie physiological mechanism treatment , 3 ) predictor response treatment baseline , 4 ) targetted treatment number coil place per lung use lung compliance . Study design : This study non-randomised open label multi-center intervention study . Study population : The study population exist adult patient severe emphysema treatment option leave besides surgical procedure . Intervention : Bilateral bronchoscopic lung volume reduction treatment RePneu coil . Main study parameters/endpoints : The main study endpoint change physical activity baseline 3 month follow-up second treatment . The secondary endpoint change baseline 3 month follow-up second treatment : patient report outcomes treatment , dynamic lung hyperinflation , static lung volume , lung compliance , diaphragm function , lung perfusion , systemic inflammation small airway function . Nature extent burden risk associate participation , benefit group relatedness : The LVR Coil design safe possible . It show risk associate LVRC system largely attributable bronchoscopic procedure rather device per se . Therefore , appear LVRC device appreciably increase risk serious adverse event beyond risk undergo bronchoscopy procedure simply emphysema . Currently , treatment commercially available Netherlands study participant visit hospital multiple time . Previous study show treatment beneficial effect patient , however patient respond . Part new study try identify group patient respond treatment patient . Therefore , possible patient receive benefit treatment .</brief_summary>
