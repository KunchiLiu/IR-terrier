	<detailed_description>There significant morbidity associate patient SCD , also cost associated numerous hospitalization . Small study unable show clear benefit use low dose anticoagulation SCD due limit sample size inclusion specific population . However , study show decrease level elevate prothrombotic marker anticoagulation , one study use full dose anticoagulation patient generally milder form SCD ( high protective hemoglobin ) show rapid decrease clinical pain use anticoagulation , suggest possible benefit therapy . Due paucity data support therapeutic dose LMWH severe form SCD see United States , choose prophylactic dose anticoagulation . This study proposal attempt critically avoid admission reduce daily pain score pain crisis outpatient use novel oral anticoagulant . The development novel anticoagulant oral direct factor Xa ( FXa ) inhibitor allow realistic use daily prophylactic dosing outpatient . Past study detail earlier limited attempt use subcutaneous injection frequent , close monitoring acenocoumarol treatment , ideal chronic daily use . Furthermore , use global assay calibrate automated thrombography ( CAT ) show detail thrombin generation population hypercoagulable baseline . This double blind , parallel group , placebo control feasibility study enrollment target 60 patient ( 30 per arm ) . All subject meet inclusion criterion outpatient , follow 1 month observation , randomize receive oral prophylactic dose factor Xa inhibitor ( Apixaban 2.5mg po bid ) placebo 6 month . Subjects return 30 day ( +/- 5 day ) follow-up visit End Treatment ( EOT ) visit . Initial randomization occur computerized randomization technique investigational drug service ( IDS ) Duke University Medical Center .</detailed_description>
