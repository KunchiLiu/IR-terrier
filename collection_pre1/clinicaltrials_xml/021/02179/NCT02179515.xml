Eligibility : - Adults age 18 whose type cancer respond standard therapy history autoimmune diseases capable take care . Design : - Participants screen medical history physical exam . They blood urine test . They may compute tomography ( CT ) scan , positron emission tomography ( PET ) scan , brain magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) scan . They may bone scan . They electrocardiogram ( ECG ) test heart rhythm . - Participants visit every 4 week . They physical exam blood urine test . They inject vaccine skin upper thigh around armpit . - CT scan MRI scan do visit 1 , 3 month study , 3 month later still study . Another ECG do last vaccine visit . - When participant stop vaccine , return visit recover side effect . They test include physical exam , blood test , scan , x-ray . - Participants ask enroll another study long-term follow-up .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Safety Tolerability Modified Vaccinia Ankara ( MVA ) -Based Vaccine Modified Express Brachyury T-cell Costimulatory Molecules ( MVA-Brachyury-TRICOM )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Background : - MVA-brachyury-TRICOM novel recombinant vector-based therapeutic cancer vaccine design induce enhance immune response brachyury , overexpressed many solid tumor type , lung , breast , ovarian , chordoma , prostate , colorectal , pancreatic adenocarcinoma . - Modified vaccinia Ankara ( MVA ) replication-deficient , attenuate derivative vaccinia . It use smallpox vaccination develop recombinant viral vector produce vaccine infectious disease cancer . - Many MVA vector-based trial conduct patient cancer demonstrate safety immunogenicity transgene . - Brachyury member T-box family transcription factor . It overexpressed cancer cell compare normal tissue link cancer cell resistance metastatic potential . - Brachyury vaccine target demonstrate safe ongoing phase I study recombinant yeast-brachyury generate brachyury-specific T-cell response . - Poxviral vaccine deliver triad three human T-cell costimulatory molecule designate TRICOM ( B7.1 , ICAM-1 LFA-3 ) extensively studied preclinical clinical study demonstrate ability induce robust T-cell activation provide evidence clinical benefit . - In vitro , MVA-brachyury-TRICOM able effectively expand brachyury-specific CD8+ CD4+ T cell peripheral blood mononuclear cell . - Previous work indicate MVA-brachyury-TRICOM induce activation distinct Tcell subpopulation see yeast-brachyury vaccine already development . Objectives : To determine safety tolerability escalate dos MVA-brachyury-TRICOM vaccine . Eligibility : - Patients must histologically confirm malignancy metastatic unresectable locally advanced malignant solid tumor . In case chordoma , unresectable , locally recurrent , metastatic tumor acceptable enrollment , give represent incurable disease . As much possible , patient enrol tumor type know increased expression brachyury ( lung , breast , ovarian , prostate , colorectal , pancreatic , chordoma ) . - Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group ( ECOG ) performance status 0 1 study entry - Age great equal 18 year . - Prior Therapy : Completed , disease progression least one prior line disease appropriate therapy metastatic disease , candidate therapy proven efficacy disease . Design : - This open-label , phase I trial sequential cohort patient ( 3-6 patient per dose cohort ) dose escalation MVA-brachyury-TRICOM vaccine . - Three cohort receive MVA-brachyury-TRICOM vaccine administer subcutaneously either 1 , 2 , 4 injection study drug ( 1 injection equal 2 x 10^8 infectious unit monthly ( 28 day +/- 4 day ) intervals 3 month ( treatment ) . - Expansion cohort 10 patient may enrol two high tolerate dose level . These cohort allow certain standard , relatively non-toxic therapy continue patient receive vaccine . - Up 18 patient may require enrol 3 cohort , plus additional 10 MTD dose level . Thus , 38 patient may theoretically require complete trial . If 3 patient per month accrue , study expect require 1 year complete necessary enrollment .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>INCLUSION CRITERIA : ( All Subjects ) 1 . Patients must metastatic unresectable locally advanced malignant solid tumor , histologically confirm Laboratory Pathology , NCI . In case chordoma , unresectable , locally recurrent , metastatic tumor acceptable enrollment , give represent incurable disease . Efforts make , much possible , enroll patient tumor type know increased expression brachyury ( lung , breast , ovarian , prostate , colorectal , pancreatic , chordoma ; tumor may include data level brachyury tumor become available ) . 2 . Patients may measurable nonmeasurable evaluable disease . Patients surgically resect metastatic disease high risk relapse also eligible . 3 . Prior therapy : Patients must complete disease progression least one prior line diseaseappropriate therapy metastatic disease , candidate therapy proven efficacy disease . 4 . There minimum 4 week prior chemotherapy , immunotherapy and/or radiation , exception hormonal therapy prostate breast cancer , HER2directed therapy HER2+ breast cancer ( 3+ IHC FISH+ ) , erlotinib EGFRmutated lung cancer expansion cohort detailed section . There minimum 6 week prior antibody therapy , ( ipilimumab antiPD1/PDL1 ) due prolong halflife . 5 . Patients must recover ( grade 1 baseline ) clinically significant toxicity associate prior therapy . Typically , 3 4 week patient recently receive cytotoxic therapy , except nitrosoureas mitomycin C , 6 week need recovery . 6 . Age great equal 18 year . Because dose adverse event data currently available use MVAbrachyuryTRICOM vaccine patient &lt; 18 year age , child exclude study eligible future pediatric trial . 7 . ECOG performance status less equal 1 ( Karnofsky great equal 70 % ) . 8 . Patients must normal organ marrow function define : Serum creatinine less equal 1.5 x upper limit normal OR creatinine clearance 24h urine collection great equal 50 mL/min . ALT AST less equal 3 x upper limit normal . Total bilirubin less equal 1.5 x upper limit normal OR patient Gilbert syndrome , total bilirubin less equal 3.0 . Hematological eligibility parameter ( within 16 day start therapy ) : Granulocyte count great equal 1,500/mm^3 Platelet count great equal 100,000/mm^3 9 . Patients must baseline pulse oximetry &gt; 90 % room air . 10 . The effect MVAbrachyuryTRICOM develop human fetus unknown .
