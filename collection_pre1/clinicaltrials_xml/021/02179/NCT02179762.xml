	<brief_summary>This randomize pilot clinical trial compare vigorous moderate exercise enhance active surveillance patient prostate cancer spread nearby lymph node part body . Active surveillance involve watch patient 's condition give treatment unless test result show patient 's condition get bad . Exercise may improve fitness , quality life , brain health , blood biomarkers patient prostate cancer active surveillance . It yet know whether vigorous moderate exercise work well enhance active surveillance patient localized prostate cancer .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Vigorous Moderate Exercise Enhancing Active Surveillance Patients With Localized Prostate Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To determine feasibility perform vigorous intensity aerobic exercise use progressive , high-intensity interval training ( HIIT ) standard stationary cycling 'cybercycling ' compare moderate intensity aerobic exercise standard stationary cycling prostate cancer ( PCa ) survivor active surveillance ( AS ) . II . To explore potential effect vigorous intensity aerobic exercise ( HIIT ) use standard cycle 'cybercycling ' compare moderate intensity standard cycling change quality life ( QoL ) , cognition , fitness circulate inflammatory biomarkers PCa-specific marker progression ( prostate specific antigen [ PSA ] , time AT ) PCa survivor active surveillance ( AS ) ; , explore effect may mediate change body fat . OUTLINE : Patients randomize 1 3 arm . ARM I : Patients perform moderate intensity exercise stationary bike 20-50 minute , three day week 16 week . ARM II : Patients perform HIIT exercise standard stationary bike , three day week 16 week . ARM III : Patients perform HIIT exercise cybercycle use race game , three day week 16 week . After completion study , patient follow 6 12 month .</detailed_description>
