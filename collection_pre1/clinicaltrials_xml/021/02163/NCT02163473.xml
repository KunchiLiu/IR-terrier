	<brief_summary>The purpose research study determine chemical marker blood , hypoxia-inducible factor ( HIF-1 alpha ) , use predict subject 's hospital outcome subject diagnose sepsis . Sepsis define either presence pathogenic organism toxin blood tissue . Sepsis one significant challenge critical care medicine . The investigator propose hypoxia-induced expression HIF-1 alpha correlate clinical feature Sepsis future , HIF-1 alpha may use biomarker Sepsis .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Hypoxia Inducible Factor 1 Alpha Novel Biomarker Septic Shock</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Sepsis one significant challenge critical care . Septic shock ( SS ) severe form sepsis associate high mortality , significant financial expense longer lengths stay . Pathophysiological mechanism SS include 3 key component : 1 ) bacterial overgrowth , 2 ) spill bacterial product blood cause hemodynamic insufficiency , 3 ) lead tissue hypoxia ( TH ) . To date biomarkers sepsis/SS limited hemodynamic parameter . However , aggressive fluid resuscitation fully prevent development tissue hypoxia ( TH ) . To date investigator limit appreciate TH measurement lactic acid ( LA ) , neither early accurate marker . Unfortunately , LA limit predictive value SS due complex metabolism . Thus , acute need biomarkers would aid diagnosis prognosis sepsis/septic shock . Cellular responses/adaptations hypoxia rely transcription hypoxia-inducible factor HIF , heterodimeric protein compose constitutively express subunit inducible ( type 1 , 2 , 3 ) subunit . More recently HIF identify diverse tissue include blood ; also show HIF expression blood cell representative systemic tissue hypoxic condition .</detailed_description>
