To end , thirty medically healthy male diagnose PTSD continue report emotional numbing symptom prolong exposure therapy receive 8 week train CBCT . Prior , training , investigator assess patient ' level oxytocin , inflammation , self-reported emotional numb social connectedness .

	<detailed_description>Thirty otherwise medically healthy male age 25 55 previously meet criterion PTSD undergone prolong exposure therapy ( PET ) yet continue report emotional numbing symptom chief complaint assess baseline level plasma oxytocin ( OT ) , marker pro-inflammatory cytokine , total mRNA expression peripheral blood mononuclear cell ( PBMCs ) , self-reported emotional numb social connectedness , empathy . Real-world social connectedness assess use Electronically Activated Recorder ( EAR ) two day , randomly record 50 second snippet audio every 9 minute allow quantification time spend others . Measures empathy include empathic accuracy dynamic empathic accuracy ( EA ) video task , ask participant rate story-tellers feel tell positively negatively valenced autobiographical story . Because previous study show PTSD may interfere subtle social processing skill one primary aim proposal uncover specific biomarkers related self-reported emotional numbing , investigator also assess eye gaze arousal covariance ( correlation skin conductance video subject study participant ) EA task . Following baseline assessment , participant participate 8 week CBCT , entail twice-weekly meeting consist didactic information session approximately 20 minute CBCT practice . Participants ask practice home 20 minute per day , give audio compact disc guide at-home meditation . Upon completion CBCT ( Time 2 ) , 8-12 week ( Time 3 ) , Time 1 assessment repeat .</detailed_description>
