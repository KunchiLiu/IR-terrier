	<brief_summary>This pilot clinical trial study magnetic resonance ( MRI ) -guided focal stereotactic radiosurgery ( SRS ) treat patient low- intermediate-risk localized prostate cancer . Stereotactic radiosurgery may able send x-ray directly tumor cause less damage normal tissue .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Magnetic Resonance Guided Focal Stereotactic Radiosurgery Treating Patients With Low- Intermediate-Risk Localized Prostate Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . Evaluate correlation histopathology finding comparison region prostate report suspicious harbor tumor burden multiparametric MRI report/s . II . Demonstration dosimetric radiobiological advantage focal stereotactic body radiation therapy ( SBRT ) . III . Evaluation clinical outcome focal SBRT localize prostate cancer . OUTLINE : Patients undergo 3 fraction MRI-guided focal SRS every day 1 week . Patients undergo additional MRI scan 2nd 3rd fractionated treatment , 6 month follow end radiation therapy , 12 24 month . After completion study treatment , patient follow every 3 month 24 month .</detailed_description>
