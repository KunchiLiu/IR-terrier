Must , opinion investigator , willing able complete aspect study , adhere study visit schedule comply assessment . 10 . Females reach menarche must negative pregnancy test Screening undergo additional pregnancy test study . If sexually active , male female subject must willing use acceptable method contraception duration study . Criteria determine base overnight fasting ( min . 4 hour ) value collect Screening Visit 2 Exclusion 1 . Use pharmacologic vitamin D metabolite analog ( e.g . calcitriol , doxercalciferol , alfacalcidiol , paricalcitol ) within 14 day prior Screening Visit 2 ; washout take place Screening Period 2 . Use oral phosphate within 7 day prior Screening Visit 2 ; washout take place Screening Period 3 . Use calcimimetics , aluminum hydroxide antacid ( e.g . Maalox® Mylanta® ) , systemic corticosteroid , thiazide within 7 day prior Screening Visit 1 4 . Use growth hormone therapy within 3 month Screening Visit 1 5 . Use bisphosphonates 6 month 2 year prior Screening Visit 1 6 . Presence nephrocalcinosis renal ultrasound grade ≥ 3 base follow scale : 0 = Normal 1 = Faint hyperechogenic rim around medullary pyramid 2 = More intense echogenic rim echo faintly fill entire pyramid 3 = Uniformly intense echo throughout pyramid 4 = Stone formation : solitary focus echo tip pyramid 7 . Planned recommend orthopedic surgery , include staple , 8plates osteotomy , within clinical trial period 8 . Hypocalcemia hypercalcemia , define serum calcium level outside ageadjusted normal limit * 9 . Evidence tertiary hyperparathyroidism determine Investigator 10 . Use medication suppress PTH ( e.g . Sensipar® , cinacalcet alcimimetics ) within 2 month prior Screening Visit 1 11 . Presence history condition , view investigator , place subject high risk poor treatment compliance complete study 12 . Presence concurrent disease condition would interfere study participation affect safety 13 .
