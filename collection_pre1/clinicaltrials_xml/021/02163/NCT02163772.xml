	<brief_summary>Backgrounds : Unilateral vocal cord paralysis cause recurrent laryngeal nerve ( RLN ) injury unusual disease may deteriorate patients'voice swallow outcome . Although long term treatment effect encourage , point perform surgical treatment conclusive . Previous report suggest late treatment principle patient may spontaneous reinnervation degree within 4-5 month injury . The vocal cord position tone may change reinnervation . Others delineate laryngeal synkinesis misdirect reinnervation common suggest early temporary injection laryngoplasty . They imply early injection laryngoplasty may improve patients'not short term voice outcome also decrease incidence transcervical laryngeal framework surgery determine surgery . However , lack prospective study objective data make treatment-time policy still controversial . Purposes : 1 . To find incidence spontaneous reinnervation synkinetic regeneration . 2 . To detect relationship change glottal gap laryngeal synkinesis . 3 . To detect impaction early intracordal hyaluronic acid injection vocal cord position change patient laryngeal synkinesis . Study design : Forty patient plan enrol study . Twenty undergo hyaluronate intracordal injection three-six month RLN damage . The 20 patient follow watch-and wait policy . Laryngoscope , laryngeal EMG ( electromyography ) , voice analysis voice outcome survey do 3-6 month 12-month RLN injury . At end follow , glottal gap , voice laboratory data quality life compare . The outcome also correlate laryngeal electromyography ( LEMG ) data impact synkinetic reinnervation .</brief_summary>
