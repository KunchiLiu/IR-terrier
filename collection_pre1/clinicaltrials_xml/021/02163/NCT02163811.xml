The Promoting Amputee Life Skills ( PALS ) project , conduct member current study team , design implemented 8-week group-based intervention improve self-management follow limb loss . The current proposal build upon previous research demonstrate efficacy PALS self-management intervention , address important next question : 1 . Is PALS self-management intervention appropriate Veterans , specifically consider high prevalence diabetes vascular disease ? 2 . Can house deliver within health care system oppose exist community support group ? 3 . Will intervention effective individual new amputee ? 4 . Will shorter format also incorporate option video teleconferencing retain efficacy original PALS intervention ? This study two-arm randomize control trial ( RCT ) determine efficacy VETPALS . Study staff screen enroll Veterans recent low extremity limb loss within last 6 month . Each participant complete baseline interview sequentially place cohort 6-10 participant ; cohort randomized VETPALS group base self-management program ( intervention ) individual education support program ( control ) . Once participant complete randomized arm follow-up assessment , free participate group . This ensure participant offer program deprive potentially valuable healthcare service .</detailed_description>
