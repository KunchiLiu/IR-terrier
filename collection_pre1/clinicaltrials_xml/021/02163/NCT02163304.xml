	<brief_summary>The primary purpose study quantify activation region brain associate taste , appetite , reward view high sugar high fat ( HS/HF ) image compare control image follow ingestion ( 1 ) artificially sweeten solution , ( 2 ) sucrose solution , ( 3 ) tasteless control solution normal weight vs. obese woman . This repeat measure study design ; hence , data collect three day correspond three solution . Body mass index ( BMI ) subject measure . 1 . After consume artificially sweeten solution sucrose solution compare tasteless solution , view HS/HF food image vs. control image result high activation taste pathway ( frontal operulum anterior insula ( FO/AI ) ) brain . 2 . After consumption sucrose solution compare artificially sweeten solution tasteless solution , view HS/HF food image vs. control image result high activation region brain associate appetite ( hypothalamus ) . 3 . After consumption sucrose solution compare artificially sweeten solution tasteless solution , view HS/HF food image vs. control image result high activation region brain associate reward [ amygdala , anterior cingulate cortex ( ACC ) , Orbitalfrontal Cortex ( OFC ) , ventral tegmental area ( VTA ) , striatum , insula ] obese normal weight woman . After consume artificially sweeten solution compare tasteless solution , view HS/HF image vs. control image result difference activation reward pathways brain .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>In pilot study , use functional magnetic resonance imaging ( fMRI ) determine effect high calorie visual food cue [ i.e . image foods high sugar fat ( HS/HF ) , ice cream ] activation taste , appetite , reward pathway brain follow separate ingestion ( 1 ) artificial sweeten solution ( 2 ) sucrose solution ( 3 ) tasteless solution obese individual . Obesity rate high among US adult 33.8 % adult BMI 30 great ( 1 ) . The prevailing belief homeostatic system place monitor energy homeostasis . Sugar sweeten beverage appear alter homeostatic system ( 1 ) metabolic feedback signal function correctly intend ( 2 ) , little dietary compensation see energy beverage ( 3 ) , ( 2 ) sweet savory food ( sugar sweeten beverage ) override system ( i.e . hedonics ) ( 2 ) . Epidemiological data suggest Americans consume 20-25 % energy beverage form equate ~430-535 kcal/day ( 3 , 4 ) . In study , sugar sweeten beverage intake show increase weight ( 5 , 6 ) . While limited data available , meta-analysis human demonstrate inclusion aspartame compare sugar reduces energy intake ( 7 ) . A prospective study find weight loss maintainer utilize artificial sweetener normal weight individual ( 8 ) . This suggest artificial sweetener may method promote weight loss obese individual . Public policy sugar sweeten beverage start reexamine , however , currently unknown effect sugar sweeten beverage intake artificial sweeten solution ( 1 ) taste , appetite , reward region brain ( 2 ) food craving relate brain activation , among obese vs. normal weight individual . The aim study provide important data obese individual continue consume sugar-sweetened beverage despite associate negative health outcome . We hypothesize consumption due sugar sweeten beverage , artificial sweetener , activate reward pathway brain ( hedonics ) . Sucrose artificial sweetners Previously find alter hypothalamic response glucose ingestion obese human ( 9 ) . In obese human , brain activation seem impaired ; i.e. , low delay compare lean subject . This study lack functional contrast high noise less accuracy current fMRI blood-oxygen-level-dependent ( BOLD ) technology hypothalamus analyze ( 9 ) . The current study future study pilot feasibility work determine dietary sugar response differentially regulate obese individual possibility contribute consumption sugar sweeten beverage obese adult . Frank et al . conclude taste pathway activate sucralose sucrose taste young normal weight woman ( 10 ) . Only sucrose recruit reward pathways appetite pathway document due either lack significance examination ( 10 ) . This study confirm beverage ingestion oppose taste evokes similar reward response also examine appetite reward pathway obese individual . The effect caloric vs. non caloric sweetener taste activation previously examine normal weight men ( 11 ) . During non-caloric solution tasting , 2 caloric tastants also consume . These caloric tastants could invoke differential cephalic phase response alter result ( 12 ) . Consumption artificial sweetener caloric solution increase activation insula , middle OFC , lateral OFC amygdala . With artificial sweetener , great activation OFC ( 11 ) . Next , effect sweet taste ( 2.4 mL ) young male female diet soda drinker examine ( 13 ) . Water utilized rinse baseline comparison diet regular soda . In person , high right orbitalfrontal cortex brain activation response non-caloric compare caloric solution observe ( 13 ) . These previous study utilize normal weight participant taste examine effect artificial sweetener brain response . The current study examines obese individual solution ingestion observe difference brain activation . Overall differential brain response caloric vs. non-caloric sweetener normal weight individual thus previously author suggest research need perform effectiveness artificial sweetener decrease energy intake . Obesity Women show food picture cue high energy food . The high energy food produce significantly great activation brain reward region obese compare normal weight control woman ( 14 ) . Differences group include ACC , VTA , nucleus accumbens ( NAc ) , amygdala , ventral pallidum ( Vent Pall ) , Caudate , Putamen ( 14 ) . Postmeal , obese individual , normal weight individual , increase activation putamen ( part striatum ) amygdala suggest region may play role overeat ( 15 ) region incorporate current study hypothesis . These cross-sectional study important previously Murdaugh et . al ( 16 ) find obese individual successful short term weight loss long term weight loss maintenance great activation reward pathway brain region . While speculative , artificial sweetener may reduce craving activate reward pathway especially obese person . This grant help provide pilot data elucidate important question .</detailed_description>
