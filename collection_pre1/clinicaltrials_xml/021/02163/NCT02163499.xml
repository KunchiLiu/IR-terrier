	<detailed_description>Subjects 2 consecutive STAT potassium value 5.1 mmol/L enter Acute Phase receive ZS 10 g tid 24 72 hour , depend potassium value . Once normokalemia ( STAT potassium 3.5 5.0 mmol/L , inclusive ) restore ( whether 24 , 48 72 hour ) , subject enrolled Maintenance Phase dose ZS start dose 5 g qd . Potassium ( STAT central laboratory ) measure weekly throughout first month study every 4 week thereafter Month 12 . During Maintenance Phase , ZS dose may increase decreased increments/decrements 5 g qd maximum 15 g qd minimum 5 g every day base STAT potassium measurement outline : • &gt; 5.0 mmol/L receive 5 g qd 5 g every day &gt; 5.5 mmol/L receive 10 g qd : increase ZS dose 5 g qd increment maximum dose 15 g qd .• Between 3.0 3.4 mmol/L , inclusive : decrease ZS dose 5 g qd decrement minimum dose 5 g every day ; subject 's STAT potassium value remain 3.0 3.4 mmol/L , inclusive , ZS 5 g every day dose , subject withdrawn study receive standard care treatment . There limit number dose titration allow . Subjects receive 12 month treatment open-label ZS .</detailed_description>
