	<brief_summary>This 2-part study patient epidermal growth factor receptor mutation positive ( EGFRm+ ) non-small cell lung cancer ( NSCLC ) whose disease progress treatment epidermal growth factor receptor ( EGFR ) -tyrosine kinase inhibitor ( TKI ) : Part A determine effect food pharmacokinetics ( PK ) AZD9291 ; Part B allow patient access AZD9291 provide additional safety data collection . Part A randomised , open-label , 2 treatment period crossover study patient receive single oral dose AZD9291 ( 1 x 80 mg tablet ) breakfast time ( approximately 0800 ) 2 treatment period ( immediately follow high fat meal [ feed ] , fast state [ fast ] ) , washout period 9 day dos . Approximately 38 patient plan enrolled dose ; least 30 evaluable patient require complete Part A ( ie , last PK sample Treatment Period 2 [ TP 2 ] collect ) . Additional patient may enrol allow least 30 evaluable patient .</brief_summary>
