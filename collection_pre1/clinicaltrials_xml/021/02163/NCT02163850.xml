	<detailed_description>Prospective , randomize , unblinded , multi-center investigational study enrollment 45 investigational site . The study design compare study device ( Direct Flow Medical Transcatheter Aortic Valve System ) composite event rate blend commercial comparator ( use approve Medtronic self-expanding bioprosthesis Edwards balloon-expandable bioprosthesis ) high extreme risk Subjects severe symptomatic aortic stenosis . Subjects follow index procedure , hospital discharge , 30 day , 6 month 1 year primary endpoint analysis . Thereafter , annual follow-up 2 5 year conduct analyze separately . The primary study endpoint composite all-cause mortality , disable stroke , moderate great residual aortic regurgitation ( base core lab assessment ) 1 year . All primary endpoint event evaluate CEC use definition locate protocol . A sample size 648 subject ( 432 subject Direct Flow Medical Transcatheter Aortic Valve System cohort + 216 subject blend control cohort ) provide least 85 % power test study device non-inferior comparator non-inferiority margin 10 % . Subjects must meet fundamental enrollment criterion severe symptomatic , calcific aortic stenosis quantifiable document source record .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Inclusion criterion : 1 . The subject severe senile degenerative aortic valve stenosis determine echocardiogram Doppler , simultaneous pressure recording cardiac catheterization define : mean aortic gradient ≥40 mmHg , aortic valve area ≤1.0 cm2 aortic valve area index ≤0.6 cm2/m2 . 2 . The subject moderate severe symptom aortic valve stenosis ( NYHA Functional Class ≥II ) . 3 . Subject document aortic annulus size ≥22 mm &lt; 29 mm base center 's assessment preprocedure diagnostic imaging ( confirm Patient Review Committee [ PRC ] ) deem treatable available size test control device . 4 . There agreement heart team ( must include site cardiac interventionalist two cardiac surgeon either two cardiac surgeon staff member hospital procedure perform one surgeon hospital procedure perform surgeon refer institution practice ) subject high operative risk great serious morbidity mortality surgical valve replacement ( see note definition extreme high risk , require level surgical assessment , PRC confirmation ) TAVR appropriate . Subjects designate either extreme risk ( define mortality irreversible morbidity 50 % great 30 day ) high risk ( i.e. , Society Thoracic Surgeons operative risk score &gt; 8 % &gt; 15 % risk surgical mortality 30 day extreme risk ) . This conclusion shall base consensus one cardiac interventionalist two cardiac surgeon review case careful consideration Subject 's STS risk score comorbidities . 5 . Subject understands study requirement treatment procedure , provide write informed consent . 6 . Subject agree capable return study hospital require schedule follow visit . Exclusion criterion : 1 . Left ventricular ejection fraction ( LVEF ) &lt; 20 % determine rest echocardiogram . 2 . Subjects acute STEMI within 30 day precede index procedure . 3 . Chronic kidney disease creatinine clearance &lt; 20 ml/min . 4 . Subjects platelet count &lt; 50,000 cells/mm³ WBC &lt; 1000 cells/mm³ within 7 day prior index procedure . 5 . Subject know contraindication hypersensitivity antithrombin regimen ( aspirin , P2Y12 inhibitor ) adequately pretreated , inability anticoagulated study procedure . Note : Subjects require chronic anticoagulation must able treat additionally either aspirin clopidogrel . 6 . Any subject balloon valvuloplasty ( BAV ) within 72 hour prior index procedure . 7 . Subjects wait list organ transplant . 8 . Subjects know medical illness associate life expectancy le one year , expectation subject improve despite treatment aortic stenosis . 9 . Subject know hypersensitivity contrast agent adequately premedicated , know hypersensitivity nickel , tantalum , titanium , polyurethane . 10 . Subjects history stroke transient ischemic attack ( TIA ) within previous 60 day index procedure . 11 . Subjects active gastrointestinal ( GI ) bleed bleed preclude dual antiplatelet therapy . 12 . Subjects present hemodynamic instability cardiogenic shock require inotropic support mechanical support device . 13 . Subjects plan treatment investigational device procedure 1 year followup , currently participate investigational drug another device trial . 14 . Any planned surgical , percutaneous coronary peripheral procedure perform within 30 day followup TAVR procedure . 15 . Untreated clinically significant coronary artery disease require revascularization . 16 . Newly identify leave atrial thrombus treat . 17 . Active endocarditis sepsis within 6 month prior study procedure . 18 . Any condition result inability provide inform consent trial difficulty assessment neurologic status . 19 . Congenital bicuspid unicuspid valve . 20 . Prior aortic valve surgery preexist prosthetic heart valve position ( mitral tricuspid ring permissible ) . 21 . A native valve annulus diameter &lt; 22mm &gt; 29mm determine screen CT scan . 22 . Echocardiographic evidence new intracardiac mass , untreated thrombus , vegetation require treatment . 23 . &gt; 3+ : aortic regurgitation , mitral regurgitation tricuspid regurgitation . 24 . Severe mitral tricuspid stenosis . 25 . Thoracic aortic aneurysm ( TAA ) &gt; 5.50 cm . 26 . Inability transfuse blood . 27 . Subject femoral arterial access acceptable study define device Instructions Use . 28 . Coronary anatomy precludes perfusion native coronary artery postimplant . 29 . Prohibitive leave ventricular outflow tract ( LVOT ) calcification would prevent proper deployment transcatheter valve .</criteria>
