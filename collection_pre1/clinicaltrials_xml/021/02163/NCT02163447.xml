	<brief_summary>This double-blinded randomized control phase III trial 300 HIV uninfected pregnant woman child bear . The study intervention divide two phase . In first phase , HIV uninfected woman 12-20 week gestation randomize equal proportion one three intermittent preventive therapy pregnancy ( IPTp ) treatment arm : 1 ) 3 dos sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine ( SP ) , 2 ) 3 dos dihydroartemisinin-piperaquine ( DP ) , 3 ) monthly DP . All three intervention arm either SP DP placebo ensure adequate blinding achieve . Follow-up pregnant woman end approximately 6 week give birth . In second phase study , child bear mother enrol study follow birth reach 36 month age . Children born mother randomize receive 3 dos SP pregnancy receive DP every 3 month 2-24 month age . Children born mother randomize receive 3 dos DP monthly DP pregnancy receive either DP every 3 month monthly DP 2-24 month age . To ensure adequate blinding , child receive DP every 3 month give DP placebo month take DP . Children follow additional year 24-36 month age follow intervention . We test hypothesis IPT DP significantly reduce burden malaria pregnancy infancy improve development naturally acquire antimalarial immunity .</brief_summary>

Pregnant woman child receive standard care designate Uganda MOH guideline . Routine care child use Integrated Management Childhood Illness ( IMCI ) guideline . During routine assessment subject ask visit outside health facility use medication outside study protocol . Standardized assessment adherence also do study drug administer home Insecticide Treated Net use . A routine history physical exam perform use standardized clinical assessment form . Blood collect finger prick thick smear , collection plasma PK study , filter paper sample . Phlebotomy routine laboratory test ( CBC ALT ) monitor potential adverse event study medication immunology study perform every 8 week pregnant woman every 16 week child . Non malaria screen also include stool ova parasite examination , circulate filarial antigen ( ICT card Wucheria ) , blood smear microfilaremia ( include Mansonella perstans ) use Knott 's technique . For pregnant woman child 2-24 month age , study drug administer time routine visit .</detailed_description>
