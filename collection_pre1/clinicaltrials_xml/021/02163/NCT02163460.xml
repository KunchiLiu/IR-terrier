	<brief_title>Repair Large Incisional Hernias - To Drain Not Drain Randomised Clinical Trial</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The present randomised clinical trial approve research ethic committee São Paulo School Medicine - Federal University São Paulo ( Universidade Federal de São Paulo - UNIFESP ) , State University Western Paraná ( Universidade Estadual Oeste Paraná - UNIOESTE ) University Hospital Western Paraná ( Hospital Universitário Oeste Paraná - HUOP ) compliance 1964 Declaration Helsinki later update . The study design randomisation follow Consolidated Standards Reporting Trials ( CONSORT ) version 2010 15 . All participant read sign informed consent form preoperative assessment visit . Inclusion exclusion criterion Individuals primary recurrent incisional hernia assess HUOP , longitudinal transverse ventral hernia secondary previous surgical incision , measure 5 15 cm dissection hernial sac classify large large accord Chevrel 's classification , consider eligible16 . In individual multiple defect , length cranial margin cranial defect caudal margin caudal defect considered17 . Individuals subject emergency surgery , infection , immunosuppressed , young 18 old 80 year old , ASA III IV , serum albumin concentration lower 3.0 g/dl refuse participation exclude study . Surgical technique The participant admit hospital night surgery perform update assessment surgical risk accord American Society Anesthesiologists ( ASA ) criterion , well measurement serum albumin concentration . Incisional herniorrhaphy surgery perform follow group 's technique systematisation resident physician supervise one four surgeon professor medical course UNIOESTE use onlay technique describe Chevrel18-20 . Antibiotic prophylaxis perform single 2 g dose cefazolin time anaesthetic induction follow booster 1 g dose surgery last three hour . The aponeurosis dissect 5 cm beyond aponeurotic defect . Approximation aponeurotic margin midline reconstruction perform use polyglactin 910 # 1 suture . Tension relieve release incision perform external oblique muscle aponeurosis , 3 cm away linea alba , describe Gibson21 . A macroporous polypropylene monofilament P1 mesh 100 g/m2 ( Cousin Biotec ) fix aponeurosis separate 2-0 polypropylene suture perform every 2 cm . The participant randomise immediately mesh fixation computer-based random number generator allocate two intervention group . Interventions In group 1 , 4.8 mm diameter continuous closed-suction tubular drain ( Medsharp Ind.Com.Prod.Hosp.Ltda - reg . MS ( Ministério da Saúde [ Health Ministry registry ] ) : 80267170001 ) place aponeurosis subcutaneous tissue caudally incision . Next , subcutaneous tissue approximation perform separate absorbable polyglactin 910 2/0 suture . Drains use group 2 , separate absorbable polyglactin 920 2/0 suture place subcutaneous mesh aponeurosis every 2 cm mean progressive tension suture ( Quilting Sutures ) technique , describe Pollock et al.10-13 . Skin closure perform simple separate suture 1 cm interval use nylon monofilament suture # 4-0 group . The participant request use support girdle provide surgical staff hospital home first 30 day surgery . In group 1 , drain remove drained volume le 40 ml/24 hour . Outcomes All participant clinically assess attend staff detect postoperative complication , seroma formation surgical site infection , especially postoperative ( PO ) day one , three , five , seven , 14-16 29-31 . The data record pre-established form . All participant subject abdominal wall ultrasound ass seroma formation three time point define : early ( PO day four six ) , intermediate ( PO day 14 16 ) late ( PO day 29 31 ) . The test perform radiology staff HUOP . Seroma define collection volume subcutaneous fluid without debris . All participant remain hospital first ultrasound assessment perform . The presence seroma consider main outcome . Clinical seroma define visible bulge fluctuation without sign infection , subclinical seroma define absence detectable abnormality physical examination presence volume fluid collection abdominal wall ultrasound , seroma define occurrence fluid collection detect ultrasound . Surgical wound infection prospectively define accord criterion formulate Centers Disease Control Prevention ( CDC ) Guideline Prevention Surgical Site Infection , 1999 22 . Sample size calculation The sample size calculate base significance level alpha = 5 % 80 % power . A two-tailed test comparison two proportion use compare occurrence seroma group drain ( 50.0 % ) progressive tension suture ( 10.0 % ) Statistics The initial statistical analysis data collect present study descriptive . In regard quantitative ( numerical ) variable , summary measure include mean , standard deviation , median , maximum minimum value calculate , one-dimensional scatterplots construct . The data corresponding qualitative ( categorical ) variable assess absolute relative ( percent ) frequency . Inferential analysis perform confirm refute evidence find descriptive analysis . For purpose , Student 's t-test independent sample use compare group participant . In inferential analysis , significance level ( α ) establish 5 % . The statistical analysis perform use software R version 2.15.2 .</detailed_description>
