	<brief_summary>Currently know effective treatment recurrent resistant neuroblastoma . Fenretinide anticancer agent may work differently standard chemotherapy . It may cause buildup wax-like substance cancer cell call ceramides . In laboratory study , find much ceramide build neuroblastoma cell , die . Fenretinide give mouth capsule many people , include child . When Fenretinide give capsule , little drug absorb intestine body . This mean patient take many capsule fenretinide mouth several time day . In study , new oral preparation fenretinide ( call 4-HPR/LXS oral powder ) test see fenretinide absorb body . 4-HPR/LXS oral powder test previously limit number child adult cancer patient . Ketoconazole , commonly use treat fungus infection , increase fenretinide level body interfere body 's ability break fenretinide . Ketoconazole give time fenretinide powder . There preclinical data show combine fenretinide vincristine prolong survival animal model , therefore , hop give vincristine fenretinide work well neuroblastoma either drug give alone . About 70 child neuroblastoma treat various version fenretinide powder date , include dozen child also take fenretinide powder ketoconazole , toxicity occur limited dosage serious unexpected side effect occur . However , vincristine never give fenretinide fenretinide plus ketoconazole . Vincristine give ketoconazole child adult neuroblastomas cancer .</brief_summary>
