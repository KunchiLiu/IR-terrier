	<detailed_description>Dyspnea `` subjective experience breathe discomfort consist qualitatively distinct sensation vary intensity . '' Dyspnea , shortness breath , common problem affect half hospitalized patient ; `` shortness breath '' `` labor difficult breathing '' account 3 4 million emergency department visit annually . Dyspnea represent sensation , symptom , illness . Each set experience involve distinct sensory , perceptual , cognitive process , include : detection signal ; perception threat remarkable challenge ; , construction , mental representation , illness . As sensory experience dyspnea compare sensation pain . Although labored breathe painful usual sense word dyspnea , like pain , concept vary along multiple dimension . Like pain , dyspnea signal need medical attention ; unlike pain dyspnea localize sensation originate cardiopulmonary system rather generalized danger signal . Research demonstrate sensory information respiratory system activate region cerebral cortex produce perception dyspnea far less known neurophysiology dyspnea vision , hearing , even pain . Dyspnea likely arise multiple nervous system source . Investigations mechanisms underlie respiratory sensation include study airway anesthesia , chest wall strapping , exercise , heart-lung transplantation , hyperventilation , opioid use . Study perception breathe sensation individual spinal cord injury present additional opportunity . The goal propose project examine effect increasingly severe level spinal cord injury perception breathe sensation participant able breathe without use ventilator . Afferent pathways transmit somatosensory signal central nervous system ( i.e. , brain spinal cord ) well describe event-related potential use measure respiratory somatosensation high temporal resolution . Event-related potential ( ERPs ) time-locked cortical signal measure non-invasively surface scalp response brief ( &lt; 200 msec ) , presentation respiratory stimuli normal breathing . Davenport et al . first identify sensory-perceptual ERPs inspiratory stimulus ( occur 50-150 msec stimulus delivery ) Harver et al . first examine perceptual-cognitive ERPs inspiratory stimulus ( occur 150-400 msec post-stimulus ) . Study respiratory-related ERPs patient spinal cord injury present rare opportunity examine neurophysiological mechanism underlie perception breathe extent somatosensory information reach cerebral cortex varies level lesion .</detailed_description>
