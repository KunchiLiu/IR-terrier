	<brief_summary>Cardiovascular disease ( CVD ) account major mortality morbidity rate Hong Kong ( HK ) cancer . Increasing energy expenditure regular exercise participation find low risk CVD hyperlipidemia obesity . Healthcare professional often prescribe lifestyle exercise disease prevention , rehabilitation , health maintenance purpose . Previous study reveal Tai Chi walk widely practice HK citizen . However , limited study find compare health benefit Tai Chi walk . Do Tai Chi walk equally effective raise metabolic rate reduce CVD risk ? The difference energy cost single bout Tai Chi walk document . Limited study report effect Tai Chi lower CVD risk . Since walk Tai Chi heavily promote HK recent year , urgent need document evidence two common form exercise term reduce CVD risk . Therefore , purpose present study investigate energy cost well CV health benefit , term aerobic fitness , body composition , blood pressure , blood lipid profile , walk Tai Chi exercise sample HK Chinese adult , compare effect two exercise . The investigator hypothesize Tai Chi walk similar effect improve energy cost reduce CVD risk .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Evaluation Energy Expenditure Cardiovascular Health Effects From Tai Chi Walking Exercise</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>An influential medical report release 1996 confirmed daily accumulation 30 minute moderate physical activity would significantly lower risk many chronic disease ( Physical Activity Health : A Report Surgeon General . Atlanta , GA : U.S. 1996 ) . The report also recommend walk one best form exercise suitable healthy patient population age . To meet daily 30 minute exercise guideline , popular health promotion campaign -- 10,000 step walk per day , widely implement western country , recently promote Health Info-World HK Hospital Authority . Some study demonstrate various health benefit regular walking . The recent study Murphy et al . ( Med Sci Sports Exerc . 2002 ) provide excellent example , 6-week walking program ( 5 day per week ) , one single bout continuous 30 minute walk per day yield similar health benefit three 10-minute walk per day . The exercise intensity walk exercise 70-80 % maximal heart rate , result significant increase HDL-cholesterol , decrease triglyceride total cholesterol . Both walk exercise improve body composition significantly . Moreover , tension/anxiety also decrease significantly . Similar health benefit also note several study ( Moreau KL , et al . Med Sci Sports Exerc 2001 . Wullink M et al . Med Sci Sports Exerc 2001 . O'Hara RB et al . ACSM 's Health Fitness J 2000 ) . In study , walk intervention period vary 6 week 24 week , daily walk time vary 20 minute 50 minute . Exercise intensity vary 50 % 70 % VO2max . However , energy cost typical walk bout HK adult clear . Since body composition HK Chinese different report westerner , reasonably believe energy expenditure walk HK Chinese different find literature . The CVD benefit result walk report Chinese population . These outcome measure derive walk Tai Chi compare . Tai Chi ancient form Chinese fitness exercise . A number study investigate positive health improvement effect Tai Chi patient ( Channer KS et al . Postgrad Med J 1996 . Fontana JA et al . Nurs Clin North Am 2000 . Lan C et al . Med Sci Sports Exerc 1999 ) , well healthy individual ( Lan C et al . Med Sci Sports Exerc 1998 . Zhuo D et al . Can J Appl sport Sci 1984 ) . These health benefit include improvement aerobic fitness ( Lai JS et al . J Am Geriatr Soc 1995 . Hong YL et al . Br J Sport Med 2000 ) energy metabolism ( Zhuo D et al . Can J Appl sport Sci 1984 . Schneider D et al . Int J Sport Med 1991 ) , muscular strength balance ( Hong YL et al . Br J Sport Med 2000 . Chan WW et al . Phys Occup Ther Geriatr 2000 . Schaller KJ et al . J Gerontol Nurs 1996 ) , well mental control ( Jin P. J Psycho-som Res 1992 . Fasko Jr D et al . Clin Kinesiol 2001 ) . Compared walking , intuitively perceive Tai Chi characterize low exercise intensity metabolic cost . But surprisingly , Lan et al . report exercise intensity typical session Tai Chi ( 24 minute Yang style ) exceed 70 % maximal heart rate ( Lan C et al . Arch Phys Med Rehabil 1996 ) . However , energy cost single bout Tai Chi investigate . Tai Chi walk seem provide similar benefit compare simultaneously except one study . Jin report heart rate , blood pressure , urinary catecholamine change Tai Chi similar walk speed 6 km/h ( Jin P. J Psycho-som Res 1992 ) . However , energy cost CVD risk measure investigate study . Although walk Tai Chi believe positive health benefit , extent exercise contribute raise energy metabolism well CV health improvement document . Which form exercise would elicit high energy demand produce great CV health effect ? Currently scientific data available report result HK Chinese . Results study valuable practitioner provide quantifiable prescription obese individual weight control , well need improve CV health . AIMS Increasing energy expenditure consider crucial role reduce obesity . Raising level energy expenditure also find produce improvement cardio-respiratory fitness lower CVD risk . However , energy cost Tai Chi walk fully study training effect CVD risk compare . The purpose present study examine level energy expenditure Tai Chi walking , compare training effect Tai Chi walk term lower CVD risk . Specific aim project follow : 1 . To evaluate change energy expenditure , aerobic fitness , body composition , SF-12 , blood serum lipid profile ( total , LDL , HDL-cholesterols ) , fast blood glucose , dietary habit physical fitness 12 week Tai Chi walk training , respectively . 2. compare effect Tai Chi walk exercise improve energy expenditure , aerobic fitness , body composition , SF-12 , blood serum lipid profile ( total , LDL , HDL-cholesterols ) , fast blood glucose , dietary habit physical fitness 12 week Tai Chi walk training . 3. compare energy metabolism two exercise similar practice intensity ( approximately 50-70 % age-predicted maximal heart rate , 30 minute exercise bout ) .</detailed_description>
