	<brief_summary>Many serious illness characterise lack oxygen delivery body 's tissue . This due problem circulation , heart fail pump blood efficiently blood pressure low , due change lung prevent transfer oxygen effectively air blood . Many treatment use critically ill patient aim improve supply oxygen-rich blood tissue . These include drug increase blood pressure make heart pump forcibly , blood transfusion increase amount oxygen blood carry , ventilator ( breathe machine ) help lung introduce oxygen bloodstream . Decisions use treatment base number factor . One important assessment much oxygen individual patient use give time . Whilst possible measure average oxygen consumption long period time healthy individual , equipment technique need simply practical routine use clinical set critical care unit . Critical care doctor nurse therefore rely number different indicator adequacy amount oxygen provide order make decision best treat patient . Unfortunately , limitation , affect treatment patient may receive , difficult interpret . Examples include 'mixed venous oxygen saturation ' ( SvO2 ) , amount oxygen blood come back lung body , ready oxygen add , blood lactate level , give indication whether tissue enough oxygen produce energy need function efficient manner . Our group develop device add easily normal equipment use critical care ward patient ventilator , accurately rapidly measure amount oxygen individual consuming . This study provide u data investigator define `` normal '' range oxygen consumption patient , treatment alter consumption . In future study , investigator know normal range , introduce new technique improve oxygen consumption patient whose consumption less ideal .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>This prospective longitudinal observational study thirty intubate , ventilate patient . Patients recruited population already intubate ventilated individual adult intensive care unit ( AICU ) . Once patient recruit insert optical gas analyser ( OGA ) ventilation circuit ( tube ) 48 hour . Data continuously collect 48 hour attachment OGA , death extubation patient , analyse retrospectively . A time series describe oxygen consumption resolution one minute le prepared standard measure dispersion calculate . In addition , variable routinely record computerised clinical record period examine association seek variable change oxygen consumption measure OGA . We prospectively identify variable , base publish literature , likely associate variation oxygen consumption ( VO2 ) upon attention focus , though others may become apparent study : - Body temperature - Seizures - Change haemoglobin concentration ( include due blood transfusion ) - Bolus fluid - Vasoactive drug - Beta-agonist drug - Drugs affect angiotensin-converting enzyme system - Renal replacement therapy - Feeding - Sedation - Neuromuscular blocker - Mode ventilation - Fraction inspire oxygen ( FiO2 ) - Physical activity - Surgery</detailed_description>
