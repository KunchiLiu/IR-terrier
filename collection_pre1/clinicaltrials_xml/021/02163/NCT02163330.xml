	<brief_summary>Normal pressure hydrocephalus ( NPH ) uncommon cause dementia possibly reversible treatment . First describe 1965 consist triad gait disturbance , cognitive deterioration , urinary incontinence together enlarge cerebral ventricle normal cerebrospinal fluid ( CSF ) pressure . Foregoing trauma hemorrhage , infection , mass lesion , aqueductal stenosis contribute hydrocephalus . These symptomatic secondary form NPH consider focus lie idiopathic type ( iNPH ) . Prevalence iNPH increase significantly age . General estimate range 21.9 per 100,000 total population survey increase 181.7 per 100,000 people 70 79 year age . The clinical presentation varies significantly severity progression symptom . For diagnosis entire triad present . In typical case gait balance disturbance appear either concurrently urinary incontinence onset dementia . Current treatment recommendation base surgical diversion CSF , shunt place either ventricular system lumbar subarachnoid space distal site , peritoneal pleural cavity venous system , CSF reabsorb . Even though immediate response rate shunt treatment might favorable rate 80 % responder report , perioperative long-term morbidity mortality CSF shunting procedure significant . A meta-analysis 44 article find pool , mean rate shunt complication 38 % . Even though acute surgical complication rate low , shunt dysfunction long-term complication relatively common . Shunt malfunction ( 20 % ) , subdural hematoma ( 2-17 % ) , seizure ( 3-11 % ) , shunt infection ( 3-6 % ) intracerebral hematoma ( 3 % ) common complication . In good long-term survival , sustain improvement possible , rate 39 % document 5 year .In view complication rate , lack alternative treatment option clinical study surprise . Even though iNPH per definition lack raise intracranial pressure spinal tap , monitor ICP prior surgery reveals increase amount brief ( usually 30 second 1 minute ) increase static ICP , call Lundberg B wave , patient improve shunt placement . When patient schedule shunt treatment wait period several week diagnosis operation due congest wait list . Acetazolamide ( Diamox ) show reduce production CSF clinical case raise intracranial pressure . It consider drug choice treatment idiopathic intracranial pressure ( pseudotumor cerebri ) . Intuitively connection Acetazolamide treatment option iNPH seem logical . Encouraging case study publish previously show fascinate improvement success treat iNPH Acetazolamide . A systematic placebo control study concern use Acetazolamide iNPH miss would possibly pave way alternative treatment option avoid surgery complication .</brief_summary>
