	<detailed_description>Orthotopic heart transplantation well establish therapeutic measure end stage heart failure , lead significant improvement survival quality life . Allograft vascular disease remain frequent cause morbidity mortality orthotopic heart transplantation , angiographic evidence allograft vascular disease around 50 % patient 5- 15-year follow-up . In routine clinical practice , orthotopic heart transplantation patient receive periodic cardiac catheterization early detection allograft vascular disease . The coronary angiography patient characterize several technical difficulty , generally relate presence aortotomy anomalous implantation coronary ostia orthotopic position allograft . For reason , trans femoral approach usually prefer . In last two decade , trans radial approach coronary angiography emerge effective , safe able improve patient comfort . However , universal consensus optimal choice radial access either leave right artery . Currently , choice largely dependent operator 's preference . The trans-right-radial approach generally prefer routine clinical practice mainly due easy catheter manipulation operator patient 's right side , current design radial compression device right wrist medical market . As , major barrier prevent wide adoption leave radial access lie difficulty reach leave wrist leaning patient , particularly shorter operator obese patient . However , great deal attention recently direct toward trans-left-radial access , important anatomical advantage due vascular anatomy epiaortic vessel straighter route leave coronary ostium , could also reduce risk cerebrovascular complication . In context , recent metanalysis demonstrate trans leave radial access preferable trans-right-radial approach term fluoroscopy time contrast use diagnostic interventional coronary procedure . Moreover , expect , indication lower failure rate radial access leave right . No data available performance trans leave radial access trans right radial approach coronary angiography orthotopic heart transplantation patient . However , particular setting patient , trans-left-radial access might reduce technical difficulty relate anatomical variation . In single-centre , prospective , randomize study , seek compare trans right radial approach versus trans-left-radial access term amount contrast medium , radiation exposure , number catheter use , cross-over access site rate local systemic complication orthotopic heart transplantation patient . Study objectives 1 . To demonstrate superiority trans leave radial access , compare trans right radial approach coronary angiography orthotopic heart transplantation patient , term amount contrast medium , radiation exposure , number catheter use , cross-over access site rate local systemic complication 2 . To determine relationship operator experience radiation exposure answer question whether minimize fluoroscopy time increase operator experience ( `` post-hoc analysis '' ) ; 3 . To assess cost effectiveness coronary angiography perform trans right radial approach versus trans leave radial access ( `` post hoc analysis '' ) . Method section Clinical data A detailed anamnesis trial participant collect : age , gender , weight , high , BMI , coronary risk factor ( hypertension , dyslipemia , diabetes mellitus , smoke habit , obesity ) , cause transplantation , date transplantation , current clinical status therapy , ejection fraction , renal function complete blood count . In particular , creatinine value evaluate baseline , 3-4 day interventional procedure , impair , also 7-10 day coronary angiography . Procedure Participating interventional cardiologist high-volume radial operator ( meet minimal proficiency criterion ≥50 % interventional case radial approach per year ) . Each variable analyze separately consultant , fellow , post graduate fellow ( trainee ) . In particular , participate interventional cardiologist divide well experienced radial operator ( define person perform &gt; 500 radial procedure include &gt; 200 procedure recent year ) , less experienced ( person do 200-500 radial procedure recent year ) , trainee ( person do &lt; 200 radial procedure ) . The procedure perform accord current guideline . At end coronary angiography , introducer removal , hand wrist compression device ( TR Band , Terumo ) use group . The procedural time measure arterial puncture vascular hemostasis . The radiation exposure measure use : 1. dose area product meter , reflect dose radiation administer area patient administer . This continuous variable measure microgray meter square ( μGym2 ) . 2. fluoroscopy time , reflect length time patient operator expose radiation ; 3. total dose , measure milligray ( mGy ) , administer angiography system . The amount contrast medium procedure record . The number type catheter employ well number type wire use interventional procedure detect . The cross-over access site also collect . In addition , systemic vascular complication evaluate pre-discharge . In particular , vascular complication define haemoglobin loss least 2 mmol/l , necessity blood transfusion vascular repair , hematoma , pseudoaneurysm arterial occlusion . The renal failure procedure define raise serum value creatinine ≥ 0.5 mg/dl ≥ 25 % within 24-72 hour exposure contrast medium . Statistical Analysis All clinical procedural characteristic summarize mean ± Standard Deviation continuous variable normal distribution , median ( interquartile range ) continuous skew distribution , number ( percentage ) categorical variable ; The Student , Mann-Whitney U Fisher exact test compute appropriate bivariate analysis . Firstly , analysis conduct intention treat basis , regardless possible access site cross-over . Afterwards , efficacy subset analysis perform . A two-tailed p-value &lt; 0.05 consider statistically significant . Data analyze use SPSS Windows version 20.0 software ( SPSS Inc. Chicago , USA ) . The sample size calculate order provide , 80 % power , difference 20 ml Standard Deviation ± 30 amount contrast dose ( alpha value=0.05 ) trans-left-radial access vs. trans-right-radial access .</detailed_description>
