	<brief_title>Study Compare Two Treatments Axillary Hidradenitis Suppurativa : Carbon Dioxide Laser Versus Surgical Deroofing</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>- We treat patient Stage 2 ( interconnect sinus tract nodule ) hidradenitis suppurativa somewhat active involvement ( include drainage ) axilla . We treat ONE axilla per patient . - After patient screen deemed appropriate candidate , randomize treatment group : CO2 laser excision surgical deroofing . - For patient , single intervention ( either CO2 laser excision surgical deroofing ) , 5 plan follow-up appointment follow interval : 1 week , 2 week , 4 week , 3 month , 6 month . This take place course 6 month patient . - During study , subject ask provide information quality life measure , fill questionnaire ( DLQI Skindex29 ) visit . - Inclusion criterion : 1 . Be least 13 year old diagnosis hidradenitis affect underarms . 2 . Agree follow undergo study-related procedure , follow-up six month period . - Exclusion criterion : 1 . Patients already undergone surgical excision affect area . 2 . Patients pregnant breast feed able take part study due unknown effect CO2 laser pregnant female , well risk lidocaine use pregnancy breastfeed 3 . Patients history allergy lidocaine topical anesthetic able take part study . 4 . Patients history vitiligo CO2 laser may cause new spot depigmentation . 5 . Patients pacemaker/defibrillator place .</detailed_description>
