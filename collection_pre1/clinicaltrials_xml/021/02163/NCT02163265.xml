	<detailed_description>Pectus excavatum ( PE ) pectus carinatum ( PC ) common anterior chest wall deformity . Pectus excavatum , also know funnel chest , characterise deep depression usually involve low one-half two-thirds sternum . PE common congenital chest deformity report incidence 1:1000 8:1000 live birth , male-to-female ratio 3:1 . Pectus carinatum , pigeon breast , refers protrusion sternum approximately seven time less frequent PE , affect 1:1000 1:10,000 live birth . More 26 % familial occurrence . The anatomic deformity believe many caused disproportionate growth costal cartilage compare remainder bony thoracic skeleton , exert pressure sternum cause depression ( PE ) protrusion ( PC ) . Although majority patient PE recognize first year life , depression usually become much severe childhood adolescence ; PC usually manifest time growth spurt early teenage year . The deformity frequently present aesthetic disturbance , also association mild limitation activity , obstructive pulmonary mechanic , slight dyspnea , asthma , palpitation abnormal cardiac physiology . Symptoms PC patient remain often vague . PC patient usually complain appearance chest rather functional difficulty . Chest wall deformity cause great social timidity , sense shame often feel limited self-worth inferiority , depressive mood inadequate social behaviour due disturb body perception . The result investigator want achieve postoperative PFTs demonstrate improvement total lung capacity improve exercise performance show restrict cardiac stroke volume increase work breathing describe PE patient ameliorate operative intervention . These result also contribute establish criterion indication surgery . The significant quality-of-life improvement perceive psychosocial physical functioning encourage physician approach PE repair manner physician treatment deformity deleterious impact psychological physical well-being individual . Systematic evaluation body image become diagnostic standard assessment patient present correction thoracic wall deformity .</detailed_description>
