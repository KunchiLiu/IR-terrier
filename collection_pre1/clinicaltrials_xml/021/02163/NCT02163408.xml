	<brief_summary>This technical development study goal develop 3D technique atherosclerosis plaque characterization . We hypothesize 3D MRI superior 2D MRI characterize major plaque constituent contribute severe clinical event myocardial infarction stroke . The major advantage 3D technique develop include high spatial resolution , reduce scan time , optimize image contrast . The use contrast injection need new technique , greatly beneficial patient advance chronic kidney disease.This fund clinical trial .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>All participant undergo conventional MRI protocol new image protocol use develop technique . They may either non-contrast scan contrast-enhanced scan depend stage development . The comparison result two protocol used evaluate performance new technique help optimization specific technical aspect .</detailed_description>
