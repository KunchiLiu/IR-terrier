	<brief_summary>Coronary heart disease ( CHD ) lead cause death worldwide . The disease characterize high mortality rate ( 40 % ) course continuously alter lifestyle , gene polymorphism therapeutic treatment . Fasting concentration blood lipid lipoproteins partially express complex relation dyslipidemia CHD . Following indication state nearly 40 year ago Zilversmit , accumulate evidence postprandial lipemia play important role atherogenic process [ ref Kolovou ] , particularly hour day spend postprandial state . Furthermore , increase blood glucose triglyceride ( TGs ) follow meal stimulate oxidative stress , impair endothelial function , rise inflammatory factor lead atherosclerosis . Previous study report postprandial lipemia subject obesity , metabolic syndrome , diabetes mellitus , elderly , patient CHD others . However , currently estimation cardiovascular disease risk base fast blood value triglyceride ( TGs ) inflammatory marker . The effect postprandial atherogenic factor initiation progression atherosclerosis actually known.The Hellenic Postprandial Lipemia Study ( HPLS ) design study consequence postprandial lipemia CRP inflammatory marker high-risk adult . Furthermore , HPLS study investigate whether hypolipidemic , hypoglycemic antihypertensive medication may lessen exaggerated postprandial lipemia well rest abnormal postprandial metabolism . Finally , HPLS study intend evaluate influence gene polymorphism involve lipid glucose metabolism postprandial lipemia cardiovascular outcome .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>The Hellenic Postprandial Lipemia Study ( HPLS )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The study aim recruit 1200 patient characterize either high risk very-high risk Coronary Heart Disease . It assume equal number high risk high risk patient include study . Patients invited participate study outpatient clinic 14 center Athens , Greece . The study approve institution ethic committee inform consent obtain participate patient . Participating patient recently ( 15 day ) initiate one follow dislipidemic treatment : - Simvastatin 40 mg , - Atorvastatin 80 mg , - Rosuvastatin 40 mg , - Statin intolerant subject receive colesevelam 3.75 g/day fenofibrate 145 mg/day . All patient receive treatment initial treatment dyslipidemia exception statin intolerant patient . All patient time inclusion study evaluate gene polymorphism part dyslipidemic profile evaluation . Furthermore patient characterize high risk high risk accord SCORE level risk , calculate use Greek version low-risk region chart . Each center recruit 50 high 50 high risk patient . Each site include 10 consecutive high risk 10 high risk patient treatment group describe . The following data collect patient : - Personal demographic detail - Family personal medical history ( include smoking , hypertension , hyperlipidemia glucose metabolism , well cardiovascular disease history ) - Past measurement blood pressure , - Diabetes lipid , - Diagnostic procedure undertake ( coronary angioplasty , Coronary artery by-pass surgery ) , - Measurements blood pressure , - Weight , height , waist hip circumference . Body mass index ( BMI ) calculate weight/height2 - The SCORE level risk also calculate use Greek version low-risk region chart . Each subject complete 2 Lipotest meal first one give begin study second one least 3 month hypolipidemic treatment . Before 4 hour meal blood sample collect . After , subject follow annually 3 year . Lipotest Meal The Lipotest meal diagnostic standardized meal recognize Hellenic Drug Organization ( EOF , National Drug Organization ) . A single serving , provide sachet , comprise 115 g powder rehydrated add 150 ml water . The powder water mixed homogeneity ( 2-3 minute hand hold mixer ) , refrigerate form mousse . All ingredient food grade stable period 24hours preparation prove antioxidant test The ingredient ' composition Lipotest hydrogenate vegetable fat , glucose syrup solid , milk protein , sugar , emulsifier ( lactic acetic acid ester monoglycerides diglycerides , cocoa powder ( 20-22 % fat content ) , defatted cocoa powder ( 10-12 % fat content ) , flavoring . On per serve basis , Lipotest provide 832 kcal ( 42 % FDA Daily reference value ( DRV ) adult , 42 % European Guideline Daily Amount , GDA ) , 10 g protein ( 20 % DRV , 20 % GDA ) , 25 g carbohydrate ( 8.3 % DRV , 10 % GDA ) simple sugar comprise 14.3 g ( DRV , 16 % GDA ) , 2.1 g fiber ( 8.4 % DRV ) , 0.15 g salt ( 2.5 % DRV sodium ) , 75 g fat ( 115 % DRV , 109 % GDA ) , fully saturate ( 375 % DRV GDA ) hydrogenation vegetable fat . Fat use coconut oil name Cegepal VF HC 77 Lamequick 6068 Cognis , fully approve use food application powder form . Oral fat load The meal administrate morning 12-h overnight fast . Subjects eat meal within 20 min instruct keep physical activity minimum , refrain smoke fast 4 h test . Blood sample withdraw 0 4 h determination TGs concentration . The meal administrate twice , treatment ( visit 1 ) 3 month treatment hypolipidemic , hypoglycemic antihypertensive drug ( visit 2 ) . Collection blood biomarker analyse All laboratory test carry part everyday clinical practice cover patient insurance . Serum total cholesterol ( TC ) , high density lipoprotein cholesterol ( HDL-C ) TG concentration measure fast postprandial blood sample plasma glucose concentration measure true fast blood sample . Inflammatory marker analysis Plasma analyze hs-C-reactive protein ( CRP ) accord everyday clinical practice cover patient insurance . Study Duration 18 month recruitment period . 3 year follow every patient . Subject Participation Duration 36 Months 1200 high high risk CHD patient Number Participating Sites 14 clinic 12 Hospitals Investigational Product : Not Applicable Investigational Product Dosage &amp; Administration : Not Applicable Concomitant Medication All patient receive concomitant medication accordance everyday practice treat physician . Safety Evaluation All adverse event record accordance applicable law regulation concern medication prescribe accord approve summary product characteristic . Statistical Analysis Continuous variable describe use mean standard deviation . Comparisons continuous variable perform use Student 's t-test Mann-Whitney-U test parametric non-parametric data , respectively . Categorical variable express absolute ( N ) relative ( % ) frequencies analyzed association use chi-square test . The Paired t-test use compare change within group variable Bonferroni test use compare change group , method post hoc comparison Univariate multivariate stepwise linear regression analysis perform order identify independent predictor CRP dependent variable . Survival analysis perform elucidate potential predictor MACE use fast postprandial value study variable gene polymorphism . All test two-sided . P-value consider statistically significant &lt; 0.05 . Data analyze use STATA™ statistical software ( Version 9.0 , Stata Corporation , College Station , TX 77845 , USA ) . Ethical Considerations The Ethics Committee participate Hospital approve non interventional study . All participant sign write informed consent prior participation study . The information protection rule National Institute Health Welfare ( former National Public Health Institute 2009 ) follow throughout study .</detailed_description>
