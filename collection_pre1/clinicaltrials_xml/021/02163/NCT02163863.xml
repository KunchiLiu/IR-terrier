	<detailed_description>The Mimics Study prospective , part randomize study ; initial roll-in registry 10 subject treat BioMimics 3D follow randomized assignment treatment BioMimics 3D Control 2:1 basis 76 subject . The primary purpose study evaluate safety performance BioMimics 3D Stent System treatment symptomatic SFA/proximal popliteal disease base : - Safety ; measure freedom major adverse event determine 30 day procedure , compare historic control . - Performance ; measure freedom clinically drive TLR 6 month , compare historic control .</detailed_description>
