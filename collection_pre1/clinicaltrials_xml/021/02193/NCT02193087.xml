	<brief_title>Safety Immunogenicity Three Formulations Takeda 's Tetravalent Dengue Vaccine Candidate ( TDV )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The vaccine test study Takeda 's Tetravalent Dengue Vaccine Candidate ( TDV ) . This study design determine whether lyophilized formulation provide equivalent safety immunogenicity original liquid formulation . An exploratory analysis add purpose understand whether manufacture formulation effect vaccine . The study enroll approximately 1000 participant . Participants randomly assign ( chance , like flip coin ) one four study groups—which remain undisclosed participant study doctor study ( unless urgent medical need ) : - Group A : TDV Liquid Formulation 1 , subcutaneous ( SC ) injection Day 1 placebo ( dummy ) SC Month 3 - liquid look like study drug active ingredient - Group B : TDV Liquid Formulation 1 , SC injection Day 1 Month 3 - Group C : TDV Liquid Formulation 2 , SC injection Day 1 Month 3 - Group D : TDV Lyophilized formulation SC injection Day 1 Month 3 In order keep treatment arm undisclosed participant doctor , participant receive placebo injection study visit TDV administer ( Month 3 ) . Participants ask record adverse event may relate vaccine injection diary card 28 day vaccination . This multi-center trial conduct United States . The overall time participate study 10 month . Participants make 9 visit clinic include final visit 1 month last dose study drug follow-up assessment . A follow phone call do 6 month last dose ass serious adverse event .</detailed_description>
