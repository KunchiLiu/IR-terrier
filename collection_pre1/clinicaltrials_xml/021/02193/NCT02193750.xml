	<brief_title>Assessing Tolerability Oligosaccharide Supplementation Patients With Crohn 's Disease</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Subjects age &gt; /= 19 year diagnosis CD &gt; /= 6 month , currently remission base Harvey-Bradshaw Index score ( &lt; /=4 point ) C-reactive protein ( &lt; 5 mg/L ) recruit two academic hospital affiliate gastroenterology outpatient clinic ( St. Paul 's Hospital , Vancouver , British Columbia , Canada ; Alfred Hospital , Melbourne , Victoria , Australia ) . The study randomize , double-blind , placebo-controlled trial consist 2-week run-in period follow 4-week study period . Prior study entry , screen visit require potential participant . If participant meet inclusion criterion , randomize either placebo ( 0.55 g total fructans/GOS ) , moderate oligosaccharide group ( 3.25 g total fructans/GOS ) high oligosaccharide group ( 5.43 g total fructans/GOS ) computed-generated scheme within respective center . During run-in period , enrolled subject undergo following : 1 ) Laboratory analysis ( CBC , routine biochemistry , CRP fecal calprotectin ) ; 2 ) Stool collection fecal calprotectin analysis ; 3 ) tolerability assessment include overall gastrointestinal symptom specific symptom ( abdominal bloating , abdominal pain , gut rumbling , flatulence ) utilize 100mm visual analogue scale ( VAS , 0 = symptom ; 100 = worst symptom ever experience ) ; 4 ) fatigue assessment utilizing multi-dimensional fatigue impact scale ( FIS ) ; 5 ) health-related quality life ( HRQOL ) assessment utilize Short Form 36-Item Health Survey ( SF-36 ) 6 ) Mood assessment utilizing Spielberger State-Trait Personality Inventory ( STPI ) . Participants also meet registered dietitian quantify baseline oligosaccharide consumption complete prospective 5-day diet diary alongside validate food frequency questionnaire ( FFQ ) , Monash University Comprehensive Nutritional Assessment Questionnaire ( CNAQ ) assess oligosaccharide intake addition usual nutrient [ 49 ] . Once initial dietary assessment complete , participant begin up-titration oligosaccharide supplementation step-wise fashion reach require daily amount define treatment group allocation . Once achieve , enter 4 week treatment time relapse . Participants undergo re-assessment study period 2 week ( Visit # 3 ) , study completion ( Visit # 4 ) . If participant undergoes CD flare run-in period , withdrawn study . The end point study 4 week treatment time relapse .</detailed_description>
