	<brief_title>Erlotinib Hydrochloride Treating Patients With Stage IB-IIIA Non-small Cell Lung Cancer That Has Been Completely Removed Surgery ( An ALCHEMIST Treatment Trial )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To assess whether adjuvant therapy erlotinib ( erlotinib hydrochloride ) result improve overall survival ( OS ) placebo patient completely resect stage IB ( &gt; = 4 cm ) -IIIA epidermal growth factor receptor ( EGFR ) mutant non-small cell lung cancer ( NSCLC ) ( confirm centrally ) follow complete resection standard post-operative therapy . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . To assess whether adjuvant therapy erlotinib result improve disease free survival ( DFS ) placebo patient completely resect stage IB ( &gt; = 4 cm ) -IIIA EGFR mutant NSCLC ( confirm centrally ) follow complete resection standard post-operative therapy , overall within stage subgroup : IB II/IIIA . II . To evaluate safety profile erlotinib adjuvant setting . III . To assess whether adjuvant therapy erlotinib result improve DFS rate 2 year , OS rate 5 10 year placebo patient completely resect stage IB ( &gt; = 4 cm ) -IIIA EGFR mutant NSCLC ( confirm centrally ) follow complete resection standard post-operative therapy , overall within stage subgroup : IB II/IIIA . IV . To assess primary secondary objective randomize patient , regardless central confirmation EGFR mutant status . OUTLINE : Patients randomize 1 2 treatment arm . ARM I : Patients receive erlotinib hydrochloride orally ( PO ) daily ( QD ) day 1-21 . Treatment repeat every 21 day 2 year absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . ARM II : Patients receive placebo PO QD day 1-21 . Treatment repeat every 21 day 2 year absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . After completion study treatment , patient follow every 6 month 4 year yearly 6 year .</detailed_description>
