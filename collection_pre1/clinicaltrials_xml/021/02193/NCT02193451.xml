	<brief_summary>Some men develop difficulty pass urine ( void ) age . This may enlarge prostate gland ( sits round base bladder ) narrow bladder outlet ( urethra ) bladder become less able contract . Prostate surgery likely help symptom first group , second group may improvement surgery , expose risk complication surgery . Invasive urodynamics involves put tube ( catheter ) bladder via penis , another rectum , measure bladder abdominal pressure bladder fill sterile fluid . Invasive urodynamics measure bladder pressure fill voiding , bladder outlet obstruction pressure . The procedure consider safe , men find uncomfortable undignified , develop urine infection afterwards . We think could useful select men surgery . However , study conduct far tell u true : UPSTREAM design find invasive test worthwhile . UPSTREAM randomise control trial men bothersome difficulty pass urine consider surgery symptom . The group study men continue bother difficulty pass urine , despite initial treatment drug , symptom think due bladder outlet obstruction . The men assign random either invasive urodynamic test well standard test ( `` Invasive urodynamics '' ) routine standard test ( `` Usual care '' control arm ) alone . Routine standard test include ask men complete questionnaire ( International Prostate Symptom Score ( IPSS ) ) bladder diary , carry flow rate testing , check urine infection . Some surgeon also use `` discretionary test '' PSA cancer-screening blood test . The follow men invite participate ( inclusion criterion ) ; â€¢ Men consider undergoing surgery treatment option bothersome urinary symptom Men invite participate ( exclusion criterion ) : - unable pas urine without catheter ( urinary retention ) - relevant neurological disease , stroke - undergoing treatment prostate bladder cancer - previously prostate surgery - medically fit surgery , unable complete outcome assessment - consent assign random one pathways We compare two method investigation find whether men similar relief symptom , measure change prostate symptom score ( IPSS ) two group 18 month randomisation . We also look follow secondary outcome : - Whether invasive test change decision surgery men ( many men surgery two group ? ) - The cost-effectiveness two management pathway - Adverse effect ( ) test ( b ) treatments 6 , 12 &amp; 18 month ( e.g . urinary infection , urinary retention ) - Urinary symptom 6 , 12 &amp; 18 month , use International Consultation Incontinence Questionnaires ( ICIQ ) Male Lower Urinary Tract Symptoms questionnaire ( ICIQ-MLUTS ) - Quality life , use ICIQ-QoL questionnaire - Sexual function , use ICIQ-MLUTS sex questionnaire - Satisfaction urodynamic testing , use ICIQ-UDS-S questionnaire - The maximum urinary flow rate ( Qmax ) 18 month - Health outcome , use EQ-5D-5L questionnaire</brief_summary>
