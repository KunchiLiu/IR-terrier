	<brief_title>A Phase 2 Open Label Partially Randomized Trial Evaluate Efficacy , Safety Tolerability Combinations Bedaquiline , Moxifloxacin , PA-824 Pyrazinamide Adult Subjects With Drug-Sensitive Multi Drug-Resistant Pulmonary Tuberculosis .</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The trial design phase 2 , multi-center , open-label , partially randomize clinical trial four parallel treatment group . Subjects drug-sensitive tuberculosis ( DS-TB ) randomize receive either J ( load dose/three time week ) PaZ ; J ( 200mg ) PaZ ; HRZE . Subjects multi drug-resistant tuberculosis receive J ( 200mg ) MPaZ . The HRZE treatment arm include control drug-sensitive treatment control quantitative laboratory mycobacteriology test . A total approximately 240 male female , newly diagnose subject drug-sensitive multi drug-resistant , smear positive pulmonary tuberculosis age 18 75 year ( inclusive ) include study . A total 180 subject drug-sensitive tuberculosis ( 60 per treatment arm ) randomize . Up 60 subject multi-drug resistant tuberculosis assign . All subject maximum 9 day screen , receive 8 week treatment , follow-up visit 2 12 week study treatment completion last dose investigational medicinal product case early withdrawal . Subjects withdraw study receive &lt; 14 day investigational medicinal product , attend follow-up visit 2 week last dose investigational medicinal product . Upon treatment completion , subject drug-sensitive tuberculosis provide sufficient dos standard care tuberculosis treatment , appropriate , cover time period attend last visit study clinic schedule visit TB clinic . All subject drug sensitive multi-drug resistant tuberculosis refer local community tuberculosis clinic standard anti-tuberculosis chemotherapy accord National Tuberculosis Guidelines .</detailed_description>
