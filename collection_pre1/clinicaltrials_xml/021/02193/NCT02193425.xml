	<brief_summary>Background : - Magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) use investigate brain function . Researchers want use MRI well understand function pattern connection brain region healthy people . This might help people brain diseases future . Objectives : - To evaluate MRI method perform twice day . - To evaluate brain function use positron emission tomography ( PET ) . Eligibility : - Healthy volunteer least 18 year old . Design : - Visit 1 : - Participants screen medical history , physical exam , interview drug alcohol use psychiatric history . - They give blood urine sample . Their breath test alcohol smoking . - Visit 2 : - Participants urine collect . They MRI scan , rest , task computer . - The MRI scanner metal cylinder strong magnetic field . Participants lie table slide cylinder , coil head . Participants get earplugs loud noise . - Visit 3 : - Participants urine collect . - A needle guide thin plastic tube ( catheter ) arm . The needle remove , leave catheter vein . - Participants PET scan . They get chemical 18FDG catheter . They lie bed slide PET scanner , cap head . - Participants may test memory , attention , concentration , think . They may complete interview , questionnaire , test paper computer , simple action . - Participants wear device 1 week visit measure activity sleep .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Objectives : The overarch goal study quantify reproducibility multiple measure brain functional connectivity ( FC ) rest condition task performance . Secondary objective assess dynamic property energy requirement human brain connectome well effect physiologic noise , gender age measure brain functional connectivity rest task performance . Study population : 60 healthy male 60 female 18 year old include . Design : Participants undergo two MRI/MRS session evaluate test-retest reliability FC rest well task performance , one 18F-Fluorodeoxyglucose ( FDG ) -PET session ass association FC glucose metabolism human brain . Outcome parameter : The variability gender age effect FC measure ( lFCD , L , C , S ) collect RS TS condition , quantify use volxelwise ICC . The variability brain metabolite concentration precuneus .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>INCLUSION CRITERIA : All Participants : 1 . Older 18 year age . 2 . Ability provide write informed consent determine physical examination verbal communication . Capacity consent determine give informed consent EXCLUSION CRITERIA : 1 . Pregnant breast feeding . Females childbearing potential must negative urine pregnancy test currently breastfeed . Postmenopausal surgically sterile ( tubal ligation hysterectomy ) females satisfy criterion . 2 . Use , past two week , psychoactive medication ( four week fluoxetine ) medication affect brain function ( include limit meperidine , tricyclic antidpressants , selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor ( SSRIs ) , serotonin norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor ( SNRIs ) determine history clinical exam . 3 . Current past DSMIV DSM5 diagnosis psychiatric disorder determine history clinical exam include substance use disorder ( except nicotine/caffeine ) , alcoholism alcohol dependence . Those binge drink history last 10 year also exclude . Past history mental disorder define DSMIV DSM5 exclude require hospitalization ( length ) , chronic medication management ( 4 week ) , could impact brain function time study . Binge drinker female consume 4 drink male 5 drink one occasion least month . 4 . Major medical problem impact brain function time scan ( include limit HIV ; central nervous system include seizure psychosis ; cardiovascular include hypertension arrhythmia ; metabolic , autoimmune , endocrine ) determine history clinical exam . 5 . Any clinically significant laboratory find determine screening procedure . 6 . Have previous radiation exposure ( Xrays , PET scan , exposure ) , exposure study , would exceed NIH annual research limit . 7 . Head trauma loss consciousness 30 minute . 8 . Presence ferromagnetic object body contraindicate MRI/MRS head ( pacemaker implant electrical device , brain stimulators , type dental implant , aneurysm clip , metallic prosthesis , permanent eyeliner , implanted delivery pump , shrapnel fragment ) , fear enclose space , standard contraindication MRI/MRS ( selfreport checklist ) . 9 . Can lie comfortably flat back 2 hour PET MRI/MRS scanner . 10 . Body weight &gt; 250 kg . This upper limit bed MR scanner accommodate . 11 . NIH employee study investigator , well superior , subordinate immediate family member ( adult child , spouse , parent , sibling ) . Subjects exclude enrollment onto study urine test positive drug . However , test positive schedule study procedure day involve study imaging ( MRI/MRS PET ) Neuropsychological testing , procedure postpone reschedule . We allow 3 reschedule study day result positive urine drug screen . If drug test positive third reschedule visit , participant withdrawn study .</criteria>
