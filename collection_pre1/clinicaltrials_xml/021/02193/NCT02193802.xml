	<brief_title>Role Capsule Endoscopy Evaluation Mucosal Changes During Treatment Patients With Active Crohn 's Disease</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Crohn 's disease chronic , inflammatory disorder affect part gastrointestinal tract terminal ileum frequent location involve alone combination location . While one half patient involvement ileum large bowel , another third disease limit small bowel . The disease affect population around globe occur age tend peak incidence age 15 35 . Typical presenting symptom include abdominal pain diarrhea . The clinical presentation Crohn 's disease fluctuate throughout course disease . Symptoms sign usually correlate mucosal inflammation . The pattern Crohn 's disease view endoscopy characterize associated number mucosal characteristic erythema , swell , nodularity , stricture , aphthoid ulceration ulcer variable size depth . The utility capsule endoscopy diagnose small bowel ( SB ) Crohn 's disease demonstrate number study . Diagnostic yield 70 % report suspected SB Crohn 's disease . In patient know Crohn 's disease , superiority capsule detect mucosal lesion SB comparison radiologic technique also clearly demonstrate . A number study indicate mucosal heal good predictor long term remission . In particular , intense therapeutic regimen include purine analogue biologic therapy like infliximab associate endoscopic mucosal heal . The recently publish SONIC trial evaluate efficacy infliximab monotherapy , azathioprine monotherapy two drug combine moderate severe Crohn 's disease patient . Patients treat infliximab monotherapy combination therapy significantly longer corticosteroid-free clinical remission receive azathioprine alone . Furthermore , mucosal healing , define absence mucosal ulceration week 26 , great combination therapy monotherapies alone . Based result study , obtain mucosal heal becomes clinical practice new therapeutic objective especially patient treated immunosuppressor anti-TNF-alpha antibody . In study , complete mucosal heal assess complete disappearance ulceration . An endoscopic response could evaluate variation several endoscopic score severity , either dedicate terminal ileon ( TI ) colon i.e . Crohn 's disease endoscopic severity index ( CDEIS ) SB i.e . Lewis score . Concerning evaluation mucosal lesion SB capsule , new index severity develop study conduct different center GETAID i.e . CE-CDEIS . This score available first semester 2013 would usable present study . Unfortunately , assessment mucosal heal conventional ileocolonoscopy complete since allow exploration small bowel beyond TI . Thus , mucosal change symptomatic improvement subject SB Crohn 's disease ( without colonic involvement ) infer study like ACCENT I , direct evidence heal majority small bowel lack . In addition , correlation evidence mucosal heal symptom , measure Crohn 's Disease Activity Index ( CDAI ) , find reliable . This may reflect limitation view full extent small bowel ulceration limit examination possible ileocolonoscopy . This may potentially overcome use capsule endoscopy small bowel . Until , study evaluate potential treatment-induced change mucosal lesion locate SB capsule comparison capsule ileocolonoscopy conduct evaluation TI segment analyzable technique . For patient , demonstrate capsule usable evaluate mucosal healing , would considerable benefit know capsule necessitate arduous bowel cleanse sedation general anesthesia . The propose study design pilot study evaluate role capsule endoscopy Crohn 's disease patient , monitor change terminal ileum small bowel mucosa Crohn 's disease treatment induction remission active Crohn 's disease ileal involvement . Success trial may lead large trial validate finding .</detailed_description>
