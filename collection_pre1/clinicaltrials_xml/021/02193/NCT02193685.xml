	<brief_summary>To identify demographic , clinical , genetic , immunologic and/or microbial ( i.e. , fecal stream characterization ) risk factor influence likelihood development HAEC phenotype child carry diagnosis HD . The newly form HAEC Collaborative Research Group ( HCRG ) utilize 4 participate center current consortium recruit additional center enroll child diagnose Hirschsprung disease . 1a : To recruit 200 patient Hirschsprung disease without HAEC . 1b : To recruit 200 patient Hirschsprung disease HAEC use standardize diagnostic criterion collaborate participate member HAEC Collaborative Research Group [ 1 ] . 1c : To collect clinical demographic information well-characterized HD patient without HAEC . 1d : To collect sample blood DNA genome wide association study ( GWAS ) high throughput SNP technology mutational analysis know HSCR gene . 1e : To collect serum sample time recruitment subset cohort ( n=50 HD , n=50 HD + HAEC ) serological immune marker know inflammatory bowel disease ( IBD ) include ANCA , ASCA , OMPC , I2 , CBir1 newly identify marker . 1f : To collect store fresh fecal specimen future evaluation molecular methodology determine relative proportion enteric microflora subset cohort ( n=50 HD , n=50 HD + HAEC ) child ( &lt; 18 year ) . 1g : To establish Centralized Data Coordinating Center data collection , data quality detail data analysis ( CSMC ) tissue bank ( CSMC ) facilitate specimen analysis study . The HAEC risk factor identification complete multivariate logistic regression analysis . Genetic association study SNP GWAS together potential risk factor . Further analysis carry evaluate multiple SNPs/genes simultaneously .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Emerging data suggests distinct phenotype HAEC child HD may result complex interplay host genetics , immune response environmental trigger . Data suggest approximately 20-30 percent patient HD develop HAEC . Thus , well-designed , multi-disciplinary investigation genetic , immune microbial etiology HAEC , sufficient power detect difference disease phenotype critically need . The Hirschsprung Disease clinical phenotype HAEC : Hirschsprung disease ( HD ; also know congenital aganglionic megacolon ) affect 1 5000 live birth [ 2 ] . Surgical repair ( excision aganglionic colon pull normally ganglionated intestine anal canal ) typically perform infant HD first month life [ 3 , 4 ] . A subgroup child HD also develop Hirschsprung associate enterocolitis ( HAEC ) , potentially severe infection small bowel colon [ 5 ] . Children develop HAEC present fever , abdominal distention , explosive diarrhea , vomit , lethargy , diagnose treat promptly , lead life threaten sepsis death . HAEC may occur pre- post-surgery HD patient . There widely vary report HAEC incidence range 15-50 % pre-surgery 2-30 % post-surgery . A lack clear definition HAEC criterion least partially responsible significant variation report incidence [ 6 , 7 ] . A standardized definition HAEC recently develop publish 2009 [ 1 ] . The HAEC score consist important clinical diagnostic criterion HAEC identify group international expert use Delphi method . Preliminary validation case scenario achieve HAEC score use standardize reproducible outcome measure future study child Hirschsprung disease . Now possible perform rigorous study genetic , immune , microbial difference HD patient develop HAEC compare child HD develop HAEC . Genetic variation : Currently 10 different gene identify ( RET , GDNF , NTN , EDNRB , ET3 , ECE-1 , SOX10 , ZFHX1B , PHOX2B , NGR1 ) individual affect either isolated syndromic Hirschsprung disease . The RET gene play critical role ENS development mutation RET gene find 7-35 % sporadic case approximately 50 % familial case . EDNRB ET3 account approximately 5 % patient HD also responsible Shah-Waardenberg Syndrome . Mutations remain 7 gene find small number isolate syndromic HD patient [ 8 ] . The RET tyrosine kinase signal pathway play major role ENS migration , along ligand GDNF NTN . The EDNRB G-protein couple receptor together ligand ET3 endothelin cleavage enzyme ECE-1 form separate signal pathway important ENS development . The RET EDNRB signal pathway appear interact additive effect yet describe mechanism . PHOX2B transcriptional regulator RET gene SOX10 appear transcriptional regulator RET EDNRB gene . The complex regulation gene pathway , combine cross-signaling pathway effect ENS migration subject ongoing investigation [ 8 , 9 ] . Current think HD patient single mutation sufficient cause HD , many patient likely weak mutation multiple HD susceptibility gene together sufficient cause HD [ 8 , 9 ] . While intense study genetics HD many year , attention give possible genetic etiology HAEC . To date , influence genotype HAEC phenotype receive little attention , thereby provide additional merit proposal . Immune marker HAEC phenotype : One hypothesis HAEC may result differ immune response microbial antigen HD patient find patient inflammatory bowel disease . Antibodies E. coli outer-membrane porin C ( OmpC ) , Pseudomonas fluorescens CD related protein ( I2 ) , anti CBiR1 ( anti-flagellin ) , well Saccaromyces cerevisiae ( ASCA ) autoantigens , perinuclear anti-neutrophil antibody ( pANCA ) know elevated patient diagnose Crohn Disease ( CD ) ulcerative colitis ( UC ) . Established pattern elevation antibody serve important tool establish diagnosis IBD , well distinguish patient UC CD . By contrast , HAEC relatively poorly study intestinal inflammatory disorder child clinical feature similar pediatric IBD . At present little attention give explore similarity immune response HAEC patient IBD patient . Our aim measure panel antibody routinely use IBD patient , compare HD patient without HAEC . One antibody level may serve biomarker HD patient risk develop HAEC . Microbial factor : Data suggest alter gut microbial population may partially responsible development HAEC susceptible HD patient . Most study focus Clostridium difficile , two group report increased frequency C. diff . toxin positive stool HD patient HAEC compare without HAEC . [ 10 , 11 ] Other group subsequently report low frequency C. diff . toxin positivity patient HAEC , thereby call question role C. diff . play pathogenesis HAEC . [ 12 ] Other investigator find E. coli , C. diff . Cryptosporidium adherent enterocytes histological examination colon biopsy patient HAEC . [ 5 ] These finding indicate breech protective mucus gel layer cover luminal surface colon , lead invasion epithelial barrier . Taken together , study suggest intestine-microbial interaction may important pathogenesis HAEC . Moreover , study intestine-microbial interaction lead development HAEC might best undertaken pediatric patient whereby influence host fecal microbial constituent easily elucidate . Therefore , research must fail identify critically important pathogen narrow focus know pathogen reside colonic fecal stream genetically susceptible host . In addition , characterization gut microflora ( i.e. , fecal stream ) risk assessment child HD optimally do careful evaluation component - host microbe index case . Successfully confirm disprove infectious hypothesis require valid diagnostic tool employ . Systematic investigation potential infectious etiology normal enteric flora trigger HAEC , therefore appear biologically plausible , highly justified . University Michigan conduct metabolomics anaylsis stool child Hirschsprung Disease . The analysis focus fatty acid metabolize bacteria yeast colon . The technique use GC-MASS SPEC approach evaluate pro-inflammatory vs. anti-inflammatory fatty acid stool child without Hirschsprung Associated Enterocolitis .</detailed_description>
