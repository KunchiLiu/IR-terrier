	<detailed_description>This study ( TG-MV-022 ) retrospective study utilize Spectral-domain optical coherence tomography ( SD-OCT ) patient treat previously JETREA® VMA . The objective study retrospectively review characterize anatomic symptomatic change six month immediately follow treatment VMA JETREA® ( ocriplasmin ) , include incidence , time onset resolution anatomy symptom . The retrospective study collect Heidelberg Spectralis® SD-OCT image mask uploaded Central Reading Center ( CRC ) review analysis . The CRC evaluate anatomic endpoint interest baseline optical coherence tomography ( OCT ) image follow-up OCT scan 6 month follow period . Endpoints interest include ellipsoid zone disruption , development subretinal fluid , resolution VMA macular hole change . Further , train clinical personnel participate center transcribe data patient ' record , enter study database .</detailed_description>
