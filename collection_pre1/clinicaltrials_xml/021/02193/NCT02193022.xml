	<detailed_description>Background : Visceral leishmaniasis also know kala-azar neglected tropical disease affect poor poor live rural area Bangladesh , Nepal , India , South Sudan , Sudan Brazil annual incidence 500,000 new case 10 % mortality . Since 2008 , first oral drug Miltefosine ( MF ) introduce treatment VL Bangladesh , India Nepal part National VL / Kala-azar ( KA ) Elimination Program ( NKEP ) three country . The duration treatment 28 day dose 100 mg / day 50 mg / day adult body weight ≥25 KG &lt; 25 Kg respectively . For child , ≤ 2 mg/Kg/24h . The efficacy MF VL 87 % , observe 15 % develop Post-kala-azar Dermal ( PKDL ) Leishmaniasis annual incidence 300 case , mostly Mymensingh district Bangladesh ( VL endemic district country ) . The clinical manifestation PKDL macular/papular/nodular /mixed lesion . Children adolescents PKDL otherwise clinically healthy , patient continue carry parasite year transmit parasites others sand fly bite . In way patient play role inter-epidemic reservoir initiate new outbreak VL community . The current treatment option 120 injection SSG ( one injection per day 20 consecutive day month 6 month ) . Injections painful associated risk include sudden heart failure cardiac arrhythmia death . Therefore , PKDL patient usually seek treatment compliance low , take treatment SSG . Thus , safe effective treatment ensure good compliance urgently need . Recent study India show 12 week treatment MF adult PKDL patient effective ( 94 % ) safe . However , study report 24 adult PKDL case . Similar result observe adult PKDL patient Nepal . There information safety efficacy 12 week MF treatment child PKDL pharmacokinetics MF among child . It establish exposure MF VL child less oral MF conventional dose 2.5mg/Kg/day , thus allometric dose MF recommend expert . A study therefore urgently need efficacy safety allometric daily dose MF 12 week treatment PKDL child . Risk factor PKDL poorly investigate . Younger age VL patient genetic susceptibility PKDL find contribute PKDL . Exposure arsenic drinking water protein-energy malnutrition public health problem Bangladesh . Both arsenic vitamin E nutrient deficiency may contribute PKDL directly combination , inhibit innate adaptive immunity infection . Hypothesis ( e ) Aims : 1 . Oral treatment Miltefosine child PKDL allometric daily dose 12 week safe cure rate ≥95 % ; 2 . Development PKDL child adolescent genetically predispose associate IL-10 &amp; IFN-gamma gene polymorphism cause high serum level IL-10 low serum level IFN-gamma ; 3 . Nutritional &amp; environmental factor low serum vitamin E &amp; arsenic exposure associate PKDL . Study design : The study include cross sectional survey suspect PKDL patient among child treat VL past , follow open clinical trial MF 12 month follow treatment simultaneous case-control study PKDL risk factor . Parasitologically confirm ( demonstration parasite skin specimen microscopy / qPCR ) PKDL child subject open clinical trial oral Miltefosine ( MF ) allometric daily dose . In case-control component study , confirm PKDL child case . Children treat VL past currently without skin lesion control match case geographic area , age , sex time VL treatment . Inclusion criterion : child treat VL past , age 2 year old less 18 year old , either sex , fulfill case definition PKDL case / control , parent / guardian consent participation child study . Exclusion criterion : fulfill inclusion criterion case/control , skin fungal infection / leprosy , without clinical evidence arsenic dermatosis , negative rK39 rapid test , control child develop PKDL follow . Based expect 95 % cure rate , sample size 73 PKDL child would produce two-sided 95 % confidence interval estimate precision 5 % . Allowing attrition rate 10 % , final sample size 80 child group total sample size 160 . Blood , urine hair specimen collect case treatment 12 month follow , control baseline . Primary outcome safety cure rate 12 week treatment MF . Cure define resolution skin lesion ≥90 % skin blood specimen negative LD body leishmania DNA 12 month treatment . Safety measure frequency adverse event ( AEs ) . We expect transient AEs like vomit diarrhea le 30 % serious adverse event none . Potential Impact : If 12 week treatment MF allometric daily dose find safe effective treatment child PKDL , scale National VL Elimination Program . Through case-control component , may find nutritional / environmental risk factor PKDL help design preventative strategy PKDL .</detailed_description>
