	<brief_title>Pazopanib Molecularly Selected Patients With Advanced NSCLC</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>There limited benefit anti-angiogenesis drug patient NSCLC . Bevacizumab provide modest survival improvement add chemotherapy VEGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitor associate minimal efficacy single agent increase toxicity combine chemotherapy . We postulate response rate survival may improve good selection patient base abnormality target drug . According preliminary data cancer genome atlas ( TCGA ) , target pazopanib alter 28 % patient adenocarcinoma 24 % patient squamous cell lung cancer . Since , despite molecular selection prior treatment , small percentage patient benefit treatment , plan investigate patient whole exome sequence pre-treatment sample identify predictor response time progression , repeat biopsy , attempt identify predictor secondary resistance . By identify reliable predictor response pazopanib , study may help establish role treatment NSCLC .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Histologically confirm diagnosis advance ( metastatic unresectable ) nonsmall cell lung cancer ( NSCLC ) mutation , rearrangement fusion involve RET oncogene , abnormality pazopanib target gene define VEGFR13 , PDGFRA , PDGFRB , TP53 abnormalities include deletion , insertion , early stop codon , and/or nonsynonymous mutation functional consequence . Evaluable disease image physical exam OR measurable disease define least one lesion accurately measure least one dimension ( long diameter record ) ≥ 10 mm CT scan , ≥ 20 mm chest xray , ≥ 10 mm caliper clinical exam . Failed least one standard chemotherapeutic treatment NSCLC . At least 18 year age . ECOG performance status ≤ 2 Normal bone marrow organ function define : Absolute neutrophil count ≥ 1,500/mcl Platelets ≥ 100,000/mcl Hemoglobin ≥ 9.0 g/dL PT INR ≤ 1.2 x IULN aPTT ≤ 1.2 x IULN Total bilirubin ≤ 1.5 x IULN AST ( SGOT ) /ALT ( SGPT ) ≤ 2.5 x IULN Creatinine ≤ 1.5 mg/dL OR creatinine clearance ≥ 30 mL/min/1.73 m2 patient creatinine level 1.5 mg/dL UPC &lt; 1 , UPC ≥ 1 , 24hour urine protein &lt; 1 g ; use urine dipstick renal function assessment acceptable . Notes : Subjects may transfusion within 7 day screen assessment . Concomitant elevation bilirubin AST/ALT IULN allow . Patients receive anticoagulation therapy eligible INR stable within recommended range desire level anticoagulation . Ability swallow retain oral tablet . Women childbearing potential men must agree use adequate contraception ( hormonal barrier method birth control , abstinence ) prior study entry duration study participation . Should woman become pregnant suspect pregnant participating study , must inform treat physician immediately . Ability understand willingness sign IRB approve write informed consent document . Treatment follow anticancer therapy : Radiation therapy , surgery , tumor embolization within 14 day prior first dose pazopanib OR Chemotherapy , immunotherapy , investigational therapy hormonal therapy within 14 day prior first dose pazopanib Prior treatment VEGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitor . Administration nononcologic investigational drug within 30 day 5 halflives ( whichever longer ) prior first dose pazopanib . Use strong CYP3A4 inhibitor le 14 day prior initiation study treatment A history malignancy ≤ 5 year previous exception basal cell squamous cell carcinoma skin treat local resection carcinoma situ cervix . Symptomatic brain metastasis . Patients know brain metastasis allow asymptomatic . A history allergic reaction attribute compound similar chemical biologic composition pazopanib agent use study . Any ongoing toxicity prior anticancer therapy &gt; grade 1 and/or progress severity ( except alopecia ) . Any IO related adverse event must ≤ grade 1 eligible . Uncontrolled intercurrent illness include , limited , ongoing active infection , uncontrolled seizure disorder , chronic underlie liver disease unrelated cancer , psychiatric illness/social situation would limit compliance study requirement . Corrected QT interval ( QTc ) &gt; 480 msec . History one follow cardiovascular condition within past 6 month : cardiac angioplasty stenting , myocardial infarction , unstable angina pectoris , coronary artery bypass graft surgery , symptomatic peripheral vascular disease , class III IV congestive heart failure define New York Heart Association ( see Appendix B ) . Poorly control hypertension ( define systolic blood pressure ≥ 140 mmHg diastolic blood pressure ≥ 90 mmHg ) . Note : initiation adjustment antihypertensive medication ( ) permit prior study entry . Following antihypertensive medication initiation adjustment , blood pressure must reassess three time approximately 2minute interval . At least 24 hour must elapse antihypertensive medication initiation adjustment blood pressure measurement . These three value average obtain mean diastolic systolic blood pressure , must &lt; 140/90 mmHg order patient eligible study . Clinically significant gastrointestinal abnormality may increase risk gastrointestinal bleeding , include ( limited ) active peptic ulcer disease , know intraluminal metastatic lesion risk bleeding , inflammatory bowel disease ( e.g. , ulcerative colitis , Crohn 's disease ) GI condition increase risk perforation , history abdominal fistula intraabdominal abscess within 28 day prior begin study treatment . Clinically significant gastrointestinal abnormality may affect absorption pazopanib , include ( limited ) malabsorption syndrome major resection stomach small bowel . History cerebrovascular accident include transient ischemic attack , pulmonary embolism ( include asymptomatic previously treat PE ) , untreated deep venous thrombosis within past 6 month . Patients recent DVT treat therapeutic anticoagulating agent least 6 week eligible . Major surgery trauma within 28 day prior first dose pazopanib and/or presence nonhealing wound , fracture , ulcer ( procedure catheter placement consider major surgery ) . Evidence active bleeding bleed diathesis . Known endobronchial lesion and/or lesion infiltrate major pulmonary vessel increase risk pulmonary hemorrhage . Note : lesion infiltrate major pulmonary vessel ( contiguous tumor vessel ) exclude ; however , presence tumor touch infiltrating ( abut ) vessel acceptable ( CT contrast strongly recommend evaluate lesion ) . Large protrude endobronchial lesion mail lobar bronchus exclude ; however , endobronchial lesion segment bronchus allow . Lesions extensively infiltrate main lobar bronchus exclude ; however , minor infiltration wall thee bronchus allow . Recent hemoptysis ( ≥ ½ teaspoon red blood within 8 week first dose pazopanib ) . Pregnant and/or breastfeeding . Patient must negative serum pregnancy test within 14 day study entry . Known HIVpositivity . Appropriate study undertake patient receive combination antiretroviral therapy indicate .</criteria>
