	<brief_title>A Phase I Single Ascending Dose Study Intravitreal Plasma Kallikrein Inhibitor KVD001 Subjects With DME</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The plasma kallikrein-kinin system long recognize key player inflammatory process , capillary leakage angiogenesis various organ . Recent work suggest plasma kallikrein central pathogenesis Diabetic Macular Edema ( DME ) activation enzyme contribute excessive retinal vascular permeability lead DME . Among different person DME , plasma kallikrein contribute independently , association Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor ( VEGF ) others . However , effect plasma kallikrein appear independent VEGF . Thus , grow scientific evidence point plasma kallikrein inhibitor excite potential new therapeutic opportunity direct novel VEGF-independent pathway may reduce retinal vascular permeability treat DME , patient whose disease process , least part , drive plasma kallikrein pathway . This open label , single ascend dose study investigate safety , tolerability pharmacodynamics novel plasma kallikrein inhibitor administer intravitreal ( IVT ) injection subject central involve diabetic macular edema reduce vision .</detailed_description>
