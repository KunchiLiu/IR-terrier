	<detailed_description>This study intend examine three different OMM technique , sub-occipital release , rib-raising , stellate ganglion release , impact autonomic nervous system tone . Subjects randomly assign one four cohort group , receive either sub-occipital release , rib-raising , stellate ganglion release three treatment technique . A shift towards sympathetic tone induce subject use tilted-to-seated-position test ( Tilt-Seated Position test ) cognitive challenge test , consist computerized question become progressively difficult , subject ask answer quickly accurately possible . These stress test induce twice , without OMM treatment second time designate OMM treatment ( ) . The sympathetic-dependent response orthostatic change cognitive challenge determine Fourier analysis heart rate variability , record use EKG attach subject .</detailed_description>
