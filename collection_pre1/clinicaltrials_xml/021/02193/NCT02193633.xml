	<brief_summary>This Phase I study evaluate safety toxicity profile AZD2014 , novel anticancer agent , combination paclitaxel . AZD2014 give orally , twice daily start dose 25 mg per day 3 day , 4 day weekly infusion 80 mg paclitaxel 6 week follow treatment break one week , therefore cycle 7 week long . Cohorts three patient treat dose AZD2014 50mg 75 mg provide safe . Once determined maximum tolerate dose ( MTD ) use 3 day , 4 day schedule AZD2014 , patient give AZD2014 2 day , 5 day paclitaxel infusion . Patients enrol cohort three evaluate three escalate dos AZD2014 determine MTD 2 day , 5 day schedule . On completion dose escalation phase study patient ovarian cancer squamous cell lung cancer treat MTD establish dose schedule . A minimum 10 ovarian cancer patient 15 squamous cell lung patient enrol 3 day , 4 day schedule . Whilst minimum 10 squamous cell cancer patient enrol 2 day , 5 day schedule assess tolerability combination AZD2014 paclitaxel .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Phase I Trial Combination AZD2014 Weekly Paclitaxel .</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This multi-centre , Phase I clinical trial combination AZD2014 weekly paclitaxel . Two intermittent BD dosing schedule AZD2014 combination paclitaxel evaluate . The 3 day 4 day schedule examine 3 continuous day AZD2014 per week combination weekly paclitaxel . The 2 day 5 day schedule examine 2 sequential day AZD2014 dose combination weekly paclitaxel . For schedule , dose escalation 3+3 design use establish MTD recommend Phase II dose . Approximately 15 patient solid tumour enter schedule dose escalation phase . The expansion part trial use assess tolerability AZD2014 combination weekly paclitaxel . For 3 day 4 day schedule 10 patient ovarian cancer 15 patient squamous lung cancer enrol treat MTD establish dose escalation phase . Accrual expansion arm may commence soon MTD determine proceed parallel dose escalation phase 2 day 5 day schedule . Once MTD determine 2 day 5 day schedule 15 patient squamous lung cancer may enrol . Determination MTD decision enter expansion phase schedule make Safety Review Committee ( SRC ) take consideration safety data available PK/PD data .</detailed_description>
