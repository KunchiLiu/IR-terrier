	<brief_summary>The study aim evaluate evidence-based practice behavior usual care physical therapy Flanders . Secondly , aim compare effectiveness predefined physical therapy program base evidence-based guideline effect period usual care . It hypothesize support therapist provide predefined evidence-based intervention program , result improve treatment outcome compare usual care physical therapy .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Evidence-based Physical Therapy Children With Cerebral Palsy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Participants A convenience sample 16 child recruit Cerebral Reference Centre University Hospital Pellenberg . Children include diagnosed bilateral spastic CP , age 4 9 year Gross Motor Function level I III . Children exclude receive Botulinum Toxin A injection within past six month , orthopedic surgery past severe associate problem limited participation therapy ( blindness , deafness , severe cognitive limitation autism ) . Design All child start study registration period . During period , child 's usual physical therapy ( UC ) register use diary . Immediately follow UC period , child enrol predefined intervention program ( IP ) . Both period UC IP duration 10 week . Before period , child evaluate use Gross Motor Function Measurement ( GMFM-88 ) three-dimensional gait analysis ( 3DGA ) . Therapy intervention During period UC , specific intervention provide . Children receive frequency , intensity content therapy usually receive private physical therapist . A diary provide child 's physical therapist . The diary contains session form , design therapist carefully register content therapy session . In session form , therapist note much time therapy session target problem different level ICF . At level body structure function , time spent muscle length muscle strength register . For muscle length , therapist ask report target muscle , number repetition , duration stretch treatment modality ( activo , activopassivo passivo ) . About muscle strength , therapist note specific muscle train , intensity ( number repetition resistance ) whether exercise perform analytical ( single-joint ) functional ( multiple-joint ) muscle work . Concerning activity level , specific functional activity practice average position perform , register . Finally , therapist ask report whether problem participation level specifically address . During period UC , therapist contact instruction advice provide regard physical therapy treatment child . Intervention period Immediately follow UC period , child enrol predefined intervention program ( IP ) , design first third author study . The program execute child 's personal physical therapist , agree precisely follow prescribe program . Similar UC program , child receive frequency therapy usually receive private physical therapist . Two different type program design . Ten child receive individually define , target program tailor individual need child six child receive general program base general age-appropriate treatment aim child bilateral spastic CP . For extensive description difference similarity type intervention program , author refer previous intervention study . All intervention program two major common feature . The first central common aspect intervention program basic principle regard evidence-based training respect . All program consist predefined set exercise improve strength , selectivity mobility set functional exercise . Thereby , stretch prescribe three repetition 30 second strength training prescribed series three time 12 15 repetition . Functional exercise restrict specific repetition number . As appropriate , intervention program contain 50 % exercise activity participation level . The second major common feature intervention program support follow-up therapist . At start intervention study , therapist visit prescribed program thoroughly explain . All exercise provide clear structured way , specific instruction regard anatomical position , sets repetition . The specific exercise discuss demonstrated necessary . During second third week , therapist contact phone email discus progress program possible need change adjust exercise . Additionally , follow-up visit organize around halfway program . During visit , program discuss therapist perform regular therapy session use program , attendance first author study . Difficulties performance discuss necessary , exercise demonstrate . The opportunity feedback handle position thereby provide . Due common aspect program , previous data analysis reveal overall effect program find significantly different , test hypothesis regard influence evidence-based support pool data-set .</detailed_description>
