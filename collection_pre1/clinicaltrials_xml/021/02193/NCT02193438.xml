	<brief_summary>Human study show capsaicin , compound extract chilly pepper , stimulate certain physiologic function ( example , energy expenditure , thermogenesis , lipid oxidation , heart rate , etc. ) . The purpose study measure impact ingest various spicy molecule set physiologic parameter compare placebo . The molecule select different sensory property . The result study allow u implement effective method measure impact ingest spice certain body function ( example , metabolism autonomic nervous system activity ) . This study also allow u identify beneficial property eat certain spice .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Primary objective outcome : The main objective study establish methodology evaluate acute impact spice ingestion metabolism autonomic nervous system activity . Primary outcome : Impact spice autonomic nervous system activity : Power spectra analysis heart rate variability ( HRV ) change 90 post ingestive minute ( measure ECG ) . Impact spice metabolism : Energy expenditure change 90 post ingestive minute ( measure indirect calorimetry ) . As secondary outcome blood pressure change facial temperature change specific area ( nose , cheeks forehead ) evaluate . Substrate oxidation ( carbohydrates fat utilization ) respiratory quotient ( RQ ) calculate use indirect calorimetry data energy expenditure measure .</detailed_description>
