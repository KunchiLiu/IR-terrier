	<brief_title>A Pilot , Exploratory , Non-Randomized Study PET/CT With Investigational Agent 18F Fluciclatide Correlate With Response Anti-Cancer Therapy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PET/CT Scans : If find eligible take part study , PET/CT scan treatment baseline visit , 1 week first cycle chemotherapy . You second PET/CT scan end first cycle chemotherapy ( 3-4 week start chemotherapy ) . For 6 hour PET/CT scan , must eat drink anything except water . A small needle tube place arm , receive injection small amount mildly radioactive material bloodstream ( investigational tracer , [ 18F ] fluciclatide ) . The radioactive nature inject material allow scanner `` see '' certain place body . After injection , need rest quietly time scan . The amount rest time may vary , prepared wait 45 90 minute . During scan , lie flat back table . The scan may last 1 hour . Each PET/CT image session last 4 hour total time arrive clinic discharge allow go home . You may discharge 30 minute scan complete , doctor think clinically stable safe leave . Study Visits : If follow test already perform part clinical research study participate part standard care , need repeat study . Baseline Visit ( first PET/CT performed ) : - You physical exam . - Blood ( 3 tablespoon ) draw routine test . - If become pregnant , urine collect pregnancy test . To take part study , must pregnant . End Cycle 1 ( second PET/CT perform ) : -Blood ( 3 tablespoon ) draw routine test . About 24 hour PET/CT perform , study staff call telephone ask health status side effect may experience . Anytime within next month second PET/CT scan , blood ( 3 tablespoon ) draw routine test . When chemotherapy , third PET/CT scan part standard care , FDG tracer use scan . Length Participation : Your study participation end 6 week second PET/CT scan perform . This investigational study . [ 18F ] Fluciclatide FDA approve commercially available . At time , use research . Up 50 patient take part research study . All enrol MD Anderson .</detailed_description>
