	<brief_title>Effect TEAS Incidence Rate SIRS Patients Undergoing Abdominal Surgery</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Patients undergo elective radical surgery gastric cancer general anesthesia randomly assign three group , control group , TEAS group sham TEAS group . TEAS group receive TEAS general anesthesia induction , 1th day 2nd day surgery . TEAS give electrode attach specific acupoints . The time TEAS 30min . Sham TEAS group receive sham TEAS general anesthesia induction , 1th day 2nd day surgery . Sham TEAS give electrode attach non-acupoints . The time sham TEAS also 30min . Control group give TEAS . Incidence rate SIRS group compare .Venous blood sample group ( control group , TEAS group sham TEAS group ) collect general anesthesia induction,1th day 3rd day surgery . Inflammatory cytokine index include interleukin-6 , interleukin-10 , Tumor Necrosis Factor- alpha ( TNF-α ) , Interferon-γ ( IFN-γ ) , Monocyte Chemotactic Protein 1 ( MCP-1 ) , IgG , IgM measure .</detailed_description>
