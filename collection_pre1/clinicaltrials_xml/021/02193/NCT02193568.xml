	<brief_summary>This randomize clinical trial study light sedation compare intubated general anesthesia ( loss feel complete loss awareness feel like deep sleep ) reduce complication length hospital stay patient brain cancer undergo craniotomy . Craniotomy operation piece skull remove doctor remove brain tumor abnormal brain tissue . Light sedation allow patient remain awake surgery , intubate general anesthesia put patient sleep . Surgery complication rate may reduce intubated general anesthesia avoid . Additionally , patient receive intubated general anesthesia tend recover quickly surgery . It yet know whether light sedation well reduce complication length hospital stay compare intubated general anesthesia .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To compare overall hospital length stay ( LOS ) patient undergo craniotomy light sedation vs. general anesthesia . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . To compare resource utilization two group . II . To assess frequency post-operative delirium . III . To measure patient perception . IV . To track patient complication hospital stay - nausea/vomiting , pain , hematology/lab stability , hemodynamic stability . V. To track re-admission extended hospital stay rate . VI . To compare cost approach . OUTLINE : Patients randomize 1 2 arm . ARM I : Patients receive light sedation ( awake ) undergo craniotomy . ARM II : Patients receive intubate general anesthesia undergo craniotomy . After completion study , patient follow 1month 1 year .</detailed_description>
