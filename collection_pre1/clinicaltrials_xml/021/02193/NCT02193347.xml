	<brief_title>IDH1 Peptide Vaccine Recurrent Grade II Glioma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>After inform consent sign , subject tetanus booster within 10 year undergo standard care vaccination 0.5 mL Td ( tetanus diphtheria toxoid adsorb ) . Within 2 week sign consent eligible subject undergo 1-2 hour leukapheresis ( pull white blood cell ) immune monitor within 48 hour vaccine site pre-conditioning perform single dose Td toxoid ( total volume 0.4 mLs salt water/saline ) give intradermal space ( surface skin ) 12-24 hour prior receive PEPIDH1M vaccine manner . The peptide vaccine administer upper thigh area approximately 4 inch groin intradermal space vaccine # 1 . Subsequent vaccine give day 15 ±3 day ( vaccine # 2 ) day 30 ±3 day ( vaccine # 3 ) . All injection alternate side . These injection occur without temozolomide ( standard care chemotherapy ) . Seven 10 day 3rd vaccine , subject peripheral blood work drawn immunologic monitoring . This follow surgery remove tumor less 3 day longer 7 day immunologic monitoring blood work . Tumor sample evaluate IDH1 marker analyze cell may enter tumor . Based tissue obtain surgery , subject stable histologic grade recurrence treat vaccine temozolomide . During monthly cycle temozolomide , subject receive vaccine day 21 ±2 day maximum 15 total vaccine ( include first 3 bi-weekly vaccine ) . Patients transition high Grade brain tumor eligible continue remove study . All Adverse Events collect time consent study . For purpose study , subject consider study 2 month last vaccine . Subjects follow survival thereafter . For immune monitoring , final peripheral blood draw perform follow 3 month temozolomide vaccine therapy . Peripheral blood also draw immune monitoring evaluation progression , possible . For biomarker testing , subject blood urine collect follow time : prior vaccine therapy ( consent leukapheresis visit ) , prior vaccine # 3 , prior surgery remove tumor , prior discharge hospital follow surgery remove tumor , prior subsequent monthly vaccine administration , progression ( possible ) . Subjects image contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) accord standard care every 2 month ±2 week temozolomide afterward , per treat neuro-oncologist 's recommendation . Revised Assessment Neuro-Oncology ( RANO ) criterion use assessment pseudoprogression tumor progression . Subjects demonstrate definitive progression remove study . As part standard care subject , upon tumor progression , participant may undergo biopsy resection . As research procedure , consent obtain separately . Subjects procedure do within Duke University Health System ask portion tumor sample , possible , assess immunologic cell infiltration , antigen expression , biomarkers immunologic response .</detailed_description>
