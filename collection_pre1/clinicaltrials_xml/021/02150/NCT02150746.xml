	<brief_summary>It hypothesize circulate tumor cell ( CTCs ) pancreatic adenocarcinoma release peritoneal cavity blood lose surgical resection tumor result peritoneal recurrence despite appropriate surgical resection . Targeting mechanisms responsible CTC adhesion peritoneum may result inhibition implantation growth , thus prevent mode pancreatic cancer recurrence postoperatively .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Research Plan : Intraoperative Subjects Pancreatic Ductal Adenocarcinoma ( PDAC ) consent enrol study take operating room ( OR ) previously plan pancreatectomy procedure . After general anesthesia induce , use universal precaution , blood sample ( 10ml ) collect heparin tube identification circulate tumor cell ( CTCs ) serve one two control design assess background CTC count . Once participant undergone surgical exploration plan deemed candidate resection , normal saline use wash abdominal cavity collect suction canister attend surgeon . Abdominal washing normal part operative procedure , typically performed end operation wash blood abdominal cavity perform variable amount depend surgeon 's discretion . For purpose control study , wash step move begin operation . Additional washes/irrigations may necessary end case surgeon 's discretion . Cells collect fluid centrifuge collect lab determination presence malignant cell . This serve second two control . As pancreatectomy procedure proceeds , subject blood lose normal consequence procedure suction operative field new container contain heparin chill ice preserve cell viability . This blood normally discard end case portion blood collect utilized downstream lab experiment detect CTCs . Laboratory/Post-Processing Blood collect operating room describe immediately brought laboratory centrifuge separate plasma , buffy coat , erythrocytes . The buffy coat , contain CTCs , white blood cell , platelet , remove add commercially available cocktail per kit protocol . Ficoll enrichment separation CTCs perform . The isolated CTCs use downstream characterization experimentation include , limited : identification CTC number , growth CTCs vitro vivo , identification/characterization CTC adhesion molecule allow bind human peritoneum . Any unused blood component blood utilized experiment assign unique identifier de-identified patient future cross-reference store -80 degree Fahrenheit University Florida potential future experiment repeat CTC isolation . Participant Data Collection On enrolled subject , follow de-identified information collect : participant demographic data , clinical pathologic data , data cancer recurrence overall survival .</detailed_description>
