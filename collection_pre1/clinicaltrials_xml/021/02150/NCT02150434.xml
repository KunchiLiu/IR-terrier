	<brief_summary>The aim current study evaluate new system ( FreeO2 ) automatically titrate oxygen flow maintain stable SpO2 , patient moderate severe chronic obstructive pulmonary disease exercise . The investigator hypothesize continuous automatic adjustment oxygen flow exercise would better maintain patient within oxygenation target , reduce episode desaturation hyperoxia would improve walk exercise tolerance comparison fix level low-flow oxygen compress air breathing .</brief_summary>
