	<brief_summary>In trial , investigator infuse donor bone marrow mesenchymal stromal cell intravenously , treatment pediatric Crohn 's disease ulcerative colitis respond conventional therapy . The goal study test safety tolerability donor mesenchymal stromal cell child Inflammatory Bowel Disease . Mesenchymal stromal cell support development blood cell within bone marrow . When isolated donor infuse animal human , demonstrate travel area inflammation , alter immune response , decrease pro-inflammatory cytokine , promote tissue repair . Infusion cell lead rejection . These property lead investigator hypothesize may may beneficial treat inflammatory bowel disease .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>In trial , investigator infuse donor bone marrow mesenchymal stromal cell intravenously , treatment pediatric Crohn 's disease ulcerative colitis respond conventional therapy . Mesenchymal stromal cell support development blood cell within bone marrow . They also demonstrate travel area inflammation , alter immune response , decrease pro-inflammatory cytokine , promote tissue repair . Infusion cell lead rejection . These property lead investigator hypothesize may may beneficial treat inflammatory bowel disease . Investigators culture donate bone marrow mesenchymal stromal cell unique automate system , infuse cell fresh , replicate stage growth . This study test safety tolerability donor mesenchymal stromal cell child Inflammatory Bowel Disease .</detailed_description>
