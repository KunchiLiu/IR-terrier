	<brief_summary>-Purpose : Phase I : To test method , data collection analysis study evaluate cognitive/affective/sleep symptom one patient undergo treatment high-dose Interleukin-2 ( IL-2 ) metastatic renal cell carcinoma ( RCC ) , informal caregiver primary nurse . Phase II : A pilot study examine 10 IL-2 case describe cognitive/affective/sleep symptom patient receive high-dose IL-2 therapy metastatic melanoma ( MM ) metastatic RCC order develop interventional study minimize symptom . -Aims : In pilot , case comprise metastatic RCC patient receive IL-2 , care partner , primary nurse . The care partner study family member friend stay IL-2 patient throughout treatment . Phase I ( Evaluation Methods Procedures ) : One case examine evaluate method , data collection analysis use study . The aims Phase I study : Aim 1 ) Evaluate recruitment enrollment procedure enroll one IL-2 case , comprise IL-2 patient , care partner primary nurse ; Aim 2 ) Evaluate administration procedure , data collect , analysis four questionnaire scale detect trajectory cognition [ Attentional Function Index Montreal Cognitive Assessment ] affect [ Hamilton Anxiety scale Inventory Depressive Symptomatology‒Clinician ] IL-2 patient start end cycle treatment ; Aim 3 ) Evaluate procedure , data collect analysis journal entry care partner record thought , observation , feeling concern change patient 's behavior cognition IL-2 treatment every 8 hour ; Aim 4 ) Evaluate procedure , data collect analysis semi-structured questionnaire complete primary nurse take care patient receive IL-2 describe change behavior cognition patient IL-2 treatment ; Aim 5 ) Evaluate procedure , data collect analysis data interview IL-2 patient discern symptom endorse measurement scale represent characterize , interview primary nurse gain additional data cognitive/affective symptom observe IL-2 patient . Phase II ( Investigating Cognitive , Affective Sleep Alterations Patients Receiving high dose IL-2 therapy ) : Up 10 additional case enrol understand cognitive , affective sleep symptom induce IL-2 therapy oncology patient MM metastatic RCC , help design future study ameliorate treatment-limiting symptom . The specific aim study : Aim 1 ) Describe cognitive ( language , concentration , mental fatigue , confusion , attention , short-term memory , orientation ) , affective ( depression , anxiety , mood alteration ) , sleep disturbance symptom patient receive 1 4 cycle ( 8-weeks ) high-dose IL-2 therapy . Aim 2 ) Examine observe patient experience cognitive/affective/sleep symptoms patient 's primary care partner , primary nurse 1 4 cycle IL-2 therapy . Aim 3 ) Describe trajectory cognitive/affective/sleep symptom patient MM metastatic RCC undergo 1 4 cycle IL-2 therapy . Not patient receive 4 cycle IL-2 , treatment depend ) disease progression b ) side effect toxicity ; therefore , symptom trajectory describe cycle complete situation cycle complete .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Interleukin-2—Induced Cognitive/Affective/Sleep Symptoms</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>-Background &amp; Significance : Alterations cognitive , affective sleep functioning among challenging side effect experience 80 % patient undergoing high dose IL-2 therapy . Altered cognition include wide array symptom change concentration , attention , short-term memory , confusion , mental fatigue , executive functioning , abstraction , language , basic arithmetic , orientation . Affective symptom include mood alteration , depression , anxiety , psychosis , hallucination , aggression , suicidal ideation , coma . Sleep symptom include insomnias ( initial , middle , delay ) hypersomnia . Severe cognitive/affective/sleep symptom may result early termination IL-2 therapy , prevent patient receive full benefit . In patient , cognitive , affective sleep symptom continue throughout remainder life , decrease quality life patient family . Although prior investigator report chemotherapy-related altered cortical cognitive function include slow processing time decrease brain activation , well sign increase cytokine decrease gray matter , study investigate trajectory immunotherapy-related altered cognition find publish literature . Describing impact IL-2 therapy cognition , affect sleep essential designing intervention ameliorate treatment-limiting symptom . Because IL-2 patient receive several dos medication number day , explore symptom trajectory analysis symptom critical . Without fully understand breadth depth IL-2—induced cognitive/affective/sleep symptom , advance science alleviate symptom standstill . Metastatic RCC MM two cancer treat IL-2 , surgery , chemotherapy radiation therapy ineffective patient stage III IV disease . For phase I pilot study , focus enrol one IL-2 patient metastatic RCC , care partner primary nurse ; many five subject comprise one case may recruit consent . In 2014 , National Cancer Institute estimate 76,000 new diagnosis 9,700 death secondary melanoma , 64,000 new case 14,000 death secondary kidney cancer . IL-2 , cytokine base immunotherapy , administer patient metastatic disease stimulate immune system fight cancerous cell , one treatment available patient progressed disease . When IL-2 administer high-dose , intravenous form , patient experience severe potentially life-threatening side effect . The long-term impact IL-2 treatment cognitive/affective symptom document . Despite severe symptom side effect , 33 % MM patient response IL-2 treatment 15 % MM patient show complete response detectable metastasis treatment . In RCC , 14 % patient show response 8 % show complete response . Thus , intervention help patient complete treatment warrant would build knowledge gain study . -Procedures : Phase I enroll case one cycle high-dose IL-2 give five day . Phase II enroll 10 additional case four cycle high-dose IL-2 therapy . High-dose IL-2 define 600,000-720,000 International Units/kilogram , administer intravenously 15 minute , every 8 hour maximum 14 consecutive dos ; 14 dos comprise one treatment cycle . Quantitative data collect use questionnaire administer IL-2 patient measure cognitive/affective/sleep symptom cycle high-dose IL-2 describe longitudinal change patient therapy course . Qualitative data collect semi-structured journal entry write care partner , semi-structured questionnaire give nurse dose IL-2 , interview IL-2 patient , care partner primary nurse . Three construct ( cognitive symptom , affective symptom , sleep symptom ) use describe IL-2—induced cognitive/affective/sleep symptom use four source data collection ( IL-2 patient , primary care partner , nurse , primary nurse ) . The index participant receive three high-dose IL-2 treatment per day , 8-hour interval , maximum 14 dos per cycle . The pattern data collection Phase I repeat maximum four IL-2 cycle Phase II . Cognitive/affective/sleep symptom experience patient evaluate use six scale . Scales administer index participant upon admission hospital receive first dose IL-2 cycle , 16-hrs last IL-2 dose cycle . The nurse care IL-2 patient contact phone constant communication time IL-2 administration therapy end . Questionnaires administer patient 's private hospital room . Although would ideal administer survey follow IL-2 dose , IL-2 patient disrupt every four hour IL-2 related care . Administering scale twice cycle reduce patient burden sufficient assess longitudinal change cognitive/affective/sleep symptom . For symptom endorse patient 16-hr post-treatment , interview IL-2 patient discern symptom represent characterize . This semi-structured interview record transcribed . The care partner ask record observation patient 's cognitive , affective sleep symptom journal entry three time per day , prior first IL-2 dose dose . The semi-structured journal entry contain checklist signify symptom observe care partner , patient pull catheter intravenous line , confusion , hallucinate , sign depression , and/or anxiety . The checklist follow prompt read , `` For box check , please describe change witness . When symptom appear ? How long symptom last ? How severe symptom ? Can describe situation ? Did anything make symptom good bad ? '' Following prompt , final open-ended prompt read , `` If change patient feel team know , please feel free write change well . '' After treatment end , care partner participate post-treatment semi-structured interview end cycle therapy . This interview record transcribed . Similar care partner , nurse participate patient 's care receive semi-structured prompt care partner . Nurses also ask write , ' I witness cognitive affective change IL-2 patient time patient ' change symptom observe . A folder contain prompt nurse keep secure place unit nurse access retrieve form contain prompt prior nursing assessment . The nurse encourage complete form IL-2 infusion . Once primary nurse IL-2 patient identify , approach s/he consent interview primary nurse gain additional data cognitive/affective/sleep symptom observe IL-2 patient . This interview record transcribed . Field note collect throughout study enrich data . Collection data multiple source interview , journal entry field note allow comprehensive understanding data .</detailed_description>
