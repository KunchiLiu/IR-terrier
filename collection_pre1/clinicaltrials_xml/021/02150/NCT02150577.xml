	<detailed_description>The objective Implementation Trial evaluate implementation evidence base practice Bipolar Disorder Treatment Resistant Depression small rural Federally Qualified Health Centers . The evidence base practice choose adapted Health Center providers patient consultation clinical expert . The evidence base practice include : screen diagnose Bipolar Disorder , prescribe one five mood stabilizer , on-line cognitive behavioral therapy ( Beating Blues ) , on-line peer support ( Depression Bipolar Support Alliance ) , collaborative care management tele-psychiatry consultation . These evidence base practice choose base strength research evidence feasibility implementation small primary clinic serve low income rural patient population . Providers may choose use , none evidence base practice patient . Patients may choose adhere , , none treatment recommendation prescribe provider . A quasi-experimental study design use . There Federally Qualified Health Centers participate Implementation Trial . Each Federally Qualified Health Center choose one implementation clinic one control clinic . Patients enrolled implementation control clinic outcome compare three month period follow enrollment . Implementation outcomes base `` RE-AIM '' framework include : reach , adoption , implementation-fidelity effectiveness . Reach represent proportion patient receive evidence base practice . Reach compile patient level . Adoption represent proportion provider deliver evidence base practice . Provider adoption compile primary care provider level . Implementation-Fidelity represent whether evidence base practice deliver intend . Implementation compile patient level . Effectiveness represent clinical improvement experience patient . Effectiveness compile patient level . Data collect chart review patient survey administer Interactive Voice Response telephone system . There three sample . The Full Sample patient screen positive depression Patient Health Questionnaire ( PHQ9 ) screen tool 9 month enrollment period . The PHQ9 use routinely screen patient depression participate clinic . The Full Sample expect include approximately 2,400 patient . The Bipolar Depression Sample patient screen positive depression , screen positive Bipolar Disorder ( CIDI ) , provide informed consent collect primary data . The Treatment Resistant Depression Sample patient screen positive depression , screen negative Bipolar Disorder , currently prescribe antidepressant , provide informed consent collect primary data . The purpose `` currently prescribe antidepressant '' inclusion criterion identify patient respond treatment . This inclusion criterion determine chart review . We expect approximately 40 patient six Federally Qualified Health Centers ( two clinic per system ) eligible Bipolar Depression Treatment Resistant Depression sample provide informed consent . Thus , combine size Bipolar Depression Treatment Resistant Depression sample expect 240 . Health Center evaluation staff test difference patient outcome implementation control sit use ordinary least square logistic regression analysis control demographic characteristic . Compared patient control sit , hypothesize patient positive depression screen implementation sit likely screen Bipolar Disorder patient control sit . With automated chart review data 2,400 patient , 84 % power detect 5 % ( e.g. , 25 % versus 20 % ) difference Bipolar Disorder screen rate . Compared patient control sit , hypothesize patient Bipolar Disorder Sample implementation site likely see receive Bipolar diagnosis , prescribe mood stabilizer , engage on-line cognitive behavioral therapy , engage on-line peer support , receive collaborative care management , tele-psychiatry consultation , experience depression symptom improvement report great satisfaction . For Bipolar Disorder Sample , plan enroll approximately 20 patient six Federally Qualified Health Centers ( two clinic per system ) expect least 75 % follow-up rate ( n=90 ) , give u 79 % power detect 25 % ( e.g. , 15 % versus 40 % ) difference Bipolar Disorder specific outcome ( e.g. , diagnose Bipolar Disorder ) . Compared patient control site , hypothesize patient Treatment Resistant Depression Sample implementation site likely antidepressant prescription change , engage on-line cognitive behavioral therapy , engage on-line peer support , receive collaborative care management , tele-psychiatry consultation , experience depression symptom improvement report great satisfaction . For Treatment Resistant Depression Sample , plan enroll approximately 20 patient six Federally Qualified Health Centers ( two clinic per system ) expect least 75 % follow-up rate ( n=90 ) , give u 79 % power detect 25 % ( e.g. , 15 % versus 40 % ) difference Treatment Resistant Depression specific outcome ( e.g. , antidepressant prescription change ) . For combined Bipolar Disorder Sample Treatment Resistant Depression Sample , plan enroll approximately 40 patient six Federally Qualified Health Centers ( two clinic per system ) expect least 75 % follow-up rate ( n=180 ) , give u 87 % power detect 15 % ( e.g. , 25 % versus 40 % ) difference trans-diagnostic outcome ( e.g. , satisfaction ) .</detailed_description>
