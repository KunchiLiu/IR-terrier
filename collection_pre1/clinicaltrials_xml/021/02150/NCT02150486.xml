	<detailed_description>Study design The MICOLON study prospective , single-centre , observational cohort study association 5th generation high sensitive cardiac troponin T level non-cardiac outcome major abdominal surgery patient risk coronary artery disease . Patient eligibility Patients eligible enter study schedule undergo elective major abdominal surgery expect postoperative mortality rate &gt; 3 % , age 45 year old least one follow major cardiac risk factor : diabetes mellitus , peripheral artery disease ( i.e . intermittent claudication history vascular surgery except arteriovenous shunt vein strip procedure ) , history hospitalization congestive heart failure , history myocardial infarction , stable angina pectoris , history coronary artery bypass graft percutaneous coronary angioplasty , renal insufficiency ( defined preoperative creatinine &gt; 150 μmol/L ) , history cerebral vascular event , aortic valve stenosis ( define aortic valve area &lt; 1 cm2 ) , atrial fibrillation , moderate poor leave ventricular function ( define leave ventricular ejection fraction &lt; 55 % ) , two follow minor risk factor coronary artery disease : age &gt; 70 year , hypertension , hypercholesterolemia , history transient ischemic attack , chronic obstructive pulmonary disease , smoke low functional capacity ( capable physical activity 4 metabolic equivalent less ) . Patients exclude study participation sign informed consent . Study procedure Patients eligible study identify outpatient preoperative anesthesiology clinic . Patients examine screened cardiac risk factor anesthesiology resident dedicate screen nurse . Results preoperative laboratory test , data patient characteristic preoperative use cardiovascular drug ( i.e . statin , ß -- blocker , platelet inhibitor , calcium antagonist , angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor angiotensine receptor blocker ) note . Prior study procedure write informed consent obtain patient . During study period blood collect plasma troponin T measurement induction general anesthesia ( baseline ) 1st , 3rd 7th postoperative day . All plasma sample frozen store -20°C hospital 's laboratory analysis . Cardiac troponin T batch analysis perform every 3 week use 5th generation Elecsys Troponin T high sensitive assay automate Cobas 6000 platform ( Roche Diagnostics , Germany ) . The limit detection high sensitive assay determine 3 ng/L 99th percentile upper reference limit 14 ng/L . In addition , plasma creatinine level measure sample enzymatic method automate platform ( Roche Diagnostics , Germany ) . An estimated glomerular filtration rate calculate plasma creatinine value use Modification Diet Renal Disease formula . During entire study period daily routine quality control sample troponin creatinine ensure comparable patient data across different reagent lot . After analysis sample store -80°C . Surgical procedure perform general anesthesia combination general epidural anesthesia . Anesthesia management leave discretion attend anesthesiologist . According hospital protocol , patient schedule gastric-esophageal , pancreatic hepatic surgery patient age ≥80 American Association Anesthesiologists physical status classification system ≥3 admit intensive care unit postoperatively least 24 hour . To improve postoperative recovery patient treat accord current Enhanced Recovery After Surgery guideline . During postoperative period research personnel perform patient visit , review medical chart note complication . At thirty day surgery troponin result report researcher follow-up telephone interview perform patient discharge hospital time . Patients ask medical complication occur since discharge hospital . If , medical detail retrieve treat physician . Information routine postoperative clinic visit use patient reach telephone . Noted endpoint judged event committee , blind troponin result . Endpoint definition Primary parameter study postoperative myocardial injury day 1 , 3 7 . Secondary parameter meet occurrence follow non-cardiac event within 30 day surgery : mortality - define death without cardiovascular origin ; sepsis - define systemic inflammatory response syndrome ( SIRS ) response proven suspect microbial infection ; pneumonia - define purulent sputum isolation pathogen sputum culture blood culture clinical symptom ( e.g . dyspnea , fever , cough ) consolidation pleural effusion chest radiograph ; respiratory failure - define non-cardiac hypoxia hypercapnia lead ICU ( ) admission respiratory support ( e.g . ( non ) invasive ventilation high concentration oxygen therapy ) ; anastomotic dehiscence - define presence luminal content drain wound site cause local inflammation SIRS , leak detect image study combination clinical sign SIRS ; intestinal ischemia - defined sign superficial transmural bowel ischemia image study clinical symptom ( e.g . abdominal pain tenderness ) SIRS ; wound infection - purulent drainage superficial incision deliberate open superficial incision surgeon clinical sign local inflammation ( e.g . pain , tenderness , swell , redness ) ; bleed - define abnormal postoperative bleeding need surgical ( i.e . re-operation ) endovascular ( i.e . coil ) treatment . Other study parameter length hospital stay in-hospital mortality .</detailed_description>
