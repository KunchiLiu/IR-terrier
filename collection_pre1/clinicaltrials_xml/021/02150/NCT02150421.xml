	<detailed_description>With bloom information technology electronic engineering recent year , e-books tablet computer introduce local primary secondary school provide student study school home . Parents teacher ' utmost concern adverse effect eye-sight child , especially high progression rate myopia visual discomfort may cause e-book technology . This prospective cohort study determine implementation electronic device teach promotes myopia development progression affect visual function primary schoolchildren . The school introduce e-books student class . Signed informed consent letter parent obtain prior subject recruitment data collection . Eye examination data collection conduct primary school campus . The child two local primary school grade assign two group school . One group use e-books ( e-book group ) study course material assign teacher whereas another group use ordinary textbook ( control group ) . Their refractive error , axial length ( AXL ) binocular function measure monitored six-month interval maximum 2 year .</detailed_description>
