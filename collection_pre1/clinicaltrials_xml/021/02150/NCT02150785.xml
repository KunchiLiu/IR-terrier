	<brief_summary>Currently , thrombolysis offer less 1 % patient low middle income country ( LMICs ) access health care often base financial capability patient . There therefore urgent need effective affordable alternative thrombolytic agent . Streptokinase ( SK ) ( $ 35 ) much economically feasible opposed tissue plasminogen activator ( tPA ) ( $ 2800 ) . In study , propose reevaluation use streptokinase ( SK ) treatment acute ischemic stroke . We want emphasize consider 'treatment option ' absolutely certain IV tissue plasminogen activator ( tPA ) offer patient due high cost . It hypothesize treatment SK appropriately select patient associated hemorrhagic transformation rate similar tPA .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Study design : The AASIST study plan open label feasibility safety study acute treatment SK ( 15 000 units/Kg ) ischemic stroke patient within 3 hour onset . Overall Aims Hypotheses : The primary study aim demonstrate feasibility safety SK base thrombolysis ischemic stroke patient present less 3 hour symptom onset . It hypothesize treatment SK ( 15 000 units/kg ) appropriately select patient associated hemorrhagic transformation rate similar tPA . The goal proposal establish safe effective treatment ischemic stroke patient candidate thrombolysis , currently NOT treat tissue plasminogen activator ( tPA ) due cost constraint . Streptokinase ( SK ) establish thrombolytic widely available currently use first line therapy acute coronary syndrome low/middle income country ( LMIC ) . SK much economically feasible develop world ( ≈ $ 35 v ≈ $ 2800 tr-PA ) . Previous study SK acute stroke indicate risk hemorrhagic complication significant . It hypothesis , however , high rate hemorrhagic complication see trial due aspect trial design , rather drug . These factor include prolonged treatment window ( 6 hour symptom onset ) , dose SK concomitant use antithrombotic medication . In addition , patient recognize poor thrombolysis candidate include trial , include excessively high arterial pressure , drowsiness prior treatment establish early infarct change non-contrast CT . In last two decade , extensive experience acute stroke thrombolysis lead improved patient selection well recognition factor associate increase risk complication , particular intracerebral hemorrhage . We believe fresh look SK warrant immense burden disease , especially LMICs . If able show SK safety comparable tPA research efficacy also positive , position offer effective thrombolysis wider population risk LMICs . The primary endpoint study rate hemorrhagic transformation . Secondary safety endpoint include systemic bleeding complication development hypotension . The DSMB closely involved initial phase case report form image study submit committee . We also establish priori study stop rule , base hemorrhagic transformation rate . Once establish SK safe use context protocol , large phase III randomize control trial plan , aim demonstrate clinical efficacy . Data pilot study use refine treatment protocol power calculation require sample size next phase program . This study also provide opportunity link 20-30 emerge stroke center LMICs ( India , Pakistan , Sudan ) high-income country ( HIC ) sit . Establishing network facilitate future clinical research study well , establish framework research collaboration exchange personnel LMIC HIC site .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>All patient include study acute ischemic stroke within 3 hour symptom onset . In case onset time establish include symptom upon waking , consider time patient last know well Baseline NIHSS must 422 inclusive Blood pressure ( BP ) must ≤180 mmHg systolic ≤105 mmHg diastolic time enrolment . Treatment high systolic BP permit , prior enrolment Female patient childbearing potential negative pregnancy test prior enrolment All patient evidence acute ischemic change noncontrast CT ( NCCT ) scan time enrolment Patients focal neurological deficit due cerebral pathology , intracerebral hemorrhage neoplasm exclude Patients rapidly resolve symptom exclude , preexist functional deficit ( mRS &gt; 2 ) history intracranial bleeding . Recent ( &lt; 3 month ) surgical ACS patient exclude Patients know secured unsecured cerebral aneurysm arteriovenous malformation eligible . Patients previously treat SK ineligible due possibility allergic reaction . Patients known coagulopathies platelet count &lt; 100 000/μl exclude . Exclusion criterion specific critical study : 1 . Onset &gt; 3 hour prior treatment . Although thrombolysis show effective 4.5 hour onset6 , number need treat rise exponentially 3 hour . The great opportunity successful treatment therefore patient treat within 3 hour 2 . Any area hypoattenuation NCCT . Although patient early ischemic change limit distribution may still benefit thrombolysis , optimal responder evidence early infarction 3 . Patients systolic BP &gt; 180 mmHg prior randomization exclude . If BP control IV antihypertensive ( maximum 2 dos ) , may enrol . This conservative current thrombolysis guideline , permit initiation therapy systolic BP &lt; 185 mmHg . This base previous data indicate impact elevate BP hemorrhagic risk 4 . Patients treat anticoagulant ( warfarin/heparin/direct thrombin inhibitors/factor Xa antagonist ) exclude , irrespective INR PTT . Although AHA guideline allow treatment patient warfarin treat INR &lt; 1.5 ( heparin , stop PTT &lt; 50 ) , patient increase risk hemorrhagic transformation . In addition , patient take ASA/clopidogrel ASA/dipyridamole combination exclude Patients take monotherapy antiplatelet agent eligible 5 . Blood glucose &gt; 11.1 mmol/L . Hyperglycemia show associated poor response thrombolysis also increase risk hemorrhagic transformation Therefore , although patient blood glucose &lt; 18 mmol/L normally eligible tPA , exclude</criteria>
