	<brief_summary>The investigator interested skeletal muscle process fat may affect insulin resistance . This important question since insulin resistance predate predicts type 2 diabetes . The investigator especially interested learning effect weight train insulin resistance . The investigator study people supervise aerobic yoga training identify difference rest fat sugar metabolism may lead difference insulin resistance . The investigator test difference use stable isotope , use stable isotope experimental . Overweight/Obese Group : Eight visit require University Minnesota Clinical Research Unit . Four visit do training ( screen 3 pre-training visit ) , 1 visit training , 3 post-training visit do . In , train take 16 week supervise treadmill program . Lean/Trained Group : Four visit require University Minnesota Clinical Research Unit ( screen 3 study visit ) .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Insulin resistance play critical role development type 2 diabetes ( T2DM ) , skeletal muscle large site insulin resistance human body . In sedentary human , insulin resistance correlate level intramyocellular lipid ( IMCL ) lipid metabolite adversely affect skeletal muscle glucose metabolism . However , even modest endurance train show reduce insulin resistance increase skeletal muscle IMCL . Moreover , lean endurance train participant IMCL level comparable patient T2DM , yet significantly low insulin resistance . These finding suggest physiological change cause training protect lipid induce insulin resistance protection present even rest , however preliminary data suggest training facilitates utilization readily available fuel , lipid preferentially use glucose available . We test overarch hypothesis training increase rest skeletal muscle lipid metabolism , measure marker IMCL lipolysis , accumulation fatty acid metabolite mitochondrial utilization fatty acid .</detailed_description>
