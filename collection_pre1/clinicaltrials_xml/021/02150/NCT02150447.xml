	<brief_title>The Use Proton Pump Inhibitor Prevention Gastric Cancer Bleeding</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Tumor bleed frequently occur inoperable gastric cancer patient . Inoperable gastric cancer usually large ulcer friable tumor vessel . Acidic environment stomach prevents adequate function coagulation cascade decrease clot stability . Gastric cancer bleeding may cause significant morbidity often delay schedule chemotherapy . National Center Center data show 30 % gastric cancer patient undergo palliative chemotherapy eventually experience significant cancer bleed treatment period . Once bleeding occurs , endoscopic management difficult gastric cancer patient patient benign peptic ulcer , malignant ulcer bed significant fibrosis . Consequently , gastric cancer patient high risk rebleeding . Proton pump inhibitor ( PPI , lansoprazole example ) decrease gastric acid secretion inhibit H+ , K+-ATPase , subsequently stabilize blood clot . PPIs commonly use benign peptic ulcer reflux esophagitis , PPI decrease recurrent benign ulcer bleed ulcer complication . Moreover , report prevent bleeding NSAID aspirin induce gastric ulcer . Because PPIs safe , even available over-the-counter drug country . Furthermore , drug interaction major chemotherapeutic agent commonly use gastric cancer . Moreover , drug prescribe gastric cancer patient tumor bleed occurs . Although gastric cancer bleed uncommon clinically challenge problem , recommend measure prevent cancer bleeding . Also report efficacy PPIs gastric cancer bleed prevention .</detailed_description>
