	<brief_title>Effectiveness Intervention Reduce Driving Under Influence Alcohol Among Drivers</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Background : Driving influence alcohol one main risk factor road traffic collision since alters drive ability impairs human performance . Consequently , important identify driver drive influence alcohol ; furthermore , intervention necessary diminish drinking-driving behavior . Objectives : The main objective pilot study assess feasibility effectiveness brief intervention reduce drinking-driving behavior . Secondary objective include : 1 . To assess effect intervention stage change level self-efficacy , month 1 12 post-intervention . 2 . To assess feasibility intervention professional patient . 3 . To assess effectiveness decrease regular alcohol consumption month 12 post-intervention . Methods : Design : Pilot multicentre before/after intervention study without control group . Participants : We aim recruit 212 participant . We include random consecutive sampling driver ( valid driver 's license ) age 18 65 open medical history 20 Primary Health Care participate center declare consume alcohol previous driving , least past 30 day . Recruitment take place xxx 2013 xxx 213 . Intervention : Brief behavioral intervention reduce alcohol consumption driving . Measurements : At baseline , follow information gather use structure questionnaire face face interview patient health professional : 1 . Frequency drive influence alcohol past 30 day . gather ) number time patient drink amount alcohol previous drive b ) amount alcohol consume previous drive 2 . Regular alcohol consumption ( Audit-C test ) unit standard drink weekly consume ( UBE ) . 3 . Level self-efficacy stage change accord Prochaska DiClemente 's Transtheoretical Model Change . 4 . Sociodemographic variable : age , sex , social class , educational level , marital status . 5 . Driver profile : Type driver 's license , drive experience , , weekly driving time , safety behaviour , collision ( without injury ) suffer past year . 6 . Chronic pathology chronic consumption medication associate road traffic injuries 7 . Level self risk perception . When possible , information check specified electronical medical record patient . In order ass feasibility intervention undertake survey among health professional . Information ) frequency drive influence alcohol past 30 day , b ) regular alcohol c ) level self-efficacy stet change accord Prochaska State gather one month 12 month post intervention . Analysis : A descriptive analysis population perform . The distribution risk element associate drinking-driving behavior describe bivariate analysis . Potential impact expect : This pilot project determine feasibility make brief advice intervention drinking-driving behavior driver attend primary care .</detailed_description>
