	<brief_summary>Atrial fibrillation ( AF ) abnormal heart rhythm top chamber heart beat fast . AF catheter ablation know technique convert heart rhythm AF normal rhythm . The technique send electrical energy catheter ( long thin round solid tube ) destroy heart tissue focus area AF start . This technique practice many hospital , include Heart Institute , experimental . The AWARE study compare two technique AF catheter ablation : 1 . Ablation tissue wide circular band around open pulmonary vein ( bring blood back lung ) leave upper chamber heart . A medicine call adenosine give unmask incompletely ablated area . Additional ablation give require . This standard procedure . 2 . Same adenosine use . Instead , additional ablation second circular band tissue around open pulmonary vein give . This additional ablation standard procedure consider experimental . We want see add ablation site help maintain normal heart rhythm reduce rate return AF . We compare occurrence medical event complication two group . Identical supply equipment use technique approve Health Canada . Adenosine currently approve Health Canada treatment diagnosis arrhythmia . 342 participant The University Ottawa Heart Institute randomly assign `` similar flipping coin '' treatment group 1 group 2 . After ablation , participant expect remain hospital 4 day . They study follow-up Heart Institute every 3 month 1 3 year , depend enter study .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Augmented Wide Area Circumferential Catheter Ablation Reduction Atrial Fibrillation Recurrence</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Clinical relevance : The problem PV reconnection recurrent AF catheter ablation paroxysmal AF one important challenge face treat physician . Rationale : The understanding role contact force play adequate lesion formation catheter ablation fact may reduce pulmonary vein ( PV ) reconnection AF recurrence excite advance field catheter ablation AF . A small clinical trial demonstrate safety feasibility contact force guide catheter ablation reduce PV reconnection AF recurrence . There clear need well design adequately powered clinical trial evaluate effectiveness new strategy . Objective : Using contact force ( CF ) technology , intention evaluate `` augmented- wide area circumferential catheter ablation strategy '' could potentially reduce incidence pulmonary vein reconnection AF recurrence catheter ablation patient paroxysmal AF . Hypothesis : In patient symptomatic , antiarrhythmic medication resistant paroxysmal AF augmented-wide area circumferential catheter ablation strategy result few electrocardiographically document AF recurrence compare conventional wide-area catheter ablation . All subject control arm trial undergo wide area circumferential catheter ablation ( WACA ; lesion deliver 1-2 cm away pulmonary vein ostium ) around four pulmonary vein endpoint electrical isolation ( demonstrated entry exit block use differential pacing ) . Catheter ablation perform use CF VISITAG guidance ( average CF &gt; 10g , Force time integral ( FTI ) &gt; 500 g-sec minimum ablation duration &gt; 10 sec ) . Dormant PV conduction test use adenosine , completion lesion set , additional lesion deliver eliminate dormant PV conduction . In experimental arm trial subject undergo WACA describe ; however without adenosine testing . In addition subject receive `` augmented '' ablation lesion , guide CF feedback , outer aspect first WACA lesion set . Our hypothesis `` belts suspender '' strategy redundant , CF guide antral ablation lesion result wide band irreversible atrial muscle cardiac autonomic ganglionated-plexi damage . It expectation augment WACA strategy result durable PV isolation thereby significantly reduce AF recurrence . Trial Design : This trial single blind ( patient blind ) , prospective , parallel arm randomize clinical trial . Subjects satisfy inclusion exclusion criterion enrol clinical trial . Subjects randomize ( 1:1 ) either control arm ( WACA ) experimental arm ( augmented- WACA ) . Patients randomize experimental arm go augmented-WACA . The first three-month period catheter ablation consider `` blanking-period '' atrial tachyarrhythmias ( AF , Atrial Flutter [ AFl ] Atrial Tachycardia [ AT ] ) occur period document . However , consider treatment failure . Patient accrual occur 24-month period subject minimum follow-up period 12 month . The total duration trial 36-months ( 24 month accrual minimum 12 month follow subject ) . Patients follow every three month ablation , transtelephonic monitoring well 2-week loop record prior follow visit , entire duration trial . This f/u concurs recommendation 2012 Heart Rhythm Society/European Heart Rhythm Association/European Cardiac Arrhythmia Society Expert Consensus Statement Catheter Surgical Ablation Atrial Fibrillation : Recommendations Patient Selection , Procedural Techniques , Patient Management Follow-up , Definitions , Endpoints , Research Trial Design .</detailed_description>
