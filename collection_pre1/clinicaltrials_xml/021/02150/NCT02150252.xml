	<brief_summary>- Clinical trial ; Ischemic stroke ; Bu-Yang-Huan-Wu Tang （BYHWT） ; Gait parameter ; Quality life Stroke third ten cause death disease constantly , also third consume healthy insurance budget . There 17,000 people disable due stroke every year Taiwan . Although ischemic stroke patient may use t-PA intravenously treatment within 3 hr stroke onset modern medicine , others method may effect treat ischemic stroke patient , thus , study stroke important issue . Bu-Yang- Huan-Wu Tang ( BYHWT ) become main stream treatment stroke Qing dynasty Wang Qing-Ren theory BYHWT may treat stroke due pattern qi stagnation blood stasis traditional Chinese medicine . A number research report BYHWT reduce blood viscosity , anti-inflammation , enhance neuronal regeneration angiogenesis , above-mentioned BYHWT limit level animal study scientific evidence insufficiency human trial . Therefore , purpose present study investigate therapeutic effect BYHWT treat ischemic stroke use strict clinical trial . - We design randomize , double blind , placebo-controlled study assess therapeutic effect BYHWT treat ischemic stroke . The study expect finish assessment 120 patient ischemic stroke three year . The study divide : 1 ) control group , receive placebo-BYHWT 3.0 g TID every day continuously 6 week except ordinary medical care ; 2 ) treatment group , method identical control group , receive BYHWY . The main outcome accord change gait parameter include Speed , Cadence , Strike length , Gait cycle Double support ; secondary outcome include change Functional independence measurement score Barthel index score , Ten Meters Walk Test , Short Physical Performance Batter , Berg Balance Test WHO quality life-brief ( Taiwan Brief ) . - We predict result present provide scientific evidence proof BYHWT improve neurological deficit also improve quality life patient ischemic stroke .</brief_summary>
