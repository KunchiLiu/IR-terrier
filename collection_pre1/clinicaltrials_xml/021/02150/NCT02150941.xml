	<brief_summary>Upper endoscopy perform upper gastrointestinal bleeding ( bleed esophagus , stomach , part duodenum ) identify potentially treat cause bleeding . However , blood clot often make visualization difficult endoscopy . The current practice try wash suction blood clot endoscope . However , often successful due blood clot block suction channel . A new device approve Health Canada attach endoscope help prevent blockage . It believe device help doctor suck blood clot potentially improve visualization , identification cause bleeding , possibly health outcome , although never prove . The purpose clinical trial test whether device work whether help patient type bleeding .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Effectiveness Study BioVac Direct Suction Device Upper Gastrointestinal Bleeding</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>STUDY DESIGN : This randomize double blind clinical trial BioVac suction device versus standard endoscopy suction UGIB . The study perform London Health Sciences Center Victoria Campus University Campus anticipate recruitment period 2.5 year . STUDY POPULATION : All patient age 18 admitted hospital diagnosis UGIB consider recruitment . Patients already admit hospital another diagnosis develop UGIB also include . INTERVENTION : Patients undergo EGD UGIB per standard clinical practice . If bleeding source find within first 5 minute ( timer start EGD pass upper esophageal sphincter ) due blood clot , patient may benefit additional suctioning . The patient randomize block 2-6 stratify site either BioVac device endoscopy suction . Those randomized BioVac device use irrigate suction much blood possible bleeding source find endoscopist feel additional time would help . Those randomized endoscopy suction without BioVac device . Due suction power study device , placebo possible . Our original intention record endoscopy video blindly assess outcome . Unfortunately , end possible technical reason .</detailed_description>
