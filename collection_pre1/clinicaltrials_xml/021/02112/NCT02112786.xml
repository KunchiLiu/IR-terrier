	<brief_summary>Participants receive neuromodulation treatment overactive bladder symptom routinely fit impulse generator . However , set impulse generator set either intermittent continuous stimulation . Participants complete void logs survey month . Battery life interrogated.After one week period device turn , impulse generator turn opposite setting ( intermittent continuous ) one month period repeat . Again , void log , survey , battery life collect . The purpose project investigate outcome intermittent versus continuous stimulation patient treat sacral neuromodulation ( SNM ) refractory overactive bladder ( OAB ) syndrome . In addition , potential improve battery life intermittent stimulation quantify .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The objective project investigate outcome intermittent versus continuous stimulation patient treat sacral neuromodulation ( SNM ) refractory overactive bladder ( OAB ) syndrome . In addition , potential improve battery life intermittent stimulation quantify . Manufacturers recommend setting newly implant impulse generator ( IPG ) ; however , standardized recommendation exist adjustment . Quality study examine IPG parameter lack , partly due numerous set variable , result multitude permutation . When program IPG , option cycling simulation ( 16 second , 8 second ) available . It theorize `` carryover '' effect , symptom relief continue despite stimulator . The potential benefit intermittent stimulation improve battery life , may translate less frequent need reimplantation less morbidity . Participants receive neuromodulation treatment overactive bladder symptom routinely fit impulse generator pre-study phase . Patients experience significant symptomatic improvement receive full bilateral sacral neuromodulator implantation randomize either intermittent continuous stimulation . Participants fill void log survey 12 week period . At point , one-week washout period neuromodulator turn . The impulse generator turn alternate setting ( intermittent continuous ) 12 week period repeat . Questionnaires void diary collect clinic visit . In total , subject participation last approximately 25 week full implantation bilateral lead pulse generator .</detailed_description>
