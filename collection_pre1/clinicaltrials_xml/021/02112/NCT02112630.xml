	<brief_title>Boceprevir End Stage Renal Disease ( ESRD )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Hepatitis C ( HCV ) remain common chronic infection United States 3 million people chronically infect . The majority patient U.S. genotype 1 HCV infection , difficult genotype treat traditional regimen pegylated-interferon ( P-IFN ) ribavirin , lead sustain virologic response ( SVR ) less 50 % case . HCV also establish risk factor chronic kidney disease ( CKD ) end-stage renal disease ( ESRD ) unfortunately treatment even less successful patient mainly limit increased medication toxicity . In spring 2011 , FDA approve two new direct acting antiviral ( DAA ) treatment chronic genotype 1 HCV , boceprevir telaprevir , use combination Peg-IFN ribavirin . This 'triple therapy ' approach significantly increase response rate ( increase SVR rate 80 % patient never previously treat ) represent significant advance field . In addition , several response-guided therapy approach test determine treatment duration could shorten base upon virologic response treatment . To date , study evaluate safety efficacy triple therapy patient ESRD . However , single dose pharmacokinetic study boceprevir subject ESRD hemodialysis demonstrate mean maximum concentration achieve boceprevir ( Cmax ) bioavailability ( AUC ) comparable patient ESRD healthy subject . Mean t½ , median Tmax mean apparent oral total clearance ( CL/F ) value also similar healthy subject patient ESRD . Boceprevir exposure also similar dialysis non-dialysis day . These data suggest boceprevir need adjust patient ESRD dialysis , remove hemodialysis . To date , study telaprevir ESRD patient . The investigator therefore aim study safety efficacy triple therapy use boceprevir combination P-IFN ribavirin patient stage 5 CKD ( define glomerular filtration rate ( GFR ) &lt; 15 mL.min.1.73m2 permanent hemodialysis stage 5 ) . In addition , give significant toxicity treatment particular patient population , investigator aim study efficacy response guide therapy patient eligible response-guided therapy base prior study ( treatment naïve patient , well documented history relapse prior treatment P-IFN ribavirin ) .</detailed_description>
