	<brief_summary>STUDY AIM To decrease number breast cancer patient receive overtreatment axilla , order positively influence axillary morbidity rate quality life . PRIMARY OBJECTIVE To determine whether omit completion axillary treatment inferior current axillary treatment regimen sentinel node positive breast cancer patient undergo mastectomy , term regional recurrence rate . HYPOTHESIS Completion axillary treatment safely omit sentinel node positive breast cancer patient undergo mastectomy . This lead decrease axillary morbidity rate increase quality life , non-inferior regional control , distant-disease free- overall survival rate .</brief_summary>
