	<detailed_description>The past emphasis psycho-emotional feature loss result lack attention restoration-focused adaptation . Middle-aged old bereave person , include previously provide care terminally ill spouse partner , confront unfamiliar daily demand . Even though death due terminal illness like cancer may anticipate , survive spouse/partner may involve care die person consume emotional distress accompanies , little time energy plan change , unforeseen prior loss . This gap abilities suggest need intervention strategy improve skill master task daily living , engage self-care behavior , function socially single uncoupled person society .

Some task daily living may primary responsibility decease person . If skill acquire bereavement , health , functioning , autonomy overall quality life bereave could adversely affect .
