	<brief_summary>There urgent need prevent onset progression food allergy population . Evidence demonstrate food allergy atopic eczema represent early manifestation atopic march 50 % infant food allergy predict develop respiratory allergic disease later life . We report Australia high prevalence IgE-mediated food allergy world , 10 % infant challenge-proven food allergy Melbourne . There 5-fold increase hospital admission life-threatening anaphylaxis . These change pronounce child less 5 year , suggest causal role early life determinant . We primary data inform hypothesis rise food allergy , appear result potentially modifiable factor related modern lifestyle , particularly Vitamin D insufficiency ( VDI ) , demonstrate association VDI increase risk challenge-proven food allergy 12-month old infant , support numerous ecological study show increased risk food allergy child resides equator ( associate decrease UV exposure Vitamin D level ) . Despite Australia 's sunny climate , population rate VDI steadily increase infant pregnant woman parallel apparent rise food allergic disease . This association biologically plausible , evidence Vitamin D critical healthy development immune system early life . We propose intervention study assess infant Vitamin D supplementation first year life significantly decrease risk early-onset food allergy . Australia ideally place answer important question since , unlike USA , Canada Europe , population recommendation routine infant supplementation Vitamin D one develop country supplement food chain supply Vitamin D .</brief_summary>
