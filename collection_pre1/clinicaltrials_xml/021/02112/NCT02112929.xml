	<brief_summary>The investigator aim use hyperpolarized xenon gas magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) compute tomography develop new technique capable objectively quantitatively describe regional structural lung abnormality . Since relatively novel technique , investigator first need acquire image clinical data group participant normal lung . The investigator hope generate `` atlas '' normality , form foundation future study compare patient suffer chronic respiratory disease . The investigator also aim validate new technique term intra-subject reproducibility .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Regional Lung Imaging Using Hyperpolarized Xenon Gas</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Currently , gold standard assessment lung function chronic respiratory disease spirometry . This combined anatomical imaging ( chest x-ray compute tomography ) structural assessment . Spirometry measure global lung function . It provide information regard different region lung support `` framework '' lung , parenchyma . In addition , change lung function measure spirometric index correlate coherently symptom experience patient , reflect decline health . This weak relationship probably lung complex regional organ localize disturbance variety factor include gas flow ( ventilation ) , blood flow ( perfusion ) gas transfer combine impair respiratory function . MRI advantage image technique free ionize radiation make safe practical disease asthma obstructive lung disease repeat follow-up scan necessary . Hyperpolarized xenon , dose give image show safe . Conventional MRI limit use respiratory disease , lung largely compose air space generate MR signal . Hyperpolarized noble gas resolve problem .</detailed_description>
