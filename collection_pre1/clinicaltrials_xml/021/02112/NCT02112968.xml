	<criteria>Subjects least 18 year age . Subjects able read , understand , sign statement Informed Consent ( give copy sign Informed Consent Form ( ICF ) . Subjects willing able return schedule followup examination 6 respectively 12 month surgery . For Proscan Zyoptix Treatments myopic subject require sphere 0.5 D maximum sphere 10.0 D. If patient refractive astigmatism treat , must 0.5 D 4.0 D ( corneal astigmatism ) express spectacle minus cylinder form ( manifest subjective refraction ) . Overall SE myope must 12.0 D. The Hyperopic subject require sphere +0.5 D maximum sphere +4.0 D. If patient refractive astigmatism treat , must +0.5 D +4.0 D ( corneal astigmatism ) express spectacle plus cylinder form ( manifest subjective refraction ) . Overall SE hyperope must +6.0 D. Subjects contact lens wearer must gas permeable lens discontinue least 3 week soft lens discontinue least 1 week prior preoperative evaluation eye treat . Corneal topography qualify . Subjects contact lens wearer must two ( 2 ) central keratometry reading two ( 2 ) manifest subjective refraction take preoperatively least one week apart . The refraction value must differ 0.50 D define manifest refraction spherical equivalent ( MRSE ) . The keratometry value must differ previous value 0.50 D either meridian . High contrast , manifest , best spectaclecorrected distance visual acuity correctable binocular least 1.0 ( Snellen 20/20 6/6 ) monocular least 0.8 ( Snellen 20/25 6/7.5 ) . In case monocular surgery eye treat must best correct distance visual acuity least 0.8 ( Snellen 20/25 6/7.5 ) . For treatment SUPRACOR presbyopic algorithm , subject least 45 year old 85 year . For treatment SUPRACOR presbyopic algorithm , subject must presbyopia determine agerelated need optical aid ( &gt; +1.50 D ) read best distance correction screen successfully acceptance SUPRACOR simulation . For treatment SUPRACOR presbyopic algorithm , subject must screen successfully acceptance SUPRACOR simulation For treatment SUPRACOR presbyopic algorithm , Myopic subject must 7.0 diopter ( D ) absolute spherical myopia ( spherical equivalent ) , 4.0 D refractive astigmatism ( NOT corneal astigmatism ) manifest subjective refraction . The spherical equivalent must 9.0 D. Hyperopic subject must +4 diopter ( D ) absolute spherical hyperopia ( spherical equivalent ) , +2.5 D refractive astigmatism ( NOT corneal astigmatism ) manifest subjective refraction eye . The spherical equivalent must +5.25 D. Mesopic pupil size measure Zywave II WaveFront Aberrometer must &lt; 7.0 mm photopic pupil size measure Orbscan II/ IIz must &gt; 2.9 mm . For treatment Zyoptix algorithm , highorderaberration must least 0.35µm . Subjects combination baseline corneal thickness plan operative parameter LASIK procedure would result less 250 micron remain posterior corneal thickness flap postoperatively . Hyperopic eye baseline manifest subjective refraction exhibit difference great ± 0.75 D sphere power , difference great ± 0.50 D cylinder power , difference cylinder axis 15 degree compare baseline cycloplegic subjective refraction . For manifest cylinder less ±0.75 D , difference cylinder axis would take consideration . Any subject go comanaged ophthalmologist optometrist approve Technolas Perfect Vision Investigator . Subjects anterior segment pathology , include dry eye syndrome cataract , Investigator 's opinion would interfere best spectaclecorrected visual acuity successful treatment . Subjects evidence retinal vascular disease . Subjects residual , recurrent , active ocular disease , corneal abnormality Investigator 's opinion would interfere BSCVA successful treatment . Subjects sign keratoconus . Subjects unstable central keratometry reading irregular mire . Subjects previous intraocular corneal surgery kind , include type Excimer laser surgery either refractive therapeutic purpose . Subjects history Herpes simplex Herpes zoster keratitis . Subject history glaucoma glaucoma suspect . Subjects corneal edema , increase IOP &gt; 22mmHg . Subjects risk angle closure . Subjects immunocompromised carry diagnosis connective tissue disease , clinically significant atopic disease , diabetes , autoimmune disease acute chronic illness increase risk subject confound outcome study . Subject take systemic medication likely affect wound heal corticosteroid antimetabolite . Subjects know pregnant , lactate , plan become pregnant course study . Subjects know sensitivity medication use standard LASIK . Subjects participate ophthalmic clinical trial clinical study . Subjects ocular muscle disorder include strabismus nystagmus , disorder affect fixation . Subjects cognitive impairment vulnerable person . Subjects anterior posterior synechiae .</criteria>
