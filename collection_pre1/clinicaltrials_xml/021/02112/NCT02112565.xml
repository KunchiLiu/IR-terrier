	<brief_title>RNR Inhibitor COH29 Treating Patients With Solid Tumors That Are Refractory Standard Therapy For Which No Standard Therapy Exists</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To determine maximum tolerate dose COH29 ( ribonucleotide reductase [ RNR ] inhibitor COH29 ) recommend dose phase II testing . II . To determine pharmacokinetics COH29 . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . To characterize safety tolerability COH29 assess toxicity per Common Terminology Criteria Adverse Events ( CTCAE ) version 4.0 . II . To characterize clinical activity COH29 via objective tumor response . III . To assess pharmacodynamic response COH29 ribonucleotide reductase ( RR ) poly-adenosine diphosphate-ribose polymerase ( PARP ) activity peripheral blood mononuclear cell ( PBMCs ) . IV . To explore baseline RRM2 tumor protein expression potential correlative marker COH29 response . V. To explore measurement plasma cytokeratin 18 ( CK18 ) surrogate pharmacodynamic marker COH29 antitumor activity . OUTLINE : This dose escalation study . Patients receive RNR inhibitor COH29 orally ( PO ) twice daily ( BID ) day 1-21 . Courses repeat every 28 day absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . After completion study treatment , patient follow 30 day .</detailed_description>
