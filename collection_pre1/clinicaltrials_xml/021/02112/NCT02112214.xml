	<brief_title>Helicobacter Pylori Eradication Gastric Cancer Prevention General Population</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Despite decrease incidence observe US West European country , gastric cancer still important global public health problem , especially East Asian country , burden disease substantial . In Republic Korea , gastric cancer remain leading cause cancer men fourth common cancer woman . There sufficient epidemiological experimental evidence support causal link bacterial infection H. pylori gastric cancer development . However , evidence clinical trial efficacy H. pylorus eradication antimicrobial therapy reduce risk gastric cancer still limit . In addition , beneficial deleterious health impact mass eradication population level define . In Korea , prevalence H. pylori infection adult still relatively high ( ~60 % , &gt; 16 year old ) , despite important reduction mortality attribute screen program , incidence gastric cancer remain elevate . The investigator propose conduct randomize control clinical trial Korea evaluate efficacy H. pylorus eradication prevent gastric cancer incidence different population subgroup include age baseline gastric pathology . This study conduct context National Cancer Screening Program Korean Central Cancer Registry . The propose study collaborative investigation National Cancer Center , Korea International Agency Research Cancer World Health Organization .</detailed_description>
