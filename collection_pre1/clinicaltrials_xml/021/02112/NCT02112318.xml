	<brief_summary>The study aim test hypothesis whether atrial fibrillary rate ( AFR ) , measure atrial electrical remodel assessed surface ECG , predictive sinus rhythm maintenance electrical cardioversion . Earlier study perform retrospective fashion suggest high AFR exceed 350-360 fibrillation per minute independent predictor AF relapse cardioversion , particularly patient duration AF episode exceed 30 day , however hypothesis test prospective study . CASAF observational study enroll patient short duration ( &lt; 30 day ) AF admitted electrical cardioversion . Admission ECG extract digital format process off-line estimation AFR . AF relapse assess 6-weeks long follow-up period ECG control schedule week 1 6 .</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Recurrent AF verify least one ECG record prior index admission Known onset symptom within 30 day index admission . Sinus rhythm ECG within 30 day prior index admission If onset symptom unknown . If duration present AF episode &gt; 48 hour thromboembolic risk minimize either verify patient adequately anticoagulated accord hospital routine TEE perform verify lack contraindication electrical cardioversion . Echocardiography time since first onset AF verify lack significant valvular disease . Age old 18 year . AF due reversible cause significant valvular heart disease Treatment class I III antiarrhythmic drug within five halflives elimination period . No amiodarone treatment within six month admission Prior ablation AF Unability verify onset symptom within 30 day prior index admission</criteria>
