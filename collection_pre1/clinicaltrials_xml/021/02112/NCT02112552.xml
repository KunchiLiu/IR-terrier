	<brief_summary>This pilot , phase II trial study side effect well paclitaxel give vein carboplatin give directly abdominal cavity ( intraperitoneally ) follow radiation therapy work treat patient stage IIIC-IV serous uterine cancer . Drugs use chemotherapy , paclitaxel carboplatin , work different way stop growth tumor cell , either kill cell , stop dividing , stop spread . Giving drug different way may kill tumor cell . Radiation therapy use high-energy x-ray kill tumor cell . Giving chemotherapy follow radiation therapy may effective treatment uterine cancer .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Paclitaxel Intraperitoneal Carboplatin Followed Radiation Therapy Treating Patients With Stage IIIC-IV Uterine Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To evaluate toxicity ( defined National Cancer Institute [ NCI ] Common Toxicity Criteria version [ v. ] 4.0 ) weekly intravenous ( IV ) paclitaxel intraperitoneal ( IP ) carboplatin chemotherapy give every third week , follow radiation therapy ( RT ) patient advanced stage uterine serous cancer ( USC ) . II . To determine feasibility regimen woman advance stage USC . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . To assess frequency reason early discontinuation study treatment . II . To describe patient-reported quality life parameter specify time point study use validated questionnaire : European Organization Research Treatment Cancer ( EORTC ) Quality Life Questionnaire ( QLQ ) -C30 QLQ-ovarian cancer module ( OV ) 28 . TERTIARY OBJECTIVES : I . To define pattern recurrence ( e.g . local versus distant ) progression-free survival patient advance recurrent USC treat dose dense IV paclitaxel IP carboplatin therapy . II . To correlate surrogate endpoint biomarkers perform standard histology processing ( estrogen receptor progesterone receptor status well human epidermal growth factor 2 [ Her2/neu ] status ) progression-free survival prognosis . III . To assess potential late effect combine intraperitoneal chemotherapy radiotherapy gastrointestinal , genitoureteral , bone marrow body system begin 6 month post treatment completion routine office visit . OUTLINE : CHEMOTHERAPY : Patients receive paclitaxel intravenously ( IV ) 1 hour day 1 , 8 , 15 carboplatin intraperitoneally ( IP ) day 1 . Treatment repeat every 21 day 6 course ( week 1-18 ) absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . RADIATION : At provider discretion , patient may undergo 3-dimensional ( 3D ) conformal intensity-modulated radiation therapy ( IMRT ) 5 day week 5 week ( week 19-23 ) . After completion study treatment , patient follow every 3 month 2 year , every 6 month 3 year , yearly thereafter 10 year .</detailed_description>
