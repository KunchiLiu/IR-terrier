	<brief_summary>Electrical stimulation spinal cord ( Spinal Cord Stimulation SCS ) pain relief use decade . It use commonly patient chronic neuropathic leg pain , spinal surgery . Conventional neurostimulation apply frequency 30 60 Hertz ( Hz ) perceptible paraesthesia felt . Stimulation use high frequency sub perception paraesthesia recently challenge conventional form neurostimulation.The high frequency stimulation appear show well pain relief back limb pain comparison low frequency SCS , may also effective subject respond low frequency SCS .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Rationale : Electrical stimulation dorsal columns spinal cord ( Spinal Cord Stimulation SCS ) pain relief use human several decade . The common indication SCS treatment refractory neuropathic leg pain , particularly symptoms persist anatomically successful operation ( Failed Back Surgery Syndrome FBSS ) . Low frequency - conventional - SCS ( LF-SCS ) apply frequency range 30 60 Hertz ( Hz ) subject feel paraesthesias painful area , consider ideal situation . Recently , LF-SCS challenge development stimulation mode high frequency provide pain relief sub-perception threshold , i.e . without paraesthesia . A recent case series report High Frequency Spinal Cord Stimulation ( HF-SCS ) appear show well pain relief back limb pain comparison LF-SCS , also effective subject respond LF-SCS . Objective : The primary objective trial compare pain suppression two group subject chronic unilateral limb pain result FBSS . Study design : A prospective , double blind ( subject , physician , statistician ) , multi-centre , randomize , crossover trial SCS treatment subject refractory neuropathic leg pain back surgery . Study population : Patients chronic neuropathic refractory unilateral leg pain Intervention : Patients undergo neurostimulation low high frequency parameter , order receive treatment randomize Main study endpoint : Pain suppression short long-term ( 24 day 12 month ) Nature extent burden risk associate participation , benefit group relatedness : Both method stimulation standard clinical practice perform routinely study centre , group receive standard care . The difference change stimulation frequency order apply . Possible benefit subject form stimulation evaluate . This may lead good quality life HF-SCS Group result pain relief without paraesthesia . Furthermore , non-responders LF-SCS may benefit HF-SCS .</detailed_description>
