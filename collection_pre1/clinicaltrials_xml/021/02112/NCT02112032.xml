	<detailed_description>This safety dose-seeking study combination MK-3475 peginterferon alfa-2b adult patient ( ≥18 ) advance melanoma . A total 32 patient include . Subjects undergo screen evaluation determine eligibility within 28 day ( 4 week ) first dose . Each 21 day dose period constitute cycle . Peginterferon alfa-2b give subcutaneously , weekly accord regimen . peginterferon alfa-2b ( Sylatron ) FDA-approved adjuvant treatment patient melanoma microscopic gross nodal involvement within 84 day definitive surgical resection include complete lymphadenectomy . MK-3475 potent humanize IgG4 mAb high specificity bind PD-1 receptor , thus inhibit interaction PD-L1 PD-L2 . MK-3475 acceptable preclinical safety profile advance clinical development immunotherapy advance malignancy . In protocol , MK-3475 evaluate 2 mg/kg intravenously every 3 week 2 year combination peginterferon alfa-2b 1 µg/kg/week , 2 µg/kg/week , 3 µg/kg/week subcutaneous injection .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Patient must histologically cytologically confirm diagnosis unresectable stage III IV melanoma . Patient may diagnosis uveal melanoma . Patients may previously untreated receive 3 prior systemic therapy metastatic disease . Prior radiation therapy ( number ) interferon use adjuvant metastatic disease setting permit ( trial interferon mainly use enhance initiate immune response MK3475 ) . Vaccine therapy count systemic therapy . All prior therapy must discontinue least 4 week . A 2 week washout kinase inhibitor acceptable . Patients either ipilimumab naïve refractory ipilimumab , define receive least two dos ipilimumab document disease progression . Patients retreat ipilimumab patient maintenance ipilimumab allow enter trial long document PD . Progressive disease define increase tumor burden &gt; 25 % relative nadir ( minimum record tumor burden ) confirm repeat assessment less four week date first document PD . Once PD confirm , initial date PD documentation consider date disease progression . Full resolution ipilimumab relate AEs baseline ( include irAEs ) steroid treatment ( &gt; 10 mg/day prednisone equivalent dose ) irAEs least two week prior first dose study drug . 1 . No history severe irAEs ipilimumab CTCAE Grade 4 require steroid treatment ; history CTCAE Grade 3 require steroid treatment ( &gt; 10mg/day prednisone equivalent dose ) &gt; 12 week . 2 . Minimum four week ( wash period ) last dose ipilimumab . Patients must consent participate correlative study available tumor tissue tumor biopsy . Patient must measurable disease per RECIST version 1.1 . At least 1 tumor site must amenable biopsy may site disease use measure antitumor response . Patient ≥ 18 year age day sign informed consent . Patient must performance status 0 1 ECOG Performance Scale Patient must adequate organ function indicate follow laboratory value ( within 4 week prior start study drug ) : 1 . Absolute neutrophil count ( ANC ) ≥ 1,500/uL 2 . Platelets ≥ 100,000/uL 3 . Hemoglobin ≥ 9 g/dL ≥ 5.6 mmol/L 4 . Serum creatinine ≤ 1.5 X upper limit normal ( ULN ) 5 .

International Normalized Ratio ( INR ) Prothrombin Time ( PT ) ≤ 1.5 X ULN unless patient receive anticoagulant therapy 8 . Activated Partial Thromboplastin Time ( aPTT ) ≤ 1.5 X ULN unless patient receive anticoagulant therapy Patient voluntarily agree participate give write informed consent/assent trial . Female patient childbearing potential negative urine serum pregnancy test within 7 day prior receive first dose study medication . If urine test positive confirm negative , serum pregnancy test require . The serum pregnancy test must negative patient eligible . Female patient enrol study , free menses &gt; 2 year , post hysterectomy/oophorectomy , surgically sterilize , must willing use either 2 adequate barrier method barrier method plus hormonal method contraception prevent pregnancy , abstain heterosexual activity throughout study , start first dose study drug visit 1 120 day last dose study drug . Approved contraceptive method include example : intrauterine device , diaphragm spermicide , cervical cap spermicide , male condom , female condom spermicide . Spermicides alone acceptable method contraception . Male patient must agree use adequate method contraception start first dose study drug 120 day last dose study drug . Patient chemotherapy , radioactive , biological cancer therapy within four week prior first dose study drug , recover CTCAE Grade 1 good AEs due cancer therapeutic administer four week earlier . Subjects ≤ grade 2 neuropathy exception criterion may qualify study . Note : If patient receive major surgery , must recover adequately toxicity and/or complication intervention prior start therapy . Note : Toxicity recover ≤ Grade 1 allow meet inclusion requirement laboratory parameter define Inclusion Criterion # 9 . Patient currently participate participate study investigational agent use investigational device within 4 week first dose study drug . Patient expect require form systemic localize antineoplastic therapy study . Patient chronic systemic steroid therapy ( &gt; 10 mg/kg prednisone equivalent ) within two week plan date first dose randomize treatment form immunosuppressive medication ( Premedication corticosteroid nausea permit . ) Patient know history hematologic malignancy , primary brain tumor sarcoma , another primary solid tumor , unless patient undergone potentially curative therapy evidence disease five year . Note : The time requirement also apply patient underwent successful definitive resection basal squamous cell carcinoma skin , superficial bladder cancer , situ cancer include cervical cancer , breast cancer , melanoma , situ cancer . Patient know active central nervous system ( CNS ) metastases and/or carcinomatous meningitis . Patients previously treat brain metastasis may participate provide stable ( without evidence progression MRI least four week prior first dose study drug ) , evidence new enlarge brain metastasis systemic steroid ( ≤ 10 mg/day prednisone equivalent ) least two week prior enrollment . Patient previously severe hypersensitivity reaction treatment another mAb IFNα2b . Patient active autoimmune disease document history autoimmune disease syndrome require systemic steroid immunosuppressive agent . Patients vitiligo , type I diabetes , resolve childhood asthma/atopy would exceptions rule . Patients require intermittent use bronchodilator local steroid injection would exclude study . Patients hypothyroidism stable hormone replacement also exclude study . Patient evidence interstitial lung disease .
