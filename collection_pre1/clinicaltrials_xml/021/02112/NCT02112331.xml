	<brief_summary>The optimization newborns nutrition challenge especially preterm newborn nutrition play crucial part cerebral global development . Human milk consider best food newborn . Several short long-term beneficial health effect attribute breastfeed induced increase human milk preterm newborns nutrition . Whereas chemical composition infant formula optimize mimic human milk , still major difference structure human milk commercial infant formula . It well know adult nutrition structure emulsion influence susceptibility hydrolysis , result obtain either vitro vivo study . Human milk natural emulsion ( oil water ) . Lipids droplet disperse form entity call milk fat globule ( average diameter 4 µm , span 0.1-20 μm ) . The globule stabilize trilayered membrane compose mainly polar lipid ( phospholipid , sphingolipids gangliosides ) , proteins , neutral lipid minor compound . The physical treatment apply human milk generally bovine milk pasteurize stabilize milk modify structure natural emulsion . Heat treatment instance induces whey protein denaturation adsorption protein aggregate surface milk fat globule . Heat treatment also lead denaturation bile salt stimulate lipase . These effect limit intragastric lipolysis preterm newborn . Conversely , reduction milk globule size , homogenisation milk , increase specific surface available lipase adsorption limit lose fat enteral administration milk . Such treatment could thus enhance gastric lipolysis improve fat absorption preterm newborn . The objective trial evaluate effect physical treatment ( pasteurization homogenisation ultrasonication ) apply human milk gastric lipolysis milk destructuration . This trial conduct , vivo , preterm newborn .</brief_summary>
