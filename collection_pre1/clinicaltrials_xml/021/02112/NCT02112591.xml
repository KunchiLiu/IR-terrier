	<brief_title>Transobturator Subtrigonal Tape v Transobturator Suburethral Tape Stress Urinary Incontinence</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>THEORETICAL FRAMEWORK : Urinary incontinence affect 27.9 % 46.5 % adult woman country 50 % part world ; 85 % loss urine associate physical stress ( SUI ) . TOT ( Trans-Obturator Tape ) standard treatment SUI . The success range 59.7 % 99 % . The frequent inconvenience placement tap suburethral position urinary obstruction . Kristensen report 56 % patient micturition difficulty 16.6 % acute urinary retention . Other series report urinary obstruction 11.6 % 25.8 % patient . Sander report 77 % patient TVT difficulty micturition one year post-op 63 % continue difficulty 3.5 year follow-up . In experience , subtrigonal position pubic fascial sling significantly reduce possibility obstruction flow consequence . It worth note tape position also achieve objective cure SUI stabilize middle urethra stress , thus correct excessive mobility urethra allow muscle pelvic floor contract urethral sphincter ( middle urethra ) . This hypothesis demonstrate previously pubic fascial subtrigonal sling . We propose measure success surgery capacity correct SUI without obstruct urinary flow ; measure true efficacy . RESEARCH QUESTION : Will efficacy ( capacity correct SUI without obstruct urinary flow ) transobturator subtrigonal polypropylene vaginal tape ( S-TOT ) significantly high tension-free suburethral tape ( TOT ) correction female SUI ? GENERAL OBJECTIVE : Evaluate efficacy security S-TOT compare TOT . SPECIFIC OBJECTIVES : Evaluate SUI correction rate S-TOT compare TOT . Evaluate rate urinary obstruction S-TOT compare TOT . Evaluate rate complication procedure . HYPOTHESIS : The rate success efficacy ( SUI correction , maintain normal micturition ) 87.5 % patient undergoing S-TOT procedure compare 50 % TOT . MATERIALS AND METHODS : Study Population : Patients affiliate Mexican Institute Social Security ( IMSS ) SUI diagnosis accept surgical treatment . The eligibility requirement : History least 3 month symptom isolate SUI symptom SUI Study Design : Parallel group randomize clinical trial . Sample Size : Sample size estimate base upon expect efficacy S-TOT 78 % , 50 % sub-urethral procedure , use alpha 0.05 beta power 80 % . Results show necessary include 34 individual per group . Variables study : -Resolution SUI : Negative 24/h pad test regular urination ( without change obstruction Blaivas Nomogram and/or Scale Urinary Symptoms Women ) . Negative pad test , &lt; 15 g/24 hour . -Postoperative Obstruction : Scale Urinary Symptoms Women ( SUSW ) : 1-7 point = mild obstruction , 8-18 = moderate obstruction , &gt; 19 = severe obstruction Ascending change level obstruction provide increase ≥ 5 point compare baseline Qmax : ≤20ml/s , provide reduction compare baseline Blaivas Nomogram : The intersection Qmax ( abscissa ) maximum contraction detrusor ( ordinate ) fall one four possible area : obstruct , mild obstruction , moderate obstruction severe obstruction Recurrent Urinary Infection : Symptoms , irregular general urine test urine culture bacterial growth &gt; 1 occurrence per year procedure Groin pain ( visual analog scale ) &gt; 3 month procedure ( none , mild , moderate severe ) Extrusion tape : Exposure mesh outside body ( observation ) Intrusion tape : Migration mesh inside urinary digestive system ( open endoscopic observation ) Infection mesh and/or wound : Presence erythema , exudate local swell wound tissue surround mesh , direct observation without microbiological test Prevalence SUI urge urinary incontinence per `` The International Consultation Incontinence Questionnaire-Short Form ( ICIQ-SF ) '' Prevalence sexual function symptom , QoL , perception result treatment per King 's Health Questionnaire Bladder perforation : Intraoperative bladder opening cause needle instrument Significant bleeding : Hemorrhage and/or intraoperative postoperative hematoma &gt; 1000ml Statistical Analysis : Success lack success compare treatment use chi-squared test . If adjustment necessary variable present baseline , event homogeneously distribute among treatment group , Mantel Haenszel chi-squared test use . In case p &lt; 0.05 consider significant . Study Procedures : Urologists gynecologist participate research send candidate patient IEC study do selection criterion check . If meet criterion , random number table use decide center send : Hospital Specialties S-TOT subtrigonal tape apply , Hospital Gynecology , TOT suburethral tape apply . After procedure , send back IEC subsequent visit evaluation . Enrollment last 1 year patient 2 year follow-up . Quality safety study evaluate independent team . Study data blindly analyze researcher involved procedure study . Evaluation Program : Data collect clinical evaluation administration relate questionnaire answer patient supervision visit : pre-operative , 2 6 week , 6 , 12 24 month post-op . The IEC staff meet candidate first visit ( 1a ) , medical history take , inclusion exclusion criterion validate , lab test full blood count , coagulation factor , blood chemistry , general urine test , urine culture request . If applicable cardiovascular evaluation also request , 3/d bladder diary form hand completion must present next visit . On visit 1b , point regard informed consent explain patient , must sign want participate study . The 3/d Bladder Dairy collect , ICIQ-SF , SUSW King 's Health questionnaire complete , test pad test , uroflowmetry , Valsalva maneuver demonstrate SUI urodynamics , cystometry , urethral pressure profile ( UPP ) run send center randomly select procedure . After procedure either center , upon release hospital , patient give prescription 3 day analgesic antibiotic , request form general urine test urine culture , go IEC visit 2 3 ( 2 6 week post-op ) data medical condition , vital sign , general urine test , urine culture , uroflowmetry postvoid residual volume measure ultrasound collect . A 3/d Bladder Diary request visit 4 , general urine test , urine culture follow visit . On visit 4 ( 6 month ) , follow evaluate : medical condition , vital sign , 3/d Bladder Diary , general urine test , urine culture , uroflowmetry , postvoid residual volume measurement , pad test , cystometry UPP , ICIQ-SF , SUSW King 's Health questionnaire apply general urine test urine culture request . On visit 5 6 ( 12 24 month ) follow evaluate : medical condition , vital sign , general urine test , urine culture , uroflowmetry , postvoid residual measurement ultrasound , ICIQ-SF , SUSW King 's Health questionnaire apply study . Patients require treatment stress urinary incontinence continue 24 month evaluation remain study end program . ETHICAL ASPECTS : Every investigation carry human base follow ethical principle : 1 ) Respect people , respect autonomy provide protection limited autonomy ; 2 ) Benefits : investigation procedure include maximize benefit minimize damage , risk reasonable relation expect benefit ; 3 ) Justice , equitable distribution responsibility benefit relate research ; relate protection right benefit vulnerable people , method choose participant direct benefit participant anticipate benefit region participant come represent . This investigation sufficient scientific quality ensure potential inconvenient risk participant expose reduced minimum , time procedure experimental group expert well regular procedure control group , guarantee use resource ethical justification . The S-TOT procedure subtrigonal placement polypropylene tape similar TOT ; difference tape place bladder floor instead urethra intention reduce frequent risk TOT : Difficulty urination . This difficulty also cause increase symptom void storing , recurrent urinary infection , dissatisfaction result , problem urine loss physical stress replace new symptom include urge incontinence . These negative effect quality life , even SUI surgery . Another difference two technique S-TOT end tape attach tendon adductor prevent tape form detach thus avoid recurrence SUI . Summarizing , intention S-TOT improve effectiveness procedure correct SUI . It first time world study use technique carry . There one reference , author , subtrigonal tape abdominal fascia placement , demonstrate great effectiveness regular technique consider SUI resolution absence urinary obstruction . There difference expect regard rest complication approach polypropylene tape , since similar two procedure . Confidentiality Study result manage protected responsibility researcher guarantee security confidentiality information . In event result publish , anonymity participant study guarantee . Conditions consent require : The informed consent agreement give patient write visit 1b , interview IEC specialist , read , , case , sign witness involve . The IEC medical specialist answer question respect consent patient sign . The signature principal investigator request promptly .</detailed_description>
