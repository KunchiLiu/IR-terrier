	<brief_title>Study ThermoDox With Standardized Radiofrequency Ablation ( RFA ) Treatment Hepatocellular Carcinoma ( HCC )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This Phase III , randomize , double blind , dummy control safety efficacy study ThermoDox plus sRFA compare sRFA plus dummy infusion use standardized treatment dwell time solitary HCC lesion ≥ 3.0 cm ≤ 7.0 cm . An sRFA treatment protocol define dwell time ≥ 45 minute measure first activation RFA probe removal RFA probe final ablation cycle deployment . The 50 mg/m2 ThermoDox dummy infusion administer IV 30 minute . As part blind pre-medication ThermoDox treat subject receive 20 mg dexamethasone orally 24 hour prior drug infusion infusion reaction prophylaxis . Subjects control arm receive match dummy pre-medication pill orally 24 hour prior infusion study treatment . Thirty minute prior receive ThermoDox infusion , subject receive blind dose 20 mg IV dexamethasone , 50 mg IV diphenhydramine either 50 mg IV ranitidine 20 mg IV famotidine . Subjects control arm receive mask dummy pre-medication pill orally 24 hour prior infusion study medication , dummy infusion 30 minute prior dummy infusion Sodium Chloride 0.9 % 5 % Dextrose ( D5W ) . RFA initiate approximately minimum 15 minute initiation study drug infusion complete later 3 hour study drug infusion initiation . The goal reach &gt; 45 minute dwell time achieve employ least four ablation cycle deployment order ablate tumor well 360º 1.0 cm tumor-free margin surround tumor.with estimate overall procedure time le 3 hour . A subject incomplete ablation eligible 1 retreatment procedure within 21 day radiological image exam show residual disease Day 28 . Subjects retreat RFA equipment treatment assign randomization . Subjects complete ablation retreatment follow PFS OS . If 2 ablation subject local , distant intrahepatic , extrahepatic HCC , subject consider treatment failure meet PFS endpoint . The subject follow OS every 3 month . Among subject treatment failure , five repeat treatment permit treat recurrent lesion treat newly-identified local distant intrahepatic lesion Investigator 's discretion PFS endpoint report agreement Sponsor . The subject must eligible retreatment consistent safety eligibility criterion retreat randomized treatment . CT MRI image use assess effectiveness ablation therapy . The blind maintain level image read . Investigator determine radiological progression must observe recorded prior begin alternate treatment HCC . Posttreatment image obtained month 1 , 5 , 9 , 13 , 17 , 21 , 25 , every 6 month ( +/- 2 week ) radiological progression see . Adverse event assessment laboratory examination occur visit . All subject monitor throughout investigational period . Patients meet inclusion/exclusion criterion may risk contrast-induced nephropathy ( CIN ) undergoing require CT contrast procedure . The investigator must mindful risk factor associate CIN employ strategy reduce risk CIN . In subject diabetes borderline renal function ( creatinine great 1.5 mg/dL ) special precaution ( e.g . hydration , contrast dose reduction , follow creatinine determination ) employ . An accepted procedure adequate intravenous volume expansion isotonic saline ( 1.0 - 1.5 mL/kg per hour ) 3-12 hour procedure continue 6-24 hour clinically indicate base treat physician 's medical judgment . All randomized subject follow safety overall survival .</detailed_description>
