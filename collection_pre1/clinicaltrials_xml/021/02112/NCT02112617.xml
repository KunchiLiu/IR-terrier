	<brief_summary>This research study evaluate therapy call proton beam radiation therapy ( PBRT ) possible treatment neuroblastoma . Neuroblastoma commonly occur around adrenal gland , locate top kidney . However , also occur area group nerve cell exist , area abdomen , neck near spine . Conventional radiation therapy photon use standard treatment many patient neuroblastic tumor . In research study , investigator look another type radiation call proton radiation know spare surround tissue organ unnecessary radiation . Proton radiation delivers radiation area require radiation . This may reduce side effect patient would normally experience standard radiation therapy mean deliver proton radiation therapy . In research study , investigator evaluate effectiveness use proton radiation deliver reduce side effect associate radiation treatment . The investigator also assess late side effect experience participant treatment group .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Phase II Study Proton Radiation Therapy Neuroblastoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Proton radiation deliver daily 3-4 week , depend dose prescribe study doctor . Treatment deliver ( Monday - Friday ) 5 day ( weekend holiday ) . Each treatment participant lie table 30-45 minute . The radiation therapy outpatient Massachusetts General Hospital . During radiation therapy , participant follow weekly assessment procedure : - Physical Exam - Assess side effect - Routine blood test ( weekly least every week ) Post-treatment Follow Up Visit ( ) : The participant ask return clinic 3-6 month last dose radiation therapy annually 5 year follow procedure : - Medical History - Physical Exam - Diagnostic Imaging - Assess side effect - Lung Function Tests ( require ) - MUGA ECHO ( require )</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Participants must histologically confirm neuroblastoma ganglioneuroblastoma elevate urinary catecholamine metabolite . If tumor tissue obtain , pathological review surgical specimen Massachusetts General Hospital DF/HCC institution require , preliminary report require prior enrollment . If tumor tissue obtain , urinary catecholamine metabolite require . Participants need measurable disease time radiation . Age ≥ 3 ≤ 25 year time diagnosis study evaluate disease entity pediatric population may differ adult population . Life expectancy great 12 month . ECOG performance status ≤2 ( Karnofsky ≥60 % , Lansky ≥60 % , see Appendix A ) . Diagnostic Imaging MRI and/or CT area treat within 8 week treatment . Baseline bone marrow biopsy bone scan ( 99mTcdiphosphonate MIBG scan ( 131IMIBG 123IMIBG ) time original diagnosis require . Because radiation know teratogenic , woman childbearing potential men must agree use adequate contraception ( hormonal barrier method birth control ; abstinence ) prior study entry duration study participation . Should woman become pregnant suspect pregnant participating study , inform treat physician immediately . Ability patient patient 's legal guardian understand willingness sign write informed consent document . Participants legal guardian must sign consent prior initiation radiation therapy . Patients ineligible prior therapeutic radiation therapy &gt; 500 cGy deliver . Patients ineligible chemotherapy complete ≥ 1 year plan start date radiation therapy patient refer radiation therapy relapse follow regimen chemotherapy alone . Individuals history different malignancy ineligible except follow circumstance . Individuals history malignancy eligible diseasefree least 5 year deem investigator low risk recurrence malignancy . Individuals follow cancer eligible diagnose treat within past 5 year : cervical cancer situ , basal cell squamous cell carcinoma skin . Pregnant female exclude . Women childbearing age/menstruating must negative pregnancy test prior initiation radiation therapy .</criteria>
