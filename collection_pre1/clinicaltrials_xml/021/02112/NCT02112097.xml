	<brief_summary>AUTOMATIC SUBDERMAL INJECTOR SYSTEM ( ASIS ) Corporation develop patent automatic injection system delivery injectable product optimum spot , outside fascia , exist subdermally ( skin muscle ) interfascial ( deeper muscle ) . ASIS device create bloodless space , enhance Enbrel 's efficacy prevent unnecessary distant spread adverse reaction . This space remain bloodless long skin lift fill injectable product . Although ASIS device initially design best administer BOTOX muscular condition Upper limb Spasticity , Cervical Dystonia , Chronic Migraine , Strabismus , Blepharospasm , Primary Axillary Hyperhidrosis , technology also benefit injectable product , include : GAMMAGARD Primary Immunodeficiency ( PI ) Insulin Diabetics , etc .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Over 6 month , Aim 1 demonstrate ASIS device consistently deliver injectable product ( e.g . Gadolinium ) subdermal bloodless space . MRI simple logical imaging choice , prefer ultrasound , air inject , dissipate quickly bloodless space allow measurement . Since n't way measure level Gadolinium within subdermal bloodless space , least Prolongation Gadolinium may approximate great longer Persistent % MRI . Also , since ca n't assume bloodless space patient particular disease behave way normal patient patient different disease , approximation work variable minimize particular skin affect Plaque Psoriasis . Case point , patient Plaque Psoriasis tend thicker skin , expectantly prolong Gadolinium subcutaneously Persistent % , may different disease certainly skin normal patient , Gadolinium subdermally Persistent % remain . Therefore , Relative Prolongation Ability Score total Persistent % subdermally total Persistent % subcutaneously , different specific particular skin affect Plaque Psoriasis . However , valuable indicator help u modify Enbrel dosage duration inject `` unknown '' subdermal space Aim 2 , `` know '' typical Enbrel dosage duration Plaque Psoriasis patient . For example , Aim 1 find Relative Prolongation Ability Score Plaque Psoriasis skin ( 2.00 ) , typical subcutaneously Enbrel 50mg every 3 day , 25mg every 6 day subdermally . Over 12 month , Aim 2 demonstrate advantage ASIS device inject subdermally versus subcutaneously , use Enbrel instead Gadolinium particular skin affect Plaque Psoriasis . Once show ASIS device 's consistent performance Aim 1 , may assume deliver another product ( Enbrel ) bloodless space without need measure Enbrel 's existent bloodless space . Using Enbrel instead Gadolinium , 'll demonstrate advantage inject subdermally intramuscularly affected skin sit 60 adult subject .</detailed_description>
