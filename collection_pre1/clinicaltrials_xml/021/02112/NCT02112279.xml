	<detailed_description>Background Clostridium-difficile ( C-difficile ) gram positive anaerobic spore-forming bacterium lead severe diarrhea pseudomembranous colitis . According Schroeder ( 2005 ) , approximately 3 million case annually mortality rate 1-2.5 % . It often associate overuse antibiotic . According Bartlett &amp; Gerding ( 2008 ) , 15-25 % anti-microbial-associated diarrhea cause C-difficile . The purpose study determine donor fecal microbiota transplant via colonoscopy reduces refractory C-difficile infection well current routine method continue antibiotic treatment . Specifically , hypothesize fecal microbiota transplant via colonoscopy result high C-difficile cure rate affect patient versus care usual retrospective cohort . Current concern C-difficile An increase C-difficile exposure hospital setting , especially immune compromised patient note . The long life C-difficile spores poor ability clean agent kill spore particular concern patient critical care oncology unit . In addition , although C-difficile consider hospital acquire disease , increase community acquire C-difficile infection last year . A concern express Muto , et al ( 2005 ) regard relationship unexpected outbreak C-difficile infection follow increase fluoroquinalone use . They find exposure levofloxacin independent risk factor C-difficile-associated diarrhea appear contribute substantially outbreak . They recommend restrict use levofloxacin implicate antibiotic control outbreak . In 2005 Center Disease Control ( CDC ) issue warn regard new , highly toxic strain C-difficile resistant fluoroquinalone antibiotic . A study Sethi , et al , ( 2010 ) , demonstrate difficulty eradicate C-difficile infection . In study fifty-two patient C-difficile , bacteria suppress undetectable level stool sample patient treatment . At 1-4 week treatment , 56 % patient sample test asymptomatic carrier C-difficile . They find skin contamination environmental shed C-difficile often persist time resolution diarrhea , recurrent shed common 1-4 week therapy ( 58 % skin contamination 50 % , environmental shed ) . Treatment fecal microbiota Microbiotas friendly , beneficial bacteria . Microbiotas produce essential nutrient short-chain fatty acid ; control epithelial cell growth ; prevent overgrowth infectious organism ; boost intestinal immunity ; prevent inflammation , diarrhea intestinal condition . This essential ecosystem provide important balance health disease body . The goal fecal microbial transplant re-establish fecal microbial homeostasis increase microbial diversity . Fecal microbiota transplant relatively new direction treat C-difficile infection ( CDI ) refractory accept antibiotic treatment . In retrospective medical record review 70 patient recurrent CDI undergone fecal transplantation perform via colonoscopy , Matilla , et al ( 2011 ) conclude fecal transplantation colonoscopy seem effective treatment recurrent CDI also recurrent CDI cause virulent C-difficile 027 strain . According systematic review literature , 317 patient treat across 27 case series report , intestinal microbiota transplant demonstrate disease resolution 92 % case . Among variable determine procedural success treatment prior procedure , relationship donor patient , route fecal microbiota instillation amount fecal microbiota solution deliver . ( Gough , Shaikh &amp; Manges , 2010 ) . A three-group study conduct 13 participant randomize group . Results demonstrate resolution rate C-difficile ( 81 % ) vancomycin group subsequent donor fecal transplant via nasoduodenal tube ; ( 31 % ) vancomycin group ; ( 23 % ) vancomycin bowel lavage group ; p &lt; 0.0001 ( van Nood , et al ; 2013 ) . In published report proceeding Canadian Working Group discuss issue fecal microbiota transplant , many important concern bring forward , include need donor screening , standardization donor fecal transplant material use biologic material un-approved drug ( Allen-Vercoe , et al , 2012 ) . These issue must address study ensure patient safety study reliability forefront determination effectiveness fecal transplant treat C-difficile infection refractory approve antibiotic treatment . Methods This study one-group convenience sample interventional study qualitative component . Recruitment Active recruitment involve one-to-one explanation in-patients community hospital out-patients present one study physicians care refractory C-difficile infection . Procedures I . Participants A . Patient : 1 . Patients must 18 year age old 2 . Patient must positive C. difficile test within 10 day prior procedure . 3 . Continued symptoms c-difficile infection 4 . Patients must fail least two course appropriate antibiotic therapy C. diff candidate procedure . 5 . Informed consent must obtain . 6 . All antibiotic must discount least 72 hour prior infusion . The patient may continue proton pump inhibitor ( PPIs ) use note pre- post- transplant . 7 . A standard colonoscopy prep give day procedure ( Laxative regimen clear liquid ) . 8 . Patient must provide clean , dry blender use blend stool mixture . The blender discard use re-used . B. Donor : Familial versus purchase donor stool 1 . The donor must 18 year age old . 2 . The closer relationship donor recipient well . Spouses partner , first degree relative , household member prefer . 3 . Donors must history Hepatitis B C , HIV , recent communicable disease , incarceration , high-risk sexual behavior , inflammatory bowel disease , gastrointestinal malignancy colon polyp . They may travel area know endemic diarrheal illness past 6 month , take antibiotic past 3 month reason , immunosuppressive drug chemotherapy . 4 . Donors must test negative Hepatitis B C HIV , stool specimen negative C. Difficile , Campylobacter , Salmonella , Shigella , ova parasite , pathogenic bacteria , giardia antigen cryptosporidium antigen within 10 day prior procedure . 5 . Informed consent must obtain donor . II . Setting A . A Gastroenterology Laboratory acute care 377-bed non-teaching hospital . III . Procedure A . Prior Procedure 1 . Verify physician order Bowel Recolonization Therapy ( Fecal Bacteriotherapy ) via colonoscopy . 2 . Stool donor must bring hospital approve container , receive hospital staff , label donor name , recipient name recipients medical record number send Endoscopy preparation procedure . ) The stool donor form adequate quantity . b ) The stool donor collect close time instillation possible , preferably within 6-8 hour procedure . 3 . Informed consent must obtain donor recipient . B . Preparation donor sample 1 . Personal protective equipment ( mask , eye protection , gown glove ) must wear throughout preparation procedure 2 . Blend stool non-bacteriostatic normal saline blender stool reach liquid slurry consistency . Add non-bacteriostatic normal saline desire consistency achieve . The stool blend approximate consistency milkshake . 3 . Filter stool solution sterile container 6 layer gauze pad , remove much particulate matter possible 4 . Large volume 300-700 ml use delivery colonoscope cecum terminal ileum . 5 . Container fecal slurry must label recipient identification information deliver immediately bedside instillation . C. Instillation via Colonoscopy 1 . Stool mixture administer terminal ileum cecum biopsy channel colonoscope patient sedate . 1 . Equipment : ( 1 ) 5 syrinx ( least 60 cc ) ( 2 ) K-Y jelly water-soluble lubricant ( 3 ) Chux pad ( 4 ) Exam gloves 2 . Complete hand hygiene . 3 . Verify correct patient use two patient identifier . 4 . Put glove place drape/chux patient buttock . 5 . Administer 300-700 ml slurry biopsy channel colonoscope piston syringe . 6 . Dispose leftover slurry toilet . Dispose waste . 7 . Remove glove complete hand hygiene . 8 . Document 1 . Date time procedure 2 . Amount fecal slurry administer . 3 . Results patient response procedure . 4 . Observe patient least 15-30 minute , VS stable . Measurement data collection 1 . All study patient keep stool diary 30 day follow transplant note number stool , time passage , character stool , change patient quality life . 2 . All study patient C. difficile toxin determination test 14 day 28 day procedure per physician order . C. difficile test may conduct use one three method : PCR , Illumegene , EIA . 3 . Recurrence C. difficile determine C. difficile test , sign symptom , well consistency stool produce . 4 . Study patient contact 7 , 14 28 day follow procedure concern . A self-addressed envelope provide study participant return complete post-procedures log research team 28 day . 5 . Records patient undergo procedure maintain research team secure location . Analysis Data analysis complete use measure central tendency raw percentage . Results post-procedure phone call patient log analyze use qualitative measure base phenomenology measure central tendency quantitative aspect .</detailed_description>
