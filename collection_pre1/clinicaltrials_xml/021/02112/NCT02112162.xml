	<brief_summary>This pilot clinical trial study gene expression analysis fludeoxyglucose F 18 ( FDG ) positron emission tomography ( PET ) /magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) evaluate treatment response patient rectal cancer spread nearby tissue lymph node undergoing chemotherapy radiation therapy surgery . Studying sample tissue laboratory may help doctor learn change occur deoxyribonucleic acid ( DNA ) may also help doctor predict patient 's response treatment surgery . PET-MRI procedure combine picture PET scan MRI scan . The combined scan give detailed picture area inside body either scan give . PET-MRI may help determine well people respond pre-surgery chemotherapy radiation therapy help surgeon make best plan removal tumor .</brief_summary>
