	<brief_title>The Role Timing Dexamethasone Administration Pain Scores Quality Recovery Cesarean Section .</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Dexamethasone , potent synthetic glucocorticoid minimal mineralocorticoid effect , commonly administer anesthesia adjunct prevention postoperative nausea vomiting ( PONV ) . Over last two decade analgesic effect dexamethasone also demonstrate treatment acute chronic pain . Two recent meta-analyses thirty randomize clinical trial ( close 5,000 subject ) conclude dexamethasone dose 0.1 mg/kg effective adjunct multimodal strategy reduce postoperative pain opioid consumption variety surgery . Cesarean section common surgical procedure associate moderate amount postoperative pain ( Visual analogue score ( VAS ) 3-5 , 10 point scale ) . Patients ' postoperative experience closely correlate perception pain management . Controlling postoperative pain cesarean section remain important clinical challenge . A multimodal approach reduce pain become standard care include vary dos intrathecal local anesthetic , intrathecal morphine , co-administration opioids adjuncts non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug acetaminophen . Dexamethasone typically administer elective cesarean section population prevention intrathecal opioid induce PONV . Recently however , potential benefit single dose dexamethasone demonstrate improve postoperative analgesia patient population . The analgesic effect dexamethasone post-cesarean section parturients likely mediate via anti-inflammatory action . This come surprise give profound inflammatory change associate peripartum period cesarean section . Until late third trimester . pregnancy think associate suppression variety humoral cell-mediated immunological function accommodate `` foreign '' semi-allogeneic fetal graft . The proinflammatory milleu becomes regulate late pregnancy around time delivery . Specifically , third trimester , percentage granulocyte cluster differentiation 8 ( CD8+ ) T lymphocytes significantly increase , along concomitant reduction percentage cluster differentiation 4 ( CD4+ ) T lymphocytes monocyte . During peripartum delivery period , leukocyte count may become markedly elevated , attain level 25,000/μL great . Moreover , circulate leukocyte undergo significant phenotypic change include upregulation adhesion molecule . Other marker inflammation include C-reactive protein , erythrocyte sedimentation rate ( ESR ) complement factor C3 C4 increase normal pregnancy significantly labour . Cesarean section cause significant surgical stress result profound inflammatory response . Inflammation trigger direct tissue injury surgical incision deeper tissue trauma also `` spillage '' highly pro-inflammatory mediator amniotic fluid placental tissue pelvic cavity well systemic circulation . As result inflammatory insult pregnancy cesarean section , dexamethasone emerge important adjunct postoperative pain control patient population . Unanswered , however , role time dexamethasone administration may play analgesic action . Dexamethasone peak effect delay 60-90 minute reflect unique pharmacodynamics . Unbound dexamethasone cross cell membrane bind high affinity specific cytoplasmic glucocorticoid receptor . This complex bind DNA element ( glucocorticoid response element ) result modification transcription protein synthesis . This lead inhibition leukocyte infiltration site inflammation , interference function mediator inflammatory response , suppression humoral immune response , reduction edema scar tissue . Direct anti-inflammatory action dexamethasone think involve phospholipase A2 inhibitory protein lipocortins ( control biosynthesis prostaglandin leukotrienes ) . This multistep mechanism action may explain administration dexamethasone prior stress surgery may optimize therapeutic effect include analgesia anti-emesis . However , vast majority study dexamethasone administer drug immediately prior surgery . The purpose randomized , double-blinded trial determine single dose dexamethasone give 45-60 minute preoperatively reduce VAS pain score improve quality recovery patient undergo elective cesarean section compare dose give immediately surgical incision .</detailed_description>
