	<brief_summary>Squamous cell carcinoma unknown primary ( SCCUP ) site metastatic cervical lymph node presentation relatively rare entity form 2 % head neck carcinoma . Typically patient treat ipsilateral modified radical neck dissection ( MRND ) post-operative radiotherapy ( PORT ) chemoradiotherapy . There lack consensus radiotherapy target volume treat neck dissection . The common radiotherapy technique either unilateral cervical lymph node irradiation achieve local control ipsilateral neck TMI head neck region aim eradicate primary microscopic neck disease . Treatment ipsilateral hemi-neck alone low toxicity may achieve local control cervical node . Potential occult primary site head neck mucosa , sub-clinical metastatic disease contralateral side neck leave untreated . If primary tumour subsequently become apparent previous radiotherapy may make radiotherapy difficult deliver . Some group recommend bilateral neck total mucosal irradiation set claim improved local control . With conventional radiotherapy technique price significant acute toxicity chronic morbidity , mainly xerostomia associate complication effect quality life ( QOL ) . Intensity modulate radiotherapy ( IMRT ) show reduce dose salivary gland tissue consequently may reduce incidence xerostomia improve quality life ( QOL ) head neck cancer patient . An analysis parotid-sparing IMRT University Michigan establish mean dose threshold stimulate ( 26 Gy ) , unstimulated ( 24 Gy ) saliva flow rate . For end-point ( less 25 % flow baseline one year post radiation ) Roesink et al establish TD50 39 Gy . The investigator perform plan study assess feasibility IMRT spare parotid gland deliver bilateral neck TMI . The mean dose contralateral parotid gland use IMRT threshold 24 Gy unstimulated salivary flow , predict fairly low risk radiation induce xerostomia . The mean dose ipsilateral parotid gland 32 Gy TD50 dose base Roesink data . This study assess safety tolerability deliver IMRT clinical practice treat patient SCCUP head neck region , require bilateral neck pan-mucosal irradiation .</brief_summary>
