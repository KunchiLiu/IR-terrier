	<brief_title>Mesenchymal Stem Cell Patients With Acute Severe Respiratory Failure</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Although advent advance medical support respiratory failure , mortality rate acute severe respiratory failure still report 40 % . The respiratory distress syndrome may develop age result progressive pulmonary fibrosis . A number survivor respiratory failure suffer sequela pulmonary fibrosis . However , treatment respiratory failure limit correction baseline disease , cardiopulmonary support , conservative management minimize lung injury . There effective specific treatment respirator distress medicine reduce mortality . There report mesenchymal stem cell experimental animal chronic obstructive pulmonary disease , interstitial lung disease , sepsis . In addition , mesenchymal stem cell treatment show beneficial effect bleomycin endotoxin induce lung injury . Authors hypothesize mesenchymal stem cell treatment patient respiratory failure show efficacy . We would conduct present pilot study evaluate efficacy safety patient respiratory failure intend suggest additional alternative treatment option without additional treatment option .</detailed_description>
