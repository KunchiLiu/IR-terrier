	<brief_summary>The purpose study compare immune response two different dos ( 1.0 mg 2.0 mg ) two different dose schedule ( two dos three dos ) mix Hantaan virus ( HTNV ) Puumala virus ( PUUV ) DNA vaccine healthy participant . To maintain blind , participant two-dose group receive one dose normal saline placebo . All group also receive booster dose 6 month first vaccination . The result help determine dose vaccination schedule best move forward vaccine development process .</brief_summary>
