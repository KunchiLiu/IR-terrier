	<brief_summary>The introduction surgical robot OR revolutionize number specialty ( i. e. urology , gynecology , digestive surgery ) . Robots currently use many situation list appropriate indication grow rapidly . There many potential advantage robotics eye surgery increase precision maneuverability , good ergonomics , improved patient access surgeon surgical training . As result , robotics might improve patient care . The Da Vinci© robot use 10 year experimental condition suture corneal laceration , perform corneal graft , remove ocular foreign body , lens capsule vitreous . The author report lack precision result poor visualization absence microsurgical instrument . These element consider hurdle clinical investigation . The new Da Vinci Si HD© robot available since 2009 IRCAD center recently Strasbourg University Hospital . It provide great magnification well resolution operative field previous model . We perform since 2012 various ocular surface surgery porcine eye IRCAD center . The aim present trial perform procedure ( amniotic membrane transplantation , pterygium surgery , corneal graft ) clinical set Da Vinci Si HD© system .</brief_summary>
