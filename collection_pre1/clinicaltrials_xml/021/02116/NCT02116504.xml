	<detailed_description>The ABIRISK ( Anti-biopharmaceutical Immunization : Prediction analysis clinical relevance minimize risk ) consortium , within IMI ( Innovative Medicines Initiative ) , Public Private Partnership pharmaceutical company , academic institution clinical center . The ABIRISK aim well analyze predict phenomenon immunogenicity order reduce occurrence . One main objective ABIRISK set prospective cohort ( ABI-RA ) patient rheumatoid arthritis ( RA ) juvenile idiopathic arthritis ( JIA ) provide , use integrated approach , new tool able detect earlier even begin therapy , immunization biopharmaceutical ( BP ) . The introduction BP critical step forward care RA/JIA 9 BP license treatment RA/JIA . In spite progress , failure response BP frequent registry , le 50 % patient still drug 5 year . These failure may primary failure secondary failure . The fact low level response become insufficient compare expectation . One main potential cause failure BP therapy response development Anti-drug Anti-body ( ADAb ) patient . ADAb may decrease efficacy BPs neutralize modify clearance may associate BP-specific hypersensitivity reaction . The prediction , prevention cure anti-drug ( AD ) immunization thus major goal BP development . This prospective study ( ABI-RA ) ass occurrence ADAb use standardize validated assay ( ) also cellular , genetic molecular parameter RA/JIA patient treat adalimumab , etanercept , infliximab rituximab tocilizumab , address mechanism immunogenicity .

	<criteria>Male female patient 18 year old diagnose RA accord 2010 ACR/EULAR criterion Or Male female patient Age &gt; 2 year &lt; 18 year , diagnose JIA accord Internal League Against Rheumatism ( ILAR ) classification criterion . Patient Treating Physician decide prescribe usual manner accordance term market authorization independently entry study : etanercept , adalimumab , infliximab , infliximab Biosimilar , rituximab OR tocilizumab first line failure biotherapy . In case previous rituximab , inclusion may possible least 6 month last rituximab infusion therapy , Subcutaneous form Tocilizumab , either first line switch infusion tocilizumab form allow . Having give write informed consent prior undertake studyrelated procedure . For JIA patient , write informed consent sign parent legal representative assent minor child Covered health insurance system applicable , and/or compliance recommendation national law force relate biomedical research Under administrative legal supervision . Patients previously antiTNF go receive another antiTNF therapy Patients previously receive rituximab past 6 month . Conditions/situations : Patients conditions/concomitant disease make non evaluable primary endpoint Impossibility meet specific protocol requirement ( e.g . blood sample ) Patient Investigator subinvestigator , research assistant , pharmacist , study coordinator , staff relative thereof directly involve conduct protocol Uncooperative condition could make patient potentially noncompliant study procedure Pregnant breastfeed woman</criteria>
