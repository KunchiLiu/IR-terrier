	<brief_summary>The purpose research study investigate loss muscle mass occur age . Tissue collect young subject compare previously collect tissue elderly subject , well previously collect data muscle function/mass investigate cellular molecular pathway recently show important age process muscle . The Principal Investigator ( PI ) study team look specific protein ( call biomarkers ) present muscle tissue various amount different individual . This study increase investigator understanding process muscle atrophy ( loss mass ) functional loss old age help find new treatment intervention aim improve quality life independence America 's rapidly expand elderly population .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>For project , continue gain mechanistic insight age-related muscle loss maximize utility tissue previously collect ( Claude D. Pepper Older Americans Independence Center ( OAIC ) ; Skeletal muscle apoptosis physical performance ; Oxidative RNA/DNA damage repair age human muscle ( Developmental Study ) , IRB # 429-2005 ) collect muscle tissue additional young subject . This project specifically test whether inflammatory pathway DNA repair mechanism alter and/or involve development sarcopenia related decline physical function observe elderly . Aim 1 . We determine association skeletal muscle mass function intramuscular mediator inflammation . Focus inflammatory protein ( e.g. , TNF , TNFR1 , pIkBα , pIKKb , CCL2 , ZIP14 , ZnT2 ) gene ( e.g. , IL-6 , TNFa , IL11β , IL-8 , CCL2 , CCR2 , NFkB p50 , NFkB p65 , ZIP14 ) metal ( e.g. , copper , zinc , iron ) . We hypothesize majority marker upregulated muscle old individual compare young . Aim 2 . For first time , determine age related effect DNA damage pattern dynamic mRNA translation human muscle tissue genome wide analysis use `` ribosome profiling . '' The recently develop deep-sequencing technique RNA-seq `` ribosome profiling '' implement human muscle . This allow u explore genomic scale single-nucleotide resolution , effect age-related DNA damage transcriptional fidelity translational kinetics . Importantly , first time , phenotype change compare genome mapping DNA damage , major factor drive mammalian age . We hypothesize old muscle great modification translational pattern compare young muscle . Muscle tissue sample remain follow completion research store used future explore new avenue research relate aging .</detailed_description>
