	<brief_title>Transcranial Direct Current Stimulation ( tDCS ) Depression Pregnancy : A Pilot Study</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Major depression serious condition affect 10 % pregnant woman , serious impact develop fetus . However current treatment less ideal woman moderate severe depression . Psychotherapy alone either ineffective , take month improve symptom , leave fetus susceptible depression time . Antidepressant medication effective , high refusal rate standard pharmacological treatment fear medication exposure . The highly negative impact depression pregnancy develop fetus child illustrate need evaluation timely innovative treatment . Transcranial direct current stimulation ( tDCS ) non-drug treatment depression dorsolateral prefrontal cortex , part brain function abnormally individual depress , directly stimulate without impact part body brain . As , ideal treatment pregnant woman want expose fetus impact medication treatment depression . It show effective depression among non-pregnant adult improvement see rapidly 3-week treatment course , almost 3 time faster standard psychological treatment . There know serious adverse effect theoretical risk fetus . This research study measure feasibility , acceptability compliance tDCS treatment option depression pregnancy . In addition , study investigate effect tDCS reduce depressive symptom immediately post-treatment among woman moderate severe depression pregnancy . In multi-centre , pilot randomize controlled trial , adult woman moderate severe depression pregnancy recruit one hospital obstetrical group two specialty perinatal mental health clinic course 1 year . Women offer start continue SSRI ( Selective Serotonin Reuptake Inhibitors ) SNRI ( Selective Serotonin-Norepinephrine Reuptake Inhibitors ) medication decline use . All participant continue receive clinical care respective clinical program trial . Although care may include psychotherapeutic intervention initiate prior completion active tDCS treatment phase ( clinic psychotherapy waitlist short ) , would expect see improvement within first 3 week psychotherapeutic treatment . As , ideal opportunity evaluate efficacy new treatment , without deprive woman non-pharmacological standard care . Following informed consent procedure , participant randomize tDCS sham-control condition ( 1:1 ) on-site treatment 5 day per week 3 week 30 minute session . The intervention active 2mA transcranial direct current stimulation ( tDCS ) . Direct current transfer pair saline soak sponge electrode ( contact area 5 x 7cm ) , deliver specially develop , battery driven constant current stimulator . The electrode place F3 F4 accord international system EEG ( Electroencephalogram ) placement . Sham stimulation administer use stimulation parameter site active treatment , current turn 30 second . Women interview baseline follow treatment , every four week delivery , four twelve week postpartum allow measurement depressive symptom , pregnancy , delivery , neonatal infant outcome . Although baseline treatment interview conduct person , post-treatment post-delivery interview offer person telephone , accord participant preference .</detailed_description>
