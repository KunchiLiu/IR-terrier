	<brief_summary>The antiphospholipid antibody syndrome ( APS ) syndrome associate excessive blood clotting ( thrombosis ) . APS among common cause heart attack stroke patient age 50 particularly prevalent patient autoimmune condition . Patients APS prior thrombosis require lifelong anticoagulant therapy prevent recurrent clot ; therapy currently provide warfarin . Warfarin require frequent bloodwork monitoring , many medication food alter effect , put people either increased risk clot bleed . Rivaroxaban new mediation prevents blood clot require bloodwork monitoring few interaction . This study pilot feasibility study : 1 ) examine ability identify 150 eligible APS patient ; 2 ) measure ability obtain consent 135 patient ; 3 ) test hypothesis obtain 95 % compliance daily rivaroxaban administration . The investigator propose treat eligible patient rivaroxaban 20 mg daily . Patients follow minimum one year rate bleed thrombosis monitor secondary outcome measure .</brief_summary>
