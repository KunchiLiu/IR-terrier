	<detailed_description>The immunosenescence complex profound remodel immune system life . It mainly due thymic involution repeat antigenic stimulation . Kidney disease associate decrease adaptive immunity evidence decrease vaccine response increase susceptibility infection , similar observe elderly population . However , data age immune system chronic kidney disease remain incomplete . Furthermore , determinant immunosenescence also know . It possible `` uremic '' factor help explain phenotypic functional change lymphocyte , antigenic stimulus associate repeat bio-compatible material use dialysis contact . The purpose study describe phenotype immune system renal analyze determinant change .</detailed_description>
