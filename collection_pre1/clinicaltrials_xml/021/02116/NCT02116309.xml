	<brief_title>Randomized Trial Rectal Indomethacin Papillary Spray Epinephrine Versus Rectal Indomethacin Prevent Post-ERCP Pancreatitis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Background : Post-ERCP pancreatitis ( PEP ) common complication endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography ( ERCP ) estimate incidence 3-7 % among average risk patient 15-20 % among patient high risk develop PEP . Around 500,000 - 700,000 ERCPs perform annually U.S . Even modest incidence 5 % , PEP result approximately $ 150 million healthcare cost US alone . A recent landmark control trial demonstrate superiority rectal nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drug - NSAIDs ( indomethacin ) placebo prevent PEP among patient high risk PEP . Also , epinephrine spray major duodenal papilla show reduce incidence PEP multiple study . Our group perform network meta-analysis ( NMA ) simultaneously compare 16 drug evaluate 99 randomize control trial 25,313 patient , determine relative efficacy use direct indirect comparison . Interestingly , NMA rank epinephrine best perform drug , follow rectal NSAIDs nafamostat . Indomethacin act pancreatic inflammation epinephrine spray duodenal papilla keep pancreatic duct open reduce papillary edema . The use drug combination may potentially synergistically reduce reduce incidence PEP . Hypothesis : A combination papillary spray epinephrine rectal indomethacin superior use rectal indomethacin alone , PEP prophylaxis among patient high risk PEP . Sample size justification : Based information earlier control trial , assume PEP incidence 10 % rectal NSAID arm ( Group A ) reduce 5 % additional use papillary spray epinephrine ( Group B ) . Therefore , total 474 patient arm , 948 patient total , require see 50 % difference group power 0.8 two side alpha 0.05 . Recruitment Consenting : Patients schedule undergo ERCP screen patient base inclusion / exclusion criterion consent , private wait area endoscopy unit . Randomization procedure delivery drug : During ERCP perform accord standard clinical care , endoscopist determines patient meet criteria 'high-risk ' , study coordinator randomize patient either group A B 1:1 fashion use web-based central randomization system . Randomization stratify center randomly vary block size use . The patient randomize either Group A - Patients receive 20 ml normal saline spray duodenal papilla surround region edema , period 1 minute use ERCP cannulation catheter , end procedure , withdrawal endoscope ; follow 100 mg rectal indomethacin OR Group B - Patients receive 20 ml 0.02 % epinephrine spray duodenal papilla surround region edema , period 1 minute use ERCP cannulation catheter , end procedure , withdrawal endoscope ; follow 100 mg rectal indomethacin . Statistical Plan : For statistical analysis primary end point , difference proportion PEP among two group calculate stratify site combine patient site , separate analysis . A two side p-value &lt; 0.05 consider statistically significant . The severity PEP , mortality complication relate PEP also compare among two group . The data risk factor PEP , incidence PEP use development PEP risk Data safety monitor board ( DSMB ) charter : An Independent DSMB , clinical trial monitor ( safety officer ) form consist five endoscopists India U.S. , expertise biostatistics clinical trial methodology . DSMB review study related documentation include limited , protocol , standard operating procedure , consent form , data entry form ; monitor study performance , ensure adherence good clinical practice guideline regulatory requirement ; make appropriate recommendation investigator . All adverse event , report safety officer study coordinator center . Blinded interim analysis perform 33 % 66 % sample size . If PEP incidence complication rate &gt; 25 % treatment group , DSMB break randomization code terminate study . During interim analysis , statistically significant difference find two group ( p &lt; 0.001 ) , study terminate ethical consideration .</detailed_description>
