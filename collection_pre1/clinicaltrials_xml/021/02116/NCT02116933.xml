	<brief_title>Grafting Autologous Adipose Stromal Cell Trial</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The purpose study objectively compare outcomes autologous fat graft breast augmentation stromal vascular fraction enhance autologous fat graft cosmetic breast augmentation carefully design study . Patients give option participate one two study : 1 . A small , level I study compare AFG SVF-enriched AFG patient . One breast treat AFG alone ( control ) breast SVF-enriched AFG ( experimental ) . 2 . A large , level II study compare AFG SVF-enriched AFG different patient . The patient either receive AFG alone breast SVF-enhanced AFG breast .</detailed_description>
	<criteria>Patients must consent write participate study sign date informed consent document indicate patient inform pertinent aspect study prior complete screen procedure . Female race , age 2165 . Patients must desire small breast augmentation ½1 cup size increase breast volume . ( If wish large breast size increase , must understand secondary procedure may require achieve size increase ) . Patients must normal physical exam breast mass , nipple discharge , fibrocystic disease , axillary adenopathy and/or history abnormal bleeding . Patients must pregnant lactate enrolled study must agree pregnancy test ( urine blood ) prior surgical procedure . The patient also try get pregnant course study . Patients must stable weight fluctuate weight ( otherwise distort volumetric measurement breast size post operatively , make impossible determine true augmentation volume SVFenriched AFG ) . Patients must also consent photographed procedure end study . All patient level I ( randomize ) level II ( nonrandomized ) part study must also consent undergo ultrasound image breast prior procedure procedure evaluate treat oilfilled cyst may arise due procedure . All patient level I ( randomize ) level II ( nonrandomized ) part study must also consent allow result include scientific research , scientific publication , presentation scientific meeting . All patient level I level II part study must also consent allow photo use publication scientific journal , internet website , patient educational material brochure , photo , patient education video . All patient study must also agree mammography do indicated procedure . All patient study must agree biopsy suspicious abnormality see mammography , ultrasound , MRI study . Patients must anemic time procedure ( Hg &lt; 10 ) . If anemic time enrollment , still include study anemia correct preoperatively iron supplementation . This must continue study avoid adverse reporting may relate procedure ( i.e . anemia cause SVFenriched fat grafting ) Patients must history abnormal bleeding surgery , bruise personal/family history coagulopathy . Patients must aspirin NSAIDs two week prior procedure normal blood coagulation panel within two week surgery : Pts &gt; 150K , PT ( INR ) &lt; 1.3 , APTT &lt; 1.3×control . Patients must normal renal function ( demonstrated Creatinine ≤ 1.5 mg/dl , ) urinary tract infection ( le 5 WBCs UA leukocyte esterase negative U/A Dipstick ) . If UTI present , patient may still enroll treat preoperatively If multigenerational family history breast cancer ovarian cancer present , surgical medical oncologist must evaluate patient obtain preoperative clearance provide reassurance need BRCA test . Patients prior radiation chest wall ( Hodgkin 's disease ) may include study . Patients positive pregnancy test Patients abnormal breast exam Patients bleed disorder anticoagulant Patients know positive BRACA1 BRCA2 gene mutation Patients anemic despite iron supplementation treatment underlie cause anemia . Patients unwilling mammographic test do procedure Patients Fibromyalgia , regional pain syndrome , chronic fatigue . Patients positive human immunodeficiency ( HIV ) , hepatitis B ( HBV ) hepatitis C ( HCV ) screen indicative current pas infection . Patients bleed diathesis Patients positive urinalysis pregnancy UTI . Patients whose diabetes adequately control ( HgA1c &gt; 7 ) . Patients history local anesthetic allergy . History , diagnosis , sign symptom clinically significant psychiatric disorder , include limit Severe psychological disease ( e.g . schizophrenia , manicdepressive disorder , severe depression , etc ) . Body dysmorphia syndrome , i.e. , anorexia , bulimia , etc . Somatoform disorder . Potential research participant substance abuse ( e.g . alcoholism , medical narcotic ( morphine , Vicodin , codeine , Percodan , etc . ) illicit drug , prescription medication without valid prescription , etc . ) within 2 year screen , tobacco habit . Alanine aminotransferase ( ALT ) aspartate aminotransferase ( AST ) ≥ 3.0 time upper limit normal , creatinine exceed 1.7 mg/dL ( 150 micromol/L ) men 1.5 mg/dL ( 133 micromol/L ) woman , hemoglobin ALC ≥ 10 % screening . Research participants receive immunosuppressant Cyclosporin A azathioprine within past six week Research participant anticoagulant stop correct . Use biologics , e.g . TNFinhibitors , adalimumab , etanercept , infliximab , include live vaccine within 3 month initial pain assessment period . Research participant take anticoagulant coumadin , fix dose , non fractionate heparin low molecular weight heparin ( Lovenox ) . Oral parenterally administer systemic corticosteroid within 30 day prior initial pain assessment period . Individuals largely wholly incapacitate , e.g . bedridden confine wheelchair , permit little selfcare . Pregnant woman , lactate mother , woman suspect pregnant , woman wish pregnant course clinical study . Research participants presently enrol clinical trial within past four week .</criteria>
