	<brief_summary>Lymphangioleiomyomatosis ( LAM ) rare lung disease mostly affect woman childbearing age . In LAM , abnormal , muscle-like cell begin grow control lung . As result , air ca n't move freely lung . In case , mean lung ca n't supply body 's organ enough oxygen . This study conduct find dose drug call saracatinib best tolerated people LAM . This drug test patient certain type cancer currently approve United States Food Drug Administration ( FDA ) . Saracatinib may work cancer prevent growth , movement invasiveness cancer cell . The use saracatinib treat LAM consider experimental . Preliminary test already complete suggests study drug , saracatinib , may suppress certain substance lung patient LAM thus may effective slow disease process</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Tuberous sclerosis complex ( TSC ) autosomal dominant disorder cause mutation tuberous sclerosis complex 1 ( TSC1 ) tuberous sclerosis complex 2 ( TSC2 ) tumor suppressor gene . TSC characterize tumor wide range tissue , seizure , mental retardation , autism , organ failure . Lymphangioleiomyomatosis ( LAM ) , major pulmonary manifestation woman TSC , progressive lung disease characterize infiltration atypical smooth muscle like cell formation cyst . The long term goal research devise novel therapeutic strategy patient LAM . Our preliminary data reveal increase active Src lung tissue patient LAM well laboratory cultured cell . The focus study examine Src inhibition represent potential therapeutic strategy LAM . In study , evaluate safety , tolerability Src inhibition subject LAM . The Quality Assurance ( QA ) plan put forth Manual Operations study . This study utilize service Data Coordinating Center ( DCC ) University Southern Florida . The data collect entered electronic clinical research form ( CRF ) site review site clinical research associate DCC data manager . Data check make throughout study 3 site patient enrol . Data check compare data enter registry predefined rule range consistency data field registry . Source data verification do ass accuracy , completeness , representativeness registry data . This do DCC Clinical Research Associate ( CRA ) . Each site receive copy general Manual Operations , Pharmacy Manual Operations Laboratory Manual Operations . Standard Operating Procedures address registry operation analysis activity , patient recruitment , data collection , data management , data analysis , report adverse event , change management . We apply standard set forth National Cancer Institute ( NCI ) , Common Terminology Criteria Adverse Events ( CTCAE ) version V 4.0 . Adverse event relate study medication tabulate body system severity use NCI CTCAE v4.0 . A dose-limiting toxicity ( DLT ) define CTCAE grade ≥3 toxicity despite adequate treatment consider investigator possibly related saracatinib treatment . A grade 3 adverse event define severe medically significant immediately life-threatening ; hospitalization prolongation hospitalization indicate ; disable ; limit self-care . Adverse event relate study medication tabulate body system severity use NCI CTCAE v4.0 . A dose-limiting toxicity ( DLT ) define CTCAE grade ≥3 toxicity despite adequate treatment consider investigator possibly related saracatinib treatment . A grade 3 adverse event define severe medically significant immediately life-threatening ; hospitalization prolongation hospitalization indicate ; disable ; limit self-care . Below example would consider DLT . Other grade 3 event evaluated investigator case-by-case basis determine drug relate . 1 . Allergic reaction : Prolonged ( e.g. , rapidly responsive symptomatic medication ; recurrence symptom follow initial improvement ; hospitalization indicate clinical sequela ( e.g. , renal impairment , pulmonary infiltrates ) 2 . Anaphylaxis : Symptomatic bronchospasm , without urticaria ; parenteral intervention indicate ; allergy-related edema/angioedema ; hypotension 3 . Anemia : Hgb &lt; 8.0 g/dL transfusion indicate . 4 . Neutrophil count decrease : &lt; 1000 - 500/mm3 5 . Lymphocyte count : severe decrease ( &lt; 500 - 200/mm3 ) increase ( &gt; 20,000/mm3 ) blood lymphocyte . 6 . Platelet count decrease : &lt; 50,000 - 25,000/mm3 7 . Nausea : Inadequate oral caloric fluid intake ; tube feeding , total parenteral nutrition ( TPN ) , hospitalization indicate . 8 . Vomiting : ≥ 6 episode ( separate 5 minute ) 24 hr ; tube feeding , TPN hospitalization indicate 9 . Diarrhea : Increase ≥ 7 stool per day baseline ; incontinence ; hospitalization indicate ; severe increase ostomy output compare baseline ; limit self care activity daily life . 10 . Pneumonitis : Sudden worsening shortness breath , reduction pulmonary function test , new interstitial infiltrates chest X-ray fever . As much possible data quality assess data entry point use intelligent on-line data entry via visual basic design screen form . Data element constraint , whether independent range and/or format limitation 'relative ' referential integrity limitation , enforce method employ data input . QA report ass data quality post-data entry . As note , data quality begin design data collection form procedures incorporates reasonable check minimize transcription omission error . Of important quality assurance measure internal validity check reasonableness consistency . - Data Monitoring : The DCC identifies miss unclear data generates data query consortium administrator contact . - Data Delinquency Tracking : The Data Coordinating Center monitor data delinquency ongoing basis . Phase 1b study require 9 15 evaluable subject . Assuming 20 % drop rate 20 % screen failure , target enrollment 9-21 subject . As primary analysis , safety data generate study analyzed generate optimum range dose utilized Phase 2a study . The secondary endpoint summarize help detail evaluation Phase 2a study . Deviations protocol allow . It responsibility study site use continuous vigilance identify report protocol deviation . Upon determination protocol deviation occur , study staff ) notify Principal Investigator , b ) notify Project Manager c ) complete Protocol Deviation form . The Principal Investigator complete sign Protocol Deviation form submit site Institutional Review Board ( IRB ) , per IRB regulation . Major protocol deviation report Data Safety Monitoring Board . The Investigation New Drug ( IND ) sponsor also inform responsible notifying FDA .</detailed_description>
