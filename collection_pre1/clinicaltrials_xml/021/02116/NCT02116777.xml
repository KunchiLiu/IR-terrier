	<brief_summary>This phase I/II trial study side effect best dose talazoparib temozolomide see well work treat young patient tumor respond previous treatment ( refractory ) come back ( recurrent ) . Talazoparib may stop growth cancer cell block enzymes need cell growth . Drugs use chemotherapy , temozolomide , work different way stop growth cancer cell , either kill cell , stop dividing , stop spread . Giving talazoparib together temozolomide may work well treat young patient refractory recurrent malignancy .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Talazoparib Temozolomide Treating Younger Patients With Refractory Recurrent Malignancies</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To estimate maximum tolerate dose ( MTD ) and/or recommend Phase 2 dose ( RP2D ) temozolomide combine dose BMN 673 ( talazoparib ) give daily 5 day one day dose BMN 673 administer orally ( either daily twice daily ) , every 28 day child refractory recurrent solid tumor . ( Phase I ) II . To define describe toxicity BMN 673 give temozolomide administer schedule . ( Phase I ) III . To characterize pharmacokinetics BMN 673 temozolomide give combination child refractory recurrent cancer . ( Phase I ) IV . To define antitumor activity BMN 673 give temozolomide recurrent/refractory Ewing sarcoma recurrent acute lymphoblastic leukemia ( ALL ) . ( Phase II ) SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . To preliminarily define antitumor activity BMN 673 temozolomide pediatric patient recurrent refractory solid tumor within confines Phase I study . II . To explore possible predictive biomarkers archival tumor tissue Ewing sarcoma patient Phase II . OUTLINE : This phase I , dose-escalation study follow phase II study . Patients receive talazoparib orally ( PO ) daily ( QD ) twice daily ( BID ) day 1-6 temozolomide PO QD day 2-6 . Treatment repeat every 28 day 24 course absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . After completion study treatment , patient follow 30 day .</detailed_description>
