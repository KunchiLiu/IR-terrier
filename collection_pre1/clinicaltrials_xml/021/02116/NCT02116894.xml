	<criteria>1 . Histologically and/or cytologically confirm radiographically evaluable refractory metastatic colorectal adenocarcinoma regorafenib would consider therapeutic option . 2 . Disease must measurable RECIST 1.1 criterion ( see Appendix 1 ) . 3 . Age ≥ 18 year . 4 . ECOG 0 1 . 5 . Life expectancy least 3 month . 6 . Adequate bone marrow function show : 1 . ANC ≥ 1.5 x 109 2 . Platelets ≥ 100 x 109/L 3 . Hemoglobin ≥ 9 g/dL ; Erythropoietin transfusion support permit provided treatment require every 8 week . Hemoglobin must stable equal 9 g/dL least 2 week prior day 1of study drug without blood transfusion maintain hemoglobin level . 7 . Adequate liver function show : 1. serum bilirubin ≤ 1.5x ULN 2 . PT/PTT/INR ≤ 1.5x ULN 3 . ALT AST ≤ 2.5x ULN 8 . Adequate renal function : creatinine clearance ( estimate ) ≥ 50 cc/min Cockroft Gault 24 hour urine ( see Appendix 6 ) . 9 . Women childbearing potential ( WOCBP ) must negative serum pregnancy test within 7 day day 1 study drug ; men woman must willing use two method contraception , one barrier method study 6 month last study drug administration . 10 . Signed informed consent . 11 . Presence archive tumor sample ( size requirement ) . 1 . Prior regorafenib use disease progression ( expanded cohort ) . 2 . Prior failure tolerate regorafenib 120 mg/day . 3 . Patients currently receive anticancer therapy receive anticancer therapy within 28 day day 1 study drug ( include investigational agent , chemotherapy , radiation therapy , antibody base therapy , etc . ) 4 . Patients : 1 . Have major surgery significant traumatic injury within 4 week day 1 study drug , 2 . Have recover side effect major surgery ( define require general anesthesia ) 3 . Are anticipated require major surgery course study . 5 . Patients exhibited hypersensitivity reaction regorafenib and/or structural compound , biological agent , formulation ( eg sorafenib ) . 6 . Grade 34 AE associate prior antiVEGF therapy . Grade 3 hypertension readily manage permit . 7 . History grade 3 high hypersensitivity reactions/anaphylaxis attribute humanized and/or chimeric monoclonal antibody protein . Hypersensitivity reaction clearly relate cetuximab may permit discretion principal investigator . 8 . Patients receive chronic , systemic treatment corticosteroid another immunosuppressive agent follow exception : 1 . Intermittent steroid ( exceed 4 mg every day ) may use asneeded basis ( e.g . treatment chemotherapyrelated nausea , anorexia fatigue . ) 2 . Patients physiologic replacement dos steroid due adrenal insufficiency reason may remain medication . 3 . Topical , inhale intraarticular corticosteroid 9 . Active brain leptomeningeal metastasis , include patient continue require glucocorticoid brain leptomeningeal metastasis . Treated , asymptomatic metastasis permit provided patient steroid least 1 month prior day 1 study drug . 10 . Severe chronic obstructive pulmonary disease hypoxemia ( require supplementary oxygen , symptom due hypoxemia O2 saturation &lt; 90 % pulse oximetry 2 minute walk opinion investigator physiological state likely cause systemic regional hypoxemia . 11 . Presence poorly control atrial fibrillation ( ventricular heart rate &gt; 100 bpm ) 12 . Previous history CVA , TIA , angina pectoris , acute MI history recent reperfusion procedure ( e.g . PTCA ) , pulmonary embolus untreated deep vein thrombosis ( DVT ) within 6 month day 1 study drug . NOTE : Subjects recent DVT therapeutically anticoagulated least 6 week eligible . 13 . Known significant active CAD PVD CVD define abnormal stress test , symptom , require medication prevention symptom . 14 . Congestive heart failure ( New York Heart Association ( NYHA classification , see Appendix 4 functional classification IIIIV ) . 15 . Proteinuria screen demonstrated urine analysis ( UA ) &gt; 1+ 24 hour urine protein ≥ 1 gram/24 hour . 16 . Patients severe and/or uncontrolled medical condition condition could affect participation study judge treat physician . Examples include limited : 1 . Severely impaired lung function ( e.g . use home O2 , history Idiopathic Lung Disease ( ILD ) , evidence ILD scan . 2 . Active ( acute chronic ) severe infection require treatment I.V . antibiotic . 3 . Liver disease cirrhosis , chronic active hepatitis chronic persistent hepatitis . 4 . Poorly control hypertension [ define systolic blood pressure ( SBP &gt; 140 mmHg diastolic blood pressure ( DBP ) &gt; 90 mmHg ] NOTE : Initiation adjustment antihypertensive medication ( ) permit prior study entry . Following antihypertensive medication initiation adjustment , blood pressure ( BP ) must reassess three time approximately 2minute interval . At least 24 hour must elapse antihypertensive medication initiation adjustment BP measurement . These three value average obtain mean diastolic blood pressure mean systolic blood pressure . The mean SBP/DBP ratio must &lt; 140/90 mmHg order subject eligible study . 17 . Impairment gastrointestinal function gastrointestinal disease may significantly alter absorption oral medication ( e.g. , ulcerative disease , uncontrolled nausea , vomit , diarrhea , malabsorption syndrome small bowel resection ) . 18 . Significant vascular disease ( e.g. , aortic aneurysm require surgical repair recent peripheral arterial thrombosis ) within 6 month prior day 1 study drug 19 . History hemoptysis ( great equal 1/2 teaspoon bright red blood per episode ) significant spontaneous bleed event within 1 month prior day 1 study drug time prior VEGF inhibitor . 20 . History abdominal fistula gastrointestinal perforation point within 6 month prior day 1 study drug , unless surgically repair . 21 . Active peptic ulcer disease , inflammatory bowel disease ( e.g . ulcerative colitis , Crohn 's disease ) , gastrointestinal condition increase risk perforation gastrointestinal bleeding . 22 . Use need full dose anticoagulation low molecular weight heparin Factor Xa inhibitor ( e.g . Lovenox , Fondaparinux ) bleeding risk . 23 . Serious , nonhealing wound , active ulcer , untreated bone fracture judge treat physician . 24 . Active bleeding diathesis . 25 . Known endobronchial lesion and/or lesion infiltrate major pulmonary vessel increase risk pulmonary hemorrhage . 26 . Known history HIV Hepatitis B C seropositivity . 27 . Female patient pregnant breast feeding , adult reproductive potential use effective birth control method . Two acceptable form contraceptive must continue throughout trial either sex 2 month ( 60 day ) follow last dose either drug . Hormonal contraceptives acceptable sole method contraception . ( Women childbearing potential must negative serum pregnancy test within 7 day prior day 1 study drug ) . 28 . Concomitant use CYP3A4 strong inducer strong inhibitor . ( See Appendix 7 ) . 29 . Corrected QTc interval &gt; 500 msec . If QTc interval &gt; 500 msec , 2 additional ECGs obtain brief period time ( e.g. , within 1520 minute ) confirm abnormality . The average QTc interval determine 3 ECG tracing manual evaluation use determine subject exclude study . The method QTc determination must use throughout subject 's participation trial . 30 . History OslerWeberRendu syndrome Hereditary Hemorrhagic Telangiectasia 31 . Patients unwilling unable comply protocol .</criteria>
