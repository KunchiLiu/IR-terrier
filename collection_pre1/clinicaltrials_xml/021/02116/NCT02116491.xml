	<brief_summary>BACKGROUND : The investigator develop fiber-optic-guided endotracheal suction catheter ( visual sputum suction system VSSS ) , investigator previously test vitro animal . It integrate 0.9-mm micro-imaging fiber 3.7-mm double-lumen catheter . PURPOSE : The purpose study investigate safety efficacy sputum suction system mechanical ventilate patient respiratory intensive care unit ( RICU ) . The investigator compare weight secretion collect , vital sign , tracheal wall injury two group patient randomize VSSS combine closed system suction ( CSC ) suction patient CSC suction alone . HYPOTHESIS : The investigator theorize VSSS collect sputum cause less change vital sign conventional CSC .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Visual Sputum Suctioning System Tests Mechanically Ventilated Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Study design : This randomize control trial study , include patient ventilate one respiratory intensive care unit ( RICU ) . Two suction system ( The novel VSSS conventional CSS alone ) compare time point ( baseline ) , immediately , 3 min , 5 min suctioning . Background : Sputum suction routine clinical procedure crucial keep airway open , reduce incidence respiratory-tract infection . In circumstance , conventional catheter single-lumen channel use sputum suction . However , procedure Involves blind manipulation catheter part clinician thus depend largely clinician 's skill experience . Therefore , complication occur patient , especially change parameter heart-lung system . In addition , clinician directly target sputum trachea , efficiency procedure may reduce . Recently , visual sputum suction system ( VSSS ) develop research group . It integrate 0.9-mm micro-imaging fiber 3.7-mm double-lumen catheter . In vitro test investigator find ability visualize airway allow target sputum , compensate small lumen make suction procedure efficient overall . In addition , animal test investigator find VSSS collect sputum cause less tracheal mucosa damage conventional suctioning . Purpose : The present study investigate safety efficacy sputum suction system double-lumen catheter mechanical ventilate patient respiratory intensive care unit ( RICU ) . The purpose study compare weight secretion collect , vital sign , tracheal wall injury two group patient randomize VSSS combine closed system suction ( CSC ) suction patient CSC suction alone . investigator theorize VSSS collect sputum cause less change vital sign conventional CSC . Registry procedure : All request information record case report form explanation report miss data . False data clearly correct , sign investigator authorize person . Monitoring realize co-investigator association clinical research associate . Sample size assessment : Number subject : 40 patient . Three month necessary include patient . Statistical analysis : Investigators determine 20 patient per group would provide power 95 % , α level 5 % . Results express mean ± Standard Deviation . SPSS 10.0 ( Chicago , Illinois , USA ) statistical calculation use . P value &lt; 0.05 consider statistically significant . Investigators use nonparametric test normally distribute data , nonparametric Wilcoxon-Mann-Whitney rank test data.Investigators use repeated-measures analysis variance four time point ( suction , immediately suction , 3 min suctioning , 5 min suction ) analyze change difference PaO2 , heart rate , mean arterial pressure .</detailed_description>
