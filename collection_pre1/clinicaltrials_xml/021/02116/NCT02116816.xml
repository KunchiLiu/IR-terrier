	<brief_summary>This study consist two part . The first part study look absorption three different polyphenol preparation blood , variability absorption whether absorption could enhance mix pollen shell . For purpose 12 healthy volunteer recruit . All participant receive 3 supplement without mix pollen shell total 3 test . For test six blood sample take 8 hour period . Urine sample also collect . Oligopin select first study . The second part study aim look effect Oligopin endothelial function assess vascular tone function healthy volunteer use non-invasive , direct measurement vasodilatory capacity ( EndoPAT ) . Nitrate nitrite measurement , well blood pressure measurement , also record provide clear clinical assessment effect preparation ( ) upon vascular function . The effect Oligopin compare placebo ( methylcellulose-filled capsule ) allow robust assessment clinical effect . A total 24 healthy volunteer recruit study .</brief_summary>
