	<brief_title>Incisional Hernia Adhesion-Related Bowel Obstruction</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The relationship type approach occurrence incisional hernia remain unclear . This single center , prospective observational cohort study conduct evaluate characteristic outcomes incisional hernia regard impact incision site length adhesion-related bowel obstruction , open laparoscopic colorectal surgery . Primary endpoint - Incisional hernia bowel obstruction rate within two year colorectal surgery , either clinically and/or radiologically detect . Participants - Patients schedule elective colorectal operation ask informed consent outpatient clinic hospital day surgery . All patient follow strictly control protocol regard bowel preparation , antibiotic prophylaxis , postoperative care . On day hospital discharge , patient ask blinded investigator fill Hospital Experience Questionnaire ( HEQ ) . Outpatient clinic follow-up - Each patient contact phone call need e-mail postal mail , concern incisional hernia , small bowel obstruction , Body Image Questionnaire ( BIQ ) 1st , 12th 24th month operation . Incisional hernia assess use validated questionnaire phone call . This questionnaire contain item concern site , treatment recurrence incisional hernia . And patient contact emergency department complaint relate bowel obstruction among appointment , information would also record questionnaire . As part routine care , outpatient clinic visit relate primary disease need operation , patient assess physical examination concern incisional hernia , BIQ 1st , 12th 24th month operation . Incisional hernia could diagnose clinically , radiologically , accord symptom report patient . During visit , patient ask wound problem ( infection , dehiscence , incisional hernia ) clinical symptom relate bowel obstruction ( abdominal pain , nausea , vomit , abdominal distention , obstipation ) . The Hospital Experience Questionnaire ( HEQ ) - In questionnaire , patient ' satisfaction throughout pre- post-operative period evaluate . The HEQ include question complication , pain , length hospital stay , time span resumption normal diet , return daily activity ( Dunker MS , Surg Endosc 1998 ; 12:1334-40 ) The Body Image Questionnaire ( BIQ ) - Consists ten item evaluate body image cosmesis surgery . Body image cosmetic scale measure patient 's satisfaction physical appearance ( Dunker MS , Surg Endosc 1998 ; 12:1334-40 ) . Incisional hernia define `` abdominal wall gap without bulge area postoperative scar perceptible palpable clinical examination imaging '' . All sit hernia consider : midline incision , Pfannenstiel ( transverse ) , trocar site , specimen extraction site ileostomy closure site . Incisional hernia occur patient laparoscopic group ultimately need laparotomy conversion postoperative complication within 30 day postop analyze open group . Reoperation define return operate theatre ( RTT ) intra-abdominal procedure wound complication index admission , subsequent admission hospital within 28 day initial resection . Conversion open operation define performance conventional midline laparotomy , abdominal incision great size initially need specimen retrieval . Early postoperative fascial dehiscence distinguish later incisional hernia , define clinically palpable gap abdominal fascia , without wound dehiscence , first 30 day surgery . The distinction make patient required re-intervention , preclude long-term follow-up incisional hernia . Bowel obstruction define base accepted clinical radiologic criterion , include abdominal pain , distension , nausea , vomit , obstipation , distend bowel loop air fluid level , evident abdominal X-ray . The datasheet password-protected , principal investigator co-investigators access information . Red-Cap ( Research Electronic Data Capture ) application also use monitor protect data . Sample size calculation - Sample size calculation base study publish Duepree et al . Cleveland Clinic 2003 [ 3 ] . With 2-sided significance level 0.05 power 80 % , difference 10 % incidence incisional hernia laparoscopic open colorectal surgery , sample size 140 patient per group calculate . The number increase 160 patient per group upon take account estimate rate 10 % patient lose follow-up . Incidence incisional hernia expect 5 % laparoscopic approach 15 % open surgery . Statistical Analysis - All patient analyze intention-to-treat basis . Significance determine p &lt; 0.05 level ( 2-tailed ) . Differences baseline characteristic evaluate use Fisher 's exact test categorical variable Wilcoxon rank sum test continuous ordinal data . Using set preoperative operative risk factor independent variable development incisional hernia dependent variable , logistic regression analysis conduct , primary outcome define presence incisional hernia incision extraction site within 24 month operation . Hernia rate relation observation time estimate use Kaplan-Meier life-table method compare via log rank test .</detailed_description>
