	<brief_summary>This research do investigate new technique biopsy pancreas lead large amount tissue material analyze . Investigators call technique `` corkscrew '' technique believe allow obtain large biopsy sample endoscopic ultrasound examination . The corkscrew technique use clockwise rotational movement drive needle pancreatic mass ( like wine bottle opener twist buries cork ) . It believe lead well biopsy sample usual way therefore result high chance diagnosis .</brief_summary>
