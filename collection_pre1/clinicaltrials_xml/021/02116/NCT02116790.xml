	<brief_summary>Findings investigator 's lab others ' show involvement brain 's mesolimbic circuitry pain perception evaluation , well transition acute chronic pain state human animal . Dopamine ( DA ) one main neurotransmitter circuitry , possible could intimate role pain processing , chronicity , related anatomical functional neuroplasticity . In study , investigator first need know combination l-dopa Naproxen safe efficacious human acute pain , , dos . For present study , healthy pain-free participant inject small bolus capsaicin subcutaneously induce acute cutaneous inflammatory pain . Capsaicin ideal study cause characteristic inflammatory response almost always accompany pain , well-validated dose-response curve , effect go away completely hour administration , cause permanent damage study subject . Effects capsaicin measure change ( decrease ) baseline thermal tactile threshold , well verbally report cutaneous pain level ( scale 0-10 ) . Participants also give study medication form placebo , one drug , combination drug capsaicin injection allow analgesic effect peak pain onset . For receive active medication , either receive Naproxen placebo combination naproxen l-dopa ( latter one two different dos ) . This allow investigator investigate ( 1 ) whether co-administration naproxen l-dopa analgesic effect low level acute pain human , ( 2 ) combination pain-alleviating , whether equally efficacious naproxen , clinical standard treatment , finally ( 3 ) dose provide analgesia .</brief_summary>
