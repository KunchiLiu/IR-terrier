	<brief_summary>Zinc important metal maintenance healthy skin wound heal . Washing detergent e.g . shower gel may deplete zinc store skin . The purpose study see whether repeat wash zinc contain shower gel superficial wound result increase healing .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Zinc Gel Epidermal Regeneration Healthy Human Volunteers</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Zinc trace element abundantly present skin concentration gradient upper stratum corneum layer basal layer . This fact probably reflect necessity zinc co-factor numerous enzyme involve skin homeostasis wound healing . Theoretically , shower surfactant increase loss zinc shed zinc-rich corneocytes . Thus concern force exfoliation result suboptimal zinc level maintenance physiological process involve epidermal homeostasis repair . A logical development would thus supplement shower gel zinc compensate loss . In 30 healthy volunteer one epidermal wound ( 10 mm diameter ) induce suction heat buttock . The wound wash shower gel contain zinc , placebo shower gel water ( reference ) . The treatment allocate randomization ensure 20 wound wash shower gel contain zinc , 20 wound wash placebo shower gel 20 wound washed water .</detailed_description>
