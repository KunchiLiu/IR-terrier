	<brief_summary>AIM : To develop standardize cost effective methodology algorithm mRNA E6/E7 HPV genotypes 16 , 18 , 31 , 33 45 compare commercially available assay incorporate triage excess false positive primary screen cervical cancer Objectives : 1 . Development standardization methodology /algorithm mRNA E6/E7 test HPV genotype 16 , 18 , 31 , 33 45 use Real-time RT-PCR , cervical sample . 2 . To compare test performance HPV E6/E7 mRNA assay HPV DNA HC 2 secondary screen test , reference standard colposcopy biopsy , triage woman find positive primary screening VIA , population base screen cancer cervix . 3 . To determine number false positive primary screen test test VIA positive know high specificity secondary screen test ( HPV-DNA HC II ) compare HPV E6/E7 mRNA test . Study Population : Women age group 30-65 year , test positive primary cervical screen test VIA enrol propose diagnostic test along reference standard colposcopy guide biopsy . Methodology : Women age group 30-65 year undergoing routine cervical cancer screen hospital ( Preventive Oncology screen clinic ) community base screen program abnormal test result use primary cervical cancer screen test VIA recruit study . The primary screening test VIA administer application 5 % Acetic Acid cervix visualize cervix help halogen focus lamp .

	<detailed_description>AIM : To develop standardize cost effective methodology algorithm mRNA E6/E7 HPV genotypes 16 , 18 , 31 , 33 45 compare commercially available assay incorporate triage excess false positive primary screen cervical cancer . Objectives : 1 . Development standardization methodology /algorithm mRNA E6/E7 test HPV genotype 16 , 18 , 31 , 33 45 use Real-time RT-PCR , cervical sample . 2 . To compare test performance HPV E6/E7 mRNA assay HPV DNA HC 2 secondary screen test , reference standard colposcopy biopsy , triage woman find positive primary screening VIA , population base screen cancer cervix . 3 . To determine number false positive primary screen test test VIA positive know high specificity secondary screen test ( HPV-DNA HC II ) compare HPV E6/E7 mRNA test . Study Population : Women age group 30-65 year , test positive primary cervical screen test VIA enrol propose diagnostic test along reference standard colposcopy guide biopsy . Study Site : Women test positive primary screen test VIA referral diagnostic test TMH enrol study propose diagnostic test along reference test tertiary care facility , Dept . Preventive Oncology , Tata Memorial Hospital Mumbai . Sample Size To detect statistically significant difference test characteristic 95 % confidence limit , 80 % statistical power alpha =0.05 , require around 180 case cervical intraepithelial neolplasia study . With demonstrated prevalence around 2 % detect high grade CIN lesion urban rural community base cervical screening programme , need enroll around 9,000 woman population base cervical cancer screening , get 180 case cervical intraepithelial neolplasia Methodology : Women age group 30-65 year undergoing routine cervical cancer screen hospital ( Preventive Oncology screen clinic ) community base screen program abnormal test result use primary cervical cancer screen test VIA recruit study . The primary screening test VIA administer application 5 % Acetic Acid cervix visualize cervix help halogen focus lamp . VIA consider positive definite acetowhite lesion visualize close squamocolumnar junction . Criteria positive VIA test present : Positive VIA test : 1 . Opaque , dense , dull , definite , well defined aceto white lesion , touch squamocolumnar junction close external o . 2 . Strikingly dense acetowhite area columnar epithelium . 3 . Condyloma Leukoplakia occur closer squamocolumnar junction turn intensely white application acetic acid . 4 . Growth cervix turn acetowhite . The screened woman test Screen Positive primary screen test VIA become eligible recruitment study . Screen positive woman outreach community screen program refer TMH ( Preventive Oncology screen clinic ) diagnostic verification . Participant Recruitment The study participant recruit Hospital ( Preventive Oncology screen clinic ) community base screen programme Mumbai . Medical Social Workers explain detail purpose study participant attend screen clinic . Apparently healthy woman age group 30-65 yr intact uterus past history cervical neoplasia become eligible participate programme . If fulfilling inclusion criterion give , write informed consent vernacular language ( either Hindi Marathi ) obtain participant unique participant identification number assign eligible woman . Information socio demographic reproductive variable collect use detailed questionnaire . Demographic , reproductive sexual history data record screen follow informed consent.. Screen positive woman test presence oncogenic HPV type Hybrid Capture-II ( HC-II ) HPV E6/E7 mRNA test diagnostic test . In addition two test screen positive woman also receive Colposcopy guide cervical biopsy , reference gold standard test . Colposcopy perform trained doctor colposcopy impression note along punch biopsy aceto white area cervix detect primary screening test VIA . Biopsy specimens fix 10 % formalin process report pathology laboratory Tata Memorial Centre . The reference standard final disease status histology . Post Test Counseling : At end test procedure post test counsel do Doctor Medical Social Worker explain significance result test procedure perform . The importance follow visit understand result HPV/ mRNA E6/E7 cervical biopsy explain woman . Follow Treatment : Treatment opportunistic reproductive tract infection ( RTI ) provide . Women High grade lesion ( cervical precancers ) HSIL recommend seek treatment cryotherapy LEEP ( Loop Electrosurgical Excision Procedure ) cold knife conization Tata Memorial Centre Mumbai . Total Project Period : Three year : Proposal submission , training , participant recruitment , data collection analysis , include follow-up case end enrollment period</detailed_description>
