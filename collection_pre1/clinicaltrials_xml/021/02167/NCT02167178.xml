	<brief_summary>Although major surgery often require treat abdominal problem , significant risk death complication follow operation . By use ultrasound amount time fluid patient receive operation optimise risk surgery reduce . However , little know exact change blood flow small vessel body response fluid . A great understanding may allow appropriate care patient undergo type surgery future . In study healthy volunteer attempt good understand fluid administration guide ultrasound effect blood flow large small vessel , use two different technique ultrasound image . A narrow bore ( approximately 4-5mm diameter ) ultrasound probe pass nostril mouth rest within oesophagus allow measurement blood flow main artery , second probe rest volunteer 's abdomen use record change blood flow small liver blood vessel . Comparison two technique administration fluid allow u good understand relationship large small vessel blood flow . Because different type fluid may behave different way , test effect two type fluid commonly use clinical practice ; ` normal ` saline solution gelofusine .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>The Relationship Between Cardiac Output Microvascular Visceral Blood Flow</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Optimizing intravascular volume cardiac output essential ensure adequate organ perfusion patient undergo major surgery . To enable cardiac output frequently monitor operation use variety technique ; one technique trans-oesophageal Doppler ultrasound also know oesophageal Doppler monitoring ( ODM ) . ODM measurement cardiac output less invasive technique many currently use method , recently recommend NICE adoption clinical practice . The match microvascular blood flow , cardiac output fluid administration advantageous visceral organ , marry demand oxygen nutrient delivery . However , although evidence suggest intraoperative ODM direct fluid administration improve outcome perioperative period , reduce hospital stay complication , little direct evidence optimization cardiac output via ODM improve microvascular blood flow visceral organ frequently compromise major surgical intervention . A great appreciation effect ODM guide fluid replacement delivery blood hence oxygen nutrient vital organ could help development refine algorithms fluid administration clinical set future . In clinical physiology laboratory regularly employ contrast-enhanced ultrasound ( CEUS ) use Phillips iU22 , visualize microvascular blood flow healthy young elderly men follow variety physiological challenge . This minimally invasive ultrasound base imaging technique ideal gain insight effect various physiological intervention tissue blood flow could readily use chart change visceral microvascular flow follow ODM guide fluid optimization . Transference investigative approach clinical set potential greatly improve care surgical patient require fluid resuscitation . Different type intravenous fluid use clinical practice . These primarily crystalloid solution , 0.9 % sodium chloride ( ` normal ` saline ) , colloidal suspension , gelofusine . There good experimental evidence colloid gelofusine produce great effect cardiac output equivalent volume saline , unclear effect replicate microvasculature . We test hypothesis : ( 1 ) cardiac output stroke volume measure ODM determinant visceral microvascular blood flow ( 2 ) visceral microvascular blood flow elderly individual closely determine stroke volume ( 3 ) gelofusine produce great increase microvascular blood flow volume normal saline .</detailed_description>
