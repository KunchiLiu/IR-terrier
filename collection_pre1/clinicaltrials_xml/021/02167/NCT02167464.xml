	<brief_title>Controlling Blood Pressure Treatment Resistant Hypertension : A Pilot Study</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This Comparative Effectiveness Research conduct real world under-resourced primary care clinic South Carolina . Four arm study identify two clinics/arm enrol follow patient TRH . The goal compare rate BP control accord AHA guideline among 4 arm , along clinic patient satisfaction approach . Our hypothesis define pathophysiological mechanism ( e.g . renin treatment-guided therapeutic ) without referral hypertension specialist improve blood pressure control add aldosterone antagonist eligible patient refer patient hypertension specialist . This mixed-methods design capture medical qualitative data describe outcome blood pressure control , assess impact four intervention staff patient satisfaction . Key patient data include demographic , visit , blood pressure value , medication laboratory data . Focus group discussion practice staff study document early attitude toward arm , practice change need implement arm burden intervention practice . Patient survey interview assess satisfaction intervention along experience participate research project . Treatment Resistant Hypertension common medical condition , relatively ineffective treatment regimens significant contribute factor . The long-term goal establish practice effective approach control blood pressure reduce clinical complication relate health disparity .</detailed_description>
