High intensity interval training ( HIT ) program use short episode high intensity exercise also show improve fitness . These HIT programme also show improvement functional capacity quality life patient chronic disease . An advantage HIT improvement fitness may occur short time traditional endurance training . It also know HIT give superior gain endurance training . The primary aim study determine whether improvement aerobic fitness , judge 2ml/kg/min increase VO2peak , achieve within 31 day via HIT programme , group healthy elderly volunteer . As secondary aim ass whether programme would acceptable group study , determination subject compliance adherence training programme .</brief_summary>
