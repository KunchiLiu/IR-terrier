	<brief_summary>Based upon current state science , investigator propose conduct randomize clinical trial participant randomize post-surgery either BIS circumferential ( tape ) measurements follow-up arm measurement . When patient BIS group L-Dex change ≥10 unit higher pre-surgical baseline measure , patient tape measurement group volume change at-risk arm ≥ 5 % &lt; 10 % pre-surgical baseline ( without similar change non-at-risk arm ) , receive four week 23-32 mm compression sleeve gauntlet therapy .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The treatment lymphedema follow breast cancer therapy typically burdensome multi-modality process entail different degree intensity depend severity fluid accumulation . In breast cancer survivor , commonly initiate visible swell occurs limb . Common treatment utilized multi-modality include massage , compression , exercise , skin care . The current gold standard treatment advance fluid accumulation complex decongestive physiotherapy ( CDP ) . CDP include component compression , lymphatic drainage , skin care , exercise commonly deliver two phase first phase several week course deliver outpatient clinical set second home maintenance program . CDP consider gold standard due prospective data demonstrate efficacy , series 537 patient find significant arm volume decrease CDP subsequent study confirm volume reduction along improve quality life patient undergoing CDP . Studies compare CDP treatment modality limit favored CDP . CDP limit access long term prospective follow-up treatment may take place require significant resource cost . Recent study suggest early diagnosis treatment allow less burdensome aggressive therapy utilization move forward . Increasing data support idea early intervention improve outcome woman lymphedema follow breast cancer treatment . Recent prospective data show short course compression therapy ( sleeve gauntlet ) , range 4 6 week , rate progression fluid accumulation limit . Specifically , Stout Gergich et al . study provide sound preliminary data support four week treatment use 20-30 mmHg compression garment gauntlet , 18 month post intervention follow-up , reduce volume prevent need CDP . These finding encouraging ; however , note study significant limitation include small patient number , limit follow , lack randomization , lack subclinical detection increase extracellular fluid . Therefore , data exist suggest early intervention clinically apparent extracellular fluid accumulation beneficial , less data support hypothesis subclinical detection subsequent early intervention beneficial . Based data study , may possible prevent chronic lymphedema early detection intervention . Early detection may best achieve identifying change extracellular fluid instead change whole arm volume . Given potential improve patient outcome possibly prevent chronic lymphedema , additional research warrant large randomized trial address limitation previous work . BIS technology design identify change extracellular fluid . The investigator propose determine subclinical detection increase extracellular fluid via BIS subsequent early treatment four week compression sleeve gauntlet result reduction rate progression chronic lymphedema compare intervention initiate use common arm measurement method ( tape measurement ) . The investigator secondarily explore selective correlative relate lymphedema lymphedema progression . As multiple factor may lead lymphedema , influence potential risk factor lymphedema progression evaluate . Time actual progression also examine . Because lymphedema result problematic symptom diminish quality life , correlatives use validated instrument also examine .</detailed_description>
