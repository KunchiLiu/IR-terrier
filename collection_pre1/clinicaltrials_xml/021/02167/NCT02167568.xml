	<brief_summary>Corpus callosum agenesis dysgenesis ( CCA ) major brain malformation ( ˜1/4000 birth ) presently diagnose prenatal ultrasonography . In half case , CCA associate anomaly ( complex CCA ) , usually lead medical abortion . Syndromes include CCA many ( hundred ) , also associate intellectual deficiency ( ID ) . Several gene involve complex CCA . On hand , several study point favorable cognitive outcome individuals/fetuses apparently isolate CCA ( ICCA ) pregnancy 70 % case . However , still 30 % case ID developmental delay . The precise incidence severity disorder presently unclear . Therefore , prenatal counseling couple face prenatal diagnosis ICCA still elusive . Our aim unravel genetic cause CCA combine phenotypic genetic analysis prospective cohort patient CCA intellectual disability , order improve prenatal information .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Corpus callosum main midline brain structure connect homologous cortical area hemisphere . Corpus callosum agenesis dysgenesis ( CCA ) diagnose antenatally , either isolate associated cerebral extra-cerebral malformation . With incidence 1.8/10,000 newborn , CCA often associate chromosomal anomaly mendelian syndrome . Even CCA appear isolated , neuro-developmental outcome uncertain , many child develop normally , others moderate learn disability even severe ID . The genetic heterogeneity complex CCA large ( CCA observe 300 entity ) , many patient , etiological diagnosis know . Therefore , genetic counselling remain challenge many case . Recurrence observe almost 5 % case , patient etiological diagnosis , disease sporadic . These data suggest recessive dominant de novo inheritance . This study aim , prospective cohort 120 patient CCA intellectual disability : 1 . To determine nature frequency characterize genetic abnormality . 2 . To determine phenotypic spectrum complex CCA 3 . To perform SNP-array analysis ( ) patient without etiological diagnosis ( ii ) patient identify syndrome without molecular basis clarify genetic basis CCA evaluate contribution technique patient 4 . To describe new clinical- genetic entity Patients recruit pediatric neurology genetics consultation reference competence center `` intellectual disability rare cause '' associate network call `` DéfiSciences '' . The workup include patient : 1. clinical examination neurologist clinical geneticist , child psychiatric care need 2. blood sample patient parent 2.3. neuropsychological assessment need 3.4 . Cerebral MRI use new technology ( diffusion , track fiber spectroscopy ... ) , available Central review brain MRI perform referent neuroradiologist order classify type CCA , morphological feature associate brain abnormality . 4.5 . Several additional test could perform necessary : a. search associate malformation i. renal ultrasound ii . echocardiogram iii . bone x-rays iv . ophthalmological examination b. search neurological/sensorial dysfunction : neurophysiological assessment ( electroencephalogram , brainstem evoke auditory potential , somatosensory evoked potential , electroretinogram visual evoked potential ) c. Karyotype d. Molecular biology : ARX ( boy ) XFRA e. Metabolic test comprise least plasma CK , chromatography plasma amino acid , chromatography urine organic acid , redox cycle , urinary creatine guanidinoacetic acid assay Bratton-Marshall test ; After initial assessment , investigator core clinical/research team discus case validate propose diagnosis determine whether secondary assessment complementary genetic study need . Patients without establish diagnosis benefit study use whole genome chip ( Illumina SNP-array ) conduct end recruitment period second year project . This work improve essential clinical genetic knowledge CCA , necessary improve assessment prognosis prenatal diagnosis genetic counseling . It also expect expand understand complex development corpus callosum function .</detailed_description>
