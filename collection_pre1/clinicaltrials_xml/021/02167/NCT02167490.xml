The aim prospective randomize study : - verify whether , presence negative preoperative axillary assessment , SLN spar - verify whether , presence negative preoperative axillary assessment , decision adjuvant medical treatment take accord biology tumour without prognostic information achieve SLNB nodal status - verify whether , presence negative preoperative axillary assessment , patient ' quality life improve less invasive surgical procedure .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Sentinel Node Vs Observation After Axillary Ultra-souND</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Sentinel lymph node biopsy ( SLNB ) standard approach axillary staging patient breast cancer worldwide . The evident trend breast cancer treatment go towards minimize axillary surgery , even presence involvement sentinel lymph node ( SLN ) . In fact , well know removal lymph node perform stag purpose improve regional control curative intent . Recent data prospective randomize trial compare axillary dissection vs. axillary surgery presence positive SLN show difference term overall disease-free survival . Moreover , date impact prognostic information axillary lymph node status decision-making process less important past adjuvant treatment tailor biological feature disease rather risk recurrence . This prospective randomized control trial patient small breast cancer ( T &lt; 2 cm ) , negative preoperative assessment axilla ( ultra-sound FNAC presence doubtful finding ) randomize two treatment arm : - SLNB Â± axillary dissection - No axillary surgical staging In arm 1 , axillary dissection perform case either negative SLN presence isolate tumour cell micrometastases . SLNB complete axillary dissection presence macrometastases diagnose SLN . The aim prospective randomize study : verify whether , presence negative preoperative axillary assessment , SLN spar verify whether , presence negative preoperative axillary assessment , decision adjuvant medical treatment take accord biology tumour without prognostic information achieve SLNB nodal status verify whether , presence negative preoperative axillary assessment , patient ' quality life improve less invasive surgical procedure . Endpoints The primary endpoint study distant-disease free survival . This endpoint , proxi overall survival , allow reliable result short period time compare overall survival . Secondary endpoint cumulative incidence distant recurrence , cumulative incidence axillary recurrence , disease free survival ( DFS ) overall survival ( OS ) . Other secondary endpoint quality life evaluation type adjuvant treatment administer . Sample size calculation statistical consideration We consider woman undergo SLNB reference group , test non-inferiority group woman undergo treatment axilla . For purpose sample size calculation , 5-year DDFS reference group assume 96.5 % . Overall , 1560 woman ( 780 per arm ) enrol decide whether group without treatment axilla bad reference group , give margin delta non-inferiority 2.5 % ( maximum tolerable 5-years DDFS = 94 % ) . Statistical power one-sided type I error set 80 % 5 % , respectively . After 3 year start accrual interim safety analysis perform . Standard survival analysis survival analysis compete event perform . Multivariable Cox regression model apply adjust risk estimate interest variable . The Chi-square test trend , Chi-square test Fisher exact test use evaluate difference percentages two treatment group , appropriate . The T-tests use evaluate difference mean continuous variable .</detailed_description>
