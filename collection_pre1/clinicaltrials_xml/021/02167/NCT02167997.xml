	<brief_title>EffectiveNess SAfety Small ANeurysm COiling Trial</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This prospective cohort study whereby patient undergo endovascular treatment coil intracranial aneurysm study initial procedural 12-18 month post-treatment outcome . The procedural failure rate ( define ) treat small aneurysm specially design coil compare pre-specified historical occurrence . This evaluation occur within framework `` non-inferiority '' ( i.e . comparable success coil large aneurysm ) .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Patient presenting rupture unruptured cerebral aneurysm appropriate endovascular treatment determine neurovascular team ( neurosurgeon/neurointerventionalist ) Patients ( include ) 18 90 year age . Patient HUNT AND HESS Grade 03 . Where require , patient give fully inform consent endovascular coiling procedure . If patient consent , appropriate write consent seek surrogate , appropriate power attorney . Aneurysm &lt; 4mm maximum diameter . Patient willing able return clinical evaluation followup image evaluation ( angiography MRA ) 6months 1218 month endovascular treatment . The aneurysm previously treat ( coil clip ) . A threedimensional angiogram perform . Placement least one `` Nano '' coil , , least close neck aneurysm . Patient one aneurysm require treatment current treatment session . If patient multiple aneurysm , one treat time enrollment , eligible trial . ( Additional aneurysm may treat later date , may treat coil type operator choose ) . Patient H &amp; H score 4 5 subarachnoid hemorrhage ( SAH ) . Medical surgical comorbidity patient 's life expectancy le 1 year . Less 80 % length Stryker endovascular coil implant .</criteria>
