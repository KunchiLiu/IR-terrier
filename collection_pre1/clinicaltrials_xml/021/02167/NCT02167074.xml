	<brief_title>A Multicenter Trial , Comparing 25G EUS Fine Needle Aspiration ( FNA ) Device With 20G EUS ProCore Fine Needle Biopsy ( FNB ) Device</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Endoscopic ultrasound ( EUS ) -guided tissue acquisition emerge valuable method diagnose stage malignancy . During Endoscopic Ultrasound ( EUS ) , tissue sample obtain pathological evaluation different device . Fine needle aspiration ( FNA ) provide cytological specimen . Unfortunately , cytological specimen , inflammatory change may undistinguishable well-differentiated dysplasia . Moreover , neoplasms lymphoma stromal tumor , tissue architecture cell morphology essential accurate pathological assessment . Therefore , pathologist generally prefer histological specimen . Fine needle biopsy ( FNB ) advantage obtain histological specimen , may lead good diagnostic performance . However , FNB needle stiffer difficult handle , complicate tissue acquisition . In addition , superiority histology cytology EUS-guided tissue sample proven yet . For instance , tissue , obtain FNA process new cell-block technique , may equal diagnostic yield histological tissue core . A recent meta-analysis suggest 25G optimal FNA needle size obtain adequate cytological specimen . In study , aim compare property merit newly design , flexible , 20G EUS ProCore FNB device conventional 25G EUS-FNA device .</detailed_description>
