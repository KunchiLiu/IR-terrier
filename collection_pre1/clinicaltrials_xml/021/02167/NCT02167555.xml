	<brief_title>Characterization Wild Blueberry Polyphenols Bioavailability Kinetic Profile Over 24-hour Period</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This study randomize , single blind , 2-arm , within-subjects , placebo-controlled design utilize multiple sampling , repeat measure paradigm characterize bioavailability kinetic profile wild blueberry polyphenols . A planned sample size 12 enrol study . This study require one initial screen visit , one pre-study visit , 2 study visit . This study take approximately 3-4 week per subject complete . The initial screening visit provide subject inform consent document determine subject eligibility anthropometric measurement , vital sign , fast blood glucose test ( finger prick ) , completion survey relate general eating , health , exercise habit . If willing eligible participate , 3-day food record ( 2 weekday 1 weekend day ) instruct Screening Visit collect Pre-study visit ass subject ' baseline dietary intake pattern . Subjects instruct follow strictly limit polyphenolic diet 7 day prior study throughout participation time , maintain usual diet pattern physical activity , counsel staff investigator and/or Registered Dietitian . A dinner meal provide day study visit control second meal effect food beverage intake night study visit . Subject arrive center fast state least 10 hour , well hydrate rest . Each study visit require blood draw throughout visit . After evaluation subject 's health status ( via anthropometric , vital sign blood glucose measurement in-person interview ) , register nurse place catheter subject 's arm purpose multiple blood sample collection take initial blood draw fast state . Subjects randomize receive placebo wild blueberry beverage treatment base randomize treatment sequence 2 study visit along 3 standard meal ( breakfast , lunch dinner ) . The sequence receive beverage treatment visit randomly assign one two follow sequence : placebo-wild blueberry wild blueberry-placebo . Each study visit involve blood sample collection time point 0 ( fast ) , 0.25 , 0.5 , 1 , 1.5 , 2 , 3 , 4 , 5 , 6 , 7 , 8 , 9 , 10 24 hour ( h ) assessment change plasma metabolites wild blueberry polyphenols influence metabolic inflammation marker . Also , urine sample collect prior study treatment baseline void 6 time period , 0 2 h , 2 4 h , 4 6 h , 6 8 h , 8 10h 10 24 h study visit ass wild blueberry polyphenolic metabolite .</detailed_description>
