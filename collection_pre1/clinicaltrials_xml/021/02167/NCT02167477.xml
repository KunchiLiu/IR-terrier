	<detailed_description>The aim 40 patient complete protocol . This number base recent similar study Aintree hospital number case successfully use make multiple parameter comparison different videolaryngoscope blade Ear Nose Throat ( ENT ) procedure . Following template earlier work patient three laryngoscopy assessment . When see preoperative clinic , patient inform study give patient information sheet take home . On day admission surgery ask consent involve study study researcher . Prior theatre , research team make number straightforward external measurement . Various surface marking around head neck patient apply immediately proceed operate theatre . In anaesthetic room , prior induction anaesthesia , patient standard monitor attach ( include oxygen saturation , electrocardiograph non-invasive blood pressure ) . They position usual anaesthetist charge case . The monitoring laryngoscopy comprise : 1 . Video-camera record one metre away side patient 's head neck . 2 . Photographic still shots moment laryngoscopy foot bed/trolley . 3 . View laryngoscopy via optical system C-MAC® video laryngoscopes The photograph take foot bed/trolley note lateral rotation head position laryngoscopy . Should occur may need allowed process photographic overlay analysis process lateral image . The anaesthetic technique standardise . After 3 min pre-oxygenation face mask , anaesthesia induce Remifentanil ( technique administration decide individual anaesthetist ) , Propofol 1.5-2.5 mg/kg neuromuscular blockade Rocuronium 0.6 mg/kg airway manipulation . Bag mask ventilation 100 % oxygen volatile anaesthetic perform prior three laryngoscopy assessment . The patient monitor closely adverse sign , point oxygen saturation fall 90 % patient withdrawn study anaesthesia continue deemed appropriate responsible clinician . During laryngoscopy anaesthetist indicate moment maximal laryngoscopic view obtain record video device . In case Macintosh , observe percentage glottic opening POGO score document . If inadequate view find clinician may one attempt improve view cricoid pressure record . The conventional Macintosh laryngoscope always use first laryngoscopy . The sequence second third laryngoscopies decide block randomisation . Tracheal intubation undertaken final laryngoscopy . A shaped metallic stylet place within tracheal tube intubation aid patient intubated C-MAC® D-BLADE video laryngoscope . Following intubation , endoscopic examination posterior wall pharynx undertaken videolaryngoscope withdrawn ensure trauma cause intubation . Following intubation , patient continue anaesthesia surgery plan . There monitor patient closely recovery post-operatively part normal clinical care . Off-line data analysis consist superposition videolaryngoscope blade shape outline lateral photographic image . The POGO score compare preoperative measurement relevant result overlay image analysis .</detailed_description>
