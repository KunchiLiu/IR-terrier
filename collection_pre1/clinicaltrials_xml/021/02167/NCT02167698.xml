	<brief_summary>This study attempt study new ventilation mode child Acute respiratory distress syndrome ( ARDS ) . Despite decade research , intervention bring significant decrease ARDS mortality . Moreover , study adult-based extrapolated child . Airway pressure release ventilation ( APRV ) mode hypothesize superior term low need sedation , short duration mechanical ventilation , etc . It unique first worldwide randomize control trial APRV mode child . We plan recruit minimum 50 child age ( 1 month-12 year ) group . The study conduct Post-Graduate Institute Medical Education Research ( PGIMER ) , Chandigarh March 2014 March 2016 . This trial would recruit child respiratory failure early ARDS , randomize receive either conventional ventilation APRV mode . Rest supportive care also protocolized group receive treatment per exist best practice every aspect . The primary outcome study number ventilator-free day . The secondary outcome include length PICU stay , hospital stay , organ-failure free day , 28 day &amp; 3 month survival , biomarkers lung injury ( IL-6 , IL-8 , Angiopoeitin-2 , soluble-ICAM-1 , etc ) , functional status , Pulmonary function test , etc . Funding request would send Indian Council Medical Research , New Delhi , India . Assessing lung biomarkers like Interleukin-6 would assess role different mode ventilation act trigger multi-organ dysfunction well worsen lung injury . This pathbreaking research likely open new avenue upon completion .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Study setting : 15-bedded pediatric intensive care unit ( PICU ) multi-specialty , tertiary referral teach hospital- Advanced Pediatrics Centre ( APC ) Post-Graduate Institute Medical Education Research ( PGIMER ) , Chandigarh , India Study period Recruitment : January 2014 December 2016 Data Analysis : Jan 2017 June 2017 Study design An open-labelled , parallel-arm , efficacy/feasibility randomize controlled trial Ethics approval Ethics approval obtain Institute Ethics Committee . The study register Clinical Trials Registry - India ( CTRI ) ( ctri.nic.in ) . Informed consent obtain parents/legal guardian conversation would record use camera ( audio-visual documentation evidence ) . Sample size estimation Assuming alpha error 5 % power 80 % non-inferiority limit 4 day ( Standard deviation VFDs 8.2 day conventional low tidal volume ventilation group pilot trial ) , sample size calculate 52 per group . As safety feasibility trial , interim analysis would do 50 % enrolment . Enrolment Parents legal guardian child satisfy eligibility criterion invite investigator participate study . Parents free participate , withdraw study point time . All child , irrespective enrollment study , receive standard pediatric intensive care unit ( PICU ) care per unit 's exist protocol . An information sheet ( Hindi/ English ) furnish detail study provide parent . Given fact child sedate mechanical ventilation , obtain assent would feasible study . Randomization Sequence generation A computer-generated , unstratified , block randomization variable block size perform determine group allocation . A person involve study perform random number allocation prepare opaque , seal envelope contain allocation . Concealment allocation Each pre-sealed opaque envelope would open obtain write consent audio-visual record . As randomization do use variable block size , prepared statistician directly involve study , would way predict random allocation , thus minimize risk allocation bias . Randomization implementation After parent provide informed consent , randomization would do within next one hour child initiate appropriate mode ventilation . The supportive care group , would per attach supplementary protocol Intervention protocol : The Airway pressure release ventilation ( APRV ) intervention protocol design base available APRV literature Dec 2013 . Start child APRV mode ventilation follow setting : - P HIGH would determine degree baseline lung inflation . A rough estimate obtain base plateau pressure requirement conventional mode ventilation . Perform inspiratory hold ascertain plateau pressure : - If P plateau &gt; 30 cm water , set P HIGH 30 cm water - If P plateau &lt; 30 cm water , set P HIGH 1-2 cm measure P plateau . - Alternatively , P plateau measure , P HIGH set accord follow guide : PaO2/ FiO2 ratio P High &lt; 250 15-20 &lt; 200 20-25 &lt; 150 25-28 After initiate particular P HIGH , clinical assessment lung volume need followed chest radiograph determine degree lung inflation ( similar set Mean airway pressure High frequency oscillatory mode ventilation ) . The child 's P HIGH adjust maintain optimal lung volume , without clinical radiological evidence hyperinflation : sign decrease cardiac output/ hypotension and/or level diaphragm visible great ninth rib . - Start T High 4 second ; Titrate T High base oxygenation status . At least 80 -95 % total cycle time spend T High . - Set P Low Zero cm H2O - Set T Low expiratory flow decrease 25 % peak expiratory flow rate ( PEFR ) ; usually 0.1-0.8 second . The ratio T-PEFR PEFR target near 75 % . This entity need titrate every 2-4 hour may shorten lung injury advance . - Set Pressure Support ZERO - The number breath per minute number release function T High T Low depict : Weaning APRV would also carry structured , protocolized manner . The following strategy would adopt : 1 . As child 's clinical condition oxygenation index improve , Fraction inspire oxygen level bring 0.6 , T HIGH increase step 0.5-2 second till 10-12 second . 2 . P HIGH subsequently decrease step 2-3 cm H2O till value 12-16 reach . Decrease P HIGH carry early feature hyperinflation ( clinical/radiological ) appear point . 3 . The goal reach pressure level 12-16 cm H2O switch Continuous positive airway pressure ( CPAP ) 6-8 cm H2O , child extubated directly nasal prong CPAP gradually taper CPAP Endotracheal-T piece subsequently extubated depend overall clinical status .</detailed_description>
