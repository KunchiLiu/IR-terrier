	<brief_summary>Evidence support use two dimensional video analysis ass presence dynamic knee valgus generally use screen task , however limited evidence support use various smart phone application time money save option clinic use . Subjects present clinic display dynamic valgus knee lateral step test give option participate study . If consent study evaluate 2-Dimensional video analysis determine amount valgus present knee lateral step test . The subject also smart phone attach low leg amount valgus concurrently measure select application . The primary objective study determine validity application smart phone provide objective measure dynamic knee valgus . The secondary objective study determine possibility use application source feedback neuromuscular re-education training order decrease eliminate subject 's dynamic valgus collapse subsequently decrease risk future injury .</brief_summary>
