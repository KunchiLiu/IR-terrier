	<criteria>Age ≥ 18 year Willing able comply schedule visit , treatment plan laboratory test , include biopsy Patients histologically cytologically confirm diagnosis breast cancer . Patients must metastatic HER2+ disease . Documented HER2+ breast cancer define : 3+ IHC amplification situ hybridization ratio ≥ 2.0 ; result local lab acceptable . Eligibility affect hormone receptor status . For doseescalation phase , PIK3CA mutation also require . MSKCC outside documentation acceptable . There upper limit prior chemotherapy , target therapy , endocrine therapy . HER2+ patient must receive pertuzumab TDM1 ( adotrastuzumab emtansine ) prior trial enrollment . unless deem ineligible therapy , exception list : Patients metastatic breast cancer receive prior pertuzumab eligible : heavily pretreated prior FDA approval pertuzumab ( 6/8/2012 ) firstline treatment HER2+ MBC Patients metastatic breast cancer receive adotrastuzumab emtansine eligible : heavily pretreated prior FDA approval adotrastuzumab emtansine ( 2/22/2013 ) treatment patient HER2+ MBC previously receive trastuzumab taxane separately combination For doseescalation phase , measurable nonmeasurable disease per RECIST criterion v1.1 permit . For dose expansion phase , patient must measurable disease RECIST v1.1 . Patients must archive tumor specimen available unless pretreatment biopsy perform . If pretreatment biopsy perform , availability archive specimen must still assess collect available . ECOG performance status 01 Adequate organ function , define follow : i. Hematologic parameter : 1 . Absolute neutrophil count ( ANC ) ≥ 1500/μl ( without growth factor support ) 2 . Platelets ≥ 100,000/μl ( platelet transfusion allow within 2 week ) 3 . Hemoglobin ≥ 9.0 g/dl ( may reach transfusion ) ii . Liver function : 1 . Serum bilirubin ≤ 1.5 x upper limit normal ( ULN ) unless attributable Gilbert 's syndrome 2 . AST ≤ 2.5 x ULN , ≤ 5 x ULN liver metastases present 3 . ALT ≤ 2.5 x ULN , ≤ 5 x ULN liver metastases present iii . Kidney function : 1 . Creatinine ≤ 1.5 x ULN iv . Coagulation function : 1 . INR ≤ 1.5 v. Endocrine function : 1 . Fasting plasma glucose &lt; 140 mg/dl ( may antiglycemic agent insulin ) . Fasting glucose measurement must obtain least 8 hour recent caloric intake . Ability swallow oral medication Willing discontinue herbal preparation / medication least 7 day prior first dose study drug throughout study . These include , limited , St. John 's wort , Kava , ephedra ( huang ) , gingko biloba , dehydroepiandrosterone ( DHEA ) , yohimbe , saw palmetto , ginseng . Negative serum pregnancy test woman childbearing potential within 2 week study . Patients untreated symptomatic metastatic central nervous system ( CNS ) disease . However patient CNS involvement may participate : i. Clinically stable respect CNS tumor time screen &gt; 4 week prior therapy completion ( include radiation and/or surgery ) start study treatment ii . Not receive steroid therapy iii . Not receive enzyme induce antiepileptic medication start brain metastasis ( include carbamazepine , phenytoin , phenobarbital , primidone , oxcarbazepine , topiramate , vigabatrin ) Patients receive chemotherapy within 3 week prior initiation study treatment , endocrine therapy within 2 week prior initiation study treatment . Current grade ≥ 1 toxicity ( except alopecia ) prior therapy History prior grade 3 4 hypersensitivity toxicity trastuzumab warrant permanent cessation antibody Patients receive radiotherapy ≤ 2 week prior start study treatment and/or ≥ 30 % bone marrow irradiate determined Investigator Patients undergone major surgery ≤ 4 week prior start study treatment , recover side effect procedure Patient diabetes mellitus suboptimally control ( fast plasma glucose ≥ 140 , glycosylated hemoglobin &gt; 7.0 ) despite oral medication , insulindependent diabetes , document steroidinduced diabetes mellitus Current need chronic corticosteroid therapy immunosuppressive agent ( ≥10mg prednisone daily equivalent dose corticosteroid ) , patient receive systemic corticosteroid ≤ 2 week prior start study drug Current therapeutic anticoagulation warfarin ( coumarin derivative ) Prior treatment PI3K AKT inhibitor . Patients previously treat mTOR inhibitor eligible . Clinically significant cardiac disease impair cardiac function , : i. Baseline LVEF &lt; 50 % baseline echocardiogram MUGA ii . Congestive heart failure require treatment ( e.g. , New York Heart Association Class II , III IV ) within 6 month prior screen iii . Acute coronary syndrome &lt; 3 month prior screen ( include myocardial infarction , unstable angina , coronary artery bypass graft , coronary angioplasty , stenting ) iv . Uncontrolled arterial hypertension define blood pressure &gt; 140/100 mm Hg rest ( average 3 consecutive reading ) v. History current evidence unstable , clinically significant cardiac arrhythmia vi . Patients require medication narrow therapeutic window vii . Clinically significant conduction abnormality , e.g . congenital long QT syndrome , highGrade/complete AVblockage viii . Corrected QT interval ( QTc ) &gt; 480 msec screen ECG Patients currently receive medication know risk prolong QT interval induce Torsades de Pointes ( TdP ) treatment either discontinue switched different medication prior start study drug treatment Impaired gastrointestinal function poorly control gastrointestinal disease may significantly alter absorption oral BYL719 ( e.g . Crohn 's disease , ulcerative colitis , malabsorption syndrome , small bowel resection , uncontrolled nausea vomiting , grade ≥ 3 diarrhea etiology ) base treat physician assessment Patients may `` currently active '' second malignancy nonmelanoma skin cancer . Patients consider `` currently active '' malignancy complete therapy consider physician less 30 % risk relapse . Patients know HIV active infection hepatitis C virus Hepatitis B virus ( test mandatory ) Active infection serious underlie medical condition would impair patient 's ability receive protocol treatment Patients currently receive treatment drug know moderate strong inhibitor inducer isoenzymes CYP34A CYP2C8 . The patient must discontinue moderate strong inducer enzymes least one week must discontinue strong moderate inhibitor start treatment . Switching different medication prior start treatment allow ; Refer Appendix D. Patients receive live attenuate vaccine within 1 week start study drug study . Patient also avoid close contact others receive live attenuate vaccine . Examples live attenuate vaccine include intranasal influenza , measles , mumps , rubella , oral polio , BCG , yellow fever , varicella TY21a typhoid vaccine . Patients participate prior investigational study within 3 week prior initiation study treatment . Pregnant nursing ( lactate ) woman , pregnancy define state female conception termination gestation , confirm positive hCG laboratory test ( &gt; 5 mIU/mL ) . Patient apply highly effective contraception study duration define final dose study treatment . Sexually active male use condom intercourse take drug 8 week final dose study treatment father child period . A condom require use also vasectomize men order prevent delivery drug via seminal fluid . Women childbearing potential , defined woman physiologically capable become pregnant , unless use highly effective method contraception dose 8 week final dose study treatment . Highly effective contraception method include : . Total abstinence ( line prefer usual lifestyle subject . Periodic abstinence ( e.g. , calendar , ovulation , symptothermal , postovulation method ) withdrawal acceptable method contraception ii . Female sterilization ( surgical bilateral oophorectomy without hysterectomy ) tubal ligation least six week take study treatment . In case oophorectomy alone , reproductive status woman confirm follow hormone level assessment iii . Male partner sterilization ( least 6 month prior screen ) . For female subject study vasectomized male partner sole partner subject . iv . Combination follow method : 1 . Placement intrauterine device ( IUD ) intrauterine system ( IUS ) 2 . Barrier method contraception : Condom Occlusive cap ( diaphragm cervical/vault cap ) spermicidal foam/gel/film/cream/vaginal suppository Note : Postmenopausal woman allow participate study . Women consider postmenopausal child bear potential : Aged ≥60 ; age &lt; 60 12 month natural ( spontaneous , absence chemotherapy , tamoxifen , toremifene , ovarian suppression ) amenorrhea FSH estradiol postmenopausal range ( serum FSH &gt; 40 mIU/mL estradiol &lt; 10 pg/mL accord postmenopausal range definition local laboratory involve ) surgical bilateral oophorectomy ( without hysterectomy ) For woman therapyinduced amenorrhea , oophorectomy serial measurement FSH and/or estradiol need ensure postmenopausal status . NOTE : Ovarian radiation treatment luteinizing hormonereleasing hormone ( LHRH ) agonist ( goserelin acetate leuprolide acetate ) permit induction ovarian suppression .</criteria>
