	<brief_title>Study Integrating Antiretroviral Therapy With Methadone Treatment People Who Inject Drugs</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The overarch goal propose research develop test innovative implementation model ( IMAT ) effective integration HIV care treatment methadone service Dar e Salaam , Tanzania . The investigator utilize PRECEDE framework inform intervention improve linkage HIV-positive methadone patient ART . This model suggest strategy intend improve health care delivery consider combination three factor : 1 ) 'predisposing factor ' - characteristic knowledge , attitude , beliefs motivation change , 2 ) 'enabling factor ' - characteristic enable someone act desire behavior 3 ) 'reinforcing factor ' - factor encourage repetition persistence behavior . Therefore , IMAT approach use 1 ) target education mentor provider predispose timely ART initiation , 2 ) POC CD4 count platform ( PIMA , Alere ) provide real-time screening result enable ART initiation 3 ) alert reminder dashboard ( e.g. , summary key indicator improve decision make ) provider reinforce ART initiation . Additionally , approach lay foundation develop implementation strategy future point-of-care technology viral load . The study combine mixture qualitative quantitative methodology inform evaluate IMAT intervention . A baseline qualitative study use in-depth interview conduct among provider methadone client understand predisposing , enable reinforce factor related integration HIV care treatment methadone clinic . Information gain qualitative assessment inform support IMAT strategy . In addition , HIV-positive methadone client randomly select complete baseline cross-sectional survey collect data patient satisfaction , access HIV care , current treatment navigation access , HIV care literacy . The investigator assess effectiveness IMAT quasi-experimental pre-post cohort design pre-post cross-sectional survey examine change patient- provider-level outcome implementation IMAT compare IMAT . In addition , The investigator assess feasibility acceptability IMAT strategy use post-implementation cross-sectional survey particular emphasis satisfaction service ; time motion study understand timeliness care provision ; in-depth interview patient provider understand experience IMAT strategy .</detailed_description>
