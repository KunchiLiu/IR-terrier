	<brief_title>Ischemic Preconditioning Prevent Acute Kidney Injury</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Ischemic precondition thought work down-regulating pro-inflammatory gene expression up-regulating anti-inflammatory gene expression leukocytes . There local release vasodilator , include adenosine nitric oxide think renal protective effect [ 16 ] . More known regard ischemic preconditioning heart , show decrease adenine nucleotide pool , increase creatine phosphate intracellular glucose , decrease ATP depletion , lactate H+ accumulation . This lead sodium maintenance transmembrane sodium gradient prevents intracellular edema . Ischemic precondition thought yield protection first minute reperfusion . Activation adenosine A1 , bradykinin , opioid receptor think trigger protection . This support interference protection adenosine receptor antagonist administer . The role reactive oxygen specie part protective mechanism also describe via mitochondrial mKATP channel lead increase production protective superoxide . Protein kinase C may also involve protective mechanism ischemic preconditioning , however exact mechanism unknown controversial .</detailed_description>
