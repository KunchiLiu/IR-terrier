	<brief_summary>This pilot clinical trial study fluorine F 18 fluorothymidine ( FLT ) positron emission tomography ( PET ) /computed tomography ( CT ) measure cell proliferation patient brain tumor . Comparing result diagnostic procedure do , , treatment may help doctor measure tumor growth plan best treatment .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>18F-FLT PET/CT Measuring Cell Proliferation Patients With Brain Tumors</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . Using FLT PET/CT measure cellular proliferation , assess tissue proliferation disease sit brain tumor patient therapy ( surgery , chemotherapy radiotherapy combination ) . II . Determine level change cellular proliferation compare baseline ( scan 1 ) brain tumor mid-therapy ( scan 2 ) , completion therapy ( scan 3 ) clinical follow-up period ( scan 4 ) , possible . III . Correlate level cellular proliferation measure FLT PET/CT baseline treatment-induced change brain tumor proliferation clinical response status ( clinical category complete remission , less degree response/stable disease , response ) . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I. Assess spatial heterogeneity FLT uptake identify local difference brain tumor disease burden . OUTLINE : Patients undergo 18F-FLT PET/CT baseline ( pre-therapy ) , mid-therapy , completion therapy , 1 year completion therapy time suspect recurrence . After completion study , patient follow 7 year .</detailed_description>
