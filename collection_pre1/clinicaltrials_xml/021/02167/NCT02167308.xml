	<brief_summary>Background : Obesity-related disease profound economic impact health care system . Laser acupuncture show beneficial effect obesity . However , knowledge , trial either non-randomized , non-blinded , include low-calorie diet control . Investigators therefore design patient-assessor-blinded , randomize , sham-controlled crossover trial investigate significance laser acupuncture obesity . Methods/design : One hundred four subject 20 year age body mass index ( BMI ) 25 kg/m2 divide two group : experimental control . Each subject receive treatment relevant group three time week eight week . After eight week treatment subject enter two week washout period , subject switch group . Measurements include BMI , body fat percentage , waist-to-hip ratio ( WHR ) , waist circumference , hip circumference , skinfold thickness , thigh circumference , body fat , blood pressure , heart rate , hunger , 36-item short-form health survey ( SF-36 ) . Discussion : The result pilot study provide basis future large-scale multicenter trial investigate effect laser acupuncture obesity .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Effect Laser Acupuncture Obesity</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The number obese people around world increase rapidly . It estimate 10 % world 's adult population obese . Obesity associate increase risk coronary heart disease , type II diabetes , stroke , osteoarthritis , certain type cancer . These deleterious condition detrimental individual ' quality life , place emotional financial burden individual , family , society whole . Much need do improve treatment obesity . Current method treat obesity include dietary intervention , lifestyle intervention , drug intervention , bariatric surgery . Among , acupuncture , comprehensive program weight loss , increase popularity . However , previous systematic review assess effect acupuncture obesity discover promising inconclusive result .

In addition , lack safety procedure use traditional manual acupuncture could lead adverse event retroperitoneal abscess , rapid dermal spread breast cancer , pneumothorax , cardiac tamponade , viral hepatitis , granuloma . In comparison traditional manual acupuncture , laser acupuncture therapy several advantage . These advantage include ease application , precision dose measurement , painlessness , non-invasiveness . It quick safe therapy low cost risk infection . As laser acupuncture produce local sensation , double blind randomize controlled study also much easy perform . Laser acupuncture widely use medical field 30 year . Clinical research efficacy laser acupuncture also increase . Several study show laser acupuncture could effective treatment obesity . Low-level laser therapy non-invasive approach body contour spot fat reduction also report . However , several experimental limitation consider . For instance , absence placebo ( sham ) control , combination low-calorie diet , lack sufficient comparative parameter question . For reason , investigator decide conduct patient-assessor-blinded , randomize , sham-controlled crossover pilot trial investigate effect laser acupuncture Gallium Aluminum Arsenide ( GaAlAs ) laser irradiation weight loss , fat reduction , body contouring , quality life people suffer obesity .</detailed_description>
