	<brief_summary>Kinesio Taping ( KT ) use often , little scientific information effect . The aim study evaluate effect KT knee extension force among soccer player . KT ( K-Tape® ) Micropore ( 3M® ) apply right leave thighs 34 professional soccer player ( 20 male 14 female ) . Half participant KT apply leave half right thigh . The subject perform two maximal isometric voluntary contraction quadriceps pre , immediately post , 24 hour tape application . Isometric knee extension force measure use load cell follow variable assess : peak force , time peak force , rate force development peak force , time peak rate force development 200 m pulse . There statistically significant difference KT Micropore condition among test section ( pre , post , 24h ) . Therefore , tap ( independently type tape use time since application ) affect force-related measure assess maximal isometric voluntary knee extension trial perform healthy professional athlete .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Kinesio tap applied skin rectus femoris muscle one limb 3M Micropore® ( placebo tape ) apply contralateral limb . Different tape use evaluate tape type would affect finding . The side application different tape randomize among participant . Half participant ( n = 17 ) KT apply leave thigh half right thigh ( n = 17 ) . KT apply use `` V '' technique , knee position 45º flexion , origin tape locate 10 cm anterior-superior iliac spine one tape go laterally one medially rectus femoris muscle belly , pass around patella finish tibial tuberosity . The technique use Micropore tape contralateral limb , elastic , knee joint crossed end point medial lateral aspect patella . The mean force value calculate condition ( pre , post 24 hour tape application ) . The isometric knee extension force collect use load cell ( EMG System Brasil Ltda . ® ) measuring range 0 200 kg 1000 Hz , filter low pas filter type Butterworth 4th order cut-off frequency 15 Hz , obtain residual analysis .</detailed_description>
