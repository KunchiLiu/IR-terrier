	<brief_summary>Cerebral palsy ( CP ) non-progressive disorder cause insult injury brain brain rapidly develop result motor dysfunction . Causes injury brain numerous occur prior birth , birth process , within first month follow birth . The motor dysfunction involve four extremity often affect leg , cause abnormal ambulation . The level severity depend extent injury brain mild severe . In severe instance , child dependent others his/her care . There known cure CP , physical occupational therapy administer attempt improve function . The frequency therapy vary week ( standard care Western Hemisphere ) five time week ( standard care Asia Eastern European country ) . The current understanding brain plasticity offer theoretical explanation justify intense approach . Active repetitive motor skill-directed rehabilitation utilizes plasticity brain restore function . Intense active physiotherapy stimulate non-injured 'dormant ' neuron prevent 'natural ' degeneration order substitute function injured neuron . It young brain likely respond therapy . The aim proposal evaluate effect administer physical occupational therapy five time week 12 week compare standard care ( SOC ) approach one time week child age 12 month 36 month . This first randomize crossover trial enroll young population child cerebral palsy well evaluate approach therapist parent perspective . The number child study enroll large CP study . The child evaluate clinically two validated instrument , one design specifically child CP administer score certified therapist design child developmental disability score child 's care provider . A sub-set child special type MRI evaluate change neurological structure brain . The Department Pediatrics University Arizona recently complete collaborative study Neurologic Department Beijing Children 's Hospital intense approach five therapy per week SOC . The positive result prompt another investigation determine approach would feasible United States . A compliance rate 81 % confirm feasibility perception parent child diagnose CP whatever improve child 's motor function .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Specific Aim # 1 : To compare effectiveness intense physiotherapy program current standard care management child spastic cerebral palsy . Hypothesis # 1 : Children receive short cluster intense therapy ( 5 time per week 12 week ) show great functional gain determine Gross Motor Function Measure ( GMFM-66 ) Pediatric Evaluation Disability Inventory ( PEDI ) receive therapy week , current standard care . Specific Aim # 2 : To determine functional gain child spastic cerebral palsy achieve intense physiotherapy program continue improve receive less intense standard weekly therapy least 36 week ( 9 month ) follow completion intense program . Hypothesis # 2 : Motor skill gain 12 week intensely administer physiotherapy determine GMFM PEDI continue improve rate great see child receive therapy week , current standard care . Specific Aim # 3 : After receive number therapy end 48-week protocol , child receive intense series therapy first 12-weeks make great functional gain receive last 12-weeks . Hypothesis # 3 : Children receive intense physiotherapy earlier age make great gain receive therapy later age . Specific Aim # 4 : To develop clinical profile identify child likely benefit intensely administer physiotherapy . Hypothesis # 4 : Clinical radiologic characteristic play major role response therapy . Explorative Aim : To assess correlation clinical improvement intense physiotherapy anatomical change use magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) . Hypothesis : The improvement intense physiotherapy see clinical assessment reflect alteration brain connectivity parameter available neuroanatomical MRI diffusion tensor imaging ( DTI ) .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>1 . Age : 12 36 month age ( The diagnosis CP often uncertain age 12 month . The cutoff 36 month population young child brain `` plastic '' susceptible reorganization ) . 2 . Diagnosis : Diagnosis spastic CP confirm pediatric neurologist pediatric rehabilitation specialist . 3 . Etiology : The insult central nervous system cause motor dysfunction must occur gestation within one year birth independent gestational age . 4 . Disease severity level : Gross Motor Function Classification System ( GMFCS ) level I , II III . 1 . Diagnosis : Diagnosis CP secondary neuronal migration . 2 . Comorbidities : Medical condition may prevent administration rehabilitation therapy intensity require study , may compromise study ability maintain blindness , comorbidity typically associate CP ( i.e . cancer , cystic fibrosis ) . 3 . Cointerventions : Anticipated pharmacological intervention procedure participation study may interfere study .</criteria>
