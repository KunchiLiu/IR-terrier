	<brief_summary>Orthostatic intolerance refers symptoms occur stand improve resolve recumbency . Few study evaluate orthostatic intolerance symptom electroencephalography ( EEG ) , none study focus adolescent-aged patient . This study compare EEG characteristic sweat rate head-upright tilt ( HUT ) test among patient postural tachycardia syndrome ( POTS ) patient syncope without POTS . Patients POTS also undergo separate HUT abdominal low extremity compression . The primary aim study characterize video EEG change correspond orthostatic intolerance youth HUT testing . The investigator hypothesize clinical encephalopathy relate POTS refer 'brain fog ' electrographic correlate . Secondary aim include ( 1 ) EEG comparison POTS symptom without abdominal low extremity compression HUT , ( 2 ) correlation sweat rate EEG change HUT , ( 3 ) analysis EEG characteristic distinguish syncope POTS syncope without POTS . The investigator hypothesize POTS patient prolong syncopal prodrome ( compare syncope patient without POTS ) protective syncope daily activity .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>All POTS syncope patient refer Nationwide Children 's Hospital ( Columbus , OH ) meeting study eligibility criterion ask participate . Consent assent obtain per IRB guideline . Consenting patient undergo head-upright tilt ( HUT ) test video EEG continuous sweat monitoring . Prior test medicine affect orthostatic tolerance hold minimum 5 half-lives . Caffeine hold minimum 24 hour . Urinalysis ( urine specific gravity ) pregnancy test ( female patient child-bearing age ) do day HUT testing . A recumbent EEG sample le 10 minute obtain . EKG lead , Holter lead , blood pressure monitor ( beat-to-beat conventional arm cuff ) , intravenous ( IV ) line , sweat monitor place . Sweat rate , EEG , blood pressure monitor synchronized event trigger , allow co-registration timed study data post-processing . Serum norepinephrine level obtain time IV placement 10 minute tilt during/immediately syncope prodrome syncope occur prior 10 minute . Once monitor place , 10 minute EEG collect , patient recumbent minimum 30 minute , table tilt up-right 70 degree . A video camera test . Patients encourage report symptom frequently examine sign pallor , acrocyanosis sweating . Tilt test continue syncope occur , 10 minute patient meet POTS criterion , 45 minute neither syncope POTS present . Those meet age-appropriate POTS criterion ( symptomatic heart-rate increment &gt; 40 bpm symptomatic total HR &gt; 130 bpm , within 10 minute tilt &lt; 20 year age ) lower 10 minute ( sooner syncope ) ask repeat test abdominal low extremity compression . The compression suit use Dr. Heyer NCH study . It compose Neoprene-like material 5 Velcro strap fit snugly around leg , thigh abdomen . The abdominal strap contain air-filled bladder potentiate abdominal compression . We use suit 30 consenting patient prior study . None study participant complain discomfort . The suit successfully reduce heart rate orthostatic symptom youth POTS ; 55 % studied patient longer met POTS diagnostic criterion suit ( see PMID : 24840763 manuscript ) . We use compression suit method attenuate POTS symptom HUT test . EEG compare without compression . The time frame study average 90 minute . It exceed 3 hour . After lower tilt table , monitor lead IV remove . Once lead remove study obligation .</detailed_description>
