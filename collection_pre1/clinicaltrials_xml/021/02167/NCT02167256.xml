	<brief_summary>AZD0530 inhibitor Src Abl family kinases1 . It develop treatment malignancy kinases play role tumor invasion proliferation . However , Src family kinase ( SFKs ) highly express brain major effect synaptic plasticity2 . Moreover , investigator recently show specific SFK , namely Fyn , aberrantly activate specific conformation Amyloid Beta ( Aß ) peptide Alzheimer 's disease ( AD ) . Genetic deletion Fyn rescue AD deficit preclinical model . This clinical trial test potential benefit AZD0530 Alzheimer 's disease modification .</brief_summary>
