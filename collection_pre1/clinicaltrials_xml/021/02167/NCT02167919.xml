	<brief_summary>Purpose : To evaluate efficacy prostatic artery embolization ( PAE ) patient benign prostatic hyperplasia ( BPH ) refractory low urinary tract symptom ( LUTS ) decreasing volume prostate gland . Participants : Study participant recruit UNC Urology clinic well refer provider . We include 15 men experience LUTS control medication estimate prostate gland weight 80 150 gram . Procedures ( method ) : Enrolled patient undergo standard work-up surgical prostate procedure . In addition , patient 's artery evaluate pelvic CT angiogram . Then , patient undergo prostatic artery embolization . Follow visit schedule 1 , 3 , 6 , 12 month procedure . At end follow-up period , reduction prostate gland size make patient eligible transurethral therapy , may proceed procedure elect undergo surgical procedure , depend residual symptom . Similarly , insufficient gland size reduction occur , patient may elect pursue OP procedure longer bother LUTS .</brief_summary>
