	<brief_title>Stereotactic Radiosurgery Metastatic Spinal Cord Compression</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Metastatic spinal cord compression ( MSCC ) acute event demand treatment otherwise would eventually lead paraplegia patient . This serious condition individual cancer patient burdensome healthcare system . A surgical intervention plus fractionated radiation therapy ( FRT ) currently standard treatment . Proposed Solution : If spinal cord dose respect , local tumor control could equivalent use stereotactic body radiation therapy ( SBRT ) minimal risk comparison decompression surgery postoperative conventional radiotherapy without additional burden patient perform invasive surgical procedure . Clinical Impact : Patients currently require surgery plus radiation therapy potentially benefit form propose method . Patients potentially benefit reduced toxicity avoid surgical procedure . In addition , short treatment protocol one fraction beneficial . Aims : The investigator ' hypothesis stereotactic body radiation therapy ( SBRT ) could equivalent alternative case patient present metastatic spinal cord compression minor neurologic deficit . Specific aim : 1 . Determine feasibility recruit patient randomize towards SBRT vs. surgery plus FRT 2 . Determine ability walk 6 week measure start date treatment 3 . Determine side-effects quality life metric follow treatment arm 4 . Determine rate local control follow therapy use MRI scan Project Plan : The investigator intend investigate stereotactic body radiation therapy ( SBRT ) could equivalent alternative case patient present metastatic spinal cord compression minor neurologic deficit</detailed_description>
