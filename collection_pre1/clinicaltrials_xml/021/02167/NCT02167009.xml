	<brief_title>Benign Prostatic Hyperplasia Prostate Size Greater Than 90 Grams</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This phase II , single center , prospective , single arm , investigational study evaluate safety efficacy prostate artery embolization ( PAE ) treatment severe low urinary tract symptom ( LUTS ) relate BPH patient prostate size great 90 gram either refuse surgical treatment consider poor candidate traditional surgical therapy . 30 patient enrolled single treatment arm follow-up le 12 month . The study involve screen period patient eligibility determine . Once eligibility confirm , patient receive PAE Embosphere Microspheres within 4 week screen transrectal ultrasound . After treatment , patient return follow-up visit 1 month , 3 month , 6 month , 12 month post PAE . At visit , patient complete IPSS IIEF questionnaire , undergo physical exam , perform medication review .
