	<brief_title>A Pilot Study Characterize Bioavailability Plasma Profile Potato Polyphenols Humans</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The propose study single-center , placebo-controlled , randomize , 2-arm , 2-sequence , crossover study characterize bioavailability kinetic profile potato 6-hour postprandial day ( PPD ) . A planned sample size 12 enrol study . This study require one initial screen visit , pre-study visit , 2 PPDs . This study take 3-6 week per subject complete . The trial initiate screen visit , last 1-1.5 hour subject ' height , weight , waist circumference , fast blood glucose , fast hs-CRP ( high sensitivity C-reactive protein ) concentration , blood pressure heart rate measure survey related general eating , health exercise habit complete . If willing eligible participate , 3-day food record ( 2 weekday 1 weekend ) give screen visit collect follow pre-study Visit ass subject 's baseline dietary intake pattern . Also , subject instruct follow relatively low polyphenolic-diet least 7 day prior first PPD duration study . Prior PPD , dinner meal provide day PPD control second meal effect food beverage intake night PPD . Subjects arrive center fast state least 10 hour , well hydrate rest . Each PPD require blood draw throughout visit . After evaluation subject 's health status ( via anthropometric , vital sign blood glucose measurement in-person interview ) , register nurse place catheter subject 's arm purpose multiple blood sample collection take initial blood draw fasting . A standard high carbohydrate high fat test meal either 200g white potato 200g purple potato serve . Thereafter , timer start blood sample collect 20 , 40 , 60 , 120 , 180 , 240 , 300 , 360 minute assessment plasma bioavailability kinetic profile potato polyphenols change inflammation marker relative metabolic index . The sequence receive potato treatment visit randomly assign base computer generate sequence : white potato-purple potato purple potato-white potato . Premenopausal female subject study follicular phase menstrual cycle food intake tends stable follicular phase ( day 1-13 ) luteal phase ( day 14-28 ) rise progesterone level decrease satiety often result increase intake . Both PPD visit place least 3 day apart well .</detailed_description>
