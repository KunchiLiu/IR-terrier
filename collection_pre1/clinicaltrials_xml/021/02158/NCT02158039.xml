	<brief_summary>Cystic tumor pancreas fluid-filled growth . They often treat surgical removal . A safe effective non-surgical treatment desirable . Ethanol ( alcohol ) injection may treat cyst kill line cell cyst , accept treatment cyst organ . In study , participant pancreatic cyst underwent endoscopic ultrasound ( EUS ) guide ethanol injection pancreatic cyst . This pilot study assess safety efficacy . The hypothesis study 1 ) complication EUS guide ethanol injection require hospitalization occur &lt; 10 % subject , 2 ) EUS guide ethanol injection , retreatment necessary , ablate least 50 % pancreatic cyst .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>EUS perform via mouth sedation . After needle place pancreas cyst EUS guidance , ethanol solution place cyst via needle . The ethanol solution withdraw new ethanol inject , process continue 5 minute , repeatedly wash cyst ethanol solution . After treatment , usual clinical follow-up obtain include assessment cyst CT MRI scan . If cyst significant size persists , additional EUS-guided ethanol injection cyst offer .</detailed_description>
