	<brief_summary>This research study evaluate new drug call IPI-145 combination standard drug fludarabine , cyclophosphamide , rituximab ( FCR ) , possible treatment chronic lymphocytic leukemia ( CLL ) .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Phase 1b/2 Study IPI-145 Plus FCR Previously Untreated , Younger Patients With CLL</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Patients fulfill eligibility criterion enter trial receive IPI-145 combination standard drug fludarabine , cyclophosphamide , rituximab ( FCR ) . After screen procedure confirm participation research study : Phase I The investigator look high dose combination study drug administer safely without severe unmanageable side effect participant CLL . Not everyone participate research study receive dose study drug . The dose give depend number participant enrol study prior well dose tolerate . Phase II : Patients treat IPI-145 Recommended Phase II Dose ( RP2D ) + fludarabine , cyclophosphamide , rituximab ( FCR ) standard dosing .</detailed_description>
