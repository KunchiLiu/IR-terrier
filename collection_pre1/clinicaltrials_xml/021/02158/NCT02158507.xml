	<brief_summary>This study evaluate effectiveness safety combination two drug , Veliparib Lapatinib , give participant metastatic triple negative breast cancer undergone previous treatment . Veliparib investigational drug approve FDA Lapatinib approve FDA another type breast cancer . All eligible participant receive study medication placebo .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Pilot Study Veliparib ( ABT-888 ) Lapatinib ( Tykerb ) Patients With Metastatic , Triple Negative Breast Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Breast cancer commonly diagnose cancer American woman . Metastatic breast cancer remain incurable partially due lack target therapy select subset patient . There five distinct subset breast cancer unique biological profile . Triple negative breast cancer ( TNBC ) subset special clinical interest significant percentage occurrence ( 10-20 % breast cancer diagnosis ) poor prognosis . With defined target therapy date , study seek investigate therapeutic strategy base specific molecular abnormality tumor cell TNBC .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Patient must pathologically document stage IV breast cancer . Tumor must HER2 negative , estrogen progesterone receptor negative . Patients BRCA 1 2 mutation include . Patients must measurable disease , define least one lesion accurately measure least one dimension . Biopsy metastatic lesion require protocol entry patient reasonably accessible lesion must agree biopsy . ( Lung brain metastasis biopsied . ) Patients reasonably accessible lesion enrol trial . Prior Therapy : No two regimen metastatic set long patient adequate performance status . Patients prior chemotherapy metastatic disease may include trial receive anthracyclines taxanes adjuvant neoadjuvant setting . Chemotherapy na√Øve patient metastatic disease must fail anthracyclines taxanes . Chemotherapy treatment prior enrollment must discontinue least 3 week prior study entry . Patients must complete radiation therapy least 21 day prior begin protocol treatment . Patients must recover reversible toxicity relate prior therapy begin protocol treatment may pre exist treatmentrelated toxicity higher Grade 2 . Patients must less Grade 2 preexist peripheral neuropathy . Patients may receive bisphosphonates . However , use , bone lesion may use progression response . At least 19 year age . Life expectancy &gt; 12 week . Performance status accord Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group ( ECOG ) less equal 2 . Patients must normal organ marrow function define : Absolute neutrophil count : great equal 1,000/uL Hemoglobin : great equal 9 mg/dL Platelets : great equal 100,000/uL Total bilirubin : le equal 1.5 time institutional upper limit normal AST ( SGOT ) /ALT ( SGPT ) : less equal 2.5 time institutional upper limit normal without liver metastasis OR le equal 5 time institutional upper limit normal document liver metastasis Creatinine : less equal 1.5 mg/dL OR calculate creatinine clearance great equal 40 mL/min ( calculate use modify Cockcroft Gault method ) . Ability understand willingness sign write informed consent document . Use effective mean contraception subject childbearing potential . Negative serum urine betaHCG ( human chorionic gonadotropin ) pregnancy test screening patient childbearing potential . Ejection fraction must 50 % . Patients may receive investigational agent . No prior use anthracyclines taxanes metastatic disease adjuvant neoadjuvant setting . Metastatic lesion identifiable PET . QTc ( correct QT ) &gt; 470 msec . Excluded patient may develop prolongation QTc . These condition include patient hypokalemia hypomagnesemia , congenital long QT syndrome , patient take anti arrhythmic medicine medicinal product lead QT prolongation , cumulative highdose anthracycline therapy . Patients may receive concurrent chemotherapy treatment metastatic disease . Active brain metastasis : evidence progression less equal 3 month local therapy . ( Patients asymptomatic corticosteroid anticonvulsant least 3 month prior study entry ) . Patients brain metastasis must least one site measurable disease outside central nervous system . Uncontrolled concurrent illness include , limited , ongoing active infection , history recent myocardial infarction , symptomatic congestive heart failure , unstable angina pectoris , cardiac arrhythmia , interstitial lung disease psychiatric illness/social situation would limit compliance study requirement . Uncontrolled seizure disorder . Pregnant lactate woman exclude . Because unknown potential risk adverse event nurse infant secondary treatment mother , breastfeed discontinue mother treat . These potential risk may also apply agent use study . A prior invasive malignant disease within five year except skin cancer ( squamous cell basal cell carcinoma ) . Patients known history HIV Hepatitis B potential add toxicity treatment regimen . Dementia alter mental status would prohibit understanding informed consent .</criteria>
