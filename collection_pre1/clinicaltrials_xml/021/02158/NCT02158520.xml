	<brief_summary>This randomized phase II trial study well paclitaxel albumin-stabilized nanoparticle formulation bevacizumab ipilimumab work first-line therapy treat patient stage IV melanoma remove surgery . Drugs use chemotherapy , paclitaxel albumin-stabilized nanoparticle formulation , work different way stop growth tumor cell , either kill cell , stop dividing , stop spread . Bevacizumab may stop growth tumor cell bind protein call vascular endothelial growth factor ( VEGF ) prevent growth new blood vessel tumor need grow . Ipilimumab block substance call cytotoxic T-lymphocyte-associated antigen-4 ( CTLA4 ) surface T cell may help immune system kill cancer cell . It yet know whether paclitaxel albumin-stabilized nanoparticle formulation bevacizumab effective ipilimumab treat melanoma .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To assess whether combination nab-paclitaxel ( paclitaxel albumin-stabilized nanoparticle formulation ) bevacizumab ( AB ) prolong progression-free status relative ipilimumab treatment patient unresectable stage IV melanoma . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . To estimate hazard death among randomized AB ipilimumab relative randomize ipilimumab AB first line treatment patient unresectable stage IV melanoma . II . To assess whether tumor response rate ( determine Response Evaluation Criteria Solid Tumors [ RECIST ] criterion 1.1 ) differs respect 1st treatment course . III . To estimate whether tumor response rate differs respect 2nd treatment course progress first treatment course . IV . To examine safety profile regimen . TERTIARY OBJECTIVES : I . To examine pharmacokinetics nab-paclitaxel combined bevacizumab therapy . II . To examine pharmacodynamic change blood-derived parameter ( biomarkers ) angiogenesis immunity function therapy . III . To examine whether change serum biomarkers also see tumor . OUTLINE : Patients randomize 1 2 treatment arm . ARM A : Patients receive bevacizumab intravenously ( IV ) 30-90 minute day 1 15 paclitaxel albumin-stabilized nanoparticle formulation IV 30 minute day 1 , 8 , 15 . Courses repeat every 28 day absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . Patients experience progressive disease may cross-over Arm B within 2-4 week . ARM B : Patients receive ipilimumab IV 90 minute day 1 . Treatment repeat every 21 day 4 course absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . Patients experience progressive disease may cross-over Arm A within 2-4 week . After completion study treatment , patient follow 5 year .</detailed_description>
