	<brief_summary>Eltrombopag olamine ( SB-497115-GR ) orally bioavailable , small molecule thrombopoietin receptor agonist may beneficial medical disorder associate thrombocytopenia . Eltrombopag show increase platelet count patient thrombocytopenia various etiology ( Idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura [ ITP ] , liver disease , aplastic anemia chemotherapy induce thrombocytopenia ) . Approximately 350 subject randomize 1:1 ratio ( 175 eltrombopag arm 175 placebo arm ) . Approximately 55 subject enrol azacitidine . Subjects intermediate-1 , intermediate-2 high risk MDS IPSS , baseline platelet count &lt; 75 Giga ( 10^9 ) per liter ( Gi/L ) enrol . This randomized , double-blind , parallel group , placebo-controlled study design explore platelet supportive care effect eltrombopag versus placebo combination standard care hypomethylating agent , azacitidine . The primary objective study determine effect eltrombopag versus placebo proportion subject platelet transfusion free first 4 cycle azacitidine therapy . Key secondary endpoint include overall survival , disease response , disease progression .</brief_summary>
