	<brief_title>PACAP Induced Migraine Attacks Patients With High Low Genetic Load</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Migraine prevalent neurological disorder strong genetic factor . The common form migraine multifactorial polygenic pattern inheritance genetics research crucial deeper understand migraine mechanism . Recently , 12 genetic locus identify associate migraine ( MA ) without aura ( MA ) four large genome-wide association study ( GWAS ) . The functional consequence genetic variant human yet unknown . PACAP neuropeptide play crucial role pathophysiology migraine present migraine relevant structure . PACAP induce migraine attack MO patient via adenosine monophosphate ( cAMP ) dependent pathway . Also , recent study show intracellular accumulation cAMP crucial induction migraine attack . The phenotype migraine induce effect PACAP might therefore link 12 genetic susceptibility locus identify .</detailed_description>
