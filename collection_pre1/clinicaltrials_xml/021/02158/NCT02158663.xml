	<brief_summary>Objectives : The primary objective test whether right prefrontal cortex low frequency 1 Hz rTMS versus right prefrontal high frequency 10 Hz rTMS provide significantly great improvement function measure IPF score PTSD symptom measure CAPS score . The secondary objective include : one , test treatment provide significantly great improvement depressive symptom measure change QIDS score ; two , test whether depression impact effectiveness 1 Hz versus 10 Hz rTMS PTSD symptom ; three , test treatment well tolerate measured participant drop side effect profile . Research Design : Randomized single-blind ( raters ) prospective clinical trial test effectiveness 1 Hz rTMS versus 10 Hz rTMS veteran PTSD . Methodology : Veterans 18 50 year age suffer PTSD without depressive symptom recruit community well mental health clinic James A. Haley Veterans Administration Hospital . Plan enroll 50 order evaluable sample approximately 20 group . Participants consent undergo screen safety appropriateness trial . Those deem eligible evaluated clinical measure function , PTSD , depression , pain , neurobehavioral symptom . Participants randomize equal proportion ( stratified significant depression define MADRS great 19 ) one two active treatment : right prefrontal 1 Hz rTMS versus right prefrontal 10 Hz rTMS . Participants undergo assessment safety prior treatment . The treatment perform 5 day week 6 week 3-week taper consist 3 day per week , 2 day per week , 1 day per week . Clinical evaluation perform baseline , every five treatment , end treatment , 1 3 month post treatment . CAPS IPF score use determine significant difference 1 Hz 10 Hz right prefrontal rTMS PTSD symptom function respectively . The QIDS score use test significant difference change depressive symptom participant significant depressive symptom entire group . The number dropout ( relate specifically side effect cause ) use along side effect profile test difference tolerability two treatment .</brief_summary>
