	<brief_summary>The investigator develop novel technique saphenous vein graft harvest coronary artery bypass grafting ( CABG ) graft harvest pedicle surround tissue . A randomized trial show significantly high patency rate vein graft harvest new methode compare conventional harvesting technique 8.5 year surgery ( 90 vs 76 % ) . In 2004 investigator start prospective randomize trial compare patency vein graft harvest surround tissue radial artery graft . The result show vein graft harvest surround tissue significantly high patency rate compare radial artery graft 3 year surgery ( 98 vs 84 % ) . The present study long-term follow-up ( 8 year ) patient include second randomize trial . The hypothesis vein graft harvest surround tissue significantly high patency rate compare radial artery graft 8 year surgery .</brief_summary>
