Patients suffer anal pain lasting several hour defecation rectal bleeding.3 Most acute anal fissure heal spontaneously , proportion progress chronic fissure symptom beyond 8-12 week . There strict definition chronic anal fissure , previously presence two follow three symptom use : 1 . Pain defecation last three month ; 2. presence sentinel anal tag ; 3 . Exposure horizontal fibres internal anal sphincter . The severe pain may cause hypertonic contraction internal anal sphincter lead ischemia . Treatment strategies therefore aim relieve hypertonia surgical non-operative approach . Primary therapy initiate ointment Diltiazem glyceryltrinitrat gel . A novel approach Levorag® Emulgel , ointment classify Medical Device class 1 . According manufacturer ( THD SpA , Italy ) effect Levorag® Emulgel mediate effect myoxinol , plant extract Hibiscus plant botox-like effect anal sphincter carboxymethyl glucan , natural yeast polysaccharide immune stimulate property . The effect widely use Diltiazem gel , mediate diltiazem hydrochloride , calcium channel blocker decrease anal sphincter pressure . This interventional , randomized clinical trial include adult patient chronic anal fissure refer directly Digestive Disease Center , Bispebjerg Hospital , University Copenhagen , refer private surgical practice Copenhagen . Patients randomize 1 ) Diltiazem gel 2 % , one application twice daily 8 week , 2 ) Levorag® Emulgel , one application twice daily 8 week . In addition allocate treatment , patient keep standard care anal fissure , include high-fibre diet proper hydration laxative . The primary endpoint rate complete heal 12 week . Secondary endpoint complete heal 8 week , incidence adverse effect efficacy pain relief .</detailed_description>
