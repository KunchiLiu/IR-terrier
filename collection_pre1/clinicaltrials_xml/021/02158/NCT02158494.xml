	<brief_summary>The investigator hypothesis electrical stimulation tongue directly stimulate two cranial nerve nucleus ( Trigeminal Facial Nerve Nuclei ) , excite neural impulse brainstem cerebellum . The investigator call cranial nerve non-invasive neuromodulation ( CN-NINM ) . The activation structure induces neuroplasticity combine specific physical , cognitive and/or mental exercise , promote recovery select functional damage problem balance walk . 44 subject recruit 2 week intensive In-Lab Balance Gait Training follow 12 week intensive Home Training weekly In-Lab check session . Half subject use CN-NINM conjunction exercise . Half subject use low level stimulation conjunction exercise , serve control group .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Noninvasive Neuromodulation Treatment Symptoms Due Mild Moderate Traumatic Brain Injury</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>- Based result investigator pilot study moderate traumatic brain injury ( M-TBI ) , investigator conduct randomize , control study cranial nerve non-invasive neuromodulation ( CN-NINM ) individual chronic symptom mild moderate traumatic brain injury ( mTBI ) , post-concussive sequela , ( PCS ) post-traumatic stress ( PTS ) . - The study involve train balance gait , assessment use standardized relevant metric monitor change indication , well cognitive function , sleep , headache , anxiety , mood , eye-movement control . - The training regimen involve use neurostimulation intervention address primary secondary symptom associate mTBI , PCS , PTS . - This randomize double blind control study enroll total 44 subject ( M &amp; F ) 2 equal subgroup : 22 Active PoNS™ , 22 Control ( non-zero , minimally perceivable stimulation ) device . - Subjects participate 3-phase intervention begin 2-week in-lab training program ( ITP ) ( 2 in-lab training session 1 home training session daily ) , follow 12 week train home ( HTP ) ( 3 home training session daily ) , 12-week withdrawal period ( train ) . Subjects return clinic weekly at-home phase single session retrain progression , participate periodic retesting . - All training test perform uniformly across subject group . Multiple assessment metric capture data begin end 2-week in-lab CN-NINM intervention period 3-week interval . After completion formal training period , subject stop use device ( withdrawal stage ) test every 3 week additional 12 week monitor ass change due withdrawal PoNS . This yield total 10 data point subject . - If successful , study would indicate CN-NINM may improve rehabilitation outcomes reduce time require improve function .</detailed_description>
