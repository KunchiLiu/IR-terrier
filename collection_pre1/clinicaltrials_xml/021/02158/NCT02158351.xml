	<detailed_description>Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease ( NAFLD ) include benign hepatic simple steatosis ( SS ) severe steatohepatitis ( NASH ) , characterize inflammation fibrosis potentially leading cirrhosis hepatocellular carcinoma . Current research focus risk factor determinant NASH . NAFLD associate metabolic syndrome , prevalence describe 98 % morbidly obese individual undergo bariatric surgery . NAFLD non-obese subject different clinical profile obese individual , associate insulin resistance ( IR ) , differential distribution visceral adipose tissue , recent increase body weight and/or presence overweight , intake high cholesterol diet genetic background . Gut microbiota ( GM ) regulate fat metabolism mouse . In human alteration link diabetes , obesity , IR , atherosclerosis inflammation , SS NAFLD . Several experimental data suggest gut-derived endotoxin GM composition act `` second hit '' insult convert hepatic SS NASH cause local hepatic systemic inflammation . With regard human study , Muozaki et al . recently show , use polymerase chain reaction ( PCR ) TaqMan system approach , obese patient NASH , low percentage fecal Bacteroidetes ( Bacteroidetes total bacteria count ) compare SS healthy control high percentage C. coccoides compare SS . In addition , Zhu et al . show pediatric subject , use 16S ribosomal RNA detection method , unique pattern enterotypes patient NASH , obese individual sign liver damage lean healthy control . Finally , Wai-Sun Wong et al . show , also use 16S ribosomal RNA detection method , small group Chinese NASH patient demonstrate fecal dysbiosis significant change biodiversity compare healthy subject . Finally , inflammation patient symptomatic atherosclerosis show associate low level butyrate produce gut bacteria Roseburia . Among possible factor involve determine NAFLD severity , serum bile acid ( BA ) concentration post-prandial variation recently link regulation body weight , liver fat inflammation glucose lipid metabolism . These BA regulatory function mediate interaction farnesoid X receptor ( FXR ) G Protein-Coupled BA Receptor 1 ( GPBAR1 TGR5 ) hepatic subcutaneous adipose tissue level . No human study direct investigate mechanism GM composition influence inflammation fibrosis obese non-obese patient NAFLD . Liver biopsy clinically advisable bariatric surgery , due high prevalence NAFLD NASH morbidly obese patient . It previously suggest high prevalence histologically proven NAFLD patient gallstone may also justify routine liver biopsy cholecystectomy , even non-obese subject , establish diagnosis , stage , possible therapy . The latter suggestion recently reinforce evidence , human , cholecystectomy may represent independent risk factor NAFLD detect ultrasounds experimental demonstration cholecystectomy increase hepatic triglyceride content . In present research project study patient histologically proven SS NASH . Liver biopsy perform bariatric surgery ( sleeve gastrectomy ) cholecystectomy patient preoperative evidence NAFLD ultrasound . We compare GM composition use , first time , accurate method available , metagenomic shotgun . This method allow analyze microbiota diversity , provide information intestinal microbial composition metabolic process link . In addition , correlate , first time , GM composition hepatic , obese patient , also white adipose tissue gene expression pattern interest serum fecal marker possibly relate impaired fat storage inflammation . We aim provide preliminary data design future intervention study pre- probiotic bile acid derivative prevent/treat inflammation fibrosis NAFLD patient .</detailed_description>
