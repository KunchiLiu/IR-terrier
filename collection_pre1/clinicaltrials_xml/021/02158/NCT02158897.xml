Furthermore , STS improve risk factor associate age age-related disease rodent model . Prolonged fasting , however , difficult implement may feasible safe human . We develop fasting-mimicking diet ( FMD ) well accept pilot human trial . The objective study ascertain impact fasting-mimicking diet give adult subject 5 day month 3 consecutive month .
