	<brief_summary>Children Down syndrome ( DS ) great difficulty acquire expressive language predict general cognitive ability language comprehension ( Miller , 1999 ) . To date , intervention improve communication outcome child DS meet modest success . The propose study randomize control trial early communication intervention combine two evidence-based treatment teach expressive communication ( Enhanced Milieu Teaching ; EMT ) joint attention/symbolic play ( Joint Attention Symbolic Play Engagement Regulation ; JASPER ) use dual mode ( word +AAC ) . The intervention ( ) teach foundation communication ( joint attention , play ) , ( b ) build positive child characteristic social attention , ( c ) use naturalistic strategy increase rate complexity communication increase task engagement , ( ) address potential value add visual support ( AAC ) speak communication , ( e ) include parent implementers intervention promote generalization across setting activity , ensure maintenance time . It hypothesize child DS enrol intervention well language communication skill end treatment followup child BAU comparison group.The study enroll 82 30 54 month old child DS few 20 word . Examining predictor response treatment effect treatment executive function inform theory practice .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>This two-site randomized control trial ( RCT ) efficacy JASP-EMT , innovative blend communication intervention , JASPER ( joint engagement play intervention ) , EMT ( Enhanced Milieu Teaching ) . The study evaluate relative benefit teach young child DS use dual communication mode : speak word AAC . JASP-EMT involve direct intervention child well parent training attempt increase generalization intervention effect . A control group receive community treatment usual ( BAU ) . Participants include 82 child DS age 30 54 month across two site . AIM 1 : To examine effect experimental intervention ( Words + AAC ) primary ( expressive language ) secondary outcome ( receptive language , symbolic play , symbol-infused joint engagement , parent use language support strategy ) . H1 : Children Words+AAC group significantly well primary secondary outcome child control group . H2 : Parents child Words+AAC group demonstrate increase use language support strategies parent child control group . AIM 2 : To examine maintenance generalization effect experimental intervention child parent . H3 : Intervention effect maintain follow-up generalize across context . AIM 3 ( exploratory ) : To examine effect potential child level moderator primary secondary outcome study . H4 : Child characteristic baseline ( e.g. , speech intelligibility , cognitive level ) moderate primary child outcome . AIM 4 ( exploratory ) : To examine effect experimental intervention executive functioning . H5 : Children Words+AAC group demonstrate improve executive functioning follow intervention relative child control group . Participants A total 82 child parent recruit study ( 41 Vanderbilt 41 UCLA ) . Child MA 18 month ensure child cognitive skill symbolic representation communication . The sample expect 40 % minority equal number male female . Most parent expect low upper middle class mother . Summary Intervention The goal intervention help child DS develop expressive language skill improve participation social , academic community environment . Children receive direct intervention therapist ; additionally , parent teach use Words + AAC strategies clinic home across routine . Therapists use strategy throughout intervention ; parent learn strategy sequentially . Length Intervention : 4/week 4 month ( 48 session ) ; 40 minute clinic session , 60 minute home session Type Intervention session : 6 workshop , 18 clinic training session , 24 home training session Mode : AAC ( iPad ) verbal input output Maintenance : every six week 6 month completion intervention</detailed_description>
