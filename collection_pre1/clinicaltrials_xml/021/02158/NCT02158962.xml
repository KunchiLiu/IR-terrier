	<detailed_description>I . Background Significance : Several exploratory major control study conduct mainland US show intimate partner violence ( IPV ) intimate partner abuse ( IPA ) risk factor variety physical , reproductive mental health problem , include HIV/AIDS , many area know health disparity African American Latina woman . The current investigator recently complete first in-depth prevalence study violence abuse woman US Virgin island ( USVI ) associate health consequence . This seminal study show 1 ) Lifetime prevalence IPV 32.8 % USVI past two year prevalence 37.2 % % .in sample 1059 woman age 18-55 self-identified African Caribbean African descent intimate partner past two year 2 ) Past two year physical and/or sexual abuse range 4 % island St Croix 9 % St Thomas 3 ) Abused woman significantly risk factor Sexually Transmitted Infections ( STIs ) HIV/AIDS woman abuse , 4 ) Risk factor STIs HIV/AIDS include force vaginal anal sex , woman concurrent partner partner multiple partner , STI , lack consistent condom use , exchange sex ( trade sex material good ) This study also find woman amenable ask IPV health care setting brief intervention could feasibly implement . Preliminary qualitative work illuminate woman 's perception community cultural perspective IPV USVI . The propose randomized clinical trial ( RCT ) build finding prior study . II . Research Strategy : A RCT provide preliminary test intervention design reduce IPV IPA concurrent risk STIs HIV abuse USVI woman empower use safety behavior increase use resource ... IPV IPA link high-risk sexual behavior , inability negotiate safer sex behavior , negative sexual health outcome . The research plan deliver structure intervention reduce devastate impact IPV IPA abuse woman USVI . Time I : Women respond baseline data measure use computer assist self-reports .

Session 1- Risk Reduction Intervention Group . Women Experimental Intervention complete session follow initial assessment group assignment . The ESP-DOVE IPV Empowerment Intervention individualize ( 60 minute ) protocol follow initial enrollment session . Abused woman view video develop US Virgin Islands , use local actor , depict various experience abuse Virgin Island . The abused woman participate one one structure , brochure-based intervention train interventionist address information cycle violence , risk factor may increase woman 's danger homicide ( Danger Assessment ) , choice option ( leave , use local shelter resource , access resource criminal justice system ) , safety planning , specific local national phone number IPV resource . The intervention provide woman information , emphasize option The structured ESP- DOVE intervention interactive encourage woman describe experience choose option proceed . The intervention modify culturally appropriate abused woman African Caribbean African American background live US Virgin Islands . Since context IPV vary considerably , approach allow individualization , client input choice , think enhance intervention success batter woman `` hard reach '' population At time , brochure give nurse interventionists script increase uniformity intervention across woman interventionists . Four major intervention component : ) IPV information , b ) Danger Assessment , c ) Safety Planning , ) Resources explore . At end Session I , woman risk reduction intervention group provide contact information Session 2 schedule one week later . Time 2 : Session 2- Women ass need associate IPV , safety behavior feeling situation evolve . The need resource service explore . The session also focus help woman learn reduce risk HIV/STD infection . This one-on-one behavioral intervention find reduce HIV/STD risk behavior STD morbidity among inner-city African American woman primary care setting NINR fund randomize control trial . The intervention modify culturally tailor abused woman US Virgin Islands involve skill-building one-on-one session facilitator tailor specific need participant conduct HIV/STD risk assessment interview . It involve STD prevention behavioral skill , video clip , condom demonstration , practice anatomical model , role-playing . Curriculum activity also design help woman recognize faulty reason decision-making increase risk HIV infection . The activity help woman understand adverse consequence participate unsafe sexual activity positive consequence safer sexual practice . Contact information Session 3 validate follow group session schedule . Time 3 : Session 3 : The third session consist small group ( 8-10 ) woman supportive/educational session lead interventionist investigator . Sessions hold district USVI schedule two week follow Session 2 . Women experimental intervention group another opportunity integrate issue relate IPV experience . . They interact abused woman set conducive share attitude beliefs IPV prevention , cultural belief IPV , need support , assertiveness training , stress affect management , safety enhancement strategy effective behavior reduce risk HIV sexually transmit disease personal vulnerability . Session three offer twice week district participant opportunity complete intervention . At end session 3 , woman schedule three month follow-up ass outcome . Contact information reconfirm . B .

Participants include woman complete three session Risk Reduction intervention three session Health Education Comparison Control group . The outcome measure complete computer tablet include measure use initial assessment addition assessment change safety prevention behavior . Participants schedule six month follow-up final outcome measure . Time 5 : Final post intervention outcome measure obtain six month participant completes 3 month outcome measure . The woman contact least two week prior schedule outcome measure Caribbean Exploratory NIMHD Research Center Staff re-confirm schedule follow-up repeat process computer tablet include outcome measure use three month assessment . D. Data management 1 . Preliminary Analyses : Microsoft Access Excel use record keep , track , initial data processing . The late version SAS SPSS computer program use data management analysis . Access computer data CDs limit physically electronically . Computers data store office lock use . Access databases restrict read write protection . Data analysis begin preparatory activity treatment miss data , identification outlier data cleaning task . A detailed descriptive analysis quantitative data perform , involve summarization data use inferential graphical exploratory data analytic technique . 2 . Analysis : To conduct preliminary test integrate intervention describe brief description , analysis covariance , frequency logistic regression use explore potential difference predictor variable two group .</detailed_description>
