	<brief_summary>1 . A randomized trial 3-dimensional vs. 2-dimensional ultrasound , compare score Maternal Antenatal Attachment Scale ( MAAS ) , validate instrument measure maternal attachment marker maternal bonding . The hypothesis 3-dimensional ultrasound well elicit maternal attachment 2-D 2 . To assess change maternal confidence stop use drug quit/reduce smoke 3-D vs. 2-D ultrasound . Again , hypothesis 3-D ultrasound improve woman 's confidence stop use substance . 3 . To evaluate 3-D ultrasound improve paternal attachment measure pre- post- score Paternal Antenatal Attachment Scale ( PAAS ) . The hypothesis 3-D ultrasound great effect PAAS score 2-D .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>To evaluate whether 3-dimensional ultrasound improve measure maternal attachment compare 2-D. As substance-using pregnant woman high risk intrauterine growth restriction ( IUGR ) , monthly ultrasound indicate ( Bhuvaneswar , 2008 Mattioli , 2010 ) . The woman receive short questionnaire immediately 2 week examination 22-32 week . We randomize woman receive either 2-D 3-D ultrasound cross-over next ultrasound ( mainly ensure compliance study , woman perceive 3-D ultrasound desirable ) . The majority survey Maternal Antenatal Attachment Scale ( MAAS ) ( Condon 1993 ) evaluate feeling towards fetus , pregnancy , relationship . In addition , three question add questionnaire , address aim 2 , specifically address confidence woman 's ability stop use drug quit decrease smoking . The main outcome measure compare pre/post-ultrasound change MAAS 3-D vs. 2-D ultrasound group . Secondary outcome compliance prenatal care ( miss reschedule visit ) , substance use ( include smoking ) routinely collect woman visit . Additionally , historical control gather Path clinic data ( previously consider exempt University Hawaii Committee Human Studies 2/24/10 ) . Ultrasound exam provide PI train ultrasonographer , use Phillips HD11 WHC 3 4 dimensional ultrasound use . The PI board certify Obstetrician Gynecologist special training use 3 4 dimensional ultrasound . This exam standardized additional 5-10 minute add onto end routine scan growth , obtain suitable 2-D 3-D picture face and/or hand . These additional view routinely do community . A 5-minute consultation do PI scan , opportunity ask question . If previously undiagnosed fetal anomaly suspect base scan ( extremely unlikely give patient previously screen perinatologist ) , referral perinatology consultation make . In extremely unlikely case happen , ultrasound cover patient 's insurance . The patient follow pregnancy measure compliance prenatal care . Data collection purpose study end birth child . If father baby involve , would ask participate . If consent participate , would complete paternal equivalent MAAS ( PAAS ) prior ultrasound two week study .</detailed_description>
