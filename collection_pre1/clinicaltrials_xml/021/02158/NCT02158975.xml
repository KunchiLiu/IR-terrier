	<brief_summary>Historically cutaneous peripheral T-cell lymphoma response rate approximately 30 % standard chemotherapy regimen . We alternatively hypothesize MLN9708 active disease improve best objective response . We also determine extent MLN9708 inhibit GATA-3 ( Trans-acting T-cell-specific transcription factor ) expression , associate poor prognosis , whether GATA-3 expression represent novel predictive biomarker MLN9708 sensitivity .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Open-label , Phase II Study MLN9708 Patients With Relapsed/Refractory Cutaneous Peripheral T-cell Lymphomas</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Up 25 patient meet inclusion exclusion criterion enrol trial two stage . All enrol patient treat MLN9708 4 mg PO weekly ( day 1 , 8 , 15 every 28 day ) disease progression unacceptable toxicity . In initial stage study total 11 patient enrol treated MLN9708 . Should least 4 patient exhibit response ( CR/CRu , PR ) , second stage 14 patient open enrollment . Efficacy assess radiographically , peripheral blood bone marrow examination ( indicate ) , physical exam every 8 week . Safety assess periodic physical exam , laboratory study , adverse event . All patient follow-up visit 35 day ( +/-7 day ) follow last study drug treatment . Patients accessible tumor tissue ask undergo biopsy fresh tissue sample assessment GATA-3 expression . Archived tissue sample initial diagnostic biopsy recent lymphoma biopsy obtain event fresh tumor biopsy obtain . Patients GATA-3+ TCL accessible tumor tissue undergo tumor biopsy day 21 ( +/- 7 day ) cycle 1 . All baseline fresh archive tissue undergo central pathology review confirm diagnosis TCL . The rationale proteasome inhibition T-cell lymphoma , base pre-clinical ( previous phase II ) data , compelling . Therefore , phase II study restrict patient GATA-3 express lymphoma .</detailed_description>
