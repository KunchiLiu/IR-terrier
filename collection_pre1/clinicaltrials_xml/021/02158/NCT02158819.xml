	<brief_summary>The purpose primary objective study compare health economic outcome use patient-matched cutting guide ( Visionaire ) versus use standard instrumentation Total Knee Arthroplasty ( TKA ) . Data collect pre-operatively , intra-operatively post operatively include six week post-operative assessment . The secondary objective study compare safety early readmission rate two technique . The study hypothesis difference cost episode care hospital admission discharge , include pre-operative radiology cost cost resource , Visonaire patient-matched cut guide compare standard instrumentation .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Visionaire Health Economics Study Comparing Economic Outcomes Between Visionaire Standard Instrumentation</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This prospective , randomise pilot study compare health economic outcome TKA use standard instrumentation TKA use patient-matched cut guide . The primary indication study degenerative arthritis knee require unilateral primary total knee arthroplasty . Patients require TKA eligible consent participate randomise TKA The Genesis II™ Total Knee Implant System Legion™ Primary Total Knee System use either Visionaire™ patient-matched cut guide standard instrumentation . The study recruit 1 year patient final follow six week post-operative assessment . The primary objective study evaluate cost episode care hospital admission discharge . This include pre-operative cost , anesthetic cost , operative theatre cost , cost instrument resource . The study also measure length stay well blood transfusion requirement . The secondary objective study compare safety early readmission rate two technique , measure complication rate intra-operatively post-operatively well number patient readmitted hospital prior six week post-operative assessment .</detailed_description>
