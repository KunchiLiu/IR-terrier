	<brief_title>Cystine Capacity Clinical Study ( CysCap )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Cystinuria rare genetic cause kidney stone lead significant morbidity due recurrent nature disease . Despite recent advancement knowledge cystinuria , discovery genetic defect cause disease , study clinical determinant recurrent stone formation . An optimal method measure cystine solubility urine lacking , therefore response pharmacologic dietary therapy often know . Recently , new assay measure amount cystine urine develop call Cystine Capacity , CysCap . It assay add pre-formed amount cystine crystal urine measure amount cystine urine take solid phase ( undersaturated urine ) give solid phase ( supersaturated urine ) . This study seek examine well measure urinary cystine predict stone occurrence , ultimate goal help guide therapy prevent kidney stone cystinurics . This observational study 3 year . Subjects enrol study perform semi-annual 24-hour urine collection . They undergo image kidney every 6 month monitor kidney stone formation growth , order correlate urinary parameter clinical event . The study examine well urinary cystine capacity predict stone formation .</detailed_description>
