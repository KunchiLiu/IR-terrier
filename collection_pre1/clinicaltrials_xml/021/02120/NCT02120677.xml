	<brief_title>Topical Itraconazole Treatment Basal Cell Carcinoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Basal cell carcinoma common type skin cancer Caucasians worldwide . Although rarely metastatic , locally destructive cause disfigurement pain . Current therapy include surgical removal , local destruction , radiotherapy others . Advances understand molecular basis behind BCCs indicate mutation hedgehog signal pathway lead development many sporadically occur BCCs . An oral drug target hedgehog signal pathway show effective treating patient metastatic inoperable BCCs . There evidence itraconazole , commonly prescribed antifungal medication may also affect pathway . It know whether itraconazole ointment apply topically affect growth BCCs .</detailed_description>
