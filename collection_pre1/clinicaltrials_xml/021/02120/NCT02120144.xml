	<brief_title>Effect Observation Plus Imagination Gait Stride Variability Young Older Adults</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>JUSTIFICATION : - In geriatric rehabilitation , gait reeducation , especially fall , often encounter begin , inability walk . The main reason poorly control pain , immobilisation segment entire low limb adaptation certain prosthesis fracture . This delay walk recovery lead briefly acute postural disadaptation expose multiple decubitus complication infection , bedsore muscular atrophy . Conventional rehabilitation technique difficult implement poorly adapt geriatric patient . - Today , many experimental data suggest functional equivalence make movement , imagine observe . These data use support development new rehabilitation technique . For example , mental imagery use learn complex movement order improve motor performance . - Stride variability , specifically stride time variability identify best marker automatic walking , low variability correspond automatic safety gait . - We hypothesize combined effect observation imagination gait use imposed cadency cadency may reduce stride time variability stride time healthy young old adult . The secondary objective study follow : - To examine combined effect observation imagination gait mean value spatio-temporal parameter healthy young old adult . - To study influence age combine effect observation imagination gait mean value coefficient variation spatio-temporal parameter healthy young old adult</detailed_description>
