	<detailed_description>Twenty subject dysphonia cause vocal fold scar age-related dysphonia randomize treatment autologous cultured fibroblast ( azficel-T , n=14 ) placebo ( saline , n=6 ) . Subjects receive treatment vocal fold ( ) lamina propria compartment . Subjects unilateral bilateral vocal fold scarring treat study . Only one vocal fold treat treatment session alternate opposite vocal fold ( applicable ) next treatment . Subjects receive total three treatment study drug ( azficel-T placebo ) one vocal fold treat total six treatment study drug ( azficel-T placebo ) two vocal fold treat approximately 2-week interval . Follow-up examination perform 1 , 4 , 8 , 12 month final treatment . If evident safety issue , follow-up treatment delay withheld . In Blinded Phase study , subject follow safety efficacy 4 month final treatment .
