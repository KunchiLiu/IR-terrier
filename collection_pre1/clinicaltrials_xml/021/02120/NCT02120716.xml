	<brief_summary>The objective study develop determine feasibility computer-delivered intervention ( Health Check-up Expectant Moms ) approach target woman risk HIV/STIs alcohol/drug use pregnancy two phase test : The development aim study : 1 . Develop intervention content . 2 . Perform small open trial ( n = 10 ) computer base intervention ( Health Check-up Expectant Moms ) ass feasibility recruitment target population acceptability intervention study procedure via participant report ease use , helpfulness , overall satisfaction . The pilot study aim study : 1 . Conduct randomize control pilot study sample 50 high risk ( risk HIV/STIs alcohol/drug use ) pregnant woman . 2 . Determine : 1. feasibility computer base intervention 2. acceptability via participant report ease use , helpfulness , overall satisfaction 3. evidence hypothesize effect outcome : propose intervention , comparison time-and-attention-matched control group , produce reduction HIV/STIs risk behavior follow-up assessment 4 month . 3 . Determine intervention condition , relative control , produce reduction alcohol/drug use ( frequency , quantity , heavy drinking/use frequency ) . 4 . Determine effect process variable : participant assign intervention condition , relative control , demonstrate great increase knowledge , readiness change risk perception .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>This R21 assess computer-delivered screening , brief intervention referral treatment ( SBIRT ) approach , Health Check-up Expectant Moms ( HCEM ) , address barrier early identification intervention woman risk HIV/STI primarily , integrate substance use give well-supported relationship risk pregnancy . The study accomplish objective develop pilot testing tailor , motivationally enhance HIV/STI alcohol/drug use risk reduction intervention incorporate motivational interviewing ( MI ) consistent Information-Motivation-Behavior model HIV risk behavior . The HCEM computer-delivered , brief intervention ( one 60-minute session , plus 15-minute booster session within one month ) theory-driven derived empirical support . The study consist follow phase : Development Phase , research team adapt software computer-delivered intervention open trial 10 participant . During Pilot Study Phase , conduct two-group , randomize control study sample 50 pregnant woman endorse HIV/STI alcohol/drug use risk . Study procedure include follow : potential participant complete 10-minute computer-based screener , include question general health , alcohol drug use , sexual behavior . Inclusion criterion participation study include pregnant woman endorse : 1 ) unplanned pregnancy , 2 ) least one unprotected vaginal ( anal ) sex occasion ( USO ) past 30 day , 3 ) current alcohol drug use , risk prenatal alcohol/drug use . Participants meet criterion study base screener consented complete computer-delivered baseline assessment . Study participant complete 60-minute , computer-delivered intervention baseline , 15-minute computer-delivered booster session within one month . Participants randomly assign either HCEM ( i.e. , MI-based brief intervention ) time-and-attention-matched control group ( i.e. , brief series video television show , subsequent rating subjective preference ) . All participant complete computer-delivered , follow-up assessment four month . Results program research expect inform development integrate HIV/STI alcohol/drug use intervention high-reaching widely disseminable within prenatal care .</detailed_description>
