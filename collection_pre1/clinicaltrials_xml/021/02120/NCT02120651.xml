	<brief_summary>The diagnosis tympanic perforation reach high number record otorhinolaryngology service worldwide . Most tympanoplasty perform patient whose cause perforation hearing loss chronic otitis medium ; entity affect population 0.5 30 % , statistic mention 20 million people disease world . Since introduction tympanoplasty second half nineteenth century numerous publication nationally internationally various experience new technique . Including use fibrin monomer . This procedure usually perform use hemostatic sponge recently fibrin monomer , material part basic input surgical hemostatic agent . In hospital perform average 110 tympanoplasty per year percentage non- integrity graft case microscopic tympanoplasty use hemostatic sponge 16 % similar index lack integrity graft microscopic tympanoplasty report worldwide ( 18 % ) , recent addition service fibrin monomer , necessary evaluate material contributes integrity graft microscopic tympanoplasty , report previous study , find integrity material , recommend routine use , improve final prognosis patient .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Objective : Assess effect fibrin monomer integrity graft tympanoplasty compare effect hemostatic sponge hospital specialty Western Medical Center . Material Methods : Clinical trial single blind , parallel-groups randomized assignation . There included patient diagnosis tympanic perforation , candidate surgical treatment perform microscopic tympanoplasty , fulfil selection criterion . The main variable study integrity graft . The statistical analysis perform accord nature variable , continuous data use measure central tendency dispersion qualitative data frequency percentage . To evaluate effect fibrin monomer relative hemostatic sponge , data relate integrity graft group analyze chi-square .</detailed_description>
