	<brief_title>Rapid Determination Of The Clinical Utility Of Perampanel For The Treatment Of Alcohol Dependence</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The main goal propose study determine whether AMPA-R antagonist perampanel alters response ethanol ( i.e. , reward reinforce effect ) use validated laboratory paradigm intravenous ( IV ) ethanol infusion . Fifty non-treatment seek heavy drinker ( NTSHDs , N=50 ) , undergo three test day : receive placebo medication , receive moderate dose perampanel , receive high dose perampanel . This experiment first step series expedient study rapidly determine perampanel 's potential treatment alcohol dependence . If finding show perampanel reduces reward reinforce property alcohol laboratory setting ( human ) , would provide strong rationale clinical treatment trial medication . This approach innovative test highly novel AMPA-R antagonist treatment alcoholism , use state-of-the-art computer assist IV alcohol pump infusion system ( call CAIS ) reduce variability blood alcohol concentration , thus improve data quality .</detailed_description>
