	<brief_summary>Current steroid therapy dry eye disease ( DED ) comprise 2 week duration pulse therapy , administer twice daily ( avoid adverse effect associate long-term steroid use ) . This time frame often short meaningfully resolve inflammation associate DED . DED often occur decrease eye 's tear production increase evaporation tear film ( thin layer tear keep eye moist ) . Eye irritation inflammation ( swell ) often associate DED surface eye unable maintain normal level moisture . This research study look see vivo confocal microscopy ( IVCM ) image use confirm clinical finding ( noted doctor eye exam ) measure immune response inflammation subject 's cornea ( front part eyeball ) . IVCM non-invasive imaging technique image cornea cellular level 800x magnification , use scan laser . The laser use map cornea , damage harm subject 's eye . Studies show IVCM use study cell nerve within cornea , provide well understanding cornea react irritant . IVCM recently use investigator ass extent eye inflammation case dry eye patient . Additionally , study try determine effectiveness two eye-drops , Lotemax artificial tear , treat inflammation associate DED measuring change immune cell IVCM imaging . The subject treat either Lotemax ( loteprednol ) artificial tear ( lubricate eye drop medication ) . Lotemax FDA-approved steroid eye-drop often use treat inflammation associate DED . Artificial tear approve FDA treatment dryness associate DED . Thus , study design determine effect administration topical steroid , Lotemax , treatment period 6 week , use novel method detect efficacy . In order achieve aforementioned goal , subject prospectively randomize one two treatment arm - Lotemax artificial tear . Both group follow study schedule .</brief_summary>
