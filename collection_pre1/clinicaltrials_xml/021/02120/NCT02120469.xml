	<brief_title>Eribulin Mesylate Everolimus Treating Patients With Triple-Negative Metastatic Breast Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To determine safety tolerability everolimus eribulin ( eribulin mesylate ) , determine recommend Phase IB dose ( RP2D ) drug combination patient resistant metastatic triple negative breast cancer ( TNBC ) . ( Phase I ) II . To evaluate event-free survival ( EFS ) rate patient resistant metastatic TNBC RP2D everolimus eribulin determine drug combination worthy study . ( Phase IB ) SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . To determine response rate patient resistant metastatic TNBC . ( Phase IB ) II . To determine overall survival ( OS ) patient resistant metastatic TNBC . ( Phase IB ) III . To determine toxicity patient resistant metastatic TNBC . ( Phase IB ) IV . To determine pharmacokinetics ( PK ) everolimus eribulin patient resistant metastatic TNBC . ( Phase IB ) V. To collect blood , skin punch biopsy , tumor biopsy treatment patient perform proteomic analysis determine level inhibition phosphatidylinositol 3 kinase ( PI3K ) pathway tumor cell versus non-therapeutic target . ( Phase IB ) OUTLINE : This dose-escalation study everolimus . Patients receive everolimus orally ( PO ) daily ( QD ) day 1-21 eribulin mesylate intravenously ( IV ) day 1 8 . Courses repeat every 21 day absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . After completion study treatment , patient follow periodically .</detailed_description>
