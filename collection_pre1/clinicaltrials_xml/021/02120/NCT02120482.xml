	<brief_summary>Recipient desensitization prerequisite successful ABO-incompatible kidney transplantation ( ABOi-KTX ) . Published desensitization protocol commonly include use plasmapheresis selective ( i.e . antigen-specific ) immunoadsorption ( IA ) , together distinct immunomodulatory measure ( e.g . CD20 antibody rituximab ) . Selective IA represent efficient cost-intensive therapy . An alternative could use semi-selective ( non-antigen-specific ) IA . Even though highly efficient deplete ABO-specific IgG , semi-selective IA may marginally affect level ABO-specific IgM , might - due strong complement activate potential Ig class - exhibit potential risk ( hyper ) acute antibody-mediated rejection ( Wahrmann et al . 2012 , Nephrol Dial Transplant ) . In randomized crossover trial ( Eskandary et al . 2014 , Nephrol Dial Transplant ; www.clinicaltrials.gov , NCT01698736 ) recently show combination semi-selective IA together membrane filtration , technique primarily use field LDL apheresis , yield excellent elimination IgM IgG reactivity , well essential macromolecule classical complement key component C1q . In two-center phase 2 pilot study ( N=10 ) plan evaluate safety efficacy alternative desensitization strategy ABOi-KTX .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Combined Apheresis ABO-incompatible Transplantation - Pilot Study</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>-Background study aim ABO-incompatible living donor kidney transplantation ( ABOi-KTX ) offer possibility expand donor pool approximately 30 % . A variety different desensitization protocol show enable successful transplantation across major ABO barrier . In context , apheresis antibody depletion represent therapeutic mainstay . Two distinct technical principle , plasmapheresis ABO antigen-specific immunoadsorption , show allow excellent short- intermediate-term outcome . A particular technical advantage immunoadsorption may high selectivity regard antibody depletion , preclude major loss essential plasma constituent , include coagulation factor albumin , even treatment large plasma volume . Nevertheless , high treatment cost associate use ABO-specific column ( approve reuse ) may limit widespread clinical application . The efficiency semi-selective immunoadsorption technology regard ABO antibody depletion recipient desensitization less well establish . Theoretically , non-antigen-specific immunoglobulin depletion use protein A- , GAM peptide- , anti-Ig antibody-based adsorbers , could bring several advantage , low treatment cost associate use reusable twin column , potential simultaneously deplete antibody also HLA antigen . In randomized control crossover study include patient autoimmune disease , could demonstrate combination semi-selective immunoadsorption together membrane filtration efficiently deplete ABO-specific IgM IgG also significant impact complement level functionality ( Eskandary et al . 2014 , Nephrology Dialysis Transplantation ; www.clinicaltrials.gov , NCT01698736 ) . In non-randomized , open , uncontrolled phase II multi center ( N=10 ) pilot study , investigate whether novel concept combine apheresis safely efficiently apply context ABOi-KTX . - Recipient desensitization Four week schedule transplantation , patient receive CD20 antibody rituximab ( 357mg/m2 ) . Two week ABOi-KTX baseline triple immunosuppression tacrolimus ( trough level 12-15 ng/mL ) , mycophenolate-mofetil ( 2g daily ) steroid ( 25mg daily ) start . IL-2 receptor antibody basiliximab ( 20 mg ) administer directly four day KTX . Combined apheresis treatment ( 6-9 ) start 1-2 week transplantation ( One week initial ABO-antibody titer 1:512 , two week initial ABO-antibody titer ≥1:512 ) . Instead ABO-specific immunoadsorption column ( Glycosorb® AB-columns , Glycorex® , Lund , Sweden ) use GAM-146 synthetic peptide column ( Globaffin® , Fresenius Medical Care , Bad Homburg , Germany ) . To optimize antibody complement elimination membrane filter connect circuit ( MONET® , Fresenius Medical Care , Bad Homburg , Germany ) every second treatment [ target pre-transplant antibody titer : &lt; 1:16 ( IgG ) ; &lt; 1:8 ( IgM ) ] . Whenever reach target titer possible , treatment pursue use antigen-specific immunoadsorption ( Five nine serial treatment include one immediately pre-transplant ) . If treatment also fail reach sufficiently low antibody titer , transplantation carry . In case hypofibrinogenemia ( &lt; 100 mg/dL ) 2-4 unit fresh frozen plasma ( pool single donor ) administer . - Post transplantation management Postoperative management adhere center standard . ABO-antibody titer determine thrice weekly first week post KTX , four week , three month six month . On-demand combined apheresis perform postoperative titer rise &gt; 1:16 first week &gt; 1:32 second week post KTX , case antibody-mediated rejection . A protocol biopsy perform 7th-10th day transplantation . Prophylactic treatment valacyclovir trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole carry six month . Patients regularly see outpatient clinic accord center standard .</detailed_description>
