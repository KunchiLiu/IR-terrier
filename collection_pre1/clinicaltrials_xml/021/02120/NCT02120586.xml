	<brief_title>Preventive Physiotherapy Intervention Elderly People With Sarcopenia</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Sarcopenia syndrome characterize progressive generalized loss skeletal muscle mass strength risk adverse outcomes physical disability , poor quality life death ( Goodpaster et al , 2006 ; Delmonico et al , 2007 ) . The contribute factor related age process , non-optimal diet , bed rest sedentary lifestyle , chronic disease certain drug treatment . Most factor present old population comorbidity , frequently institutionalize receive professional long-term care . Since European Working Group Sarcopenia Older People ( Cruz-Jentoft et al , 2010 ) recommend use presence low muscle mass low muscle function ( strength and/or physical performance ) diagnosis sarcopenia , intervention focus criterion . The aim study prevent loss skeletal muscle mass strength institutionalize elderly sarcopenia . To purpose , investigator study undertakes two physiotherapy intervention preventing/treating Sarcopenia , namely , maintenance muscle mass improvement strength peripheral respiratory muscle . Both intervention common follow feature : supervision , duration , frequency intensity training program . The primary outcome related muscle mass strength . Secondary outcomes related muscle function ( muscle endurance and/or physical performance ) , cost health status ( number fall fracture , exacerbation chronic disease , hospitalization death year conclude physiotherapy intervention ) .</detailed_description>
