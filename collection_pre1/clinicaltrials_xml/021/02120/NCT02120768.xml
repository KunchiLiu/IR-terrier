	<brief_summary>The randomized , control trial aim compare local control rate two surgical resection , barrier resection local wide resection 1cm equivalent normal tissue . This base fact goal local surgical treatment remove tumor negative margin best functional outcome , lack standard principle surgery . Some surgical oncologist recommend enlarge surgical field case associate muscle remove origin insertion , previous surgical scar radiation field also grossly remove , though would extra trauma unacceptable function impairment , believe patient would benefit `` big operation '' . Most surgeon would perform sarcoma resection normal tissue , report fair local control long negative margin obtain . As report various author , recurrent STSs associate high risk develop recurrence compare primary STSs , thus , effort focus category STSs improve outcome .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>1 . Background Soft tissue sarcoma ( STS ) category malignancy mesenchymal origin , incidence 10-20 cases/million account 1 % human malignant neoplasm . The common STSs include undifferentiated polymorphic sarcoma/malignant fibrohistiocytoma ( UPS/MFH ) , synovial sarcoma , fibrosarcoma liposarcoma . The rarity tumor , various subtypes heterogeneous behavior make diagnosis treatment sarcoma challenge . Many patient , especially develop country diagnose late stage disease recurrent sarcoma treat many unplanned resection , would impact limb function even survival . Except unresectable disease , surgical resection remain mainstay treatment soft tissue sarcoma , define aim surgery R0 resection good functional outcome . With development modern strategy technique , limb spar surgery imply 80 % case proven similar local control amputation without sacrifice survival . The common limb spar surgery include compartment resection wide resection . Compartment resection gradually replace functional compartment resection , aim function preservation , far evidence-based clinically comprehensible definition term `` wide resection '' . Many textbook still advocate need obtain 2- 3cm surgical margin width direction resect soft tissue sarcoma , orthopaedic surgical oncologist recommend 1cm 5cm margin width STS . Local recurrence-free interval major end-point evaluate quality surgery , functional outcome treatment morbidity equally important end-points . Five-year local recurrence-free estimation limb trunk wall sarcoma 20 % , approach 10 % . Margin status report key prognostic factor local recurrence . Surgical margin width determine mainly distance tumor edge periphery specimen , co-assessed surgical oncologist pathologist . Different margin width 1-5cm recommend obtain safe margin , state , limb spar surgery , margin exceed 1 cm obtain 47 % patient 's nearly impossible obtain 2 cm margin direction extremity STS . With adjuvant therapy , close dissection adequate order preserve important functional structures， follow question unanswered:1 . How close safe STS resection ? 2 . Is margin close periosteum oncologic result margin close muscular membrane subcutaneous fat ? As know local anatomy influence sarcoma growth set natural barrier extension , sarcoma might infiltrate compress surround structure , thus , rational resection design mainly base understanding characteristic . Scientists investigate different barrier convert different margin width order facilitate safe resection . Among effort , barrier resection report option recurrent extremity STSs obtain satisfactory local control . Barrier resection define `` en bloc '' removal tumor surround barrier . The barrier include muscular fascia , vascular adventitia , epineurium periosteum , case barrier , 3-5cm healthy tissue consider equivalent . Barrier resection develop accord characteristic STSs , feature fact sarcoma take path least resistance initially grow within anatomical compartment arose , phenomenon skip metastasis limit within anatomic compartment primary lesion locate . Furthermore , barrier resection design preoperatively base image study easy perform intraoperatively base understanding local anatomy , also , 's easy pathologist obtain material margin evaluation . Another content barrier resection repair reconstruction , include vessel replacement , dynamic restoration , support wound coverage . With assistance repair reconstruction , sacrifice margin safety would longer need select case , adjuvant radiotherapy would spar . Well define `` R '' classification widely implied determine margin status STSs , brief , R0 microscopically negative , R1 microscopically positive macroscopically negative , R2 macroscopically positive . The goal resection R0 resection good functional outcome , 's impossible confirm margin status cut edge intraoperatively , postoperative examination ca n't guide intraoperative manipulation . So far evidence-based clinically comprehensible definition term `` wide resection '' , though many guideline recommend 1cm normal tissue around tumor . Thus , study aim investigate difference barrier resection 1cm margin resection , local recurrence main end-point , disease specific survival functional outcome secondary end-points . 2 . Aims First end-point : Compare local recurrence barrier resection 1cm margin resection . Secondary end-point : Disease specific survival ( DSS ) Functional outcome ( MSTS ) Surgical complication ( Grade ) The first end-point compare local recurrence barrier resection 1cm margin resection , 's design base follow fact : 1 . In compartment theory Enneking , muscle independent compartment recurrent STSs develop compartment original site . 2 . The `` R '' classification UICC categorize resection margin margin status , margin width , guideline recommend 1cm margin resection muscle resection origin insertion require . As result , local control recurrent STSs report higher recurrent rate compare primary STSs . 3 . Some author China report barrier resection effective local control acceptable extremity functional outcome . 3 . Schedule : From Jan. 2014 Dec. 2018 , follow : 2014.01-2014.03 : Methodology infrastructure construction . 2014.04-2015.09 : Sample collection , Surveillance , data gathering . 2015.10-2018.12 : Followup , data analysis . Patients recurrent extremity STSs candidate study , preoperative CT MRI take orientation . As report previously , barrier resection associate comparable local recurrent rate primary STSs , close 15 % 5 % amputation rate , Eilber report recurrent rate amputation rate recurrent STSs 18 % 38 % , respectively . Muscles trunk n't independent compartment , thus barrier resection feasible patient trunk recurrent STSs . Retroperitoneal STSs distinctive anatomy biological behavior , thus also exclude . 4 . Randomization : Patients would randomize 1:1 two group . Randomization take radiological evaluation inclusion . Patients would stratify accord histologic subtypes adjuvant therapy . Patients would follow least 24 month disease status survival information follow postoperative 60 month .</detailed_description>
