	<brief_summary>The purpose study document effectiveness Nimbus Multi-tined Expandable Electrode ( MEE ) Probe carry heat ablation ( cut ) small medial branch nerve carry pain information facet joint . Subjects select , way clinical evaluation response medial branch block , undergo procedure radiofrequency ablation/neurotomies medial branch specific painful facet joint low back order relieve pain . This carry FDA-approved device use standard technique accept throughout world . The difference study make use MRIs image lesion produce special EMG study look muscle back document effectiveness device create intend lesion . No study kind produce look radiofrequency device treatment low back pain .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Study Timeline , Outline , Methods 1 . Initial evaluation physician study eligibility determination 2 . Presentation study patient inform consent obtain 3 . Baseline paraspinous muscle EMG perform 4 . MB ( medial branch ) /DR ( dorsal ramus ) radiofrequency neurotomy Nimbus MEE probe ( start date ) 5 . Post-operative soreness manage oral topical medication possibly 1-4 physical therapy session , need 6 . MD visit intake evaluation 3 6 week follow procedure . 7 . Paraspinal needle electromyography , use mini-paraspinal mapping ( `` miniPM '' ) technique Haig carry baseline ( pre-procedure ) 3 6 week post-procedure . 8 . MRI , sequence allows volumetric calculation ( see Appendix III ) , obtain ten choose subject 7 day post-procedure . If evidence edema coagulation change volume great 600 cubic mm , evidence bony edema change believe due procedure , follow MRI obtain 14 day post-procedure . If bony edema change present 14 day , repeat MRI obtain 6 week post-procedure . 9 . Procedural detail , include procedural fluoroscopy time , collect subject . A matched cohort patient undergone MB RFN ( radiofrequency neurotomy ) use previous/current method data obtain group comparison . Lumbar Paraspinal Mapping : The adequate cauterization target medial branch confirm use paraspinal mapping ( PM ) technique Haig . This test carried subject 3-6 week post radiofrequency neurotomies , electromyographers blind side level procedure . Subjects find reliable evidence spontaneous electrical activity , detail , deem successful denervation medial branch question . Baseline PM also carry enrollment document normal baseline rule presence spontaneous activity underlie pathology . Those found finding spontaneous activity , upon baseline needle EMG lumbar paraspinals , exclude study . Lumbar MRI - Post-Procedure The ten study participant study undergo lumbar MRI , use sequence allow volume calculation soft tissue bony finding edema coagulation . Experience thus far would indicate zone edema identify , zone tissue coagulation ( small zone edema ) reliably demarcate . Bench research use Nimbus MEE probe indicate zone coagulation 550 cubic mm less , expect finding MRI would consist zone edema range , although MRI evidence edema may find large volume soft tissue , give edema change would expect present area large area coagulation . The intention provide evidence area treat include know location target medial branch , bone edema unintended finding encounter . These MRIs obtain 7 day post-procedure . If evidence unintended bony edema , subject return repeat MRI 14 day post-procedure . If unexpected finding still present 14 day post-procedure , subject ask undergo third MRI 6 week post-procedure . Images interpret radiologist board certify diagnostic radiology . Post-procedure MRI score include documentation presence absence lesion , calculate volume lesion , whether lesion cover anatomical location medial branch , whether evidence bone edema lesion site ( ) .</detailed_description>
