	<brief_summary>Despite neoadjuvant chemoradiation regimen esophageal cancer remain disease poor outcome . The clinical benefit HER2 target trastuzumab show set advanced disease disease safety combine trastuzumab chemoradiation curative set establish . In breast cancer , add value pertuzumab standard treatment trastuzumab show neoadjuvant metastastic setting . Taken together , sound rationale explore combination radiotherapy plus chemotherapy trastuzumab pertuzumab HER2+resectable esophageal cancer . However , since number HER2+ patient set limited , data available safety combination prior major surgery , propose first conduct feasibility study treatment stratgy . When result study show treatment strategy feasible , subsequently design prospective study efficacy primary endpoint .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Feasibility Study Chemoradiation , TRAstuzumab Pertuzumab Resectable HER2+ Esophageal Carcinoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Objective study : Assess feasibility preoperative treatment pertuzumab trastuzumab combine preoperative chemoradiation ( carboplatin , paclitaxel radiation ) term withdrawal rate surgery . Study design : This non-randomized feasibility study Paclitaxel ( T ) , Carboplatin ( C ) , Pertuzumab ( P ) . Trastuzumab ( H ) , radiation ( RT ) follow surgical resection oesophagus . Study population : Patients ( male/female ) histologically proven adenocarcinoma intrathoracic esophagus gastro esophageal junction , age &gt; 18 &lt; 75 year . Intervention ( applicable ) : Paclitaxel 50 mg/m2 Carboplatin AUC = 2 give intravenous infusion day 1 , 8 , 15 , 22 29 . Trastuzumab administer dose 4 mg/kg day 1 , follow 2 mg/kg wk 2-6 . From wk 7 onwards trastuzumab administer dose 6 mg/kg every 3 week . Pertuzumab give 840 mg intravenously administration . Thus , trastuzumab pertuzumab continue eight week end chemoradiation . Surgery plan around week 14 , approximately eight week end chemoradiation .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Histologically proven adenocarcinoma intrathoracic esophagus gastro esophageal junction . HER2positive tumor define either IHC 3+ IHC 2+ , latter combination ISH+ , assess sponsordesignated central laboratory ( pathology AMC ) primary tumor biopsy . Surgical resectable ( T23 , N01 , M0 ) , determine Endoscopic Ultra Sound ( EUS ) CT scan neck , thorax abdomen . T1N1 tumor eligible , T1N0 tumor situ carcinoma eligible . Tumor length longitudinal ≤ 10 cm radial ≤ 5 cm . If tumor extends gastroesophageal ( GE ) junction proximal stomach , bulk tumor must involve esophagus GE junction . The tumor must extend 2 cm stomach . No invasion tracheobronchial tree presence tracheoesophageal fistula . Age ≥ 18 ≤ 75 year . ECOG performance status 0 1 . Adequate hematological , renal hepatic function define : neutrophile ≥ 1.5 x 109/L platelet ≥ 100 x 109/L hemoglobin ≥ 5.6 mmol total bilirubin ≤ 1.5 x upper normal limit creatinine clearance ( Cockroft ) &gt; 60 ml/min Adequate leave ventricular ejection fraction define LVEF ≥55 % . Written , voluntary inform consent . Patients must accessible follow management treatment center . A tumour epicenter stomach great 5 cm GE junction within 5 cm GE junction without extension oesophagus classify gastric cancer . Past current history malignancy entry diagnosis except nonmelanomatous skin cancer , curatively treat situ carcinoma cervix , malignancy 5 year prior enrollment . Pregnancy ( positive serum pregnancy test ) , plan become pregnant , lactation . Patient ( male female ) willing use highly effective method contraception ( per institutional standard ) treatment 6 month ( male female ) end treatment .
