	<brief_title>Combination Hyperthermia Concurrent Chemoradiotherapy ( CCRT ) Treatment Failure Solid Tumors</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The goal study conduct phase II clinical trial evaluate safety efficacy combination low temperature ( 40-43℃ range ) hyperthermia concurrent chemoradiotherapy ( CCRT ) treatment failure solid tumor . There 3 reason conduct clinical trial . Firstly , demonstrate hyperthermia enhance efficacy chemotherapy , radiotherapy chemoradiotherapy various cancer , acceptable safety profile . Secondly , salvage outcome treatment failure solid tumor frustrate . Thermal enhancement ratio ( TER ) observe use hyperthermia combine radiotherapy chemotherapy . This strategy investigate efficacy treat fail previous standard treatment maybe several time salvage therapy . Thirdly , biologically reciprocal complementation hyperthermia , chemotherapy radiotherapy observe . The reason may complicate , include theory involve hypoxia , immunomodulation reperfusion … etc . If immunity microenvironment could improve addition hyperthermia , unexpected survival benefit compare literature may potentially demonstrate study .</detailed_description>

Reirradiation 50Gy/22fx consider NOT tolerable . 2 . Future tumor response treatment study NOT possibly evaluate use image examination endoscopy . 3 . The patient participate clinical trial . 4 . Future regular clinical followup NOT possible . 5 . The patient largearea metallic implant within hyperthermia field ( include metallic hemoclips small area number ) . 6 . The patient pacemaker .</criteria>
