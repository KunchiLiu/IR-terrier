	<brief_summary>The aim study evaluate effectiveness multisensory environment ( MSE ) and/or massage therapy ( MT ) resident severe profound intellectual disability ( ID ) receive massage therapy MSE , activity MSE alone , massage therapy usual care environment , usual care attention . Since yet conclusive evidence show clinical efficacy MT MSE relaxation reduce challenging behaviour , follow null hypothesis suggest : 1 . There difference reduce heart respiration rate MT-MSE , MT , MSE , usual care 10-week intervention period 2-week follow-up . 2 . There difference adaptive behaviour level alertness MT-MSE , MT , MSE , control group 10-week intervention period 2-week follow-up . 3 . There differences frequency severity challenge behaviour MT-MSE , MT , MSE , control group 10-week intervention period 2-week follow-up .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Design : This study adopt mixed method research design , quantitative ( i.e. , randomize control trial design ) qualitative ( exploratory ) approach use . Methods : After study criterion check meet proxy consent obtain , participant undergo period washout ( 4 week ) current multisensory environment ( MSE ) and/or massage therapy ( MT ) session . After , baseline measurement outcome measure take . All randomly assign one four study group , include three treatment group , namely massage therapy MSE ( MT-MSE ) , MSE massage therapy usual care environment ( MT ) , one control ( routine care ) group . The effect three propose intervention routine care group study outcome , include frequency severity challenge behaviour , adaptive behaviour , alertness level , heart respiration rate , compare group baseline , interim ( i.e. , 5 week intervention start ) , immediately completion intervention ( i.e . 10 week intervention start ) , 2 week follow ( i.e . 12 week start intervention , intervention week 11 12 ) . A pilot study conduct review feasibility clarity study procedure , intervention protocol , outcome measurement around 30 patient similar clinical characteristic ( i.e. , 8 subject per group ) start main study . Primary outcome study frequency severity challenge behaviour , physiological sign ( i.e. , respiration pulse rate ) . The secondary outcome level alertness adaptive behaviour . Primary nurse responsible formulate individualize MSE and/or MT program participant three treatment group invite participate face-to-face semi-structured interview order explore perception opinion towards strengths limitation intervention ( ) use , factor influence challenge behaviour disabled resident , suggest strategy reduce client ' challenging behaviour work set .</detailed_description>
