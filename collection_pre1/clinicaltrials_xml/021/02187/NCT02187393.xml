	<brief_summary>The investigator try understand role specific gene function airway surface cell . The investigator know common genetic marker associate various lung disease . However , people genetic marker never develop evidence lung disease , understand marker play role disease . Investigators ask healthy people provide three ( 3 ) tube blood well sample cell nose . Investigators use blood sample provide genetic information ( specifically , presence absence allele know associated pulmonary fibrosis ) . Nose cell individual genetic marker investigator study grown lab allow investigator learn cell respond various form environmental stress , exposure cigarette smoke . The goal study understand specific gene affect airway cell function .</brief_summary>
