	<brief_title>CRLX101 Combination With Bevacizumab Metastatic Renal Cell Carcinoma ( mRCC ) Versus Standard Care ( SOC )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Open-label , randomize , control study patient metastatic RCC ( mRCC ) complete 2 3 prior conventional molecularly target therapy regimen ( i.e . line ) include ≥ 1 VEGF-inhibiting therapy . A total 110 patient 55 per treatment arm recruit 40 clinical site . Subjects randomize either CRLX101 combination bevacizumab ( CRLX101 15 mg/m^2 IV day 1 15 28-day cycle ; combination bevacizumab 10 mg/kg IV day 1 15 28-day cycle ) standard care ( SOC ) . Options SOC treatment include follow agent patient prior exposure : sorafenib ; everolimus ; pazopanib ; axitinib ; bevacizumab ; sunitinib , approve drug consider Medical Monitor represent acceptable standard care therapy . Measurable disease assess every 8 week ( i.e . every 2 cycle ) . Study treatment , investigational reference therapy , continue confirm disease progression . Duration study treatment average expect 6 month . Other reason discontinuation treatment may include Investigator determination clinical progression without CT-Scan confirmation , patient withdrawal , unresolved adverse event , unacceptable toxicity , Investigator decision consultation patient , death , Sponsor determination due protocol violation , Sponsor decision close study . Cross-over treatment permit on-study either assign treatment arm . Bevacizumab chosen combination partner CRLX101 number reason . - Bevacizumab proven activity treatment patient renal cell carcinoma . - Bevacizumab successfully combine many chemotherapy partner include topoisomerase-1 inhibitor irinotecan . - It hypothesize combination bevacizumab CRLX101 may unique clinical activity combination treatment disease due simultaneous inhibition distinct step along ~vHL ┐ HIF → ( CAIX ) → VEGF → VEGFR2 pathway Primary Objective : To assess progression free survival ( PFS ) patient metastatic renal cell carcinoma ( mRCC ) treat CRLX101 combination bevacizumab ( CRLX101+bevacizumab ) vs. standard care ( SOC ) per investigator 's choice . This primary endpoint evaluate accord Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors ( RECIST ) version 1.1 . Secondary Objectives - To assess overall safety tolerability CRLX101+ bevacizumab compare SOC . - To assess overall survival ( OS ) CRLX101+bevacizumab compare SOC . - To assess overall response rate ( ORR ) CRLX101+bevacizumab compare SOC . - To assess overall PFS , OS , ORR among patient clear cell RCC treat CRLX101+bevacizumab compare SOC . - To assess overall PFS , OS , ORR among patient non-clear cell RCC treat CRLX101+bevacizumab compare SOC . - To describe pharmacokinetics ( PK ) CRLX101 administer combination bevacizumab . Exploratory Objectives - To analyze tumor tissue sample biomarkers efficacy CRLX101+bevacizumab treatment group . - To analyze plasma sample biomarkers efficacy treatment correlate efficacy outcomes CRLX101+bevacizumab compare SOC treatment group . - To evaluate pharmacokinetics ( PK ) CRLX101 urine time administer combination bevacizumab patient without non-infective cystitis .</detailed_description>
