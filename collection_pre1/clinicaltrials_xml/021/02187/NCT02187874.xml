	<brief_summary>Early cord clamp delivery common practice many decade part active management third stage labour . However recent year , several study show delayed cord clamping may offer important benefit newborn . The data gather indicate delay cord clamping may particularly useful premature baby , 26 32 week gestational age , reduce need blood transfusion incidence intraventricular haemorrhage . However argue describe potential benefit delay cord clamping could negate increase risk polycythaemia jaundice newborn , well potential interference postpartum haemorrhage management , initial care reanimation premature newborn , possibility cord blood donation . These factor , together lack homogeneity among exist study regard delay cord clamp technique create need , opinion , research , establish proper place measure . Our hypothesis delay cord clamp premature newborn significatively reduces need blood transfusion intraventricular haemorrhage , compare usual early cord clamping . Secondary outcome : - To define impact delay cord clamp neonatal assessment parameter delivery : APGAR score , cord pH , need mechanical ventilation reanimation . - Neonatal mortality morbidity - Effect procedure incidence severity maternal postpartum haemorrhage - To study correlation Iron metabolism reticulocitary haemoglobin level cord infant blood .</brief_summary>
