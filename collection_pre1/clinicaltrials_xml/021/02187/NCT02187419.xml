	<brief_title>Hypnosis Improve Sleep In Menopause</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>It conceptually theorize one hypnosis program ( ) [ dose delivery ] feasible exhibit acceptable adherence daily hypnosis practice improve sleep . The optimal dose ( 3 vs. 5 session ) delivery method ( audio record vs. therapist deliver ) yet unknown . It hypothesize hypnosis program indicate effect objectively measure sleep duration . It expect one hypnosis intervention effect primary outcome ( objectively measure sleep duration ) secondary outcome ( sleep quality , insomnia symptom severity , daytime sleepiness , menopausal symptom , pain , bothersomeness ) . This study provide estimate effect size primary secondary outcome later study . In addition , possible potential covariates age , race , menopausal stage , sleep environment , and/or socioeconomic status require consideration . These explore ( Aim 4 ) guide future , large study . Stratified randomization utilize , one variable present randomization : presence/absence hot flash . `` Presence '' hot flash determine criterion use prior study ( i.e. , 7 hot flash per day , 50 hot flash per week ) screen baseline week . If criterion meet indicate presence hot flash report two week , woman determine hot flash . Objectives - Aim 1 : Determine feasibility adherence four hypnosis program . Feasibility determine ( 1 ) dropout rate le 25 % , ( 2 ) participant ' rating program ( poor excellent ; rating good well define feasible ) , ( 3 ) participant ' rating treatment satisfaction ( completely satisfy completely dissatisfy ) ( 4 ) adverse event ( &lt; 5 % ) . Adherence determine daily at-home practice form . An adherence threshold 75 % utilized level adherence likely need optimal hypnosis program sleep . - Aim 2 : Determine initial effect size primary outcome objectively measure sleep duration , include percent woman achieve clinically meaningful improvement . Wrist actigraphy recording supplement sleep diary use measure sleep duration . Clinically meaningful improvement define percentage woman move poor average sleep duration ( e.g. , &lt; 6.5 hour per night &gt; 6.5 hour &lt; 9.0 per night ) . - Aim 3 : Determine initial effect size secondary outcome sleep quality , insomnia symptom severity , daytime sleepiness , menopausal symptom , pain . - Aim 4 : Examine trend potential covariates include endogenous factor ( e.g. , age , race/ethnicity , menopausal status ) exogenous factor ( e.g. , sleep environment , socioeconomic status ) . Study Design This study design 4-arm comparison , participant randomize follow arm : 1 . Standard audio recording home practice , 5 in-person therapist deliver hypnotic induction 2 . Standard audio recording home practice , 3 in-person therapist deliver hypnotic induction 3 . Standard audio recording , 5 telephone contact encourage home practice 4 . Standard audio recording , 3 telephone contact encourage home practice</detailed_description>
