	<detailed_description>Standard care treatment patient brain metastasis , consider surgically removable , radiation therapy brain lesion . This treatment call Fractionated Stereotactic Radiotherapy ( FSRT ) give without chemotherapy usually 5 day . Researchers study want find add investigational drug , call TPI 287 , standard radiation therapy ( FSRT ) help people brain metastasis cancer . TPI 287 drug test approved sale United States U.S. Food Drug Administration ( FDA ) .</detailed_description>
