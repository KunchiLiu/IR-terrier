In addition , 2010 ACR criterion must meet : Widespread pain index ( WPI ) ≥ 7 symptom severity ( SS ) scale score ≥ 5 , WPI 3 6 SS scale score ≥ 9 Symptoms present similar level least 3 month The subject disorder would otherwise explain pain ADPS ≥ 4 11point numeric rating scale ( NRS ) past 7 day prior randomization ( base completion least 4 daily pain diary 7day baseline period prior randomization ) Subject must document evidence fundoscopic examination ( pupil dilation ) within 12 month prior screen screen . Women childbearing potential ( WOCBP ) must use adequate method contraception avoid pregnancy study 4 week study completion . Clinically significant unstable neurologic , psychiatric , ophthalmologic , hepatobiliary , respiratory , hematologic illness unstable cardiovascular disease ( e.g . severe hypotension , uncontrolled cardiac arrhythmia , myocardial infarction ) concurrent disease within 12 month prior screen opinion investigator would interfere study participation assessment safety tolerability Anticipation initiation significant change normal daily exercise routine need ongoing use concomitant medication nonpharmacological pain management technique may confound assessment efficacy and/or safety Unable undergo prestudy washout prohibit concomitant medication Subjects risk suicide define response ColumbiaSuicide Severity Rating Scale ( CSSRS ) opinion investigator . Note : Patients answer `` yes '' CSSRS question screen must exclude . Such patient refer immediately mental health professional appropriate evaluation . Current severe uncontrolled major depressive disorder anxiety disorder assess Miniinternational Neuropsychiatric Interview ( MINI ) mild moderate major depression anxiety disorder permit provided investigator assess patient clinically stable appropriate entry study .
