	<detailed_description>Radiofrequency ablation ( RFA ) use minimally invasive option eradicate tumor preserve liver function patient impaired function postoperative tumor recurrence . RFA curative small localize HCCs 5 cm diameter . However , long-term prognosis HCC patient treat RFA satisfactory due high incidence recurrence include local tumor recurrence multicentric carcinogenesis . Multimodality treatment need prevent recurrence . Although potential benefit strategy , useful locoregional disease . Sorafenib oral multi-kinase inhibitor systemic drug associate improved overall survival ( OS ) patient advanced HCC . Retrospective randomized study suggest combined use Sorafenib , TACE , RFA may useful patient unresectable HCC . Based information multiple action Sorafenib , hypothesize Sorafenib plus RFA may useful patient early HCC recurrent HCC . Although supportive data clinical trial available , hypothesis support recent animal study . Inadequate RFA show promote rapid progression residual tumor . Adjuvant Sorafenib postpone time recurrence inhibition hypoxia inducible factor-1and vascular endothelial growth factor A ( VEGFA ) . In multifocal tumor model HCC , RFA Sorafenib alone result significant volume reduction non-RFA-targeted tumor , effect enhance modality combine . This phenomenon also demonstrate recent study human subject . Besides advantage , Sorafenib initially promote necrosis , delayed tissue repair RFA adversely affect normal liver parenchyma , could result increase RFA toxicity limit use patient HCC undergone RFA . Thus , overall advantage RFA plus Sorafenib need weigh adverse effect . In investigation , evaluate safety efficacy combination Sorafenib RFA therapy patient Barcelona Clinic Liver Cancer ( BCLC ) Stage 0 -B1 HCC multicenter prospective cohort study . Outcome measure : Post-RFA tumor recurrence</detailed_description>
