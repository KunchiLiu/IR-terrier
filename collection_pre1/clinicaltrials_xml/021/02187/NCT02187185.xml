	<detailed_description>Randomized control trial determine clinical inflammatory benefit Sonicare Flexcare tooth brush follow experimental induction biofilm overgrowth various periodontal condition . This research study Diagnostic Aim Treatment Aim . Aim # 1 examine utility candidate inflammatory biomarkers within saliva discriminate health , gingivitis , mild , moderate severe periodontis ; discriminate active versus inactive state periodontal disease see basal level predict clinical response biofilm overgrowth among various periodontal condition ; Aim # 2 extend claim anti-inflammatory anti-infective efficacy Sonicare/Elite-Flexcare compare manual brushing include 4 level periodontal disease [ BGI-G , P1 , P2 P3 ] .</detailed_description>
