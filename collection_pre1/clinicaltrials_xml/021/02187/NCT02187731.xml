	<brief_summary>The FULIMA study two-center study Odense University Hospital Vejle Hospital , Denmark . The primary objective identify optimal imaging technique study multiple myeloma focus PET/CT MRI . By combine early ( 1 hour ) late ( 3 hour ) 18F-2-fluoro-2-deoxy-D- fluorodeoxyglucose ( 18F-FDG ) -PET/CT scan investigator expect see increased uptake radioactive tracer thus improve ability identify malignant tissue . A second tracer 18F-natrium-fluoride use explore early sign bone remodel . By use new software ( ROVER ) interpret PET data investigator expect obtain quantitative measurement total disease burden less risk misinterpretation data . Diffusion weight MRI ( DWI ) new MRI technique , like PET/CT , make possible quantitatively calculate overall disease activity give early evaluation response chemotherapy . The study examine DWI development standardization . To validate imaging finding explore pathogenetic heterogeneity multiple myeloma , investigator perform CT guide biopsy PET/ DWI positive site . Pathoanatomical immunohistochemical finding gene expression data positive site compare random bone marrow . The question whether disease heterogeneity may explain lack FDG uptake bone marrow patient ? To extent FULIMA study produce useful data , define standardized imaging technique form basis large prospective study national level Denmark .</brief_summary>
