	<brief_summary>Lymphedema ( significant arm swell surgical side ) one common complication follow treatment breast cancer . The impact lymphedema profound , result negative self image , increase anxiety poorer quality life . In time , lymphedema result recurrent infection arm , functional impairment pain . Approximately 21 % woman undergo breast cancer treatment develop lymphedema . Unfortunately life-time condition tend worsen time . Currently , treatment consist intensive physiotherapy , meant reduce arm volume follow wear compression sleeve day maintenance . This study hop show addition night-time compression create measurable reduction arm volume add night-time compression standard care ( daytime compression ) produce improvement quality life breast cancer survivor .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Study See Whether Adding Night-time Compression Standard Care Will Result Improved Control Arm Swelling ( Lymphedema ) Breast Cancer Subjects</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Lymphedema lifetime condition tend worsen time , affect roughly 21 % treat breast cancer patient . An initial intensive rehabilitative treatment usually prescribe reduce lymphedema , follow maintenance program use compression sleeve ( Standard Care ) . However , compression sleeve prescribe daytime use due potential tourniquet effect sleeve roll bunch night . Compression Bandages ( short stretch , low elasticity ) use night proper application take 20-30 minute , require skill apply properly costly . Various type night-compression system garment ( NCSGs ) design alternative Compression Bandages ( CB ) . The objective study determine : 1 . Whether addition night-time compression ( use CB NCSG ) standard care ( daytime compression ) improve control arm lymphedema . 2 . Whether use NCSGs result well outcome quality life , sleep , treatment compliance patient independence use Compression Bandages . The hypothesis : 1 . Standard care plus addition NCSG provide statistically significant improvement management arm lymphedema volume compare standard care alone 12 week . 2 . Standard care plus addition Compression Bandages provide statistically significant improve management arm lymphedema volume compare standard care alone 12 week . 3 . Standard care plus addition NCSG provide statistically significant benefit quality life , sleep self-efficacy standard care plus Compression Bandaging 12 week . Group 1 : Standard care week 1 - 12 Group 2 : Standard care plus night-time Compression Bandaging week 1 - 12 Group 3 : Standard care plus night-time use NCSG week 1 - 12 All three group adopt NCSG use 12 week assessment do ( week 13 - 24 ) . Sample size = 40 participant per group , total 120 patient three site . Participants randomize 1:1:1 ratio Standard , CB NCSG use secure central randomization service administer Clinical Trials Unit Cross Cancer Institute . Women enrol study stratify accrue site lymphedema severity ( i.e . mild versus moderate lymphedema per classification criterion International Society Lymphology ) . Arm volume ( Perometer ) arm fluid ( Bioimpedance analysis ) measure compare unaffected arm . BIA measure impedance flow low alternate electrical current apply body skin electrode . BIA record impedance value limb provide index correlate quantitative measurement volume increase limb size see arm lymphedema . This measurement provide information extracellular fluid change complement data arm lymphedema volume . An Independent Assessor unaware treatment allocation ( blind ) perform measurement arm volume use perometer , bioimpedance analysis , body weight baseline , 6 , 12 , 18 24 week . The duration primary intervention 12 week . Following 12-week intervention period , participant CB standard care group measure NCSG . The follow-up period intervention ( week 13 24 ) follow longitudinal observational design provide opportunity examine factor relate long-term adherence night-time compression . Lymphedema specific questionnaire subject diary complete 6 , 12 , 18 24 week assess subject 's Quality Life , sleep disturbance , self-efficacy treatment adherence .</detailed_description>
