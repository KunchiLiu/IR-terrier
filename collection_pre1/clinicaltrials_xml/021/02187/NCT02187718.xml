	<brief_summary>Rationale : In breast cancer ( BC ) patient , lymph node status key prognostic indicator . At present , axillary ultrasound ( US ) subsequent fine needle aspiration cytology ( FNAC ) suspicious lymph node ( US+FNAC ) widely use pre-operative staging method . When US+FNAC negative , sentinel node procedure ( SNP ) perform breast surgery . Nowadays , axillary lymph node dissection ( ALND ) generally perform one abovementioned diagnostic entity reveals lymph node metastasis . However , extensive role ALND BC patient lymph node metastasis may change diminish upcoming year due emerge evidence completion ALND ( cALND ) affect disease-free survival overall survival early BC patient ( sentinel ) node-positive disease . Whether ALND need patient , base ( axillary ) tumour load . Because fact tumour load reliably evaluate SNP US+FNAC , role SNP might become even important upcoming year . Ideally , status sentinel lymph node know prior breast surgery , patient tailor treatment plan make discussed patient breast surgery . In context , would logical perform SNP local anaesthesia ( LA ) , prior breast surgery . This might lead significantly less two-step surgical procedure general anaesthesia ( GA ) , might also lead reduction depressive symptom anxiety improve quality life ( QoL ) BC patient , BC patient particular risk psychological distress first three month diagnosis BC . Knowing lymph node status complete treatment plan soon possible ( perform SNP LA ) , might reduce psychological distress . To investigate BC patient would benefit SNP LA , investigator recently analyse 1132 BC patient retrospectively . Both prevalence axillary lymph node metastases prevalence false negative result US+FNAC directly associate age &lt; 60 year primary breast tumour size &gt; 20 mm . Hence , BC patient might benefit SNP LA . In present study , value SNP LA BC patient ( i.e . &lt; 60 year breast carcinoma &gt; 20 mm ) analyse . Objectives : Reduction mean number operation general anaesthesia per patient . Improvement QoL . Reduction depressive symptom experience anxiety . Study design : Prospective single centre randomise controlled clinical trial . Study population : Women age 18 60 year diagnose BC AND tumour size &gt; 20 mm ultrasonographically AND negative inconclusive pre-operative US+FNAC . Intervention : Sentinel Node Procedure Local Anaesthesia ( SNP LA ) Control : Traditional Sentinel Node Procedure General Anaesthesia ( SNP GA ) Main study parameter : Primary outcome parameter number operation GA per patient number operation LA per patient . Secondary outcome parameter QoL , experience depressive symptom anxiety . Timeline statistic : The inclusion period conduct 1st July 2014 1st August 2015 , 80 patient enrol study ( alpha 0.05 ; power 0.8 ) . Inclusion 80 patient sufficient reduce number two-stage surgical procedure general anaesthesia 30 % . Data analyse use descriptive statistic , Chi-squared test , Fisher 's exact test , Mann-Whitney U test , Kruskall-Wallis test , student t-test , ANOVA , pair t-test , Wilcoxon signed-rank test , Friedman test , Pearson 's Spearman 's rank correlation coefficient finally logistic linear regression analysis .</brief_summary>
