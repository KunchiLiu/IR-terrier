	<brief_summary>The VIP-U Study clinical trial design investigate effect ustekinumab ( Stelara ) placebo reduce vascular inflammation cardiometabolic risk biomarkers patient moderate severe psoriasis . This study look systemic vascular inflammation study participant test call FDG PET/CT ( fluorodeoxyglucose-positron emission tomography/computed tomography ) . The study also look cardiometabolic identifier ( heart disease metabolic factor ) blood sample , include marker high cholesterol , cholesterol efflux function ( ability cholesterol move body ) , metabolic factor , inflammation . The study also examine effect ustekinumab compare placebo psoriasis activity , severity safety .</brief_summary>
