	<brief_summary>The purpose study compare effect early total oral feed versus conventional oral feed stable VLBW infant . In current clinical practice , introduction oral feed VLBW infant often precede period fast minimal feed fear necrotizing enterocolitis ( NEC ) . However , may associate potential disadvantage increase infectious metabolic complication relate prolong fasting use parenteral nutrition . The study conduct till date show well outcomes improved postnatal growth early initiation fast advancement feed . It still unclear whether stable VLBW baby tolerate total oral feed day 1 life . No study conduct early total oral feed observational work unit show safe without increased incidence feed intolerance NEC . In view uncertainty regard feeding protocol VLBW infant world , investigator decide assess effect early total enteral feeding stable VLBW infant .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Preterm VLBW infant often negligible intrauterine reserve nutrition along host medical condition postbirth include respiratory distress syndrome , hypoxia , hypotension , acidosis , infection surgery . These condition increase metabolic energy requirement nutrient need preterm baby . They require specialised nutrition faster growth rate ; correct growth falter post birth attain appropriate weight gain . Delayed postnatal growth due inappropriate nutrition early period lead long term cognitive impairment decrease school performance . Additional impediment growth high degree biochemical physiological immaturity gastro intestinal tract immature immune system . In current clinical practice , introduction progressive enteral feed preterm VLBW infant often precede period enteral fast minimal enteral nutrition decrease incidence NEC . However , may also potential disadvantage associate delayed introduction progressive enteral feed . Gastrointestinal hormone secretion motility stimulate enteral milk hence delay enteral feeding could diminish functional adaptation gastrointestinal tract . In addition , 'starving ' gut may harmful increase susceptibility infection due impair barrier function intestinal epithelium . Parenteral nutrition ( PN ) , though important role early stabilization allow early calorie intake prevent catabolism , associate significant risk infectious metabolic complication thereby increase mortality morbidity , prolong hospital stay , adversely affect growth development . As per recent literature review , enteral feed many advantage include appropriate intake nutrient . It also promote growth development gut reduces risk infection . It therefore important establish enteral feed early safely possible . It argue risk NEC consider isolation potential clinical outcome determine feed policy practice VLBW infant . A systematically conduct , randomize control trial necessary prove refute benefit early total enteral feeding nutrition . Hence purpose prospective randomize control trial compare benefit early total enteral feed conventional enteral feeding term attainment full feed , incidence sepsis &amp; NEC duration hospital stay .</detailed_description>
