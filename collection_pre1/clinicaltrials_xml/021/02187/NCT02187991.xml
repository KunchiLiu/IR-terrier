	<brief_summary>The goal clinical research study learn study drug , alisertib , combination chemotherapy ( paclitaxel ) , shrink slow tumor growth woman hormone receptor ( HR ) -positive , HER2-negative HR-negative , HER2-negative ( triple negative ) locally recurrent metastatic breast cancer . The safety alisertib combination paclitaxel also study . The physical state patient , symptom , change size tumor , laboratory finding obtain on-study help research team decide alisertib plus paclitaxel safe effective patient type breast cancer . Alisertib belong group drug call Aurora kinase inhibitor . Alisertib block activity Aurora A kinase , protein involved tumor cell multiplication survival . Aurora A kinase express high normal level many type cancer , include breast cancer , preclinical study suggest block activity protein lead death cancer cell . Paclitaxel chemotherapy drug commonly use treat many different kind cancer , include metastatic breast cancer . The reason combine alisertib paclitaxel cancer therapy , combination drug often effective treatment either drug use alone .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Study Compare Alisertib With Paclitaxel vs. Paclitaxel Alone Metastatic Locally Recurrent Breast Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The rationale behind assess effectiveness addition alisertib weekly paclitaxel therapy patient Triple Negative Breast Cancer highly proliferative ER+ HER2- breast cancer base unmet clinical need effective strategy prevent delay resistance taxane therapy metastatic setting . Synergistic additive effect observe breast cancer xenograft model involve alisertib add either paclitaxel docetaxel . Alisertib inhibit Pgp-mediated efflux paclitaxel cell culture model . In addition , Aurora Kinase A frequently overexpressed Triple Negative Breast Cancer ( TNBC ) , expression level show prognostic breast cancer subtypes . The combination alisertib paclitaxel also investigate Phase 1 study patient locally advance metastatic ovarian breast cancer , preliminary evidence activity tumor type include 6 PRs ( partial response ) 3 SD ( stable disease ) 11 patient metastatic breast cancer .</detailed_description>
