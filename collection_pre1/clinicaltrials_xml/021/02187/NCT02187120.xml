	<brief_summary>The purpose research determine whether give severely injured adult drug call tranexamic acid ( TXA ) soon possible injury improve chance survival level recovery six month . After severe injury , person may uncontrolled bleed place high risk bleed death . Coagulation ( formation blood clot ) important process body help control blood loss . Up quarter people severely injured condition call acute traumatic coagulopathy . This condition affect coagulation result break blood clot ( fibrinolysis ) lead increase blood loss increase risk dying . TXA anti-fibrinolytic drug might help reduce effect acute traumatic coagulopathy prevent blood clot break help control bleeding . In Australia , TXA approve use Therapeutic Goods Administration ( TGA ) reduce blood loss need blood transfusion patient undergo surgery ( i.e . cardiac surgery , knee hip arthroplasty ) . Recent evidence large clinical trial ( CRASH-2 ) show early treatment TXA reduce risk death severely injured patient , however majority patient involve study injured country prehospital care limited rapid access lifesaving treatment limited compare available country like Australia New Zealand . It unclear whether TXA reduce risk death degree give alongside lifesaving treatment available patient soon injury country . The hypothesis TXA give early injured patient risk acute traumatic coagulopathy treat country system provide advanced trauma care reduce mortality improve recovery 6-months injury .</brief_summary>
