	<brief_summary>Primary Objectives : To determine maximum tolerate dose ( MTD ) SAR408701 administer monotherapy , every 2 week ( without load dose Cycle 1 ) patient advance solid tumor ( Escalation Phase ) . To assess efficacy accord Response Evaluation Criteria Solid Tumors 1.1 ( RECIST 1.1 ) ( Expansion Phase ) SAR408701 administer every 2 week without load dose Cycle 1 . Secondary Objectives : To characterize overall safety profile SAR408701 . To characterize pharmacokinetic ( PK ) profile SAR408701 potential circulating derivative . To identify recommended phase 2 dose ( RP2D ) SAR408701 . To assess potential immunogenicity SAR408701 .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The study duration individual patient start signature inform consent , include period assess eligibility ( screening period ) approximately 4 week ( 28 day ) , treatment period end-of-treatment visit around 30 day follow last administration study drug , least one follow-up visit end-of-treatment visit . Additional follow-up visit may require resolution stabilization adverse event ( least 30 day ) . Additional test immunogenicity do Day 60 . Treatment may continue precluded toxicity , progression , upon patient 's request . If patient stop study treatment reason disease progression , follow-up visit perform every 3 month disease progression initiation another anti-tumor treatment death , whichever come first .</detailed_description>
