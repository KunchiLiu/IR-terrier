	<brief_summary>This open-label , international , multicenter study investigate safety efficacy GDC-0199 combination bendamustine plus rituximab ( GDC-0199 + BR ) compare BR alone participant relapse refractory fNHL , compare two chemotherapy-containing regimen ( Chemotherapy-Containing Cohort ) . In addition , exploratory analysis safety efficacy GDC-0199 combination rituximab ( GDC-0199 + Rituximab ) , chemotherapy-free regimen , perform ( Chemotherapy-Free Cohort ) . Assignment Chemotherapy-Containing Chemotherapy-Free Cohort decide discretion investigator , unless one cohort open enrollment ; case , participant may enrol open cohort . The first 6 participant enrol Chemotherapy-Containing Cohort ( require ) comprise Safety Run-In group Treatment Arm B , dose GDC-0199 600 milligram ( mg ) combination BR . Once dose chosen Safety Run-In Period , randomization two treatment arm Chemotherapy-Containing Cohort ( Arms B C ) begin . The anticipated time study treatment approximately 24-52 week , depend treatment arm .</brief_summary>
