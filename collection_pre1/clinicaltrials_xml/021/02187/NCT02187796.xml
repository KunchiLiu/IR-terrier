	<detailed_description>As life expectancy increase , dementia becomes common , need correct diagnosis treatment become urgent . Alzheimer 's disease ( AD ) lead cause dementia , diagnosis exclusion cause . Successful treatment HIV/AIDS result patient live long enough develop HIV-Associated Neurocognitive Disorders ( HAND ) , include dementia . The National Institute Mental Health , National Institute Neurological Diseases Stroke , updated standard diagnose HAND . The new criterion create additional category , HIV-associated asymptomatic neurocognitive impairment ( ANI ) , modify name criterion call MCMD ( minor cognitive/motor disorder ) mild cognitive disorder ( MCD ) . HIV-associated dementia ( HAD ) remain unchanged . Their definition HAND include : Cognitive impairment must attributable HIV etiology ( Dementia , Delirium , Depression , CNS neoplasm , CNS infection HIV/AIDS . Cerebrovascular disease , Substance abuse ) . Their criterion state cognitive impairment validate neuropsychological testing . The three category HAND : 1 . HIV-associated asymptomatic neurocognitive impairment ( ANI ) Impairment involve least two cognitive domain , result neuropsychological test performance least 1 Standard Deviation ( SD ) appropriate mean age/education norm : - Information processing speed - Sensory/motor skills - Short-term long-term memory - Ability learn new skill solve problem - Attention , concentration , distractibility - Logical abstract reason function - Ability understand express language - Visual-spatial organization Visual-motor coordination - Planning , synthesize organize ability 2 . Mild Cognitive Disorder ( MCD ) Same ANI patient caregiver report cognitive deficit interfere mental acuity , work efficiency , home make social activity 3 . HIV-associated dementia ( HAD ) Impairment involve least two cognitive domain result neuropsychological test least 2 SD appropriate mean age/education norm : - Information processing speed - Short-term long-term memory - Ability learn new skill solve problem - Attention , concentration , distractibility - Logical abstract reason function - Ability understand express language - Visual-spatial organization Visual-motor coordination - Planning , synthesize organize ability Cognitive impairment significantly interfere work , home life , social activity ADL 's . 4 . Non-HIV healthy Controls Our P300 COGNISION apparatus , provide Neuronetrix , use subject age 60 , whereas participant HAND study young 60 . So , use COGNISION normative data base comparison . We add 10 HIV- healthy control plan 40 HIV+ subject . These HIV- participant age- gender-matched HIV- Asymptomatic Neurocognitive Impairment ( ANI ) patient , undergo assessment Our IRB-approved study HAND limit neuropsychological assessment . The study could improve add biological marker assessment , could help validate HAND category . Such marker P300 event-related potential ( ERP ) , know related cognitive process , attention work memory abnormal neurologic mental disorder . It could also possibly detect vulnerability later cognitive impairment determine normal cognition neuropsychological testing . For example , Olichney et al ( 2011 ) conclude ERP study individual risk AD may reveal neurophysiological change prior clinical deficit , could advance early detection diagnosis `` pre-symptomatic AD '' . Another example association P300 cognition study Onofri et al ( 2003 ) . In study donepezil result improved cognition , measure significant increase MMSE score . This accompanied reduction P3 latency . Logistic analysis show P3 latency predict beneficial effect donepezil .</detailed_description>
