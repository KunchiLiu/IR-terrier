	<brief_summary>Primary Objective : To estimate incidence treatment-emergent treatment-related adverse event treatment blinatumomab pediatric adolescent subject B-precursor ALL second later bone marrow relapse , marrow relapse alloHSCT , refractory treatment Secondary Objective ( ) : To describe key efficacy outcome , include incidence complete response ( CR ) within 2 cycle blinatumomab , minimal residual disease ( MRD ) remission within 2 cycle blinatumomab , relapse free survival ( RFS ) , overall survival ( OS ) , incidence alloHSCT , 100-day mortality alloHSCT . Hypotheses : A formal statistical hypothesis test . The incidence treatment-emergent treatment-related adverse event estimate . Study Endpoints : - Incidence treatment-emergent treatment-related adverse event - Incidence CR within 2 cycle blinatumomab - MRD remission within 2 cycle blinatumomab - RFS - OS - Incidence alloHSCT - 100-day mortality alloHSCT Study Design : Multi-center , open-label , single-arm expand access protocol</brief_summary>
