	<brief_summary>The investigator test whether aminolevulinate-based ( Levulan™ ) Photodynamic Therapy ( PDT ) show effectiveness treatment prevention cutaneous basal cell carcinoma ( BCC ) Basal Cell Nevus Syndrome ( BCNS ) patient . Levulan™ PDT FDA-approved method widely use currently squamous precancers skin . The investigator hypothesize PDT provide exceptional benefit BCNS population PDT nonmutagenic , nonscarring , safely repeat many time . Additionally , study investigate whether difference tumor clearance Blu-U® ( blue lamp ) Aktilite™ ( red lamp ) therapy .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Blue v Red Light During Levulan Based Photodynamic Therapy Patients With Basal Cell Nevus Syndrome</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This pilot intra-patient comparative study evaluate ability cyclic Photodynamic Therapy ( PDT ) use Red ( 635 nm ) Blue ( 400 nm ) light 5-Aminolevulinic acid , eliminate BCC skin cancer occur patient Basal Cell Nevus Syndrome ( Gorlin-Goltz Syndrome ) . Patients receive 3 cycle Red light Blue light PDT treatment , total 6 treatment , 4 month period . Cycles space 2 month apart . Each cycle consist double course PDT treatment treatment space one week apart . Every subject treat two light source , blue red , accord randomize assignment make leave side right side body .
