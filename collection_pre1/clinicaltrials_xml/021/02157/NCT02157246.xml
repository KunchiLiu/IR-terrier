	<brief_summary>A low level oxygen cancer cell make less likely respond chemotherapy radiotherapy treatment . There interest use new drug improve level oxygen tumour . Another approach would increase radiotherapy dose tumour low oxygen level . Before patient rectal cancer , need develop reliable way identify area low oxygen within rectal tumour . This make u able tell patient may suitable change treatment . Traditionally , level oxygen tumour measure insert needle tumour measure directly . This possible rectal cancer . This study design identify best alternative method . We would like blood test , take sample cancer tissue detail scan ( 18F-fluoromisonidazole ( F-MISO ) positron emission tomography , perfusion compute tomography , functional magnetic resonance imaging ) . The result test compare decide give u comprehensive reliable information . Patients Group A go straight surgery . By look marker low oxygen level tumour remove , able find study test perform tumour remove best . By repeat scan able see reliable much change day day basis . We think tumour still low level oxygen 8 10 dos radiotherapy least likely respond treatment . Group B scan radiotherapy treatment 8 10 dos radiotherapy see identify patient persistent low level oxygen .</brief_summary>

The tumour MRI and/or CT measure least 2 cm 2 cm . 3 . MRI confirmation circumferential resection margin involve threaten 4 . Agreement local multidisciplinary team ( MDT ) tumour operable require preoperative CRT . 5 . The patient medically fit operative resection tumour . 6 . Male female , Age least 18 year . 7 . ECOG performance score 02 capable cooperate protocol . 8 . Written ( sign date ) inform consent . 9 . Haematological biochemical index within range show : 1 . Haemoglobin ( Hb ) ≥12.0 g/dL 2 . Platelet count ≥ 100 x 109/L 3 . PT 1014 second 4 . Renal function : Serum Creatinine &lt; 120 mmol/L OR Calculated GFR &gt; 50 ml/min Inclusion Criteria ( Group B ) : 1 . Histologically confirm invasive adenocarcinoma rectum 2 . Pelvic MRI define disease : a. Mesorectal fascia ( MRF ) involve breach . Includes involvement adjacent organ b. Mesorectal fascia threaten ( tumour ≤ 1mm MRF ) . This include . Primary tumour ≤ 1mm MRF ii . Extramural vascular invasion ≤ 1mm MRF iii . Tumour deposit irregular border mixed signal intensity ≤ 1mm MRF c. Low tumours at/below level levator : i. Tumour ≤ 1mm levator two image plane ii . Tumour full thickness muscularis propria beyond level puborectalis sling iii . Tumour involve intersphincteric plane iv . Tumour involve external anal sphincter 3 . Patient consider likely fit surgical resection follow CRT 4 . Patient consider medically fit receive CRT treat oncologist 5 . Male female , Age least 18 year . 6 . ECOG performance score 02 . 7 . The patient willing able give inform consent comply protocol duration study . 8 . Haematological biochemical index within range show : 1 . Haemoglobin ( Hb ) ≥12.0 g/dL 2 . Absolute neutrophil count ≥1.5 x 10^9/L 3 . Platelet count ≥ 100 x 109/L 4 . PT 1014 second 5 . Renal function : Serum Creatinine &lt; 120 mmol/L OR Calculated GFR &gt; 50 ml/min Exclusion Criteria ( Group A ) : 1 . Unequivocal evidence metastatic disease . Patients equivocal lesion determine eligible consensus MDT . 2 . Previous pelvic radiotherapy . 3 . Pregnant breastfeed woman , woman childbearing potential unless effective method contraception use . 4 . Treatment investigational agent , participation another interventional clinical trial within 28 day prior enrolment . 5 . Currently take anticoagulant 6 . Patients reason unable undergo MRI and/or CT scan per local guideline e.g . fit pacemaker , metal fragment around eye , tolerate scan reason allergic contrast agent . 7 . Patients know serologically positive Hepatitis B , Hepatitis C HIV . Exclusion Criteria ( Group B ) : 1 . Previous pelvic radiotherapy ( include brachytherapy ) 2 . Unequivocal evidence metastatic disease . Patients equivocal lesion determine eligible consensus MDT . 3 .

Gastrointestinal disorder would interfere oral therapy bioavailability 6 . Treatment investigational agent , participation another clinical trial within 28 day prior enrolment . 7 . Other psychological , social medical condition , physical examination find laboratory abnormality Investigator considers would make patient poor trial candidate could interfere protocol compliance interpretation trial result . 8 . Patients reason unable undergo MRI and/or CT scan per local guideline e.g . fit pacemaker , metal fragment around eye , tolerate scan reason allergic contrast agent . 9 . Patients know serologically positive Hepatitis B , Hepatitis C HIV . Exclusion Criteria ( Optional supplemental oxygen breathe Groups A B ) : 1 . Ongoing supplemental oxygen part clinical care 2 . Known lung disease carbon dioxide retention 3 . Chronic obstructive airway disease know risk hypercapnia 4 . Most recent available arterial blood gas ( ABG ) current hospital admission demonstrate hypoxia hypercapnia room air . 5 . Any patient felt suitable supplemental oxygen consider appropriately trained clinician .</criteria>
