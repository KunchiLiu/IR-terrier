	<brief_summary>Prevalence type 2 diabetes ( T2D ) increase worldwide . Lifestyle remain cornerstone treatment patient T2D often overweight sedentary . Physical activity improve glucose metabolism patient T2D : increase glucose utilization acute muscle activity improve insulin sensitivity regular training . The molecular mechanism underlie effect exercise glucose metabolism involve glucose transporter GLUT-4 regulate physical activity . Several study meta-analysis show physical activity reduces HbA1c 0.6 % average . In addition , data suggest decrease cardiovascular morbidity mortality physical activity . Recent recommendation T2D management call practice structure type endurance 150 minute per week muscle building 2 time per week . However , implementation recommendation low , even integrated therapeutic education program . Adherence often transient / partial . In addition , many T2D subject unable initiate physical activity disable complication comorbidities major cardiorespiratory deconditioning . Neuro-myo electrical stimulation ( NMES ) physical treatment routinely use functional rehabilitation improve muscle strength volume . The metabolic effect NMES little study . A pilot study conduct team population 18 subject T2D show week daily NMES session significantly improve insulin sensitivity 25 % 50 % good responder . This result contrast low induced energy expenditure 20-minute session bi-quadricipital NMES , suggest possibility humoral neural mechanism associate NMES . To complete work , plan randomize cross-over trial 3 period ( 6 week without NMES ( control ) , 6 week 3 session NMES per week 6 week 5 session NMES per week ) ass glucose profile sedentary T2D subject different period . We hypothesize bi-quadricipital NMES could improve glycemic control T2D subject thus represent alternative traditional physical activity .</brief_summary>
