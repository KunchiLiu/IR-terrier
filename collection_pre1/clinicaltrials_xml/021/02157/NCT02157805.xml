	<brief_summary>This project aim assess impact technological process meat , cook condition , amino acid bioavailability protein metabolism . The hypothesis , even meat consider good provider fast protein could useful prevent sarcopenia age people , manner cook change digestion rate amino acid bioavailability muscle synthesis .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Technological Processes Quality Meat</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Beef meat , whose protein intrinsically label 15 N , previously obtain infuse 15N ammonium sulphate 50 day rumen heifer . Two different cook condition apply meat ( 5 min 55°C v 30 min 90°C ) . Ten healthy elderly volunteer test process meat accord cross-over design , 2 different metabolic study separate least 2 week . Volunteers submit diet control protein content , 4 day ( 1.2 g protein/kg/day ) metabolic investigation . On 2 day metabolic investigation , overnight fast , blood sample collect basal measurement . Then subject perfuse L- [ 1-13C ] leucine 9h30 hour , expire gas blood sample regularly take , CO2 production measure . The volunteer ask eat 130 g beef meat 2.5h onset perfusion . Isotopic enrichment expire gas , plasma alpha-cetoiscaproate free leucine measure determine whole body amino acid flux ( oxidation , protein synthesis proteolysis ) . 15N enrichment leucine allow splanchnic extraction measurement .</detailed_description>
