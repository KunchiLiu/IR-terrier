In addition , inclusion novice experience meditators provide wide range practice experience provide critical information dose-related effect , information lack research literature today . Each project focus examine brain mechanism peripheral biological correlate meditation . Project 1 ( Davidson ) examine impact explicit use mindfulness loving-kindness/compassion strategy emotion regulation , specifically neural , biobehavioral hormonal index reactivity recovery picture human suffer flourishing . Project 2 ( Busse ) investigate brain periphery pathways psychological factor contribute expression asthma symptom . In addition , examine efficacy meditation train reduce inflammatory response allergen asthmatic individual reduce reactivity emotion-related neural circuitry . Project 3 ( Tononi ) examine whether previously report increase gamma oscillation Non-REM ( NREM ) sleep meditators associate change sleep mentation ( Ferrarelli et al . 2013 ) . In addition , project 3 examine relation meditation-induced change brain activity sleep brain activity cognitive function wakefulness .</brief_summary>
