	<criteria>Disease status Parts A B : Histologically cytologically confirm advanced solid tumor metastatic unresectable standard curative palliative measure exist longer effective , regimens contain gemcitabine , cisplatin , and/or etoposide might consider , measurable disease accord RECIST criterion Part C1 : For Prescreening : Advanced ( metastatic locallyadvanced unresectable eligible definitive treatment , e.g. , surgery/radiotherapy ) , histologically confirm nonsmall cell lung cancer ( NSCLC ) Available historical tumor specimen time prescreening willing provide tumor biopsy ( core ) biopsy may consider part standard clinical practice patient Received tolerate standard approve targeted therapy , appropriate tumor genotype For Screening : Measurable disease accord RECIST criterion Part C2 : Advanced ( locallyadvanced incurable metastatic ) histologically confirm estrogen receptor , progesterone receptor , human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 ( HER2 ) negative breast cancer . Adequate available historical tumor specimen willing provide tumor biopsy ( core ) biopsy may consider part standard clinical practice patient Measurable disease accord RECIST criterion Part C3 : Advanced ( locallyadvanced incurable metastatic ) histologically confirm SCLC platinumresistant , define disease progression initial treatment platinumbased regimen progression within 90 day completion platinum therapy . Subjects platinumresistant disease may receive secondline nonplatinumbased chemotherapy subsequently enrol study . Subjects receive resistant secondline platinumbased chemotherapy may also enrol study . Adequate available historical tumor specimen willing provide tumor biopsy ( core ) biopsy may consider part standard clinical practice patient Measurable disease accord RECIST criterion WHO performance status 0 1 Life expectancy ≥12 week Hematological biochemical index within protocol specify range screen . Radiotherapy ( except palliative reason ) endocrine therapy , immunotherapy , chemotherapy previous 4 week ( 6 week nitrosoureas MitomycinC , 4 week investigational medicinal product ) less 4 drug halflives , whichever great , first dose study drug . Parts A B : Greater 6 cycle prior treatment cisplatin and/or carboplatin . ( ) History prior dose reduction dose interruption receive cisplatin carboplatin due toxicity platinum intolerance either agent . Subjects know history Grade 4 thrombocytopenia Grade 4 neutropenia receive prior therapy . Part C1 : Any cytotoxic chemotherapy beyond 1 line platinumbased chemotherapy . One additional line nonplatinum base therapy advance set 1 . Prescreening Only* : Subjects may currently receive platinumbased chemotherapy advance setting , complete 1 line platinumbased chemotherapy currently receive secondline nonplatinumbased therapy maintenance therapy 2 . There restriction prior immunotherapy target therapy unless combine together cytotoxic agent Any prior gemcitabine treatment NSCLC setting within 6 month Subjects know TP53 wildtype , unless determine ATM loss expression screen prescreening plan subject TP53 mutation enrol determined medical monitor Subjects unknown TP53 mutational status enrol group approximately 10 subject without TP53 mutation plan subject TP53 mutation enrol determined medical monitor Part C2 : Any prior platinum therapy adjuvant neoadjuvant within 6 month screen Relapse within 3 month completion prior adjuvant neoadjuvant chemotherapy Any prior chemotherapy metastatic set exception either taxane anthracycline firstline metastatic setting ( ) There restriction prior immunotherapy targeted therapy metastatic setting unless combine together cytotoxic agent Subjects know BRCA1/BRCA2 germline mutation , either determine documented prior Screening , determine Screening . Subjects unknown BRCA1/BRCA2 status may enrol discretion sponsor Subjects document nonbasaloid subtype use molecular profile assay ( e.g . PAM50 assay ) prior Screening Subjects unknown BRCA1/BRCA2 basaloid subtype status enrol number enrol subject approximately 40 . If approximately 40 subject enrol minimum 30 subject basaloid positive BRCA1/BRCA2 germline wildtype enrol , basaloid subtype BRCA status assay require Screening exclude subject basaloid negative BRCA1/BRCA2 germline mutation . Part C3 : Prior platinumsensitive subject , unless progress within 90 day completion platinumbased regimen There restriction prior immunotherapy targeted therapy metastatic setting unless combine together cytotoxic agent During prior carboplatin therapy , requirement dose reduction AUC 5 mg.min/mL discontinuation carboplatin toxicity lack tolerability . Unresolved toxicity Common Terminology Criteria Adverse Events ( CTCAE ) Grade 2 great previous anticancer therapy radiotherapy History spinal cord compression brain metastasis , unless asymptomatic , treated , stable , require treatment steroid least 4 week first dose study drug .
