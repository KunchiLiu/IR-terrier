	<brief_summary>Dose-dense chemotherapy chemotherapy treatment plan drug give less time treatment standard chemotherapy . The two chemotherapy drug use study , docetaxel cisplatin , approve treatment lung cancer give every 21 day . This study explore response chemotherapy drug give every 14 day . In addition , genetic test perform pre-treatment specimen identify signature may predict chemotherapy sensitivity resistance .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Dose-Dense Induction/Neoadjuvant Chemotherapy Locally Advanced Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>All patient receive induction chemotherapy cisplatin docetaxel . Pegfilgrastim administer approximately 24 hour follow end day 1 chemotherapy infusion . Cycles repeat every 2 week 3 cycle . Patients deem resectable undergo surgical resection follow postoperative thoracic radiotherapy . Patients deem inoperable additionally receive concurrent chemoradiotherapy . Response , use radiographic and/or pathologic mean , identify two cohort ; responder nonresponders.Gene expression profiling perform pre-treatment specimen identify signature predict chemotherapy sensitivity resistance . The target enrollment 45 patient .</detailed_description>
