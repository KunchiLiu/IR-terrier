	<brief_summary>This phase I trial study side effect best dose multiantigen deoxyribonucleic acid ( DNA ) plasmid-based vaccine treat patient human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 ( HER2 ) -negative stage III-IV breast cancer . Multiantigen DNA plasmid-based vaccine may target immunogenic protein express breast cancer stem cell component breast cancer resistant chemotherapy ability spread . Vaccines make DNA may help body build effective immune response kill tumor cell .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To determine safety intradermal administration 3 escalate dos STEMVAC ( CD105/Yb-1/SOX2 CDH3/MDM2-polyepitope plasmid DNA vaccine ) patient HER2-negative advanced stage breast cancer . II . To determine immunogenic dose STEMVAC patient HER2-negative advanced stage breast cancer . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . To determine whether STEMVAC T helper 1 cell ( Th1 ) polyepitope plasmid base vaccine elicit persistent memory T cell response whether immunity enhanced/maintained two additional STEMVAC vaccine ( booster ) give 3 9 month prim regimen . II . To evaluate whether STEMVAC vaccination modulates T regulatory cell myeloid-derived suppressor cell ( MDSC ) . OUTLINE : This dose-escalation study . Patients receive CD105/Yb-1/SOX2/CDH3/MDM2-polyepitope plasmid DNA vaccine recombinant human granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor ( rhuGM-CSF ) intradermally ( ID ) every 28 day 3 month booster vaccines 6 12 month absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . After completion study treatment , patient follow twice yearly 5 year .</detailed_description>
