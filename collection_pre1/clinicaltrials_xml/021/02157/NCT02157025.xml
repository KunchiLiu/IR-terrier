	<brief_summary>The majority young child think visual field ( VF ) test peripheral vision similar game ; therefore , surprise difficulty maintain attention VF test thus test reliability suffers consequence . Poor VF reliability longstanding , major issue since lead increase number test and/or long duration time need determine true vision loss . Providers less likely obtain VF test child since result doubtful value challenge interpret inconsistent . Effectively mean child untreated , slowly progressive eye disease may go undiagnosed incur great visual loss . The investigator aim create prototype device investigator hypothesize make VF test engage young child , thus increase attention consistency responses test stimulus , turn improve VF reliability . The component include microdisplay video screen ( 1.5 '' diameter ) fixation target ( instead standard LED light ) display video clip popular cartoon character , audio clip impersonate cartoon character voice present test operator provide instructional feedback base child 's performance testing . Improved VF reliability investigator intervention would translate improved diagnosis care young childrens ' peripheral vision loss widespread implementation investigator innovative , affordable readily adoptable system eye care provider ' office .</brief_summary>
