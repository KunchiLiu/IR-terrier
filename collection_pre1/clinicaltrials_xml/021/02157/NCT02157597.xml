	<brief_summary>Heart surgery young child involve risk . This study look new type monitor may reduce risk . Near Infrared Reflectance Spectroscopy ( NIRS ) aim measure enough blood reach vital organ body . The investigator goal see show problem develop sooner usual . The investigator know time improve blood supply vital organ . The investigator main aim see response work best . The NIRS monitor approve U.S. Food Drug Administration ( FDA ) . The investigator also follow progress recovery surgery Cardiac Intensive Care Unit ( CICU ) . This find use NIRS monitor improve outcome child .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The NIRS monitor record information patient he/she CICU 24 hour . The monitoring consist small sticky pad place child 's forehead trunk . These work like pulse oximeter ( oxygen monitor ) use child already , sensitive detector . NIRS data record operating room CICU baby study . The NIRS value see surgical anesthesia team operate room baby study . Once patient CICU , NIRS value visible CICU team he/she assign intervention group . If he/she assign control group NIRS value visible CICU team . Currently , use NIRS monitor standard care CICU . For half child study ( intervention group ) team follow carefully design plan react change see . For half child ( control group ) team respond change see accord standard practice . For control group NIRS monitoring occur operate room CICU . By use two group , investigator compare NIRS recording . In way investigator find blood supply tissue alter . No standard monitoring treatment withhold patient . Some extra urine test take 24 hour follow surgery . They take catheter insert patient 's bladder , standard heart surgery . No genetic test do . The patient usual medical care follow 24 hour study . The investigator use hospital 's electronic note collect information . This include medication , routine lab vital sign . The investigator may also call family 60 day surgery simple question patient 's current state health .</detailed_description>
