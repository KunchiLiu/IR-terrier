Therefore , novel intervention essential help patient communicate open timely manner oncology clinician support adherence . As part Phase 1 Patient-Centered Outcomes Research Institute ( PCORI ) grant , conduct qualitative interview patient , clinician relevant stakeholder inform development propose mobile app intervention . For randomized-controlled trial , investigator recruit randomly assign 180 adult patient prescribed oral chemotherapy receive either intervention ( complete smartphone mobile app ) standard care . Objective/Hypothesis : The goal study assess feasibility efficacy mobile application help improve adherence oral chemotherapy symptom patient cancer . We administer intervention three cancer center , hypothesize patient use mobile app report good adherence oral chemotherapy well management symptom patient assign intervention . Specific Aims : The primary aim study 1 ) implement patient-centered mobile application ass symptom , side effect , adherence oral chemotherapy feasible use oncology patient , 2 ) evaluate efficacy mobile application improve patient-reported clinical outcome . Study Design : We recruit randomly assign 180 patient three cancer care sit recently prescribe oral chemotherapy receive either mobile app intervention standard care . Participants stratify study site ( i.e . Massachusetts General Hospital ( MGH ) , North Shore , MGH West , Emerson Cancer Centers ) , cancer type , line chemotherapy . This ensure relatively equal percentage patient study site , diagnosis , line chemotherapy represent treatment control group . The mobile app intervention consist complete initial chemotherapy treatment plan oncology clinician , respond weekly assessment regard symptom , side effect , medication adherence , well receive personalize feedback response week 12 week . Medication adherence , symptom severity , quality life serve primary outcome , collect measure quality cancer care secondary target . We also explore whether particular patient characteristic ( i.e . cancer type , demographic ) affect patient response mobile app intervention .</detailed_description>
