	<brief_summary>Obstructive sleep apnea ( OSA ) common type sleep apnea cause obstruction upper airway . The obstruction result period intermittent hypoxia re-oxygenation , lead increase oxidative stress , increase inflammation , endothelial dysfunction , insulin resistance . Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease ( COPD ) lung disease lead poor airflow . This disease lead systemic hypoxia , reduce oxidative capacity , increase inflammation . The direct cause OSA COPD unclear , OSA COPD may link comorbid condition obesity type II diabetes . Upon onset OSA COPD , metabolic disturbance associate obesity type II diabetes exacerbate . Obesity condition characterize increase visceral fat , elevate plasma level free fatty acid , inflammation , insulin resistance . Although effect body fat distribution study patient , increase subcutaneous abdominal fat mass non-OSA old woman show increase morbidity mortality . Fat/adipose tissue active tissue capable secrete proinflammatory cytokine tumor necrosis factor ( TNF ) -alpha interleukin ( IL ) -6 , reactive oxygen specie adipokines . Particularly , abdominal fat prominent source pro-inflammatory cytokine , contributes low grade , chronic inflammatory state patient . Additionally , increase inflammatory state associate reduced lean body mass , together elevate circulate free fatty acid may increase occurrence lipotoxicity insulin resistance . Thus , increase fat deposition associate poor prognosis OSA COPD patient therefore clinical scientific importance understand change fat metabolism digestion result OSA COPD . It therefore hypothesis fat synthesis insulin resistance increase whole body protein synthesis decrease OSA COPD patient , lead poor prognosis .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>This research study involve 3 visit subject healthy control . The first visit screen visit include review informed consent DXA scan second third visit study day . For first test day , 3 hour subject time urine blood sample collection , stable isotope administration ( deuterated water , isotopically label amino acid ) . Subjects allow go home eat normally . On second study day , subject arrive early morning . For duration study , subject lie bed ( except bathroom privilege ) . They watch tv bring use book/tablet . The research nurse study staff present human subject area assist subject necessary . Subjects allow eat drink second test day , except test drink ( meal ) water . One IV catheter place vein arm/hand blood draw . The hand place hot box blood collection . Another IV catheter place contra-lateral forearm prim continuous infusion isotope ( isotopically label amino acid glycerol ) . Each day , total 80-100 ml blood obtain . Stable isotope ingest infused first test day add test drink infuse second day . On second test day , subject fill questionnaire . After completion study , provide subject meal .</detailed_description>
