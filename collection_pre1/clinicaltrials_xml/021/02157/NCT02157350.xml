	<brief_summary>The purpose study determine threshold level proliferative diabetic retinopathy progression regression standard panretinal photocoagulation . Predictors progression regression identify include retinal vessel geometry ( caliber , fractal tortuosity ) , retinal vessel oxygen saturation retinal area non-perfusion .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>IMPETUS 2018 - DETECT six-month prospective study involve 90 treatment-naïve diabetes patient proliferative diabetic retinopathy ( PDR ) refer panretinal laser photocoagulation ( PRP ) treatment Department Ophthalmology , Odense University Hospital July 1st 2014 June 30th 2015 . Project information give prior study ophthalmological department private practicing ophthalmologist Region Southern Denmark . Patients baseline standard examination include wide-field fundus photography , wide-field fluorescein angiography spectral domain optical coherence tomography ( SD-OCT ) order confirm diagnosis PDR . If meet criterion inclusion exclusion , inform study verbally write offer chance participate . Prior first session PRP patient enrol study receive rest baseline examination include retinal oximetry . Standard PRP treatment give two session train doctor . Patients re-examined month 3 6 progression/regression PDR evaluate measure amount fluorescein leakage wide-field fluorescein angiography 1 , 5 10 minute . For patient regression , supplementary PRP offer . After final examination month 6 , patient refer back primary ophthalmologist . A study nurse photographer assign project . All examination standardize study crew fully certify . Data analyze respect endpoint study ( Stata 13 , StataCorp , College Station , Texas ) also use create algorithm use individualized treatment IMPETUS 2018 - TREAT . In Region Southern Denmark estimate 200 treatment naïve patient PDR refer treatment annually . With estimate participation rate 50 % subsequent dropout rate 10 % , IMPETUS 2018 - DETECT include 90 patient . A traditional power calculation feasibly due design study multiple outcome study .</detailed_description>
