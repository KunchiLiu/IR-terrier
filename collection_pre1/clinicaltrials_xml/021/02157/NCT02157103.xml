	<brief_summary>STUDY BACKGROUND : This research involve patient glioblastoma . The drug bevacizumab ( Avastin ) FDA approve treatment glioblastoma get bad standard therapy . For glioblastoma , bevacizumab give vein every 14 day . The purpose study see bevacizumab work well give daily subcutaneous shot give intravenously . A subcutaneous shot like insulin shot heparin shot . The dose bevacizumab give study total slightly low FDA approve dose glioblastoma . STUDY DESCRIPTION : About 10 people take part study . Participants caregiver educate injection give prefilled syrinx take home . Participants caregiver administer bevacizumab subcutaneously day . The bevacizumab store refrigerator . Follow visit weekly first 3 week , every 3 week . After 18 week , follow interval increase every 6 week treat physician 's discretion . Participants keep take bevacizumab : - Tests show benefiting , - The participant bad side effect relate study treatment , - The participant longer comply study requirement , - The participant doctor feel longer participant 's best interest .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>1.1 Primary Aim : To describe MRI response rate regard edema enhancement glioblastoma radiation- related brain enhancement treat subcutaneous ( SQ ) bevacizumab daily . See section 11 detail response assessment . 1.2 Secondary Aims : 1.2.1 To characterize toxicity SQ bevacizumab . 1.2.2 To describe response rate per primary aim ( ) study participant discontinue SQ bevacizumab reason go receive treatment standard IV bevacizumab bevacizumab-containing combination . 2 BACKGROUND 2.1 Bevacizumab monoclonal antibody cancer therapeutic target vascular endothelial growth factor ( VEGF ) FDA approve treatment glioblastoma . Clinical trial bevacizumab glioblastoma multiforme ( GBM ) patient document edema enhancement response rate 75 100 % , consequent improvement neurologic symptom decrease corticosteroid requirement . ( 1-3 ) The FDA approval base response rate ; proof bevacizumab prolongs survival GBM patient . The related VEGF antagonist cediranib decrease brain edema manner comparable bevacizumab ( 4 ) fail prolong survival GBM patient recent phase III study . ( 5 ) Thus bevacizumab remain strictly palliative GBM patient , disease case think curable available treatment . 2.2 Most monoclonal antibody therapeutic remain effective give subcutaneously instead intravenously . ( 6-9 ) Preclinical animal data show true bevacizumab well , 100 % bioavailability SQ compare IV administration . ( 10 ) In mouse tumor model , SQ bevacizumab produce good antitumor effect intravenous bevacizumab . ( 11 ) Some treatment also less toxic give subcutaneously - recent example bortezomib , produce less neuropathy give SQ instead IV effective myeloma . ( 12 ) This presumably low peak dos . There publish correlation dose bevacizumab incidence common side effect , include hypertension proteinuria , well less common dangerous toxicity gut perforation . If toxicity relate peak dos obtain IV administration , may less frequent dose scheme SQ administration yield low sustain stable dose . It clear SQ dose bevacizumab necessary obtain benefit GBM . Although FDA approve dose 10mg/kg every 14 day , early European GBM study use 5mg/kg every 14 day produce similar response rate . ( 1 ) This uncertainty require dose , fact , true disease bevacizumab use ; example see two simultaneously publish phase III ovarian cancer study , one use bevacizumab maintenance 15mg/kg every 3 week half dose 7.5mg/kg every 3 week , low dose study actually obtain improve survival participant compare high . ( 13 , 14 ) It possible least GBM , low dos might better . Some theorize hypoxia produce antiangiogenic treatment promote aggressive , infiltrative tumor phenotype . There thought less complete blockade VEGF would decrease consequent hypoxia conversion aggressive phenotype . ( 15 ) A recent retrospective series report GBM patient encounter bevacizumab toxicity undergo dose reduction longer survival contemporaneously treat GBM patient continue 10mg/kg every 14 day . ( 16 ) Thus ethical perhaps even beneficial explore lower dose bevacizumab treatment GBM . 2.3 The rapid nearly universal response rate GBM patient regard enhancement edema together direct palliative benefit bevacizumab monotherapy make excellent population study alternate dose scheme . In study investigator propose study subcutaneous bevacizumab treatment patient GBM progressive edema represent tumor progression symptomatic radiation aftereffect . All participant receive dose 25 mg SQ daily , would translate 350 mg 14 day 5mg/kg/14 day 70 kg patient - total dose use European GBM series dose use treat metastatic colon cancer . Bevacizumab solution know stable refrigerate prefilled syrinx ( 17 ) , participant would take home , inject manner low molecular weight heparin . Participants would receive weekly toxicity assessment , MRI 3 week look evidence response term reduction enhancement edema ; see section 11 . Those participant response would continue SQ bevacizumab long continue experience clinical benefit . Participants respond , progress initial response encounter toxicity specific subcutaneous route injection discontinue study participation reason would offer conversion standard IV bevacizumab standard care treatment appropriate available . Improvement enhancement / edema among participant convert standard IV bevacizumab bevacizumab contain combination follow secondary endpoint . 2.4 The study would do Simon 2 stage , expect response rate regard enhancement / edema 90 % . If few 5 initial 6 participant show response study end SQ route deem ineffective . If &gt; 4 6 respond , accrual expand total 13 patient . See section 10.1 , . 2.5 The convenience SQ regimen would benefit patient GBM . The current requirement IV therapy require patient travel oncology infusion center IV access place every week , arduous cumbersome . In addition , bevacizumab effective SQ patient GBM , would offer prospect SQ bevacizumab study disease goal devise all-outpatient regimen liberate patient infusion center . Examples include ovarian cancer ( maintenance bevacizumab monotherapy improve survival ) , hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia , combination subcutaneous oral medicine ( e.g . capecitabine , interferon ) treatment metastatic solid tumor .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Diagnosis : Participants glioblastoma eligible study . These include Those histologically proven diagnosis glioblastoma develop new change MRI follow primary treatment . Those received primary treatment histologically proven low grade ( 2 3 ) glioma progress radiographic characteristic transform glioma . Disease status : Patients must abnormal enhancement contrast enhance MRI brain . They must patient bevacizumab indicated appropriate , drug charge insurance . Participants newly detect enhancement eligible , bevacizumab treatment hop prevent symptom . Participants stable enhancement / edema eligible require corticosteroid control symptom , think bevacizumab treatment might allow lower corticosteroid dose improvement symptom . Performance status : Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group ( ECOG ) 03 . Age : Greater 18 year . Life expectancy : &gt; 3 month . Prior therapy : AntiVEGF treatment : 3 month must elapse prior antiVEGF treatment ( example , give component primary treatment ) study participation . These therapy include bevacizumab , cediranib , axitinib , sunitinib well therapeutic target VEGF . Other anticancer treatment : Treatments category include chemotherapy target therapy target VEGF . 14 day must elapse since discontinuation prior chemotherapeutic treatment glioma study treatment . Radiation : Radiation integral primary treatment glioma . All participant study must prior radiation brain . Radiation must complete 14 day prior first study treatment .

Pregnancy breastfeeding : Pregnant breastfeed woman enter study . Renal insufficiency : Patients creatinine clearance less 50 ineligible . Proteinuria : Patients 2+ proteinuria/Moderate baseline ineligible . Comorbidities : Patients may baseline comorbidities laboratory abnormality would grade 3 bad grade toxicity CTCAE ( except alopecia ) . An exception also make neurologic comorbidities ( eg ataxia , aphasia ) arise consequence brain tumor ; symptom severe enough warrant medical treatment offer study definition grade 3 .
