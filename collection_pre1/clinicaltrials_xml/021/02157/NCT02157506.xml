	<detailed_description>This dose finding , randomize , double-blinded , placebo-controlled study continuous 6-hour IV infusion CXL-1427 hospitalize patient systolic heart failure first evaluate four ascend dose level CXL-1427 four cohort 8 patient ( `` Dose Escalation '' cohort ) . Subsequently , three initial dose level CXL-1427 may assess additional `` Expansion '' cohort approximately 16 patient gain confidence result dose level . The CXL-1427 dose evaluate first cohort 3µg/kg/min . The dose level next three sequential Dose Escalation cohorts dependent clinical safety tolerability , well result invasive hemodynamic measurement .</detailed_description>
