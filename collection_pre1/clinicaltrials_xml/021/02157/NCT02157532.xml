	<brief_title>Endovascular Acute Stroke Intervention Trial - EASI Trial</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Background Stroke constitute primary cause acquire disability adult second cause dementia follow Alzheimer disease . The burden disease may substantial since 25 % victim stroke young 65 year . Standard treatment IV rtPA thrombolysis , within 3-4.5 hour first sign . It show patient moderate severe clinical score ( NIHSS 10 ) occlusion proximal large vessel , result adverse clinical outcome . Many study demonstrate early recanalization IV rtPA restrict , large proximal artery . Recanalization large artery occur frequently earlier ( lead good prognosis ) arterial venous access . Biochemical arterial treatment appear thus great efficacy term recanalization large vessel , inconvenient respect setup delay . Several system mechanical intracranial arterial thrombectomy large trunk recently propose available . Results short case series prospective multicentric non randomize study appear favorable . The thrombus obstruct artery reach endovascular mean mechanically remove result orthograde blood flow re-established cerebral territory involve ischemia . Potential advantages mechanical system chemical thrombolysis speed ( minute versus 1 hour ) absence thrombolytic injection . Mechanical thrombolysis thus lead good result injection arterial thrombolytic agent , well increase time window treatment . In addition , hemorrhagic complication reduce . Objectives In situation IV rtPA thrombolysis optimal , presume embolic occlusion large intracranial arterial trunk ( terminal carotid , initial segment MCA , distal third basilar trunk ) moderate severe clinical state ( NIHSS great equal 8 ) situation IV rtPA may contra-indicated : - To validate intra-arterial thrombectomy use acute phase cerebral stroke patient treat IV thrombolysis patient thrombolysis contra-indicated . - To determine whether combined approach , standard treatment plus thrombectomy , superior standard treatment alone within 5 h appearance symptom , patient occlusion proximal cerebral artery follow moderate severe stroke ( great equal 8 ) , evaluate 3 month . Design EASI randomize , control multicentric trial , parallel comparison standard combine ( standard plus thrombectomy ) treatment . All adult present less 5 hour begin symptom NIHSS great equal 8 discordant image data eligible . Occlusion site , available , include intracranial carotid artery , M1 segment middle cerebral basilar artery . 480 patient fulfil eligibility criterion sufficient demonstrate primary hypothesis 15 % difference number subject favorable mRS ( great 2 ) 3 month , assumption 25 % efficacy ( mRS less equal 2 ) IV thrombolytic treatment 3 month . Randomization may take place time follow admission , include IV thrombolysis . The choice early randomization , without knowledge clinical angiographic result IV thrombolysis fulfil several objective : allow timely delivery proven treatment ; prevent unnecessary exposure angiography risk ; set thrombectomy fast possible maximal efficacy . IV thrombolysis carry accord standard practice . Mechanical thrombectomy carry already approve device , accord manufacturer 's instruction , follow diagnostic cerebral angiography . Follow-up include brain image mRS 3 month . Endpoint measure include : - Clinical endpoint measure neurologist , include NIHSS baseline mRS 3 month . - Safety data : complication , death 3 month , hemorrhage accord 24 hour CT scan . The primary efficacy endpoint clinical : favorable mRS ( less equal 2 ) 3 month . The primary safety endpoint rate death 3 month rate symptomatic hemorrhage 24 hour . Secondary efficacy endpoint include : - Comparison ASPECTS score baseline 24 hour CT scan - In thrombectomy group , blood flow treat territory measure TICI reperfusion score 2 3 end treatment . Secondary safety endpoint include - Rate hemorrhage 24 hour CT scan - Frequency severity complication standard treatment - Frequency severity arterial complication thrombectomy group - Frequency severity complication puncture site thrombectomy group</detailed_description>
