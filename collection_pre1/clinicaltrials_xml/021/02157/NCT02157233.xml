	<brief_summary>The potential physical activity non-medicinal method care prevention metabolic cardiovascular disorder insufficiently use . There potential influence environmental heat energetic balance regulation . However , exist knowledge insufficient optimize physical activity program base impact exercise energy intake regulation hot climate . The aim present study define major physiological determinant short-term food intake regulation young active healthy men , expose different level metabolic activity environmental temperature . We thus explore biological mechanism relate post-exercise relative energy intake . Post-rest post-exercise energetic compensation analyse different environmental condition , special focus effect birth weight . This study open interest way define adequate nutritional exercise program hot environment .</brief_summary>
