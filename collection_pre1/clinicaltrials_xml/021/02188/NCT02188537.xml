	<detailed_description>Trial objective : To decide whether addition nelfinavir approve antimyeloma therapy bortezomib dexamethasone sufficient activity proteasome inhibitor-resistant myeloma patient merit clinical investigation prospective control trial . Additional research question : To collect myeloma cell sample proteasome inhibitor-resistant myeloma patient assessment biology proteasome inhibitor resistance identification predictive marker response nelfinavir-based antimyeloma therapy . Primary endpoint : Response rate base best response observe trial Selection patient : - Patients multiple myeloma base standard IMWG criterion , receive least one prior line chemotherapy - Previously expose intolerant least one immunomodulatory drug ( IMID ) ( thalidomide , lenalidomide , pomalidomide ) - Refractory recent proteasome inhibitor-containing regimen progress within 60 day proteasome inhibitor-containing therapy - A bortezomib-based therapy agreement Swissmedic approval indicate intend - Measurable disease base serum paraprotein free light chain level - Adequate hematological , hepatic renal function - Absence myeloma within CNS - No significant neuropathy - No concomitant use list drug replace paused trial treatment ( Amiodarone , Pimozide , quinidine derivative , ergot derivative ( dihydroergotamine , ergotamine , ergonovine , methylergonovine ) , triazolam , midazolam , sildenafil , alfuzosin ) Trial Schedule Duration : The inclusion patient plan start Q3 2014 stop inclusion 34 evaluable patient , expect Q1 2016 . End trial treatment expect Q3 2016 . Trial termination ( last patient last visit ) expect 2017 . Accrual may interrupt trial may stop early base result interim analysis new scientific data become available change assessment risk/benefit . Trial product : For trial nelfinavir IMP . Bortezomib ( Velcade® ) dexamethasone investigational drug context trial , administer background medication . Trial Treatment : The trial treatment design `` add-on '' therapy , nelfinavir add approved bortezomib therapy . Bortezomib dexamethasone background treatment give approve dose schedule ( either i.v . s.c ) , per Swissmedic label international therapeutic standard , combination 2500 mg Nelfinavir bid p.o . day 1-14 6 cycle 21 day . Measurements procedure : Before trial treatment Clinical examination ; blood analysis ; image investigation applicable ( e.g . bone X-ray computer tomography , MRI ) ; electrocardiogram ; evaluation quality life patient 's questionnaire ; pregnancy test woman child-bearing age ; optional : bone marrow sample take translational research . Aside electrocardiogram , pregnancy test quality life questionnaire , pre-treatment assessment perform within frame trial also routinely perform medical care patient multiple myeloma outside trial . During trial treatment Clinical examination blood analysis control safety laboratory parameter ; evaluation quality life patient 's questionnaire perform completion 3 cycle therapy . Besides quality life questionnaire , assessment would also perform routinely outside trial . After trial treatment Clinical examination blood analysis control safety laboratory parameter ; investigation perform within 1 month treatment end , premature interruption administration new antimyeloma therapy . These assessment routinely do also outside trial . Statistical Considerations : The Simon 's two-stage design use . A response rate 15 % less consider uninteresting 35 % high promising . The trial stop early treatment appear unpromising end first stage . To allow patient accrual wait stage-1 result , design modify accord Herndon 's approach . With significance level 5 % power 80 % , total 34 patient require 10 patient first stage 24 patient second stage .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Patient must give write informed consent prior protocolspecific procedure . Patient diagnose multiple myeloma base standard IMWG criterion , receive least one previous line chemotherapy . Patient expose intolerant least one IMID ( thalidomide , lenalidomide , pomalidomide ) . A therapy bortezomib approve dose schedule , base Swissmedic approval ( treatment patient relapsed/refractory multiple myeloma receive least one prior line therapy ) , indicate intend . Patient refractory his/her recent proteasome inhibitorcontaining regimen , base diver criterion . WHO performance status ≤ 3 . Age ≥ 18 year . Adequate hematological value : platelet ≥ 50 x 109/L , hemoglobin ≥ 80 g/L ( may achieve transfusion ) . Adequate hepatic function : bilirubin ≤ 1.5 x ULN ( patient suspect hemolysis : direct bilirubin ≤ 1.5 x ULN ) , ALT ≤ 3 x ULN ( ≤ 5 x ULN liver infiltration myeloma suspect , base image result ) . Calculated creatinine clearance ≥ 15 mL/min , accord formula CockcroftGault , see Appendix 1 ) . Women breastfeed . Women childbearing potential use effective contraception ( see 9.8 ) , pregnant agree become pregnant participation trial 12 month thereafter . A negative pregnancy test inclusion ( within 7 day ) trial require woman childbearing potential . Men agree father child participation trial 12 month thereafter . Completed baseline QoL questionnaire . Evidence ongoing uncontrolled systemic infection . History chronic active HCV HBV . Evidence myeloma within CNS . Psychiatric disorder preclude understanding information trial related topic , give informed consent , fill quality life ( QoL ) form , interfere compliance oral drug intake . Exposure another experimental drug within 3 week prior trial entry . Any serious underlying medical condition ( judgment investigator ) may impair ability patient participate trial , particular uncontrolled clinically significant active disease ( e.g . active autoimmune disease , uncontrolled diabetes , uncontrolled cardiac disease ) . Nonhematologic active malignancy within past 5 year exception ) adequately treat basal cell carcinoma , squamous cell skin cancer , thyroid cancer ; b ) carcinoma situ cervix breast ; c ) prostate cancer Gleason Grade 6 less stable prostatespecific antigen level ; ) cancer consider cure surgical resection unlikely impact survival duration study , localize transitional cell carcinoma bladder benign tumor adrenal pancreas . Concomitant use anticancer medication radiotherapy except local pain control . The use bisphosphonates allow . Significant neuropathy ( Grades 34 , Grade 2 pain ) within 14 day prior enrollment . Known hypersensitivity bortezomib nelfinavir hypersensitivity component drug . Any psychological , familial , sociological geographical condition likely hamper compliance trial protocol follow‐up . Patient take follow drug trial therapy , replace pause .</criteria>
