	<detailed_description>This phase 1 , dose-ranging , randomize ( 5:1 ) , observer-blind , control study safety immune response intramuscular injection PapMV ( Papaya Mosaic Virus ) rVLP ( Recombinant Virus-Like Particles ) PAL adjuvant , `` PAL '' combine Trivalent Influenza Vaccines ( TIV ) one four dose level PAL , combine one two dose level TIV , active control ( TIV ) . The study enroll approximately 48 healthy adult participant , occur 3 year . In first six months/180 day ( Epoch 1 ) study participant visit study site safety immunogenicity outcomes measure . In Epoch 2 ( Day 181 Year 3 ) participant contact telephone email collect unsolicited adverse event . This control clinical trial . The control group receive standard dose TIV , 0.5 mL , consist 15 μg haemagglutinin ( HA ) influenza strain recommend World Health Organization ( WHO ) 2013-2014 influenza season northern hemisphere . An active control use attributable risk adverse event estimate , outcome measure assess blinded fashion . Only adults stable health eligible order minimize participant risk . Only non-pregnant female childbearing age eligible , must agree continue adequate contraception 180 day injection . Study hold rule safety evaluation Safety Review Committee ( SRC ) place . The study follow stagger dose-escalation design , four step introduce new dose adjuvant ( 30 , 60 , 120 240 μg respectively ) . The first dose level PAL adjuvant FB-631 0.5 X 60 µg ( i.e. , 30 µg ) , half dose find immunogenic animal study . The adjuvant co-administered 0.25 mL TIV , half dose TIV routinely administer adult ( i.e . 7.5 μg three influenza subtypes contain vaccine ) . The next dose level 60µg FB-631 combine 0.25 mL TIV . The third dose level 120 μg FB-631 0.25 mL TIV . In fourth final step dose adjuvant 240 μg PAL adjuvant combine 0.25 mL TIV ( 8 participant ) 0.125 mL TIV ( i.e . 3.75 μg HA influenza subtype contain vaccine ) ( 8 participant ) . Any safety signal observe study lead hold decision Safety Review Committee continue , modify suspend conduct study .</detailed_description>
