	<brief_summary>This randomize clinical trial ( RCT ) 300 person serious mental illness ( SMI ) medical comorbidity evaluate outcome n=100 Community Based Health Home alone ( CBHH ) , compare n=100 also receive Self-Management Training ( CBHH+SMT ) , n=100 also receive Automated Telehealth ( CBHH+AT ) . The investigator test follow 3 hypothesis : Hypothesis 1 : CBHH+SMT CBHH+AT compare CBHH alone , associate great health self-management great mental health self-management . Hypothesis 2 : CBHH+SMT CBHH+AT compare CBHH alone , associate great reduction risk early mortality ( Exploratory E2 ) psychiatric symptom . Hypothesis 3 : CBHH+SMT CBHH+AT compare CBHH alone , associate less acute service use less acute service use cost .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Self-Management Training Automated Telehealth Improve SMI Health Outcomes</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Efforts reduce early mortality person serious mental illness ( SMI ) largely focus provide integrate primary care `` health home '' . Yet medical care alone account disproportionately small contribution reduction early morality comparison improve self-management health behavior . Illness self-management training ( SMT ) general population show improve health outcome low cost associate chronic health condition teach coach individual monitor symptom , self-administering treatment , improve health behavior . More recently , use technology Automated Telehealth ( AT ) show improve outcome potentially prevent expensive emergency room acute hospitalization general population daily prompt self-management remote monitoring nurse pre-emptively intervene , guide disease management algorithm . To investigator knowledge , neither approach empirically evaluate integrated component behavioral health home person SMI . The investigator conduct randomize clinical trial ( RCT ) 300 person SMI medical comorbidity evaluate outcome n=100 Community Based Health Home alone ( CBHH ) , compare n=100 also receive Self-Management Training ( CBHH+SMT ) , n=100 also receive Automated Telehealth ( CBHH+AT ) . The investigator test follow 3 hypothesis : Primary H1 : CBHH+SMT CBHH+AT compare CBHH alone , associate great health self-management ( measure Self Rated Abilities Health Practices Scale ) ( Exploratory E1 ) great mental health self-management ( measure Illness Management Recovery Scale ) 4 , 8 , 12 , 24-months . Primary H2 : CBHH+SMT CBHH+AT compare CBHH alone , associate great reduction risk early mortality ( measure Avoidable Mortality Risk Index ) ( Exploratory E2 ) psychiatric symptom ( BPRS ) 4 , 8 , 12 , 24 month . Primary H3 : CBHH+SMT CBHH+AT compare CBHH alone , associate less acute service use ( emergency room visit hospitalization ) ( Exploratory E3 ) less acute service use cost 4 , 8 , 12 , 24-months . In order differentiate CBHH+SMT CBHH+AT find effective , investigator evaluate persistence primary outcome intervention endpoint ( 12 month ) final follow-up ( 24 month ) calculate additional incremental cost implement provide SMT AT . The investigator also explore difference subjective health ( SF-12 ) individual cardiovascular risk factor ( e.g. , BMI , tobacco use , blood pressure , glucose , lipid ) , compare CBHH+SMT , CBHH+AT , CBHH alone . Finally , investigator explore hypothesized mechanism action ( potential mediator ) Aim 2 primary outcome reduce risk early mortality ( i.e. , improvement health self-management ) Aim 3 primary outcome less acute service use ( i.e. , medication adherence number nurse preemptive intervention ) .</detailed_description>
