	<brief_summary>Between 6 16 % patient present hospital emergency department infection , half sign systemic inflammation ( know 'sepsis ' ) . A second issue , time presentation , difficult determine inflammation result infection . Some patient infection deteriorate organ failure ( 'severe sepsis ' ) include failure heart blood vessel maintain normal blood pressure ( 'septic shock ' ) . Septic shock arguably dangerous form severe sepsis associate significant mortality , reduce early intervention . However identify patient high risk deteriorate septic shock difficult initial presentation hospital , thus patient risk 'triaged ' inappropriate level care and/or miss crucial early intervention modify mortality . Equally failure identify patient underlie infection lead potential inappropriate target antibiotic . Existing clinical laboratory test often unable accurately identify patient infection , likely deteriorate severe sepsis septic shock . Investigators group recently identify several signature immune system activation predict patient likely deteriorate , patient suspect infection subsequently confirm . Such test would major benefit management patient early suspect infection sepsis translate test usable everyday clinical practice . This study aim determine prevalence marker cohort patient admit suspected sepsis , predictive ability develop establish septic shock . From investigator aim derive optimal test , test validation cohort ( ExPRES-Sepsis II ) suitable everyday clinical practice , thus take next step towards develop market-ready test . Study hypothesis : Measurement marker immune activation allow ) Risk stratification deterioration severe sepsis ii ) Risk stratification death amongst patient present sepsis iii ) Identification patient confirm sepsis</brief_summary>
