	<detailed_description>An increase individual alcohol dependence receiving specialized alcohol treatment major importance society 's response alcohol problem consequence . The Danish population large intake alcohol . Approximately 20 % adult population heavy drinker ( &gt; 14/21 drinks/ week ( women/men ) ) , 14 % harmful user , 3 % dependent drinker . Untreated alcohol use disorder lead frequent contact health care system associate considerable human societal cost . A first approach would identify recruit patient general hospital , proportion inpatient alcohol use disorder range 16 % 26 % . A referral model ensure treatment alcohol dependent patient discharge need . The main objective study develop strategy increase likelihood patient report outpatient alcohol treatment discharge . It likely optimization transfer procedure hospital outpatient clinic lead patient engage psychosocial treatment alcohol abuse , improve prognosis , reduce re-admissions use hospital bed , thus positive economic consequence . We evaluate Relay Model order ass ) efficacy , ii ) cost-effectiveness iii ) overall societal cost impact . The target group present study patient suffer alcohol dependence admit general hospital locate urban area general hospital locate rural area . A single-blind pragmatic randomise control trial include patient admitted Hospital . The study group ( n=500 ) receive Intervention control group ( n=500 ) refer treatment usual procedure . All patient complete lifestyle questionnaire Danish self-report version Alcohol Use Disorders Identification Test ( AUDIT ) embed case identification strategy . The patient inform alcohol therapist may contact give feedback response . The complete form review daily AUDIT score 8+prompts call Alcohol therapist , attend department different day randomly draw computer . The RELAY MODEL intervention include Brief Motivational Intervention . Patients score AUDIT 16+ also offer appointment alcohol treatment clinic . Primary measure health care expenditures 12 month discharge , accord International Classification Health Accounts , extract population register . The analysis repeat yearly basis follow 5 year . Secondary outcome : The percentage target group , , 30 day discharge , report alcohol treatment clinic . A multiple regression model use . Since non-treated alcohol disorder generate high number societal cost annually health care , social service , traffic accident , criminal activity lose production believe Relay Model either cost-neutral cost-effective , i.e . low net cost compare effectiveness . We expect establish evidence Relay Model either cost-neutral cost-effective , compare referral usual procedure .</detailed_description>
