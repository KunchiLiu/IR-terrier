	<brief_summary>This research study perform evaluate two different dos Tranexamic acid ( TXA ) child craniosynostosis refer Boston Children 's Hospital corrective surgery . This surgery associate significant blood loss frequently require transfusion blood . TXA medication reduces amount bleed surgery improve clot blood surgical site . TXA FDA-approved drug routinely use infant child undergo major surgery include heart surgery , craniofacial surgery scoliosis surgery . It show decrease amount bleed amount blood transfusion need . We would like compare different dos TXA see low dose effect blood loss high dose . We also interest learn TXA seem work well patient others . In order study effect drug would like give drug child measure blood loss volume blood give child his/her surgery . The research do two site ; Boston Children 's Hospital Gaslini Children 's Hospital Genoa , Italy . The main study doctor Boston Children 's Hospital Dr. Susan Goobie . The Department Anesthesiology Boston Children 's Hospital sponsoring study . We plan study total 68 infant child age 3 month 6 year old schedule open craniosynostosis surgery Boston Children 's Hospital Gaslini Children 's Hospital .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Introduction : Over 90 % open craniosynostosis surgical procedure associate transfusion blood blood product . Goobie et . al . recently show tranexamic acid dose 50 mg/kg/15min 5 mg/kg/h significantly reduce blood loss transfusion requirement well overall exposure child donor PRBC two third . However , use moderately high dose regimen , TXA plasma concentration show far exceed accepted therapeutic level ( 10 fold ) . No side effect TXA find study recent study suggest currently recommend high moderate TXA dosing regimen potentially associate neurological complication child . Goobie et . al . develop population pharmacokinetic model TXA simulate dose response curve population . From model simulation , appear reduce load dose 10 mg/kg/15 min follow 5 mg/kg/h infusion adequate maintain plasma concentration accept therapeutic level 20ug/mL . It important test validate reduce dosage scheme multicenter study . The hypothesis reduce dosage scheme ( 10 mg/kg load dose 5 ug/kg/h ) effective high dosage scheme ( 50 mg/kg load dose 5 mg/kg/h ) decrease blood loss transfusion requirement child undergo open craniosynostosis surgery . Thus PK/PD profile TXA craniosynostosis patient determine genomics explore cause interpatient variability response tranexamic acid . Experimental Design : With IRB approval inform consent 68 pediatric patient age 3 6 year come open craniofacial surgery randomize prospective double blind fashion either current standard intravenous TXA dose ( 50mg/kg/15min 5 mg/kg/h ) low TXA dose ( 10 mg/kg/15min 5 mg/kg/h ) end surgery . A standardized anesthetic well define fluid , blood blood product management protocol follow improved modification previously describe protocol . Data Analysis Plan : A preliminary power analysis indicate total sample size 56 child ( 28 randomize group ) would provide 80 % statistical power test whether difference average blood loss equivalent within 25 % ( ie 15 cc/kg ) assume standard deviation 30 % ie +/- 22 ml/kg ( moderate effect size = 0.68 ) . We plan randomize 68 patient ; 34 per group ensure meet sample size requirement account potential 20 % patient drop . Specific Aims : 1 . Determine efficacy TXA ( PD ) infants child undergo open craniofacial surgery low dosage scheme . 2 . Determine population pharmacokinetics ( PK ) TXA infants child undergo open craniofacial surgery dosage scheme . 3 . Determine influence genetics response TXA . 4 . Attempt good define efficacy TXA direct manner use novel innovative approach obtain pre post biological marker fibrinolysis ( bleed blood loss difficult measure accurately indirect measure TXA efficacy inhibition fibrinolysis .</detailed_description>
