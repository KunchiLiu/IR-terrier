	<brief_summary>The purpose study determine combination Everolimus Letrozole effective treatment woman either recurrent persistent epithelial ovarian , fallopian tube , primary peritoneal endometrial cancer . Experiments show everolimus ( Afinitor® ) prevent cell cancer grow number . Therefore , everolimus ( Afinitor® ) test specific disease stop cell grow fast ( cancer ) . Everolimus ( Afinitor® ) FDA approve adult advance kidney cancer ( Renal Cell Carcinoma ) . Everolimus ( Afinitor® ) receive approval patient subependymal giant cell astrocytoma ( SEGA ) , brain tumor see genetic condition call tuberous sclerosis complex ( TSC ) require therapy , candidate surgery . Everolimus ( Afinitor® ) approve pancreatic neuroendocrine tumor ( PNET ) patient unresectable , locally advanced , metastatic disease . Everolimus ( Afinitor® ) receive approval treatment postmenopausal woman advance hormone receptor-positive , HER2- negative breast cancer ( advanced HR+ BC ) combination exemestane , failure treatment letrozole anastrozole . Everolimus ( Afinitor® ) also receive approval treatment patient TSC renal angiomyolipoma require immediate surgery . Everolimus ( Afinitor® ) use treat patient clinical study since 2002 approximately 25,645 patient ( 30-Sep-2012 ) treat everolimus ( Afinitor® ) .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Single Arm Trial With Combination Everolimus Letrozole Treatment Platinum Resistant Relapse Refractory Persistent Ovarian Cancer/Endometrial Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This single arm , non-randomized , open-label study combination everolimus letrozole day dose . Each cycle would 28days patient would scan every 3 cycle response , disease progression document . Subjects take two pill day mouth glass water . Before study… Subjects need follow exam , test procedure find study . These exam , test procedure part regular cancer care may do even subject join study . If subject recently , may need repeat . This study doctor . - Medical history risk physical examination , - Blood test measure blood count , blood mineral level , check liver kidney function , - CT scan MRI abdomen pelvis measure detectable tumor - A pregnancy blood test subject capable become pregnant - Urinalysis ( examination urine ) - The European Organization research treatment cancer global quality life questionnaire C30 ( QLQ-C30 ) -This standard questionnaire help u measure quality life . This questionnaire take subject 15 minute complete complete entry study week 12 24 study . Tests do hepatitis B and/or C : - Subjects risk hepatitis B and/or C subject live live specific geographical area , Asia , Africa , Central South America , Eastern Europe Spain , Portugal Greece ; - The study doctor think appropriate . Subjects positive hepatitis B hepatitis C result screen may require take medication 2 week start everolimus ( Afinitor® ) treatment . During Study… If exam , test procedures show subject study , choose take part , need follow test procedure . They part regular cancer care . - History physical examination - Weekly blood test measure blood count , blood mineral level , blood clot check liver kidney function - Evaluation side effect subject may experience study treatment - Tests hepatitis B and/or C - CT scan MRI abdomen pelvis every 12 week - The European Organization research treatment cancer global quality life questionnaire C30 ( QLQ-C30 )</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Postmenopausal postoophorectomy . Performance status Less equal ECOG 2 Patients must relapse refractory persistent epithelial ovarian , fallopian tube , primary peritoneal carcinoma endometrial cancer . Histologic documentation original primary tumor require via pathology report . Patients must receive treatment platinumbased chemotherapeutic regimen management primary disease contain carboplatin , cisplatin . This initial treatment may include intraperitoneal therapy , consolidation , noncytotoxic agent ( biologic/targeted therapy ) extend therapy administer surgical nonsurgical assessment . Patients must platinumresistant disease , define progression &lt; 12 month completion firstorsecondline platinum base chemotherapy . The date ( platinumfree interval ) calculate last administered dose platinum therapy . Platinum sensitive patient must progressed/relapsed receive second line platinum therapy . Patients platinumrefractory primary disease , define disease3 progression receive firstline platinumbased chemotherapy . Patients allow receive , required receive , one additional cytotoxic regimen management relapse refractory persistent disease . Patients allow receive , require receive , biologic/targeted therapy ( e.g. , bevacizumab and/or PARP inhibitor ) part primary treatment regimen management relapse refractory persistent disease . Patients currently receive anticancer therapy receive anticancer therapy within 4 week start Everolimus ( include chemotherapy , antibody base therapy , etc . ) ; radiation therapy within 2 week . Known intolerance hypersensitivity Everolimus rapamycin analog ( e.g . sirolimus , temsirolimus ) Letrozole . Known impairment gastrointestinal ( GI ) function GI disease may significantly alter absorption oral Everolimus ; Patients severe and/or uncontrolled medical condition : 1. unstable angina pectoris , symptomatic congestive heart failure , myocardial infarction ≤6 month prior start Everolimus , serious uncontrolled cardiac arrhythmia , clinically significant cardiac disease 2 .
