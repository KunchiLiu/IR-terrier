	<brief_summary>This phase I/Ib trial study side effect best dose selumetinib give together cyclosporine treat patient solid tumor colorectal cancer spread place body cure controlled treatment . Selumetinib may stop growth tumor cell block enzymes need cell growth . Biological therapy , cyclosporine , use substance make live organism may stimulate suppress immune system different way stop tumor cell grow . Giving selumetinib cyclosporine may better treatment solid tumor colorectal cancer .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To determine maximum tolerate dose ( MTD ) dose limit toxicity ( DLT ) combination AZD6244 ( selumetinib ) cyclosporin A ( cyclosporine ) adult patient advance solid tumor . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . To determine safety profile tolerability regimen patient population . II . To determine pharmacokinetics combination . III . To evaluate select biomarkers drug effect patient advance solid tumor refractory metastatic colorectal cancer ( CRC ) . IV . Evaluate activity combination term objective response rate ( per Response Evaluation Criteria Solid Tumors [ RECIST ] 1.1 ) , progression-free survival ( PFS ) . OUTLINE : This phase I , dose-escalation study selumetinib follow phase Ib study . Patients receive selumetinib orally ( PO ) twice daily ( BID ) day -7 course 1 day 1-28 ( one dose day 1 ) . Patients also receive cyclosporine PO BID day -3 course 1 day 1-28 ( one dose day 1 ) . Courses repeat every 28 day absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . After completion study treatment , patient follow 30 day .</detailed_description>
