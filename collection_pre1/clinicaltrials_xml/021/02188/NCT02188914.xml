	<brief_summary>Inhalants substance misuse important public health problem whose prevalence approximately 1 % general population 7 % among high school student Mexico . Furthermore Inhalants substance misuse increase recent year ( Villatoro et al. , 2011 ) . According Diagnostic Statistical Manual Mental Disorders fifth edition ( DSM-5 ) inhalant use disorder problematic pattern use hydrocarbon-based inhalant substance lead clinically significant impairment distress . There study suggest long-term exposure inhalant associated structural brain abnormality , well neuropsychological impairment . However many study limit gross anatomical report , therefore necessary use complimentary technique provide good understand brain . To date evidence use positron emission tomography , study employ magnetic resonance imaging methodology diffusion tensor image use know metabolic activity white matter tract integrity respectively inhalant use disorder participant . The purpose study evaluate effect inhalant use disorder brain . The investigator use positron emission tomography ( PET ) , Magnetic Resonance Imaging ( MRI ) diffusion tensor imaging ( DTI ) . As well , study examine impact inhalant consumption executive function performance transcriptomic change associate inhalant consumption . The investigator hope data gather study lead development effective treatment</brief_summary>
