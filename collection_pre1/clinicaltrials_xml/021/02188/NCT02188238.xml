	<brief_summary>The aim study help u understand saliva form thin film inside surface mouth know salivary pellicle , film help protect teeth decay . We know thickness physical property ( viscosity mechanical strength ) salivary pellicle influence : - - How chew sense structure food mouth . - How digest food extract nutrient . - Protection tooth decay infection . However , study recently establish different protein within pellicle . The effect oral care product ( e.g . toothpaste , mouthwash etc . ) ingredient contain pellicle formation removal remain poorly understood . Therefore need understand formation salivary pellicle control ingredient come contact food oral hygiene product ( e.g . toothpaste mouthwash ) . In study , ask volunteer provide sample saliva . We take saliva sample back labs measure form film different condition determine influence ingredient oral hygiene film form property . We also measure protein content saliva sample see affect pellicle formation . Eventually , information together knowledge study , lead development effective oral hygiene product .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Saliva contain many protein component contribute film formation , know saliva form complex , structured film surface . The mucosal salivary layer , comprise mobile layer saliva immobile film salivary protein adsorb onto oral epithelial cell , `` mucosal pellicle '' . The salivary film thin ( 10-100 Âµm ) , extremely viscoelastic aid lubrication , influence sensory perception food mouth maintain oral health . The apparent viscoelastic coating property saliva fact mainly due formation incredibly strong , viscoelastic film surface interface . The solution viscosity saliva actually close water high shear rate , interfacial viscosity 10,000 time great water , completely dominate physical property salivary film whole . This complex structure drive molecular scale interaction think responsible film form property saliva . What still unclear fundamental physical molecular mechanism underlie film form property saliva . Although viscous lubricate property saliva often assign mucin , appear isolated mucin impart lubrication property whole saliva . Other protein statherin implicate enhance boundary lubrication . The molecular composition salivary protein presence ion appear important forming salivary film . For example , parotid saliva contain mucin still highly lubricate probably due highly visco-elastic surface layer . The mucosal pellicle mimic vitro adsorb salivary protein onto model surface form interfacial film show highly lubricate . The presence polyphenols show reduce lubricity surface film correlate well sensory property . At Institute Food Research ( IFR ) 20 year ' experience study protein interface surface , particular competitive adsorption interface proteins surfactant surface-active component affect composition , structure stability interface , control functionality system whole . This applied collaborative study interfacial salivary film Kings College London , demonstrate highly visco-elastic nature salivary film critical importance calcium ion formation . Leading project , recent postgraduate ( PhD ) student project IFR demonstrate added calcium strengthen salivary pellicle , formation pellicle two stage process involve small , surface active protein primary stage , large mucin protein later stage . The study also demonstrate reduce pH reduce integrity pellicle , help u understand role pellicle prevent acid erosion , addition various active ingredient toothpaste mouthwash would remove certain protein pellicle , depend type active ingredient surface pellicle form . We would like extend project look active ingredient mouthwash toothpaste affect structure pellicle , combination ingredients additional effect . Therefore hypothesis active ingredient toothpastes mouthwash use control structure salivary pellicle interaction either surface pellicle adsorb , protein pellicle . Understanding change structure property salivary film could help u understand pellicle active ingredient protect teeth decay disease .</detailed_description>
