	<brief_title>Study Neo-adjuvant Chemoradiotherapy Followed Minimally Invasive Esophagectomy Squamous Cell Esophageal Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Esophageal cancer one difficult malignancy cure . Surgical resection remain primary treatment localized esophageal cancer . It increase chance cure alleviate symptom dysphagia compare nonoperative method . Advances surgical technique equipment make minimally invasive esophagectomy ( MIE ) popular wider application since 1990s . During past two decade , MIE progressively accept alternative treatment esophageal cancer around world . The prognosis improvement account significant advance surgical technique perioperative management , But prognosis patient locally advanced esophageal cancer remain rather poor . As result surgery alone , 5-year survival rate 25 % change significantly several decade . Preoperative chemoradiotherapy follow surgery seem hopefully improve survival EC . Nevertheless , result different study inconsistent . Recently , CROSS trial demonstrate preoperative chemoradiotherapy significantly increase overall survival patient EC compare surgery alone . It notice 84 case ( 23 % ) ESCC enrol trial potential minimal follow-up 2 year , may perfect evaluate effect combine therapy tumor type . Based preliminary study , demonstrate validity safety vinorelbine cisplatin-based neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy . Then carry clinical trial investigate effect multidisciplinary therapy , compare neo-adjuvant chemoradiotherapy follow Mckeown MIE versus Mckeown MIE , pure radical chemoradiotherapy term overall survival time ( OS ) patient Stage IIB III squamous cell esophageal carcinoma .</detailed_description>
