	<brief_title>Ambulatory Post-Syncope Arrhythmia Protection Feasibility Study</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES To conduct prospective observational study assess unique outpatient care model syncope patient provide , train use , wearable defibrillator prior discharge emergency department ( ED ) . Observational data collect assess logistics equip patient device provide training ED , ability patient receive follow-up care outpatient basis . In addition , data collect confirm device meet expect safety . The experience gain stage study use guide future study device 's functionality enhancement definitive device safety efficacy . STUDY POPULATION Participants patient present ED follow syncope event define cardiac , potentially cardiac , i.e . undiagnosed nature . INTERVENTION A wearable defibrillator optimize short-term ambulatory use adhesive electrode prescribe 14 day use follow emergency department discharge physician responsible subject 's care define alternative treatment plan . STUDY DESIGN This single-arm feasibility study . STUDY SIZE The study enroll minimum 50 maximum 80 subject . A maximum 20 center use enrollment .</detailed_description>
