	<brief_summary>Patients severe mental illness ( SMI ) die young person general population . Much excess mortality SMI patient attributable cardiovascular disease , exacerbate treatment second-generation antipsychotic ( 2GAs ) . Although cardiovascular risk well-known , safe , efficacious therapy exists , SMI patient receive cardiovascular prevention drug . Care delivery fragmentation poor patient adherence central problem reduce cardiovascular risk patient SMI . To address problem , propose conduct multi-site , open-label , randomize control trial compare initial treatment strategy free , fixed-doses two generic , cardiovascular prevention drug ( statin angiotensin drug ) deliver within mental health clinic versus usual treatment . The study include adult patient ( 18+ year old ) schizophrenia , schizoaffective disorder , bipolar disorder , major depressive disorder , psychosis NOS receive 2GAs treatment within past six month within four mental health clinic Boston area . We three aim : 1 ) compare proportion subject arm receiving cardiovascular drug treatment adherent therapy 12-months follow-up ; 2 ) compare change composite ( e.g. , Framingham score ) individual ( e.g. , lipid level ) cardiovascular risk factor level use intent-to-treat ( ITT ) approach ; 3 ) compare risk factor level , account variation adherence time , use causal inference technique estimate per-protocol effect intervention . Our three aim examine whether low cost , streamline treatment strategy increase number subject receive cardiovascular prevention therapy improve cardiovascular risk level . We follow subject 12 month , collect interview biometric data baseline follow 12 month . Subjects option continue another 12 month , continue collect interview biometric data , prescribe cardiovascular medication . This population-based initial treatment strategy could effective efficient approach overcome traditional barrier cardiovascular disease prevention within SMI population . Findings study inform effort improve care outcome , enhance survival patient severe mental illness .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>By design , subject Intervention arm start treatment . During course follow-up , expect stay consistently treatment , discontinue treatment ( become non-adherent ) , others make transition treatment various pattern . In contrast , design , subject Usual Treatment ( control ) arm start treatment ; however , initiate treatment result usual clinical care , e.g. , primary care physician initiation . At point compare two binary outcome ( treatment ) use standard method compare two proportion test statistical significance get confidence interval difference percent treatment two arm . Participants ineligible randomization follow similarly participant Usual Treatment Arm , third , non-randomized group , exclude primary analysis .</detailed_description>
