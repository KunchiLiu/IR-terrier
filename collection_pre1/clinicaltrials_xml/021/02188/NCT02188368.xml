	<brief_summary>The purpose clinical research study evaluate safety effectiveness ( good bad effect ) pomalidomide give part combination therapy include steroid treat subject relapse ( subject whose disease come back ) refractory ( subject whose disease respond past treatment ) multiple myeloma ( MM ) . Pomalidomide ( alone combination dexamethasone ) approve United States Food Drug Administration ( FDA ) treatment MM patient receive least two prior therapy , include lenalidomide bortezomib , demonstrate disease progression within 60 day completion last therapy . However , use pomalidomide combination drug use treat MM , chemotherapeutic agent proteasome inhibitor , currently test approve . Pomalidomide drug class thalidomide lenalidomide . Like lenalidomide , pomalidomide drug alters immune system may also interfere development small blood vessel help support tumor growth . Therefore , theory , may reduce prevent growth cancer cell . The test do pomalidomide thus far show well-tolerated effective subject MM combination dexamethasone . Using another drug class , namely proteasome inhibitor , demonstrate simply replace proteasome inhibitor another establish anti-myeloma treatment regimen frequently overcome resistance regardless agent part anti-myeloma regimen . Importantly , toxicity profile new combination closely resemble proteasome inhibitor administer single agent . Based experience , hypothesize replacement lenalidomide pomalidomide yield similar result similar relapsed/refractory MM patient population .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>This phase 2 , multicenter , open-label non-randomized study evaluate efficacy safety pomalidomide replacement lenalidomide among MM patient fail lenalidomide-containing regimen include steroid within 6 month last dose lenalidomide . Pomalidomide replace lenalidomide combination regimen contain alkylating agent ( cyclophosphamide ) , anthracycline ( doxorubicin PLD ) , proteasome inhibitor ( bortezomib carfilzomib ) and/or glucocorticosteroid ( prednisone , dexamethasone methylprednisolone ) . Pomalidomide administered day 1-21 28-day cycle , whereas drug ( anthracyclines , proteasome inhibitor , steroid alkylating agent except melphalan ) administer use schedule ( ) , dose ( ) drug combination last lenalidomide contain regimen patient receive failed . This study enroll patient resistant lenalidomide-containing combination regimen demonstrate PD treat relapse within 6 month last dose lenalidomide last lenalidomide-containing combination regimen lenalidomide lenalidomide steroid maintenance therapy . Forty-five patient enrol study . The study consist : 1 ) screening period ; 2 ) eight 28-day , treatment cycle ; 3 ) final assessment occur 28 day end last treatment cycle ; 4 ) follow-up period.Subjects eligible study receive treatment study drug maximum eight 28-day treatment cycle , depend schedule last lenalidomide contain regimen . Subjects treat maximum response ( low level paraprotein ) plus 1 additional cycle , without exceed total 8 cycle , complete 8 cycle therapy without progress ( PD ) .</detailed_description>
