	<detailed_description>Background : Spontaneous coronary artery dissection ( SCAD ) under-diagnosed poorly understood condition frequently affect young woman without conventional cardiovascular ( CV ) risk factor , result myocardial infarction ( MI ) , cardiac arrest , death . This condition inadequately research , prospective study evaluate management strategy , assess presence impact predispose precipitate cause , assess effect short- long-term CV prognosis . Furthermore , many people present MI due SCAD mis-diagnosed due limitation current `` gold-standard '' diagnostic test ( coronary angiography ) condition , result erroneous diagnosis atherosclerosis , microvascular dysfunction , Takotsubo cardiomyopathy , coronary artery spasm , `` normal '' coronary artery . As , clinician uncertain diagnose , investigate manage patient SCAD , similarly , patient uncertain condition affect subsequent lifestyle long-term cardiac prognosis . Therefore , propose large prospective multicenter Canadian SCAD cohort study ascertain natural history accord predispose arteriopathies treatment strategy long-term CV outcome . The design study secondarily improve diagnosis SCAD coronary angiography participate clinician , provide guidance investigate predisposing condition . Preliminary Data : We enrol 170 NA-SCAD patient registry Vancouver General Hospital . We discover strong association NA-SCAD fibromuscular dysplasia ( FMD ) , ~80 % NA-SCAD patient diagnose concomitant FMD . Of patient underwent coronary angioplasty/stenting , successful durable result occur 33 % . Of patient treat medically , repeat coronary angiogram show angiographic healing . Primary Objective : 1 . To evaluate overall natural history NA-SCAD : ( ) overall in-hospital long-term CV outcome NA-SCAD , ( b ) prevalence effect predispose arteriopathies in-hospital long-term CV outcome , ( c ) prevalence impact precipitate stressor in-hospital long-term CV event . Secondary Objectives : 2 . To evaluate in-hospital long-term outcome conservative therapy revascularization patient NA-SCAD . 3 . To evaluate present angiographic pattern NA-SCAD . 4 . To assess incidence spontaneous arterial heal conservative medical therapy alone NA-SCAD patient undergo repeat angiography . Hypotheses : 1 . We hypothesize NA-SCAD patient high risk long-term recurrent CV event FMD , frequently observe predispose condition confers lower subsequent risk compare arteriopathies , peripartum SCAD , regard CV outcomes . We hypothesize precipitate stressor common precede SCAD event &gt; 50 % case . 2 . We hypothesize NA-SCAD patient high risk long-term CV event , patient undergo revascularization bad CV outcome . 3 . We hypothesize common angiographic NA-SCAD pattern diffuse stenosis . 4 . We hypothesize conservative medical therapy associate high rate spontaneous healing . Methodology : Prospective Canadian observational cohort study enrol 750 consecutive patient present MI ( NSTEMI STEMI ) due NA-SCAD . Both woman men include . Rigorous coronary angiographic criterion supplementary intracoronary imaging ( review core laboratory ) use SCAD diagnosis . Detailed baseline demographic , target history predispose precipitate factor , screen laboratory test perform . Patients prospectively follow 3 year CV event . Significance : This study significant impact diagnosis , investigation , management NA-SCAD . Our diagnostic algorithm help establish guideline SCAD diagnosis coronary angiogram , currently elusive . Our rigorous clinical laboratory screen elucidate prevalence predispose arteriopathies , help establish guideline investigation SCAD patient . Knowledge CV outcomes natural history NA-SCAD , especially stratified predispose arteriopathies , establish prognosis , risk stratification , management guideline . Knowledge Translation : Our result disseminate clinicians patient publication scientific journal , physician scientific presentation , Healthy Heart Programs , patient educational session , educational website , public medium . Results study help establish national international guideline diagnosis , investigation management NA-SCAD .</detailed_description>
