	<brief_summary>For duration 10 week , participant ask maintain current level physical activity take part three test session course 10 week . Objective subjective measurement obtain ( week 0 ) , midpoint ( week 5 ) intervention terminates ( week 10 ) . The objective measurement take inserting pressure sensor directly shoe record centre pressure . Markers attach surface body shoulder , foot belly button video recording use assess movement centre mass . The first task require individual stand one spot eye open , eye close . Secondly , stand one place , upon auditory cue , arm lift sky fast possible . Lastly , participant walk around set chair music play music stop , cue stop walking . The Timed-Up-and-Go test require participant rise seat position , walk 3 meter , turn return original seat position . The Berg Balance Scale require completion 14 task sequence evaluate balance ability seat , various stand position well transition movement . The measurement take collected via questionnaire balance confidence level . Upon arrival , participant require report whether experienced fall since last class attend yes , follow-up questionnaire also require gain information nature fall .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>The Effect Training Older Adults Tai Chi Compensatory Stepping Balance Control</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The main purpose research explore benefit 10 week Tai Chi compensatory step train program balance control among old adult examine static dynamic postural response perturbation ( 0 week ) , midpoint ( 5 week ) intervention ( 10 week ) . This Tai Chi compensatory step program compare control group participate physical activity 10 week , offer chance partake fall prevention program 10 week test complete . The program administer twice weekly thirty minute experience instructor community location ( Lab WLU ) . The Tai Chi/compensatory step group engage 50 minute Tai Chi exercise follow 10 minute control manual perturbation administer compensatory step training . The control group participate Tai Chi compensatory step train initial 10 week test , offer chance participate either SMART fall prevention program , give resource participation fall prevention exercise program . Testing group take place baseline ( week 0 ) , midpoint ( week 5 ) post-intervention ( week 10 ) . We assess balance control administer Berg Balance Scale ( attach ) , Timed-Up-and-Go Test tracking variability , minimum maximum displacement centre pressure ( COP ) , centre mass ( COM ) maximum minimum displacement COM COP indication instability . The Activities-Specific Balance Confidence Scale questionnaire ( attach ) also administer indication balance confidence . Tighter regulation COP COM well small displacement 2 value indicate great balance control . COP , COM COP/COM relationship measure three balance task . Participants pressure insoles directly insert shoe , marker attach tape record movement velocity change position . For test , participant require complete 3 task . The first make two part measure static balance . Participants stand one place eye open 3 trial 30 second ask repeat stand eye close . The second task measure static balance response self -perturbation , participant raise arm high velocity sky offset balance response unexpected auditory cue . The third task require participant walk circle around set chair perturb balance terminate gait upon unexpected auditory cue .</detailed_description>
