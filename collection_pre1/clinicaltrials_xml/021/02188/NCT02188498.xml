	<brief_summary>The objective study determine non-invasive technique , use innovative analysis electrocardiogram ( ECG ) data , would allow detection respiratory event sleep discrimination central obstructive apnea . Obstructive Sleep Apnea ( OSA ) common respiratory disturbance see sleep , estimate prevalence 10 % population strongly associate development cardiovascular disease . In patient underlie cardiac disease , particularly heart failure ( HF ) , central respiratory event Cheyne-Stokes Respiration ( CSR ) often see sleep . The presence CSR also associate increase cardiovascular morbidity mortality . Currently , identification classification sleep related respiratory disturbance perform over-night sleep study ( polysomnography ) , labor-intensive , time-consuming , expensive difficult patient . Thus , development alternative technique assist identification event outpatient set marked importance widespread screening sleep apnea .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>This study aim use novel analysis electrocardiogram data detect presence type respiratory event observe patient sleep . Our specific aim include : determine accuracy use non-invasive electrocardiogram ( ECG ) detect sleep apnea distinguish obstructive sleep apnea ( OSA ) Cheyne-Stokes Respiration ( CSR ) . For investigator-initiated study , data approximately 400 consecutive patient present Weill Cornell Center Sleep Medicine polysomnography collect . A sample size 45 subject group need quantify mean amplitude change ECG derive respiratory signal . Study procedure outline . Standard novel , research measurement ECG correlate finding polysomnography use assess presence severity variety ECG-based measure cardiovascular disease , leave ventricular hypertrophy prior Q-wave myocardial infarction . Subjects also complete Questionnaire prior ECG visit . Detailed procedure : 1 . Subjects ask complete brief questionnaire ( see attach ) . This questionnaire ask question relate subject ' sleep pattern , etc . Potential risk include possible discomfort complete questionnaire . 2 . Continuous 12-lead ECG recording , use torso-located electrode , obtain Mortara Instrument H12+ recorder . An MTA Agreement establish use equipment duration study . Electrocardiograms obtain standard clinical fashion use GE Medical Systems equipment . Patients ask lie supine position 10 record electrode apply . With patient lie quietly , 10 second digital ECG record downloaded via analog modem MUSE ECG analysis storage system New York Presbyterian Hospital store dedicate site password protect MUSE server . ECG information:12-lead ECGs download MUSE system secure network drive copy hard drive password protect computer batch-analyzed use ECG research analysis program , Magellan , provide GE Medical Systems . Magellan generate series measurement ECG export measurement Excel file convert SPSS file data analysis . Deidentified ECG data may download Electrocardiography data center transfer use secure file transfer system , Cornell 's file transfer website , outside company ( Mortara , Inc. ) analysis need . 3 . Standard polysomnography perform 12 hour approximately patient regular sleep time . Sleep data record digitized system analyze use Grass Twin software Â® ( Middleton , WI ) determination classification respiratory event sleep related parameter . The Apnea-Hypopnea Index ( AHI ) calculate compute average number obstructive apneas plus obstructive hypopnea per hour sleep . Obstructive sleep apnea ( OSA ) define AHI &amp; # 8805 ; 5 . Intermittent hypoxemia ( IH ) determine number period &amp; # 8805 ; 6 sec SaO2 drop &amp; # 8805 ; 4 % . Cheyne-Stokes Respiration determine typical crescendo-decrescendo pattern respiratory flow signal , chest thoracic impedance , use standard criterion . Total duration CSR calculate determination % sleep time CSR . Data regard percentage sleep time SaO2 &amp; # 8804 ; 90 % ( % TST &amp; lt ; 90 ) low saturation level ( LowSaO2 ) also record . Upon completion data attainment de-identified data remote analyze .</detailed_description>
