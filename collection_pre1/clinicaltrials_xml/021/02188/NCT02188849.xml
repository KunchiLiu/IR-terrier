	<brief_summary>To determine , double blind trial , effect creatine supplementation 12 week muscle mass function community live old woman subject resistance training . Material method : Fifty healthy old woman select study . All participant subject progressive resistance training program use elastic band weight , consist three session per week last 1 hour . Participant randomly allocate double blind fashion , receive creatine 5 g per day identical placebo . The training supplementation period last 12 week . At baseline end study , body composition measure dual energy x-ray absorptiometry , rectus femoris cross sectional height surface measure ultrasound , quadriceps strength measure quadriceps table 12 minute ' walk assess . The main outcome measure quadriceps cross sectional height . Expected result : We expect creatine supplementation increase rectus femoris height effect resistance training .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Healthy woman middle low socioeconomic level , live community age 60 75 year , invite participate study . At baseline signing informed consent form , follow assessment carry : 1 . A complete medical history include medication , previous disease surgical procedure . 2 . Evaluation usual physical activity use International Physical Activity Questionnaire ( IPAQ ) . 3 . Minimental state examination . 4 . Mininutritional assessment . 5 . Measurement weight , height , waist hip circumference . 6 . Measurement body composition double energy X ray absorptiometry General Electric iDEXA equipment . 7 . Measurement rectus femoris cross sectional height use General Electric LogiQ ultrasonographer . Measurements make participant supine position tight relaxed . The mid-point superior anterior iliac spine superior border patella measurement point . 8 . Measurement quadriceps isometric force use quadriceps table previously describe . 9 . Measurement hand grip strength use hand grip dynamometer . 10 . Measurement 12 minute walk capacity . After perform baseline assessment , participant randomize one two group , balance age nutritional status , use double blind design : 1 . The active group receive creatine 5 g/day one dose powder dissolve water 2 . The control group receive placebo similar aspect taste creatine . The active prescription placebo identify unique numeric code . The code know external professional , involve research . In case adverse event , open specific patient code request professional , decide pertinence request . Thus , even break one code , double blind maintain rest participant All participant incorporate exercise training program , last 12 week , three session per week . Each exercise session consist : 1 . A warm-up period 15 minute , consist walk cycling brake bicycle ergometer . 2 . Resistance train upper low limb , use elastic band tube free weight . Training calibrate 60 % one repetition maximum muscle group three set 15 repetition one minute rest set . All exercise additionally calibrate moderate intensity accord Borg scale . The exercise load adapt accord progression participant . 3 . An elongation period last 10 minute include elongation mat exercise ball . The attendance participant session , level engagement exercise protocol overall Borg score record . All adverse event also record follow good clinical practice guideline Every two week , new supply research prescription deliver . Participants request return unused sachet approximate assessment compliance . At end 12 week intervention , assessments do baseline repeat . All information participant record encrypted INTERNET database . Only researcher access information , participant inform result assessment . Main outcome measure calculation sample size : The main outcome rectus femoris cross sectional height . According previously publish result , parameter increase 20 ± 3.2 24.3 ± 3.8 mm training period 12 week . If expect 15 % difference rectus femoris cross sectional height end intervention period , would require 19 participant per group obtain difference α 0.05 power 0.8- Considering attrition rate 30 % training , would require 25 participant per group . Analysis result : An intention treat analysis perform . Also safety analysis also carry , consider participant take least one dose creatine placebo . According normality variable distribution , parametric non-parametric test use analyze difference .</detailed_description>
