	<detailed_description>Playworks school-based program place full-time coach low-income school organize game activity recess . The Robert Wood Johnson Foundation ( RWJF ) contract Mathematica Policy Research subcontractor , John W. Gardner Center Youth Their Communities ( JGC ) Stanford University , conduct rigorous evaluation Playworks . Twenty-nine school interested implement Playworks , across six city United States , randomly assign treatment control group 2010-2011 ( cohort 1 ) 2011-2012 ( cohort 2 ) school year . Random assignment conduct within match group school within city . In total , 12 block match school . For block , one school randomly assign control group rest treatment group . During one-year study period cohort , treatment school receive Playworks control school eligible implement Playworks . Data student survey , accelerometer , teacher survey collect 4th- 5th-grade student , teacher , school staff roughly seven month Playworks first implement treatment school . For student survey , student ask complete 30-minute student survey spring study year experience school . A team experience survey administration staff administer survey student ' classroom . In addition student survey , teacher ask complete teacher survey ask teacher student ' experience school . A subsample student ask complete student survey also wear accelerometer one two school day . During accelerometer data collection period , research team arrive participate classroom begin school day . Team member describe function accelerometer attach one consent student 's hip , use elastic belt . The accelerometer data process ActiLife 5 software package . The impact Playworks study outcomes estimate comparing average outcomes treatment control school use regression model customize unit analysis ( teacher student ) . The regression model use analysis include indicator random assignment block account blocked design school-specific random error term account school-specific effect attributable treatment . Covariates also include model account significant difference treatment control group demographic characteristic . Models continuous binary outcome variable fit use least-squares estimation logistic regression estimation , respectively . Standard error estimate impact teacher- student-level outcome account cluster school level use generalized estimating equation . Model-based p-values effect size calculate base estimate impact correspond standard error multiple comparison adjustment account correlation among multiple test . Sampling weight use estimate impact . The weight construct account selection probabilities student teacher sample nonresponse .</detailed_description>
