	<brief_summary>The goal study find high dose α-TEA give patient safely , identify potential side effect α-TEA , measure amount α-TEA patient ' blood . Additional goal study monitor effect tumor , check specific immune cell circulate blood , see certain feature tumor make possible predict response α-TEA .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>This dose-escalation study dose range 2.4 mg/kg 26.8 mg/kg α-TEA test . The main clinical objective phase I two-stage dose-escalation trial characterize α-TEA related toxicity , determine maximum tolerate dose , pharmacokinetics α-TEA human . Tumor response exploratory immunological monitoring also perform . Specifically , determine frequency circulate peripheral T cell subset population include CD4+ , CD8+ T cell activation status ( central memory , effector cell ) regulatory T cell ( CD4/CD25/Foxp3 ) . Exploratory monitoring assess tumor apoptosis serum cytokine level also perform gain additional insight influence α-TEA immune response tumor . An assessment immunoscore patient tumor amenable biopsy also provide hypothesis-generating data influence α-TEA tumor microenvironment .</detailed_description>
	<criteria>Patients measurable evaluable metastatic carcinoma , sarcoma lymphoma malignancy refractory progress therapy standard ( nonexperimental ) therapy exists decline available standard therapy , potential induce cure , remission enhance survival .
