	<brief_summary>The purpose study evaluate safety standard volume replacement call HES 130/0.4 ( Voluven ) surgery recovery . HES 130/0.4 ( Voluven ) may offer alternative pure fluid replacement solution associate problem surgery include fluid overload respiratory difficulty . The safety HES 130/0.4 ( Voluven ) evaluate examine effect kidney function , coagulation parameter platelet ( part blood help clot ) function . Participants randomize ( like flip coin ) receive one two possible volume replacement surgery , fluid volume decrease enough need replacement one fluid . The two possible volume replacement Voluven ( starch-containing fluid ) human albumin 5 % ( protein-containing solution ) . To examine kidney function , urine be-sampled participant put general anesthesia , surgical incision , within one hour arrival ICU 24 hour completion surgery . Two tube ( 2 teaspoon ) blood ( already establish line ) take morning surgery , within one hour arrival ICU , 24 hour surgery every morning participant postoperative ICU stay . Additionally , health recovery information record participant 's medical record . We phone participant around 90 day one year surgery ask question one 's health recovery . We also record blood sample analysis result follow appointment within first year surgery . If analysis conduct Cleveland Clinic , permission , obtain result treat physician .</brief_summary>
