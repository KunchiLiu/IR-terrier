	<brief_summary>Though utility NVM5 neuromonitoring stimulate within surgical site XLIF demonstrate , hypothesize information may gather great section motor neural pathway monitor ( i.e. , stimulation surgical site record subsequent muscle response lower limb ) . Currently , demonstrate practical method stimulate lumbosacral nerve root locally , well-above surgical site fashion . This protocol intend evaluate feasibility reproducibility use surface stimulation return ( anode ) electrodes stimulate lumbosacral nerve root , record response relevant innervated muscle group low limb .</brief_summary>
