	<brief_summary>The study hypothesis situ MNA-directed chemo-immunotherapy use doxorubicin kill tumor cell locally alter tumor microenvironment induce durable systemic tumor-specific immunity . The purpose study test new method experimental treatment CTCL , use small adhesive-like patch ( micro-needle applicator MNA short ) , dozens small micro-needles load extremely low dos doxorubicin , chemotherapy agent . The overall goal study test safety effectiveness patch . We also want determine micro-dose drug best achieve best response . To make sure observe effect low dose drug MNA patch , also use placebo ( patch without drug patient ) addition doxorubicin coat patch . We thoroughly evaluate skin patch apply . Once best dose determine use patch , also begin look well patch work clear skin .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>This study evaluate novel approach treatment patch plaque skin patient diagnose cutaneous t-cell lymphoma utilize dissolvable microneedle array ( MNA ) delivery device use directly specifically deliver drug tumor microenvironment skin cancer therapy . We utilize MNAs deliver well-characterized , potent chemotherapeutic agent ( doxorubicin ) kill topically accessible , cutaneous T-cell lymphoma cell . In addition directly kill cancer cell , doxorubicin know induce immunologic cell death potential simultaneously convert cutaneous neoplasm highly potent patient specific immunogen capable induce innate , adaptive , tumor specific effector memory immune response . Importantly , doxorubicin currently clinical use well-established safety profile . It anticipate use MNA-Doxorubicin ( MNA-D ) delivery system enable direct specific delivery chemotherapy tumor , thereby avoid potential systemic toxicity . The study conduct two phase , first safety dose-finding phase second phase efficacy safety evaluation .</detailed_description>
