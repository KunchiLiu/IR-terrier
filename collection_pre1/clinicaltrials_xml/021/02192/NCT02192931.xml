	<brief_summary>Methamphetamine ( MA ) addiction public health concern cause substantial harm individual user , imposes economic burden U.S. total $ 48.3 billion annually . This study propose address critical aspect problem : lack proven , FDA-approved pharmacological treatment MA user . The proposal combine intervention design improve energy metabolism brain , neuroimaging technique capable measuring neurochemical represent cerebral bioenergetic function . The study replicate extend key neuroimaging find investigator recent MA study : MA user decrease phosphocreatine ( PCr ) level brain , compare healthy volunteer . Phosphocreatine substrate reservoir creatine kinase reaction , reversibly convert PCr adenosine triphosphate ( ATP ) , brain 's major energy supply , creatine . Neuronal energy demand meet shift reaction equilibrium , design maintain concentration ATP constant . Research result investigator recent study also show female MA user low brain PCr level compare male user . These finding join converge line evidence MA use associate mitochondrial dysfunction , i.e . deficient energy metabolism , brain . Frequently , MA user also experience depression , well cognitive deficit . Interestingly , entity also link mitochondrial dysfunction brain . The long-term goal research program define alteration brain chemistry underlie MA use disorder , utilize translational magnetic resonance spectroscopy ( MRS ) neuroimaging identify rational brain-based treatment target . Once hypothesis-driven intervention identify , MRS employ treatment study , verify `` target engagement '' achieve . The specific aim proposal example stepwise scientific process : nutritional supplement creatine test randomize , placebo-controlled study woman MA use disorder , investigate creatine 's effect cerebral PCr level , depressive symptom , MA usage .</brief_summary>
