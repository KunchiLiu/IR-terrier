	<detailed_description>The investigator propose develop test feasibility Habit , weight loss mobile app include common feature self-monitoring , goal setting , social network , even importantly , avatar-facilitated , idiographic problem solve feature process information intelligently help patient identify solution weight loss problem . In pilot randomize trial 50 obese participant , test feasibility Habit mobile application pair shorten ( 8 week ) behavioral weight loss intervention relative shorten behavioral weight intervention . Feasibility outcomes include frequency duration usage mobile app feature , recruitment , retention . The investigator also exploratory analysis compare condition problem solve skill weight loss 8 week , inform subsequent randomize control efficacy trial . Data support efficacy trial Habit-assisted brief behavioral weight loss intervention relative brief behavioral weight loss intervention alone 1 year follow-up . The investigator overarch goal develop mobile technology reduces intensity lifestyle intervention far possible preserve weight loss outcome , ultimately broaden reach .</detailed_description>
