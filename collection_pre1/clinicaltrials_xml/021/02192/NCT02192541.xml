	<brief_summary>Background : - Some people cancer respond standard treatment . In case , doctor may try use drug slow growth cancer . Objectives : - To test safety efficacy drug combination ganetespib ziv-aflibercept . Eligibility : - Adults age 18 advance cancer colon , lung , urinary tract , sarcoma . Design : - Participants screen medical history , blood test , scan measure tumor . - Participants one two eye exam , dilate eye drop . - Participants get study drug clinic infusion vein . Ganetespib give week day 3 week row , follow 1-week rest period . Ziv-aflibercept give every week . The drug give 28-day cycle . - Participants may small piece tumor collect twice . This do use small needle compute tomography ( CT ) , magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) , ultrasound scan . - Participants blood pressure check visit . They check home every day study . - Participants may one whole-body PET scan 89Zr-panitumumab . A small amount radioactive chemical inject tube arm . Participants lie bed slide donut-shaped PET scanner . They small amount blood drawn . - Participants may stay study long tolerate drug tumor get bad .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>BACKGROUND : - Ganetespib non-geldamycin synthetic inhibitor Hsp90 demonstrate activity multiple cancer cell line tumor xenografts preclinical model . Inhibiting Hsp90 chaperone complex result recruitment ubiquitin ligases , polyubiquination , proteosomal degradation Hsp90 client protein , include transcription factor proteins involve angiogenesis ( VEGF , VEGFR , HIF-1 , STAT-3 ) ; growth factor independence ( RAF , EGFR , Her2 , IGFR ) ; resistance anti-growth signal ( CDK4 ) ; tissue invasion metastasis ( MET , MMP2 ) ; avoidance apoptosis ( AKT , RIP , Survivin , Bcl-2 ) . - HIF-1 activation implicate mediate resistance anti-angiogenic therapy ; recent evidence implicates great role Hsp90 direct modulation VEGF signaling . - Combining Hsp90 inhibition ganetespib anti-angiogenic therapy Ziv-Aflibercept , soluble fusion protein high bind affinity VEGF-A , VEGF-B , PIGF , present rational novel strategy improve upon overcome resistance anti-angiogenic therapy PRIMARY OBJECTIVE : - To establish safety , tolerability , maximum tolerate dose ( MTD ) combination ganetespib Ziv-Aflibercept patient refractory gastrointestinal carcinoma , non-squamous non-small cell lung carcinoma , urothelial carcinoma , sarcomas SECONDARY OBJECTIVE : - To assess modulation HIF1 pharmacodynamic marker therapy combination ganetespib Ziv-Aflibercept - To assess modulation EGFR expression use 89Zr-labeled , EGFR-targeting antibody panitumumab PET/CT image tumor lesion prior follow treatment study drug ELIGIBILITY : - Adult patient histologically confirm metastatic gastrointestinal carcinoma , non-squamous non-small cell lung carcinoma , urothelial carcinoma , sarcomas disease progression least one line standard therapy - Participants expansion phase must demonstrate EGFR expression archival tumor sample disease amenable biopsy willingness undergo pre- post-treatment biopsy - No major surgery within 4 week prior study enrollment , radiation chemotherapy within 3 week prior enrollment ; patient must recover toxicity prior therapy least eligibility level prior enrollment . STUDY DESIGN : - Ganetespib administer intravenously weekly day 1 , 8 , 15 28-day cycle . Ziv-Aflibercept administer intravenously every 2 week , day 1 15 , 28-day cycle . - The escalation portion trial follow standard 3+3 design , whereby patient dose-escalated cohort 3 dose-limiting toxicity observe . - Once MTD establish , 10 additional patient enrolled expansion phase , MTD , tumor biopsy obtain assess pharmacodynamic endpoint . During cycle 1 expansion phase , ganetespib administer intravenously weekly , day 8 15 omission day 1 treatment accommodate baseline biopsy pre-ganetespib administration Ziv-Aflibercept . For subsequent cycle , ganetespib administer day 1 , 8 , 15 . Ziv-Aflibercept still administer intravenously every 2 week , day 1 15 , 28-day cycle . - PET/CT image 89Zr-labeled panitumumab perform evaluate tumor distribution prior follow treatment study agent .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>INCLUSION CRITERIA : Patients must histologically confirm recurrent metastatic gastrointestinal carcinoma , nonsquamous nonsmall cell lung carcinoma , urothelial carcinoma , sarcomas disease progression least one line standard therapy . Disease progress follow treatment know prolong survival , unless give treatment contraindicate . Patients colorectal carcinoma must progress least two line standard chemotherapy metastatic setting . Patients nonsmall cell lung cancer know sensitize EGFR mutation and/or ALK rearrangement receive prior erlotinib and/or crizotinib , respectively . Patients urothelial carcinoma progress prior platinumbased therapy platinumbased therapy contraindicate . Patients enrolled expansion phase protocol must demonstrate EGFR expression immunohistochemistry archival tumor sample prior undergo ( 89 ) Zrpanitumumab PET/CT scan . Age great equal 18 year age . ECOG performance status &lt; 2 . Life expectancy &gt; 3 month . Patients must normal organ marrow function define : absolute neutrophil count great equal 1,500/mcL platelet great equal 100,000/mcL total bilirubin less equal 1.5 time institutional upper limit normal AST ( SGOT ) /ALT ( SGPT ) less equal 3 time institutional upper limit normal creatinine less equal 1.2 time institutional upper limit normal OR creatinine clearance great equal 60 mL/min/1.73 m2 patient creatinine level institutional normal urine protein/creatinine &lt; 1 mg/mg INR &lt; 1.5 Cardiac function within institutional normal limit echocardiogram . Patients must blood pressure great 140 mmHg ( systolic blood pressure ) 90 mmHg ( diastolic blood pressure ) eligibility . Initiation adjustment antihypertensive medication permit prior study entry provide average three blood pressure measurement enrollment visit le 140/90 mmHg . The effect ganetespib develop human fetus unknown .
