	<brief_summary>Chemotherapy induce muscle loss colorectal , breast advance renal cell carcinoma patient . The Danish nation-wide training rehabilitation offer 'Body &amp; Cancer ' offer intensive resistance endurance train Danish cancer patient receive chemotherapy aim reduce treatment-related fatigue physical impairment , potential training preserve improve muscle mass uninvestigated . Furthermore , underlie biological mechanism treatment and/or exercise induce change muscle mass cancer patient remain uninvestigated . Thus , primary purpose present study investigate change body composition chemotherapy resistance aerobic training combine protein supplementation ongoing chemotherapy cancer patient . Secondly , aim investigate underlie biological mechanism muscle mass regulation biopsy obtain control period well 10 week exercise , chemotherapy . We hypothesize 10 week exercise improve muscle mass body composition cancer patient chemotherapy compare control period chemotherapy alone .</brief_summary>
