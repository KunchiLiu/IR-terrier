	<brief_title>HR Versus RFA HCC Patients With PHT</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Cirrhosis common among patient hepatocellular carcinoma ( HCC ) ; China , example , occur approximately 80 % HCC patient . Another common comorbidity HCC clinically significant portal hypertension ( PHT ) , occur 25-55 % patient HCC cirrhosis . PHT correlate severity cirrhosis , complicate HCC treatment increase risk perioperative hemorrhage liver failure . Hepatic resection ( HR ) widely use radical therapy HCC . Although HR often suitable HCC patient cirrhosis , widely regard unsuitable HCC patient PHT potential postoperative hepatic decompensation . In fact , absence PHT best predictor excellent HR outcome . Guidelines American European Associations Study Liver Disease recommend HR option HCC patient PHT . Several study , however , report HCC patient without clinically significant PHT show similar short- long-term outcome HR . This controversy important resolve 25 % cirrhotic patient HCC also present PHT . Actually , official guideline recommend liver transplatation patient HCC PHT . However , implementation liver transplantation restrict lack liver donation high cost procedure many country , especially China . However , minimally invasive therapy , radiofrequency ablation ( RFA ) popular treatment modality patient HCC within Milan Criteria . Moreover , randomize control trial validate proposed clinical usage . So , plan address safety efficacy HR compare RFA HCC patient PHT use population Guangxi province China , population show high HCC incidence world .</detailed_description>

If diagnosis base image andαfetoprotein level uncertain , needle biopsy perform . Tumor stage fit Milan Criteria Patients clinically relevant portal hypertension , define presence esophageal varix and/or platelet count less 100 000 per μL association splenomegaly .
