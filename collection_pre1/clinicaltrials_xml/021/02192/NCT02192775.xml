	<brief_title>UARK 2014-21 A Phase II Trial Oncolytic Virotherapy Systemic Administration Edmonston Strain Measles Virus</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The drug use trial modify version measles virus use vaccinate child . The virus alter extra gene ( piece DNA ) add allow protein call NIS insert . NIS normally find thyroid gland ( small gland neck ) help body concentrate iodine . Having additional gene make possible track virus go body .</detailed_description>

Patients must relapse autoPBSCT follow chemotherapy ≥2 month must elapse last peripheral blood stem cell transplant prior enrollment Zubrod ≤ 2 , unless solely due symptom MMrelated ( bone ) disease Patients must platelet count ≥ 20,000/µL within 45 day registration , unless low level explain extensive BM plasmacytosis extensive prior therapy Patients must least 18 year age old 75 year age time registration Participants must preserve renal function define serum creatinine level ≤ 3 mg/dL within 45 day registration Participants must ejection fraction ECHO MUGA scan ≥ 40 % within 45 day prior registration Patients must adequate pulmonary function study &gt; 50 % predict mechanical aspect ( FEV1 , etc ) diffusion capacity ( DLCO ) &gt; 50 % predict within 45 day prior registration . If patient unable complete pulmonary function test due MM relate pain condition , exception may grant Patients must sign IRBapproved informed consent Health Insurance Portability Accountability Act ( HIPAA ) authorization form Patients must antiMV IgG titer ≤ 0.5U/mL ( Mayo clinic assay ) . Mayo Clinic also assay patient ' IgM titer perform neutralize antibody plaqueassay determine recent MV exposure ability patient ' circulate antibody inhibit MV propagation Vero cell , respectively . While test additional indicator patient eligibility , final enrollment decision determine IgG level Patients may positive Human Immunodeficiency Virus ( HIV ) History poorly control hypertension , diabetes mellitus , serious medical illness psychiatric illness could potentially interfere completion treatment accord protocol could consider exclusion criterion deem PI Patients must prior malignancy , except adequately treat basal cell squamous cell skin cancer , situ cervical cancer , cancer patient receive treatment one year prior enrollment .
