	<brief_title>REWIRE - Rehabilitative Wayout In Responsive Home Environments , A Pilot Trial</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The REWIRE rehabilitation platform consist three hierarchical component : `` Patient Station '' ( PS ) , instal home environment patient ; `` Hospital Station '' ( HS ) , allow exchange information horsepower serve therapist hospital ; `` Networking Station '' ( NS ) , allow combination plurality HS . The PS consist standard laptop specifically create rehabilitation REWIRE platform pre-installed software ( Università degli Studi di Milano , Italy , Applied Intelligent Systems Laboratory Department Computer Science ) . In context training system connect computer , software enables collection data , record part training . In study exercise balance ability part train program . The training system consist so-called Tymoplate® ( Tyromotion , Austria ) , medical device class 1 CE certification approval FDA use neurorehabilitation stroke . The Tymoplate® connect computer allows mean base plate integrate pressure sensor custom-developed training software , various postural biofeedback exercise . In combination 3D camera ( Kinect® , PrimeSense , CA , USA ) , patient see him-/herself avatar real time screen move virtual training environment . By various , attractive entertaining design training game well provide audio-visual feedback balance score system , patient maximum motivated exercise . The HS enable interaction patient therapist essentially consist MySQL database web-based interface . The data collect PS retrieve HS use therapist order set train program PS control adjust difficulty level exercise individual performance patient . The NS also consist database . It link collect training data associate epidemiological data different HS regional level ( potentially also different health institution ) identify application statistical algorithm general model description relaxation process rehabilitation medicine . In simple way frequent intensive training without direct therapeutic help home set low cost possible . By attractive entertaining design training game well interaction feedback therapist , patient motivate train day system continually improve game . The supervision train therapist rehabilitation platform REWIRE additionally serve recognize improvement individual performance problem adapt difficulty level exercise . For Patient Registries - Patient recruitment Suitable station patient Cereneo Vitznau inform possibility participation study . If interested , patient receive patient information decide within week whether participate study . - Data collection We collect data daily usage patient well hospital station . Patient usage regress patient 's deficit severity , age gender gather preliminary knowledge whether certain subgroup patient accept system good others . System usability During pilot trial involve physician physical therapist answer standardise questionnaire system usability . Specifically look number instruction therapy modification give patient whether therapist give instruction think patient react accordingly . REWIRE also evaluate , term usability software instrument , degree control rehabilitation process value result report REWIRE . - Data management The investigator use paper case report form ( CRF ) , one enrol study participant , fill relevant data pertain subject study . The investigator document participation study subject enrolment log . All request information CRF complete neat legible manner . Use black ball pen recommend ensure clarity reproduce copy CRF . All correction paper CRF must make way obscure original entry . The correct data must insert , date initialled investigator Data available do make clear add NA ND . A declaration ensure accuracy data record case report form must sign investigator . CRFs keep current reflect subject status phase course study . Subjects identify CRF name . Appropriate cod identification ( e.g . subject number ) use . It assure authorised person , may perform data entry change CRF , identify . A list signatures initial authorise person file study site file trial master file , respectively . Documented medical history narrative statement relative subject 's progress study maintain . These record also include follow : original copy laboratory medical test result must keep file individual subject 's CRF . The CIP specify maintain subject . The investigator assure perform complete accurate documentation subject data CRF . All data enter CRF exception ( data CRF source data specify study ) must also available individual subject file either print-outs note take either investigator another responsible person assign investigator . Data include CRF store secured access database . Essential document must retain least 10 year regular end premature termination respective study ( VKlin Art . 25 ) . Essential document retain accord local law case international multicentre study . Any patient file source data must archive long possible period time accord feasibility investigational site , institution private practice . - Reporting adverse event Adverse event report Ethics Committee northwest/ central Switzerland EKNZ . - Change management Sample size assessment specify number participant participant year necessary demonstrate effect Number patient : 15 stroke patient . Due likely large heterogeneity study population ( different weight severity paresis ataxia , well partly cognitive deficit ) sufficiently large number patient must test . Currently , data would allow power analysis respect primary secondary end point . In case premature withdrawl study , participant replace least 16 participant carry 3-month training program completely . Plan miss data address situation variable report miss , unavailable , `` non-reported , '' uninterpretable , consider miss data inconsistency out-of-range result If individual clinical test data miss , concern test analyse consider . Statistical analysis plan describe analytical principle statistical technique employ order address primary secondary objective , specify study protocol plan Primarily , feasibility technical practical implementation rehabilitation REWIRE platform evaluate home-environment study participant . Furthermore , satisfaction patient compliance acceptance system attend physician therapist measure . Therefore , structured-standardized questionnaire use quality ( numerically tangible ) evaluate mean Likert scale . Secondary , effect use train system functional recovery quality life well structural plasticity brain evaluate . In term functional recovery quality life correlation analyse perform . Related data stroke patient ( stroke registry ZORRO , KEK-ZH-E-08/2009 ) compare REWIRE-study . The evaluation data measure mean magnetic resonance imaging , require carry correlation analysis application parametric statistical method .</detailed_description>
