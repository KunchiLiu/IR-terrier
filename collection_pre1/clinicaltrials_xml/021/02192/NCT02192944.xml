	<brief_summary>Chloroquine piperaquine two widely use antimalarial drug ever . Hundreds million people receive drug . Both structurally similar cardiovascular effect . While concern use chloroquine , regulatory authority suggest restriction use piperaquine . We recently complete series cross-over clinical pharmacokinetic evaluation chloroquine , piperaquine , pyronaridine primaquine healthy subject . These study approve ethical committee FTM . All drug well tolerate clinically significant ECG change . Four subject two study . This offer unique opportunity compare electrocardiographic effect chloroquine piperaquine subject therefore characterize concentration-effect relationship , thus relative safety . We propose extend previous subject study recruit 16 subject include receive either piperaquine chloroquine previous study 20 subject receive drug crossover comparison . The blood sample schedule electrocardiogram would exactly previously would finish 24 hour .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The investigator team recently complete two cross-over clinical pharmacokinetic evaluation chloroquine piperaquine healthy subject i.e . Study A Study B . Study A : Phase 1 , Open-Label Study Evaluate Potential Pharmacokinetic Interaction Orally Administered Primaquine Chloroquine Healthy Thai Adult Subjects Study B : Open-Label Study Evaluate Potential Pharmacokinetic Interaction Orally Administered Primaquine Dihydroartemisinin-Piperaquine Healthy Adult Subjects Four subject study . The investigator propose extend previous subject study recruit 16 subject include limited receive either chloroquine study A piperaquine form study B previous study 20 subject receive drug crossover comparison . Subjects previously enrol study A receive single dose 600 mg chloroquine base receive single dose piperaquine phosphate ( form 120/960 mg dihydroartemisinin-piperaquine ) study . The subject previously enrol study B receive single dose piperaquine phosphate ( form 120/960 mg dihydroartemisinin-piperaquine ) receive single dose 600 mg chloroquine base study . The investigator team may recruit naive subject case , team ca n't reach total number 20 subject . The total duration subject 's participation study approximately 3 week subject challenge one study drug 11 week subject challenge drug .</detailed_description>
