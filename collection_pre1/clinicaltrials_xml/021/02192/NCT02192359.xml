	<brief_summary>This phase I trial study side effect best dose carboxylesterase-expressing allogeneic neural stem cell give together irinotecan hydrochloride treat patient high-grade gliomas come back . Placing genetically modify neural stem cell brain tumor cell may make tumor sensitive irinotecan hydrochloride . Irinotecan hydrochloride may stop growth tumor cell block enzymes need cell growth . Giving carboxylesterase-expressing allogeneic neural stem cell irinotecan hydrochloride may better treatment high-grade glioma .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To define recommended phase II dose ( RP2D ) intracranially administer hCE1m6-NSCs ( carboxylesterase-expressing allogeneic neural stem cell ) combination intravenous irinotecan patient recurrent high grade glioma . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . To describe relationship hCE1m6-NSC dose SN-38 ( liposomal SN-38 ) concentration brain interstitium . II . To characterize relationship intracerebral systemic concentration irinotecan ( irinotecan hydrochloride ) SN-38 . III . To investigate biologic activity hCE1m6 NSCs compare SN-38 concentration brain treatment hCE1m6-NSCs irinotecan versus irinotecan alone . IV . To assess possible development adenovirally transduce neural stem cell ( NSC ) immunogenicity first exposure repeat dos NSCs . V. To describe clinical benefit ( define stable disease , partial response , complete response ) patient receive treatment repeat cycle NSCs irinotecan . VI . To determine , time autopsy , fate NSCs . OUTLINE : This dose-escalation study carboxylesterase-expressing allogeneic neural stem cell . Patients receive carboxylesterase-expressing allogeneic neural stem cell intracranially 1.5-4.5 hour day 1 15 ( day 1 patient dose level 1 ) irinotecan hydrochloride intravenously ( IV ) 90 minute day 3 17 . Courses repeat every 28 day absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . After completion study treatment , patient follow 3 6 month annually thereafter 15 year .</detailed_description>
