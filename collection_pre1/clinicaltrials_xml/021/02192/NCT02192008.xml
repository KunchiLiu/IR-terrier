	<brief_summary>Enteric fever , infection characterise diarrhoea rash , often cause bacteria call Salmonella enterica . After ingest contaminate food drink , Salmonellae travel first gut , bloodstream , infect part body . Antibiotics use kill bacteria , increase rate antibiotic resistance , treatment become less effective . Two Salmonella variant , Typhi Paratyphi , cause 30 million case enteric fever 200,000 death per year , mostly develop country . While improved hygiene sanitation eventually eliminate enteric fever , reduction disease burden medium term achievable effective vaccination . Vaccines likely available mass vaccination effective Salmonella strain bear Vi polysaccharide capsule protein . Strains capsule protein , capsule , affected vaccination could 'fill ' space vacate capsulated strain . Indeed , enteric fever cause S. Paratyphi A carry Vi protein , rise past decade account half case area . Thus important effective vaccine available protect infection capsulate noncapsulated Salmonella enterica . To develop vaccine , need complete understanding human immune response type , include contribution immunity gut bloodstream , immune response bacterial surface protein , role antibody . How much cross-protection type typhoidal Salmonellae natural infection vaccination know , critical vaccine development . This project aim fill knowledge gap highlight , fully characterise infection process immune response enteric fever .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Investigating Enteric Fever - Salmonella Typhi Paratyphi Challenge Study</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>There two main group study . Firstly group 40 60 volunteer recruit community previously expose typhoidal Salmonella ( part A ) ; secondly group 20 60 volunteer participant previous challenge study conduct Oxford Vaccine Group ( part B ) . Participants part A B randomly allocate one-to-one either S. Typhi S. Paratyphi . The dose bacteria determine previous challenge study give attack rate 60 75 % individual naive typhoidal Salmonella . The bacteria ingest drink bicarbonate buffer ( 'the challenge ' ) . In addition two group , preliminary study involve 3 10 participant act 'negative control ' perform . They ingest bicarbonate drink give S. Typhi S. Paratyphi . This group randomise part A B , unblinded i.e . participant aware drink typhoidal Salmonella . The participant procedure investigation part A B , include endoscopy biopsy , daily visit two week intensive phase , course antibiotic . Prior challenge , participant ( part A , B negative control group ) undergo endoscopy tissue biopsy gut line . This procedure repeat intensive phase completion two week course antibiotic . After challenge , participant review daily least 14 day study investigator . Samples blood , stool , saliva urine collect . Participants diagnose enteric fever treat immediately antibiotic sample take per protocol . The participant meet criterion enteric fever treated antibiotic Day 14 . Enteric fever diagnose follow apply : 1 . A positive blood culture S. Typhi Paratyphi 72 hour post-challenge , 2. positive blood culture S. Typhi Paratyphi within 72 hour post-challenge , one signs/symptoms enteric fever , 3. persistent positive blood culture ( two blood culture take least 4 hour apart ) S. Typhi Paratyphi within 72 hour postchallenge , 4. oral temperature ≥ 38°C persist 12 hour . A proportion participant Part A B offer optional procedure enteric string test ( also call Enterotest ) and/or Wireless Video Capsule Endoscopies ( WCE ) . Participants consent procedure select sequentially quota fill group .</detailed_description>

Female participant unwilling ensure partner use effective contraception one month prior challenge continue two negative stool sample , minimum three week completion antibiotic treatment , obtain . Fulltime , parttime voluntary occupation involve clinical social work direct contact young child ( define attend preschool group nursery age 2 year ) ; clinical social work direct contact highly susceptible patient person typhoid paratyphoid infection would particularly serious consequence e.g . elderly infirm . Full time , part time voluntary occupation involve commercial food handle . Close household contact young child ( define attend preschool group , nursery age less 2 year ) , individual ( ) ( ) immunocompromised , schedule elective surgery procedure require general anaesthesia study period . Participants participate another research study involve investigational product might affect risk typhoid paratyphoid infection compromise integrity study within 30 day prior enrolment . Detection significantly abnormal result screen investigation . Inability comply study requirement . Any social , psychological health issue , opinion study investigator , may put participant contact risk participation study , adversely affect interpretation primary endpoint data , impair participant 's ability participate study . Having resident enteric fever endemic country six month .</criteria>
