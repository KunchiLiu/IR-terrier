	<brief_summary>The purpose study determine whether pre-operative prostate artery embolization ( PAE ) reduce intra-operative blood loss improve surgical outcome among prostate cancer patient undergo robot-assisted laparoscopic radical prostatectomy ( RALRP ) .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Phase II Investigation Prostate Artery Embolization ( PAE ) Before Radical Prostatectomy Prostate Cancer Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Duration study : This study enroll 20 patient , target enrollment period 18 month . Patients undergo prostate artery embolization ( PAE ) follow-up visit 2 week 6 week PAE . All patient study post RALRP follow-up visit 2 week , 3 month , 6 month , 9 month , 12 month surgery . All patient continue follow accord usual standard care follow completion study . Study design : The first 10 patient meet study eligibility criterion provide consent participation study receive PAE prior RALRP . Control patient match 1:1 PAE patient , accord risk score , receive RALRP without PAE . Control patient select PAE patient enrol , need meet study eligibility criterion . The following assessment evaluation require participation study : Physical exam , blood &amp; urine test , magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) , digital rectal exam ( DREs ) , transrectal ultrasound ( TRUS ) , Expanded Prostate Cancer Index Composite ( EPIC ) questionnaires , International Index Erectile Function ( IIEF ) questionnaires , robot-assisted laparoscopic radical prostatectomy ( RALRP ) , pad weight test . All patient enrol PAE arm study undergo embolization blood vessel fee prostate .</detailed_description>
