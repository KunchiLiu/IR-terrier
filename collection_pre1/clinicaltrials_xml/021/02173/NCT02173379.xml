	<detailed_description>ABSORB IV : A . Primary Objective : - To evaluate 1-year clinical outcome Absorb BVS compare XIENCE treatment subject ischemic heart disease cause three de novo native coronary artery lesion maximum two epicardial vessel , maximum two lesion per epicardial vessel . - To evaluate long-term clinical outcome Absorb BVS compare XIENCE treatment subject ischemic heart disease cause three denovo native coronary artery lesion maximum two epicardial vessel , maximum two lesion per epicardial vessel . B . Secondary Objectives : - To evaluate incidence angina occur within 1 year , treatment Absorb BVS compare XIENCE . The enrollment 3000 subject ABSORB IV start enrollment completion 2000 primary analysis subject ABSORB III . All registered subject clinical follow-up 30 , 90 , 180 , 270 day 1 , 2 , 3 , 4 , 5 year , potentially 6 and/or 7 year necessary determine Sponsor . In addition , 3000 subject ABSORB IV complete patient-reported outcome ( PRO ) self-administered questionnaire baseline , 30 days,180 day , annually throughout remain duration trial . The ABSORB IV trial also include image ischemia sub-study provide physiological mechanistic evaluation whether percutaneous coronary intervention ( PCI ) treatment Absorb compare XIENCE result differences myocardial ischemia early post-procedural period , 14 month 62 month .</detailed_description>
