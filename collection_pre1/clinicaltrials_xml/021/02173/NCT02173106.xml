	<brief_title>A Controlled Study Steroids Plus Cyclosporin Therapy Patients Idiopathic Membranous Nephropathy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Idiopathic membranous nephropathy main reason nephropathy . Since get spontaneous remission , KDIGO , recommend initial therapy start patient nephrotic syndrome least follow condition meet : urinary protein excretion persistently exceed 4g/d remain 50 % baseline value , show progressive antiproteinuric therapy observation period least 6 month . But many retrospective research report use steroid immunosuppressive agent well wait spontaneous remission . There prospective , randomize , control research whether good begin use steroid immunosuppressive agent early without wait 6 month . In study , evaluate validity security steroid plus cyclosporin therapy idiopathic membranous nephropathy . This prospective , randomize , control , multicenter study . Patients treatment group receive oral methylprednisolone 0.4mg/kg/d 3.5~5mg/kg/d cyclosporin 6 month . Patients control group wait spontaneous remission 6 month , spontaneous remission , patient control group receive oral methylprednisolone 0.4mg/kg/d 3.5~5mg/kg/d cyclosporin 6 month . After followed-up 6 month curative side effect steroid plus cyclosporin therapy early stage idiopathic membranous nephropathy evaluate .</detailed_description>
