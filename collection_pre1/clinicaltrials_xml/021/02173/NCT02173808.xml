	<brief_title>A Phase I Study Evaluate PK PD Single Injection Levonorgestrel Butanoate Female Contraception</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This Phase I single center , open-label , single dose pharmacokinetic pharmacodynamic study injectable formulation levonorgestrel butanoate ( LB ) jointly develop National Institute Child Health Human Development ( NICHD ) CONRAD , manufacture Coldstream Laboratories , Inc . Healthy normal weight obese woman follow outpatient eight month . During study , subject undergo screen cycle confirm normal ovulatory function , receive active treatment single injection LB . They undergo frequent evaluation obtain serum sample evaluate drug level ovulatory function , well transvaginal ultrasound cervical mucus evaluation select visit . Follow continue normal ovulatory cycle resume . Based upon detailed study non-human primate , expect subject resume menstrual cyclicity within 12- 26 week follow injection . Subjects continue follow one normal cycle return menses . This study conduct NICHD one Contraceptive Clinical Trials Network ( CCTN ) sit ( Oregon Health &amp; Science University , ( OHSU ) ) USA enroll approximately 16 woman . This study enroll approximately 16 subject demonstrate favorable cervical mucus normal ovulatory function baseline cycle . Enrollment stratify ensure 50 % subject BMI &gt; 32 kg/m2 &lt; 40 kg/m2 approximately 50 % subject BMI &lt; 32 kg/m2 .</detailed_description>
