	<brief_summary>Neovascular wet age-related macular degeneration ( ARMD ) retinal disease lead cause sight loss 50 ; constitutes major public health problem increasingly large impact population age , sight loss associate loss independence , depression , social isolation , fall . Recent advance medicine , particular approval behalf National Institute Health Clinical Excellence ( NICE ) use ranibizumab ( Lucentis ) wet ARMD , allow condition treat ; however success likely treatment occur early stage . Unfortunately early stage wet ARMD cause symptom case diagnose irreversible retinal damage already occur . In stage ARMD , even symptoms present non-invasive technique currently use routine clinical practice sufficiently sensitive identify abnormality , retinal function possibly anatomy abnormal . This study evaluate technique may useful flag subject `` preclinical '' stage disease . This may allow early preventative measure take , order stop altogether onset blindness . The study focus mainly colour contrast sensitivity , simple highly sensitive technique assess retinal function , establish people wet ARMD identify symptom develop . Other assessment modality , evaluate either structure function retina , also employ select individual establish may use routine clinic ; however already know modality suitable individual , demand time-wise concentration-wise , therefore universally suitable .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Neovascular age‐related macular degeneration ( nARMD ) , definition affect 50 , account 50 % visual impairment certification United Kingdom1 recent study2 estimate prevalence UK 1.2 % individual age 50 , 2.5 % 65 , 6.3 % age 80 . Neovascular ARMD therefore likely become much significant issue population age , unless step take find way limit loss vision : study2 suggest currently 263,000 case nARMD UK , number set increase almost third year 2020 . Importantly , individual poor vision also high frequency fall depression compare aged‐matched people normal vision , likely live alone additional health problems3 , 4 . Therefore nARMD significantly impact quality life , much great extent appreciate many health professional : key study5 report even mild sight impairment result 17 % decrease quality life , whereas moderate severe sight impairment result 40 % 63 % decrease quality life respectively . It note 63 % decrease quality life comparable encounter advanced prostatic cancer uncontrollable pain severe stroke leave person bedridden , incontinent require constant nursing care5 . The advent anti‐VEGF therapy nARMD approval ranibizumab ( Lucentis ) UK National Institute Clinical Excellence ( NICE ) dramatically improve prognosis patient nARMD : vision frequently maintain even improve , particularly early detection treatment occur6‐9 . However currently difficult detect monitor nARMD early stage individual typically present ophthalmologist certain degree irreversible damage occur . The hallmark nARMD choroidal neovascular membrane ( CNV ) 1 , 10 , 11 , although change occur locally CNV develop , follow : 1 . Inflammatory mediator release affected area change metabolism develop12‐15 . 2 . The retina affect insult gradually lose function10‐12 , 14‐18 . It yet establish point CNV development surround retina detectable functional structural abnormality , however wealth literature10‐12 , 14‐19 suggests start patient still asymptomatic currently available non‐invasive imaging technique able detect abnormality . Many studies10 , 12 , 17 , 18 , 20 indicate mention change metabolism determine abnormal function overlie photoreceptors/inner retina early disease process , cone population affect others18 , 20 , 21 . The study suggest possible detect localise abnormal retinal function early colour contrast sensitivity ( CCS ) , especially blue‐yellow ( tritan ) axis . The investigator therefore propose technique utilised identify people risk develop nARMD early , presymptomatic stage disease . The study also evaluate modality test either structure function retina , establish use early detection nARMD .</detailed_description>
