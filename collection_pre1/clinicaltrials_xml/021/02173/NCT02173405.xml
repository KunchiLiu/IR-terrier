	<brief_title>Injection With OnabotulinumtoxinA ( Botox ) Treatment Chronic Pelvic Pain</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>BACKGROUND AND RATIONALE : Chronic pelvic pain affect 15-20 % female population age 18-50 year account 10 % gynecologic visit year result cost 2.8 billion dollar annually health care system . It define non-menstrual ( non-cyclic ) pain occurs average two week per month least six month ' duration ; localize anatomic pelvis , anterior abdominal wall umbilicus , buttock , lumbosacral back . Many affected patient note severely short tight pelvic floor muscle examination ( termed MPP ) , result pelvic floor trigger point may cause associate pelvic symptom , include : dyspareunia , urinary urgency frequency , symptom urinary tract infection , pelvic discomfort heaviness.As result constant , severe pain associate symptom , woman chronic pelvic pain likely experience decrease quality life , depression , anxiety towards condition . The difficulty treat chronic pelvic pain etiology vary multifactorial . Frequently associate abnormal response acute injury pelvic infection , traumatic birth , endometriosis repetitive insult like chronic constipation , chronic pelvic pain also result prolonged pelvic floor muscle spasm muscular hypertonicity . Specialized examination pelvic floor musculature patient chronic pelvic pain often reveal MPP well 'trigger points'.11 This pain perpetuate result modification neuronal pathway maintain set pattern pain sensation include increase pain sensitivity ( hyperalgesia ) , refer pain , even change tissue make-up . The treatment MPP must therefore treat incite injury modify tissue response . The effect onabotulinumtoxinA painful muscle first suggest effect toxin injection patient migraine headache . While undergo onabotulinumtoxinA injection cosmetic purpose , patient also suffer migraine headache find symptom improvement . Further follow-up study demonstrate 51 % complete resolution 38 % partial response note migraine symptom within 1 2 hour treatment among true migraine patient . Although mechanism action remain unclear , onabotulinumtoxinA believe act denervating autonomic nerve , thereby alter peripheral sensory nerve function interrupt migraine cycle pain . The trigeminal neurovascular theory migraine pain suggest onabotulinumtoxinA act cause muscle paralysis , also inhibit transmission vesicle synaptic junction , include vasoactive intestinal peptide . This blockage neuromuscular junction transmission inhibits muscle activity efferent pain signal . Interestingly , though muscle paralysis take one week manifest , pain relief occur 1 2 hour although flaccid paralysis last approximately 3 month , benefit migraine pain last much longer . STUDY RATIONALE : In MPP syndrome , prolonged muscle contraction , spasm , inappropriately high muscle tone think diminish blood supply increase oxygen demand muscle pelvic floor . Ischemic muscle may secrete pain-producing substance , sensitize muscle nociceptors , alter receptor field property , convert wide-band mechanoreceptors nociceptors . OnabotulinumtoxinA directly block cholinergic neuromuscular transmission interrupt cascade event lead hyperalgesia allodynia . onabotulinumtoxinA play direct role block alpha- gamma-motor neuron , thereby prevent abnormal pattern muscle contraction ( eg , spasm , dystonia ) activate muscle nociceptors sensitize muscle pain system mediators.The investigator division utilize pelvic floor injection onabotulinumtoxinA off-label treatment MPP conjunction pelvic floor physical therapy 6 year . In patient severe MPP , often unable tolerate vaginal exam , receive reduction pelvic pain extensive physical therapy , investigator utilize injection 100 U onabotulinumtoxinA pelvic floor trigger point significant success . Anecdotally , treat patient report 30-40 % reduction pain complaint 7-10 day post-treatment last approximately 3 month . Even pain recurs , severe pre-treatment patient take opportunity window reduce pain maximize progress pelvic floor physical therapy . Two four week pelvic floor injection , patient severe MPP report statistically significant change VAS score onabotulinumtoxinA treatment median reduction VAS -3.9 ( CI change score -2.2 , -5.6 , p &lt; 0.001 ) . Eighty percent patient report significant subjective improvement pelvic pain last 4 week anecdotally last 3 4 month duration . Adverse event report 22 % patient mild , limited : pelvic heaviness , increase pain , urinary irritation , nausea/vomiting . However , despite encouraging result , definitive evidence onabotulinumtoxinA effective treatment modality patient severe MPP . In evidence-based review literature regard treatment refractory pain onabotulinumtoxinA , Jabbari Machado find level C evidence ( possibly effective , may use discretion clinician ) investigate role onabotulinumtoxinAs treatment MPP . Moreover , less know regard potential side effect onabotulinumtoxinA inject pelvic floor muscle . Therefore , strong randomize control study necessary investigate efficacy possible side effect pelvic floor injection onabotulinumtoxinA treatment MPP syndrome actually research proposal . It hope study significantly change current clinical treatment protocol MPP syndrome . STUDY DESIGN : This phase I study participant randomize 1:1 ( onabotulinumtoxinA : placebo ) , double-blinded , placebo-controlled clinical trial . Potential participant woman seek treatment MPP diagnose participate clinical investigator base follow criterion : MPP define least 4 5 palpable trigger point transvaginal and/or transrectal examination pelvic floor , reproduces pain seek medical care . A trigger point define extremely tender focus muscle cause pain radiate area specific trigger point . A trigger point term 'active ' pain occur spontaneously , 'latent ' palpation pressure require elicit pain , may replicate symptom radiate surround low extremity , pelvic abdominal site . This study two arm : * Treatment group : 20 patient randomly assign receive 100 U onabotulinumtoxinA reconstitute 20 ml saline sequentially inject bilaterally pubococcygeus , iliococcygeus , coccygeus , obturator internus , piriformis muscle . * Placebo group : 20 patient randomly assign receive 20 ml saline bilaterally pelvic floor muscle . All injection perform use pudendal injection tray clinical treatment area obtain consent . The patient randomize use computer-generated randomization sequence balance block four . Both patient physician blind first injection assignment . All participant inadequate symptom control ( VAS score 7 ) 1 month injection treatment unblinded . Those receive placebo ( saline ) offer injection open label onabotlulinumA . Those previously receive onabotlulinumA eligible reinjection . All patient follow 6 month initial injection 6 month follow second injection . All patient opt second injection begin outline injection follow-up visit schedule . STUDY PROCEDURES : Screening - A detailed medical surgical history , demographic information review medication take patient suspected MPP . Then , physical exam pelvic floor examination myofascial trigger point perform . It include assessment VAS bilateral pubococcygeus , iliococcygeus , coccygeus , obturator internus , piriformis muscle . All VAS score record . Post residual Void ( PVR ) record . Patients assessment post residual void ( PVR ) volume record . Patients meet inclusion criterion offer study participation . Patients agree participate formally consented complete pertinent questionnaire : * Short Form 12 ( SF-12 ) quality life assessment * Patient Global Impression Index ( PGI-I ) degree bother pelvic pain * Pelvic Floor Distress Inventory ( PFDI ) Pelvic Floor Impact Questionnaire ( PFIQ - short form 7 ) ass bladder bowel function * Female Sexual Function Index ( FSFI ) sexual function assessment . Currently validate questionnaire symptom MPP exist . Procedure - A pudendal block type needle gently advance along outstretched finger . Holding needle near horizontal plane , pelvic floor muscle inject systematic fashion start levator ani march backward way back piriformis muscle include obturator internus muscle . The following muscle sequentially inject 2 cc dilute onabotulinumtoxinA : pubococcygeus ( muscle felt sling around vagina , proximal hymenal ring ) , iliococcygeus ( palpate superiorly laterally pubococcygeus muscle ) , obturator internus ( sidewall pelvis superior arcus tendineus levator ani ) , coccygeus ( half distance ischial spine sacrum ) , piriformis ( muscle palpate fill posterolateral pelvic wall inject lateral sacrum ) . Careful attention make withdraw prior injection ensure intravascular injection dilute onabotulinumtoxinA . Once injection perform one side pelvis , pressure hold good hemostasis . The procedure perform side . Peri-procedural adverse event record . Post Procedure Instructions - Post treatment , patient monitor 15 minute . Standardized post-injection instruction give participant verbally write form . Patients contact telephone within 24-48 hour procedure safety assessment . The first follow-up evaluation schedule 1 month pelvic floor injection . Follow-Up Visits 3 , 4 , 5 , 6 , 7 &amp; Visit 8 ( Visit 8 , Patient Received 2nd Injection ) - Follow-up clinic evaluation occur 1 , 2 , 3 , 4 6 month injection , respectively . A history take physical examination include PVR assessment perform follow-up visit . VAS score pelvic floor muscle record . PGI-I , PFDI , PFIQ , FSFI form collect follow-up visit . Adverse event carefully monitor record .</detailed_description>
