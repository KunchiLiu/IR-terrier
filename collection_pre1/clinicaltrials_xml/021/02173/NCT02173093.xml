	<brief_summary>The investigator find previous research investigator coat ( arm ) T cell special molecule call GD2 bispecific antibody help T cell recognize neuroblastoma osteosarcoma cell kill . This bispecific antibody recognize GD2 , protein find almost neuroblastoma osteosarcoma cell . The investigator put GD2 bispecific antibody T cell give large number T cell back patient . The investigator think T cell may better chance kill neuroblastoma tumor cell arm GD2 bispecific antibody . This trial study side effect best dose activate T cell arm GD2 bispecific antibody well work treat patient neuroblastoma , osteosarcoma , GD2-positive solid tumor .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To perform phase I dose-escalation study patient recurrent refractory neuroblastoma ( NB ) GD2-positive tumor evaluate safety tolerability determine maximum tolerate dose ( MTD ) anti-CD3 x hu3F8 bispecific antibody ( GD2Bi ) -armed activated T cell ( aATC ) infuse twice week total eight infusion combination daily IL-2 ( 300,000 IU/m^2/day ) GM-CSF ( 250 ug/m^2 twice per week ) standard 3 + 3 dose escalation schema 40 , 80 , 160 x 10^6 cells/kg/infusion dose level . II . To conduct phase II clinical trial explore efficacy confirm toxicity profile GD2Bi-aATC combine IL-2 GM-CSF phase II expansion cohort 22 patient neuroblastoma ( NB ) use MTD determine phase I . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . Evaluate immune response phase I/II trial sequential monitoring anti-NB cytotoxicity peripheral blood lymphocytes IFN-gamma EliSpots direct NB line . II . To evaluate persistence aATC blood tumor biopsy stain murine IgG2a confirm trafficking arm T cell tumor . III . To conduct exploratory study ( 18F FDG ) positron emission tomography ( PET ) /computed tomography ( CT ) arm ATC infusion select patient PET/CT measurable soft tissue skeletal lesion . OUTLINE : This phase I , dose-escalation study OKT3/humanized 3F8 bispecific antibody-aATC follow phase II study . Patients receive IL-2 subcutaneously ( SC ) daily day -2 35 , sargramostim SC twice weekly 4 week , OKT3/humanized 3F8 bispecific antibody-aATC intravenously ( IV ) 30 minute twice weekly 4 week . After completion study treatment , patient follow 1 , 3 , 6 , 12 month .</detailed_description>
