	<detailed_description>For Americans age 65 older , fall lead cause fatal nonfatal unintentional injury . Although comprise 5 % elderly population , 20 % fall-related elderly death continuous-care facility resident . In five year fall , 75 % faller institutional care die , 58 % age-matched non-fallers die . The increase risk observe facility product high fall incidence ( 26-56 % ) fall rate ( 1.4-2.0 fall per person bed ) . The incidence recurrent fall population 33-40 % , 28 % faller five fall . Roughly 12-33 % fall result serious injury fracture , head trauma , soft-tissue injury , severe laceration . About 1-4 % fall result fracture , injury comprises majority ( 75 % ) fall-related admission continuous-care facility hospital . Such hospital admission cost $ 31,000 per admission , contributes estimate medical cost $ 1,200 per fall . The propose research significant address high incidence fall-related injury death , turn reduce notable medical cost . Based rigorous review 1200 participant , supervise exercise significantly reduce rate fall ( rate ratio : 0.74-1.35 ) number faller ( risk ratio : 0.88-1.21 ) continuous-care facilities15 . The effective exercise focus control upright posture response small gait disturbance ( rate ratio : 0.24-0.85 , risk ratio : 0.43-1.19 ) . However , efficacy intervention improve safely increase magnitude disturbance ( i.e . great intensity ) focus skill necessary recover common fall cause ( i.e . great specificity ) . Compensatory step train safely induces fall deliver large postural disturbance , turn require subject arrest fall timely , well-placed step reduce trunk rotation . Similar demand step placement trunk control evident recover trip slip , common fall-causes older adult community . Obstacles slippery surface prevalent cause fall within care facility suggest trip slip also problematic environment . For community-dwelling old woman , compensatory step train significantly improve step trunk kinematics reduce fall due trip laboratory ( odds ratio = 0.13 ) . Furthermore , preliminary evidence suggest train reduces fall incidence 17 % community . Published unpublished data show compensatory step train improved compensatory step response , undisturbed gait , fall incidence low extremity amputation . It likely train benefit high fall incidence observe care facility . The propose research innovative novel application state-of-the-art intervention likely improve efficacy supervise exercise mean reduce fall continuous-care facility . A widely implement prevention strategy institutional setting target resident high risk fall . As assessed subjective measure fall history , relative fall risk high-risk resident 3 time higher low-risk resident . The fall incidence low-risk resident , determine objective functional test , report . Recording statistic would provide perspective subpopulation relative community-dwelling older adult , establish benchmark evaluate long-term effect intervention high-risk resident . Identifying short-term , functional improvement associate intervention may reveal mechanisms training-based improvement , inform protocol development improve efficacy . The primary objective evaluate effect compensatory step train fall incidence long-term care facility resident high risk fall . The investigator hypothesize compensatory step train prospectively reduce fall incidence high-risk resident level inferior fall incidence low-risk resident . The study non-inferiority trial intend show training high-risk resident yield fall incidence bad low-risk resident . Although trial less credible design , study demand few resource . Functional assessment fall risk occur care facility . These assessment include functional reach test , unipedal stance test , tandem stance test , figure-eight walk test , time-up-and-go test , step-up test , Activities-specific Balance Confidence questionnaire , grip strength test , maximum voluntary step length test , fall history assessment . Based result functional reach test unipedal stance test , subject identify low-risk ( functional reach &gt; 8 '' AND unipedal stance &gt; 5 ) high-risk ( functional reach ≤ 8 '' OR unipedal stance ≤ 5 ) . Those low risk fall high risk fall qualify training fall record one year . Those high risk fall qualify training undergo compensatory step training , undergo second set functional assessment , fall record one year . For high-risk subject , health screening assess medical physician nurse practitioner . If subject meet exclusion criterion , train take place subject fall monitor one year . For high-risk subject otherwise pass exclusion criterion , hip bone mineral density assess use DXA Mayo Clinic Charlton Clinical Research Unit . If subject meet bone mineral density exclusion criterion ( femoral neck total hip bone mineral density t-score less -2.5 ) , train take place subject fall monitor one year . If DXA scan poor quality ( e.g . artifact subject movement ) , repeat . At , two DXA scan take subject . Subjects participate compensatory step train 6 session 7 30 day . Each session comprise anterior posterior step train microprocessor-controlled treadmill ( ActiveStep® , Simbex , Lebanon , NH ) . Training consist progression anterior posterior treadmill belt movement apply subject stand walking . The training intensity ( magnitude disturbance deliver ) progressive dependent subject performance . Subjects instructed respond single multiple step order prevent fall . All subject outfit safety harness prevent injury . This training specifically focus aspect important trip slip recovery . Up 72 disturbance deliver session . Falls record one year per facility operation fall-tracking questionnaire . Adults 50 year old live continuous-care retirement facility recruit study . The investigator anticipate 150 subject participate study , 30 subject participate compensatory step training .</detailed_description>

During visit CRU , subject 's height weight measure . If subject hip DXA scan within 6 month participation , exclusion criterion base previous scan .
