	<brief_title>Chest CT With Iterative Reconstruction Alternative Conventional Chest X-ray Prior Heart Surgery</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>During heart surgery aorta clamp initiate cardiopulmonary bypass . This may crush aortic calcification cause embolize brain cause stroke devastate complication patient . A chest X-ray routinely perform prior heart surgery . It provide information aortic calcification . Imaging chest compute tomography ( CT ) scan provide detailed information aortic calcification high radiation exposure thus use routinely . Recently iterative reconstruction ( IR ) techniques become available allow chest CT perform markedly reduce dose retain image quality . Routine use low dose chest CT IR prior heart surgery may identify patient severely calcify aorta surgery may subsequently adapt minimize avoid aortic manipulation may reduce stroke rate . In multicenter randomize control clinical trial effect preoperative chest CT postoperative stroke investigate . In total 1724 patient include 862 patient receive additional CT standard care 862 patient receive routine care .</detailed_description>
