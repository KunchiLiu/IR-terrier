	<brief_summary>In study investigator aim investigate whether sympathetic stimulation BAT , assess 123I-metaiodobenzylguanidine single-photon emission compute tomography compute tomography scan , differs lean obese individual , explanation diminish metabolic brown adipose tissue activity obese subject . The investigator hypothesis sympathetic nervous system activity obese diminish compare leaner counterpart explanation diminish metabolic brown adipose tissue activity obese .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The sympathetic nervous system primary activator Brown Adipose Tissue . Obese human know less metabolically active brown adipose tissue compare leaner counterpart . The reason diminish metabolic brown adipose tissue activity unknown . However , low sympathetic nervous system activation brown adipose tissue obese might explain diminished metabolic brown adipose tissue . Therefore , study , sympathetic nervous system activation brown adipose tissue metabolic activity measure lean obese subject . sympathetic nervous system activity measure use 123I-metaiodobenzylguanidine single-photon emission compute tomography scan , metabolic activity measure use 18F- fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography CT scan .</detailed_description>
