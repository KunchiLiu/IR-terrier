	<detailed_description>Background Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis progressive interstitial lung disease , ultimately lead respiratory failure death . The median survival 2-3 year thus comparable survival malignant disease . Today , cure available . Improvement quality life ( QoL ) thus major goal IPF patient . Cough common distress debilitate symptom IPF . Increased cough IPF patient may link functional upregulation lung sensory neurones . In addition , cough independently predict disease progression IPF patient . Symptomatic treatment option cough IPF limit . Dysregulation immune system suggest cause IPF associate cough treatment trial immunomodulating agent promise . Unfortunately recently study medication thalidomide famous side effect might apprehensively received patient . Immunomodulatory effect macrolide treatment chronic inflammatory disease well reduce cough reflex animal study suggest possible reduction cough IPF patient . In addition , animal vivo model azithromycin also show anti-fibrotic property . The investigator hypothesize immunomodulatory treatment IPF patient AZT reduce cough frequency might improve lung function . Objective The purpose protocol determine effect azithromycin ( AZT ) subjective objective cough , QoL lung function , effect biomarkers well safety patient idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis.Specific Objectives 1 . To determine efficiency 12 week treatment subjective objective cough reduction increase QoL 2 . To monitor safety record severe adverse event , include mortality , organ-specific toxicity exacerbation require hospitalization 3 . To test efficiency 12 week overall response measure change FEV1 , FVC , TLC , DLCO , oxygen desaturation exertion 6-min walking distance 4 . To determine efficiency clinical course 5 . To monitor overall adverse event 6 . To determine influence cytokine biomarkers IPF 7 . To determine impact oro-pharyngeal flora antibiotical resistance Methods Single center , prospective , randomize , double blind , 2 treatment , 2 period crossover study two 12-week treatment period separate 4-week drug-free washout period 4 week follow-up period perform University Hospital Berne . All patient treat AZT placebo . Individual change clinical symptom focus cough frequency , life quality , lung function adverse event monitor .</detailed_description>
