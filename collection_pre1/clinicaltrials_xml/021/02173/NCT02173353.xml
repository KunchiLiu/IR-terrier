	<brief_title>Feasibility Using Ultrasound Track Pancreas Motion</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>1 . Acquire 2D 3D ultrasound image 5 pancreatic cancer patient use exist Clarity system hand-held probe . The visibility pancreas , duodenum , organ evaluate . Based image acquisition experience , design construct stand hold ultrasound probe . Issues consider design include ( ) avoid stand probe block radiation beam , ( ii ) avoid ultrasound go rib , ( iii ) minimize effect respiration motion . Also explore build probe immobilization device ( e.g. , Alpha cradle ) use robotic arm . 2 . Acquire ultrasound image 20 patient pancreatic cancer treat Department Radiation Oncology department use tool develop Aim 1 . As standard practice , 4DCT 4D morphological physiological MRI ( T1 , T2 , ADC , DWI ) acquire treatment planning , respiration-gated CT acquire immediately delivery fraction use in-room CT cone-beam CT patient positioning . The ultrasound image may acquire initial simulation immediately plan 4DCT daily gate CT , treatment delivery 2D , 3D and/or 4D mode . All raw ultrasound data store . 3 . Process ultrasound data acquire evaluate effectiveness use ultrasound image track pancreas/duodenum motion treatment delivery . The image process visualize pancreas and/or surrogate , boundary pancreas duodenum , infusion catheter . To improve visible appearance , elastography explore process raw data collect Aim 2 . Existing software use , may modify necessary , segment register ultrasound CT. A tool investigator previous develop multimodality registration use register ultrasound MRI . Anatomic marker , boundary pancreas head duodenum , stent , infusion catheter , may use registration and/or motion track . 4 . Develop/modify workflow process allow final system use routinely radiation therapist . If necessary , user-friendly software tool developed/incorporated final system . 5 . Explore use Doppler mode tissue characterization potential use image radiation effect .</detailed_description>
