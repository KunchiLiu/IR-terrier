	<detailed_description>The propose study single-center , placebo-controlled , randomize , 2-arm , 2-sequence , crossover study characterize bioavailability kinetic profile coffee 6-hour postprandial day ( PPD ) . A planned sample size 10 recruit study . This study require one initial screen visit , pre-study visit , 2 PPDs . This study take 3-6 week per subject complete . The trial initiate screen visit , last 1-1.5 hour subject ' height , weight , waist circumference , fast blood glucose , fast hs-CRP ( high sensitivity C-reactive protein ) concentration , blood pressure heart rate measure survey related general eating , health exercise habit complete . If willing eligible participate , 3-day food record ( 2 weekday 1 weekend ) give screen visit collect follow pre-study Visit ass subject 's baseline dietary intake pattern . Also , subject instruct follow relatively low polyphenolic-diet least 7 day prior first PPD duration study .

Each PPD require blood draw throughout visit . After evaluation subject 's health status ( via anthropometric , vital sign blood glucose measurement in-person interview ) , register nurse place catheter subject 's arm purpose multiple blood sample collection take initial blood draw fast state . A standard high carbohydrate high fat test meal either 1 cup coffee 1 cup hot water serve . Thereafter , timer start blood sample collect 20 , 40 , 60 , 120 , 180 , 240 , 300 , 360 minute assessment change inflammation marker relative metabolic index . The sequence receive coffee hot water treatment visit randomly assign base computer generate sequence : hot water- coffee coffee-hot water .
