	<brief_title>Body Contouring Surgery After Massive Weight Loss</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Background The obesity epidemic worldwide continue worsen , rate Europe North America estimate 20-30 % adult population . ( Vico et al. , 2010 ) It define body mass index ( BMI ) 30 , morbid obesity BMI 40kgm-2 . ( Strauch et al. , 2006 ; Vico et al. , 2010 ) As consequence , explosive growth obesity-associated comorbidities , associate high healthcare cost . ( Reiffel et al. , 2013 ) One consistent mean achieve significant weight-loss morbidly obese patient bariatric surgery ( BS ) . ( Buchwald et al. , 2004 ; Maggard et al. , 2005 ) Shermak et al . define massive weight loss ( MWL ) 50 % great loss excess weight . ( Shermak et al. , 2006 ) Next amelioration medical comorbidities associate obesity , patient also benefit improvement psychosocial functioning , personal health perception health-related quality life . ( Karlsson et al. , 1998 ; Karlsson et al. , 2007 ; Sarwer et al. , 2008 ) A major drawback BS persistence large quantity excess inelastic skin subcutaneous tissue . Thus , patient often experience skin irritation , mycotic infection secondary self-imaging problem . ( Reiffel et al. , 2013 ; Vico et al. , 2010 ) Body contour ( BC ) surgery , usually excisional , include ( circumferential ) abdominoplasty , breast reduction , panniculectomy , brachioplasty , thigh lift . It remove excess tissue remain massive weight loss consecutively lead significant improvement self-image self-esteem , well mobility , overall daily function hygiene . ( Larsen et al. , 2007 ; Song et al. , 2006 ) These procedure usually multiple extensive . Thus , combine reduce number procedure obtain optimal result would beneficial surgeon patient . ( Ellabban Hart , 2004 ; Hallock Altobelli , 1985 ) For patient seek BS , quality life important issue . In recent study Modarressi et al . show Roux-en-Y gastric bypass ( RYGBP ) improve health-related quality life ( HRQoL ) . Furthermore , show HRQoL directly relate weight loss BC procedures improve HRQoL comparison RYGBP alone , evidence Moorehead-Ardelt questionnaire . ( Modarressi et al. , 2013 ; Oria Moorehead , 1998 ) Nevertheless , urgent need develop specific well-constructed patient report outcome ( PRO ) instrument order obtain reliable information regard QoL patient satisfaction follow BC surgery MWL patient . ( Jabir , 2013 ) Clinical Data In literature inconsistent data regard QoL scale BC procedure . ( Singh et al. , 2012 ) Problems MWL excessive skin fold compromise body image may negatively impact physical mental component QoL . ( Mitchell et al. , 2008 ) Thus , theoretically , removal skin excess , QoL scale improve BC procedure . Indeed , several study demonstrate improvement QoL associate BC surgery . ( Coriddi et al. , 2011 ; Pecori et al. , 2007 ; Song et al. , 2006 ; van der Beek et al. , 2010 ) However , recent study Singh et al. , scale comprise mental component lower group patient receive BC procedure , indicate impaired QoL . ( Singh et al. , 2012 ) Of , role-emotional social functioning significantly low control post-bariatric surgery group , show patient elect BC procedure suffer worsen inhibit social interaction . ( Singh et al. , 2012 ) It might arguable patient post-bariatric surgery group elect undergo BC choose QoL already high . ( Singh et al. , 2012 ) Thus , counsel education prior plastic surgery extremely important ensure appropriate expectation patient regard scar realistic scope accomplish surgery . ( Singh et al. , 2012 ) QoL , especially woman age 35 64 year old , affect domain patient BMI &gt; 40kg/m2 . ( Larsson et al. , 2002 ) This dissatisfaction motivate different behaviour , include exercise , weight loss cosmetic surgery . ( Sarwer et al. , 2008 ) Thus , despite obesity prevalent men , might explain partially woman frequently seek bariatric surgery . ( Modarressi et al. , 2013 ) Following BS , patient initially enthusiastic see cure diabetes , decrease pain joint weight loss . ( Colwell , 2010 ) Nevertheless , skin contract volume loss . ( Colwell , 2010 ) As soon weight stable least 6 month , plastic surgical evaluation seem appropriate . ( Colwell , 2010 ) In general , low BMI time BC surgery , good result . ( Langer et al. , 2011 ) Usually , condouting procedure preserve patient attain BMI le equal 35 . ( Arthurs et al. , 2007 ) To date , little known frequency proportion patient undergo BS consequently receive BC surgery . Reasons undergo body contour procedure lack awareness regard option expense . ( Reiffel et al. , 2013 ) Documentation functional problem , rash , sexual dysfunction difficulty exercise important attempt obtain insurance coverage least part surgery . ( Arthurs et al. , 2007 ) Panniculectomy , define removal excess skin fat abdomen without umbilical transpostion , surgical procedure likely cover insurance . Usually , truncal deformity common present complaint MWL patient , procedure choice lower body lift . ( Colwell , 2010 ) It crucial focus postoperatively patient safety prioritize seroma prevention deep vein thrombosis ( DVT ) prophylaxis . Reported complication rate postoperative range 17-50 % include wound-healing problem , haematoma , infection , necrosis pulmonary embolism . ( Vico et al. , 2010 ) Furthermore , many patient psychiatric problem , thus counsel , especially perioperative period extremely important . ( Langer et al. , 2011 ) The number procedures safely perform one sit depend patient 's anatomy , surgeon , surgical facility overall medical health . ( Arthurs et al. , 2007 ) The patient 's BMI normal slightly overweight . Otherwise , stag procedure two surgery separate 3-6 month suggest . ( Arthurs et al. , 2007 ) Ideally , operative time keep six hour minimize complication . ( Langer et al. , 2011 ) Obviously , vector pull surgery opposite direction , upper body lift belt lipectomy/lower body lift , procedure perform separately . ( Langer et al. , 2011 ) In study Ellabban et al. , 14 patient evaluated underwent BC operation use combine abdominoplasty medial thigh reduction . The author conclude combined abdominoplasty vertical medial thigh reduction effective correcting aesthetic physical problem massive weight reduction excellent predictable outcome . ( Ellabban Hart , 2004 ) Also , combine brachioplasty , thoracoplasty , mammoplasty proven safe , effective , beneficial surgeon patient . ( Hallock Altobelli , 1985 ) In order establish evidence base support idea BC much ( even ) functional procedure cosmetic , flurry study assess QoL patient satisfaction follow BC surgery result . ( Jabir , 2013 ) The method choice ass QoL patient satisfaction use patient specific psychometrically validated PRO measure . ( Jabir , 2013 ) To date , none measure specifically develop BC surgery patient . Instead , urgent need develop specific well- constructed PRO instrument order obtain reliable information regard QoL patient satisfaction BC surgery MWL patient . ( Jabir , 2013 ) STUDY OBJECTIVES The main objective research analyse QoL patient satisfaction BC surgery MWL male female patient . We hypothesize &gt; 80 % patient total score +2.25 +3 ( `` much good '' ) +0.75 +2 ( `` good '' ) Moorehead-Ardelt questionnaire . 66 patient equal distribution demographic characteristic bariatric surgery secondary reconstructive procedure serve control group . The associated research question follow : What outcome patient BC surgery MWL concerning : Hypotheses : Primary outcome : After mean follow-up 8.9Â±3.5 year BC surgery hypothesize &gt; 90 % 66 patient answer survey . Based literature ( Modarressi et al. , 2013 ) , expect &gt; 80 % patient total score +2.25 +3 ( `` much good '' ) +0.75 +2 ( `` good '' ) Moorehead-Ardelt questionnaire .</detailed_description>
