	<detailed_description>Surgery severe aortic stenosis ( AS ) prior symptom onset controversial . Conventionally change valve area gradient use time intervention myocardial change may predictive surgical need . This study aim elucidate role diffuse myocardial fibrosis prognostic marker , implement novel , non-invasive technique measure . AS common valvular heart condition United Kingdom Western world . Its prevalence rise age - 3 % age 75 severe AS . During period progressive valve narrowing , leave ventricle ( LV ) adapts increase pressure increase concentric muscle hypertrophy . However , eventually remodelling becomes maladaptive LV less compliant , leading symptom ( breathlessness , chest pain , loss consciousness ) . This herald significant increase morbidity mortality . Consequently aortic valve replacement ( AVR ) symptomatic patient Class I indication . In asymptomatic patient however , prophylactic surgery controversial : risk surgery think great watchful waiting , although randomise data support approach . Conversely , diffuse myocardial fibrosis think play key role functional deterioration , symptom development possibly outcome AS . Unfortunately , assessment AS severity , include hemodynamic parameter peak velocity mean gradient , poorly predict symptom development and/or optimal timing surgery . A non-invasive technique quantify diffuse myocardial fibrosis gold standard myocardial biopsy develop validated patient AS : Cardiovascular magnetic resonance ( CMR ) T1 map us extracellular tracer gadolinium measure extracellular volume ( ECV ) , closely reflect degree diffuse fibrosis . An important observation previous cohort ( Flett et al European Heart Journal Cardiovascular Imaging 2012 ) fate patient severe fibrosis : symptomatic baseline , improve post-operatively yet carry trend towards increase mortality six month . To unravel , study aim track diffuse fibrosis RELIEF-AS study large cohort ( n=150 ) longer ( 12 month ) understand use diffuse fibrosis prognostic marker .</detailed_description>
