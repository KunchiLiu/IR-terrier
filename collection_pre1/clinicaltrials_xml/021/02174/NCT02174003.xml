	<brief_summary>This protocol allow implementation research registry pertain Whole Body Hyperthermia ( WBH ) use various subject population . The primary objective propose study determine WBH beneficial effect various subject population currently experience numerous comorbidities , duration effect ( ) . This protocol intend become secondary resort individual 's interested receiving Hyperthermia treatment potential beneficial gain related symptom stem comorbidities depression ( i.e . Fibromyalgia , Perimenopausal symptom , arthritis , etc ) . Due fact external research funding acquire broad application protocol intend charge fee cost cover purpose . The registry trial limit include individual major depressive disorder , however , protocol allow expand use population ( still exclude subject base safety parameter ) . We monitor subject 's physiological clinical outcome ( applicable ) single Whole Body Hyperthermia treatment open fashion ( placebo/control condition ) . This registry study include safety assessment 5 day prior WBH , day WBH 1 week follow WBH .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The WBH procedure propose protocol rigorously research subject Major Depressive Disorder ( MDD ) , little preliminary data pertain WBH use population outside depression study . In preliminary study Europe rigorously test clinical trial conduct University Arizona ( NCT01625546 ) , single exposure WBH result decrease depressive symptom measure use German version CES-D depression scale 5 day later ( study Switzerland ) use HamD rating scale 7 day later UA study . All research application thus far result minimal adverse effect study subject . During conduct research protocol 12-0147-04/NCT01625546 ( WBH subject Major Depression ) research site contact numerous individual across country ask participate clinical trial . However due rigorous inclusion/exclusion criterion necessary data collection , individual offer research treatment . This protocol intend become secondary resort individual 's interested receiving Hyperthermia treatment potential beneficial gain related symptom stem comorbidities ( i.e . Fibromyalgia , Perimenopausal symptom , arthritis , etc ) . In fact , course study , several individual suffer fibromyalgia , rheumatoid arthritis similar affliction , discussion study staff screening , indicate previously research infrared heating whole body hyperthermia find helpful many people affliction . As , interested part study order receive treatment might help ease pain affliction addition depression symptom experience , give depression often co-morbidity illness . Due fact external research funding acquire broad application , protocol intend charge fee cost cover purpose . The registry trial limit include individual MDD , however protocol allow expand use population ( still exclude subject base safety parameter ) . We monitor subject 's physiological clinical outcome ( applicable ) single Whole Body Hyperthermia treatment open fashion ( placebo/control condition ) . This registry study include safety assessment 5 day prior WBH , day WBH 1 week follow WBH . Costs Participating Study : The WBH session investigational procedure , one approve limited test Food Drug Administration ( FDA ) general use . In addition time , charge fee $ 800 cost covering purpose . The cost open treatment hyperthermia session cover departmental staff time , clinical space , research material , overhead fee . You may pay cash , check , credit card . If wish pay credit card , 3 % fee assess cover credit card processing fee . All payment make Department Psychiatry process Departmental business office . The payment may break 2 tier : Screening : $ 200 WBH Procedure : $ 600 If qualify WBH procedure remain $ 600 due prior completion procedure . If pay full determine qualify study , reimburse less amount need cover procedure perform ( i.e . screen ) . Future WBH Treatment Sessions : If wish undergo another WBH procedure , may without repeat screen blood EKG 's within 1 year original screen , long report significant change health history study staff . You charge screen procedure subsequent WBH procedure . Those individual participate previous WBH protocol consider eligible without need re-screen within 1 year original screening procedure .</detailed_description>
