	<brief_summary>The purpose study evaluate cost-utility analysis order provide recommendation French decision-makers vertebroplasty radiation therapy Bone spine metastasis . Indeed , radiation therapy often advocate systematic way . The object study would expand use vertebroplasty . Moreover , study assess strategy impact pain control reduction functional preservation . In fact , analgesic effect achieve differently depend procedure used.Eligible patient recruit register consecutively . Patients randomly , This health-economic multicenter , prospective , randomized stratification accord number vertebra treat ( 1-3 vertebra v 4-6 vertebra ) center : - Arm A : Percutaneous vertebroplasty - Arm B : External radiotherapy This open-label study . The expected total study period 2.5 year ( enrolment : 2 year , patient follow-up : 6 month ) . A total number 304 patient spine metastasis recruit ( 152 patients/arm ) .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Health Economics Evaluation Percutaneous Vertebroplasty Compared Radiation Therapy Patients With Painful Spine Metastases .</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Bone common site metastasis . In breast prostate cancer , 70 % patient die cancer evidence metastatic bone disease [ Coleman , 2006 ] . Depending localization , bone metastasis debilitate consequence result considerable morbidity complex demand health care resource . Bone spine metastases frequent site observe patient cancer lung , prostate , breast hemopoetic organ . The occurrence spinal metastasis patient advance cancer cause significant morbidity , pain and/or neurological deficit adversely affect patient ' quality life . Interventional radiology take large place treatment bone metastasis . Currently , vertebroplasty appear satisfactory technique stabilization spine metastases offer significant improvement quality life . The analgesic effect achieve rapidly , i.e . usually within 24 hour post-procedure . Based several publication , around 90 % patient report rapid pain relief follow vertebroplasty 60 70 % complete pain relief [ Mendel , 2009 ] . Radiotherapy also play important role palliative treatment metastatic bone . Radiotherapy effective well tolerate . A reduction pain notice 70 80 % patient begin one two week treatment . In , radiotherapy increase quality life patient reduce intake analgesic [ Lutz , 2011 ] . In lot case , vertebroplasty radiotherapy perform painful patient ( National Institute Health Clinical Excellence ( NICE ) approve use vertebroplasty patient spinal metastasis November 2008 ) . Radiotherapy remain gold-standard treatment . However , vertebroplasty could less costly effective compare radiotherapy . In fact , superiority vertebroplasty demonstrate least acute post-therapeutic period ( ) rapid autonomy recovery , ( ii ) reduction antalgic intake , potentially less side-effects .</detailed_description>
