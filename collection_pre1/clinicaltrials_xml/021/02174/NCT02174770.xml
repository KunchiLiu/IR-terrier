	<brief_summary>Occlusion training , resistance exercise perform specialized venous tourniquet , lead beneficial change muscle low resistance minimal stress nearby joint . This novel resistance train potential greatly improve extremity muscle strength gain rehabilitation patient unable medical reason perform high resistance exercise . Our study explore specific rehabilitation population : post-operative knee scope , post-operative anterior cruciate ligament ( ACL ) reconstruction patient acute post-operative change thigh muscle function chronic thigh weakness . The primary outcome achieve accelerate functional thigh recovery outcome measure include thigh strength , validated questionnaire , validate functional testing . Occlusion train enhance rehab patient outcomes , reduce cost care , improve skill efficiency care provider .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Occlusion train restriction venous outflow extremity use tourniquet weight-training resistance exercise . The technique safe effective method improve strength muscle hypertrophy healthy , active individual ( 1-7 ) . The technique also show safe effective patient population various comorbidities ( 8 ) .These strength gain achieve train load low 20 % individual 's one repetition maximum ( 1RM ) . This contrary American College Sports Medicine ( ACSM ) weight-training guideline state muscle hypertrophy achieve individual lift load close 80 % 1RM ( 9 ) . The purpose project compare occlusion resistance train traditional resistance training method rehabilitation patient . This include acute post-operative ACL reconstruction cohort chronic thigh weakness cohort . Post-operative low extremity weakness well chronic muscle weakness trauma correlate lower functional performance . ( 10,11 ) We treat patient follow two cohort simultaneously . Specific Aim 1 : To determine occlusion train accelerate recovery thigh muscle function strength post-operative anterior cruciate ligament ( ACL ) reconstruction compare standard post-operative rehabilitation protocol . Specific Aim 2 : To determine occlusion train increase quadricep hamstring muscle function battlefield wound warrior severe thigh weakness result trauma volumetric muscle loss compare standard ACSM resistance training guideline . Specific Aim 3 : To determine occlusion train accelerate recovery thigh muscle function strength post-operative soft tissue knee arthroscopy compare standard post-operative rehabilitation protocol .</detailed_description>
