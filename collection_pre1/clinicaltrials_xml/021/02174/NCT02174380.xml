	<brief_title>Effectiveness Active Case Finding Household Contacts Routine Tuberculosis ( TB ) Control Program</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The Ministry Health TB program District SJL ( DISA NTP ) undertake new public health intervention involve active evaluation household contact . We collaborate roll intervention step wedge pragmatic randomize control trial order evaluate effectiveness cost-effectiveness intervention . Intervention Model The intervention roll across cluster ( health centre ) form step wedge design , unidirectional crossover , cluster start control arm randomize time point cross intervention arm . This continue step cluster ( health centre ) cross intervention arm . The randomization health centre timepoint cross intervention arm . This randomization stratify clinicTB rate &lt; 100/100,000 , TB rate 100 200/100,000 , clinic TB rate &gt; 200/100,000 , ensure balance clinic size randomize intervention arm time point . Power analysis Given number cluster , health centre ( n=35 ) fix , power analysis undertaken estimate small detectable difference overall yield active intervention ( ACF ) passive case finding ( PCF ) current study . The power analysis step wedge cluster design must modify account step implementation variation cluster size likely observe . In parallel study design achieve specify level power , population step wedge design le specified level power , standard normal deviate increase inflation factor . Using similar approach accounting step wedge design vary cluster size within sample , comparison expect baseline 1 % case detection among household contact anticipate passive case finding , power great 90 % detect differences 3 % 4 % ( overall yield ACF 4 5 % ) intervention control arm . Based previous study , anticipate adequate determine effect would clinical programmatic importance . The study undertaken district clinic course 18 month ( 3 baseline 15 month ACF program phase-in ) . In 2010 , DISA NTP report 1,871 TB case within 35 clinic 12 month ( unpublished Ministry Health data ) . We anticipate median 5 household contact per TB case ( range 3-7 ) . In previous study within district , response rate index case enrollment study district 80 % . In study recruit 60 Multidrug resistant ( MDR ) TB index case 80 randomly select drug-sensitive TB control SJL , 92 % case 98 % control select agree participate study . Therefore , give current propose roll 15 month , conservatively estimate 70 % participation 3 household contact per home would anticipate approximately 1900 index TB case approximately 5700 household contact . Data extraction management DISA NTP routinely collect data household contact evaluate public health form within TB case history . Similarly , home visit , additional ACF form household contact collect . The new ACF TB form public health form DISA NTP develop , however input study investigator , ensure data completeness quality incorporate data time cost program . The study investigator provide role pilot test validation data collection tool program procedure . DISA NTP staff conduct home visit , evaluation TB case contact relate data collection . Currently NTP data clinic level paper-based maintain individual TB case chart . Study specific team ( university-based ) audit extract routine public health active intervention TB form . This strategy ensure real-life pragmatic perspective program use DISA NTP staff implement program context regular TB program , however provide additional monitoring digitize data evaluation . Dedicated study field worker extract PCF ACF data prospectively original TB case history , household contact evaluation ACF intervention ( applicable ) form within index TB patient chart DISA NTP clinic . Information case histories TB patient 's household contact collect first month , 3 month 6 month time period . The extraction method include possible allow photocopy relevant public health form . These form summarize study data extraction form enter single secure database . Data verify supervisor compare extraction form chart form , database electronic record extraction form . Analysis The primary outcome interest overall yield secondary TB case either new active program compare passive routine program associate cost . Univariate analyse perform describe population characteristic . Analysis undertaken accord principle intention-to-treat ( ITT ) , use data collect individual TB case record randomize clinic , contact detect secondary case assign intervention comparator clinic time period . A marginal logistic regression model estimate use Generalized Estimated Equations ( GEE ) . The GEE model use logit link function , robust variance estimation robust misspecification correlation structure . Analysis unit individual accounting cluster clinic . Covariates include model include individual level age , gender , previous TB treatment , index TB case smear positivity gradient clinic level covariates . The treatment effect odds ratio time case detection intervention group ( ACF ) comparison comparator ( PCF ) .</detailed_description>
