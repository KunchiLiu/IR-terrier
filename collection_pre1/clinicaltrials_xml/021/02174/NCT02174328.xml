	<brief_title>Prevention Preeclampsia With Aspirin Recipients Donated Oocytes .</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Various marker propose early diagnosis preeclampsia : determination mean arterial pressure ; presence multiple risk factor preeclampsia ; biochemical , ultrasound , angiogenic marker ; uterine artery Doppler , etc . These used determinate patient increase risk develop preeclampsia gestation , therefore carry closer monitoring pregnancy population . In addition , marker also identify patient increase risk develop problem IUGR preterm labor . For nearly 30 year , multiple study try demonstrate aspirin prevents onset preeclampsia inconclusive result . However , recent study aspirin administer early stage ( 16 week gestation ) patient high risk complication , demonstrate decrease incidence entity . Thus , administration aspirin patient high risk ( patient classify high risk complication pregnancy , base marker mention ) seem useful prevent onset preeclampsia , IUGR complication , whenever administer early stage , show several study carry far . The incidence preeclampsia , IUGR complication pregnancy increase patient undergo treatment ovulation induction , much high recipient donate oocyte . It appear increase may explain immunological process . The focus lie interaction HLA-C fetal antigen maternal natural killer cell . We postulate , therefore , administration aspirin recipient donate oocyte early stage pregnancy , may also reduce incidence preeclampsia group patient . Moreover , observe patient preeclampsia exhibit low level VEGF , PlGF PAPP-A ( factor involve placental angiogenesis ) accompany increase sFlt1 ( potent PIGF VEGF antagonist ) .</detailed_description>
