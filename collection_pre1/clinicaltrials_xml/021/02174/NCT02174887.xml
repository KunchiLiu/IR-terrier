	<brief_summary>The prognostic metastatic pancreatic adenocarcinoma dismal treatment gold standard since end 90 ' gemcitabine ; unfortunately trial test combination gemcitabine chemotherapeutic agent target agent failed demonstrate superiority gemcitabine monotherapy . In recently publish phase I/II study combination gemcitabine plus nab-paclitaxel patient metastatic pancreatic adenocarcinoma ( PAC ) , combination give impressive response rate 48 % ( Gemcitabine 1g/m² nab-paclitaxel 125 mg/m² week 3 week , every 4 week ) . The safety profile correct ( fatigue , sensory neuropathy , nausea , haematological side effect ) . This efficacy related improvement gemcitabine delivery tumor bed , show preclinical study : response rate xenograft good combination ; improvement associate increase intratumoral gemcitabine concentration mouse receive combination compare mice receive gemcitabine alone . This might associate modification peritumoral stroma reduction stromal content increase dilate vessel . The aim study evaluate combination nab-paclitaxel plus gemcitabine induces modification vascularization pancreatic adenocarcinoma primary tumor liver metastases 2 cycle treatment comparison baseline .</brief_summary>
