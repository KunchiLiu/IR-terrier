	<brief_summary>The aim study understand healthy muscle repair response eccentric exercise evaluate functional , metabolic molecular measure . Furthermore , study aim understand repair mechanism elderly healthy muscle follow eccentric exercise evaluate measure highlight age-related difference repair mechanism may account age-related loss muscle mass . It hypothesise elderly muscle lesser/ blunt repair process compare young muscle . To meet aim study answer hypothesis , study protocol follow : Baseline functional , metabolic molecular value obtain via functional test muscle biopsy . Participants perform eccentric exercise design induce functional decline muscle soreness contralateral leg performs concentric exercise n't design induce soreness functional decline . Using time-course , various metabolic molecular measure take prior 7 day post exercise understand mechanism underlie muscle repair . In addition use novel amino acid tracer ( D2O ) allow synthesis measure duration study rather typical tracer technique capture ~12 hour synthesis .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Participation study require participant attend laboratory fast 5 occasion spread period 12 day . Participants report laboratory first visit blood sample muscle biopsy . In order measure muscle metabolism participant also consume 'heavy water ' , also require participant provide daily saliva swab . After 96 hour participant ask arrive laboratory perform bout heavy exercise one leg induce sensation muscle soreness day follow exercise . Investigators collect blood sample muscle biopsy exercise leg exercise test . After , participant perform another bout exercise leg also follow immediately blood sample , muscle biopsy exercise test . This second exercise bout design induce sensation muscle soreness . After 5 hour , exercise test perform blood sample biopsy legs collect . Approximately , 21 hour exercise ( visit 3 ) participant ask return lab short infusion ( 2.5 hour duration ) 2-deoxyglucose ( 2DOG ) , allow investigator measure glucose uptake . After infusion , blood muscle biopsy take leg follow exercise test . Participants report back laboratory exercise testing , blood sample single muscle biopsy legs 72 ( visit 4 ) 168 hour ( visit 5 ) initial exercise session .</detailed_description>
