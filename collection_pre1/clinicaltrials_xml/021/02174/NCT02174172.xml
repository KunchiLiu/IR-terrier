	<brief_summary>This global , multicenter , open-label study evaluate safety tolerability MPDL3280A combination immune-modulating therapy treatment select advanced metastatic malignancy . The MPDL3280A plus ipilimumab arm ( Arm A ) focus primarily patient advance metastatic NSCLC . The MPDL3280A plus interferon alfa-2b arm ( Arm B ) enroll patient advance metastatic RCC melanoma . MPDL3280A administer intravenously every 3 week ( q3w ) .</brief_summary>
