	<detailed_description>If participant agrees participate , investigator first test pulmonary ( lung ) function . Next , investigator test voluntary reflex cough . After first round cough testing , investigator ask participant cough long hard voluntary reflex cough testing . Finally , investigator view larynx ( voice box ) endoscopic camera insert nose . This test do see change larynx may influence cough .</detailed_description>
