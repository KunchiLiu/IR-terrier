	<brief_title>Ultrasound-Guided v Landmark Technique Femoral Arterial Cannulation Pediatric Cardiac Surgery</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The insertion percutaneous femoral catheter method choice arterial monitoring pediatric patient undergo cardiac surgery American University Beirut Medical Center . It easy access since big vessel match well aortic pressure immediately post initiation bypass radial artery . Utilizing ultrasound radial artery cannulation well describe ( 1 ) . A meta-analysis 4 trial show , ultrasound guidance radial artery catheterization improve first-pass success rate compare palpation method ( 2 ) . Two trial pediatric patient one study ultrasound-guided radial arterial cannulation 30 small child improve success rate few attempt require ultrasound technique traditional technique ( 3 ) . However , another study 152 child 12 year age require radial artery cannulation , statistically significant difference group time successful cannulation , total number attempt , number successful cannulation first attempt , number cannulae use catheterization ( 4 ) . No previous study compare use ultrasound guidance v landmark femoral artery cannulation pediatric age group particular teaching anesthesia resident . The hypothesis use ultrasound guidance senior resident learn technique femoral artery catheterization superior landmark technique . The investigator design prospective randomize trial compare use ultrasound guidance versus landmark technique 110 child undergoing cardiac surgery . The inclusion criterion ASA III IV child 12 year age . Exclusion criterion hematoma infection potential site insertion , need emergency surgery , hemodynamic instability . The risks subject include usual risk arterial cannulation ( infection hematoma formation ) . Adverse event monitor , report treated appropriately . Privacy confidentiality respect . Data keep lock primary investigator .</detailed_description>
