	<brief_summary>Some prebiotics useful improve symptom related constipation , clinical trial include infant old child scarce . A double-blind , placebo-controlled , crossover clinical trial conduct evaluate effect galactooligosaccharides ( GOS ) functional constipation child adolescent . Twenty child age 4 16 year age , spontaneously seek medical care primary healthcare unit , receive 1.7g GOS placebo ( Maltodextrin ) treatment 30 day , follow 15-day washout period 30-day use alternative product . A clinical score calculate baseline , 15th ( D15 ) 30th ( D30 ) day period , assess bowel movement frequency , straining/ pain defecation stool consistency . Oral anal transit time activate charcoal determine baseline D30 period .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>GOS Prebiotic Effect Children Constipation</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Constipation common symptom pediatric clinic . It usually define term difficulty passage faeces , faecal consistency frequency evacuation . A diet containing high amount fiber promote beneficial effect constipation therapy . Beside fiber , functional food , prebiotics , consider useful regulate bowel movement . Prebiotic define nondigestible food component affect host stimulating selectively growth potentially beneficial bacteria intestine , specially colon . Nowadays , clinical trial evaluate prebiotic use relieve constipation symptom child . This clinical trial aim evaluate effect Galactooligossacharides ( GOS ) constipate child . The trial consist 75-day period double blind intervention , control placebo cross delimitation , two sequence evaluation two treatment , placebo galactooligossacharides . It include 20 child ( 4-16 year ) functional constipation define ROMA III criterion . Children receive 6g GOS 6g Maltodextrin ( placebo ) , solution ingest 30 day , follow washout period 15 day , afterwards , 30 day GOS Maltodextrin , alternately product ingest first 30 day . The study design accord crossover delimitation ( GOS Placebo ) . Eleven patient evaluate accord sequence GOS/placebo nine patient sequence Placebo/GOS . A severity score measure beginning , 2nd 4th week experiment . Clinical score , elaborate Trial , use evaluate effect product consider : stool frequency , presence pain/discomfort/effort evacuation , consistency stool loss appetite early satiety . Scores calculate day zero ( D0 ) , 15th day ( D15 ) 30th day ( D30 ) study , phase `` crossover '' . Oroanal transit evaluation perform D0 D30 sequence , activate charcoal ingestion . Descriptive analysis trough measure position dispersion realize numerical variable . ANOVA use analysis GOS effect . The significance level assume statistical test 5 % . The GOS present significant effect compare placebo , reduce stool consistency p &lt; 0,0001 rise stool frequency , p=0,0014 . The value oroanal transit time significant low GOS period , p &lt; 0,0001 . GOS effective improvement mild constipation symptom may represent alternative option therapy condition .</detailed_description>
