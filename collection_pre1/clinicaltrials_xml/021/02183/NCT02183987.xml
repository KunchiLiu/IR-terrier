	<brief_summary>Chronic kidney disease ( CKD ) end stage kidney failure require dialysis important contributor morbidity , mortality health care cost . Over last two decade , strong secular trend earlier initiation dialysis treatment kidney failure progressive CKD . These trend occur spite evidence show harm early dialysis initiation increase health care cost . Recently , investigator Canadian Society Nephrology , include study co-investigators , propose clinical practice guideline recommend `` intent-to-defer '' approach dialysis initiation . Whether guideline require active knowledge translation strategy simply translate passive dissemination unknown . In investigator ' propose national cluster parallel group randomize clinical trial , randomize CKD clinic across Canada active knowledge translation strategy defer dialysis initiation passive dissemination guideline ( current practice ) . The unit observation patient ( i.e. , outcomes measure level individual patient ) , unit randomization level multidisciplinary CKD clinic . The investigator evaluate kidney function ( estimate glomerular filtration rate - eGFR ) dialysis initiation dialysis start originate clinic examine whether KT strategy safe effective delay dialysis initiation .

	<detailed_description>Background : End Stage Renal Disease ( ESRD ) require chronic dialysis treatment associate poor health outcome high cost . Recent data show early initiation dialysis , define start dialysis estimate glomerular filtration rate &gt; 10.5 ml/min/1.73m2 ( eGFR ; measure kidney function use practice ) , rise rapidly last two decade . In 2010 , large randomize trial publish evaluated effect early vs. late initiation , note health benefit high cost . Despite , recent national cohort study , investigator note substantial practice pattern variation time dialysis initiation Canada , note &gt; 40 % patient start dialysis `` early '' , range 10 % 57 % across region . The Canadian Society Nephrology recently release clinical practice guideline time dialysis initiation , recommend `` intent-to-defer '' `` intent-to-start early '' approach initiation chronic dialysis . Since simply release guideline ensure evidence practice gap bridge , Canadian Kidney Knowledge Translation Generation Network ( CANN-NET ) , national network clinician , researcher knowledge user , establish ensure best practice patient chronic kidney disease ( CKD ) . On behalf CANN-NET , propose cluster randomize control trial ( RCT ) knowledge translation ( KT ) strategy reduce early initiation dialysis patient severe CKD . Informed careful survey work , knowledge translation intervention consist patient- provider-directed educational tool base recent publish clinical practice guideline , include compel visual aid ( infographic whiteboard video ) , audit feedback , in-person medical detailing . The control group access publish clinical practice guideline , consistent current clinical practice . The investigator ' hypothesis specific aim follow : Hypothesis : The investigator hypothesize clinic randomize active KT strategy start great proportion patient dialysis later ( eGFR 10.5 ml/min/1.73m2 ) compare control . Aim 1 - Efficacy : To compare impact active KT intervention passive guideline release proportion patient follow Nephrologist ( &gt; 3 month ) start dialysis eGFR &gt; 10.5ml/min/1.73 m2 across randomize CKD clinic ( cluster ) Canada . Aim 2 - Safety : To compare impact active KT intervention passive guideline release safe dialysis initiation ( acute unplanned dialysis start ) across randomize CKD clinic Canada . Study Design : A cluster randomize trial CKD clinic across Canada compare efficacy safety KT intervention target early initiation dialysis patient advance CKD . The unit observation patient ( i.e. , outcomes measure level individual patient ) , unit randomization level multidisciplinary CKD clinic . Team : The investigator ' study team include expert clinical epidemiology CKD kidney failure , local opinion leader every province/region , well expert knowledge translation cluster randomize design . As , team well position carry propose study . Research Significance : Early initiation dialysis lead uncertain benefit potential harm patient CKD , increase health care cost . This topic deem high priority area knowledge translation intervention regional provincial kidney health administrator across Canada 2010 survey . If successful , investigator ' intervention reduce practice pattern variation dialysis initiation , provide successful framework future KT intervention , could significant health economic benefit .</detailed_description>
