	<brief_summary>The aim randomize control trial investigate effect add PA monitoring regular feedback pedometer ( step counter ) outpatient pulmonary rehabilitation ( PR ) program daily PA level health status patient COPD . Patients randomize either receive PR program PA monitoring regular feedback pedometer ( experimental group [ EG ] ) PR program alone ( control group [ CG ] ) . During PR program , patient EG receive pedometer self-monitor PA individualize step-count goal . They continue use pedometer receive individualize goal 3 month program . It expect , receive individualized goal simple pedometer self-monitor PA PR program , patient COPD become active adhere long-term rehabilitation , thus reduce overall impact COPD .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Home-monitoring Adherence Patients With COPD Long-term Rehabilitation</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Patients Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease ( COPD ) present low level physical activity ( PA ) , associate increase healthcare utilization reduce survival . Thus , optimize PA level become one therapeutic priority COPD management . Pulmonary rehabilitation ( PR ) effective intervention reduce symptom improve patient ' functional status quality life . However , effect increase patient ' physical activity ( PA ) level limit . Previous research suggest PR continuous PA monitoring feedback may suitable approach increase maintain patient ' PA level . Patients agree participate randomize either receive PR program PA monitoring regular feedback pedometer ( experimental group [ EG ] ) PR program alone ( control group [ CG ] ) . Both PR program last 12 week consist exercise training psychoeducation session . During PR program , patient EG receive pedometer self-monitor PA individualize step-count goal . They continue use pedometer receive individualize goal 3 month program . The impact intervention explore use mixed-methods approach . Assessments conduct group 4 time point : , immediately , 3 6 month PR program . Physical activity level , lung function , breathlessness , exercise tolerance , peripheral muscle strength , health-related quality life healthcare utilization assess group time point . Descriptive statistic use characterize sample . To analyze change outcome measure , data two group compare time point . Patients EG also invite attend focus group intervention assess perspective intervention satisfaction use pedometer . A sample size calculation use primary outcome perform base previous pilot study . It find 12 patient COPD would require group provide 80 % power ( alpha = 0.05 ) detect significant difference group . However , PR program usually considerable dropout ( around 30 % ) , 16 patient COPD recruit group .</detailed_description>
