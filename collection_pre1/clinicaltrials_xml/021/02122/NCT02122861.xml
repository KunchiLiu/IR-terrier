	<brief_summary>This Phase 1 multi-center study evaluate clinical safety immune response ID-LV305 inject intradermally patient advance cancer . ID-LV305 novel immunotherapy agent design target dendritic cell stimulate body 's immune system fight spread growth cancer patient whose tumor express NY-ESO-1 protein . Patients melanoma , sarcoma , ovarian cancer , small cell lung cancer express NY-ESO-1 may consider trial . Selected site evaluate ID-LV305 pembrolizumab patient melanoma inadequately respond anti-PD-1 therapy .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Phase 1 Study Intradermal LV305 Patients With Locally Advanced , Relapsed Metastatic Cancer Expressing NY-ESO-1</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>ID-LV305 agent design specifically target dendritic cell within patient induce stimulate generate cytotoxic T cell responses NY-ESO-1 protein , molecule often express certain type cancer cell . This first human study ID-LV305 . The primary purpose study determine dose ID-LV305 give safely patient advance cancer express NY-ESO-1 protein . ID-LV305 administered intradermal injection every three week times four dos . The study two phase . In Part 1 , Dose Escalation , complete , three sequentially enrolled cohort patient treat one four dose level ID-LV305 use standard escalation design . In Part 2 , Site-specific Amendment , patient unresectable and/or metastatic melanoma inadequate response anti-PD-1 MAb therapy , define SD PD use RECIST criterion follow least 3 month therapy . Patients PD tumor measurement increase &lt; 2-fold time start anti-PD-1 therapy , must symptomatic worsen Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group ( ECOG ) performance status due disease progression , new CNS lesion . Patients must also meet lactic acid dehydrogenase ( LDH ) , ECOG status , maximum tumor size criterion outline inclusion/exclusion criterion Appendix A .</detailed_description>
