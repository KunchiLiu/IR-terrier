	<detailed_description>This multicentre , non-interventional , prospective study carry representative hospital order ass ovarian , fallopian tube peritoneal cancer management Russia . No additional procedure besides already use routine clinical practice apply patient . Treatment assignment do accord current practice . It plan enrol 300 subject 30 site Russian Federation . The average number patient per site plan 10-15 ; restriction minimum maximum number subject per site study . The disease treatments approach 1st line treatment serous endometrioid ovarian , peritoneal fallopian tube cancer ( chemotherapy surgery ) consider primary outcome variable study . Along diagnosis examination analysis frequent mutation gen BRCA1 ( 5382insC , 4154delA , 185delAG C61G ( c.300T &gt; G ) ) perform local regional laboratory . Those patient BRCAm+ OC ( Ovarian Cancer ) observe prospectively 2 year baseline visit till progression 1st line treatment regard OC treatment detail outcomes . The patient BRCA mutation find participate baseline assessment follow . Accordingly , 1 study visit ( screening/baseline ) plan patient 2 additional year visit besides screening/baseline visit plan BRCAm+ patient . The subpopulation patient congenital serous endometrioid ovarian , peritoneal fallopian tube cancer correspond family history undergo broaden genetic testing panel ( sequence cod area gene BRCA1 BRCA2 ) . Information regard patient demographic , disease characteristic , management approach , diagnostic test perform medication receive patient take medical record .</detailed_description>
