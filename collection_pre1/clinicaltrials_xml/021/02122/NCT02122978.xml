	<brief_summary>Increasing research evidence support effectiveness mindfulness base intervention ; however , exact mechanism change poorly understood . Some evidence propose self-compassion important mechanism change effectiveness mindfulness base intervention . The current research evaluate compare effectiveness two mindfulness meditation approach ; Mindfulness Based Cognitive Therapy ( MBCT ) Mindfulness base Self-compassion Therapy ( MBSCT ) , individual psoriasis , skin condition commonly associate stress . Blood analysis conduct assess compare impact intervention immune system . Self-report questionnaire explore participant ' psychological functioning ( e.g . self-compassion , depression , anxiety , worry ) . This study also examine whether relationship exist immune function psychological factor . An audio-guided MBSCT programme pilot , view trialling cost-effective alternative traditional mindfulness intervention . Findings enable u design effective intervention future , yield clear result regard existence definite link immunological function psychological functioning . The main research hypothesis participant complete mindfulness base intervention experience significantly great psychological well-being , symptom reduction , great change telomerase cytokine activity individual receive treatment usual psoriasis .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The propose research randomize , multi-site , blind comparative study mindfulness-based cognitive therapy ( MBCT ) , Mindfulness Based Self-compassion Therapy ( MBSCT ) , minimal-contact MBSCT , treatment usual ( TAU ) patient psoriasis . Recruitment commence November 2013 continue March 2014 . Participants recruit via Department Dermatology St. Vincent 's University Hospital . During weekly dermatology clinic eligible participant identify medical member Dermatology team expression interest refer Assistant Psychologist recruitment purpose . In addition participant also recruit via advertisement place national newspaper . Eligible patient randomly assign TAU ( n=25 ) , MBCT ( n=25 ) , MBSCT ( n=25 ) , audio-guided MBSCT ( n=25 ) . At Time 1 ( pre intervention ) , participant require give blood ( 50ml sample , i.e. , roughly 10 teaspoon ) , complete self-report measure day begin mindfulness programme . As previously indicate cell may sensitive sudden change stress , mood time day ( Epel , 2012 ) , blood sample always take complete self-report measure relatively standardized time , e.g. , 3-5pm . Care take ensure condition relax across participant , 10 minute rest period complete questionnaire give blood enforce . Bloods keep room temperate 24 hour prepared storage 60 degree Celsius PBMC analysis conduct sample collect Time 1 ( post intervention ) . At Time 2 , six-months twelve-months follow-up , participant require give 50ml blood complete self-report measure via identical protocol , analysis conduct accordingly . Telomerase assess use TRAPeze EXCEL Telomerase Detection Kit . This complement flow cytometry analysis telomere length . Serum cytokines treatment examine ELISA . This give indication effect treatment systemic inflammation . We also examine ability PBMC patient produce proinflammatory cytokine , include IL-6 , TNF , IL-1 , others associate anxiety depression . PBMC activate innate stimulus LPS/zymosan . The production cytokine determine ELISA . Highly sensitive CRP also marker psoriasis assess ELISA give indication overall inflammation . In regard self-report measure , follow psychological scale use : 1 . Hospital Anxiety Depression Scale ( HADS ; Snaith &amp; Zigmond , 1994 ) 2 . Penn State Worry Questionnaire ( PSWQ : Meyer , Miller , Metzger &amp; Borkovec , 1990 ) 3 Fears Compassion Scales ( Gilbert , 2009 ) 4 . Five Facets Mindfulness Questionnaire ( FFMQ : Baer , Smith , Hopkins , Krietemeyer &amp; Toner , 2006 ) 5 . World Health Organisation Quality Life - BREF ( WHO , 2004 ) . 6 . Dermatology Quality Life Index Addressing research question regard effectiveness mindfulness program involve repeated-measures comparative group intervention design . 4x4 mixed-methods ANOVAs use assess pre , post six/twelve month follow-up difference across four experimental condition , group independent variable psychological experience ( e.g. , depression , anxiety , worry , self compassion mindfulness ) immunological activity ( e.g. , PBMC telomerase cytokine ) dependent variable . Number hour per week practice mindfulness follow-up entered covariate . Effect size confidence interval calculate post-hoc use G*Power order facilitate ease comparison study finding future study relevant field literature . Bivariate Spearman 's Correlations conduct examine relationship psychological variable telomerase cytokine activity four testing occasion , respectively . Spearman 's Correlations chosen suitable non-parametric correlation analysis give report telomerase non-normally distribute ( e.g. , Epel et al. , 2010 ; Wolkowitz et al. , 2012 ) inspection preliminary data . Data collect four occasion ; pre post intervention six twelve month follow .</detailed_description>
