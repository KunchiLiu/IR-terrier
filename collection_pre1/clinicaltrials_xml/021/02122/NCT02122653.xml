	<brief_summary>Muscle strength endurance important index fitness . The muscle strength important single predict factor functional ability age frail individual . Frailty related muscle weakness fatigue adapt pre-frail stage . Finding contribution central peripheral factor deficit muscle fitness develop effective muscle fitness train program pre-frail individual important . The muscle weakness fatigue categorize peripheral central cause . The central fatigue voluntary activation failure originate decrease motivation reduction conduction within corticospinal tract . Long term activation failure central fatigue cause disuse muscle result peripheral weakness peripheral fatigue . Studies find selective type II fiber atrophy age people find different type I atrophy conventional immobilization model . It possible activation failure lead recruitment failure high threshold type II fibers pre-frail stage . Quantifying weight central versus peripheral factor contribute exercise limitation pre-frail people important . Most conventional strength endurance training program base research young group . These program able prevent people become frail . It possibly , due limitation central fatigue , pre-frail individual stop exercise effective intensity achieve . Almost training program design enhance voluntary activation level relief central fatigue . Seeking appropriate training program enhance central activation pre-frail stage important prevent people become frail . Previous study show increase afferent input peripheral electrical stimulation ( ES ) sensory threshold enhance plasticity contralateral primary sensory cortex , excitability corticospinal tract , functional performance young adult . ES , easy quantify dose afferent input , feasible method use training . Combining afferent input strength training might able overcome central activation failure help recruit high threshold motor unit pre-frail individual .</brief_summary>
