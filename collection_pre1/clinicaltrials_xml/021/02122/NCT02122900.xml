	<brief_summary>The primary objective study determine reason balloon aortic valvuloplasty ( BAV ) current clinical setting determine outcome BAV patient aortic stenosis . The ultimate aim establish safety , effectiveness , appropriate role BAV therapy definitive therapy ( palliation ) `` bridge '' surgical aortic valve replacement ( SAVR ) transcatheter aortic valve replacement ( TAVR ) .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Prospective Balloon Aortic Valvuloplasty</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Study Objectives : 1 . To assess volume BAV procedures success procedure 'bridge ' AVR/TAVR ( percent BAV patient go receive valve replacement ) . 2 . To establish demographic profile patient BAV clear determination primary indication BAV . 3 . To collect baseline , 30-day , 3 6 month , 1 year patient data ass improvement primary cardiac condition ( AVA , EF &amp; GRAD ) primary endpoint condition symptomology accord pre-operative BAV rationale ( e.g. , renal function , chronic obstructive pulmonary disease , etc - see inclusion criterion ) . 4 . To assess patient Quality Of Life prior procedure follow-up time point 1-year post-procedure 5 . To assess patient 's Resilience baseline 30 day follow-up use Connor-Davidson 10 Resilience Scale . 6 . To assess post-operative rate stroke complication ( accord VARC2 definition ) . 7 . To identify survival relation treatment indication BAV . Background : BAV percutaneous treatment severe aortic stenosis balloon catheter inside valve . The balloon stretch valve open , effort increase open size valve improve blood flow . While procedure offer relief symptom , preferred alternative aortic valve replacement . The Cardiology/American Heart Association ( ACC/AHA ) Guidelines Valvular Heart Disease assert BAV limit serve bridge surgery compromise hemodynamic status method palliation symptom candidate AVR ( Class IIb ) . With commercial release Edwards Sapien transcatheter aortic valve system increase availability TAVR , patient previously bridge inclusion TAVR feasibility trial BAV might proceed directly TAVR . Thus important challenge well define relative role TAVR palliative BAV , especially extreme-risk patient survival benefit successful TAVR may limit due life-threatening comorbid condition . A retrospective chart review patient undergone BAV 2006 May 2013 perform . Several indication identify relation surgical intervention ( palliative therapy outset ; mean 'bridge ' patient operable status / treatment ; therapy patient consideration TAVR delay due trial constraint ; ultimate therapy patient decline treatment ) . Unfortunately , however , patient category determination make post-hoc , prove problematic properly validate . The current study propose rectify problem collect definitive diagnostic intention prior study inclusion . Methods Proposed Research : The study prospective collection patient indication , procedural , intermediate outcome patient undergo BAV . Data hospital record , 30-day , 3 month , 6 month , 1-year follow-up clinic visit subsequent clinic hospital record 1-year post-procedure collect . Study Design : With minimum enrollment 100 total patient , estimated time period study 6 month + 1 year baseline follow-up data collection ( begin 6/2013 10/2014 ) . This estimate base average monthly rate 7 BAV procedure Medical City , 10 Heart Hospital Baylor Plano . Schedule Assessments/Data Collection : Pre-procedure : Kansas City QOL Connor-Davidson 10 Resilience Scale assess pre-procedure gain consent patient prior BAV . Indication BAV obtain case report form patient . Hospitalization period : All data collect exist medical record hospitalization BAV procedure discharge , well inpatient hospital visit follow BAV 1 year follow-up . 30 day , 3 month , 6 month 1 year clinic follow-up : Clinic follow-up re-assess parameter cardiac function , well pulmonary , and/or renal function deem necessary evaluation procedural `` success '' base pre-BAV indicator . Telephone follow-up perform patient fail appear clinic visit . QOL patient consent QOL assessment obtain time point . The Connor-Davison 10 Resilience Scale collect 30 day follow-up visit . Statistical &amp; Analytical Methods : The endpoint variables procedural mortality , survival post intervention major adverse event ( follow clinical endpoint query per VARC2 recommendation : mortality , stroke , myocardial infarction , bleed complication , acute kidney injury , vascular complication , conduction disturbance arrhythmias , relevant complication previously categorize ) . Indication BAV primary plan comparison , additional analysis plan demographic factor ( age , gender , race/ethnicity , height , weight , BMI , body surface area ( BSA ) . Changes cardiac function ( output l/min , ejection fraction , aortic peak velocity m/s , aortic valve area cm2 , aortic valve gradient mmHg ) compare patient echocardiography . Definition success also assess change renal function ( lab creatinine value ) , pulmonary ( Fev1/DLCO ) value , pre-post score QOL resilience scale change . Procedural variable include balloon specification , number balloon use patient , number time balloon dilate , complication . The latter distinguished procedural post procedural adverse event . The result show mean standard deviation , proportion patient total number BAV . The cardiac catheter lab parameter BAV procedure contrast use student 's paired tail T-Tests . A p value le 0.05 consider significant . Categorical variable compare use chi- square test . The association risk factor outcome interest test Cox proportional hazard model . In addition Kaplan-Meier survival curve use determine time BAV procedural death overall survival differentiate type BAV indication . Data Monitoring : All data review Data Advisory Group completeness accuracy .</detailed_description>
