	<brief_summary>Background : - Restricting calorie help person reduce risk factor heart disease . Researchers find eat drink anything water 24 hour prevents activation component immune system , call inflammasome . The inflammasome associate development diabetes heart disease . Researchers want learn body response fasting . Objective : - To explore benefit calorie restriction heart health . Eligibility : - Healthy adult age 21 32 body mass index 26 29 . Design : - Participants screen medical history , physical exam blood test . - Participants eat drink 10 p.m. first visit . - Participants breakfast clinic . The breakfast 500 calorie . Then eat drink ( except water ) 24 hour . - Participants return clinic next morning . They blood drawn . Then breakfast . Blood drawn 1 hour 3 hour meal . - Blood urine test end fast following meal do confirm participant fast full 24-hour period .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>A caloric restrict diet numerous health effect include reduction numerous cardiovascular disease risk factor . The cellular program activate caloric restriction similarly turn preclinical study response 24-hour fast . We find beneficial effect 24-hour fasting blunts activation component immune system , term inflammasome , associate development diabetes atherosclerosis . We would like study inflammasome human blood cell evaluate whether beneficial immune effect fasting/caloric restriction operational human . Blood sample test immune response collect subject fix caloric meal response 24-hour fast ( water intake restrict ) . The objective pilot study identify immune adaptive pathway activate human subject possible readout test whether pathway could investigate therapeutic target blunt/negate inflammation associate nutrient-excess associate disease diabetes and/or atherosclerosis .</detailed_description>
