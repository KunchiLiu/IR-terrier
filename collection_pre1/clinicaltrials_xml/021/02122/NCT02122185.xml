	<brief_summary>This randomized phase II trial study well metformin hydrochloride combination chemotherapy work treat patient stage III-IV ovarian , fallopian tube , primary peritoneal cancer . Drugs use chemotherapy , carboplatin , paclitaxel docetaxel , work different way stop growth tumor cell , either kill cell , stop dividing , stop spread . Metformin hydrochloride may help carboplatin , paclitaxel docetaxel work well make tumor cell sensitive drug . Studying sample blood tissue laboratory patient receive metformin hydrochloride may help doctor learn effect metformin hydrochloride cell . It may also help doctor understand well patient respond treatment . Giving metformin hydrochloride together combination chemotherapy may kill tumor cell .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Metformin Hydrochloride Combination Chemotherapy Treating Patients With Stage III-IV Ovarian , Fallopian Tube , Primary Peritoneal Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To determine addition metformin standard adjuvant neoadjuvant chemotherapy plus extended metformin ( metformin hydrochloride ) beyond standard chemotherapy increase progression free survival compare 6 cycle standard chemotherapy alone non-diabetic subject stage III ( gross residual disease ) stage IV ovarian , primary peritoneal , fallopian tube carcinoma . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . To determine whether addition metformin standard chemotherapy plus extended metformin beyond standard chemotherapy increase time biochemical progression compare chemotherapy alone . II . To compare biochemical ( cancer antigen [ CA ] -125 ) response rate two arm . III . To describe compare toxicity two arm . IV . To compare overall survival arm . TERTIARY OBJECTIVES : I . To elucidate metformin 's molecular mechanism action ovarian , fallopian tube primary peritoneal cancer : determine whether metformin 's anti-cancer effect mediate systemic metabolic change , direct effect tumor cell , , test metabolic proteomic alteration induce biospecimens non-diabetic patient prospectively treated standard chemotherapy conjunction metformin compare placebo . OUTLINE : Patients receive standard chemotherapy regimen discretion treat physician . Regimens include either paclitaxel intravenously ( IV ) 2-3 hour carboplatin IV 30-60 minute day 1 ; docetaxel IV 1 hour carboplatin IV 30-60 minute day 1 ; paclitaxel IV 1 hour day 1 , 8 , 15 , carboplatin IV 30-60 minute day 1 . Treatment repeat every 21 day 6 course . Patients randomize 1 2 treatment arm . ARM I : Patients receive metformin hydrochloride orally ( PO ) twice daily ( BID ) standard chemotherapy regimen 6 course . Treatment metformin hydrochloride continue 2 year absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . ARM II : Patients receive placebo PO BID standard chemotherapy regimen 6 course . Treatment placebo continue 2 year absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . After completion study treatment , patient follow 2 year .</detailed_description>
