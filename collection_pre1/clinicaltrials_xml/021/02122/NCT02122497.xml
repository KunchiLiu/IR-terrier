	<brief_summary>The aim present study evaluation cardiovascular biomarkers patient abdominal aortic aneurysm ( AAA ) abdominal aortic occlusive disease AOD ) undergo open ( OR ) endovascular aortic repair ( EVAR ) regard short- long-term outcome . By blood collection measurement serum biomarkers Copeptin , N-terminal- pro Brain Natriuretic Peptide ( NT-proBNP ) , cardiac Troponin I ( cTnI ) , high sensitive Troponin T ( hs-cTnT ) C-reactive Protein ( CRP ) expect improvement patient stratification assessment cardiac stress tolerance . Data gather may help simplify decision whether open endovascular approach abdominal aortic repair ( OR EVAR ) perform . Study Hypothesis : The evaluation predictive value cardiovascular biomarkers ( Copeptin , NT-proBNP , hsTnT , cTnI , CRP ) improve patient stratification selection surgical treatment .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Background : The prevalence coronary artery disease ( CAD ) patient aneurysmal occlusive disease aorta high : 50 percent patient suffer peripheral arterial occlusive disease ( PAOD ) abdominal aortic aneurysm ( AAA ) also coronary artery disease . As result , cardiovascular disease lead cause morbidity mortality patient undergoing aortic surgery . Identifying patient increase risk cardiac complication follow major vascular surgery also part decision-finding process patient assign open endovascular surgery . The 30-day mortality rate elective open aneurysm repair ( OR ) estimate 4 8 % , endovascular aneurysm repair ( EVAR ) perioperative risk 1.2 1.6 % . However , early survival advantage patient undergo EVAR disappears time all-cause mortality similar EVAR open repair late follow-up . Patients treat EVAR show high number complication reinterventions , significant proportion late death EVAR due aneurysm rupture . Therefore , patient need abdominal aortic surgery require undergo thorough medical examination , one hand ass cardiac capacity , hand estimate life expectancy . Current recommendation preoperative management patient undergo major non-cardiac vascular surgery include physical examination routine performance electrocardiogram echocardiogram part cardiovascular evaluation . However , guideline include routine screening cardiac enzyme cardiac stress marker . Biomarkers : Brain natriuretic peptide ( BNP ) inactive precursor N-terminal prohormone brain natriuretic peptide ( NT-proBNP ) valuable screening tool identify patient may suffer heart failure . NT-proBNP play important role heart remodel volume homeostasis . It important indicator prognosis heart failure acute myocardial infarction . Elevated pre- postoperative plasma NT-proBNP level independently predict postoperative myocardial injury , associated adverse outcome short- long-term regardless presence symptom acute coronary syndrome . Copeptin novel marker allow highly sensitive unspecific assessment stress . Copeptin C-terminal fragment provasopressin , precursor peptide vasopressin ( antidiuretic hormone ) . Vasopressin release neurohypophysis order promote water absorption vasoconstriction , thereby contribute osmotic cardiovascular homeostasis . Due fact Vasopressin unstable peripheral circulation , stable Copeptin , release equimolar amount , measure instead Vasopressin . Recent study show peptide may also apply assessment risk morbidity mortality : increase copeptin level associate poor short- long- term prognosis myocardial infarction stroke . Troponins widely use biomarkers diagnosis management acute myocardial infarction acute coronary syndrome . Troponin essential protein muscle cell . Thus , damage heart muscle , coronary vasospasm , cardiomyopathy , heart failure myocarditis , indicate elevate serum level cardiac troponin . The common cause raise troponins myocardial ischemia result acute coronary syndrome myocardial infarction . In patient undergo major vascular surgery even early small postoperative rise troponin show correlate adverse short- medium-term outcome . C-reactive protein ( CRP ) , acute-phase protein , sensitive marker inflammation tissue damage . Elevated CRP level able predict future atherothrombotic event , stroke , coronary event progression peripheral arterial disease . Furthermore , inflammation crucially involved atherosclerosis plaque development . Material Methods : Study Design Prospective , non-randomized , open-labeled , observational study Patient Population : 500 patient Department Vascular Endovascular Surgery Wilhelminenhospital ( Vienna ) . Preoperative evaluation include electrocardiography , echocardiography internal medical examination . Comorbidities , history cardiac event , previous operation , routine laboratory test current medication document . Blood Sampling Laboratory Measurements : Blood sample obtain venipuncture collect standard serum EDTA tube preoperatively , 48 hour postoperatively , ten day six week surgery , centrifuge 20 minute 2000 G plasma store aliquot minus 80 degree Celsius determination respective biomarkers . Surgical procedure : Surgery standardize perform endovascular aortic repair ( EVAR ) open surgical procedure ( OR ) . OR perform general anesthesia via transabdominal retroperitoneal approach allow repair aneurysmal stenosed aorta tube- bifurcate graft . In contrast , groin access EVAR achieve local anesthesia . Statistical Analysis : The study cohort consist three study group : patient AAA undergoing EVAR , patient AAA undergoing OR patient suffer AOD undergo open surgical repair . All patient observe complete follow-up ( plasma sample 0 , 2 day , 10 day , 6 week annual outpatient checkup thereafter ) primary fatal outcome event . The statistical distribution serum level respective biomarkers assess histogram . The skewed distribution prompt non-parametric test ( Mann-Whitney-U ) comparison median ( gender status survival ) . The effect biomarkers 5-year postoperative survival ( primary endpoint ) estimate uni- multivariate proportional hazard model ( Cox Regression ) establishment prognostic model . In order adjust confounders , latter include classic cardiovascular risk factor ( age , hypertension , nicotine abuse , diabetes mellitus , history cardiac event , high lipoprotein ) , document preoperatively enter covariates . Survival estimate stratify three study group show Kaplan Meier Curves ( log-rank test ) . A two-sided p-value ( P ) less 0.05 consider indicate statistical significance . Hosmer Lemeshow test perform test adequacy regression model ( P &gt; 0.05 ) . Tests proportional hazard assumption perform linear regression partial residual ( Schoenfeld ) variable 5-year survival time . Cox proportional hazard model present hazard ratio ( HR ) 95 % confidence interval ( CI ) . All statistical analysis perform use SPSS 20 ( IBM Inc. , Somers , NY 10589 , USA . ) .</detailed_description>
