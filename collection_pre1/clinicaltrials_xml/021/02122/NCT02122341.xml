	<brief_title>Clinical Evaluation BackStop Patients Undergoing Ureteroscopic Lithotripsy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>During ureteroscopic treatment ureteral stone , lithotripsy , irrigation , manipulation stone often push stone away kidney . This phenomenon call retropulsion , define clinically significant retrograde migration stone stone fragment . Movement stone retrograde renal pelvis could potentially add complicate surgery . Often scopes need change order reach stone , chase stone add time surgery require valuable resource . Furthermore , sometimes second operation need do retropulsed fragment could find clean . A number device develop prevent migration include stone basket conical device . These wire-based device potential injuring ureter . Because safety concern limit data available effectiveness device ; widely use urologist . BackStop recently develop another tool prevent retropulsion . It water soluble gel inject proximal stone . This create physical barrier prevents stone migration ureteroscopic lithotripsy ureteral calculus .</detailed_description>
