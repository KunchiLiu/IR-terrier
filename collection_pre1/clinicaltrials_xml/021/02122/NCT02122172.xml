	<brief_summary>This phase II trial study well afatinib dimaleate work treat patient urothelial cancer remove surgically grow treatment standard first-line chemotherapy . Afatinib dimaleate may turn function epidermal growth factor ( EGF ) human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 ( HER2 ) receptor , may slow growth cancer cell cause cell die .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To determine 3-month progression free survival ( PFS ) rate metastatic urothelial cancer patient receive afatinib ( afatinib dimaleate ) progress despite prior platinum-based chemotherapy . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . To determine overall response rate ( complete response [ CR ] + partial response [ PR ] ) , median progression free survival , overall survival treat population . II . To determine whether tumor epidermal growth factor receptor ( EGFR ) and/or HER2 overexpression influence 3-month PFS patient treat afatinib . OUTLINE : Patients receive afatinib dimaleate orally ( PO ) daily ( QD ) day 1-42 . Courses repeat every 6 week absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . After completion study treatment , patient follow every 3 month .</detailed_description>
