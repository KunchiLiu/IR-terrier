	<brief_summary>LUNG ULTRASOUND IN THE MANAGEMENT OF DISPNEIC PATIENTS IN EMERGENCY DEPARTMENT Introduction This prospective randomize trial realize Emergency Department University Hospital Siena , Italy . Dyspnea one common cause worldwide admission Emergency Department ( ED ) acute heart failure ( AHF ) major cause serious morbidity death population , elderly patient . Incidence rate signiﬁcantly high men woman , Europe increase age 1.4/1000 person-years subject age 55-59 year 47.4/1000 person-years age 90 year old . The age-adjusted prevalence AHF United States average 36 case per 100,000 population account 10,000 death annually . In clinical practice symptomatology usually investigate pre-hospital phase history physical examination ; ED blood gas analysis ( BGA ) , laboratory test chest X-rays perform primary exam . BNP NT pro-BNP consider reliable biochemical marker distinguish cardiogenic pulmonary etiology , diagnostic prognostic value . On hand , biomarkers affect `` grey zone '' uncertainty , available hospital dosage sample expensive : thus propose tool support diagnostic process .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>THE RATIONALE OF THE STUDY It widely report literature ultrasound identify presence interstitial pulmonary alveolar syndrome comet tail artifact good sensitivity specificity . This easy technique perform interpret , readily available repeatable time executable bedside even emergency situation . The execution investigative technique ED also pre-hospital set would provide additional reliable information patient dyspnea , favor rapid identification etiology . Accepting observation , lung ultrasound ( LUS ) could central role evaluation patient shortness breath ED . Even LUS many study consider useful detect pulmonary alteration , data regard utilization clinical practice lack evidence concern validate operative protocol . On basis , decide evaluate employment LUS ED structure practical protocol . ETHICAL ASPECTS This study conduct accord Helsinki Declaration twill approve Local Ethics Committee . AIMS OF THE STUDY The main aim study analyze lung ultrasound ( LUS ) could useful tool early identification heart failure patient present ED dyspnea . The secondary objective identify protocol model management acute dyspnea basis lung ultrasound pattern add validate diagnostic tool . INCLUSIONS CRITERIA All patient admit Emergency Department January 2011 February 2013 acute non-traumatic dyspnea . We include patient carry ambulance patient come autonomously . EXCLUSIONS CRITERIA Age &lt; 18 year Post-traumatic dyspnea METHODS After triage , standardize diagnostic work-up include : 1 ) brief patient history ( age , gender , symptom , medical history ) ; 2 ) Vital Parameters ( Blood Pressure , Heart Rate , Arterial Oxygen Saturation , Respiratory Rate , Body Temperature ) ; 3 ) 12 lead EKG ; 4 ) Standard laboratory assessment ( NT-proBNP - ECLIA , Roche Methodics® , Creatinine , BUN , C-Reactive Protein , Full Blood Count , Electrolytes ) ; 5 ) Blood Gas Analysis . Data collect stored database . An independent operator perform LUS right admission ( unaware patient history vitals ) , attend physician acquire full medical history , Physical Examination ( accord Boston Criteria Heart Failure ) request Chest X-Ray . Echocardiography perform order validate heart failure diagnosis even consider protocol available 24h/day Emergency Department . All LUS operator emergency physician trained LUS . Lung Ultrasound We use Esaote MyLab30™ MyLab70™ Ultrasound Variable-Band Convex Array ( 3,5-5 MHz ) . Six transversal scan hemithorax ( second fourth intercostal space hemiclavear line , anterior axillar line , middle axillar line , see Figure 1 ) . Basal scan lung sample order identify pleural effusion . We choose anterior approach difficulty relate complete evaluation chest case severe dyspnea non-collaborative patient . B-lines define vertical , hyperechogenic , reverberation artifact arise pleural line bottom screen move synchronously lung sliding ; positive region define presence three B-lines longitudinal plane two rib . Acute interstitial pulmonary syndrome define , accord International Consensus Conference LUS , presence two positive region hemithorax . Diagnostic Outcome ( Reference Standard ) Since uniform reference test lack acute heart failure , chose use consensus diagnosis formal reference standard , analogy earlier study recommend recent diagnostic research guideline . An independent panel expert ( make two cardiologist one senior emergency physician ) judge collect data patient determine final diagnosis . The panel expert assess acute heart failure diagnosis follow criterion approach outline ESC Heart Failure Guidelines . LENGHT OF THE STUDY From January 2011 February 2013 DATA COLLECTION Data collection form include : Personal data Medical hystory VItals sign ; ECG ; BGA ; Medical Examination ; Standard Blood Test plus NT pro-BNP ; Chest X-ray ; Echocardiography ; Lung Ultrasound STATISTICAL ANALYSIS Edited Prof. Cevenini .</detailed_description>
