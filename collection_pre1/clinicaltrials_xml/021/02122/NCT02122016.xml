	<brief_summary>Mechanical ventilation widely use ICU patient lifesaving procedure . However , associate several complication , ventilator-associated pneumonia increase hospital morbidity mortality . To avoid complication , need wean patient ventilator soon possible . This must however do right time avoid complication , need re-intubation . For reason , important specific wean protocol , reduce time mechanical ventilation , avoid need re-intubation complication . Recently , argument develop wean protocol would appropriate , whether computer drive wean protocol could better result conventional weaning protocol focus daily screen daily interruption sedation follow spontaneous breathe test . Our objective compare mechanical ventilation time , wean success 48 hour extubation , re-intubation rate group computer drive wean protocol ( SmartCare ) versus wean protocol daily wean screen spontaneous breathe trial ICU patient ventilate 24 hour .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Comparison Two Different Types Mechanical Ventilation Weaning Patients ICU</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Background : Mechanical ventilation ( MV ) wean commonly perform use Spontaneous Breathing Trials ( SBT ) pressure support ventilation daily wean screen [ 1 ] . Recently increase interest automatic weaning trial , consist closed-loop ventilation , use ETCO2 monitoring SBT [ 1 , 2 ] . So far , clinical evidence compare automatic weaning trial SBT . Objective : To compare MV wean time Automatic Weaning Ventilation System ( SmartCare/PS ) SBT group . Methods : A randomized , control study perform general ICU . Adult patient enrol ventilated 24 hour . Tracheostomies patient , neurological condition , Glasgow coma scale low 10 exclude . Patients randomize either control Smart Care group . All patient ventilate Drager Evita XL ( Drager Medical , Lubeck , Germany ) ventilator SmartCare/PS software version 1.1 available use immediately prior randomization . The Control group consist daily wean screen SBT pressure support ventilation . If patient tolerate SBT , extubated . Smart Care group patient also submit daily wean screen , ventilate SmartCare/PS mode . MV weaning time , maximum inspiratory pressure ( MIP ) , maximum expiratory pressure ( MEP ) , vital capacity ( VC ) , respiratory frequency tidal volume ration ( f/Vt ) , use non-invasive ventilation ( NIV ) post extubation , re-intubation rate evaluate .</detailed_description>
