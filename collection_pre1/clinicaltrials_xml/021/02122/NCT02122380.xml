	<brief_summary>Adults abdominal obesity high risk cardiovascular disease also exhibit diminished growth hormone ( GH ) secretion ; latter contributes development visceral adiposity , impaired fibrinolysis inflammation.Growth hormone release hormone ( GHRH ) , primary stimulus endogenous GH secretion , substrate dipeptidyl peptidase 4 ( DPP4 ) ; inhibition DPP4 currently available anti-diabetic therapy , sitagliptin , may therefore increase GH secretion decrease degradation GHRH . The propose research test hypothesis chronic sitagliptin therapy enhance GH secretion vascular function improve glucose tolerance patient impaired GH secretion risk development diabetes mellitus cardiovascular disease , specifically obese woman polycystic ovary syndrome .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>The Effect Dipeptidyl Peptidase 4 Inhibition Growth Hormone Secretion Women With Polycystic Ovarian Syndrome</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Thirty-four obese ( BMI ≥ 30 kg/m2 ) female ( 18-40 year old ) PCOS participate randomize , double-blind , placebo-controlled crossover study . The use oral contraceptive metformin discontinue least 30 day prior . In female experience monthly cycle , outpatient visit take place mid-luteal phase participant 's menstrual cycle inpatient visit take place late follicular phase . Subjects randomized treatment order ( sitagliptin 100 mg daily v placebo ) use block randomization algorithm block size two . The dose sitagliptin choose currently FDA-recommended dose sitagliptin type 2 diabetic patient unimpaired renal function . Subjects receive standardize dietary counseling throughout study ; visit standardize menstrual cycle possible . Subjects take therapy one month ; minimum one month wash-out separate study treatment . Side effect compliance study medication assess visit CRC . Each subject undergo one outpatient visit one inpatient visit treatment . On study day , subject report fast CRC morning abstain exercise morning . On study day , subject receive intravenous catheter . Subjects undergo oral glucose tolerance test ( OGTT ) outpatient study visit . During inpatient study visit , endothelium-dependent -independent vasodilation assess use flow-mediated dilation technique ultrasound . Standardized meal provide lunch dinner . Body composition determine afternoon . At 8 PM overnight frequent sample venous GH begin every 10 minute 12 hour determine overnight GH secretion .</detailed_description>
