	<brief_summary>The investigator previous research suggest lipid ( fatty ) composition muscle cell mice play key role insulin sensitivity . The purpose study determine whether specific fat signature translate human compare muscle healthy patient pre-diabetes , `` metabolic syndrome '' .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The Comp-SR study explore role lipid metabolism key metabolic pathway skeletal muscle . It translation previous research do mouse study effect function certain key enzyme involve lipid metabolism find associated insulin resistance . These enzyme fatty acid synthase ( FAS ) , choline/ethanolamine phosphotransferase 1 ( CEPT1 ) sarcoplasmic-endoplasmic reticulum ATPase ( SERCA ) . Based investigator research , appear activity function enzymes determines ratio certain phospholipid sarcoplasmic reticulum ( SR ) , namely phosphatidylethanolamine ( PE ) phosphatidylcholine ( PC ) . Furthermore , investigator find ratio phospholipid correlate mouse 's sensitivity insulin . Based muscle biopsy four healthy person , find human muscle contains similar phospholipid phospholipid ratio mouse . It hypothesize phospholipid signature may predictive metabolic status human well . The specific aim study determine composition function sarcoplasmic reticulum alter person metabolic syndrome compare lean control . This knowledge could provide new understanding impediment effective therapy , novel biomarkers disease progression , innovative treatment target diabetes .</detailed_description>
