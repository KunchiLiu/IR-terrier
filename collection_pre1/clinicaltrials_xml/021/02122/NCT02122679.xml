	<brief_summary>Tranexamic acid relatively safe medicine use help body develop clot slow bleed large surgery . While already show work well adult old child , information whether work , work child young 6 month old . The goal study try understand whether tranexamic acid work child young 6 month old open heart surgery . We plan study tranexamic acid test effect compare placebo . The investigator use method call randomization - mean patient agree study enter computer . The computer randomly assign either receive medicine placebo . We compare effect 2 group patient . Our goal 50 patient group , 100 patient total . We know whether patient receive tranexamic acid placebo review data collect end study . Tranexamic acid usually give patient operate room open heart surgery . During open heart surgery patient require cardio-pulmonary bypass machine replaces function heart lung short period time . This allow surgeon surgery heart without worry move operation . The bypass machine lot tube carry blood around . When blood come contact tube tendency clot . To prevent patient give blood thinner call heparin . Although heparin prevents clot bypass machine , also increase risk bleed surgery . To reduce risk patient give another medicine completion surgery call protamine try reverse effect blood thinner , heparin . Even bleed remain significant problem , especially baby open heart surgery . Being bypass machine lot suture ( stitch ) line increase risk . In addition , bypass machine affect function platelet , main component body 's clotting system . We often replenish blood product surgery try stop bleeding . Some center , include , use medicine tranexamic acid try help bleed surgery . There study show help fibrinolysis , another important part body 's clotting system . However , part clot system well developed infant therefore likely play important role prevent bleed age group . As , may tranexamic acid impact platelet function well , effect help decrease post-operative bleeding infant young 6 month . This previously study . In order study effect tranexamic acid platelet investigator propose investigator ' research trial . The investigator plan randomize patient either receive tranexamic acid placebo operate room described . The investigator draw small amount blood patient ( total approximately 1 tablespoon ) send special lab test platelet function . The lab test help u understand whether platelet function good patient receive tranexamic acid instead placebo . The investigator also monitor outcomes related platelet function . These include much bleeding patient surgery intensive care unit , much blood product require treat bleeding . The investigator also monitor labs check routinely patient open heart surgery . The investigator also track long take patient get ventilator long spend ICU surgery . All data help u understand whether tranexamic acid make positive impact outcome open heart surgery infant less 6 month old . The current standard care quite variable within institution well institution . Some anesthesiologist use tranexamic acid others elect . There definitive guideline current use . The dose differs center center , center use . The investigator ' hope result study help u understand role tranexamic acid play preserve function platelet open heart surgery young infant , whether impact translates improve outcomes patient . Based result research hope develop definitive guideline use tranexamic acid population infant &lt; 6 month old undergoing open heart surgery .</brief_summary>
