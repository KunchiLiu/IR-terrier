	<brief_summary>The ability sperm swim important normal fertility . Men genetic variation gene cod Choline Dehydrogenase ( CHDH ) decrease energy production sperm , sperm swim normally . The metabolic product gene nutrient call betaine ( find normally diet part many food spinach , beet grain product ) . This study test whether treatment betaine safe whether normalize energy production sperm men restore normal swimming ability .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Choline Dehydrogenase Sperm Function : Effects Betaine</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Unidentified genetic aberration single nucleotide polymorphism ( SNPs ) may underlie cause many case idiopathic infertility men . Choline dehydrogenase ( encoded CHDH ) convert choline betaine mitochondrion . 5-9 % men 2 allele functional SNP CHDH ( rs12676 ) , low sperm adenosine triphosphate ( ATP ) concentration impaired sperm motility ( asthenospermia ) decrease fertility . Male mouse CHDH delete also low sperm ATP , asthenospermia infertile . Supplementation mouse dietary betaine increase sperm motility ATP concentration . This purpose study conduct phase I study betaine treatment men 2 minor allele CHDH rs12676 determine whether betaine supplementation safe obtain preliminary data effect betaine sperm mitochondrial ATP concentration sperm motility men .</detailed_description>
