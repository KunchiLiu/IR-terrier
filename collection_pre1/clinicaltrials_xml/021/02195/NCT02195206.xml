	<brief_summary>In pilot study , MRI lungs healthy adult volunteer perform 1.5 Tesla ass image quality use prototype chest coil pulse sequence follow inhalation hyperpolarized 129Xe ( xenon ) gas . This study take place Hospital Sick Children , Toronto , Canada . Twenty subject age 18 75 participate study . Xenon MRI non-invasive imaging technique involve X-rays ionize radiation . Rather , image method utilizes hardware software principle use conventional proton MRI patient hospital . The investigator test ability xenon MRI see produce lung image equal good quality proton MRI . The investigator hypothesize get good quality image lungs analysis use method .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Hyperpolarized Xenon-129 Lung Magnetic Resonance Imaging : Healthy Adult Volunteer Pilot Study</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>With emergence novel hardware software image acquisition improvement , magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) potential become important tool assess lung structure function . In particular , use hyperpolarized noble gas 129Xe use explore structural functional relationship lung healthy subject patient lung disease ( 1,2 ) . In contrast proton-based MRI imaging , 129Xe gas use `` contrast agent '' directly visualize airway , thus image ventilation . Whereas normal density gas low produce easily detectable signal , overcome artificially increase amount polarization per unit volume use optical pumping ( 3 ) . Hyperpolarized noble gas MR lung image relatively new image method allow depiction lung function morphology [ 4-9 ] . Hyperpolarized gas new class MR contrast agent , inhale , provide high temporal spatial resolution MR image lung airspace . Since ionize radiation involve , hyperpolarized gas MR image ideal evaluation lung disease . With hyperpolarized gas , nuclear spin gas atom bring alignment outside MR scanner via process call optical pumping ; yield high polarization permit visualization lung airspace MR imaging ( despite low physical density gas lung ) . Two non-radioactive ( i.e . stable ) isotopes noble gas 3He 129Xe hyperpolarized . Until recently , high polarization could achieve 3He 129Xe , human , 3He commonly use hyperpolarized gas MR imaging lung [ 10-15 ] . Recently , technology develop provide large quantity highly polarize 129Xe [ 16 ] . Several application 129Xe MRI imaging development , include diffusion-weighted relaxation-weighted imaging ( 17-19 ) . These technique take advantage fact rate loss 129Xe polarization significantly influence local blood flow concentration molecular oxygen , well restriction 129Xe diffusion small airway space dimension . These data use create map lung reflect regional ventilation/perfusion micro-airway size . Other data obtain 129Xe MRI include volume ventilate unventilated lung subsequently analyze determine homogeneity gas distribution within airspace ( 17 ) . Objectives study : - To quantitatively evaluate 1.5T 129Xe chest coil image quality coil comfort/performance . - To determine range possible novel pulse sequence combination coil inhalation 129Xe gas healthy volunteer .</detailed_description>
