	<brief_summary>To date , method reliably select patient non-squamous non-small cell lung cancer ( NSCLC ) benefit treatment bevacizumab . Data show high level plasma VEGF prognostic correlate bad disease outcome tumour type , include advanced NSCLC . Recent data suggestive predictive value image technique early detection antiangiogenic treatment efficacy different cancer . To knowledge present data available correlation change diffusion-weighted MR response bevacizumab treatment lung cancer . The current study design pilot study prospectively investigate change MR variable treatment bevacizumab detect signal prognostic and/or predictive value MR change treatment .</brief_summary>
