	<brief_title>Cardiac MRI After Pacemaker Replacement</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The trial design 1 . To investigate cardiac MRI related adverse event-free rate patient long term implant coradial pacing lead ( Fineline-II ) implantable pulse generator ( IPG ) exchange MRI conditional system ( short term long term ) : Safety . 2 . To assess technical performance MRI conditional pacemaker system long term implant coradial pacing lead , cardiac MRI ( short term long term ) : Effectiveness pacemaker . 3 . To assess image quality ( IQ ) diagnostic value ( DV ) cardiac MRI scan patient implanted MRI conditional system : Effectiveness cardiac MRI . 2 ) To evaluate clinical incidence MRI procedures population long term implant pacemaker patient ( long term-follow )</detailed_description>
