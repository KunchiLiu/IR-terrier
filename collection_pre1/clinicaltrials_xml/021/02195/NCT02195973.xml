	<brief_summary>The purpose study find new drug , LDE225 , safe beneficial effect combine paclitaxel woman platinum resistant ovarian cancer . Platinum resistant ovarian cancer refers recurrent ovarian cancer undergone chemotherapy inclusive platinum compound ( e.g . carboplatin cisplatin ) .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Phase IB Trial LDE225 Paclitaxel Recurrent Ovarian Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Ovarian cancer remain deadly gynecologic cancer fairly low long-term cure rate . LDE225 new type drug inhibits block pathway responsible cancer cell growth . LDE225 investigational drug use either solely combination chemotherapy type cancer ovarian cancer . Research evidence suggest combine LDE225 paclitaxel together , ovarian cancer cell may become responsive treatment .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Recurrent epithelial ovarian , fallopian tube primary peritoneal carcinoma Histologic confirmation original primary tumor require Papillary serous , endometrioid , clear cell , undifferentiated mixed histology Platinum resistant refractory disease per standard clinical Gynecologic Oncology Group definition . Patients treatmentfree interval less 6 month last platinumbased treatment recurrence progression platinum base therapy Patients must receive least oneprior platinum base chemotherapy regimen , include cisplatin , carboplatin organoplatinum compound , treatment primary recurrent ovarian , fallopian tube primary peritoneal cancer Patients must receive taxane part prior treatment Measurable disease require . By definition , measurable disease least one lesion accurately measure least one dimension long dimension record . Each lesion must ≥ 20 mm measure conventional technique , include palpation , plain xray , CT , MRI ≥ 10 mm measure spiral CT imaging Patients must one target lesion utilized order ass response per RECIST criterion ECOG Performance statuses 0 , 1 , 2 Adequate organ function evidence : 1 . Hematology : WBC ≥3.0 x 10^9/L ; ANC ≥1.5 x 10^9/L ; Platelets ≥100 x 10^9/L 2 . Renal function : Creatinine le equal 1.5 x institutional upper limit normal ( ULN ) 24hour clearance great equal 50 mL/min 3 . Hepatic function : Bilirubin ≤ 1.5 x ULN ALT , SGOT alkaline phosphatase ≤ 2.5 x ULN 4 . Plasma creatine phosphatase ( CK ) less 1.5 x ULN 5 . Serum creatinine less equal 1.5 x ULN 24hour clearance great equal 50 mL/min Signed informed consent . Female patient ethnic group . Female patient must surgically sterile , postmenopausal ( menses least one year ) , use medically approve method contraception ( exclude rhythm , withdraw abstinence ) Age great equal 19 Recovery effect recent surgery , chemotherapy and/or radiation 1 . No evidence active infection require antibiotic therapy 2 . Hormonal therapy utilized , antineoplastic treatment must discontinue least one week prior study entry . Hormonal replacement therapy symptom management allow 3 . Any prior therapy direct malignancy include biologic immunologic agent , must discontinue least three week prior study entry Patients pathology demonstrate mucinous , carcinosarcoma low malignant potential tumor histology exclude . In addition , nonovarian malignancy , malignant germ cell stromal tumor also exclude Previous concurrent malignancy sit within last 5 year , exception situ carcinoma cervix adequately treat basal cell carcinoma squamous cell carcinoma skin . In addition , patient prior concomitant , base hysterectomy , Stage IA endometrial adenocarcinoma le 3 mm depth invasion , absence lymphovascular space invasion absence grade 3 , papillary serous clear cell histology allow Patients prior radiation abdominal cavity pelvis exclude Patients unable take oral drug lack physical integrity upper gastrointestinal tract know malabsorption syndromes Patients previously treat systemic sonidegib ( LDE225 ) Hh pathway inhibitor Serious concomitant illness include limited : uncontrolled diabetes mellitus , dementia , active infection ( include HIV infection ) require IV oral antibiotic psychiatric illness and/or uncontrolled medical condition may preclude compliance study protocol Patients neuromuscular disorder ( e.g . inflammatory myopathy , muscular dystrophy , amyotrophic lateral sclerosis spinal muscular atrophy ) concomitant treatment drug recognize cause rhabdomyolysis , HMG CoA inhibitor ( statin ) , clofibrate gemfibrozil , discontinue least 2 week prior start sonidegib treatment . If essential patient remain statin control hyperlididemia , pravastatin may use extra caution Patients plan embark new strenuous exercise regimen initiation study treatment . Muscular activity , strenuous exercise , result significant increase plasma CK level avoid whilst sonidegib treatment Patients take part experimental drug study within 4 week 5 halflives , whichever longer , initiate treatment sonidegib Patients receive antineoplastic therapy ( e.g . chemotherapy , target therapy radiotherapy ) concurrently within 2 week start treatment sonidegib Peripheral Neuropathy NCICTC ( National Cancer InstituteCommon Toxicity Criteria ) grade great equal 2 Impaired cardiac function clinically significant heart disease , include one following : 1 . Angina pectoris within 3 month 2 . Acute myocardial infarction within 3 month 3 . QTcF &gt; 470 msec screen ECG 4 . A past medical history clinically significant ECG abnormality family history prolong QTinterval syndromes 5 . Other clinically significant heart disease ( e.g . congestive heart failure , uncontrolled hypertension , history labile hypertension , history poor compliance antihypertensive regimen ) Pregnant nursing ( lactate ) woman , pregnancy define state female conception termination gestation , confirm positive hCG laboratory test ( &gt; 5 mIU/mL ) Patients willing apply highly effective contraception study duration define final dose study treatment . Women childbearing potential defined woman physiologically capable become pregnant . Must use highly effective contraception study 20 month final dose study treatment . Highly effective contraception define either : 1 . Total abstinence : When line prefer usual lifestyle patient . Periodic abstinence ( e.g . calendar , ovulation , symptothermal , postovulation method ) withdrawal acceptable method contraception 2 . Sterilization : Patient surgical bilateral oophorectomy ( without hysterectomy ) tubal ligation least six week take study treatment . In case oophorectomy alone , reproductive status woman confirm follow hormone level assessment 3 . Male partner sterilization ( appropriate postvasectomy documentation absence sperm ejaculate ) . For female study patient , vasectomized male partner sole partner patient 4 . Use combination follow ( + b ) : 1 . Placement nonhormonal intrauterine device ( IUD ) non hormonal intrauterine system ( IUS ) 2 . Barrier method contraception : Condom occlusive cap ( diaphragm cervical vault cap ) spermicidal foam/gel/film/cream/vaginal suppository . Note : Hormonal contraception method ( e.g . oral , injected , implant ) allow rule study drug decrease effectiveness hormonal contraception . Note : Women consider postmenopausal child bear potential 12 month natural ( spontaneous ) amenorrhea appropriate clinical profile ( e.g . age appropriate , history vasomotor symptom ) six month spontaneous amenorrhea serum FSH level &gt; 40 mIU/mL estradiol &lt; 20 pg/mL surgical bilateral oophorectomy ( without hysterectomy ) least six week ago . In case oophorectomy alone , reproductive status woman confirm follow hormone level assessment consider child bear potential . History hypersensitivity paclitaxel Mental condition render subject unable understand nature , scope , possible consequence study Patients receive treatment medication know moderate strong inhibitor inducer CYP3A4/5 drug metabolize CYP2B6 CYP2C9 narrow therapeutic index , discontinue start treatment sonidegib . Medications strong CYP3A4/5 inhibitor discontinue least 7 day strong CYP3A/5 inducer least 2 week prior start treatment sonidegib</criteria>
