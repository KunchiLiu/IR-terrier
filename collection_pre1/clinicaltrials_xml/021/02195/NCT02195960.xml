	<detailed_description>Detailed Description 1 . Study Rationale : Attention focus recently development modality protect healthy organ harmful effect radiation apply different cancer treatment schedule . As radiation-induced DNA cellular damage involve oxidative stress , protective role antioxidant test toxic condition induce radiotherapy breast cancer treatment . Consumption polyphenol-rich food , fruit vegetable , beverage derive plant , cocoa , red wine tea , may represent beneficial diet term oxidative protection . Indeed , retrospective study report moderate wine consumption reduce side-effects radiation therapy patient breast cancer . This effect presumably due polyphenol non alcoholic fraction wine , find agreement cross-over intervention study adult male volunteer , protection de-alcoholized red wine ex vivo radiation-induced DNA damage . However , study address relationship polyphenol-rich food consumption toxic effect radiation patient undergo radiotherapy breast cancer treatment . 2 . Aim study . The main objective study evaluate association effect polyphenol-rich food supplementation toxicity radiotherapy breast cancer . 3 . Study design : Randomized , placebo-controlled double-blind trial 2 parallel arm : soluble corn flour high content anthocyanins placebo . Placebo consist soluble corn flour poor anthocyanins . The treatment start one week start radiotherapy , continue radiotherapy treatment ( 3 5 week ) . 4 . Study Population recruitment : A total 300 consecutive breast cancer patient eligible radiotherapy . Participants identify Department Radiotherapy Giovanni Paolo II Foundation Campobasso . Eligible subject recruit first consultation subsequently refer research investigator . The research staff charge recruitment pre-screen participant basis inclusion/exclusion criterion explain study time .</detailed_description>
	<criteria>1 . The patient must consent study must sign approve consent form conform institutional guideline . 2 . Patients must â‰¥ 18 year old . 3 . On histological examination , tumor must DCIS invasive carcinoma breast . 4 . Surgical treatment breast must lumpectomy quadrantectomy . The margin resect specimen must histologically free tumor ( DCIS invasive ) . Reexcision surgical margin permit . 5 . Patients invasive breast cancer require axillary stag include sentinel node biopsy alone ( sentinel node negative ) , sentinel node biopsy follow axillary dissection sample minimum total 6 axillary node ( sentinel node positive ) , axillary dissection alone ( minimum 6 axillary node ) . ( Axillary staging require patient DCIS . ) 6 . The patient must randomize within 45 day follow last surgery breast cancer ( lumpectomy , reexcision margin , axillary staging procedure ) within 30 day follow last chemotherapy cycle . 7 . Patients history nonbreast malignancy eligible diseasefree 5 year prior randomization deem physician low risk recurrence . Patients follow cancer eligible diagnose treat within past 5 year : carcinoma situ cervix , carcinoma situ colon , melanoma situ , basal cell squamous cell carcinoma skin . 1 . Axillary node definite evidence microscopic macroscopic extracapsular extension . 2 . One positive nonaxillary sentinel node ( ) . ( Note intramammary node stag axillary node . ) 3 . Palpable radiographically suspicious ipsilateral contralateral axillary , supraclavicular , infraclavicular , internal mammary node , unless histologic confirmation node negative tumor . 4 . Suspicious microcalcifications , density , palpable abnormality ( ipsilateral contralateral breast ) unless biopsied found benign . 5 . Nonepithelial breast malignancy sarcoma lymphoma . 6 . Proven multicentric carcinoma ( invasive cancer DCIS ) one quadrant separate 4 centimeter . 7 . Paget 's disease nipple . 8 . Synchronous bilateral invasive noninvasive breast cancer . 9 . Surgical margin microscopically assess positive pathologic evaluation . ( If surgical margin render free disease reexcision , patient eligible . ) 10 . Breast implant . ( Patients implant remove eligible . ) 11 . Prior breast thoracic radiation therapy condition . 12 . Collagen vascular disease , specifically dermatomyositis creatine phosphokinase level normal active skin rash , systemic lupus erythematosus , scleroderma . 13 . Pregnancy lactation time propose randomization . Women reproductive potential must agree use effective nonhormonal method contraception therapy . 14 . Psychiatric addictive disorder condition , opinion investigator , would preclude patient meeting study requirement .</criteria>
