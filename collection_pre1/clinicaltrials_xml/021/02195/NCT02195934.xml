	<brief_summary>This study aim compare effect anthocyanin-rich blood orange juice standard ( anthocyanin ) blonde orange juice marker cardiovascular disease ( CVD ) . Participants age 25 84 year age recruit single arm , two way cross-over study base waist measurement , 42 individual require complete study . Participants receive two intervention randomise order : 500mL blood orange juice daily 28 day , 500ml standard ( blonde ) orange juice daily 28 day . Prior intervention 2 week `` run period '' participant ask avoid consume food rich anthocyanins . After first 28 day intervention period , 3 week wash period participant ask drink juice 28 day . The 500 mL blood orange juice contain approximately 50mg anthocyanins , whereas standard juice contain none . Blood sample collect preparation plasma peripheral blood mononuclear cell ( PBMCs ) analysis anthocyanin metabolite concentration , transcriptomics CVD risk marker . Urine sample collect urinary excretion anthocyanin metabolite quantify . Other measurement include pulse wave analysis , pulse wave velocity , central blood pressure , waist hip circumference , blood glucose , glycated haemoglobin ( HbA1C ) insulin concentration , various measurement use TANITA machine include weight , fat mass , muscle mass , fat percentage , fat-free mass , total body water , bone mass , metabolic age , basal metabolic rate , visceral fat rating , degree obesity . All measurement sample take baseline post intervention phase study .</brief_summary>
