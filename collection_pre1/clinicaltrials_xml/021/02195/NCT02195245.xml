	<detailed_description>CO2 removal mandatory part modern anesthesia system . Current chemical absorber pose problem chemical granulate reacts CO2 also anesthetic drug , produce organ toxic substance . The propose CO2 absorber provide solution problem organ-toxin production anesthetic circuit . This new absorber easily integrated anesthesia circuit , effectively remove CO2 without react anesthetic drug , thus eliminate organ-toxic by-product . It use advanced membrane technology separate gas flow within circuit , separate expensive anesthetic vapor CO2 ( main by-product metabolism ) . Anesthetic vapor thus remain closed loop circuit , CO2 separate exhaust atmosphere , rather absorbed chemical reaction .</detailed_description>
