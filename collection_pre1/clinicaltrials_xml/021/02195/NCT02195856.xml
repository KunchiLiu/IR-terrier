	<brief_summary>Rationale : Mediterranean style diet diet rich green leafy vegetable protect risk develop type 2 diabetes wide range cardiovascular disease . These diet rich nitrate . Numerous study show nitrate diet wide range beneficial effect . These include relax blood vessel improve function . It show follow meal added nitrate , blood flow stomach increase would expect meal give without nitrate . This eat nitrate body concentrate recycles digestive system . As cycle convert nitrite nitric oxide cause blood vessel relax . The nitrite nitric oxide also seem protect infection food source E.coli . What know whether nitrite nitric oxide effect small intestine liver . Some nitrite reach small intestine may effect blood flow stomach . This could important small intestine release hormone call incretins know play important role control blood sugar every time eat . These incretin hormone regulate insulin release body 's sensitivity insulin . When eat blood contain substance absorb gut , sugar fat , go liver processing . The blood leave liver enters circulation . This mean blood supply liver much high concentration nitrite blood circulate rest body . High concentration nitrite appear cause blood vessel open . This mean blood vessel liver open nitrate rich meal . It seem likely help liver control blood sugar effectively . Purpose To find supplementation inorganic nitrate find beetroot green leafy vegetable increase liver ( hepatic ) microvascular perfusion increase incretin secretion . Plan investigation : We recruit 16 individual three group ( Young adult , old adult individual type 2 diabetes ) . Participants recruit database volunteer consent contact research study hold NIHR Exeter Clinical Research Facility . This double blind , placebo control crossover design study ( nitrate rich beetroot juice v placebo , nitrate deplete beetroot juice ) . Three visit require participant complete study . Visit 1 . Screening consent . The experimenter explain participant study design test . If participant completely clear study understand agree , sign consent form . In addition standard medical history clinical examination undertaken research nurse Anthony Shepherd . A venous blood sample take use standard aseptic procedure . Following consent participant assign study number . Study number previously assign ( research statistician ) randomisation order begin either beetroot juice placebo arm study first . Visit 2 . Visit 2 require participant fast night 10pm . Only water admissible time . The following morning participant arrive laboratory fully hydrate rested state ~ 7.30am . This visit take ~ 5 hour require 4 MRI scan . Participants first MRI scan short acclimatisation period . Participants provide concentrated 140 mL nitrate drink placebo standardise breakfast ( 2 slice toast butter ) . Three subsequent MRI scan require ( one per hour three hour ) . Venous blood sample take cannula sample , order ass glucose , insulin , incretins nitrate/nitrite prior scan . Visit 3 . Visit 3 take place minimum washout period 7 day Visit 2 . Visit 3 identical nature visit 2 ; however , opposite supplement ( either nitrate rich placebo beetroot juice ) . Impact : Dietary nitrate appear offer simple , low cost mean modify cardiovascular risk . This study deepen understanding role nitrate/nitrite/nitric oxide pathway normal physiology . By understand effect inorganic nitrate diet hepatic perfusion pathway involve glucose homeostasis may lead range simple , low cost therapeutic strategy prevent treat type 2 diabetes .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Hypothesis Inorganic nitrate diet , follow conversion nitrite nitric oxide via pathway describe : 1 . Increase hepatic microvascular perfusion 2 . Increase GLP-1 secretion 3 . Increase pancreatic insulin secretion 4 . Reduce area curve glucose post meal Purpose To find inorganic nitrate find green leafy vegetable protect risk develop type 2 diabetes cardiovascular disease increase hepatic microvascular perfusion increase incretin secretion . Aim The purpose study see inorganic nitrate diet modulate hepatic perfusion pathway involve post-prandial glucose homeostasis . MRI Hepatic micro vessel perfusion liver portal vein diameter measure Dr. Jon Fulford Peninsula Magnetic Resonance Research Centre , St Luke 's Campus . Following initial survey image obtain anatomical information apparent diffusion coefficient ( ADC ) calculate posterior right lobe liver . Diffusion image acquire single shot echo-planar imaging ( EPI ) sequence 15 direction b value 200 800 mm-2 . Images acquire single breathe-hold axial-oblique orientation repetition time ( TR ) 1500 m echo time 57 m , in-plane resolution 4 x 4 mm slice thickness 10 mm fat suppression 3 signal average . ADC give : ADC = 1/ ( b200-b800 ) Ln ( S800/S200 ) S800 signal diffusion b-value 800 mm-2 ( b800 ) S200 signal diffusion b-value 200 mm-2 ( b200 ) . Statistical analysis Statistical analysis perform experienced train researcher statistical advice available Prof. Angela Shore within team Beverly Shields NIHR Exeter Clinical Research Facility . Data assess normality . Depending normality data difference group assess either unpaired t-test Mann-Whitney test . Sample Size Sixteen participant would need recruit per group order detect 1SD difference group data 80 % power 0.05 . Twenty participant would recruit order account drop out .</detailed_description>
