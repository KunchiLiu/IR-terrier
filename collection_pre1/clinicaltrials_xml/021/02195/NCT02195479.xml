	<brief_summary>The purpose study determine addition daratumumab velcade ( bortezomib ) melphalan-prednisone ( VMP ) prolong progression-free survival ( PFS ) compare VMP alone participants previously untreated multiple myeloma ineligible high dose chemotherapy autologous stem cell transplant ( ASCT ) .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Study Combination Daratumumab Velcade ( Bortezomib ) Melphalan-Prednisone ( DVMP ) Compared Velcade Melphalan-Prednisone ( VMP ) Participants With Previously Untreated Multiple Myeloma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The study consist 3 phase : Screening Phase ( within 21 day prior randomization ) , Treatment Phase ( Cycle 1 Day 1 discontinuation study treatment ) , Follow-up Phase ( discontinuation study treatment death , lose follow , withdrawal consent , study end , whichever occur first ) . Treatment phase include 2 treatment ( Treatment A : participant receive Velcade MelphalanPrednisone ( VMP ) alone Treatment B : participant receive daratumumab combination VMP ) .Two interim analysis plan . The first evaluate safety total approximately 100 participant treat least 2 cycle discontinue study treatment . The second evaluate cumulative interim safety efficacy data , perform approximately 216 PFS event accumulate . The maximum duration study 5 year last participant randomize 330 participant die , whichever come first . Efficacy primarily measure comparison PFS two treatment arm . Participants ' safety monitor throughout study .</detailed_description>
