	<detailed_description>Preliminary study data indicate possible increased cardiovascular disease risk patient expose nicotine replacement therapy compare control ( i.e . non-nicotine replacement therapy expose patient ) magnitude could reasonably account difference cardiovascular risk profile two patient group . Further in-depth study area warrant . This retrospective study compare cardiovascular disease event risk group smoker undertake pharmacologically unaided smoking cessation attempt event rate group smoker attempt smoke cessation assist pharmacological intervention ( nicotine replacement therapy , bupropion varenicline ) representative UK primary care population . There three main type pharmacological intervention currently available smoke cessation , demonstrate efficacy use conjunction behavioural support : nicotine replacement therapy , bupropion , varenicline . Other medication , especially nortryptiline clonidine , consider effective adjunct therapy smoking cessation , remain second-line option time . Nicotine replacement therapy available since 1980s bupropion since 2000 . Either approach cessation double chance achieve abstinence compare unsupported quit attempt .

Patients must also meet follow inclusion criterion : Aged : 1875 year . Have least one year uptostandard baseline data define Clinical Practice Research Datalink ( prior index smoke cessation attempt ) least one year uptostandard outcome data ( follow index smoke cessation attempt ) uptostandard data time death death occur within outcome period . Patients exclude analysis : Have exposure nicotine replacement therapy pharmacological smoking cessation intervention baseline period ( year prior index smoke cessation attempt ) , and/or Switched type smoke cessation intervention ( i.e . nicotine replacement therapy pharmacological smoking cessation intervention vice versa ) outcome period ( ) . Switching different nicotine replacement therapy product , use multiple nicotine replacement therapy product , permissible analysis may involve comparison outcomes relative nicotine exposure various outcome period .</criteria>
