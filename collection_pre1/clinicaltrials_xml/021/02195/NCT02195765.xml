	<brief_summary>This split-mouth , double-blind randomize controlled trial . Computerized linear radiographic measurement use detect infrabony defect treat open flap debridement ( OFD ) OFD associate enamel matrix derivative ( EMD ) , 24 month . Ten patient present 2 defect select ( 43 defect ) . An individualized film holder use take standardized radiograph baseline 24 month . Images digitize used measure distance cemento-enamel junction ( CEJ ) alveolar crest ( AC ) , CEJ bottom defect ( BD ) infrabony defect angle .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>This split-mouth randomized control trial . Patients recruit among one seek periodontal treatment Post-graduate Clinic Periodontics use follow inclusion criterion : ( 1 ) diagnosis chronic periodontitis15 ; ( 2 ) presence least one pair interproximal infrabony defect ( 2-3 wall ) adjacent vital anterior premolar teeth ; ( 3 ) absence 2 3 mobility degrees16 ; ( 4 ) probe pocket depth ( PPD ) ≥ 5mm ; ( 5 ) full-mouth plaque score ≤ 20 % 17 ; ( 6 ) keratinize tissue width least 2mm . The exclusion criterion : ( 1 ) presence systemic disease could interfere periodontal treatment ; ( 2 ) infrabony defect trans-surgical depth ≤4mm ; ( 3 ) antibiotic treatment administer last 6 month . The patient participate study volunteer receive give inform consent include study June October 2002 . Following initial examination , patient underwent oral hygiene instruction full-mouth supra- sub-gingival scaling root plan local anesthesia . Patients re-evaluated completion initial therapy determine response therapy confirm need periodontal surgery . Before surgery , pair defect , one defect randomly assign test ( EMD ) one control ( OFD ) treatment toss coin . Both defect treat surgical time . When patient present one pair defect , one pair treat per day . Following local anesthesia , site treat reflection full thickness mucoperiosteal flap intra-sulcular incision . The exposed root osseous defect debrided hand instrument , surgical wound rinse saline . After , flap OFD site reposition sutured use 5-0 nylon suture . The EMD site dry non-woven gauze , root condition 24 % ethylenediaminotetracetic acid ( EDTA ) gel ( pH 6.7 ) 2 minute . The defect thoroughly rinse saline , EMD gel apply root surface accord manufacturer 's instruction . The flap replace primary closure suture 5-0 nylon suture . The suture remove 7 day . All surgery perform investigator . All patient prescribe 0.12 % chlorhexidine digluconate instruct rinse gently twice day 4 week . Analgesics prescribe take need , patient see week , 8 week , professional tooth cleaning . Subsequently , patient maintain supportive periodontal program ( ie , professional tooth clean reinforcement self-administered oral hygiene measure ) 2-month interval 6-month time every 3 month final examination 24 month . Standardized periapical radiograph take baseline evaluation , immediately surgery 24 month follow-up . Individually customize bite block employ reference occlusal stent film holder use obtain reproducible expose film radiographic control . All radiograph evaluate single calibrated examiner , blind time treatment . Analyses radiographic outcome perform use computerized linear measurement image analysis software . The radiograph previously scan digital format scanner resolution 500dpi/8bits . The radiographic analysis base anatomical landmark ( CEJ , BD AC ) identify scan radiograph . All linear measurement record blind , calibrate examiner . The following outcome measure radiographs take baseline 24 month : 1 . Distance CEJ bottom defect ( BD ) . The coronal area periodontal ligament maintain even width identify measure apical extension infrabony defect ; 2 . Distance CEJ bone crest ( BC ) ; 3 . Infrabony defect angle define two line represent root surface involve tooth ( CEJ-BD ) bone defect surface ( BD-BC ) . The distance CEJ bottom defect ( BD ) consider primary outcome . CEJ-BC defect angle secondary outcome</detailed_description>
