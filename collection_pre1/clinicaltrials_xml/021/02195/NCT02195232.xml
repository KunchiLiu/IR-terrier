	<detailed_description>- This research study Phase II/III clinical trial . -- The goal trial evaluate isoquercetin prevent blood clot patient pancreas , non small cell lung cancer colorectal cancer . In Phase II part study , investigator look dose isoquercetin reduce D-dimer demonstrate safety . - Phase III Endpoint Treatment Plan - Primary Endpoint Phase III portion protocol : Cumulative incidence VTE . - Following completion phase II portion , enrol patient randomize 1:1 Arm C ( isoquercetin ) Arm D ( placebo ) . The dose Arm C determine evaluation Phase II portion trial . The protocol amend decision make whether proceed Phase III dose use Arm C. The study double-blinded treatment arm . Lower extremity ultrasound perform 56 day . Baseline D-dimer correlative lab draw Day 1 56 day . Patients follow survival completion 56 day . - At BIDMC , optional blood draw perform time 0 4 hour follow first dose study drug .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Participants must meet follow criterion screen examination eligible participate phase 2 3 study : Participants must histologically confirm malignancy metastatic currently unresectable . Eligible malignancy include : Adenocarcinoma pancreas ( currently unresectable metastatic ) Colorectal ( stage IV ) Nonsmall cell lung cancer ( currently unresectable stage III stage IV ) Receiving schedule receive first second line chemotherapy ( within 30 day registration ) Minimum age 18 year . Because limited dose adverse event data currently available use isoquercetin participant &lt; 18 year age , child exclude study eligible future pediatric isoquercetin trial . Life expectancy great 4 month . ECOG performance status ≤2 ( see Appendix B ) . Patient must able swallow capsule ( phase III ) Participants must preserve organ marrow function define : Absolute neutrophil count ≥1,000/mcL Platelets ≥ 90,000/mcL PT PTT ≤ 1.5 x upper limit normal Total bilirubin &lt; 2.0 mg/dl AST ( SGOT ) /ALT ( SGPT ) ≤ 2.5 X institutional upper limit normal Creatinine &lt; 2.0 mg/dl The effect isoquercetin develop human fetus unknown . For reason , woman childbearing potential men must agree use adequate contraception ( hormonal barrier method birth control ; abstinence ) prior study entry duration study participation . Should woman become pregnant suspect pregnant participating study , inform treat physician immediately . Ability understand willingness sign write informed consent document . Participants may receive study agent . Participants know brain metastasis exclude clinical trial poor prognosis often develop progressive neurologic dysfunction would confound evaluation neurologic adverse event . Prior history document venous thromboembolic event within last 2 year ( exclude central line associate event whereby patient complete anticoagulation ) . Active bleeding high risk bleeding ( e.g . know acute gastrointestinal ulcer ) History significant hemorrhage ( require hospitalization transfusion ) outside surgical setting within last 24 month Familial bleed diathesis Known diagnosis disseminate intravascular coagulation ( DIC ) Currently receive anticoagulant therapy Current daily use aspirin ( &gt; 81mg daily ) , Clopidogrel ( Plavix ) , cilostazol ( Pletal ) , aspirindipyridamole ( Aggrenox ) ( within 10 day ) consider use regular use high dos nonsteroidal antiinflammatory agent determine treat physician ( e.g ibuprofen &gt; 800 mg daily equivalent ) . Uncontrolled intercurrent illness include , limited ongoing active infection , symptomatic congestive heart failure , unstable angina pectoris , cardiac arrhythmia , psychiatric illness/social situation would limit compliance study requirement . Known intolerance niacin ascorbic acid ( include know G6PD deficiency ) Pregnant woman exclude study isoquercetin PDI inhibitor potential teratogenic abortifacient effect . Because unknown potential risk adverse event nurse infant secondary treatment mother isoquercetin , breastfeed discontinue mother treated isoquercetin . These potential risk may also apply agent use study .</criteria>
