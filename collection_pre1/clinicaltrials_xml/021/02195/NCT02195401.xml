	<brief_summary>A child parent ask participate research project seek study whether sleep clean environment 14 day improve elimination chemical metal child 's body . The child approximately two hour evaluation confirm diagnosis Autism Pervasive Developmental Disorder . Not Otherwise Specified . When one diagnose confirm child schedule spend 14 night sleep clean environment specially create room The Children 's Institute . Several hour prior first night child sleep clean room child 's mother , father , guardian fill behavioral rating scale child assistance study 's research coordinator . The child also approximately two tablespoon blood drawn arm inch sample hair take back child 's head . The child parent guardian arrive The Children 's Institute one half hour prior child 's normal time settle bed 14 consecutive night . The child parent guardian slept clean room , wear provide clean clothes sleep special mattress sheet night 14 consecutive night . The child parent observe nurse window time clean room . The child parent participate regular daytime activity 14 day study . On morning last night child parent guardian slept clean room parent guardian fill behavioral rating scale help research coordinator . Approximately two tablespoon blood drawn arm inch sample hair obtain back child 's head , The Children 's Institute home .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Autism spectrum disorder characterize behaviorally expressive language social deficit , performance stereotypic repetitive behavior pattern , abnormal cognitive functioning . Children autism spectrum disorder often know anomaly see genetic testing . An emerge paradigm suggest majority child autism display pattern genetic / environmental interaction make susceptible difficulty detoxification heavy metal chemical environment . Children autism demonstrate increase difficulty performance methylation sulfation require elimination fat soluble chemical human tissue . These child also commonly display dysfunction metalloprotein system necessary elimination heavy metal mercury arsenic body . This study seek provide 10 child autism opportunity sleep clean room environment , hospital room modify remove nearly trace particulate matter , chemical , heavy metal , 2 week period go normal activity day . In clean room , child sleep bed wore clothes release toxins . This room create concentration gradient chemical heavy metal toxin may allow toxin leave child 's body stay . The child 's parent fill seven rating scale , include Aberrant Behavior Checklist , immediately 2 week sleep period . The child blood sample take 2 week sleep experience measure biomarkers metalloprotein ( heavy metal elimination ) immune functioning , plasma zinc/serum copper ratio T B cell subset . Red blood cell hair concentration toxic heavy metal mercury , arsenic , chromium 6 , red blood cell concentration chemical implicate contribute human pathology , include polychlorinated biphenyls ( PCBs ) , polybrominated diethyl ether ( PBDEs ) , phthalates determine sleep experience . These pre post stay variable statistically compare , hypothesize child 's red blood cell concentration toxin would significantly reduce hair concentration toxin would significantly increase sleeping experience clean room , support concept clean room promote release heavy metal chemical body . This one year study proof concept cohort study .</detailed_description>
