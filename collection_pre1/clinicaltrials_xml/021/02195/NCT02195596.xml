	<brief_summary>A program combine high intensity aerobic exercise ( &lt; 85 % Heart Rate Reserve ) resistance , progressive moderate intensity interval , carry primary care , effective term small increase respect baseline measurement total score ADAS cognitive section ( Alzheimer Disease Assessment Scale-Cognitive section ) , control group receive intervention similar low intensity ( 30-40 % Heart rate reserve ) . We Expect difference least 3 point mean increment intervention control group .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Effects Exercise Cognitive Performance Patients With Alzheimer-type Dementia . Pilot Study .</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVE : To evaluate intervention combine high intensity aerobic exercise strength ( AAAD ) general cognitive performance patient affect mild Alzheimer 's disease ( AD ) . DESIGN : Randomized clinical trial two parallel group : SCOPE : 2 health center Basque Health Service , coordination reference neurology service . PARTICIPANTS : 80 patient mild AD . INTERVENTION : Both group receive standard drug treatment . The intervention group also receive supervised EEAA program , control group receive similar intervention low intensity . Patients follow 1 year . Three blind measurement make repeatedly : baseline , 6 12 month . MEASUREMENTS : The primary outcome measure change cognitive performance measure blinded way cognitive section ADAS scale ( Alzheimer 's Disease Assessment Scale ) 0 , 6 12.Secondary Outcomes : Global cognitive performance ( Neuropsychological battery TBR-B ) , neuropsychiatric symptom ( NPI ) , ADL ( Blessed ) , functional capacity ( Test 6-minute walk ) , cardiorespiratory Test , muscular strength ( hand dynamometer trunk ) ; PREDICTORS AND CONFOUNDING VARIABLES : baseline cognitive performance , previous physical activity , medication , age , sex , APOE , school cognitive reserve . ANALYSIS : We compare two group term observe mean change baseline ADAS measurement variable , intention treat , use longitudinal mixed effect model repeat measure 6 12 month .</detailed_description>
