	<brief_summary>This study phase I , randomise , double blind ( sponsor unblinded ) , placebo-controlled , single ascend dose study GSK2831781 administer IV . GSK2831781 humanize Antibody Dependent Cell Cytotoxicity ( ADCC ) enhance monoclonal afucosylated antibody specific Lymphocyte Activation Gene-3 ( LAG-3 ) protein . This first administration GSK2831781 human evaluate two part safety , tolerability , pharmacokinetics ( PK ) , pharmacodynamics ( PD ) immunogenicity single IV dose GSK2831781 administer healthy subject previously vaccinate Bacillus Calmette Guérin ( BCG ) ( Part A delayed type hypersensitivity [ DTH ] cohort ) patient plaque psoriasis ( Part B ) . The inclusion DTH psoriasis subject explore mechanism biopsy clinical response endpoint population , well investigate systemic biomarkers provide useful information prior conduct study immune-inflammatory disease involve invasive tissue biopsy . Measuring pharmacology GSK2831781 use depletion LAG-3+ T-cells skin biopsy Tuberculin Purified Protein Derivative ( PPD ) skin challenge lesional skin biopsy patient psoriasis , helpful understand dose response relationship , important designing future study immuno-inflammatory disease , include psoriasis . Approximately 67 subject enrol complete dose critical assessment . The subject number split approximately 40 healthy subject ( Part A ) 27 patient psoriasis ( Part B ) .</brief_summary>

One suitable size site suitable repeat biopsy , one index lesion Plaque Lesional Severity Score ( PLSS ) scoring . Both must PLSS lesional score &gt; =2 induration component ( moderate ) , &gt; =1 erythema scale total score &gt; =5 . The biopsy lesion must face , groin scalp must protect sun A female subject eligible participate pregnant ( confirm negative serum human chorionic gonadotrophin ( hCG ) test screen negative urine hCG test Day 1 Females Reproductive Potential [ FRP ] ) , lactate , least one give condition applies : Nonreproductive potential define premenopausal female document tubal ligation ; document hysteroscopic tubal occlusion procedure followup confirmation bilateral tubal occlusion ; hysterectomy ; document bilateral oophorectomy . Postmenopausal define 12 month spontaneous amenorrhea [ questionable case blood sample simultaneous follicle stimulate hormone ( FSH ) estradiol level consistent menopause ( refer laboratory reference range confirmatory level ) ] . Females hormone replacement therapy ( HRT ) whose menopausal status doubt require use one highly effective contraception method wish continue HRT study . Otherwise , must discontinue HRT allow confirmation postmenopausal status prior study enrolment . Reproductive potential agrees use barrier method ( male condom female diaphragm ) plus follow one option list Modified List Highly Effective Methods Avoiding Pregnancy FRP 28 day prior first dose study medication completion followup visit .

Subjects include investigator considers subject high risk require rescue prohibit medication duration study followup . This assessment base current disease activity history frequent and/or severe flare require systemic immunosuppression . The use single treatment phototherapy ( ultraviolet B self treatment tan bed ) allow within 14 day prior Day 1 The use topical therapy psoriasis allow 7 day prior Day1 index lesion biopsy plaque Previous treatment anti Tumour necrosis factor ( TNF ) / Interleukin ( IL ) 12/IL23 monoclonal antibody allow within 12 week prior Day1 Patients require narrow therapeutic index medication Screening Followup Vulnerable subject ( e.g . person keep detention ) Subjects able understand communicate native language country study conduct .
