	<detailed_description>This prospective randomized control study kidney transplant recipient SCI 6-month surveillance kidney biopsy . SCI purpose study define 10-50 % total parenchymal mononuclear inflammation ( Banff ti1-ti2 ) &lt; i2 , t2 concurrent lesion . After enrollment , study participant subject randomize group 1 ( standard care group ) group 2 ( tocilizumab ( TCZ ) group ) . Block randomization perform UCSF investigational pharmacy use computer-generated random number . The pathologist blind randomization . Group 1 ( standard care group ) continue usual immunosuppression receive specific intervention . Group 2 ( TCZ group ) receive tocilizumab 8 mg/kg intravenously four-week interval total 6 doses.In addition , continue usual immunosuppressive regimen . As noted , group continue usual maintenance immunosuppression regimen . Therefore , recipient already receive prednisone continue 5 mg/day . Recipients prednisone-free regimen remain prednisone-free . Mycophenolate mofetil continue dose time biopsy . Tacrolimus dose adjust aim trough level 5-8 mcg/L . The study period 12 month ( 6 month therapy plus 6 month extend follow up- see Study Schema ) . Any episodes infection , renal allograft dysfunction , rejection clinical event study period treat per usual standard care . All participant see study PI co-investigator monthly study visit . A focused history physical exam perform , include query drug toxicity signs/ symptom infection . All participant obtain laboratory test interval 4 week , consist complete blood count , serum electrolyte , BUN serum creatinine , fast glucose , liver function test 12-hour trough tacrolimus level . Lipid panel obtain baseline , every 12 week study termination.The outpatient electronic medical record query twiceweekly study coordinator new laboratory result study participant . Laboratory data study participant review weekly study PI . The 12-month surveillance biopsy perform end therapy ( 6 month study enrollment ) .</detailed_description>
