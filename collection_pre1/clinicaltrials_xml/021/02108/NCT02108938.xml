	<detailed_description>Brain窶身ut interaction study chronic pain condition gastrointestinal ( GI ) tract irritable bowel syndrome ( IBS ) chronic pancreatitis . These study suggest alteration brain窶身ut axis may relate disease severity pain perception . Inflammatory bowel disease ( IBD ) chronic inflammatory disorder characterize period disease activity period disease quiescence . Crohn 's disease ( CD ) one two major subtypes IBD . Patients CD typically experience abdominal pain disease active ; however , many also report experience pain absence objective evidence inflammation . Alterations brain窶身ut interaction may explain perception pain patient . Currently , paucity data regard brain change patient IBD CD , specifically . We propose pilot study characterize brain窶身ut interaction disease activity pain modulation mechanism patient IBD use advanced neuroimaging tool .</detailed_description>
