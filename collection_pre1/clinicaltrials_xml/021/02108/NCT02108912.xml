Participants ( n=30 ) adult complete acute rehabilitation follow stroke . Random assignment either ESTT traditional gait training protocol outpatient rehabilitation phase . 1 .

	<detailed_description>At time enrollment , participant randomly assign one two group depend severity impairment hemiparetic low extremity . Groups match base high function vs. low functioning ( STREAM score ) . Group assignment do random draw concealed envelope red blue chip assignment ESTT non-treadmill base outpatient therapy service . For next participant screen similar STREAM impairment level , he/she place alternate group match group assignment . Enrollment proceed fashion . All outpatient therapy service provide UT Southwestern School Health Professions School Physical Therapy Gait Disorders Clinic ( UTSW GDC ) . The group follow : 1 . Group A : Traditional outpatient therapy ( n = 15 ) 2 . Group B : Treadmill ( ESTT ) outpatient therapy ( n = 15 ) Therapy purpose study discontinue maximum 24 training session 8 week . It anticipate , base research concern AFO use person stroke , participant require AFO safe gait training outpatient setting . Traditional outpatient therapy : For person Group A , gait training consist 30 minute walk training . The program may include variety intervention commonly do rehabilitate gait stroke ( exclude treadmill train ) . Walking may include use various assistive device roll walker , gait trainer , cane crutch . Other tool may utilize include visual cue ( tape , laser ) auditory cue ( metronome ) . Other activity single limb stance stair climb may include facilitate limb stability . Functional electrical stimulation ( FES ) may use facilitate muscle activation hemiparetic low extremity gait training participant . Stimulation may apply muscle upper and/or low leg gait training . Use electrical stimulation document , include parameter ( make model unit , rate stimulation [ pulse per second ] , waveform , duration use ) . Appropriate exercise bank exercise select participant . The bank exercise include : stand heel cord stretch , single leg stance , sit stand , time standing , march place , tap ups , step ups , step throughs , stand ball roll , stair climbing , stand Theraband exercise , wall squat . They advise complete exercise daily ( 5 days/week total ) total 30 minute per day . In addition , instruct wear AFO upright mobility task , combination prescribe assistive device . Treadmill ( ESTT ) outpatient therapy : For person Group B , study-related outpatient gait training initiate treadmill partial body weight support . The initial body weight support set 30 % 50 % patient 's body weight . During progressive training session , amount body weight support attempt reduce researcher assess response increase body weight gait pattern . The initial speed treadmill 0.7 mph ( minimum initial speed ) increase progressively tolerate speed 1.8 mph reach . Subject tolerance intervention monitor closely . Gait training treadmill schedule 30-minute session . The subject allow take rest break need treadmill train . During gait training treadmill , ankle control facilitate mean ankle foot orthosis ( AFO ) double adjustable joint . For ground gait , participant also use AFO double adjustable joint Functional electrical stimulation ( FES ) may use facilitate muscle activation hemiparetic low extremity gait training participant . Over ground gait initiate subject able walk treadmill 10 % body weight support minimal assist advance hemiparetic leg speed 0.8 mph great least 3 minute two consecutive bout . ( Subjects also assistance weight shift . ) Once ground gait initiate , either bilateral unilateral support use , depend upper extremity control general upright stability . If quality gait deteriorate significantly gait observe treadmill , ground gait halt session . Treadmill train continue progress ground gait . Once ground gait training initiate , 20 minute 30 total therapy minute spend treadmill train 10 minute spend ground gait training . Treadmill train continue subject able walk 10 minute without rest body weight support , vest safety , without upper extremity support without assist weight shift low extremity control speed 1.8 mph . If prior conclusion study-related therapy , entire 30 minute session spend practice ground gait . Appropriate exercise bank exercise select participant . The bank exercise include : stand heel cord stretch , single leg stance , sit stand , time standing , march place , tap ups , step ups , step throughs , stand ball roll , stair climbing , stand Theraband exercise , wall squat . They advise complete exercise daily ( 5 days/week total ) total 30 minute per day . In addition , instruct wear AFO upright mobility task , combination prescribe assistive device . The Step Program : To introduce component study , participant caregiver/support person give 15-minute presentation entitle Step Up . This program develop research team address critical need benefit exercise person post stroke , method safe exercise monitoring information progression exercise intensity duration improve cardiorespiratory function . The presentation include explanation Borg Rate Perceived Exertion ( RPE , 6-20 scale ) direction utilize pedometer daily walk measurement . Following presentation , participant meet investigator demonstrate competency application pedometer utilization RPE scale . Each participant provide write material cover salient point presentation . They also receive notebook instruction along 16 weekly log record walk data . The training take approximately 30 minute take place follow final gait treatment . The walk program continue T4 T4a . Each participant schedule test within 10 calendar day 24-week anniversary commencement outpatient therapy . At test time ( T4 &amp; T4a ) outcome measure repeat . The final testing time ( T5 T5 ) complete within 10 calendar day 288-day anniversary commencement outpatient physical therapy . All outcome measure repeat test time . This termination point study .</detailed_description>
