	<detailed_description>Breast cancer second lead cause cancer-related death woman estimate 508 000 death 2011 worldwide . Incidence rate vary 19.3 per 100,000 woman Eastern Africa 89.7 per 100,000 woman Western Europe . Locally , 1 every 16 Singaporean woman lifetime affected , make common cancer woman Singapore , 17.9 % cancer death woman attribute . The Singapore Cancer Registry ( 2012 ) also reveal age-standardised incidence rate newly diagnose breast cancer increase 22.0 per 100,000 1973-1977 period 62.4 per 100,000 2008-2012 period . Studies consistently show mammography effective early detection breast cancer - , reduce breast cancer mortality 20-22 % . However , recent study question efficacy mammography . Gotszche et al . challenge past trial inadequate randomization , 1998 Cochrane Review question potential confounding effect advance adjuvant chemotherapy ( i.e . Tamoxifen ) overall breast cancer survival rate . With reference 2005 New England Journal Medicine paper Berry et al , screen remains effective tool , therapy , contribute decline relate mortality . In 2011 local paper , Wang et al compare screen-detected symptomatic woman , conclude screen-detected patient overall high survival rate symptomatic counterpart . For past 15 year , nationwide breast cancer-screening programme Singapore recommend woman age 40-69 undergo screening mammography , emphasize woman young age group 40-49 screened year due unique local age-specific incidence rate show unusually high incidence 34.4 % woman age 45-54 . Despite aggressive effort incentive , mammography uptake rate poor . A National Health Survey 2010 reveal 3 5 woman go regular mammography recommend frequency . A pre-pilot study Seow et al 2009 show 27.4 % woman survey never mammogram . A recent paper publish 2013 Teo et al . also report regular mammography uptake rate dismal rate 26 % . Dismal uptake rate notably equally rampant country , vary 40 % 90 % woman quote non-compliant respective breast cancer screen programme . Local study reveal fear pain belief cancer would happen barrier screen . Teo et al . also reveal predictor poor uptake low income group , poor educational level , fear pain/discomfort well Malay . This illustrate multidimensional influence race , ethnicity , knowledge health-seeking behavior determine compliance regular screening . With previous study identify various barrier Singapore 's mammography-screening program , investigator hope go evaluate effectiveness target intervention help woman overcome say barrier . While multiple trial do overseas - determine effectiveness various intervention , two local trial Seow et al 2012 1998 do public sector primary care set - . As 80 % primary care Singapore occur private sector , conduct study would represent different demographic patient characteristic wider applicability . Furthermore , strong doctor-patient relationship may help effectiveness General Practitioner ( GP ) -based intervention . A key factor may therefore lack physician recommendation . Published evidence suggest patient likely follow mammography screen primary care practitioner order test - . As , investigator hope design evaluate cost effective , feasible relevant intervention realistically implemented resource available workflow average GP clinic without additional resource manpower requirement .</detailed_description>
