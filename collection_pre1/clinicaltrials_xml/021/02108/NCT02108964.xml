Patients must histologically cytologically confirm locally advanced ( stage IIIB amenable definitive multimodality therapy include surgery ) metastatic ( stage IV ) EGFR mutant NSCLC . 4 . Patients control brain metastasis may participate trial . They must complete plan radiation therapy and/or surgery &gt; 2 week prior first dose study treatment remain asymptomatic . Patients steroid must stable low dose 2 week prior initiate study treatment . 5 . ECOG performance status : Phase I part : 0 , 1 , 2 ; Phase II part : 0 1 6 . Presence least one measurable lesion accord RECIST 1.1 per Investigator assessment . A previously irradiate site lesion may count target lesion clear sign progression since irradiation . ( see Section 14.1 Appendix 1 ) 7 . Patients must screen HBV . Patients either HBsAg positive HBVDNA positive must willing able take antiviral therapy 12 week prior 1st dose EGF816 treatment continue antiviral therapy least 4 week last dose EGF816 . Additional management patient would provide physician expertise management HBV , need . 8 . Patients must screen HCV . Patients must negative hepatitis C antibody ( HCVAb ) positive HCVAb undetectable level HCVRNA . Note : patient detectable HCVRNA eligible study . 9 . Willingness ability comply schedule visit , treatment plan , laboratory test study procedure Exclusion criterion : ( Applies patient unless otherwise specify ) 1 . Patients history presence interstitial lung disease interstitial pneumonitis , include clinically significant radiation pneumonitis ( i.e . affect activity daily live require therapeutic intervention ) 2 . Patients unstable brain metastasis 3 . History another malignancy Exception : Patients diseasefree 3 year , patient history adequately treat insitu carcinoma uterine cervix , basal squamous cell carcinoma , nonmelanomatous cancer skin , history stage IA melanoma cure , eligible . 4 .

Initiation adjustment antihypertensive medication ( ) allow prior screen Ventricular arrhythmia Supraventricular nodal arrhythmia control medication Other cardiac arrhythmia control medication Patients history congenital long QT syndrome , history Torsade de Pointes patient correct QT ( QTc ) &gt; 480 msec use Fridericia correction ( QTcF ) screen ECG ( use triplicate ECGs ) 8 . Patients receive thoracic radiotherapy lung field ≤ 4 week prior start study treatment patient recover radiotherapyrelated toxicity . For anatomic site ( include radiotherapy thoracic vertebra rib ) , radiotherapy ≤ 2 week prior start study treatment patient recover radiotherapyrelated toxicity . Palliative radiotherapy bone lesion ≤ 2 week prior start study treatment 9 . Patients major surgery ( e.g. , intrathoracic , intraabdominal intrapelvic ) within 4 week prior ( 2 week resection brain metastasis ) start study drug recover side effect procedure . Videoassisted thoracic surgery ( VATS ) mediastinoscopy count major surgery patient enrol study ≥1 week procedure . 10 . Any medical condition would , investigator 's judgment , prevent patient 's participation clinical study due safety concern compliance clinical study procedure . Any severe , acute , chronic medical psychiatric condition laboratory abnormality may increase risk associate study participation study treatment administration may interfere interpretation study result , judgment investigator , would make patient inappropriate study 11 . Prior therapy Patients treat chemotherapy biologic therapy investigational agent ≤ 1 week prior first dose study treatment Unresolved toxicity great CTCAE grade 1 prior anticancer therapy radiotherapy ( exclude neurotoxicity , alopecia , lymphopenia ) Note : exception possible , case case basis , follow discussion mutual agreement investigator Novartis ( applicable Phase I part ) . 12 . Patients range laboratory value define Absolute Neutrophil Count ( ANC ) &lt; 1.5 x 109/L Hemoglobin ( Hgb ) &lt; 9 g/dL Platelets &lt; 75 x 109/L Total bilirubin &gt; 1.5 x upper limit normal ( ULN ) . For patient Gilbert 's syndrome total bilirubin &gt; 3.0 x ULN Aspartate aminotransferase ( AST ) and/or alanine aminotransferase ( ALT ) &gt; 3 x ULN patient without hepatic metastasis AST and/or ALT &gt; 5 x ULN patient hepatic metastasis Alkaline phosphatase ( ALP ) &gt; 5 x ULN Fasting plasma glucose &gt; 175 mg/dL ( &gt; 9.8 mmol/L ) Measured calculate creatinine clearance &lt; 45 ml/min use CockcroftGault formula 13 . Patients follow laboratory value outside laboratory normal limit correct within normal limit supplement screen : Potassium Magnesium Phosphorus Total calcium ( correct serum albumin ) 14 . Patients receive treatment medication know strong inhibitor inducer CYP3A4/5 discontinue 1 week prior start EGF816 treatment duration study . 15 . Participation prior investigational study within 1 week within 5 halflives investigational product , whichever longer , prior first dose study treatment Note : exception possible , case case basis , follow discussion mutual agreement investigator Novartis ( applicable Phase I part ) . 16 . Patients impairment GI function GI disease may significantly alter absorption EGF816 ( e.g. , ulcerative disease , uncontrolled nausea , vomit , diarrhea , malabsorption syndrome ) 17 . Patients receive treatment enzymeinducing anticonvulsant discontinue least 1 week first dose study treatment , duration study . Patients nonenzymeinducing anticonvulsant eligible 18 . Pregnant nursing ( lactate ) woman 19 . Women childbearing potential , defined woman physiologically capable become pregnant , unless use highly effective method contraception study 3 month stop study treatment . Highly effective contraception method include : Total abstinence ( line prefer usual lifestyle subject . Periodic abstinence ( e.g. , calendar , ovulation , symptomthermal , postovulation method ) withdrawal acceptable method contraception Female sterilization ( surgical bilateral oophorectomy without hysterectomy ) tubal ligation least six week take study treatment . In case oophorectomy alone , reproductive status woman confirm follow hormone level assessment Male Partner : male sterilization ( least 6 month prior screen ) . For female subject study vasectomized male partner sole partner subject . Combination two follow ( a+b a+c , b+c ) : 1 . Use oral , injected implant hormonal method contraception form hormonal contraception comparable efficacy ( failure rate &lt; 1 % ) , example hormone vaginal ring transdermal hormone contraception . 2 . Placement intrauterine device ( IUD ) intrauterine system ( IUS ) 3 . Barrier method contraception : Condom Occlusive cap ( diaphragm cervical/vault cap ) spermicidal foam/gel/film/cream/vaginal suppository In case use oral contraception woman stable pill minimum 30 day take study treatment . Women consider postmenopausal childbearing potential 12 month natural ( spontaneous ) amenorrhea appropriate clinical profile ( e.g . age appropriate , history vasomotor symptom ) surgical bilateral oophorectomy ( without hysterectomy ) tubal ligation least six week ago . In case oophorectomy alone , reproductive status woman confirm follow hormone level assessment consider childbearing potential . 20 . Sexually active male unless use condom intercourse take drug 3 month stop treatment ; men father child period . A condom require use also vasectomize men order prevent delivery drug via seminal fluid . Other protocoldefined exclusion criterion may apply .</criteria>
