	<detailed_description>A . SPECIFIC AIMS SA1 : Obtain preliminary estimate extent structure chant exercise stimulates salivary secretion contains quantifiable amount NGF healthy subject . SA2 : Obtain preliminary estimate extent structure breathe exercise stimulates salivary secretion contains quantifiable amount NGF healthy subject . B . BACKGROUND AND SIGNIFICANCE BACKGROUND Neurodegenerative Diseases Neurodegenerative diseases Alzheimer 's disease major healthcare concern globally . In USA , AD 6th lead cause death . Both genetic non-genetic factor contribute development AD . Individuals affect AD require support range medication , assist device personal care pose enormous emotional financial burden . AD associate significant alteration molecular level eventually translate cellular , tissue , organ systemic dysfunction . Therefore , molecular therapy alters cell function major clinical option treat AD . For example , NGF , trophic factor involve development , maintenance survival peripheral nervous system cholinergic neuron central nervous system , show significant reduction AD subject . The reduction NGF cause significant decline cognitive function . Therefore administration NGF follow viable clinical option AD subject . In addition therapeutic option , non-pharmacological mode treatment meditation yoga consider alternative approach treat AD . Such practice life-style deeply root several ancient culture . This project base two life-style health practice ancient Tamil culture . NGF Nerve growth factor ( NGF ) neurotrophic protein ( MW=13 kDa ) . NGF produce every tissue/organ innervate sensory afferent and/or sympathetic efferent , well central ( CNS ) peripheral ( PNS ) nervous system , immune cell . NGF important functional integrity cholinergic neuron CNS development functional integrity neuron PNS . NGF survival , differentiation trophic factor cell immune system epithelial origin . Salivary gland ( submandibular/submaxillary ) produce large amount NGF humans mouse . NGF produce mouse submaxillary gland use several clinical trial . In CNS , NGF produce cortex , hippocampus pituitary gland ; also area , include basal ganglion , thalamus , spinal cord retina . NGF bind receptor TrkA activate mitogenic MAPK , PI3K/Akt PLC-gamma pathway mediate cell growth , differentiation survival . NGF mediate survival important basal forebrain complex ( BFC ) cholinergic neuron . These neuron contribute consciousness , memory , attention arousal . BFC neuron highly affect neurodegenerative disease AD . NGF protect BFC neuron experimental trauma model , age-associated cholinergic decline . Due positive effect NGF multiple system , development NGF drug actively pursue treat neurodegeneration , immune dysregulation , chronic inflammation autoimmune disease . However , recently clinical trial NGF without much success hyperalgesia . Recent study show gene therapy , nasal ocular route NGF administration effective much less nociceptive side effect . Moreover , recent find chemical modification NGF reduce pain consider new direction NGF therapy . A Phase II clinical trial assess beneficial effect adeno-associated virus mediate expression NGF cholinergic neuron brain underway MUSC involve co-investigator project Dr. Jacobo Mintzer . NGF take target organs innervating neuron transport axonal body retrograde axonal transport . Researchers use quantum-dot label NGF show NGF dimer package individual endosomes retrograde transport . Retrograde axonal transport NGF signal survival , differentiation , maintenance peripheral sympathetic sensory neuron , basal forebrain cholinergic neuron . Botulinum toxin follow retrograde pathway reach central neuron . Additionally , recently confirm Botulinum neurotoxins A E reach distal sit nervous system via retrograde long range transport via motor neuron suggest mechanism could common dissemination neurotrophic factor well . This might explain intranasal application NGF consider effective NGF therapy . In addition , sublingual route absorption bypass gastrointestinal route use application nitroglycerine psychoactive agent . Thus , rationale NGF produce salivary gland take 1 ) innervate sensory motor neuron retrograde axonal transport cell body transcytosis reach central neuron , 2 ) sublingual absorption route bloodstream reach distal target organ well within theoretical framework production transport mechanism establish neuromodulators . It emphasize proposal first ever attempt stimulate NGF non-invasive method . Chanting Chanting sing two ancient cultural practice human history . Recent evidence suggest two practice regulate breathing . The sound symbol Om ( Figure 2 ) refer one-lettered key happy living . Om well-known prefix several chant throughout eastern religion . Chanting Om believe associated physical emotional well-being . Chanting Om increase cutaneous peripheral vascular resistance , sign increase mental alertness even physiologically relax . In 40 % Alzheimer 's subject , middle latency auditory evoke potential ( MLAEP ) lacking . Chanting Om show improve MLAEP normal subject chant suggest similar effect could observe AD subject . Vagal nerve stimulation ( VNS ) beneficial AD subject enhance cognitive function . Electrical pulsing VNS show deactivation limbic brain region . Chanting Om also cause similar deactivation limbic brain region , amygdala , hippocampus , parahippocampal gyrus , insula , orbitofrontal anterior cingulate cortex thalamus . The neurophysiological effect chant Om could mediate auricular branch vagal nerve . However , understood specific molecular change , term neurotrophic factor like NGF , occur Om chanting . Breathing Exercise Breathing exercise active way regulate breathing . Common breathe frequency 15 time per minute normal adult human . This frequency change age physiological condition . In heart failure subject Bernardi et al show slow breathe beneficial . Exercises yoga , chant breathe exercise regulate breathe cognitive function . One ancient text refer benefit breathe exercise Thirumanthiram write Tamil sage Thirumoolar whose text know health longevity practice . Breathing exercise believe produce cycle oxygenation non-oxygenation state mean ischemic preconditioning . Remote ischemic preconditioning , i.e. , induce short period ischemia remote organ provide protection subsequent ischemic insult . Breath-holding increase vagal tone , increase parasympathetic dominance decrease sympathetic discharge . Regulated breathe lead predominance abdominal/diaphragmatic breathing . Thus breathe exercise could potential way induce ischemic preconditioning neuron . It known brain heart ischemic precondition beneficial avert future major ischemic event produce cell survival signal . Interestingly NGF cell survival signal molecule . Therefore conceivable breathing exercise induces cell survival central peripheral nervous system cell via action NGF . Saliva Biomarker A normal human produce 0.75 1.5 L saliva per day . Saliva contain numerous biologically active molecule include protein , peptide , mRNA , DNA , miRNA human oral microbial origin . Salivary secretion regulate digestive , nervous , immune respiratory system . For example , 1 ) Nerve growth factor ( NGF ) , substance P calcitonin-gene related peptide ( CGRP ) secrete saliva response chronic migraine , 2 ) Opiorphin , potent anti-nociceptive agent express saliva . Salivary proteomic mRNA profile identify significant difference control cancer subject . These study indicate saliva serf source biomarkers diagnosis prognosis number pathological condition include AD . SIGNIFICANCE Neurodegenerative diseases AD constitute major global healthcare problem . Non-pharmacological non-invasive practice could alter neurological function normal pathological setting . Salivary secretion neurotrophic factor indicate saliva could potential source biomarker neurotrophic factor . Therefore , salivary NGF estimation could tool diagnosis prognosis AD . Ancient Tamil culture preserve practice maintain healthy psychological physiological status . Chanting breathe exercise know promote salivary secretion . However , fully understood practice induce expression neurological factor saliva . We aim quantify salivary NGF response chant breathe exercise normal human subject . This establish hitherto unreported relationship tongue tactile respiratory signal salivary secretion NGF , effect nervous system . Our project quantify candidate neurotrophic factor NGF saliva basal , post-exercise . In future study use proteomic , peptidic genomic approach identify neurotrophic factor regulate saliva exercise . Our finding introduce new paradigm treatment care individual with/prone AD neurodegenerative disease . Clinical Translational Impact : Given fact AD , age neurodegenerative disorder associate decline neurotrophic factor production ( e.g . NGF ) , NGF actively pursue drug clinical trial , finding NGF could stimulate situ simple , non-invasive ethnic practice strong clinical application . Future study use genomic proteomic approach identify additional neurotrophic factor saliva could potentially drug target treat AD neurodegenerative disease . C. PRELIMINARY STUDIES None . D.
