	<brief_summary>Hemophilia cause single-gene defect result familial bleeding disorder . Small increase gene product could transform severe form hemophilia mild one . Stem cell extrahepatic source consider clinical application liver cell therapy posse high vitro culture potential could use transplant procedure . We study differentiation bone marrow hematopoietic stem cell ( BM-HSCs ) hemophilia patient ' relative factor 8 ( FVIII ) -producing hepatocyte-like cell aim expand patient ' donor option partial replacement mutant liver cell healthy cell hemophilia A patient could manage severity bleed disorder . BM-HSCs hemophilic family culture short-liquid hepatic induction medium . Appearance hepatic phenotype evaluate alpha-fetoprotein expression use immunocytochemistry . Functional evaluation transdifferentiation do detection albumin synthesis use microalbumin assay kit , factor VIII activity one-stage clot assay expression FVIII messenger RNA ( mRNA ) reverse transcription ( RT-PCR ) . Inducing differentiation BM-HSCs in-vitro manipulation may become valuable tool provide cell source hepatocyte transplant procedure treatment hemophilia patient .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Hemophilia A X-linked bleeding disorder cause deficiency abnormality factor VIII . It common inherited coagulation protein deficiency incidence approximately 1 10,000 male . More 75 % hemophilic patient suffer severe type disease . Hemophilia treatment readily available developed country ; however , estimate 70 % people disease worldwide undiagnosed undertreated . Moreover , 20 % hemophilia A patient develop inhibitor treatment consequently difficult treat . Exogenous factor 8 replacement hemophilia patient present great financial medical challenge . The optimum therapeutic option patient provide endogenous secretion factor . This propose liver transplantation . Liver transplantation human canine hemophilia A result increase factor VIII level normal thus cure bleed diathesis . Given problem donor availability , major operative procedure need lifelong immunosuppression , cell-based therapy use isolated hepatocytes propose promise option treat clot disorder . The therapeutic effectiveness human hepatocytes transplant kidney capsule mice demonstrate . Transplantation wild-type rat deficient bilirubin conjugation ischemia/reperfusion damage result 30 % decrease serum bilirubin , appearance bilirubin conjugate bile expression normal glucuronyltransferase enzyme denote transplantation small number hepatocytes result partial correction functional defect . Although cellular transplantation hepatocytes solves operative risk , disadvantage difficult propagation hepatocytes vitro . An alternative hepatocyte transplantation use in-vitro transdifferentiated bone marrow derive stem cell . In past year , novel option regenerate damage liver bone marrow-derived cell propose many investigator . Studies show bone marrow cell differentiate hepatic liver sinusoidal endothelial cell also express intact gene FVIII A3 domain . Mesenchymal stem cell many advantage candidate cellular therapy . They propagate in-vitro , evoke immune reaction express human leukocyte antigen ( HLA ) -G , proven adopt hepatocyte phenotype vitro . In hemophilia A patient , mother carrier , father completely normal , female sibling 50 % chance normal carrier . Thus , possibility find HLA-matched donor normal FVIII activity family present . The use mesenchymal stem cell ( BM-MSCs ) follow advantage BM-HSCs : 1 . MSCs differentiate hepatic endothelial phenotype 2 . MSCs express HLA antigens except HLA-G cause immunosuppression , thus match MSC transplantation easier . The hypothesis present study use allogenic bone marrow derive mesenchymal stem cell induce adopt hepatocyte phenotype vitro cellular therapy product hemophilia patient . Donors subject : 1 . Bone marrow aspiration local short general anaesthesia , 40-60ml BM collect heparinized syrinx . 2 . Mononuclear cell fraction separate use SEPAX machine ( Biosafe ) 3 . MSCs isolate use plastic adherence subject hepatic induction use sequential fibroblast growth factor hepatocyte growth factor addition GMP condition . 4 . Verification hepatic induction do use morphological , molecular proteomic screening . 5 . Cells harvest use 0.25 % trypsin , wash suspend sterile saline dose 2 million cell per kg body weight final volume 5ml injected hepatic parenchyma sonographic monitoring .</detailed_description>
