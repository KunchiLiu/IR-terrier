	<brief_summary>Breast cancer biomarkers usually perform core needle biopsy ( CNB ) specimens routinely repeat surgical specimen ( SS ) . However , preliminary data suggest test biomarkers , SS compare CNB sample lead different result . Our hypothesis The aim study identify group woman invasive breast cancer may benefit additional HER2 test SS ensure area HER2 amplification miss . Another aim determine whether HER2 test SS select patient would lead change breast cancer treatment option .</brief_summary>

	<criteria>1 . Women &gt; age 18 capacity consent 2 . Invasive breast cancer identify CNB AAMC within 45 day study consent 3 . IHC biomarkers perform original CNB ( include HER2 ) 4 . Tumors great 2cm invasive disease ( measure radiographically prior resection microscopically resection ) , 5 . Multifocal multicentric tumor 1 . Men 2 . Women HER2 positive tumor detect CNB specimens 3 . Women receive neoadjuvant chemotherapy 4 . Women whose CNB surgical resection perform hospital AAMC . If CNB prior resection repeat AAMC new tumor biomarkers perform , patient eligible enrollment 5 . Women whose IHC marker result inconclusive CNB perform</criteria>
