	<brief_summary>Background : - People alcoholism difference brain compare healthy people . People dependent alcohol also perform differently behavioral task . Researchers want find difference . They also want see difference relate DNA . Objective : - To see difference brain structure relate personality behavior difference people without alcohol dependence . Eligibility : - Adults age 18 old . Design : - Participants visit NIH Clinical Center study . - Participants screen medical history , EKG , physical exam . They give blood urine sample undergo psychiatric interview . - Participants ask alcohol drinking , see alcohol use disorder . - Participants play three computerized game . Some play game inside magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) scanner . - MRI : strong magnetic field radio wave take picture brain . Participants lie table slide cylinder . They scanner 90 minute . They may lie still 20 minute time . The scanner make loud knock noise . They get earplug .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Objective : The purpose protocol obtain standard set assessment , include brain behavioral , structural , functional , connectivity ( structural functional ) information , NIAAA research participant , refer hereinafter Characterization Imaging Instruments ( CII ) ; ) determine individual difference brain structure evoke response relate generalize trait personality behavior difference ( assess psychometric questionnaire instrument behavioral measure ) ; b ) determine whether individual difference relate specifically genetic polymorphism gene govern neurotransmitter activity . Thus , goal CII identify brain structural , functional , behavioral , genetic , phenotypic factor associate alcoholism . Study population : Non-treatment seek adult volunteer inpatient participant alcohol dependence ( ADs ) . Inpatient ADs refer individual diagnose alcohol dependent DSM-IV-RT criterion least Moderate Alcohol Use Disorder determine DSM-5 . Design : This study require one visit include MRI scan ( participant determine eligible scanner ) consist whole brain structural MRI , Diffusion Tensor MRI , Resting State MRI ( rsMRI ) well several task-based functional MRIs , perform computerized behavioral , motivational , cognitive/emotional task . If participant qualify MR scan , he/she perform computerized behavioral , motivational , cognitive/emotional task outside scanner . These instrument include instrument common similar protocol NIDA . Outcome measure : The outcome measure differences behavioral response use standard statistical method , brain structural data use AFNI , FSL , SPM FreeSurfer software , blood oxygenation level dependent ( BOLD ) signal measure use standard fMRI technique analyze use AFNI FSL software . Secondary outcome measure compare genetic , behavioral phenotypic factor image behavioral data acquire across protocol .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>INCLUSION CRITERIA : ADULT PARTICIPANTS All adult participant must : Enrolled screen protocol 14AA0181 , Unit Clinic Evaluation , Screening , Assessment , Management determine eligible another NIAAA study . Task performance ( behavioral fMRI ) : Are clear base neuromotor examination determine screen protocol 14AA0181 . Inpatient participant : Meet DSMIVTR criterion alcohol dependence DSM5 criterion moderate severe alcohol use disorder EXCLUSION CRITERIA : ADULT PARTICIPANTS Exclusion criterion MR scan : * Presence ferromagnetic object body contraindicate MRI head ( pacemaker implant electrical device , brain stimulators , type dental implant , aneurysm clip , metallic prosthesis , permanent eyeliner , implanted delivery pump , shrapnel fragment ) fear enclose space . Eligibility determine MRI Safety Screening Questionnaire ( see Appendix A ) verify , necessary , physician . Can lie comfortably flat back 2 hour MRI scanner . Uncomfortable enclosed space ( claustrophobia ) would feel discomfort scanner Women : Are pregnant Are lefthanded . Subjects exclude MR scan may still perform behavioral task otherwise would perform scanner , qualify behavioral task . Inpatient participant alcohol dependence symptom alcohol withdrawal indicated recent measurement within past 30 day , measure Clinical Institute Withdrawal Assessment ( CIWAAr ) score great equal 8 .</criteria>
