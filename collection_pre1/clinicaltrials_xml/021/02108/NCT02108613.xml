	<brief_summary>Approximately half men treat prostate cancer offer hormone deprivation therapy cancer experience . The secondary effect treatment result osteoporosis , cardiovascular disease , stroke , diabetes , diminish sexual health . To promote healthy lifestyle choice couple maintain intimacy emotional health propose Living Well , innovative program combine nutrition , physical activity , sexual health initiative one integrated service . This project pilot Vancouver Island Centre expect 100 patient 1 year .

	<detailed_description>1 . Purpose : The overarch goal Living Well project maintain improve quality life people prostate cancer androgen deprivation therapy ( ADT ) partner provide couple tool promote confidence motivation remain physically psychosocially healthy intimate . The primary objective determine effect comprehensive community-based survivorship program psychosocial health people PCa ADT partner . Secondarily intend explore impact program biomarkers associate metabolic syndrome often observe men ADT , program 's operational perceive ( patient partner ) impact program . 2 . Hypothesis : 1 . The intervention group show large magnitude improvement measure QOL , fatigue , intimacy , ultimately lead increase benefit compare control group . 2 . We believe engagement peer volunteer compliance adherence positive lifestyle change high intervention group compare control group . 3 . Justification : ADT offer people prostate cancer ( PCa ) improve curative outcome combine local radiation therapy fundamental control disease biochemical recurrence metastatic disease . Due effectiveness , ADT offer 50 % people PCa . ADT reduce occurrence metastasis lower testosterone level . Unfortunately , decrease testosterone lead hot flash , diminish libido , erectile dysfunction , depression , diminish muscle strength , reduce bone mineral density , increase fat mass , increase cholesterol level . This conglomerate secondary effect lead osteoporosis , cardiovascular disease , stroke , diabetes . Poor lifestyle habit aggravate secondary effect ADT therapy . Being overweight may increase risk mortality PCa . However , increase vascular disease diabetes seem strongly correlate death cancer . Those pre-existing cardiac problem receive ADT , 75 % chance die cardiovascular disease rather PCa . There grow evidence healthy lifestyle practice include healthy diet regular physical activity improve overall prognosis PCa patient diminish negative effect ADT . Many cancer survivor motivate seek information food choice physical activity improve response treatment quality life . Recent research show preemptive educational program build around book , `` Androgen Deprivation Therapy : An Essential Guide Prostate Cancer Patients Their Loved Ones '' , `` Workbook '' short , address issue life style management , effective help patient family overcome challenge ADT . The Workbook create national team PCa expert ( ADT Working Group ) endorse Canadian Urological Association . The Workbook address well-established , physical emotional adverse effect ADT . Although ADT side effect directly reduce patient 's survival , may greatly impact patient partner 's QoL . Important aspect explore Workbook include psychosocial effect ADT , exercise need , nutritional recommendation men ADT . Previous research indicate effectiveness Workbook enhance distributed patient prior start ADT , side effect manifest . The Workbook 's effectiveness also enhance combined motivational session lead trained educator . Given people PCa ADT partner generally struggle aspect sexual health , nutrition , physical activity concurrently , propose first time test comprehensive PCa survivorship approach , Living Well program , address concern related three component . This community-based program design PCa patient prior start ADT also extend partner . The program make extensive use ADT Workbook primarily deliver use exist resource . 4 . Objectives : The primary outcome : - Quality Life - Fatigue Secondary outcome - Intimacy We also explore : - Effects biomarkers associate metabolic syndrome secondary ADT * - Effects erectile dysfunction , PSA testosterone levels* - The perception patient partner impact program psychosocial health - Operational impact Note : *Patient 's health record check obtain annual blood measure cholesterol , glucose , lipoprotein , PSA , testosterone level responses Sexual Health Inventory Men - SHIM , part usual care . 5 . Research Method : We propose prospective randomize control trial . Over twelve month , sample 100 English-speaking people , schedule start androgen deprivation therapy start within last 7 day prostate cancer recruit study . Every two consent participant ( partner available ) randomize . Therefore , one patient/partner receive intervention one place control group . Both arm receive workbook sexual counseling . The experimental group also access exercise nutrition program , three component support peer volunteer . Over course one month predict eight patient/partners consent ( four control , four intervention ) . Every four participant ( partner available ) randomize intervention form group proceed program . Potential participant identify invited physician . The Research Intern consent participant . After consent participant instruct bring sign PAR-Q+ ( 24 , 25 ) consent form Introductory Meeting Prostate Centre . The research intern also access participant 's medical record collect demographic information ( cancer stage treatment , co-morbidities , age ) start program.Participant 's partner also invited participate program The control group attend Introductory meeting two sexual health counseling session .The intervention group attend Introductory meeting , two sexual health meeting plus exercise component ( eight weekly exercise session ) nutrition component ( four monthly nutrition session ) period 6 month . A peer volunteer assign intervention couple provide support intervention help maintain participant 's adherence physical activity healthy eat goals.Both intervention control group provide measurement sexual health session ( body-mass index -BMI , waist circumference , grip strength , blood pressure heart rate ) , describe medical history current medication . Both group attend follow-up measurement session 12 24 month baseline . Participants partner fill separate questionnaire baseline , 6 month two follow-up measurement session Participants partner interview baseline , six , twelve , twenty-four month . Interviews conduct saturation baseline ( expect n=10 ) couple interview time point . During interview qualitative data collect transcribed analysis . Questions related current physical activity experience , nutritional habit barrier maintain healthy diet regular physical activity routine ask . In addition interview intervention participant ask question related participant ' satisfaction timing , quality , relevance &amp; usefulness topic discuss physical activity nutrition session , motivation provide instructor peer volunteer overall feedback program . 6 . Statistical Analysis : The Statistical Package Social Sciences ( SPSS ) version 14.0 ( SPSS Inc. , Chicago , IL ) use statistical analysis . Significance set P = 0.05 ( two-tailed ) . Descriptive statistic [ mean ± standard deviation ( SD ) ] calculate characteristic . Differences group examine use Mann-Whitney U-test Kruskal-Wallis test . A sample size calculation base Quality Life primary outcome measure FACT-P questionnaire ( 36 ) . Change quality life determine calculate change score different time-points . Considering mean score difference 5 , 5 % level ( 2-tailed ) 80 % power , sample size 41 yield significant statistical difference . Based clinical research experience population , estimate recruit 50 patient per group 12 month . Qualitative data systematically organize sort use ATLAS.ti 6.2 analyze thematic analysis .</detailed_description>
