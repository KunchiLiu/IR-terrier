	<brief_title>Magnetic Resonance Imaging ( MRI ) Hysterosalpingography Versus Radiographic Hysterosalpingography Female Infertility</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Infertility disease affect around 15 % couple ( one union seven ) increase 10 year . Therefore , due development method medically assist procreation , demand infertility evaluation steadily increase . The infertility evaluation always begin accurate history , couple physical examination partner . Indeed , infertility couple due female partner two third case , male partner remain third case . In woman , main observed cause ovulatory function disorder ( 10 20 % ) , tubal cause proximal distal occlusion ( 10 % ) , uterine cause involve intra-uterine synechiae , leiomyoma , adenomyosis , mucosal polyp ( 5 % ) , inadequate cervical mucus cervical stenosis , peritoneal cause endometriosis post-infectious post-surgical peritubo-ovarian adhesion ( 20 % ) . Medical image one key method identify different etiology men woman . It serve clarify etiology question ass likelihood subsequent pregnancy . The initial imaging assessment infertility woman include endovaginal ultrasound examination hysterosalpingography ( HSG ) . The use MRI consider second line absence definitive diagnosis establish definitive diagnosis consider target therapy . Indeed performance MRI diagnosis pelvic endometriosis fibroid map well establish . HSG image technique choice evaluate morphology uterine cavity tubal patency . But several important limitation . Firstly image method us x-ray therefore delivers irradiation gynecological organ . Moreover , allow precise exploration entire abdomen pelvis : therefore , physician complete assessment etiology infertility HSG . Finally , good specificity relatively low sensitivity .</detailed_description>
