	<brief_summary>Background : - Scientists know alcohol use disorder affect brain structure . They want know effect alcohol use disorder person behavior . They want develop task do inside scanner help well understand effect later study . Objective : - To develop task investigate person behavior use later study . Eligibility : - Inpatient participant another study . They must physically healthy right-handed adult 18 60 year old . - Healthy right-handed volunteer 18 60 year old . Design : - Participants screen medical history physical exam . They EKG record heart activity . They give blood urine sample psychiatric interview . - Participants one three visit . - Participants ask alcohol drink see alcohol use disorder . - Participants complete one three simple computerized task either inside magnetic resonance imagining ( MRI ) scanner outside . - The MRI scanner take picture brain . The scanner metal cylinder . Participants lie table slide cylinder . They scanner 60 minute . They may lie still 20 minute . The scanner make loud knock noise , get earplug .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Objective : The purpose protocol three-fold : 1 ) develop task examine various cognitive , motivational , decision-making behavior outside scanner ; 2 ) modify , refine , verify feasibility applicability task functional magnetic resonance imaging ( fMRI ) measure intend concomitant brain activation ; 3 ) examine equivalent surrogate signal use device electroencephalograph ( EEG ) near infrared spectrometer ( NIRS ) MR contraindication ( ) present participant . Study population : Healthy volunteer without alcohol use disorder , inpatient participant alcohol dependence determine DSM-IV-TR least Moderate Alcohol Use Disorder determine DSM-5 . Design : The participant pilot one aspect study depend whether task de novo modification previously verify publish task . Outcome measure : The outcome develop examine task reliably measure specific cognitive , motivational decision-making behavior invoke associated brain system function target subject population .</detailed_description>
