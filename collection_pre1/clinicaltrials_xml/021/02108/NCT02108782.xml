	<brief_title>Dovitinib Lactate Treating Patients With Pancreatic Neuroendocrine Tumors</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To evaluate efficacy dovitinib ( dovitinib lactate ) patient progressive well-differentiated neuroendocrine tumor pancreas ( PNETs ) reference 6-month progression free survival ( PFS ) historical-controlled patient two cohort define prior vascular endothelial growth factor ( VEGF ) -inhibitor therapy ( Cohort 1 - prior VEGF , Cohort 2 - prior VEGF ) . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . To determine safety dovitinib patient progressive well-differentiated PNETs . II . To evaluate time treatment failure , time progression , overall survival . III . To evaluate radiographic biochemical response rate . TERTIARY OBJECTIVES : I . To assess pharmacodynamic effect dovitinib plasma biomarkers measure concentration circulate growth factor soluble receptor ( e.g . basic fibroblast growth factor [ bFGF ] , VEGF , placental growth factor [ PLGF ] , soluble VEGF receptor 1 ( sVEGFR1 ) 2 , collagen IV , fibroblast growth factor 23 [ FGF23 ] ) . II . Archival tissue collect patient prior registration bank later analyze baseline expression potential biomarkers ( e.g. , bFGF , FGFR ) . OUTLINE : Patients receive dovitinib lactate orally ( PO ) day 1-5 , 8-12 , 15-19 , 22-26 . Courses repeat every 28 day absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . After completion study treatment , patient follow every 2 month 6 month , every 3 month 6 month , periodically 2 year .</detailed_description>
