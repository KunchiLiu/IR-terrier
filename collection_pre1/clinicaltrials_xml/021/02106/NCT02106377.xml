	<brief_summary>Current steroid therapy dry eye disease ( DED ) comprise 2 week duration pulse therapy , administer twice daily ( avoid adverse effect associate long-term steroid use ) . This timeframe often short meaningfully resolve inflammation associate DED . Thus , corneal specialist , include MEEI , begin use steroid treatment least 6 week taper dose . In vivo confocal microscopy ( IVCM ) novel image technology allow visualization quantification certain corneal feature associate DED , hyperfluorescent superficial epithelial cell , immune dendritic cell , sub-basal nerve . Recent cross-sectional study begin shed light correlation feature traditional outcome measure typically assess DED , corneal conjunctival staining , Schirmer 's testing , tear break-up time ( TBUT ) , symptom questionnaire . However , longitudinal study use IVCM demonstrate steroid treatment affect corneal epithelial cell , dendritic cell nerve largely lack . Furthermore , study safety efficacy 6 week taper dose steroid regimen also lack .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Recent study show inflammation play important role pathogenesis Dry Eye Disease ( DED ) . Ocular surface inflammation often exacerbate subject 's sign symptom , result increase immune cell inflammatory mediator locate ocular surface . Dry eye disease one commonly encounter ophthalmic disorder . It multifactorial disease ocular surface tear film , characterize symptom eye irritation , tear instability vision impairment . Despite common , standardized therapy available . Due underlie inflammation associate DED , anti-inflammatory steroid medication use treatment DED . `` Soft steroid '' often preferred chance increase intraocular pressure ( IOP ) low steroid . One `` soft steroid '' commonly use treatment inflammation associate ocular surface disease loteprednol etabonate 0.5 % ophthalmic suspension ( Lotemax , Bausch &amp; Lomb , Inc ) . Current steroid therapy DED comprise pulse therapy ( avoid adverse event associate long-term steroid use ) usually 2 week duration , administer BID . This timeframe often short meaningfully resolve inflammation associate DED . More recently steroid treatment least 6 week taper dose advocate . Lotemax , FDA-approved medication ocular inflammatory disease , commonly use treat inflammation associate DED regimen twice daily 2 week . However , DED chronic disease , short duration steroid therapy may enough meaningfully resolve inflammation associate DED . Thus , corneal specialist , include MEEI , begin use Lotemax least 6 week taper dose . This study design evaluate effect taper regimen inflammation associate DED . Clinical sign symptom use evaluate efficacy treatment DED , include Schirmer 's test , tear break-up test , corneal fluorescein staining , conjunctival lissamine green staining . However , none test evaluate underlying inflammatory immune response change DED . Therefore , determine efficacy treatment DED , ideal evaluate underlying change addition clinical parameter . In vivo confocal microscopy ( IVCM ) novel image technology allow visualization quantification corneal structure cellular level . IVCM recently use evaluate corneal change DED , hyperfluorescent superficial epithelial cell , immune dendritic cell , sub-basal nerve . Therefore , randomize clinical trial , IVCM image use determine change corneal immune cell nerve 6-week taper regimen Lotemax versus Soothe Tired Eyes Lubricant Eye Drop ( Glycerin 1.0 % , Bausch &amp; Lomb Inc. ) ( artificial tear ) treatment inflammation associate DED .</detailed_description>
