	<brief_title>Early In-hospital Initiation Pharmacotherapy Smoking Cessation , Patients After ACS</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Smokers hospitalize Acute Coronary Syndrome ( ACS ) high risk ischemic event death . Over two third patient continue smoke acute myocardial infarction . Study objectives evaluate safety efficacy Varenicline vs. placebo hospitalize ACS patient complement nurse-led support . Interventions continue follow discharge duration 12 week . The primary efficacy outcome measure continuous abstinence rate 1 year hospitalization assess self-reporting verified CO breath test . The propose study prospective , double blind , randomize , placebo control , multi-center study . Overall 300 patient recruit , randomly allocate active placebo treatment group receive nurse-led support train staff . Hospitalized ACS smoker evaluate protocol inclusion/exclusion criterion . Patient 's demographic , medical laboratory data obtain include Fagestrom tobacco addiction questionnaire digitally capture . Participants randomly allocate study group receive , Varenicline placebo , initiate last day hospitalization continue 12 week discharge . Additionally , structure nurse-led behavioral support program smoking cessation initiate hospitalization , follow telephone call provide motivational support interview explore protocol adherence , side effect , change health status smoking status . All patient re-assessed one , 3 12 -months post discharge . Follow-up visit comprise physical examination , adverse event assessment CO breath testing . Cardiovascular disease lead cause death Western country , cigarette smoke clear cause-and -effect relationship atherosclerotic disease ( 1 ) . Smokers hospitalize Acute Coronary Syndrome ( ACS ) high risk subsequent ischemic event present 50 % high chance death first 2 year ( 2 ) . Nevertheless , two third patient continue smoke acute myocardial infarction . Varenicline show highly effective smoking cessation intervention ( 4 ) , yet concern raise regard safety coronary patient ( 5 ) . A significant number eligible patient receive structure smoking cessation intervention follow ACS . Initiation secondary prevention intervention hospital stay show highly effective key secondary prevention intervention ( i.e . statin , beta blocker ) . Moreover , combination Varenicline treatment nurse-led hospital support , initiate early hospitalization expect result well adherence well long-term abstinence rate smoker recent ACS . This propose study would first Israeli trial Varenicline .</detailed_description>
