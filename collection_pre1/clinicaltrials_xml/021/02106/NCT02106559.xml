	<brief_summary>This pilot clinical trial study photodynamic therapy surgery treat patient pleural ( protective lining membrane cover lung chest cavity ) malignancy . Photodynamic therapy anti-cancer treatment combine photosensitizer ( substance make cell sensitive light ) , porfimer sodium , together oxygen visible light kill tumor cell and/or damage tumor 's blood supply . Intraoperative ( surgery ) photodynamic therapy may kill tumor cell remain surgery .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Photodynamic Therapy During Surgery Treating Patients With Pleural Malignancy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES ; I . To determine feasibility toxicity incorporate surgical resection intra-operative Photofrin ( porfimer sodium ) -mediated photodynamic therapy patient ( pt ) malignant pleural mesothelioma ( MPM ) non-small cell lung cancer ( NSCLC ) pleural spread . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . To determine overall survival rate pt NSCLC pleural spread treat standard frontline chemotherapy follow surgical resection intra-operative Photofrin-mediated photodynamic therapy . II . To determine overall survival rate pt MPM radical pleurectomy intraoperative Photofrin-mediated photodynamic therapy ( PDT ) . III . To determine progression-free survival pleural progression-free survival mention pt . IV . To determine absolute Photofrin level tumor normal tissue resect pt use spectrofluorometric assay . Photofrin level tumor normal tissue ratio determine . OUTLINE : Patients receive porfimer sodium intravenously ( IV ) 3-5 minute . Beginning 24 hour later , patient undergo tumor resection and/or radical pleurectomy follow intraoperative PDT pleural space . After completion treatment , patient follow 3 , 6 , 9 , 12 24 month .</detailed_description>
