	<brief_summary>Market trend depicted Agriculture Agri-Food Canada suggest stagnation cheese consumption , potentially important impact key industry Canada . This part due commonly accepted notion saturate fat diet , cheese contributes significantly , increase risk heart disease . Yet , rather large body recent evidence suggest saturate fat may unfairly demonize impact risk heart disease may fact less important originally think . This concept dairy fat increase risk heart attack therefore need revisit , one key objective propose research program . The propose research design investigate first time dairy fat improves level so-called `` good cholesterol '' , protective risk factor essentially ignore argument support reduction saturate fat heart health . Our hypothesis consumption SFA dairy ( cheese ) compare low fat diet diet rich MUFA PUFA lead favorable change plasma HDL-C concentration functional characteristic . Consumption SFA dairy ( cheese ) also increase LDL particle size , reduce inflammation deleterious impact plasma LDL-C apolipoproteins B ( apoB ) concentration compare low fat diet .</brief_summary>
