	<brief_summary>Pathological clinical study consistently demonstrate abnormality thrombosis hemostasis play major role pathogenesis atherosclerosis atherothrombosis . Screening abnormality thrombosis hemostasis measure platelet activity , thrombin generation , marker coagulation propose identify individual high-risk cardiovascular event , however , remain research tool ready implementation standard care . The propose study add grow understanding platelet activity marker coagulation cardiovascular disease ; examine comprehensive battery platelet activity marker , thrombin generation , marker coagulation , inflammatory biomarkers subject undergo vascular surgery ; provide important data mechanism increase platelet activity use micro RNA , RNA DNA expression profiling . The study design prospective main outcome measure platelet activity , coagulation marker incident cardiovascular bleeding event .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The main aim determine whether preoperative platelet activity measurement independently associate short-term cardiovascular event PAD patient undergo open non-emergent low extremity vascular surgery . We characterize platelet phenotype 350 PAD patient vascular surgery use Cox proportional hazard model determine independent association platelet phenotype risk cardiovascular event first 30 day surgery . The next aim determine whether platelet activity measurement independently associate long-term cardiovascular event patient establish PAD . We characterize platelet phenotype follow surgery use Cox proportional hazard model determine independent association platelet phenotype risk long-term composite myocardial infarction , stroke , all-cause mortality mean follow-up 2-years follow vascular surgery . The final goal investigate mRNA-microRNA co-expression profile patient without elevated platelet activity measurement . We establish relationship differentially express microRNAs target mRNAs related platelet activity identify new diagnostic marker potential therapeutic target increase platelet activity . Blood collection three different time point ( surgery , follow surgery still hospital , subject ' first return visit vascular surgeon follow surgery ) allow u assess dynamic change platelet activity , coagulation inflammation perioperative period . We believe marker clot bleed change course surgery , marker may use help predict likelihood develop clot bleed event follow surgery . The long-term goal develop clinically useful assessment platelet activity , thrombin generation , coagulation inflammation risk stratification may ultimately serve target therapeutic intervention .</detailed_description>
