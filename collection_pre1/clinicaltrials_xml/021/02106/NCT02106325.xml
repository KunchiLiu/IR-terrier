	<brief_title>Ketamine Rapidly-Acting Antidepressant Depressed Emergency Department Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Study Objectives To explore use ketamine potential rapidly-acting antidepressant ( RAA ) Emergency Department ( ED ) patient major depressive disorder ( MDD ) . Investigators conduct randomize control study evaluate rapidity persistence antidepressant effect single sub-anesthetic dose intravenous ( IV ) ketamine ( 0.25mg/kg ) equivalent volume diphenhydramine ( 25mg ) deliver IV 1-2 minute , compare measure mood pre- post-infusion Emergency Department ( ED ) patient MDD . Sixty subject randomly assign ( 1:1 ) receive bolus ketamine ( N=30 ) diphenhydramine ( N=30 ) . To supplement self-reported measure depressive symptom ( e.g. , mood , suicidal ideation , etc . ) , investigator obtain objective measure heart rate heart rate variability , measure serum level pro- anti-inflammatory cytokine ( interleukin IL-1 , IL-2 , IL-6 , IL-8 , IL-10 , IL-12 , tissue necrosis factor , TNF-Î± ) , show play important role stress , depression suicidal behavior ( Steptoe 2007 , Pandey 2012 , Zorilla 2001 ) . In addition , investigator obtain serum level brain derive neurotrophic factor ( BDNF ) reduce serum BDNF describe acute depressive episode patient MDD , report rescue effect follow treatment various antidepressant ketamine ( Aydemir 2005 , Gervasoni 2005 , Karege 2002 , Karege 2005 , Duncan 2013 , Shimizu 2003 ) . Investigators also measure serum magnesium level , show correlate predictive manner response conventional antidepressant ( Camardese 2012 ) , data suggest ketamine 's efficacy treatment-resistant depression could relate relative magnesium deficiency patient ( Murck 2013 ) . This study allow investigator determine extent low-dose ketamine , N-Methyl-D-Aspartate ( NMDA ) antagonist , achieve rapid reduction symptom severely depressed ED patient without suicidal ideation . For decade , much high dos IV ketamine ( 1-2mg/kg ) use routinely ED dissociative anesthetic ( Green 2011 ) . In 2011 , open-label study first publish use low dose ketamine ( 0.2mg/kg ) , administer rapid intravenous infusion , ED set acutely depressed patient demonstrated feasibility , safety , preliminary efficacy acceptability ED patient staff ( Larkin 2011 ) . One long-term goal research expand treatment option available depressed ED patient mitigate need inpatient admission serve safety bridge future out-patient treatment major depression . As adjunct standard treatment , low-dose NMDA receptor antagonists potential positively impact : ED wait time ; repeat visit ED ; short-term risk suicide attempt ; length stay inpatient unit need hospital admission many acutely depressed patient .</detailed_description>
