	<brief_summary>This PI-initiated study aim evaluate efficacy two different method paroxysmal atrial fibrillation ( PAF ) ablation . There currently two strategy PAF ablation routinely perform electrophysiology clinician : ( 1 ) circumferential pulmonary vein ablation ( CPVA ) ( 2 ) segmental pulmonary vein isolation ( SPVI ) . However , know one approach well . This randomized study evaluate compare efficacy CPVA versus SPVI subject undergoing ablation paroxysmal atrial fibrillation . Subjects 50/50 chance receive either CPVA SPVI ablation method .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Effectiveness Study Circumferential vs. Segmental Ablation Paroxysmal Atrial Fibrillation</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Despite decade clinical experience investigation , optimal approach ablation paroxysmal atrial fibrillation ( PAF ) still remain controversial . There currently two strategy ablation PAF : ( 1 ) circumferential pulmonary vein ablation ( CPVA ) ( 2 ) segmental pulmonary vein isolation ( SPVI ) . There advantage disadvantage associate method . In CPVA method ( 1 ) , contiguous ablation lesion create encircle two leave right pulmonary vein ( PVs ) , guide three-dimensional ( 3D ) electroanatomic mapping system ( Carto , Biosense Webster , Inc. ESI NavX , St. Jude , Inc. ) 3D leave atrial ( LA ) geometry create either use mapping catheter import pre-recorded 3D compute tomography ( CT ) image . In SPVI method ( 2 ) , electrical potential record PV ostium , represent myocardial connection LA PVs , ablate PV ostium proximal PV ostium PV antrum . In approach , ablation perform segmentally multiple site around PV ostium antrum , map circular catheter demonstrate pulmonary vein isolation . The reported success rate SPVI prevention recurrence PAF range 60-87 % ( 2-4 ) recurrence associate recovery PV conduction . Therefore , success SPVI treatment PAF appear relate large part permanent elimination trigger AF . In retrospective study Sawhney et al , overall 5-year outcome SPVI PAF similar short-term follow less equal 2 year . However , late recurrence 2 year occur ( 22.5 % ) repeat ablation often require maintain freedom symptomatic PAF ( 5 ) . Even though success rate CPVA report high ( 90 % ) , CPVA procedures previously report included leave atrial linear ablation ( LALA ) , additional ablation lesion line connect mitral valve posterior pulmonary vein along roof leave atrium . Thus success CPVA may due part ablation substantially large amount atrial tissue ( 6-7 ) . However , additional ablation ( LALA ) may cause potential pro-arrhythmic effect lead development atypical leave atrial flutter ( 8 ) . Compared SPVI , CPVA result high success rate low fluoroscopy time one study Arentz et al ( 9 ) . However , study include subject PAF persistent AF , persistent AF potentially different underlie mechanism . Furthermore , two randomized study compare efficacy PVI CPVA show conflict result ( 10-11 ) . Thus , initiate randomize controlled study evaluate efficacy CPVA versus SPVI subject undergoing ablation paroxysmal atrial fibrillation .</detailed_description>
