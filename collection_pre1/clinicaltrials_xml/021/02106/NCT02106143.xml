	<brief_summary>Cryotherapy long history safe use various medical procedure . RejuvenAir System radial spray cryotherapy novel procedure develop treatment condition associate abnormal bronchial function , chronic bronchitis . The development appropriate reliable equipment , definition therapeutic parameter , understand tissue effect treatment establish animal study . This clinical study undertaken ass feasibility safety application radial meter dose spray cryotherapy human airway evaluate treatment depth human airway . The study design prospective , open label , single arm multi-center study consist 15 subject 3 enrol site Ireland , UK The Netherlands RejuvenAir System treatment perform preoperative bronchoscopy 0 60 day prior prescheduled lung resection Subjects require lobectomy pneumonectomy removal peripheral tumor . Treatment limit area bronchi within lobe remove , distal anticipate margin resection . Treatment least 1 cm bronchial resection margin away tumor bed . Treated airways inspect via bronchoscopy time thoracotomy , examine histologically follow surgical resection . Subject participation 1 60 day enrollment anticipated take 4-5 months.Total study duration expect last approximately 10 month .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The patient population intend participate study subject schedule undergo lobectomy/pneomonectomy peripheral lung lesion suspicious know cancer . The intention spray cryotherapy dose perform surgical session intend surgery . Bronchoscopy routinely perform prior start lung resection anticipate spray cryotherapy dose deliver time . Care take avoid administration spray cryotherapy dose near surgical resection margin near lung lesion . A secondary endpoint beyond safety ease delivery spray cryotherapy dose analysis local tissue effect spray cryotherapy dose . Given area reside within anticipate resected surgical specimen , treatment site inspect evidence depth tissue effect use routine hematoxylin eosin stain light microscopy evaluation .</detailed_description>
