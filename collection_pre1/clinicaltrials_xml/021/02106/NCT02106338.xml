	<detailed_description>This Phase I , single center , randomize , placebo-controlled , double-blind , multiple ascend dose study evaluate safety tolerability CRS3123 , fully synthetic , oral , antimicrobial target methionyl-tRNA synthetase gram-positive bacteria , include Clostridium difficile . This protocol study oral dos 200 , 400 , 600 mg , 100mg give orally every 12 hour 10 day . Subjects divide 3 cohort , A , B , C. Cohorts A C give 200mg 600mg CRS3123 placebo.The dose cohort B study progression dose escalation Cohorts B C require full ( plan ) SMC review safety data obtain Day 18 . Should safety data review 200 mg dose result unfavorable safety profile , study design allow reduction dose 100 mg give Cohort B . If case , Cohort C. Up 30 healthy male female subject 18 45 year , inclusive . The primary objective : study determine safety tolerability escalate dos CRS3123 follow oral administration multiple dose healthy adult . The secondary objective determine plasma , urine fecal concentration systemic exposure CRS3123 multiple oral doses.The study duration 46 week .</detailed_description>
