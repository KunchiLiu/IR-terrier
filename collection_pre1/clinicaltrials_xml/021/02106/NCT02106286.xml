	<brief_summary>A major determinant perioperative mortality inability heart increase output response surgical stress . This term perioperative cardiac failure ( PCF ) , may apparent postoperatively oxygen demand increase . The risk perioperative cardiac complication summation individual patient 's risk cardiac stress related surgical procedure1 . The functional capacity patient determine ability support postoperative demand increase oxygen consumption , therefore cardiac output . Exercise capacity one powerful predictor cardiovascular cause mortality2 . Cardiopulmonary exercise test ( CPET ) establish investigation use , among application , preoperative assessment patient fitness surgery3 . CPET involve monitor electrocardiographic trace exhale gas mixture ( particularly CO2 , whose production depend aerobic metabolism ) , incremental exercise ( usually exercise bike ) , room air . Several parameter measure CPET , include maximal systemic oxygen delivery , anaerobic threshold ( oxygen delivery value anaerobic metabolism begin ) , maximum workload , ST segment depression/elevation ( standard exercise tolerance test ) . The cardiopulmonary `` performance '' CPET correlate postoperative outcome3 . Pulmonary function test perform order ass lung function . It well know therapy beta-blockers patient ischaemic heart disease cardiac failure reduces perioperative morbidity mortality4-7 . However , beta blocker reduce myocardial contractility heart rate response adrenergic stimulation , thus blunt physiological response stress/surgery/exercise . Whilst mechanism may protect heart perioperatively , may decrease ability patient withstand complication . This potential decrease `` performance '' never quantify . There agreement whether preoperative CPET perform beta-blockers , Aintree particular , standard procedure take patient beta-blockers prior CPET . Some argue , beta-blockade maintain perioperative period , CPET perform medication , even could mask presence significant ischaemic heart disease ( significant , modifiable , risk factor surgery beta blockade ) , even always possible maintain beta-blockade throughout whole postoperative period . For reason , clinician prefer perform CPET beta-blockers , thus , potentially , overestimate perioperative cardiorespiratory `` performance '' , may diminish medication resume . Patients long-term beta blockade may develop tolerance medication , effect acute chronic beta blockade cardiorespiratory performance may also different . Aim To compare cardiopulmonary performance beta blocker objectively assess cardiopulmonary exercise testing .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Study design We propose interventional study investigate effect acute chronic beta-blockade cardiorespiratory performance prior elective surgery . We aim recruit 64 abdominal aortic aneurysm ( AAA ) patient surveillance undergo 2 cardiopulmonary exercise test investigate effect beta blockade cardiopulmonary performance . This sample size calculate use 2-tailed sample t-test , 90 % power detect estimate increase 10 % oxygen delivery ( VO2 ) anaerobic threshold . We also estimate drop-out rate 25 % built power calculation estimate . Interventions Patients long term beta blockade study investigate effect chronic beta blocker use . They undergo two CPETs , first beta blocker , second discontinue beta blocker least 48 hour . Patients beta blocker study investigate effect acute beta blockade . They undergo two CPETs , first medication , second commencement beta blockade ( weight adjust , start 48 hour prior CPET ) . Potential subject provide patient information sheet clinic , 1-2 week prior initial CPET . They give least 1 week consider study investigator follow via telephone call . Informed consent participate study obtain initial ( standard care ) CPET . All consent subject perform exercise use electro-magnetically braked equipment ramped-incremental protocol two different occasion . Prior test full lung function test perform body plethysmography . The exercise test perform subject wear nose clip breathe mouthpiece throughout test . The initial cycling workload zero progressively increase rate 10-15 Watts/min . After rest period 30 second 2 minute warm subject stop cycle . All gas exchange parameter measure metabolic cart , heart rate oxygen saturation monitor pre post testing . Subjects also ask score perceived breathlessness leg fatigue use modified Borg score every minute exercise , inspiratory capacity measure every minute exercise test . At end test , give date 2nd CPET prescription oral bisoprolol daily ( dose adjust patient body weight ) , start 48 hour prior test ( two dos total ) . Patients informed potential side effect medication visit . This weight adjust specific dose follow : 1.25 mg patent weigh 50-75 kg , 2.5 mg 75-100 kg 3.75 mg &gt; 100 kg . Patients attend 2nd CPET , follow bisoprolol discontinue continue base clinical indication . If patient already chronically beta blocker , first CPET medication , ask stop medication period 48 hour second CPET . It standard procedure take patient beta blocker prior CPET Aintree University Hospital . Patients informed potential risk stop beta blocker first visit . The beta blocker restart discontinue base clinical indication second CPET .</detailed_description>
