	<criteria>Histologically confirm adenocarcinoma prostate without neuroendocrine differentiation small cell feature progressive metastatic disease base following : Rise PSA : minimum 3 rising level , interval least 1 week determination . The last determination must value ≥ 2 ng/mL , obtain within 4 week start study drug , Measurable disease : new progressive soft tissue disease CT MRI scan , Radionuclide bone scan : least 2 new bone lesion , define PCWG2 criteria1 Castrationresistant prostate cancer : patient must surgical ongoing chemical ( androgen deprivation therapy ) castration , baseline testosterone level ≤ 50 ng/dL determine within 4 week start study drug . DoseEscalation : Prior treatment abiraterone acetate . At least 4 week must elapse last dose abiraterone acetate . Expansion Cohort ( conduct study ) : Men mCRPC disease progression define PCWG2 within 3 month ( primary resistance ) ; least 6 month treatment ( acquire resistance ) start treatment abiraterone acetate . At least 4 week must elapse last dose abiraterone .acetate Physiologic dose corticosteroid allow ( i.e . 10 mg prednisone daily ) . Patients currently receive bone loss prevention treatment ( e.g . bisphosphonates , denosumab , etc . ) must stable dose least 4 week prior start study treatment . Patients receive first generation antiandrogen ( e.g. , bicalutamide , flutamide , nilutamide ) part firstline hormonal therapy must show progression disease antiandrogen prior enrollment . At least 4 week must elapse use androgen receptor antagonist ( e.g. , bicalutamide , flutamide , nilutamide ) ; 5α reductase inhibitor ( e.g. , dutasteride , finasteride , aminoglutethimide ) ; estrogens ; ketoconazole anticancer pharmacologic therapy prior enrollment . At least 6 week must elapse use bicalutamide use part initial combine androgen blockage therapy 6 month use second line hormonal therapy associate PSA response least 3 month duration . At least 12 week must elapse use Strontium89 , Radium223 investigational approve immunotherapy ( e.g. , Provenge ) prior start study drug . At least 4 week must elapse use investigational agent prior start study drug . At least 4 week must elapse major surgery prior start study drug . Patients treat , nonprogressive epidural disease eligible . At least 18 year age , life expectancy least 3 month . ECOG performance status 0 1 ( 2 allow due bone pain ) . Toxicities related prior therapy must either return ≤ Grade 1 , baseline , deem irreversible . Physical laboratory test finding : Adequate hepatic function serum bilirubin ≤ 1.5 time upper institutional limit normal ( ULN ) , ALT AST ≤ 2.5 x ULN . Patients history Gilbert 's syndrome may enrol total bilirubin &lt; 3 mg/dL predominance indirect bilirubin Adequate renal function serum creatinine ≤ 1.5 x ULN Adequate hematologic function absolute neutrophil count ≥ 1,500 cells/mm3 , platelet ≥ 100,000 cells/mm3 hemoglobin value ≥ 9 g/dL ( Note : patient whose anemia correct hemoglobin value ≥ 9 g/dL blood transfusion allow ) Electrolytes ( include potassium , sodium , serum calcium correct albumin ionized calcium ) must within normal limit Adequate blood clotting time INR &lt; 2 Signed date informed consent document indicate patient ( legally acceptable representative ) inform pertinent aspect trial prior enrollment . Willingness ability comply schedule visit , treatment plan , laboratory test , study procedure . Prior treatment apalutamide , PI3K/mTOR pathway inhibitor . History , current metastasis brain , meninges , untreated spinal cord compression . Patients previously treat chemotherapy mCRPC . At least 12 month must elapse chemotherapy give adjuvant neoadjuvant setting . History malignancy within previous 5 year except follow : adequately treat basal cell squamous cell skin cancer , superficial bladder cancer , stage I II cancer currently complete remission , cancer complete remission least 5 year . History seizure condition may predispose seizure ( e.g. , prior stroke within 1 year start study drug , brain arteriovenous malformation ) Concurrent therapy medication know seizure potential Known intolerance hypersensitivity Vitamin E , everolimus rapamycin derivative . Use herbal product may decrease PSA level ( e.g. , saw palmetto ) . Known human immunodeficiency virus ( HIV ) infection . Patients receive live attenuate vaccine within 1 week start Everolimus study . Patient also avoid close contact others receive live attenuate vaccine . Examples live attenuate vaccine include intranasal influenza , measles , mumps , rubella , oral polio , BCG , yellow fever , varicella TY21a typhoid vaccine . Patients history noncompliance medical regimen consider potentially unreliable able complete entire study . Patients currently part participate clinical investigation investigational drug within 1 month prior dose . Male patient whose sexual partner ( ) woman childbearing potential ( WOCBP ) willing use adequate contraception , study 8 week end treatment . Highly effective contraception method include combination two follow ( a+b a+c b+c ) : 1 . Use oral , injected implant hormonal method contraception ; 2 . Placement intrauterine device ( IUD ) intrauterine system ( IUS ) ; 3 . Barrier method contraception : condom occlusive cap ( diaphragm cervical/vault cap ) spermicidal foam/gel/film/cream/ vaginal suppository ; 4 . Total abstinence ; 5 . Male/female sterilization . Patients know impairment gastrointestinal ( GI ) function GI disease may significantly alter absorption oral Everolimus . Patients uncontrolled diabetes mellitus define HbA1c &gt; 8 % despite adequate therapy . Patients known history impair fast glucose diabetes mellitus ( DM ) may include , however blood glucose antidiabetic treatment must monitor closely throughout trial adjust necessary . Patients severe and/or uncontrolled medical condition : i. unstable angina pectoris , symptomatic congestive heart failure , myocardial infarction ≤6 month prior start Everolimus , serious uncontrolled cardiac arrhythmia , clinically significant cardiac disease ii . Symptomatic congestive heart failure New York heart Association Class III IV iii . active ( acute chronic ) uncontrolled severe infection , liver disease cirrhosis , decompensated liver disease , chronic hepatitis ( i.e . quantifiable HBVDNA and/or positive HbsAg , quantifiable HCVRNA ) , iv . know severely impaired lung function ( spirometry DLCO 50 % less normal O2 saturation 88 % less rest room air ) , v. active , bleeding diathesis ;</criteria>
