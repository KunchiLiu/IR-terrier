	<brief_summary>Current image device usually detect cancer prior surgery . However , device use surgical procedure visualize lymph node cancer ( call `` sentinel lymph node '' ) . The group head neck melanoma , gynecologic , breast cancer . As part standard care , initially undergo image lymph node prior surgery . Melanoma breast cancer patient inject radioactive dye around tumor site , image acquire 2 hour location later use device image dye . For gynecologic cancer patient , inject indocyanine green operating room image acquire soon . In addition , investigator test , first time human , new , experimental dye-labeled particle ( dot ) , cRGDY-PEG-Cy5.5-C dot lymph node mapping . This particle , size small protein , inject around site melanoma surgery identify diseased node use hand-held camera system . The dye-labeled particle view tissue may contain tumor . Based upon clinical diagnosis , patient may procedure call Reverse Lymphatic Mapping , new form sentinel lymph node mapping . The doctor discus patient . If patient undergoing reverse lymphatic mapping , experimental particle inject hand foot ( base tumor type ) standard care injection inject around tumor . This allow surgeon remove lymph node directly link tumor . The particle treat cancer image information find study use treatment . The information collect may use guide design future study detect and/or treat tumor .</brief_summary>
