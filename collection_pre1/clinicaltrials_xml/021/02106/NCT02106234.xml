	<brief_summary>Contrast-induced nephropathy ( CIN ) side-effect intravascular administration iodinate contrast material . It define absolute ( &gt; 44μmol/l ) relative ( &gt; 25 % ) increase serum creatinine baseline value within 48-72 hour iodinate contrast material administration , usually resolve within two week . In case CIN associate persistent renal failure , increase risk dialysis , mortality . It clear however , whether CIN causally relate increase risk whether risk morbidity mortality inherent risk CIN . CIN asymptomatic treatment CIN exist . Therefore , focus lie prevention . Prevention guideline drawn country implement radiological department . In Netherlands , currently two guideline prevention CIN coexist , issue CBO ( Centraal BegeleidingsOrgaan ) VMS ( Veiligheids Management Systeem ) . The prevention guideline aim increase patient safety identify patient may risk CIN ( mostly patient chronic renal insufficiency ) , subsequently administer prophylactic intravenous hydration identify patient , order prevent CIN ( intravenous normal saline 4-12 hour 4-12 hour exposure iodinate contrast material ) . Needless say , introduction guideline great impact patient- health care burden . In Netherlands alone estimate yearly 100.000 150.000 patient receive prophylactic treatment , incur total cost 50 million Euro . Considering steady yearly increase contrast procedure age population , evident , future , number shall increase . The prophylactic treatment prescribe guideline base consensus opinion expert general agreement treatment beneficial . However , effectiveness prophylactic hydration never adequately evaluate . Sufficiently large randomise trial compare prophylactic intravenous hydration proper control group receive prophylactic treatment available , baseline CIN incidence untreated population unknown . Thus , clear whether prophylactic hydration achieves aim prevent CIN . In order able take effective measure benefit patient safety , important distinguish mechanism underlie CIN ensue increase risk morbidity mortality : whether biological variation serum creatinine , renal damage , cholesterol embolism ; whether causality exists iodinate contrast material ; whether prophylactic intravenous hydration prevent occur without incur risk remove . These , short , aim AMACING study .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Maastricht Contrast-Induced Nephropathy Guidelines Study : CIN Prevention Guidelines : Appropriate &amp; Cost-effective ?</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Studies evaluate effect various prophylactic treatment invariably focus CIN instead clinically relevant measure primary outcome . CIN asymptomatic , important determine whether prophylactic treatment preventive effect clinically relevant endpoint sometimes associate CIN , dialysis mortality . Consider example : even transpire prophylactic treatment reduces CIN incidence , may intravenous hydration merely dilute serum creatinine extent mask CIN , protective effect renal function . It show change volume status influence serum creatinine level , potential dilution effect intravenous hydration investigate date . On hand , important realise prophylactic intravenous hydration without risk . Patients may suffer mild serious complication range phlebitis pulmonary oedema , latter potentially fatal . Those patient select accord guideline risk CIN - risk factor include poor renal function , age , diabetes cardiac disease - especially sensitive complication intravenous hydration . The risk intravenous hydration population yet chart , take account guideline prevention CIN . It stand reason patient 's pre-existing hydration status may determine factor net effect intravenous hydration : treatment dehydrate patient may enjoy benefit , whereas overhydrated patient may suffer complication . The importance hydration status determine effect prophylactic hydration , however , investigated date . The mechanism prophylactic hydration may protect renal function injury iodinate contrast material unclear , mechanism iodinate contrast material may induce CIN unclear . Indeed , patient chronic renal insufficiency biological variation serum creatinine absence contrast material show indistinguishable CIN . The question arisen recent literature whether CIN anything asymptomatic increase serum creatinine , lack prognostic negative impact , significantly different observe control receive iodinate contrast material . Recent study compare patient chronic renal deficiency receive intravascular iodinate contrast material patient receive iodinated contrast material find association increase serum creatinine ( CIN ) contrast administration . Indeed , suggest renal damage intra-arterial procedure cause , contrast material , cholesterol embolism arise erosion aortic atheromatous plaque catheter use procedure . It perhaps importance note relatively recently , monomeric non-ionic low-osmolar iodinate contrast material - less toxic property 'traditional ' contrast material - introduce widely use , perhaps alter landscape CIN . Patient Risk Any risk incur participate AMACING study due receive prophylactic intravenous hydration . The true risk incur foregoing prophylactic treatment unknown ; however , recent literature suggest likely minimal . The estimation risk CIN accord current guideline largely base renal function eGFR threshold &lt; 60 ml/min/1.73 m2 combination risk factor currently apply prophylactic hydration accord Dutch guideline . The incidence chronic kidney disease stage 3 ( eGFR 30-60 ml/min/1,73m2 ) Netherlands 5.3 % , estimate third eGFR &lt; 45 ml/min/1,73m2 . The European Society Urogenital Radiology update CIN prevention guideline 2011 indicate intravenous prophylactic hydration unnecessary patient eGFR ≥45 ml/min/1.73m2 intravenous contrast administration . Risk analyse reveal intravenous contrast administration impose nephrotoxic risk eGFR 30ml/min/1.73m2 . Indeed , zero incidence dialysis mortality consistently report intravenous contrast administration , even patient severe renal insufficiency ( eGFR &lt; 30 ) absence prophylactic treatment . Since intravenous contrast administration procedure make estimate 70 % contrast procedure imply prophylactic intravenous hydration superfluous majority patient currently receive . This patient population also large proportion patient include randomize control trial - estimate 75 % - therefore think incur risk participation receive prophylactic intravenous hydration . Other patient shall include may incur risk CIN : eGFR 30-44 ml/min/1.73m2 , administer iodinated contrast material intra-arterially . The risk CIN first group appear much elevate . A pooled overview study involve iodinated contrast material administration without prophylactic intravenous hydration yield CIN incidence 3.9 % : 83 % patient diagnose CIN eGFR ≥45 ml/min/1.73 m2 . Baseline eGFR CIN case publish . As second group , although case long term adverse effect dialysis mortality rarely report follow CIN intravenous contrast administration , report intra-arterial contrast administration . It think , therefore , intra-arterial administration lead nefarious effect iodinate contrast material intravenous administration . This , however , repeatedly put question . A recent study find difference risk CIN intra-arterial intravenous contrast administration adjustment make patient related risk factor . Several study find increase risk CIN intra-arterial contrast administration compare intravenous administration , one report even go previous literature , report high risk morbidity mortality intravenous contrast administration intra-arterial administration . In short , clear whether increase risk dialysis mortality arise contrast administration CIN whether inherent patient population study ( i.e . population require intra-arterial contrast procedure require prophylactic hydration accord CIN prevention guideline may conceivably increase inherent risk ) . Indeed , chronic kidney disease , main criterion guideline increase risk CIN , increase risk all-cause mortality , cardiovascular disease progression kidney failure . Causality increase serum creatinine contrast administration ( CIN ) adverse event show exist . A recent meta-analysis McDonald et al include 157 140 contrast procedure show difference incidence CIN , dialysis , death patient group receive contrast material versus patient receive contrast material ( 7.2 % CIN contrast-enhanced scan versus 11.1 % CIN unenhanced scan medium- high-risk population , suggest contrast material may causally relate CIN ) . More opinion rise , occur , risk inherent specific population lead high morbidity/mortality incidence CIN specific administration route , CIN merely marker population instead causal relationship CIN morbidity/mortality , even causal relationship diagnose CIN intravascular contrast material administration . On hand evidence prophylactic intravenous hydration protective effect renal function . Almost study evaluate prophylactic intravenous hydration date uncontrolled trial retrospective cohort analysis , often involve experimental addition standard administration saline prescribe guideline , thus conclusion effectiveness drawn . In recent Dutch study CIN , 35 454 patient risk CIN accord current guideline receive prophylactic intravenous hydration ( reason unexplained ) ; yet incidence CIN subgroup significantly high found population receive prophylactic treatment ( 1/35 2.9 % , versus 10/419 2.4 % ) . Furthermore , study include patient receive contrast material without prophylactic intravenous hydration ( 94 % patient undergo prophylactic intravenous hydration study ) , severely diminished renal function ( 49.3 % patient ) , low CIN incidence see ( range : 1.3 % - 5.2 % ; pool incidence 3.6 % ) , zero long term adverse effect report . Another issue prophylactic intravenous hydration without risk . Complications may occur , especially patient cardiac and/or kidney disease , pulmonary oedema and/or cardiac failure could lead respiratory insufficiency . There considerable overlap patient consider risk develop CIN patient risk complication prophylactic intravenous hydration , therefore real concern clinical practice . A study perform Dutch hospital use Dutch CIN prevention guideline report incidence serious complication intravenous hydration 1.4 % hydrated patient . The incidence clinically relevant event CIN &lt; 1 % monomeric non-ionic low-osmolar iodinate contrast material use , thus put appropriateness prophylactic treatment question , highlight importance evaluation proper control group receive intravenous hydration . The AMACING study pivotal decide future role prophylactic intravenous hydration routine clinical practice . Considering potential benefit result study large population - perhaps burden unnecessary sometimes harmful treatment - potential benefit health care system term efficiency cost , believe risk patient include RCT acceptable . The incidence CIN low , CIN direct relevant clinical implication , prophylactic intravenous hydration may negative effect largely disregard . Based current evidence , therefore , see ethical barrier perform RCT study population . Importantly , include patient eGFR &lt; 30 ml/min/1.73m2 even though probability even patient great risk without intravenous hydration , include procedure involve non-ionic low osmolality monomer contrast material .</detailed_description>
