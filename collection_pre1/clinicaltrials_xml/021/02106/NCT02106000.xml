	<brief_summary>The purpose study record compare inhalation profile non pregnant woman third stage labour . The inhalation profile record consent woman inhale maximal effort inhalation profile recorder [ Glaxosmithkline ( GSK ) , Ware ] . The recorder simulate resistance airflow representative dry powder inhaler moderate resistivity . The inhalation endpoint include Peak Pressure Drop , Peak Inspiratory Flow Rate , Inhaled Volume , Inhalation time , Average Inhalation Flow Rate Acceleration rate compare two female cohort . Inhalation profile record way may subsequently use study in-vitro performance investigational material across inhalation parameter representative target patient population . An appropriate number subject consent approximately 40 subject ( 20 non-pregnant female 20 stage three labour subject ) complete assessment .
