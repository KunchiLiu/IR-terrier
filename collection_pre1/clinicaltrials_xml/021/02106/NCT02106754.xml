This proposal target area interest . In addition , investigator study implementation Brief Intervention ( BI ) associate Screener . There great need screen BI juvenile probation setting many youth great need underserved.Many probation department turn BI work probationer parolee . Screening BI demonstrate efficacy setting , yet randomize control trial conduct evaluate effectiveness juvenile probation setting . Probation Officers ( POs ; n=40 ) randomize Screener ( S ) , Screener+BI ( SBI ) , coach ( CSBI ) . Youths ( N=1000 ) randomize 1 3 condition , receive usual service ( US ) . US consist regular check-in PO access referral service need ( counsel , academic tutoring , etc. ) . Research staffer conduct in-depth assessment baseline , 6- 12- month . Sensitivity , specificity , positive negative predictive power ( SN , SP , PP , NP ) calculate predict alcohol risk consequence , well risky behavior concurrently prospectively across age-groups . A 1-way design ( S vs SBI v CSBI ) use determine whether SBI CSBI enhance youth services-use reduce risk ( e.g. , alcohol use , risky sex ) . We examine moderator outcome ( youth age , PO characteristic ) whether coach ( important consideration implementation science ) use BI improve outcomes . This study first randomize control trial evaluate effectiveness SBI juvenile probation setting .</brief_summary>
