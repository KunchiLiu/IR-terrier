	<brief_summary>Although clinical outcome patient Invasive Aspergillosis ( IA ) largely dependent early initiation effective treatment antifungal drug , diagnose IA still critical problem . Symptoms non-specific available diagnostic tool either invasive low sensitivity specificity . This often result diagnostic delay , patient develop extensive disease . Furthermore , long IA present , oncological follow-up treatment feasible . Inaccuracy diagnose IA cause serious treatment delay increase mortality . However , empirical strategy prophylactic anti-mould therapy feasible consider possible side effect cost . In order safely continue use pre-empirical strategy , improve ( non-invasive ) diagnostic tool desirable . In pilot study de Heer et al . show possible discriminate patient IA neutropenic control exhale breath analysis use electronic nose ( eNose ) . In study investigator aim test whether eNose could useful diagnostic tool prospective setting . The gold standard exhale breath analysis Gas Chromatography - Mass Spectrometry ( GC-MS ) . This technique enable identification volatile organic compound ( VOCs ) breath patient . It possible Aspergillus specific VOCs breath patient IA . The composition lung microbiome seem important factor health disease . It likely microbiome lung change prolong neutropenia , therefore possibly create niche mold yeast . Comparing microbiome patient prolong neutropenia develop IA , learn u pathogenesis disease . This knowledge could use investigate new treatment option Invasive Aspergillosis . Hypothesis The investigator hypothesize airway microbial ( viral , bacterial ) presence exhale molecular profile obtain patient prolonged neutropenia due treatment hematological malignancy , different patient develop IA patient .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Aims 1 . To compare exhaled molecular profile ( GC-MS eNose ) neutropenic patient develop IA neutropenic control . 2 . To investigate whether exhaled molecular profile serve surrogate predict IA early stage . 3 . To compare alteration viral/bacterial microbial profile neutropenic episode patient develop IA control . 4 . To examine relationship microbial molecular profile order generate mechanistic hypothesis .</detailed_description>
