	<brief_summary>The purpose study determine whether AFM11 safe active treatment relapse and/or refractory Non-Hodgkin Lymphoma ( NHL ) .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Safety Study Assess AFM11 Patients With Relapsed and/or Refractory CD19 Positive B-cell NHL</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>CD19 present B-cells early recognizable B-lineage cell development B-cell blast lose upon maturation plasma cell . Expression CD19 B-cells various development stage make ideal target treat B-cell associate malignancies.The rationale use AFM11 base ability bind malignant cell via anti-CD19 domain T-cells via anti-CD3 domain . This result formation `` immunological synapse '' subsequent T-cell activation lead kill malignant cell .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Patients CD19+ , relapse refractory histologically ( WHO classification ) confirm follicular lymphoma , marginal zone lymphoma , lymphoplasmocytic lymphoma , mantle cell lymphoma , diffuse large Bcell lymphoma , mediastinal Bcell lymphoma , transform Bcell lymphomas . Patients either indolent aggressive NHL . Patients relapsed refractory approve standard therapy , must include 1 treatment line rituximab plus chemotherapy , candidate bone marrow transplant curative intent . Measurable disease ( least 1 lesion ≥ 1.5 cm ) document CT scan . Disease progression require therapy . Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group ( ECOG ) performance status ≤ 2 . Total number Bcells ( healthy malignant combine ) peripheral blood exceeds upper physiological limit ( per institutional guidance ) total Bcell count healthy individual . Autologous Hematopoietic stem cell transplant ( HSCT ) within 12 week prior start AFM11 treatment . Prior allogeneic HSCT . Abnormal hematological laboratory value define : 1 . Peripheral lymphocyte count &gt; 20 × 10^9/L 2 . Platelet count ≤ 75,000/µL 3 . Hemoglobin level ≤ 9 g/dL . Known suspected central nervous system ( CNS ) involvement . 1 . History current relevant CNS pathology epilepsy , seizure , paresis , aphasia , apoplexia , severe brain injury , cerebellar disease , organic brain syndrome , and/or psychosis . 2 . Evidence presence malignant disease , inflammatory lesion , and/or vasculitis cerebral MRI . 3 . Infiltration cerebrospinal fluid malignant Bcells , confirm lumbar puncture . Cancer chemotherapy within 4 week prior start AFM11 treatment , least 4 time respective halflives , whichever longer . Radiotherapy within 4 week prior start AFM11 treatment . Therapy antibody , antibody construct within 4 week prior start AFM11 treatment , least 4 time respective halflives , whichever longer . Prior treatment alemtuzumab ( Campath® ) within 12 week prior start AFM11 treatment . Treatment investigational agent within 4 week prior start AFM11 treatment , least 4 time respective halflife , whichever longer . Abnormal renal hepatic function follow : aspartate aminotransferase ( AST serum glutamic oxaloacetic transaminase [ SGOT ] ) and/or alanine aminotransferase ( ALT serum glutamic pyruvic transaminase [ SGPT ] ) ≥ 2.5 × upper limit normal ( ULN ) ; total bilirubin ≥ 1.5 × ULN ; serum creatinine ≥ 2 × ULN ; creatinine clearance &lt; 50 mL/minute . History malignancy Bcell lymphoma within 5 year prior study entry , exception basal cell carcinoma skin carcinoma situ cervix . Active autoimmune disease require systemic immunosuppressive treatment . Uncontrolled infection ; know bacteremia . Regular dose corticosteroid 4 week prior start AFM11 treatment anticipate need continuous corticosteroid exceed prednisone 20 mg/day equivalent , immunosuppressive therapy within 4 week prior start AFM11 treatment . Known infection human immunodeficiency virus ( HIV ) chronic infection hepatitis B hepatitis C virus .
