	<brief_summary>This quality life study do context randomize trial pancreatic cancer . Patients locally advance metastatic pancreatic adenocarcinoma receive either combination nab-paclitaxel gemcitabine exist standard gemcitabine alone treatment.The combination regimen nab-paclitaxel gemcitabine administer patient locally advance metastatic pancreatic cancer first line set show improved efficacy acceptable toxicity . The current study design allow patient standard treatment receive combination treatment tumour progression . The propose study explore impact treatment quality life compare time definitive deterioration quality life score use validated EORTC QLQ-C30 .
