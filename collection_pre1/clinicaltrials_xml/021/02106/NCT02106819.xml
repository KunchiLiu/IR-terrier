	<brief_summary>The cerebellum link cognitive emotional function increase evidence damage posterior portion cerebellum result frontal-executive , visuospatial , verbal deficit , include dysprosodia , affective change include blunt affect disinhibited inappropriate behavior . Based preliminary clinical observation test perform investigator 's clinic , disorder emotional communication may also associate cerebellar dysfunction . Emotional communication include production comprehension facial prosodic expression critical maintain positive supportive relationship . Deficits emotional communication devastate effect relationship quality life affect . Although deficit affect prosody report association posterior cerebellar disorder , currently study systematically investigate emotional communication individual cerebellar dysfunction . It know cerebellum strong connection cerebral cortex , especially frontal lobe , cortical damage stroke neurodegenerative disease result disorder emotional communication . Impairments integrity cerebellar-cerebral network cerebellar disease may produce similar deficit emotional communication . The purpose study systematically investigate describe deficit emotional communication series patient cerebellar disease . Participants individual diagnose posterior cerebellar degeneration damage non-hemorrhagic infarction , age-matched neurologically healthy control . Assessment include battery test neuropsychological function well test emotional communication . Comprehension emotional facial prosodic expression assess well production emotional communication . The expected outcome identify describe deficit production comprehension emotional prosodic facial expression describe relationship deficit emotional communication cerebellar atrophy magnetic resonance image imaging ( MRI ) use voxel base morphometry ( VBM ) .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The specific aim proposal investigate hypothesis cerebellar damage associate emotional communication deficit . - Determine whether posterior cerebellar damage result deficit production comprehension emotional facial expression and/or vocal prosodic expression - Determine whether posterior cerebellar damage result alteration intensity reaction emotionally evocative picture emotionally evocative word - Investigate relationship performance test emotional communication leave versus right cerebellar atrophy magnetic resonance image imaging ( MRI ) use voxel base morphometry ( VBM ) analysis All subject ( cerebellar control ) give follow test single session last 3 3 half hour . Included test ass read ability , name ability , several test memory , test ability discriminate face , test mental flexibility , standardized questionnaire depression , anxiety emotional empathy . The test include : 1 . Wechsler Test Adult Reading 2 . Montreal Cognitive Assessment 3 . Beck Depression Inventory - 2 4 . Wisconsin Card Sorting test 5 . Toronto Alexithymia Scale 6 . Multi-Dimensional Emotional Empathy Scale All subject also give test assess emotional communication ability . Tests recognition expression emotional tone voice facial expression perform . Expression facial expression tone voice video record blind raters compare accuracy intensity facial expression tone voice participant . Training raters include familiarization description feature emotion respect change pitch , loudness , rate prosody change facial feature facial expression . Both intra- inter-judge reliability calculate blind judge . To supplement perceptual analysis , participant 's response record use VisiPitch IV software , clinical instrument performs sound analyse calculates variation range fundamental frequency ( i.e. , pitch variation ) across sentence . The ability manipulate pitch produce vary prosodic contour salient acoustical feature affective prosody . We also assess intensity rating description emotional picture word use material establish rating norm . Participants show series picture ask rate emotional intensity picture . They also ask give brief description picture . They give list word , one time , ask rate emotional intensity word . Some cerebellar participant also ask participate magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) scan brain testing list show deficit understand produce emotional facial expression tone voice reason would prevent able enter scanner ( determined standard MRI screen form ) . Healthy control participant may also ask participate magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) scan brain reason would prevent able enter scanner . The imaging data use investigate relationship experimental subject ' performance test emotional expression leave versus right cerebellar atrophy-injury cerebellar lobule MRI image use voxel base morphometry ( VBM ) approach . The data control use comparison . Neuroimaging data collection do use Philips Achieva 3T scanner ( Amsterdam , Netherlands ) 32-channel SENSE head coil . Imaging collect include anatomical T1-weighted imaging scan . Structural MP-RAGE T1-weighted scan acquire 130—1.0 mm sagittal slice , FOV=240 mm ( AP ) —180 mm ( FH ) , matrix= 256—192 , TR= 9.90 m , TE= 4.60 m , Flip Angle= 8 , voxel size= 1.0x 0.94x 0.94 mm . Structural data analyze FSL-VBM , optimize VBM protocol carry FSL tool . First , structural image brain-extracted grey matter-segmented register MNI 152 standard space use non-linear registration The result image average flip along x-axis create left-right symmetric , study-specific grey matter template . Second , native grey matter image non-linearly registered study-specific template `` modulate '' correct local expansion ( contraction ) due non-linear component spatial transformation . The modulated grey matter image smooth isotropic Gaussian kernel sigma 6 mm . Finally , voxelwise GLM apply use permutation-based non-parametric testing , correct multiple comparison across space .</detailed_description>
