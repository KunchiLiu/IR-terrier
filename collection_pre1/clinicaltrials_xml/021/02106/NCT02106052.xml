	<brief_summary>Cognitive impairment affect roughly 50 % people multiple sclerosis ( MS ) . There currently satisfactory medical treatment cognitive impairment relate MS alternative form treatment need . Exercise training improve cognition old adult people mild cognitive impairment , include early Alzheimer 's disease . Therefore , investigator plan conduct first definitive study test theory moderately intense aerobic exercise improve cognition people MS-related impairment - specifically information process speed - non-aerobic stretch toning ( form exercise perform 3 day per week 6 month ) . Primary study hypothesis : The investigator hypothesize great improvement speed information process pre- post-treatment aerobic exercise group compare stretch tone group ( attention control ) . Secondary study hypothesis : The investigator hypothesize great improvement cognitive domains patient report outcomes pre- post-testing aerobic exercise group compare stretch tone group ( attention control ) . The investigator plan recruit 125 adult MS walk without assistance without rest least 100 meter mild weakness information processing speed . The investigator randomly assign 50 % participant aerobic exercise program 50 % non-aerobic exercise program ( stretch tone ) . In order determine whether intervention successful , investigator compare cognitive functioning exercise group exercise-training program , end 6-month training program three month end train program . If study finding support hypothesis , would relatively no-barriers treatment option explore people MS include people great less baseline disability .</brief_summary>

Willing able participate either exercise training program 3 day per week 6 month UW Medicine/Northwest Hospital Medical Center YMCA Greater Seattle Area . Near visual acuity correction 20/70 worse . Contraindications exercise train base American Heart Association ( AHA ) /ACSM screen criterion use PARQ . Using medication know adverse effect motor cognitive function , include monoamine oxidase inhibitor , sympathomimetics , antipsychotic agent , modafinil , oxybutynin , tricyclic antidepressant , cholinesterase inhibitor anticonvulsant gabapentin pregabalin . The following permitted patient stable dose least 6 week : short act benzodiazepine ( qhs administration ) , antispasmodic , selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor serotoninnorepinephrine reuptake inhibitor . Received steroid last 30 day . Relapse last 90 day . Undergone neuropsychological testing within past year . Neurological/psychological disease MS may impact cognitive status , e.g . Alzheimer 's disease , Parkinson 's , stroke , TIA , Vascular Dementia , Huntington 's , traumatic brain injury chronic CNS infection . Dementia base definition validate people MS use MACFIMS ( &gt; 2 SD mean least one memory test &gt; 2 SD mean least one neuropsychological test another domain ) . Prior history diagnosis treatment serious mental illness ( obsessivecompulsive disorder , schizophrenia , psychotic disorder , bipolar disorder ) . Diagnosis major depressive disorder prior diagnosis MS. History significant developmental learn disorder may affect participation confound interpretation study result .
