	<brief_title>Concurrent Chemotherapy Radiation Therapy Newly Diagnosed Nasal NK Cell Lymphoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Radiation Therapy : You receive radiation therapy 5 day week 28 30 treatment ( 6 week ) . You receive separate consent form describe treatment risk detail . Study Visits During Radiation Therapy : Every week radiation therapy : - You physical exam . - Blood ( 1 teaspoon ) drawn routine test . Chemotherapy Administration : You start Cycle 1 chemotherapy first week radiation . Each cycle 21-days long ( long take longer blood cell count recover ) . You receive 3 cycle chemotherapy . On Days 1-3 cycle : - You receive dexamethasone vein 15 minute . - You receive etoposide vein 2 hour . - You receive ifosfamide vein 3 hour . - Mesna give protect bladder side effect . You receive mesna vein non-stop infusion 24 hour Days 1-3 cycle . - On Day 1 , receive carboplatin vein 30 minute . Study Visits During Chemotherapy : On Day 1 , Day 15 Cycle 2 , Day 15 Cycle 3 , blood ( 2 teaspoon ) draw routine test . You may also EKG , doctor think need . On Day 1 Cycle 3 : - You EKG , doctor think need . - Blood ( 2 teaspoon ) draw routine test . Length Study : You may receive radiation 3 cycle chemotherapy . You longer able receive chemotherapy disease get bad intolerable side effect occur . Your participation study end-of-study follow-up visit . Follow-Up Visits : You also routine follow-up visit every 3 month 1st year , every 4 month 2nd year , every 6 month 3rd-5th year . After , follow visit 1 time every year . At visit , follow test procedure perform : - Blood ( 2 teaspoon ) draw routine test . - Any skin lesion may relate tumor measure photograph . If doctor think need , MRI PET/CT scan perform less often . If leave study early : - You CT , MRI , PET/CT scan check status disease . - Any skin lesion may relate tumor measure photograph . - You physical exam . - Blood ( 2 teaspoon ) draw routine test . This investigational study . Radiation chemotherapy FDA approve commercially available patient Stage 1 and/or 2 NK cell lymphoma . The combination therapy give time investigational . Up 40 patient take part study . All enrol MD Anderson .</detailed_description>
