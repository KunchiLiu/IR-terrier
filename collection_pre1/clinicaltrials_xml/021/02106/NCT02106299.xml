	<brief_title>Safety Efficacy Study Regen Sling Treatment SUI</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>1 . Stress Urinary Incontinence ( SUI ) disease urine outflow involuntarily slack weak urethral sphincter patient 's intra-abdominal pressure increase patient stand upright walk . 90 % SUI cause urethral hypermobility . 2 . So far , however , urinary incontinence vaginal tape develop independently Chinese . By mid-2012 , 10 kind vaginal tape SUI approve China Food Drug Administration ( CFDA ) import expensive ( price hospital : 5500-18000 Yuan ) . By October 18 , 2013 , product SUI treatment approve CFDA make weave technique . The main product material polypropylene , non-absorbable synthetic mesh . Polypropylene vaginal tape good biocompatibility , Polypropylene vaginal tape also many problem . Eckhard Petri 's study complication female patient SUI treat polypropylene vaginal tape show postoperative complication often occur 5th year surgery . The common complication include mesh exposure , pain , infection sexual dysfunction . The cause complication mainly relate material 's biocompatibility rejection reaction etc addition surgical factor . 3 . The Regen Sling develop Medprin Regenerative Medical Technologies Co. , Ltd. adopt high-biocompatibility Polyvinylidene Fluoride ( PVDF ) material electro-spinning technique adopt production . It highly flexible , non-erosive , permanent non-degradable.In addition , induce rapid ingrowth fibroblasts new blood capillary formation , thus achieve perfect remediation effect long-term safety . The Regen Sling effectively prevent various problem exist product occur clinical use overcome deficiency exist polypropylene weaving product poor comfortable sensation , easy induce erosion exposure etc . 4 . Given technical advantage development potential Regen Sling market demand , Sponsor plan apply registration product United States ( FDA ) addition domestic application registration ; besides , Sponsor plan conduct European unification ( CE ) certification product European Economic Area apply registration potential country region . 5 . Product Mechanism Trial Range 5.1 Product Mechanism Pathogenesis SUI include urethral hypermobility internal sphincter disorder , 90 % SUI cause urethral hypermobility . Delancey create Hammock Theory 1994 point key SUI treatment restore support tissue around urethra instead change position include angle bladder urethra . Mid urethral sling generic term surgical method female SUI treatment derive theory . It effective minimally invasive becomes internationally recognize first line treatment SUI . In Regen Sling treatment , vaginal tape place middle section urethra without tension puncture method , dynamic urethral resistance obtain abdominal pressure increase state , thus achieve urinary control effect . 5.2 Trial Range Female patient moderate severe SUI 6 . Product Indications Function 1 ) This product applicable female patient moderate severe SUI ; 2 ) Moderate severe SUI cause internal sphincter disorder ; 3 ) Mixed urinary incontinence . 7 . Research Method The study multi-center , randomize , single-blind , positive parallel control , non-inferiority validation clinical trial . 7.1 . Investigators shall observe determine whether hospitalized patient plan undergo female stress urinary incontinence surgery meet inclusion criterion . If patient meet inclusion criterion , investigator shall explain Informed Consent Form patient . If patient agree participate clinical trial , become subject trial Informed Consent Form sign patient and/or patient family member . 7.2 . The investigator shall screen register subject , complete relevant examination baseline period ; patient meet inclusion criterion without reject Informed Consent Form , investigator shall allocate random number patient chronological order ( random number allocation method : Small large ) . 7.3 . All subject shall undergo routine preoperative examination include Blood Routine , Urine Routine , Blood Type Rh antibody , Liver Kidney Function , Blood Coagulation Function , Hepatitis B Five Items , Hepatitis C Virus ( HCV ) Antibodies , Treponema Pallidum Antibodies , Preliminary HIV Screening , Electrocardiogram , Chest Radiography , Pelvic Cavity B Ultrasound etc preoperative pelvic floor function assessment preoperative questionnaire . 7.4 . During operation vaginal tape , investigator shall place control sample test sample accordance standard operation complete relevant surgical record . 7.5 . Follow-up Observation : outpatient follow-up shall conduct 3rd month , 6th month 12th month surgery . According clinical requirement , 3rd month surgery , investigator shall examine surgery 's anti-urinary incontinence effect encourage patient recover sexual life ; 6th month surgery , investigator shall conduct follow-up visit sexual life situation vaginal tape erosion situation ; 12th month surgery , investigator shall know improvement patient ' symptom .</detailed_description>
