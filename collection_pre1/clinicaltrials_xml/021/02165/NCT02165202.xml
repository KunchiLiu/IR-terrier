Approximately 132 woman randomize TMC278 LA placebo approximately two : one ratio ( 88 44 TMC278 LA placebo arm , respectively ) . Approximately 96 woman enrol SSA approximately 36 woman enrol US . In order screen initial safety tolerability active product , run-in period oral rilpivirine precede injection TMC278 LA . Participants randomize placebo arm receive oral placebo capsule prior injection saline solution ( 0.9 % NaCI ) . Participants observe take study product site staff approximately six occasion first two week oral run-in Week 0 ( Enrollment ) , Week 2 ( Oral Run-in Safety Visit ) , four separate DOT visit Weeks 0 2 .
