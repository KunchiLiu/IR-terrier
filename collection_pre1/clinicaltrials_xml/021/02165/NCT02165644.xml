	<brief_summary>Subarachnoid Hemorrhage ( SAH ) occur commonly set trauma brain aneurysm . SAH account 10 % stroke . Aneurysmal SAH account 80 % case non-traumatic case SAH , 6-8 % stroke 22-25 % cerebrovascular death . Mortality 50 % first year aneurysmal SAH rupture , 15 % severely disabled post SAH 20-35 % moderate good recovery gain lot attention pre-clinical clinical trial various agent try prevent poor outcome . The United States epidemiology data reveals fact 1 % 5 % adult unruptured brain aneurysm 30,000 people suffer aneurysm rupture annually translate brain aneurysm rupture every 18 minute . Vasospasm common SAH complication post 24 hour . It segmental diffuse narrow vessel especially large vessel . Fifty percent patient develop clinical vasospasm , progress infarction 15-20 % advance disable stroke die cerebral ischemia . The present treatment modality insufficient prevent vasospasm . So , need new treatment modality decrease mortality morbidity SAH patient . The investigator hypothesize Acetazolamide administration prevent development vasospasm aneurysmal SAH .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>If subject decides take part study , receive acetazolamide standard care standard care four day . This mean : The subject give acetazolamide tablet orally standard care subarachnoid hemorrhage standard care , maximum 4 day . If subject take medication orally investigator put tube nose stomach small intestine . Being part study exclude subject receive standard therapy . The subject give current standard care therapy irrespective study . The investigator review subject 's medical record collect information standard care procedure would do even subject enrol study . This information include , limited , subject 's imaging data , sub arachnoid hemorrhage assessment medical history . The subject 's Hunt Hess scale score ( World federation neurologic surgeon ) WFNS scale score also collect . Hunt Hess WFNS scale use assess level damage neurologic function person cause sub arachnoid hemorrhage . The subject ask come follow-up 3 month discharge hospital . The following data obtain subject 3-month follow-up . 1 . Modified Rankin Scale ( m-RS ) score 2 . Glasgow Outcome Scale ( GOS ) score</detailed_description>
