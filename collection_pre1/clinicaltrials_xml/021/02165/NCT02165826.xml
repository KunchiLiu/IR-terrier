	<brief_summary>The purpose study evaluate discontinuation rate roflumilast 500 μg daily ( OD ) use up-titration regimen either 250 μg OD 500 μg every day ( EOD ) first 4 week treatment follow 500 μg OD 8 week compare continuous treatment 500 μg OD entire 12-week main period , evaluate participant tolerate roflumilast 500 μg OD drug exposure 250 μg roflumilast OD similar observe participant 500 μg OD dose .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Evaluation Tolerability Pharmacokinetics Roflumilast , 250 μg 500 μg , add-on Standard COPD Treatment Treat Severe COPD</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Roflumilast product approve treatment severe chronic obstructive lung disease ( COPD ) approve dose 500 μg daily . This study primarily design see whether alternation dose improve tolerability Roflumilast COPD patient . Therefore one three patient start roflumilast therapy lower dose 250 μg daily , another one three take 500 μg tablet every day ( one placebo every day ) . Rest start regular dose 500 μg daily right away see whether start low dose Roflumilast lead well tolerability . Furthermore , study see patient tolerate roflumilast give low dose 250 μg daily . Lastly , study investigate body roflumilast . Patients history COPD least last 12 month former smoker current smoker history least 10 pack year invited participate . The main study period last maximum 15 week patient visit study site 6 time . If patient tolerate roflumilast , investigator may switch Down-Titration Period may lower dose rest study . Then patient remain Down-Titration Period additional 8 week visit study site 4 time . Most visit take approximately 1 2 hour . However , one visit main period 1 2 visit Down-Titration Period take approximately 6 7 hour . These visit longer allow time conduct blood taking . The Randomization visit consider Baseline visit participant discontinue Main Period continue Down-Titration Period Day 1 Down-Titration consider BaselineDT .</detailed_description>
