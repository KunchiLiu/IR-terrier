	<brief_summary>The purpose research study hypothesize Simbrinza achieve decrease intraocular pressure increase ocular perfusion pressure throughout diurnal nocturnal period . The primary aim study determine effect Simbrinza multiple interval throughout 24-hour period . The secondary aim compare timolol .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>The Diurnal Nocturnal Effect Simbrinza Timolol Intraocular Pressure Ocular Perfusion Pressure</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Intraocular pressure ( IOP ) major risk factor development glaucoma . In addition , modifiable factor prevention subsequent treatment glaucomatous optic neuropathy . Most clinicians access single IOP measurement patient visit may occur every four month . These snapshots time probably adequate optimal management glaucoma . Diurnal IOP curve provide good estimate patient 's individual IOP variation throughout day . However diurnal curve typically cover another crucial time , nocturnal period . Glaucomatous eye show different IOP curve nocturnal period compare healthy control . In addition , different class glaucoma drug variable IOP lowering effect nocturnal hour compare diurnal/wake period . For example , betablocker timolol show low IOP daytime hour fail low IOP nocturnal period habitual position . Similarly , alpha-agonist brimonidine fail low IOP overnight significantly lower IOP diurnal period . On hand , prostaglandin analogue , include latanoprost travoprost , lower IOP throughout diurnal nocturnal period although nocturnal lower appear less daytime hour . Therefore crucial determine accurate IOP curve form medication wake sleep hour .</detailed_description>
