	<brief_summary>The Southern Illinois University ( SIU ) Hand Transplant Program multidisciplinary research effort goal restore form function unilateral bilateral upper extremity amputee vascularize composite allotransplantation hand/upper extremity ( hand transplantation ) . Hand transplantation include transfer upper extremities/hands decease human donor patient single bilateral hand arm amputation . The purpose trial study functional , psychological , immunological outcome human upper extremity allotransplantation .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Hand transplantation surgical attachment hand sometimes arm organ donor person previously suffer amputation . It similar organ transplant , heart , liver , kidney , tissue come decease donor therefore require lifelong medication prevent rejection . Hand transplantation also require extensive hand rehabilitation regain function transplant limb . The primary focus study perform hand transplantation use steroid-sparing immunosuppression regimen , closely follow outcome least 2 year transplant , utilize new method immune system functional recovery . The number severity side effect treatment provide analyzed relation standard immunosuppressive drug use . Functional clinical outcome correlate data quality life . After consultation study team signing study consent form , patient undergo thorough screen phase , include imaging , laboratory test , age-appropriate screening , psychosocial evaluation , physical occupational therapy ( OT ) screening , tissue typing . Patients select formal patient selection committee meeting , base result screen procedure . If find good candidate hand transplantation , patient list United Network Organ Sharing ( UNOS ) wait compatible donor . Organ donor surround region screen compatibility regard blood type tissue type , well hand size , skin color , tone , hair pattern . Once match donor locate , hand transplant team participant notify . After surgery patient stay intensive care unit 1-3 day move regular hospital room stay 1-2 week . Physical therapy begin within 2-3 day surgery , transplant staff give daily information anti-rejection medication . After discharge hospital , patient stay locally 3-6 month monitor sign rejection extensive hand rehabilitation . Housing provide period hospital . Functional , psychological immunological outcome closely follow life allograft .</detailed_description>
