	<brief_summary>It commonly know heart failure ( HF ) main cause mortality morbidity affect 15 million people world primary chronic cause death . In spite development pharmacological therapy lead good control pathology , almost 50 % patient advanced HF survive first year . Heart failure consist deterioration cardiac pump , whose performance become insufficient satisfy organism need . HF consequence various pathology , ischemia , chronic hypertension , valvulopathies , pericarditis , etc . In condition chronic overload , one induce cited pathology , cardiomyocytes reply hypertrophy and/or death due necrosis apoptosis . At time , collagen alteration cause substitution myocardial damage portion fibrotic material , increase way cardiac rigidity reduce contractility . Finally , onset inflammation , activation immune system inflammatory mediator affect heart functionality . These phenomenon regulate complex interaction cellular molecular mechanism , moreover guarantee homeostasis maintenance physiological condition . Nevertheless , imbalance activates complex series event recently start recognize study . In effect , recent work underline importance splenic monocytes cardiac response acute heart ischemia , change vision concern role immune system heart diseases.Historically , term `` cardiac remodeling '' introduce describe anatomical change heart occur myocardial infarction . At later stage , acknowledge also pathological condition , chronic hypertension , cause myocardial remodeling . Physiologically , immune system cell always consider role protection infection . Recently , instead , evidence show immune system cell might far complex function heart . The myocardial remodeling come modification may adaptive initial insult , structural adjustment may become activation structural/metabolic circle potentially culminate transition HF . This observational study evaluate immunological profile relation cardiac geometry variation hypertensive patient . Aim project characterize profile immune system activation process cardiac remodel typical cardiomyopathy overload . The main goal reach characterization circulate profile immune system cell , order find correlation clinical phenotype .</brief_summary>
