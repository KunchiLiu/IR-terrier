	<brief_summary>This two-part study evaluate safety tolerability supratherapeutic dos RO7033877 ( Part 1 ) investigate effect RO7033877 QTc interval healthy volunteer ( Part 2 ) . Part 1 single ascend dose , randomize , observer-blind , placebo-controlled study determine safety tolerability pharmacokinetics supratherapeutic dose use Part 2 . Participants randomize 8 cohort receive single dose either RO7033877 placebo . Part 2 single dose , randomize , double-blind , double dummy , placebo-controlled , positive control , 4-way crossover study . Part 2 evaluate whether single therapeutic supratherapeutic dose RO7033877 threshold pharmacologic effect cardiac repolarization , detect change QT/QTc interval measure electrocardiogram ( ECG ) . Pharmacokinetic parameter assess Parts 1 2 , continuous ECG recording evaluate Part 2 .</brief_summary>
