	<brief_summary>BASIC VALIDATE coronary stent registry obtain clinical follow-up information 2000 patient treat CE-marked stent ( BioMatrix Flex™ , Biosensors International ) follow-up endpoint via Swedish angiography angioplasty registry ( SCAAR - part national SWEDEHEART registry ) .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>BASIC VALIDATE Coronary Stent Registry</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Purpose study The purpose registry capture clinical data BioMatrix NeoFlex™ stent ( improve version delivery system Biolimus A9™-eluting BioMatrix Flex stent ) relation safety effectiveness VALIDATE SWEDEHEART trial group patient take part VALIDATE SWEDEHEART addition group patient stable angina pectoris . Clinical relevance The European Union focus encourages conductance post marketing surveillance study medical device 3 . This focus see light limitation clinical data available pre-market phase owe duration pre-market clinical investigation , number subject investigator involve investigation , relative heterogeneity subject investigator control set clinical investigation versus full range clinical condition encounter general medical practice . The extent data gather pre-market phase necessarily enable detection rare complication problem become apparent widespread long term use device . Because study device ( BioMatrix NeoFlex™ ) CE-marked updated version BioMatrix Flex stent important document assume improvement delivery design also reflect improvement clinical setting . Patients method Patients A total 6000 patient include VALIDATE SWEDEHEART trial . 3000 STEMI 3000 NSTEMI . The ambition approximately 1000 patient also include BASIC VALIDATE stent registry . In addition , order achieve post-market information entire spectrum PCI , another 1000 patient stable angina pectoris , STEMI NSTEMI include registry VALIDATE SWEDEHEART center unrelated VALIDATE SWEDEHEART trial . Treatment strategy During index procedure , BioMatrix NeoFlex™ stent implant . The investigator choose appropriate length diameter stent implant visual estimate . The choice length stent ensure complete coverage lesion . In case insufficient stent expansion , post-dilatation highly recommend . In event stag procedure expect plan recommend NOT include patient BASIC VALIDATE registry nature follow-up patient ( registry ) mean staged procedure classify event ( `` repeat '' revascularizations ) . After index PCI , lifelong acetylsalicylic acid dose 75-160 mg per day prescribe . Duration choice post-PCI P2Y12 inhibition leave discretion treat physician . Endpoints Primary endpoint A composite time death , myocardial infarction , stent thrombosis repeat revascularization 12 month . Secondary endpoint - Time death 1 , 3 5 year . - Time myocardial infarction 1 , 3 5 year . - Time stent thrombosis 1 , 3 5 year . - Time repeat revascularization 1 , 3 5 year . - Analysis primary endpoint NSTEMI STEMI group separately . All endpoint result compare matched population patient treat drug-eluting coronary stent document SCAAR/SWEDEHEART registry .</detailed_description>
