	<brief_summary>Endometriosis common disease woman reproductive age important cause female infertility . Endometriosis often associate development adhesion compromise fertility affect woman . The main purpose study investigate pregnancy rate one year excision endometriosis application GnRH-analogues ( Gonadotropin-releasing hormone ) 3 month . Half patient receive traditional endometriosis treatment excision endometriotic lesion . The half additionally receive gel reduce adhesion formation ( Hyalobarrier速 ) . Further study objective investigation development different type endometriosis-associated pain period one year . Potential study participant woman endometriosis-associated pain desire child . It investigate study use Hyalobarrier速 result high pregnancy rate due reduce adhesion development .</brief_summary>
