	<brief_summary>The purpose study evaluate safety effectiveness bariatric embolization minimally-invasive image-guided procedure morbid obesity . In procedure , specific blood vessel stomach block order suppress body 's signal feel hungry , lead weight loss . Morbid obesity currently treat diet exercise , medication , surgery . This study design help treat obesity use minimally invasive , non-surgical , angiographic ( blood vessel ) approach . This procedure similar common procedure use treat bleed within stomach . This version procedure name `` bariatric embolization '' . Although 40 hormone limit food intake , one hormone , ghrelin show stimulate ( prompt ) food intake . In obese patient , eat fails suppress ghrelin level , believe prevent feel full meal lead overeat . Due strong hunger crave effect ghrelin , hormone target treatment obesity weight loss . More recently , ghrelin show significant role long-term effect weight loss bariatric ( obesity ) surgery ghrelin level show much low compare untreated patient . Recent data collect animal show block blood vessel particular portion stomach ( bariatric embolization ) temporarily decrease level appetite induce hormone ghrelin , decrease short-term weight gain . In study 5 people , decrease ghrelin level weight loss first month procedure , information effect procedure long period time . We hope learn bariatric embolization result safe effective weight loss people morbidly obese .</brief_summary>
