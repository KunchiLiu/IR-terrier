	<brief_summary>The drug Ketamine , available medical practice since late 1960s , currently use induce general anesthesia sedation medical procedure . When give slowly injection vein , ketamine show produce rapid effect depression improve depressive symptom within hour day . By study patient receive ketamine IV infusion , add-on treatment depression , investigator may start understand change brain gene function relate get good short period time . In study , investigator enroll 30 patient currently ill major depression select receive IV ketamine therapy medical supervision . To study neurobiological change relate symptom improvement , investigator use advanced brain scan measure brain structure , chemistry function . Blood sample measure change gene regulation immune system response . Although people rapid antidepressant response ketamine , others respond . Also , antidepressant effect ketamine usually wear within day week . In 20 30 patient enrolled trial , also determine four dos ketamine deliver two three time week may prolong antidepressant response ketamine therapy . To determine durability ketamine treatment depression , patient monitor phone via electronic device twice week five week return final assessment symptom return . For trial , brain blood sample measurement occur three time point ( 6 hour 24-hours ) patient receives first ketamine infusion . Patients remit initial dose ketamine , receive three additional ketamine treatment . Mood measure 24-hours subsequent ketamine infusion brain blood measurement repeat time remission fourth ketamine infusion remission occur . Patients return final brain scan blood sample depressive symptom return five week continue remission . Investigators able see change brain measurement , gene regulation immune response relate improvement relapse depressive symptom ketamine IV therapy . The ketamine infusion session occur special research unit ( CTRC ) UCLA .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Growing evidence implicates glutamatergic system pathogenesis depression , receptor antagonist may provide new generation compound MDD treatment . In particular , find NMDA antagonist , ketamine , induces rapid antidepressant response within hour day lead research investigate neural mechanism produce rapid antidepressant action make ketamine valuable tool identify biomarkers depression response risk relapse . The study biomarkers understand mechanistic action ketamine may serve enhance emerge treatment approach provide new breakthrough translation drug target . Recently , investigator trial begin offer off-label ketamine infusion treatment clinical patient treatment-resistant depression ( TRD ) develop local treatment protocol systematic clinical assessment , infusion monitoring follow-up , well-received tolerate . The overarch goal study investigate imaging , gene expression immune system biomarkers help determine underlying mechanisms predictor treatment response relapse MDD patient receive ketamine compare biomarkers obtain patient receive ECT . The investigator aim collect data sample 30 patient study 4 time point 2-day period ( baseline 6 24 hour single ketamine infusion treatment ) . While symptom often return baseline 1-2 week ketamine treatment , early evidence suggest serial ketamine infusion effective single infusion may lead remission sustain response large number patient . For subsample 20 patient , investigator thus incorporate serial infusion protocol . Here , patient receive serial infusion ketamine , occur 2-3 time week , achieve remission total 4 infusion . To study change ketamine treatment , use advance brain scan allow u measure brain structure , chemistry function . We also collect blood sample measure change gene regulation immune system response time . Patients also assess basic cognitive function mood . Brain blood sample measurement occur ketamine infusion 6 hour 24 hour first infusion , 4th last infusion , final follow-up session approximately 5 week ketamine treatment . We also include remote mood assessment treatment efficiently track relapse . We therefore able see change time brain measurement gene regulation , immune response relate improvement relapse depressive symptom . The investigator address follow aim : Aim 1 : To use comprehensive multimodal magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) battery include ) single voxel proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy ( 1HMRS ) , b ) structural MRI ( sMRI ) , c ) arterial spin-labeling ( ASL ) , ) rest state functional MRI ( rs-fMRI ) e ) diffusion MRI ( dMRI ) sensitive different aspect brain plasticity isolate neurobiological marker link predictive ketamine response subsequent relapse . Hypothesis 1 : Neuroplasticity cortico-limbic ( prefrontal anterior cingulate cortex hippocampus ) striatal network , include change glutamate brain metabolite , blood perfusion structural functional connectivity associate therapeutic response ketamine . Aim 2 : To use peripheral blood measure inflammatory cytokine soluble receptor previously link depression treatment outcome examination relationship ketamine response subsequent relapse . Hypothesis 2 : Ketamine-induced symptom improvement associate alter concentration proinflammatory cytokine indicate modulation immune response system . Aim 3 : To conduct transcriptome profile use peripheral blood sample identify gene expression correlate ketamine response . Hypothesis 3 : Gene expression profile signal biological pathway underlie therapeutic response ketamine . Description outcome measure : 1 . Clinical outcome : The Hamilton Depression Rating Scale 2 . Imaging marker : Image analysis incorporate standard custom image analysis software process streams measure change neurochemistry , structural functional plasticity connectivity occur across time association clinical response . Specifically , outcome measure include : 1 . Structural image connectivity measure : combine volumetric shape diffusion metric obtain sMRI dMRI data . 2 . Functional connectivity measure : Combined functional imaging measure obtain rest state functional imaging data 3 . Neurochemistry : Brain metabolites include glutamate , choline , NAA . 4 . Gene expression : Gene expression marker obtain differential expression analysis . Analyses : General linear mixed model regression analysis use determine change across time association clinical response image marker . Weighted Gene Coexpression Network analysis ( WGCNA ) Ingenuity Pathways analysis ( IPA ) use identify function pathway associate identified transcript .</detailed_description>
