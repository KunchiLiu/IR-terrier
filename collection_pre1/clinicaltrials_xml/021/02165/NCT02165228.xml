	<brief_summary>The long-term goal propose research identify develop effective intervention decrease persistent , low-level inflammation risk CVD . Stress substantial contributor inflammation , interaction among stress , inflammation , body mass index , health behavior measure . Mindfulness-based stress reduction ( MBSR ) effective stress reduction , show effective inflammation reduction individual disease , sustainable practice individual across health spectrum . Diet strategy effective mean reduce inflammation individual , may successful many people , evidence steady rise obesity rate . The specific aim study 1 ) test effectiveness MBSR compare establish intervention nutrition enhancement ( NE ) intervention reduction inflammation , 2 ) test effectiveness MBSR compare non-intervention control condition ( CON ) reduction inflammation . Men woman 25-45 year age randomly assign participate MBSR ( n=60 ) DIET ( n=60 ) CON ( n=60 ) interventions 16 week . Serum CRP concentration , additional inflammatory cytokine ( tumor necrosis factor-a , interleukin-6 ) , cortisol diurnal profile , anthropometrics , dietary intake , component metabolic syndrome measure pre- post-intervention elucidate underlying mechanism determine whether health benefit beyond inflammation reduction occur .</brief_summary>
