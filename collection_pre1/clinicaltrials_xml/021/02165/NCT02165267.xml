	<brief_title>Evaluating Safety Drug Levels Antibody Against HIV Healthy , HIV-Uninfected Adults</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The purpose study evaluate safety , tolerability , drug level five different schedule intravenous ( IV ) subcutaneous ( SC ) administration human monoclonal antibody ( VRC-HIVMAB060-00-AB [ VRC01 ] ) HIV healthy , HIV-uninfected adult . The study enroll 88 healthy , HIV-uninfected adult age 18 50 year . This study enroll participant 5 group . Groups 1-3 enroll simultaneously . Groups 1 2 randomize together blind , Group 3 randomize separately blind . With implementation Version 2.0 , Groups 4 5 randomize together enroll simultaneously . Each group different schedule clinic visit receive different dos VRC01 placebo VRC01 . Participants attend 8 month schedule clinic visit . Participants Group 1 receive IV infusion VRC01 Days 0 , 28 , 56 , 84 , 112 , 140 . Participants Group 2 receive IV infusion VRC01 Days 0 , 56 , 112 . Participants Group 3 receive IV infusion VRC01 IV placebo VRC01 Day 0 , follow SC injection VRC01 SC placebo VRC01 Days 14 , 28 , 42 , 56 , 70 , 84 , 98 , 112 , 126 , 140 , 154 . Participants Groups 4 5 receive IV infusion VRC01 ( group receive different dose ) Days 0 , 56 , 112 . Participants remain clinic hour receive infusion injection observation monitoring . Participants Group 3 problem first SC injection wait clinic half hour rest SC injection . At study entry , participant give medical history ; undergo physical exam , blood collection , urine collection ; receive HIV risk reduction counseling . At follow-up visit , participant undergo brief physical exam blood collection , receive HIV risk reduction counseling , ask question health experience participate study . At visit , participant bear female pregnancy test . At select study visit , saliva , rectal , semen cervical secretion sample collect participant consent collection sample .</detailed_description>
