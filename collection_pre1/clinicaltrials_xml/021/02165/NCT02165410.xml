	<detailed_description>Anatomical functional abnormality identify superior temporal sulcus ( STS ) autism brain imaging modality , include positron emission tomography ( PET ) , functional MRI diffusion MRI . These result suggest brain imaging abnormality within STS could first step cascade neuronal abnormality find autism . STS know key area social cognition involve various stage social interaction , visual auditory perception ( perception eye , facial body movement , perception human voice ) complex process social cognition ( theory mind , understand emotion mentalizing ) The anatomical functional abnormality within STS describe autism could account social difficulty experience person autism , clinically observe objectified study visual social perception . The individual detection result find PET , say reduction rCBF superior temporal sulcus ( STS ) , could reproduce ASL use predict diagnosis autism child level sensitivity specificity PET . The individual detection decrease rCBF STS could useful biomarker autism use MRI , method accessible much less invasive PET . A MRI biomarker autism could allow individual analysis , well contribute early diagnosis objective evaluation efficacy new therapeutic strategy . The rCBF data measure MRI-ASL also correlate clinical ( Autism Diagnostic Interview - ADI-R ) behavioral data social perception measure eye-tracking method . In addition , study impact temporal anomaly brain connectivity MRI method diffusion tensor . We also describe abnormality present early development autism .</detailed_description>
	<criteria>Patient diagnose autist suspected autist : male female diagnosis autism base follow criterion : 5 year ≤ age &lt; 18 year , demand MRI etiologic assessment ( suspected autism ) MRI control treatment ( diagnosed autism ) obtain write consent parent legal guardian patient . Patients diagnose mental retardation suspect mental retardation : male female diagnosis mental retardation use follow criterion : 5 year ≤ age &lt; 18 year , demand MRI etiologic assessment ( suspected mental retardation ) MRI control treatment ( diagnosed mental retardation ) obtain write consent parent legal guardian patient . Healthy control subject : male female : 5 year ≤ age &lt; 18 year know neurological psychiatric disorder obtain write consent parent legal guardian volunteer . Very young patient suspect autism : male female suspect autism 1 . 18 month ≤ age &lt; 5 year 2. demand MRI etiologic assessment 3. obtain write consent parent legal guardian . Very young patient suspect mental retardation : male female suspect mental retardation 1 . 18 month ≤ age &lt; 5 year 2. demand MRI etiologic assessment 3. obtain write consent parent legal guardian . All subject must register social security . For subject : Indication perform MRI ( pacemaker , implanted metal foreign body , claustrophobia ) , Inability healthy volunteer remain still MRI examination . Healthy control subject : male female : age 5 year 18 year know neurological psychiatric disorder obtain write consent parent legal guardian volunteer . All subject must register social security . For subject : Indication perform MRI ( pacemaker , implanted metal foreign body , claustrophobia ) , Inability healthy volunteer remain still MRI examination .</criteria>
