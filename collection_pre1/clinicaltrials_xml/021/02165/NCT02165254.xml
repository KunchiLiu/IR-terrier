	<brief_title>The Gentle Cardiac Rehabilitation Study</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>We estimate feasibility , acceptability safety two different dos Tai Chi intervention ( primary outcome ) . 60 patient ( 30 per dose arm ) randomly assign standard dose Tai Chi ( dose use group large study heart failure patient ) high dose matching recommend frequency duration exercise class current CRs . Acceptability assessment include survey focus group formally assess impact Tai Chi facilitator barrier CRs population . We also obtain estimate effect size dose accelerometry measure physical activity proportion patient achieve current American Heart Association ( AHA ) recommendation physical activity ( secondary outcome ) . Additional outcome cardiac fitness , quality life , body weight , sleep . In addition , gather exploratory information possible mechanism Tai Chi training may affect physical activity . We collect information possible mediator exercise self-efficacy , perceive social support , depression . In addition , since Tai Chi training associate meditative practice aim increase present-moment awareness , gather information mindfulness level . Measurements conduct baseline , 3- , 6- , 9 month enrollment .</detailed_description>
