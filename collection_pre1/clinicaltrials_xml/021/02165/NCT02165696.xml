	<brief_summary>Lymphedema result accumulation fluid element tissue space imbalance production fluid interstitial transport . Lymphedema cause significant physical psychological morbidity . Prevalence lymphedema patient breast cancer surgery 12-60 % incidence 12-26 % .Psychological social consequence secondary lymphedema relate breast cancer little recognize document . Although , perform many study relate secondary lymphedema find sufficient evidence literature suggest effective treatment . There evidence suggest compression therapy manual lymphatic drainage improve lymphedema study need . The aim research evaluate clinical effect multimodal treatment ( compression bandage manual lymph drainage ) versus apply manual lymphatic drainage woman arm lymphedema breast cancer surgery .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>This study two sub research : quantitative approach qualitative approach . The research carry multicenter way Quantitative approach consist carry single-blind randomize control trial 44 woman arm lymphedema . Patients distribute two intervention group randomize way . Participants give assignment close envelope . Both treatment administer five day week six week . The experimental group ( n=22 ) receive multimodal treatment : combination manual lymphatic drainage compression bandaging . The control group ( n=22 ) receive manual lymphatic drainage . We want determinate effect volume arm decrease , quality life , level hand strength , degree pain , fatigue level , state anxiety depression . The influence lymphedema analyze low limbs strength , physical activity , lung function , respiratory muscle strength maximal inspiratory expiratory pressure measurement ( MIP MEP ) cardiorespiratory functional capacity . Patients adherence analyzed smartphone . Qualitative apprach : know perception experience participant intervention group qualitative descriptive study . Data obtain semi-structured depth interview .</detailed_description>
