	<brief_summary>Electrical status epilepticus sleep ( ESES ) pattern abnormal discharge electroencephalogram ( EEG ) . Children pattern present seizure neuropsychological regression . There study systematically evaluate response abnormal discharge EEG , seizures neuropsychological regression different antiepileptic treatment . Therefore , treatment strategy ESES base scientific evidence . High-dose benzodiazepine diazepam ( valium ) report improve severe EEG abnormality patient ESES short-term . But long-term response seizures neuropsychological regression systematically study . Clobazam benzodiazepine derivative antiepileptic property . The pharmacologic property clobazam make drug particularly useful option ESES : patient ESES alpha-2 subunit GABA receptor preferentially up-regulated clobazam may higher affinity particular subunit , investigator expect high effect drug ESES patient benzodiazepine ( Loddenkemper et al , preparation ) . The aim study objectively evaluate response clobazam treatment neuropsychological deficit , seizure abnormal discharge EEG patient ESES . Clobazam treatment use routine clinical practice investigator objectively quantify effect . Our work hypothesis high-dose clobazam treatment may control abnormal epileptiform discharge EEG patient ESES . The reduction abnormal epileptiform discharge may lead improvement neuropsychological deficit seizure . The predicted improvement seizures neuropsychological function would lead good quality life patient .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>- A . RESEARCH METHODS Study design . Investigators perform prospective descriptive cohort study historical control . Participating institution . Children 's Hospital Boston ( PI : Tobias Loddenkemper ) Children 's Hospital Colorado ( PI : Kevin Chapman ) . Patients . Investigators enroll patient ESES study center treat high-dose clobazam treatment decide clinical epileptologist . The diagnosis ESES confirm base neuropsychological regression least one domain development , presence seizure appear age-related manner presence EEG ESES pattern ( Loddenkemper , et al . 2011a ) . Contact patient . Once potential candidate recognize ( patient ESES , change medication regimen decide include initiation clobazam ) , research team contact primary epileptologist . The primary epileptologist contact patient order check whether family and/or patient would like contact research protocol . If patient agrees contact , research team contact patient order propose participate study . EEG assessment . Investigators assess epileptiform activity long-term monitoring unit treatment every patient.Assessment clinical data . The clinical chart patient include study collect review relevant clinical information . This information update complemented patient and/or family admission long-term monitoring . Assessment neuropsychological data : A battery neuropsychological test perform board-certified clinical neuropsychologists obtain information regard cognitive ability . Safety measure . Investigators continuously monitor patient adverse effect hospitalization provide contact information continuous report possible adverse effect . Potential risk subject . As subject use FDA-approved drug treatment epilepsy risk routine clinical care . There risk associate specific use clobazam routinely use clinical care decision use depend primary provider research team . Other potential risk related loss privacy confidentiality . Investigators develop mechanisms ensure protection patient ' privacy confidentiality . Quality control method . Investigators perform quality control measure every 5 collect patient Children 's Hospital Boston . Additionally , independent medical monitoring implement . - B . STATISTICAL ANALYSIS Calculation sample size . Our previous study diazepam treatment ( Sánchez Fernández , et al . press-a ) find difference epileptiform activity treatment around 30 % . There data available quantification response epileptiform activity antiepileptic treatment . - C. PLANS FOR MISSING DATA Recruitment patient . Patients ESES frequently belong category patient able understand study protocol age neuropsychological regression . Their family and/or caretaker decide case study enrollment patient consent/assent look developmentally possible . Although study patient severe developmental delay pose significant challenge , burden participate study significantly different burden normal clinical care . Additionally study performed center familiar care patient severe developmental delay . Sample size . Power calculation propose study challenge due novel approach . Our preliminary data , however , strongly favor feasibility completion .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>A change treatment regimen require active epileptiform activity sleep neuropsychological regression . This mean patient active epileptiform activity , therefore , need change treatment regimen clinically indicate potentially eligible . Additionally , prior clinical decision use clobazam make primary epileptologist order participate study . Availability clinical , neuropsychological EEG followup . Electroclinical evolution require change medication regimen change medication regimen include clobazam .</criteria>
