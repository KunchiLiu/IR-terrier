	<brief_summary>Current diagnostic aid use treat ADHD currently expensive , time intensive , provide little information accessory movement response stimulus . Tests Conners ' Rating Scale require subjective response parent teacher , make coordination difficult . The computerized Conners ' Continuous Performance Test ( CPT ) provide objective data regard inattention impulsive pattern response . However , provide data regard accessory movement restlessness , hyperactivity , inappropriate movement . If subject take exam reading disorder , impair ability respond accurately increase response time . The T.O.V.A . another computer base test use diagnostic aid ADHD , use microswitch record responses . It utilize auditory visual stimulus , remove read level limitation . However , unable measure measure accessory movement may contribute reaction time error omission commission . Because limitation , new company call CogCubed create new game base Sifteo Cube ( http : //www.sifteo.com ) platform . These new hands-on digitize cube unique , motion-sensitive wireless block contain multiple sensor interact one another . CogCubed provide data study . The game play 30 minute session subject age 18 . Subjects recruit play game ADHD without , match gender . Those comorbidities developmental delay , mental retardation , psychosis , schizophrenia , bipolar disorder substance use disorder exclude , well physiological disability affect upper limb movement and/or coordination . Informed consent obtain participant prior administer game . The hypothesis analyze data generate new game platform name Sifteo game create , use auditory visual stimulus distracters , investigator expect able provide accurate profile impulsivity inattention . The investigator expect inattention error omission less tilt movement control impulsivity represent commission great tilt movement control .</brief_summary>
