	<brief_summary>Insulin replacement therapy absolutely required patient Type 1 diabetes . The insulin pump provide continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion ( CSII ) , approximate insulin release pattern normal pancreas . Timely accurate knowledge ambient glucose level important insulin dose adjustment . Typically , glucose value measure volitionally , several time day , use capillary `` fingerstick '' sample . In addition , glucose interstitial fluid measure automatically continuously use implantable glucose oxidase-based sensor . Recent study show continuous measurement glucose level allow fully automate `` closed-loop '' insulin replacement therapy require algorithm receives glucose data , calculates appropriate insulin dose , direct pump deliver insulin dose.The need development closed-loop insulin replacement system integrate insulin delivery , glucose measurement , control subsystems present several challenge biomedical engineer .</brief_summary>
