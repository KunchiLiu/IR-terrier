	<brief_summary>Cancers occur molecule control normal cell growth ( gene protein ) alter . Changes tumor gene gene normal cell call `` alteration . '' Many alteration detect directly examine cancer cell tumor circulate blood . Several alteration occur repeatedly certain type cancer already identify . These discovery ahve lead development new drug `` target '' alteration . More remain discover . Some alteration find gene . Genes compose DNA `` letter , '' contain instruction tell cell body grow work . Genes make protein actually carry instruction cell . We would like use DNA look alteration gene cancer cell blood cell use technology call `` sequencing . '' Gene sequence way read DNA identify error gene may contribute behavior cell . Some change gene occur cancer cell . Others occur normal cels well , gene may pass parent child . This research study examine kind gene . The purpose research study perform gene sequencing ( gene test ) cancer cell ( obtain biopsy surgery ) normal tissue ( usually blood ) . The result gene test use try develop good way treat prevent cancer . We also study good way communicate result complex gene test doctor , help doctor use information choose best paths treatment . As part work , may also learn thing gene normal cell ; information also share wtih doctor choose . Importantly , study use tissue specimen already collect stored pathology department part clinical care part research study may participate . In study , gene test perform material necessary clinical test perform . In general , additional invasive procedure require .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>If agree take part study , ask permission obtain additional sample blood ( 2 tube 4 teaspoon ) . Cells blood contain normal , non-cancer cell DNA need analysis . One main reason study genetic characteristic cancer learn whether predict response exist treatment . Therefore , study , would also link result gene test cancer wtih medical information generate course treatment . The medical information contain medical record . A small number gene test result may importance health treatment . For example , might uncover gene alteration know make cancer respond ( resistant ) specific therapy . Therefore , ask consider whether would like u inform doctor result gene test . Your doctor may contact result gene test , result could impact cancer treatment disease directly , give permission . In case , research doctor may contact find would interested participate different research study base information thay may find tissue blood sample , survey/interview response . We also ask provide name contact information relative may know whereabouts , could decide use information research future , available give permission . Some specimen , well material generate analysis tissue blood , may useful study future , new technology approach . We ask permission store specimens material secure biologic sample storage facility possible later research . We also ask participate two survey relate study time point . These time point include first join study , receive result gene test do sample . The survey seek learn thinking type genetic analysis , way information share would helpful . Some study participant also invite take part study-related interview . The purpose interview understand expect happen result gene test , result gene test may affect . The survey take 15 minute complete . The interview expect take approximately 45 minute complete . Finally , rapid progress understand treat cancer occur genetic information derive tissue blood share researcher . In particular , National Institutes Health ( NIH ) organization develop special data ( information ) repositories analyze data collect result certain type genetic study . These central bank store genetic information , sample , survey/interview information provide qualified researcher study . Therefore , also ask permission share result special bank . Your information sample send code number attach . Your name directly identifiable information share data bank investigator . There many safeguard place protect information sample store repository use research . although may slight risk loss privacy share information bank , establish procedure encode sample information protect data . Although everything protect privacy data , absolutely guarantee privacy predict genetic information use future .</detailed_description>
