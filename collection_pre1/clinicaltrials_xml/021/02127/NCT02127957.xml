	<brief_summary>The objective investigator research program determine whether combined exercise program ( aerobic resistance ) improve abnormal glucose tolerance diabetes control CF patient . This program exercise increase strength muscle endurance , exercise tolerance , assess group 12 CF patient impair glucose tolerance . The effect exercise compare control group 12 patient also glucose intolerant participate structure physical activity program . The duration exercise program 12 week several measure ( glucose tolerance , inflammatory profile , lung function , exercise capacity , muscle strength endurance ) conduct pre post program ass program 's impact .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>A total 24 subject CF impair glucose tolerance diabetes relate CF ( CFRD ) unmedicated recruit . Participants recruit research nurse CF , analyze available data medical record seek participation subject meet inclusion exclusion criterion . Patients receive visit outpatient clinic FK Hotel -Dieu du CHUM hospital , inform consent form ( ICF ) study . Their intention participate main inclusion exclusion criterion confirm telephone interview conduct member team IRCM . Finally , visit IRCM , subject get answer question ICF ICF sign procedure . All participant agree participate research project must undergo short telephone interview ( 20 minute ) 4 assessment visit ( approximately 1-5 hour ) Pre ( 2 visit ) post ( 2 visit ) study . The control patient delay exercise conduct assessment visit end training . GROUP 1 EXERCISES : Patients exercise group require take part two supervise training session 8 follow phone call . The exercise program perform three time per week one hour . GROUP 2 CONTROL : Participants control group contact phone month follow entry study . On occasion reminder complete physical activity log realize . Following visit # 6 , patient control group invite participate second study phase participate supervised exercise program . This participation involve additional 12 week follow-up , include visit Group 1 exercise . In case , simplify participation reduce volume blood collect , final visit ( # 5 ) project also first visit exercise phase . This part study , involve 2 supervised training session 8 follow phone call . The exercise program perform three time per week one hour .</detailed_description>
