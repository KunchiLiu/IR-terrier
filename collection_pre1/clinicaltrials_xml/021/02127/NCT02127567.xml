	<detailed_description>Context Inadequate reporting frequent cause waste research . For example , essential information evaluate risk bias method randomization lack 75 % publish randomize control trial ( RCTs ) , 30 % report provide sufficient detail allow replication treatment evaluate trial clinical practice . To overcome issue , CONSORT statement , evidence-based , minimum set recommendation report RCTs developed 1996 . These guideline since updated 2001 recently 2010 . In addition , extension main CONSORT statement develop give additional guidance RCTs specific design ( eg cluster ) , data ( eg harm ) , intervention ( eg nonpharmacologic treatment ) . Many journal endorse CONSORT statement . Some journal provide recommendation author follow CONSORT guideline editor enforce use CONSORT guideline request author submit checklist either submission acceptance stage . Nevertheless , inadequate reporting remain . Hypothesis We hypothesize improve reporting , CONSORT guideline must implement stage write manuscript instead stage journal submission peer review process . We develop CONSORT base online write tool improve completeness reporting . This tool focus domains method section 2-arm parallel group randomize control trial evaluate pharmacologic nonpharmacologic treatment . Objective Our objective evaluate impact CONSORT base online write tool completeness reporting . Methods Study design : We perform `` split-manuscript '' randomize control trial , adapt split-body design . We consider 6 domain method section : trial design , randomization , blinding , participant , intervention , outcome . The unit randomization domain allocation ratio 1:1 . Each study participant receive experimental intervention ( tool ) 3 6 domain control intervention ( tool ) thther 3 domain . Participants : Masters doctoral student Intervention : The use online write tool write method section article RCT protocol . Comparator : The write method section article RCT protocol specific support . Primary outcome : The primary outcome average score completeness reporting . Number participant expect : 40</detailed_description>
