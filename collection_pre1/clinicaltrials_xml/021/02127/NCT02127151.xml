	<brief_summary>A Single Arm Phase II Trial BMN 673 Inoperable , Advanced Endometrial Cancer With Retrospective PTEN , MSI MRE11 Analysis PTEN= Phosphatase tensin homolog MSI= Microsatellite instability MRE11= Double-strand break repair protein MRE11A This trial investigate whether drug BMN 673 therapeutic benefit treatment advance endometrial cancer . Nearly 8,000 patient diagnosed endometrial cancer UK every year . A significant proportion either diagnose advanced disease may inoperable and/or metastatic ( i.e spread organ outside endometrium ) , curable disease relapse follow first line treatment . There establish standard care patient chemo hormone therapy limit effectiveness survival benefit . Survival rate improve past 20 year . Furthermore call 'targeted ' drug license treatment i.e . drug block growth spread cancer interfere specific molecule involve tumor growth progression . This leave unmet need effective systemic treatment advance , inoperable metastatic endometrial cancer . BMN 673 show potentially effective treat cancer know behave similarly endometrial disease , laboratory Phase I study involve patient advanced cancer . Similarly drug appear relatively tolerable . A Phase II trial one propose application could demonstrate activity might lead new effective treatment patient inoperable , advanced , recurrent metastatic endometrial cancer , propose substudy also present possibility discover subset patient likely derive benefit BMN 673 . This trial adult woman ( 18 ) advance , inoperable metastatic endometrial cancer . Patients recruit approximately 15 National Health Service ( NHS ) Trusts base United Kingdom ( UK ) . The study expect last approximately 18-24 month term recruitment time , maximum 100 eligible woman register . All patient receive BMN 673 disease worsens doctor decide stop treatment .</brief_summary>
