	<detailed_description>Background : Despite easy free access HIV testing service 5 million test per year perform , late diagnosis remain common France one-third HIV infection diagnose associated AIDS CD4 lymphocyte count less 200/Î¼L . To improve early detection , national health agency promote non-targeted HIV screen health care setting , include emergency department ( EDs ) , addition diagnostic test routinely perform physician . In previous survey conduct 2009-2010 29 EDs metropolitan Paris area , non-targeted nurse-driven HIV screening rapid test feasible , well-accepted identify new HIV diagnose mostly among patient high-risk . Our finding , consistent result international group , suggest target strategy could feasible , efficient cost-effective few test require . However , feasibility efficacy strategy remain unknown France . Primary objective : The aim present study compare efficacy two strategy : 1 ) combination nurse-driven HIV target screen current practice ( physician-directed HIV diagnostic testing ) versus 2 ) current practice alone ( physician-directed HIV diagnostic testing ) . The main outcome measure number patient newly identify HIV infection among number 18-64 year patient visit EDs ( apart see prophylaxis exposure HIV ) inclusion period . Secondary objective : The linkage care patient newly diagnose infection , number new HIV positive test among total number test , early detection compare . The feasibility nurse-driven HIV screening ( proportion : filled-questionnaires , proposition nurse-driven HIV screening , acceptation patient HIV rapid test do nurse ) acceptability caregiver ED evaluate well cost-effectiveness . Methods : Multicenter trial cluster randomization cross-over The 2 strategy compare 2 randomly assign period separate month ( cluster randomization cross-over ) . 8 750 patient per ED per period expect 8 EDs ( cf . statistical plan ) . The study perform 8 EDs metropolitan Paris , area half France 's new HIV patient diagnose . The center select base high proportion patient high risk visit EDs . During targeted period , nurse offer screen patient EDs , age 18-64 year old , identified high-risk self-administered questionnaire , know HIV positive , see post-exposure prophylaxis unstable medical illness , accept participate providing informed consent . The questionnaire previously test one ED . In case reactive rapid test result , blood specimen collect standard enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay western blot confirmation . A follow-up visit on-site infectious disease specialist arrange within follow 48 hour . Perspective : This project allow define benefit nurse-driven HIV target screen EDs potential utility improve HIV screen France .</detailed_description>
