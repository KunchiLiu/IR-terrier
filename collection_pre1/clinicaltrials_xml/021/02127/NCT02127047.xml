	<brief_summary>Increasing evidence suggest pancreatic islet beta-cell regeneration occur throughout course disease patient type 1 diabetes . Therefore , decrease beta-cell mass type 1 diabetes may improve inhibition beta-cell destruction stimulation proliferation , even prolonged duration disease . Physical activity improve insulin secretion via unknown underlying mechanism . We recently observe Interleukin-6 induces glucagon like Peptide ( GLP ) -1 production release islet alpha-cell intestinal L-cell . Furthermore , exercise induces release Interleukin-6 skeletal muscle result elevated circulate Interleukin-6 level . Therefore hypothesize exercise-induced Interleukin-6 promotes glucagon like peptide-1 secretion islet α-cell intestinal L-cell , thereby provide mechanism physical activity help maintain improve beta-cell function patient type 1 diabetes . This mechanism enhance concomitant dipeptidyl peptidase-IV inhibition . Physical activity also know enhance insulin sensitivity attenuate immune system activity . Therefore combine physical activity dipeptidyl peptidase-IV inhibition aim allow beta-cell regeneration interventional randomize open-label study .</brief_summary>
