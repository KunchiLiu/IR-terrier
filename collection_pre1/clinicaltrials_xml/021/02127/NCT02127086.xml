	<brief_title>Managing Acute Pain Critically Ill Non-communicative Palliative Care Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The Multiple Principal Investigators ( MPIs ) Dr. Deborah McGuire ( VCU ) Dr. Carl Shanholtz ( University Maryland . University Maryland Medical Center ( UMMC ) deliver palliative care acutely ill person across range age , medical illness , traumatic injury death foregone conclusion . Data collect eight inpatient acute care nurse unit , group service define medical specialty patient : Medical Intensive Care Unit , Medical Intermediate Care Unit ( IMC ) , Neuro-Trauma IMC Unit , Neuro-Trauma Critical Care Unit , Multi-trauma Critical Care Unit , Select Trauma IMC Unit , Select Trauma Critical Care , Surgical Intensive Care Unit . Average lengths stay highly variable generally week less . This one site , quasi-experimental cohort control group design , conduct two sequential phase repeat measure two different comparable cohort . The primary aim test whether pain algorithm incorporate Multi-dimensional Pain Assessment Tool ( MOPAT ) analgesic order set improves pain severity use pharmacologic pain management strategy critically ill non-communicative palliative care patient hospitalize medical , surgical , trauma intensive care unit compare patient without algorithm . The secondary descriptive aim : ( S1 ) compare pain severity use pharmacologic pain management strategy patient without concurrent pain-related condition , ( S2 ) describe pattern patient ' pain time , ( S3 ) evaluate nurse ' perception clinical utility pain algorithm . This study two sample : non-communicative palliative care patient acute pain nurse use PAIN Algorithm order set manage patient ' pain . Patients 300 critically ill adult non-communicative variety reason ( intubation , neurological impairment , etc . ) condition know produce acute pain . Patient data collection collect 7 day ( day 1 7 ) patient dy , regain ability self-report pain , transfer non-participating unit , discharge , whichever come first . This timeframe base average lengths stay non-communicative patient unit , quality care benchmarks pain relief self-reporting patient , practical consideration research acutely ill individual . Volunteer Staff Nurse data collect baseline monthly 24-36 month . Study Phase 1 occur introduction pain algorithm occur Phase 2 . Prior start phase , nurse train use MOPAT incorporate pain standard care electronic medical record ( EMR ) , permit comparison pain assessment data Phases 1 2 . The MOPAT replace Checklist Nonverbal Pain Indicators ( CNPI ) , currently use ass pain non-communicative patient multiple limitation . Following 6 week run-in period nurse ' appropriate universal use MOPAT assess assure , data collection begin . Patients cohort comprise usual care group ( UCG ) , control cohort . Nurses also enrol participate inpatient unit . Usual care define pain assessment management practice nurse currently perform study unit , include inconsistent use exist algorithm protocol . Data collect patient nurse accrue 150 patient . Study Phase 2 begin follow completion Phase 1 . Prior start phase , pain algorithm , christen Pain Assessment Intervention Non-communicative ( PAIN ) Algorithm , introduce nurse physician participate unit train use . The PAIN Algorithm couple MOPAT analgesic order set . The final algorithm specific numerical cut point derive consensual process . In addition , order order set , adaptation accommodate patient demographic medical variable finalize detailed collaborative process . After 6 week run-in period assure appropriate use PAIN Algorithm , data collection begin . Patients enrol phase 2 consider intervention group ( IG ) , also call experimental cohort . We collect patient nurse data Phase 1 , addition nurse perception clinical utility PAIN Algorithm , continue accrue 150 patient . Considerations regard potential risk patient follow . Because algorithm include opioids , patient target study critically ill numerous pathological process could adversely affected drug , concern adverse opioid-related side effect sedation respiratory depression . To deal concern , PAIN Algorithm order set include order routine monitoring side effect intervention manage , example , titrate opioid dose use reverse agent case severe respiratory depression . To ensure order conform standard safe practice , interdisciplinary panel develop analgesic order set conjunction researcher build drug side effect assessment , treatment , reassessment . Another area potential risk , however , remain concern . Since MOPAT instrument relatively new pain assessment tool , medication decision make use MOPAT Behavioral Dimension score , possibility treatment decision may under-medicate , overmedicate patient 's pain . Thus , even careful attention drug side effect , study probably great minimal risk . There alternative treatment procedure , since PAIN Algorithm integrate clinical practice standard care patient study . There anticipated potential risk volunteer study nurse consent participate study . Since PAIN Algorithm analgesic order set incorporate standard care nurse inpatient unit use whether consent participate study . Those nurse consent provide demographic practice data , provide monthly appraisal usefulness MOPAT Phase 1 , PAIN Algorithm ( include MOPAT ) Phase 2 affect study intervention . Because always risk opioid-induced side effect opioids use manage pain , PAIN Algorithm analgesic order set include provision monitoring , detect , manage side effect thus make algorithm potentially safer usual care generally include side effect monitoring . There physical psychosocial risk nurse consent participate study . For patient nurse subject , protection confidentiality concern . Therefore , patient nurse data collection form contain unique study identification number , master list keep lock file cabinet lock project office . When study complete , list destroy data identify study identification number . Only PI project manager access list study . Standard operate procedure analysis activity , recruitment , data collection , data management , data analysis , report adverse event , change management outline study manual operating procedure . Source data include : electronic medical record , patient 's paper chart , data collection `` teleforms '' . The manual operation also include standard operating procedure data entry , transfer , quality assurance . `` Teleforms '' build quality check include predetermine rule range consistency study data field . The plan statistical analysis follows.The primary aim test decrease pain severity intervention group compare usual care group , use interaction F-test 2 x 4 repeat measure analysis . If test assumption meet , miss data , mixed linear modeling use require sphericity complete data . Specific comparison also make group 2 4 day use interaction contrast . The number total dosage pharmacologic intervention compute time period use American Pain Society equi-analgesic table.To test increase number pharmacologic agent use pain increase total equi-analgesic dosage pharmacologic agent use pain 2 X 3 ANOVA mixed linear model approach use depend whether assumption meet . To address covariates control unit-based effect , first comparison unit identify unit-level difference , type service ambient environment , might relate patient outcome include hierarchical linear model conduct . Patient demographic variable age gender clinical variable pain-related condition , type pain co-analgesics , Glasgow Coma Scale score examine relationship outcome incorporate factor covariates depend level measure strength bivariate relationship . These variable incorporate hierarchical model , unit-level difference relevant , analysis covariance multiple regression model . The secondary aim analyze use descriptive approach . For ( S1 ) patient categorize basis whether pain-related condition use Clinical Classification System 2 x 4 repeat measure analysis use compare two group pain severity 2 x 3 repeat measure analysis compare number type drug category total dosage pharmacologic agent . If significant interaction effect , group compare time point post-hoc analysis . For ( S2 ) descriptive pattern patient ' pain time examine . Of interest whether sub-groups patient demonstrate different pattern . A graphic technique ( e.g. , spaghetti plot ) use identify sub-groups attempt describe base clinical demographic variable . In addition , compute change pain time period plot cumulative distribution function time point initial step identify potential cut point define clinical important change . To evaluate nurse perception clinical utility PAIN Algorithm MOPAT ( S3 ) , examine frequency distribution response item Clinical Utility Questionnaire ( CUQ ) overall summate response . For CUQ item use evaluate MOPAT utility phase , response compare use t-tests . In addition , percentage nurse agree strongly agree statement make comparison base nurse demographic practice characteristic do .</detailed_description>
