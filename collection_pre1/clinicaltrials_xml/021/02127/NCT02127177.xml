	<detailed_description>Obstructive sleep apnea ( OSA ) common sleep disorder characterize recurrent episode partial complete obstruction upper airway sleep , result sleep fragmentation oxyhemoglobin desaturation . OSA recognize important public health problem develop country , affect 9 24 % middle-aged female male , respectively . OSA , however , recognize abnormality majority n't get attention people China . Increasing evidence indicates severe OSA associate increase cardiovascular morbidity mortality , mainly due acute myocardial infarction stroke . Atherosclerosis key mechanism cardiovascular event . Numerous study explore relationship hypertension OSA . And study confirm OSA important identifiable cause hypertension raise blood pressure show fall effective continuous positive airway pressure ( CPAP ) treatment . Dyslipidemia , establish independent risk factor coronary heart disease ( CHD ) atherosclerosis , common patient OSA . But limited interventional data OSA lipidemia , show controversial result . Several studies9,10 show direct relationship OSA lipid profile , independently obesity , study demonstrate obesity , confound factor , contribute dyslipidemia among OSA patients.11,12 Taken together , adiposity strong confounding factor interpretation causal relationship dyslipidemia OSA . Few study focus nonobese patients.10,13 There small number randomize trial examine effect CPAP fasting lipid profiles14,15 none specifically design evaluate lipid profile . Furthermore , study assess impact CPAP OSA-related lipid without statin therapy . In way , may useful avoid disturb condition due statin treatment . But impractical patient OSA CHD . Since statin , addition decrease hyperlipidemia level , also inhibit inflammatory cytokine play critical role plaque stabilization CHD patient . Similarly , condition exist examination high-sensitivity C-reactive protein ( hs-CRP ) CHD subject OSA . Therefore , aim present study ( 1 ) establish whether CPAP therapy decrease lipid profile hs-CRP level nonobese patient CHD OSA , ( 2 ) establish whether relationship exist severity OSA level circulate marker , ( 3 ) demonstrate possible mechanism prevention cardiovascular disease .</detailed_description>
