	<brief_summary>In 2010 , 25.8 million people US , 8.3 % population report diabetes . Type 2 diabetes mellitus ( T2DM ) especially prevalent among old adult : 26.9 % people 65 year old diabetes 50 % pre-diabetic . Diabetes lead cause blindness , kidney disease lower-limb amputation among old adult , also major risk factor cardiovascular disease . Fortunately , diabetes related complication amenable lifestyle change . Engagement healthcare provider significantly affect behavior disease management practice individual social engagement . The use mobile technology well engagement provider peer support network may support diabetes self-care management . Individual patient personality attribute may affect success technology intervention . In study , investigator propose design test motivation psychology-based smart engagement system ( MOSES ) , software application digital tablet device . The pre-loaded tablet provide adult T2DM ( age 60+ high glucose ) . The software allow patient record diabetes self-care activity ( exercise , glucose , nutrition , medication adherence ) , pursue goal , support communication patient health coach , support communication peer patient , visualize health status easily patient provider . This research program enroll 88 patient ( 4 intervention group 12 person 40-person control group ) 90-day pilot study test refine design application effectiveness support care plan goal . Primary Aim 1 : Design , implement , optimize motivation psychology-based smart engagement system ( MOSES ) old adult diabetes . Secondary Aim 2 : Determine provide old adult diabetic patient care manager peer via digital tablet-based software application lead improve diabetes management measure blood glucose control . Secondary Aim 3 : Refine personality attribute use tailor interaction application .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The investigator propose conduct 90-day pilot study establish effect value MOSES management diabetes . The pilot study provide initial data answer follow research question : ( 1 ) What effect MOSES technology old adult ' diabetes self-care ? ( 2 ) What type social engagement intervention effective aspect diabetes care ? ( 3 ) What personality characteristic predict old adult ' diabetes self-care ? ; ( 4 ) What personality characteristic moderate effectiveness mobile device ( esp . tablet-based ) social engagement intervention older adult ' diabetic care ? ( 5 ) What model develop data predict probability effective response intervention tailor individual patient , e.g . message type clinical , usage personality attribute ? Subjects Older adult target population study . Adult volunteer age 60 HbA1C &gt; 7.9 % capacity provide inform consent eligible participate . Participants randomize usual care intervention group ( describe ) . Once enrol study randomize either intervention control group , Research Certified Diabetes Educator ( CDE ) review participant ' clinical data assist provide feedback message participant regard self-care progress . The Research CDE alert physician clinical data would warrant change clinical management ( e.g . hyper hypoglycemia ) . Manipulations There four manipulation experiment : ( 1 ) patient record i.e . use tablet app track review progress ( increase mindfulness , engagement , activation , informedness , thereby lead healthy behavior control condition ) , ( 2 ) patient record physician involvement via Health-feed communication message ( addition benefit list , provide expert feedback trust source action , help goal setting , provide motivational reinforcement positive behavior sanction negative , etc . ) , ( 3 ) patient record peer interaction i.e . use Health-feed message , Community Views Health Tournaments ( addition benefit list ( 1 ) , peer effect observe variety different setting educational attainment ) . People tend emulate behavior peer , set motion cycle group conformism . People may also motivate desire compete peer setting , ( 4 ) patient record peer interaction AND physician involvement . This final group permit analysis interaction effect two form social engagement . Thus , experiment do follow group : - Group A : control group , usual care , ( n=40 ) - Group B : individual patient use app w/o provider support ( n=12 ) - Group C : individual patient use app w/ provider support ( n=12 ) - Group D : peer patient team use app w/o provider support ( n=12 ; 4 team ) - Group E : peer patient team use app provider support ( n=12 ; 4 team ) Groups assign achieve age , gender HbA1C match baseline . For group provider engagement ( E ) , provider ( endocrinologist/CDE ) provide initial advice subject , well continuous monitoring . The study require dedicate diabetes educator , spend 2 hour day keep touch subject , include review activity log , send reminder motivational message , well moderate discussion peer engagement group . The CDE triage text message subject trigger physician engagement necessary . The study CDE review participant data routinely maintain communication study team timely basis . During experiment , adverse event closely monitor physician CDE , well subject self-reports . The MOSES app built-in function highlight potential adverse effect activity list physician to-do list . The investigator also conduct weekly review subject activity log .</detailed_description>
