	<brief_summary>This open-label , single-arm , multicentre , global , phase II study design evaluate efficacy safety AZD6094 patient papillary renal cell carcinoma ( PRCC ) treatment naïve previously treat . An independent central pathology review tumour sample use confirm diagnosis PRCC patient enrol . However , locally available pathology result confirm PRCC allow timely study entry .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Phase II Trial Evaluate Efficacy AZD6094 ( HMPL-504 ) Patients With Papillary Renal Cell Carcinoma ( PRCC )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The study comprise two stage . In Stage 1 approximately 20 patient enrol . This group consider sufficient provide preliminary assessment anti-tumour activity AZD6094 form non-binding futility analysis . If ≤ 2 tumour response observe first 20 evaluable patient termination study consider take account relevant molecular profile patient additional information related study drug development programme . All patient enter study take AZD6094 600 mg mouth ( PO ) daily ( QD ) . Treatment give continuously . Following baseline assessment , efficacy assess objective tumour assessment every 6 week ( ±7 day ) , first 12 month every 12 week thereafter objective disease progression define RECIST v1.1 There data cut-off patient complete least 12 week treatment AZD6094 withdrawn . The database lock data analysis perform dataset . Any patient still receive study drug time data cut-off able continue receive AZD6094 derive clinical benefit . Such patient continue monitor occurrence serious adverse event 28 day last dose AZD6094 . After database lock ( DBL ) tumour assessment perform every 12 week ( ±7 day ) objective disease progression define RECIST v1.1 . Patients discontinue treatment due document disease progression enter survival follow-up period , follow initiation subsequent anti-cancer therapy every 3 month death , loss follow-up withdrawal consent , whichever come first . Patients discontinue treatment prior document disease progression enter progression-free survival follow-up period continue disease assessment every 6 week ( ±7 day ) first 12 month follow-up every 12 week thereafter objective disease progression define RECIST v1.1 , death , loss follow-up withdrawal consent , whichever come first . After DBL , tumour assessment perform progression free survival patient population every 12 week ( ±7 day ) objective disease progression define RECIST v1.1</detailed_description>
