	<criteria>Male female patient 18 85 year age . Signed date informed consent document . Major abscess , surgical site infection , traumatic wound infection cellulitis suspect confirm caused Grampositive bacteria . At least two ( 2 ) local sign symptom ABSSSI least one ( 1 ) systemic sign infection . Patient willing able comply study procedure . A contraindication dalbavancin Pregnant nursing female . Sustained shock . Participation another study investigational drug device within 30 day . Receipt systemically topically administer antibiotic Grampositive spectrum achieve therapeutic concentration serum site abSSSI within 14 day prior randomization . An exception allow patient receive single dose shortacting ( halflife ≤ 12 hour ) antibacterial drug prior randomization ; 25 % subject may receive therapy . Infection due organism know prior study entry resistant dalbavancin vancomycin ( vancomycin MIC ( minimum inhibitory concentration ) &gt; 8 μg/mL ) . Evidence meningitis , necrotizing fasciitis , gas gangrene , gangrene , septic arthritis , osteomyelitis ; endovascular infection , clinical and/or echocardiographic evidence endocarditis septic thrombophlebitis . Infections cause exclusively Gramnegative bacteria ( without Grampositive bacteria present ) infection cause fungi , whether alone combination bacterial pathogen . Venous catheter entry site infection . Infections involve diabetic foot ulceration , perirectal abscess decubitus ulcer . Patient infected device , even device remove . Examples include infection : prosthetic cardiac valve , vascular graft , pacemaker battery pack , joint prosthesis , hemodialysis catheter , implantable pacemaker defibrillator , intraaortic balloon pump , leave ventricular assist device , peritoneal dialysis catheter , neurosurgical device ventricular peritoneal shunt , intracranial pressure monitor , epidural catheter . Gramnegative bacteremia , even presence Grampositive infection Grampositive bacteremia . Note : If Gramnegative bacteremia develop study , subsequently find present Baseline , patient remove study treatment receive appropriate antibiotic ( ) treat Gramnegative bacteremia . Such patient must EOT visit perform within 3 calendar day discontinue study medication require AEs ( adverse event ) report Final Visit . Patients whose abSSSI result sustain full partial thickness burn . Patients infection involve limb evidence critical ischemia affect limb define follow criterion : absent abnormal Doppler wave form , toe blood pressure &lt; 45 mm Hg , ankle brachial index &lt; 0.5 , and/ critical ischemia assess vascular surgeon . Patients abSSSI superficial/simple cellulitis/erysipelas , impetiginous lesion , furuncle , simple abscess require surgical drainage cure . Concomitant condition require antibiotic therapy would interfere assessment study drug condition study . Anticipated need antibiotic therapy longer 14 day . Patients place hyperbaric chamber adjunctive therapy abSSSI . More 2 surgical intervention ( defined procedure conduct sterile technique typically unable perform bedside ) abSSSI , patient expect require 2 intervention . Medical condition chronic inflammation may preclude assessment clinical response therapy even successful treatment ( e.g. , chronic stasis dermatitis low extremity ) . Absolute neutrophil count &lt; 500 cells/mm3 . Known suspected human immunodeficiency virus ( HIV ) infect patient CD4 ( cluster differentiation 4 ) cell count &lt; 200 cells/mm3 past current acquire immunodeficiency syndrome ( AIDS ) define condition unknown CD4 count . Patients recent bone marrow transplant ( posttransplant hospital stay ) . Patients receive oral steroid &gt; 20 mg prednisolone per day ( equivalent ) receive immunosuppressant drug organ transplantation . Patients rapidly fatal illness , expect survive 3 month . Other severe acute chronic medical psychiatric condition laboratory abnormality may increase risk associate study participation investigational product administration may interfere interpretation study result , judgment investigator , would make patient inappropriate entry study . Prior participation study .</criteria>
