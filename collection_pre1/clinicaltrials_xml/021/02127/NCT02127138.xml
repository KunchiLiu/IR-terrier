	<brief_title>The Study Active Transfer Plaque Technique Unprotected Distal Left Main Bifurcation Lesions</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>It prospective , multi-center , randomize , open-label , non-inferiority trial . A total 316 subject around 20 selected hospital randomize 1:1 basis either Active transfer Plaque ( ATP ) stenting technique Provisional T stenting technique . In ATP treatment bifurcation lesion , balloon pre-dilation target side branch , plaque actively transfer side branch main vessel . Subsequently , plaque fix expansive stent main vessel.As provisional T treatment , provisional T stenting typic step-T stenting . In brief , two wire advance distal MV SB . Pre dilation leave operator 's discretion , however , pre dilate SB encourage . Kissing balloon inflation stenting MV leave operator 's discretion . A stent stent/artery ratio 1.1:1 inflated MV . Rewire SB also leave operator 's discretion . FKBI recommend least one following : residual stenosis &gt; 70 % , &gt; type B dissection TIMI flow &lt; 3 . All patient follow clinically 1- , 6- 12- 24-month stent implantation . Repeat angiography perform patient 13 month index procedure . The primary endpoint trial rate TLR 12-month follow-up .</detailed_description>
