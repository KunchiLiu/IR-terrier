	<brief_summary>Extended period tilt table stand observe improve spasticity individual spinal cord injury ( SCI ) . The purpose study determine effect three session whole body vibration tilt table stand spasticity individual complete incomplete SCI neurological level T10 . Participants study undergo whole body vibration stand tilt table total approximately 14 minute total 3 session 3 separate day . Spasticity monitoring evaluate prior intervention Modified Penn Spasm Frequency Scale , interview obtain individual 's perception impression effect whole body vibration performance activity daily live , quality life , pain scale , global impression change .</brief_summary>
