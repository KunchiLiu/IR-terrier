	<brief_title>Anti-adhesion Effect GUARDIX-SGⓇ Gastric Cancer Surgery</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Adhesive bowel obstruction relatively often complication patient abdominal surgery Gastric cancer frequent cancer Korea . The incidence adhesive bowel obstruction would increase patient gastric cancer , especially associate radical lymphadenectomy . The cause postoperative adhesive obstruction include adhesion wound , adhesion small intestine small intestine , adhesion small intestine abdominal organ , internal hernia . Several study report efficacy adhesive preventing agent colorectal resection . Gastrectomy associate high risk ( incidence , 11.7 % -38.5 % ) bowel obstruction . To date , however , randomize study show GUARDIX-SGⓇ reduces rate small bowel obstruction gastrectomy radical lymphadenectomy gastric cancer .</detailed_description>
