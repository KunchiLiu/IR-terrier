	<brief_title>Efficacy Micro-Patterned Foley Catheter Reduce Catheter-Associated Urinary Tract Infection</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Roughly half two million nosocomial infection occur year associate use medical device . Approximately 30 million urinary catheter insert year bladder five million patient , catheterize patient risk develop catheter-associated symptomatic urinary tract infection . About 95 % urinary tract infection associate use urinary catheter . Not catheter associate urinary tract infection common nosocomial infection general , also common infectious reason admission hospital among population 275 thousand Americans spinal cord injury , expand approximately 12 thousand person year . Hospital-acquired infection boost today 's healthcare cost billion dollar healthcare provider increasingly responsible shouldering cost . Catheter-associated symptomatic urinary tract infection usually cause organisms originate patient 's colonic perineal flora , hand healthcare personnel catheter insertion manipulation collection system . Microbial specie predominantly migrate bladder extraluminally via mucoid film form catheter surface urethra . Current approach prevent catheter-related infection include antimicrobial modification catheter surface . Although antimicrobial-based catheter aim eradicate bacteria reside vicinity catheter surface , result antibiotic resistance , could serious implication patient care . A novel urinary catheter , Micro-Patterned Foley catheter develop incorporate micro-pattern texture surface ; texture small see feel , demonstrate impressive effect laboratory inhibit microbial attachment surface microbial migration along micro-patterned catheter segment . The objective study determine whether novel Micro-Patterned catheter delay onset catheter associate urinary tract infection catheterize spinal cord injure patient . If successful , catheter help improve quality patient care reduce cost care reduce need antibiotic treatment . This finding could extend patient population require urinary catheterization .</detailed_description>
