	<brief_summary>The investigator recently become proficient new , believe effective technique polyp removal . Known Endoscopic Submucosal Dissection ( ESD ) . ESD involve remove polyp one piece . It preferable remove polyp one piece minimise chance leave residual polyp tissue behind . There also recent study overseas show new technique quite effective . In study , half patient receive newly develop technique polyp removal ( ESD ) , half receive conventional Endoscopic Mucosal Resection ( EMR ) treatment . This study allow u show technique result low recurrence rate effective .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Comparison Rectal Endoscopic Submucosal Dissection Endoscopic Mucosal Resection</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>EMR effective procedure lesion small 20 mm . With size polyp remove en bloc . En bloc resection preferred minimises likelihood residual adenoma enhances histological assessment . It also curative superficially invasive submucosal disease . It eliminate need surgery patient . With lesion large 20 mm , lesion remove piece meal , often 5 piece . Care take ensure adenoma leave behind point overlap snare resection . However , every additional snare resection , possibility small amount adenoma leave behind overlap point . Overall , literature suggest approximately 15 % residual adenoma rate repeat colonoscopy 3 month , require treatment . With en bloc resection residual adenoma rate repeat colonoscopy close 0 % . This balanced relative inexperience perform ESD , long procedure time high complication rate . A randomized trial near completion compare endoscopic snare resection transanal surgical resection rectal polyp ( 24 ) . Should trial show en bloc resection superior achieve complete resection without recurrence similar complication rate , endoscopic treatment strategy large colorectal adenoma reconsider . Since en bloc resection technically challenging , consequence credentialing , referral pattern performance removal large colorectal polyp reference center . Thus , en bloc resection promote superior , train intensified comply standard safe oncologic resection lesion , efficacy safety proven comparative randomize trial .</detailed_description>
