	<brief_summary>Over past year , arterial closure system tend replace manual compression ensure hemostasis femoral artery puncture point . Arterial closure system reduce hemostasis patient immobilization time , thus enable early resumption walking . These device contribute extensively development outpatient stay cardiology , vascular neuro-radiology procedure . According certain study however , would appear arterial closure device present great benefit manual compression term hemostasis complication . Moreover , use increasingly small diameter instrument would tend render manual compression sufficient . Finally , use device generate additional cost . The purpose study evaluate feasibility safety manual compression early resumption walk patient manage conventional hospitalization diagnostic therapeutic endovascular procedure retrograde femoral puncture 5F guide catheter .</brief_summary>
