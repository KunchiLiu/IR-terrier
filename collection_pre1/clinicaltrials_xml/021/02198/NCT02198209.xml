	<brief_summary>Type 2 diabetes chronic disease reach epidemic proportion . In order improve strategy prevent treat type 2 diabetes investigator need good understand mechanism disease , way current therapy , drug liraglutide , work control blood sugar . It known liraglutide act via increase secretion hormone insulin pancreas , hormone turn control blood sugar . However , know whether liraglutide also action liver . Animal study suggest liraglutide might act control liver enzyme glucokinase ( GCK ) , enzyme increase blood sugar uptake liver . This could crucial mechanism liraglutide control blood sugar independently insulin , thus make beneficial type 2 also type 1 diabetes . The effect liraglutide GCK activity yet measure human . The investigator propose investigate acute chronic effect liraglutide GCK use simple , widely use procedure ( IntraVenous Glucose Tolerance Test-IVGTT ) novel approach ( mathematical modeling data obtain procedure ) , assess GCK activity people type 2 diabetes . The investigator first compare data obtain form 2 IVGTTs ( without liraglutide ) perform 1 week apart ( acute effect ) . The investigator give liraglutide patient 6 week another IVGTT measure GCK activity ( chronic effect ) . Data obtain study use understand mechanism liraglutide action well employ current therapeutic option develop new strategy prevent treat diabetes .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Liraglutide Actions Liver : Effects Glucose Phosphorylation</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>It know liraglutide impact favorably glucose homeostasis type 2 diabetic patient , exact mechanism effect . In particular , liraglutide 's acute chronic effect liver well understood . The aim study determine whether liraglutide acutely and/or chronically change hepatic GCK activity vivo type 2 diabetic patient , quantify effect . We hypothesize liraglutide increase GCK activity result increase hepatic glucose uptake , contribute lower glycemia . Our specific aim : 1. measure liraglutide 's acute effect GCK activity change vivo type 2 diabetic patient ; 2. ass whether chronic treatment liraglutide determines change liver GCK activity type 2 diabetic patient , assess IVGTT . We expect liraglutide acutely and/or chronically increase GCK activity , thus contribute high liver glucose uptake low glycemia . Primary endpoint 1 . GCK activity ( acute effect ) IVGTTs without liraglutide administration . GCK activity calculate base lactate glucose measurement IVGTT 2 . GCK activity IVGTTs 6 week liraglutide treatment ( IVGTT3 ) . Secondary endpoint 1 . SI-IVGTT ( insulin sensitivity intravenous glucose tolerance test ) quantify MINMOD analysis IVGTT 2 . Acute insulin response glucose ( AIRg ) disposition index ( DI-MINMOD ) , ability beta cell compensate change insulin sensitivity . This study design investigate effect liraglutide type 2 diabetes therefore subject select type 2 diabetes population Los Angeles basin area . The study population represent type 2 diabetic ( age 18-65 old , T2DM diagnose current American Diabetes Association diagnostic criterion ( HbA1c ≥ 6.5 % fast plasma glucose ≥ 126 mg/dl 2h plasma glucose ≥ 200 mg/dL OGTT patient classic symptom hyperglycemia hyperglycemic crisis random plasma glucose ≥ 200 mg/dl ) .</detailed_description>
