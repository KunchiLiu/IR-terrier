	<brief_summary>In mainland China , knee Osteoarthritis ( OA ) lead cause disability old person . Total knee arthroplasty ( TKA ) generally regard orthopaedic surgeon patient effective treatment end-stage knee OA order relieve pain , correct joint deformity improve life quality patients.However , TKA call one painful Orthopedics surgery due weight bear characteristic knee joint high demand functional exercise within 6-8 week post operation . The targeted application selective cyclooxygenase ( COX ) -2 inhibitor , Parecoxib Celecoxib , significantly reduce level inflammatory reaction one two day postoperation . In addition , perioperative administration Celecoxib directly indirectly relieve postoperative pain , improve articular function eventually augment life quality patient . Recently , effective treatment post-operative pain intravenous follow oral COX-2 specific inhibitor demonstrate many post-operative pain model . Significant morphine spar effect reduction opioid distress symptom also observe . In China , many surgeon accept routine strategy control pain post TKA sequentially give parecoxib 40 mg intravenously twice daily first 3 day post surgery Celecoxib 200mg orally twice daily . Although satisfactory result combination treatment short-term pain reduction functional improvement observe clinical practice , high quality evidence still lack prove effect medium long-term functionality recovery . This study conduct investigate combination regimen intravenous parecoxib follow oral celecoxib post-surgical analgesic treatment osteoarthritis patient undergoing total knee arthroplastic ( TKA ) surgery . Subjects receive double-blinded study medication consist parecoxib injection analgesic dose match placebo follow oral celecoxib acute pain dos match placebo double-blinded fashion . The hypothesis subject treat parecoxib/celecoxib consume less morphine first 24 hour postoperation period , achieve improve pain control study period , quick return functionality , less opioid adverse event treated opioids alone 6-week recovery phase .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Total knee arthroplasty ( TKA ) , though generally regarded effective treatment end-stage knee OA , call `` one painful orthopedics surgery '' due weight bear characteristic knee joint high demand functional exercise within 6-8 week post operation . Parecoxib Celecoxib find able relieve postoperative pain , spare opioid use , improve articular function eventually augment life quality patient TKA . In China , therefore , many surgeon accept routine strategy control pain post TKA sequentially use Parecoxib Celecoxib . However , high quality evidence still lack prove effect medium long-term functionality recovery . This multicenter , double blind , parallel-group randomized study , therefore , aim evaluate efficacy safety postoperative intravenous Parecoxib sodium follow oral Celecoxib OA patient undergo TKA . The hypothesis compare placebo opioids rescue treatment , sequential use Parecoxib/Celecoxib achieve less morphine consumption postoperatively 2 week , also well pain control , quick functional recovery , less opioid related adverse event 6-week recovery phase . The primary objective study evaluate morphine-sparing effect combination treatment Parecoxib Celecoxib versus placebo subject undergoing TKA . The secondary objective compare effect combination treatment versus placebo pain relief , inflammation control functional rehabilitation TKA . Total 86 subject per group would 90 % power detect 100 mg mean difference morphine use Day 14 two group , assume common standard deviation 200 , two-sided alpha level 0.05 . This would result total 172 subject . In consideration 30 % drop out , 246 subject would adequate study . All subject meet study inclusion exclusion criterion randomly assign 1:1 ratio either Parecoxib/Celecoxib group placebo group . The allocation randomization study site based.Data collect use Electronic Data Capture ( EDC ) strict intent-to-treat methodology , i.e. , data Inform Consent Form sign subject include study database.All subject recruit 4 study center China . The study consist 3 phase : initial screen phase must complete within 30 day prior randomization ; 6-week double blind treatment phase ; 6 week follow phase . A two-week wash-out procedure require randomization patient previous use nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drug ( NSAID ) COX-2 specific inhibitors.Variables consider continuous present descriptive statistic : number , mean , standard deviation , median , minimum , maximum ; analyze use parametric non-parametric ANOVA , appropriate . Variables consider categorical tabulated frequency count percentages ; analyze use Chi-square test Fisher 's exact test . All statistical test two-sided alpha=0.05 , i.e. , p value &lt; = 0.05 would consider statistically significant .</detailed_description>
