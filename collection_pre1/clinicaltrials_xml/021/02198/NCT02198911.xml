	<detailed_description>Approximately two-thirds U.S. adult overweight obese , thus place obesity first public health concern U.S. Not obesity detrimental individual level , increase risk chronic disease premature mortality , also present problem economical level increase medical cost . At heart weight management ability appropriately regulate energy intake . A key factor regulation consumption satiation , process eat bout end . Quicker onset satiation may result decreased consumption , important achieve adequate energy balance . Negative energy balance , energy intake less energy expenditure , require weight loss ; however , challenge increase hunger decrease satiation energy intake decrease . One factor believe influence satiation ability increase rate habituation occur eat bout . Habituation basic form learning measure rate decrease consummatory response repeat presentation food orosensory cue . Following decreased response rate particular food , presentation new orosensory cue may result dishabituation previously habituate food well new orosensory cue , thus cause increase consummatory response . Dishabituation eat bout , i.e . exposure variety orosensory cue , may relate recovery appetite decrease satiation , lead calorie-replete individual overconsume . Alternatively , repeat presentation orosensory cue , one becomes accustom taste faster , give rise habituation , increase satiation . A rapid rate habituation would mean less energy consume within eat bout . Research indicate increase weight status relation slow habituation rate well inverse relationship extent orosensory variety habituation rate . Additionally , research show positive association amount orosensory cue amount consume within eat bout . One way provide single orosensory cue initiate enhance habituation minimal amount additional energy intake chew sugar-free , flavored gum . If match flavor food consume , chew gum prior eat bout may increase rate habituation , consequently reduce consumption . Therefore , purpose proof-of-concept study examine chew gum eat bout increase rate habituation subsequently reduce energy intake within eat bout . The outcome study may useful health set create prescription weight-loss , weight maintenance , weight-gain prevention .</detailed_description>
