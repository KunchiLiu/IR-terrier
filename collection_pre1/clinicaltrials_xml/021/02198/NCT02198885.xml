	<brief_summary>The NanoMaxx Ultrasound System ( SonoSite ) connection RP-Xpress ( InTouch Technologies ) provide mean transmit ultrasound image , video , audio remote location real-time . It envision system use diagnose trauma patient suspect pleural effusion , hemothorax , pneumothorax , abdominal blockage prehospital care ; guidance in-hospital physician , paramedic would perform Focused Assessment Sonography Trauma ( FAST ) examination trauma patient transported hospital via ambulance . The investigator hypothesize in-hospital physician interpret ultrasound image obtain paramedic trauma patient ' transportation hospital reduce time diagnosis ; thus , preparation emergency physician , surgeon , operate room team receive critically injured patient may begin early , reduce time intervention critical period patient care . Data also collect regard quality image obtain in-ambulance interaction paramedic physician use remote-presence system .</brief_summary>
