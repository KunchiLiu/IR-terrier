	<brief_summary>The study randomize crossover study anesthesia practitioner intubate three different pediatric infant mannequin ( normal airway , anterior larynx , Pierre Robin syndrome anatomy ) use three different intubation device ( Miller blade , Truview VL , Glidescope Cobalt video-laryngoscope ) two different scenario ( normal neck immobile neck ) . The order presentation randomize . As cross study , subject complete scenario . There placebo group , subject wil control .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Comparison Between Two Video Laryngoscopes , Successfully Intubating Pediatric Mannequins w/wo Difficult Airways</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Participants give individual , standardized instruction demonstration device per manufacturer ' instruction . The participant practice instructor 's feedback infant mannequin normal airway he/she feel comfortable three device . The investigator record prior experience participant use 3 device clinical situation . Each subject ask intubate mannequin device . The choice order device mannequin base Latin square design sequence assign participant base computer generate random number . A closed envelope technique blind participant investigator order airway device mannequin till start individual trial . Participants first finish test unchanged condition repeat process use order mannequin device neck hold immobile simulate scenario child unstable cervical spine . Data different scenario record total number 18 attempt tracheal intubation per participant . Participants ask proceed though operating room assistant available follow command . The order presentation mannequin , airway device scenario randomize describe . The time place device mannequin 's mouth time Ambu bag connect end tracheal tube positive pressure breath give constitute intubation time . During intubation participant ask state obtain best view intubation time record time visualization . The subject assess quality best glottic view Cormack - Lehane grade 1 -4 . The investigator record maneuver optimize visualization larynx tracheal pressure , lip retraction , pull tongue forward etc . The time entry device mouth time tracheal tube start advanced visualization time . The time positive pressure breath give end tracheal tube constitute end attempt intubation . A failed attempt define removal laryngoscope mouth without successful intubation . The number time endotracheal tube advance also record . Failure intubation define unrecognized esophageal intubation , abandon procedure , intubation take long 120 second intubation require 3 attempt . The observer estimate maximum force apply maxilla 0 -10 scale 0= force 10 = maximum force distortion maxilla . The observer also estimate potential damage laryngeal structure 0 -10 scale .</detailed_description>
