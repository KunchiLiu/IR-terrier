	<brief_summary>Title Staged Bilateral Carpal Tunnel Release : Which Side Hurts More ? Primary null hypothesis Patients undergo stag bilateral open Carpal Tunnel Release ( CTR ) difference overall pain intensity pain side . Secondary null hypotheses - There correlation overall pain intensity open CTR surgery distal sensory latency , distal motor latency , electromyography ( EMG ) , demographic , occupation , avocation , relevant comorbidities , dominance , leave vs. right , Pain Self-Efficacy , Patient Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System ( PROMIS ) Upper Extremity PROMIS depression surgery perform within 6 month . - There difference satisfaction treatment time suture removal first second open CTR surgery perform within 6 months.. IRB : 2009-p-001-019 ClinicalTrials.gov : Not mandatory , ( b/o observational ) Authors : Drijkoningen , Braun , Ring Journal : To discuss Design : Prospective cohort study Background Many hand surgeon note patient undergo stag bilateral open carpal tunnel release often experience pain second side . The investigator felt easily testable hypothesis worthy study . Subjects Eligibility : Inclusion : - Age 18 old - Idiopathic carpal tunnel syndrome - No prior surgery carpal tunnel syndrome Exclude : - Pregnant woman - Not fluent English Response Variables : - 11-point ordinal measure overall pain intensity surgery measure time suture removal . - 11-point ordinal measure satisfaction treatment - PROMIS upper extremity Explanatory Variables : - Distal Sensory Latency ( DSL ) - Distal Motor Latency ( DML ) - EMG change - Demographics : age , sex , race , occupation , avocation - Time limit two surgery &lt; 6 month - Relevant comorbidities : Trapeziometacarpal ( TMC ) arthrosis , ulnar neuropathy , trigger finger - Involved hand ( Dominance , Side ) - First side vs. second side surgery - PROMIS Pain Interference Computer Adaptive Testing ( CAT ) - Pain Self Efficacy Questionnaire ( PSEQ-2 ) - PROMIS Depression Methods The investigator study staff invite adult patient ( age 18 old ) present Orthopaedic Hand Upper Extremity Service Department Massachusetts General Hospital ( MGH ) bilateral carpal tunnel syndrome planning stag bilateral carpal tunnel release . Analysis Power analysis An priori power analysis match pair perform . To detect difference two dependent mean effect size 0.5 alpha 0.05 80 % power , total sample size 34 patient needed.As investigator expect patient lose follow-up investigator count 10 % extra , total 38 patient need . Univariate analysis : Variables present frequency percentages categorical variable mean standard deviation median interquartile range respectively normal non-normal distribute continuous variable . Normality continuous distribute variable test paired T-Test . Bivariate multivariable analysis perform subsequently variables probability &lt; 0.10 bivariate analysis insert backward , stepwise , multivariable linear regression analysis ass ability explain variation outcome . The 11 point Likert Pain scale score consider significant difference 1.4 point ( 2.8 SD*0.5 effect size ) scale 1-10 . [ 9 ]</brief_summary>
