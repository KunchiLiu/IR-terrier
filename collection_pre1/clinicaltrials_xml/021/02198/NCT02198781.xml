	<brief_summary>This pilot study effect heart function pace right ventricle ( RV ) . This study aim enrol population clinically indicate receive pacemaker . When normal conduction within heart fail , treatment may implant permanent pacemaker . Pacing involves pass lead via vein heart use electrical impulse stimulate beat . Increasingly available evidence suggest long term RV pacing associate complication - left ventricule ( LV ) dysfunction , heart failure , atrial fibrillation ( AF ) death patient . What see large proportion patient receive pacemaker suffer pace related adverse effect . If could way identify patient group go develop pace induce cardiomyopathy time initial pacing implant , would valuable clinical measure . These patient could identify outset pace biventricular device avoid pace induced cardiomyopathy . Whilst much energy direct towards LV focus clinical marker disease , little publish look RV haemodynamics . We plan study cohort patient clinically indicate receive pacemaker study RV detail time implantation . We use conductance catheter echocardiography determine measure pump function . We follow period six month use echocardiography blood marker heart dysfunction . In patient reduction heart function look common pattern within initial measurement .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Right Ventricle ( RV ) Markers Future Pacing Induced Ventricular Dysfunction - Pilot</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This study design explore whether marker exists within right ventricle ( RV ) may suggest future pace induced dysfunction heart . Pacing heart necessary procedure normal conduction fail . It show patient result deleterious effect pump function leave ventricle acutely chronically . Little look within right ventricular function interacts leave side . The fact dysfunction see patient receive pacemaker important aim use pure haemodynamic measure investigate issue try identify patient may go pace induced dysfunction . This important scientific question answer know patient spar ventricular dysfunction intervention biventricular pace time initial implantation . What know choose group outset . The study design pilot investigation use patient undergo permanent pacemaker therapy . Our study entail one additional catheter pass heart also one inferior vena cava . This measurement heart function perform directly implantation pacemaker add small amount time case . We follow patient take echocardiographic data well blood marker impair ventricular function 6 month . The design study cohort study common exposure pacemaker therapy . We seek take detailed haemodynamic echocardiographic measurement time implantation . This yield powerful data cross reference case adverse ventricular function see due pace follow . We aim perform pilot study feasibility process order ascertain frequency measurable adverse effect population gain early insight marker look . We know data present . This allow future definitive study design appropriate participant number follow period . The follow period 6 month set order fit within time constraint ongoing MD undertaking . Patients book pacemaker implantation per normal course treatment eligible enter study long high anticipate pacing component . This mean patient would expect heart stimulate via pacemaker time normal circumstance care . Patients eligible atrial fibrillation ( AF ) . This decision make patient AF different activation pattern heart due irregularity heart rhythm thus would confound factor study . We approach patient meet eligibility criterion wait list pacemaker implantation . We explain adjunctive procedure Pacemaker implant purely research purpose therapeutic benefit time procedure . We explain follow need study potentially benefit follow closely per research protocol although normal clinical workflow . Any question answer time consent later time preassessment clinic . Written consent obtain prior study . The patient right withdraw trial point . Consent verbally reconfirm procedure . This process record within medical note stage . The additional risk patient insertion venous sheaths femoral vein . This perform routinely every electrophysiology study commonly perform cardiac investigation . Very rarely vein require repair surgeon ( 1 500 ) . Bleeding bruising may occur around sheath . Insertion conductance catheter heart may rarely ( &lt; 1 1000 ) cause structural damage .</detailed_description>
