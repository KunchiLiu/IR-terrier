	<brief_title>Pilot Study Sedation With Propofol Refractory Pains Due Care Palliative Care Unit</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>In palliative care unit , certain patient suffer pain associate medical procedures/care poorly control antalgics . These situation may necessitate temporary sedation improve comfort facilitate treatment . No proven consensus exist , either literature clinical study conduct , choice sedative agent however Midazolam general recommendation . The investigator believe Propofol could use instance . The argument favour Propofol include pharmaco-kinetic characteristic fact currently use circumstance . Propofol action delay rapid Midazolam therefore effect see 1 minute bolus 5 minute Midazolam . The effect short administration last minute however effect Midazolam prolong ( sometimes several hour ) . As Midazolam , titrate use weaker dos , allow sufficient sedation , context interest u , without mark secondary effect . It unreasonable think short action duration Propofol could minimise respiratory risk hour treatment compare Midazolam . With Propofol , patient wake soon painful medical procedure finish , Midazolam sedation may prolong several hour lead risk respiratory depression secretion retention . For reason ; investigator would like verify use Propofol feasible context refractory pain associate medical procedure ( dress change , movement personal care task e.g . wash ) palliative care unit . This preliminary study prior completion extensive multi-centre research project role Propofol could play situation .</detailed_description>
