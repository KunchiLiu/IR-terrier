	<brief_title>Trial Intensive Chemotherapy With Without Volasertib Patients With Newly Diagnosed High-Risk Myelodysplastic Syndrome ( MDS ) Acute Myeloid Leukemia ( AML )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The trial randomize , Phase II , open label multi-center trial adult patient newly diagnose AML high-risk MDS define inclusion/exclusion criterion . An initial safety run-in study perform administer intensive induction therapy consist daunorubicin cytarabine study drug volasertib administer prior chemotherapy , well consolidation therapy consist intermediate-dose cytarabine study drug volasertib administer prior chemotherapy . After establish volasertib dose , randomize Phase II portion trial begin : Patients equally randomize DA ( daunorubicin , cytarabine ) , V-DA ( volasertib administer prior daunorubicin , cytarabine ) , DA-V ( volasertib administer daunorubicin , cytarabine ) . All patient receive second induction cycle reduce daunorubicin cytarabine dos . Patients refractory first induction cycle patient achieve CR/CRi two induction cycle off-study follow . Patients CR/CRi induction therapy proceed consolidation therapy . Consolidation stratify base genetic risk profile ( accord ELN criterion ) patient-related factor ( e.g. , age , HCT-CI , comorbidities , patient wish ) . Patients favorable genetic risk profile patient consider ineligible allogeneic HCT receive repetitive cycle consolidation accord initial randomization , either MiDAC , V-MiDAC ( volasertib administer prior cytarabine ) , MiDAC-V ( volasertib administer cytarabine ) . All patient assign allogeneic HCT .</detailed_description>
