	<detailed_description>In Switzerland 100 ` 000 people live consequence neurological event illness . Most event cause cerebral vascular event , accident , tumor illnesses Multiple Sclerosis ( MS ) .

Over year nurse addition health care provider rehabilitation Center Valens , SG , develop refine intervention specifically enhance patient ' safety , body perception , kinesthetic competence , mobility functionality , reduce burden care . The approach show great promise mobility enhance nurse intervention refer `` Mobilitätsfördernde Pflegeintervention ( MfP ) '' . In first retrospective descriptive study Suter-Riederer et al ( 2008 ) ) show significant improvement functional status daily activity agitate patient due MfP .

Patients ' experience perspective explore narrative interview . Descriptive inferential statistic , p value set .05 , deploy analyze quantitative data . Constant comparative analysis use qualitative data . Expected result We hypothesize group MfP well score increase Extended Barthel Index , less fear fall Fall Efficacy Scale 30 day high quality life usual care group 30 day one month discharge . Additionally hypothesize MfP group less falls longer time first fall usual care group . Secondary outcome enhance movement pattern kinaesthetic competence intervention group compare control .</detailed_description>
