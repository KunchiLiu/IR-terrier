	<brief_summary>Patients end-stage kidney disease maintenance hemodialysis frequently require iron supplementation compensate ongoing iron loss , maintain hemoglobin level without additional use erythropoiesis-stimulating agent ( ESA ) . The investigator aim compare two different intravenous iron preparation , ferric carboxymaltose iron sucrose 140 hemodialysis patient . The investigator primary objective ass whether agent equally effective maintain target haemoglobin within 10-12 mg/dl . The investigator also measure ferritin , transferrin , transferrin saturation , much ESA therapy administer . Patients randomly assign either treatment group follow parallel active study period 40 week .</brief_summary>
