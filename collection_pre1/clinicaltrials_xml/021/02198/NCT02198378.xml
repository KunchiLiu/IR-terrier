	<brief_summary>In management acute coronary syndrome ST-segment elevation ( STEMI ) , early analgesia reduces effect hyperadrenalism increase size myocardial infarction . In order reduce pain intensity , recommendation advocate emergency use morphine . In STEMI patient , analgesic treatment could provide analgesia least effective morphine . The equimolar oxygen/nitrous oxide mixture ( MEOPA ) widely use emergency medicine minor secondary effect rapidly reversible inhalation discontinue . Used association paracetamol , could least equally effective alternative use morphine .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Comparison MEOPA + Paracetamol Versus Morphine Treatment Acute Coronary Syndrome Analgesia .</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The investigator wish compare use morphine accord current recommendation use MEOPA associate intravenous paracetamol management patient STEMI . The investigator hypothesize association MEOPA paracetamol , easy use pre-hospital setting , give patient pain relief effectively morphine . This alternative treatment would avoid use morphine , whose potentially damaging consequence myocardial function suggest experimental study observational study . The physician mobile emergency team ( SMUR ) verify inclusion non- inclusion criterion study . The patient must present STEMI define accordance recommendation chest pain intensity ≥ 4 NRS . The specific treatment STEMI give inclusion study , exception analgesic treatment . In particular , inclusion study must delay initiation strategy recanalization reperfusion . The SMUR physician charge patient administer treatment define randomization . After 30 minute , patient manage accordance recommendation hospitalize , generally cardiology intensive care unit . At one month , clinical research technician record patient 's vital status collect patient 's hospital record .</detailed_description>
