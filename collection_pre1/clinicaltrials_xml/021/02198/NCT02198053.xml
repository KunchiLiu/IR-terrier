	<brief_summary>Different antiplatelet drug play various role coronary artery disease . The mechanisms unclear . Platelet reactivation maybe one major cause . Compared clopidogrel , Ticagrelor powerful antiplatelet drug . However , increase bleed dyspnea risk , load double dose follow second dose time potential risk inconvenient routine clinical work , especially elective PCI comparable stable patient Chinese . The benefit risk balance patient . The investigator suppose load single dose follow second routine time dose superior clopidogrel safer ticagrelor previously prescribe .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Effect Between Platelet Reactivation Antiplatelet Drugs</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>All admission patient divide two group , first group prescribe load dose ( 180 mg ) ticagrelor , second group prescribe 90 mg ticagrelor . We measure platelet activity platelet reactivity use LTA baseline , pre-operation post-operation . All bleed dyspnea event record hospital period . Primary endpoint : platelet activity , platelet reactivity use LTA safety event record hospital period .</detailed_description>
