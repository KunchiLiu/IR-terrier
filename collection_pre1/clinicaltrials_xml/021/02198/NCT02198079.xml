	<brief_title>A Prospective , Multicenter , Collaborative Study Determine Prevalence Nontuberculous Mycobacteria ( NTM ) Pediatric Patients With Cystic Fibrosis Florida</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Non-tuberculous Mycobacteria ( NTM ) heterogeneous group organisms increasingly reported North America 1 , 2 recognize pulmonary pathogen non immunocompromised person , middle age-elderly people , non smoke woman , apart high risk population underlie lung disease , also Cystic fibrosis ( CF ) population . Cystic fibrosis ( CF ) common autosomal recessive disorder Caucasians , result mutation Cystic Fibrosis Transmembrane Regulator ( CFTR ) gene . The carrier rate estimate 1:25 , 1:3500 live birth Caucasians affect CF . A broaden spectrum mutation CFTR gene identify recent year widen array disorder , particularly respiratory system , expect associated genetic abnormality . The predisposition specific airway infection may feature mutation well many modify gene could alter course disease . The disease predominantly affect GI tract respiratory system . Infectious complication latter predominant determinant morbidity life expectancy patient . Patients cystic fibrosis also high risk suffer chronic airway infection , one increasingly identify microorganisms non-tuberculous mycobacteria . NTM show potential contributor decline lung function , major determinant outcome longevity patient . Since patient CF chronic bacterial pulmonary infection disease progress , clinical sign symptom NTM often difficult distinguish underlying disease . Such potential underestimation contribution NTM decline lung function cystic fibrosis may add risk eventual outcome patient . A variety microorganism traditionally consider colonizer airway , increase frequency assume new clinical significance5 , 6 , previously unknown type know organism take new ominous clinical significance.7 To practice clinician NTM appear increase incidence among CF population , significance observation firmly establish . The concept `` colonization , '' define isolation organism respiratory tract without evidence tissue invasion , support several investigator past , mainly association M. avium-complex infection.8 , 9 With emergence high resolution CT scanning ( HRCT ) , appear many patient feature parenchymal involvement , usually nodular pattern , suggest term `` colonization , '' least patient , may erroneous10 , notion also support direct bioptic evidence11 , indicate possibility full significance infection NTM may underappreciated patient CF . It propose rather use terminology colonization active disease , distinction patient require immediate therapy basis rapid progression disease decision delayed.12 The repeated isolation Mycobacterium patient CF may indicative indolent infection patient may risk develop clinical symptom ultimately require treatment . This observation support series autoptic studies13 indicate patient CF multiple positive sputum culture NTM likely histologic evidence granulomatous mycobacterial disease . An additional study11 report patient bioptic evidence granuloma NTM infection result fulminant disease 14 year later , suggest frank infection may subclinical long period time . The predictable variable progression lung disease inherent CF easily uncouple possible contribution chronic infection NTM may add slope decline . Thus role silent infection exacerbate decline pulmonary function patient remain elucidated . From clinical perspective subtle change serial high resolution computerize tomography chest ( HRCT ) may enable early diagnosis intervention prior development cavitation and/or irreversible lung damage.10 Of NTM , Mycobacterium abscessus member rapidly grow mycobacteria . With improvement identification , know organism account approximately 80 % rapidly-growing mycobacterial respiratory disease isolates.9 Prior 1990s , report clinically important NTM infection complicate CF seven case M. abscessus.11 Although natural history disease vary , appear follow fulminant course patient underlie lung disease cystic fibrosis.14 The treatment M. abscessus complex . The isolates uniformly resistant standard antituberculosis drug generally susceptible parenteral antibiotic newer oral macrolides . The organism notoriously difficult eradicate . In report 154 patient infect rapidly grow mycobacteria14 , 10 patient infected M. abscessus exhibit `` cure , '' latter define return respiratory symptom baseline reversion sputum smear culture negativity least 1 year . It note many year rate infection morbidity NTM non-CF patient increasing.1 , 9 This notion recently support report prevalence mycobacterial infection Ontario . The prevalence rise significantly ( p &lt; 0.001 ) 9.1/100,000 1997 16.5/100,000 2002 , 14.2/100,000 2003 . A coincidental significant ( &lt; 0.001 ) decline rate M. tuberculosis infection 6.9/100,000 1997 5.4/100,00 2003 noted15 . Whether trend increase prevalence NTM also occur CF formally address literature . A number study US Europe address epidemiology NTM cystic fibrosis publish . These study suggest large variability incidence nature infect organism various region world , various institution . While clinical impression would support trend increase prevalence NTM CF parallel non-CF patient , absence repeat study limitation impose inconsistency amongst center region , allow firm statement subject . The increase rate infection morbidity NTM non-CF patient 1 , 2 likely similarly trend amongst patient CF . In US , 1992 study University North Carolina Chapel Hill 3 reveal high prevalence CF patient NTM infection southeastern United States . Of 87 patient study 17 ( 19.5 % ) least one positive culture NTM . A 1993 study report University Washington 4 reveal prevalence 12.5 % amongst 64 adult patient . The key publication prevalence NTM patient CF US Olivier et al5 reveal overall prevalence 13 % , common organism adult M. avium- complex ( MAC ) . Data prevalence significance NTM infection young patient CF less clear . Several study suggest NTM infection CF pediatric population low 3-7 number vary around globe . A study Necker Hospital Sick Children Paris8 reveal prevalence 5 % child mean age age 11.9 ( 2.5 22 ) . It also reveal M. abscessus prevail organism among pediatric population , rather MAC , common organism adult . The Olivier study 5 confirm prevalence NTM particularly high southeastern USA , previously suggest study adult CF center University North Carolina Chapel Hill 3 reveal prevalence 19.5 % . It therefore particular interest recent pediatric study medical center 9 retrospectively review CF patient young 12 year old find 6.1 % overall prevalence NTM BALs 3 year , 3.9 % use medical record examination 10- year period . This information collect help deepen understanding nature microbiology CF pediatric population , extent NTM play role colonization possible disease causation region country . The investigator think role underestimate . Once information become available , The investigator able make good plan deal infection .</detailed_description>
