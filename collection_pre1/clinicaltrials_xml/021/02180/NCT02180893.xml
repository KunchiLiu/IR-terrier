	<brief_summary>Pain robotic cardiac surgery know problem often difficult manage . Paravertebral nerve block prove method pain relief follow thoracotomy . A paravertebral block show provide good pain relief minimal side effect , however , paravertebral block robotic surgery well study . Currently investigator routinely perform PVB patient population ( 50 MV robotic case do January October 2012 , 36 receive paravertebral block adverse event note ) . The investigator believe study paravertebral block reduce amount additional pain medication patient require first 24 hour surgery , decrease intubation time improve PACU hospital discharge time .</brief_summary>

	<criteria>patient age 18 year age undergoing robotic mitral valve surgery . capacity understand sign consent form patient candidate paravertebral block per ASRA guideline ( Horlocker , Reg Anesth Pain Med , 2010 ) . In short , include patient take specific anti platelet agent clopidigrel , anticoagulant heparin low molecular weight heparin , patient INR great 1.5. patient history COPD respiratory disease would confound data time extubated excluded . Patients diagnosis chronic pain , patient currently take narcotic exclude , would confound data postoperative narcotic requirement .</criteria>
