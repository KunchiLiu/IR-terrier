	<brief_summary>This study aim provide high quality evidence effectiveness safety hemin ( PanhematinTM , Recordati ) treatment acute attack porphyria . These type study do either PanhematinTM hemin preparation available Europe ( NormosangTM , Orphan Europe ) . There two treatment group study . One group treat PanhematinTM plus glucose , group treat glucose plus inactive salt solution ( call `` placebo '' ) . To avoid prejudice , treatment give participant blind ( mean participant hospital staff know treatment participant receive ) randomize ( mean participant equal chance receive either treatment , like flip coin ) . A placebo-controlled , randomize study standard method use prove treatment effective safe . PanhematinTM glucose give manner usual treat attack porphyria . For participant choose receive placebo , treatment switch real PanhematinTM time symptom improve . This call `` rescue '' treatment , assures study safe patient need hemin receive . Treatment hemin 4 day , longer need . Since study treatment start soon possible symptom appear , little delay provide hemin need .

	<criteria>Male female age 18 year Willing provide write informed consent Acute symptom ( 7 day duration less time enrollment ) abdominal , back and/or limb pain , diagnose investigator cause porphyria initial evaluation exclude cause . Diagnosis acute porphyria document substantial increase urinary serum porphobilinogen ( PBG ) . Type acute porphyria confirm additional testing ( addition increase PBG ) , may complete treatment begin use pretreatment sample : For acute intermittent porphyria ( AIP ) : Normal slight increase plasma fecal porphyrin . Most ( ~90 percent ) deficient activity erythrocyte porphobilinogen deaminase ( PBGD ) , almost ( &gt; 95 percent ) demonstrable diseasecausing PBGD mutation . For hereditary coproporphyria ( HCP ) : Substantial increase fecal porphyrin ( almost entirely coproporphyrin III ) . In absence skin photosensitivity , normal slight increase plasma porphyrin . Almost ( &gt; 95 percent ) demonstrable diseasecausing coproporphyrinogen oxidase ( CPO ) mutation . For variegate porphyria ( VP ) : Substantial increase fecal porphyrin ( mostly coproporphyrin III protoporphyrin ) , increase plasma total porphyrin fluorescence emission maximum dilute plasma neutral pH near 626 nm . Almost ( ~95 percent ) demonstrable diseasecausing protoporphyrinogen oxidase ( PPO ) mutation . Symptoms abdominal , back limb pain explain another condition , judge investigator Therapy hemin within 7 day prior enrollment study Known suspect allergy Panhematinâ„¢ related product Preexisting coagulation defect concurrent treatment anticoagulant Previously document renal impairment define serum creatinine 1.7 mg/dL 150 mmol/L . A diagnosis diabetes mellitus , might increase risk glucose infusion . Heart failure , significant chronic anemia disease condition investigator judge would lead unacceptable risk patient interfere successful collection date trial Previous randomization trial</criteria>
