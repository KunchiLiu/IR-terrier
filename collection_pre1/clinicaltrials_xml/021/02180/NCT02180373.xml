	<brief_title>PREDICT-PVI Understanding Peripheral Restenosis : Genomic Proteomic Determinants Vascular Intervention</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Vascular surgeon 10-15 center ultimately involved . Patients already undergo physician-specified intervention follow , meet enrollment criterion , participate study . The PREDICT study include two independent arm assess restenosis - peripheral vein graft ( VG ) bypass surgery endovascular ( angioplasty superficial femoral artery ( SFA ) stenting ) . In broad outline , approximately 1,000 patient enrolled arm , clinical follow-up two year . Demographic , clinical , procedural data collect baseline . Clinical image data obtain follow period accordance standard post-procedural surveillance practice ( 1 , 3 , 6 , 12 , 18 , 24 month ) . Blood sample obtain genomic DNA plasma biomarkers 3 time point - baseline , 1 month 6 month . The baseline sample provide key information patient advance PAD , often correlate significant coronary disease . Data enter clinical coordinator electronic case report form Remedy Informatics database control Vascular Cures . No PHI include . Paper copy maintain site . Registry data element develop study PI University California San Francisco ( UCSF ) . The Vascular Cures project manager review database monthly basis insure case report form ( CRFs ) complete appropriately manage data . Minor data omission ignore ; coordinator ask re-submit major omission . Site coordinator responsible manage activity related patient .</detailed_description>
