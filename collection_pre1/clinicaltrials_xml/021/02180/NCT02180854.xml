	<brief_summary>Acute deterioration among hospitalised patient result serious adverse event like cardiac arrest , unexpected death unanticipated intensive care unit ( ICU ) admission . Most event preceeded deteriorate vital sign , potentially avoidable . To detect treat hospitalise at-risk patient early early warning score ( EWS ) introduce investigator site . EWS measure number physiological parameter aggregate common score , direct monitoring frequency , clinical intervention competency provider . Patients low score ( 0 - 1 ) monitor every 12th hour seldom experience serious adverse event . The optimal monitoring frequency group unknown , presently base compromise patient safety work load issue . The aim present study explore 8 hourly monitoring interval ( intervention ) correlate good outcome 12 hour interval ( control ) , base number patient deteriorate high EWS 24 hour hospital admission group .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Acute deterioration among hospitalised patient result serious adverse event like cardiac arrest , unexpected death unanticipated intensive care unit ( ICU ) admission . Most event preceeded deteriorate vital sign , potentially avoidable . To detect treat hospitalised patient risk clinical deterioration timely manner , early warning score ( EWS ) introduce investigator site . EWS include measure respiratory rate , arterial hemoglobin oxygen saturation , pulse rate , systolic blood pressure , level consciousness accord AVPU score , temperature , whether patient receives supplementary oxygen . Each vital sign assign 0 3 point ( supplementary oxygen 0 2 ) depend much deviate predefined threshold ; value add aggregate score 0 20 , high score indicate severe disease . An escalation protocol direct type clinical response competency provider accord EWS trigger also introduce integrate part system . Patients low score ( 0 - 1 ) monitor every 12th hour seldom experience serious adverse event . The optimal monitoring frequency group unknown , presently base compromise patient safety work load issue . The aim present study explore 8 hourly monitoring interval ( intervention ) correlate good outcome 12 hour interval ( control ) group patient EWS 0 1 admission . Deterioration base number patient deteriorate high EWS 24 hour first EWS measure . Since serious adverse event population rare primary outcome clinical deterioration define number patient elevate EWS &gt; /= 2 group , 24 hour admission hospital . This cluster-randomized , non-blinded , pragmatic , interventional study acutely admit , adult patient surgical medical ward hospital .</detailed_description>
