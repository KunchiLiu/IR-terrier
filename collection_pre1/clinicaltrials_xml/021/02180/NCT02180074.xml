	<brief_summary>Cardiovascular disease include coronary artery disease peripheral artery disease remain leading cause death among woman United States . The impact cardiovascular woman recognize clinician long time . It evident , woman suffer consequence cardiovascular rate least high observe men still major gap understand disease woman . Hydrogen sulfide ( H2S ) , gaseous mediator play important role cardiovascular system . Research demonstrate 's critical role animal ischemia reperfusion model . Hydrogen sulfide exist distinct biological pool blood . Recently , Kevil lab pioneer development new analytical technique accurate measurement biological pool H2S . By measure distinct pool H2S woman without cardiovascular disease investigator hope understanding role H2S pathophysiology cardiovascular disease . This research help assess ability H2S distinct biological pool potentially diagnostic marker therapeutic target cardiovascular disease .</brief_summary>
