	<brief_summary>Dystonia devastate disorder define involuntary , sustained muscle contraction abnormal posture affect part body . Cervical dystonia ( CD ) pervasive form dystonia affect 60-90,000 individual United States alone characterize involuntary twisting neck . The symptoms CD disabling , disfigure , painful , strongly negative impact quality life , include social withdrawal depression . At present , treatment show long term benefit CD . Standard care ( SOC ) botulinum toxin , temporarily paralyze affected muscle , result reduced muscle spasm . This treatment many undesirable side effect , variable effectiveness , expensive , must repeat every 3 month throughout lifespan . Physical therapy base treatment aim retrain posture stretch dystonic muscle largely ineffective typically deliver part standard care . There urgent need novel effective therapy . Emerging technology , specifically non-invasive brain stimulation ( NBS ) , demonstrate compelling evidence make meaningful impact live people CD . In study , individual cervical dystonia randomly assign receive tDCS 15 minute daily 4 day 1 4 stimulation location group . Hypothesis 1 : One location stimulation result clear benefit least 1 standard deviation ( SD ) improvement CDQ-24 , primary outcome measure , 1-week follow-up . Hypothesis 2 : The cortical silent period sensitive measure investigate demonstrate significant increase inhibition determine elongation silent period affect upper trapezius muscle . Hypothesis 3 : The stimulation location determine effective Objective 1 produce great physiologic change inhibition increase . Hypothesis 4 : The hypothesis aim certain characteristic predict response treatment , strong association see baseline measure ( ) primary outcome measure . A thorough assessment characteristic include : age , sex , duration symptom , genotyping two specific polymorphism , botulinum toxin history , baseline measure outcome variable , measure brain excitability , genetic test predict response .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Study Purpose This study investigate use experimental research device call transcranial direct current stimulation ( tDCS ) . tDCS way stimulate brain potential therapeutic benefit . It work either increase decrease brain excitability . This do delivering current outside head . This weak electrical current pass skull modulates underlie brain tissue . Genetic factor may contribute effectiveness intervention ; therefore , saliva sample collect assess status two gene : Brain derive neurotrophic factor ( BDNF ) apolipoprotein E4 . Our purpose determine best location stimulation tDCS improve symptom quality life people CD . The result study help identify alternative intervention people cervical dystonia . Brain excitability measure use additional form non-invasive brain stimulation , specifically device call transcranial magnetic stimulator . By apply magnetic field outside head , electrical current produce within brain transiently affect brain activity record though electrodes skin . Using procedure , different area brain study gain great understand brain physiology patient cervical dystonia . Procedures Intervention : Briefly , non-invasive brain stimulation deliver safely painlessly via different mechanism goal either excite inhibit underlie brain issue . In focal dystonia , indicate , think lack inhibition , thus setting typically used increase inhibition . Transcranial direct current stimulation ( tDCS ) one device show safe effective modulating excitation inhibition human use extensively variety research application 10 year . In addition potential physiologic benefit alter excitability , tDCS particularly practical technique use people CD , require one 's head remain still , thus apply additional stress impair neck . An investigator deliver tDCS use constant current 2 milliamps ( mA ) use direct current stimulator ( TCT Research Limited , Hong Kong ) via two 35 cm2 saline soak sponge electrode . Treatment 1x/day 4 day . Electrode placement one four location reference term dystonic head-turn rest position ( i.e . head turn leave , primary muscle involve left , contralateral M1 would right hemisphere ) : 1 ) Bilateral M1 cathode contralateral M1 anode ipsilateral M1 , 15 minute ( Goal : decrease contralateral M1 excitability ) ; 2 ) Cerebellum anode ipsilateral cerebellum cathode ipsilateral side face , 15 minute ( Goal : increase ipsilateral cerebellum activation exert inhibitory effect motor circuit ) ; 3 ) M1+cerebellum : M1 first 'primed ' anode contralateral M1 , cathode face , 10 min , follow immediately 15 min cerebellar stimulation # 2 . ( Goal : prime contralateral M1 increase excitability engage potentially large effect follow ipsilateral cerebellar stimulation excite exert inhibitory effect motor circuit include M1 ) ; 4 ) Sham stimulation : electrode placement M1 . Sham tDCS apply ramp current intensity 0 30 second follow standard practice sham tDCS ( Gandiga et al . 2006 ) . Pre-testing ( Day1 ) occur 10 week post standard care ( SC ) visit , participant near impaired level function prior 12 week visit botulinum ( BTX ) injection . tDCS deliver day 1 subsequent day 4 day . Posttesting occur Day5 1 week later prior SC visit ( follow up- day 12 ) . The primary endpoint interest follow one week . Cortical Excitability Testing : Before intervention , single-pulse TMS deliver figure eight coil ( 90 mm wing diameter ) ( MagStim Co. , Whitland , Dyfed , Wales ) , position M1 . The 'hotspot ' M1 contralateral direction dystonic head turn use collect motor evoke potential ( MEPs ) cervical muscle ( upper trapezius ) ipsilateral head turn locate mark scalp . Various measure collect accord establish method assess cortical excitability single pair pulse TMS . Clinical assessment : Severity CD assess intervention . Behavioral measure administer investigator , blind intervention assess pre post intervention follow . The primary endpoint interest Craniocervical Dystonia Questionnaire CDQ-24 . This primary outcome select patient-rated , disease-specific assessment quality life , feel primary issue concern . Secondary measure TWSTRS visual analog scale . CDQ-24 : The CDQ-24 contain 24 item 5 subscales : stigma , emotional well-being , pain , activity daily live social/family life . Internal consistency reliability satisfactory sub-scales total score good sensitivity high test/retest reliability ( Muller , 2004 ) . TWSTRS . Toronto Western Spasmodic Torticollis Rating Scale outcome measure use rate severity , disability pain CD ( Consky et al. , 1990 ) . TWSTRS utilizes three sub-scores physician-based severity ( 0-35 ) , patient-based disability ( 0-30 ) pain ( 0-20 ) high score indicate great severity symptom . Inter-observer reliability excellent ( rs=99 ) good disability pain measurement ( rËƒ0.88 ) . The global severity scale moderate ( rs=0.63 ) ( Salvia et al. , 2006 ) . TWSTRS exam videotape posthoc assessment investigator blind group test period . Visual Analog Scale ( VAS ) . At end intervention session participant ask rate ease movement perceive pain cervical rotation contralateral direction head turn use VAS self-assessment . Adverse reaction . Adverse reaction record use establish reporting form . Genetic Testing : At last session , saliva sample collect genetic screening BDNF apolipoprotein E4 polymorphism . We collect approximately 2 ml ( less one-half teaspoon ) saliva ask subject spit tube . It may take 30 minute provide saliva sample , however , people typically require less time ( approximately 5 minute ) . Collection saliva use Oragene Discover non-invasive anticipated personal risk injury .</detailed_description>
