	<brief_summary>This randomized phase II/III trial study well pazopanib hydrochloride , combination chemotherapy , radiation therapy work compare radiation therapy alone combination pazopanib hydrochloride combination chemotherapy treat patient newly diagnose non-rhabdomyosarcoma soft tissue sarcoma remove surgery . Radiation therapy use high energy x-ray kill tumor cell . Drugs use chemotherapy , ifosfamide doxorubicin hydrochloride , work different way stop growth tumor cell , either kill cell , stop dividing , stop spread . Pazopanib hydrochloride may stop growth tumor cell block enzymes need cell growth . It yet know whether radiation therapy work well give without combination chemotherapy and/or pazopanib hydrochloride treat patient non-rhabdomyosarcoma soft tissue sarcoma .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Radiation Therapy With Without Combination Chemotherapy Pazopanib Hydrochloride Before Surgery Treating Patients With Newly Diagnosed Non-Rhabdomyosarcoma Soft Tissue Sarcomas That Can Be Removed Surgery</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To identify dose pazopanib ( pazopanib hydrochloride ) feasible give combination radiation chemoradiation pediatric adult patient newly diagnose unresected intermediate- high-risk non-rhabdomyosarcoma soft tissue sarcoma ( NRSTS ) . II . To compare rate near complete pathologic response ( &gt; 90 % necrosis ) addition pazopanib preoperative chemoradiation versus preoperative chemoradiation alone potentially resectable &gt; 5 cm , grade 3 intermediate high risk chemotherapy-sensitive NRSTS phase II portion study cohort . III . To compare rate near complete pathologic response ( &gt; 90 % necrosis ) addition pazopanib preoperative radiotherapy versus preoperative radiotherapy alone potentially resectable intermediate high risk adult pediatric NRSTS phase II portion study cohort ( use phase II decision rule go onto phase III portion study ) . IV . To compare rate event-free survival ( EFS ) addition pazopanib preoperative radiotherapy versus preoperative radiotherapy alone localize intermediate high risk adult pediatric NRSTS phase III portion study cohort phase II decision rule pass . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . To estimate rate local failure , regional failure , distant metastasis free survival , disease-free survival , overall survival addition pazopanib preoperative chemoradiation preoperative radiation intermediate high risk adult pediatric NRSTS . II . To compare pattern recurrence ( local , regional distant ) preoperative chemoradiation radiation addition pazopanib adult pediatric NRSTS . III . To define toxicity ifosfamide doxorubicin ( doxorubicin hydrochloride ) chemotherapy radiation use combination pazopanib intermediate high risk adult pediatric NRSTS . IV . To define toxicity preoperative radiotherapy use combination pazopanib intermediate high risk adult pediatric NRSTS . TERTIARY OBJECTIVES : I . To gain insight disease biology childhood adult NRSTS analysis actionable mutation whole genome sequencing . II . To determine microvessel density circulate tumor deoxyribonucleic acid ( DNA ) predict response pazopanib outcome . III . To determine effect pazopanib doxorubicin exposure child adults NRSTS . IV . To evaluate change fludeoxyglucose F 18 ( FDG ) positron emission tomography ( PET ) maximum standard uptake value ( SUVmax ) baseline week 10 13 patient unresected tumor correlate change pathologic response EFS . V. To compare rate response standard image pathologic assessment determine correlate well local tumor control , distant tumor control , EFS , overall survival .
