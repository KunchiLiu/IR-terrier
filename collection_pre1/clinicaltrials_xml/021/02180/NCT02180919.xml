	<brief_summary>The aim study : 1 . Implement telemonitoring programme heart failure obstructive pulmonary disease ( COPD ) /chronic respiratory patient assess real world impact readmission , consults , home visit , quality life economic endpoint . 2 . Explore effect telemonitoring across heart respiratory group respect ) factor influence patient integrate telemonitoring daily routine self care behaviour ii ) healthcare professional use telemonitoring aid decision- making . 3 . Understand impact telemonitoring variety care pathway .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>BACKGROUND Heart failure exacerbation consume 60-70 % cost condition COPD exacerbation lead 1:8 admission costly NHS . The roll-out telemonitoring chronic disease line NHS policy ( Building Telecare England ; High Quality Care All , national health service ( NHS ) next stage Darzi review ) . Despite systematic review , Whole System Demonstrator programme randomise control trial ( RCT ) evidence heart failure , outcome implement telemonitoring unclear , evidence base COPD less consistent , study include economic analysis investigate cross speciality implementation . An Italian trial find telemedicine reduces chronic respiratory admission third , Italian health service differs united kingdom ( UK ) system . The european union ( EU ) Commission Communication telemedicine 2009 stress need new deployment contribute evidence base respiratory disease , include detailed analysis process change determine success . Our group previously show telemonitoring reduces unplanned admission heart failure patient , elderly patient able cope well equipment . The investigator also experience telesupport chronic respiratory patient . RATIONALE FOR CURRENT STUDY The study assess implementation telemonitoring programme demonstrate 1. whether home telemonitoring alert patient health professional exacerbation reduces admission , 2. reasonably implement cross specialty , 3. impact quality life patient , 4. interaction healthcare professional , robustness algorithms self efficacy patient . The cross-over design allows sustain effect self care admission assess removal telemonitoring 6 month first group treat . The acceptability telemonitoring healthcare worker factor aid limit integration care pathway explore . Results inform commission telemonitoring locally/nationally , facilitate buy-in secondary primary care team , optimise cost . OVERALL DESIGN Design : Crossover implementation study patient allocate randomly 1:1 telemonitoring delay entry telemonitoring ( 6 month ) . All patient receive standard optimal medical care accord European Society Cardiology ( ESC ) Heart Failure guideline , National Institute Health Care Excellence ( NICE ) COPD guideline best practice care pathways relevant condition . Each patient receive home telemonitoring 6 month . Comparisons carry patient delay entry ( control ) active telemonitoring . In group receive telemonitoring first 6 month period investigator able assess impact withdrawal subsequent 6 month ie long term benefit . TELEMONITORING Data monitor deliver health care team member personal computer ( PCs ) use dedicate broad band line instal patient home rout via secure Philips Server . Each patient receive education use device and/or family/carer fully confident . Via information display television screen day patient request answer interactive question level breathlessness , sleep quality , phlegm production , wheeze . These result patient used create warn system parameter satisfactory appear green light ; example , drop arterial oxygen saturation increase wheeze , increase weight increase breathlessness see Motiva system generate red light patient need act upon . It interactive system therefore healthcare team member advise patient screen ( eg . increase dose diuretic oxygen flow rate , start antibiotic steroid ) , provide educational material eg . inhaler use exercise , patient respond . Patients also ask several question week whether consult general practitioner ( GP ) , visited Accident Emergency Dept admit hospital .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Heart failure patient : age &gt; 18 year New York Heart Association class IIIV time discharge diagnose ESC guideline . Respiratory patient : age &gt; 18 year diagnosis COPD respiratory insufficiency due chronic respiratory disorder diagnose Consultant Respiratory Physician ( eg . bronchiectasis , chest wall disease , neuromuscular disorder ) arterial oxygen saturation value recent admission exacerbation 90 % ( partial pressure oxygen arterial blood ( PaO2 ) 8.0 kilopascal ( kPa ) ) air , fulfill criterion , receive long term oxygen therapy . Age &lt; 18 year . Cognitive impairment sufficient interfere use telemonitoring system .</criteria>
