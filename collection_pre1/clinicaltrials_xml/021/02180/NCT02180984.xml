	<brief_summary>The presence binge eating ( BE ) core feature bulimic syndrome . Binge eat disorder ( BED ) new category DSM-5 highly associate high body mass index ( BMI ) . The neural mechanism underlie BE great interest order improve treatment intervention . Brain mechanisms underlying drug food crave suggest similar . These mechanism demonstrate hyperactivity orbitofrontal anterior cingulate cortex lack regulatory influence lateral prefrontal circuit . Several novel study begin assess potential benefit brain stimulation reduce crave associate addictive behavior promise result . Previous finding test one-off session repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation ( rTMS ) healthy woman identify strong cravers individual bulimia nervosa bulimic-type eating disorder report reduction food crave BE , provide evidence support broad deep investigation benefit associate rTMS . Importantly , use brain imaging study contribute understand psychiatric disorder underlie mechanism target rTMS intervention . Objectives : The primary aim investigate effect rTMS BE frequency . Secondary aim include evaluation effect rTMS food craving , body weight , brain activity , cognition , general psychopathology , hormonal regulation neurobiological marker . Methods : Sixty obese female BED randomize receive 20 session rTMS ( n=30 ) placebo ( n=30 ) scatter 3 days/week . Expected Results : Primarily expect rTMS intervention decrease BE frequency . Consequently , body weight reduce . It also expect food craving decrease , cognitive performance enhance , neurobiological marker improve .</brief_summary>
