	<brief_title>A Study Adult Outpatients With Opioid Dependence Transitioned From Daily SL Buprenorphine Probuphine® Subdermal Implants</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This randomize , double-blind , double-dummy , active-controlled multi-center study evaluate efficacy transition four 80 mg Probuphine implant adult outpatient opioid dependence , clinically stabilize 8 mg less SL BPN . The study include 3 Phases ; Screening , Maintenance Follow-up . Medical eligibility screen occur within 2 week first Maintenance Phase visit . The Screening Visit include standard medical screening procedure , complete medical/psychosocial history , urine toxicology detail substance use treatment history . All subject provide write informed consent meet study entry criterion eligible randomization . Following confirmation eligibility , subject randomize one two treatment group 1:1 ratio : - Treatment Group A : Daily SL BPN tablet ( ≤8 mg/daily ) + four placebo implant - Treatment Group B : Four 80 mg Probuphine implant + daily SL placebo tablet Implants surgically insert Day 1 ( Baseline Initiation Study Drugs Visit ) . On Post-Implant Visit , additional follow-up safety implant assessment procedure conduct . Subjects return monthly study visit Weeks 4 , 8 , 12 , 16 , 20 , 24 ( End Treatment Visit ) . In addition monthly schedule visit , subject provide 4 random urine toxicology sample throughout 24-week treatment period . A total 10 urine toxicology sample collect ; 6 schedule visit ( 1 per month ) 4 random urine toxicology visit throughout 24-week treatment period . At scheduled visit , assessment efficacy safety collect . Implants remove End Treatment Visit Week 24 . Following Week 24 , subject re-transitioned back usual care ( pre-trial ) , need . During Week 25 , telephone contact make subject . Week 26 include on-site visit clinic final follow-up assessment ( Follow-up Visit ) .</detailed_description>
