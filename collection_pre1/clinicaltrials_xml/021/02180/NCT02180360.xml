	<brief_summary>Background : Nowadays , commonly use sport help enhance physical fitness component , include flexibility , Capoeira . This modality define athletic sport compose individual attack defensive system , originally create colonial Brazil . Capoeira characterize main movement , `` ginga '' , several dodging , unbalancing , traumatize acrobatic movement . The literature empirically discuss Capoeira contribute general physical fitness modulate several variable human movement . Among variable possible highlight influence Capoeira amplitude movement practitioner 's joint . However , study control group investigate alteration flexibility beginner use experimental protocol base exclusively basic technique Capoeira , without apply usual stretching exercise commonly use , independently specificity sport . Objective : To analyze effect eight week basic train Capoeira flexibility beginner sport . Methods : Twenty-one individual , divide two group [ Capoeira , n=13 ; 26.1±7.2 year ; 22.7±2.7 kg.m2 ( -1 ) Control , n=8 ; 27.1±0.5 year ; 24.3±3.3 kg.m2 ( -1 ) ] participate study . The Capoeira group perform eight week basic training ( two session per week last 60 minute ) . The experimental protocol use exclusively base basic technique program Capoeira training system . Before intervention measurement perform aim analyze : trunk flexion flexibility , sit-and-reach test use Wells ' Bench ( WBtf ) ; passive tension ( PThf ) maximum amplitude hip flexion ( MAhf ) goniometry . The hypothesis study group Capoeira ( beginner ) increase linear angular flexibility eight week basic train sport .</brief_summary>
