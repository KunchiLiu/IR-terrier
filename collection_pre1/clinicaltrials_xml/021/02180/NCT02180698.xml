	<brief_summary>This pilot phase I clinical trial study side effect best dose toll-like receptor 4 ( TLR4 ) agonist glucopyranosyl lipid A ( GLA ) -stable-emulsion ( SE ) give together radiation therapy treat patient soft tissue sarcoma spread part body ( metastatic ) remove surgery ( unresectable ) . TLR4 agonist GLA-SE may stimulate immune system kill sarcoma cell . Radiation therapy use high energy x ray kill tumor cell . Giving TLR4 agonist GLA-SE radiation therapy may better treatment treat sarcoma remove surgery .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>TLR4 Agonist GLA-SE Radiation Therapy Treating Patients With Soft Tissue Sarcoma That Is Metastatic Can Be Removed Surgery</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To evaluate safety weekly injection GLA-SE ( TLR4 agonist GLA-SE ) combination palliative radiation patient metastatic sarcoma . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . To look preliminary evidence efficacy distant tumor site follow combination radiation intra-tumor injection GLA-SE . II . To analyze change tumor-immune infiltrates follow radiation intra-tumor injection GLA-SE . OUTLINE : This dose-escalation study TLR4 agonist GLA-SE . Patients receive TLR4 agonist GLA-SE intratumorally weekly 8 week . Within 2 week start treatment , patient also undergo radiation therapy 2 week total 5-6 fraction . After completion study treatment , patient follow every 6 week 6 month every 3 month 1 year .</detailed_description>
