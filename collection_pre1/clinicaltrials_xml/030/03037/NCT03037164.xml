	<brief_summary>Stage A : To evaluate safety efficacy INTERCEPT Blood System Red Blood Cells Pathogen Reduction Treatment ( PRT ) comparison conventional RBCs adult patient require RBC transfusion support . Stage B : To provide early access INTERCEPT pathogen reduction system RBC region substantial proportion population infect risk infection Zika virus ( ZIKV ) , risk asymptomatic infection among qualified blood donor recognize . Besides reduction risk transfusion transmit ZIKV , intent study also reduce risk transfusion-transmitted infection ( TTI ) general , include transfusion relate sepsis emerge concurrent endemic pathogen ( e.g . Dengue Chikungunya ) , reduce risk TA-GVHD . As part treatment use study , additional data provide safety INTERCEPT-treated RBCs ( IBS RBCs ) supply routine clinical transfusion practice .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Stage A Eligible patient randomize transfused study RBCs ( Test Control 1:1 ratio ) accord local practice 28 day transfusion support . Following 28-day transfusion support period , patient transfuse conventional RBC component indicate treat physician . Patients attend post-transfusion follow visit 5-7 28 day last study transfusion routine safety lab , immune reactivity test IBS RBC obtain sample CHIKV , DENV ZIKV viremia ( blood urine RT-PCR ) , DENV/ZIKV/CHIKV serology ( IgM/IgG confirmation plaque reduction neutralization test [ PRNT ] Reporter Virus Particles [ RVP ] antibody detected/increasing ) antibody assessment . A final blood sample immune reactivity test IBS RBC collect 75 day last study transfusion . Study procedures summarize follow : Screening/Recruitment All potentially eligible patient participate institution approach study consent prior RBC transfusion . Patients consent study assign study ID number undergo screening . Screening data collection procedure include : Demographics ( age , sex ) , vital sign , height , weight , indication anticipate transfusion , type schedule surgery ( applicable ) , medical surgical history , transfusion history , physical examination , comorbid condition , concomitant medication , hematology panel ( include complete blood count , blood type , blood chemistry , coagulation panel , DAT test , immune reactivity IBS RBCs , pregnancy test [ applicable ] ) , Blood urine sample also take archived future test viral RNA and/or antibody ZIKV , CHIKV DENV . Positive ZIKV/CHIKV/DENV serology investigate IgG IgM , well confirmation PRNT RVP antibody detect ) . Randomization Blinding Eligible patient enrol study consider randomization . If patient enrol receives RBC transfusion prior randomization , patient longer consider randomization , participation study end . An Interactive Web Response System ( IWRS ) use electronic randomization eligible patient . Randomization 1:1 ratio Test : Control stratify site baseline bleed status [ indication RBC transfusion due active bleeding ( WHO grade 3 4 , Appendix 5 ) anemia without active bleeding ] . Randomized patient receive study RBC transfusion 28 day randomization discontinued/withdrawn study replace . Additional data collect patient . At enrollment , patient 's eligibility status enter electronic data capture system ( EDC ) . If eligible , patient randomize . Only appropriate blood bank staff able access treatment arm assignment . Study RBC unit label indistinguishable Test Control product . Medical staff , others care participate patient , well sponsor ( delegate ) blind treatment assignment . Unblinded delegate monitor production RBC component . Treatment Patients transfused Test Control RBC component 28 day . An RBC transfusion episode define RBC unit transfuse within 4 hour . A confirmed negative immune reaction IBS RBC require prior first study transfusion . Compatibility RBC antigens confirm use site 's SOPs prior transfusion IBS RBCs . In case confirm physiologically active antibody IBS RBC presume documented antibody IBS RBC preclude transfusion IBS RBCs , patient discontinued/withdrawn study support locally source ZIKV-screened RBC component ; available locally , component may import ZIKV non-epidemic region . Study Assessments : Monitoring Follow-up Acute Transfusion Support Period ( First study transfusion Day 28 death ) The acute transfusion support period comprise 28 day day first study transfusion Day 28 , death patient . During period , patient receive many study RBCs deem appropriate treating physician . All AEs , SAEs , TRs unanticipated adverse device effect collect start initiation first study transfusion entire transfusion support period ( 28 day last study transfusion ) . The Investigators assess AE/SAE/TR unanticipated adverse device effect relation transfusion study RBCs . Transfusion reaction classify definition CDC NHSN Hemovigilance Module Surveillance Protocol ( Appendix 1 ) capture eCRF CDC NHSN Biovigilance Component/Hemovigilance Module ( www.cdc.gov/nhsn ) . Most proximate vital sign medical record collect prior follow study transfusion . All concomitant medication take study blood product transfuse record EDC system indication , total daily dose , date drug administration . During acute transfusion support period , patient undergo follow assessment prior transfusion , time 5 day elapse since last study transfusion death : vital sign , AEs , TRs , SAEs unanticipated adverse device effect , comorbid condition , blood sample safety lab ( complete blood count , blood chemistry panel , coagulation panel ) , DAT test , ZIKV/DENV/CHIKV viremia ( blood urine RT-PCR ) DENV/ZIKV/CHIKV serology ( IgM/IgG confirmation PRNT/RVP antibodies detected/increasing ) , immune reactivity IBS RBCs.. Samples may use additional vitro research test require confirm suspect ZIKV , CHIKV DENV transfusion-transmitted pathogen mediate infection . Follow-Up Period ( 5 , 28 75 day last study transfusion ) For purpose Day 5-7 , Day 28 ( ± 7 day ) Day 75 ( ± 15 day ) follow-up visit , Day 1 follow-up period first day last study transfusion Day 5-7 Day 28 After Last Study Transfusion ( ± 7 day ) Five seven ( 5-7 ) 28 ( ± 7 ) day last study transfusion , blood sample collect routine safety lab , assessment ZIKV/DENV/CHIKV viremia ZIKV/DENV/CHIKV serology immune reactivity test IBS RBC ; blood urine sample also collect ZIKV/DENV/CHIKV viremia assessment . All AEs , SAEs , TRs unanticipated adverse device effect review recorded period first study transfusion Day 28 last study transfusion . End Study Visit ( Day 75 ±15 day ) At Day 75 ( ± 15 day ) last study transfusion , blood sample collect immune reactivity test IBS RBC . Stage B Upon review approval FDA , eligible patient provide consent participate site transfuse IBS RBCs accord local practice long need duration study . A confirm negative crossmatch IBS RBC require prior every study transfusion . Compatibility RBC antigens confirm accord site 's SOPs prior transfusion IBS RBCs . In case confirm physiologically active antibody IBS RBC , patient discontinue study support conventional RBCs , locally source ZIKV-screened . Transfusion reaction SAEs occur 28 day post transfusion document . A serum sample antibody specific IBS RBC associate antigen blood sample archival test viral RNA and/or antibody CHIKV , DENV ZIKV take 28 day first study transfusion ( ±7 day ) data available least 1000 participant .</detailed_description>
