	<brief_title>Improving Neurocognitive Deficits Function Schizophrenia With Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>High-frequency , repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation ( rTMS ) dorsolateral prefrontal cortex ( DLPFC ) , dysfunctional brain region implicate cognitive deficit schizophrenia , recently show improve cognition non-Veteran sample schizophrenia . The investigator ' goal confirm efficacy treatment modality remediate cognitive deficit improve functionality Veterans schizophrenia , well gain good understand neural mechanism responsible cognitive deficit remediation . The investigator propose conduct small-scale study generate pilot data support feasibility conduct rTMS Veterans effectiveness rTMS population . In addition , investigator conduct neurophysiologic experiment test whether certain neural maker abnormal brain function improve rTMS .</detailed_description>
