	<detailed_description>This study ground financial incentive intervention well-documented age-related change motivation . The investigator consider motivational shift lens socioemotional selectivity theory ( SST , Carstensen , 2006 ) . According SST , perceive time horizon influence motivation across life span . When time perceive expansive ( typical young adult ) , exploration achievement prioritize , time horizon narrow ( typical old adult ) , emotional meaning satisfaction prioritize . Previous research show socioemotional goal may influence decision healthcare plan effectiveness motivational message increase physical activity ( LÃ¶ckenhoff &amp; Carstensen , 2007 ; Mikels et al. , 2010 ; Notthoff &amp; Carstensen , 2013 ) . Drawing tenet SST , individual may motivate engage physical activity align socioemotional goal . For example , old adult may find physical activity appeal promotes emotional meaning satisfaction ; contrast , young adult may find physical activity appeal promotes exploration achievement . Recent work show spending others ( term `` prosocial spending '' ) great emotional benefit spend oneself ( Anik , Aknin , Norton , Dunn , &amp; Quoidbach , 2013 ; Dunn , Aknin , &amp; Norton , 2008 ) . Extending concept , researcher posit , context financial incentive , earn others may offer old adult emotionally meaningful alternative individual financial incentive , may , turn , good support health behavior change old adult . Because profound link physical activity risk cardiovascular disease stroke , previous research suggest financial incentive effective simple , well-defined , objectively measurable activity , behavioral outcome interest study focus walk measure pedometer step count ( Scott &amp; Schurer , 2008 ) . In addition , SST postulate specifically motivational priority younger relative older adult , investigator recruit adult participant age . The researcher design study test effectiveness prosocial relative individual financial incentive increase walk old young adult . Reasoning SST , investigator hypothesize young adult relatively motivate incentive produce personal benefit ( i.e . individual financial incentive ) , old adult relatively affect incentive emotionally meaningful ( i.e . benefit another person social cause ) . The investigator also predict , give choice incentive , old adult likely choose earn others rather earn , relative young adult . In addition , investigator also test effect prosocial relative individual financial incentive intrinsic motivation physical activity behavioral maintenance ( maintain increase step ) incentives remove . Community-residing adult age 18 older recruit via advertisement Internet bulletin board local newspaper participate study require four visit laboratory three week pedometer wear exchange $ 50 . Importantly , participant unaware incentive component study . Once participant contact research staff indicate interest , phone screen eligibility ( see eligibility criterion section entry ) . During first in-lab session , provide informed consent , participant respond series questionnaire use Qualtrics survey software . Participants provide pedometer , instruct use , ask wear day . One week later , participant return complete second study session . Participants complete questionnaire pedometer step download . Participants randomly assign within age group gender one five possible incentive condition ( find arm intervention section entry ) . One week later , participant return lab third study session complete questionnaire pedometer step download . All participant tell average daily step previous week average relates first week 's average . Participants incentivized condition increase step told much earn . Participants personal condition choice participant elect keep earnings receive check amount earnings . Participants love one charity condition choice participant elect give earnings love one charity witness research staff write check amount earnings select love one charity enclose check along cover letter envelope mail . Participants incentivized condition increase step tell earn money . All participant incentivized condition remind incentive portion study complete earn money change step final week study . One week later , participant complete final study session . Participants complete questionnaire pedometer step download . All participant tell average daily step previous week average relates second week 's average . At end session , participant debrief , pay , thanked participation .</detailed_description>
	<criteria>Adults age 18 older target . We aim recruit equal number men woman , specific target . There racial ethnic target . Individuals pass phone screening include physical ( PARQ ) cognitive ( MMSE ) measure eligible study . These individual must either answer `` '' question Physical Activity Readiness Questionnaire ( PARQ ) receive verbal permission doctor . Additionally , must also show sign cognitive impairment indicate score great equal 23 point 26point MiniMental State Examination ( MMSE ) . We recruit minor ( 17 young ) study adult development . Individuals answer `` yes '' question PARQ and/or receive score less equal 22 MMSE .</criteria>
