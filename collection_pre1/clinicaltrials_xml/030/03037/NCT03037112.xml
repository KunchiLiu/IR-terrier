	<brief_title>Resetting Default : Improving Provider-patient Communication Reduce Antibiotic Misuse</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Significance : Antibiotic overuse misuse contribute development antibiotic resistant infection kill least 23,000 Americans cause additional 2 million infection annually . If leave unchecked , antibiotic resistant infection estimate cause 10 million death worldwide 2050 . Antibiotic associate adverse drug reaction ( e.g. , rash , diarrhea , nausea , vomit ) also result 140,000 Emergency Department visit annually . The majority antibiotic prescribing occur outpatient setting child receive 49 million prescription annually . Over 70 % respiratory infection nearly 8.5 million prescription inappropriate ( i.e. , either unnecessary broad-spectrum antibiotic treat viral illness ) . There many factor lead overprescribing , chief among inadequate parent-provider communication . Innovation : This study first US multi-site randomize controlled trial comparing effectiveness education vs. communication skill provider intervention stimulate high quality parent-provider communication judicious use antibiotic . Approach : 1,600 eligible parent ( caregiver ) child age 1 5 enrol expose one intervention base provider see visit . English Spanish speaking parent recruit Children 's Mercy Hospital Primary Care Clinic ( CMH PCC ) Kansas City , Missouri Heartland Primary Care Clinics Kansas City , KS Lenexa , KS . Parents arm receive identical brief negatively behavioral frame antibiotic education via tablet computer . Providers randomize parent-provider education communication skill intervention arm train accordingly . Primary outcome parental rating share decision-making satisfaction . Secondary outcome rate inappropriate antibiotic prescribing , re-visits adverse drug reaction . Data collect via tablet computer administer RedCap survey administer exam room prior immediately follow child 's visit . Additional data garner medical record ( antibiotic prescribing ) 2-week follow-up telephone call parent ( re-visits adverse drug reaction ) . Public Health Impact : This study could significant public health implication meet goal outline 2014 Executive Order Combating Antibiotic Resistance , seek slow emergence resistant bacteria prevent spread resistant infection judicious appropriate use antibiotic .</detailed_description>
