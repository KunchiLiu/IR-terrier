	<brief_summary>This multi-center , non-randomized , non-interventional study evaluate accuracy remote monitoring analytical platform prediction heart failure exacerbation . The platform acquire continuous multivariate vital sign HF patient use new ambulatory wearable ( attached adhesive ) multi-sensor device analyze data use novel machine learn algorithm .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Link-HF , Phase II : Multisensor Non-invasive Telemonitoring System Prediction Heart Failure Exacerbation</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The analytics investigate include Similarity-Based Modeling technique , empirically estimate expect physiological behavior subject base prior learned dynamic data , comparison actual measure behavior subject , reveal discrepancy hide normal variation . The measurement typically ensemble vital sign effectively characterize physiological `` control system '' subject . This technique multivariate : multiple variable leverage , single variable isolation little context - high heart rate could mean person exert , could mean physiology distress even though exert . With reference several variable , however , respiration rate , oximetry motion/activity , high heart rate might recognize normal state accompany corroborate data show high respiration rate , normal oximetry high level motion - person exercise . A wearable adhesive multi-sensor device use collect continuous vital sign data study subject , include heart rate , respiration rate , bodily motion/activity , skin temperature , pulse , electrocardiogram peripheral capillary oxygen saturation . Subjects provide smartphone cellular tablet pair multi-sensor device receive data upload analytics server via cellular network WiFi internet . Study staff interact subject visit schedule routine heart failure follow-up capture pre-specified heart failure medical event . All standard care clinic hospitalization note procedure report include echocardiogram , right heart catheterization , pulmonary function test , six minute walk test radiology report collect occur .</detailed_description>
