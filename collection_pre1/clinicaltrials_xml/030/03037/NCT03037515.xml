	<brief_summary>The purpose project compare effectiveness two different well accept route administration tranexamic acid order reduce blood loss need transfusion patient undergo lumbar spine surgery . Specifically , study seek identify intravenous tranexamic acid superior oral tranexamic acid reduce blood loss need transfusion .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Oral Intravenous Tranexamic Acid Lumbar Spine Surgery</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Spine surgery associate large amount perioperative blood loss . Factors influence blood loss include surgical technique , operative time , number vertebral level arthrodesed , others . Significant blood loss associate complication hypotension , end organ damage , coagulopathy . Blood transfusion increase risk infection , blood incompatibility , allergic reaction . Due significant risk complication associate blood loss allogenic transfusion , effort identify safe effective way lower blood loss spine surgery crucial . Many method utilized reduce allogenic blood transfusion , autologous blood predonation , antifibrinolytic drug , acute normovolemic hemodilution , intraoperative blood salvage , others . Furthermore , administration antifibrinolytics , tranexamic acid ( TXA ) epsilon-aminocaproic acid ( EACA ) , show reduce bleed cardiac , gynecological , urologic total joint replacement surgery . There many publish study investigate various antifibrinolytic agent TXA , EACA , aprotinin . While aprotinin show increase mortality rate patient follow cardiac surgery , TXA EACA show cause substantial morbidity increase rate thromboembolic event . Although IV TXA show effective reduce blood loss transfusion patient undergo spine surgery , study literature investigate efficacy PO TXA decrease blood loss transfusion . The investigator believe PO TXA efficacious cost-effective reduce blood loss transfusion need patient undergo lumbar spine surgery . The ultimate goal identify cost-effective protocol decrease blood loss need transfusion . If oral TXA find efficacious IV TXA reduce blood loss need transfusion , significant cost saving achieve patient health care system general .</detailed_description>
