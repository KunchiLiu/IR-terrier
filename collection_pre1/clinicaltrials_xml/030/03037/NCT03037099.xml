	<detailed_description>This study propose examine effectiveness enhance GI-targeted nutrition education dietary behaviour intake among adult type 2 diabetes . Adults type 2 diabetes take part study randomly assign either HEALD-GI program ( intervention ) usual care ( control ) . To evaluate effectiveness program , 66 eligible participant draw Alberta 's Caring Diabetes Cohort randomize two equal group use pragmatic randomize controlled trial design . The control receive standard print copy Canada Food Guide Canadian Diabetes Association ( CDA ) GI resource .

These reinforce email , text messaging/phone call , postal mail . GI knowledge skill , self-efficacy , dietary intake ( use 3-day food record ) , anthropometry ( body mass ) , clinical measure ( glycated hemoglobin A1c , systolic blood pressure ) , assess baseline three month post-intervention . The primary outcome change GI relate dietary behaviour intake measure use 3-day food record ( baseline 3 month ) . Secondary outcome include : 1 ) body mass , 2 ) glycemic control ( hemoglobin A1c ) , 3 ) systolic blood pressure . Significance : Sufficient evidence need regard best approach increase uptake current Canadian Diabetes Association ( CDA ) evidence-based recommendation include low GI food daily meal plan effective dietary self-care practice glycemic control among people type 2 diabetes . Findings study help determine , , current approach disseminate CDA dietary recommendation pertain GI concept could improve good uptake use efficient cost effective patient-centered approach nutrition self-management . Besides , evidence generate contribute address controversy regard clinical usefulness GI concept .</detailed_description>
