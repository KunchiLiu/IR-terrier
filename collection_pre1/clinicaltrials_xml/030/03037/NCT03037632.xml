	<brief_title>DCM Precision Medicine Study</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Dilated cardiomyopathy unknown cause ( DCM ) , know clinically idiopathic dilate cardiomypathy , common cardiomyopathy lead cause heart transplantation . DCM affect approximately one million individual , major impact US public health . DCM commonly asymptomatic late course cause heart failure , disability , death . Because clinical course , mean identify patient risk DCM detect DCM asymptomatic phase could provide enormous opportunity intervention extend live prevent late-stage disease . Within paradigm precision medicine DCM could greatly impact health care outcomes cost . Recent advance DCM genetics introduce possibility , unresolved question familial recurrence risk , genetic etiology , racial difference , family-based screening must address move ahead . The central hypothesis study , base publish study investigative group , state DCM substantial genetic basis . For study investigator hypothesize : ( ) 35 % probands European African ancestry ( EA/AA ) classify familial cohort recruit multicenter US consortium give explicit recommendation assistance achieve clinical screening relative ; ( b ) approximately 40 % DCM probands , whether categorize familial non-familial , EA AA , pathogenic likely pathogenic variant gene previously implicate DCM ; ( c ) tailor intervention help DCM probands communicate DCM risk family member improve uptake impact necessary clinical genetic testing . To test hypothesis , investigator propose : ( 1 ) estimate compare frequency EA AA DCM probands classified familial DCM ; ( 2 ) estimate compare proportion probands identifiable genetic cause DCM group define proband classification ( familial/non-familial ) ancestry ( EA/AA ) ; ( 3 ) evaluate impact randomize intervention aid direct family communication participation at-risk family member clinical screen appropriate follow-up surveillance DCM . These aim accomplish recruit cohort 1300 DCM probands ( 600 EA , 600 AA , 100 Hispanic ethnicity ) , perform cardiovascular clinical screening 5200 family member , perform genetic test probands affect family member exome sequencing , return genetic result , randomize probands intervention improve family communication regard DCM risk . Proving hypothesis would transformative field : rather view DCM clinical diagnosis , cardiovascular professional would understand DCM genetic disease manage use genetic diagnostic family-based preventive strategy . These study result would make precision medicine DCM reality .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Meeting criterion dilate cardiomyopathy ( DCM ) : Left ventricular ejection fraction &lt; 50 % Left ventricular enlargement ( A left ventricular enddiastolic dimension &gt; 95 % tile population standard base gender height ) . Detectable cause cardiomyopathy , except genetic , excluded beyond reasonable doubt time DCM diagnosis ( , meet clinical criterion idiopathic DCM ) Any age ( include child ) NonHispanic Hispanic ethnicity All race ( PI preapproval require recruitment beyond prespecified recruitment target ) . Ability give inform consent Ability communicate English ( except Spanish language sit approve recruit individual Hispanic ethnicity ) Willingness participate familybased study ( patient willing work clinical site and/or OSU facilitate recruitment enrollment family member study ) . Coronary artery disease ( CAD ) cause ischemic cardiomyopathy ( &gt; 50 % narrowing , major epicardial coronary artery ) Primary valvular disease Adriamycin cardiotoxic drug exposure Other form cardiomyopathy : Hypertrophic , Restrictive , Arrhythmogenic Right Ventricular Dysplasia/Cardiomyopathy Congenital heart disease Other detectable cause dilate cardiomyopathy , include sarcoid hemochromatosis . Other active multisystem disease may cause DCM ( e.g. , active connective tissue disease ) . Severe untreated untreatable hypertension ( systolic blood pressure routinely great 180 mm Hg and/or diastolic blood pressure great 120 mm Hg , resistant multidrug treatment ) . However , conventional risk factor DCM , include obesity , routinely treated hypertension , alcohol use , pregnancy peripartum period , leave ventricular noncompaction , NOT consider exclusion criterion .</criteria>
