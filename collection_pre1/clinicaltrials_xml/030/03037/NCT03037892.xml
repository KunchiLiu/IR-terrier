	<brief_title>Comparison Remifentanil Sole Agent Combination With Midazolam Versus Fentanyl/Midazolam During Sedation Colonoscopy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>A Prospective Randomized Comparative Study Evaluate Use Remifentanil Sole Agent Combination Midazolam Versus Fentanyl/Midazolam Sedation Colonoscopy . Background : Audits patient experience study quality improvement colonoscopy show increased sedation administration result long-lasting improvement colonoscopy quality indicator . However deep sedation NORA ambulatory setting associate increased sedation associate risk raise cost healthcare provider . Sedation may delay discharge patient cause discharge patient early cognitive impairment contraindicate complex activity daily live , The search still ideal drug produce optimal operate condition minimum postoperative cognitive impairment . Remifentanil ultrashort , potent narcotic , eliminate plasma tissue esterases . There recent interest use Remifentanil endoscopic unit might advantage drug profound analgesic effect , rapid onset offset time rapid titration individual patient 's requirement intermittent pain colonoscopy . There study suggest analgosedation ( intense pain relief without loss consciousness ) achievable remifentanil valid alternative present sedo-analgesia technique use colonoscopic sedation . Ackcaboy ZN conduct prospective randomize trial test hypothesis continuous infusion low dose remifentanil ( 0.05mcg/kg/min ) continuous bolus injection - combination 2 mg midazolam , provide effective analgesia , sedation , amnesia , patient comfort stable recovery profile without respiratory depression compare Propofol infusion colonoscopy . Following Moerman 's hypothesis : `` If pain crucial point , need sedation ? `` , use remifentanil sole agent colonoscopy , investigate compare sedative scheme midazolam plus pethidine . Remifentanil find provide sufficient pain relief well hemodynamic stability , less respiratory depression , significantly faster recovery hospital discharge moderate sedation midazolam pethidine . Midazolam-Fentanyl Midazolam-Remifentanyl technique compare Endoscopic Retrograde Cholangio- Pancreatography another painful endoscopic procedure definite advantage see midazolam-remifentanil group level sedation patient satisfaction . However , remifentanil use widespread use anaesthesiologists . There scope conduct study ascertain actual real benefit use remifentanil sole agent combination midazolam , standard technique midazolam/fentanyl use endoscopy unit . This Controlled Randomized Clinical Study plan evaluate whether Remifentanil sole agent combination Midazolam provide safe effective sedation colonoscopy compare present technique midazolam fentanyl use endoscopists . 1 . Statement problem Colonoscopy proven method bowel cancer screen often experience painful procedure . They frequently perform endoscopic procedure . However motivate patient participate colonoscopy screen continue challenge associate considerable anxiety pain . Additionally patient complain disruption normal activity bowel preparation hangover effect sedation need escort procedure . The sedation protocol follow endoscopists ' nurse monitoring case . Rescue extreme sedation agitation uncommon . Ideal sedation potent easily titrate , adequate safe painful procedure yet quick recovery early discharge procedure usually do ambulatory set . Remifentanyl relatively new drug use endoscopic suit advantage . There scope conduct study ascertain actual real benefit use remifentanil sole agent combination midazolam , standard technique midazolam/fentanyl.. Significance problem Colonoscopy one commonly perform outpatient procedure diagnosis treatment lower gastrointestinal tract disorder , usually perform moderate sedation ambulatory set . As pain vasovagal reaction common procedure , administration sedation analgesia imperative . Techniques sedation must guarantee comfort safety patient , time allow rapid turnover patient . An anaesthetic agent rapid onset offset action , convenient titration anaesthetic/analgesic depth well rapid recovery enable discharge endoscopy unit soon possible would ideal . There recent interest use Remifentanil endoscopic unit might advantage drug profound analgesic effect , rapid onset offset time rapid titration individual patient 's requirement intermittent pain colonoscopy . Remifentanil find provide sufficient pain relief well hemodynamic stability , less respiratory depression , significantly faster recovery hospital discharge moderate sedation preliminary study . Objectives study : General objective : The study plan study whether Remifentanil sole agent combination Midazolam provide safe effective sedation colonoscopy compare present technique midazolam fentanyl use endoscopists . Specific objective : - Whether remifentanyl sole agent effective safe Colonoscopies , combine midazolam offer advantage remifentanyl standard midazolam fentanyl technique . - Effectiveness judge number patient complain pain procedure , number patient become uncooperative technique give Propofol convert general anaesthetic . - Safety judge significant haemodynamic respiratory change change sedation level various study group . - Advantages reduce recovery time note time full recovery sedation procedure . - Patient Endoscopist 's satisfaction score record see difference three group . Method : Following Ethics Committee approval , 90 patient undergoing colonoscopy moderate sedation ambulatory set Awali Hospital include study satisfy inclusion/exclusion criterion . Informed Consent take preoperatively randomly allocate three group follow : Group 1 - Patients receive Midazolam Fentanyl . Group 2 - Patients receive Midazolam Remifentanil Group 3 - Patients receive Remifentanil sole agent Study subject : Inclusion exclusion criterion study subject . Design : Prospective , randomize control clinical trial Sample size : 90 patient select study randomly divide three group 30 . Sampling technique : All patient due colonoscopy moderate sedation satisfy inclusion exclusion criterion agree part study group inform consent randomly divide three group 30 . Randomization do make identical fold slip three group randomly pick slip preoperatively morning procedure patient . Timeframe study . The study do prospectively approve Ethics Committee register Prospective Clinical Trial Registry Data Collection method , instrument use measurement : Describe instrument use data collection ( questionnaire , observation record form , etc . ) Study Protocol : Patients undergo elective colonoscopy satisfy inclusion criterion randomly allocate 3 group take informed consent . All colonoscopy perform two Endoscopists Awali Hospital seem work similar manner colonic endoscopy . On arrival endoscopy room IV access establish . Supplemental oxygen 3 L/min give nostril mouth specially design mask monitor end tidal CO2 level . The basal value noninvasive blood pressure ( NIBP ) , peripheral oxygen saturation ( SpO2 ) , heart rate ( HR ) , respiratory rate ( RR ) end-tidal CO2 level ( ETCO2 ) note . Two minute colonoscopy procedure , bolus midazolam 0.03mg/Kg 1.5microgram/Kg fentanyl give intravenously 60 sec group 1 . 0.5 mg midazolam intravenously give every two minute till patient sufficiently sedate ( sleep arousable call ) . The colonoscopy start end point . Increments 0.5mcg/Kg fentanyl give patient complains pain , repeat every 5 minute persistent pain . The patient group 2 Target control infusion Remifentanil 3.0 ng/ml start 2 minute procedure . The patient give dos midazolam 0.5 mg increment till sedate sufficiently ( sleep arousable verbal command ) . During Colonoscopy dose Remifentanil could increase 0.5ng/ml patient complain pain upto 4.0ng/ml . The group 3 patient receive Remifentanil dose give group 2 . During procedure pain excessive persistent spite increase respective dos prescribe group , cause loss cooperation patient interfere performance procedure , patient give sleep dose Inj Propofol anaesthesia care require provide . The Haemodynamic Parameters ( NIBP , HR ) , RR , SPO2 , Sedation Scare ( Ramsay ) ETCO2 measure 1 3 min drug dose every 5 min till end procedure . After procedure patient shift recovery parameter continue measure every 5 min discharge 30 min stay recovery room . Pain Scoring do Visual Analog Pain Score ( VAS ) ( 0- minimum 100mm- Maximum pain ) passing scope , scope , completion colonoscopy discharge recovery unit . Total amount drug consume , duration colonoscopy , incidence adverse effect ( desaturation &lt; 94 % Pulseoximetry , Hypoventilation ( RR &lt; 8/min apneic episode , hypotension ( SBP &lt; 90mm Hg ) , nausea vomit pruritis record . Patient satisfaction note time discharge ward Primary Outcome Measures : • The Recovery Time The patient consider recover achieve Aldrete score 10 . Aldrete score do every 5 minute complete colonoscopy 30 min till achievement 10/10 Aldrete Score . Aldrete score - Respiration : Able take deep breath cough = 2 , Dyspnea/shallow breathe = 1 , Apnea = 0 - O2 saturation : Maintains &gt; 92 % room air =2 , Needs O2 inhalation maintain O2 saturation &gt; 90 % =1 , O2 saturation &lt; 90 % even supplemental oxygen =0 - Consciousness : Fully awake= 2 , Arousable call = 1 , Not respond = 0 - Circulation : BP +/- 20 mm Hg preop =2 , BP +/- 20-50 mm Hg preop =1 , BP +/- 50 mm Hg preop =0 - Activity : Able move 4 extremity = 2 , Able move 2 extremity = 1 , Able move 0 extremity 0 - Participants Assumed Feel Frequent Pain , colonoscopy . • Patients sound `` Ah '' feeling pain colonoscopy would take measure : patient sound `` Ah '' &gt; 6 time , patient assume feel frequent pain . Will score 0 pain ,1if complain pain 2 say Ah complain pain frequently , , 6 time . - Patient 's Distress Score every 5 min till end colonoscopy . Patients ' distress minimal , mild moderate severe distress . - Number patient group receive propofol due loss cooperation Secondary Outcome Measures : - Endoscopist Satisfaction . Time Frame : 5 min colonoscopy . Endoscopist 's satisfaction colonoscopy visual analogue scale 100 mm - Incidence Patient 's Recall . Tested colonoscopy discharge hospital . The number patient recall instruction explanation give colonoscopy note unpleasantness related recall awareness . - Patient satisfaction . Will test numerical scale 0 ( satisfy ) 10 ( fully satisfy ) time discharge hospital . - Side Effects note group example excessive sedation , nausea , vomit , pruritis , respiratory depression apnoea .
