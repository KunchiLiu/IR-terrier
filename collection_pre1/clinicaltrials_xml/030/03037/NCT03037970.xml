	<brief_title>Evaluation ABSOLVE Diabetic Foot Ulcers</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Patients diabetes risk develop serious health problem may affect foot , eye , kidney , skin heart . Foot ulceration great significance life million diabetic patient , represent one common serious complication patient . Up 25 % diabetic develop diabetic foot ulcer ( DFU ) point lifetime . The prevalence DFUs among diabetic 4 % 10 % . More half foot ulcer become infected require hospitalization 1 5 require amputation . Foot ulcer account 85,000 non-trauma relate low limb amputation annually USA . Every 20 second , somewhere world , limb lose consequence diabetes . Moreover , 85 % leg amputation precede DFUs 60 % non-traumatic low extremity amputation ( LEA ) perform United States year occurs secondary complication diabetes mellitus . After major amputation , 50 % patient another limb amputate within two year . Mortality rate subsequent amputation alarmingly high - 40 % 1 year 80 % 5 year . Patients history DFU 40 % great mortality rate compare patient diabetes alone . Improved treatment DFUs clearly matter great significance . In study , investigation focus safety efficacy ABSOLVE treat diabetic foot ulcer .</detailed_description>
