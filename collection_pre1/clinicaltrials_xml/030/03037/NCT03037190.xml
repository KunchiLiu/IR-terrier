	<brief_summary>The overall aim project investigate whether gluten free diet onset type 1 diabetes ( T1D ) good preserve remain beta cell mass time prevent development Celiac Disease ( CD ) patient . Specific aim • To study whether gluten free diet one year onset diabetes influence appearance duration clinical remission child Type 1 diabetes . New data show gluten free diet beneficial concerning insulin production onset diabetes . The investigator want investigate gluten trigger protein destruction beta cell function onset diabetes compare child normal diet compare child gluten free diet one year onset disease . - To study whether gluten free diet one year onset diabetes prevent development Celiac Disease child impact two disease It know almost 10 time common child Type 1 Diabetes ( IDDM ) develop Celiac Disease ( CD ) general population child ( 6-7 % ) develop CD onset Diabetes within 5 year . Based new data CD preventable extent investigator plan perform randomize controlled study possible prevent postpone CD mean onset IDDM . - To investigate impact gluten free diet regulation autoimmune responses The investigator test hypothesis gluten free diet child recent onset T1D implement immune regulation inhibit activation potentially autoreactive T cell .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>General project outline Our aim perform intervention study whether one year gluten free diet child newly diagnose TID would make possible influence speed beta-cells destruction diet decrease risk develop CD disease A power calculation show would need 600 participant detect clinically relevant effect ( see power calculation ) . As power calculation base estimate effect plan first perform pilot study include 100 patient . Based result pilot study plan continue design large study get robust information . All child also start study , 1 2 year receive KID-screen form study quality life time child diabetes compare child diabetes without CD develop undiagnosed CD . Furthermore child also monitor dietician study period , onset , 1 2 year accord content ( protein , fat , carbohydrate , gluten vitamin ) study . Population Consecutive patient recent onset diabetes Swedish paediatric clinic give information study parent ask participate trial . Informed consent give patient guardians/parents inclusion criterion ; 1 . Type 1 diabetes accord ADA classification &lt; 1 month diabetes duration time screen 2 . Age 3.00 -17.99 year time screen 3 . Fasting C-peptide time screen ≥ 0.12 nmol/L Exclusion Criteria 1 . Inability unwillingness comply provision protocol 2 . Deemed investigator able follow instruction and/or follow study protocol Recruitment Screening Eligible subject parent ( ) / guardian ( ) study explain , receive write patient information . If , , subject agree participate , personally sign date write informed consent form . In accordance Declaration Helsinki , investigator must explain patient right withdraw study time , way prejudice future treatment Sample size , power calculation : We plan study continuous response independent control experimental subject 1 control per experimental subject . In similar study response within subject group normally distribute standard deviation 0,19 . If true difference experimental control mean 0,05 need study 250 subject 250 control able reject null hypothesis population mean experimental control group equal probability ( power ) 0,8 . The Type 1 error probability associate test null hypothesis 0,05 . Recalculation sample size need pilot study , choose 100 subject , 50 group . This field also benefit small shorter trial conduct obtain initial sense efficacy prior undertake fully power study . The risk develop CD child gluten free diet compare 8000 child BDD follow yearly transglutaminse autoantibody CD . Study Design The trial design 2-arm randomized , open , multicentre study compare 1 year gluten free diet normal diet . In pilot study 100 patient recruit 7 site Sweden ( pilot study show expect result include 43 Swedish pediatric clinic altogether estimate 600 patient ) . The patient randomize two parallel group could influence compliance normal diet . Instead recruit group A ( 50 patient ) first year group B 50 age sex-matched patient second year . Group A eat gluten free diet year onset diabetes B normal diet . Both group follow procedure accord study visit clinical routine diabetes care follow . Eligibility : Patients qualify study C-peptide 0.12 nmol/L assign number screen number together clinic , site number , use patient identification . The patient assess eligibility screen visit ( Visit 1 ) prior start treatment glutenfree diet screen MMTT ( mixed meal tolerance test ) fast C-peptide level . The patient follow total study period 60 month include 6 extra visit study ( however visit may combine regular diabetes care visit though child diabetes use attend outpatient clinic least every 3 month often onset disease ) Visit 1 ; 2 month within onset , MMT fast C-peptide Visit 2 ; If eligible , randomize group A ( first 50 ) , contact dietitian , information GFD , within 3 month onset Visit 3 ; 6 month ; fast C-peptide , immunological analysis contact dietician ; questionnaire registry ( visit one week registry diet intake ) Visit 4 ; 12 month ; MMTT fast C-peptide , HbA1c , immunological analysis . HbA1c , immunological analysis research , contact dietician ; questionnaire registry ( visit one week registry diet intake ) Visit 5 ; 18 month , MMTT fast C-peptide , HbA1c , immunological analysis . HbA1c , immunological analysis , include Ttg ( transglutaminse ) Visit 6 ; 24 month , MMTT fast C-peptide , HbA1c , immunological analysis . HbA1c , immunological analysis , include Ttg ( transglutaminse ) yearly 60 month . Questionnaire quality life gluten content . Both group A B information visit accord diabetes care contact dietician mandatory , arm A need special information gluten free diet also x-support accord gluten free product . Both group A B follow accord CD risk 5 year Ttg annually clinical routine . Experimental strategy AIM 1 - To investigate change beta-cell function patient undergo MMTT ( measure C-peptide , 90 minute value AUCmean 0-120 min ) basile baseline ( Visit 1 ) 12 18 month ) . Our research nurse perform test patient include different site sample analyze Clinical Chemistry SUS , Malmö . - We also investigate compare proportion patient stimulate maximum C-peptide level 0.2 nmol/L 12 18 month respectively well fast C-peptide , change baseline month 6 , 12 18 month group . - Differences metabolic control , Hemoglobin A1c ( HbA1c ) , change baseline subsequent visit - Hemoglobin A1c ( HbA1c , marker metabolic control ) ) marker long term hyperglycemia analyze baseline subsequent visit group . We also study difference exogenous insulin dose per kg body weight 24 hour , change baseline subsequent visit indirect marker beta cell insulin secretion . AIM 2 To follow development gluten-induced humoral autoimmunity , IgA anti-tissue-transglutaminase autoantibody ( Ttg ) determine blood sample collect onset , insulin therapy , , yearly five year onset TID . Ttg autoantibodies analyze enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay Aim 3 • To investigate immunoregulatory effect gluten-free diet perform detail analysis magnitude phenotype gliadin- tTG-specific T cell . Quantitative analysis antigen-specific T cell perform use multicolor flow cytometry cytokine secretion Gender ethnicity All data respect gender ethnicity evaluate predictive factor associate : Diabetes autoimmune disease , common boy girl , reason unknown Celiac Disease common girl . Ethical consideration In spite heavy , intensive , expensive treatment many patient TID get life-threatening serious acute late complication . At diagnosis many patient slight residual insulin secretion . As long case much easy keep blood glucose stable , incidence hypoglycaemia decrease well risk keto-acidosis . A trial gluten free diet complicate safe may burden child family involve . Gluten free special product often expensive , product often consider tasty summarize pros con , clear possibility therapeutic benefit great importance risk . Clinical implication Toward individualize treatment : To find predictive factor determine remission period important people develop diabetes . Every month remission increase quality life , increase metabol control thereby postpone late complication . To find triggering factor rate beta-cells destruction unable u design individualized treatment respective individual . Increased remission period decrease risk develop Celiac Disease . Gluten free diet safe administer , well tolerable patient main long-term goal find treatment onset Type 1 diabetes young patient easy safe preserve residual insulin secretion give patient good quality life , less acute complication long run less risk late complication . The identification exogenous factor trigger drive beta-cell destruction offer potential mean intervention aim prevention T1D . Environmental modification likely offer powerful strategy effective prevention T1D , approach target whole population least proportion population carry increase genetic disease susceptibility . Diet cornerstone diabetes treatment individual diabetes must always much aware carbohydrate content food limit arena different beverage make life complicate individual IDDM CD even complicate limit social quality life . If study could prevent individual develop CD would increase life quality extensively .</detailed_description>
