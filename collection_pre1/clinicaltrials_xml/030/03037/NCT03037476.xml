	<detailed_description>This project propose evaluate efficacy Screening Brief Interventions ( SBIs ) reduce college student ' PSM misuse two different route screen intervention across 9 college university span United States . The research consist study design 1 ) conduct focus group refine feedback material ( Study 1 ) ; 2 ) Conduct screen Registrar 's student list implement randomize control trial ( RCT ) web-based PSM intervention site ( Study 2 ) ; 3 ) Conduct screen RCT university counsel center healthcare center utilize in-person web-based PSM intervention compare control . Study 1 consist conduct 5 focus group 8-12 people elicit feedback regard Personalized Feedback Tool make refinement prior carry Study 2 . In Study 2 , student 9 college campus screen past year PSM misuse . Those meeting study criterion invite complete web-based baseline survey randomize either receive web-based personalize feedback intervention ( PFI ) assessment control . Participants complete follow-up assessment 6 12 month post-baseline evaluate intervention efficacy . The investigator hypothesize participant receive PFI reduce PSM misuse assess 6 12 month follow-up . The investigator expect reduction perceive benefit PSM perceive descriptive norm PSM , increase use alternative behavior support academic success , expect change mediate impact PSM use follow-up . Secondary effect intervention alcohol marijuana use also anticipate , reduction expect partially mediate PSM outcome . Finally , PSM motives demographic potential moderator intervention efficacy also explore . Lastly , Study 3 entail conduct screen RCT university counsel center healthcare center . Eligible student randomize one 3 condition : in-person PFI , web-based PFI , control . Both intervention aim reduce perceive benefit PSM , normative perception PSM , increase alternative behavior , thereby reduce PSM substance use ( specifically marijuana alcohol ) . Participants complete follow-up assessment 6 month post-baseline evaluate intervention efficacy . The investigator hypothesize : 1 ) web- in-person PFI efficacious control , 2 ) in-person intervention efficacious web 6 month follow-up , 3 ) reduction perceive benefit norm PSM increase alternative behavior mediate efficacy intervention , reduction alcohol marijuana use . Demographics PSM motif explore moderator overall differential efficacy .</detailed_description>
