	<brief_summary>Neurotrophic keratitis ( NK ) degenerative disease cornea due impairment nasociliary branch ophthalmic nerve . Reduced corneal sensation lead several corneal lesion include spontaneous ulceration , delay wound healing , corneal scarring , neovascularization , thin , perforation infection . An important permanent visual loss frequently associate condition . NK congenital acquire . Its acquired form due traumatic , infectious ( herpes , zoster ) , neoplastic iatrogenic cause . There currently specific medical treatment . Surgical reconstruction technique sensory neurotizations recently describe young patient suffer traumatic , congenital neoplastic NK use supratrochlear nerve sensory donor nerve sural nerve healthy graft . A neurotization involve transfer healthy donor nerve segment tissue reestablish either motor sensory innervation . The aim present study ass outcome novel sensory neurotization technique treatment severe NK adult patient ( Stages 2 3 Mackie classification ) . Corneal neurotizations perform use either ipsilateral supraorbital nerve donor nerve ( direct neurotization ) contralateral supraorbital nerve donor nerve segment lateral antebrachial cutaneous nerve graft . Small-size skin incision ( less 3 centimeter ) make one eyebrow endoscopic device help surgeon localize dissect supraorbital nerve . Donor nerve graft suture neurotrophic cornea . Adult patient unilateral NK due infectious , traumatic iatrogenic cause include .</brief_summary>
