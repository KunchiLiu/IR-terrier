	<brief_summary>Participants randomly allocate either Yakult ingestion control group . For first 20 day , subject consume normal diet ( keep detail food diary throughout ) . On day 21-28 switch high-fat/high-calorie diet . The investigator hypothesise consume high-fat , high-energy diet 7 day alter composition gut microbiota induce metabolic endotoxaemia / systemic inflammation well decrease whole body insulin sensitivity ( show previously ) . In contrast , investigator hypothesise consume Yakult 21 day 7 day throughout high-fat diet maintain favourable gut microbiota prevent metabolic endotoxaemia / systemic inflammation thus maintain insulin action / insulin sensitivity .</brief_summary>
