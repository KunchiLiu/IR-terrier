	<brief_summary>The PI study sorafenib/hydroxychloroquine ( HCQ ) improve efficacy compare sorafenib alone patient progress sorafenib addition HCQ would lead disease stability patient advance hepatocellular cancer ( HCC ) .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Sorafenib Induced Autophagy Using Hydroxychloroquine Hepatocellular Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Phase 2 study two cohort : Cohort 1 : As second-line treatment , add HCQ SOR dose patient tolerate time progression . Cohort 2 : SOR-na√Øve patient receive SOR 400 mg PO twice daily Cycle1 Day1 ( C1D1 ) . On Cycle 1 Day 15 , HCQ 400 mg PO daily start . In clinical practice , dose reduction SOR may require . On C1D15 SOR maybe keep start dose reduce toxicity . On Cycle 2 Day 1 toxicity HCQ SOR assess . Each cycle 28 day . Blood sample collect Cycle 1 Day 1 , Cycle 1 Day 15 Cycle 2 Day 1 ass biomarkers . Disease evaluation every 2 cycle . Dose reduction due adverse event allow sorafenib per standard care and/or HCQ grade 3 adverse event relate study medication . Dose reduction also permit base investigator clinical decision .</detailed_description>

Documented virology status hepatitis , confirm screen HBsAg , antiHBc , and/or antiHCV Life expectancy &gt; 3 month For woman postmenopausal ( 12 month amenorrhea ) surgically sterile ( absence ovary and/or uterus ) : agreement use two adequate method contraception . For men : agreement use barrier method contraception treatment period Hematologic , Biochemical , Organ Function within 7 day prior Cycle 1 Day 1 : Granulocyte count &gt; 1500/mm3 , Platelet count &gt; 75,000/ mm3 , Hemoglobin &gt; 8 g/dL ; Total bilirubin &lt; 2.0 ; Albumin &gt; 2.8g/dl ; AST ( SGOT ) ALT ( SGPT ) &lt; 5 x ULN ; Serum creatinine &lt; 1.5 x ULN Cohort 1 ( sorafenib ) : No previous systemic therapy include sorafenib chemotherapy treatment . Previous TACE local treatment permit . Cohort 2 ( progression sorafenib ) : Patients receive prior sorafenib therapy least 4 week confirmation disease progression CT/MRI . Prior surgery local therapy within 4 week prior Cycle 1 Day 1 , exception palliative radiation therapy bone Patients receive prior therapy HCQ . Patients uncontrolled brain metastasis . Patients brain metastasis must asymptomatic corticosteroid least one week . Due risk disease exacerbation , patient psoriasis ineligible unless disease well control , care specialist disorder agree monitor patient exacerbation . Patients previously document macular degeneration untreated diabetic retinopathy ( stable retinopathy allow ) . Patients may receive investigational agent . History allergic reaction attribute compound similar chemical biologic composition HCQ . Patients require use enzymeinducing antiepileptic medication ( phenytoin , carbamazepine , phenobarbital , primidone oxcarbazepine ) eligible entry study . Uncontrolled intercurrent illness include , limited , ongoing active infection , symptomatic congestive heart failure , unstable angina pectoris , cardiac arrhythmia , psychiatric illness/social situation would limit compliance study requirement QTc &gt; 500 millisecond ( m ) baseline . Gastrointestinal tract disease result inability take oral medication requirement IV alimentation , prior surgical procedure affect absorption , active peptic ulcer disease . Patients NGtube , Jtube , Gtube allow participate . Pregnant woman exclude study sorafenib potential teratogenic abortifacient effect . For reason , woman childbearing potential men must also agree use adequate contraception ( hormonal barrier method birth control ) prior study entry duration study participation . Should woman become pregnant suspect pregnant participating study , inform treat physician immediately . Because unknown potential risk adverse event nurse infant secondary treatment mother sorafenib , breastfeed discontinue . Informed Consent No study specific procedure perform without write sign informed consent document . Patients demonstrate ability understand willingness sign write informed consent document exclude study entry .</criteria>
