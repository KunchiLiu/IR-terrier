	<detailed_description>Intimate partner violence ( IPV ) significant public health problem currently effective treatment . Alcohol use present instance IPV associate increase frequency severity IPV . The investigator believe alcohol may relate increase frequency severity IPV process over-arousal result cortically psychophysiological arouse effect alcohol ascend limb intoxication peak Blood Alcohol Concentration ( BAC ) compound unique behavioral affective pattern violent couple . The first aim proposal determine increase arousal alcohol exposure potentiate evocative partner stimulus great distressed violent ( DV ) partner distressed nonviolent ( DNV ) partner . A second aim determine alcohol induce arousal interferes DV partner ' ability regulate emotion response evocative partner stimulus compare DNV partner . The propose study experimental comparison effect alcohol arousal emotion regulation 35 DV 35 DNV partner . One partner DV couple pseudo-randomly select yoked DNV partner sex comparable relationship satisfaction participant experiment . To test overall hypothesis over-arousal mechanism alcohol associate increase frequency severity IPV , select partner participate counter-balanced placebo session alcohol administration session electroencephalography ( EEG ) , psychophysiology pupillary response measurement arousal collect emotion regulation task . The data analyze use repeat measure ANOVA between-subjects factor . The investigator expect DV partner experience significantly great arousal DNV partner evocative stimuli condition . The investigator also expect DV partner experience great difficulty regulate emotion evocative stimulus DNV partner effect compound alcohol administration condition . Findings study provide firm evidence alcohol associate IPV mechanism over-arousal provide key target intervention prevent future IPV . The data current proposal use test biofeedback adjunct novel behavioral intervention reduce drink increase behavioral flexibility couple history IPV .</detailed_description>
