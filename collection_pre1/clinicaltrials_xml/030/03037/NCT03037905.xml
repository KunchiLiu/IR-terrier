	<detailed_description>Problem : Anxiety prior surgery expect emotion . Research conduct method reduce anxiety prior enter operate room ( OR ) . These study involve form distraction , almost find form distraction prior enter OR decrease physiologic sign patient report anxiety . Very study carry intervention OR . Steris Corporation develop automated surgical suite environmental system , call SignatureSuite™ , control level lighting , image OR monitor , ambient background audio via preset , computerized automation use anesthesia . The research question : What effect SignatureSuite OR environment patient anxiety , patient outcome , OR staff satisfaction ? Study method : The propose study mixed method two arm randomize controlled trial . Randomization occur surgeon level , base SignatureSuite operate room environment ( experimental group ) versus standard Marymount Hospital operate room environment ( control group ) . Data collection : The study take place perioperative department Cleveland Clinic 's Marymount Hospital . Patient anxiety measure surgery use anxiety visual analog scale ( VAS ) . Qualitative patient data gather write comment . Data patient characteristic retrieve retrospectively chart review . Data staff satisfaction gather conclusion patient data collection period via visual analog scale qualitative analysis write comment . The effect SignatureSuite OR turnaround time also determine conclusion patient data collection period . Sample characteristic : The patient sample comprise patient undergo thyroid and/or parathyroid surgery Marymount Hospital . Sample size : 40 subject per group provide adequate power detect large effect size ( 0.80 ) feasible Marymount Hospital within one year .</detailed_description>
