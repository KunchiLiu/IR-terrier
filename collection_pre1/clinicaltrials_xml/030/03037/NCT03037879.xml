	<brief_summary>Multiple study spinal cord injury ( SCI ) population document deficit learn memory ( LM ) process speed ( PS ) adversely impact daily life ability benefit rehabilitation . The investigator previously attribute cognitive deficit demonstrate SCI population low blood pressure ( BP ) cerebral blood flow ( CBF ) currently conduct study determine effect 30-day elevation BP ( use midodrine hydrochloride - alpha agonist ) CBF cognitive performance compare placebo hypotensive individual SCI . In addition , investigator believe cognitive behavior therapy ( CBT ) may improve cognition independent change BP CBF individual SCI . The current randomized clinical trial ( RCT ) examine efficacy 2 treatment protocol show effective improve cognitive performance neurologically impaired population use person SCI demonstrate ( 1 ) LM impairment and/or ( 2 ) PS impairment objective measure cognitive function complete Neuropsychological assessment . Two method outcome assessment use examine treatment impact : ( 1 ) traditional Neuropsychological assessment ( NP ) ( 2 ) assessment global functioning ( AGF ) compose broad outcome measure examine impact treatment everyday life activity . In way , investigator able objectively evaluate presence absence change memory performance NP assessment , also evaluate impact treatment protocol everyday life AGF . While study evaluate efficacy cognitive retrain usually employ pre- post-training evaluation , evaluation criticize lack ecological validity ( i.e. , real world generalizability ) . The present design allow assessment efficacy treatment technique within SCI population use traditional measure , well assessment impact treatment everyday life . The investigator additionally evaluate long-term efficacy include 6-month post-treatment follow-up . Few study examine long-term effect , give time , labor expense involve , critical demonstrate long-term efficacy .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>104 individual SCI recruit eligibility participate study . Participants randomly assign 4 group ( n=26 per group ) story memory technique ( mSMT ) , mSMT control , speed processing training ( SPT ) SPT control . The study involve 14 visit spread 8 month . A screening visit , last approximately 1 hour . 3 testing session last 3-4 hour ( Baseline , Immediate Long-term follow-up ) , 10 intervention session last approximately 45 minute . Screening : Prior enrollment study protocol , potential subject undergo cognitive screening determine eligibility participation . Baseline : After pass screening , subject schedule baseline evaluation comprise cardiovascular/cerebrovascular assessment cognitive evaluation . Intervention : Subjects undergo 10 session train one 4 randomized group . Immediate Follow-up Assessment : Subjects undergo repeat baseline assessment upon completion intervention protocol document change PS , LM , BP CBF follow treatment . Long-Term Follow-up : Subjects ask return laboratory 6 month follow intervention evaluation maintenance treatment effect time . Baseline Immediate follow-up measure PS , LM , BP CBF document .</detailed_description>
