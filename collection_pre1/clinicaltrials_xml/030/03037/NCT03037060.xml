	<brief_title>Exploring Regulation Function Dopamine D3 Receptors Alcohol Use Disorders : A 11C- ( + ) -PHNO Study</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Alcohol dependence devastate illness social medical cost estimate 180 billion dollar annually US . In clinical treatment alcoholism , reduce alcohol consumption heavy drinker major clinical challenge . As , much emphasis clinical preclinical research identify substrates mediate craving , excessive drinking addiction . Identifying neurobiological mechanism alcohol dependence may lead development new well treatment strategy . Preclinical study indicate D3 receptor involve alcohol-cue response motivation drink alcohol . However , currently data available human subject explore relationship D3 behavioral response subject alcohol use disorder . Aim # 1 : To measure [ 11C ] - ( + ) -PHNO PET binding level brain subject alcohol use disorder . Aim # 2 : To determine relationship D3 receptor bind alcohol cue induce crave motivation self-administer alcohol laboratory . To achieve designate goal , investigator recruit 25 male female subject non-treatment seeker . After period abstinence alcohol , participant come Centre Addiction Mental Health [ 11C ] - ( + ) -PHNO PET scan . Participants also additional session alcohol-related measure assess ( i.e . alcohol cue induce crave motivation self-administer alcohol laboratory ) .</detailed_description>
