	<brief_title>Quality Diagnostic Utility Mydriatic Fundus Plenoptic Photography</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Visualization ocular fundus consider essential part physical examination , abnormality optic nerve , retinal vessel , macula reveal underlie systemic disease explain etiology visual complaint . The Fundus Photography versus Ophthalmoscopy Trials Outcomes Emergency Department ( FOTO-ED ) Study demonstrate 14 % patient complaint condition fundus examination consider important direct ophthalmoscopy perform ED physician .Greater 80 % previously unknown fundus finding relevant ED patient management miss ED physician , identify nonmydriatic digital fundus photography . Several case result recall discharge patient back ED hospital admission diagnostic fundus photo review . In search alternative improve ease use fundus image quality , plenoptic technology provide promising option portable fundus imaging . Plenoptic , light field , image recently introduce commercially release Lytro Plenoptic Camera ( Mountain View , CA , USA ) . Utilizing array microlenses , Lytro camera capture available light scene multiple vector . By divide scene whole many individual microlenses , image refocus post processing acquisition , sharp focus attain low light situation , stereo image perspective shift attain . To date publish quantitative description quality reliability plenoptic ophthalmoscopy use commercially available , portable light field camera . Initial work pilot study use animal human eye publish 2016 . The purpose propose prospective , cross sectional imaging study compare standard mydriatic fundus photography second generation camera develop Lytro plenoptic camera customize light source , specifically analyze diagnostic utility/sensitivity detect retinal pathology overall image quality . If image quality outcomes investigator propose study similar nonmydriatic fundus camera , implication physicians potential application ophthalmology relate telemedicine significant .</detailed_description>
