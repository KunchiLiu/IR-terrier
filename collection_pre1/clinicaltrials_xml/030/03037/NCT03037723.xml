	<brief_summary>Radiation therapy breast remain standard practice breast conserve therapy . Because location heart lungs patient position face-up , whole breast radiation therapy report increase risk damage heart year treatment least 20 year exposure , may affect cardiovascular mortality . Also , patient receive whole breast radiation therapy increase risk development secondary lung malignancy . Recent study demonstrate significant reduction dose heart lung treat face-down position . Similarly , correct movement breathing ( respiratory gating ) face-up position also become available option reduce unwanted dose heart lung , particularly leave side breast cancer . No study date compare new organ-sparing technique head-to-head early stage breast cancer . It institutional policy perform CT simulation left-sided breast cancer patient without respiratory gating ( one CT scan ) , face-up position . It also standard care perform face-down CT simulation large breast woman . Both simulation mean reduce exposure heart lung radiation . In study , left-sided breast cancer patient consent receive face-up CT simulation without gate AND face-down CT simulation , regardless breast size ; thus , patient control . The treat physician determine two simulation , , offer good protection patient ' heart lung . Two dosimetrists require independently verify planned dosimetry treatment setup . Treatment plan standard fashion use best two plan .</brief_summary>
