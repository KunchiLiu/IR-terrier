	<brief_summary>Rationale : Osteoarthritis ( OA ) knee common cause pain disability , especially people age 65 . In current health care system conservative ( e.g . intra-articular injection corticosteroid ) surgical ( total knee replacement , TKR ) treatment apply . Although frequently use , certain effect treatment protein metabolism remain unclear . It well known maintenance different tissue determine dynamic balance protein synthesis breakdown rate , temporary change either protein synthesis breakdown allow net protein accretion loss . However , intra-articular injection corticosteroid conservative treatment think several negative consequence thereby potentially affect protein metabolism different musculoskeletal tissue . In addition , though protein supplementation show effective nutritional strategy stimulate muscle protein synthesis , remain unclear extent musculoskeletal tissue able respond dietary protein supplementation . Therefore , current study ass impact intra-articular corticosteroid injection preoperative protein supplementation protein synthesis different musculoskeletal tissue knee . Objective : To investigate effect preoperative protein supplementation corticosteroid injection Hoffa 's fat pad , synovium , tendon , bone , muscle , ligament , meniscus , cartilage protein synthesis OA knee . Study design : Randomized , parallel ( three group ) study design . Each two intervention group compare control group separately . Study population : 36 adult ( 45-75 ) OA knee undergo TKR . Intervention : Intra-articular injection betamethasone ( 2ml ; 4mg/ml ) bupivacaine ( 8ml ; 5mg/ml ) daily 40 g pre-sleep protein two week TKR , intervention . Main study parameters/endpoints : Primary study parameter include protein synthesis rate enrichments Hoffa 's fat pad , synovium , tendon , bone , muscle , ligament , meniscus , cartilage . Secondary parameter include whole-body protein synthesis , breakdown , oxidation , net balance . Nature extent burden risk associate participation , benefit group relatedness : The risk involve participate study minimal . There potential effect know ingestion protein . The corticosteroid injection standard care conservative treatment osteoarthritis . Risks small limit knee , cartilage degeneration joint destruction . Muscle biopsy tissue collection perform surgical procedure .</brief_summary>
