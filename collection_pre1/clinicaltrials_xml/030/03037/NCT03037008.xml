	<brief_title>Perineal Ultrasound Men Before After Radical Prostatectomy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>After radical prostatectomy , part patient suffer urinary incontinence . Until , information exist functional anatomy male pelvic floor , especially incontinent men . Transperineal ultrasound non-hazardous , cheap easy available method visualize pelvic floor well establish gynecological examination . literature describe technique transperineal ultrasound well establish reference line measure number examine men series small . The investigator want confirm publish data probably find new reference lines/parameters , e.g . distance posterior wall symphysis posterior wall urethra direct , horizontal line . At moment , author publish data urethral mobility , bladder neck open urethral angle . The investigator estimate also possible significant difference distance urethra symphysis incontinent men compare continent men radical prostatectomy . Incontinent men treat pelvic floor exercise , case persist incontinence , operative treatment . There exist several technique implant sling mesh , similar well know TVT ( tension free vaginal tape ) female urinary incontinence , besides gold standard - implantation artificial sphincter prosthesis . The sling-operations less invasive , cheap preferred patient du fact , normal micturition still possible . Nevertheless , around 20 % patient stay incontinent sling operation . At moment , unknown profit sling . In previous study functional pelvic cine-MRI patient post-prostatectomy incontinence implantation bulbourethral composite Suspension compare . The investigator could find significant difference membranous urethral length could show elevation oft bladder neck postoperatively significant MRI difference find patient show clinical success failure . With perineal sonography , investigator want establish prediction tool sling-operations patient urinary stress incontinence radical prostatectomy . The purpose study evaluate whether perineal ultrasound men adequate possibility evaluate pelvic floor function regard urinary incontinence . The study try find prediction tool bulbourethral composite suspension ( sling-operation ) use transperineal sonography . The investigator want establish confirm parameters/standards measure male pelvic floor new technique perineal sonography men . Further investigator want compare finding perineal sonography data functional MRI men urinary incontinence follow radical prostatectomy bulbourethral composite suspension . Findings perineal sonography result questionnaires concern quality life compare . There comparison study two arm compare anatomy function pelvic floor perineal ultrasound men prior RALP due prostate cancer , without prior history disease involve pelvic floor . Participants ask participate study routine consultation department Kantonsspital Winterthur select database clinical information system search radical prostatectomy past recruit participant telephone . In modified lithotomy position ( supine position elevate leg ) , probands get examination pelvic floor use common ultrasound probe head perineum . During examination , bladder fill around 300ml . If patient appear empty bladder , examination repeat date . During examination , pelvic floor observe rest , cough valsalva-maneuver . One examination take around 30minutes . During ultrasound , investigator want illustrate urethral mobility , bladder neck open urethral angle well distance urethra symphysis . Urinary incontinence measure 24h pad test : Probands collect pad , scale use 24 hour , measure difference . The difference ( after-before ) show amount lose urine . The result n't exact result precision approximately 50ml ( = 50g ) acceptable . Results urinary analysis ( culture ) take medical history hospital database period incontinence exclude urinary tract infection . If data available , urinary analysis collect .</detailed_description>
