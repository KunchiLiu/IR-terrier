In addition , main limitation US breast screening represent false- positive finding . These finding result additional investigation unnecessary surgical biopsy . The study aim demonstrate least statistical equivalence , non-significant difference TS US woman dense breast . If equivalence TS US demonstrate , US may substitute TS great benefit patient healthcare resource aim : 1 . Assess TS may detect additional cancer dense breast approximate US detection capability less false positive finding US . 2 . If TS detect new cancer dense breast similarly US ( approximate rate marginally low rate ) , evaluate true positive/false positive ratio . 3 . Cost-analysis . In case le false positive detect TS , TP/ FP trade-off might strongly favour TS great potential cost reduction .</detailed_description>
