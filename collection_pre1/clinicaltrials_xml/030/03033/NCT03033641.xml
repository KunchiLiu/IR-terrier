	<criteria>Subjects must meet follow inclusion criterion : 1 . Age &gt; 18 year . 2 . Patients sign Patient Informed Consent Form ( ICF ) 3 . Scheduled undergo clinicallyindicated catheter ablation procedure treatment persistent atrial fibrillation ( define continuous atrial fibrillation sustain beyond seven consecutive day ) . 3.1 . Drugrefractory atrial fibrillation . ( fail 1 class I III antiarrhythmic drug ) demonstrate Persistent AF ( require drug electrical shock terminate ) 4 . Able willing comply pre , post , followup testing requirement ( e.g . patient confined court ruling ) Subject meet follow exclusion criterion eligible enrollment . 1 . Paroxysmal Atrial Fibrillation 2 . Continuous AF &gt; 12 month ( 1 Year ) ( Longstanding Persistent AF ) 2.1 . Subjects previously diagnose Long Standing Persistent ( LSP ) demonstrate ability maintain Normal Sinus Rhythm &gt; 30 day cardioversion AF great 1 year time procedure remain eligible inclusion . 3 . Previous ablation procedure AF ( previous ablation treatment Flutter acceptable ) 4 . Patients leave atrial size &gt; 55 mm ( echocardiography , parasternal long axis view ) . 5 . Inability restore sinus rhythm 30 second longer opinion investigator . 6 . Significant congenital anomaly medical problem opinion investigator would preclude enrollment study . 7 . Atrial arrhythmia patient structural atrial disease prior history atriotomy prior atrial surgery , presence atrial septal defect , and/or presence atrial septal closure patch . 8 . History current blood clot bleed abnormality , contraindication systemic anticoagulation ( i.e. , heparin , warfarin , dabigatran , direct thrombin inhibitor ) , significant pulmonary disease , unstable angina , uncontrolled heart failure , acute illness systemic infection , disease malfunction would preclude treatment opinion investigator . 9 . Enrollment study evaluate another device drug . 10 . A complex arrhythmia secondary electrolyte imbalance , thyroid disease , reversible noncardiac cause . 11 . Patients prosthetic mitral valve mechanical valve 12 . Any cardiac surgery within past 60 day ( 2 month ) ( include PCI ) ( bypass within past year ) 13 . Subjects ever undergo valvular cardiac surgical procedure ( ie , ventriculotomy , atriotomy , valve repair replacement presence prosthetic valve ) 14 . Prior ICD pacemaker implant 15 . Presence intramural thrombus , tumor abnormality precludes catheter introduction manipulation . 16 . Presence condition precludes vascular access . 17 . Subject contraindication device use study per IFU 18 . Women child bear potential pregnant , lactate , plan become pregnant course trial .</criteria>
