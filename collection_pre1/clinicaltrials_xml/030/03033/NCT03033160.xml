	<brief_title>Vaginal Estrogen Asymptomatic Microscopic Hematuria</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This multi-center , randomize control trial evaluate whether vaginal estrogen effective treatment asymptomatic microscopic hematuria . Postmenopausal woman asymptomatic microscopic hematuria recruit two urogynecology clinic serve clinic site Mount Auburn Hospital/Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center Female Pelvic Medicine Reconstructive Surgery fellowship . Participants eligible postmenopausal , define amenorrhea least one year bilateral oophorectomy least one year prior , three red blood cell per high power field visible properly collect urine specimen without evidence infection . In addition , participant must negative cystoscopy compute tomography urogram ( magnetic resonance urography history renal insufficiency contrast allergy ) within past three year . Exclusion criterion include follow : current past thromboembolic disorder cerebrovascular accident , intolerance previous estrogen replacement therapy hormone replacement therapy , estrogen dependent neoplasm within past five year ( unless support documentation patient 's oncologist obtain ) , estrogen replacement therapy hormone replacement therapy within past three month selective estrogen receptor modulators within eight week enrollment , urinary tract infection , urinary calculus , urinary tract malignancy , vaginal bleed unknown origin , urethral caruncle , history recurrent urinary tract infection last one year , stage two great pelvic organ prolapse . Participants randomize either estradiol-releasing vaginal ring ( Estring ; Pfizer , New York , NY ) expectant management ratio 1:1 use computer-generated block randomization stratify enrollment site . Estring silicone vaginal ring , 5.5 cm diameter , contain 2 mg 17-estradiol , release rate 7.5 g daily . The Estring chosen vehicle vaginal estrogen secondary ease administration , high patient preference , acceptability , compliance . After eligibility confirm write , informed consent obtain , participant randomize one two study arm . Participants randomize use vaginal estrogen vaginal ring place one investigator . Participants study arm complete short form Urogenital Distress Inventory ( UDI-6 ) Incontinence Impact Questionnaire ( IIQ-7 ) . Participants vaginal estrogen arm call two , four eight week ensure Estring still place follow-up appointment schedule need question whether ring still place . At 12-week visit participant provide urine sample urinalysis ass whether microscopic hematuria present . All participant also ask complete UDI-6 IIQ-7 vaginal mucosal atrophy assess describe . Women vaginal estrogen arm Estring remove new Estring place one investigator ; participant also ask ring remove fell past 12 week . All participant ask whether follow , ( could side effect vaginal estrogen use ) occur previous 12 week : dyspareunia subject partner , vaginal bleeding , non-physiologic discharge , vaginal ulceration vaginal irritation . participant follow 24 week determine 12 week need resolution . At 24-week visit , participant provide urine sample urinalysis ass whether microscopic hematuria present . All participant also ask complete UDI-6 IIQ-7 vaginal mucosal atrophy assess describe . We ask participant whether follow , could side effect vaginal estrogen use , occur previous 12 week : dyspareunia subject partner , vaginal bleeding , non-physiologic discharge , vaginal ulceration vaginal irritation . One investigator remove Estring woman vaginal estrogen arm . At 24 week visit investigator offer woman expectant management arm persistent microscopic hematuria opportunity try Estring .</detailed_description>
