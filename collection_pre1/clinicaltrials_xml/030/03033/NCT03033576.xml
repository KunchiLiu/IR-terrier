	<brief_title>Ipilimumab With Without Nivolumab Treating Patients With Melanoma That Stage IV Stage III Can Be Removed Surgery</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To compare progression free survival ( PFS ) patient advance melanoma refractory anti-PD-1 anti-PD-L1 agent , treat combination therapy ipilimumab plus nivolumab versus ipilimumab alone . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . To estimate difference T-cell infiltrate on-study biopsy sample patient respond combination therapy ( include confirm unconfirmed , complete partial response per Response Evaluation Criteria Solid Tumors [ RECIST ] 1.1 ) compare respond . II . To evaluate objective response rate ( ORR ) , define confirmed complete partial response per RECIST 1.1 , treatment arm . III . To evaluate overall survival ( OS ) patient treatment arm . IV . To evaluate toxicity profile patient treatment arm . TERTIARY OBJECTIVES : I . To assess marginal prognostic value baseline T-cell density , T-cell receptor ( TCR ) clonality , mutational load term response . II . To assess joint prognostic value T-cell density , TCR clonality , mutational load term response . III . To identify T-cell poor subtype ( ) associate response . OUTLINE : Patients randomize 1 2 arm . ARM I : Patients receive ipilimumab intravenously ( IV ) 90 minute day 1 . Treatment repeat every 21 day 4 course absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . ARM II : Patients receive nivolumab IV 60 minute ipilimumab IV 90 minute day 1 . Treatment repeat every 21 day 4 course absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . Patients receive nivolumab IV 60 minute day 1 15 . Courses repeat every 28 day absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . After completion study treatment , patient follow every 6 month 2 year annually 1 year .</detailed_description>
