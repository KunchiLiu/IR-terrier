	<brief_summary>The specific aim study : Primary : To determine presence regional distribution microglial activation , assess [ F-18 ] PBR06 PET , subject MSA compare healthy control , baseline 9 month follow-up . Secondary : To assess relationship microglial activation clinical progression baseline follow-up . Hypothesis : Our work hypothesis microglial activation Multiple System Atrophy presence regional distribution microglial activation different MSA versus healthy control correlate disease severity comorbidities .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Four subject probable MSA-C diagnosis recruit study . A probable MSA-C diagnosis base follow criterion : - Autonomic failure involve urinary incontinence ( inability control release urine form bladder , erectile dysfunction male ) orthostatic decrease blood pressure within 3 min stand least 30 mmHg systolic 15 mm Hg diastolic - Poorly levodopa-responsive Parkinsonism ( bradykinesia rigidity , tremor , postural instability ) - A cerebellar syndrome ( gait ataxia cerebellar dysarthria , limb ataxia , cerebellar oculomotor dysfunction ) Summary : Subjects recruit routine clinical appointment physician one co-investigators list protocol Movement Disorders Clinic , 60 Fenwood Road , Boston , MA . Once subject give informed consent , administer standardized questionnaire assessment disease severity , comorbidities and/or presence symptom , applicable give cohort . In addition , blood sample drawn genotype test identify high affinity , medium affinity low affinity binder . Any subject identify low affinity binder exclude study . Subjects undergo two PET scan [ F-18 ] PBR06 BWH PET scan facility 75 Francis Street , Boston , MA . For PET scanning , intravenous ( IV ) catheter insert injection tracer . In addition , prior tracer injection , second IV catheter insert arm hand vein contralateral side blood sampling . To increase usefulness blood sample radiotracer analysis , hand arm use blood sample wrap electrical warmer thermostat set 44Â°C approximately 5-10 minutes.The whole PET session last approximately 120 min . At time imaging , subject position gantry PET camera . A head support use minimize head motion . Side Effects Monitoring : No side effect radiopharmaceutical expect . The dose radiopharmaceutical administer study would expect effect , include physical dependence addiction . There follow phone call within 24-72 hour PET scan , 2 week PET scan ensure subject suffered side effect . Subjects expose small amount radiation . The radiotracer prepare way ensure sterile pyrogen free , radiochemical purity ( RCP ) determine use Silica Gel-Instant Thin Layer Chromatography and/or high pressure liquid chromatography ( HPLC ) . In addition , [ F-18 ] PBR06 non-FDA approve radioligand , 's use study review Radioactive Drugs Research Committee . Subject Safety : Subject monitoring PET scan perform use 2-way intercom system scanner operator subject visual monitoring subject window scan room ( subject visible operator time ) . Subjects need lie still PET camera period 120 min , subject may find uncomfortable remain still time . Therefore , mention , subject give opportunity take break 20 minute 70 minute PET scan , follow last 30 minute scan complete . A standard head-support device use make subject comfortable scan . If subject find intravenous catheter duration scan uncomfortable , free withdraw study time . Recruitment Procedures : Physicians Movement Disorders clinic may present study subject regular schedule clinic visit . If subject interested study , copy consent form give . Established Movement Disorders clinic patient may send recruitment letter describe study copy consent document . Interested subject direct contact research staff via telephone number provide letter participation study . At time subject 's initial screen visit , license physician investigator answer question subject may regard study subsequently obtain informed consent . In accordance NIH guideline , effort make attain mix study participant , term gender racial/ethnic representation . Consent Procedures : Informed consent obtain subject licensed physician investigator study protocol . Existing Movement Disorders clinic subject may send letter describe study copy consent document . Patients clinic may introduce study flier post throughout clinic . For PI 's patient , recruitment letter send several week inquire interest study and/or clinic nurse colleague list IRB introduce study use IRB-approved flier order avoid potential coercion . Interested subject direct contact research staff via telephone number provide letter flier invite participation study set screen visit . They opportunity discuss study research study staff prior give consent outline . Subjects approach participation study routine clinical visit opportunity participate study time may choose return participation another time future . All subject inform free withdraw consent study time without affect quality type care receive BWH . Subjects inform may qualify study genetic analysis reveals low affinity binder TSPO . Monitoring Quality Assurance : During study period , subject follow clinical neurologist adverse event disease progression . If problem report physician , receive care normally perform . In addition , PI review laboratory result test undergone subject study period help co-ordinate necessary care patient 's primary provider .</detailed_description>
