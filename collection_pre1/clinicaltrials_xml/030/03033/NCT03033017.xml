	<brief_title>Predictors Time Viremia With Analytic Treatment Interruption</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The HIV field make dramatic shift emphasis find cure HIV . However , agree upon test cure , even definition cure might . The investigator believe reliable test cure analytic treatment interruption ( ATI ) time viremia standard measure impact intervention degree reservoir deplete . This rational modeling study utilize ATI data point reservoir size important predictor time viremia ( 1 ) study show level HIV DNA ( 2 ) cell associate HIV RNA ( 3 ) prior start antiretroviral therapy ( ART ) associate time-to-rebound . However , study use limited sampling strategy determine viremia rebound likely great sensitivity measure time-to rebound need accurately assess impact intervention . The investigator test ATI strategy plasma HIV sample three time week ART resume virus becomes detectable . In small , pilot study , investigator sample lymph node , GALT , plasma , PBMC , , ATI find time-to-rebound 14 day ( range 5 30 day ) total year ART exposure associate time-to-rebound ( 4 ) . The investigator propose similar study include intensive blood lymphoid tissue sample identify factor predict time to-rebound provide necessary foundation future study utilize treatment interruption test efficacy curative intervention .</detailed_description>
