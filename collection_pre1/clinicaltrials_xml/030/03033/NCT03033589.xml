	<brief_summary>All patient age 16 undergoing primary revision anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction use bone-patellar-bone autograft eligible study . Patients randomize pre-operatively receive either adductor canal nerve block ( single injection ) femoral nerve block ( single injection ) . Post-operatively , primary outcome measure pain level use visual analog scale well narcotic non-narcotic analgesic requirement measure .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Femoral Nerve Block Versus Adductor Canal Nerve Block Peri-Operative Analgesia Following Anterior Cruciate Ligament ( ACL ) Reconstruction : Evaluation Post-operative Pain Strength</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Currently , good track record , femoral nerve block modality choice post-operative pain control follow elective anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction institution . It proven literature provide good post-operative pain analgesia follow procedure ( 1 ) . However , femoral nerve block without concern , include concern long-term quadriceps weakness ( 2 ) . Benefits decrease use Femoral Nerve Block include decrease incidence side effect and/or complication , use quadriceps immediate rehabilitation . Benefits Adductor canal nerve block include possible equivalent pain control avoidance motor de-innervation deleterious adverse effect quadriceps weakness postoperatively . Adductor canal nerve block proven effective orthopaedic procedure involve knee include total knee arthroplasty ( 3 ) . This result study give information well control pain post-op period minimize deleterious side effect patient undergoing ACLreconstruction . All patient age 16 undergoing primary revision anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction use bone-patellar-bone autograft eligible study . Patients randomize pre-operatively receive either adductor canal nerve block ( single injection ) femoral nerve block ( single injection ) . A single dose 30 mL 0.25 % marcaine inject femoral nerve block 20 mL 0.25 % marcaine Adductor Canal nerve block . These procedure perform attend anesthesiologist prior surgery . After surgery patient record pain level use visual analog scale ( VAS ) score daily diary first 5 post-operative day . They also record medication requirement , narcotic non-narcotic analgesic medication . The patient test ability perform straight leg raise post-anesthesia care unit ( PACU ) first post-operative visit .</detailed_description>
