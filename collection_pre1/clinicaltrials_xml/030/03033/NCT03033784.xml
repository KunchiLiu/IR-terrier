	<brief_summary>The main goal study look effect intranasal oxytocin brain Autism Spectrum Disorder ( ASD ) . Oxytocin hormone exist naturally body brain . It affect wide range social behavior emotion . Investigators also seek study effect oxytocin treatment affected genetic , immune environmental factor .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>This study consist investigate effect several dos acute administration intranasal oxytocin brain activity adult Autism Spectrum Disorder ( ASD ) . There increase evidence role intranasal oxytocin ( IN-OT ) enhance social skill ASD . Nevertheless , still need determine target engagement oxytocin 's action brain behavior . Here , investigator study effect different dos IN-OT modulation behavioral outcomes neural response double blind crossover study individual ASD . The aim research 1 . Study effect IN-OT dos modulation brain functional connectivity key socio-emotional brain region rest state ASD 2 . Study effect IN-OT dos BOLD activity key emotional perceptual brain network response social cue ( face ) 3 . Study effect IN-OT BOLD activity brain region interactive social environment ( ball game ) ASD 4 . Study effect IN-OT brain activity ASD subject play neuroeconomic game ( prisoner dilemma game ) Investigators compare neuroimaging behavioral result individual ASD control healthy male receive intranasal placebo . Investigators also investigate role genetic factor , behavioral clinical sub-groups ASD , immune environmental factor modulate effect IN-OT brain behavior . Participants undergo 4 clinical visit receive various randomly assign dos intranasal oxytocin placebo . Both participant experimenter blind type treatment administer . There one visit healthy control receive placebo spray . The visit healthy control conduct single-blind design . The experimenter aware subject receiving placebo . However , participant tell might receive oxytocin placebo .</detailed_description>
