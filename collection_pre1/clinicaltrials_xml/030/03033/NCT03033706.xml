	<detailed_description>Neurosurgical operation characterize major fluid shift , frequent use diuretic , prolong operative time . The role fluid therapy patient critical , hypovolemia might lead brain hypoperfusion over-transfusion might lead increase intracranial tension . All factor make fluid management procedure complex challenge . Evidence optimum protocol intraoperative fluid management neurosurgical patient still lack . Goal-directed therapy ( GDT ) operating room term use describe use cardiac output similar parameter guide intravenous fluid inotropic therapy . Although GDT well report many procedure , benefit neurosurgical operation well study . Pulse pressure variation ( PPV ) famous dynamic method fluid responsiveness . PPV simply calculate divide large pulse pressure ( PPmax - PPmin ) average pulse pressure ( PPmax + PPmin /2 ) express percentage . PPV previously use GDT major abdominal surgery good performance . The aim study compare restrict fluid approach ( 1 ml/Kg/hr ) guide PPV standard fluid management ( 4ml/Kg/hr ) patient undergo supratentorial mass excision . The investigator hypothesize procedure GDT might improve brain relaxation , patient hemodynamics intra postoperatively .</detailed_description>
