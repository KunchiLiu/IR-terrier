	<brief_title>Study Y90-Radioembolization With Nivolumab Asians With Hepatocellular Carcinoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The hypothesis liver-localized radioembolization stimulate tumour and/or HBV specific T cell response associate favourable patient outcomes boost use nivolumab anti-PD1 checkpoint blockade immunotherapy . Primary objective To evaluate response rate Y90 radioembolization combination nivolumab HCC Secondary objectives 1 . To evaluate time response , response duration , time treatment progression sit progression RE combine nivolumab 2 . To assess progression free survival overall survival RE combine nivolumab 3 . To assess quality life use FACT-HEP score EORTC QLQ-C30 4 . To assess safety tolerability combination RE nivolumab Exploratory objectives 1 . To evaluate relationship tumor biopsy PD-L1 expression response treatment Y90 radioembolization combination nivolumab 2 . To assess relationship blood lymphocyte ( e.g. , T cell ) activation phenotypic profile response treatment Y90 radioembolization combination nivolumab , use mass cytometry fluorescence flow cytometry . 3 . To assess relationship HCC tumour mutational burden response treatment Y90 radioembolization combination nivolumab use whole-exome sequence tumour biopsy sample 4 . Where possible , evaluate antigen-specific T cell response know HBV , HCC tumour ( include candidate mutation-derived tumour neo-antigens ) unrelated antigen ( e.g . CMV , EBV , Influenza ) blood assess kinetic change response associated response treatment Y90 radioembolization combination nivolumab use mass cytometry fluorescence flow cytometry . Administration study drug The first dose nivolumab administer 21 day ( +/- 3 day ) completion RE . [ The dose Yttrium-90 determine per institution norm Nuclear Medicine physician , base factor subject 's Body Surface Area ( BSA ) , size tumour within liver , dose modification require percent lung shunt 10 - 20 % Tc-99MMA scan ] . The dose give intravenous 240mg absolute 30 minute . Subsequent dos nivolumab administer outpatient set NCCS . After first dose , intravenous nivolumab 240mg give every 2 week . A US CT guide liver biopsy conduct interventional radiologist C1D8 Subjects assess follow EVERY visit : physical examination , ECOG status , vital sign , Child-Pugh score ALBI score CT MRI scan assess response treatment do cycle 4 , 8 , 12 every 12 week thereafter ( ±7 day ) . FACT-HEP EORTC QLQ C30 version 3.0 questionnaire cycle 4 8 . Follow-Up Visit do 2-3 month last dose . Survival update obtain phone every 3-4 month follow-up visit new anti-cancer treatment give subject record .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>1 . Patients hepatocellular carcinoma ( HCC ) suitable resection liver transplant , plan Y90 radioembolization per institutional practice . 2 . Patients must measurable disease target lesion liver , define least one lesion accurately measure least one dimension ( long diameter record ) &gt; 20 mm conventional technique &gt; 10 mm spiral CT scan . 3 . Diagnosis HCC confirm histology/cytology clinically AASLD criterion cirrhotic subject . Patients without cirrhosis require histological confirmation diagnosis 4 . No prior Y90 radioembolization therapy . Prior local therapy , surgery , hepatic artery embolization/chemoembolization , radiofrequency ablation , percutaneous ethanol injection cryoabalastion allow , index lesion ( ) remain outside treatment field progress since prior treatment . Local therapy must complete least 4 week prior baseline scan 5 . Age ≥ 21 year . 6 . ECOG performance status ≤ 2 7 . Life expectancy great 3 month 8 . Only patient ChildPugh score liver cirrhosis A ( sum score five parameter : 56 ) allow trial 9 . Subjects HBV infection must antiviral therapy per regional standard care guideline prior initiation study therapy . Both HBeAg positive negative subject include . 10 . Patients must lesions liver amenable CTguided liver biopsy 11 . Patients must normal organ marrow function define : Haemoglobin ≥ 8.5g/dL White Blood Cells ≥ 2000/uL Absolute Neutrophil Count ≥ 1.5 x 10^9/L Platelets ≥ 50 x 10^9/L Total Bilirubin &lt; 3 mg/dL AST ( SGOT ) /ALT ( SGPT ) ≤ 3 x ULN Creatinine ≤ 1.5 x ULN measured/calculated Creatinine Clearance ( CrCl ) ≥ 60 ml/min 12 . Ability understand willingness sign write informed consent document . 13 . Any surgery must 28 day start study drug surgical wound must completely heal 14 . Female subject childbearing potential must negative serum pregnancy test within 3 day prior preradioembolization liver biopsy must agree adequate contraception use time signing inform consent 120 day last dose study drug . Male subject must agree adequate contraception use time signing inform consent 120 day last dose study drug . 1 . Patients exclude receive investigational agent use investigational device within 4 week first dose treatment . Patients exclude receive systemic therapy within 2 week first dose treatment . 2 . Patients know brain metastasis exclude clinical trial poor prognosis often develop progressive neurologic dysfunction would confound evaluation neurologic adverse event . 3 . Prior use antiPD1 , antiPDL1 , antiPDL2 , antiCD137 , antiCTLA4 antibody , drug specifically target Tcell costimulatory checkpoint pathway 4 . Uncontrolled intercurrent illness include , limited , ongoing active infection , symptomatic congestive heart failure , unstable angina pectoris , cardiac arrhythmia , uncontrolled hypertension psychiatric illness/social situation would limit compliance study requirement . 5 . Subjects active autoimmune disease history know suspect autoimmune disease require systemic therapy within past 2 year , except subject vitiligo , resolve childhood asthma/atopy euthyroid patient history Grave 's disease ( subject suspect autoimmune thyroid disorder must negative thyroglobulin thyroid peroxidase antibody thyroid stimulate immunoglobulin prior randomization ) . Replacement therapy ( e.g . thyroxine , insulin , physiologic corticosteroid replacement therapy adrenal pituitary insufficiency etc ) consider form systemic treatment 6 . Pregnant woman breastfeed mother exclude study potential risk foetus baby . Women childbearing potential men must agree use adequate contraception ( hormonal barrier method birth control ; abstinence ) prior study entry duration study participation . Should woman become pregnant suspect pregnant participating study , inform treat physician immediately . 7 . Diagnosis immunodeficiency , include HIV/AIDS 8 . Prior organ allograft allogeneic bone marrow transplantation 9 . History severe hypersensitivity reaction monoclonal antibody . 10 . Prisoners subject involuntarily incarcerate 11 . Subjects compulsorily detain treatment either psychiatric physical ( eg , infectious disease ) illness 12 . Inability comply restriction prohibit activities/treatments study 13 . Chronic treatment systemic steroid immunosuppressive agent . 14 . Subjects concomitant second malignancy ( except adequately treat nonmelanomatous skin cancer , situ cervical cancer , localized prostate cancer situ breast cancer ) exclude unless complete remission achieve least 3 year prior study entry additional therapy require anticipate required 15 . Prior radiation therapy liver upper abdomen 16 . Inability undergo Y90 radioembolisation due inability cathterise hepatic artery , portal vein thrombosis/occlusion limit ability perform selective infusion , Tc99M MAA scan show unfavourable shunt fraction liver pulmonary parenchyma , contraindication RE determine interventional radiologist ( e.g . anatomic variant preclude safe administration Y90 , severe peripheral vascular disease , uncorrectable coagulopathy etc )</criteria>
