	<criteria>Cohort A overview : Patients age le 60 untreated stage III IV classical Hodgkin lymphoma eligible cohort A . In phase I , patient may enroll onto cohort A baseline IPS ≥3 OR PET scan 2 cycle ABVD positive ( Deauville 4 5 ) . Patients enrol base upon IPS score may enroll anytime first 2 cycle ABVD . Patients enrol base upon PET2 positivity may enroll PETscan obtain . In phase II , patient PET2 positivity eligible . Cohort B overview : Patients 60 old untreated classical Hodgkin lymphoma ( regardless stage ) eligible cohort B . The following eligibility criterion apply cohort A B except state otherwise : Histologic diagnosis classical Hodgkin lymphoma FDGavid disease FDGPET/CT Ann Arbor Stage III IV disease ( Cohort A ) WOCBP must negative serum urine pregnancy test ( minimum sensitivity 25 IU/L equivalent unit HCG ) within 24 hour prior start study drug . Women undergo fertility preservation within 2 week begin chemotherapy expect falsepositive pregnancy test therefore test may waive patient .
