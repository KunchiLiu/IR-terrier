	<brief_summary>This study compare quality CT image acquire low-dose radiation process commercially available software vs. PixelShine process image . It would potentially allow image facility acquire CT scan use low dos radiation without sacrifice clarity CT image . Acquiring high quality CT image low-dose radiation potential enhance patient safety significant implication image practice .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>PixelShine vs. Iterative Reconstruction ( IR ) Processing CT Images</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Patients receive CT scan part standard treatment ask consent additional 5 minute image use low-dose radiation prior conventional-dose CT scan . The prospective review perform two cohort : Chest CT scan abdominal CT scan . Anonymized image process conventional CT software compare image process machine-learning-based PixelShine . A board-certified radiologist ass noise visual quality image data . Study patient receive approximately 10 % dose standard CT scan participating study . There know short-term safety issue associate study . The study-related low dose radiation level far used conventional x-ray imaging . The study approve Radiation Safety Committee part review process .</detailed_description>
