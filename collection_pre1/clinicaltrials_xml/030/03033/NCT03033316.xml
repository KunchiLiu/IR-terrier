	<brief_title>A Evaluation Safety Oncocort IV Pegylated Liposomal Dexamethasone Phosphate Patients With Progressive Multiple Myeloma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This open label multicenter study evaluate safety efficacy I.V . Oncocort Dexamethasone sodium phosphate give short term induction therapy Multiple Myeloma patient . It consist Phase 1 part maximum number 5 ascend dose level additional patient treat Phase 2a part recommend phase 2 dose obtain additional safety data preliminary efficacy data multiple myeloma patient . For dose escalation phase 1 part , 3 patient per dose level enrol . If one patient reach DLT , another 3 patient enrol dose level . If two patient reach DLT one dose level , maximum tolerate dose ( MTD ) define last dose level beneath DLT . Not 5 dose level group anticipate part study . MTD Recommended Phase II Dose ( RPTD ) phase IIa part study . For phase 2a part , 7 additional patient enrol RPTD dose level , bring total number patient monitor response dose level least 10 .</detailed_description>
