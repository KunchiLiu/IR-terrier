	<brief_summary>Background : Sleep disorder , include sleep apnea , common traumatic brain injury affect recovery negatively influence participation rehabilitation . Sleep apnea breathe problem person sleep cause brain damage problem think , daily functioning , overall health . Earlier diagnosis treatment important TBI survivor maximize recovery process . There little information guide TBI doctor identify sleep apnea inpatient TBI rehabilitation , phase people experience potential rapid pace improvement . The Agency Healthcare Research highlight gap best method identify sleep apnea separately help consumer TBI rehabilitation choice . Partnering survivor , caregiver , administrator , investigator develop study compare sleep apnea screen diagnostic tool TBI rehabilitation setting . This information provide clinician , provider , patient best information early identification sleep apnea remove negative influence pace recovery early phase TBI . The Goal : Investigators compare exist screening ( Aim 1 ) diagnostic tool ( Aim 2 ) TBI patient undergoing inpatient rehabilitation . For second aim , investigator determine accessible diagnostic test sufficient diagnose sleep apnea compare traditional method use less accessible consumer . If accessible test good enough , increase recognition problem increase patient access earlier sleep apnea treatment . Stakeholders Products . TBI survivor , caregiver , researcher , policymakers work together study help develop study question . Idea exchange include way reach clinician TBI survivors/caregivers via exist educational programming online tool consumer fact sheet patient/caregiver-focused video . Other traditional method include target professional magazine , conference , research journal reach professional work TBI survivor family time admission rehabilitation recovery process .

	<brief_title>Comparison Sleep Apnea Assessment Strategies Maximize TBI Rehabilitation Participation Outcome</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Background Significance : Meta-analyses TBI study find prevalence obstructive sleep apnea ( OSA ) 12 time higher community-based study . Yet , sleep apnea TBI largely undiagnosed . Given sleep critical neural repair disorder sleep may play role slow functional recovery prolonging rehabilitation , early detection sleep apnea critical ( Stakeholder Input ) . Minimal guidance exists inform TBI sleep medicine physician regard assessment sleep disorder acute rehabilitation setting . The Agency Healthcare Research Quality 's ( AHRQ ) Comparative Effectiveness Review highlight insufficient comparative effectiveness evidence diagnostic screening tool . This study propose leverage exist TBI Model System research consortium ( TBIMS ) , fund Departments Health Human Services Veterans Affairs , improve early detection sleep apnea patient TBI undergoing inpatient rehabilitation six study site . Study aim focus around component phase test sleep apnea . Findings inform clinician 's decision screen diagnostic test facilitate early recognition sleep apnea ( outcome ) subsequently prescribe appropriate treatment . Study Aims : Aim I : ( Screening ) For individual TBI , determine comparative effectiveness 2 AASM endorse screening tool ( STOPBang vs. Actigraphy ) identify high risk sleep apnea diagnose Level 1 PSG . Long-term Objectives : To inform clinician 's choice screen measure determine presence sleep apnea . Exploratory Aim : Evaluate alternative screening tool ( Berlin , MAPI ) Level 1 PSG Aim 1 . Aim II : ( Diagnosis ) This study determine diagnostic accuracy ( non-inferiority ) Level 3 PSG determine presence sleep apnea patient acute TBI patient rehabilitation set . Level 1 PSG use criterion standard . Long-term Objectives : To inform clinician 's choice diagnostic test determine presence sleep apnea prescribe appropriate treatment . If Level 3 portable PSG equivalent less accessible Level 1 PSG , increase consumer accessibility . Study Design : This 3-year , multi-center prospective observational cohort study . Intervention Comparators : In Aim I , screen tool STOPBang ACG compare one another determine sensitivity specificity identify patient TBI risk sleep apnea . In Aim II , non-inferiority Level 3 PSG determine presence severity sleep apnea patient moderate severe TBI compare Level 1 PSG . Study Population : Consecutive participant neurorehabilitation exist NIDILRR VA fund TBIMS Center make study population . Patients age 16 older ( 18 old VA site ) , moderate severe TBI , admit rehabilitation U.S. TBIMS inpatient rehabilitation facility , sleep &gt; 2 hours/night suggest habitual sleep duration . Based historical data six study site participate study , investigator study conservatively estimate 70 % patient admitted inpatient TBI rehabilitation would consent study ( N=20/month ) , result 13-month enrollment estimate 259 patient . Power analyse study aim suggest sample size 237 large sample size need sufficient power . The site participate study aim collectively enroll 259 patient account possible attrition . Based TBIMS data acquire past 25-years , 44 % sample female , 64 % categorized Non-White , median age 38 year , predominantly moderate severe TBI . Primary outcome consist : 1 ) Positive predictive power screening tool : STOPBang ACG , 2 ) Equivalency detection sleep apnea via Level 1 Level 3 PSG , diagnosis sleep apnea base overall apnea-hypopnea index ( AHI ) &gt; 5 . Analytic Methods : Aim 1 : Investigators expect STOPBang value &gt; 5 abnormal ACG total sleep time ( &lt; 5 hour desaturation ) produce sufficiently high SEs reasonable tradeoff SP ( note SE SP inversely relate ) . Similarly , Level 1 PSG , diagnosis sleep apnea make AHI ≥ 5 . Cross-tabulations STOPBang ACG screen high risk sleep apnea ( positive/negative ) versus Level 1 PSG diagnosis ( positive/negative ) construct estimate diagnostic accuracy ( i.e. , sensitivity , specificity , positive negative predictive value , diagnostic accuracy ) estimate along 95 % confidence interval . To address hypothesis 1.1 , two-sided McNemar 's test use compare paired SEs pair SPs STOPBang ACG assume significance level α = 0.05 . Aim 2 : The sensitivity ( SE ) specificity ( SP ) Level 3 PSG ( compare Level 1 PSG , reference gold standard ) estimate compare fix hypothesize rate SE SP 90 % 60 % , respectively , consider sufficiently large enough . Level 1 PSG ( reference ) diagnosis sleep apnea make base AHI ≥ 5 . Level 3 PSG ( test ) diagnosis make base AHI ≥ 5 . A cross-tabulation Level 3 PSG ( positive/negative ) versus Level 1 PSG ( positive/negative ) construct standard measure diagnostic accuracy estimate along 95 % confidence interval ( i.e. , sensitivity , specificity , positive negative predictive value , diagnostic accuracy ) .To test non-inferiority SE 90 % SP 60 % , non-inferiority threshold 0.1 assume . If low bound 95 % confidence interval SE strictly 80 % low bound confidence interval SP strictly 50 % non-inferiority Level 3 PSG ( compare Level 3 PSG ) establish .</detailed_description>
