	<brief_summary>This trial evaluate two standard care treatment opioid addiction : methadone buprenorphine/naloxone . In order improve patient care , study address real-world treatment condition , include patient engagement , strict regulation methadone dosing ( i.e . initially dispensed daily pharmacy stabilisation ) vs. flexible take-home dose buprenorphine/naloxone , treatment adherence , among others . The OPTIMA study design intention support patient-provider decision-making evaluate health relate outcomes overall aim improve treatment outcome enhance patient-centered approach clinical care .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Pragmatic Randomized Control Trial Comparing Models Care Management Prescription Opioid Misuse</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This multicenter , open-label , 2-arm , randomized trial pragmatic design involve 276 individual prescription opioid use disorder . Participants randomize receive either : 1 . Methadone provide via initial daily witness ingestion per local guideline . 2 . Buprenorphine/naloxone maintenance therapy provide via flexible take-home dose regimen dispense per physician 's discretion , clinical stability achieve . Once randomize study medication treatment initiation induction begin , study physician participant discuss treatment plan procedures go forward . Once treatment initiation take place , participant attend study visit every 2 week ( include collection urine sample ) 24-week intervention period . For study site , standardize guideline exist adhered safe induction medication . The study timeline 28 week , include screening , randomization period 28 day prior treatment initiation/induction .
