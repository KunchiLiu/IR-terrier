	<brief_title>Study RelayPro Thoracic Stent-Graft Subjects With Acute , Complicated Type B Aortic Dissection</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This clinical trial prospective , multicenter , non-blinded , non-randomized study design assess RelayPro thoracic endografts treatment acute , complicate type B aortic dissection . The primary endpoint measure all-cause mortality 30 day post-procedure . Subjects enrol first come , first serve basis ; however , single investigational site may enroll 20 % propose sample size 80 subject . A subject consider enrolled arterial access gain attempt make introduce RelayPro Thoracic Stent-Graft . Enrollment expect begin mid-2016 complete end 2020 . All subject enrol , define , include patient population primary safety analysis . All subject implant RelayPro Thoracic Stent-Graft include patient population primary effectiveness analysis .</detailed_description>
	<criteria>Subject must acute ( symptom onset diagnosis within 2 week ) subacute , complicate type B aortic dissection ( entire dissection distal leave subclavian artery ( LSA ) ) , confirm Computed Tomography Angiography ( CTA ) Magnetic Resonance Angiogram ( MRA ) , time symptom onset diagnosis â‰¤ 6 week , least one following : Malperfusion viscera , kidney , spinal cord , low extremity , measure clinical radiographic evidence ; Rupture ; Intractable pain . Proximal distal aortic neck diameter 19 mm 42 mm . Subject 's anatomy must meet follow anatomical criterion : a. Proximal attachment zone distal leave common carotid distal attachment zone proximal origin celiac artery . i. Dissection permit distal attachment zone permit proximal attachment zone . b . The length attachment zone depend intend stentgraft diameter type graft select . c. The proximal attachment zone : . 15 mm 22 28 mm RelayPro graft bare stent ( 20 mm RelayPro graft nonbare stent ) . ii . 20 mm 30 46 mm RelayPro graft bare stent ( 25 mm RelayPro graft nonbare stent ) . iii . Proximal nondissected segment ( healthy zone ) . d. The distal attachment zone 20 mm RelayPro graft . e. Coverage leave subclavian artery permit mandatory revascularization patent leave internal mammary artery ( LIMA ) bypass leave upper extremity ( LUE ) arteriovenous graft anomalous vertebral artery aorta . Revascularization must perform prior device placement , may occur implant procedure , provide coverage LSA endograft . 5 . Proximal attachment zone contain straight segment ( nontapered , nonreversetapered , define &lt; 10 % diameter change ) lengths equal great require attachment length intend device . 6 . Vascular dimension ( e.g. , aortic diameter , length leave subclavian celiac artery ) must range safely treated RelayPro Thoracic StentGrafts . 7 . Adequate iliac femoral artery access introduction RelayPro Delivery System . Alternative method gain proper access may utilize ( e.g. , iliac conduit ) . 8 . Subject willing comply followup evaluation schedule . 9 . Subject ( Legally Authorized Representative , LAR ) agree sign Informed Consent Form prior treatment . Subjects exclude study follow apply : 1 . Diagnosis traumatic injury transection descend thoracic aorta . 2 . Significant stenosis , calcification , thrombus , tortuosity intend fixation site would compromise fixation seal device . 3 . Planned coverage leave carotid celiac artery ; anatomic variant would compromise circulation carotid , vertebral , innominate artery device placement , amenable subclavian revascularization . 4 . Prior endovascular surgical repair descend thoracic aorta . The device may place within prior endovascular surgical graft . 5 . Concomitant aneurysm/disease ascend aorta , aortic arch , abdominal aorta , require repair . Dissection extension abdominal aorta acceptable . 6 . Prior abdominal aortic aneurysm repair ( endovascular surgical ) perform less 6 month prior plan stent implant procedure . 7 . Major surgical medical procedure within 30 day prior planned procedure , schedule major surgical medical procedure within 30 day post implantation . This exclude planned procedure prospective stentgraft placement . 8 . Untreatable allergy sensitivity contrast medium device component , include metal stent . 9 . Known suspected connective tissue disorder . 10 . Blood coagulation disorder bleed diathesis treatment suspend one week pre and/or postrepair . 11 . Coronary artery disease unstable angina . 12 . Severe congestive heart failure ( New York Heart Association functional class IV ) . 13 . Stroke and/or Myocardial Infarction ( MI ) within 3 month plan treatment date . 14 . Pulmonary disease require routine ( daily nightly ) need oxygen therapy outside hospital setting . 15 . Acute renal failure chronic renal insufficiency , receive dialysis . 16 . Hemodynamically unstable . 17 . Active systemic infection and/or mycotic aneurysm . 18 . Bowel necrosis . 19 . Morbid obesity condition may compromise prevent necessary imaging requirement . 20 . ASA risk classification = V ( Moribund patient expect live 24 hour without operation ) . 21 . Less twoyear life expectancy . 22 . Current planned participation investigational drug device study complete primary endpoint evaluation . 23 . Currently pregnant plan become pregnant course study . 24 . Medical , social , psychological issue Investigator believe may interfere treatment followup .</criteria>
