	<brief_summary>Chronic obstructive lung disease disable disease affect people usually several year smoke tobacco exposure affect million patient worldwide . The disease mark multiple episode worsening , term exacerbation necessitate frequent hospitalization . During exacerbation , patient present breathless , severe case , admit Intensive Care Unit ( ICU ) respiratory assistance . Currently , respiratory assistance provide ventilator via oronasal mask ( referred non-invasive ventilation , NIV ) , help patient cope breathless . The mask always well tolerated ventilator session deliver intermittently . In past decade , new technique provide air-oxygen high flow develop . This technique , call High Flow via Nasal Cannula ( HFNC ) deliver 21 100 % heat humidified air-oxygen high flow gas via simple nasal cannula . Recent study show technique efficient treat patient present acute respiratory failure n't underlie chronic pulmonary disease . Whether technique would also efficient patient COLD present severe exacerbation yet demonstrate . Since HFNC require mask , think comfort patient would much well comparison NIV could potentially help treat many patient disease . The objective present study study physiological effect HFNC compare NIV patient severe exacerbation COPD show non-inferior NIV .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Design : Prospective , observational , cross-over , clinical physiologic study HFNC NIV patient COPD hypercapnic respiratory failure Intervention : Participants consecutively ventilate two device , i.e. , HFNC NIV . HFNC 30 50 L/min apply random order ( seal , opaque envelope ) . HFNC set temperature 37°C 34°C perceived warm . NIV setting adjust base clinical assessment Respiratory Therapist per standard practice modify test . In group , FiO2 adjust achieve SpO2 least 92 % . Setting : The intervention apply Medical-Surgical ICU St. Michael 's Hospital . Duration : Each device study 30 minute . The entire study take place approximately 3 hour . There additional follow-up thereafter . Procedures : The study start first recording patient spontaneous breathe consider baseline ( sequence # 1 ) . Under spontaneous breathing , patient receive oxygen therapy usually do 2 NIV session . Then , patient 20 -30 minute acclimatize HFNC select his/her preferred flow rate ( sequence # 2 ) . NIV apply ( sequence # 3 ) . The NIV setting adjust base clinical assessment Respiratory Therapist modify throughout study . Then , accord randomization order ( sealed envelope ) , patient receive flow corresponding preferred flow select patient second flow , either HFNC 30 L/min HFNC 50 L/min depend initial choice ( sequence # 4 # 5 ) ( see flow diagram ) . FiO2 adjust achieve SpO2 90 94 % . Each condition study 30 minute separate 5-minute washout period patient receive oxygen therapy . The measurement collect baseline ( spontaneous breathing ) last five minute condition . In case clinical intolerance consider attend physician , study stop . In case patient consider dependent NIV clinician , still enroll patient without baseline period discussion clinician . The pulse oximeter ( SpO2 ) transcutaneous CO2 monitor ( SenTec Digital Monitoring System ( SDMS ) ) continuously monitor throughout study period . Exspiron device calibrate measure minute ventilation . Four surface electrode place bilaterally record hemidiaphragm activity use specific record system ( Acqknowledge software , Biopac Systems ) A bedside ultrasound examination perform , use SonoSite system ( Fujifilm ) equip 10-15 MHz ultrasound linear probe . Diaphragm thickness measure end-inspiration end-expiration . This technique apply end sequence ( ventilatory assist conventional O2 therapy ) . In patient become rapidly intolerant NIV disconnection , limit `` baseline '' period O2 minimum ( 5 minute ) . The thickness contraction intercostal muscle abdominal muscle also assess . Interpretation ultrasound result determine diaphragm muscle thickness read late time individual blind intervention .</detailed_description>
