	<brief_summary>The study compare two invasive method ( FFR -fractional flow reserve iFR—instantaneous wave free ratio ) assessment hemodynamic impact coronary stenosis myocardial perfusion . There good correlation method assessment hemodynamic significance broad spectrum lesion . However , correlation decrease significantly near cut point method . The investigator try find possible explanation difference detail morphology assessment coronary stenosis use optical coherence tomography ( OCT ) , analysis gene polymorphisms play role vasodilatation , shear stress analysis . The head-to-head comparison FFR iFR simple , `` gold standard '' assessment hemodynamic significance . Studies compare method use hyperemic stenosis resistance ( HSR ) . For kind measurement necessary measure speed blood flow . This usually do Doppler analysis flow . Unfortunately , Doppler signal yield many artificial erroneous indicator , obtain good quality signal frequently time-consuming . These reason HSR use routine practice . The investigator develop new console software provide real time analysis Doppler signal . It allow u easily measure HSR , differentiate FFR iFR measure intrabeat analysis microvascular resistance ( low microvascular resistance essential condition proper pressure measurement ) . Using tool , possible automatically identify point low microvascular resistance cardiac beat . The pressure gradient measure point .

	<detailed_description>BACKGROUND AND RATIONALE FOR THE STUDY Coronary artery disease ( CAD ) frequent cause death disability develop country . The main diagnostic method detection CAD coronary angiography ( CAG . However , correlation CAG proven hemodynamic significance borderline stenosis ( 40-70 % lumen narrow ) 50 % . The main method detection flow-limiting lesion fractional flow reserve ( FFR ) . FFR calculate distal pressure ( Pd ) divide proximal pressure ( Pa ) . The cut-off hemodynamic significance 0.8 le . The use FFR lesion assessment level recommendation I A European guideline coronary intervention 2014 . The FAME trail reveal routine usage FFR measurement decrease cost coronary intervention two year . The reason small quantity implant stent decreased number procedure stent restenosis direct result low incidence initial stent implantation . FAME-2 trial show low incidence urgent revascularization patient FFR le 0,8 treated coronary intervention compare treat conservatively . This study preliminary halt reach mortality endpoint safety reason . Critical condition proper FFR measurement maximal vasodilatation . Since marker condition base pressure measurement presume reach adenosine administration . There lot limitation assumption . Foremost , technique proper intravenous intracoronary adenosine administration must follow strict rule therefore do incorrectly lead wrong result case . Furthermore , impaired endothelial function lead low response adenosine administration . This situation lead false negative FFR result . The patient CAD frequently significant endothelial dysfunction cause low response vasodilatation stimulus . Endothelial dysfunction analyze system name EndoPAT ( Itamar Medical , Israel ) measure ischemia induced vasodilatation finger . The hypothesis never test polymorphism gene enzyme play important role proper endothelial function ( HO-1 , hemoxygenase-1 ENOS , endothelial NO synthase ) influence adenosine-induced vasodilatation subsequently FFR measurement . These polymorphisms infrequent population CAD ( find 40-50 % patient ) . Another possible limitation FFR measurement type blood flow coronary artery . In presence coronary stenosis , plaque roughness sharp angle lumen type flow change laminar turbulent . This type flow even accelerate hyperemia induce adenosine administration . It lead lose energy exaggerates pressure drop behind stenosis - reason- may proportional stenosis severity . This situation theoretically cause false positive FFR measurement . To answer question investigator analyze endothelial shear stress ( ESS ) distinguish laminar turbulent flow morphological index ( plaque surface , plaque eccentricity , lumen volume lumen shape ) optical coherence tomography ( OCT ) . The new index able identify physiologically significant stenosis recently describe . It instantaneous wave-free ratio ( iFR ) . This technique use pressure gradient well , -unlike FFR- iFR compare pressure ( proximal distal stenosis ) specific phase diastole ( call `` wave free period '' ) , microvascular resistance naturally low stable . The cut point iFR 0.9 . The correlation FFR iFR 80 % 90 % lesion . However , correlation FFR iFR close cut-off point 50 % -60 % . It substantial caveat , estimate hemodynamic significance borderline lesion main indication technique . Discrepancies FFR iFR confuse discourage lesion hemodynamic assessment . Nowadays , FFR invasive method stenosis hemodynamic assessment support guideline . However , iFR faster , easy cheap , reason use lesion patient , improve situation poor penetration hemodynamic guidance coronary intervention daily practice . Moreover , increase number evidence implies iFR concept close real situation coronary artery ( avoid non-physiologic vasodilatation ) . It show FFR factor variability 10 % . This mean around cut-off point FFR wrong iFR , perhaps even . Moreover , late study show iFR provide well pressure-derived diagnostic agreement CFR ( coronary flow reserve ) FFR . The investigator develop , close cooperation The University Iowa , new technique improve quality flow measurement . It successfully test animal trial . It novel way intravascular Doppler signal processing result reliable velocity curve envelope acquisition . This software improvement allow instantaneous monitor real time microvascular resistance phase cardiac cycle . Detection instantaneous wave free period serve verification proprietary iFR calculation . The system may also improve iFR measurement , measure precisely in-phase low microvascular resistance . The measurement resistance wave free period name iMR ( instantaneous microvascular resistance ) never measure previous trial . This index greatly help distinguish method ( FFR iFR ) measure pressure gradient low resistance . Further target develop next generation software detect low microvascular resistance base pressure measurement , without necessity use Doppler . It could offer precise simple method hemodynamic assessment coronary lesion . This software must test verified human study , do General Teaching Hospital ( intracoronary pressure flow measure ) . Its clinical availability test verified international cooperating center ( pressure index , FFR iFR measure ) . The foreign center also examine coronary OCT send corelab The University Iowa , collect blood sample genetic analysis do Prague , depend possibility , also endothelial dysfunction EndoPAT . The University Iowa , Iowa , USA analyze OCT measurement perform 3D vessel reconstruction . This university world know team unique 3D reconstruction coronary artery base angiography optical coherence tomography . This institution automate analysis plaque surface well . HYPOTHESES : 1 . The level microvascular resistance use distinguish type measurement ( FFR iFR ) do lower stable stage microvascular resistance . This comparison possibly explain discrepancy FFR iFR measurement . 2 . Based new software , use pressure measurement , possible automatically detect time period low microvascular resistance . This could improve accuracy FFR iFR measurement . 3 . Plaque rupture , erosion , irregularity plaque geometry plaque locate near bifurcation cause turbulence blood flow . This accelerated pressure drop lead false positive FFR . 4 . Inadequate vasodilation cause endothelial dysfunction lead false negative FFR . 5 . Endothelial dysfunction frequently find patient risk type polymorphism gene play important role vessel vasodilatation ( ENOS , HO-1 ) AIMS AND EXPECTED IMPACT ON CLINICAL PRACTICE 1 . To use new software ( developed author 's workplace cooperation The University Iowa ) determine two method functional assessment coronary stenosis ( FFR iFR ) perform measurement low level microvascular resistance . This software measure microvascular resistance real time . 2 . To develop new version software detection microvascular resistance level , base intracoronary pressure without flow analysis . This could substantially improve accuracy pressure-based measurement , potentially increase correlation pressure base measurement flow-based CFR . 3 . To study potential influence endothelial dysfunction plaque morphology discrepancy FFR iFR functional assessment coronary stenosis . 4 . To study influence gene polymorphisms endothelial dysfunction METHODS Study design Patients stable angina pectoris suitable coronary angiography suitable study . We plan include 250 patient study ( 50 General University Hospital Prague 200 cooperate center ) . Functional examination coronary artery . Coronary angiography perform first procedure detection severity extent coronary atherosclerosis . Stenosis 40-80 % ( base CAG ) suitable morphological functional examination . Combo wire ( Volcano Corp. , USA ) pressure flow measurement introduce behind lesion basal index measure basal flow condition : basal flow speed , pressure gradient ( Pd/Pa ) , iFR , Pd/Pa low microvascular resistance proven Doppler analysis , iMR . Adenosine administer either intracoronary bolus ( 240 ug ) continual infusion ( 140 μg/kg/min ) base local practice . The hyperemic index measure : maximal flow speed , CFR , FFR , HSR ( hyperemic stenosis resistance .
