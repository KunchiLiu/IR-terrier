	<brief_title>Evaluation Effectiveness Quality Life With Administration Fixed Combination Budesonide Formoterol Greek Patients With Asthma During Routine Clinical Practice .</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Asthma heterogeneous disease , usually characterize chronic inflammation airway . Characterized history respiratory symptom wheeze , chest heaviness cough symptom fluctuate time , well variable airway obstruction . Asthma common disease worldwide , rate increase child adult . It estimate asthma affect 1-18 % population different country . In Greece , country low rate asthma , estimate 8.6 % population suffers disease . The diagnosis asthma base : Background characteristic symptom , sign variable airway obstruction , test reversal bronchial obstruction test . Long-term treatment asthma follow objective 1. symptom control : achieve adequate control symptoms maintain normal activity level 2 . Risk Reduction : minimize risk future exacerbation , permanent airflow obstruction side effect medication Pulmoton® inhale combination budesonide formoterol fumarate dihydrate portion 100 / 6mcg , 200 / 6mcg , 400/12 mcg , administer Elpenhlaler® device , develop ELPEN . It approve bronchodilator treatment asthma administration combination ( inhaled corticosteroid long-beta2-agonist action ) appropriate patient adequately control inhaled corticosteroid 'as need ' inhaled beta2-agonists short-acting patient already adequately control inhaled corticosteroid long-acting beta2-agonists . Pulmoton® recommend initial treatment asthma . The dosage individual component Pulmoton® separate must adjust accord severity condition . This consider beginning therapy fix combination product , also adjust maintenance dosage . The dose adjust low possible , achieve maintain effective control symptom . Patients regularly reassess doctor , dose Pulmoton® receive remain optimal . When achieve long-term control symptom low recommend dose , next step may test single administration inhale corticosteroid . There two alternative treatment asthma Pulmoton® : A. Pulmoton® maintenance therapy : Pulmoton® take regular maintenance treatment separate rapid-acting bronchodilator relief symptom . B. Pulmoton® maintenance reliever therapy : Pulmoton® take regular maintenance 'on demand ' therapy treat symptom . A. Pulmoton® maintenance therapy : Patients advise always carry fast-acting bronchodilator use need relief . More information effectiveness safety study drug , report Summary Product Characteristics ( Summary Product Characteristics ( SmPC ) This prospective observational study aim collect data regard Pulmoton® everyday clinical practice , improve quality life patient disease progression . The center study approximately 100 , hospital private pulmonary clinic hold . Data collect period 6 month patient diagnose asthma adequately control inhaled corticosteroid 'as need ' inhaled beta2-agonists short-acting patient already adequately control inhaled corticosteroid beta2-long-acting stimulant . Data collect period three ( 3 ) six ( 6 ) month ( ± 2 week ) initiation treatment inhaled combination include spirometry data , ( FEV1 , FVC , FEV / FVC ) , checklist ACQ , AQLQ questionnaire questionnaire FSI 10 , detail exist comorbidities .</detailed_description>
