	<brief_title>Everolimus TDM Predict Long Term Toxicity</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Everolimus oral inhibitor mammalian target rapamycin ( mTOR ) , key signal transduction molecule phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase/Akt pathway . This pathway , regulate cellular growth , proliferation , metabolism , survival angiogenesis , frequently dysregulated human cancer thus rational target anticancer therapy . Everolimus currently approve European Medicines Agency ( EMA ) U.S. Food Drug administration ( FDA ) treatment different solid malignancy . Metastatic ( Hormone-Receptor [ HR ] -positive , HER2-negative ) breast cancer ( BC ) , advance unresectable neuroendocrine tumour pancreatic ( pNET ) , gastrointestinal lung origin metastatic renal cell carcinoma ( mRCC ) diseases poor outcome . Everolimus part palliative treatment increase patient ' median progression-free survival ( PFS ) 4.6 month metastatic BC ( mBC ) , 7 month pNET 3 month mRCC . However , serious adverse event ( AEs ) occur frequently ; stomatitis 67 % , non-infectious pneumonitis ( NIP ) 15 % . This reduce effectiveness everolimus , AEs manage dose reduction , treatment interruption even complete discontinuation everolimus . Everolimus show large inter-individual pharmacokinetic variation whole blood concentration , due variability oral drug availability , patient non-compliance ( e.g . due drug-related toxicity , forget and/or overuse ) , drug-drug interaction co-medication many factor . Furthermore , variation population pharmacokinetics everolimus cause everolimus ' hematocrit effect . This effect present high everolimus concentration combination low hematocrit value , likely case oncologic population . High incidence anemia oncologic patient treat everolimus described , respectively 32.1 % ( CI=17.5-51.3 % ) all-grade ( grades 1-4 ) toxicities 6.9 % ( 95 % CI=4.1-11.3 % ) high-grade ( grades 3-4 ) toxicity . Therefore , study recommend correct everolimus whole blood concentration hematocrit determination . The different whole blood concentration individual result supratherapeutic subtherapeutic exposure level consequently over- undertreatment , respectively . Despite inter-patient variability systemic exposure , everolimus currently prescribe fix dose . Given narrow therapeutic index positive exposure-efficacy relationship , rationale pharmacokinetically guide dosing also know therapeutic drug monitoring ( TDM ) everolimus . Such approach could theoretically contribute tailor-made everolimus treatment improve therapeutic efficacy decrease risk toxicity . Since daily everolimus dose demonstrates dose proportionality linear pharmacokinetics , seem easily applicable . Furthermore , requirement dose reduction physician discretion support know everolimus trough level dose reduction recommend . Therapeutic-drug-monitoring ( TDM ) ( i.e . measurement everolimus whole blood level venipuncture ) use adjust prescribed daily dose , maintain effective everolimus whole blood concentration , low possible risk AEs . In addition , TDM useful tool early detection non-adherence , might also use monitor effect drug-drug interaction food effect . While TDM , accord international consensus , common transplantation medicine 10 year , implement oncology . The importance TDM oncology , however , support previous research show 2-fold increase trough concentration ( Cmin ) everolimus whole blood short-term risk grade ≥ 3 pulmonary event ( relative risk [ RR ] 1.9 ; 95 % CI 1.1-3.3 ] , stomatitis event ( RR 1.5 ; 95 % CI 1.1-2.1 ) metabolic event ( RR 1.3 95 % 1.0-1.7 ) . Moreover , exposure-toxicity relationship everolimus patient thyroid cancer observe , since initial everolimus concentration could associate early toxicity ( &lt; 12 week ) , i.e . stomatitis . However , association initial everolimus measurement long-term AEs ( ≥ 12 week , e.g . pneumonitis , anorexia anemia ) grade need everolimus dose reduction could make . Since trough concentration approximately 18 µg/L associate toxicity , investigator assume upper therapeutic window everolimus oncologic set ±18 µg/L . Therefore , upper threshold &gt; 18 µg/L consider study.Similarly , tendency improve PFS overall survival ( OS ) note CminSS 14.1 μg/L . This might lower limit therapeutic window . However , follow knowledge gap exist : 1 . It unknown whether everolimus trough whole blood level ( time ) predict long-term AEs ( ≥12 week , e.g . pneumonitis , anorexia anemia ) . 2 . The optimal concentration range everolimus , treatment mBC , mRCC , ( p ) NET unknown , especially upper limit associate toxicity . 3 . It unknown everolimus concentration level associate need everolimus dose reduction . In order quantitate outcome toxicity , number dose reduction investigate sum different toxicity experience patient also toxicity lead clinical action treat physician . Furthermore , especially NCI-CTCAE v4.0 grade ≥2 important , special attention focus AEs highly prevalent , objectively measurable , clinically relevant and/or untreatable . These AEs lead dose reduction discontinuation therapy . Dose individualization base measure drug concentration could theoretically result less toxicity efficacy . Further study require determine clinical utility TDM everolimus oncology setting . Determination everolimus concentration onset severe AEs ( dose interruption reduction ) disease progression may enable good understand pathophysiology , permit dose reduction right moment rather drug withdrawal patient high everolimus concentration . The clinical impact approach large , since everolimus treatment optimization well unnecessary switch next line palliative treatment oncologic patient . This support study Generali et al. , find combination everolimus plus exemestaan first- second-line therapy mBC patient efficacious several chemotherapy regimen report literature . Furthermore , important realise initial concentration ( &lt; 12 week ) reflect change steady-state trough concentration time ( ≥12 week ) due various reason . Some drug-drug interaction , high-fat food effect , change haematocrit , non-adherence , dose-reductions interruption everolimus treatment . Follow everolimus concentration time implies frequent pharmacokinetic sampling ( blood draw ) . Nowadays everolimus exposure determine everolimus concentration measurement whole blood . Therefore , venipuncture always necessary . This invasive require patient come hospital . It would convenient patient everolimus concentration determine dried blood spot ( DBS ) analysis . With DBS single drop blood finger necessary , do home send regular mail analysis . Previous study show feasibility DBS approach oncologic set . The physician may benefit ease DBS sample method provide result timely patient visit clinic ( routine ) check-up . Previous method measurement everolimus mean DBS develop . In past , emphasis put development analytical validation assay clinical validation minor importance . Some information gather transplantation medicine . However , patient cancer , correlation everolimus DBS concentration whole blood concentration unknown . Furthermore , information regard important everolimus hematocrit effect DBS high concentration level common oncology population lack . Therefore , secondary objective determine everolimus concentration collect DBS finger prick DBS paper spike drop venipunctured whole blood contain everolimus .</detailed_description>
