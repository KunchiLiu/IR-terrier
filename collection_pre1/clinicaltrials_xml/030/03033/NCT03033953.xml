	<brief_title>Effects Native Whey Milk Supplementation Adaptations 12 Weeks Strength Training Young Elderly</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Increasing maintain muscle mass great importance population range athlete patient elderly . Resistance exercise protein ingestion two potent stimulators muscle protein synthesis . Both physical characteristic protein ( e.g . different digestion rate whey casein ) amino acid composition , affect potential certain protein stimulate muscle protein synthesis . Given superior ability rapidly increase blood leucine concentration high level , whey often consider potent protein source stimulate muscle protein synthesis . Native whey protein produce filtration unprocessed milk . Consequently , native whey different characteristic milk . Of special interest high amount highly anabolic amino acid leucine native whey . The high level leucine great interest elderly individual study elderly show anabolic resistance effect protein feed strength training . By increase level leucine one might overcome anabolic resistance elderly . The aim double-blinded , randomize , partial cross-over study compare change muscle hypertrophy strength 11 ( elderly ) 12 ( young ) week train intervention daily supplementation either 2x20g native whey milk proteins young elderly individual . In order explain potential difference supplement acute study investigate acute response blood amino acid concentration intracellular signalling plan , subgroup participant , train intervention . The investigator hypothesize native whey induce great muscle hypertrophy strength gain milk .</detailed_description>
