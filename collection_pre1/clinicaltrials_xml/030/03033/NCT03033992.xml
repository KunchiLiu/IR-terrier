	<brief_title>Feasibility Trial Optune Children With Recurrent Progressive Supratentorial High-Grade Glioma Ependymoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Primary Objectives : I To establish feasibility treatment Optune device pediatric patient recurrent/refractory/progressive supratentorial malignant glioma ependymoma . II To describe Optune device treatment-related toxicity child recurrent/refractory/progressive supratentorial malignant glioma ependymoma . Secondary Objectives : I To estimate response rate Event-Free Survival ( EFS ) markers anti-tumor activity Optune device within context feasibility trial . II To assess association anti-tumor activity compliance Optune device use within context small feasibility study . III To explore impact Optune device child family undergo therapy , explore association demographic ( e.g. , SES , gender ) , disease ( e.g. , risk status ) , treatment , behavioral variable health-related quality life ( QoL ) change . IV To explore association apparent diffusion coefficient ( ADC ) value within tumor correlate response Optune treatment EFS . Outline : The Optune wear minimum 18 hour day , recommendation 22 hours/day least 23 day 28-day cycle . Cycle 1 include 7 day train period , follow 28 day treatment ( total 35 day ) . The patient receive multiple 28-day cycle continuous Optune treatment . In absence treatment relate serious adverse event disease progression , Optune continue 26 cycle . The patient follow 30 day last application Optune device .</detailed_description>
