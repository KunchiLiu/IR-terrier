	<brief_summary>Study Design - Multicenter , open-label , 3 arm , stepwise , phase Ⅱa clinical trial Study objective : 1 . Primary - To evaluate safety TTAC-0001 patient recurrent glioblastoma . 2 . Secondary - To determine efficacy TTAC-0001 patient recurrent glioblastoma . 3 . Exploratory - To evaluate pharmacokinetic ( PK ) parameter TTAC-0001 patient recurrent glioblastoma - To evaluate pharmacodynamic ( PD ) parameter clinical biomarker test Study Methodology Patients sequentially enrol 1st arm . An enrollment criterion next arm define patient previous treatment arm show grade ≥3 hemangioma Dose Limiting Toxicities ( DLT ) . A safety review committee ( SRC ) convene determine patient 's safety decision enrollment next arm change dose frequency study drug case . A patient withdrawn study completion 1st cycle replace another patient . Patients treat 1 year , unless cause termination occur , progression disease ( PD ) withdrawal consent .</brief_summary>
