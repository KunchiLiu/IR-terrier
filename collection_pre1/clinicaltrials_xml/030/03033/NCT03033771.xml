	<detailed_description>Aortic dissection ( AD ) surge blood tear aortic intima separation intima medium creation false lumen . The dissection may occur anywhere along aorta extend proximally distally artery . It occur commonly proximal ascend aorta ( within 5 cm aortic valve ) descend thoracic aorta ( beyond origin leave subclavian artery ) . The passage blood false channel lead complication spinal cord injury ( paraplegia ) , lack blood supply intestine ( mesenteric ischemia ) low extremity . The flow blood false channel cause complication pinching/narrowing flow blood branch aorta . Aortic dissection always occur set pre-existing degeneration aortic medium . Causes include connective tissue disorder injury . Atherosclerotic risk factor , notably hypertension , contribute two third patient . Evidence dissection find 1 3 % autopsy . Population-based study suggest incidence AD approximately 5-30 case per million people per year . The diagnosis AD miss 40 % case initial presentation , 30 % AD first diagnose post mortem exam . African-Americans , men , elderly , people hypertension especially risk . Peak incidence occur age 50 65 , patient congenital connective tissue disorder ( eg , Marfan syndrome , Ehlers-Danlos syndrome ) , age 20 40 . Aortic dissection classify anatomically , The DeBakey classification system widely use . - Type I ( 50 % dissection ) : These dissection start ascend aorta extend least aortic arch sometimes beyond . - Type II ( 35 % ) : These dissection start confine ascend aorta . - Type III ( 15 % ) : These dissection start descend thoracic aorta beyond origin leave subclavian artery extend distally , less commonly , proximally . The Stanford system simpler . - Type A : These dissection involve ascend aorta . - Type B : These dissection confine descend thoracic aorta . Patients uncomplicated type B dissection 30-day mortality 10 % . Conversely , develop ischemic leg , renal failure , visceral ischemia , contain rupture often require urgent aortic repair ; mortality 20 % day 2 , 25 % day 30 . For uncomplicated acute chronic type B dissection , several series show drug treatment alone result 78 % three year survival discharge hospital . Current guideline deem medical management remain gold standard uncomplicated type B aortic dissection benchmark difficult surpass . However , medical treatment alone may put patient risk serious complication progressive aortic enlargement , poor blood flow organ extremity , aortic rupture . The development complicate dissection—defined presence visceral limb ischaemia , rupture , refractory pain , uncontrollable hypertension—is key factor determines intervention outcome patient type B dissection . Surgery virtually always indicate dissection involve proximal aorta ( type A dissection ) complicate aortic dissection . In addition surgery may also best acute distal dissection patient Marfan syndrome . The goal surgery obliterate entry false channel reconstitute aorta synthetic graft . Predictors conventional surgery poor outcome include hypotension , renal failure , age &gt; 70 , abrupt onset chest pain , pulse deficit , ST-segment elevation Electrocardiography . TEVAR ( Thoracic Endovascular Aortic Repair ) aim cover primary entry tear descend aorta , result reduction flow pressure false lumen formation false lumen thrombosis . Covered stent bare stent reconstruction branch vessel re-entry tear , false lumen thrombosis remodelling . For acute ( first 2 week ) type B aortic dissection , pool early mortality rate 6.4 % medical treatment increase 10.2 % TEVAR 17.5 % open surgery , mostly complicate case . IRAD ( International Registry Acute Aortic Dissection ) report in-hospital mortality rate 32 % surgically treated individual , 7 % manage endovascular technique , 10 % manage medical therapy alone . The in-hospital mortality rate patient complicate type B dissection significantly high open surgery ( 33 % ) endovascular treatment ( 11 % ) . This demonstrated appropriate use endovascular stent graft placement , patient complicate dissection enjoy improve prognosis , eventually similar patient uncomplicated stable course require medical management . The presence rigid chronic dissection flap multiple chronic re-entries often locate distal treat thoracic aorta could negative impact outcome . For patient dissection extend abdominal aorta , TEVAR seldom definitive treatment , continue perfusion distal lumen could create problem . The endovascular approach associate less morbidity mortality . However , longterm efficacy endovascular approach prevent long-term aortic relate death still unclear . Paraplegia retrograde dissection two dread complication TEVAR type B dissection . Retrograde dissection occur 1 % 4 % patient prevalent proximal land zone arch . Spinal cord ischemia rate low TEVAR open repair , complication remain concern report 4 % patient treat TEVAR chronic dissection . This result compare favourably open repair , report 7 % 36 % paraplegia risk . Additionally , significant proportion ( 12 % -60 % ) patient experience disease progression follow-up TEVAR , thus require surgical procedure . The Multilayer Flow Modulator® ( MFM ) ( Cardiatis , Isnes , Belgium ) CE mark approval peripheral/visceral aortic aneurysm involve least one branch . The aortic MFM widely use thoracoabdominal aneurysm treatment . The clinical benefit technology suggest study treatment thoracoabdominal aneurysm , type B dissection , juxtarenal aortic aneurysm peripheral artery aneurysm ( celiac , hepatic , renal , iliac , subclavian ) . Also prospective multicenter registry peripheral visceral aneurysm prospective multicenter STRATO Trial TAAA , show good result 12-month follow-up . This MFM uncover , self-expanding wire mesh high radial force flexibility . It design modulate blood-flow dynamic relieve local peak wall shear stress ( PWSS ) , achieve stabilization aneurysm-sac pressure preserve side-branch patency . In study , MFM® safety performance evaluate use endovascular treatment chronic type B aortic dissection . Of course patient diagnose accord standard care thoughtful decision treatment/study intervention make . In case treat physician ( ) shall consider discuss alternative treatment individual patient start screen enrol study . Hence , MFM® treatment within study identify feasible desired mode treatment state-of-the-art device beneficial risk benefit profile . In general , treatment study follow routine course endovascular treatment aortic pathology , i.e . classical stenting procedure . Surgery , stent-grafts virtually always indicate dissection involve proximal aorta ( type A dissection ) complicate aortic dissection . In addition , surgery/stent-grafts may also best acute distal dissection patient congenital tissue disorder ( non-exhaustively , Marfan , Loeys-Dietz Ehler Danlos syndrome ) .</detailed_description>
