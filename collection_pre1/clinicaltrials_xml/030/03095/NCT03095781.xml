	<brief_summary>This phase Ib trial study side effect best dose Hsp90 inhibitor XL888 give together pembrolizumab treat patient advanced gastrointestinal cancer spread place body . XL888 may stop growth tumor cell block enzymes need cell growth . Monoclonal antibody , pembrolizumab , may block tumor growth different way target certain cell . Giving XL888 pembrolizumab may work well treat patient gastrointestinal cancer .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . Determine recommend phase II dose combination XL888 pembrolizumab . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . Define toxicity profile combination XL888 pembrolizumab . II . Evaluate activity combination XL888 pembrolizumab previously treat patient gastrointestinal tumor . TERTIARY OBJECTIVES : I . Evaluate effect combination immune profile serum tumor biopsy . OUTLINE : This dose-escalation study Hsp90 inhibitor XL888 . Patients receive pembrolizumab intravenously ( IV ) 30 minute day 1 XL888 orally ( PO ) day 1 , 4 , 8 , 11 , 15 , 18 . Courses repeat every 21 day absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . After completion study treatment , patient follow 30 day periodically thereafter .</detailed_description>
