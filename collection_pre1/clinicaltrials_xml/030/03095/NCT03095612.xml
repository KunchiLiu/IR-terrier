	<criteria>Patients must meet follow inclusion criterion eligible enroll study : 1 . Written inform consent accordance federal , local , institutional guideline . The patient must provide informed consent prior first screening procedure . 2 . Age ≥ 18 year 3 . Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group ( ECOG ) performance status 0 1 4 . Histologically cytologically confirm advanced ( stage 4 , accord American Joint Committee Cancer [ AJCC ] version 7.0 Staging manual ) NSCLC 5 . Molecular identification KRAS mutation ( codon 12 , 13 , 61 ) 6 . Tissue available analysis time enrollment biomarker analysis ( may obtain via biopsy prior initiation treatment , submission available archival tissue ) : 1015 slide , 5 slide 3 section per slide 7 . At least one two previous line systemic cytotoxic therapy advance NSCLC , one must platinumbased doublet therapy . Up four total previous line systemic therapy ( include immunotherapy molecularly target therapy ) 8 . Radiographic clinical disease recurrence progression last line systemic therapy 9 . Adequate hematologic function ( absolute neutrophil count [ ANC ] ≥ 1500 cells/μL ; hemoglobin ≥ 9 g/dL ; platelet ≥ 100,000/μL . Use PRBC transfusion achieve Hgb ≥9.0 mg/dL allow . 10 . Adequate renal function ( calculated creatinine clearance ≥ 30 mL/min use CockcroftGault equation ) 11 . Adequate hepatic function ( total bilirubin ≤ upper limit normal [ ULN ] , alanine aminotransferase [ ALT ] ≤ 2 × ULN aspartate aminotransferase [ AST ] ≤ 2 × ULN ) . ALT and/or AST may ≤ 5 × ULN due liver metastasis . If ALT AST &gt; 2 ≤ 5 × ULN patient liver metastasis , alkaline phosphatase must ≤ 2.5 × ULN ( unless elevate alkaline phosphatase clearly due skeletal—rather hepatic—process ; eg , normal GGT , presence multiple bone metastasis , absence bulky and/or central liver metastasis ) . Patients Gilbert 's syndrome allow total bilirubin ≤ 2 × ULN direct bilirubin ≤ ULN . 12 . Prothrombin time ( PT ) and/or international normalize ratio ( INR ) ≤ 1.5 × ULN activate partial thromboplastin time ( aPTT ) ≤ 1.5 × ULN patient anticoagulant therapy ( therapeutic PT and/or INR aPTT acceptable patient anticoagulant ) 13 . Female patient childbearing potential must agree use 2 method contraception ( include 1 highly effective 1 effective method contraception ) negative serum pregnancy test Screening . Male patient must use effective barrier method contraception sexually active female childbearing potential . For male female patient , effective method contraception must use throughout study 3 month follow last dose study treatment . Female patient childbearing potential must negative serum pregnancy test screen agree use 2 reliable method contraception throughout study 3 month last dose medication . Female patient consider NOT childbearing potential history surgical sterility ( include hysterectomy and/or bilateral oophorectomy , tubal ligation alone ) evidence postmenopausal status define follow : Natural menopause last menses &gt; 1 year ago confirm FSH blood level Radiationinduced oophorectomy last menses &gt; 1 year ago Chemotherapyinduced menopause last menses &gt; 1 year ago . Male patient partner must use 2 reliable method contraception , least one barrier method ( sexually active female childbearing potential ) . 14 . Measurable disease accord RECIST v1.1 15 . Previously treat ( surgery and/or radiation therapy ) untreated brain metastasis eligible , provided patient asymptomatic require escalate dos corticosteroid 16 . Previous treatmentassociated clinically significant toxicity resolve CTCAE grade ≤1 ( except alopecia ) baseline 17 . At least 3 week 5 halflives , whichever short , since receive systemic anticancer therapy , include investigational agent , prior start study therapy . At least 2 week since receive radiation therapy prior start study therapy Patients meeting follow exclusion criterion eligible enroll study : 1 . Patients pregnant lactate 2 . Major surgery ( exclude skin biopsy procedures insertion central venous access device ) within 2 week first dose study drug 3 . Any lifethreatening illness , medical condition organ system dysfunction , investigator 's opinion , could compromise patient 's safety 4 . Presence symptomatic brain metastasis brain metastasis require escalate dos corticosteroid control neurological symptom 5 . Other concurrent cancer ( exception nonmelanoma skin cancer lowrisk localize prostate cancer active surveillance ) 6 . Unstable cardiovascular function : Symptomatic ischemia , Uncontrolled clinically significant conduction abnormality ( i.e. , ventricular tachycardia antiarrhythmic exclude ; 1st degree AV block asymptomatic LAFB/RBBB exclude ; asymptomatic rate control atrial fibrillation exclude ) , Congestive heart failure ( CHF ) NYHA Class ≥3 , Myocardial infarction ( MI ) within 3 month 7 . Uncontrolled ( i.e. , clinically unstable ) infection require parenteral antibiotic , antiviral , antifungal within one week prior first dose ; however , prophylactic use agent acceptable even parenteral 8 . Preexisting grade 3 4 neuropathy 9 . Active Hepatitis A , B C infection 10 . Known human immunodeficiency virus ( HIV ) infection ( HIV test require part study ) 11 . Patients unable swallow tablet , patient malabsorption syndrome , GI disease GI dysfunction could interfere absorption study treatment 12 . Prior exposure docetaxel , selinexor , another selective inhibitor nuclear transport ( SINE ) compound 13 . Patients unwilling comply study protocol .</criteria>
