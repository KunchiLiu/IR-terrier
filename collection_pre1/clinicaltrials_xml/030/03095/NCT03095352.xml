	<brief_summary>This phase II multicenter study include breast cancer patient chest wall disease hormone resistant ( ER positive/PR positive/HER2 negative breast cancer progressive disease 2 prior line hormonal therapy ) triple negative ( ER negative/PR negative/HER2 negative , TNBC ) . Eighty-four patient enrol Translational Breast Cancer Research Consortium ( TBCRC ) sit randomized 2:1 receive treatment pembrolizumab carboplatin ( n=56 , Arm A ) carboplatin alone ( n=28 , Arm B ) document disease progression . Patients randomized Arm B may cross-over follow progression pembrolizumab alone ( Arm Bx ) . Patients may receive number prior line chemotherapy . Patients Arm A treat pembrolizumab 200 mg IV carboplatin AUC 5 IV every 3 week least 6 cycle follow maintenance pembrolizumab 200 mg IV every 3 week stable respond disease . Patients Arm B treat carboplatin AUC 5 IV every 3 week progression , whereupon may cross-over pembrolizumab 200 mg IV every 3 week alone ( Arm Bx ) . An interim analysis futility perform 18 patient enrolled Arm B allow early stop trial arm lack efficacy . The primary endpoint compare disease control rate 18 week treatment . Secondary endpoint include progression free survival , toxicity , overall response rate .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>There companion translational study operate concurrently study describe . In study , biomarker research perform tumor biopsy peripheral blood sample perform explore immunologic genomic mechanism action underlie treatment pembrolizumab carboplatin versus carboplatin alone . This protocol include tissue blood correlative exploratory endpoint include change tumor PD-L1 ( program death ligand 1 ) gene expression , tumor peripheral blood immune composition cytokine expression , plasma tumor DNA , circulate tumor cell , tumor MYC oncogene expression use tumor biopsy peripheral blood test treatment ; correlation marker disease control rate assess .</detailed_description>
