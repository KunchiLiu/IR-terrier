	<detailed_description>This trial involve participation patient post lung transplantation , initial post-operative period . Recruitment take place soon patient medically safe willing commence physical rehabilitation within intensive care unit . Current , standard care inpatient physical rehabilitation post lung transplant involve daily session physiotherapy duration patient 's initial inpatient stay , consist early mobility , aerobic exercise , upper low limb strengthen flexibility core muscle re-training . This trial aim assess feasibility safety twice daily physical rehabilitation session post-operative period follow lung transplantation . The content additional physical rehabilitation session differ , complement current standard care , deliver train research assistant physiotherapist . To investigator 's knowledge , current evidence support dosage intensity inpatient physical rehabilitation follow lung transplantation , unsatisfactory use evidence patient group guide practice area . To assess feasibility intensive , inpatient physical rehabilitation program post lung transplantation , investigator collect follow data : Number patient eligible study inclusion ; number patient consent ; number additional , intensive physical rehabilitation session complete ; reason non-completion session ; attrition , patient withdrawal rate . In order assess safety program , investigator also assess evidence early , acute rejection transplant lung base routine collection tissue sample , adverse event . Adverse event define event likely cause acute physical rehabilitation , include musculoskeletal injury , patient fall surgical wound breakdown . These assessment complement number physical psychological outcome measure patient statistic , include test physical capacity , participation strength , quality life questionnaire , requirement additional physical rehabilitation and/or hospital readmission within three month study commencement , discharge destination patient length stay data . Assessments complete recruitment , two week ( participant physically fit hospital discharge ) , one month finally six month . The investigator hypothesise intensive , physical rehabilitation program safe feasible implement post-operative phase post lung transplantation , participant intensive rehabilitation group active two week , one month receive standard , post lung transplant physical rehabilitation .</detailed_description>
