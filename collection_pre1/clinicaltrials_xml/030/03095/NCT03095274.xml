	<brief_summary>Well-differentiated gastroenteropancreatic lung neuroendocrine tumor generally malignancy prolong natural history . However , clinical behavior heterogeneous tumor progression observe , treatment option limit . The used therapy neuroendocrine tumor management somatostatin analog . However , even use lung carcinoid quite usual , antitumoral activity demonstrate . Tremelimumab Durvalumab combination could efficient drug improve immune system activation could obtain significantly high clinical benefit patient . Tremelimumab Durvalumab would first immune combination agent show efficacy neuroendocrine neoplasms different origin .</brief_summary>
