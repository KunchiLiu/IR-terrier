	<detailed_description>For Cohorts 1 2 , administration study drug occur within 21 day screen . Eligible subjects/patients admit clinical research unit ( CRU ) Day -1 , time assessment perform , result screen Day -1 ( inclusion/exclusion criterion , body weight , height [ screen ] , body mass index [ BMI ] , medical surgical history , physical examination , vital sign pulse oximetry , 12 lead ECG , clinical laboratory test , renal function assessment , follicle-stimulating hormone [ FSH ; screen ] pregnancy test [ female ] , urine drug abuse alcohol screen ) review confirm eligibility . For Cohorts 3 4 , administration study drug occur within 21 day screen . Eligible subjects/patients admit CRU Day 1 , time assessment perform result screen predose administration test ( inclusion/exclusion criterion , body weight , height [ screen ] , BMI , medical surgical history , physical examination , vital sign pulse oximetry , 12 lead ECG , clinical laboratory test , renal function assessment , FSH pregnancy test [ screen ] , urine drug abuse alcohol screen ) review confirm eligibility . Cohort 1 : Eligible subject receive single dose VFI follow 130 minute later 350 mL infusion 5 % albumin maximum volume 7 mL/kg 30 minute Day 1 . Subjects remain resident CRU least 24 hour VFI administration safety , PK , PD assessment . Subjects return CRU end-of-study ( EOS ) visit Day 21 ( ± 1 day ) . Cohort 2 : Eligible subject receive dose VFI follow 160 minute later single dose Iohexol Day 1 second dose VFI 24 hour follow initial dose VFI . Subjects remain resident CRU least 24 hour second VFI administration safety , PK , PD assessment . Subjects return CRU follow-up visit Days 5 ( ± 1 day ) , 9 ( ± 1 day ) , 16 ( ± 1 day ) EOS visit Day 22 ( ± 1 day ) . Cohorts 3 4 : Eligible patient receive single dose VFI follow 160 minute later single dose Iohexol Day 1 . Patients remain CRU 12-hour sample collection VFI administration safety , PK , PD assessment . . Patients stay local hotel near CRU return CRU Day 2 24-hour sample collection . Patients return CRU follow-up visit Days 4 ( ± 1 day ) , 8 ( ± 1 day ) , 15 ( ± 1 day ) EOS visit Day 21 ( ± 1 day ) .</detailed_description>
