	<detailed_description>A 52-week , randomize , crossover study design employ examine impact financial incentive MVPA among cardiac rehabilitation ( CR ) program graduate . Two experimental therapy , ( 1 ) online self-monitoring plus 'virtual reward ' ( i.e . badge ) ( ExTrack.ca ) ( 2 ) online self-monitoring plus 'financial incentive ' ( ExTracker.ca ) , administer six month , one . Study participant randomly assign ( 1:1 ) receive therapy one two order : Group A receive ExTrack.ca ( virtual reward ) six month , follow ExTracker.ca ( financial incentive ) next six month ; Group B receive financial incentive condition first , virtual reward condition second . While exposed incentive condition , participant eligible earn financial reward per day exercise track . This study design allow assessment 'real world ' uptake incentive program among CR patient , since Groups A B able earn incentive . This design also help determine incentive sustain MVPA first six month post-CR compare virtual reward condition . Finally , crossover design allow exploration incentive 'timing ' - , figure incentive effectively sustain MVPA post-CR offer immediately , versus six month graduation patient motivation tend wane . In addition track exercise session use online self-monitoring tool , participant ask record step per day , 10-minute MVPA bout per day , use StepsCount accelerometer . To check accuracy participant entry , participant ask mail-in accelerometer study mid- end-points ( 26 52 week , respectively ) . Participants also ask complete Behavioural Regulation Exercise Questionnaire ( BREQ-3 ) baseline ( T1 ) , study mid-point/crossover ( T2 ) , study end-point ( T3 ) well cardiopulmonary fitness assessment T1 T3 .</detailed_description>
