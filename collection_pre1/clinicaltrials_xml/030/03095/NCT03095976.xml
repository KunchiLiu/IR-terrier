	<detailed_description>Patients refer Graduate Periodontics Clinic Indiana University School Dentistry treatment severe chronic/aggressive periodontitis screen possible participation study . Up 20 subject accept study . Written inform consent authorization obtain participant give copy sign informed consent document . The procedure list within standard care regenerative therapy around teeth except application membrane root surface prior bone graft . No data collect study take source outside already record standard care procedure . Clinical Measurements A single calibrated examiner perform clinical baseline 6-month follow measurement . O'Leary plaque score assess . Six sit tooth probe depth ( PD ) , recession ( REC ) clinical attachment level ( CAL ) record near millimeter University North Carolina Probe ( UNC Probe ) . For Glickman grade II furcation defect , addition previous measurement , vertical probe pocket depth ( VPD ) horizontal probe depth ( HPD ) measure . Radiographic assessment perform vertical bite-wing radiograph baseline 6-month post-surgical treatment . In order maximize standardization angulation radiograph , bite registration take prior first radiograph utilized beam-guiding device . It store use post operatively . Sirona Dental Systems© 7mA 60kV 0.16s exposure time utilized radiograph . Digital # 2 film manufacture Air Techniques Inc. use radiographic assessment . Bony defect ( BD ) define coronal point periodontal ligament space show continuous width . If several bony contour could identify , apical one cross root define BD coronal one alveolar crest . If cemento-enamel junction ( CEJ ) destroy restorative treatment , margin restoration take landmark . Beam guide device use calibration measurement . The change bone fill angulation record . All surgery render Graduate Periodontics Clinic Indiana University School Dentistry . All patient treat local anesthesia ( 2 % lidocaine 1/100,000epi 4 % articaine 1/100,000epi ) . If patient willing receive surgery intravenous oral sedation , service provide base necessity . After local anesthesia , intracrevicular incision make full-thickness mucoperiosteal flap raise buccally lingually ; surgeon try preserve maximum extent marginal interdental gingival tissue obtain primary closure membrane coverage . Vertical releasing incision use necessary gain access defect debridement . The alveolar bone expose least 3 mm beyond edge defect , periosteal release incision make ensure complete membrane coverage time suture necessary . All granulation tissue remove , defect debrided , root thoroughly scale root plan hand instrument ultrasonic device . Following debridement , 17 % EDTA solution cotton pellet apply root surface 2 minute . After thorough irrigation saline , BioXclude® ( Amnion-Chorion Membrane : FDA Approved material intrabony defect ) cut two piece . The amnion-chorion BioXclude membrane regulate FDA section 361 Public Health Service Act `` Human cell , tissue , cellular tissue-based product '' ( HCT/P ) . The FDA require pre-market approval product like would drug , biologics device . Therefore , product associate `` investigational device exemption '' ( IDE ) number . The FDA view use amnion chorion wound cover aid healing tissue throughout body `` homologous use '' . One go root surface , coronal portion membrane &gt; 3mm coronal CEJ . Once applied membrane , one drop saline apply obtain good adaptation membrane root surface . Bone substitute 0.5cc ( Particle size 0.25-0.5mm Corticocancellous , Maxxeus® ) hydrate least 10min prior application , apply defect . The bone particles exceed edge defect order avoid fill . Following bone graft deliver defect . The coronal portion excessive membrane fold graft material . The BioXclude membrane utilized graft , always place coronal interproximal bone crest completely cover defect extend 2 3 mm beyond residual bone . No suture , pin , tack use membrane fixation stabilization . The orientation membrane matter . Vertical horizontal mattress suture 5-0 Proline ( Monofilament/Nylon ) place interproximal tissue obtain primary closure much possible . Intra-surgical Clinical Measurements . Intrabony defect : defect morphology measure ( 1 wall , 2 wall and/or combination ) deepest aspect defect coronal side edge defect . Furcation defect : 1 ) Cementoenamel junction roof furcation ( CEJ-ROF ) ; 2 ) roof furcation base defect ( ROF-BOD ) ; 3 ) roof furcation crest bone furcation entrance ( ROF-COB ) ; 4 ) crest bone base defect ( COB-BOD ) ; 5 ) root divergence crest bone ( RDCB ) ; 6 ) horizontal extent ( base ) defect level furcation entrance ( HBODF ) ; 7 ) horizontal extent ( base ) defect level crest bone ( HBOD-C ) ; 8 ) cemento-enamel junction interproximal crest bone ( CEJ-INTPRX ) All patient receive antibiotic ( 875mg amoxicillin twice /day ) one week . If participant allergic amoxicillin , clindamycin ( 150mg twice/day ) one week prescribe . Analgesics ( 600mg ibuprofen three times/day ) prescribe need discomfort . Pt see one , two four week post-operative follow . Patients advise rinse twice daily 0.12 % chlorhexidine 2 week surgery . Patients instruct refrain brushing teeth surgical area 2 week . After , instruct initiate brushing extra-soft toothbrush . Subjects recall 4-week interval 4weeks surgical procedure period 6 month plaque scoring , oral hygiene instruction , professional prophylaxis need . No subgingival probe instrumentation perform experimental site 6-month follow-up appointment .</detailed_description>
