	<brief_summary>In research study researcher want learn effect ( good bad ) study drug selumetinib participant neurofibromatosis type II ( NF2 ) relate tumor . The researcher ask patient NF2 relate tumor study , hear decrease and/or NF2 relate tumor start grow . The goal study : - Determine selumetinib stop NF2 related tumor grow - Measure change hear receive selumetinib 6 month . - Determine selumetinib improve participant feel ( physically emotionally ) participant perform daily activity . - Examine tumor tissue , available , laboratory see NF2 related tumor target selumetinib .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Trial Selumetinib Patients With Neurofibromatosis Type II Related Tumors</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This Phase 2 trial ass hear response rate radiographic response VS child young adult NF2 treat selumetinib . Dosing base age : For patient NF2 3 &lt; 18 year age , dose base BSA . Dosing base BSA calculate begin course . For patient NF2 ≥ 18 45 year age , dose standard adult dose 75 mg BID . Selumetinib take orally twice day continuously . One course equivalent 28 day . Therapy may continue two year ( 26 course ) absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . There two treatment stratum . Stratum 1 patient target vestibular schwannoma cause hearing loss . Stratum 2 reserve patient exhibit growth tumor ( ) besides vestibular schwannoma therefore eligible stratum 1 .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Patients must confirm diagnosis neurofibromatosis 2 fulfilling National Institute Health ( NIH ) criteria Manchester criterion , detection causative mutation NF2 gene . The NIH criterion include presence : Bilateral vestibular schwannomas , OR Firstdegree relative NF2 EITHER unilateral eighth nerve mass OR two follow : neurofibroma , meningioma , glioma , schwannoma , juvenile posterior subcapsular lenticular opacity . The Manchester criterion include presence : Bilateral vestibular schwannomas , OR Firstdegree relative NF2 EITHER unilateral eighth nerve mass OR two follow : neurofibroma , meningioma , glioma , schwannoma , juvenile posterior subcapsular lenticular opacity , OR Unilateral vestibular schwannoma AND two : neurofibroma , meningioma , glioma , schwannoma , juvenile posterior subcapsular lenticular opacity , OR Multiple meningioma ( two ) AND unilateral vestibular schwannoma OR two : schwannoma , glioma , neurofibroma , cataract . Patients need histologic diagnosis order start therapy must measurable disease ( 2 dimension ) MRI scan eligible . For Stratum 1 : Patients must target VS follow quality : Associated word recognition score &lt; 85 % &gt; 0 % AND Documented progression define : Either progressive hearing loss progressive tumor growth last 18 month define ≥ 20 % increase volume . For Stratum 2 : Patients must meet eligibility criterion state Stratum 1 target lesion exhibit progression . Progression define : ≥ 25 % increase sum product perpendicular diameter lesion precede 12 month ; new lesion ; clinical deterioration relate disease . Patients must able swallow capsule Age : Patients must ≥ 3 year ≤ 45 year age start treatment Prior Therapy Since standard effective chemotherapy patient NF2 vestibular schwannomas , meningioma , ependymomas patient may treat trial without receive prior medical therapy direct VS , meningioma , ependymomas . Since selumetinib expect cause substantial myelosuppression , limit number prior myelosuppressive regimen NF2 patient . Patients must fully recover acute toxic effect prior chemotherapy , immunotherapy , biologic therapy radiotherapy prior enter study except alopecia . Myelosuppressive chemotherapy : Patients must receive last dose know myelosuppressive anticancer chemotherapy least three week prior study registration least six week nitrosourea . Biologic agent : Patient must receive last dose biologic agent ≥ 7 day prior study registration . For biologic agent prolonged halflife , least three halflives must elapse prior registration Monoclonal antibody treatment : At least three halflives must elapse prior registration Corticosteroids : Patients receive dexamethasone corticosteroid must stable decrease dose least 1 week prior registration . It recommend patient steroid therapy receive least dose control neurologic symptom Prior radiotherapy XRT : ≥ 6 month must elapse prior XRT vestibular schwannoma tumor . Stem Cell Transplant Rescue without TBI : No evidence active graft vs. host disease ≥ 3 month must elapse since transplant . Performance Status : Karnofsky ≥ 60 % patient &gt; 16 year age Lansky ≥ 60 patient ≤ 16 year age . Organ Function Requirements Adequate Bone Marrow Function Defined : Peripheral absolute neutrophil count ( ANC ) ≥ 1000/μL Platelet count ≥ 100,000/μL ( transfusion independent , define receive platelet transfusion within 7 day period prior registration ) Hemoglobin ≥ 9 g/dL ( may receive RBC transfusion ) Adequate Renal Function Defined : Creatinine clearance radioisotope GFR ≥ 70ml/min/1.73 m2 A serum creatinine base age/gender Adequate Liver Function Defined : Bilirubin ( sum conjugate + unconjugated ) ≤ 1.5 x upper limit normal ( ULN ) age AST ( SGOT ) /ALT ( SGPT ) &lt; 3 X institutional upper limit normal age Central Nervous System Function : Patients seizure disorder may enrol receive nonenzyme induce anticonvulsant seizure well control . Cardiac Function Adequate cardiac function define : LVEF ≥50 % ECHO QTc interval ≤450 msec EKG Hypertension Patients , 3 &lt; 18 year age must blood pressure ≤ 95th percentile age , height gender time registration . Patients ≥18 year age must blood pressure &lt; 140/90 mm Hg time registration . Patients may blood pressure medication provide contraindicated list medication adjust previous 3 month . Growth factor : All colony form growth factor ( ) discontinue least one week prior registration ( filgrastim , sargramostim , erythropoietin ) . For patient long acting growth factor , interval two week . Inclusion Women Minorities Both male female race ethnic group eligible study . Informed Consent : All patient and/or parent legal guardian must sign write informed consent . Assent , appropriate , obtain accord institutional guideline . Pregnant breastfeed woman enter study due risk fetal teratogenic adverse event see animal/human study . The effect selumetinib develop human fetus unknown . For reason , woman childbearing potential men must agree use adequate contraception ( hormonal barrier method birth control ; abstinence ) prior study entry duration study participation , four week dose selumetinib cease . The selumetinib manufacturer recommend adequate contraception male patient use 16 week postlast dose due sperm life cycle . Women childbearing potential must negative pregnancy test prior study registration . Should woman become pregnant suspect pregnant partner participate study , inform treat physician immediately . Note : Female subject consider `` childbearing potential '' anatomically physiologically capable become pregnant . For girl normal reproductive potential , possibility become pregnant require ovulatory menstrual cycle heterosexual intercourse . Although time ovulation relative menarche variable , consistent evidence girl may ovulatory cycle prior menarche , , healthy population , regular ovulation may begin within month menarche . Therefore , menarche feasible clinical indicator biological potential pregnancy . Patients clinically significant unrelated systemic illness ( serious infection significant cardiac , pulmonary , hepatic organ dysfunction ) likely interfere study procedure result Patients currently receive another investigational drug within 4 week prior first dose study treatment , within period investigational drug systemic anticancer treatment clear body ( e.g . period 5 'halflives ' ) , whichever appropriate judge investigator eligible . Patients take another BRAF inhibitor Vemurafenib Dabrafenib prior study registration eligible . Prior treatment selumetinib another MEK inhibitor allow . Patients QTc interval &gt; 450 msec Patients require enzyme inducing anticonvulsant control seizures . Anticoagulation : Patients receive coumadin eligible must PT INR monitor prior 4 week course . Patients opinion investigator may able comply safety monitoring requirement study eligible . The following cardiac condition : a. Uncontrolled hypertension adult ( BP ≥ 140/90 mmHg despite medical therapy ) b . Acute coronary syndrome within 6 month prior start treatment c. Uncontrolled Angina Canadian Cardiovascular Society grade IIIV despite medical therapy ( Appendix H ) d.
