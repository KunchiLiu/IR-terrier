	<brief_summary>Video capsule endoscopy ( VCE ) recommend gold standard small bowel exploration . The efficiency axial-viewing ( Given , Imaging ) widely report . The CapsoCam capsule ( Capsovision , California , USA ) four camera allow exploration small bowel 360 degree lateral viewing . Celiac disease common autoimmune enteropathy Western country , usually associate good response gluten free diet excellent prognosis . However , minority patient develop complication disease , refractory celiac disease , ulcerative jejunoileitis neoplastic complication adenocarcinoma small bowel enteropathy associate T cell lymphoma . In recent year , detection small bowel lesion dramatically improve thank availability capsule endoscopy exploration . The aim study evaluate detection rate diagnostic concordance axial view capsule CapsoCam capsule patient .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Comparison Between Axial- Lateral-viewing Capsule Endoscopy Celiac Disease</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The study involve 25 patient suspect complicated celiac disease , clinical reason refer evaluation small intestine mean capsule endoscopic order screen/identify complication . Furthermore , patient regular follow-up know complication celiac disease ( i.e . refractory celiac disease , ulcerative jejunoileitis ) also enrol . Patients reffered Center Prevention Diagnosis celiac disease research Hospital `` Fondazione CÃ  Granda Ospedale Maggiore Policlinico '' Milan prospectively evaluate consecutively enrol study . In agreement international Guidelines , diagnosis celiac disease base Presence atrophy duodenal biopsy sampling ( Marsh-Oberhuber type 3 ) positive serology genetic compatibility ( case seronegative patient diagnosis ) . Patients high risk celiac disease complication define - subject older 50 year time celiac disease diagnosis - subject persistence / recurrence gastrointestinal symptom least 6 month gluten-free diet - subject report poor compliance gluten-free diet - subject alarm sign diagnosis follow-up . All enrol patient undergo examination small bowel mean endoscopic capsule device ( axial-view PillCam SB3 lateral-view CapsoCam ) day approximately 3 hour interval one another , accord protocol already validate term security study . The order administration two different capsule , determine specific randomization sequence . At end examination , record data capsule acquire accord follow step : - For axial-view capsule : removal recorder 10 hour record and/or checking capsule reach cecum . The patient also instruct retrieve capsule stool hour / day follow examination per standard protocol . - For lateral-view capsule , patient give specific kit retrieval conservation . The recorded data download retrieval capsule . The 50 video review three expert operator ( L.E. , F.B . G.E.T . ) , blind randomize order . The operator evaluate number lesion detect two different type capsule system ( Primary endpoint ) mean extension lesion detect , express percentage total transit time capsule small intestine ( Secondary endpoint )</detailed_description>
