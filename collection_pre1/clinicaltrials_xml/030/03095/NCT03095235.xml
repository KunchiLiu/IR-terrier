	<brief_summary>Corneal ectasia characterize irregularity thin cornea , cause cornea bulge forward cause distort vision impaired visual acuity . Corneal ectasia complication refractive ( LASIK ) surgery . It also primary problem keratoconus , gradually progressive inherit condition typically manifest young adulthood , commonly woman . Treatment approach stabilize cornea 's shape include rigid contact lens , surgical implantation stiff plastic intrastromal corneal ring segment , collagen cross-linking procedure , severe case , cornea transplantation . The collagen cross-linking procedure involve topical application concentrate riboflavin ( vitamin B2 ) solution corneal epithelium scrap , follow ultraviolet ( UV ) light exposure . UV light stimulates riboflavin form new bond ( cross link ) cornea 's connective tissue , give cornea additional strength maintain shape prevent need transplantation . The cost one treatment use system $ 2,500 $ 3,500 . A small prospective study include 7 patient keratoconus start trial oral riboflavin 15 minute natural sunlight exposure daily . These patient report adverse effect preliminary result show corneal stabilization and/or corneal flatten 7 patient It hypothesize dietary riboflavin natural sunlight effective corneal crosslinking currently FDA approve Avedro therapy . If clinical study confirm investigator ' early observation benefit approach , couple animal study document corneal cross-linking , investigator data pursue funding large clinical animal study . This potential save million dollar health care cost ease burden treatment patient require therapy induce corneal cross-linking stabilize cornea 's shape .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Corneal ectasia complication refractive ( LASIK ) surgery well keratoconus slowly progressive condition result high patient morbidity . Treatment option aim stabilize shape cornea use rigid contact lens , surgical insertion stiff plastic intrastromal ring , corneal cross link , ultimately corneal transplant severe patient . The recently FDA approve `` Dresden Protocol '' involve painful cornea scrap follow application concentrate Riboflavin , follow immediate collagen cross link UV light exposure result shorten thicken collagen fibril , therefore strong , stiff cornea . Avedro demonstrate average cornea flattening ( K max reduction ) 1.4 diopter 1.7diopters two different study . The current cost Avedro therapy $ 2500 - $ 3500 per treatment . This consider experimental time therefore cover insurance.To spare patient severe pain involved current procedure , avoid high cost ( Avedro cover medical insurance ) , investigator start 7 patient keratoconus 2011-2015 private practice Seattle trial oral riboflavin ( 100 mg 400 mg daily ) 15 minute sunlight exposure daily . No adverse effect ever report high-dose dietary riboflavin supplement . The result preliminary trial remarkable . During follow-up 6 month 5 year , 7 patient corneal stabilization and/or corneal flattening . One patient experience flatten cornea 1.5 Diopters , comparable best result Avedro system . A limited animal study currently underway document corneal cross-linking occurs response dietary riboflavin UV exposure sun . This clinical study would expand promise preliminary finding large sample size . This potential save million dollar health care cost ease burden treatment patient require therapy induce corneal cross-linking stabilize cornea 's shape .</detailed_description>
