	<detailed_description>Microdialysis assessment cerebral energy state cardiac arrest cardiopulmonary resuscitation human In comatose patient resuscitate hospital cardiac arrest ( OHCA ) , neurological injury remain leading cause death . The in-hospital mortality report 30-50 % , total mortality , although improve substantially last decade , remain significant , country 90 % . The brain patient resuscitate cardiac arrest ( CA ) may suffer ischemia spontaneous circulation re-established , subsequent reperfusion may cause damage . Brain ischemia reperfusion injury lead tissue degeneration loss neurological function , extent dependent duration density insult . Temperature control Targeted Temperature Management ( TTM ) target 33-36°C may mitigate damage recommend current international guideline . However , manage post cardiac arrest patient much complicate TTM alone , blood pressure measurement mechanical ventilation part post resuscitation care emphasize . An adequate blood pressure must maintain post-cardiac arrest patient . Episodes hypotension cause secondary injury , addition initial insult incur arrest brain organ . Mean arterial blood pressure ( MAP ) 65 mmHg reverse acute shock state , may preferably 80 100 mmHg optimize cerebral perfusion . When determine blood pressure goal , clinician must balance metabolic need ischemic brain potential overstressing decompensated heart . Cerebral autoregulation often impaired cardiac arrest , brain perfusion decline MAP fall 80 100 mmHg . Thus , maintain adequate MAP help avoid brain injury . However , blood pressure goal investigate prospective clinical trial , remain base observational data extrapolation experimental data . While experimental study suggest high mean blood pressure target need maintain cerebral blood flow , registry consecutive clinical case undergo post resuscitation care suggest low blood pressure target use clinical practice . But data RCT´s address specific target post resuscitation care perform . The current trial address strategy neuroprotection use design two different target blood pressure level . Intervention : 1:1 randomization : `` Normal MAP '' ( approximately 65 mmHg ) vs. `` high MAP '' ( approximately 75 mmHg ) Markers measure global cerebral ischemia cause cardiac arrest consecutive resuscitation , reflect metabolic change successful resuscitation urgently need enable personalized resuscitation post resuscitation care . It technically simple feasible place microdialysis catheter jugular bulb monitor biochemical variable related cerebral energy metabolism bedside . The LP ratio obtain microdialysis cerebral venous blood may sensitive indicator impend cerebral damage might play critical role detect early response post resuscitation care . Aim study investigate global cerebral metabolic change CA post-resuscitation care . Aim : The study aim ( I ) investigate whether LP ratio obtain microdialysis ( MD ) cerebral venous outflow reflect derangement global cerebral energy state peri-cardiac arrest period ( II ) investigate correlation LP ratio neurological outcome among patient cardiac arrest ( III ) investigate correlation LP ratio randomize blood pressure target . Design : Single center randomize trial allocation 80 comatose out-of-hospital cardiac arrest patient undergoing TTM , normal high blood pressure target ICU stay . Secondary descriptive prospective cohorte study , measure LP ratio obtain microdialysis ( MD ) cerebral venous outflow , peri-cardiac arrest period . Primary outcome : Analysis compare two target blood pressure group respect LP ratio . Secondary outcome : Cerebral Performance Category ( CPC ) discharge hospital , time death , daily cumulate vasopressor requirement ICU stay need combination vasopressor inotropic agent mechanical circulatory support . All end-points correlate randomized blood pressure group . A stratified analysis follow pre-defined design variable also perform : sex , age median , median time ROSC , know hypertension , know COPD , shockable primary rhythm . Method : Interventions consider emergency procedure study blood pressure measurement use study blood pressure module commence soon possible sustain ROSC , screen randomisation . Study target blood pressure blind . Patients mechanically ventilate , sedate ( propofol/fentanyl ) necessary paralyse neuromuscular block agent reduce shiver subsequent heat-generation energy consumption . The core body temperature set quickly possible predefined target temperature , accord intervention allocation , 4°C intravenous solution , commercially available cool device discretion treat physician . The target core temperature maintain 24 h. After maintenance period core temperature gradually raise normothermia 37°C rewarming rate 0.5°C/hour . Body temperature maintain normothermia 37 ±0.5°C long patient comatose 72 hour sustain ROSC treatment group , use pharmacological treatment temperature management system applicable . The study target low-normal paO2 9.5 kPa TTM mechanical ventilation need . The target PaO2 reach adjust FiO2 PEEP ventilator long patient control ventilation . Patients ventilation adjust , target normocapnia paCO2 4,5 - 6,0 patient . Serial arterial blood gas analysis perform open label use commercially available equipment adjust 37 °C ( alpha-stat ) . MD catheter ( CMA 67 , MDialysis AB , Stockholm , Sweden ) place retrograde direction jugular bulb . A second identical MD catheter insert one brachial artery . Both catheter insert peripheral intravenous 17 GA cannula use ultrasound guidance . The positioning catheter jugular bulb inlet common facial vein verify lateral neck radiograph accord accepted principle . MD catheter perfuse MD pump ( CMA 106 , MDialysis AB , Stockholm , Sweden ) 0.3 μL/min . The perfusates collect microvials analyze every one hour 72 hour enzymatic photometric technique display bedside ( Iscus , Mdialysis AB , Stockholm , Sweden ) . The analysis include variable routinely monitor intracerebral microdialysis : glucose , pyruvate , lactate , glutamate glycerol . Neurological status , accord CPC-scale , survival evaluate every day intensive care unit and/or day 1 , 2 , 3 , 4 , 5 , 6 , 7 hospital ( include local hospital ) discharge , whichever come first . The Danish Regional Committee Health Research Ethics approve study . Trial registration : S-20150173 HLP . Perspectives The prognosis patient admit comatose state follow successful resuscitation cardiac arrest remain uncertain . Although introduction therapeutic hypothermia ( TH ) , target temperature management ( TTM ) improvements post-resuscitation care significantly increase number patient discharge home minimal brain damage , short-term assessment neurological outcome remain challenge . The need early accurate prognostic predictor crucial , especially since sedation TH/TTM may alter neurological examination delay recovery motor response several day . The development additional tool , include electrophysiological examination ( electroencephalography somatosensory evoke potential ) , neuroimaging chemical biomarkers , may help evaluate extent brain injury patient . Accurate prognostication comatose patient treat TH/TTM obtain 72 96 hour CA require multimodal approach . Markers measure cerebral ischemia cause cardiac arrest consecutive resuscitation , reflect metabolic change successful resuscitation urgently need enable personalized resuscitation post resuscitation care . The LP ratio obtain microdialysis cerebral venous blood may play critical role detect early response post resuscitation care , may predict hospital long term prognosis patient affect brain injury CA . During peri-cardiac arrest period LP ratio obtain microdialysis cerebral venous outflow may reflect derangement global cerebral energy state . The LP ratio obtain microdialysis cerebral venous blood human may sensitive indicator impend cerebral damage among patient cardiac arrest . Further , study investigates correlation LP ratio randomize blood pressure target . In future might optimize individualize management post cardiac arrest patient .</detailed_description>
