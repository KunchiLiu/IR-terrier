	<brief_summary>The inclusion short period apnea ( several second ) exercise ( i.e . dynamic apnea ) induce significant decrease blood oxygenation muscle tissue . To date , immediate effect ( `` acute apnea '' ) decrease quantity oxygen available muscle brain level poorly understood . Moreover , physical training short period apnea ( `` chronic apnea '' ) would include could lead physiological adaptation improvement physical performance similar obtain altitude training . The purpose study evaluate effect acute dynamic apnea metabolism .</brief_summary>
