	<brief_summary>Currently , study address optimum dosage lidocaine surgical procedure . Lidocaine local anesthetic inject induce anesthesia . Improper inefficient pain treatment lead longer hospital stay , adverse side effect nausea vomit . Opioids primary drug treat moderate severe pain , also responsible nausea side effect . Lidocaine show opioid sparing effect ; mean less opioid use necessary pain relief . In study , conduct clinical trial ass difference different lidocaine dosage schedule determine optimum dosage bring maximum pain relief minimize adverse side effect patient stay . A large benefit use lidocaine document opioid sparing allow minimal drug treatment .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Intravenous Lidocaine Post-Operative Pain Control Patients Undergoing Bariatric Bowel Surgery</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Lidocaine first discover systematic investigation Institute Chemistry Stockholm . In early 1940s , Nils Lofgren discover lidocaine potent anesthetic , initially label LL30 . It first clinically tested 1994 , stand appraisal reliable highly efficient local anesthetic . One systematic review find , depend duration infusion lidocaine , significantly different pain rating result . Similarly , review find low moderate evidence effect intravenous lidocaine pain rest one major predefined outcomes . Interestingly , true large variation bolus dos ( 1 3mg/kg ) continuous infusion regime ( 1.5 5 mg/kg/h ) . The variation dose impacted pain ; early intermediate , postoperative ileus , time first flatus , time first bowel movements/sounds . One study base medication protocol dose body weight [ ideal body weight ( IBW ) + 0.4 x ( actual body weight-IBW ) . Besides important improvement overall quality recovery , subject improvement physical comfort , pain , physical independence subcomponents quality recovery score . Additionally , opioid spar effect observe patient undergo laparoscopic bariatric surgery , make especially critical due limit respiratory reserve bariatric population . Another study assign subject experimental group IV infusion 2mg/kg per hour lidocaine , maintain 15 30 minute skin closure . The study find similar positive effect , improve postoperative analgesia , reduce postoperative opioid requirement , accelerate return first flatus . Specifically , investigation find result similar previous investigation long infusion time across variety surgical procedure . Based , call research evaluate optimum dosage lidocaine infusion bariatric population undergo major surgery . Not wide variety positive effect lidocaine need investigate , need precision sensitivity dose regime bariatric population susceptible adverse effect . It therefore interest find optimal dosage schedule order provide anesthesiologist standard maximizes opioid spar effect , whilst minimize patient pain , hospital stay , well nausea vomit . Given complexity propose randomized-controlled trial , well time financial limitation , pilot study deem necessary find feasibility safety compare different dosing schedule , rate patient recruitment , fund necessity , need additional personnel .</detailed_description>
