	<detailed_description>Endometrial cancer ( EC ) fifth commonly diagnose malignant neoplasm among woman worldwide . The incidence EC high high-income country , increase low- middle-income country . For example , Brazil EC consider sixth frequent tumor among woman , 6,950 new case estimate occur 2016 . EC classify two subtypes tumor ( Type I Type II ) , different clinicopathological feature prognosis . Type I , endometrioid endometrial carcinoma ( EEC ) , frequent subtype often associate characteristic related good prognosis , low-grade , superficial myometrial invasion early stage disease . The main risk factor EC include presence comorbidities , diabetes mellitus hypertension , well condition associate prolonged exposure estrogen . These condition : chronic anovulation , hormone replacement therapy , early menarche / late menopause , nulliparity , obesity . Obesity recognize major risk factor many cancer , include endometrial adenocarcinoma . Multiple mechanisms related obesity probably involved carcinogenesis endometrial tumor . Among obese woman postmenopausal period , increase bioavailable circulate estrogen . These estrogens come aromatization androgen adipose tissue increase circulate estrogen secondary reduce synthesis sex hormone bind globulin ( SHBG ) liver . Insulin resistance , hyperinsulinemia , increase secretion adipocytokines pro-inflammatory cytokine may also play role carcinogenesis EC . To date , study design evaluate association obesity risk endometrial cancer , without focus outcome ( e.g. , overall survival disease-free survival ) . A recent systematic review show controversial finding obesity prognostic factor endometrial cancer patient . The included study review investigate outcome classify accord histopathology . This fact may bias final result study obesity specifically associate risk development EC Type I ( ECC ) . Although incidence EC remarkable , insufficient data address impact obesity EC outcome . Since 70 % woman diagnose EEC obese , consequence obesity-related disease take account order implement strategy improve survival outcome among woman . Sedentary lifestyle physical inactivity also seem relevant , identified predictor poor prognosis patient different type cancer . Additionally , cancer survivor remain physically active usually good control body weight comorbidities . Consequently , patient high quality life sedentary lifestyle . However , role lifestyle ( include eat social habit physical activity ) endometrial cancer prognosis assess prospectively yet . Studies assess nutritional status lifestyle EC diagnosis may elucidate whether factor influence clinical outcome , include long-term survival .</detailed_description>
