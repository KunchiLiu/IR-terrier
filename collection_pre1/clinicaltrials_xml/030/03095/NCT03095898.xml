	<detailed_description>Aim study The objective study compare effectiveness acupuncture versus Sham acupuncture reduce patient 's discomfort pain colonoscopy standard sedation protocol . This objectively measure reduction amount analgesia use well time spent recovery room . Background significance Colonoscopy invasive procedure , know uncomfortable patient , necessitate use sedative drug . The standard practice institution use conscious sedation midazolam fentanyl achieve satisfactory level relaxation , cooperation , amnesia procedure . Patients undergo colonoscopy might experience abdominal cramp , pain distension necessitate increase sedation use time , addition abort procedure rare case . Previous study report use sedative analgesic drug frequently prolongs recovery room observation bring rare well-known adverse event like hypotension respiratory compromise . To note former complication conscious sedation dependent dose drug use . Acupuncture form alternative medicine use worldwide different indication , mainly pain management . It rely stimulation specific acupuncture point along skin body use thin needle . It base belief `` life force '' circulates within body line call meridian . Each meridian correspond internal organ . Only publication exist respect role acupuncture sedation gastrointestinal procedure . These study show stimulation LI4 , S36 , SP6 SP9 acupuncture point decrease demand sedative drug , well gastrointestinal discomfort pain electrically stimulating bilateral active points.Sham acupuncture hand use analogous stimulation inactive symmetrical point near active point . A similar study find decrease frequency intensity post-procedural abdominal pain , abdominal distension , along short duration recovery room , however , study n't assess decrease sedation requirement different group . Another study show time pas sigmoid splenic flexure time reach cecum significantly short acupuncture group compare control group . The researcher hypothesize `` true '' acupuncture sham acupuncture analgesic sedative effect lead reduction dosage midazolam fentanyl need satisfactory sedation colonoscopy . Research design method : This study design single center , randomize , sham control trial . To test hypothesis researcher compare three group . Group 1 receive true-acupuncture traditional acupuncture point P6 , SP9 , ST36 , LI4 ; group 2 get sham-acupuncture group 3 control group without acupuncture needle insertion . All three group receive standard sedation midazolam/fentanyl standard practice institution . To note , sedation requirement dependent patient physician preference . The endoscopist perform procedure blind randomization . The acupuncture perform qualified staff physician , patient enrol group A acupuncture bilaterally upper arm low leg per follow point : 1 . LI4 ( Hegu , 4th point Large Intestine channel ) , dorsum hand , first second metacarpal bone , midpoint second metacarpal bone , close radial border . 2 . S36 ( Zusanli , 36th point Stomach channel ) , knee , one-finger breadth lateral anterior crest tibia , three-finger breadth inferior hollow form patella , lateral patellar ligament knee flex . 3 . SP9 ( Yinlingquan , 9th point Spleen channel ) , medial side lower leg , depression angle form medial condyle tibia posterior border tibia . 4 . P6 ( Nei Guan , 6th point pericardium channel ) locate three finger breadth wrist inner forearm two tendon . I . Patient Recruitment This study take place endoscopy unit American University Beirut Medical center . Eligible patient participation clinical trial plan undergo elective diagnostic therapeutic colonoscopy midazolam/fentanyl sedation , age 18 year , ASA ( American Society Anaesthesiology ) classification I-III , give write informed consent . After check inclusion exclusion criterion , participant approach clinic primary physician someone responsible clinical care inform study . After gain participant 's permission participate study , participant approach Mrs. Ghada Shami , Registered Nurse responsible explain preparation colonoscopy screen interested patient . She notify divisional research fellow , Dr Mahmoud Rahal explain study concept detail patient private set clinic area . II- Primary endpoint : Primary endpoint study use dosage midazolam , combination fentanyl . III- Secondary endpoint : Secondary endpoint patient ' gastroenterologist ' satisfaction procedure , determine visual analog scale , 0 10 . The researcher also compare time need complete procedure time spent recovery room , three group . V- Study Plan After patient sign informed consent form , randomization perform permuted block randomization . Allocation treatment group perform seal consecutively numbered envelope . One experience qualified staff acupuncturist ( Dr Fadila Nagi ) perform intervention preparation room . Needles insert disposable single use . The participant connect portable electro-stimulator leave place 20 min . The intervention electroacupuncture stop 20 min colonoscopy start afterwards . In group A , true acupuncture group , needle place follow point , consider relevant - sedation abdominal distension : Pericardium 6 ( P6 ) , Spleen 9 ( SP9 ) , Stomach 36 ( ST36 ) , Large intestine 4 ( LI4 ) . In group B , patient receive Sham-acupuncture sort needle . The needle place 2-3 cm distal lateral use acupoints ( P6 , ST36 , LI4 ) location know acupuncture point . The electrostimulator use study `` AS SUPER 4 digital '' make Germany frequency 2 Hz , pulse width 210 microsecond alternate 15 Hz , pulse width 120 microsecond . Aiming reach intensity 3 mA . In group C , control group , patient needle insert . Patients monitor use SpO2 , heart rate noninvasive blood pressure measurement usually perform prior , colonoscopy . The risk associate study minimal . The needle use single use , associate infectious risk ; however , participant might experience minimal pain small hematoma acupuncture needle insertion site patient might experience vasovagal reaction needle insertion . The risk concern electrical stimulation acupuncture needle limit mildly uncomfortable muscle twitch around site needle insertion level hand legs . If acupuncture prove able reduce require amount sedative drug employ colonoscopy , translate well patient tolerance procedure potentially less associated cardio-vascular pulmonary side effect . VI-Sample size calculation data analysis : The sample size calculation fact do determine median dos Midazolam fentanyl administer endoscopy unit 3 month period . Dr Hani Tami statistician consult . The average fentanyl dose 73 , standard deviation 24 . Accordingly , detect 20 % reduction ( 15 unit ) , standard deviation 24 , 42 patient need group ( total multiply 3 ) , detect difference , 80 % power 0.05 error . As midazolam , average 4.3 standard deviation 1.6 , accordingly , 55 patient group need detect 20 % reduction , total 165 patient need . The sample size increase 180 group allow possible dropout . VII-Funding Study Dr. Fady Daniel generously provide acupuncture needle need study .</detailed_description>
