	<brief_title>Cold Induced Activation Brown Adipose Tissue Winter Swimmers</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The field human brown adipose tissue ( BAT ) research focus activation BAT mean manipulate energy expenditure potentially anti-obesity anti-diabetic property tissue . This well establish rodent study explain due specific brown fat uncouple protein 1 ( UCP1 ) . Despite increase evidence indicate metabolic regulatory role BAT human , BAT activation/recruitment fully understood . Cold induce brown fat activity measure skin temperature measure mean infra-red thermography image skin temperature . 20 healthy male winter swimmer 15 healthy male non-winter swimmer ( control ) include study .</detailed_description>
