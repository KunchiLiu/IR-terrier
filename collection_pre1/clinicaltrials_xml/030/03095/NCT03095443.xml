	<brief_title>Decreasing Delirium Through Music</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Over 1 million adult admit intensive care unit place mechanical ventilation annual basis . Intravenous sedative analgesic commonly administer patient reduce pain anxiety . While recent reduction benzodiazepine usage help reduce ICU-related acute brain dysfunction ( delirium ) , 80 % ventilated patient still develop acute brain failure . This characterized disturbance consciousness reduce ability focus , sustain shift attention , occur short period time fluctuating course day . Acute brain dysfunction short-term long-term health impact . It associate increased hospital length stay , increase in-hospital mortality post-discharge mortality well increase health-care cost . Patients experience delirium great risk post-discharge institutionalization newly acquire cognitive impairment similar dementia . Despite prevalence morbidity associate delirium , scarcity effective pharmacological non-pharmacological intervention prevent treat condition . While music therapy show reduce anxiety stress cancer dementia patient , study perform outside intensive care unit . It hypothesize music lower inflammatory mediator cytokine cortisol . Delirium pathophysiology similar anxiety strong inflammatory component excess pro-inflammatory cytokine interleukins 1 , 6 , 8 . Given beneficial effect music reduce inflammatory mediator , stand reason intervention beneficial impact reduce delirium . The investigator propose randomize , three-group ( personalized music intervention versus generic music intervention versus attention control ) trial test feasibility efficacy music therapy reduce delirium incidence , duration , severity among critically ill patient ICU . Our study focus effect music therapy incidence severity delirium intensive care unit large urban academic health center . The investigator hypothesize music therapy lead reduce level anxiety , delirium need sedate medication , lead short hospital stay .</detailed_description>
