	<brief_summary>Purpose article : aim present study detect difference presence body shadow virtual reality ( VR ) training BTS NIRVANA ( BTsN ) . Materials method : In pilot study , enrol 20 post-stroke rehabilitation inpatient , underwent neurocognitive-rehabilitative training consist 24 session ( three time week 8 week ) BTsN . All patient randomize two group : Semi-immersive virtual training ( S-IVTSgroup ) without ( S-IVTgroup ) body shadow . Each participant evaluate ( T0 ) , immediately ( T1 ) end train skilled neuropsychologist administration complete battery , skilled neurologist assess motor function .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>In pilot study , enrol 20 post-stroke rehabilitation inpatient , attend Laboratory Robotic Cognitive Rehabilitation IRCCS Neurolesi Messina June 2016 January 2017 . The inclusion criterion : ischemic hemorrhagic stroke chronic phase ( i.e. , least 6 month acute neurological event ) ; inability stand independently one minute ; ability sit least 20 minute ( include least one minute without support ) ; presence moderate mild cognitive impairment ( Mini-Mental State Examination 10 23 ) ; absence disable sensory alteration , severe psychiatric medical illness . The study approve Local Ethical Committee . All patient , adequately inform study , offer collaboration , provide informed consent enter study . All participant underwent neurocognitive-rehabilitative training consist 24 session BTsN . Each treatment session last 45 minute , repeat three time week 8 week . Both group underwent conventional physiotherapy program . All patient randomize two group : Semi-immersive virtual training ( S-IVTSgroup ) without ( S-IVTgroup ) body shadow . Each participant evaluate skilled neuropsychologist administration complete battery , skilled neurologist assess motor function . All patient evaluate specific clinical-psychometric battery ( T0 ) , immediately ( T1 ) end training . Primary outcomes consisted Montreal Cognitive Assessment Test ( MoCA ) Functional Independence Measure ( FIM ) . In addition , administer Frontal Assessment Battery ( FAB ) ass executive function , Attentive Matrices ( AM ) Trial Making Test ( TMTA , TMTB , TMTB-A ) measure attention process , Trunk Control Test ( TCT ) Motricity Index ( MI ) upper limbs evaluate motor function . BTsN TRAINING SETTING Nirvana first device base optoelectronic infrared sensor , though patient simply interact movement . The rehabilitation exercise audio-visual stimulus feedback involve perceptual-cognitive skill patient , result motivational training . Several mode increase level difficulty characterize exercise , therapist use pre-defined rehabilitative solution new one , accord patient 's need . The result achieve rehabilitation allow therapist evaluate patient 's actual progress , modify rehabilitation program . The system connect projector big screen ( put front patient ) , reproduce interactive series exercise ( trunk , upper low limb , cognition ) , thanks infrared video camera analyze patient 's movement , create interactivity . At end work session , possible export full list exercise perform score obtain . Concerning cognitive training , include series exercise involve attention , memory ( verbal visuo-spatial ) , spatial cognition , ocular-manual coordination , gnosis ability , problem solving , executive function , constructive praxis . Notably , BTsN device use theS-IVT group projector locate behind patient , thus shadow patient project screen , whereas S-IVTSgroup projector locate front patient shadow visible .</detailed_description>
