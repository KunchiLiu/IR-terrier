	<brief_summary>Primary Specific Aim : Determine effect combine physical exercise cognitive training cognitive function ICU survivor age 65 old . Hypothesis : In comparison old ICU survivor randomize attention control either intervention alone , randomize 12 week combine physical exercise cognitive training high total index cognitive score assess Repeatable Battery Assessment Neuropsychological Status ( RBANS ) 3 6 month post randomization . Secondary Specific Aim 1 : Determine effect combine physical exercise cognitive training physical performance , anxiety depressive symptom , quality life ICU survivor age 65 old . Hypotheses : In comparison old ICU survivor randomize attention control either intervention alone , randomize 12 week combine physical exercise cognitive training high physical performance measure short physical performance battery ( SPPB ) two-minute step test , low mood anxiety symptom measure Patient Health Questionnaire ( PHQ-9 ) Generalized Anxiety Disorder ( GAD-7 ) scale , high quality life measure Medical Outcomes Study 36-item short form ( SF-36 ) 3 6-months post randomization . Secondary Specific Aim 2 : To examine mechanisms action combine training . Hypothesis : At completion treatment , combine intervention group show reduce serum level CRP , IL-1 , IL-6 , IL-8 , TNF-α , S-100β , GFAP increase level BDNF , VEGF , IGF-1 compare attention control , either intervention alone group .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Critical illness deleterious consequence acute chronic cognitive function . Acute cognitive dysfunction manifest delirium critically ill especially elderly . Delirium complex neuropsychiatric syndrome characterize acute fluctuating change cognition consciousness . 60 % 80 % critically ill ventilate old patient 30 % 50 % less illness severity delirium least one day ICU hospital stay . Chronic cognitive dysfunction manifest ICU acquire cognitive impairment dementia critical illness , affect multiple cognitive domain persist year hospital discharge . Up 71 % critical illness survivor cognitive impairment one year hospital discharge close 18 % diagnose new dementia include Alzheimer 's disease within three year post ICU hospitalization . Two million old Americans suffer episode delirium intensive care unit ( ICU ) stay . Presence delirium predispose elderly immediate in-hospital complication include long length ICU hospital stay , increase risk in-patient mortality elevate cost care . In addition , ICU delirium associate long-term post-discharge complication development cognitive impairment dementia . Current advance management critical illness notably improve survival rate among vulnerable segment old adult . However , increase survival come cost many 70 % old ICU survivor episode delirium suffering subsequent cognitive impairment dementia . At present , effective scalable recovery model remediate ICU acquire cognitive impairment attendant elevate dementia Alzheimer 's disease risk . The inability develop efficacious intervention reduce ICU acquire cognitive impairment may stem limited understanding link acute brain dysfunction ( delirium ) chronic brain dysfunction ( ICU acquire cognitive impairment , dementia Alzheimer 's disease ) . The investigator propose recovery intervention guide pathophysiologic mechanism implicate produce critical illness delirium elevate risk cognitive impairment . The intervention target inflammation , glial dysfunction astrocyte activation along restoration neurotrophic factor train function directly across multiple cognitive domain reduce burden cognitive impairment among ICU survivor delirium . Over past five year , Indiana University Center Aging Research develop research infrastructure focus delirium delirium associate cognitive impairment , encompass ICU post-ICU period . This include develop bio-repository serum delirium biomarkers , ICU base delirium trial , post-ICU exercise cognitive therapy recovery model . Building upon prior work base pathophysiologic mechanism mention , investigator propose novel home-based combine physical exercise cognitive training program old ICU survivor improve cognitive impairment . The study team propose 2x2 factorial design randomize control trial ( RCT ) call `` Decreasing Alzheimer 's Disease Related Dementias Delirium-Exercise Cognitive Training ( DDD-ECT ) '' evaluate efficacy 12 week combine physical exercise cognitive training primary outcome cognitive function among old ICU survivor experience delirium ICU stay . The investigator propose deliver intervention via facilitator-led , small group format use internet-enabled , multiparty-videoconference deliver directly participant ' home achieve study aim list summary .</detailed_description>
