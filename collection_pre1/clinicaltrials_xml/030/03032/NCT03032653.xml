	<brief_title>Immediate Weight-Bearing Ankle Study</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Ankle fracture among common injury , make 9 % fracture . Rotational ankle fracture among common fracture , incidence average 4.2 per 1,000 individual annually . These fracture range minimal injury amenable non-surgical management complex injury potential long-term sequela . Known risk factor ankle fracture age , body mass index previous ankle fracture , high incidence elderly woman . Most ankle fracture low-energy injury occur body rotates planted foot , whether sport , normal gait , otherwise . Stable ankle fracture generally treat non-surgically , unstable fracture usually treat surgical reduction fixation , indication previously well-described publish . However , post-operative management injury still controversial , large variability care provider . Protocols range complete immobilization affect ankle non-weightbearing early range-of-motion ( ROM ) weightbearing ( WB ) . Studies compare immobilization non-WB early ROM WB result mixed , recent study demonstrate safety advantage protect WB ROM two week post-operatively versus non-WB immobilization six week . The Investigators intend expand study propose single-centre historical control group comparative study compare outcomes surgically-treated rotational ankle fracture current routine practice early protect weightbearing range motion immediate unprotected weightbearing tolerated range motion ankle open reduction internal fixation .</detailed_description>
