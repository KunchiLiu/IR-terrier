	<brief_summary>The feasibility study propose primarily examine sensitivity electroencephalogram ( EEG ) -based Brain Computer Interface ( BCI ) detect significant difference brain signal patient chronic low back pain ( N=10 ) , low limb pain ( N=10 ) healthy control ( N=10 ) perceive movement via video actual movement . The BCI device approve use previous trial ( e.g . NNI-IRB/07/001 , DSRB Domain D/09/608 , DSRB Domain D/10/072 ) safety effectiveness non-invasive EEG-based BCI device validate trial . However , validation specific use pain . Related primary objective study , develop validate adaptive participant-specific pain detection analysis program explore identify discriminative robust pattern spontaneous EEG study sample . For secondary objective , develop validate BCI computer base pain attention diversion training system interactive audio-visual feedback Phase 2 study . These feedback inform user current brain activation level attention level , guide user learn modulate EEG characteristic develop skill manage attention alleviate perceive fear-related pain . The BCI system capture EEG signal decodes underlie brain state relation cognition fear-related pain perception . Such decoded brain state present participant visual form guide participant learn regulate brain state towards good pain management . For example , participant may sessions learn focus visual feedback inhibit brain function activity relation fear-related pain perception . With practice , user encourage achieve brain activity modulation without external feedback fear-related pain reduce realistic situation .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>We hypothesize , use appropriately design system learn compute technique , brain-computer interface ( BCI ) technology detect specific brain wave pattern patient chronic low back pain lower limb pain compare healthy control . Also , BCI technology detect specific brain wave pattern fear avoidance behaviour motor activity know trigger pain chronic pain patient . This validation feasibility study . We calculate sufficient funding cover 10 participant low back pain , low limb pain , healthy control BCI training respectively . Participants screen undergo comprehensive assessment Rehabilitation Physician ( RP ) study team . The aim comprehensive assessment establish safety suitability participant study subject accord inclusion exclusion criteria.To ensure high level compliance give high frequency visit subject study , important motivate volunteer choose . Consent take outpatient consultation room pain management clinic ( PMC ) Tan Tock Seng Hospital , full provision privacy . PMC study conduct . Informed consent take convenience potential participant . A full explanation participant information sheet give question answer . The study conduct 3 phase . Total span study participation : 11-months . Phase 1 : A total 2 visit study site 2 consecutive week require . Each visit take approximately 1 hour 15 minute . The 1st session involve visit doctor 's office screening assessment-history taking , physical examination , electronic note review different current standard pain consultation . Those find suitable decide take part , ask 2nd session : 1 . Complete digital set self-report measure 6-minute walk test . These measure complete start end second session . The walk test conduct trained physiotherapist familiar measure . 2 . Participants participate two set non-invasive experiment one another . The BCI system set-up comprise laptop connect brain signal recorder headset record brain signal use . Sensors measure sweat pulse rate also use experiment . The brain signal recorder together sensor secure backpack worn participant experiment . Exp 1-participants watch 15 videos people daily activity . Each video frame approximately 1 min long . EEG signal pattern record video frame . Exp 2-participants go series 15 physical movement guide physiotherapist . Participants require complete 15 repetition , within 1 min . EEG signal pattern record movement . Two buzzer ( label `` less pain '' `` pain '' ) available participant press accordingly experience 'lesser ' 'more ' pain point experiment . If 'more ' pain experience , physiotherapist ass participant 's condition participant choice either ( 1 ) continue experiment low intensity ( 2 ) stop experiment . Phase 2 : Approximately 6 month participant ' participation Phase 1 span period 7 week . If select complete Phase 2 , participant undergo 18 session ( 3 sessions/week ) brain training period 6 consecutive week . Sessions conduct alternate day week session last approximately 1 hour . The system set-up used Phase 1 use training session . At start first session week 1 , immediately complete last training session Week 6 participant also complete set self-report questionnaire 6-minute walk test ( assessed Phase 1 ) . At week 7 ( 1 week post training ) participant complete full set measure set second session Phase 1 . Phase 3 : A total 2 visit study site require . Each visit take approximately 1 hour 15 minute . These 2 visit schedule approximately 8.5 mths 10.5 mths complete Phase 1 . Both visit session involve repeat full set measure participant complete 2nd session Phase 1 . Potential Risks 1 . The potential risk participant minimal none measure component system invasive . There currently know safety issue headset sensor . However participant keep informed new finding . 2 . Participants may experience temporary exertion relate discomfort main muscle group use physiotherapy guide movement experiment ( Experiment 2 ) although design fit within participant ' ability . Participants advise contact Principal Investigator ( PI ) muscular discomfort persist 24 hour . 3 . If participant screen positive depression point study , PI train psychologist screen active depression appropriate refer RP treatment recommendation . In case , participant exclude withdrawn study . 4 . Due potential video guide movement elicit fear pain , participant may experience increase anxiety slight worsen usual pain . Experiment 2 perform close supervision physiotherapist prevent possible strain cause incorrect movement . If participant experience 'more ' pain , physiotherapist assess condition participant choice either ( 1 ) continue experiment low intensity ( 2 ) stop experiment . In event participant experience anxiety participate experiment , PI ass symptom anxiety able administer appropriate intervention onsite necessary cost . If treatment require , participant stop experiment , get re-assessed RP appropriate referral make treatment follow-up . 5 . As medication except simple analgesic Paracetamol , Paracetamol/Orphenadrine , Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug Tramadol treat pain take participate study , possibility pain may exacerbate condition may worsen . If occurs , RP re-assess condition make appropriate treatment recommendation . 6 . If participant pain condition exacerbate point course study reason indicate point 1-4 , refer RP study team assessment make appropriate treatment recommendation . 7. participant develop significant symptom study participation warrant medical intervention , subsidize medical consult follow-up treatment cost . The RP study team facilitate fast track appointment PMC within 2 week . Study Withdrawal : ( ) Participants may withdraw voluntarily participation study time . Participants may also withdraw voluntarily receive study intervention reason . If voluntary withdrawal occurs , participant ask continue schedule evaluation involvement study cease . ( b ) Any participant withdrawn participation study serious adverse event classify reasonable causal relationship study occur . In case participant give appropriate medical care symptom resolve condition becomes stable . The participant ask continue schedule evaluation involvement study cease . ( c ) All participant withdraw study closure due Domain Specific Review Board ( DSRB ) review . Participants drop study replace .
