	<brief_title>TASK-002 : Bioequivalence Bedaquiline 400mg Administered Crushed Form Compared Tablet Form Healthy Male Female Adults Under Fed Conditions ( BDQ Crush Study )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This randomize , open-label , cross-over , bioequivalence study two single treatment period , separate 14-day wash-out period , conduct among 24 healthy adult male female , receive 400mg ( 4 x 100mg ) bedaquiline orally one two sequence : either first whole tablet form second crush ( experimental ) form , vice versa feed condition . The bioequivalence evaluation base primary pharmacokinetic ( pk ) parameter affect extent absorption , i.e. , bioavailability . If bioequivalence show , knowledge difference bioavailability whole crush tablet use assess need dose adjustment child receive crushed form .</detailed_description>
