	<brief_summary>The prospective multicenter study GD-Brain provide good knowledge basis neurological impairment child bear mother gestational diabetes ( GDM ) . GDM modify placental structure affect materno-fetal nutrient transfer . Docosahexaenoic acid ( DHA ) play important role neurodevelopment , reduce venous cord blood newborn bear GDM . In previous study , already demonstrate impaired DHA fetal level use label fatty acid stable isotope administrate pregnant woman , also observational study GDM prevention obesity study ( PREOBE study ) Granada similar study Murcia . The impaired cord DHA level associate disturbed neurodevelopment child first year life . However , uncertain mechanism underlie impaired materno-fetal DHA transfer implication later life . The recent publication Nature Journal selective transmembrane carrier DHA brain name `` major facilitator superfamily domain 2a '' ( MFSD2a ) open new expectation . We detect disturbed MFSD2a level placentas GDM could due structural problem organ ; inflammation , oxidation metabolic change relate diabetes might affect MFSD2a activity . Moreover , difficult know whether disturbed MFSD2a level placenta may also indicate altered level carrier brain child bear GDM mother , could contribute neurodevelopment impairment subject . Recent study also indicate obesity alters biosynthesis eicosanoids derive DHA , decrease protectins resolvin D-series , powerful anti-inflammatory property . The main aim study analyse potential difference neurodevelopment , brain structure functioning , child 8 year old born GDM respect bear healthy normoweight mother , well identify early biomarkers consistently relate neurodevelopment early stage life .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>We contact participant PREOBE study Murcia 's cohort study get involved total 174 child 8 year age . The result neurodevelopment evaluation neuropsychological testing , neurological function rhythms neuroimaging ( fMRI DTI ) 8 year old associate clinical metabolic data record pregnancy . As secondary aim , would discern whether decrease DHA level offspring GDM birth associate disturbed neurodevelopment 8 year old . The impact maternal diabetes placental MFSD2a child 's resolvin protectins derive DHA measure urine sample 8 year old . Gut microbiota composition function also study detect role potential disturbance regard production anti-inflammatory mediator . A part clinical study , perform intervention trial use animal model . Gestational rat diabetes control rat treated antioxidant adipoRon order delay neuro-degeneration animal diabetes , well influence MFSD2a level placenta brain . All study may provide industry valuable information improve nutritional supplement gestation infancy avoid potential delay cognitive function offspring diabetic mother .</detailed_description>
