	<brief_summary>Age-associated loss muscle mass , term sarcopenia , strongly associate functional impairment physical disability elderly . Maintenance growth muscle mass mainly driven increased muscle protein synthesis ( i.e . generation new muscle protein ) response exercise feeding . However , several investigation show elderly individual blunt protein synthetic response follow protein intake . This inability elderly properly respond growth stimulus term anabolic resistance play significant role development sarcopenia . However , precise mechanism underpin anabolic resistance unknown . It well establish muscle protein synthesis molecular level regulate cellular protein complex call mTORC1 . When exposed growth stimulus , mTORC1 show associate lysosome , i.e . intracellular organelle responsible breakdown cellular protein , subsequently move towards cell periphery . This movement lysosome-associated mTORC1 within cell believe vital activation protein synthesis , inhibition lysosomal movement blunts mTORC1 activation response amino acid . Thus , dysregulation lysosomal movement age muscle may represent underlie mechanism development anabolic resistance . However , area research unexplored context human skeletal muscle . The investigator hypothesize dysregulation lysosomal movement play central role development age-associated skeletal muscle anabolic resistance .</brief_summary>
