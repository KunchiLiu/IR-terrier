	<brief_summary>Home monitoring technology recently emerge many different area healthcare . These technology use provide rehabilitation patient , prevent , identify , manage complication . The investigator propose method monitor communicate patient first 12 week total knee arthroplasty ( TKA ) use electronic home-based patient monitoring system unique connectivity capability prescriptive control . The investigator prospectively , electronically capture range motion gait parameter specify interval use Bluetooth sensor wear patient . The unique in-home patient monitoring platform utilize 10 TKA patient return home following surgery . The investigator hypothesize use internet base home patient monitor technology platform reliably provide information related patient ' pain function enhance patient feedback communication TKA . The hypothesis test follow aim : 1 ) To test reliability technology utilized within patient 's home include limited sensor , communication controller , patient interface ( Android tablet ) internet prospectively compare data collect home monitoring technology traditional clinical measurement take physical therapy surgical follow-up visit .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Over one million primary total hip total knee arthroplasty ( TKA ) surgery perform annually U.S. number expect increase next seven year , along simultaneously project shortage train orthopaedic surgeon care patient . This proposal address optimization surgeon ' clinical time utilization innovative home base technology monitor communicate patient first 12 week total knee arthroplasty . This accomplished establish home monitoring connectivity novel technology measure validate patient-reported outcome , knee ROM gait parameter postoperative TKA patient 's native living environment . It allow investigator prospectively , electronically capture clinically relevant TKA outcomes patient 's home provide insight postoperative rehabilitation progress , predictor suboptimal clinical outcome , guide future randomize control trial development improve outcome .</detailed_description>
