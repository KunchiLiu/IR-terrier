	<brief_title>A Study Of Pembrolizumab In Combination With Trastuzumab-DM1</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This research study Phase I clinical trial , test safety investigational intervention also try define appropriate dose investigational intervention use study . `` Investigational '' mean intervention study . It also mean FDA ( U.S. Food Drug Administration ) approve combination Pembrolizumab T-DM1 use patient , include people type cancer . This study determine amount ( dose ) Pembrolizumab T-DM1 safe people take effect , good bad , combination may participants disease . The FDA approve Pembrolizumab specific disease approve United Sates treatment type cancer . The FDA approve Trastuzumab emtansine ( T-DM1 ) treatment option type breast cancer The combination Pembrolizumab T-DM1 investigational . It think together drug help get immune system attack tumor cell kill cancer cell HER2 protein . However , know give two study drug time well anti-cancer effect give treatment .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Patients must histologically cytologically confirm invasive breast cancer , stage IV disease . Patients without pathologic cytologic confirmation metastatic disease unequivocal evidence metastasis physical examination radiologic evaluation . Either primary tumor and/or metastasis must test ER , PR HER2 . Patient must HER2+ breast cancer per ASCO CAP guideline 2013 . Prior chemotherapy : History prior therapy trastuzumab taxane , separately combination , require . Patients must either receive one line prior therapy metastatic breast cancer , develop disease recurrence within 6 month complete adjuvant therapy . No prior treatment TDM1 allow . Last dose chemotherapy must least 21 day prior registration . Prior biologic therapy : Patients must discontinue biologic investigational therapy least 21 day registration . Prior radiation therapy : Patients may receive prior radiation therapy either metastatic earlystage set . Radiation therapy must complete least 14 day prior registration . In dose deescalation cohort : Subjects must evaluable disease . In expansion cohort : Subjects must least one lesion within previously radiate field measurable computerized tomography ( CT ) magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) scan per RECIST version 1.1 . Bone lesion consider measurable definition . Age ≥18 year . ECOG performance status ≤2 ( Karnofsky ≥60 % , see Appendix A ) Participants must normal organ marrow function define : absolute neutrophil count ≥1,500/μl platelets ≥100,000/μl hemoglobin ≥9 g/dL total bilirubin ≤1.5mg/dL ( ≤2.0 patient know Gilberts syndrome ) AST ( SGOT ) /ALT ( SGPT ) ≤2.5 × institutional ULN . ≤5.0 × institutional ULN patient document liver metastasis . albumin &gt; 2.5mg/dL serum creatinine ≤1.5mg/dL calculate GFR ≥60 mL/min INR/PT ≤1.5 time ULN unless participant receiving anticoagulant therapy , long PT PTT within therapeutic range intend use anticoagulant aPTT/PTT ≤1.5 time ULN unless participant receiving anticoagulant therapy , long PT PTT within therapeutic range intend use anticoagulant Participants enrol dose expansion must tissue amenable biopsy willing undergo fresh tissue biopsy baseline . Participants undergo attempt research biopsy procedure purpose protocol , inadequate tissue obtain , require undergo repeat biopsy order continue protocol . The effect pembrolizumab develop human fetus unknown . For reason tratuzumab , component TDM1 , know teratogenic , woman childbearing potential men childbearing potential must agree use adequate contraception start first dose study therapy , duration study participation , additional 120 day last dose study medication . Note : abstinence acceptable usual lifestyle prefer contraception subject . Should woman become pregnant suspect pregnant partner participate study , treat physician principal investigator inform immediately . While study , woman breastfeed . Subjects childbearing potential define surgically sterilize and/or menstrual period past year Female subject childbearing potential must negative urine serum pregnancy within 72 hour prior receive first dose study medication . If urine test positive confirm negative , serum pregnancy test require . Patients bisphosphonates may continue receive bisphosphonate therapy study treatment . Left ventricular ejection fraction ( LVEF ) must within institutional limit normal assessed echocardiogram MUGA document within 28 day prior first dose study drug . Ability understand willingness sign write informed consent document The subject receive another investigational agent within 21 day first dose study drug . The subject receive prior pembrolizumab antiPD1 , antiPDL1 , antiPDL2 therapy , participate prior study involve pembrolizumab . Preexisting neuropathy great equal grade 2 . Hypersensitivity pembrolizumab TDM1 excipients . The subject history evidence active , noninfectious pneumonitis interstitial lung disease . Known brain metastasis untreated , symptomatic , require therapy control symptom . Participants previously diagnose brain metastasis eligible complete treatment least one month prior trial therapy initiation , neurologically stable absence new neurological symptom least 4 week prior study entry , recover effect radiotherapy surgery . Any corticosteroid use brain metastasis must discontinue without subsequent appearance symptom ≥2 week first study drug . Treatment brain metastasis may include whole brain radiotherapy , radiosurgery , combination deem appropriate treating physician . Known carcinomatous meningitis . The subject uncontrolled intercurrent illness include , limited , uncontrolled hypertension , unstable angina pectoris , uncontrolled cardiac arrhythmia , congestive heart failure ( New York Heart Association Class III IV ; see Appendix B ) , active ischemic heart disease , myocardial infarction within previous six month , uncontrolled diabetes mellitus , chronic liver renal disease , severe malnutrition . Concurrent use potent CYP3A4 inhibitor ( see Appendix C ) , ketoconazole erythromycin , avoid study treatment TDM1 . Active infection require intravenous antibiotic cycle 1 day 1 . Individuals history second malignancy ineligible except follow circumstance . Individuals history malignancy eligible diseasefree least 5 year deem investigator low risk recurrence malignancy . Individuals follow cancer eligible diagnose treat within past 5 year : cervical cancer situ , nonmelanoma cancer skin . Patients cancer diagnose within past 5 year felt low risk recurrence discuss study sponsor determine eligibility . The subject medical condition require chronic systemic steroid therapy form immunosuppressive medication include disease modifiying agent , require therapy last 2 year . Replacement therapy ( eg. , thyroxine , insulin , physiologic corticosteroid replacement therapy adrenal pituitary insufficiency , etc . ) consider form systemic treatment . The subject active autoimmune disease document history autoimmune disease syndrome require systemic steroid immunosuppressive agent . The participant positive Hepatitis B surface antigen , Hepatitis C RNA . Known HIVpositive participant . HIVpositive patient combination antiretroviral therapy ineligible potential pharmacokinetic interaction pembrolizumab . In addition , participant increase risk lethal infection bone marrow suppressive therapy , i.e . nabpaclitaxel . Appropriate study undertake participant receive combination antiretroviral therapy indicate . The subject receive live vaccine within 28 day plan start study therapy . Note : seasonal influenza vaccine infection generally inactivate flu vaccine allow ; however intranasal influenza vaccine ( i.e . FluMist ® ) live attenuate vaccine , allow</criteria>
