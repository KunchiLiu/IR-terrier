	<brief_title>Sofosbuvir/Ledipasvir Hepatitis C Genotype 1-6 Patients With Transfusion-Dependent Thalassemia : An Open Label Trial</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Thalassemia characterize defect red blood cell production . The anemia cause destruction erythroblast bone marrow , erythrocytes ' hemolysis disrupt erythropoiesis . The life-long need transfusion make patient vulnerable transfusion transmit viral infection especially hepatitis C virus ( HCV ) . HCV infection widespread disease . It affect large number thalassemia patient consider major public health problem . Infection HCV result chronic infection huge proportion infect individual . Therefore , suggest early treatment acute HCV may prevent development chronic hepatitis . Several study dwell efficacy interferon therapy acute HCV infection adult . Newer pegylated interferon ( PEG-IFN ) use treatment adult acute HCV show equally excellent result . However , thalassemia patient , iron overload liver negatively affect outcome liver disease lead severe hepatic inflammation fibrosis chronic hepatitis C decrease response IFN therapy . Ribavarin also add treatment option IFN , ribavirin thalassemia patient increase transfusion need median 30-40 % , increase major adverse event treatment withdrawal . At end 2013 , Food Drug Administration ( FDA ) approve new direct-acting antiviral agent treatment HCV infection : Sofosbuvir ( Gilead Sciences ) . Ledipasvir ( Gilead Sciences ) new drug potent activity HCV genotypes 1a 1b . The combination ledipasvir sofosbuvir result high rate response among patient HCV genotype 1 infection receive prior treatment interferon-based regimen . Ledipasvir sofosbuvir combine single fixed-dose tablet use daily ( ledipasvir-sofosbuvir ) . Using drug HCV therapy alone combination IFN 12 24 week , result 90 % response rate patient general population . Patients transfusion-dependent thalassemia major increase risk adverse event pegylated interferon ribavirin therapy HCV due notable 30 % increase transfusion requirement 48-week therapy . Some patient eligible treatment relapse respond previous Ribavarin IFN regimens . Treatment naïve thalassemia patient HCV expose anemia transfusion-induced iron overload among adverse event associate Ribavarin IFN . These patient particular , addition treatment-naïve thalassemia patient , limited alternative treatment option available constitute area significant unmet clinical need . There currently literature available show efficacy sofosbuvir/ledipasvir treatment thalassemia patient hepatitis C. Therefore , trial study efficacy sofosbuvir/ledipasvir hepatitis C genotype 1-6 patient transfusion-dependent thalassemia . Ten patient Lebanese Chronic Care Center enrol open label trial . Patients transfusion dependent thalassemia hepatitis C enrol . Study patient receive treatment follow informed consent follow regularly study coordinator side effect , compliance adherence . A blood test hemoglobin hematocrit liver enzyme , do patient baseline 4 week , 8 week , 12 week therapy . At week 12 , level virus patient 's blood also evaluate . Liver image do throughout study . Benefits study outweigh potential risk . Side effect medication use minor however potential benefit patient possibly treat hepatitis C approve drug ( general population ) cost , society , possibility find oral treatment efficient tolerable special population . As privacy confidentiality issue , data lock . The PI Co- Investigators one access data .</detailed_description>
