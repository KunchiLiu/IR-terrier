	<brief_summary>Traumatic brain injury ( TBI ) refer neuronal damage occur result external force apply brain tissue . In United Kingdom annual figure ( 2013-2014 ) show 449,000 hospital admittance diagnosis head injury male five time likely sustain head injury female . Traumatic brain injury ( TBI ) cause life-long disability , significant reduction life expectancy , affect diverse range cognitive social function include memory , task planning execution , impulse control , social interaction , personality change depression . Following traumatic brain injury acquire deficit lead problem resumption aspect daily life , particularly term return work interpersonal relationship . The initial injury trigger secondary cascade metabolic , neurochemical cellular change within brain , primarily aim limiting damage stimulate repair . Paradoxically prolonged secondary cascade mechanism , include haemorrhage , oedema , neuroinflammation axonal injury , result exacerbation deficit observe . The heterogeneous on-going nature secondary cascade present clinicians opportunity intervene attempt limit neuronal damage . A large body nutritional research focus address hypermetabolic catabolic state create secondary cascade process acute stage . Addressing demand played significant role reduce mortality infection rate follow head injury , however depth research investigate post-acute period ( individual discharge hospital ) .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Micronutrient Supplement Effects Cognitive Outcomes Post-Acute TBI</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Micronutrients ( include vitamin , mineral certain polyunsaturated fatty acid ) require brain normal functioning , exception , obtain dietary source . Research degenerative disease age link mitochondrial age DNA damage cause micronutrient deficiency great incidence cognitive decline stroke , among disease , general population , particularly consume food rich fat carbohydrates poor micronutrient content . Other research focus cognition , behaviour mood state associate micronutrient deficiency wide range neurological condition include Alzheimer 's Disease , Parkinson 's Disease , multiple sclerosis , autism spectrum disorder , depression , fatigue schizophrenia . There however study use micronutrient intervention post-acute human TBI . In study thirty retire American Football player intervention include supplementation broad-spectrum multivitamin , omega-3 fish oil number substance result significant percentile score improvement almost half participant ( n=100 ) across broad range cognitive measure . Findings demonstrate micronutrient intervention result significant measurable improvement TBI many year follow initial insult . The current study involve three group individual post-acute traumatic brain injury , investigate two different supplement measure whether improved cognitive outcome ( measure test-retest cognitive battery ) associate supplement , compare control group .</detailed_description>
