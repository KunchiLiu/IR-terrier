	<brief_summary>This phase II trial study well donor stem cell transplant work treat patient high risk hematologic malignancy . Giving total-body irradiation chemotherapy donor stem cell transplant help stop growth cell bone marrow , include normal blood-forming cell ( stem cell ) cancer cell . It may also stop patient 's immune system reject donor 's stem cell . When healthy stem cell donor infused patient may help patient 's bone marrow make stem cell , red blood cell , white blood cell , platelet . The donated stem cell may also replace patient 's immune cell help destroy remain cancer cell .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Two Step Approach Allogeneic Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation Patients With Hematologic Malignancies-Increasing GVT Effects Without Increasing Toxicity</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Primary Objective : 1 . To assess 2 year probability OS high risk patient undergo myeloablative 2 step HSCT utilize strategy decrease relapse . Secondary Objective : 1 . To assess relapse incidence 2 year post-HSCT patient undergo treatment protocol . 2 . To assess regimen related toxicity GVHD incidence 2 year post-HSCT severity patient undergoing treatment protocol . 3 . To assess consistency pace engraftment . 4 . To assess pace T cell B cell immune recovery .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>This treatment patient high risk hematologic malignancy . High risk define : Any patient hematologic malignancy allogeneic HSCT pursue expectation cure . Patients may posttreatment residual disease , disease stable minimally progressive must responsive chemotherapy . Any patient untreated hematologic malignancy allogeneic HSCT think sole best option cure Patients without morphologic evidence disease high risk feature would predict relapse despite remission HSCT adverse cytogenetics , 3rd great CR , failure recover peripheral blood count normal range . While patient detectable disease current method , like patient nondetectable disease case highly aggressive . Patients must one relate donor HLA mismatch GVHD direction two HLA locus ( except describe ) Patients must adequate organ function : Left Ventricular Ejection Fraction ( LVEF ) ≥50 % DLCO ( adjust hemoglobin ) ≥50 % predict FEV1 ≥50 % Adequate liver function define serum bilirubin ≤1.8 , Aspartate aminotransferase ( AST ) alanine aminotransferase ( ALT ) ≤ 2.5 x Upper Limit Normal ( ULN ) Creatinine clearance ≥ 60ml/min Karnofsky Performance Status ( KPS ) ≥80 % modify KPS tool ( see Appendix ) Patients must willing use contraception childbearing potential Able give inform consent Age ≥ 18 year age Modified KPS &lt; 80 % &gt; 5 Comorbidity Points Hematopoietic Cell Transplant CoMorbidity Index ( HCT CI ) ( See Appendix ) Human Immunodeficiency Virus ( HIV ) positive Active involvement central nervous system malignancy Psychiatric disorder would preclude patient sign informed consent Pregnancy , unwillingness use contraception childbearing potential Patients life expectancy ≤ 6 month reason underlie hematologic/oncologic disorder Alemtuzumab treatment within 8 week HSCT admission Antithymocyte globulin ( ATG ) level ≥ 2ugm/ml Patients active inflammatory process include T max &gt; 101 active tissue inflammation exclude include day admission Inability tolerate cyclophosphamide undergo total body irradiation dose specify treatment plan .</criteria>
