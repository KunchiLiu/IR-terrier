	<brief_summary>In previous work investigator identify group child age 10-18 year whose diagnostic workup chronic nausea unexplained conventional diagnostic test unexpectedly reveal underlying cardiovascular instability manifest orthostatic intolerance , primary define postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome ( POTS ) ( 88 % ) . While atypical initial presentation orthostatic intolerance general , investigator believe cardiovascular problem serious represent cause nausea majority individual , treatment POTS fludrocortisone reduce symptom nausea . While fludrocortisone treatment abrogate fall baroreflex sensitivity ( BRS ) tilt part , completely correct tachycardia symptom BRS suppression HUT . Furthermore cause elevation MAP supine position , may lead future cardiovascular problem early onset hypertension cardiac hypertrophy . This argue different treatment approach . The investigator present preliminary data application reveal OI subject tend low 25-hydroxy vitamin D ( 25 ( OH ) D ) compare non OI subject .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Vitamin D Deficiency Dysautonomia</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The investigator approach combine HUT test couple autonomic test include continuous blood pressure HR measurement , Baroreflex Sensitivity Hear Rate Variability , establish objective autonomic profile , along vascular test include Pulse Wave Velocity , Ankle Brachial Index rest measure blood volume different compartment , Systemic Vascular Resistance cardiac output rest response hand-grip stress . This allow treating physician provide patient specific diagnosis , ultimately develop data focus , rational treatment currently achieve . The full vascular profile also novel potential improve therapeutic management participant independent outcomes vitamin D supplementation . This study design recruit 80 participant 4 group 20 . The 4 group represent non OI ( recruit clinic nausea without positive tilt test ) show orthostatic intolerance ( POTS alone , OH , syncope ) . The general objective proposal address gap knowledge determine vascular function , neurohumoral profile autonomic status supine response HUT OI subject low vitamin D level comparison subject test negative OI HUT . The investigator aim examine effect vitamin D replacement measure , provide possibility therapeutic use vitamin D treat ameliorate symptom associate OI .</detailed_description>
