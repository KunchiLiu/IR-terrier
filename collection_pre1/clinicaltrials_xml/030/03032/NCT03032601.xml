	<brief_summary>Multiple Sclerosis ( MS ) disease myelin surround nerve cell damage affect function . MS usually treat medication design reduce occurrence future MS event . Evidence suggest important part disease process damage myelin brain cause much oxygen ( sometimes call oxidative stress ) much inflammation ( swell ) . The overall goal study determine whether NAC help support cerebral function patient Multiple Sclerosis ( MS ) . This PET-MRI study utilize FDG PET measure cerebral metabolism , along MRI analysis , measure metabolism structural effect NAC patient MS .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Physiological Effects N-Acetyl Cysteine Patients With Multiple Sclerosis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The study consist two arm . The first arm study receive intravenous oral NAC , strong antioxidant increase brain glutathione . NAC , N-acetyl derivative naturally occur amino acid , L-cysteine . It common over-the-counter supplement also available injectable pharmaceutical protects liver case acetaminophen overdose . Laboratory study display benefit use NAC . It potential reduce marker oxidative damage , protect cell death , increase glutathione blood , might useful prevent oxidative damage MS patient . The second arm waitlist control receive standard MS care . It note arm receive standard care treatment MS enrol study .</detailed_description>

In addition , male subject partner childbearing age practice effective contraception . Participants must able complete study procedure great Philadelphia area . Patients exclude received treatment intravenous steroid within past 90 day Previous brain surgery would interfere determination cerebral metabolism structure FDG PETMRI . Score MiniMental Status examination 20 low . Wheelchairbound bedridden , nonambulatory . Intracranial abnormality may complicate interpretation brain scan ( e.g. , stroke , tumor , vascular abnormality affect target area ) . History head trauma loss consciousness &gt; 48 hour . History asthma require daily medication adequate management . Any medical disorder physical condition could reasonably expect interfere assessment MS symptom , study assessment include PETMRI imaging . Patients evidence significant psychiatric disorder history/examination would prevent completion study allow participate . Patients current alcohol drug abuse Pregnant lactate woman . Enrollment active clinical trial/ experimental therapy within prior 30 day . Pending surgery course study . Patients take medication might interact NAC involve study evaluate case case basis PI study physician . These medication include : Medications high blood pressure ; Medications slow blood clotting ; Medications diabetes ; Nitroglycerin . Patients history pulmonary hypertension . Any neurological , psychiatric , medical condition might affect distribution radiopharmaceutical body brain ( determined Investigator ) Currently use medication might alter distribution radiopharmaceutical body brain ( determined Investigator ) Patient exceed weight limit table Claustrophobia would prevent completion image study Glucose level would interfere FDG PET scan Any additional contraindication MRI ; Has metallic object ( e.g. , pacemaker ) body</criteria>
