	<brief_title>Magnetic Resonance Imaging Intracranial Vasculopathies</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Magnetic Resonance Imaging ( MRI ) non-invasive diagnostic technique allow investigator literally `` see inside '' body without surgery ionizing radiation ( i.e. , x-rays ) . The MRI scanner use magnetic field radio wave produce picture human anatomy . Magnetic resonance image technique constantly develop optimized increase speed acquisition expand information content result image spectra . Such development typically make possible advance machine hardware computer software . Improved software option MR system necessitate evaluation determine best apply research study employ equipment . MR software initially evaluate use inanimate test phantom . Trials involve human subject necessary step development new MR software since test phantom often inadequate simulate real life condition . For example , test phantom use visualize subtle change tissue contrast evaluate effect voluntary patient movement , breathing , blood flow . Therefore , limited human subject test necessary evaluate optimize performance MR software . This entail vary MR pulse sequence parameter assess specific image quality measure tissue contrast , image artifact level signal noise ratio . Investigational software may include pulse sequence reconstruction software . Pulse sequence software module , control time current various coil imager . After reception digitization radiofrequency signal , reconstruction software create digital image , display video monitor . This software adhere FDA 's definition non-significant risk . The aim study optimize MR image MR angiography sequence image reconstruction 3T magnetic resonance imaging system subject suspect CNS vasculitis . Fifty ( 50 ) adult subject suspect intracranial vasculopathy enrol . These patient recruit subspecialty physician . Eligibility determine screen interview . The treat physician introduce study potential subject , try obtain consent order avoid possible coercion . The treat physician also try obtain approval contact phone discus study detail . A researcher later call potential subject explain study . An IRB approve telephone script use case non-physician make telephone call . Most subject expect recruited clinic . And describe , treat doctor clinic introduce study get subject approval contact phone detailed discussion . No subject call prior approval interest obtain . Since study actual MRI image spectra produce , intracranial pathology subject , sometimes optimal scan subject direct image comparison . This allow best comparison image , eliminate variability subject . Therefore , investigator ask subject would like return one additional MRI session . They obligation return scan second time , offer choice . If investigator scan subject second time , investigator obtain new consent second scanning session . Although study consider low risk , adult subject limit two MRI scan total study . MR Imaging - MR image acquire use 3 Tesla scanner . Prior scan subject ask remove metal ( include jewelry , etc . ) clothe person . Subjects wear earplugs hearing protection scan . Subjects lie still scanner head position comfortably pillow duration study . Subjects communication investigator via two way intercom time image study . Subjects encourage communicate feeling discomfort investigator immediately . Periodically duration MRI exam investigator confirm subject comfortable wish continue . The entire imaging session last 1-2 hour . Multiple anatomical functional imaging sequence run assess specific image quality measure . The anatomical scan repeat vary limited range pulse sequence parameter assess effect image contrast , image artifact signal noise ratio . Parameters vary may include repetition time MR acquisition ( TR ) , echo time acquisition ( TE ) , presence pre-acquisition inversion pulse , time interval pre-acquisition inversion pulse excitation pulse , spatial profile radiofrequency excitation pulse , spectral profile pre-excitation fat saturation pulse , time spatial encoding occurs within repetition time sequence , bandwidth signal digitizer , amplitude readout encode gradient , The shape readout gradient waveform , duration amplitude diffusion weight gradient , spatial resolution MR image , number spin-echoes acquire per excitation tip angle RF excitation . The parameter also evaluate pulse sequence , acquire parameter use reconstruction MR image . The range parameter maintain within FDA 's non-significant risk criterion ensure software hardware interlock put place scanner manufacturer . Anatomical image sequence may repeat different MR coil configuration compare performance coil . These coil include volume head coil , transmit receive surface coil receive-only phased array coil . Image Evaluation - Images evaluate determine effect pulse sequence parameter and/or hardware configuration image contrast noise ratio , signal noise ratio , specific image artifact Nyquist ghost level . The image acquire different pulse sequence parameter MR hardware configuration compare . Comparison MR image entail compare result specific image quality measure Signal Noise Ratio ( SNR ) Contrast Noise Ratio ( CNR ) well level image artifact Nyquist Ghost level . The measurement several quantity standardize National Electronics Manufacturers Association ( NEMA ) . The NEMA standard adopt FDA standard use evaluation premarket submission medical device ( see `` FDA Modernization Act 1997 : Guidance Recognition Use Consensus Standards ; Availability '' , Federal Register Vol . 63 No . 37 page 9561 ) . The investigator use standard measurement appropriate . In case standard measurement available appropriate , investigator use standard method use field . For example , measurement Nyquist Ghost level entail measure mean image intensity region interest contain ghost artifact image express percent mean object intensity across large Region Interest ( ROI ) object . The contrast-to-noise ratio measurement compare image intensity difference determine Regions Interest drawn two type tissue region interest ( gray matter white matter example ) mean noise magnitude image correct magnitude nature image use correction factor describe NEMA Signal-to-Noise Ratio measurement standard . While subjectivity measurement incur researcher place ROIs , felt subjective enough eye MR scientist require blind study . Therefore result measurement compare investigator study unblinded manner . In study , investigator vary MR image acquisition parameter plot value MR metric ( SNR , CNR , image artifact measure describe ) function MR image acquisition parameter value . The image quality metric measure four ten value MR acquisition parameter . For study RF coil comparison , single measurement require RF coil comparison require comparison image quality metric image artifact metric determine coil desirable . In case continuous parameter optimize , range parameter vary first determine possible perform scanner hardware time and/or amplitude limit safety limit define FDA 's non significant risk criterion . These limit determine phantom study prior human study . The range limit human study also narrow use information available literature describe similar study knowledge base model literature investigator previous study experience dependency MR signal sequence parameter question . The graph MR quality metric vs. parameter value review investigator determine whether subset parameter value merit finer search . If range graph exceeds factor 5 % time number point , finer search perform attempt determine maximum within 5 % accuracy criterion . A standard binary search strategy use . If high two point adjacent one-another , region probe additional 3-10 measurement . The procedure deem converged range data point le 5 % time number data point . If graph show evidence multiple maximum ( high point adjacent one another ) , multiple region explore additional measurement . Experience indicate 2 maximum unlikely optimize MR acquisition parameter range determine prior knowledge ( phantom study theoretical analysis ) . If graph monotonically increase decreasing , limit expand appropriate direction possible . When limit longer expand maximum reveal upon expansion , region near range limit explore 3-10 additional measurement verify boundary constraint determine potential value effort increase available limit hardware development tradeoff within pulse sequence .</detailed_description>
