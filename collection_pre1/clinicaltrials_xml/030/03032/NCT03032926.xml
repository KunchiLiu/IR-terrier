	<detailed_description>Study Sample Design : The study utilize open treatment pilot trial design . Participants include 10 individual , age 11-18 , primary anxiety disorder diagnosis . Participants must fail prior trial CBT . Participants psychiatric medication must stable dose least 2 month prior study participation remain symptomatic level identify study inclusion ( ADIS CSR â‰¥ 4 ) .

The Anxiety Disorder Interview Schedule Children DSM-5 ( ADIS-C-5 ) 19 measure primary outcome change clinical severity anxiety disorder symptom across age group . The Clinical Global Impression Scale ( CGI ) ass overall symptom severity . The PARS MASC provide secondary , dimensional measure anxiety .

Fear Conditioning &amp; Extinction Paradigm : Subjects participate laboratory test extinction training prior CBT order establish extinction learn potential predictive marker treatment outcome . Subjects expose two shape computer screen , one shape ( condition stimulus ( CS+ ) pair aversive sound ( unconditioned stimulus ) 38 % trial , whereas shape never pair aversive sound ( CS- ) 20 . A day later , individual undergo extinction training two condition stimulus repeatedly present without unconditioned stimulus . Extinction measure difference score skin conductance response CS+ CS- . Exposure Therapy Intervention : investigator offer participant 8 session exposure therapy intervention . Session one consist psychoeducation completion exposure hierarchy . Sessions 2-7 consist weekly gradual exposure session . Session 8 include review , relapse prevention referral additional treatment need . Assessment measure give completion exposure session assess individual difference symptom change relate exposure therapy . All treatment session videotape ensure fidelity treatment manual module . Data analysis plan : Investigators track monthly number participant screen enrolled determine feasibility large trial , well session attendance , study attrition , treatment adherence patient safety ass acceptability select measure intervention . Though pilot adequately power detect statistical significance , investigator execute preliminary test association performance extinction learn task treatment outcome , investigator assess age group differences extinction learn treatment outcome determine early proof concept .</detailed_description>
