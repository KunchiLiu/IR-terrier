	<detailed_description>Burden : Globally around 6.3 million child five year age die 2013 , two third occur low &amp; middle income country . Bangladesh one LMICs country high burden maternal neonatal mortality . In Bangladesh , considerable progress reduction child maternal mortality recent decade . From 1994 2014 under-5 mortality rate reduce 133 46 per 1000 live birth Bangladesh ; however , within timeframe neonatal mortality decline 52 28 per 1000 live birth . This slow decrease newborn death mean constitutes great share total under-5 death . At present , neonatal mortality account 74 % deaths infant 61 % child age less 5 year . Similarly , country able decline MMR 70 % 1990 2013 , 574 170 per 100,000 live birth , annual reduction rate 5.0 % . Such statistic highlight importance focus perinatal early postnatal period prevent maternal neonatal mortality . Knowledge gap : Safe motherhood promotion project ( SMPP ) five ( 5 yr ) year pilot project , launch July 2006 , Government Bangladesh ( GOB ) collaboration JICA . The aim project improve health status pregnant postpartum woman neonate . SMPP implement three link activity i.e. , advocacy central level , strengthen health facility empowerment community . Evaluation SMPP find positive change UN process indicator EmOC include meet need ( 31 % 55 % ) , case fatality rate ( &lt; 0.1 % ) skilled birth attendance rate ( 18 % 25 % ) . The major weakness previous assessment SMPP use before-after design without concurrent comparison area assessment lack population base mortality estimate , measure hospital case fatality rate . Hence , lack strong evidence regard impact project . Relevance : The propose project expect provide essential evidence GOB development partner help strong design valid evaluation process . It would help prioritizing , planning , scaling-up SMPNS intervention area Bangladesh inform develop country similar setting also . Hypothesis : Safe Motherhood Newborn Survival intervention package reduce neonatal mortality 25 % , comparison routine service Chandpur district , Bangladesh Methods : A community-based , cluster-randomized design use evaluate effectiveness integrate `` Safe Motherhood Newborn Health Promotion Package '' Chandpur district , Bangladesh . Both quantitative qualitative approach employ address primary secondary objective . Baseline , midterm end intervention household survey conduct use validate structured questionnaire ass coverage maternal &amp; newborn health intervention . Health facility assessment survey conduct periodically assess facility readiness utilization maternal neonatal health service participate health facility . Additionally , relevant data routine Health Management Information System ( HMIS ) regularly collect extract An ongoing investigating system place health facility identify document maternal near miss case . Qualitative data collect process documentation depth exploration implementation challenge contextual factor . Social capital measure quantitatively qualitatively assess non health impact intervention . Qualitative data collection method include stakeholder ' meeting , focus group discussion ( FGD ) , periodic in-depth assessment , social mapping participatory exercise . Outcome measures/variables : The primary outcome measure evaluation SMPNS intervention reduction neonatal mortality . In addition , change coverage utilization maternal &amp; newborn health service , cost effectiveness implementation intervention also measure .</detailed_description>
