	<brief_title>Pain Impact Chronic Pain Function After Total Knee Replacements</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>INTRODUCTION : - A Total Knee Replacement ( TKR ) arthroplasty ( TKA ) complex procedure require Orthopedic Surgeon make precise measurement skillfully remove diseased portion bone , order shape remain bone accommodate knee implant . Knee Replacement Surgery commonly perform people advance osteoarthritis consider conservative treatment exhaust . Oncologic TKRs different routine TKRs way former involves wide local resection bone soft tissue , range 10 20 cm , resection muscle like head ( ) biceps femoris , gastrocnemius muscle , intermuscular septum , joint capsule , etc . ensure negative margin along complete resection tumour , follow reconstruction almost length resect , restore function . The common indication oncologic TKR Osteogenic Sarcoma ( OGS ) around knee joint . The distal femur proximal tibia among common site primary bone tumor . OGS common bone cancer world child adolescent , eighth-most common form childhood cancer , account 4 % childhood cancer worldwide . In India , incidence varies 4.7 % 11.6 % , malignancy associate significant morbidity mortality . Additional treatment involve chemotherapy delay heal recovery patient . Surgery know risk factor development Chronic Post Surgical Pain ( CPSP ) per definition give Macrae Davies , define - Pain develop surgical procedure . - Pain least 2 month ' duration . - Other cause pain excluded ( e.g.- malignancy , infection , etc. ) . - Pain continue pre-existing pain problem exclude . CPSP well know risk factor many surgery like ( exclusive ) - - Mastectomy ( Incidence chronic pain = 11-57 % ) - Amputation ( 30-85 % ) - Inguinal hernia ( 5-63 % ) - Cholecystectomy ( 3-50 % ) CPSP develop surgical procedure increase intensity surgical procedure . Literature TKR surgery indicate osteoarthritis , report although many patient report good outcome total knee replacement , time recovery achieve , 10-34 % patient undergoing TKR osteoarthritis report moderate severe CPSP . In around 30 % patient CPSP , origin CPSP might neuropathic . Neuropathic pain severe adversely affect quality life patient . TKR may cause neuropathic pain postoperatively due local nerve damage , often infrapatellar branch saphenous nerve due local inflammation . Risk factor associate operation include increase duration surgery tourniquet time , revision surgery , TKA versus unicompartmental arthroplasty intraoperative nerve damage . Oncologic TKRs extensive include much morbid excision , consequently may presume similar great incidence CPSP . Some risk factor CPSP include follow ( exclusive ) - - Pain , moderate severe , lasting 1 month - Repeat surgery - Younger age ( adult ) - Surgical approach risk nerve damage - Neurotoxic chemotherapy Preoperative pain consistently find predictor persistent postsurgical pain , might reflect independent risk factor could well manifestation predispose factor . Tata Memorial Hospital , tertiary cancer institute 629 bed hospital conduct approximately 6000 surgery per year approximately 100 TKRs perform per year . Analgesia peri-operatively provide epidural infusion combination local anaesthetic opioid intravenous opioids non-steroidal anti-inflammatory analgesic paracetamol appropriate . Postoperatively , insert , epidural analgesia continue 3-4 day help mobilization &amp; physiotherapy . In absence epidural , around clock analgesic without opioid administer mean Intravenous Patient Controlled Analgesia ( IVPCA ) device institute . These patient visit acute pain service team address pain issue first 3 postoperative day sometimes longer . STUDY DESIGN : - Prospective Observational study METHODS MATERIALS : - After Institutional Review Board approval , adult patient schedule TKR surgery enrol study obtain informed consent 24 month period . However , interim analysis case complete 6 month follow 31st October , 2017 would analyze part co- principle investigator 's thesis . All consent patient assess pain preoperatively first 3 post-operative day , 1 , 4 6 month date surgery . Pain score assess use Numerical Rating Scale 3 day surgery . Pain manage Acute Pain Service team per standard management protocol . The Brief pain inventory ( BPI ) , ( short form translation , obtain permission MD Anderson ) , assess severity pain impact pain daily function administer patient language familiar , preoperatively , 1 , 4 6 month postoperatively . The BPI useful instrument ass severity pain impact pain daily function patient pain chronic disease , condition cancer , osteoarthritis low back pain , pain acute condition postoperative pain . The short form comprise nine question related severity pain , impact pain daily function , location pain , pain medication amount pain relief past 24 hour past week . It widely use validated several language world . The Musculoskeletal Tumour Society Score ( MSTS ) evaluate functional condition ( impairment ) complete tumour treatment estimate end 6 month date surgery . It calculate basis standardized physical examination physician . This clinical examination assess six criterion differs slightly upper low limb . For low limb , component pain , function , emotional acceptance treatment outcome , need walk aid , walk gait . For criterion , estimate make bad good parallel award point ( 0 5 ) . There thus numerical value six criterion . These six value add divide maximum possible number point ( 30 ) . The percentage value obtain multiply calculate point value 100 . The painDETECT questionnaire ( PD-Q ) quick , simple reliable screen tool identify likelihood neuropathic pain component patient neuropathic pain . This questionnaire prepared professional validate various language include Hindi Marathi . Its sensitivity specificity high screening questionnaire neuropathic pain , include Douleur Neuropathique 4 ( DN4 ) , Leeds Assessment Neuropathic Symptoms Signs ( LANNS ) , Neuropathic Pain Questionnaire ( NPQ ) ( Freynhagen et al 2006 ) . The PD-Q use identify neuropathic pain patient knee osteoarthritis ( Ohtori et al 2012 ) identify sensory proÔ¨Åles patient diabetic neuropathy postherpetic neuralgia ( Baron et al 2009 ) .This questionnaire administer tot patient preoperatively , 1 , 4 6 month surgery . Details postoperative chemotherapy radiation also obtain patient 's note electronic medical record . If patient follow say interval , pain score would obtain telephonically BPI PD-Q form prepay envelope would give discharge would duly fill post give address appropriate interval visit pain clinic . At 6th month follow , would request visit pain clinic assessment MSTS score complete BPI PD-Q . MEASUREMENTS : - - All demographic , preoperative , intraoperative postoperative data would collect investigator . - Demographic data include case , age , sex , ASA ( American Society Anesthesiologists ) grade . - Preoperative variable include pain score , preoperative analgesic , duration use , dose . - Intraoperative variable include duration surgery , tourniquet time , nerve muscle resection length bone resect . - Postoperative variable include median average bad pain score first 3 postoperative day , 1 , 4 6 month surgery . - Analgesics administer postoperatively , dose &amp; dose interval , impact daily function obtain BPI pre-operatively , 1 , 4 6 month postoperatively . - The painDETECT score identify neuropathic component pain , preoperatively 1 , 4 6 month surgery . - The MSTS score calculate physician obtain patient 's record 6th month surgery . STATISTICAL ANALYSIS : - The mention data present mean ( sd ) , median ( range ) , frequency ( percentage ) . Categorical data analyze use Chi-square test Fisher Exact test ( binary data ) . Continuous variable analyze use paired test Wilcoxon sign rank test per distribution data . Repeated measure ANOVA use pain score analysis . Pearson correlation coefficient use association . p-value &lt; 0.05 consider statistical significant .</detailed_description>
