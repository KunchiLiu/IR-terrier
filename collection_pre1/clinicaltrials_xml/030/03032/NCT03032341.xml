	<brief_summary>The purpose research study find mobility ( ability move around ) reliably assess family care giver caregiver take video base test patient . If study show mobility assess family caregiver , information use situation mobility measure directly patient . A total 60 patient 60 family/caregivers Wake Forest Baptist Medical Center take part study . Patients physical function assess use test use short movie clip assess mobility . Patients ask watch ten short ( ~10 second ) movie clip describe various task climb hill walk estimate perform task . The familymember/caregiver also ask answer question behalf patient . The family member/caregiver ask return take test next 1-14 day . The patient study one day . There intervention , observational .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Mobility Assessment Using Surrogates Elderly Participants</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>According U.S. Census Bureau projection , number person 65 year age old increase roughly 40 million year 2010 , 88.5 million 2050 , net increase 121 % . During time period , number person 85 year age old increase 227 % ; account nearly 5 % U.S. population . Mobility functional status important predictor outcomes rapidly grow elderly population . It show walk speed physical function , measure Short Physical Performance Battery ( SPPB ) predictor mortality community-dwelling old men woman . It also report gait speed predict incident disability community dwell elderly subject . In prior study , demonstrate , mobility , assess use animate video clip base assessment tool , Mobility Assessment Tool-short form ( MAT-sf ) predict postoperative complication , length stay nursing home placement elderly patient ( &gt; 69 ) undergo elective surgery require overnight hospitalization clinical practice use physical function mobility tool predict outcome . However , assessment always readily available , especially clinical situation acute illness injury occur without chance ass baseline status , acute myocardial infract , rapidly progress sepsis catastrophic trauma . In case , patient often sedate , intubate , alter mental status , unstable perform even non-invasive test . Although clinician researcher feel surrogate accurately assess patient ' baseline physical function mobility status , never test . The investigator hypothesize mobility assessment do surrogate , use MAT-sf high compatibility assessment do elderly patient . Surrogates define person spends &gt; 2 hour day 8 hour week patient accompany patient medical appointment . The investigator test hypothesis Preoperative Assessment Clinic since clinic see high volume elderly patient patient clinic tend caregiver appointment . Investigators enroll 20 patient poor mobility group ( MAT-sf &lt; 51.38 men &lt; 45.61 woman ) , 20 patient mid-mobility group ( 51.38 &lt; MAT-sf≤65.5 men 45.61≤MAT-sf &lt; 54.02 ) 20 patient high mobility group ( MAT-sf &gt; 65.5 men MAT-sf &gt; 54.02 woman ) total 60 patient one surrogate per patient total 120 unique participant . To assess mobility , participant instruct use Mobility Assessment Tool-short form ( MAT-sf ) . The MAT-sf 10-item computer base assessment mobility use animated video clip . The 10 item MAT-sf cover broad range functioning . The item include walk level ground , slow jog , walk outdoors uneven terrain , walk ramp without use handrail , step hurdle , ascend descend stair without use handrail , climb stair carry bag . The item previously select base individual response information curve derive Item Response Theory . Each item accompany animated video clip together responses question ( number minute , number time , yes/no ) . The test perform I-PAD score save exportable file . The time require test instruction examiner expect longer 5 minute . While patient complete MAT-sf assessment , surrogate direct separate room complete MAT-sf patient ( `` Do think Mr ** climb hill ? ) , interaction patient surrogate assessment . Investigators measure compatibility patients-surrogates mobility use MAT-sf also assess stability surrogate MAT-sf .</detailed_description>
