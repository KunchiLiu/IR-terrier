	<brief_summary>The investigator assess efficacy safety utilize high-intensity interval training stable heart failure patient functional outcome . Specifically , assessment baseline peak oxygen uptake peak cardiac output assess 8 week intense interval training . Measurements quality life assess training well number arrhythmic event train . The control group group follow moderate exercise training protocol similar period .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>High Intensity Interval Training Heart Failure</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Aerobic exercise training moderate intensity recommend safe effective stable outpatient chronic heart failure able participate improve physical conditioning . Emerging data suggest high-intensity exercise training select heart failure patient may achieve even great improvement functional capacity moderate intensity training lead good quality life . In study date , aerobic capacity , heart function increase well extent heart failure patient undergo eight-week high-intensity exercise program ( 32 exercise session ) compare standard care . The goal pilot study collect data safety efficacy high-intensity interval training stable heart failure patient demonstrate well physiological clinical outcome few long-term health care cost compare standard care . Twenty participant stable heart failure ( age range = 40 65 year age ) randomize two different group : standard care group , subject exercise 40 minute 40 60 % heart rate reserve ( HRR ) eight week ( 32 session ) ; high-intensity interval training group , subject perform four set 4-minutes &gt; 85 % HRR , three minute active rest interval , six week ( 32 session ) . The functional outcome measure cardiac function ( i.e . stroke volume , cardiac output , ejection fraction ) , pulmonary function ( diffuse capacity , lung volume , spirometry ) , exercise capacity ( peak oxygen uptake ) rest exercise eight week exercise training ( 32 session ) . Adverse event related exercise training session ( i.e . cardiac arrest , myocardial infarction exercise , within first hour afterward ) well arrhythmias record via Holter monitor 24-hrs post-exercise . Quality life also measure . The exercise training supervise Grady Hospital . This novel approach chance become impactful patient challenge current negative perception high-intensity exercise training patient population . The investigator anticipate study help reform current exercise guideline participant .</detailed_description>
