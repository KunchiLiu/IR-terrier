	<detailed_description>Numerous neuromuscular disorder ( NMD ) characterize weakness axial limb muscle also respiratory muscle upper airway involvement . Respiratory muscle weakness first manifest sleep-disordered breathing ( SDB ) . SDB neuromuscular disease mainly comprise alveolar hypoventilation upper airway collapse may also occur pharyngeal muscle tone impair neuromuscular weakness sleep . Diaphragmatic weakness myopathy hallmark advance obstructive pulmonary disease lead even great impairment gas exchange affect patient . Non-invasive ventilation ( NIV ) initiate patient diaphragm weakness significant SDB hypercapnic respiratory failure present . Indication criterion NIV include measurement spiromanometric parameter force vital capacity ( FVC ) , maximum inspiratory pressure ( MIP ) , sniff nasal inspiratory pressure ( SNIP ) . These measurement volitional , i. e. test result dependent individual patient effort may show intraindividual variance may properly reflect disease progression treatment effect , respectively . Associations volitional non-volitional method respiratory muscle strength test report mainly healthy individual scarcely patient specific NMD . Non-volitional test respiratory muscle strength include phrenic nerve conduction study , diaphragmatic ultrasound , magnetic stimulation phrenic nerve particular . Magnetic stimulation usually combine esophageal gastric manometry yield twitch transdiaphragmatic pressure closely reflect diaphragmatic strength . It desirable obtain validated data volitional non-volitional test respiratory muscle strength various NMD . Validation carry regard daytime hypercapnia nocturnal retention carbon dioxide latter often represent early manifestation respiratory muscle weakness . SDB often start long exertional dyspnea orthopnea develop . Since NIV one mainstays symptomatic treatment NMD advance obstructive lung disease , early recognition SDB crucial optimal patient care , many condition , life expectancy quality life may substantially increase NIV . In study , FVC , MIP , MEP SNIP test along non-volitional method diaphragmatic ultrasound apply order establish protocol may help reliably predict SDB need ventilatory support , respectively . Patients chronic obstructive pulmonary disease ( COPD ) develop flattening , shorten , weakness diaphragm . This due downward dislocation diaphragm also impairment contractile function , tissue structure , intracellular biochemistry . Respiratory muscle weakness COPD major clinical relevance since maximum inspiratory pressure independent predictor survival severely affect patient . In addition , hypercapnic respiratory failure due inspiratory muscle weakness associate morbidity mortality COPD . Direct comparison volitional non-volitional measure respiratory muscle function patient diaphragmatic weakness due neuromuscular disease patient COPD desirable . This approach may allow characterization `` impairment pattern '' probably specific either COPD certain neuromuscular disease , respectively .</detailed_description>
