	<brief_summary>Chemotherapy-induced peripheral neuropathy ( CIPN ) highly prevalent clinically meaningful side effect cancer treatment . It induce neurotoxic chemotherapeutic agent , cause severe sensory and/or motor deficit pain , altered sensation , reduce absent reflex , muscle weakness , reduce balance control , insecure gait , high risk fall . It associate significant disability poor recovery , reduce patient ' autonomy quality life also limit medical cancer therapy , subsequently may affect clinical outcome compromise survival . To date , CIPN prevent approved effective treatment option lack . Promising result regard CIPN recently achieve exercise . Own preliminary work reveal patient profit sensorimotor training ( SMT ) , experience significant relief CIPN induce symptom . In pilot study therefore also evaluated whole body vibration training , neuromuscular stimulating exercise intervention . Results suggest whole body vibration ( WBV ) feasible safe neuropathic cancer patient attenuate motor sensory deficit . We therefore propose two-armed , multicenter , randomize control trial ( RCT follow-up period ) , include 44 patient neurologically confirm CIPN , order evaluate effect WBV relevant symptom CIPN . Primary endpoint patient report reduction CIPN-related symptom ( FACT-GOG-Ntx ) . Secondary endpoint include compound muscle action potential , distal motor latency , conduction velocity , F-waves tibial peroneal nerve well antidromic sensory nerve conduction study sural nerve , feasibility , non-invasive electromyographic ( EMG ) activity mm . tibialis anterior , soleus , gastrocnemius medialis , rectus femoris , vastus medialis biceps femoris , peripheral deep sensitivity , proprioception , balance control well pain , quality life level physical activity . Patients assess 12 week intervention 12 week follow-up . Interim test perform 6 week intervention well every 3 week follow-up . We hypothesize individually tailor whole body vibration train reduce relevant symptom CIPN . Our result could contribute improve supportive care oncology , thereby enhance patient ' quality life coincidentally enable optimal medical therapy .</brief_summary>
