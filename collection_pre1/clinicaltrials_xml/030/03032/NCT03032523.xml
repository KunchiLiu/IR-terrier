	<brief_title>Detecting Neonatal Hypoglycemia Using Real-Time Continuous Glucose Monitoring ( CGM )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>A CGM subcutaneously insert trained staff healthy area skin calibrate accord manufacturer 's instruction . Blood glucose measurement take use blind study glucometer calibrate device . Calibration train study staff take place every 12 hour . Sensor insertion site monitor infection throughout course study nurse clinical staff train study staff need basis . At conclusion study , CGM remove assessed sign infection . Study duration 7 day patient admit hospital . Participants randomize 2 group . The control group blind CGM place duration study . The remote monitoring group blind clinical staff . This group CGM connect iPod sends continuous glucose data study phone monitor 24/7 study staff . If blood sugar level &lt; 46 mg/dl detect , infant first evaluate positioning could cause falsely low value . If infant re-positioned CGM continue show blood sugar level &lt; 46 mg/dl , study staff prompt nurse take care patient obtain capillary glucose value verify low blood sugar treat deem appropriate clinical team . We evaluate number hypoglycemic event occur blind CGM group versus number occur remote monitoring group assess CGM able sensitively detect low blood sugar infants current hospital standard care measure .</detailed_description>
