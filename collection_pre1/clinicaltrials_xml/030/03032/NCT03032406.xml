	<criteria>Histologicallyconfirmed , primary , invasive breast cancer diagnose within 5 year study entry . Qualifying risk status , diagnosis utilizing receptor test ASCO/CAP guideline , meet one following : Histologically positive axillary lymph node Primary tumor ER/PR/Her2 negative Primary tumor ER+/Her2 negative/Lymph node negative Breast Cancer Recurrence Score ≥ 25 per Genomic Health Oncotype DX breast cancer test Evidence residual disease breast pathological assessment neoadjuvant chemotherapy . Patients must complete primary therapy ( definitive surgery , ( neo ) adjuvant chemotherapy adjuvant radiation and/or Her2directed therapy ) index malignancy least 4 week prior study entry . All prior treatmentrelated toxicity must resolve prior study enrollment . Concurrent receipt adjuvant endocrine bone modify agent allow per standard care guideline . Bone marrow aspirate completion therapy demonstrate detectable DTCs ( via IHC ) No evidence recurrent local distant breast cancer physical examination , blood test ( CBC , LFTs , Alk Phos ) , symptomdirected imaging , per NCCN guideline . Age ≥ 18 year ECOG performance status 2 No contraindication study medication uncontrolled medical illness . Adequate bone marrow function show : ANC ≥ 1.5 x 109/L , Platelets ≥ 100 x 109/L , Hb &gt; 9 g/dL Adequate liver function show : Serum bilirubin ≤ 1.5 x ULN , ALT AST ≤ 2.5 x ULN , INR ≤1.5 Anticoagulation allow target INR ≤ 1.5 stable dose warfarin stable dose anticoagulant &gt; 2 week time randomization . For patient therapeutic anticoagulant , medication must clinically hold periprocedure ( bone marrow aspirate ) per standard clinical management . Adequate renal function : serum creatinine ≤ 2.0 x ULN creatinine clearance ( CrCl ) ≥ 30mL/min obtain within 28 day prior registration . A calculated creatinine clearance CockcroftGault Formula acceptable lieu measure value . Fasting serum cholesterol ≤300 mg/dL OR ≤7.75 mmol/L AND fast triglyceride ≤ 2.5 x ULN . NOTE : In case one threshold exceed , patient include initiation appropriate lipid lower medication . Ability provide inform consent Exclusion criterion Concurrent enrollment another investigational therapy Prior treatment mTOR inhibitor ( sirolimus , temsirolimus , everolimus ) . Known hypersensitivity Everolimus rapamycins ( sirolimus , temsirolimus ) excipients . Patients receive chronic , high dose systemic treatment corticosteroid define : chronic use cortisone &gt; 50mg ; hydrocortisone &gt; 40mg , prednisone &gt; 10mg , methylprednisone &gt; 8mg dexamethasone &gt; 1.5mg ; another immunosuppressive agent . Topical inhale corticosteroid allow . Patients receive immunization attenuate live vaccine within one week study entry study period . Patients severe and/or uncontrolled medical condition condition could affect participation study include : Symptomatic congestive heart failure New York heart Association Class III IV Unstable angina pectoris , myocardial infarction within 6 month start study drug , serious uncontrolled cardiac arrhythmia clinically significant cardiac disease Severely impaired lung function previously document spirometry DLCO 50 % normal predict value and/or 02 saturation 88 % less rest room air Uncontrolled diabetes define fast serum glucose &gt; 1.5 x ULN Active ( acute chronic ) uncontrolled severe infection Liver disease cirrhosis , chronic active hepatitis chronic persistent hepatitis A known history HIV seropositivity report patient Impairment gastrointestinal function gastrointestinal disease may significantly alter absorption EVE ( e.g. , ulcerative disease , uncontrolled nausea , vomit , diarrhea , malabsorption syndrome small bowel resection ) Patients active , bleed diathesis Active latent , untreated Hepatitis B C. A detailed assessment Hepatitis B/C medical history risk factor must do screening patient . HBV DNA HCV RNA PCR test require screening patient positive medical history base risk factor and/or confirmation prior HBV/HCV infection . Female patient pregnant breast feeding , adult reproductive potential use effective birth control method . If barrier contraceptive use , must continue throughout trial 8 week stop study drug , sex . Hormonal contraceptives acceptable sole method contraception . ( Women childbearing potential must negative urine serum pregnancy test within 7 day prior administration EVE . )</criteria>
