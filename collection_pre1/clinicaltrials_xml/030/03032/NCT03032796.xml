	<detailed_description>Cognitive control function ( e.g . attention , work memory , goal-management ) dictate ability learn accomplish select behavioral goal , deficiency process found range mental illness . The primary goal project evidence potential synergistic benefit cognitive control process use video game ( `` Body-Brain Trainer '' , BBT ) integrate cognitive physical challenge complimentary fashion . Healthy adult recruit longitudinal experiment randomly assign one four study group : 1 ) BBT , 2 ) `` Brain Training '' ( BBT play gamepad controller ) , 3 ) `` Body Training '' ( BBT without cognitive demand ) , 4 ) expectancy match placebo control group . Individuals engage eight week train within Neuroscape Laboratory , pre- post-training assessment evaluate physical , cognitive , neural measure . The completion project result sophisticate understanding integration cognitive physical training potentially impact cognitive control process , set stage effective intervention mental illness learning-related impairment .</detailed_description>
