	<criteria>1 . Male female participant either : 1 . Pyelonephritis normal urinary tract anatomy ( approximately 50 % total population ) , 2. cUTI least one follow condition associate risk develop cUTI : Indwelling urinary catheter Urinary retention ( least approximately 100 milliliter ( mL ) residual urine voiding ) History neurogenic bladder Partial obstructive uropathy ( example , nephrolithiasis , bladder stone , ureteral stricture ) Azotemia renal origin ( congestive heart failure [ CHF ] volume relate ) serum blood urea nitrogen [ BUN ] elevate ( &gt; 20 milligram [ mg ] /deciliters [ dL ] ) serum BUN : creatinine ratio &lt; 15 Surgically modify abnormal urinary tract anatomy ( example , bladder diverticulum , redundant urine collection system ) except urinary tract surgery within last 30 day ( place stent catheter consider surgical modification ) 2 . At least 18 year age time consent 3 . Able provide inform consent 4 . At least two follow sign symptom : 1 . Chills , rigor , warmth associate fever hypothermia 2 . Flank pain ( pyelonephritis ) pelvic pain ( cUTI ) 3 . Nausea vomit 4 . Dysuria , urinary frequency , urinary urgency 5 . Costovertebral angle tenderness physical examination 5 . Urine specimen evidence pyuria 1 . Dipstick analysis positive leukocyte esterase ( positive result least `` ++ '' indicate urine dipstick provide laboratory kit ) , 2 . ≥10 white blood cell ( WBCs ) per cubic millimeter , 3 . ≥10 WBCs per high power field 6 . If male : must agree use effective barrier method contraception ( example , condom ) study 14 day follow last dose sexually active female childbearing potential 7 . If female , pregnant nursing , childbearing potential : must commit either use least two medically accept , effective method birth control ( example , condom , spermicidal gel , oral contraceptive , indwell intrauterine device , hormonal implant /patch , injection , approve cervical ring ) study drug dose 14 day follow last study drug dose practice sexual abstinence 1 . Use systemic antibiotic effective cUTI within 72 hour prior enrollment except follow circumstance : 1 . Participants suspect acute cUTI receive single dose effective nonstudy antibiotic acute cUTI 2 . Signs symptom cUTI develop antibiotic another indication 2 . History ertapenemresistant urinary tract infection within 1 year enrollment 3 . Likely require &gt; 10 day antibiotic treatment cure acute cUTI likely receive ongoing antibacterial drug prophylaxis prior Follow Up visit ( 2128 day randomization ) [ example , participant chronic vesiculoureteral reflux ] 4 . Unlikely survive least duration study 5 . Hypotension , systolic blood pressure ≤90 millimeter mercury [ mmHg ] 6 . Complicated pyelonephritis complete obstruction know suspect renal perinephric abscess , emphysematous pyelonephritis , Any condition likely require surgery achieve cure ( include procedure place catheter obtain diagnosis ) 7 . Known suspected urinary fungal infection 8 . Uncomplicated low urinary tract infection 9 . Suspected confirm active prostatitis , currently treatment prostatitis 10 . High risk cUTI due Pseudomonas ( example , history prior cUTIs due Pseudomonas , ≥20 mg day prednisone equivalent steroid , risk factor perceive Investigator ) 11 . History renal transplantation 12 . Presence ileal loop 13 . Any history trauma pelvis urinary tract occur within 30 day screen 14 . Indwelling urinary catheter present screen expect remove replace within 72 hour enrollment ( example , nephrostomy tube , stent , urethral suprapubic catheter ) . 15 . Known concomitant human immunodeficiency virus ( HIV ) infection CD4 count 200 within last six month , acquire immune deficiency syndrome ( AIDS ) define diagnosis within last six month 16 . Neutropenia ( Absolute neutrophil count &lt; 1,000 polymorphonuclear leukocyte [ PMNs ] /microliters [ µL ] ) 17 . Participation study experimental drug device within 30 day prior enrollment 18 . Known suspected hypersensitivity tetracycline , carbapenems , βlactams 19 . History seizures 20 . Any unstable clinically significant concurrent medical condition ( example , immunosuppressive therapy , chemotherapy , class IV heart lung disease , end stage renal disease , require hemodialysis ) would , opinion Investigator , jeopardize safety participant and/or compliance protocol</criteria>
