	<brief_summary>The purpose study determine patient shoulder pain MRI-confirmed rotator cuff tendinosis , pain function improve treated daily use dynamic elastic garment along corticosteroid injection , compare patient receive corticosteroid injection alone . To knowledge first study evaluate use dynamic elastic garment shoulder . - Group A : Control group , receive ultrasound-guided corticosteroid injection alone . - Group B : Intervention , ultrasound-guided corticosteroid injection schedule use dynamic elastic garment . Up 60 patient participate randomize study , male female age 18 89 year age . Subjects complete form ; SF-36 , ASES , Simple Shoulder test , take place initial visit Then 4 week 6 week visit . This single center study , investigator initiate . 60 subject participate study Loma Linda University .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Dynamic Elastic Garment ( DEG ) Patients With Rotator Cuff Tendinopathy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Shoulder pain common complaint report prevalence 7-26 % general population ( 1 ) . The common etiology shoulder pain primary care set rotator cuff disease ( 2-4 ) , term encompasses several separate diagnosis . In orthopaedic practice , rotator cuff disease include tendinosis tendinitis supraspinatus , infraspinatus , subscapularis , teres minor tendon , subacromial impingement without bursitis , bicipital tendinitis , partial complete rotator cuff tear . This study specifically include patient tendinosis tendinitis rotator cuff , use term rotator cuff tendinopathy . There myriad treatment option rotator cuff tendinopathy ; conservative measure NSAIDs , corticosteroid injection , physiotherapy invasive measure include arthroscopic decompression subacromial impingement syndrome . While orthopaedic surgeon employ combination physiotherapy , NSAIDs , corticosteroid injection pain relief , evidence support efficacy provide long-term pain relief functional improvement limit . Thus , clinical equipoise exist treat rotator cuff tendinopathy lead physician pursue less traditional modality . Some gain notoriety hyperthermia , extracorporeal shock-wave treatment , electrotherapy modality recently , non-elastic tap elastic kinesiology tap . Dynamic elastic garment relatively new product use improve posture provide shoulder lumbar support . Abnormal scapular motion , particularly scapular protraction , show reduce subacromial width place undue strain rotator cuff . These garment utilize elastic band place specific location provide postural support proprioceptive feedback patient . This may help restore normal shoulder kinematics subsequently provide relief shoulder symptom . Patients MRI-confirmed tendinosis tendinopathy rotator cuff improve shoulder pain relief outcome score treat schedule use dynamic- elastic garment corticosteroid injection compare patient receive corticosteroid injection alone .</detailed_description>
