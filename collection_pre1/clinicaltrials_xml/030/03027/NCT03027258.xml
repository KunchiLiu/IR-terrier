	<brief_title>Point-of-Delivery Prenatal Test Results Through mHealth Improve Birth Outcome</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The investigator develop test feasibility , acceptability , usability web-based database medical decision model capture result HIV , Hepatitis B virus ( HBV ) sickle cell genotype obtain participant Healthy Beginning Initiative ( HBI ) program ; store data secure , web-based database ; encrypt data `` smart card '' give participant , make data available point-of-delivery use cell-phone application read `` smart card '' . Data web-based database also access directly use cell phone application . Evidence exist clinician maternal record available point delivery , likely initiate antiretroviral prophylaxis HIV-exposed infant , administer first dose hepatitis B vaccine 24 hour infant born woman positive hepatitis B surface antigen screen infant born mother sickle cell trait allow early identification initiation penicillin prophylaxis infant sickle cell disease . The ultimate endpoint Phase III trial reduction mortality among child sickle cell disease prevention perinatal transmission HIV HBV infection . This proposal collaboration among Sunrise Foundation ( local PEPFAR-supported partner Nigeria ) ; University Illinois Urbana-Champaign ( concept mapping , focus group key informant interview ) ; Xavier University ( data management analysis ) University Nevada , Las Vegas ( overall oversight evaluation program effectiveness ) .</detailed_description>
