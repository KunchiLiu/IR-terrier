	<brief_summary>Background : Researchers want good understand brain process related fear anxiety . They want find transcranial magnetic stimulation ( TMS ) , type brain stimulation , reduce anxiety . Objective : To see TMS affect fear anxiety memory attention task . Eligibility : Healthy people age 18 50 right-handed Design : Participants screen another protocol . Participants pilot study 1 visit . This include : Urine test Questionnaires mood think Shock startle workup : Electrodes tap wrist finger . Participants shock find level shock uncomfortable tolerable . They hear loud , sudden noise headphone . TMS : A coil hold scalp . A magnetic field stimulate brain . Sometimes might receive fake TMS . This feels real TMS . They perform simple task . Participants main study 2 visit within 2 week . The first visit include : Urine test Questionnaires mood think MRI : Participants lie table slide scanner . They scanner 1 hour . A computer screen scanner tell perform simple task . The second visit include : Shock startle workup TMS</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Objective : To determine effect non-invasive brain stimulation anxiety anxiety-cognition interaction healthy subject . Toward aim test effect transcranial magnetic stimulation ( TMS ) two outcome measure : 1 ) Fear anxiety threat predictable unpredictable shock ( NPU threat test ) , 2 ) Working memory ( WM ) relate anxiety downregulation perform Sternberg WM task threat shock . Study population : The study population consist 126 healthy volunteer age 18-50 . Design : This study consist two outpatient visit ( 1 MRI , 1 TMS visit ) . In protocol explore effect TMS two sub-studies second study visit . The two sub-studies contain two separate task ( NPU Sternberg ) study visit . The first visit ( MRI ) consist procedure sub-studies . Each subject assign one sub-studies . Sternberg Task : Expose subject active sham TMS right dlPFC Sternberg WM task . Subjects maintain series letter WM brief interval block safety threat shock . NPU Task : Expose subject active sham TMS right dlPFC NPU threat test . Subjects expose block either 1 ) safe shock ( neutral ) , 2 ) risk shock deliver cue ( predictable ) , 3 ) risk shock present randomly ( unpredictable ) . Outcome measure : In study primary outcome measure anxiety-potentiated startle ( APS ) , increase startle magnitude period threat compare period safety . We expect active , sham TMS increase activity dlPFC , therefore reduce APS study .</detailed_description>
	<criteria>INCLUSION CRITERIA : Ages 1850 Subjects able give consent Right hand EXCLUSION CRITERIA : NonEnglish speak individual Any significant medical neurological problem ( e.g . cardiovascular illness , respiratory illness , neurological illness , seizure , etc . ) Current past Axis I psychiatric disorder ( ) identify Structured Clinical Interview DSMIV , nonpatient edition ( SCIDnp ) Active history active suicidal ideation . Evidence firstdegree relative history psychosis bipolar disorder ; specifically , participant know diagnosis treatment order confirm presence disorder . Alcohol/drug problem past year lifetime alcohol drug dependence accord Structured Clinical Interview DSMIV . Current use medication act histamine ( i.e . diphenhydramine ) , dopamine ( methylphenidate ) , norepinephrine ( buproprion ) , serotonin ( sertraline ) , acetylcholine ( amitryptiline ) receptor . Subjects exclude basis either 1 ) take medication chronic basis , 2 ) take drug within 5 halflives drug metabolism , determine medical professional time screen . History seizure ( childhood febrile seizures acceptable subject may include study ) , History epilepsy self first degree relative , stroke , brain surgery , head injury , cranial metal implant , know structural brain lesion . Increased risk seizure reason , include prior diagnosis increase intracranial pressure ( large infarction trauma ) , currently take medication lower seizure threshold ( table ) . Pregnancy , positive pregnancy test . Neurological syndrome arm ( e.g. , carpal tunnel syndrome , cubital tunnel syndrome , etc . ) Positive urine toxicology screen screen visit . IQ &lt; 80 Employee staff NIMH immediate family member NIMH employee , staff , NIMH contractor . Any medical condition increase risk fMRI TMS : Any metal body would make MRI scan unsafe , pacemaker , stimulators , pump , aneurysm clip , metallic prosthesis , artificial heart valve , cochlear implant shrapnel fragment , welder metal worker , since may small metal fragment eye . Participants uncomfortable small close space ( claustrophobia ) would feel uncomfortable MRI machine Patients difficulty lie flat back 60 min scanner Any sort medical implant ( pacemaker , implanted pump , stimulator , cochlear implant , etc . ) History hearing loss</criteria>
