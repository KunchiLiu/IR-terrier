	<brief_summary>This prospective randomized control trial patient schedule undergo laparoscopic hysterectomy would allocate one two group : Paracervical block local anesthetic ( bupivacaine 0.5 % ) , placebo . This would achieve use block randomization . The intervention would perform patient general anesthesia , prior start surgery . Patients would consent office preoperative area ( receive sedative ) . As far intervention , would consist inject 5 mL 0.5 % bupivacaine cervical stroma 3 9 o'clock , standard technique para-cervical block . The remainder procedure continue regular fashion . Alternatively , patient control group inject 5 mL normal saline . The surgeon would blind patient allocation . Research staff previously prepared formulation ( saline bupivacaine ) send operating room prior begin procedure depend assign group . At end case , pain assess use visual analogue scale range 0 10 one research also blind group . This do 30 60 minute surgical stop time . Additional pain control postanesthesia care unit ( PACU ) standardize patient . Hypothesis : Performing para-cervical block local anesthetic prior laparoscopic hysterectomy significantly reduce pain procedure</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Para-cervical Block Prior Laparoscopic Hysterectomy Adjuvant Treatment Reduce Postoperative Pain .</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Specific aim : -Determine infiltrate cervical stroma local anesthetic prior perform hysterectomy reduce postoperative pain score , hence increase patient satisfaction . Secondary aim : - Determine difference baseline pain depend additional procedure perform , response paracervical block . - Determine difference response paracervical block base history cesarean delivery uterine weight . Background/Significance : Hysterectomy one common surgical procedure perform United States , 600,000 do annually . Over last decade , major change regard surgical approach utilize . With advent laparoscopy robotic surgery , rate procedure do vaginally abdominally decrease significantly . One major driver change demand faster recovery decrease postoperative discomfort . Additionally , several adjuvant method TAP ( transverse abdominal plain ) block , ERAS ( expedite recovery surgery ) pathway , etc . develop order minimize pain surgery hence increase patient satisfaction . Paracervical block particular technique evaluate multiple study way reduce pain vaginal surgery . Studies successful demonstrate improvement pain score type procedure . However , knowledge , never follow-up evaluate method laparoscopic approach , without robotic assistance . The rationale technique may beneficial hysterectomy infiltrate cervical stroma local anesthetic , diffuse towards pelvic sidewall via lymphatic capillary system , would allow anesthetic agent come direct contact nerve plexus innervate pelvic structure . Safety technique proven year , give widely use office procedure involve manipulation cervix . Although much focus regard reduce postoperative pain center abdominal wall port site , undeniable significant portion pain actually arise pelvic surgical site ; particularly since laparoscopic trocars become small , result less trauma . Our aim determine infiltrate cervical stroma local anesthetic prior perform hysterectomy reduce postoperative pain score , hence increase patient satisfaction . Methods Study design This prospective randomized control trial patient schedule undergo laparoscopic hysterectomy would allocate one two group : Paracervical block local anesthetic ( bupivacaine 0.5 % ) , placebo . This would achieve use block randomization . The intervention would perform patient general anesthesia , prior start surgery . Patients would consent office preoperative area ( receive sedative ) . As far intervention , would consist inject 10 mL 0.5 % bupivacaine cervical stroma 3 9 o'clock , standard technique para-cervical block . The remainder procedure continue regular fashion . Alternatively , patient control group inject 10 mL normal saline . The surgeon would blind patient allocation . The formulation ( saline bupivacaine ) previously prepared syringe operating room member research time prior beginning procedure . At end case , pain assess use visual analogue scale range 0 10 ( Wong-Baker face - appendix 1 ) one research also blind group . This do 30 60 minute surgical stop time . Additional pain control PACU standardize patient . Study Subjects Subjects select base mainly fact undergoing hysterectomy . Sample Size Investigators expect detect 25 % reduction pain report visual analogue scale ( VAS ) . Based previous publication , determine mean VAS pain score laparoscopic hysterectomy 5 standard deviation 1.5 . In order detect expect change propose intervention , significance level 5 % power 80 % , sample 46 patient require . Data Collection Data point collect follow : - Age - BMI - Operating time - History cesarean delivery - Preoperative indication surgery ( pain , prolapse , tumor , bleeding , etc ) - Procedures perform ( ovaries/tubes remove , robotic assistance use , additional procedure exception exclusion criterion perform ) . - Specimen weight - Uterine pathology - Pain score 30 minute ( see appendix 1 Wong-Baker scale ) - Pain score 60 minute - Number day hospital ( zero discharge same-day ) Data Handling A master key generate randomization . It contain patient initial medical record number , individual code . Only primary investigator access master key . A separate de-identified database use individual code index use collection data point . The data collect day surgery ( baseline characteristic , operate time , pain score , etc ) collect day use standardize form ( appendix 2 ) . This late transfer de-identified database . Using master key , investigator research pathology report available complete final data point ( uterine weight , histology , etc ) . The data-collection sheet destroy soon transfer de-identified database . Data Analysis Investigators use T-Student test assure group homogenous age , BMI , operate time , history cesarean delivery , uterine weight . ChiSquare Ancova analysis utilized determine significant difference report pain score group . Investigators also stratify subject base uterine weight , history cesarean delivery , additional procedure , etc . determine effect report pain score . Time Frame Investigators expect able consent enroll least two patient per week ( average range hysterectomy procedure per week surgeon participate 5-10 ) . Investigators expect data collection phase span 30 week approximately . Strength/Innovation Patient satisfaction center point today 's healthcare . Faster recovery less discomfort standard care , may also translate major economic advantage , less narcotic use decrease rate postoperative admission . Using technique adjuvant treatment pain laparoscopic hysterectomy never explore . There data publish similar procedure , demonstrate clear benefit . If study demonstrate significant improvement pain score , potential change standard care pain control hysterectomy procedure . Limitations The main confounding factor difference operate style surgeon baseline surgical characteristic ( large uterus may require dissection tissue manipulation , etc. ) . To control investigator recruit patient 3 surgeon similar operating technique . In addition , investigator document operating time specimen weight , use compare group assure homogeneous potential confounders . Further analysis also make specifically stratify data base characteristic . Risks The risk procedure minimal . Regarding possible adverse reaction local anesthetic , additional risk give already routinely administer surgery . Patients screen confirm history allergy medication . Possible reaction include hypotension , bradycardia , headache , tremor , etc . The paracervical block routinely perform office set invasive procedure involve cervix , risk minimal , similar involve subdermal injection . Possible risk include bleed injection site . There also potential risk accidental disclosure health information collect . Benefits This study may find new method improve postoperative analgesia patient undergo minimally invasive hysterectomy procedure may lead less narcotic use , faster discharge hospital , great satisfaction . Costs There additional cost . Local anesthetic saline product routinely use laparoscopic hysterectomy surgery . The additional operating time would take perform block also negligible , since procedure accomplish less 2 minute .</detailed_description>
