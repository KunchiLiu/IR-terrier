	<brief_summary>The diagnosis liver fibrosis lesion remain important issue patient chronic liver disease . The early detection fibrosis important determine disease progression postpone evolution chronic hepatitis cirrhosis via implementation prompt specific treatment . However , chronic liver disease remain asymptomatic long time , numerous cirrhotic patient diagnose belatedly , life-threatening complication start appear . Noninvasive method liver fibrosis diagnosis develop last decade . In set , blood fibrosis test transient elastography show accurate , commonly use first-intention test liver fibrosis diagnosis chronic liver disease . However , test usually perform hepatologist patient refer follow appearance symptom suggestive chronic liver disease . Thus number patient diagnose early new tool , period symptom start appear preventative measure may particularly beneficial , remain quite low relation prevalence disease . This prevalence estimate 0.5 2.8 % general population . Many study identify value hemodynamic morphological ultrasound parameter provide information liver fibrosis degree . Moreover , abdominal ultrasound widely use various symptom , thus could excellent way detect patient sign evoke liver fibrosis cirrhosis , could refer liver specialist confirmation diagnosis blood fibrosis test and/or transient elastography . To feasible nonspecific US examination , radiologist , sign easy quick collect . Addition quick measure hepatic stiffness could increase screen interest ultrasound examination . The main aim present study thus validate 3 simple US sign patient refer ultrasound abdominal examination reason suspicion liver disease .</brief_summary>
