	<brief_title>Methods Detect Liver Fibrosis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>While liver biopsy still consider gold standard diagnose assess presence degree liver fibrosis inflammation , disadvantage include potential sampling error risk complication , include life-threatening bleeding . New image modality MR Elastography , T1 mapping , T2 mapping , T1 rho , magnetization transfer allow rapid , non-invasive evaluation liver parenchymal characteristic may able detect quantify parenchymal fibrosis alleviate need biopsy . To date , quantitative performance different technique extensively study . This study single-center trial non-invasive MR image technique aim detect measure liver fibrosis . Once optimize , technology may later deploy hypothesis drive research study and/or routine clinical exam pediatric population CCHMC and/or part multi-center study specific IRB approval project . To assess relative performance technique , correlation across technique , reproducibility across range fibrosis , 32 subject enrol preliminary study sub-divided 4 group ( Group 1 : Healthy/ Normal control ; Group 2 : F1/F2 fibrosis determine prior biopsy ( low grade fibrosis group ) ; Group 3 : F3/F4 fibrosis determine prior biopsy ( high grade fibrosis group ) , Group 4 : Hepatic steatosis fibrosis ( NAFLD group ) ) . 8 healthy subject without know suspect liver disease enrol normal control . 8 subject know fibrosis base liver biopsy within last 6 month enrol Group 2 Group 3 ( total = 16 ) . 8 subject know hepatic steatosis liver fibrosis base liver biopsy within last 6 month enrol Group 4 .</detailed_description>
