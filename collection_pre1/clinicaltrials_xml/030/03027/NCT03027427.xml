	<brief_summary>Background : Certain stomach cancer rare , high mortality rate . Researchers want learn gastric ( stomach ) tumor . In study , want collect data people stomach cancer risk get . This data use see people study . Objective : To study tissue stomach tumor find people eligible study gastric cancer . Eligibility : Adults least 18 year old may stomach cancer , lesion may relate stomach cancer , inherit disorder lead stomach cancer . Design : Participants screen : Medical history Physical exam Blood urine test Heart test Scans ultrasound . For scan , participant lie machine take picture . For scan , swallow inject small amount radioactive material . Special camera show material body . Tumor sample take needle surgery Some participant endoscopy . A long , flexible tube camera insert mouth stomach . The tube collect tissue stomach . Some participant may follow-up visit . Some may invite join study . Others contact phone see .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Background : - Greater 90 % gastric tumor epithelial origin classify adenocarcinoma ; remainder include GIST , carcinoid lymphoma - Gastric adenocarcinoma rare United States ( incidence 7.4 per 100,000 ) - Mortality rate high estimate 5-year overall survival 25 % - 30 % - Up 3 % gastric adenocarcinoma occur part heritable cancer syndrome - Molecular sub-classification gastric adenocarcinoma report , however translation finding clinical management patient yet occur Objectives : - To permit clinical laboratory evaluation molecular profile tumor tissue patient gastric malignancy non-invasive ( neoplastic ) condition - Assess eligibility enrollment study gastric cancer conduct CCR - To allow long-term follow patient gastric tumor , heritable gastric malignancy syndrome , support clinical preclinical research particularly related molecular alteration gastric tumor response therapy Eligibility : - Patients histologically cytologically confirm malignant lesion non-invasive ( neoplastic ) condition stomach - Patients suspicious lesion yet confirm , consider likely related stomach pending evaluation - Patients confirmation , suspicion , heritable gastric malignancy disorder - Age great equal 18 year . Design : - This protocol design facilitate clinical evaluation , molecular tumor profiling , long-term follow patient gastric tumor - Patients screen clinical evaluation perform determine eligibility CCR trial gastric tumor - No investigational treatment administer procedure do research purpose protocol . - No investigational treatment administer protocol . - It anticipate protocol enroll maximum 250 patient .</detailed_description>
