	<brief_title>Outcomes Study Patients Receiving Aspirin With Mechanical Compression Devices Versus Aspirin Alone Following Knee Hip Arthroplasty</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Venous thromboembolism ( VTE ) , include deep vein thrombosis ( DVT ) pulmonary embolism ( PE ) , common complication occur association knee hip arthroplasty procedure due activation clot cascade bone intramedullary canal preparation.DVT rate range 4 % 15 % PE rate range 0.83 % 3 % report , fatal PE rate reduce use postoperative anticoagulation . The high risk thromboembolic disease lead recommendation pharmacoprophylaxis consider routinely . â€¢ The combination short duration outpatient anticoagulation , early mobilization , mechanical prophylaxis recently study institution ( Barnes-Jewish Hospital ) effective prophylaxis VTE . Current American College Chest Physician ( ACCP ) guideline recommend long duration outpatient anticoagulation follow TKA / THA surgery may reduce risk VTE . Shorter patient hospitalization earlier discharge require outpatient VTE prophylaxis regimen simple , effective , easy monitor , predictable , high patient compliance . Currently , `` routine '' risk patient receive combination ASA 325mg BID ( twice daily ) period 6 week , portable , mobile pneumatic compression device ( MCDs ) period 10 day post- surgery.The study test see whether use ASA alone equally effective versus use ASA MCDs `` routine '' risk patient follow total joint arthroplasty.Patients enrol fpr 6 month follow surgery , data collection occur pre-surgery , 14 day surgery , 4-8 wk visit finally , 6 month post surgery . We evaluate state outcomes 6 month period .</detailed_description>
