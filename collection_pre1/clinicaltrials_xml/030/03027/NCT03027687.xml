	<brief_summary>Bilateral ( leave cathodal/ right anodal ) transcranial Direct Current Stimulation ( tDCS ) dorsolateral prefrontal cortex ( DLPFC ) seem reduce crave increase time till smoke first cigarette intervention . More interesting however , study whether actual cigarette consumption decrease repetitive tDCS . The current study explore mean EMA large sample 60 smoker . Participants receive twice daily session real tDCS sham three day one week . Furthermore , electrophysiological response ( ERPs ) measure baseline , one day last tDCS session three month follow study work mechanism behind effect tDCS .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Effects Repetitive tDCS Cigarette Consumption : EMA EEG Study</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The propose experiment double-blind randomize placebo-controlled trial . 60 smoker randomly assign two condition , namely tDCS sham ( placebo ) . Participants receive real tDCS sham three day one week . The intervention contain twice daily session 13 minute interval 20 min . Moreover , first treatment day day treatment week , participant complete number questionnaire , perform two psychological task ( gamble task Go/NoGo task ) . During task , event-related potential record mean EEG . After three month , participant ask return fill questionnaires perform psychological task , measure last effect tDCS . During last session , event-related potential also record . In addition , carbon monoxide level measure day subject perform task . EMA : For three week , start week tDCS treatment , participant ask log every cigarette smoke one . During week , participant complete EMA questionnaire mobile phone cigarette consumption , craving , affect take approximately 5 minute . The EMA questionnaire present four time daily quasi-random basis . Finally , end-of-day assessment participant possibility indicate miss cigarette . At three month follow-up , participant ask undergo EMA procedure one week , study lasting effect tDCS .</detailed_description>
