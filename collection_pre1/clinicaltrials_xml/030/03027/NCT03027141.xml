	<brief_summary>The purpose propose study use functional magnetic resonance imaging ( fMRI ) investigate change facial appearance initially represent brain circuit alters time , new face become recognize `` '' . Investigators try identify area brain responsible processing store information self-facial recognition ; Examine area brain respond image `` self '' `` non-self '' ; Investigate brain responds , time , change facial recognition , particularly time point : ) prior facial injury , ii ) post-injury prior facial transplantation , iii ) receive facial transplantation .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Self-Face Recognition After Face Transplantation</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Before surgery , investigator compare activity brain participant look pre-injury injured face activity look person face familiar . This identify whether difference brain respond patient view current facial appearance view face facial disfigurement . Investigators scan patient post-operatively transplant team deem patient ready ; depend reduction post-operative swelling , improve communication treatment team , patient psychological status . Activity brain compare participant look picture familiar person , picture pre-injury , pre-transplant disfigure face picture post-transplant facial appearance . Participants scan , least two month later , set stimulus . Activity brain compare participant look pre-transplant disfigured face new face , compare activity look familiar . This allow investigator see difference brain respond new facial appearance time .</detailed_description>
	<criteria>Patients suffer severe facial disfigurement warrant facial transplantation evaluate approved transplantation , include . Must able enter scan use MRI . Able give full inform consent , scan throughout time participate study Able perform task high standard also underlying condition may alter process picture face Participants must none follow , safely remove without risk discomfort enter MRI unit : pacemaker metal implant metal remove body ( e.g . shrapnel , piercings ) metal clip artificial heart valve cochlear implant drug patch contraceptive coil dental plates/braces metal hear aid Participants also exclude ground safety comfort inside MRI scanner one follow underlying condition epilepsy diabetes heart disease thermoregulatory problem ( problem regulate body temperature ) possibility pregnant currently breastfeed Participants also exclude ground MRI data quality follow reason : history mental illness claustrophobia ( discomfort confine space ) Neurological condition</criteria>
