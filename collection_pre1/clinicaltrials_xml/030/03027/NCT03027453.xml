	<brief_title>Berlin - SPecific Acute Treatment Ischemic hAemorrhagic Stroke With Long Term Follow-up</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>1 . Background Quality assessment acute stroke care organize regional stroke registry Germany - federal state Berlin Berlin Stroke Registry ( BSR ) . The current documentation Berlin Stroke Registry focus documentation process quality participate hospital . So far , outcome quality assess surrogate parameter complication mortality in-hospital stay . However , accord consensus recommendation , disability-free survival versus death dependency important outcome measure acute stroke . Because high variability clinical course stroke , outcome generally assess three month use modified Rankin Scale ( mRS ) . 2 . Motivation In early 2015 , several publish trial show mechanical thrombectomy improve prognosis ischemic stroke patient acute large artery occlusion proximal brain supplying artery . Currently , invasive catheter base treatment available many hospital acute Stroke Unit . It likely quality technical procedure depend expertise experience treat interventionalists . Current study suggest close relationship effectiveness approach time treatment , similar intravenous thrombolysis . This time dependency make prehospital triage challenge selection appropriate facility likely influence patient outcome . Intracerebral hemorrhage ( ICH ) less frequent ischemic stroke associate bad prognosis . Recent study suggest blood pressure lowering may improve prognosis start hyperacute phase ICH . With limited scientific evidence , many patient undergo neurosurgical intervention . It remain unclear whether delivery hemorrhagic stroke patient hospital neurosurgery lead well outcome . Hence , pre-hospital care delivery less specialized clinical facility may crucial impact subtypes stroke . The introduction specialize stroke ambulance ( Stroke Emergency Mobiles , STEMOs ) open new avenue pre-hospital stroke diagnosis , treatment patient triage . The effect STEMO care plan assessed parallel B-PROUD-Study ( NCT02869386 ) . 3 . Purpose The B-SPATIAL-Registry provide tool quality assessment new specific treatment . It also enable participate hospital compare quality care facility . Because registry represent quality monitoring initiative , telephone follow-up collect opt-out solution , allow decline participation patient inform follow-up telephone call discharge letter send one month prior actual call . As write informed consent require , method facilitate high follow-up rate particularly patient severe neurological deficit treat non-academic hospital . In B-SPATIAL want identify key quality indicator assure valid quality assessment despite reduced documentation load future quality management . Specific Aims registry : - Assessment proportion patient receive specific treatment ( base total number eligible ) - Evaluation treatment specific indicator process quality include pre-hospital care - Evaluation outcome quality ( survival , level disability quality life 3 month ) Pre-specified analysis : Ischemic stroke - Intravenous hospital base tPA rate treatment candidate - Time treatment intravenous tPA - Rate secondary interhospital referral - Proportions patient receive endovascular thrombectomy - Time groin puncture reperfusion patient endovascular thrombectomy - Proportions use device - Proportions patient general/non general anesthesia ( conscious sedation ) - Secondary intracranial hemorrhage - Functional outcome accord mRS 3 month Hemorrhagic stroke - Time start intravenous antihypertensive treatment - Time start PCC patient OAC specific reversal NOACs - Rate surgical treatment - Rate secondary interhospital referral - Enlargement final volume ICH - Functional outcome accord mRS 3 month Data source The documentation include pre-hospital , in-hospital post-discharge process : - Emergency medical service ( EMS ) - Acute in-hospital stay - Follow-up ( first choice : telephone , second choice : write questionnaire , third choice : FU regard vital status registration office ) 4 . Patients In order ensure valid analysis treatment rate participate hospital , patient include accord follow inclusion criterion : - Patients hospital main discharge diagnosis accord ICD 10 : Ischemic stroke ( I63 ) TIA ( G45.0-G45.3 G45.5-G45.9 , respectively ) - Onset symptom within 6 hour hospital arrival - In patient TIA diagnosis : Persistent neurological symptom hospital arrival ( emergency department documentation ) - Patients main discharge diagnosis intracranial hemorrhage hospital admission within 6 hour stroke onset . - Patients main discharge diagnosis document intravenous thrombolysis ( OPS 8-020.8 ) order monitor treatment rate stroke mimic 5 . Data documentation - Data enter participate hospital via remote access databank - Data enter pseudonyms identification possible local hospital via register-logs safely stored hospital . 6 . Databank characteristic - For data entry , use REDcap databank software access participate hospital . - Dedicated computer use safely stored participate hospital . Encryption password algorithm protect remote access databank . - The registry databank store host protected server Charité IT department . - For statistical evaluation , REDcap databank export SPSS-based data format , store server Center Stroke Research Berlin ( CSB ) exclusive access researcher Clinical Epidemiology Health Services Research Stroke ( CEHRiS ) work group . 7 . Responsibilities - Data entry : Study nurse participate hospital - Databank Charité IT-center : Charité IT department databank manager Clinical Research Units - Scientific evaluation : PI CEHRIS ( Dr. Bob Siegerink cooperation Heinrich J. Audebert , Martin Ebinger Christian Nolte )</detailed_description>
