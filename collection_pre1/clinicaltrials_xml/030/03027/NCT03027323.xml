	<brief_summary>Undifferentiated hypotension medical emergency patient 's blood pressure drop critical level due several possible reason . The medical staff treat patient need find reason drop blood pressure soon possible . When treat low blood pressure , medical staff typically perform procedure call central venous cannulation ( CVC ) . CVC involve access large vein ( usually subclavian collarbone ) insert needle vein . By , medical staff measure pressure patient 's vein give medicine patient hospital . The purpose study compare time need complete CVC use AxoTrack device CVC guide landmarks patient 's body . The investigator expect maximum 30 patient enrol study .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Washington Study AxoTrack-Guided Central Venous Cannulation</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Central venous cannulation ( CVC ) commonly perform give volume resuscitation parenteral medication patient time sensitive condition severe traumatic injury undifferentiated shock . CVC via subclavian route associate frequent technical complication less frequent infection thrombosis compare via internal jugular femoral vein . Traditionally CVC via subclavian vein guide anatomical landmark . CVC guide real-time use traditional diagnostic ultrasound device associate low technical failure rate ( overall first attempt ) , few puncture , fast access , few mechanical complication compare guidance anatomical landmark perform via internal jugular vein . It remain unclear whether CVC guide real-time ultrasound associate significantly low failure complication rate compare CVC guide landmark perform via subclavian vein . CVC guide real-time ultrasound may reduce incidence complication , number puncture , time skin penetration aspiration venous blood syringe compare guidance landmark . A limitation guidance traditional diagnostic ultrasound device may require assistant perform , may feasible treat time sensitive condition low resource setting . In addition , traditional ultrasound probe design image subclavian vein behind clavicle . The AxoTrack system novel ultrasound guidance system recently clear human use United States Food Drug Administration . It intend facilitate CVC single operator well reduce complication time associate CVC . The AxoTrack small ultrasound scan head facilitates image subclavian vein . It remain unclear whether CVC guide AxoTrack reduce procedure time complication rate compare CVC use landmark guidance patient undifferentiated hypotension .</detailed_description>
