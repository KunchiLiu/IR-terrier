	<brief_summary>The known cure primary hyperparathyroidism surgical removal one parathyroid glands . Some patient however , fulfill criterion surgery want undergo procedure due fear associated risk . Therefore medical alternative warrant . This study aim evaluate effect Denosumab alone , combination Cinacalcet , medical treatment patient suffer primary hyperparathyroidism , mild osteoporosis . To best knowledge previously report randomized controlled trial investigate use denosumab primary hyperparathyroidism . 60 patient enrol three different treatment-groups : 20 receive Denosumab Cinacalcet , 20 Denosumab placebo 20 placebo placebo . Patients include meet criterion , wish surgical procedure . By combine two drug , study could possibly contribute discovery realistic medical alternative surgery . It expect therapy able control s-calcium s-intact parathyroid hormone ( iPTH ) , simultaneously enhance bone-structure . The therapy thus potential preventing fracture possibly long-term effect primary hyperparathyroidism formation kidney stone , coronary calcification . Another objective project investigate whether combined therapy facilitate actual reset Calcium-sensing receptor , thereby de facto cure disease .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Treatment Primary Hyperparathyroidism With Denosumab Cinacalcet .</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Background/Context : This project deal medical treatment primary hyperparathyroidism . The cure currently available surgical removal one parathyroid gland , option neither feasible , desirable patient diagnosis . Today major group patient diagnose coincidence biochemical blood-screening , therefore asymptomatic state disease time diagnosis . Long term study show patient time often progression disease , develop complication osteoporosis . Thus medical alternative warrant . Previous study investigate effect well know antiresorptive drug bisphosphonates , well estrogen-related compound . These drug effect particularly bone mineral density ( BMD ) biochemical bone-turnover marker , able transiently low blood-calcium level . Combined many unwanted side-effects high prevalence contraindication large proportion patient need treatment , drug provide realistic alternative surgery . Treatment today generally follow international consensus treatment asymptomatic patient primary hyperparathyroidism . Briefly include watchful wait biannual control-sessions indication surgery , screen kidney stones/nephrolithiasis , osteoporosis s-calcium - s-iPTH level . This randomize controlled trial involve drug Cinacalcet og Denosumab . Denosumab previously show greatly improve BMD , low s-calcium , low rate bone-turnover prevent osteoporotic fracture several population different disease , never test publish randomize controlled trial patient primary hyperparathyroidism . Cinacalcet prove able low s-iPTH , low s-Calcium thereby relieve symptom hypercalcaemia cause primary hyperparathyroidism . It however , low rate bone turnover , show improve BMD . By combine two drug , study could possibly contribute discovery realistic medical alternative surgery . It expect therapy able control s-calcium s-iPTH , simultaneously enhance bone-structure . The therapy thus potential preventing fracture possibly long-term effect primary hyperparathyroidism formation kidney stone , coronary calcification . Another objective project investigate whether combined therapy facilitate actual reset Calcium-sensing receptor , thereby de facto cure disease .</detailed_description>
