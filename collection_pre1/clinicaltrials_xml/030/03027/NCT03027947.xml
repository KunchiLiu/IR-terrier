	<brief_summary>The goal study provide sensory information amputee reduce phantom limb pain via electrical stimulation lumbar spinal cord spinal nerve . The spinal nerve convey sensory information peripheral nerve high order center brain . These structure still remain intact amputation electrical stimulation dorsal spinal nerve individual intact limbs amputee demonstrate generate paresthetic sensory percept refer portion distal limb . Further , recent evidence careful modulation stimulation parameter convert paresthetic sensation naturalistic one stimulate peripheral nerve amputee . However , currently unclear whether possible achieve conversion stimulate spinal nerve , naturalistic sensation positive effect phantom limb pain . As first step towards goal , study , investigator quantify sensation generate electrical stimulation spinal nerve , study relationship stimulation parameter quality sensation , measure change control prosthesis sensory stimulation , quantify effect stimulation perception phantom limb associate pain .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>During study , FDA-cleared spinal cord stimulator lead place lumbar epidural space lower limb amputee steer laterally towards dorsal spinal root fluoroscopic guidance . This approach essentially identical FDA-cleared procedure device place lumbar epidural space treatment intractable low back leg pain . In procedure , common clinical practice place 2-3 lead temporarily epidural space percutaneous approach perform multiday trial determine patient experience pain reduction spinal cord stimulation . Following trial , percutaneous lead typically remove gently pull , patient refer neurosurgeon permanent surgical implantation . Similarly , study , device tunnel percutaneously skin secure place tape suture . Using stylet include spinal cord stimulator lead , device steer laterally fluoroscopic guidance target dorsal spinal nerve . During lab experiment , lead connect external stimulator . In study , device remain epidural space le 30 day remove gently pull external portion . Throughout study , investigator perform series psychophysical evaluation characterize sensory percept evoke epidural stimulation , along functional evaluation effect stimulation ability control prosthetic limb . In addition , investigator perform survey characterize change phantom limb sensation pain occur stimulation .</detailed_description>
