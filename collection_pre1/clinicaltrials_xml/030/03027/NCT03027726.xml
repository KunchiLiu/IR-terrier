	<detailed_description>Background : The global pandemic obesity lead increase risk prediabetes type 2 diabetes ( T2D ) . Objectives : ( ) To evaluate effect 22 week multidisciplinary intervention program include exercise T2D risk pre-adolescents high risk develop T2D , ( ii ) To identify profile microRNA circulate exosomes blood peripheral mononuclear cell pre-adolescents high risk develop T2D response multidisciplinary intervention program include exercise . Design , participant method : A total 84 child high risk type 2 diabetes mellitus age 8-12 year include randomly assign control ( N=42 ) intervention ( N=42 ) group . The control group receive family-based lifestyle education psycho-educational program ( 2 days/month ) , intervention group attend lifestyle education psycho-educational program plus exercise program ( 3 days/week ) . The duration training session 90 min exercise , include warm-up , moderate vigorous aerobic activity , strength exercise . The following measurement evaluate baseline prior randomization intervention : fasting , insulin glucose , hemoglobin A1c ; total abdominal fat ( dual X-ray absorptiometry ) ; pancreatic , hepatic visceral fat ( magnetic resonance imaging ) ; systolic diastolic blood pressure ; fast leptin , adiponectin , fibroblast growth factor-21 , fetuin-A , hs-C-reactive protein , tumor necrosis factor-alfa , interleukin ( IL ) -1beta IL-6 lipid profile ; carotid intima-media thickness ( ultrasonography ) , microRNA expression circulate exosomes blood peripheral mononuclear cell ( MiSeq-Illumina ) ; functional peak aerobic capacity ( cardiopulmonary exercise test 20m shuttle run test ) . Changes dietary habit ( food frequency questionnaire two non-consecutive 24h recall ) , physical activity sleep ( accelerometry ) ; sex , age , socioeconomic status pubertal status use potential confounders . Discussion/Conclusions : Early prevention identification child high risk develop T2D could help reduce morbidity mortality associate disease .</detailed_description>
