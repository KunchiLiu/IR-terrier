	<brief_summary>Background : Saliva , blood , tissue , cancer contain DNA . DNA make `` instruction book '' cell body . Cancer cause change DNA affect cell function . Researchers want test DNA people tumor . They want look genetic change tumor could target treatment . Because DNA change cancer change , test may do different time . Objectives : To find DNA change cancer may help guide treatment . To collect sample data use future study . Eligibility : People age cancer pre-cancerous tumor Design : - Participants screen medical history , physical exam , blood test . Participants give sample tumor . This usually previous procedure . Participants give saliva blood sample . They eat , drink , smoke , chew gum 30 minute give saliva . They spit 1 teaspoon saliva tube . - Some participant may punch biopsy instead . A small instrument take small piece skin . - Researchers collect data participant medical record . - Participants answer question family health history . They also answer question view study , include possible unexpected result . - Extra blood tissue sample may take time participant treatment . All sample save secure ClinOmics freezer use future study . - Participants tell doctor test result affect health cancer treatment .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Background : - Laboratory-based investigation contribute improved understanding biology cancer development new therapy malignancy . - Omics Investigations lead identification somatic germline alteration enable precision therapy . Objectives : Primary - Perform systematic molecular , genomic , epigenetic , transcriptomic , proteomic , metabolomics high throughput ( Omics ) profile tumor , malignancy blood bone marrow , normal tissue identification biomarkers target therapy . - Identify incidental secondary finding germ line DNA report clinical result CRIS medical record Clinical Laboratory Improvement Act ( CLIA ) certify lab . - Identify actionable somatic mutation report clinical result CLIA certify lab CRIS medical record . Eligibility : Adult Pediatric patient age one following : - Patient must enrol approved companion clinical trial within NIH , Center Cancer Research approval ClinOmics protocol PI . - Diagnosis tumor , malignancy , pre-malignant disorder , suspect cancer susceptibility familial syndrome , regardless patient age ; OR - Individuals without history malignancy undergo surgery ; OR - Individuals without history cancer evidence inherit cancer syndrome base family history and/or manifestation syndrome ( e.g . polyposis , plexiform neurofibroma , myelodysplastic syndrome ) ; OR - Tissue ( include tumor , normal , blood , bone marrow , serum , plasma , tissue ) previously collect CLIA maintain CLIA lab available CLIA analysis . - Tissue ( include tumor , normal , blood , bone marrow , serum , plasma , tissue ) previously collect available research analysis . - Biospecimens collect minimal additional risk subject sample procedure require routine patient care . -- For patient large tumor burden within circulation example leukemia , skin biopsy may perform companion protocol . - Individual may undergo treatment malignancy , premalignant condition receive care associate inherited cancer syndrome . - Ability subject Legally Authorized Representative ( LAR ) understand willingness sign write informed consent OR - IRB waiver requirement inform consent specific type tissue Design : -This study allow collection specimen CLIA report germline somatic mutation . The study also collect specimen Tissue Repository , designate sample investigation include systematic molecular , genomic , epigenetic proteomic ( Omics ) profiling , growth factor cellular profile investigation . - CLIA test activity include - DNA extracted section tumor , malignant tissue bone marrow sample somatic mutation sequence analysis - Germ line DNA extract lymphocyte , saliva , skin , normal uninvolved tissue sequence analysis identify somatic alteration cancer report incidental finding establish clinical validity utility . - Research activity may include : - DNA , RNA protein Omics analyse extract normal and/or tumor tissue ; remainder tumor tissue store . - Germ line DNA RNA extraction lymphocytes normal uninvolved tissue . - Establishing Patient Derived Xenografts ( PDXs ) , Conditionally Reprogrammed Cells ( CRC ) line , explant cell line establish tumor normal sample . - Cryopreservation viable normal malignant tissue . - Establishment EBV transform cell line blood medical research either Coriell Institute investigator protocol . - Omics ( Genomics , Proteomic , Metabolomics ) study perform . - Expected accrual 50-500 patient per year . Total protocol accrual goal 5,000 patient .</detailed_description>

Diagnosis tumor , malignancy , premalignant disorder , suspect cancer susceptibility familial syndrome , regardless patient age ; OR Individuals without history malignancy undergo surgery ; OR Individuals without history cancer evidence inherit cancer syndrome base family history and/or manifestation syndrome ( i.e . polyposis , plexiform neurofibroma , myelodysplastic syndrome ) ; OR Tissue ( include tumor , normal , blood , serum , plasma , tissue ) previously collect CLIA maintain CLIA lab available CLIA analysis . Tissue ( include tumor , normal , blood , bone marrow , serum , plasma , tissue ) previously collect available research analysis . Biospecimens collect minimal additional risk subject sample procedure require routine patient care . For patient large tumor burden within circulation example leukemia , skin biopsy may perform companion protocol .
