	<brief_summary>In clinical research,48 case TB ( Tuberculosis patient ) participant 48 case non-TB participant lung disease meet standard divide different group randomize blind method . Every subject inject intradermally ESAT6-CFP10 TB-PPD ( tuberculin purify protein derivative ) different arm person blind method . Specific gama-interferon ( γ-IFN ) detection need injection.Measure induration ( ) redness longitudinal diameter size transverse diameter vernier caliper vernier caliper injection 24h , 48h 72h . At time , observe kind adverse event order assess safety drug .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>In clinical research , make sure safety crowd 5-18 year old firstly , carry crowd 5 year old ( include 5 ) . Firstly , 24 case TB ( Tuberculosis ) participants 24 case non-TB participant lung disease 5-18 year old meet standard respectively divide different group randomize blind method . 1 . ESAT6-CFP10 ( 10ug/ml ) leave arm TB-PPD right arm 2 . ESAT6-CFP10 ( 10ug/ml ) right arm TB-PPD leave arm Inject intradermally ESAT6-CFP10 TB-PPD different arm participant . For participant , person clinical research , study uniform every subject inject firstly left arm , observe obvious adverse reaction , another drug inject right arm . Measure induration ( ) redness longitudinal diameter size transverse diameter vernier caliper vernier caliper injection 24h , 48h 72h . At time , observe vital sign ( breathe , heart rate , blood pressure temperature ) , local reaction ( rash , pain , itch skin mucous membrane ) variety adverse event . Secondly , 24 case TB ( Tuberculosis ) participants 24 case non-TB participant lung disease le 5 year old divide two different group procedure 5-18 year old . Finally , calculate sensitivity ( positive coincidence rate ) TB ( Tuberculosis patient ) , specificity ( negative coincidence rate ) non-TB participant lung disease , verify safety effectiveness ESAT6-CFP10 ( 10ug/ml ) clinical auxiliary diagnosis tuberculosis .</detailed_description>
