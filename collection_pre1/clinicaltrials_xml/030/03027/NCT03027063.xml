	<brief_title>Impact Exercise Mitigating Cardio-toxic Effects Adriamycin Among Women Newly Diagnosed With Breast Cancer .</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This pilot study look effect exercise , receive anthracycline therapy , mitigate cardio toxic effect anthracyclines assess serial echocardiographic strain analysis . Potential participant identify chart review advance routine clinic visit routine clinic visit provider . Individuals approach provider study team determine willingness learn study may eligible . Discussions regard study participation take place privately individual provide Institutional Review Board ( IRB ) approve consent form . In addition , potential participant may contact study team directly . This contact may form telephone , email , etc . Initial discussion regard study participation may take place phone , email , etc. , individual may provide IRB approve consent form IRB review approve material ( e.g. , Patient Handout ) , applicable . In case , much time need consider study participation allow possible participant ; result multiple phone call , visit , email , communication , necessary . For individual choose take part , inform consent happen per consent process . Patients recruit Johns Hopkins Sidney Kimmel Comprehensive Cancer Center , Sibley Memorial Hospital community . The investigator anticipate among roughly 60 subject approach enrollment , 30 part final study . Participants agree participate ask provide write consent . Participants randomize online system one follow two group 1:2 ratio . Group 1 ( Usual care group ) receive fitness tracker flyer reference American College Cardiology/American Heart Association ( ACC/AHA ) guideline exercise physical activity general population . In addition fitness tracker flyer , Group 2 ( 10,000 step group ) receive additional message phone call motivation . This group participants also ask take part 30 minute continuous exercise daily part intervention . For motivation , message send study participant group 2 via message center Under Armour application three time week . With application , study participant receive phone alert email message may respond need . The frequency message increase participant fail meet goal three consecutive day . In addition Under Armour application , participant provide log sheet record daily step , whether 30 minute continuous activity daily complete type activity do 30 minute . Group two study subject also receive weekly call assess side effect provide additional encouragement . Log sheet collect oncology clinic visit aforementioned intervention continue duration chemotherapy treatment . Group 1 study participant assess side effect phone call every 4 week . For study , woman give Under Armour band monitor daily step , amount sleep heart rate . Participants ask download Under Armour application mobile phone data band synced application daily . For intervention , study subject ask achieve goal 10,000 step day engage 30 minute continuous exercise every day form exercise . All patient agree participate invite Johns Hopkins Hospital medical campus test perform . The investigator expect complete study 9 month . Study participant agree participate follow assessment perform baseline : 1 . A Cardiopulmonary Exercise Stress Test do use standard protocol supervise exercise physiologist . 2 . A 2D echocardiogram . The echocardiogram include assessment strain use speckle track tissue Doppler determination systolic ejection time . All patient routinely echocardiogram perform prior initiation cardio-toxic chemotherapy doxorubicin ( Adriamycin ) , trastuzumab ( Herceptin ) pertuzumab ( Perjeta ) , however , study , strain analysis perform line image obtain clinically indicated baseline echocardiogram . Echocardiograms perform experienced sonographers model echo machine reduce variability . 3 . Bone densitometry assessment via Dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry measure total regional body composition frontal plane determine bone , fat fat-free mass . The Dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry scan take 8-10 minute . The total radiation dose approximately 1 millirem , small . 4 . Muscle strength measure use hand grip tool . 5 . Habitual activity level assess use Rapid Assessment Physical Activity questionnaire , categorize activity level scale 1-7 ( sedentary active ) . 6 . Quality life assess Functional Assessment Cancer Therapy-Breast survey 7 . Fatigue level perform Multidimensional Fatigue Symptom Inventory-Short Form 8 . All patient routinely blood work collect , part research protocol , investigator also collect blood determine baseline tumor marker ( high-sensitivity C-reactive protein , Insulin-like growth factor 1 , interleukin -6 , interleukin-1 tumor necrosis factor alpha , leptin , adiponectin , estradiol , DNA extraction , lymphocyte telomere length ) cardiac biomarkers ( high sensitivity troponin , troponin , pro-brain natriuretic peptide ) . The investigator also collect store blood order keep open possibility extensive study look future gene might relate phenotype study ( cancer , cardiomyopathy , exercise response , etc. ) . 9 . Cardiac history obtain recruitment , include clinical risk factor heart disease ( hypertension , diabetes smoke history ) participant evaluate throughout study cardiac symptom especially Heart failure . All assessment perform baseline repeat within 2 week woman complete anthracycline-based chemotherapy . The investigator also track clinical echocardiogram obtain 12 month , result require study . Other study : Serum troponin level check cycle chemotherapy . Height measure upon recruitment weight blood pressure measure time echocardiogram .</detailed_description>
