	<brief_summary>Urinary incontinence ( UI ) define International Continence Society `` involuntary loss urine complain patient '' . The anatomical histological specificity pelvic floor muscle ( PFM ) give key role control urination also control postural stability . These activity involuntary automatism mechanisms lead post-prostatectomy stress urinary incontinence due loss voluntary contraction pelvic floor muscle . The mechanisms lead UI complex may involve loss efficacy deep muscle stabilize lumbo-pelvic region . Rehabilitation pelvic floor muscle recommend treatment urinary incontinence prostatectomy ( Grade A ) , lack evidence define best treatment regimen PFM rehabilitation . Two kind PFM rehabilitation commonly practice specialized physiotherapist . - The first one make individual box , supine position . By analytic contraction PFM , ( exercise Kegel type ) +/- associate instrumental biofeedback . This method use voluntary contraction MPP . - The second realize various position follow gravity progression , individual /or common room . This technique aim restore stabilization entire lumbo-pelvic region postural recruitment involve synergistic contraction PFM . These trial propose compare two rehabilitation program population postoperative follow-up 12 month . We choose objectify urine leak pad test ( weigh protection urinary period 3 time 24h ) main evaluation criterion . The home test pad 3 time 24 hour use numerous study reproducibility reliability establish . Urinary incontinence recognize factor sedentary lifestyle , fatigue , impaired mental health decrease physical fitness . We therefore wish observe parameter two randomize group</brief_summary>
