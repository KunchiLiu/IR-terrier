	<brief_title>Determining Reliability Validity Swing Test</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Upon arrival subject give questionnaire collect demographic information determine whether meet inclusion/exclusion criterion study . If subject meet inclusion/exclusion criterion study , give informed consent form participation photography . Prior perform swing test reflective marker place specific anatomical landmark subject . An investigator demonstrate perform Swing test . The subject instructed step onto six inch box ask swing one leg forward backwards mimic run stride . After ten practice repetition , ten repetition record Vicon Motion Analysis System 2 video camera capture different view . The subject step box reflective marker remove . After swing test , subject undergo series common musculoskeletal examination test . The following examination test perform random order . The first musculoskeletal examination test hip extension range motion ( ROM ) measure use goniometer . The subject lie stomach investigator take subject hip extension measure full motion . The second examination test Thomas test determine muscle length rectus femoris muscle iliotibial band . The subject instruct sit edge bed low supine bring one knee chest . The investigator ass subject 's low extremity position determine length rectus femoris muscle iliotibial band . The third examination test hip strength measurement internal rotation , external rotation , abduction measure use handheld dynamometer . The subject place back hip strength measure use dynamometer . The subject place side hip strength assess . The fourth examination test navicular drop test . In seated position , mark place patient 's navicular tubercle , landmark inside foot . An index card place next middle subject foot height navicular mark index card . The subject instruct stand navicular height mark index card . The difference height sit stand calculate . The fifth examination test sorensen test determine endurance back muscle . The subject instruct lie prone trunk treatment table . The subject arm cross chest , instruct maintain upper body horizontal floor . Time recorded test test stop subject maintain horizontal 240 second reach . Three five licensed physical therapist vary level experience ask watch video recording subject perform swing test rate performance use score system . Therapists rating Swing test access data video .</detailed_description>
