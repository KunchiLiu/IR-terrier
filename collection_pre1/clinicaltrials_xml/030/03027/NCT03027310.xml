	<brief_summary>Background : Researchers data brain control movement people tremor . But cause tremor fully know . Researchers want study people tremor learn change brain possible cause tremor . Objective : To good understand brain control movement , learn tremor , train movement disorder specialist . Eligibility : People age 18 older diagnose tremor syndrome Healthy volunteer age 18 old Design : Participants screen : - Medical history - Physical exam - Urine test - Clinical rating scale - Health question - They may electromyography ( EMG ) accelerometry . Sensors electrodes taped skin measure movement . Participation last 1 year . Some participant visit examine tremor . They may rating scale , EMG , draw write test . Participants 1 substudies . These require 7 visit . Visits could include follow : - EMG accelerometry - Small electrodes tap body give small electric shock stimulate nerve . - MRI : Participants lie table slide cylinder take picture body simple task . - Small electrode scalp record brain wave . - A cone detector head measure brain activity participant task . - A wire coil hold scalp give electrical current affect brain activity . - Tests think , memory , smell , hearing , vision - Electrodes head give weak electrical current affect brain activity . - Photographs videos movement Participant data may share researcher .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Objectives : The purpose protocol study phenotypic spectrum pathophysiology tremor syndrome perform small behavioral , electrophysiological neuroimaging sub-studies . The protocol include technique minimal risk ( standard clinical evaluation , MRI , EEG , peripheral nerve stimulation , single pair pulse TMS ) certain sub-studies may involve healthy volunteer . This protocol aim study neurophysiological behavioral outcome define group patient action tremor syndrome , inform future hypothesis-driven confirmatory study , develop submit separate protocol . For purpose , aim conduct 1 ) pilot sub-studies , 2 ) individual patient investigation , 3 ) training study investigator , well 4 ) technical development study . Study population : We intend 300 patient essential tremor isolate action tremor syndrome , well 150 healthy volunteer . Design : This non-hypothesis driven study involve standardize phenotyping well thematic sub-studies . After patient healthy volunteer complete screen visit , patient undergo standardized phenotyping visit include clinical rating scale well electrophysiological tremor-workup . Patient healthy control may enrol sub-studies , pertinent theme protocol . If sub-study lead result interest , separate protocol submit priori hypothesis , specific study design power analysis adapt pilot exploratory sub-studies perform present protocol . At give time , 5 sub-studies actively accrue subject concurrently . Outcome measure : Outcome measure apply protocol involve method tremor phenotyping clinical rating scale questionnaire , electrophysiological tremor study , videotape exam , well digitize base task . During thematic study focus neurophysiological characterization tremor syndrome , follow outcome measure apply : EMG : analyze tremor signal use spectral analysis , coherence analysis , combination accelerometry , EEG , MEG , TMS explore tremor-networks . MRI : analyze measure amplitude BOLD signal ( fMRI ) ; tractography seed target region interest ( use DTI ) ; morphometry brain region ( use VBM ) ; different neurotransmitter level brain region interest ( use MRS ) . EEG MEG : quantify measure corticomuscular coherence , event- task-related potential , synchronization/desynchronization , coherence sensor source locate close brain area interest . TMS : analyze measure MEP amplitude central conduction time , well measure cortical excitability inhibition paradigm . Behavioral measure : quantify measure voluntary movement involve tremor , reaction time initiate movement , EMG pattern , movement kinematics ( position , velocity , acceleration , curvature ) , eye movement . Actigraphy : We quantify continuous recording motion sensor involve multiaxial accelerometer gyroscope . Furthermore , may measure autonomic data course experiment ( blood pressure , skin conductance , respiratory rate ) would correlate outcome measure .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>INCLUSION CRITERIA FOR TREMOR PATIENTS : Patients diagnose tremor syndrome , include , limited Essential tremor ( per definition Tremor Research Group ) Parkinson disease ( per UK Brain Bank criterion ) Focal tremor isolate head tremor , voice tremor Taskspecific tremor primary write tremor Orthostatic tremor Patients tremor syndromes dystonic tremor , intention tremor , etc . Age 18 old Able give inform consent Agree drink caffeine alcohol 12 hour phenotyping select thematic study visit agent modify brain activity may confound outcome measure . INCLUSION CRITERIA FOR HEALTHY VOLUNTEERS : Age 18 older . Able give inform consent . Agree consume caffeine alcohol 12 hour select thematic study visit agent may modify activity brain study . EXCLUSION CRITERIA FOR TREMOR PATIENTS : Problematic alcohol use , define score 8 high WHO Alcohol Use Disorders Identification Test ( AUDIT ) History brain tumor , stroke , traumatic brain injury , epilepsy history seizure . History psychotic disorder , Bipolar Disorder current depressive episode . History clinical evidence another neurologic disorder tremor syndrome define , may confound interfere ability obtain interpret outcome measure protocol . EXCLUSION CRITERIA FOR HEALTHY VOLUNTEERS : Have abnormal finding neurological examination screen Problematic alcohol use , define score 8 high WHO Alcohol Use Disorders Identification Test ( AUDIT ) History brain tumor , stroke , traumatic brain injury , epilepsy history seizure . History psychotic disorder , Bipolar Disorder current depressive episode . ADDITIONAL EXCLUSION CRITERIA FOR MOVEMENT DISORDER PATIENTS AND HEALTHY VOLUNTEERS SPECIFICALLY FOR MRI : We follow NMR Center guideline MR safety . Some exclusion : Have nonMRI compatible metal body , cardiac pacemaker , brain stimulator , shrapnel , surgical metal , clip brain blood vessel , cochlear implant , artificial heart valves ferromagnetic fragment eye oral cavity make MRI unsafe . Unable lie flat back expect length experiment . Have uncontrolled movement head . Have abnormality brain image neurologic examination relate diagnosis . Uncomfortable small space expect length experiment . Nonremovable body pierce tattoo pose MRI risk Pregnancy . ADDITIONAL EXCLUSION CRITERIA FOR TREMOR PATIENTS AND HEALTHY VOLUNTEERS FOR TMS AND MRI : Ferromagnetic metal cranial cavity eye , e.g . aneurysm clip ocular foreign body . Implanted electronic device include deep brain stimulation system .</criteria>
