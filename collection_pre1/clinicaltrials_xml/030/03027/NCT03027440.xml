	<brief_summary>Background : Suicide rate rise . In 2013 , third lead cause death child age 10 14 . It second lead cause death age 15 24 . Many risk factor suicide find . But hard predict . Evidence grow factor may make people vulnerable suicide identify birth early childhood . Researchers want study vulnerability suicide . They want look different kind development . These include prenatal , social , behavioral , cognitive , neurologic . They link data United States Collaborate Perinatal Project ( CPP ) National Death Index ( NDI ) . The CPP data 50,000 child born mother enrol 1960s . The CPP observe examine 60,000 pregnancy . Then follow baby bear age 7 . The CPP collect data thing like family medical history , economic status , behavior . The NDI data date cause death . Objective : To link data CPP NDI order study certain precursor suicide . Eligibility : Children bear woman enrol CPP 1959 1966 know alive age 7 Design : Data child CPP submit electronically NDI . It encrypt data NDI deidentified protect confidentiality . It merge exist CPP data . Researchers analyze data .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Objective : The overarch objective study ascertain vital status cause-specific mortality child born participant Collaborative Perinatal Project ( CPP ) 1959 1966 order investigate domain vulnerability suicide hypothesize establish early childhood . This accomplish link exist data NICHD-CPP cohort National Death Index ( NCHS National Center Health Statistics ) . This project involve direct contact human subject participant . The rationale project follow . Suicide rate rise , 10.43/100,000 2000 13.02/100,000 2013 . In 2013 , suicide third lead cause death among child age 10-14 year second leading cause death age 15 24 . Suicide account 800,000 year potential life lose annually . In addition economic impact exceed $ 40 billion per year , devastate personal impact survivor well general public . Although numerous risk factor identify , include prior attempt , traumatic stressful life event , sociodemographic , psychiatric , psychological , biological family , socioeconomic characteristic , accurate prediction suicide remain elusive even high-risk group . To date , epidemiologic study suicide largely focus proximal risk factor developmental stage beyond initial formation vulnerability , despite grow evidence frame psychiatric disorder neurodevelopmental disorder . Evidence also increase adolescent adult precipitant suicide root early childhood . Study population : The study population consist 52,966 child born woman enrol CPP know alive age 7 year . The CPP involve systematic extensive observation examination 58,760 pregnancy , include collection blood sample collect first subsequent prenatal visit , follow-up assessment offspring first 7 year life ( Niswander Gordon , 1972 ) . National follow-up rate survive offspring ( 96.7 % study births age 7 year ) 88 % year 1 , 75 % year 4 , 79 % year 7 . Design : This study consist secondary analysis CPP offspring data link National Death Index determine vital status cause ( ) death . NICHD steward personally identify information CPP . Data offspring , include date ( month , day , year ) , name , father surname , state birth , race/ethnicity submit National Death Index ( NDI ) record search cover year 1979 2013 ( year include within NDI ) . Results NDI linkage anonymized merge exist CPP data statistical analysis . Hypotheses test include follow : Examples hypothesis test include follow : 1 . Being bear small gestational age ( SGA ) , low birth weight ( LBW ) , exposure maternal metabolic ( e.g. , gestational diabetes ) psychiatric condition associate increase risk suicide mortality . 2 . Family socioeconomic disadvantage , residential instability , family disruption first 7 year life associate increase risk suicide mortality . 3 . Children whose behavioral profile characterize low attention , conduct problem , emotional withdrawal elevate risk suicide . 4 . Children low score test intelligence age 4 7 increase risk suicide . 5 . Neurological soft sign neurological hard sign detect clinical examination early childhood associate later suicide risk . 6 . There systematic pattern difference 275 suicide case 550 match control select among remain CPP offspring , case exhibit pattern biomarker concentration consistent perturbation maternal immune system would expect normal pregnancy . Outcome measure : Suicide mortality .</detailed_description>
