	<brief_summary>Background : The brain separate rest blood stream blood-brain barrier . This like filter protects brain . But also challenge medicine need get brain . Researchers want give new drug LB100 people brain tumor surgery . They measure much LB100 blood much get brain . This may help use LB100 treat brain tumor future . Objective : To see LB100 pas brain . Eligibility : People least 18 year old brain tumor require surgery Design : Participants screen : Physical exam Medical history Blood test Neurosurgery evaluation Scans Heart test Tumor sample . This previous procedure . Participants brain surgery Clinical Center . Participants get dose study drug plastic tube vein 2 hour surgery . Participants blood take 7 time 8 hour get study drug . Tumor sample take surgery . Participants heart test get study drug . Sticky pad skin measure electrical activity heart . Two week leave hospital , participant follow-up visit . They physical exam blood test . One month surgery , contact person phone see .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Protein Phosphatase 2A Inhibitor , Recurrent Glioblastoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Background : - Glioblastoma incurable disease expect survival 12-14 month spite aggressive multimodality therapy consist craniotomy , irradiation , chemotherapy . Therapeutic option patient recurrent glioblastoma limit , unmet need identify effective agent . - LB100 , water soluble small molecule novel protein phosphatase 2A ( PP2A ) inhibitor , commercially develop CRADA base previous intramural research . This compound show effective variety cancer type vitro vivo model . Preclinical study indicate LB100 vitro vivo activity single agent well potentiate effect cytotoxic agent include temozolomide , docetaxel , doxorubicin , ionize radiation . LB100 active combination temozolomide doxorubicin xenograft glioblastoma , neuroblastoma , pheochromocytoma , breast cancer , fibrosarcoma , melanoma . - A nearly complete phase I study LB100 establish safety recommend phase II dose ( 2.33 mg/m^2 , equivalent plasma concentration 5-6 uM ) . - Although polar compound , rodent study suggest LB100 activity brain . - Whether LB100 across human blood brain barrier ( BBB ) , concentration relative plasma level know . Characterizing parameter important : - 1 ) Our ongoing vitro study indicate LB100 distinct mechanism action different drug concentration ( e.g . nM versus uM ) ; - 2 ) There brain tumor lack effective medical therapy without BBB . Characterizing LB100 BBB penetration profile assist define optimal clinical indication . Objective : -To determine pharmacodynamic ( PD ) effect LB100 assay phospho-protein expression treat glioblastoma tumor tissue compare untreated tumor sample comparison . Eligibility : - Patients histologically proven glioblastoma . - A clear clinical indication another surgical resection must present . - Subjects must great equal 18 year old . - Karnofsky performance status great equal 60 % . - Patients must adequate organ function . Design : - This two stage Phase 0 , open label , single institution study determine PK PD profile LB100 . - The dose ( establish Phase I study ) 2.33 mg/m^2 deliver intravenously 2 hour . - PD effect LB100 treat tissue evaluate pathologic confirmation recurrent tumor . Resected material demonstrate chemoradiation treatment effect inflammatory response include analysis . - PD effect define statistically significant elevation phospho-proteins treat tumor tissue compare untreated glioblastoma specimen . Untreated inter-patient baseline variance standard deviation ( SD ) calculate . Post-treatment PD effect difference great 2.5 time baseline SD statistically significant .05 significance level . Due relatively small sample size , t-distribution use calculate cutoff define PD response . - Up 20 patient may enrol obtain 13 evaluable subject . Five patient initially treat . If one five demonstrates PD response significant .05 level , three additional subject enrol . PD effect declare significant least 2 8 patient demonstrate PD response . If able detect LB100 tumor tissue first 5 patient observe PD effect , additional 5 patient infused LB100 10-12 hour surgical resection determine PD effect .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>INCLUSION CRITERIA : Patients must histologically confirm glioblastoma/gliosarcoma confirm Laboratory Pathology , NCI . Patients must recurrent disease clinical indication resection . Age great equal to18 year . Karnofsky great equal 60 % . Patients must adequate bone marrow function ( WBC great equal 3,000/uL ANC great equal 1,500/mm^3 , platelet count great equal 100,000/mm^3 , hemoglobin great equal 10 gm/dL ) , adequate liver function ( SGOT bilirubin &lt; 2 time ULN ) , adequate renal function ( creatinine , &lt; ULN ) participation study . These test must perform within 14 day prior registration . Eligibility level hemoglobin may reach transfusion . Patients must adequate general medical health safely tolerate craniotomy . Tumor tissue block least 20 unstained slide initial diagnosis must available . At time registration , subject must remove great equal 28 day investigational agent . The effect LB100 develop human fetus unknown . For reason , woman childbearing potential men must agree use adequate contraception ( hormonal barrier method birth control ; abstinence ) prior study entry duration study participation . Should woman become pregnant suspect pregnant partner participate study , inform treat physician immediately . Ability subject understand willingness sign write informed consent document indicate aware investigational nature study , therapeutic clinical trial . EXCLUSION CRITERIA : Patients receive investigational agent . Uncontrolled intercurrent illness include , limited , ongoing active infection , symptomatic congestive heart failure , unstable angina pectoris , cardiac arrhythmia , psychiatric illness/social situation would limit compliance study requirement . Patients unwilling undergo craniotomy . Pregnant woman exclude study safety PP2A inhibition develop fetus establish . Because unknown potential risk adverse event nurse infant secondary treatment mother LB100 , breastfeed discontinue mother treated LB100 . Patients may prior chemotherapy biologic therapy 4 week prior study entry . For patient treat targeted therapy , 5 halflives therapy ( 28 day , whichever short ) must pass prior enrollment study . HIVpositive patient combination antiretroviral therapy ineligible potential pharmacokinetic interaction LB100 . Appropriate study undertake patient receive combination antiretroviral therapy indicate . Patients receive strong CYP450 inducer inhibitor ineligible Recruitment Strategies Patients recurrent disease identify Outpatient Clinic NeuroOncology Branch , Clinical Center .</criteria>
