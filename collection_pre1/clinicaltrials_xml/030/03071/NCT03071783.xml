	<brief_title>Intra-operative Feed Back Traction Force During Vacuum Extraction : Safe Vacuum Extraction Alliance</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The common indication vacuum extraction dystocia and/or fetal asphyxia . The safety assist vaginal delivery vacuum extraction discuss since introduction almost fifty year ago . Serious complication asphyxia , intracranial hemorrhage seizure overrepresented vacuum extraction compare spontaneous vaginal delivery . Little do improve procedure since introduction . Safety measure recommend include restrict total time number pull , full 34 week gestation , station head spine . A general advice also avoid excessive traction force . There general agreement safe traction force might . With exceed force seem increase risk rupture sagittal sinus tear falx attachment tentorium . Furthermore , fetal head become exceedingly elongate flatten , cup pop might cause damage brain blood vessel . During procedure obstetrician significant stress subjective element evaluation traction force concern . The difficult decision whether continue heavy extraction abort operation make stressful condition base mostly subjective impression . To provide obstetrician objective information , investigator develop new device consist intelligent handle hook chain regular metal cup .</detailed_description>
