	<brief_title>Catheter Management After Pelvic Reconstructive Surgery</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This study randomize control trial compare plug-unplug ( PUP ) catheter management , continuous drainage ( CD ) catheter system patient get discharge catheter ( reference ) pelvic reconstructive surgery . The primary objective study assess impact activity . The secondary objective compare rate urinary tract infection group , duration time ( day ) take patient resume normal voiding , impact post-operative pain satisfaction surgery experience post-operative recovery . The investigator hypothesize patient activity/mobility one week surgery two method manage transurethral catheter different arm . Subjects recruit Hartford Hospital Division Female Pelvic Medicine Reconstructive Surgery preoperative consultation pelvic reconstructive surgery 1:1:1 assignment randomization PUP CD group . Prior surgery , baseline activity assess use Activity Assessment Scale , well postoperative expectation . Prior hospital discharge , patient undergo postoperative void trial ( PVT ) per regular clinical practice . Upon failure PVT , participant randomize 1:1 one two arm participant receive catheter : PUP CD . The investigator responsible data collection remain blinded treatment assignment throughout study . Subjects pass PVT test therefore require catheter assign reference arm ( Arm C ) . Subjects follow hospital discharge assess use pre- post-operative questionnaire participant randomize CD PUP arm comprise first 32 consent patient require catheter . Subjects randomize CD 16F transurethral catheter attach leg bag receive teach regard home maintenance . Subjects randomize PUP 16F transurethral catheter place plastic plug instruct unplug drain catheter feel urge void , least every four hour throughout day . Subjects group provide large bag gravity-based drainage night . Subjects also encourage call research team catheter-related question concern include symptom urinary tract infection ( UTI ) . Subjects symptoms UTI ( e.g. , dysuria , urgency , frequency , and/or hematuria ) evaluate treat per standard care . All participant return office void trial ( OVT ) five seven day hospital discharge , follow protocol PVT . At time urinalysis obtain . Only participant endorse symptom UTI urine specimen collect sent culture . This line current clinical practice investigator . Participants treat UTI base culture result high clinical suspicion time office follow-up . Participants fail OVT discharge home bladder drainage per standard care undergo routine follow-up pas repeat void trial . The subject complete post-operative questionnaire assess pain , impact activity satisfaction . Outcomes follow six week initial OVT fail ; however , additional research-associated visit necessary study participant beyond initial office visit .</detailed_description>
