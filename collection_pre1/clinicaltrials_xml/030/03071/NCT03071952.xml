	<brief_summary>The primary objective study assess clinical efficacy AAIR ( Atrial-paced Atrial-sensed Inhibitory Rate-Modulated ) pace treatment heart failure ( HF ) patient chronotropic incompetence ( CI ) term exercise tolerance quality life . Specifically , study ass change cardiac function associate change physical exercise intensity heart rate AAIR pace mode compare AAI pace mode .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Assessment AAIR Pacing Treatment Heart Failure Patients With Chronotropic Incompetence</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>CI inability heart increase rate response increase physical activity metabolic demand , leading exercise intolerance poor quality life . Studies demonstrate patient CI high risk cardiac morbidity mortality . Recent study demonstrate high incidence CI patient heart failure , also confirm CI Heart Failure Study Phase I . However , clinical attention often pay heart failure symptom instead CI-related symptom . Thus , patient heart failure often test CI , even though CI incidence high patient . Moreover , patient could gain significant improvement exercise tolerance quality life get diagnose followed effective therapy CI long-term management . This study design establish clinical evidence AAIR pace beneficial treat CI-caused symptom heart failure patient , improve life quality patient support expansion Brady therapy indication population HF CI exist market also potential market . CI rarely see different definition among various animal specie . It impossible use animal get want data AAIR pace treatment CI . Thus , human clinical study necessary . Furthermore , exercise testing , 6 minute hall walk ( 6MHW ) treadmill , allow objective evaluation exercise capacity exertional symptom , suggest investigation HF `` ESC Guidelines diagnosis treatment acute chronic heart failure 2012 '' . Therefore , exercise testing apply upon physician ' need judgment . Firstly , study assess effect AAIR pace treatment HF patient CI term exercise tolerance quality life . Specifically , study ass change cardiac function associate change physical exercise intensity heart rate AAIR pace mode compare AAI pace mode . Secondly , study look clinical outcome term NYHA class , 6MHW , blood BNP , Echo measurement follow pacemaker therapy 1 year . 6MHW treadmill test suggest investigation HF `` ESC Guidelines diagnosis treatment acute chronic heart failure 2012 '' perform upon physician ' need judgment . The study enroll 30 subject meet indication pace therapy . Consented subject receive pace therapy two follow-up follow one year .</detailed_description>
