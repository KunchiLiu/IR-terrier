	<brief_summary>Scientific basis : Globally , vitamin B12 deficiency one common micronutrient deficiency . The relevant source vitamin B12 animal-source food poor gut function may decrease absorption . Vitamin B12 crucial normal cell division differentiation , necessary development myelination central nervous system . Deficiency also associate impaired fetal infant growth . In propose study measure effect daily oral vitamin B12 supplementation pregnant woman neurodevelopment growth child . We also aim measure impact B12 supplementation several outcome . Study design : Individually randomize double-blind placebo control trial pregnant South Asian woman risk poor vitamin B12 status . Participants randomize 1:1 ratio . Study participant site : 600 pregnant woman early pregnancy . Women enrol early possible , later week 15 pregnancy . Intervention : Daily administration 50 µg vitamin B12 early pregnancy 6 month birth . Comparator : Placebo , identical vitamin B12 supplement . Outcomes : Primary : ( ) neurodevelopment child measure 6 12 month age ( ii ) growth child measure weight length 12 month . Secondary : ( ) neurodevelopment cognitive functioning child 24 month ( ii ) gestational age birth , ( iii ) fetal infant growth measure weight length birth , 1 month 3 , 6 , 9 , 24 month , ( iv ) hemoglobin concentration child mother . Relevance program public health : The result study suggest new dietary guideline South Asian woman lead improved pregnancy outcome neurodevelopment cognitive functioning South Asian child .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Cobalamin ( Vitamin B12 ) deficiency common many low- middle-income country . This surprising main source vitamin B12 animal source food , expensive cultural religious reason often eat . We several study woman child demonstrate poor vitamin B12 status common South Asia . There also compel evidence vitamin B12 deficiency occur frequently many setting include pregnant woman . Case study demonstrate harmful effect severe vitamin B12 deficiency develop infant brain.The consequence mild subclinical vitamin deficiency less clear show associate decreased cognitive performance elderly child . Three randomize control trial ( RCT ) measure effect vitamin B12 supplementation neurodevelopment child : In Norwegian trial , intramuscular injection B12 substantially improve motor development six week old infant one month . Another intervention study low birth weight child Norway recently confirm finding . The infant study evidence suboptimal vitamin B12 status , none severely deficient . We find beneficial effect vitamin B12 supplementation six month neurodevelopment young North Indian child . During pregnancy , vitamin B12 concentrate fetus store liver . Infants born vitamin B12-replete mother store vitamin B12 adequate sustain first several month postpartum . Consequently , vitamin B12 deficiency rarely occur infant four month old mother adequate vitamin B12 status pregnancy . However , many infant vitamin B12-deficient breastfeeding mother vulnerable B12 deficiency early age . In project randomise Nepalese woman receive supplement contain 50µg cobalamin placebo early pregnancy 6 month postpartum . Hypothesis test Principal hypothesis : Daily administration vitamin B12 pregnant woman early pregnancy 6 month postpartum : 1 . Increase score Bayley Scales Infant Toddler Development , 3rd ed . ( Bayley-III ) 0.25 SD point measure 6 12 month age . 2 . Increase length age weight length 0.2 z-scores 12 month age . Other hypothesis test ( dependent additional funding ) : 1 . Daily maternal administration vitamin B12 start early pregnancy 6 month postpartum improves hemoglobin concentration mother infant . 2 . Daily maternal administration vitamin B12 early pregnancy 6 month postpartum improves plasma vitamin B12 concentration reduces plasma total homocysteine methylmalonic acid concentration mother infant . 3 . Daily maternal administration vitamin B12 early pregnancy 6 month postpartum improves insulin sensitivity offspring .</detailed_description>
