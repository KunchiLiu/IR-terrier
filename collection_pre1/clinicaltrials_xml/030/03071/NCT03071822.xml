	<brief_title>Combination Chemotherapy Including Cisplatin , Ifosfamide , Gemcitabine , L-asparaginase , Etoposide Dexamethasone Treatment Newly Diagnosed Relapsed/Refractory Peripheral T Cell Lymphomas</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Peripheral T cell lymphoma ( PTCLs ) group heterogenous lymphoid malignancy derive post-thymic mature T-lymphocytes . They classify accord putative origin , immunophenotype , sit involvement clinical behaviour . Common subtypes include PTCL-not otherwise specify ( PTCL-NOS ) , angioimmunoblastic T cell lymphoma ( AITL ) anaplastic large cell lymphoma ( ALCL ) . With exception ALCL , PTCLs behave aggressively response chemotherapy typically poor . CHOP regimen ( cyclophosphamide , doxorubicin , vincristine , prednisolone ) borrow treatment B-cell lymphoma commonly use . However , randomize control trial evaluate efficacy . Moreover , despite initial response 40-70 % , patient suffer disease relapse , give rise disappoint five year disease free survival ( DFS ) overall survival ( OS ) , typically range 30 % 20 % , respectively . As result , yet standard agreed-on regimen treatment PTCLs upfront setting . One possible mechanism behind intrinsic resistance chemotherapy PTCLs overexpression multi-drug resistance ( MDR ) gene/P-glycoprotein ( P-gp ) , mediate active efflux chemotherapeutic medication intracellular compartment . Regimens combine drug independent P-gp pathway proven successful management PTCL , extranodal NK/T cell lymphoma , lymphoma also express high level MDR gene/P-glycoprotein . The PIGLETS regimen devise replace conventional SMILE regimen management extranodal NK/T cell lymphoma institution . It three year since introduction PIGLETS regimen treatment NK malignancy . The response rate encouraging , overall response rate ( ORR ) 90 % NK malignancy . Side effect generally tolerable . The investigator therefore propose use PIGLETS newly diagnose relapsed/refractory PTCLs . Expected toxicity : 1 . The PIGLETS regimen use since 2013 , toxicity well know investigator 2 . Typical side effect chemotherapy would anticipate , include cytopenia , alopecia , mucositis emesis . These manage supportive therapy 3 . Anaphylactic reaction L-asparaginase may occur , small test dose give formal administration ensure absence allergy . Prophylactic antihistamine glucocorticoid also give .</detailed_description>
