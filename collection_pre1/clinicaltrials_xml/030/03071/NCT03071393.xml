	<brief_summary>This study examine acute intermittent hypoxia ( brief episode breathe low oxygen ) , show enhance plasticity motor output , enhance functional outcome muscle activation individual spinal cord injury . Our aim ass breathing , sit , stand walk functional ability acute intermittent hypoxia , compare sham treatment . This information may useful advance rehabilitation people spinal cord injury .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Intermittent Hypoxia Enhance Motor Function After Spinal Cord Injury</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Recent evidence show acute intermittent hypoxia strengthen motor pathways spinal cord injury , enhance walk outcome walk rehabilitation compare walk rehabilitation alone . A single session acute intermittent hypoxia also show temporarily enhance breathe limb strength people spinal cord injury . Further evidence support hypothesis acute intermittent hypoxia act motor pathway , thus enhance strength muscle body . Spinal cord injury affect trunk muscle control respiration posture . Decreased respiratory muscle function lead diseases respiratory system , primary cause death significant cause re-hospitalization spinal cord injury . Deficits postural muscle function affect one 's ability balance , safely maintain seated position , ambulate spinal cord injury , severely impact daily activity self-care feeding skill . This study test hypothesis single session acute intermittent hypoxia increase strength activation trunk muscle control respiration posture , lead improved score functional assessment individual chronic spinal cord injury . Our long term goal well understand therapeutic potential acute intermittent hypoxia combine physical rehabilitation individual chronic spinal cord injury .</detailed_description>
