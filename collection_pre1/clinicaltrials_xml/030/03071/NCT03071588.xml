	<brief_title>Assessment New Protocol Indirect Pulp Capping Procedures</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Indirect pulp cap common dental procedure carry painful teeth deep cavity result dental decay attempt prolong life tooth / pulp relieve pain , This study aim primarily assess response pulp tooth two different clinical procedure use treatment deep caries . One group patient treat standard clinical procedure involve mechanical rotary bur magnification caries removal , group treat conservative clinical procedure use CarisolvTM gel aid operate microscope caries removal . The study also involve take sample tooth decay microbiological / biochemical analysis evaluation determine specie richness bacterial community associate condition . The study also compare radiographical finding 3D cone beam compute tomography ( CBCT ) scan normal Xrays detect presence early bone change associate root teeth . The study carry King 's College London/ Dental Institute Guy 's Hospital form part routine dental treatment do emergency dental clinic exception CBCT scan . Volunteers give write information process give time consider participation . Once question answer , fully inform write consent obtain interested take part . At least one deep cavity cause toothache require indirect pulp cap detect diagnosed conventional clinical Xray dental assessment . The procedure involve removal decay use one propose clinical technique placement pulp cap material accord manufacturer 's instruction definitive filling place , follow 12 month . Radiographic assessment include cone beam compute tomography ( CBCT ) do baseline 12 month . It hop data analyse study provide definitive clinical radiographic evidence base outcome indirect pulp cap operative treatment procedure .</detailed_description>
