	<brief_summary>The propose investigation study aim ; 1 ) understand prevalence outcomes associate frailty among haemodialysis patient ; 2 ) ascertain best frailty assessment tool haemodialysis patient , ; 3 ) design clinical study explore feasibility facilitating , recruit execute multi-disciplinary clinical psychological intervention improve frailty status among haemodialysis patient . Work package 1 : Firstly , need understand prevalence spectrum frailty UK haemodialysis cohort impact frailty haemodialysis patient . To investigate , investigator approach every patient haemodialysis within local catchment haemodialysis unit , informed consent , clinically phenotype frailty status ( pre- post-haemodialysis calculation variability ) . The frailty phenotyping encompass number frailty assessment ( include Edmonton Frail Scale , Clinical Frailty Scale Rookwood score Fried Frailty scale ) identify ideal frailty assessment tool . All patient observational cohort study prospectively monitor clinical/biochemical outcome use informatics-based approach 60 month . Work package 2 : Building upon work conduct work package 1 , work package 2 aim recruit 50 patient clinically phenotyped pre-frailty work package 1 feasibility study explore multi-disciplinary intervention improve frailty status . Eligible patient , informed consent , randomise active passive intervention . The active intervention involve dietitian physiotherapist train accredited cognitive behavior intervention , utilise establish behavioral intervention framework , deliver multi-disciplinary clinical intervention target multiple component frailty . The FITNESS project therefore answer important unanswered question regard frailty among haemodialysis population help design large multi-disciplinary intervention study deem feasible .</brief_summary>
