	<brief_summary>This open-label , randomize , 2-arm clinical trial healthy infant Bangladesh . The primary purpose study assess immunogenicity measles-rubella ( MR ) vaccine deliver 6 month . In addition , study establish equality MR vaccine seroconversion administer 9 month follow administration earlier MR vaccine dose 6 month age compare MR vaccine dose administer 9 month without previous MR vaccination . This study also provide additional data safety tolerance MR vaccine give 6 month , impact maternal antibody immunogenicity MR vaccine 6 month . - Primary objective : 1 . To assess immunogenicity MR vaccine 6 month age 2 . To assess immunogenicity MR vaccine 9 month age among child without prior measles rubella vaccination , compare MR vaccine immunogenicity among prior MR vaccination 6 month age - Secondary objective 1 . To assess frequency adverse reaction follow administration MR vaccine 6 month 2 . To compare immunogenicity MR vaccine first dose administer 6 month vs 9 month . 3 . To assess proportion mother undetectable , detectable protective level measles rubella antibody 4 . To determine extent variation measles antibody woman child bear age population long stand measles vaccination program 5 . To determine extent variation rubella antibody woman child bear age population rubella vaccine recently introduce 6 . To determine variation antibody level infant 6 month predominately explain variation start antibody level mother population 7 . To estimate half-life decay measles rubella antibody infant</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Measles-Rubella Vaccine Immunogenicity 6 9 Months Age</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>In country low level circulate measles virus , low risk measles infection , measles contain vaccine first dose ( MCV1 ) recommend 12 month age . In country high risk measles , MCV1 recommend 9 month . In past decade , many country experience measles outbreaks high proportion case among infant &lt; 9 month age , recommend age routine MCV1 . Recent publication suggest may due fact majority infant born mother vaccine induce immunity measles , lose maternal antibody much earlier , age 4-6 month . For example , measles outbreak Malawi 2010 , 14 % ( 17,858 ) estimate 134,000 case occur child 0-8 month . In 2013 , measles outbreak Sri Lanka approximately 34 % measles case child 6-12 month age . Furthermore , 2013 Jordan experience large measles outbreak high proportion young infant affect ( 6-9 month ) . WHO measles outbreak response guideline recommend vaccinate child young 6 month outbreaks . As example , response measles outbreak , Sri Lanka Jordan conduct ORI include infant 6 month age despite limited evidence immunogenicity MR vaccine age . Some researcher suggest routine MCV give age 9 month base publish data show infant born mother vaccine induced measles immunity bear low concentration maternal measles antibody ( MMA ) lose protection measles infection earlier age . Measles vaccine immunogenicity depend several factor , include presence maternal measles antibody ( i.e. , passively acquire measles antibody may neutralize vaccine virus complete immune response develop result primary vaccine failure . ) , maturity immune system vaccine recipient , strain measles vaccine use . So decision alter age MCV1 dose balance potential risk primary vaccine failure risk measles infection measles related complication , include death . Immunogenicity measles vaccine give 6 month well study ; however , data immunogenicity combine MR vaccine administer 6 month impact MR vaccine effectiveness give 9 month , limit . Because number infant born mother vaccine induce immunity steadily increase country use MR vaccine routinely ( Expanded Program Immunization ) EPI , timely conduct study assess immunogenicity MR vaccine give 6 month impact subsequent 9 month MR dose . The first dose MCV give 6 month frequently refer MCV0 , indicate two subsequent dos need attain population seroprotection level necessary stop endemic transmission measles virus . To improve accuracy interpretation study result blood sample mother enrol infant test measles rubella antibody . This also enable u determine proportion mother undetectable , detectable protective level antibody , ass relationship level antibody mother infant ' maternal antibody . This study conduct single site rural Bangladesh Matlab . Matlab major rural field site icddr , b , past 50 year continuous health demographic information collect &gt; 200,000 population . From 2007 2010 , icddr , b , Ministry Health ( MOH ) collaboration international organization conduct several randomized vaccine effectiveness study . This study open-label , randomize , 2-arm clinical trial . 620 child enrol randomized 6 month age one two study arm . The primary objective study assess immunogenicity MR vaccine 6 month , assess equality MR vaccine seroconversion administer 9 month follow administration earlier MR vaccine dose 6 month age compare MR vaccine dose administer 9 month without previous MR vaccination . The study enrol generally healthy 6 month old infant live Matlab never receive MR vaccine dose history measles rubella . Participants follow 11 month age . Infants study randomly assign one two arm . Infants Study Arm A receive MR vaccine 6 month age ( enrolment ) 9 month . Infants Study arm B receive MR vaccine 9 month . Blood specimen collect infant 6 , 9 11 month age . The 6 month sample pre-vaccination sample mainly use determine maternal antibody level . For arm A , sample collect 9 month second MR dose use ass antibody level first MR dose 6 month age . For study Arm B , 9 month sample use assess measles rubella antibody decay rate . The sample collect 11 month use assess immune response either two dose one dose schedule ( arm A B , respectively ) .</detailed_description>
