	<brief_summary>Advanced cancer patient often require palliative ( pain relieve ) radiotherapy treat cancer-related symptom . The delivery radiation require patient lie still hard flat surface , result significant acute ( intense ) pain and/or breakthrough cancer pain ( sudden sharp stabbing pain ) , especially painful bone metastases present . The current care cancer patient receive radiation take oral ( mouth ) opioid medication radiation treatment . The pain relieve effect medication take one hour last 3 6 hour , follow time course breakthrough cancer pain occur . Lazanda pain medication deliver via intranasal route already approve U.S. Food Drug Administration ( FDA ) management breakthrough cancer pain patient already receive opioids tolerate opioids treatment cancer pain . Lazanda fast-acting convenient patient take . The purpose study assess change pain intensity palliative radiotherapy follow study treatment Lazanda . This study also explore impact study treatment efficiency deliver radiation therapy</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>This Phase II , single-center , single-arm , Open-Label Study Evaluate Lazanda Cancer Patients Receiving Palliative Radiation . The primary objective study assess change patient report positional pain intensity ( PI ) measure 11-point numerical rating scale ( NRS-11 ) cancer patient bone metastasis assess simulation visit subsequent daily palliative radiation fraction . The primary objective measure use pain intensity difference ( PID ) NRS-11 time lay hard surface ( 0 minutes/ PI0 ) 15 minute lay hard surface timepoint baseline ( simulation visit ) subsequent study visit ( PID15= PI0- PI15 ) . Study participant recruit across oncology disease team . Potential participant identify weekly palliative care disease team patient triage meeting . In order meet eligibility participation , patient must great equal 18 year old , histologically-confirmed cancer symptomatic bone metastasis , Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group ( ECOG ) performance status less equal 3 , plan receive hypofractionated palliative radiation less equal 10 fraction . Qualifying subject must opioid-tolerant , define great equal 60mg morphine equivalent , stable dose oral opioids great equal 1 week . Stable baseline opioid dosage define dosage fluctuate 50 % average dosage one week prior screen . Patients must also stable dose adjuvant pain therapy one week prior screen . Patients exclude receive receive another investigational agent within 30 day monoamine oxidase inhibitor within 14 day prior Lazanda administration , know hypersensitivity fentanyl opioids , know , plan interventional procedure surgery may affect study outcome , pregnant nursing , disorder current medication use likely adversely affect normal function nasal mucosa , uncontrolled rapidly escalate background pain , medically unstable , require immobilization thermoplastic mask radiation treatment . Upon confirmation eligibility criterion , subject enrol . Each enrol subject undergo baseline evaluation mock hard surface within 1 week prior time CT simulation , establish baseline NRS pain score . Subject receive Lazanda mock hard surface visit , radiation simulation visit pre-medication prior radiation treatment ( fraction ) , estimate treatment period 10 day base patient 's radiation treatment plan . Lazanda self-administered intranasally subject participate study . NRS pain score collect three time point baseline : 15 minute prior lay hard surface ( T-15 ) , time lay hard surface ( T0 ) , 15 minute lay hard surface ( T+15 ) . Exact time pain score rating also collect . After mock visit subject undergo radiation therapy simulation procedure ( within approximately 2 week radiation therapy ) follow hypofractionated radiation therapy , accord University California , San Diego ( UCSD ) Radiation Oncology standard procedure treatment plan determine subject 's radiation oncologist . During radiation simulation daily visit radiation center hypofractionation delivery , subject vital sign weight collect . An ECOG performance status also assess daily radiation therapy . At time radiation simulation daily radiation therapy , subject complete BPI-sf , Medication Use Diary , Laxation Diary , Nausea/Vomiting Diary . As mock hard surface evaluation , NRS pain score also collect three time point visit radiation center . Subjects receive study drug , Lazanda 100mcg dose , 15 minute prior simulation ( T-15 ) radiation therapy simulation visit . Lazanda dose titration follow guideline indicate product package insert radiation simulation visit end radiation therapy . Subjects undergo post treatment follow-up period completion radiation therapy . During follow-up period , subject complete BPI-sf , Medication Use Diary , Laxation Diary , Nausea/Vomiting Diary daily 2 day .</detailed_description>
