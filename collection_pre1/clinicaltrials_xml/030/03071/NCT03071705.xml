	<brief_title>Metformin Plus TKI Use Patients With Non-Small Cell Lung Carcinoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Lung cancer first cause death men woman , represent 28 % 26 % registered death worldwide , respectively . Among patient disease , least 80 % non-small cell lung cancer ( NSCLC ) , 60 % patient diagnose already locally advanced metastatic disease . NSCLC therapy regimens depend stage disease may require surgery , chemotherapy , radiotherapy , combination . Survival rate 5 year low patient stage II III disease , variation 30 % 5 % , mean improvement therapy require . Advances molecular biology cancer lead discover several molecular target develop new target therapy . Epidermal growth factor receptor ( EGFR ) involve development progression several type cancer , include NSCLC . However , despite clinical success different tyrosine kinase specific domain inhibitor ( TKIs ) , patient respond drug initially , eventually develop resistance drug average period time 10 month . Thus , innovative treatment strategy require urgently overcome therapeutic resistance EGFR-TKIs improve survival patient NSCLC . Recently , metformin associate reduction global risk incidence mortality different type cancer , due anti-tumor property . In specific type cancer , retrospective study demonstrate clinical benefit use metformin combine treatment cancer . Patients NSCLC positive EGFR mutation highly sensible specific anti-EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitor , however , patient initially respond target therapy , present progression disease posteriorly treatment , know acquire resistance . Acquired resistance target therapy first study patient chronic myeloid leukemia BCR-ABL translocation treat Imitanib , inhibitor aberrant kinase BCR-ABL . Thanks research , mutation associate resistance treatment TKIs NSCLC positive EGFR mutation discover . By several study , additional mutation find kinase domain KRAS patient acquire resistance Gefitinib Erlotinib . By PCR find 50 % patient resistance TKI develop specific mutation exon 20 ( T790M ) . However , mechanism 50 % patient develop resistance anti-EGFR TKI yet unknown . Some study find focal amplification MET proto-oncogen 22 % patient acquire resistance Gefitinib . The propose mechanism MET amplification promote resistance activation HER3 depend PI3K pathway . Nonetheless , study patient MET amplification resistance mechanism . On hand , patient resistance mutation since first presentation , de novo . T790M mutation may present exposition TKI 's generally find activate mutation EGFR ( exon 19 deletion punctual L858R mutation ) . A response rate 8 % report patient treated gefitinib erlotinib whose T790M mutation positive time diagnosis , progression-free survival 2 month global survival median 16 month . Despite advance treatment increase response rate progression-free survival anti-EGFR TKI patient presence activate mutation , develop resistance mutation ( T790M ) disease progression . There standard treatment patient progress first generation anti-EGFR TKI , erlotinib gefitinib . Some study use afatinib second line therapy patient progression , find benefit progression-free survival , disease control rate 58 % delay development lung cancer associate symptom , thus improve quality life patient treat afatinib . Acquired resistance develop mean time 9 13 month 50 % 60 % secondary development T790M resistance mutation . The molecular mechanism generate acquire resistance anti-EGFR TKI completely clear . We know around 50 % case cause acquired mutation EGFR T790M low percentage MET oncogene amplification , nevertheless , propose molecular mechanism , activation mesenchymal-epithelial transition . The latter , refers change phenotype epithelial cell cell mesenchymal cell phenotype , result increase motility , proliferation metastasis tumor cell . It 's propose epithelial-mesenchymal ( EMT ) associate sensitivity chemotherapy TKI . Finding effective therapy patient develop T790M resistance mutation require overcome resistance first generation anti-EGFR TKI . Afatinib , second generation irreversible anti-EGFR TKI , demonstrate study certain effect patient resistance , however , benefit marginal . Studies show union tyrosine kinase portion afatinib patient resistance mutation , 100 time less strong union cell anti-EGFR activating mutation . Pre-clinical study demonstrate inhibition IL-6 receptor activation activation JAK1/STAT3 pathway overcome resistance sensitize cell EGFR resistance mutation . Metformin drug use several year treat diabetes mellitus metabolic syndrome , 's generally well tolerate . Several study since 1910 suggest patient diabetes increase risk develop cancer . The American Diabetes Association The American Cancer Society come consensus suggest clear association great risk cancer incidence diabetic patient . The tumor study frequency : colon , endometrium , rectus breast . On hand , several epidemiologic case control study suggest use metformin decrease risk develop cancer 30 % hazard ratio ( HR ) 0.77 ( 0.64-0.92 ) risk cancer-specific death HR 0.67 ( 0.53-0.85 ) . Such protective effect see kind cancer , study breast , gastrointestinal lung cancer . The effect metformin chemo-prevention subject debate , however , 's information use adjuvant treatment lung cancer , combination chemotherapy target molecular therapy . Pre-clinical study mice demonstrate use metformin per o may decrease necessary dosage chemotherapy may prolong tumor remission . Metformin , inhibit repair anti-apoptosis mechanism , increase sensitivity chemotherapy , especially platinum . Studies involve metformin , paclitaxel , carboplatin doxorubicin , demonstrate effect tumor regression prevention recurrences four time effect monotherapy xenograft model cellular line lung prostate cancer . Retrospective study find benefit progression-free survival global survival diabetic patient NSCLC , also treat metformin . T790M mutation MET amplification main resistance mechanisms anti-EGFR TKI , mechanisms epithelial-mesenchymal transition ( EMT ) TGF-β resistance mechanism . TGF-β also induce activation IL-6 paracrine activation receptor ( IL-6R ) time activation pathway JAK1/STAT3 cell immortalization . Pre-clinical study cellular line lung cancer anti-EGFR acquired-resistance treatment show metformin prevents transcription factor activate epithelial-mesenchymal transition , inhibit TGF-β , thus , inhibit IL-6/JAK1/STAT3 pathway , overcome anti-EGFR TKI resistance patient T790M resistance mutation , vitro vivo . A recent study report use metformin combination gefitinib may increase efficacy latter , show anti-proliferative pro-apoptotic effect cellular line NSCLC . Other study show , Western-blot , decrease level phosphorylation activation growth pathways MAPK , AKT mTOR use metformin , find pre-clinical study . Currently , phase I/II study carry determine effective dose , safety posteriorly activity metformin combination erlotinib second line therapy patient NSCLC without EGFR mutation . The main objective study assess progression-free survival period patient advance non-small cell lung cancer treatment TKIs metformin versus TKI alone . The secondary objective response rate , global survival , quality life , safety , well determine alteration nutrition parameter associate combined use TKIs metformin . Besides secondary objective , want find new candidate marker tumor characteristic predict anti-tumor activity , well search serum biomarkers ; among analyze EGFR mutation ( exon 18-21 mutation ) , IL-6 , IGF-1 , well determination LKB-1 molecule expression tumor tissue . We associate prognostic potential role possible biomarkers .</detailed_description>
