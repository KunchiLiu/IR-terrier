	<detailed_description>The aim study employ genomic detection methodology measure relative amount tumor-derived nucleic acid blood patient diagnose early stage solid tumor either commencing , currently undergo complete treatment . This approach allow investigator develop quantitative measure therapy efficacy via count relative change tumor molecule course treatment . The presence circulate tumor-derived cfDNA plasma patient potentially enable non-invasive mean detect presence absence tumor , assess tumor burden characterize tumor biology patient cancer . The ability measure distribution circulate tumor DNA may allow determination quantitative tumor load score plasma correlate clinical tumor load . Clinical tumor load measure disease burden , investigator propose test study whether tumor load score measure disease burden . A simple , reliable measure disease burden would diverse utility patient therapy .</detailed_description>
