	<brief_summary>This pilot research trial study blood brain barrier difference patient brain tumor undergoing surgery . Studying sample tissue blood patient brain tumor laboratory may help doctor understand well drug get different part brain tumor . This may help determine type drug may best treat brain tumor .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Blood Brain Barrier Differences Patients With Brain Tumors Undergoing Surgery</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To define heterogeneity blood brain barrier ( BBB ) permeability assess drug distribution population patient central nervous system ( CNS ) malignancy . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . Establish correlation BBB permeability radiographic appearance study patient . TERTIARY OBJECTIVES : I . To utilize tumor sample investigate mechanism BBB heterogeneity . OUTLINE : As part pre-operative standard care , patient receive levetiracetam injection cefazolin injection . Patients also offer lorazepam pre-operative area . At time surgery , patient undergo approximately 2 tissue biopsy 3-4 tumor location . This tissue remove part plan surgery , also test research purpose . During surgery , blood sample collect every 20-30 minute begin time skin incision research tumor sample remove . A minimum 3 blood sample collect maximum 12 .</detailed_description>
