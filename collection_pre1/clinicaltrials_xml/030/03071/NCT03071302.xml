	<brief_summary>Evaluation tomographic ( Pentacam ) parameter genetic parameter Visual System Homeobox 1 ( VSX1 ) , Superoxide Dismutase ( SOD1 ) , Tissue Inhibitors Metalloproteinases ( TIMP3 ) gene keratoconus patient diagnosed clinical exam topographic pattern . Basically screen patient n't keratoconus keratoconus . The pentacam index corneal curvature , thin point , corneal high order aberration , posterior anterior elevation , corneal densitometry , corneal volume investigate . To analyze gene , take corneal epithelium sample patient submit cross link compare ( PRK ) Photo Refractive Keratectomy one . Also evaluate gene peripheral blood .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Keratoconus common disease affect cornea gender ethnic group manifest unilaterally bilaterally patient . Keratoconus due degenerative disease , progression fast various situation , affect 1 every 2,000 people , result severe structural change cornea , reduce thickness modify normal curvature conical shape . Keratoconus arise adolescence last thirty forty year age , stabilize consider major cause corneal transplantation . Factors atopy , overuse contact lens act rub eye also related disease . The clinical picture consist lot vary symptom depend stage disease progression . Currently know genetic environmental factor involve desease emergence . Recently several genetic study aim identify mutation gene directly link Keratoconus , VSX1 , SOD1 TIMP3 gene . However , despite effort direct towards understand genetic aspect disease , involve many gene , still many question role gene Keratoconus etiology . Thus , present study aim identify presence mutation VSX1 , SOD1 TIMP3 gene , consider important candidate origin development eye anomaly , analysis nucleotide sequence corneal tissue peripheral blood Keratoconus patient , unilateral bilateral form . The result allow compare present mutation different analyse tissue unilateral bilateral form Keratoconus also compare tissue healthy patient , attempt establish likely inherited and/or acquire genetic mutation cause condition . Thus provide genetic data , still unpublished Brazilian population , may offer subsidy characterization mutation dynamic pattern , origin development Keratoconus . Also evaluate tomographic index corneal curvature , thin point , corneal high order aberration , posterior anterior elevation , corneal densitometry , corneal volume . The idea focus suspicious cornea fellow eye unequivocal keratoconus .</detailed_description>
