	<brief_title>Diet-induced Arrangement Gut Microbiome Improvement Cardiometabolic Health</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>It estimate 2050 approximately 40-50 % adult population worldwide overweight/obese ( BMI &gt; 25/30 kg/m2 ) , 10-20 % develop insulin resistance result metabolic syndrome type-2 diabetes ( T2D ) . T2D forecast become 7th leading cause death worldwide 2030 . Obesity T2D major risk factor development cardiovascular disease CVD . Despite currently available therapeutic strategy reduce cardiovascular risk , le one third cardiovascular event prevent . Hence , cardiovascular complication associate obesity metabolic syndrome/T2D major health issue Western society , represent substantial societal economic burden ( 40 % death Europe EUR 196bn/y ) solve currently available treatment paradigm . Based close relation CVD diabetes mellitus , two disease together refer cardiometabolic disease ( CMD ) . With respect prevention strategy , crucial understand molecular mechanism regulate transition phase obesity T2D CVD . In particular , environmental factor ( primarily diet gut microorganism ) promote retard development cardiovascular complication must identify order propose novel preventive strategy maintain cardiovascular health . Recent data show community microorganism intestine ( gut microbiota ) substantial impact systemic cardiometabolic regulation , inflammatory activation eventually CVD . Defining diet-microbiome profile contribute resistance towards CMD development would major step forward field nutritional disease prevention . Western dietary pattern , characterize high consumption red processed meat , refine cereal sugar , high-fat dairy product , associate high incidence CMD Western country . In contrast , Mediterranean diet ( Med-D ) nutritionally recommend dietary pattern characterize high-level intake fruit , vegetable , legume , nut , minimally process cereal , moderately high consumption fish , low intake saturate fat , meat dairy product , regular moderate consumption alcohol extra virgin olive oil main fat . Med-D recognize intangible cultural heritage UNESCO ( www.unesco.org/culture/ich/RL/00884 ) show beneficial treatment obesity , T2D , CVD . Moreover , data Italian observational study include 153 subject different dietary regimen ( omnivore , vegetarian , vegan ) show individual high adherence Med-D ( classify accord Sofi et al. , 2010 ) characterize increased level specific fibre-degrading bacteria , increase faecal level short chain fatty acid , low urinary concentration atherogenic compound TMAO . However , interplays Med-D microbial population intestine remain unclear . In framework , present project focus impact diet maintain cardiometabolic health human subject via modification intestinal microbial community . Specific aim study establish new target intervention maintenance cardiometabolic health thereby test causal relationship diet gut microbiome ; study functionality intestinal milieu via meta-omics approach , aim harmonization via standardization effort . The study include establishment 2-months dietary intervention isocaloric Mediterranean diet ( Med-D ) . Coupled detailed host phenotyping gut microbiota profile intervention , allow assessment causal effect diet gut microbiome population high risk CVD . Subjects Med-D group assign personalize diet prepared basis eat habit establish 7-d food diary recall . Energy value whole macronutrient composition habitual diet keep unchanged Med-D intervention . However , change carbohydrate ( dietary fibre vs. starch ) , dietary fat ( saturate vs. mono/polyunsaturated fatty acid ) , protein ( vegetable vs. animal ) composition apply . Briefly , Med-D prepare achieve : 1 ) 2 % increase energy dietary fibre , mainly replace refine wheat product wholegrain wheat product and/or fruit/vegetables ; 2 ) repartition energy fat 1:3:1 ( saturate : monounsaturated : polyunsaturated ) , replace animal vegetable fat introducing/increasing virgin olive oil consumption ; 3 ) repartition energy protein 1:4 ( animal : vegetable protein ) , replace meat and/or dairy product legumes . Control subject change habitual diet intervention . All subject request change physical activity level 8 week intervention period . Compliance assess every 2 week self-recorded 4-d ( 3 work 1 weekend day ) food diary International Physical Activity Questionnaire ( IPAQ ) . At baseline , 1 month 2 month start protocol , blood drawing perform urine feces collect fasting subject . Further analysis compliance conduct base metabolomics , allow discrimination animal/vegetable protein , olive oil intake increase intake food phenolic . Metabolomes ( well know reflect diet microbial metabolism ) also compare category order identify protective risk profile use bioinformatics chemometrics approach . Metagenomes analyse follow SOPs utilized landmark study already publish . Comparison pre-defined group individual allow identification microbial gene different abundance group ( e.g . twin discordant CMD ) . Further , gene associate continuous variable clinical nutritional interest ( e.g . insulin sensitivity , intake specific dietary component ) covariance analysis . Concatenated datasets physiological output data , metagenomic metabolome profile intervention study predict subset feature multivariate analysis ( PLS-DA ) classify subject accord relative adherence Med-D . The profile use probe microbiome specific alteration function intervention . The sample size need detect effect Med-D individual antioxidant inflammatory marker define basis previous study conduct UNINA show 30 participant treatment group would give sufficient power ( a-error 0.05 , 80 % power , 2-sided testing ) detect 50 % change urinary fecal ferulic acid 30 % change fast TNF . In addition , estimate sample size 28 participant would adequate detect 10 % change fast total cholesterol use variation accordance study . The number participant increase 40 per group compensate dropout . Samples ( faeces , venous blood , non-acidified 24h urine ) collect baseline , 4 8 week start dietary intervention .</detailed_description>
