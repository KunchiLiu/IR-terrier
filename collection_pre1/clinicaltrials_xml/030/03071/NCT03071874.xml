	<brief_title>Phase II Study Of Vistusertib ( AZD2014 ) For Recurrent Grade II-III Meningiomas</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This research study Phase II clinical trial . Phase II clinical trial test safety effectiveness investigational intervention learn whether intervention work treat specific disease . `` Investigational '' mean intervention study . The FDA ( U.S. Food Drug Administration ) approve AZD2014 treatment disease . The goal clinical research study learn study drug AZD2014 shrink slow growth meningioma . Based laboratory research , cellular pathway block AZD2014 important growth survival meningioma . Further , treatment meningioma cell laboratory result decreased survival tumor cell . As , purpose research see whether treat recurrent grade 2-3 meningioma AZD2014 result tumor size stabilization shrinkage . The safety AZD2014 also study . The physical state , symptom , change size tumor , laboratory finding obtain on-study help research team decide AZD2014 safe effective participant condition . AZD2014 study patient various cancer single agent ( drug use alone treat cancer ) combination number well know anticancer therapy . Previous study also allow investigator determine best dose frequency AZD2014 achieve anti-tumor effect reduce likelihood side effect .</detailed_description>

Patients must receive prior surgical resection radiation therapy progressive meningioma . Patients must receive less three prior chemotherapy regimen progressive meningioma . Patients must available archival paraffin tumor block sufficient generate least 20 unstained slide ; , paraffin tumor block unavailable , least 20 unstained slide . Age ≥ 18 year time study enrollment . ECOG performance status ≤2 ( Karnofsky ≥60 % , see Appendix A ) deterioration previous 2 week . Life expectancy great three month Within 14 day study registration , participant must normal organ marrow function define : leukocyte ≥3,000/mcL absolute neutrophil count ≥1,500/mcL hemoglobin ≥90 g/L platelet ≥100,000/mcL total bilirubin ≤1.5 x institutional upper limit normal AST ( SGOT ) /ALT ( SGPT ) ≤2.5 × institutional upper limit normal Serum creatinine ≤1.5 x institutional upper limit normal concurrent creatinine clearance ≥50 mL/min ( measure calculate Cockcroft Gault equation ) , confirmation creatinine clearance require creatinine &gt; 1.5xULN Urine protein ≤1+ urine dipstick ( 2+ see first test , retest least 24 hour later ) PT/INR/PTT ( aPTT ) &lt; 1.5x institutional upper limit normal The effect AZD2014 develop human fetus unknown . For reason mTOR kinase inhibit agent know teratogenic , female patient must willing use 2 form highly effective contraception ( per institution standard ) time screen four week discontinue study , must breast feeding , must negative pregnancy test prior start dose child bear potential must evidence nonchildbearing potential fulfil one follow criterion screen : ( 1 ) postmenopausal woman , define either woman age 50 year amenorrheic least 12 month follow cessation exogenous hormonal treatment , ( 2 ) woman 50 year old amenorrheic least 12 month follow cessation exogenous hormonal treatment , serum folliclestimulating hormone ( FSH ) luteinizing hormone ( LH ) level postmenopausal range institution . Alternatively , woman must documentation irreversible surgical sterilization hysterectomy , bilateral oophorectomy bilateral salpingectomy tubal ligation . Male patient either surgically sterile willing use effective barrier method contraception study 16 week follow last dose study treatment sexually active female childbearing potential . If do previously , storage sperm prior receive AZD2014 advise male patient desire child . Ability understand willingness sign write informed consent document prior study specific procedure , sample , analysis . Ability swallow retain oral medication . Participants clinical diagnosis NF2 ( either NIH Manchester criterion ) molecular diagnosis NF2 Participants receive biopsy receive 2 prior course radiation meningioma Participants chemotherapy , radiotherapy , biological therapy , immunotherapy anticancer agent within 14 day ( six week nitrosoureas mitomycin C ) prior enter study . With exception alopecia , unresolved toxicity prior antitumor treatment ( exclude corticosteroid ) great CTCAE ( Version 4.0 ) Grade 1 time study entry . Major surgery within four week prior entry study ( exclude placement vascular access ) , minor surgery ( exclude tumor biopsy ) within 14 day first dose study treatment . Participation another clinical study investigational product last 21 day . History hypersensitivity active inactive excipients AZD2014 drug similar chemical structure class AZD2014 . Exposure strong moderate inhibitor inducer CYP3A4/5 , Pgp ( MDR1 ) BCRP take within state washout period first dose study treatment ( see Appendix B ) Exposure specific substrate drug transporter OATP1B1 , OATP1B3 , MATE1 MATE2K within appropriate washout period ( minimum 5 x report elimination halflife ) first dose study treatment ( see Appendix B ) Any hematopoietic growth factor ( e.g. , filgrastim [ granulocyte colonystimulating factor ; GCSF ] , sargramostim [ granulocytemacrophage colonystimulating factor ; GMCSF ] ) within 14 day prior receive study treatment . Pretreatment mTOR inhibitor may allow discussed medical monitor . Current refractory nausea vomiting , malabsorption syndrome , disease significantly affect gastrointestinal function , resection stomach small bowel , symptomatic inflammatory bowel disease ulcerative colitis , partial complete bowel obstruction . Previous meningioma progression treatment mTORC1/2 inhibitor ( mTORC1 inhibitor everolimus rapalogs ) . Uncontrolled intercurrent illness include , limited , ongoing active infection , symptomatic congestive heart failure , unstable angina pectoris , cardiac arrhythmia , severe hepatic impairment , interstitial lung disease ( bilateral , diffuse , parenchymal lung disease ) , uncontrolled chronic renal disease ( glomerulonephritis , nephrotic syndrome , Fanconi Syndrome renal tubular acidosis ) , current unstable uncompensated respiratory cardiac condition , uncontrolled hypertension , active bleeding diatheses , active hepatitis B C infection , know active human immunodeficiency virus ( HIV ) infection , psychiatric illness/social situation would limit compliance study requirement . Screening chronic condition require . History malignancy , except : Malignancy treat curative intent know active disease present ≥5 year first dose study drug felt low risk recurrence treat physician , ( 2 ) adequately treat nonmelanoma skin cancer lentigo maligna without evidence disease , ( 3 ) adequately treat carcinoma situ without evidence disease , ( 4 ) Gleason 6 prostate cancer observation . Patients experience follow procedure condition currently precede 12 month : coronary artery bypass graft angioplasty vascular stent myocardial infarction angina pectoris congestive heart failure New York Heart Association Grade ≥2 ( ventricular arrhythmia require continuous therapy ) supraventricular arrhythmia include atrial fibrillation , uncontrolled hemorrhagic thrombotic stroke , include transient ischemic attack central nervous system bleed History drug abuse alcohol abuse , judge Investigator Abnormal echocardiogram ( ECHO ) multigated acquisition scan ( MUGA ) baseline ( left ventricular ejection fraction [ LVEF ] &lt; 55 % ) . Appropriate correction use MUGA perform . Preexisting renal disease include glomerulonephritis , nephritic syndrome , Fanconi Syndrome renal tubular acidosis . Mean rest correct QT interval ( QTc ) , calculate use Fridericia 's formula , &gt; 470 msec obtain 3 electrocardiogram ( ECGs ) , family personal history long short QT syndrome , Brugada syndrome know history QTc prolongation Torsade de Pointes within 12 month patient enter study .

Judgment Investigator patient unsuitable participate study patient unlikely comply study procedure , restriction requirement . Pregnant woman exclude study AZD2014 mTORC1/2 inhibit agent potential teratogenic abortifacient effect . Because unknown potential risk adverse event nurse infant secondary treatment mother AZD2014 , breastfeed discontinue mother treated AZD2014 . HIVpositive participant combination antiretroviral therapy ineligible potential pharmacokinetic interaction AZD2014 . In addition , participant increase risk lethal infection treat marrowsuppressive therapy . Appropriate study undertake participant receive combination antiretroviral therapy indicate .
