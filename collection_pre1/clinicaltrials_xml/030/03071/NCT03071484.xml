	<brief_summary>Background : Cognitive deficit core symptom schizophrenia even early stage psychosis . To date , reliable evidence cognitive deficit associate outcomes schizophrenia early treatment could help reduce prominent disable cognitive symptomatology schizophrenia patient still experience persistently . Outcomes study repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation schizophrenia patient suggest possibility application transcranial direct-current stimulation ( tDCS ) inhibitory stimulation leave temporo-parietal cortex excitatory stimulation leave dorsolateral prefrontal cortex could affect positive negative symptom , respectively . Positive effect tDCS also report cognitive symptom . The present study protocol hypothesis development utilization potentially effective neuroenhancement tool non-invasive brain stimulation technique like tDCS treatment rehabilitation cognitive impairment early stage Schizophrenia may contribute elucidation nature complex dynamic process brain early stage disease , may lead good outcome . Objectives : The aim present study protocol evaluate efficacy tDCS treatment cognitive symptomatology early stage psychosis . Methods : Sixty patient early stage psychosis randomly allocate receive 20 minute active 2-mA tDCS sham stimulation day 10 consecutive weekday . The anode place left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex cathode leave temporo-parietal cortex . Neuropsychological psychiatric assessment perform time consent ( baseline ) , 1 3 month follow end intervention ( maintenance effect ) .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The design present study protocol double-blind placebo control randomised clinical trial . After randomly allocate , experimental group receive 20 minute active 2-mA tDCS day 10 consecutive weekday . The control group receive sham stimulation ( placebo ) , choose parameter consist 40 second real stimulation ( 2 mA ) , small current pulse occur every 550 msec ( 110 mA 15 msec ) remainder 20-minute period . Neuropsychological psychiatric assessment perform time consent ( baseline ) , 1 3 month follow end intervention ( maintenance effect ) . The primary outcome cognitive function second outcomes positive negative symptom . Outcome assessment perform trial research staff . Primary second outcome assessor ( neuropsychologists psychiatrist ) patient blind randomized allocation assignment intervention .</detailed_description>
