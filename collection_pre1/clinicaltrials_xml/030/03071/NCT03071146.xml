	<brief_summary>The medical device examine study Bard® LifeStent® 5F Vascular Stent System . It intend use patient suffer peripheral artery disease ( PAD ) . PAD generally associate blocked artery legs . The superficial femoral artery ( SFA ) popliteal artery common location problem develop . The patient may experience pain discomfort leg occur walk complication associate wound heal . The purpose study collect information ass deliverability , clinical utility , safety effectiveness Bard® LifeStent® 5F Vascular Stent System .</brief_summary>

	<criteria>The subject legal representative inform nature evaluation , agree provision , sign informed consent form ( ICF ) . Subject agree comply protocolmandated followup procedure visit . The subject ≥ 21 year age . The subject lifestylelimiting claudication mild tissue loss define : Rutherford Category 25 ( moderate claudication minor tissue loss ) . The target lesion ( ) angiographic evidence hemodynamically relevant stenosis restenosis ≥50 % occlusion SFA and/or popliteal artery ( visual estimate ) amenable PTA stenting . The target vessel reference diameter ( visual estimate ) appropriate treatment available stent diameter 5.0 , 6.0 7.0 mm . A total two stent may use treat target lesion . Overlapping allow . There angiographic evidence least one vessel runoff foot ( level malleolus ) . The subject unable unwilling provide inform consent unable unwilling comply study followup procedure visit . The subject claudication critical limb ischemia describe Rutherford Category 0 ( asymptomatic ) , 1 ( mild claudication ) , 6 ( major tissue loss ) . The subject know contraindication ( include allergic reaction ) sensitivity nickel , titanium tantalum . The subject know allergy hypersensitivity contrast medium adequately premedicated . The subject know uncontrolled blood coagulation/bleeding disorder . The subject concomitant renal failure creatinine &gt; 2.5 mg/dL . The subject concomitant hepatic insufficiency , thrombophlebitis , uremia , systemic lupus erythematosus ( SLE ) , deep vein thrombosis ( DVT ) time study procedure . The subject receive dialysis immunosuppressive therapy . The subject diagnose septicemia time study procedure . The subject participate investigational drug another investigational device study . The subject another medical condition , , opinion investigator , may cause him/her noncompliant protocol , confound data interpretation , associate limited life expectancy sufficient complete study procedure . The subject extensive peripheral vascular disease , , opinion investigator , preclude safe insertion introducer sheath . The target lesion locate within aneurysm associate aneurysm vessel segment either proximal distal target lesion . The subject angiographic evidence poor inflow , would deem inadequate support vascular bypass graft . The subject severe calcification target lesion , prevents inflation PTA balloon ( predilatation target lesion require ) . The subject angiographic evidence large acute thrombus target lesion . Subjects stent previously implant target lesion . A target vessel previously place stent permit long subject device ( ) come contact previously place stent treatment target lesion . Lesion require use two stent . Bilateral disease native SFA and/or popliteal artery limbs meet inclusion/exclusion criterion plan treat limb within 30 day . Note : One limb may enrol study , second limb plan treat 30 day followup telephone screen take place . The limb may enrol limb severe lesion reason treat specific limb need state case report form ( CRF ) . The subject prior vascular intervention within 30 day , intervention plan within 30 day index procedure . Note : Additional nontarget lesion may treat index procedure .</criteria>
