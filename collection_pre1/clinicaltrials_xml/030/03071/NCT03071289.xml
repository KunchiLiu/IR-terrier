	<brief_title>A Trial Comparing Observation With Radiation Pelvic Lymphocysts After Radical Hysterectomy Cervical Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>1 . Background Cervical Cancer one common malignant tumor Chinese female . The early stage disease ( Stage Ia , Ib IIa1 ) treat mainly radical resection ( ) radiotherapy . And pelvic lymphocyst one common adverse event ( incidence 18-35 % ) radical resection . When adjuvant radiotherapy ( ART ) perform , lymphocyst include clinical target volume ( CTV ) dose 45-50Gy , hospital China . However , pathologic clinical evidence lymphocyst associate local recurrence . However , inclusion lymphocyst might enlarge CTV increase irradiation dose organ risk ( OARs ) small intestine kidney . 2 . Objective The aim study compare observation radiation pelvic lymphocyst cervical cancer patient radical resection , incidence adverse event local recurrence rate . 3 . Patients methods A patient enrol patient : 1. pathologically diagnosed cervical cancer ; 2 . Stage I-II disease ( FIGO system ver . 2014 ) ; 3. treat radical resection ; 4. need ART accord NCCN guideline ver . 2016v2 . Randomization perform divide patient control group ( Group A ) experimental group ( Group B ) . In Group A , CTV include lymphocyst . But Group B , CTV delineate accord lymph drainage pathway ( lymphocyst include ) . ART perform dose 60Gy gross tumor volume , 45Gy CTV . Chemotherapy give concurrently cisplatin 30mg/m2 every week regimen . The Grade 3/4 adverse event ( CTCAE criterion ver . 4.03 ) 5-year local-recurrence-free survival 2 group compare 5-year follow-up interval 3 month .</detailed_description>
