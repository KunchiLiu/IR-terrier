	<brief_title>Mutational Landscape Hepatocellular Carcinoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Scientific context Hepatocellular carcinoma ( HCC ) one leading cause cancer death worldwide . A transcriptomic classification ( G1-G6 ) describe lab underlined heterogeneity HCC identify relationship transcriptomic group clinical genetic feature . Recently , diagnostic molecular algorithm develop perform diagnosis benign malignant hepatocellular tumor assess prognosis resect HCC . Whole-exome sequencing also identify new oncogene tumor suppressor gene HCC . However , study focus HCC treat liver resection validate biopsy surgical piece larges series patient treated resection , liver transplantation radiofrequency ablation ( RFA ) . In addition , next-generation sequencing allow sequence circulate tumor DNA plasma patient advance cancer never test patient HCC . Description project The MUTHEC project involve 4 team France aim perform translation molecular genetic classification HCC clinical care . First , investigator want draw genetic landscape HCC different clinical setting . The investigator sequence 30 gene , previously identify whole exome sequencing , series 120 HCC treat RFA , 200 HCC treat liver transplantation 40 advance HCC . The investigator also aim validate diagnostic prognostic molecular algorithm ( 56 gene include prognostic 5-gene score use quantitative RT-PCR ) different clinical setting test use formalin-fixed , paraffin-embedded ( FFPE ) tissue . In addition , investigator test surrogate marker genetic alteration oncogenic pathway use immunohistochemistry series tumor . All HCC review expert pathologist order perform genotype/phenotype classification . Lastly , investigator want conduct pilot study sequence circulate tumor DNA . The investigator use next generation sequence detect plasma somatic mutation observe tumor biopsy . It allow non-invasive diagnosis tumor mutation plasma patient treatment RFA . Expected result The investigator aim extend knowledge HCC genetic alteration different type curative treatment ( resection , liver transplantation RFA ) advance HCC . In addition , investigator want translate classification use immunohistochemistry facilitate use routine . These result use future identify subgroup predict response target treatment . In addition , investigator validate diagnostic prognostic molecular signature different clinical situation FFPE sample . Assessment prognosis curative treatment help stratify adjuvant treatment future guide therapeutic decision . Finally , sequence circulate tumor DNA would allow monitoring somatic mutation ( `` liquid biopsy '' ) curative treatment selective pressure target therapy .</detailed_description>
