	<brief_summary>The objective study determine accuracy estimate patient blood volume use field-expedient point-of-care measurement hematocrit hemodilution standardize volume intravenous solution , comparison determine patient blood volume radiodilution . A total 33 healthy adult male subject age 18-35 year undergo determination blood volume fix order : first radiodilution , hemodilution . Blood volume measure radiodilution correlate blood volume estimate hemodilution ass potential validity hemodilution mean estimate blood volume .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The primary goal perioperative fluid therapy optimize patient blood volume give degree cardiac function thereby promote adequate end organ tissue perfusion . In ideal situation , surgical patient would maintain euvolemic total blood volume ( TBV ) promote optimal tissue oxygenation , nutrient supply , removal metabolic waste product . Current method assess perioperative TBV manage intravenous ( IV ) fluid , include fluid algorithm , physiologic parameter , blood study , clinician intuition , either inaccurate require highly specialized equipment training . Therefore , clinician face formidable task attempt titrate IV fluid goal preserve optimal tissue perfusion perioperative period without knowledge patient 's actual TBV . This long stand clinical conundrum , potential iatrogenic consequence hypo- hypervolemia , recently produce significant degree inquiry direct indirect method evaluate cardiac output product fluctuate TBV . The goal much investigation generate evidence-based methodology administration perioperative IV fluid promote euvolemia preserve adequate tissue perfusion . There strong evidence civilian anesthesia surgical literature use various indicator cardiac output marker TBV guide fluid therapy , call Goal Directed Fluid Therapy ( GDFT ) , lead significantly well perioperative patient outcome . However , current GDFT management protocol rely heavily technology readily available within sufficiently ruggedize use military field set ongoing accurate estimation TBV guide fluid replacement presence major trauma , physiologic aftermath , may critical survival . Therefore , primary objective study assess accuracy determine patient TBV use measurement red blood cell volume ( hematocrit , HCT ) point-of-care test device relevant military setting , hemodilution standard IV solution . The specific aim propose research : 1 . Determine subject total blood volume use gold standard DAXOR Blood Volume Analyzer-100 Analysis System ( Radiotracer Dilution Technique ) . 2 . Compute estimate subject total blood volume use venous blood hematocrit value draw intravenous fluid bolus ( Hemodilution Technique ) . 3 . Correlate inter-subject radiotracer dilution technique-derived total blood volume hemodilution technique-derived total blood volume . Hypothesis : The calculated total blood volume derive simple clinically applicable hemodilution technique highly correlate gold standard laboratory radiotracer dilution technique . The propose study examine utility simple , clinically applicable , adaptable method ass patient 's TBV rely sophisticate , technology-dependent , direct indirect measure cardiac output . Development confirmation accuracy simple method intermittently determine patient 's TBV perioperative setting would revolutionize ability practitioner match perioperative IV fluid administration goal optimize cardiac output tissue perfusion . The tremendous potential positive impact work surgical anesthesia care military civilian setting evident brief expansive exist work demonstrate significant improvement patient outcome use GDFT technique . The propose study potentially first step future program research bring benefit GDFT austere setting .</detailed_description>
