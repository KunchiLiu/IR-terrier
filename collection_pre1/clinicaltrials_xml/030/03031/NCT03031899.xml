	<brief_summary>Abstract Objective : To study diagnostic efficiency Rose Bengal Toluidine blue detect biopsy site thus establish accurate diagnosis oral premalignant lesion . Materials method : In study 27 patient 41 lesion include . Since one patient quit habit two week follow initial examination another lesion disappear wait period , 2 patient ( 3 lesion ) include study . Out 38 lesion diagnose base clinical criterion , 32 leukoplakia , 5 lichen planus 1 SCC . After initial examination subject Rose Bengal Toluidine blue stain . If stain positive subject biopsy .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Introduction Toluidine blue stain common technique use early detection dysplastic change patient premalignant lesion . One meta-analysis Rosenberg et al . previously publish reported sensitivity range 93.5 % 97.8 % specificity range 73.3 % 92.9 % . Zang et al report TB detects high-grade dysplasia detects OPLs minimal dysplasia high-risk clinical molecular attributes.4 But , study show high 30 % risk false-positive staining . Rose Bengal ( RB ) widely use diagnose various ocular surface disorder include delineation extent corneal conjunctival neoplasm . It believe stain desquamated ocular epithelial cell , dead degenerate cell , wherever poor protection surface epithelium preocular tear Ô¨Ålm rather lack cell vitality . These characteristic feature RB lead researcher apply oral premalignant lesions.5 In none study , reliability RB stain compare exist previously practice method oral premalignant lesion . Hence study undertaken aim compare RB TB stain early detection dysplasia oral premalignant lesion . Materials Methods : Study group consist 41 oral premalignant lesion patient visit Department Oral Medicine Radiology The oxford dental college hospital , Bangalore . Patients premalignant condition ( OSMF ) , patient bleed disorder , patient systemic disease exclude study.To perform present study , ethical clearance obtain Institutional Ethical Board . Study procedure explain informed consent take select patient premalignant lesion . The patient lesion subject detailed case history , intra oral examination photograph lesion record . Patients habit counsel quit habit recall 2 week stain . Since one patient quit habit two week first visit , another patient lesion disappear two week 2 patient ( 3 lesion ) include study . ( Graph1 ) Initially patient ask rinse mouth distil water 1 minute . 1 % RB solution apply cotton tip 2 minute . Again patient ask rinse mouth 1 minute distilled water remove excess RB solution area take stain photographed . Following , patient ask rinse mouth 1 % acetic acid 1 min remove remain RB stain lesion prepare TB stain . 1 % Toluidineblue apply lesion 30 second patient make swish 1 % acetic acid area stain record photographically . These two photograph assess stained area similar procedure single biopsy take . If stain area different two different biopsy take .</detailed_description>
