	<brief_summary>The aim study determine treatment Medical Air ( 21 % oxygen room air ) compare supplemental oxygen ( 100 % oxygen ) lead similar improvement central apnea-hypopnea index ( CAHI ) infants Prader-Willi Syndrome . Despite vast amount research investigating cause central sleep apnea , remain gap knowledge , lend research effort . The decision compare oxygen medical air base several theorized mechanism . The first supposition provision medical air may act arousal stimulus hypothalamus , thereby prevent sleep disorder breathing . Secondly , hypercapnic challenge perform Livingston et al demonstrate delayed hypercapneic arousal response PWS subject despite simultaneous hyperoxia , lead u question therapeutic oxygen really play significant role treat CSA . Lastly , delivery medical air via nasal prong may provide sufficient arousal terminate cycle event lead central apnea , describe Urquhart et al . A deep understanding central sleep apnea essential ameliorate adverse sequela , include symptom ADHD , impaired attention , behavioral problem , academic difficulty .</brief_summary>
