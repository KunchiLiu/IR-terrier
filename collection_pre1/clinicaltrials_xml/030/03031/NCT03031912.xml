	<brief_title>African-Canadian Study HIV-Infected Adults Vaccine Ebola - ACHIV-Ebola</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The study enroll approximately 200 participant , ~100 2 site Canada ~100 2 site Africa . Overall ~160 participant receive study vaccine 40 receive placebo . Sequential enrollment four study cohort occur time study site accord CD4 T-cell count : Group 1 include adult subject CD4 ≥ 500 cells/mm3 , Group 2 CD4 &gt; 350 &lt; 500 cells/mm3 , Group 3 CD4 ≥ 200 ≤ 350 cells/mm3 , Group 4 adolescent CD4 ≥ 200 cells/mm3 . Enrolment vaccine administration begin group high CD4 count . When D42 post-vaccination period complete subject Group 1 , Data Safety Monitoring Board ( DSMB ) review safety data determine concern , enrolment vaccination next CD4 cohort may begin . Similarly , D42 safety data Group 2 reviewed/approved DSMB , enrolment vaccination participant Group 3 may begin . Adolescents 13-17 year age ( inclusive ) CD4 ≥ 200 enrol D42 safety review adult CD4 ≥ 200 . Within group , participant randomly assign receive one dose ≥2 x 107 pfu study vaccine placebo ratio 4 1 ( 160:40 ) . Participants complete memory aid 42 day follow vaccination . Specific procedure perform trial , well prescribe time associated visit window , outline Trial Flow Chart - Section 6.0 . Details procedure provide Section 7.0 - Trial Procedures . This trial use adaptive design base pre-specified criterion , use independent , external DSMB monitor safety immunogenicity . There 3 formal safety analysis perform DSMB . Data least 75 % participant must available analysis . The first safety analysis conduct first group ( CD4 ≥ 500 cells/mm3 ) complete 42 day follow-up post vaccination . The second safety analysis conduct second group ( CD4 &gt; 350 &lt; 500 cells/mm3 ) complete 42 day follow-up post vaccination . The third safety analysis conduct third group ( Adults CD4 ≥ 200 ≤ 350 cells/mm3 ) complete 42 day follow-up post vaccination . Results safety analysis review DSMB , make recommendation Sponsor continue , modify end trial accord plan describe briefly Section 2.2 - Trial Diagram detail Section 8.0 - Statistical Analysis Plan . In case outbreak Ebola Zaire DSMB may recommend vaccinate subject randomize receive placebo V920 provide least 84 day SAE follow-up conduct .</detailed_description>
