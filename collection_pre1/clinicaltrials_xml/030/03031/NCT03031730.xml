	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . Evaluate safety tolerability MDM2 inhibitor AMG-232 ( AMG-232 ) combination carfilzomib , lenalidomide , dexamethasone ( KRd ) . II . Determine maximum tolerate dose ( MTD ) recommend phase 2 dose ( RP2D ) AMG-232 combination carfilzomib , lenalidomide , dexamethasone ( KRd ) . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . Evaluate progressive disease ( PD ) effect AMG-232 serum MIC-1 level . II . To assess AMG-232 exposure-response relationship ( PD , toxicity , efficacy ) . TERTIARY OBJECTIVES : I . To observe record anti-tumor activity AMG-232 combination carfilzomib , lenalidomide , dexamethasone ( KRd ) relapsed/refractory myeloma International Myeloma Working Group ( IMWG ) criterion . II . Evaluate ribonucleic acid ( RNA ) expression level relevant gene TP53 pathway may predict response therapy use pre- post-treatment bone marrow biopsy . OUTLINE : This dose-escalation study MDM2 inhibitor AMG-232 . Patients receive MDM2 inhibitor AMG-232 orally ( PO ) daily ( QD ) day 1-7 , carfilzomib intravenously ( IV ) 10-30 minute day 1-2 , 8-9 , 15-16 course 1-12 day 1-2 15-16 course 13-18 , lenalidomide PO day 1-21 , dexamethasone PO IV day 1 , 8 , 15 , 22 . Courses repeat every 28 day absence disease progression unexpected toxicity . After completion study treatment , patient follow 30 day .</detailed_description>
