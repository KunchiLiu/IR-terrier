	<brief_title>Metformin Patients Initiating ADT Prevention Intervention Metabolic Syndrome</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The primary objective study determine difference arm respect proportion patient meet diagnostic criterion metabolic syndrome 18 month study treatment . It estimate one seven Canadian men diagnose prostate cancer lifetime . In 2015 , approximately 23,600 Canadian men estimate diagnosed prostate cancer 4,000 die disease . Androgen deprivation therapy ( ADT ) standard first-line treatment men incurable prostate cancer long know improve overall survival . It recently show intermittent ADT ( iADT ) non-inferior continuous therapy , modest improvement quality-of-life measure provide intermittent approach . Thus , iADT consider standard care patient rise PSA definitive local therapy . Although effectiveness ADT well establish patient advanced prostate cancer , associate important adverse effect outline . The development metabolic syndrome particular clinically important associate worsened quality life increase all-cause morbidity mortality . As ADT employ , alone combination therapy , virtually men advance prostate cancer increasingly long periods time ( median survival men present newly diagnose metastatic disease recent clinical trial least 3 year , typically continuous hormonal therapy ) , burden ADT toxicity among men prostate cancer significant increase . The investigator hypothesize addition metformin program intermittent ADT reduce proportion patient metabolic syndrome 18 month initiation ADT reduce severity individual component metabolic syndrome men advance prostate cancer . To test hypothesis , randomize , double-blinded , placebo-controlled phase 3 clinical trial metformin patient undergoing iADT treatment .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Pathologically confirm adenocarcinoma prostate . Eligible initiate intermittent androgen deprivation therapy either : Asymptomatic metastatic disease ; Biochemical recurrence prostate cancer : PSA &gt; 3 ng/mL prior curative intent local therapy ( i.e . prostatectomy ) ; PSA ≥ 2 ng/mL nadir previously treat definitive radiotherapy . Serum testosterone &gt; 5 nmol/L . Patient able ( i.e . sufficiently fluent ) willing complete quality life questionnaires either English French . The baseline assessment must complete within require timeline , prior registration/randomization . Inability ( lack comprehension English French , equivalent reason cognitive issue lack competency ) complete questionnaire make patient ineligible study . However , ability unwillingness complete questionnaire make patient ineligible . Patient consent must appropriately obtain accordance applicable local regulatory requirement . Each patient must sign consent form prior enrolment trial document willingness participate . Patients must accessible treatment followup . Investigators must assure patient randomized trial available complete documentation treatment , adverse event , followup . Patients must accessible treatment follow . Patients register trial must treat follow participate centre . Investigators must assure patient registered trial available complete documentation treatment , adverse event , followup . Protocol treatment begin within 7 work day patient randomization . Prior androgen deprivation therapy within 12 month enrolment . Prior androgen deprivation therapy associate definitive treatment permit , complete least 12 month prior enrolment ( i.e . last injection tablet take 12 month prior enrolment ) . Patients meet ≥ 1 Canadian Diabetes Association criterion diagnosis diabetes within 28 day enrolment : Fasting plasma glucose ≥ 7 mmol/L ; HbA1C ≥ 6.5 % . Patients currently take metformin take metformin within 28 day enrolment . History lactic acidosis condition predispose lactic acidosis : Impaired Renal Function ( eGFR &lt; 45 mL/minute/1.73 m2 ) ; Liver disease , include alcoholic liver disease , demonstrate follow parameter : AST &gt; 1.8 x upper limit normal ALT &gt; 1.8 x upper limit normal Alkaline Phosphatase &gt; 2x upper limit normal Serum total bilirubin &gt; 1.5 x upper limit normal ( except subject Gilbert 's Disease eligible despite elevated serum bilirubin level ) .
