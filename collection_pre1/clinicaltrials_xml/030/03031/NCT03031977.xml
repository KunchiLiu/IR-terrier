	<brief_title>Visceral Mobilization Functional Constipation Stroke Survivors</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Procedures All volunteer receive clarification regard procedure inform procedure would affect health . The volunteer assure information would confidential privacy would remain protected . All volunteer agree participate study sign statement inform consent compliance Resolution 196/96 Brazilian National Board Health . Sham intervention procedure always perform combination active conventional therapy , lessen impact sham procedure patient . Moreover , patient inform use procedure prior onset study . Randomization , evaluation intervention Thirty individual meet eligibility criterion randomly allocate one two study group use block randomization method . Fifteen patient allocate group : Experimental group - conventional physical therapy visceral mobilization ; control group : conventional physical therapy sham mobilization . Block randomization involve use seal opaque envelope , contain card stipulate one two group . After pre-intervention evaluation , participant allocate group open envelope . This process perform member research team involve recruitment process development study . Evaluations perform three occasion : 1 ) prior intervention ; 2 ) immediately first session ; 3 ) one week last session . All specific evaluation procedure perform pre-intervention post-intervention ( one week session ) evaluation , whereas computerize plantar pressure evaluation perform second evaluation ( immediately first session ) . The researcher charge evaluation blind objective study take part intervention protocol . Moreover , order evaluation randomize avoid effect standardization . First , identification chart fill information age , sex , date stroke episode onset constipation . Anthropometric data ( body mass height ) also measure record . The specific evaluation procedure consist use intestinal symptom rating scale ( 16 ) ( primary outcome ) plantar pressure evaluation ( secondary outcome ) . The ten-item intestinal symptom rating scale use measure intensity intestinal symptom . On scale , item score 0 4 point . Item 1 regard frequency bowel movement Items 2 10 address intestinal symptom . The final score calculate mean item score ; 0 corresponds absence symptom 4 corresponds high intensity symptom . ( 16 ) The plantar pressure evaluation perform use force plate ( Medicapteurs France S-Plate ) 1600 sensor acquisition frequency 100 image per second . This force plate measure distribution plantar pressure quiet standing , quantitative data anteroposterior mediolateral sway ( cm ) well mean sway velocity ( cm/s ) direction . The volunteer stand barefoot pressure plate stand position arm alongside body , gaze fix horizon , lip close , mandible rest body relax . Readings perform 50 second , 30 intermediate second use analysis . The value record use program provide manufacturer instal microcomputer . Both group submit general kinesiotherapy focus strengthening , stretch proprioception conventional physical therapy . The experimental group also submit mobilization ascend colon , descend colon , sigmoid colon sphincter ( cardiac , pyloric , Oddi , duodenojejunal ileocecal ) patient supine position , knee flex , foot support abdomen expose . Contact make region treat , lead direction immobility , pressure maintain one minute region intensity base sensitivity tension observe feedback individual . In control group , sham mobilization perform , consist superficial contact pressure abdominal region correspond loop large intestine . Five intervention session hold two-week period . Statistical analysis The data first submit Kolmogorov-Smirnov test determine adherence Gaussian curve . The independent t-test use inter-group analysis . Repeated-measures ANOVA use intra-group analysis condition . The chi-square test use evaluate dispersion qualitative variable intra-group inter-group analysis . A p-value â‰¤ 0.05 consider indicative statistical significance . The data organize tabulate use Statistical Package Social Sciences ( SPSS v.19.0 ) .</detailed_description>
