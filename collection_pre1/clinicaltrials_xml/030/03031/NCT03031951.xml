	<brief_title>Lifestyle Intervention Program Former Elite Athletes</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The physical preparation elite athlete result complex demand daily training . In process high energy expenditure ( EE ) occur compensate proportional energy intake , thus contribute neutral energy balance weight maintenance . However , positive energy balance ( consequently increase weight ) expect end sport career energy intake maintain low EE . While clinician researcher concerned average individual whose physical activity ( PA ) level far recommended exercise dose often overlook group former highly competitive athlete , expose high amount vigorous PA time train competition . It common upon retirement energy intake match dramatic decrease overall energy expenditure lead positive energy balance , consequently weight gain . The change lower physical activity level induce equivalent reduction energy intake . Varying physical activity level 1.8 1.4 7 day associate change energy intake tendency energy intake drop sedentariness progress . In fact , elite athlete become inactive susceptible various chronic disease obesity , diabetes cardiovascular disease . Not obesity comorbidities major health problem increase body weight high risk develop hypertension , type II diabetes cardiovascular disease observe athlete retired sport career . However , literature report risk present retire athlete expose sedentary lifestyle . In fact , current level PA protective development cardiovascular disease former athlete past sport history . Although expect retired elite athlete engage regular PA throughout life , study reveal assumption apply former athlete . This concern address United States , namely within National Football League obesity prevention program retire athlete implement . In Portugal ~50 % former elite athlete overweight/obese ~30 % inactive , base self-reports measure . Indeed support provide maintain healthy lifestyle end sport career . If healthy lifestyle promotion among post-career elite athlete would contribute avoid observed rate overweight/obesity unknown . Considering actual context , aim research project analyze efficacy effectiveness lifestyle intervention former athlete . To accomplish goal investigator perform 3-month randomize controlled trial 6-month follow-up 100 volunteered former overweight ( Body Mass index &gt; 25 kg.m-2 ) , inactive elite athlete represent Portugal international competition 1972-2012 , end career least 2 year prior study able attend educational session . Participants randomly assign 2 group : ) dietary counsel ( control group ) , ii ) behavioral lifestyle intervention , focus diet PA. All participant screen baseline , 3 month , 12 month . A broad set parameter assay participant , namely : body composition , cardiorespiratory fitness , muscle strength , biochemical parameter , rest metabolic rate , nutritional intake , daily PA , quality life . These variable allow comprehension effect lifestyle modification fatness , fitness health-related parameter contribute also elucidate compensatory mechanism associate potential change weight composition . To accomplish main goal research team use establish method literature well novel procedure , enable research team overcome limitation previous study . At end study investigator expect collect consistent data whether lifestyle intervention able effectively decrease fatness improve fitness health-related marker . The research team believe data help non-governmental governmental stakeholder sport education make evidence base decision , specifically introduction implementation lifestyle program transition post-career elite athlete . The grow number elite athlete support government along recent EU report guideline dual career high-performance sport ( ec.europa.eu/sport/news/2013/20130123-eu-guidelines-dualcareers_en.htm ) require study test role preventive educational program athlete area healthy living . The past experience research team body composition , physical fitness , objectively measure PA use cross-sectional prospective study design athletic non-athletic population , well conduction PA intervention clinical trial , together involvement Portuguese Olympic Committee partner , support chance successfully achieve propose objective .</detailed_description>
