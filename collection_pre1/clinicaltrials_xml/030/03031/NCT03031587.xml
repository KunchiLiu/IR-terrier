	<brief_summary>Radiofrequency ablation primary treatment atrial ventricular arrhythmia resistant medication . However , absence assessment injury creation radiofrequency application important issue . One objectives Institut Hospitalo-Universitaire ( IHU ) Liryc ( l'Institut de Rythmologie et Modélisation Cardiaque ) improve ablation procedure radiofrequency cardiac arrhythmia . This base thermometric image Magnetic Resonance Imaging ( MRI ) allow real time visualization tissue temperature myocardium sufficient spatial temporal resolution characterize induce thermal lesion . Today , investigator develop validated new method cardiac thermometry , associate rapid MRI acquisition technique ( 4 5 slice per heart beat ) online image reconstruction correction algorithms residual motion , magnetic susceptibility , drift magnetic field , etc ... Recent preclinical study show precision 1°Celsius myocardium , largely sufficient characterize thermal treatment induced radiofrequency typical temperature rise 40°C observed ablation . Temporal evolution temperature pixel provide access calculation accumulate thermal dose relevant indicator induce necrosis . This image method must evaluate human order test robustness real condition ( presence arrhythmia , corpulent patient , etc… ) optimize acquisition parameter image processing . The aim research thus obtain specific MRI sequence image patient , evaluate different algorithms reconstruction processing temperature image . This study mandatory step perspective future clinical treatment cardiac arrhythmia MRI .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Radiofrequency ablation primary treatment atrial ventricular arrhythmia resistant medication . However , absence assessment injury creation radiofrequency application important issue result either recurrence arrhythmia require redo procedure inadequate lesion create , opposite serious complication lesion create large extent extra-cardiac territory preserve . The image team IHU-Liryc develop new method cardiac MRI view diagnostics ( improve spatial temporal resolution , dynamic 3D image contrast improvement ) therapeutic . Hence , one objectives IHU-Liryc improve ablation procedure radiofrequency cardiac arrhythmia order make effective ( Real-time visualization thermal lesion , allow application sufficient energy need transmural lesion ) , safer avoid excessive lesion responsible perforation extension extra-cardiac structure . This base thermometric image MRI allow real time visualization tissue temperature myocardium sufficient spatial temporal resolution characterize induce thermal lesion . MRI thermometry develop last decade successfully apply clinically wide range organ ( uterus , brain , liver , kidney ) direct monitor thermal treatment various pathology ( fibroid Uterus , bone metastasis , liver cancer ) . This innovative technic applicable cardiac arrhythmia due respiratory cardiac movement whose rhythm irregular , well thermal noise generate blood flow image . Today , team develop preclinically validate new rapid MRI method dedicate cardiac thermometry . All patient give oral agreement participate study add examination acquisition sequence . The maximum additional time due specific acquisition study 5 minute , average clinical examination time 45 minute . No follow-up visit end treatment perform , end patient participation research correspond end MRI examination .</detailed_description>
