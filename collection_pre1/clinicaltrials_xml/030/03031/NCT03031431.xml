	<detailed_description>Hypothermia contribute significant portion neonatal death . Kangaroo mother care ( KMC ) safe effective method warming ; however , always feasible , possible setting resuscitation clinical instability . Electric warmer standard care developed country , extremely costly , complicate risk cause hypo hyperthermia misuse , often feasible setting without stable electricity . Through multi-institutional collaboration , investigator develop electricity-free infant warmer . After laboratory base prototype test safety efficacy , investigator aim study supervise use warm routine implementation condition resource-limited setting . The primary aim Phase 1 determine infant warmer safe , effective , usable functional addition KMC . This planned convenience sample patient two district hospital , one relatively warm environment , one colder set use quantitative method observer audit usability functionality . After determination safety effectiveness make necessary modification warmer , Phase 2 aim study warm rural health center transport , ultimately aim use electricity free device due limited access function stable electricity setting . The overall goal project dissemination study result , ultimately infant warmer district national level key policy maker stakeholder , well globally via publication .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Any infant follow criterion caregiver available Kangaroo Mother Care , Kangaroo Mother Care adequate ( less ½ degree Celsius per hour rise temperature ) . 1. axillary temperature &lt; 36 degree C ≥35 degreesC 1a ) If electric warmer available infant 's temperature &lt; 35 degree C , infant would start warm electric warmer infant 's temperature reach 36 degree C , start nonelectric infant warmer use 2 . Infants atrisk hypothermia ( criterion : estimate postmenstrual age &lt; 35 week current body weight &lt; 2.5 kg ) 1 . Any infant whose family unwilling consent study . 2 . Mothers critically ill time infant eligibility deem medically stable nursing staff approach consent . 3 . Any infant contraindication Kangaroo Mother Care ( medical instability ) electrical heat source available . 4 . Any infant initial temperature &lt; 35 degree C electrical heating source available . 5 . Infants within first hour admission neonatal unit first hour life maternity . 6 . Infants require phototherapy 7 . Infants significant skin condition 8 . Infants Hypoxic Ischemic Encephalopathy ( HIE ) Stopping Criteria : If electric heating source available , infant take study warm appropriate source electric heat infant : 1 . Is hypothermic temperature decrease measurement 2 . Is hypothermic temperature begin rise within 30 minute 3 . Is hypothermic heat rate &gt; ½ degree C per hour temperature &gt; 36.5 degree C 4 . Has temperature fall 36 degree C despite maximum exposure heat source 5 . Is ever consider severely ill medical team safely care nonelectric infant warmer . 6 . The warmer remove temperature drop 36 degree , and/or phase change material begin harden .</criteria>
