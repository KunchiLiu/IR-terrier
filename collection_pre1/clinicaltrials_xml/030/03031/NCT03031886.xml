	<brief_title>Energy Flux Fat Oxidation Using Low High Glycaemic Index Foods</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The GI method classify food base food 's ability raise blood glucose level . Low GI food recommend low impact blood glucose concentration . The research set determine effect GI 24 hour blood glucose profile energy regulation Asians . Healthy , normal-weight overweight , Chinese male recruit . There two session ( consist three day session ) consume either high low glycaemic index dinner home high low GI breakfast , lunch snack next day ( whole body calorimeter ) . There least five day two session . Their glycaemic response measure use Continuous Glucose Monitoring System ( CGMS ) throughout period , substrate oxidation measure 10 hour calorimeter ( breakfast , lunch snack ) . This study specifically attempt see whether inclusion low GI sweetener mixed meal sequence impact blood glucose level energy regulation Asians . The study important enable u compute rate fat oxidation influence subject feed mixed meal modulate high GI ( increase glucose excursion ) low GI ( moderate glucose ) 24 hour healthy Asians . Obesity diabetes rate increase exponentially Asian population Singapore exception . Devising way mean staunch escalation therefore priority . The finding research contribute towards long-term objective develop dietary guideline weight glycaemic control . The study data also important provision practical food-based advocacy well weight glycaemic control Asians .</detailed_description>
