	<brief_summary>One major challenge field organ transplantation shortage donor organ . Many patient wait organ transplantation die wait time many patient wait organ transplantation many year detrimental effect quality life , increase morbidity cost relate . Effective strategy , safely extend donor pool , therefore advocate . During last 20 year two main policy gain purpose living donation utilization extend donor 's criterion ( ECD ) . These donor suppose yield lower outcome conventional donor many research protocol develop reduce preservation injury ( PI ) PI-related complication . Static cold storage ( SCS ) standard technique clinical practice liver kidney preservation use particular solution ( Wisconsin , Custodiol Celsior ) able prevent cellular swelling . Recently , graft preservation hypothermic machine perfusion ( HMP ) developing , seem improve early graft function due increase tissue ATP concentration upon reperfusion due continual flush microcirculation remove waste product . The addition oxygen perfusion represent innovation method preservation approve clinical setting seem add improvement graft . The present study design order ass impact hypothermic oxygenate perfusion ( PIO ) marginal human kidney liver compare SCS .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Hypothermic Oxygenated Perfusion Versus Static Cold Storage Marginal Graft</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Our national single-center study , interventional medical device , exploratory safety , assess optimal graft preservation , liver kidney , marginal donor ECD ( Expanded Criteria Donors ) , use hypothermic oxygenate perfusion ( PIO ) compare static cold storage preservation control method custom . PIO apply 10 ECD liver transplant 10 ECD kidney transplant meet inclusion criterion . The marginal graft perfuse oxygenated solution preservation 4Â°C two hour Exiper , Bologna Machine Perfusion , develop Medica s.p.a research group . Flow pressure value set kidney liver perfusion , otherwise . The oxygenation solution perform oxygenator filter decapneization / oxygenation . During perfusion oxygen pressure require 600-750 mmHg ( pO2 80-100 Kpa ) , report scientific literature . The pH , lactate concentration , oxygen ( PO2 ) carbon dioxide ( PCO2 ) partial pressure measure preservation solution T0 T1 mean standard haemogasanalyzer . After transplantation , recipient monitor clinically assess graft function . The liver 's data compare similar case treat SCS centre transplant , retrospectively ; instead , kidney 's data compare `` twin '' organ transplant without PIO , prospectively .</detailed_description>
