	<brief_summary>Venous thromboembolism ( VTE ) encompass pulmonary embolism ( PE ) deep venous thrombosis ( DVT ) continue major patient safety issue reconstructive plastic surgery . Significant morbidity mortality associate VTE event . This disease entity represent common cause preventable in-hospital death evidence 100,000 annual VTE-related death U.S . The associated economic burden substantial , annual cost U.S. healthcare system excess $ 7 billion . Cancer patient identify particularly vulnerable patient population . Of , breast cancer patient represent large group treat plastic surgeon . An increase number breast reconstruction perform U.S. document 35 % increase annual number breast reconstruction since 2000 . Over 106,000 breast reconstruction perform 2015 alone . Of reconstructive modality , autologous breast reconstruction use abdominal flap associate high risk VTE . We believe key element render patient susceptible postoperative VTE inadequate duration chemoprophylaxis . This supported observation VTE risk remain elevated 12 week postoperatively . We hypothesize low extremity deep venous system stasis procedure-specific key contribute factor postoperative VTE risk . This study examine duration postoperative low extremity venous stasis identify patient might benefit extended chemoprophylaxis . First , use Duplex image technology examine low extremity deep venous system preoperatively , postoperative day 1 , day discharge determine patient display radiographic evidence low extremity venous stasis time hospital discharge . Next , determine use bridge mesh repair abdominal fascia decrease degree duration postoperative low extremity venous stasis . Finally , examine association bridge mesh repair abdominal fascia abdominal bulge hernia rate 1 year . A good understanding pathophysiologic mechanism contribute development VTE well surgical mean reduce VTE risk factor potential optimize VTE prophylaxis , thus , favorably impact clinical outcome large patient population .</brief_summary>
