	<detailed_description>Introduction Postoperative pain often think inadequately treat half surgical procedure . Postoperative pain management patient undergo spine surgery often difficult challenge . The challenge opioid tolerance paucity efficient opioid spar agent make pain management even complex . Preoperative strategy minimize postoperative pain include proper surgical technique , would avoid lessen nerve injury , use preemptive analgesia . Studies show intensity acute postoperative pain correlate risk develop persistent pain . Post operative pain result direct activation nociceptors , inflammation , case direct nerve injury nerve . The data preemptive analgesia inconclusive . The concept , however , sparked interest mechanism-based analgesia highlight process central sensitization target analgesic intervention . The use opioids limit side effect profile poor response certain type pain . The multiplicity mechanisms involve pain suggest combination opioid non-opioid analgesic drug enhance analgesia . The concomitant reduction opioid requirement , anticipate use multimodal therapy , also expect reduce side effect . Pregabalin lipophilic gamma-amino-butyric acid ( GABA ) analog anticonvulsant , anxiolytic sleep-modulating property . The effectiveness pregabalin demonstrate several pain model include neuropathic pain , , incisional injury inflammation . Several previous study conduct find use gabapentin , predecessor pregabalin , reduce post operative pain opioid requirement decrease number opioid related adverse event , . Pregabalin pharmacologically active S enantiomer 3-aminomethyl-5-methyl hexanoic acid ; similar pharmacological profile gabapentin . Like gabapentin , pregabalin also bind α-2-δ subunit voltage gate calcium channel , reduce release excitatory neurotransmitter : glutamate , norepinephrine , serotonin , dopamine substance-P . It block development hyperalgesia inhibits central sensitization , . Pregabalin great absorption , bioavailability , anticonvulsant , anti-hyperalgesic anxiolytic property gabapentin , . Rationale select spine surgery . Low back pain major medical problem significant source disability people 45 year age . Spine surgery consider among complex , long-lasting . The postoperative period particularly challenging efficient pain management . Postoperative pain may due nociceptive pain well hyperalgesia secondary surgical trauma . Central sensitization key mechanism development maintenance chronic pain , particularly neuropathic pain pain spine surgery . Rationale use pregabalin Animal study surgical pain model clinical study inflammatory pain volunteer demonstrate intervention cause allodynia hyperalgesia- susceptible pregabalin analogue , . The sensitization dorsal horn neuron demonstrate acute pain model may responsible development chronic pain surgery , , . The ability pregabalin reduce hyperexcitability dorsal neuron induce tissue damage confirm role preemptive analgesia . Its anxiolytic effect ability prevent opioid tolerance could also beneficial . Alternately , antihyperalgesia drug like pregabalin may block pathological pain , leave physiological pain ( protective function ) intact . This class agents function opiate independent pathway affect gut motility . Pharmacodynamics Pharmacokinetics : Pregabalin FDA-approved drug available 50-300 mg/day ( FDA-recommended maximum 300mg/day ) . It rapidly absorb follow oral administration peak plasma concentration occur 0.7-1.3hrs . The mean oral bioavailability 90 % 1-300mg single oral dose . The elimination half-life 5.5-6.5 hr independent dose repeat administration . Plasma clearance essentially equivalent renal clearance . The elimination rate nearly proportional creatinine clearance dose reduction recommend patient low creatinine clearance . Ninety percent dose excrete urine . Adverse event pregabalin Pregabalin generally well tolerate associate mild moderate adverse event dose dependent . The frequently report ( 22-29 % ) dizziness somnolence . Other less common adverse event report dry mouth , peripheral edema , blur vision inability concentrate . Hypothesis : Our hypothesis pre-operative administration pregabalin reduce central neural sensitization , efficiently reverse inflammatory hyperalgesia cause opioid spar effect . These action pregabalin reduce amount opioids need patient intraoperatively immediate postoperative period . The reduction opioids lessen opioid related adverse event augment perioperative satisfaction level .</detailed_description>
