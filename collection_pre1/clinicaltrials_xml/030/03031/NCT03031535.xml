	<brief_summary>The purpose study investigate drug octreotide acetate new intranasal formulation compare FDA-approved subcutaneous ( SC ) injection formulation . The two octreotide acetate formulation evaluate follow separate administration safety tolerability include side effect , speed drug absorb eliminate body , ability drug low level growth hormone ( GH ) insulin-like growth factor 1 ( IGF-1 ) .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Study Intranasal Octreotide ( DP1038 ) Healthy Adult Volunteers</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Octreotide synthetic octapeptide analog naturally occur somatostatin , similar pharmacological effect long duration action . It inhibit pathological secretion GH pituitary adenoma , serotonin hormone tumor gastroenteropancreatic endocrine system . Currently , injectable octreotide somatostatin analog approve , indication acromegaly , carcinoid tumor , vasoactive intestinal peptide tumor . DP1038 , intranasal formulation octreotide , develop treatment acromegaly , rare chronic disorder arise overproduction GH , predominantly pituitary adenoma . Excess GH associate IGF-1 level responsible multiple symptom ( e.g. , headache , tissue swelling , perspiration , joint pain ) significant comorbidities ( e.g. , diabetes , sleep apnea , cardiovascular abnormality hypertension ) . In patient acromegaly , octreotide consistently normalize GH IGF-1 serum concentration , thereby markedly reduce clinical symptom .</detailed_description>
