Burden : The uniqueness child tremendously influenced interaction nature nurture critical period brain development promote foundation brain architecture neuronal connection . 2 . Knowledge gap : Young child Bangladesh prone multiple physiological psycho-social risk factor e.g . poverty , maltreatment , malnutrition , disease , parental illiteracy , maternal depression lack stimulation , preventable . Little report comprehensive package development address early childhood risk promote optimum early childhood development ( ECD ) . 3 . Relevance : The aim study develop evaluate integrate , low cost , feasible center base approach focus positive parent child early life promote early stimulation , minimize childhood maltreatment , boost maternal self-esteem healthy think improve health nutritional ( HN ) status child . Hypothesis ( ) : This integrate intervention promote maternal child-care practice mental health finally improve child 's growth , micro-nutrient status , early brain development compare control group . Objectives : To see effect integrate intervention ( ECD + HN ) growth , micro-nutrient status , child development along effect maternal child-care practice mental health . Methods : Randomly select 2 group identify intervention control ( 150 mother ' from15 cluster group ) . Mothers 8-23 month old child live slum practice harsh child-disciplining identify study population .

	<detailed_description>Hypothesis test : This integrate intervention ) improve child 's growth , hemoglobin , micro-nutrient status ( vitamin B12 folic acid ) , cognitive , motor , language social-emotional development , b ) minimize maltreatment child parent , c ) improve positive parenting ) reduce mother ' stress depressive symptom compare control group . Objectives : Primary : This integrate intervention - Improve cognitive , motor , language social-emotional development child - Minimize maltreatment child caregiver Secondary : This integrate intervention bring follow benefit intervention group compare control group- On children- - Improve height , weight head circumference - Improve hemoglobin , vitamin B12 folic acid status , On mother ( primary caregiver ) - Reduce mother ' stress depressive symptom - Improve positive parenting practice Background Project include Preliminary Observations : The rate global acute malnutrition 16 % rate stunt Bangladesh high 41 % &lt; five yrs child . Moreover , child Bangladesh either deficient different micro-nutrients like iron 10.7 % iodine 34 % inadequate micro-nutrients diet like vitamin B12 folate le 50 % . Many child develop country fail reach developmental potential due lack cognitive stimulation Bangladeshi child limit access play material activity . According Walker colleague 300 million child expose violence globally . Our unpublished data show 32 % child &lt; 2 year subject maltreatment harsh punishment Bangladesh . Depression one lead cause disease burden woman child mother may suffer behavioral problems.. Depression report leading cause disease burden woman age 15-44 year country . The South Asia least woman-friendly society world . Maternal depression become major public health problem society , partly due gender role practice partly poverty . Depression indicate state mind cause symptom like cry spell , sleep problem , depress mood , irritability , fatigue , anxiety , poor concentration interpersonal hypersensitivity , range mild severe nature . Maternal depression affect mother ' health , evidence poor nutrition , high suicide attempt self harm also result poor health developmental outcomes child . In Bangladesh prevalence anxiety depressive symptom high 18-33 % find significant association child maltreatment urban community ) . Rahman et al . test innovative model community-based management depression use Cognitive Behavioral Therapy ( CBT ) Pakistan report improvement maternal depression 6 month postpartum . Considering similar family structure , religion culture Bangladesh Pakistan , likely program work Bangladesh . Despite prevalent child maltreatment Bangladesh , intervention reduce maltreatment child 5 yr age even rare . Similarly , though attention divert ECD several year , program address child 3 yrs age . Study design would probably 1st intervention use robust research method test efficacy integrate method address ECD , child maltreatment well health nutrition young child . Investigators modify exist curriculum focus child maltreatment . Investigators target poor family urban slum deprive service face risk factor hope improve family ' condition use low-cost intervention . Researchers target mother study participant also primary caregiver child especially young age major role child development . Mothers also vulnerable depression father Bangladeshi culture . In addition , culturally appropriate tool ass child maltreatment Bangladesh . In project researcher attempt modify adapt exist instrument need develop new tool suitable use Bangladesh . Research Design Methods Population sample size : This study conduct semi-urban area ( preferably Kamalapur ) Dhaka , Bangladesh . Total sample 10 mother-child duo randomly select 30 cluster ( n=300 ) , half ( n=150 ) beneficiary intervention . Plan work : The intervention package pilot non study community feasibility modify accordingly . The select mother-child duo invite field office baseline assessment . Intervention group invite join center-based group session fortnightly one year , control group receive exist government health message . Both group receive free health service study medical officer acute illness . After year , final assessment do group . At baseline end line mother-child interaction observe sub-sample population . Procedures : It cluster-randomized trial . Clusters form base number household member ( use cook pot ) well geographical boundary . On average 150-200 household cluster , may variation household number per cluster per stratum.Total sample 10 mother-child duo randomly select 30 cluster ( n=300 ) , half ( n=150 ) beneficiary intervention . Plan work : The intervention package pilot non study community feasibility modify accordingly . The select mother-child duo invite field office baseline assessment . Intervention group invite join center-based group session fortnightly 1 year , control group receive exist government health message . Both group receive free health service study medical officer acute illness . After year , final assessment do group . At baseline end line mother-child interaction observe sub-sample population . At begin study , 4 Focus group discussion ( 8-10 non-study mother ) conduct community know mother ' parenting practice . At middle study qualitative information ( case report 30 In-Depth Interviews ) collect form intervene mother intervention package receiving . Intervened mother interview home accord time availability . Key Informant 's Interview ( KII ) conduct year 2 play leader ( deliver intervention ) 2 supervisor ( train play leader monitor ) . Interviews take tape record consent participant . 1 . Preparatory work : At first phase researcher select site also complete process 'Ethical Review ' project . Screening enrollment : After take consent , screen mother 8 23 month old child , practice harsh discipline conduct 30 identified cluster train health worker use ISPCAN Child Abuse Screening Tool-Parent Version ( ICAST-P ) . Researchers already use modify version tool Bangladesh . According primary investigation 10 % mother 8 23 month old child study field site . With estimation get 10 eligible mother cluster researcher group screen 100 mother . Mothers fulfill study enrollment criterion offer join study invite test center baseline assessment . At time research group start develop study material : For intervention : Development pilot follow manual , already exist need simplification adaptation - Psycho-social stimulation individual visit - Cognitive behavioral therapy For assessment : Cultural adaptation , Standard Operating Procedures ( SOPs ) preparation field test follow tool - Bayley Scale Infant Toddler Development ( Already adapt , take permission Pearson 's use ) - Field test adaptation ISPCAN Child Abuse Screening Tool -Parent Version ( ICAST-P ) - Qualitative questionnaire - Observational tool Tools adapt , test ready use - Parenting questionnaire - Home observation measurement environment ( HOME ) - Rosenberg Self Esteem Scale - CES-D measure depressive symptom - Socio-economic status ( SES ) questionnaire - Wolke 's Behavior Rating scale - Anthropometric measurement 2 . Baseline assessment : On child : Bayley Scales Infant Toddler Development ( Bayley-III ) use assess cognitive , language motor development child . The test use many develop country , instrument choice much nutrition child development research age country like Indonesia Brazil . The Bayley often sensitive change follow intervention . Because Bayley standardize Bangladesh , researcher compare child 's score test norm child country . Study aim compare development group child within community . Bayley usually take hour test child . The child 's behavior Bayley test rat five 9-point scale use modified version scale develop Wolke ( 1990 ) . These rating include infant ' activity ( still=1 overactive=9 ) , emotional tone ( unhappy=1 radiates happiness=9 ) , approach responsiveness examiner first 10 minute ( avoiding=1to friendly inviting=9 ) , cooperation test procedure ( resists suggestions=1to always complies=9 ) , vocalization ( quiet=1to constant vocalization=9 ) . The scale use several study Bangladesh sensitive intervention effect . Anthropometry : Mother child 's anthropometric measurement ( height weight mother ; length/height , weight , MUAC head circumference child ) assess use standard procedure . On mother ' : Maternal self esteem : This assess use adapt version Rosenberg Self Esteem Scale , widely use measure self esteem research purpose . It use previously Bangladesh research team others valid instrument . Information child maltreatment neglect : The International Society Prevention Child Abuse Neglect ( ISPCAN ) develop ISPCAN Child Abuse Screening Tool- Parent Version ( ICAST-P ) widely use develop country , like India Jamaica . This research group already use modify version tool Bangladesh hospital mother . Measurement maternal depressive symptom do use Center Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale ( CES-D ) . This tool use Bangladesh South-East Asian country . Quality stimulation home assess use Caldwell 's Home Observation Measurement Environment ( HOME ) modify Bangladesh use study research team . Other measurement : These follow measure collect covariates - Socioeconomic status : On enrollment information collect family 's asset ( furniture e.g . bed/tables/chairs , electrical household equipment 's e.g . radio/TV/fan , farm animal , vehicle e.g . rickshaw/boat/bicycle/motorbike , etc . ) , housing condition ( type roof , floor wall ) , access water sanitation , electricity , crowd condition , parental education occupation . An asset quintile create available asset available household level . Observational tool : Structured observation checklist use see mother-child interaction Qualitative assessment use conduct focus group discussion , depth interview case report . 3 . Intervention : It low cost intervention focus building awareness among population risk hand train deliver trained health worker minimum educational level low salary . Our previous experience show possible train paraprofessional provide intervention intensity . We also show psycho-social stimulation provide 10 12 month improve development behavior child significantly . Two week train one week 's field practice require train staff . We train play leader regard whole intervention package include stimulation , Cognitive Behavioral Therapy , health nutrition message include infant young child feeding practice , good hygiene practice , positive parenting message ( stimulation , learn play , love affection ) . There one-hour session fortnightly 11 month . Attending 2 session per month feasible mother . This intervention address major risk factor e.g . negative parenting , lack stimulation , child maltreatment , malnutrition , maternal stress/depressive symptom , faulty care-seeking practice due knowledge gap , etc . use combined package . There combination 3 type intervention : ( ) Early stimulation prevention maltreatment positive parenting , boost maternal self-esteem stress management ( ECD ) : Psycho-social stimulation intervention follow set culturally appropriate , semi-structured , child 's age appropriate curriculum . This integrated approach give group mother child . During session field-workers show mother play home-made toy book interact child way promote development . Along stimulation program , field worker also provide advice regard positive parenting boost maternal self esteem stress management . Care take appreciate mother activity positive reinforcement strongly encourage . The developmental activity conduct playful manner work-oriented activity . The activity curriculum order difficulty level health worker train choose level child accord ability activity . ( ii ) Health education sprinkle supplementation ( HN ) : The participant receive health nutrition message improve child 's health . In addition child receive multiple micro-nutrient powder ( Vitamin A 400 µg , vitamin D 5 µg , vitamin E 5 mg , vitamin C 30 mg , thiamine 0.5 mg , riboflavin 0.5 mg , niacin 6 mg , pyridoxine 0.5 mg , vitamin B12 0.9 mg , folate 150 µg , iron 10 mg , zinc 4.1 mg , copper 0.56 mg , selenium 17.0 µg iodine 90 µg ) supplementation household level ( 90 sachet 6 month-period ) . ( iii ) Cognitive Behavioral Therapy : Intervention help mother change negative behaviour improve self care , child care , income generation activity , follow `` Thinking Healthy Program '' model Rahman colleague use cognitive behavior therapy ( CBT ) . CBT improve maternal behaviour lead `` positive parenting '' prevention maltreatment . Cognitive Behavioral Therapy `` evidence-based structured form talk therapy aim alter cycle unhelpful unhealthy thinking ( cognition ) result undesirable action ( behavior ) . '' Cognitive Behavioral Therapy specifically focus `` change think style toward positive '' associate medication . CBT find effective manage treat depression , also variety conditions-e.g . mood , personality , stress , eat habit , tic etc.This approach rural mother similar context show positive impact child outcome Pakistan , culturally economically similar Bangladesh . CBT aim alter cycle negative thinking people positive direction . The cycle negative thought usually break two way use Cognitive Behavioral aspect therapy - - Cognitive aspect CBT : This focus alter way think person ( mother ) include thought , belief , idea , attitude , assumption , mental imagery , way direct attention . - Behavioral aspect CBT : This focus help mother face challenge opportunity facilitate child-raising sound clear mind- take necessary action likely desire outcomes . This model proven effective approach break cycle depression improve confidence , cop strategy assertiveness poor community low resource setting . The cycle break two way CBT- cognitive aspect ( direct attention positive direction ) behavioral aspect ( help meet challenge ) . ) Final assessment , data entry data analysis : After 11 month intervention , participant invite centre end line assessment . The assessment tool use base line . Simultaneous data entry continue SPSS software . After data cleaning , preliminary analysis do accord follow plan . All baseline variable use compare lose test group well intervention control group . The two time-point assessment also provide information within group change . Some variable e.g . HOME , mother-child interaction , parenting , childcare etc . use either mediator outcome separate analyse Outcome Variables : On Mothers- 1 . Maternal stress depressive symptom use CES-D baseline end . 2 . Self Esteem assessment use Rosenberg Self Esteem Scale baseline end test centre 3 . Information child maltreatment parent collect baseline screen home end . 4 . Home observation measurement environment ( HOME ) household level , twice ( baseline end ) On Children- 1 . Child 's cognitive , motor language assessment use Bayley-III behavioral assessment test use Wolke 's Behavior Rating Scale , baseline end test centre . Children accompany mother centre . ( 45 min ) 2 . Children 's Micronutrient status ( vitamin B12 folic acid ) baseline end test centre 3 . Children 's Hemoglobin status 4 . Children 's height , weight , MUAC , head circumference baseline end Covariates- 1 . Socio-economic variable ( asset index/ quintile ) 2 . Demographic variable ( housing/ sanitation ) 3 . Maternal nutritional status ( BMI ) 4 . Child 's age sex 5 . Compliance micro-nutrients dietary recall 6 . Morbidity Sample Size Calculation Outcome ( Primary Secondary ) Variable ( ) Considering 5 % level significance , 80 % power , improvement 0.4 SD child 's developmental outcome base previous experience , ICC 0.01 30 % drop out , need enroll 150 mother-child duo group per equation below- 2 ( SD ) 2 n = -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- X f ( αβ ) ( M1-M2 ) 2 n : sample require , SD : 16 ( base previous data Bayley Score ) α : 5 % level significance β : 80 % power f= α*β M1-M2 = Difference = 6.4 point ( base previous study ) So calculated n=100 Considering cluster need adjust sample size multiply value ( 100 ) design effect . Design Effect = 1 + [ ( m-1 ) * ICC correspond average number infant per cluster . Assuming average 10 mother-child duos/cluster . Using ICC = 0.01 , design effect = 1 + [ ( 10-1 ) * ICC = 1 + 0.9 = 1.09 Therefore new sample size = 100*1.09= 109 per group , consider 30 % drop-out sample size per group around 150 infant stimulation group 150 infant control group . Data Analysis icddr , b scientist co-investigators research project analyze data use Stata/SPSS . All data check normality . Log transformation do normally distribute . Indices create require ( eg : SES index , housing index etc ) . Pearson 's correlation conduct examine association age child developmental measure . A comparison do socio-demographic characteristic intervene control group use t-test continuous variable χ2 categorical variable . Partial correlation use control age sex examine association different covariates developmental score . Finally , multi-level regression analyse do . In regression analysis , outcome final developmental score , age enrollment , relevant initial score , intervention predictor . Again , comparison do treatment effect intervention control group . All variable different intervention control group baseline correlate developmental outcome address high co-linearity among covariates analysis . The main outcome child 's cognitive , language motor development measure Bayley Scales Infant Toddler Development . In addition expect improvement growth , home stimulation mother 's positive parenting . It also expect improvement hemoglobin micro-nutrient status ( vitamin B12 folic acid ) 150 child intervention group end project . At time expect reduction mother ' stress depressive symptom rate maltreatment child parent . A cost analysis conduct base success indicator , cost per successful outcome calculate total cost intervention program . Data Safety Monitoring Plan ( DSMP ) Researcher group expect low risk activity study put study population increase risk adverse outcome , however human activity unforeseen untoward consequence . researcher actively monitor impact intervention population . The primary objective evaluation understand practice , knowledge , attitude towards intervention . researcher include question evaluation ask note adverse outcome . If field team learn adverse outcome train report study team day learn . Ethical Assurance Protection Human right The project approve Institutional Review Board icddr , b . Investigator group collect write informed consent Bengali parent start data collection . Research group ensure confidentiality collect data sensitive issue like maternal depression . Hard copy data keep locked cabinet accessible investigator . The electronic data name identifiable information . Clinically depress mother refer counsellor psychiatrist need . Children mental retardation developmental disability refer proper place treatment .</detailed_description>
