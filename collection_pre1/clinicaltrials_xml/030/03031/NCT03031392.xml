	<brief_summary>Bleeding probe demonstrate high specificity certain level sensitivity detect periodontal disease . Again , understand weak hemidesmosome attachment implant surface imperative discern probe penetration extent subsequent bleeding . In presence inflammation , bleed present indicate high sensitivity probe deep site ; nevertheless lack thereof healthy condition seem translate high specificity . In sense , noteworthy mention mucogingival shift implant placement often decrease presence keratinize mucosa , trigger great inflammatory condition peri-implant tissue . Thereupon , bleed probe , although might reliably indicate presence disease , seem suitable diagnostic parameter . On side , suppuration characterizes necrosis peri-implant tissue , rich polymorphonuclear cell , sensitive indicator bone turnover . In sense , must note , detect early stage bone resorption occur yet , might consequence foreign body reaction ( i.e. , residual cement floss ) . Therefore , diagnosis peri-implantitis , radiographic examination must always incorporate clinical assessment 'gold standard ' . Hence , aim case-control study assess diagnostic accuracy peri-implantitis-related clinical parameter compare otherwise healthy dental implant .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>All subject enrol consecutively evaluated routine peri-implant maintenance dental implant fix prosthesis rehabilitation minimum period 12 month final prosthesis delivery . Patients contact informed participate cross-sectional assessment identify presence peri-implant disease . Eligible implant ideal prosthetically drive position , otherwise exclude analysis . Moreover , implant could accurately record probe depth due inadequate prosthesis design exclude . Baseline periapical x-ray time prosthesis delivery retrospective assess exclude implant early peri-implant bone loss function . A detailed description risk factor indicator peri-implant disease explain stage . Additionally , patient thoroughly instructed plaque control home care strategy include limited interdental brush nylon-coated core wire , soft toothbrush ( manual power ) floss stiffen end clean multiple unit fixed-prosthesis . Moreover , treat patient encourage routinely enroll peri-implant maintenance therapy program . The present case-control multi-center study conduct accordance Helsinki declaration human study receive approval ethic committee University Extremadura ( Badajoz , Spain ) University Valencia ( Valencia , Spain ) University Belgrade ( Belgrade , Serbia ) . An informed write consent sign subject enrol present study .</detailed_description>
