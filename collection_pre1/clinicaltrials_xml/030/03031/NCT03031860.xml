	<brief_title>Semi-quantitative Cough Strength Score ( SCSS )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Patients evaluate readiness wean mechanical ventilation . If complete Spontaneous Breathing Trial ( SBT ) extubation . To measure Semiquantitative Cough Strength Score ( SCSS ) , investigator put patient 30° 45° , measure SCSS , first . The investigator enhance patient cough much effort , investigator disconnect ventilator . The cough strength score 0 5 follow : 0 = cough command , 1 = audible movement air endotracheal tube audible cough , 2 = weakly ( barely ) audible cough , 3 = clearly audible cough , 4 = strong cough 5 = multiple sequential strong cough .</detailed_description>
	<criteria>Patients ready wean mechanical ventilation successful spontaneous breathe trial ( SBT ) Age : 1865 yr Mechanical ventilation 24hrs Glasgow Coma Scale:1215 exclude patient less 18 year old patient experience less 24hrs mechanical ventilation . Patients undergone tracheotomy extubation Chronically ill patient ( Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease patient , lung cancer )</criteria>
