	<brief_summary>Brain arteriovenous malformation abnormal communication brain artery vein intervene tangle abnormal artery ( nidus ) . Brain AVMs may asymptomatic symptomatic , present acute hemorrhage neurological symptom . Brain AVMs bleed carry yearly risk intracranial hemorrhage approximately 4 % ( Ondra et al. ) . The management multidisciplinary involve neurosurgeon , interventional neuroradiologists , radiation physician , neurologist ally health care personnel . Patients may treat open neurosurgery , endovascular embolization , radiation therapy combination treatment . The goal treatment eliminate brain AVM preserving normal flow surround normal artery . This involve obliteration shunt blood via AVM artery vein variety treatment . The treatment regimen individualize dependent natural history , angioarchitecture , location , risk treatment ( ) patient wish .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Advanced 3 T MRI Evaluation Brain AVMs With SWAN Time-resolved MRA : Comparison Catheter Angiography</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Why MRI important management brain AVMs i.e . conventional catheter angiography ? The `` gold standard '' evaluation brain AVMs catheter angiography . However , procedure invasive , involve ionize radiation , exposure contrast medium potential nephrotoxicity allergy carry 1 % risk morbidity include stroke . In contrast , MRI non-invasive method evaluate brain AVMs add advantage catheter angiography depict anatomical localization AVM within brain tissue . However , currently MRI limit lack ability demonstrate shunt blood AVM , important indicator brain AVM still present treatment . Susceptibility-weighted imaging ( SWI ) promise new MRI technology indirectly evaluate amount oxygen within blood vessel . Small case series explore utility SWI brain AVMs report suggest venous drainage brain AVMs often abnormally hyperintense abnormal shunting oxygenate blood AVM arteries drain vein [ Fig 1 ] ( Bharathi D et al. ) . Typically normal tissue , oxygenate blood SWI image hyperintense deoxygenate blood normal vein hypointense . Developmental venous anomaly demonstrate enlarge drain vein normal variant must distinguish true AVMs [ Fig . 2 ] . However , capability prospectively evaluate systematic fashion . Our current standard contrast-enhanced evaluation brain AVMs perform contrast-enhanced MRA ( CEMRA ) follow post-contrast T1 volumetric whole brain sequence . The CEMRA allow depiction contrast maximal intensity pass brain first pas . The post contrast T1 scan demonstrate static contrast pooling within brain AVM . However , neither CEMRA post contrast scan provide information speed contrast move brain AVM ie . shunt . Evaluation temporal passage contrast brain AVM would require dynamic time-resolved technique adequate temporal resolution distinguish early v late v shunt within brain AVM . What current GE technology MRI brain AVMs ? Susceptibility-weighted angiography ( Susceptibility-weighted angiography = SWAN ) image GE 3 T attempt preliminary evidence suggest image low resolution difficult interpret . Similarly , early experience time resolve MRA ( TRMRA ) suggest poor spatial temporal resolution use standard `` out-of-the-box '' protocol . Thus , significant opportunity improve SWAN TRMRA , evaluate evolution progressive obliteration AVM nidus . Specifically , attractive brain AVMs treat radiosurgery MRI require clinical ground treatment planning purpose .</detailed_description>
