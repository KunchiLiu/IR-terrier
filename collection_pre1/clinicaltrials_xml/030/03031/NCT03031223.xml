	<brief_summary>Spinal cord injuries become increasingly frequent due mainly increase urban violence . The grow number automobile collision violence-related event merit particular attention , occurrence lead death disability stem spinal injury . The severity consequences depend location affect degree destruction afferent efferent spinal cord pathway , high , extensive injury lead less physical fitness functional independence . Unfortunately , injured neuron central nervous system unable regenerate follow spinal injury spinal cord regeneration therefore major challenge researcher field neuroscience neurologia . Upon receive external stimulus , central nervous system believe adapt reorganize use mechanisms compensate neuronal loss promote , even partially , remodel remain synaptic connection , lead new neuronal sprouting . Low-level laser therapy ( LLLT ) prove possible option stimulation repair process central nervous system . It plausible type therapy offer benefit previously establish type tissue , stimulation bone formation , neovascularization regeneration peripheral nerve . Research group investigate efficacy LLLT treatment spinal cord injury demonstrate laser therapy administer simultaneously injure sciatic nerve correspond segment spinal cord accelerate regeneration process injured peripheral nerve .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Evaluation Sensory-motor Response Low-level Laser Therapy Treatment Spinal Injuries</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>General objective - Evaluate effect LLLT sensory-motor response individual suffer spinal cord injury . Specific objectives - Investigate maintenance possible sensory-motor response electromyographic analysis conduct LLLT well one , 15 , 30 , 45 60 day intervention ; evaluate functional independence quality life individual suffer spinal cord injury . Trial design - A randomized , control , clinical trial propose . display flowchart development study . The trial conduct compliance norm govern research involve human subject submit approval Institutional Review Board University Nove de Julho , São Paulo , Brazil . All participant legal guardian receive clarification regard objective procedure study agree participate sign statement inform consent . Methods : Participants , intervention outcome Study set - Physical Therapy Clinics University Nove de Julho , São Paulo , Brazil Exclusion criterion : complete spinal cord injury , cognitive impairment . Interventions - The volunteer randomly allocate control group treatment group . Evaluations conduct intervention use electromyography myotome corresponding injured spinal nerve root . The treatment group receive LLLT follow protocol outline : LLLT protocol - Based Byrnes et al . Holanda et al. , radiance administer injury site transcutaneously wavelength 808 nm use Twin Flex Evolution diode laser ( MMO Equipamento Opto-Eletronicos , Brazil ) . Twelve session hold ( three per week four week ) . The dose administer surface skin 983 J/cm2 per session , treatment area 4.72 W/cm² total radiant energy 25 J . According literature , dose capable enhance functional recovery follow injury . Recruitment Individuals recruit physical therapy clinic University Nove de Julho ( São Paulo , Brazil ) well spinal injury association , necessary . Methods : Assignment intervention ( control trial ) Sequence generation The individual allocate different group base number randomly generate computer program . Allocation concealment mechanism Allocation conceal use seal opaque envelope . Each envelope number outside contain name participant inside . The envelope randomly select use computer program , formation control group first , follow treatment group . Implementation The volunteer enrol research project MSc . Fernanda Cordeiro da Silva envelop prepared researcher Paulo Roberto da Costa Palácio . Dr. Sandra Kalil Bussadori head project run computer program random allocation volunteer different group . Blinding - There blind . Methods : Data collection , management analysis The data tabulate treated use SPSS 20.0 program WindowsTM . The data submit descriptive statistical analysis . The chi-square test Fisher 's exact test use establish association categorical variable . The Student 's t-test use comparison mean electromyographic signal . Pearson 's correlation coefficient calculate analysis correlation continuous variable . The level significance 95 % ( p &lt; 0.05 ) . Ethics dissemination Research ethic approval - The trial conduct compliance norm govern research involve human subject submit approval Institutional Review Board University Nove de Julho , São Paulo , Brazil . All participant legal guardian receive clarification regard objective procedure study agree participate sign statement inform consent . Consent assent - Researchers MSc . Fernanda Cordeiro da Silva Paulo Roberto da Costa Palácio present explain statement inform consent volunteer . All participant inform regard voluntary nature participation possibility withdraw study time negative consequence . Confidentiality - All data collect volunteer evaluation treatment store hard drive ensure confidentiality . Declaration interest - The author declare conflict interest . Access data - Only researcher directly involve study access data . Ancillary post-trial care - At end study , volunteer allocate control group receive LLLT protocol administer treatment group avoid inequality regard treatment among individual . Dissemination policy - The finding publish scientific journal present conference application laser therapy treatment individual spinal injury .</detailed_description>
