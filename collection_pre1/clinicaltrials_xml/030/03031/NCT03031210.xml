	<brief_title>Twice Daily Treatment With Amoxicillin Non-severe Community Acquired Pneumonia .</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>A single-center , non-blinded , pragmatic , randomized-controlled , non-inferiority clinical trial conduct urban , university-affiliated , tertiary care pediatric hospital ED . All patient three month old 18 year age symptoms sign suggestive non-severe community acquire pneumonia base respiratory complaint pulmonary infiltrate identify trained paediatrician emergency physician eligible present study . Study participant randomly allocate receive either amoxicillin ( 90mg/kg per day ) twice thrice daily regimen . Primary outcome treatment failure within 10 day enrolment define hospitalisation , need change antibiotic ( persistence fever 72 hour , clinical deterioration , comorbid condition development serious adverse reaction ) death . ED revisit within 72 hour , second course antibiotic clinical recurrence rate evaluate follow-up assessment well percent adverse event encounter , number day miss ( work , school daycare ) , coverage vaccination rate , protocol adherence patient parental satisfaction . The primary analysis use intention-to-treat approach . Per-protocol analysis also carry compare failure rate . Accounting maximal 10 % drop-off rate , sample size 685 participant per arm calculate power 90 % identify difference â‰¤ 5 % alpha value 0.05 .</detailed_description>

History serious nonimmunoglobulin Emediated reaction ( eg , StevensJohnson syndrome toxic epidermal necrolysis ) attribute amoxicilin . Caregiver unable provide consent ( language barrier lack caregiver presence ) Underlying unstable chronic illness ( ie . cystic fibrosis , immune suppression , active tuberculosis , bronchiectasis active pulmonary malignancy ) Persistent/chronic pneumonia syndrome ( symptom &gt; 2 week ) , suspect physician cause atypical pathogen , hospital acquire pneumonia ( hospitalize within 2 week prior enrolment ) , aspiration pneumonia recurrent pneumonia . Any history receiving amoxicillin within past month Need hospitalisation reason ( ie . persistent vomiting , severe lifethreatening infection septicaemia meningitis require intravenous antimicrobial agent ) Previous participation study</criteria>
