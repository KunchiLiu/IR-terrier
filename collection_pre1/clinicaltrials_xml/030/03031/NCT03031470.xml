	<detailed_description>Liver transplantation currently treatment choice end-stage liver cirrhosis different origin , well number inborn metabolism disorder liver tumor . The need perform liver transplantation high amount 10 - 20 patient per 1 million population per year . The indication liver transplantation presence irreversible liver disease estimate life expectancy le 12 month , absence another treatment , presence chronic liver disease , significantly reduce patient 's quality life ability work , well progressive liver disease life expectancy less case liver transplantation ( liver transplantation 85 % patient survive 1 year 70 % - 5 year ) . Currently , 200 liver transplantation perform annually Russia , 10 time low exist need far number similar operation perform abroad . The vast majority liver transplant adult recipient perform use liver allograft cadaveric donor . The rigorous list requirement transplant restricts significantly use cadaveric liver . Thus , need expand pool donor organ suitable transplantation press issue . Experimental clinical evidence demonstrate harmful short long-term effect ischemia-reperfusion injury ( IRI ) donor organ outcome intervention perform . Severe manifestation IRI liver transplant ( LT ) one main reason increase length hospitalization , high cost treat patient post- surgery period , development persistent early allograft dysfunction loss , frequent crisis acute rejection , acute renal multiple organ failure , mortality operate patient . IRI cause termination subsequent restoration blood flow less inevitable donor organ . The mechanism ischemia-reperfusion syndrome involves interaction vascular endothelium , interstitial space , circulate cell variety biochemical reaction , primary link chain pathological process local generalized nature microcirculatory disorder . Early allograft dysfunction important predictor severe complication mortality OLT . The incidence early allograft dysfunction approximately 25 % ( range 9.3 43.7 % subject different definition classification condition ) . Retrospective evaluation incidence early allograft dysfunction perform Russian lead transplantation institution - N.V. Sklifosovsky Research Institute Emergency Care , confirm development type complication 25 % case ( N = 202 ) . Death occur population patient early allograft dysfunction almost twice rate patient normal function transplant first 7 day OLT ( p &lt; 0.005 ) . Therefore , yet , search drug may effective prevention early allograft dysfunction still relevant issue . Reparixin new , potent specific inhibitor chemokine CXCL8 ( Interleukin-8 ) . With regard mechanism action Reparixin , early preclinical development aim specific inhibition migration polymorphonuclear neutrophils prevention ischemia- reperfusion injury . Reparixin receive orphan drug designation EU September 2001 USA January 2003 prevention delay graft function solid organ transplantation . More recently orphan drug designation grant EU ( September 2011 ) `` prevention graft loss pancreatic islet transplantation '' US ( September 2012 ) `` prevention graft loss islet cell transplantation '' . This pilot clinical study design evaluate efficacy safety Reparixin agent prevent early allograft dysfunction cause ischemia-reperfusion injury patient undergo orthotopic liver transplantation .</detailed_description>
