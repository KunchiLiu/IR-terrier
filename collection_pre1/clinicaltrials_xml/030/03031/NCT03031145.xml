	<brief_title>Investigation Impact Smoking Status Allergen-induced Nasal Airway Inflammation Using Cat Hair ( Felis Domesticus ) Extract Nasal Allergen Challenge Model</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The recent increase popularity e-cigarettes smoking cessation combination conventional cigarette let safety concern regard potential role respiratory disease . These tobacco alternative device initially perceive `` safer '' alternative cigarette market without much know health effect . Increasing evidence contain few toxin carcinogens conventional cigarette , involve delivery ultrafine particle low airway contain heavy metal chemical . Tobacco Smoke may augment allergic inflammation result allergic rhinitis and/or asthma . Animal model allergic asthma demonstrate aggravation allergen -induced airway inflammation follow inhalation e-cig cartridge solution , increase airway eosinophil infiltration , production Th2 cytokine , airway hyperresponsivness . In vitro study human tissue demonstrate pro-inflammatory response similar way tobacco smoke , yet head-to-head comparison effect two exposure perform human . Use tobacco product remain pervasive problem society around world , significant impact respiratory health quality life . With emergence new non-tobacco base nicotine product like e-cigarettes , important understand impact substance respiratory health disease . The aim f study study impact product allergic inflammation cat allergic subject already routinely use e-cigarettes compare response cigarette smoker non-smokers . A thorough understanding potential health impact tobacco alternative substance seed , especially give rise popularity product adolescent young adult substance particular appeal give purport safety : variety flavor choose .</detailed_description>

Nighttime symptom cough wheeze great 1x/week baseline ( clearly recognize viral induced asthma exacerbation ) would characteristic person moderate severe persistent asthma outline current NHLBI guideline diagnosis management asthma . 12 . Exacerbation asthma 2x/week would characteristic person moderate severe persistent asthma outline current NHLBI guideline diagnosis management asthma . 13 . Daily requirement albuterol due asthma symptom ( cough , wheeze , chest tightness ) would characteristic person moderate severe persistent asthma outline current NHLBI guideline diagnosis management asthma . ( Not include prophylactic use albuterol prior exercise ) . 14 . Viral upper respiratory tract infection within 4 week challenge . 15 . Any acute infection require antibiotic within 4 week challenge . 16 . Participating allergen inhalation study within 2 week challenge use investigational agent within last 30 day . 17 .
