	<brief_title>A Safety , Pharmacokinetic , Single Ascending Dose Study Tesevatinib Pediatric Subjects With Autosomal Recessive Polycystic Kidney Disease ( ARPKD )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This study phase 1 clinical trial focus evaluate safety tolerability Tesevatinib study drug , oral solution 15mg/mL concentration . To determine safety tesevatinib liquid formulation pediatric subject ( age 5-12 ) ARPKD , participant receive active study drug Day 1 study enrollment . To evaluate plasma pharmacokinetics ( PK ) single dose tesevatinib ARPKD pediatric subject , blood PK sample draw Day 1 , 2 , 3 study . Tesevatinib dose follow PK 2-week safety evaluation . After completion safety review subject may continue onto next dose group discretion investigator medical monitor . There three dose arm study . Six participant enroll first dose cohort ( 0.25mg/kg ) . Participants may enrol two subsequent cohort increase dose ( 0.5mg/kg 1.0mg/kg ) , safety reporting favorable . Medical history take Screening Visit . Echocardiogram perform Screening Day 14 . Subjects undergo audiology testing , well ocular monitoring Screening Day 14 . Blood drawn panel laboratory test .</detailed_description>
