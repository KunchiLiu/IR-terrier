	<brief_title>A Study Assessing Efficacy &amp; Safety Ribociclib Patients With Advanced Well/Dedifferentiated Liposarcoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The expect duration study 36 month ( 24 month accrual period 12 month follow period ) . Enrollment screen treatment phase study stop actual subject number achieve . This single arm single institution , open label , prospective , phase II trial evaluate efficacy safety oral 600mg/daily 28 day cycle ribociclib advanced well-differentiated liposarcoma ( WDL ) de-differentiated liposarcoma ( DDL ) patient . Number patient study reflect reconciliation statistical requirement incidence . Treatment continue disease progression , development unacceptable toxicity , noncompliance withdrawal consent patient investigator decision . All screening requirement must complete within 28 day visit ( except CDK4/6 amplification pRb , p16 cyclin D stain status may complete advance ) . Patients examine cycle 1 day-1 every 2 week , include complete blood count ( CBC ) chemistry , first 8 week treatment , thereafter every month disease progression . CT/MRI imaging ( contrast ) perform every 8 week response evaluation . Clinical benefit well individual category response ( complete response ( CR ) , partial response ( PR ) , stable disease ( SD ) progressive disease ( PD ) determine use Response Evaluation Criteria Solid Tumors 1.1 ( RECIST ) . Response duration endpoint , include PFS , PFS 12 week OS assess use Kaplan-Meier method . Toxicity ( AEs ) record use NCI- Common Toxicity Criteria Adverse Effects v 4.03 ( NCI-CTCAE ) . Screening procedure include medical history , physical examination , blood test , baseline CT/MRI image formalin-fixed tissue submission FoundationOne mutational analysis .</detailed_description>
