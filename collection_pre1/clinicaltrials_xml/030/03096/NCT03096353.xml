	<brief_summary>Objective : Our recent pilot study find evidence suggest block endogenous opioid release increase pleasantness associate skin stroke . Deep pressure touch ( observed hug massage ) also typically conveys sense pleasantness . This increase pleasantness contrast evidence block endogenous opioid release increase pain . The current study examine role endogenous opioids pleasantness light skin stroke deep pressure touch , contrast role unpleasantness painful heat stimulus . Further , examine neural basis observe perceptual change , use fMRI . This study constitute first study K99 phase K99/R00 grant application recently submit NCCIH Dr. Laura Case . Study Population : 30 healthy participant enrol study . Design : Participants receive intravenous saline intravenous naloxone separate day investigate effect mu-opioid antagonism intensity pleasantness superficial deep affective touch intensity unpleasantness cutaneous heat pain . Using double-blind cross-over design , functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging ( fMRI ) conduct sensory test infusion drug examine neural mediation opioid effect touch perception . Ratings mood , anxiety , pain intensity , pleasantness/unpleasantness , want liking also collect throughout study session . Outcome measure : We compare subjective rating ( mood , calmness , anxiety , pleasantness , want , like , pain intensity unpleasantness ) naloxone saline : 1 ) Determine whether naloxone increase pleasantness and/or intensity affective touch ( light brush deep compression ) ; 2 ) Determine whether naloxone increase unpleasantness and/or intensity cutaneous heat pain ; 3 ) Determine role mood anxiety change mediate effect endogenous opioids perceptual measure ; 3 ) Determine change brain activation related effect .</brief_summary>
