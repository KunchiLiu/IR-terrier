	<brief_title>A Study Safety , Tolerability Pharmacokinetics Orally-administered GC4702 Healthy Volunteers</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The study conduct two part : Part 1 , main study , double-blind , randomize , placebo-controlled , single-ascending dose assessment GC4702 . Part 2 , conduct Part 1 contingent upon result Part 1 , include food-effect cohort use randomized design fed/fasted condition . Consenting subject undergo screening procedure within 28 day start dose . Pharmacokinetics ( PK ) ( parent drug major metabolite ) assess plasma urine subject . Part 1 : GC4702 match placebo administer mouth single dose . Subjects Cohort 3 receive dose ( dry powder formulation ) oral GC4702 48 hour single dose IV GC4419 administer 60 minute , dose ( lipid suspension formulation ) GC4702 one week later . Subjects Cohorts 4 receive single dose ( lipid suspension formulation ) oral GC4702 48 hour single dose IV GC4419 administer 60 minute . The first 8 Subjects Cohort 4 dose require GTO-001 Protocol Amendment 1 . Upon approval GTO-001 Protocol Amendment 2 , first 8 previously dose Subjects ( fasted water ) consider dose arm 4a analysis , subsequent cohorts become eligible expansion study dose condition . Cohort 4 receive single dose IV GC4419 Day 1 administer 60 minute , follow single dose ( lipid suspension formulation ) oral GC4702 48 hour IV dosing , vary distinct GC4702 dosing condition per dose level . At discretion Medical Monitor upon agreement Principal Investigator base available data , 4 arm may evaluate , GC4702 dose fix within cohort , oral intake condition modify describe : 1. 240 mL ( 8 fluid ounce ) tap water 2. 240 mL ( 8 fluid ounce ) tap water follow high calorie/high fat meal . Subjects assign fed condition receive standard meal per U.S. FDA guideline consist high calorie/high fat meal prior dose consist total calorie 800-1000 150 , 250 500-600 calorie protein , carbohydrate fat , respectively . For fed condition , GC4702 administer follow overnight fast least 10 hour . Subjects start standard meal 30 minute prior administration GC4702 , instruct eat meal 30 minute less ; however , GC4702 administer 30 minute start meal , 240 mL ( 8 fluid ounce ) water . No food allow least 4 hour post-dose . Water allow desire except one hour GC4702 administration . Subjects receive standardize meal scheduled time period study . 3. 240 mL ( 8 fluid ounce ) orange juice 4. 240 mL ( 8 fluid ounce ) tap water , immediately follow single unit adult dose over-the-counter antacid RennieÂ® Subjects assign available arm ( i.e. , arm may test every cohort ) , dose arm may evaluate concurrently , sequence , consideration determine Medical Monitor Principal Investigator warrant available data resource . Two form oral GC4702 drug product test ; formulation enteric-coated Capsugel Vcap Plus hard gel capsule contain ( 1 ) dry powder formulation ( 2 ) lipid suspension formulation . It anticipate total 6-7 dose cohort test , include first two dose cohort receive single oral dose escalate dos encapsulate dry powder GC4702 formulation , third cohort receive single oral dose oral GC4702 formulation sequentially single IV dose GC4419 , 3-4 subsequent cohort receive single oral dose escalate dos oral encapsulate lipid suspension GC4702 formulation single IV dose GC4419 . Depending safety PK result , additional cohort may add either drug product preparation . See overview study design . The first two cohort subject receive encapsulate dry powder formulation , assess acute safety oral absorption GC4702 . Six subject enrol first two cohort , randomize 4:2 active GC4702 match placebo . After two cohort , safety data review internal Galera Therapeutics , Inc. ( Galera ) study team proceed next cohort . The third cohort subject receive oral formulation GC4702 , sequentially , initial single dose IV GC4419 , permit intra-subject assessment bioavailability formulation GC4702 . Pending initial safety PK result cohort , subsequent single dose escalation anticipate serial cohort receive encapsulate lipid suspension formulation GC4702 single dose , initial single dose IV GC4419 . For cohort 3 4 ( Amendment 1 ) , 8 subject per cohort enrol , randomize 6:2 active GC4702 match placebo . For expansion Cohort 4 ( Amendment 2 ) , 5 , 8 subject per dose arm enrol , randomize 6:2 active match placebo . Assignment Subjects open dose arm discretion investigational site , considers Subject availability , number dosing arm test ( 1 - 4 arm per cohort ) , sequence arm evaluate cohort . Subject crossover arm prohibit time , GC4702 administer . All subject enrol cohort first receive IV GC4419 . After cohort , safety PK data review internal Galera study team proceed next cohort . Depending inter-subject variability oral bioavailability , additional subject may add one dose cohort . Sentinel cohorts enrol Cohorts 1 3 observe 24 hour dose GC4702 , safety data review treat investigator , additional subject receive schedule dose GC4702 relevant cohort . Subjects single-ascending dose portion study also undergo electrocardiogram ( ECG ) monitoring select PK time point , include estimate Tmax , ( anticipate 2-4 hour dose GC4702 ) , assess relationship drug exposure GC4419/GC4702 effect QT interval . Part 2 : After completion single-ascending dose portion study , separate cohort subject receive single dose GC4702 ( dose high previously find acceptable safety profile ) , one oral drug product , fast fed condition , follow , 7-day washout period , second single dose oral GC4702 , dose , opposite condition ( fed fasting ) . In food effect cohort , subject randomly assign 1:1 fed-fasted sequence ( i.e. , either fed-first fasted-first ) . For fed condition , subject receive standard meal . There placebo dose IV GC4419 dose food effect cohort</detailed_description>
