	<detailed_description>Background rationale trial Etiological concept cancer development , malignant growth tumor propagation lead discovery various molecular driver mechanism . Based advance , medical oncology start enter era individualized medicine treatment selection become tailor drug-able molecular pathway . This individualized treatment concept mainly base molecular genetic characterization tumor include biomarker technology , allow u align appropriate treatment accord patient 's disease . Although general acceptance towards individualize approach thereby stratify subgrouping patient improve quality clinical care oncology , molecular profiling start assist prediction drug 's clinical benefit identify responsive patient subgroup . Recently , excellent demonstration utility prognostic and/or predictive biomarkers emerge . Von Hoff co-worker recently demonstrate molecular profiling patient ' tumor efficient approach identify potential target select treatment treatment-refractory cancer ( Von Hoff , Stephenson et al . 2010 ) . Such tailored treatment strategy reveal effective approach increase progression free survival ( PFS ) , compare patient ' recent standard treatment regimen . Another example individualize treatment patient give recently publish BATTLE trial ( Biomarker-integrated Approaches Targeted Therapy Lung Cancer Elimination ) , prospective biomarker biopsy driven trial pretreated non-small cell lung cancer ( NSCLC ) patient ( Kim , Herbst et al . 2011 ) . By Bayesian approach , author demonstrate target individually analyze molecule patient 's tumor might represent efficient therapeutic approach treatment incurable disease . While example suggest benefit individual tumor characterization selection tailor treatment concept , currently novel targeted agent treatment cancer rather approve certain subtype cancer , patient base expression activity respective target lesion . Therefore , need extension clinical protocol focus molecular profile-based treatment decision , rather anatomic cancer-subtypes mandatory . Based concept current protocol design . The investigator hypothesize molecular profiling patient 's tumor might predict treatment response , also lead individualized treatment protocol result clinical benefit individual patient . Therefore , project aim assess feasibility individualize treatment concept pre-defined patient 's benefit . Design , methodology , statistical consideration organization The Medical University Vienna clinical sponsor clinical center investigator-initiated open-label single center single-arm , exploratory phase II study . The individualized treatment concept determine biopsy-mandated biomarker-based . Bio-data analysis support software , generate Center Medical Statistics , Informatics Intelligent Systems . Study design methodology Patients relapsed/ refractory acute leukemia relapsed/ refractory aggressive lymphoma harbor activate genetic alteration ( gene mutation , gene fusion ) drug-able biomarker / activate signal transduction pathway resistant approve treatment modality eligible study . The investigator aim combine DNA sequencing-based molecular profiling ex vivo high-throughput drug screen strategy . For latter method , viable cell obtain individual patient 's lymphoma leukemia order determine ) expression relevant therapeutic target molecule ii ) ex vivo response patient 's cancer cell panel agent anticancer activity . In addition , analysis tumor stroma cell provide information differential target expression cellular sensitivity aim evaluation therapeutic safety window . Thereby , biological material access within 4 week onset individualized treatment ( real-time biopsy ) . Bioinformatic data-management base Bayesian statistical approach support individualize treatment decision control clinical approach . Number patient . A sample size 49 patient achieve ≥ 80 % power detect difference 15 % null hypothesis proportion P0 ( PFS ratio ≥ 1.3 ) = 10 % alternative proportion P1 ( PFS ratio ≥ 1.3 ) = 25 % use one-sided exact binomial test significance level 0.0250 . The null hypothesis reject , least 10 50 patient treat show PFS ratio ≥ 1.3 . The investigator therefore aim enroll 49 leukemia patient 49 lymphoma patient . Target population . Patients relapsed/ refractory acute leukemia relapsed/ refractory aggressive lymphoma standard treatment . Standard treatment define accord actual National Comprehensive Cancer Network ( NCCN ) ( http : //www.nccn.org/professionals/physician_gls/f_guidelines.asp ) and/or local guideline . 49 acute leukemia subject 49 lymphoma subject screen enrolment trial . Deviations inclusion criterion allow potentially jeopardize scientific integrity study , regulatory acceptability subject safety . Therefore , adherence criterion specify protocol essential . Inclusion criterion well exclusion criterion must respect .</detailed_description>
