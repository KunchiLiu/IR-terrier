	<brief_title>Comparison Hepatic Directed Vesicle ( HDV ) -Insulin Lispro Versus Insulin Lispro Further Improve Glycemic Control</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This double blind , active comparator control multiple dose safety , tolerability efficacy study compare HDV insulin lispro insulin lispro 40 Type 1 Diabetes Mellitus Subjects Good Glycemic Control , specific focus time range ( 70-180 mg/dL ) . Subjects screen monitor one week baseline CGM . They randomize one two treatment group : ( A ) six week treatment HDV-lispro ( B ) six week treatment insulin lispro dilute sterile water alone . All subject use insulin glargine insulin degludec basal insulin coverage throughout trial . Fasting glucose goal 70-120 mg/dL , recommendation dosage adjustment make twice weekly accord simple dose algorithm base mean fast glucose value previous 3-4 day . Subjects receive standard diabetes education refresher train begin trial , include review insulin dose administration titration , carbohydrate counting ( dietary planning deem appropriate investigator ) , avoidance hypoglycemia , management exercise stress . Post meal ( 60-90 min start meal ) goal &lt; 140 mg/dL . A test meal study ( standardize liquid test meal ) conduct begin treatment ( baseline study ) end six week treatment period ( treatment comparison study ) . Subjects also perform blind continuous glucose monitor 4 week study ( i.e week 1,3,5 7 study ) Throughout study , subject ask perform frequent self-monitoring blood glucose ( SMBG ) , least 6 time per day ( 60-90 minute meal ) 3 day week . This serve data therapeutic decision-making well data collection .</detailed_description>
