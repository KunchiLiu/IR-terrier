	<detailed_description>Clopidogrel widely use P2Y12 receptor inhibitor agent class currently recommend patient stable coronary artery disease ( CAD ) undergo PCI , treatment stroke PAD . Although efficacy DAPT aspirin clopidogrel consistently show different clinical setting , rate ischemic recurrence remain elevated despite treatment regimen , especially high risk patient . This part attribute high interindividual variability response clopidogrel . Pharmacodynamic ( PD ) study show approximately 30-40 % patient experience high on-treatment platelet reactivity ( HPR ) receive clopidogrel treatment . Importantly HPR status strongly associate increase risk ischemic event , particular stent thrombosis , patient ACS follow PCI . This underscore need strategy aim reduce HPR rate patient treat clopidogrel . Multiple approach advocate reduce HPR rate . The pleiotropic effect associate lipid lower therapy , particular statin , subject extensive research . In previous study treatment high-dose atorvastatin addition double-dose clopidogrel reduce platelet reactivity significantly double-dose clopidogrel alone statin-naïve patient stable CAD HPR . To date , exact biological mechanism involve statin modulation platelet function fully understood , although likely attribute lipid-lowering non-lipid-related effect . Evolocumab monoclonal antibody target proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9 ( PCSK9 ) administer subcutaneously ( s.c. ) dosage 140 mg every 2 week 420 mg monthly . In clinical trial evolocumab effective placebo and/or ezetimibe reduce LDL cholesterol , include add statin therapy . The use evolocumab plus standard therapy , compare standard therapy alone , significantly reduce incidence cardiovascular event . Whether reduction cardiovascular event simply due LDL reduction might relate mechanism currently subject investigation . Although LDL reduction statin therapy associate reduction platelet reactivity , date effect platelet aggregation adjunctive lipid lower evolocumab explore . The aim present study investigate effect evolocumab addition statin therapy HPR rate platelet reactivity patient atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease ( ASCVD ) HPR clopidogrel treatment .</detailed_description>
