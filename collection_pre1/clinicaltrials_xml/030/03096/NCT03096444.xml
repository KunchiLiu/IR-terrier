	<brief_summary>The purpose study examine antipruritic efficacy topical ketamine , amitriptyline , lidocaine , tri-combination ketamine , amitriptyline lidocaine ( hereafter refer `` KeAmLi '' ) use non-histaminergic itch provocation healthy volunteer . The primary outcome itch reduction ( AUC ) vehicle active treatment ( KeAmLi-combo ) . Secondary outcome include modality-specific analgesic property topically apply ketamine , amitriptyline , lidocaine , KeAmLi-combo control quantitative thermal mechanical stimulus , improve understand mechanism action substance context topical therapy .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Antipruritic Effect Topical Ketamine , Amitriptyline , Lidocaine</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This double-blind , vehicle-controlled study evaluate antipruritic efficacy topical ketamine , amitriptyline , lidocaine , tri-combination ketamine , amitriptyline lidocaine ( hereafter refer `` KeAmLi '' ) use non-histaminergic itch provocation healthy volunteer . Each participant pre-treated vehicle 4 active topical cream , two study visit ( 3 treatment 1st visit 2 treatment 2nd visit ) . Each treatment apply randomized forearm test area 30 minute , sensory testing perform . Sensory test include thermal mechanical stimulus , itch induction use plant cowhage . These test reveal mechanistic information potential cellular molecular target improve antipruritic analgesic therapy .</detailed_description>
