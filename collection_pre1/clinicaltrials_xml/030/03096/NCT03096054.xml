	<detailed_description>This clinical study look drug call LY3143921 hydrate ( Cdc7 inhibitor ) . Cdc7 help cell replicate correctly . In normal cell , Cdc7 usually find low level , reach high level cancer cell . This often case certain type solid tumour cancer , focus study . It think give LY3143921 hydrate block function Cdc7 affect cancer cell stop replication cause die . LY3143921 hydrate look promise laboratory study study animal . This clinical study two part : Part 1 - 'dose escalation ' phase group patient receive increase dos LY3143921 hydrate find safe dose dose best target cancer cell . Part 2 - 'expansion ' phase large group patient receive high dose LY3143921 hydrate consider safe Part 1 , find drug working .</detailed_description>
