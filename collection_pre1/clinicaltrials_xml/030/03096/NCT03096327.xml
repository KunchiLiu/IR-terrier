	<detailed_description>1.1 Background Asthma characterize airway lung tissue inflammation airway hyperresponsiveness ( AHR ) lead recurrent symptom wheeze , breathlessness , chest tightness , cough . AHR indicate exaggerated response airway nonspecific stimulus , result temporary airflow limitation , lead airway obstruction . It remain unknown factor within airway individual trigger reversible airway obstruction airway narrow . The airway epithelium compose many interacting structural component inflammatory cell . The number , activation , secretory component inflammatory cell airway alter disease . In asthma , number eosinophil T lymphocyte increase subepithelial layer . The impact asthma traditionally measure term prevalence disease , mortality rate , level healthcare utilisation , particularly hospital admission . However , impact asthma extend beyond outcome include effect lifestyle , wellbeing , perceive health status . Adults work age asthma poor health status quality life outcomes asthma . This effect independent confounding sociodemographic life style factor evident across range dimension quality life . In comparison two chronic health condition , asthma large adverse impact health status quality life diabetes . 1.2 . Investigational Agent Montelukast reversibly inhibit cysteinyl leukotrienes ( CysLTs ) , specifically leukotrienes D4 ( LTD4 [ 3 ] . LTD4 potent bronchoconstricting agent molar basis , Cys-LTs also chemoattractive property many inflammatory cell ( mainly eosinophils ) , effect vascular permeability , mucous secretion sensory nerve activation , responsible part pathophysiology asthma . 1.3 . Dose Rational/Risk &amp; Benefit Montelukast potent selective blocker CysLT1 receptor . For treatment chronic asthma , montelukast administer daily adult 10-mg film-coated tablet , child age 6-14 year 5-mg chewable tablet , child age 2-5 year 4-mg chewable tablet form . Given efficacy , antiinflammatory activity , oral administration , safety , leukotriene modifier play important role treatment asthmatic patient . Side effect commonly report placebo include headache , otitis medium , upper respiratory infection , pharyngitis .</detailed_description>
