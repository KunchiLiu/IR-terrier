	<detailed_description>Common mental disorder ( CMD ) Depression , contribute significantly global burden disease . Fetal exposure adverse intrauterine environment mediate life course factor enhance risk non-communicable disease later life . Maternal micronutrient Vitamin B12 folate play important role early fetal development effect one carbon metabolism . Vitamin B12 deficiency common Indian woman ; however guideline recommend iron , folic acid supplementation pregnancy . This study aim investigate effect maternal B12 , folate pregnancy mental health neurocognitive outcome offspring adulthood . The Pune Maternal Nutrition Study ( PMNS ) birth-cohort ( n=762 ) establish 1993 Diabetes Unit KEM Hospital Pune well characterize serial data archive biological sample . The subject cohort age range 20-22 year provide opportunity examine propose objective . Primary objective : To examine specific association maternal vitaminB12 , folate , homocysteine level ( independently interaction ) 18 &amp; 28 week gestation neurocognitive outcome risk CMD around 21 year age , control effect nutrient ( calorie , protein fat intake , level vitamin C , D , ferritin ) . Hypothesis : That low maternal vitamin B12-higher folate , high homocysteine level 18 28 week gestation associate lower cognitive functioning score neuropsychological test high prevalence CMD men woman age 20-22 yr . This nutrient pattern ( lowB12 , high folate , high homocysteine ) mother associate : 1 . Lower cortical thickness , small total brain , hippocampal volume alter hippocampal-dorsolateral prefrontal cortex functional connectivity . 2 . Disturbed temperament character dimension internalize externalize spectrum . In addition mediate modifying effect life course factor like childhood growth nutrition , education , socioeconomic status , early life stress , lifestyle risk CMD examine . Secondary objective : 1 . To test causality association maternal VitaminB12 , folate , homocysteine neurocognitive outcome Mendelian Randomization analysis ( triangulation instrumental variable analysis ) use maternal genetic determinant vitaminB12 ( TCN2rs1801198 , FUT2rs492602 ) homocysteine ( MTHFRrs1801133 ) . 2 . To assess whether association mediate level biomarkers neurodevelopment ( serum Brain Derived neurotrophic factor BDNF , Insulin like growth factor IGF-1 level ) measure 6,12 &amp; 18 year age cohort . 3 . To examine whether late life nutritional supplementation ( Vitamin B12 without multiple micronutrient placebo ) modulate effect maternal B12 status neurocognitive outcome young adulthood . Methods Study design Subjects longitudinal prospective cohort PMNS ( n=690 ) recruit cross sectional assessment . The time required assessment approximately 2-3 hour ( exclude neuroimaging ) . Female member cohort currently pregnant time assessment would exclude neuroimaging , however would screen CMD . Procedures : The cohort participant approach field worker follow last many year . Subjects provide study information sheet opportunity discuss doubt concern regard study investigator . Subjects give informed consent recruit . Research staff ( one psychiatrist one clinical psychologist ) train monitored administration assessment tool inter-rater reliability periodically examine . The subject examine Diabetes unit KEM Hospital follow assessment ' perform . 1 . General socio-demographics structure interview : Semi structure proforma use record current demographic detail , socio-economic status ( assessed Standard Living Index provide information occupation , residential living arrangement , educational status , possession ) , Life style risk factor ( Physical activity , stress - Cohen 's perceived stress scale , substance use , high risk behavior , early life stress - World health organisation Adverse Childhood Experiences International Questionnaire ) . Family history mental illness assess Family interview genetic study . 2 . Physical examination A general physical examination would perform ass , height , weight , Body mass index BMI , sign nutrient deficiency , rest pulse rate blood pressure . 3 . Neurocognitive assessment A Standardized battery neuropsychological test administer assess domain executive function , work memory , intelligence , verbal memory . The test take 60 minute administer 1 . Raven 's standard progressive matrix ( SPM ) : This measure intelligence use adult . Test contain 60 item 5 set contain 12 item . Number correct response record . Test produce single raw score percentile rank 2 . Color trail test : This test executive function . It involve 2 part A &amp; B subject connect numbered circle 1 25 follow connecting numbered circle alternate color ( yellow pink ) . Time complete task number error record . Longer time indicate poor performance . 3 . Digit span test : This test work memory . Increasing sequence digit present subject recall forward backwards . The long sequence word correctly repeat record . 4 . Block design : This test visuo-spatial ability . Task replicate design show card use red white block . Time take complete test record . Longer time indicate poor performance . 5 . Word recall : WHO/University California Los Angeles ( UCLA ) version Rey 's auditory verbal learning test measure verbal learn memory . Test involve immediate delay recall list A 15 noun interference present list B . Words use translate local language . Number word correctly recall , record . 4 . Psychological assessment : Temperament Character Dimensions : This would assess short Temperament Character inventory - R. This 140 item self-report questionnaire yield score 4 temperament dimension ( Harm avoidance , reward dependence , novelty seek , persistence ) 3 character dimension ( self-directedness , cooperativeness self-transcendence ) . 5 . Mental Health assessment -diagnostic All subject assess structured clinical interview ( Mini Neuropsychiatric interview plus ( MINI ) 6.0 ; yield syndromal psychiatric diagnosis base Diagnostic statistical manual ( DSM ) 5 . CMD interest assess would depression anxiety disorder . All subject meet criterion MINI reassess comprehensive clinical mental status examination 2 qualified psychiatrist confirm diagnosis . Any subject find syndromal psychiatric diagnosis would offer treatment per standard clinical protocol . 6 . Magnetic resonance image MRI brain structural sequence rest state fMRI would perform 3Tesla MRI scanner . The MRI scan would perform subset cohort select base maternal vitaminB12 level use nested case control study design . 146 member maternal vitaminB12 level 18 week &lt; 103pmol/l . Age gender match Control group would select remain member cohort whose maternal vitaminB12 level &gt; 175pmol/l ( n=175 ) . Accounting attrition estimate number 200 subject ( 100 group ) scan . The following MR sequence would perform - Structural 3D T1 weight MPRAGE ( magnetization prepare rapid gradient echo ) , fMRI 2D gradient-echo EPI sequence . 7 . Lab assessment : Assessments serum BDNF , IGF-1 perform archived serum sample cohort subject collect 6,12,18 year age use commercially available ELISA kit . The analysis perform lab Diabetes Unit , KEM Hospital participates United Kingdom National External Quality Assessment Service ( UKNEQAS ) . Power estimation &amp; Statistical analysis : There 690 member cohort available assessment . Assuming 90 % participation rate ( experience previous study cohort ) estimate 621 subject would recruit study . Using test 5 % significance level , study 80 % power detect association 0.11 standard deviation continuous outcome ( eg . neurocognitive test score ) per standard deviation continuous exposure ( eg . maternal vitaminB12 level ) Data pre-pregnancy maternal size ( height , skin fold thickness , head circumference ) nutrition status pregnancy ( nutrition intake , circulate micronutrient , physical activity ) newborn size ( birth weight , length , head circumference ) childhood nutrition , growth development ( BMI , body fat measurement , skin fold thickness ) cardiometabolic risk factor ( insulin resistance , glycemic status , adiposity ) assess previously cohort available extract . Regression modeling technique would primarily use test propose hypothesis . More specifically , neuro-cognitive outcome would model function exposure ( ) adjust effect mediator confound variable keep consideration feature data ( non-linearity , multivariate response etc. ) . A similar technique would adopt assess form strength relationship Magnetic Resonance Imaging outcomes outcomes CMD exposure ( ) respectively . Appropriate use linear model generalize linear model would make base nature outcome . The effect size along confidence interval appropriate diagram visualize effects/relationships would perform . Open Clinica software would use database design data entry entire data cleaning analysis visualization would do use R statistical software . Mendelian randomization analysis ( triangulation instrumental variable analysis ) use maternal genetic determinant vitamin B12 ( TCN2 , FUT2 ) homocysteine ( MTHFR ) gene perform examine causal role vitaminB12 one carbon metabolism neurocognitive outcome . Genetic analysis vitaminB12 ( TCN2rs1801198 , FUT2rs492602 ) homocysteine ( MTHFRrs1801133 ) gene perform 526 mother child cohort available .</detailed_description>
