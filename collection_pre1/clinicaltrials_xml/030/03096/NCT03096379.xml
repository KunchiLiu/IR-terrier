	<brief_title>MRI Differentiating Gut TB Crohn 's</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The clinical presentation gut tuberculosis Crohn 's disease similar . In area endemic tuberculosis infection , differentiate two disease remain difficult . Both disease entity similar clinical , endoscopic histological finding . Yet , wrongly diagnose gut tuberculosis Crohn 's disease potentially result disastrous outcome , especially anti-tumor necrosis factor therapy , important therapeutic option Crohn 's disease , result fulminant reactivation tuberculosis . Magnetic resonance enterography ( MRE ) emerge effective image modality evaluate disease status Crohn 's disease . MRE , unlike compute tomography , emit radiation , suitable repeat serial image younger-age population . Ulcerations , stricture , transmural enhancement mesenteric comb small bowel clearly demonstrate via MRE Crohn 's disease . Yet , utilization MRE diagnose gut tuberculosis remain largely unexplored . Whether MRE use differentiate gut tuberculosis Crohn 's disease remain unknown . The investigator plan consecutively recruit 150 patient present hospital Shenzhen , China , new onset lower gastrointestinal symptom ileocecal mucosal lesion uncertain diagnosis evidence presence inflammation , ulceration , strictures nodule colonoscopy.All recruit participant undergo MRE , perform 1.5 Tesla scanner ( Magnetom Avanto , Siemens Healthcare , Erlangen , Germany ) . MRE finding independently interpret two radiologist special expertise abdominal MR imaging blind patient ' clinical data . The relationship radiological pattern clinical , endoscopic histological finding analyze . The role MRE distinguish gut tuberculosis Crohn 's disease determine .</detailed_description>
