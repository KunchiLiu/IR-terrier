	<brief_summary>A randomized clinical trial investigate use temporary Diaphragm Pacing Therapy System ( DPTS ) rehabilitate diaphragm mechanically ventilated patient fail least two wean attempt . The goal strengthen rehabilitate diaphragm liberate patient quickly mechanical ventilation .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Percutaneous Temporary Placement Phrenic Nerve Stimulator Diaphragm Pacing</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Mechanical ventilation ( MV ) life save technology also cause damage lung diaphragm ventricular induce diaphragmatic dysfunction ( VIDD ) . Research show mandatory MV sedate diaphragm begin atrophy within short 18 hour . The Lungpacer Diaphragm Pacing Therapy System ( DPTS ) temporary therapy consist Lungpacer IntraVenous Electrode Catheter ( LIVE Catheter ) Lungpacer Control Unit system . The LIVE Catheter proprietary central venous catheter incorporate pace electrode strategic area align leave right phrenic nerve . The LIVE Catheter also use fluid delivery like central venous catheter . The randomized clinical trial investigate safety , effectiveness performance Lungpacer DPTS . By stimulate diaphragm daily therapy session , intention exercise rehabilitate diaphragm muscle patient may able quickly liberate MV . The patient population include mechanically ventilate great equal 7 day , fail two spontaneous breathe trial ( SBT ) , hypervolemic late spontaneous breathe trial . Patients must resolution initial indication placement mechanical ventilation enter trial .</detailed_description>
	<criteria>18 year age old mechanically ventilate &gt; = 7 day meet criterion successful weaning period , fail least two SBTs , one study specific SBT ( self extubation subsequent reintubation within 48 hour consider fail SBT ) . currently extracorporeal membrane oxygenation ( ECMO ) ; wean failure due hypervolemia ; know anatomy prevents insertion LIVE Catheter leave subclavian vein ; history congenital heart disease ; clinically overt congestive heart failure ; preexist neuromuscular disease could affect respiratory muscle ; pleural effusion occupy great one third pleural space either side ; BMI &gt; = 40 ; know suspect phrenic nerve paralysis ; electrical device ( implanted external ) may prone interaction interference Lungpacer DPTS include neurological pacing/stimulator device , cardiac pacemaker defibrillator ; bacteremia ( blood culture must negative 48 hour ) ; current haemodynamic instability , shock severe sepsis ; terminally ill 6 month less life expectancy commit full care ; know suspect pregnant lactating ; actively participate another clinical study</criteria>
