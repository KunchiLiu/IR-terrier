	<brief_summary>Objectives To investigate impact tele-supervised prehabilitation functional capacity colon cancer patient undergoing colorectal resection cancer evaluate effect prehabilitation muscle strength endurance , quality life ( QoL ) , executive function , fatigue inflammatory metabolic parameter . Methods A randomize control trial conduct . Patients randomise either prehabilitation group control group . The prehabilitation group receive tele-supervised prehabilitation 4weeks telerehabilitation 8weeks post-surgery control group begin telerehabilitation surgery 8weeks . Patients care enhance recovery pathway . Telerehabilitation pre post-surgery consist three moderate-intensity aerobic resistance session per week . Subjects assess baseline , pre-intervention , post-intervention post-rehabilitation . The primary outcome functional capacity measure use 6-min walk test . The secondary outcome : physical measurement , quality life , level physical activity , executive function , fatigue , body composition , blood test , energy expenditure .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Study objectives Primary objective : The investigator want assess tele-supervised prehabilitation improve preoperative cardio-respiratory fitness colon cancer patient set enhanced recovery pathway . Secondary objective - The investigator want examine tele-supervised prehabilitation beneficial effect muscle strength endurance , quality life , executive function , fatigue , inflammatory parameter metabolic disruption pre-surgery . - The investigator want determine whether change preoperative period remain postoperative period 8 week telerehabilitation . Rationale scientific background : In Belgium , colon cancer third common cancer men second common woman second cause cancer death . Surgery currently primary treatment stage I III . This surgery benefit several year multimodal program , commonly call `` Fast Track '' program enhance recovery . Nowadays , lack preoperative fitness specifically take account Fast Track program . Nevertheless , study show patient poor preoperative physical fitness less able cope adverse effect surgery hospitalization result increase risk mortality , postoperative complication functional recovery time . It seem relevant intervene preoperative period improve patient 's functional capacity surgery , via physical training overcome stress surgery improve postoperative recovery . This process call `` prehabilitation '' Structured supervise program show effective feasible . However , time , resource , expensive care often barrier patient . Thereby , home-based tele-supervising rehabilitation would attractive therapeutic option offer distinct advantage regard . More specifically , `` telerehabilitation define application telecommunication , remote sense operation technology , compute technology assist provision medical rehabilitation service distance '' . Study design A single-blind , randomize , control trial conduct . Participants randomize either prehabilitation group rehabilitation group . Participants group care Fast Track Program . An assessor blind group allocation collect outcomes measure participant . To eligible study participant need meet follow criterion : Diagnosis colon cancer require surgery ; 50 year age ; autonomous voluntary person ; able read , write understand French ; Participants exclude participant physical impairment would seriously impair physical mobility ; unfavorable familial context ; stoma ; American Society Anesthesiologists score IV-V ; surgery emergency ; neuropsychiatric disease . Participants allocate prehabilitation group undertake telerehabilitation program start 4 week surgery continue 8 week surgery . Participants control group receive World Health Organization recommendation physical activity health surgery . After surgery , The control group undertake telerehabilitation program 8-week period . The telerehabilitation program combine aerobic resistance training three session per week . Each 60-min session begin end five-minute warm-up/cool . The warm-up follow 25 minute aerobic training . Aerobic exercise include brisk walking , jogging , cycling , swim accord patient 's preference . The intensity exercise set 60 à 75 % maximum heart rate ( maximal heart rate=220 - age ) . And 12 16 Borg 's Rating Perceived Exertion Scale . Each participant wear heart monitor . The aerobic training follow resistance exercise perform eight exercise target major muscle group ( abdominal , hamstring , quadriceps , triceps , gluteus maximus , paraspinal muscle shoulder muscle ) . Intensity must 12 16 Borg 's Rating Perceived Exertion Scale . A physiotherapist provide detailed information program . The patient receive brochure description picture exercise video include resistance program record website . The researcher conduct weekly telephone call participant . The aim call solve problem carry training session discuss possible adverse event . Moreover , researcher give message support encouragement improve adherence program . Outcome measure assess four time point : baseline ( T0 ) , one day schedule date surgery ( T1 ) , one week intervention ( T2 ) end postoperative rehabilitation ( T3 ) . Primary outcome cardiorespiratory fitness 6min walk test ) . Secondary outcome muscle strength endurance ( isokinetic dynamometer 1min sit-to-stand-test ) , quality life ( `` Euroquol-5D-3L '' questionnaire ) ; level physical activity ( International Physical Activity Questionnaire Short Form ) ; fatigue ( Functional Assessment Cancer Therapy : Fatigue ) ; executive function ( Trail Making test , Stroop test fluency ) ; blood test ( neutrophil lymphocyte ratio , C reactive protein , fast glucose , fast insulin cholesterol measure bioelectrical impedance analysis ) ; energy expenditure ( `` Sensewear® '' armband ) .</detailed_description>
