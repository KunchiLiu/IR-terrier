	<brief_summary>This study investigate cold-induced brown fat activation assess use PET/MR scan . Subjects participate acute cool intervention day thermoneutral intervention day PET/MR scan day . A secondary purpose make validation infrared thermography camera comparison skin temperature SUV supraclavicular brown adipose tissue .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Cold Induced Activation Brown Adipose Tissue Humans</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The field human brown adipose tissue ( BAT ) research focus activation BAT mean manipulate energy expenditure potentially anti-obesity anti-diabetic property tissue . This well establish rodent study explain due specific brown fat uncouple protein 1 ( UCP1 ) . Despite increase evidence indicate metabolic regulatory role BAT human , BAT activation/recruitment fully understand even less known endocrine capacity human BAT . Cold induce brown fat activity assess PET/MR scan validate infra-red thermography camera , well perform proteomic screen use blood sample two intervention day . 15 healthy lean male subject serve control cross-over randomize control study , include pre-examination day , thermoneutral-day cool test-day cold exposure follow PET/MR scan determine BAT activity . An extra cooling day apply external validation infrared thermography camera . Blood sample abdominal fat-biopsies take thermoneutral condition cold stimulation brown fat .</detailed_description>
