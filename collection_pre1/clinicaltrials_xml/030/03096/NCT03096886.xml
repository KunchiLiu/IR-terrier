	<brief_summary>We recruit total 100 participant : 60 MDD Outpatient Clinics University Pennsylvania 40 match comparison participant . MDD participant receive computer-augmented skill train GDA protocol . Half MDD participant initially randomize Depression Care Management ( DCM ) ( supportive management `` placebo '' comparator CCBT ) subsequently receive CCBT treatment . All participant receive fMRI scan baseline follow either 8 week CCBT 8 week DCM . Brain activity compare MDD control baseline CCBT-treated v DCM-treated 8 week . At conclusion 8 week DCM-treated participant receive 8-week course CCBT 3rd fMRI scan conclusion CCBT , allow within-subject comparison CCBT v DCM treatment effect .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>This study randomize study . 60 subject MDD randomly assign ( 1:1 ) immediately receive 8 week CCBT delay treatment , consist initial 8 week Depression Care Management ( DCM ) , follow 8 week CCBT . 40 healthy control similar age/sex recruit serve comparison group baseline MRI scanning . The study enroll subject approximately 4 year ( ~2 subject per month 48 month ) . The length subject participation vary base group participant randomize . Healthy control participate approximately 1-3 week . Subjects MDD randomize immediate CCBT participate approximately 8-10 week ; subject MDD randomize delay CCBT ( DCM ) participate approximately 16-19 week . Variability study duration group depend subject ' personal availability visit availability MR . Potential participant complete phone screen determine eligibility . If individual eligible , schedule in-person screen visit . Information collect phone screening use data analysis ; phone screen information collect retained REDCap . Screening Visit - participant study describe detail , include risk study procedure outline informed consent form sign ICF HIPAA authorization , prior study procedure complete . Participants screen symptom psychological disorder severity major depressive symptom train research team member . If determine eligible , HEALTHY CONTROLS schedule return complete fMRI scan baseline visit , self-report measure , include report mood , behavior , thought collect , well neuropsychological testing . If determine eligible screening , MDD ( EXPERIMENTAL GROUP ) participant randomize ( 1:1 ) follow : One half depress participant randomize receive 8 week CCBT immediately complete pretreatment assessment remainder randomize 8 week Depression Care Management ( DCM ) . Following DCM receive 8 week CCBT . MDD , IMMEDIATE CCBT GROUP CCBT participant schedule return complete fMRI scan baseline visit , self-report measure , include report mood , behavior , thought collect , well neuropsychological test . Participants complete Good Days Ahead ( GDA ) computer train throughout 8 week CCBT . They CBT Clinical Contact license psychologist/psychiatrist multiple time point period , well . Additionally , outcome measure assess independent clinical evaluator ( without knowledge treatment assignment ) every week . As soon arrange Week 8 study visit ( last CCBT Clinical Contact ) , participant return complete fMRI scan end study visit , self-report measure , include report mood , behavior , thought collect , well neuropsychological test . MDD , DCM ( Followed CCBT ) Group DCM participant schedule return complete fMRI scan baseline visit , self-report measure , include report mood , behavior , thought collect , well neuropsychological test . During DCM phase , Participants meet clinical contact ( 30 minute session psychologist/psychiatrist ) outcome measure multiple time 8 week DCM phase . During Week 8 study visit , participant complete second fMRI scan end DCM visit , self-report measure , include report mood , behavior , thought collect , well neuropsychological test . Participants enter CCBT phase follow week complete Good Days Ahead ( GDA ) computer train throughout 8 week CCBT . They CBT Clinical Contact license psychologist/psychiatrist multiple time point period , well . Additionally , outcome measure assess independent clinical evaluator ( without knowledge treatment assignment ) every week study phase . As soon arrange Week 17 study visit ( last CCBT Clinical Contact ) , participant return complete 1-hour fMRI scan end study visit , self-report measure , include report mood , behavior , thought collect , well neuropsychological testing .</detailed_description>
