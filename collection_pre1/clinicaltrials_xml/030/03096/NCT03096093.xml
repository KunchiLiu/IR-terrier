	<brief_summary>This study evaluate four different dos ACIT-1 safety ability raise effective anti-cancer immune response patient pancreatic late stage cancer . Approximately half patient pancreatic cancer half late stage cancer .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Investigation Therapeutic Vaccine ( ACIT-1 ) Late Stage Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The immune system important role help prevent cancer destroy early cancer cell . When cancer develop antigen-specific immune ( T ) cell still present blood either respond effective . Vaccines stimulate T cell respond kill cancer cell . ACIT-1 designed stimulate tumour antigen-specific T cell respond kill cancer cell .</detailed_description>
