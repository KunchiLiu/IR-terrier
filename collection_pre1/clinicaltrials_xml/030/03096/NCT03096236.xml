	<brief_summary>Subepithelial gastric tumor rare usually detect incidentally . Most subepithelial tumor ( SET ) benign 13 % lesion malignant . Histology needle biopsy often bring clear diagnosis SET , strategy often remain unclear . Surveillance endoscopy associate risk progression . Endoscopic resection usually difficult , associate high risk complication sometimes feasible . Surgical resection also associate risk complication often refuse patient . With developement gFTRD-System gastric SET resect endoscopically . The advantage technique complete resection full-thickness resection specimen definite histology .</brief_summary>
