	<brief_summary>The Fractional Flow Reserve Fax Registry investigator-initiated , real-world registry analyze use fractional flow reserve ( FFR ) measurements clinical practice cardiac catheterization laboratory Germany . The registry aim collect data 2000 patient underwent FFR recording clinical reason . The main outcome parameter frequency coronary revascularization follow FFR . Secondary outcome parameter include distribution quantitative FFR result clinical practice , influence intracoronary versus intravenous adenosine distribution FFR result , rate complication result FFR measurement , average number FFR wire need per patient . Since study include large number patient undergo i.c . administration adenosine large number patient undergo i.v . administration adenosine , possible analyze whether route adenosine administration independent predictor FFR result .</brief_summary>
