	<brief_summary>This Pilot study evaluate use new device call Inflammacheck whether consistently measure hydrogen peroxide level exhale breath condensate . It also assess whether exhaled breath condensate hydrogen peroxide level measure Inflammacheck differentiate people asthma COPD healthy individual .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>EXhaled Hydrogen Peroxide As Marker Lung diseasE ( EXHALE ) Pilot Study .</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Hydrogen Peroxide level Exhaled Breath Condensate ( EBC ) direct biomarker oxidative stress airway epithelium . Levels show raise asthma Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease ( COPD ) stable exacerbate state . Previously difficult measure volatile compound away laboratory base setting . However new device develop measure Hydrogen peroxide level exhale breath patient side . This Pilot study test new device clinical setting . It ass whether device monitor level consistently reliably whether distinguish disease healthy individual .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Subject clinician make diagnosis asthma symptom ≥ 3 month support objective evidence airflow variability , reversibility airway hyperresponsiveness Subject confirm , clinician make diagnosis COPD ≥ 3 month support spirometric evidence fix airflow limitation ( postbronchodilator ratio FEV1/FVC &lt; 0.7 ) record time Subject know history lung disease ( define current clinical diagnosis , receive treatment , lung disease ) . Subject willing able give inform consent participation study . Subject exist comorbidities may prevent perform spirometry , FeNO study measurement ( discretion clinical investigator ) . Subject know lung , chest wall , neuromuscular , cardiac disease abnormality ( include endstage disease cancer ) would confound symptom score spirometry . Subject receive treatment exacerbation respiratory disease within last 2 week . In opinion clinical investigator , participant could put risk harm perform study procedure . Subject unable comprehend study provide inform consent , e.g . insufficient command English absence someone adequately interpret .</criteria>
