In response need , Phase I project Enhancing Care Aged Dying Prisons ( ECAD-P ) demonstrate ( 1 ) need interest product ECAD-P ( i.e. , correction administrator staff interested end-of-life ( EOL ) care train ) ; ( 2 ) training short , intensive , engage , interactive , contextually sensitive specific environment ; ( 3 ) interactive , media-rich prototype high acceptability usability could develop . The specification document commercialization plan indicate possible develop full-scale ECAD-P learning system Phase II market potential exists . The technological innovation propose ECAD-P project well-suited targeted market . Technical merit , feasibility , market potential ECAD-P Learning System demonstrate Phase I project . The purpose Phase II application continue research development ECAD-P learning system emphasis develop scalable unit commercialization test scale-up large number diverse context . More specifically , aim ECAD-P Phase II 1 ) Develop full scale media-rich interactive computer-based learning system consist six module address EOL geriatric care issue prison ; 2 ) Conduct in-person usability test full scale ECAD-P Learning System state federal prison evaluate user interface , ease use , perceive barrier order optimize scalable unit broad dissemination ; 3 ) Test scale-up full scale ECAD-P Learning System 12 federal ( n=6 ) state ( n=6 ) prison across nation evaluate outcome , usage pattern , commercialization opportunity . Continued research development permit refinement scalable unit commercialization . Expanded test learn system establish effectiveness learn system provide critical insight relevant dissemination commercial product .</detailed_description>
