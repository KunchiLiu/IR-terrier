	<brief_summary>This research study participant End Stage Renal Disease ( ESRD ) . ESRD last stage chronic kidney disease . Anemia common ESRD patient require erythropoiesis-stimulating agent ( ESAs ) treatment . Anemia happen enough red blood cell body . ESAs work help bone marrow produce red blood cell . There two ESAs license treatment anemia CKD Unites States : epoetin alfa darbopoetin alfa . ESA therapy consider safe . However , major adverse effect acknowledge , include increase risk death , thromboembolic complication , stroke , heart attack , aplastic anemia , tumor progression , others . To minimize risk adverse event , careful monitoring hemoglobin level , along adjustment ESA dosing , maintain low hemoglobin level clinically need recommend . Ferric Citrate , also call Auryxia , iron-based phosphate binder may decrease ESA usage maintain hemoglobin level . Phosphate binder medication use reduce body 's absorption phosphate . In prior study , see laboratory value , iron level , change positively response Auryxia . In study want see use Auryxia cause change laboratory value low use ESAs ESRD patient .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Iron deficiency anemia prevalent end stage renal disease ( ESRD ) patient . Patients ESRD require phosphate binder hyperphosphatemia erythropoiesis-stimulating agent ( ESAs ) intravenous ( IV ) iron anemia . In patient ESRD , iron deficiency occur frequently , increase external loss iron , decreased availability body 's storage iron , perhaps deficit intestinal iron absorption . ESRD patient tend lose 3 gram iron every year chronic bleeding , frequent phlebotomy blood trap dialysis apparatus . Total body iron store 20-25 mg mostly maintain recycle senescent red blood cell ( RBC ) count macrophages reticulo-endothelial system . In addition , true iron deficiency , many ESRD patient functional iron deficiency , characterize impaired iron release body store unable meet demand erythropoiesis ( also call reticuloendothelial cell iron blockade ) . These patient low serum transferrin saturation ( TSAT , measure circulate iron ) normal high serum ferritin ( marker body iron store ) . Dietary iron absorption usual circumstance account 1-2 mg/day almost equal daily iron loss intestinal skin cell shed . For treatment anemia cause chronic renal disease , United States Food Drug Administration ( FDA ) approve use ESA therapy . There two ESAs license treatment anemia CKD Unites States : epoetin alfa darbopoetin alfa . Both glycoprotein manufacture use recombinant DNA technology . They stimulate erythropoiesis mechanism action endogenous erythropoietin . The start dose epoetin 50 units/kg ( 3000-4000 units/dose ) twice week , darbepoetin start 0.45 mcg/kg administer every 2-4 week . To avoid impaired erythropoiesis cause true iron deficiency functional iron deficiency , iron store fully replenish ESA therapy . ESA therapy consider safe . However , major adverse effect acknowledge , include increase risk death , thromboembolic complication , stroke , heart attack , aplastic anemia , tumor progression , others . To minimize risk adverse event , careful monitoring hemoglobin level , along adjustment ESA dosing , maintain low hemoglobin level clinically need recommend . Given ESRD pro-inflammatory condition , substantial elevation serum ferritin common ESRD patient . The role iron replacement therapy ESRD patient high serum ferritin low transferrin saturation clear . In fact , anemia management protocol recommend stop iron replacement ferritin level great 1,200 ng/ml , even TSAT 20 % . The United States Renal Data System ( USRDS ) report 55 % prevalent ESRD patient ( 2012-2014 ) ferritin &gt; 800 ng/ml 22 % ferritin &gt; 1200 ng/ml . In one local dialysis center , close 45 % patient seem ferritin great 1,200 ng/ml 20 % combination low TSAT high ferritin . Ferric citrate ( Auryxia ) novel , iron-based phosphate binder increase iron store decrease IV iron ESA usage maintain hemoglobin level , may decrease cost ESRD care . By bind phosphate GI tract decrease absorption , ferric citrate lower phosphate concentration serum . In addition effect serum phosphorus level , Auryxia show increase serum iron parameter , include ferritin , iron TSAT . In dialysis patient treat Auryxia 52-week study IV iron could also administer , mean ( SD ) ferritin level rise 593 ( 293 ) ng/mL 895 ( 482 ) ng/mL , mean ( SD ) TSAT level rise 31 % ( 11 ) 39 % ( 17 ) mean ( SD ) iron level rise 73 ( 29 ) mcg/dL 88 ( 42 ) mcg/dL . In contrast , patient treat active control , parameter remain relatively constant .</detailed_description>
