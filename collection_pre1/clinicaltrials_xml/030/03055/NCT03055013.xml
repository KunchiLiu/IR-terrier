	<brief_summary>This randomized phase III trial compare nephrectomy ( surgery remove kidney part kidney ) without nivolumab treat patient kidney cancer limit certain part body ( localize ) . Monoclonal antibody , nivolumab , may interfere ability tumor cell grow spread . Giving nivolumab nephrectomy may make tumor small reduce amount normal tissue need remove , nephrectomy increase survival . It yet know whether nivolumab nephrectomy effective nephrectomy alone treat patient kidney cancer .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To compare recurrence-free survival ( RFS ) patient locally advance renal cell carcinoma randomly assign perioperative nivolumab conjunction radical partial nephrectomy patient randomize surgery alone . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . To evaluate difference recurrence-free survival associate perioperative nivolumab compare surgery alone among subset patient clear cell histology . II . To compare overall survival patient randomize perioperative nivolumab addition resection patient randomize primary tumor resection alone . III . To describe safety tolerability perioperative nivolumab . TERTIARY OBJECTIVES : I . To correlate primary tumor 's expression program cell death 1 ligand 1 ( PD-L1 ) outcome . II . To correlate expression PD-L1 tumor tissue recurrence outcome . III . To archive image central confirmation recurrence future correlative work American College Radiology Imaging Network ( ACRIN ) , include marker predict outcome response . IV . To prospectively collect tumor biologic specimen ( e.g. , serum , peripheral blood mononuclear cell [ PBMCs ] ) future correlative study . V. To characterize pharmacokinetics nivolumab explore exposure response relationship respect safety efficacy . VI . To characterize immunogenicity nivolumab . VII . To evaluate difference change baseline patient-reported symptom toxicity among patient randomize treatment nivolumab compare surgery alone . OUTLINE : Patients randomize 1 2 treatment arm . ARM I : Patients receive nivolumab intravenously ( IV ) 60 minute day 1 . Treatment repeat every 14 day 2 course . Patients undergo partial radical nephrectomy . Patient receive nivolumab IV day 1 . Treatment repeat every 14 day 6 course , every 28 day 6 course absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . ARM II : Patients undergo partial radical nephrectomy follow observation . After completion study treatment , patient follow every 3 month 2 year , every 6 month 3 year , every 12 month 5 year .</detailed_description>
