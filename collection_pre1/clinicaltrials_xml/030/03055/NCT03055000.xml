	<brief_summary>Background : Mosquitos carry disease cause major health problem death worldwide . The AGS-v vaccine target proteins mosquito saliva . This may help prevent many mosquito-borne disease . It might also reduce lifespan mosquito bite vaccinate person . Objective : To see AGS-v vaccine safe human affect immune system . Eligibility : Healthy adult age 18 50 Design : Participants screen another study . Participants randomly assign get either vaccine booster vaccine , vaccine without booster , placebo . These give needle upper arm . Participants visit include medical history , physical exam , blood urine test : Baseline : They get vaccine monitor 2 hour . Follow-up visit 1 2 week baseline . Visit 3 week baseline : They get booster monitor 2 hour . Follow-up visit 1 2 week booster visit . Visit 3 5 week booster visit : This include mosquito feeding . Mosquitos grown lab allow bite arm . Blood drawn 4 time 3 hour feed . Phone follow-up day mosquito feed . After feed visit , 5 follow-up visit every 2 month Participants keep symptom diary 7 day vaccine . They record temperature . They measure redness around injection site . They document possible photograph mosquito bite get .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Study Healthy Volunteers Evaluate Safety Immunogenicity AGS-v , Universal Mosquito-Borne Disease Vaccine</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Mosquito-borne disease continue cause significant morbidity mortality worldwide despite on-going control effort . In 2015 , &gt; 200 million case malaria worldwide , cause nearly half million death , death occur among child age 5 year . Mosquitos also transmit arbovirus , include dengue , yellow fever , West Nile virus , chikungunya , Rift Valley fever , Japanese encephalitis , Zika virus . The current new outbreak Zika virus Central South America , well Caribbean , serve reminder quickly virus spread difficult control . In protocol plan perform Phase I study novel universal mosquito-borne disease vaccine . Through modulation immune system mosquito feeding , vaccine target vector saliva may provide prophylaxis multiple arboviral protozoal disease . In addition vaccine potentially lead reduced mosquito lifespan feed therefore also reduce transmission disease . In protocol hope demonstrate safety vaccine similar SEEK peptide base vaccine Flu-v HIV-v find good safety profile previous Phase I trial . We also hope demonstrate immunomodulation control clean Aedes aegypti mosquito feed demonstrate proof concept efficacy vaccine . With current rise Zika Americas threat local mosquito transmission U.S. rest world , successful universal mosquito-borne disease vaccine offer benefit target emerge disease well many establish infection dengue malaria make deal newly emerge epidemic challenge .</detailed_description>
