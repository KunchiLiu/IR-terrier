	<brief_summary>Bariatric surgery procedure consistently demonstrate reduce long-term co-morbidities mortality . Despite benefit , weight regain common , usually initiate around two year initial procedure , underlie mechanism often enlargement anastomosis diameter Roux-en-Y gastric bypass . Although reduction anastomosis diameter report association endoscopic argon plasma coagulation , knowledge therapy formally test randomize control trial . objective study conduct randomize , parallel control trial compare endoscopic argon plasma coagulation reduce enlargement anastomosis diameter Roux-en-Y gastric bypass versus control initial diagnostic endoscopic follow observation . The investigator hypothesize argon coagulation arm achieve great weight reduction , low incidence adverse event .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Endoscopic Argon Plasma Coagulation Vs. Control For Weight Regain After Gastric Surgery</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This parallel randomize controlled trial 1:1 allocation ratio , compare endoscopic argon plasma coagulation reduce enlargement anastomosis diameter Roux-en-Y gastric bypass versus control initial diagnostic endoscopic follow observation . The study design report accordance CONSORT statement parallel randomize trial . Eventual change make design trial commencement fully report , include change eligibility criterion throughout study . Ethical aspect : The study undergo full review local Institutional Review Board , potential participant provide informed consent . Study protocol initiate consent sign . Participants : Inclusion criterion involve consecutive patient previously undergone bariatric procedure present symptom weight regain , difficulty maintain weight , lack satiety meal . The investigator exclude patient meet criterion . No treatment provide . A total 40 participant part analysis , 20 per randomization arm . Setting : Data collect Kaiser Clinic São José Rio Preto , Brazil . Participant accrual start April 2016 , end follow-up occur around end 2017 . Interventions : Interventions argon randomize arm include endoscopic procedure full inventory , measurement anastomosis diameter , argon plasma coagulation . The control arm undergo full inventory measurement anastomosis diameter , without intervention . Participants allocate observational arm presenting continue symptom weight regain , difficulty maintain weight , lack satiety meal prevent undergoing argon intervention , although analysis still analyze result within observation arm , thus observe intention treat protocol . Outcomes : Primary outcome interested weight regain , gastrointestinal symptom , satiety verbal analog scale . Secondary outcome measure include fast glucose concentration , HbA1c concentration , body weight , body mass index , waist circumference , arterial blood pressure , plasma total cholesterol , HDL cholesterol triglyceride , quality life , surgical complication , diabetes-related complication . Sample size : The sample size estimate 40 participant total , 20 randomization arm . Randomization : The random sequence generate use statistical language R researcher involve subject allocation . The randomization schedule block size undisclosed size , stratification . Randomization implement administrative assistant use seal , sequentially numbered envelope . Researchers specifically instruct attempt break randomization schedule manner . Subject allocation perform principal investigator ( GQ ) soon consent prior endoscopic procedure . Given nature intervention , individual blind regard randomization data analyst . Blinding ensure code final dataset .</detailed_description>
