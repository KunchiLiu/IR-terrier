	<detailed_description>Problems ability smell refer olfactory dysfunction ( OD ) . This condition widespread issue . 10-20 % adult OD , 15 million individual US self-reporting past year . Chronic rhinosinusitis ( CRS ) define 12 week longer non-clear nasal drainage , nasal congestion , facial pain pressure , and/or decrease sense smell . CRS common cause OD . Up 78 % patient CRS report decrease sense smell . Several previous study show beneficial treatment option OD call olfactory training ( OT ) . OT consist smell different odor several time per day , every day several month . These study show OT improve sense smell patient lose sense smell due acute infection , head trauma , diseases brain like Parkinson 's disease . OT , however , study previously treatment OD due CRS . The propose study use randomize controlled trial investigate OT effective treatment OD CRS . It also investigate widely available low cost odor , call essential oil , effective traditionally use , pure fragrance oil , OT CRS . Lastly , modify Questionnaire Olfactory Disorders ( mQOD ) test determine use valid measure monitor patient 's response treatment . Patients diagnose CRS report sense smell diminish standard intake survey give patient recruit study treat practitioner . Once enrol consent , subject take mQOD undergo baseline Brief Smell Identification Test ( BSIT ) test . They randomly assign one three group . The subject two group ( n = 50 subject per group ) receive OT subject third group ( n = 50 subject ) serve control group receive OT . Subjects OT group ask smell four different odor rotation five minute two time per day , total 10 minute participation per day . Half patient assigned OT group give odor make fragrance oil . The half give odor make essential oil use . Patients blind whether give fragrance oil essential oil . Subjects OT group ask record training session provide journal . All subject regardless group send electronic version mQOD via email first second month . Regardless group subject assign , continue take medication treatment CRS enrol study . After three month , subject complete survey well second BSIT test . This study determine ) OT effective treatment OD due CRS , b ) essential oil effective pure fragrance oil OT CRS , c ) mQOD use monitor treatment OD CRS .</detailed_description>
