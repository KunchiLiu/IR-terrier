	<brief_summary>Introduction : The prevalence Diabetes Mellitus ( DM ) rise world . About 30 % DM patient suffer Depression . Depression DM patient associated adverse outcome include poor medication adherence , poor glycaemic control , early death . In resource constrain sub-Saharan Africa ( SSA ) clinic patient volumes high staff shortage rife , peer support suggest mean deliver psychosocial care person chronic illness order improve patient 's outcome . However , little do examine efficacy peer support clinical outcome . Project aim : The main study objective develop peer support model depression care patient DM test efficacy clinical outcome . Methods : This study employ qualitative quantitative measure . First , investigator present peer support model health worker within DM clinic , ask feasibility use model DM patient depression . The investigator identify 10 DM patient major depression initiate antidepressant . Once patient clinical remission , investigator interview assess perception feasibility use peer support DM patient newly diagnose depression . The investigator also interview health care worker hospital administrator assess perception use peer support within clinic , potential barrier need address implementation model . Based data qualitative interview , investigator refine adapt peer support model , train 10 DM patient receive antidepressant clinical remission deliver peer support newly diagnose patient depression . Newly diagnose depressed patient randomly assign receive either antidepressant plus peer support ( n=65 ) antidepressants alone ( n=65 ) . Study participant follow 48 week assess , glycaemic control , depression severity , mental illness stigma , depression treatment uptake adherence . Result : investigator anticipate finding efficacy peer support DM depression outcomes useful generate data effect size necessary calculate sample size cluster randomize trial ( CRT ) .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>The Efficacy Peer Support Model Depression Care Patients With Diabetes Mellitus</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Methods : This pragmatic randomize control trial 1:1 allocation ratio case control . Study Setting : This project implement DM clinic Nsambya Hospital Kampala City . The clinic , staff three nurse , medical officer specialist physician , open week . The nurse provide DM care include elicit symptom , provide medication refill , well refer complicate case medical officer ( MO ) specialist physician . The medical officer specialist physician manage referral complication DM . Identification depress patient participate peer support feasibility study : In first four week study , clinic attendee screen depression train lay health care worker ( TLHW ) use PHQ-2 triage . Screen positive case ( PHQ-2≥3 ) send MO conduct depression diagnostic interview use Mini International Neuropsychiatric Interview ( MINI ) till 10 depressed patient identify . All depressed patient initiate either Imipramine 75mg/day Fluoxetine 20mg/day , reassess week 4 week 6 side effect symptom remission use Hamilton Depression Rating scale ( HAM-D ) . Conducting qualitative interview assess feasibility peer support : When 10 patient remission ( ˜ 6-8 week ) investigator conduct qualitative interview , hospital administrator ( n=2 ) , medical personel DM clinic ( n=5 ) . During interview , investigator assess participant 's perception feasibility acceptability engage experienced DM patient provide peer support patient newly diagnose depression . Informed consent seek participant . Interview procedure : Dr Elialilia Okello conduct qualitative interview . The participant ask DM clinic would suitable candidate provide peer support newly diagnose depressed patient . The peer support model present participant internalize/appreciate concept , Interview guide : The interview base guide detailed standard probe ensure key question address , allow comparison across individual category respondent . Questions open-ended allow exploration new lead also generation rich narrative . All interview tape record , translate English ( case Luganda , local language use ) transcribe verbatim . Qualitative data analysis : Data explore identify key theme relationship theme analyze use Atlas.ti . The result qualitative interview help investigator refine peer support model use . After depressed patient full clinical remission , investigator ask clinic staff nominate among atleast 5 potential candidate become peer support buddy . This number adequate investigator pilot test atleast 5 interview group peer support process . Self-nominations also encourage patient treatment make aware eligibility criterion . The eligibility criterion patient ; ( ) least 18 year age ; ( b ) speak Luganda ; ( c ) register clinic least 6 month ; ( ) successful adherer , define staff one consistently keep appointment self-reports able adhere treatment ; ( e ) currently suffer physical co-morbid mental illness , use substance abuse ; ( f ) socially skilled define ( albeit subjectively ) staff ; ( g ) , receive antidepressant least 10 week ( clinical remission least 4 week ) . The investigator screen clinic attendee identify potential buddy number identify use method less 5 . Patients depress ineligible become peer support buddy follow duration study control . Buddy training : A 2-day training workshop peer support `` buddy '' conduct PI use buddy train manual develop Simoni . The workshop include didactic content , role-plays . Buddies teach strategy gear address four component peer support ( self-care , adherence , stigma , social support ) . Buddies meet group supervision PI seek clarity area miss earlier assign newly diagnose patient . Once trained , buddy assign 5 patient peer one time . Content peer support training : Buddies teach strive toward follow goal assign peer : ( ) explain purpose contact educational supportive , aim help peer adhere antidepressant hypoglycaemic medication ; ( b ) learn peer 's regimen make suggestion follow , borrow experience ; ( c ) encourage peer follow treatment regimen praise adherence express confidence ability adhere ; ( ) allow peer express worry , anxiety , concern dealt , ( e ) warm friendly , ( f ) refer frequently success regimen present guide model peer follow . The peer buddy use goal set achievable target meet . Buddies specifically instruct give medical advice peer , rather encourage peer discuss clinician question medical nature . Sample size power calculation peer support study objective : The sample size RCT component study calculate compare primary outcome measure HbA1c ≤ 7 HAM-D ≤7 intervention control arm 48 week initiation antidepressant treatment . To calculate sample size , investigator use finding RCT Safren et al , [ 61 ] . Using standard deviation mean study [ 61 ] , investigator estimate 65 patient per arm ( intervention vs. control ) require 80 % chance detect , significant 5 % level , 1.4 [ SD = 2 ] mean difference HbA1c level HAM-D depression score , take account 20 % loss follow-up 48 week . Peer support process : Participants intervention arm receive peer support every two week 12 week , monthly 'booster ' session week 16 , 20 , 24 28 commencing treatment . However , result qualitative interview guide investigator feasibility number meeting . Peer support provide group patient rather one-to one session . A number barrier ( transport availability , distance clinic , work schedule ) may make difficult pre-determine meeting take place , investigator ensure inclusion criterion peer program include willingness attend session . Buddies keep ongoing record contact peer client assessment integrity intervention across buddy , across peer , time . Monitoring fidelity supervision : In first 4 week implementation peer support intervention ( 17 week study ) , session audio record assess adherence manual guideline . The PI listen recording , advise buddy accordingly . The peer complete anonymous evaluation questionnaire follow first two session ; information questionnaire use improve quality peer support . A buddy log design capture follow information ; ) day meeting occur , b ) duration meeting , c ) member present , ) issue discuss , e ) challenge encounter . The investigator master 's degree clinical psychologist sit meeting also collect data buddy end meeting , relay data PI . Over entire duration intervention , PI also attend session rotator basis ; PI chance attend session group . The study participant arm follow 48 week initiation antidepressant treatment . The patient arm review MO week 2 4 address challenge due side effect , critical prevent early discontinuation treatment . At visit , research assistant use HAM-D ass depression symptom severity , standardized side effect screen instrument antidepressant side effect check-list ( ASEC ) [ 63 ] ass tolerance medication side effect . The HbA1c test perform baseline , week 24 48 . At visit , research assistant also collect data participant . Research data collect baseline , week 12 , 24 , 48 initiation patient treatment . Quantitative data analysis : A trial profile shall use detail recruitment follow-up patient . Analyses conduct compare group baseline , week 12 , 24 , 48 assess short- long-term effect peer support intervention . The investigator shall analyze data use intention-to-treat approach . The dependent variable ( HbA1c HAM-D ) present continuous variable . Predictor outcomes include adherence , mental illness stigma level , social support self-care present continuous categorical variable . Baseline characteristic intervention control arm compare 5 % level assess successful randomization achieve . Students t-tests ( continuous normally distribute ) , Mann-Whitney U-test ( continuous non-normally distribute ) , Chi-squared test ( categorical ) use . Data potential confounders effect modifier , include variable fail achieve successful randomization ( e.g . sociodemographic parameter ) shall use control confound effect modification . The investigator shall conduct within-subjects ( time ) between-subject ( group ) analyse . Between-subject analysis 48 week use assess direct effect intervention determine significant difference mean HAM-D HbA1c score intervention control arm . Within-subject analysis perform among patient intervention arm apply Generalized Estimating Equations ( GEE ) method repeat measure data . To examine role social support mental health stigma mediate factor relationship depression treatment adherence level glycaemic control outcome , three simple regression analysis ) predictor ( social support mental illness stigma ) outcome ( HbA1c HAM-D score ) , ii ) predictor mediator , iii ) mediator outcome , conduct follow multiple regression analysis .</detailed_description>
