The habit formation condition affect parental support intention underlie outcome expectation ( benefit PA ) support child PA effect behavior tie initial intention behavioural action work independent goal intention . 2 . Is intergenerational , seasonal , gender difference across primary outcome assign condition ? Hypothesis : Parents habit formation condition show high PA via activity perform child comparison condition . No difference gender season hypothesize base current research present</detailed_description>
