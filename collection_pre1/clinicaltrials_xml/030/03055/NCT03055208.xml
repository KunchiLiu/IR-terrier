	<brief_title>Early Stereotactic Gamma Knife Radiosurgery Residual Tumor After Surgery Newly Diagnosed Glioblastoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Glioblastomas highly malignant brain tumor recur 6 month treatment . Most recurrence develop edge surgical margin common reason early recurrence glioblastoma tumor completely resect . This may case intraoperative neuro-monitoring indicates resection would impair certain motor function . Physicians identify residual tumor early ( 24-72h surgery ) postoperative MRI scan could treat region . However , treatment would part recommend standard care thus , treatment area need clinical trial . The aim trial evaluate use another modality deplete area residual tumor identify early postoperative MRI scan provide relevant benefit term progression-free survival ( mean prolongation time patient experience re-growth tumor ) . The modality term `` radiosurgery '' , non-invasive technique delete cell without use blade highly focus beam gamma ray . The machine focus ray ( like magnify glass focus light ) , call 'gamma knife ' . Gamma knife radiosurgery safe effective treatment plethora malignant benign brain tumor technique use since 1950s continuous improvement precision patient comfort .</detailed_description>
