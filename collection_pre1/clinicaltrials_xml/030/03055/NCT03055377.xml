	<detailed_description>Cannabis use particularly prevalent problematic among youth . Compared one eleven cannabis-exposed adult , one six cannabis-exposed youth develop cannabis use disorder . Moreover , youth prone adult potentially last adverse effect cannabis use , include cognitive impairment , alter brain development , poor educational outcome , diminish life achievement . Despite , relatively little work focus develop optimally efficacious cannabis use disorder treatment , particularly among youth . Current evidence-based treatment convey generally small modest effect size , novel approach critically need . Among promising approach over-the-counter antioxidant medication N-acetylcysteine ( NAC ) . Our team previously demonstrate superior NAC versus placebo ( PBO ) abstinence outcome youth CUD concurrently receive behavioral treatment contingency management ( CM ) . Further work need test whether NAC efficacious without platform CM . The propose trial 12-week randomize , placebo-controlled trial N-acetylcysteine cannabis use disorder ( CUD ) youth ( N=192 ) . Participants randomize double-blind NAC PBO , yield two equally-allocated treatment group . All participant receive brief weekly cannabis cessation counsel medication management . The primary efficacy outcome proportion negative urine cannabinoid test 12-week active treatment , compare group . We also serially assess cognitive task performance , examine change performance among participant achieve abstinence versus . This propose trial clear `` next step '' assessment NAC extremely promise youth CUD treatment modality , position inform researcher , clinician , general public , address critical need optimization youth CUD treatment .</detailed_description>
