	<detailed_description>Primary objective : To assess efficacy community-based deployment Wolbachia-infected Aedes aegypti mosquito reduce incidence symptomatic , virologically-confirmed dengue case severity Yogyakarta resident age 3-30 year release area , relative non-release area . Secondary objective : - To measure efficacy Wolbachia method reduce incidence symptomatic virologically confirm Zika virus chikungunya virus infection release area , relative non-release area - To quantify level human mobility within Yogyakarta City , estimate degree mobility reduce power measure effect cluster-randomised intervention Study setting : The study conduct Yogyakarta City Bantul District , locate province Yogyakarta Special Region , Indonesia.The study site 26 km2 size , include 24 km2 within Yogyakarta City , 2km2 adjacent Bantul District . The total population study area approximately 350,000 . Study design : A cluster randomise trial test-negative design conduct . The study site divide 24 cluster . The intervention allocate use constrain block randomisation parallel 1:1 assignment intervention control . The intervention deployment Wolbachia-infected Aedes aegypti mosquito . Wolbachia deployment conduct intervention cluster aim achieve Wolbachia establishment ( &gt; 80 % mean Wolbachia prevalence trap mosquito ) throughout intervention area within one year . The impact Wolbachia deployments dengue incidence assess comparing exposure distribution ( probability live Wolbachia-treated area ) among virologically-confirmed dengue case present network public primary clinic ( Puskesmas ) , exposure distribution among patient febrile illness non-arboviral aetiology present network clinic temporal window . Dengue case arbovirus-negative control sample concurrently within population patient present febrile illness study clinic network , case control status classify retrospectively base result laboratory diagnostic testing . Power calculation estimate approximately 1000 dengue case 4000 arbovirus-negative time-matched control need detect 50 % great reduction dengue incidence Wolbachia-treated cluster compare untreated cluster , 80 % power . These estimation dependent upon assumption regard expect distribution case control across cluster study period . As dengue distribution fluctuate substantially year year , require sample size re-calculated 50 % target recruitment complete ( n=500 dengue case ) , use observe distribution participant untreated arm . Enrolment continue 24 month , longer require achieve minimum sample size . Participant selection : Cases control enrol within population patient present undifferentiated fever 1-4 day duration , one participate local health clinic ( Puskesmas ) . All patient meet eligibility criterion invite participate study . From baseline historical data expect approximately 5000 participant per annum enrol , among 10-20 % subsequently classify virologically confirm dengue . Enrolment continue 24 month , longer require achieve minimum sample size . Recruitment continue 24 month even estimate minimum required sample size reach time . Analysis plan : Permutation test standard regression model ( include Cox proportional hazard model share frailty ) use estimate relative risk relative hazard ( incidence rate ratio ) dengue Wolbachia-treated versus untreated cluster , account time-matching case control non-independence study participant resident intervention cluster . The intention-to-treat analysis consider Wolbachia exposure binary depend allocation cluster residence . The per-protocol analysis consider Wolbachia exposure weight index base Wolbachia prevalence trap mosquito cluster residence cluster visit ten day prior illness onset .</detailed_description>
