	<brief_summary>Endoscopic sinus surgery ( ESS ) chronic rhinosinusitis ( CRS ) common procedure US , 250,000 case perform annually . Currently , consensus , evidence-based post-operative pain regimen ; majority practitioner opt combination acetaminophen narcotic pain control . Most rhinologists avoid NSAIDs due decrease platelet aggregation theoretical risk increase post-operative bleeding . No study date evaluate use ibuprofen CRS patient follow ESS . Additionally , lack information regard average narcotic requirement follow ESS . The purpose pilot prospective cohort study evaluate use narcotic sinus surgery effect ibuprofen non-packed nose follow ESS . This investigation help gain understanding current opioid use post-op sinus patient assess safety effectiveness post-operative ibuprofen administration pain . The investigator aim quantify average narcotic use follow ESS , well evaluate effect addition ibuprofen standard analgesic regimen pain score post-operative epistaxis . The investigator hypothesize use ibuprofen decrease pain score 10-cm visual analogue scale compare individual use ibuprofen post-operatively , lead decrease opioid use post-operative period . Additionally , investigator hypothesize increase post-operative bleeding rate , base 10-cm visual analogue scale bleed event . In summary , first study investigator knowledge examine effect post-operative ibuprofen use effect opioid use , well pain epistaxis outcome , ESS . By perform pilot prospective cohort study , investigator equip design perform optimal prospective , randomize study evaluate effect NSAID ESS post-operative period . The overarch goal investigation decrease opioid use post-operative pain control follow ESS .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Effect Post-operative Ibuprofen After Surgery Chronic Rhinosinusitis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Opioid use abuse major public health issue . US Surgeon General , Dr. Vikta Murthy , recently call investigation evidence-based prescribing opioids . Endoscopic sinus surgery ( ESS ) chronic rhinosinusitis ( CRS ) common procedure US , 250,000 case perform annually.1 Currently , consensus appropriate post-operative analgesic control ESS . Many practitioner use combination acetaminophen narcotic pain control . Importantly , rhinologists avoid use NSAIDs due theoretical concern decrease platelet aggregation potential risk increase post-operative hemorrhage . However , study date evaluate use ibuprofen CRS patient follow ESS . Conceivably , investigator improve post-operative pain control ESS use ibuprofen , may decrease standard prescription narcotic analgesic . Given 60 % narcotic overdose death due prescribed medication , would help deliver improved pain control less narcotic prescription . Therefore , objective perform pilot prospective cohort study evaluate use narcotic sinus surgery effect ibuprofen follow ESS . This pilot study provide critical baseline data narcotic use , ibuprofen safety ibuprofen analgesic impact optimize design future prospective , randomize study . Thus , specific aim follow : Specific Aim 1 : Patients CRS document narcotic use first 7 day follow sinus surgery . This allow u reform prescribing practice . Hypothesis : There wide range narcotic usage among post-op patient mean usage less amount typically prescribe post-operatively . Specific Aim 2 : During enrollment investigator ask patient self-select study arm would like join ( ibuprofen versus ibuprofen ) thus document willingness participate , important designing future randomize study . Hypothesis : Most patient approach wiling participate indicate willingness part similar randomize study . Specific Aim 3a : Determine impact ibuprofen post-operative sinus surgery patient ' pain level . The investigator analyze patient CRS set undergo FESS two cohort ( standard pain regimen standard pain regimen plus ibuprofen ) ass postoperative pain day 1 , 3 , 7 10-cm visual analogue scale , amount post-operative narcotic pain medication use , number day post-operatively take narcotic medication , Hypothesis : Addition ibuprofen decrease post-operative pain decrease number opioid pill use . Specific Aim 3b : Determine impact ibuprofens impact post-operative epistaxis . Using patient cohort , degree epistaxis assess utilizing standardized recording document 10-cm visual analogue scale , well previously use epistaxis grade system.2 The investigator assess outcomes post-operative day 1 , 3 , 7 . Hypothesis : Addition ibuprofen demonstrate increase post-operative epistaxis compare control group . At study institution , approximately 250 endoscopic sinus case perform per year perform two rhinologists . This yield ample potential research subject complete study . To investigator knowledge , one previous study look effect peri-operative NSAIDs ESS . This study find increase risk intraoperative postoperative bleeding administration ketorolac . This first study examine effect post-operative oral ibuprofen use effect opioid use , well pain epistaxis outcome .</detailed_description>
