	<detailed_description>Associative memory refers remember association two item , face name word English word another language . It important learning , also one first aspects memory performance impact age Alzheimer×³s disease . For decade , neuroscientist investigate associative learning memory way accelerate enhance associative learning memory . Transcranial Direct Current stimulation ( tDCS ) non-invasive painless electrical stimulation technique demonstrate accelerate learning improve memory study . Previous research also emphasize importance repeat retrieval practice way accelerate learn enhance associative memory performance . Therefore , study examine effect repeat retrieval practice associative memory performance use two version associative memory task . To investigate whether possible accelerate learning improve associative memory use tDCS repeat retrieval practice , performance Verbal Paired-Associate memory task first visit 1 week compare four study group . The first group get active tDCS version verbal paired-associate learning task repeat retrieval practice . The second group get active tDCS version verbal paired-associate learning task without repeat retrieval practice . The third group get sham tDCS version verbal paired-associate learning task repeat retrieval practice fourth group get Sham tDCS version verbal paired-associate learning task without repeat retrieval practice .</detailed_description>
