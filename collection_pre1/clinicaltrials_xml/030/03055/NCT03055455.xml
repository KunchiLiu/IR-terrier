	<brief_summary>In critically ill child severe sepsis , neurophysiologic derangement often proceed undetected lead irreversible brain injury cause neurocognitive behavioral deficit . The etiology impairment unclear , however , likely neural injury preventable . The overarch goal study show acute acquire structural microstructural brain injury occur critically ill child severe sepsis , injury related neuropsychological deficit impaired cerebral autoregulation ( CAR ) . Subjects complete Magnetic resonance ( MR ) image within 2-10 day recognition severe sepsis . Subjects undergo serial interrogation CAR 10 day . CAR determine correlation arterial blood pressure middle cerebral artery flow velocity measure transcranial doppler ultrasonography cerebral oximetry derive near-infrared spectroscopy . Subjects also participate neuropsychological evaluation 6 month enrollment evaluate multiple domain behavior cognition .</brief_summary>
