	<brief_summary>Mepolizumab humanize Immunoglobulin G1 ( IgG1 ) monoclonal antibody ( mAb ) act Interleukin-5 ( IL-5 ) , responsible growth differentiation , recruitment , activation , survival eosinophil ; thereby reduce production survival eosinophil may therapeutic subject atopic dermatitis ( AD ) . This study investigate efficacy safety mepolizumab ( 100 milligram [ mg ] subcutaneous [ SC ] administer every 4 week ) compare placebo adult subject moderate severe atopic dermatitis ( AD ) . Subjects randomized 1:1 either placebo SC mepolizumab SC . The study comprise pre-screening period approximately 4 week , screen period 2 week , follow 16-Week study treatment period ( 16 week last dose study treatment Week 12 ) follow-up period 4-week . The total duration subject participation approximately 26 week . ( Note : For subject , may need stop treatment biologic , total Pre-Screening Screening period may last 20 week total duration participation study may 40 week ) .</brief_summary>
