	<brief_summary>This clinical trial study well helical compute tomography ( CT ) , positron emission tomography ( PET ) /CT , magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) , cone beam compute tomography ( CBCT ) work alone combination predict whether tumor cell spread jaw bone ( jaw invasion ) patient oral cancer . Imaging , helical CT , PET/CT , MRI , CBCT , may help find far cancer spread . Accurate prediction presence absence jaw invasion may help create good surgical treatment plan patient oral cancer .</brief_summary>
