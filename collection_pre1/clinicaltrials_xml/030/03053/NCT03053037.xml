	<brief_summary>This study look two different way perform root canal treatment . The study look difference compare two different treatment option 2-year period.More specifically , study evaluate small `` skinny '' root canal shape compare large `` broad '' root canal shape affect success root canal treatment . Both type treatment standard care aim treat infection inside tooth . When tooth infect bacteria , see dark area radiograph around root infect tooth . If dark area become small go away completely root canal treatment feel pain symptom , know treatment successful need treatment tooth . To measure size dark area around tooth ( i.e . volume ) treatment need take two limited volume three-dimensional radiograph ( cone beam compute tomography-CBCT ) , one prior treatment one two year root canal treatment complete . These radiographs accurate detecting change lesion size regular periapical radiograph . We assess change lesion volume teeth include study help u find difference success two root canal treatment protocol , We specifically look person diagnose necrotic permanent mandibular molar evident radiographic lesion ( i.e . dark area around tooth ) retain mouth root canal treatment permanent restoration . This study place participant different treatment group randomization . Randomization mean place chance ( like flip coin ) treatment group . For study , two treatment group ( protocol ) list . Protocol 1 : Group S : Root canal treatment perform 2-visits use hand file rotary instrument final canal shape size # 25 . Protocol 2 : Group L : Root canal treatment perform 2-visits use hand file rotary instrument final canal shape size # 35</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Apical Size Root Canal Treatment Success Trial ( AS-RCT Trial )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>We perform randomize , blind clinical trial clinical , microbiological volumetric outcome . The study population select adult patient need endodontic treatment mandibular molar diagnose pulp necrosis present visible radiographic lesion associate least mesial root . Patients randomize one two arm ( group S : apical size # 25 ; group L : apical size # 35 ) follow 2 year post-treatment . Treatment sequence Endodontic resident direct supervision study investigator perform treatment ; provider train calibrated root canal treatment protocol microbial sample collection . The calibration session repeat annually completion study . Treatment protocol First Appointment 1 . Pre-operative CBCT obtain baseline clinical sign symptom record . Pain level record 0-10 visual analog scale ( VAS ) . 2 . After ascertain adequate local anesthesia , rubber dam isolation obtain field disinfect 3 % hydrogen peroxide 2.5 % sodium hypochlorite ( NaOCl ) solution previously describe ( 37 ) . 3 . Access perform operative field disinfect 2.5 % NaOCl follow 5 % sodium thiosulphate . A microbiological sample ( S0 ) field obtain paper point . S0 use negative control ( i.e . sterility sample ) . 4 . The mesial canal wall touch lightly hand file disrupt bacterial biofilms microbiological specimen ( S1 ) obtain ( described detail ) . 5 . Orifice enlarge Protaper Universal SX rotary file ( Dentsply , Tulsa , OK ) Apical patency determine size # 10 hand file work length obtain use Root ZX apex locator ( J Morita USA , Irving , CA ) verify PA radiograph . 6 . Coronal 2/3 mesial canal WL instrument Vortex Blue rotary file 25/06 ( Dentsply ) . First apical binding file ( FABF ) record stage serve covariable analysis . 7 . Apical 1/3 instrumentation mesial canal carry accord assign group follow : 1 . Group S : Instrumentation technique work length ( WL ) use sequence 15/04 →20/04 →25/04 →25/06 Vortex Blue rotary file system ( Dentsply ) . 2 . Group L : Instrumentation technique WL use sequence 15/04 →20/04 →25/04 →25/06 → 30/04 →35/04 Vortex Blue rotary file system ( Dentsply ) . 8 . Distal ( ) canal instrumentation standardize group follow : 1 . Coronal 2/3 distal canal instrument Vortex Blue rotary file 25/06 2 . Apical instrumentation WL use sequence 15/04 →20/04 →25/04 →25/06 → 30/04 →35/04→40/04 Vortex Blue rotary file system ( Dentsply ) 9 . The canal irrigate use 30-gauge side-vented needle 6 % NaOCl ( 10ml/canal ) follow 17 % ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid ( EDTA ; 5ml/canal ) follow final rinse 6 % NaOCl ( 10ml/canal ) 5 % sodium thiosulfate ( 2ml/canal ) . 10 . A microbiological specimen ( S2 ) obtain mesial canal , canal dry paper point . 11 . Calcium hydroxide [ Ca ( OH ) 2 ] place interim intracanal medicament temporary restoration consist Fuji II LC ( GC Corp , Tokyo , Japan ) place access . A post-op radiograph make . Second appointment ( within 10-14 day ) 1 . Clinical sign symptom record . Pain level record VAS . 2 . After ascertain adequate local anesthesia , rubber dam isolation obtain field disinfect describe . 3 . Root canal system access second sterility microbiological sample obtain ( S00 ) . 4 . Ca ( OH ) 2 remove irrigate 6 % NaOCl ( 10ml/canal ) follow 17 % EDTA ( 5ml/canal ) final rinse 6 % NaOCl ( 10ml/canal ) . This follow irrigation 5 % sodium thiosulfate ( 2ml/canal ) . 5 . A microbiological specimen ( S3 ) obtain mesial canal , canal dry paper point . 6 . Final obturation perform gutta-percha AH+ sealer utilize continuous wave condensation technique . 7 . Access restore permanently patient refer dentist full coverage restoration . Adequate exist full coverage restoration remain place . A post-op radiograph make .</detailed_description>
