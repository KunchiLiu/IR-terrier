	<detailed_description>This open-label , randomize study compare efficacy safety Bruton 's Tyrosine Kinase ( BTK ) inhibitor BGB-3111 ibrutinib subject Waldenström 's Macroglobulinemia require therapy . Subjects baseline bone marrow sample assay sequence MYD88 gene . Approximately 150 subject MYD88 mutation enrol onto Cohort 1 randomize receive 160 mg BGB-3111 PO BID ( treatment Arm A ) receive 420mg ibrutinib QD ( treatment Arm B ) disease progression unacceptable toxicity . Subjects MYD88 wild type enrol Cohort 2 receive 160 mg BGB-3111 PO BID ( treatment Arm C ) disease progression unacceptable toxicity .</detailed_description>
