	<brief_title>Mobile Critical Care Recovery Program Acute Respiratory Failure Survivors</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Five million Americans require admission intensive care unit ( ICU ) annually due life threaten illness , number expect rise.4 Two million ICU admission secondary Acute Respiratory Failure ( ARF ) half require mechanical ventilation . Greater 50 % patient ARF survive ICU stay suffer long‐term morbidity form functional disability , cognitive disability , major minor depression , anxiety . These complication negatively impact quality life ( QOL ) ARF survivor , interfere physical emotional recovery , lead long‐term disability less half ARF survivor return work force . Ongoing care ARF survivor estimate cost $ 3.5 million per ARF survivor 1 year . This constellation ICU sequela attendant morbidity designate post‐intensive care syndrome ( PICS ) . There community resource rehabilitation service available ARF survivor , current fragmented nature healthcare system unable integrate coordinate care order provide meaningful recovery . The Institute Medicine recommend development care coordination program deliver patient‐centered interdisciplinary‐based medical care . Indiana University Center Aging Research ( IUCAR ) 20 year experience deliver interdisciplinary , collaborative care pragmatic intervention utilize care coordinator . Care coordinator delivery model improve care patient dementia , depression , functional decline PICS . Our PICS clinic , Critical Care Recovery Center ( CCRC ) develop 2011 enhance cognitive , physical , psychological recovery ICU survivor . Since , CCRC provide care 200 survivor high burden PICS ( 88 % cognitive impairment ; 60 % depression ) . CCRC show feasibility initial efficacy manage PICS . However give traditional outpatient clinic structure , CCRC limit physical access ARF survivor , lead delay evaluation add travel burden ARF survivor . Building experience CCRC successful care coordinator base program ; propose mobile model post‐ICU collaborative care great access enhance recovery ARF survivor . The overarch aim propose program improve QOL patient survive episode ARF maximize cognitive , physical , psychological recovery utilize mobile care coordinator . The care coordinator bring intervention patient irrespective patient 's physical location support interdisciplinary team critical care physician , health service scientist , ICU nurse , psychologist , input consultant need . In addition , dynamic feedback process measurement tool care coordination support software inform recovery process . We propose evaluate efficacy collaborative care intervention term `` Mobile Critical Care Recovery Program ( m‐CCRP ) '' randomize clinical trial among survivor ARF .</detailed_description>
