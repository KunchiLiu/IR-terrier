	<brief_title>A Novel Faecal Microbiota Transplantation System Treatment Primary Recurrent Clostridium Difficile Infection</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Clostridium difficile anaerobe , spore-forming bacillus . Infections toxin-producing strain capable cause CD associate enteral disease range severity mild diarrhea fatal fulminant colitis . CD infection ( CDI ) occur among patient take antibiotic previously , suggest normal gut flora capable prevent CDI . The disease mainly treat antibiotic , however , antibiotic show high therapeutic failure recurrence rate . There significant interest development alternative therapeutic strategy . Among alternative method faecal microbiota transplantation ( FMT ) gain acceptance due excellent cure rate low recurrence rate . FMT new approach treat CDI , since antibiotic administer , instead normal gut flora restore administer faecal homogenisate healthy donor . Immediate risk FMT minimal , efficacy excellent , data require short long term safety , appropriate timing course CDI optimal technical protocol prepare fecal homogenisate . In addition , procedure also challenge intervention unappealing nature . To address challenge describe novel faecal transplantation system design ( Burgin-Matic System , BMS ) , suitable production faecal bacterial suspension standardize control environment . Using new approach , multi-center , prospective , interventional clinical study involve two group patient design : 1 . In non-randomized group ( `` R '' ) safety efficacy FMT new , automate transplantation system assess 50 patient suffer `` R '' ecurrent CDI . 2 . In randomized group ( `` F '' ) FMT compare gold standard vancomycin treatment 2x50 patient , `` F '' irst episode CDI , suffer severe infection risk develop recurrent severe disease respond least 72 hour antibiotic treatment . In non-randomized group ( `` R '' ) , safety efficacy FMT assess , hypothesis FMT BMS equally safe effective ( non-inferior ) report international study . In randomized group ( `` F '' ) primary endpoint clinical cure rate various time point , global cure rate 10 week , time clinical cure time global cure , secondary endpoint cost effectiveness , quality life , mortality assess also . Our hypothesis , FMT BMS superior vancomycin treatment term primary secondary endpoint patient .</detailed_description>
