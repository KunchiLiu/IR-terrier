	<brief_title>Evaluate Effectiveness Safety Variable Frequency Stimulation Compared With Constent Frequency Stimulation Patients With Idiopathic Parkinson 's Disease</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>In advanced stage PD , motor symptom dyskinesia effectively treat deep brain stimulation ( DBS ) target subthalamic nucleus ( STN ) . Traditionally , procedure , stimulation set constant frequency electrical stimulation physician program parameter stimulation frequency , pulse width amplitude , stimulate patient ' brain nucleus single frequency , single pulse width single amplitude electric stimulation . Indeed , high frequency stimulation ( HFS ) STN provide consistent , long-term improvement cardinal sign PD . However , treatment effect HFS axial symptom PD , specifically FOG poor often cause impairment . While alleviated use relatively low frequency stimulation ( LFS ) , major concern clinical application LFS exist regard duration therapeutic benefit . Previous study show LFS STN improve axial motor sign PD patient , loss therapeutic efficacy see short term . Thereafter , patient may present increased tremor , rigidity bradykinesia , often intolerable outweigh initial benefit LFS therapy FOG . As , suitable treatment strategy FOG remain establish . Based previous finding relationship stimulation frequency movement rhythm regulation human body , The National Engineering Laboratory Neuromodulation , Tsinghua University , propose method variable frequency stimulation ( VFS ) aid movement .</detailed_description>
