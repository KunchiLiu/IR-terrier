	<brief_summary>This internal pilot first prospective study assess feasibility efficacy add metformin non‐diabetic rectal patient undergo standard care neoadjuvant chemoradiation therapy ( CRT ) . The translational aim study inform predictive factor ( p53 ) mechanism action ( hypoxia , proliferation ) . Metformin use decade patient type 2 diabetes extremely safe toxicity profile . With current interest use metformin cancer therapeutic non‐diabetics , study expect provide proof‐of principle data large study .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Metformin With Neoadjuvant Chemoradiation Improve Pathologic Responses Rectal Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This study phase II , single arm , control , open label internal pilot . The study hypothesis metformin improve rate pathological complete response patient rectal cancer treat neoadjuvant chemoradiation mitigate tumor proliferation hypoxia . The hypothesis test phase II trial , metformin administer prior , CRT . The primary end‐point pCR rate . The study also examine tumor proliferation hypoxia longitudinally tumor biopsy obtain diagnosis well metformin prior CRT . This study , first time , provide proof‐of‐principle whether non‐diabetic patient rectal cancer benefit metformin prior , CRT . These result may guide future trial across site provide biomarkers future patient stratification personalize radiation medicine . Study Schedule : Each participant consent prior enrollment . At baseline , eligibility assess base inclusion/exclusion criterion . Once eligibility confirm document , participant enrol study . Eligible consent participant dispense study drug , metformin . Intervention Period Phase 1 : ( 2 week prior CRT ) Participants begin self‐administer 500 mg metformin twice daily mouth 2 week prior CRT . After 2 week metformin administration prior CRT , optional sigmoidoscopy perform research purpose , consent participant . Phase 2 ( During CRT ) Participants continue metformin dose 500 mg twice daily throughout course CRT . Participants follow weekly usual SOC visit , include weekly blood test determine blood count liver kidney function . Information occurrence adverse event update concomitant medication collect . Phase 3 ( Post‐CRT ) Participants continue metformin dose 500 mg twice daily , complete last dose day prior TME surgery . Follow-up Enrolled participant follow approximately 1 month surgery coincide SOC visit . If enrol participant , reason , become ineligible surgery participant require see two follow‐up visit approximately 4 8 week ( +/‐ 1 week ) chemoradiation . End Study Visit ( 3 Months ) An end study visit conduct 3 month completion surgical resection rectal tumor . Participants become clinically ineligible surgery End Study visit 3 month completion chemoradiation . Statistical analysis : The primary endpoint pCR rate . The pCR rate associate 95 % confidence interval estimate use unadjusted normal approximation binomial proportion ( z approximation ) . A responder define participant exhibit complete response ( total regression , tumor cell , fibrotic mass without mucin ) . pCR rate = sum number complete responders/number participant qualify efficacy analysis . The null hypothesis test pCR rate evaluable participant ≤15 % alternative hypothesis pCR rate great equal 25 % . A pCR ≥ 25 % would justify evaluation study therapy phase III testing . The null hypothesis test use one‐sample binomial test proportion . All participant evaluable toxicity time first treatment metformin , participant receive least one week CRT surgery consider evaluable response . Assessment Tumor Proliferation Hypoxia Proliferation , hypoxia marker metformin activity monitor longitudinally participant use diagnostic biopsy , research biopsy take start CRT , time surgery case without pCR . Markers quantify immunohistochemistry ( IHC ) include Ki67 ( proliferation ) , CA9 ( hypoxia ) , IRS‐P S6‐P ( metformin activity ) . A Colon Cancer Hypoxia Score ( CCHS ) expression six gene recently publish demonstrated confer poor prognosis stage II III colon cancer patient . Hypoxia also assess longitudinally CCHS score measure qPCR . Furthermore , since previous study result suggest p53 mutation exacerbate anti‐proliferative effect metformin , DNA isolate research biopsy p53 DNA bind domain , 93 % mutation occur , sequence . Sample Size consideration The study internal pilot study . The initial goal complete internal pilot study view accrue 15 participant . Twelve participant show minimum number require build confidence interval . The sample 15 therefore sufficient construct confidence interval allow potential drop out . Upon completion internal pilot study , data 15 participant use derive formal sample size calculation large clinical trial . The data 15 individual also incorporate final analysis large trial , hence choice 'internal ' pilot design .</detailed_description>
