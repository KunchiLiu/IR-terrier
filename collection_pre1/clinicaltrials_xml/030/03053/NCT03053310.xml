	<brief_summary>Background Approximately half head neck cancer patient 65 year old diagnosis . Treatment decision older HNCA population challenging , lack evidence-based guideline . Surgery often treatment choice HNCA set curative treatment intend . Though chronological age per se report contraindication surgery , data limit often result retrospective study . Measurement functional age , comprehensive geriatric assessment , suggest several international cancer organization well prognostic indicator . At division maxillofacial surgery otorhinolaryngology , geriatric assessment part routine preoperative stag patient 70 year old old . Objectives The investigator aim determine value G8 predict 30-day postoperative comorbidity old HNCA population undergo elective curative surgery . Moreover , aim examine vulnerability profile patient undergo elective head neck surgery oncology diagnosis . Study design All patient 70 year old , present division maxillofacial surgery otorhinolaryngology curative surgery solid head neck tumour undergo geriatric consult part routine preoperative staging . The presence postoperative morbidity mortality within first 30 day surgery collect primary endpoint . At 30±10 day postoperative , patient re-evaluated G8 CGA . Patient ' quality life also re-examine within 30 day postoperative 6 12 month postoperative . Conclusion There still consensus whether old HNCA patient receive different treatment compare young patient . Data related vulnerability profile old patient require HN surgery , predictive value geriatric screen postoperative morbidity could enable good patient selection future .</brief_summary>
