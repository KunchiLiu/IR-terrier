	<brief_summary>Double blind , randomize multi-center , evaluation efficacy , safety tolerability Nitric Oxide ( NO ) give intermittently via inhalation subject acute bronchiolitis . Bronchiolitis define infection small airway . It also common manifestation acute low respiratory infection ( ALRI ) early infancy , lead cause global child mortality . Nitric Oxide ( NO ) show play critical role various biological function , include vasodilatation smooth muscle , neurotransmission , regulation wound heal immune response infection microbicidal action direct toward various organism . In airway , NO consider play key role innate immune system first-line host defense microbe build . The beneficial effect NO show different disease several option dos regimens ; newborn primary pulmonary hypertension show improvement oxygenation 30 minute NO treatment 10-20 ppm , subject adult respiratory distress syndrome demonstrate clinical improvement NO treatment 18 36 ppm . In vitro study suggest NO , part per million ( ppm ) concentration , possess antimicrobial anti-viral activity wide variety phylum include bacteria , virus , helminthes parasite . Safety tolerability 160 ppm NO give intermittently via inhalation show phase II study perform 2-12 month infant hospitalize bronchiolitis . According data difference proportion adverse event serious adverse event detect subject treat NO subject treat standard supportive treatment . In study investigator wish ass efficacy 160 ppm NO give intermittently via inhalation 0-12 months-old infant hospitalize due acute bronchiolitis . Primary objective : Asses difference hospital Length Stay ( LOS ) subject treated 160 ppm NO combined standard supportive treatment subject treat standard supportive treatment . Secondary objective : Asses difference time require achieve clinical improvement , clinical score ≤5 ( Modified Tal score ) subject treated 160 ppm NO combined standard supportive treatment subject treat standard supportive treatment . Assess difference time require achieve sustain 92 % oxygen saturation room air subject treat 160 ppm NO combined standard supportive treatment subject treat standard supportive treatment . Characterize safety tolerability 160 ppm NO intermittent inhalation treatment measure rate adverse event . In prospective double-blind , randomize multi-Center study investigator enroll 120 ( less 80 ) subject age 0-12 months-old , diagnosed acute bronchiolitis require in-patient hospitalization . Enrolled subject randomize 2 group . Group 1 -Treatment group - Will receive 160 ppm NO give intermittent via inhalation addition standard treatment 5 day . Group 2 - receive ongoing inhalation standard treatment 5 day . Between study complete study inhalation subject continue receive standard treatment . Oxygen ( O2 ) , NO , nitrogen dioxide ( NO2 ) fraction inspire oxygen ( FiO2 ) deliver patient continuously monitor . Treatment administration : Treatment blindness keep separate un-blinded team member ( give actual treatment ) blind team member , hide NO container study relate equipment behind curtain . All subject return follow-up visit day 14 ( +5 ) , 21 ( +5 ) day contact day 30 ( +5 ) day admission department .</brief_summary>
