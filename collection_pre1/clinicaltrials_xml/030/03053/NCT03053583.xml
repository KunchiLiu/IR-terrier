	<brief_title>Comparison Classical Miller , Wis-Hipple C-MAC Size 1 Blades</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This prospective , randomize , blind study . The primary objective compare straight blade obtain best glottic view child . The secondary objective determine subjective ease laryngoscopy intubation , desaturation complication blade compare view CMAC photo direct view CMAC blade . In study , investigator compare three different straight blade use pediatric anesthesia : Miller blade size 1 , Wis-Hipple blade size 1 , C-MAC straight blade size 1 . The sample size estimate equivalence study assume alpha two-tailed 0.05 , beta 0.2 , proportion POGO score &gt; 80 Miller blade ( base result previous study ) 0.64 estimate proportion 0.74 Wis-Hipple blade present study . The hypothesized difference require reject equivalence ≥ 0.2 . This require 29 child per group . To account un-interpretable photo , plan enroll 10 % 32 child group give total 96 child . Ninety-six child eligible participate randomize allocated one three study group consent obtain parents/ guardian regular anesthesia pre-operative evaluation . According randomization child assign one three group : Group A- Laryngoscopy classical Miller blade , size 1 Group B- Laryngoscopy Wis-Hipple blade , size 1 Group C- Laryngoscopy C-MAC Miller blade , size 1 . After induction general anesthesia , anesthesiologist perform either direct laryngoscopy use Classical Miller , Wis-Hipple C-MAC blade indirect laryngoscopy use C-MAC video straight blade . Photography best glottic view take direct laryngoscopy image best glottic view save C-MAC . At conclusion study , photograph 96 patient convert quality image standardize use Adobe Photoshop appear similar two blind anesthesiologist also unaware study hypothesis . Recruitment Procedure There recruitment advance . During pre-anesthesia assessment patient need undergo surgery general anesthesia screen inclusion exclusion criterion study . The parents/ guardian inform study , objective , purpose , risk benefit . Consenting Procedure The consent participate study obtain parents/ guardian pre-anesthesia assessment child hold area . Privacy confidentiality assure . Randomization Procedure After obtain consent child assign random serial number . Randomization prepare use random number table person involve study study begin . Accordingly patient allocate study group depend upon match number . Research Procedure 1 . Induction General anesthesia ASA standard monitor apply prior induction anesthesia . General anesthesia child induce face mask use 70 % N20 O2 8 % Sevoflurane fresh gas flow 8 L/min . After loss eyelash reflex peripheral intravenous catheter place . Propofol 2-3 mg/kg Rocuronium 0.5 mg/kg give . After achievement adequate anesthesia depth preoxygenation laryngoscopy perform . 2 . Laryngoscopy Photography The laryngoscopy technique choose accord randomization . In `` group A '' anesthesiologist use size 1 classical Miller blade direct laryngoscopy . The blade place epiglottis photo take second anesthesiologist use high-quality digital camera obtain best glottic view . Then tracheal intubation perform . In `` group B '' size 1 Wis-Hipple blade use direct laryngoscopy manner . In `` group C '' size 1 C-MAC straight blade indirect videolaryngoscopy use . The blade also place epiglottis photo direct view C-MAC take . In group C second anesthesiologist save image best glottic view SD card C-MAC monitor . The oxygen saturation , blood pressure heart rate record begin laryngoscopy completion intubation . Time laryngoscopy intubation record use stopwatch . These data record second anesthesiologist also take photograph glottic opening . With technique time intubation prolong result participate study . Even though take photo glottic opening laryngoscopy routine practice expect significant delay intubation laryngoscopy . 3 . Computer Editing Adobe Photoshop edit image perform collect data conclusion study . The image crop present glottic view without blade . The image quality color approximate ensure image two different camera ( digital camera C-MAC camera ) similar . 4 . Image grade POGO Cormack- Lehane scale Two anesthesiologist involve study blind study together . They review image randomize de-identified grade POGO score . 5 . Subjective evaluation blade There 4 anesthesiologist perform laryngoscopies . Each patient undergo one laryngoscopy tracheal intubation one anesthesiologist . After intubation , anesthesiologist perform laryngoscopy intubation rate difficulty laryngoscopy intubation visual analogue scale 0-10 ( 0 represent easy &amp; 10 difficult laryngoscopy/ intubation ) . This evaluation do time electronic record complete interfere patient care . Data Collection Storage The investigator use specially design data collection sheet . General information , demographic data , vital sign procedure data record . The general information include patient 's hospital ID label , subject serial number , subject randomization group , procedure date time . The demographic data include gender , age , weight , height , ASA class , type surgery . The procedure data section include time mask induction IV medication administration , ease laryngoscopy , ease intubation complication . The investigator use either C-MAC monitor free standing high definition photo camera depend randomization group . Each photo save SD memory card procedure transfer Principal Investigator 's computer save subject serial number . At completion data collection 96 subject image edit present blinded anesthesiologist score image POGO Cormack Lehane classification . The data collection sheet keep principal investigator lock file lock anesthesia office . The image store principal investigator 's computer password secure . The data store 3 year completion study primary investigator alone . All data treat accord HIPAA practice . All collect data study de-identified privacy protection . It store use unique study case number , direct patient identifier . Data Analysis For primary hypothesis study , POGO score Miller , Wis-Hipple size 1 blade C-MAC lift epiglottis , compare use Kruskall Wallis test . For secondary hypothesis , POGO score C-MAC 1 Miller blade lift epiglottis compare photo larynx take lip use Wilcoxon pair rank sum test . Data whose distribution deviate normality ( base Kolmogorov Smirnov test ) present median range analyze use test . Data normally distribute present mean standard deviation , analyze use Student 's test one-way ANOVA ( Scheffe test ) appropriate . P &lt; 0.05 two tail accept . Data analyze intention treat basis . Data Safety Monitoring Plan The safety research participant integrity data carefully monitor multiple level . The PI highly involved aspect protocol assume ultimate responsibility safety well-being research participant integrity data collect . The PI meet member study staff ensure aware procedure clarify question protocol initiation study . A record training session keep study repository . Quality control participant safety also ensure via monthly supervision research clinical staff PI . During meeting research staff discus status research project review protocol , consent , safety issue rise , additional issue ensure reportable information receive immediate appropriate action . Each meeting document log store study repository .</detailed_description>
