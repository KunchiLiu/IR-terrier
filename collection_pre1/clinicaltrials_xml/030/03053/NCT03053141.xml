	<detailed_description>The Rhythmia Mapping System design electroanatomical mapping catheter ablation procedure optimize need speed accuracy . The system able simultaneously acquire data multiple electrode . In addition , base user-defined criterion , system able efficiently acquire data multiple cardiac beat . When used conjunction Rhythmia Mapping Catheter , system able acquire hundred point per minute lead fast detailed map creation . Since market release , physicians user gain experience Boston Scientific Rhythmia Mapping System human clinical setting . Improvements first generation system development include new improve software feature map algorithms enhance clinical operation . These new improve software feature algorithms require leverage clinical use data part development iteration process . This study evaluate performance potential next-generation software feature low-risk clinical environment stream raw signal commercial Rhythmia Workstation standard care cardiac mapping ablation treatment tachyarrhythmias , specifically atrial fibrillation , atrial tachycardia , ventricular tachycardia . The data evaluate parallel investigational Rhythmia Workstation use prototype software feature . These next-generation software feature algorithms available physician case therefore diagnostic therapeutic impact clinical case .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>1 . Age 18 , legal age willing capable give informed consent specific national law 2 . Scheduled standard care catheterbased endocardial mapping atrial ventricular tachyarrhythmias use commercial Rhythmia Mapping System . 1 . Prothrombotic bleeding tendency due coagulopathy blood dyscrasia 2 . Inability tolerate heparin therapy ( e.g . heparin induce thrombocytopenia , allergy , etc . ) 3 . Prosthetic stenotic valve chamber intend mapping occur , path catheter access route 4 . Active systemic infection sepsis 5 . Hemodynamic instability shock baseline preclude ablation assessment investigator . 6 . Presence intracardiac thrombus , tumor , abnormality precludes catheter introduction 7 . Women pregnant lactate 8 . Cardiac surgery within past 90 day 9 . Acute myocardial infarction within 3 month 10 . Stable/unstable angina ongoing myocardial ischemia 11 . Subjects active heart failure decompensation 12 . Long QT Syndrome , Brugada Syndrome , Torsade de Pointes 13 . Congenital heart disease without corrective surgery would complicate mapping procedure 14 . Subjects untreatable allergy contrast medium 15 . Vascular pathology tortuosity preclude standard vascular access technique 16 . Subjects currently enrol another investigational study registry would directly interfere current study , except patient participate mandatory governmental registry , purely observational registry associate treatment . Each instance bring attention sponsor determine eligibility .</criteria>
