	<brief_summary>Spinal cord injury anatomically mostly incomplete , show tissue bridge spinal cord injury site . Of 60 % functionally incomplete patient , half face life wheelchair . Besides conventional rehabilitation , prominsing treatment option exist . One plastic system involve locomotion pontomedullary reticulospinal tract , old locomotor command system exist vertebrate , include primate . Muscle activation pattern limb movement program spinal cord activate coordinated command call mesencephalic locomotor region ( MLR ) . The MLR consist nerve cell low mesencephalic tegmentum send uni- bilateral signal medullary reticulospinal tract . Classical physiological study show electrical stimulation MLR induce locomotion . For first time approach transfer recently publish model induce incomplete spinal cord injury Schwab group . Rats severly impaired motor hindlimb control 10-20 % spar white matter , recover fully functional weight bear locomotion MLR deep brain stimulation ( DBS ) . Even rat 2-10 % spared white matter regain weight support stepping . DBS clinical standard treatment option patient movement disorder relieve symptom . Therefore , small study MLR stimulation safely use Parkinsonian patient show freeze gait frequent fall variable result . In translational approach , aim perform multidisciplinary phase one clinical trial 5 patient incomplete spinal cord injury . With mean establish universitary setup DBS treatment operation perform unilaterally local anaesthesia Division Neurosurgery , USZ , perioperative electrophysiological recording , clinical assessment gait analysis test stimulation Spinal Cord Injury Center Balgrist .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Deep Brain Stimulation Patients With Incomplete Spinal Cord Injury Improvement Gait</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>After approval local ethic committee perform phase I open-label trial evaluate safety preliminary efficacy unilateral deep brain stimulation mesencephalic locomotor region patient incomplete spinal cord injury . Male female subject ( 18-75 year-old ) complete in-patient rehabilitation enrol screen evaluation minimum 5 month post-injury . DBS operation perform minimum 6 month post-injury . Primary endpoint improvement posture locomotion determine functional test validate spinal cord injury trial , 6 Minute Walk Test , Timed Up Go Test , Spinal cord independence Measure ( SCIM III ) , Walking Index Spinal Cord Injury ( WISCI II ) . Secondary endpoint electrophysiological image base characterization mesencephalic locomotor region , questionnaire based/ professional assessment quality life , pain , micturition , sleep behavior , cognitive function psychiatric evaluation ( mood , anxiety , impulse control , delusional affective disorder ) . The study population consist 5 subject study period patient 1 year postoperatively . Briefly , candidate subject , able stand walker 2 crutch stable neurological condition meet inclusion none exclusion criterion . Subjects preoperative examination ( e.g . MRI scan head spine , neuropsychological , psychiatric sleep status etc . ) accord standard protocol DBS movement disorder , especially Parkinson 's disease , base certification criterion Highly-Specialized-Medicine DBS center Switzerland . Furthermore , investigational preoperative 7 Tesla MRI part protocol precise depiction brainstem anatomy . Neurological assessment spinal cord injury impairment define study protocol perform University Hospital Balgrist . The operation perform Division Neurosurgeon neurosurgical PI study : awake subject head fix stereotactic ring local anesthesia high resolution head scan perform define stereotactic space target anatomical landmark define individual MRI describe literature . In contrast bilateral implantation Parkinsonian patient , , single burr hole open local anesthesia contralateral side bad low extremity subject . Microelectrode record single-cells well local field potential map start 1 cm prior MLR target . Four state analyse : resting state , imagination walking , passive active low limb movement . These recording help determine place stimulation next step surgery . Here , slow increase stimulation amplitude constant frequency 50Hz applied determine activation lower limb muscle activity electroneuromyographic recording detection possible amelioration intend active movement bedside low limb trainer . Since subject awake , possible side effect professionally monitor site stimulation amplitude . Next , electrode record stimulation exchange standard quadripolar DBS electrode Parkinson 's disease patient ( 1.27 mm diameter , 1.5mm length contact 0.5 mm space ) use fluoroscopy . It fix skull externalize distally temporary extension subgaleal tunnel finally suture skin . All subject receive intraoperative head scan verify correct placement accuracy . If refinement necessary , first operative procedure regard finish subject transfer intermediate care unit overnight recover surgery . The subject mobilize day 1 3 sleep laboratory recording perform . Meanwhile stimulation setting test close interdisciplinary approach PI neurological team determine best parameter balance effect possible side effect . Neurological assessment University Hospital Balgrist go take place day 4 9 . In case improvement posture gait second surgery take place around 10th postoperative day general anesthesia placement internal extension cable connect electrode single channel pulse generator . Otherwise , electrode remove . Subjects fully implant DBS undergo regular assessment day 14 ( discharge ) outpatient setup around day 30 post-surgery , well 3 , 6 12 month afterwards . Rehabilitative postoperative treatment assist use recently CE certificate award win FLOAT system ( `` Free Levitation Overground Active Training '' ) allow robotic multidirectional relief body weight exact gait/posture analysis .</detailed_description>
