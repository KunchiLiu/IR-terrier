	<detailed_description>Pelvic organ prolapse , POP , common health problem affect 40 % woman . The lifetime likelihood undergo least one incident pelvic organ prolapse surgery estimate approximately 13 % . The prevalence reoperation primary pelvic reconstructive surgery high around 30 % , study report figure 58 % . In early 1990s perception pelvic floor defect urinary incontinence woman start change significantly . The diagnostics management defect become independent uro-gynecological sub-specialization within gynaecology obstetrics , include among 4 basic sub-specializations recognize European Board College Obstetrics Gynecology . Surgical treatment indicate woman symptomatic POP conservative management fail decline . There indication repair asymptomatic POP isolated procedure surgical correction uncertain benefit add peri- post-operative risk . The objective treatment always aim restore quality life comfort . Very little known factor associate surgical failure . Studies identify variety risk factor : young age , high body mass index advance preoperative prolapse ( grade III-IV ) associate increase risk reoperation study , study prove hypothesis . One factor significantly influence result pelvic organ surgery presence pelvic floor injury . Injury musculus levator ani mainly affect result traditional vaginal wall repair , 60 % risk recurrence . In last year , attempt reduce recurrence improve outcome reconstructive surgery treatment pelvic organ prolapse , surgeon start use transvaginally introduce prosthetic material ( mesh ) . This type surgery significantly increase efficacy procedure ( anatomic cure rate 90 % ) , use associate risk complication ( vaginal erosion potential consecutive infection , granuloma , dyspareunia , vesico-vaginal fistula , chronic pain ) thereby potentially reduce patient quality life lead additional surgery . If mesh introduce sacrocolpopexy vaginal wall open , significant decrease mesh-related complication . Laparoscopic sacrocolpopexy consider gold standard management apical prolapse high long-term efficacy . According study patient poorer anatomical outcome traditional repair able enjoy quality life transvaginal mesh surgery laparoscopic sacrocolpopexy . Therefore investigator plan assess efficacy randomize trial three different surgical method ( Amreich-Richter procedure , transvaginal mesh laparoscopic sacrocolpopexy ) patient high risk recurrence ; i.e . patient advance pelvic organ prolapse ( least stage III ) prove injury pelvic floor muscle . Aims study : To evaluate basis prospective randomize trial clinical efficacy three different surgical procedure ( Amreich-Richter procedure , transvaginal mesh laparoscopic sacrocolpopexy ) woman advance pelvic organ prolapse prove pelvic floor muscle injury All patient undergo complete urogynecological investigation procedure ( history , clinical examination , assessment pelvic organ prolapse use POPQ system , examination levator rest tone contraction ( Oxford scale ) , appropriate urodynamics accord ICS recommendation ultrasound examination ) , fill standardize international questionnaire ( ICIQ-UI SF , PISQ 12 , UDI_POPDI-CRADI , POP-SF ) . Ultrasound examination perform combined examination use convex probe , abdominal perineal approach , sectoral vaginal probe introital approach . Investigation preserve mainly digital form partly videotape . Acquired data 4D imagery preserve form data set process appropriate software . Ultrasound examination ass standard parameter describe position urethrovesical junction , bladder descent , uterus descent , posterior vaginal wall descent ( rectocele , enterocele ) . Using 3D/4D ultrasound examination status pelvic floor evaluate ( presence avulsion puborectalis muscle , abnormal genital hiatus distension ) . Women randomize three group : 1 . Group - Laparoscopic sacrocolpopexy 2 . Group - Transvaginal mesh procedure 3 . Group - Amreich-Richter procedure ( traditional vaginal wall repair apical fixation sacrospinous ligament . All surgical procedure perform general , spinal epidural anesthesia indicate , antibiotic prophylaxis use . Surgery provide standardized step , see arm description . In early postoperative check-up 2-3 week surgery evaluation post-operative pain perform late post-operative complication de novo constipation , urinary retention , infection analyze . The next post-operative complete examination plan 3 month surgery ( examination procedure include clinical exam , ultrasound QoL ( ICIQ- SF , POP-SF , PISQ 12 , UDI_POPDI-CRADI , TS-VAS ) . The next visit provide one year two year surgery , procedure 3-month check-up . In addition pre-operative ultrasound examination position mesh monitor . All patient study minimum one year follow-up , whenever possible , two year follow-up . Postoperative follow-up terminate result surgery evaluate failure , case reoperation offer . Further post-operative follow-up five year also plan .</detailed_description>
