	<brief_summary>This single arm , single center phase II study adjuvant pembrolizumab N2 positive non-small cell lung cancer ( NSCLC ) patient treat neoadjuvant concurrent chemoradiotherapy follow curative resection . Patients receive pembrolizumab 200 mg every 3 week 24 month . The primary objective study assess efficacy adjuvant pembrolizumab treatment term disease-free survival ( DFS ; per Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors ( RECIST ) 1.1 assessed investigator ) . The baseline assessment part screening procedure perform within 0 14 day start study drug . The imaging modality use RECIST 1.1 assessment CT chest PET-CT indicated . Follow-up chest CT patient assess every 12 week first year , every 16 week second year , every 6 month third year , every year thereafter . In subject discontinue study therapy without documented recurrence , every effort make continue monitoring disease status . If unscheduled assessment perform , patient progress , every attempt make perform subsequent assessment schedule visit . RECIST 1.1 scan analyze investigator site ; central review conduct . Following completion discontinuation study drug , patient enter follow-up period . Once patient objective relapse record discontinue study drug , patient follow survival status every 3 month death , withdrawal consent end study . Patients also request provide tumor sample diagnostic ( obtain neoadjuvant CCRT ) surgical specimen exploratory biomarker study . Sample provision optional , subject specific consent .</brief_summary>
