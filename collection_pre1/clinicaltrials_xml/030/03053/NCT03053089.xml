	<detailed_description>Stage 1 : Stage one single-dose , dose-escalation study cohort 2 patient Hurler-Scheie Scheie syndrome age 18 great ERT least 7 day prior start treatment . Approximately 3 cohort enrol sequentially , safety data previous cohort review prior escalation next high dose cohort . Patients assign cohort basis order entry study . The first cohort administer single intravenous infusion 0.3 mg/kg AGT-181 dilute D5 normal saline 4 hour . All patient observe safety 28 day dose . For dose escalation , decision proceed high dose AGT-181 make Sponsor investigator ( ) review available safety tolerability data 7 day post dose patient receive previous dose . Dose escalation high dose cohort occur provide dose limit toxicity ( DLT ) , define Grade 3 ( severe medically significant immediately life threaten ) high adverse event accord Common Terminology Criteria Adverse Events ( CTCAE ) version 4.03 Stage 2 : Assuming safety tolerability Stage 1 , second stage initiate use multi-dose , safety , tolerability proof concept effect design child ( age 2 old ) Hurler Hurler-Scheie CNS involvement either ERT na√Øve receive ERT least 7 day prior first dose AGT-181 . This second stage study conduct dose group 5 patient per group receive AGT-181 ; plan 10 patient enrol ( 2 dose cohort ) . Additional patient cohort may enrol order evaluate specific safety PK issue felt active dose yet reach . If active dose achieve , additional cohort 5 patient enrol high dose AGT-181 , A maximum 15 patient enrol stage 2 . These cohort study staggered fashion safety efficacy data previous cohort review part decision commence treatment additional cohort . Patients assign cohort basis order entry study . The first cohort administer dose one level maximum tolerate ( MTD ) maximum administer dose ( MAD ) single dose stage 1 ( ie . MTD 3.0 mg/kg Stage 1 start dose stage 1.0 mg/kg ) . AGT-181 administered weekly intravenous infusion D5 normal saline 4 hour first eight infusion . Depending upon tolerability , rate may increase administer 1-4 hour . Investigators permit use clinical judgment standard protocols determine whether administer pre-infusion medication antihistamines antipyretic . In case patient previous infusion reaction ( ) ERT , premedication give prior infusion per clinical site standard protocol . For dose escalation , decision proceed high dose AGT-181 make Sponsor investigator ( ) review available safety tolerability data patient receive previous dose . Dose escalation high dose cohort occur provide dose limit toxicity ( DLT ) first 3 patient treat 28 day . If one patient 3 develops DLT , dose escalation may occur remain 2 patient complete 28 day dose DLTs . A DLT define Grade 3 ( severe medically significant immediately life threaten ) high adverse event accord Common Terminology Criteria Adverse Events ( CTCAE ) version 4.03 . If Grade 3 bad event clearly attributable non-treatment event therefore suspect adverse reaction : [ 21CFR312.32 ( ) ] ( example , trauma secondary accident , spurious lab value confirm repeat ) event consider DLT dose escalation purpose review agreement Sponsor 's Medical Monitor Principal Investigator . In addition adverse event occur first 28 day , late chronic toxicity evaluate take account determine safety dose level future study need additional cohort study .</detailed_description>
