	<brief_summary>Nowadays , endoscopic technique apply diagnose treat variety gastrointestinal disease , endoscopic submucosal dissection ( ESD ) endoscopic mucosal resection ( EMR ) technique remove early gastrointestinal mucosal cancer . Endoscopic procedure associate gastrointestinal perforation one severe complication , associate high morality need timely detection effective treatment clinical practice.Over 90 % procedure associate gastrointestinal perforation occur immediately within 24 h endoscopic procedure.Endoclips widely use closing immediate gastrointestinal perforation , location endoclips could influence effective rate , limit application . In addition , multiple endoclips place endoscopy relatively large perforation , could increase medical cost procedure time . At recent , new purse string suture device ( LeoMed , China ) develop u introduce clinicalmanagement patient procedure associate gastrointestinal perforation . Clinical data validate usage new purse string suture treat immediate procedure associate perforation greatly convenient effective low reoperation rate postoperative complication rate . A specially design loop equip device , could tighten endoscopy . Thus , compare placement endoclips , device could convenient effective completely close gastrointestinal perforations.This study test whether purse string suture device increase effectiveness closingimmediate procedure associate gastrointestinal perforationsunder endoscopyin randomize control trialby compare use purse string suture deviceand endoclips .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Purse String Suture Device vs. Endoclip Immediate Endoscopic Procedure Associated Gastrointestinal Perforation</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This randomize controlled trial comparing use purse string suture device versus endoclips close procedure associate gastrointestinal perforation endoscopy , one severe complication need timely treatment . Endoclips widely use close gastrointestinal perforation , location endoclips could significantly influence effective rate . In addition , multiple endoclips need relatively large perforation , could increase medical cost procedure time . At recent , new purse string suture device develop introduced clinicalmanagement patient gastrointestinal perforation . A loop equipped device , could tighten . Thus , compare endoclips , device could convenient effective completely close gastrointestinal perforation . This study test whether purse string suture device increase effectiveness treat procedure associate gastrointestinal perforation endoscopy randomize controlled trial .</detailed_description>
