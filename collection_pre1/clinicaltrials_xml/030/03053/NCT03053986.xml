	<brief_summary>Apple polyphenols mostly acknowledge hypoglycaemic property , represent apple active fraction many pharmacological function . The study aim examine effect uricemia endothelial function sample overweight subject . This two-phases study . The vitro experiment aim evaluate apple polyphenols ' ability lower uric acid comparison allopurinol . The vivo study consist randomize , double-blind , parallel placebo-controlled clinical trial involve 62 overweight volunteer suboptimal value fast plasma glucose ( 100 mg/dL≤FPG≤125 mg/dL ) , randomize treat 300 mg apple polyphenols placebo 8 week .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The study include 2-week run-in period diet standardization 8-week treatment period . At enrolment , patient give standard behavioural qualitative dietary suggestion correct unhealthy habit . In particular , subject strongly recommend follow general indication Mediterranean diet , avoid excessive intake diary red meat derive product reduce dietary excess , order maintain overall balance diet entire duration study . Individuals also encourage increase physical activity walk briskly cycle 3 5 time week , least 20 minute every time . The study fully comply ethical guideline Declaration Helsinki . The study protocol approve Ethical Committee University Bologna . All patient sign write informed consent participate . After 2 week diet standardization , enrolled subject allocate treatment indistinguishable pill placebo active product , contain 300 mg apple extract ( Malus Domestica ) glycosilated polyphenols ( ≥90 % ) include glycosilated phloritzin ( 15-30 % ) , chlorogenic acid ( 10-25 % ) quercetin ( 15-25 % ) ( kindly provide Amitalia Srl , Solara , MI , Italy ) . Patients ask take pill regularly , every day early morning . The amount glycosilated polyphenols assess spectophotometrically 280 nm , use synthetic catechin standard . Glycosilated phloritzin , chlorogenic acid quercetin measure HPCL-MS [ high performance liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry ] . The randomization perform 1:1 ratio block stratify sex age . An alphabetical code assign lot code ( correspond treatment placebo ) impress dose box . The study staff investigator , well volunteer , blind group assignment . Codes keep seal envelope , open end trial . Dose box mix blind dose box assign enrolled patient . Patients evaluate anamnestically execution physical examination laboratory analysis baseline , middle end trial . The hemodynamic variable record ( endothelial function , arterial stiffness related parameter ) investigate intervention period . All instrumental measurement carry follow standardized protocol specially trained staff .</detailed_description>
