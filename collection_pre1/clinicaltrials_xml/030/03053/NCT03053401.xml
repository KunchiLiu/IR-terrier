	<brief_title>Ultrasound Guided Adductor Canal Block Versus Femoral Nerve Block Anterior Cruciate Ligament Repair Pediatrics</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Motor preservation adequate analgesia become optimal postoperative goal orthopedic surgery , particular knee surgery . This enable early physical therapy , fast recovery short hospital stay . Both Ultrasound guide ACB FNB use provide postoperative analgesia knee surgery , include anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction . To investigator ' knowledge , comparison make block relation postoperative quadriceps muscle strength well duration quality postoperative analgesia arthroscopic ACL repair . ACB predominantly block sensory component femoral nerve without much effect motor component . Hence , lead less quadriceps muscle weakness , early postoperative mobilization decrease incidence postoperative fall . With advent ultrasonography , adductor canal easily visualize mid-thigh level , allow performance ACB high success rate . In recent year , ACB successfully use postoperative pain control knee surgery . Anatomical study adductor canal demonstrate adductor canal may serve conduit saphenous nerve , possibly include vastus medialis nerve , medial femoral cutaneous nerve , articular branch obturator nerve , well medial retinacular nerve . Thus , sensory change limit distribution saphenous nerve include medial anterior aspect knee superior pole patella proximal tibia.To investigator Knowledge randomize control study compare ACB FNB Arthroscopic Anterior Cruciate Ligament ( ACL ) repair . This prospective , double-blinded , randomize , control study test hypothesis ACB would associate less quadriceps motor weakness FNB 4 hour block performance . The investigator also hypothesize ACB provide analgesia inferior FNB different opioids usage 4 24 hour Peripheral Nerve Block ( PNB ) performance . - Hypothesis ACB would associate less quadriceps motor weakness FNB provide analgesia inferior FNB quality duration determine Numeric Scale ( NS ) pain score opioid use 4 24 hour PNB . - Objectives To compare FNB ACB regarding : 1 . Quadriceps muscle strength immediate pre-operative period 4 hour PNB performance . 2 . Pain score rest 4 hour 24 hour PNB assess Numeric Scale ( NS ) pain score system . 3 . Total opioid consumption 4 24 hour PNB . - Study Design : Randomized , double blind , single center clinical trial . A total 50 pediatric patient ( ASA 1or 2 ) , age 8 18 year , elective ACL repair Akron Children 's Hospital ( ACH ) enrol study . Patients randomly assign one two group , A B . Group A ( 25 patient ) ultrasound guide ACB perform mid-thigh level group B ( 25 patient ) ultrasound guide FNB , nerve stimulator confirmation type motor response ( e.g. , quadriceps , patellar ) minimum current need record . Both block perform general anesthesia . Both group ropivacaine 0.2 % ( 0.5 ml/kg , maximum 30 ml methylprednisolone acetate 1 mg/kg , maximum 40 mg ) .Both block perform use 22-gauge 2-inch Stimuplex A needle ; ; B. Braun Medical Inc. , Melsungen , Germany ) .Both block perform use linear ultrasound transducer , General Electric ( GE ) . Ultrasound picture obtain Verify proper local anesthetic placement.ACL repair , surgical procedure use study may always possible perform surgeon . The alternative ACL reconstruction , use hamstring graft . Post-operative pain related hamstring graft arise distribution sciatic nerve cover either ACB FNB require management IV /oral opioids . The potential increase opioids consumption pain score due sciatic nerve involvement may confound statistical analysis data therefore within scope aim study . The investigator decide therefore continue study procedure data collection ACL repair ACL reconstruction . However , improve accuracy study result , statistical analysis include patient undergo ACL repair . For patient undergo ACL reconstruction , investigator collect data include statistical analysis . The data patient may use pilot future research . Quadriceps strength leg assess place dynamometer anterior ankle , malleoli . Patients instructed extend legs three time , 30 second pause attempt describe Maffiuletti . The assessment perform pre-operative period repeat postoperatively 4 hour PNB . All patient observe post-operative period observer unaware technique analgesia use . Pain assess use NS . Postoperatively , PCA morphine pump attach patient . A load dose 0.05 mg/kg maximum 5 mg administer Post Anesthesia Care unit ( PACU ) need , follow demand interval dose 0.015 mg/kg every 10 minutes.as demand patient .Four-hours limit morphine set 0.35 mg/kg . No continuous infusion adjuvant NSAIDs acetaminophen administer . Rescue morphine dose order via PCA pump 0.05 mg/kg ( repeat need ) available every two hour need pain assessment ( NS ≥ 4 ) patient request . Diazepam 0.03 mg/kg IV available every 4 to6 hour need muscle spasm anxiety . Patients consider ready discharge hospital follow criterion meet : Child alert , orient , stable vital sign , would tolerate clear liquid , nausea vomit good pain control . The evaluation meeting discharge criterion do one hour arrival PACU every 30 minute thereafter till patient meet discharge criterion . After discharge , After discharge , parent instruct give child oxycodone tablets/elixir 0.1 mg /kg PO q 3 hour need pain . In addition , acetaminophen 10mg/kg q 4 hour PRN and/or ibuprofen 10 mg/kg q 6 hour PRN maximum 2400 mg/24 hour , may administer residual pain . The total dose oxycodone , ibuprofen tylenol record per parent total 24 hour PNB . Pain score also record parent rest,24 hour post -block . The data total opioids use first 24 hour PNB Pain score 24 hour collect parent phone call . - Study Endpoints 1-Quadriceps muscle strength pre-operatively 4 PNB 2- Total morphine/morphine equivalent 4 24 hour PNB . 3-Pain score via NS 4 24 hour PNB . - Method Assigning Subjects Treatment Regimen Random allocation one two treatment achieve use seal envelope assign external third party involve study ensure allocation concealment . - Study Monitoring Plan This study monitor data monitoring committee . The study perform period 18-24 month . This study offer minimal risk patient . The data monitoring committee include PI , least one co-investigators , principal statistician , principal research nurse . The data monitoring committee meet approximately 25 % , 50 % , 75 % 100 % primary outcomes observe . The priority data monitoring committee ensure safety participant trial ensure integrity trial . Also , meeting monitor quality collect data ass weaknesses error . If weakness and/or error identify , feedback provide meeting .The investigator ( ) allocate adequate time monitoring activity . The investigator ( ) also ensure monitor compliance quality assurance reviewer give access note study-related document . -Summary Statistics : Will provide variable . Examination continuous data include normality test well assessment potential outlier . Statistical test base upon distributional shape , purpose analytical plan sample size analysis normality distribution assume . To examine potential difference quadriceps motor strength ( QMS ) two group ( ACB , FNB ) , two change score create analyzed via T-Test Equal Unequal Variances appropriate Bonferroni adjust alpha test pair difference two distinctive time point . Assuming statistically significant baseline difference two group QMS Change score ) Baseline 4 hour . Sample size analysis base upon test QMS Change score . Non-inferiority ACB FNB analgesia provide assessed examination pain score . Non-inferiority ACB compare FNB define mean ACB - NRS pain score high mean FNB - NRS pain score amount 1.6 . ( Kim , 2014 ) Pain score individually examine 4 hour 24 hour post - operative time point appropriate Bonferroni adjust alpha . In addition , change pain score 4 24 hour create evaluate potential difference group . Total opioid consumption measure morphine equivalent assess 24 hour post-operative time point determine whether difference exists . Opioid consumption also examine create change score 4 24 hour consumption compare group . All test complete utilizing SAS 9.4 © software evaluate Type I Error Rate alpha = 0.05 level statistical significance unless otherwise note .</detailed_description>
