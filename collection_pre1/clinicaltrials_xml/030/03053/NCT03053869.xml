	<brief_title>Benzodiazepine-free Anesthetic Reduction Delirium ( B-Free )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>ICU data suggest benzodiazepine link delirium , minimize use incorporate ICU practice guideline . Cardiac surgery patient elevate risk delirium . However , benzodiazepine administration still constitute common part cardiac anesthesia practice , relate previous absence alternate medication technique ensure hemodynamic stability prevent intraoperative awareness . However , advent new medication process EEG monitoring , benzodiazepine use longer ubiquitous , utilization dose varying among practitioner . These multiple approach cardiac anesthesia care haphazard , speak clinical equipoise . As , investigator decide standardize approach cardiac anesthesia care , evaluate impact change approach postoperative delirium , serious problem individual patient health care system . Studying strategy care impact delirium : There great need understand strategy limitation intraoperative benzodiazepine use cardiac surgery reduce postoperative delirium . Cardiac surgery do specialized institution perform high volume surgery order reduce complication , increase efficiency , obtain superior outcome . The surgical care patient high volume cardiac surgery centre undertaken use standardized procedure optimize outcome . The investigator would like determine policy limit use intra-operative benzodiazepine reduce postoperative delirium , question ask perspective clinical effectiveness . The way answer question randomize two institutional approach benzodiazepine use : policy standard use patient compare policy limit benzodiazepine use select patient . The cluster randomize trial methodologic approach design test different institutional policy . In cluster crossover trial , institution randomize use one policy , treatment suitable wash-out period , institution cross policy . This approach methodologically rigorous test effect change practice would actually used clinical setting . Therefore , optimal approach answer question intraoperative benzodiazepine strategy cluster crossover trial , randomize cardiac surgery centre two standard approach intraoperative benzodiazepine use , crossover within site . An institutional policy limit intraoperative benzodiazepine use adult cardiac surgery , compare policy 'ad libitum ' intraoperative benzodiazepine use , reduce rate post-operative delirium . Our goal undertake randomized cluster crossover trial , randomization level hospital . Before trial conduct , need establish feasibility . We therefore propose undertake pilot study single hospital , establish feasibility trial protocol . This pilot trial conduct approximately 6 month , 4 study period . Because variation number procedure perform within give month , duration period determine amount time require manage 120 patient accord select policy . There 1-week washout period study period enable staff transition institutional policy cardiac anesthesia care . At outset study , randomize pilot site 2 possible alternate sequence benzodiazepine-minimized ( A ) routine benzodiazepine administration ( B ) ( i.e . ABAB BABA ) . We call study B-free Pilot Trial . We use data pilot large study unless substantial protocol modification need . Rationale : At least 1 CAM assessment require assess primary outcome large trial , one CAM per ICU ideal ass delirium ( fluctuate course ) . Protocol compliance individual practitioner 80 % patient administer intraoperative benzodiazepine benzodiazepine minimization period , 80 % patient receive intraoperative benzodiazepine ad libitum benzodiazepine period . This correspond 192/240 patient treat per protocol within treatment arm . Rationale : In trial compare two different institutional policy . However , reality , anesthesiologists individual may make individual patient management decision . In addition , concrete reason patient treat accord one policy . We thus use pilot study evaluate proportion patient manage accord policy use give crossover period order certain , large trial , significant difference benzodiazepine administration two period . Incidence intraoperative awareness 2 % benzodiazepine minimization period ( i.e . 5/240 patient ) . This define recall intraoperative event , ascertain use standardized questionnaire widely use research clinical practice ascertain patient awareness ( see Appendix I : Procedure Assessment Intraoperative Awareness ) . Rationale : There historical belief benzodiazepine decrease risk intraoperative awareness , even though evidence support belief.2,4,5 Given ( 1 ) evidence support preventative effect benzodiazepine intraoperative awareness ( 2 ) assessment awareness routine part clinical practice sit Canada , would like establish rate intraoperative awareness patient treat benzodiazepine minimization period high upper boundary 95th percent confidence interval pool incidence report three large , recent study ( i.e . 2 % ) . Achievement objective pilot study justify formally assess intraoperative awareness sit multi-centre trial . Relationship incidence postoperative delirium hospital-collected , administrative data Canadian Institute Health Information ( CIHI ) data â‰¥ 85 % . This define incidence postoperative delirium CIHI discharge abstract database divide incidence postoperative delirium report hospital administrative data . Rationale : We believe incidence postoperative delirium reliably accurately record hospital-collected administrative data , use CAM . However , collect outcome delirium use data source work-intensive costly collect outcome delirium use CIHI discharge abstract database , believe underrepresent true incidence postoperative delirium . As , collect data source pilot trial . If report incidence postoperative delirium CIHI discharge abstract database least 85 % report hospital administrative data , use primary data source large trial ( modify secondary outcome duration delirium , ICU LOS , hospital LOS ensure reflect data field collect CIHI ) . If threshold exceed , obtain extra funding human resource require local data collection large trial .</detailed_description>
