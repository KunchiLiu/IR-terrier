	<detailed_description>10.1 Overall Study Design Plan : Description This phase Ib , open-label , single-arm , single-center study conduct Canada . Subjects NMIBC ( Non-muscle Invasive Bladder Cancer , Ta , T1 , and/or Tis ) candidate refuse radical cystectomy eligible participation study . BCG intolerance refractory disease define inability tolerate failure achieve tumour-free state least one induction ( minimum 5 instillation ) follow either second induction ( minimum 5 instillation ) least 2 maintenance instillation . Subjects experience disease relapse within 12 month less finishing second course BCG therapy also consider refractory . The study consist 2 phase . In first phase , 3 subject receive PDT employ 0.35 mg/cm^2 ( maximum recommend start dose ) TLD1433 90 J/cm^2 green light deliver TLC-3200 . If treatment maximum recommend start dose raise significant safety concern determine safety monitoring committee , additional 6 subject receive PDT 0.70 mg/cm^2 ( therapeutic dose ) TLD1433 90 J/cm^2 green light deliver TLC-3200 . 10.2 Screening Period Subjects qualify study entry review inclusion exclusion criterion Screening Period , last 2 week . 10.3 Maximum Recommended Starting Dose Treatment Phase Three subject receive single instillation 0.35 mg/cm^2 TLD1433 follow PDT ( TLC-3200 System ) . If treatment maximum recommend start dose n't raise safety concern 1 month patient follow-up base judgment safety monitoring committee , study enroll additional 3 subject receive PDT maximum recommend start dose . 10.4 Follow-Up Phase All subject enrol , regardless TLD1433 dose receive , follow End Study define completion require assessment 6 month follow-up earlier due early discontinuation withdrawal inform consent . During Follow-Up Phase , information safety efficacy collect . Assessments conduct Day 7 , Day 30 monthly thereafter Month 3 , every 3 month End Study . 10.6 Study Drug PDT Administration TLD1433 intravesical administration supply lyophilizate suspension Sterile Water Injection bladder package dark amber borosilicate glass vial store room temperature . Just administration , reconstitute Sterile Water Injection obtain final clinical dilution . TLD1433 supply Theralase Inc. Instillations do immediately follow biopsy take TURBT . Investigators must wait minimum 7 day dose subject TURBT/biopsy and/or bladder wall integrity issue resolve . Dose/volume reduction allow study . Upon determination bladder volume ( screening period ) void diary measuring instilled water volume , TLD1433 dilute proper concentration . On day 0 ( treatment day ) , subject ask restrict fluid intake 12 hour study drug instillation . Study drug must instill subject 's empty bladder . Before instillation , regular transurethral catheter insert bladder drain . A single instillation TLD1433 infuse intravesically 60 min ( TLD1433 instill case leakage ) , follow 3 wash sterile water . Bladder distend use fourth instillation sterile water prevent fold prevent uniform light illumination . The laser technician worksheet must complete procedure data must promptly transfer correspond eCRF page . The optical fiber ( spherical diffuser ) position center bladder aid TLC-3200 lock place use endoscope holder continuous irradiation total exposure time . Exposure time calculate base power ( measured end optic fiber insert though liquid-tight lock via catheter urethra ) bladder surface area match desire light dose bladder wall . Green laser light ( wavelength = 532 nm , energy = 90 J/cm^2 ) irradiate use spherical cavity diffuser . 10.6.1 Dosing Schedule A single whole bladder intravesical PDT TLD1433 TLC-3200 System plan . 10.6.2 PDT Disruption Only patient papillary tumour remain TURBT treat protocol . If one papillary tumour see time cystoscopy laser light application ( maximum 6 week TURBT ) , patient must treat TLC-3200 System schedule , even though previously instill TLD1433 . Procedures follow though tumour first detect 90-day follow-up evaluation . The patient may treat whatever manner physician deems appropriate . However , patient must follow collection safety information least 30 day TLD1433 instillation , even though alternate therapy may initiate time . Adverse experience , weekly assessment urinary symptom , result laboratory test blood urine record . Full disclosure detail alternate therapy medication give 30-day observation period ( e.g. , drug , dose , route , frequency date administration ) must provide . After 30-day period , interim medical history take patient undergo physical examination ( include ECG ) , clinical laboratory test , Karnofsky Performance Status rating , assessment urinary symptom adverse experience . The patient consider study .</detailed_description>
