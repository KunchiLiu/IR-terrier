	<detailed_description>Inflammatory bowel disease ( IBD ) , include ulcerative colitis ( UC ) Crohn 's disease ( CD ) , chronic relapse inflammatory condition gastrointestinal tract . IBD think result complex interaction genetic , immune , microbial environmental factor . The role vitamin D bone health calcium homeostasis well document . However , emerge data suggests vitamin D may also regulate immune response , may play role pathogenesis disease activity IBD . The investigator seek identify CD UC patient mild disease clinical remission vitamin D level &lt; 30 ng/ml type vitamin repletion therapy . The investigator randomize participant one four arm : ( 1 ) Oral 50,000 vitamin D IU every week 12 week ( 2 ) Oral 50,000 vitamin D weekly 12 week oral 800 vitamin D IU/d ( 3 ) Oral 50,000 vitamin D IU weekly 12 week 5,000 vitamin D IU/d ( 4 ) Oral 5,000 vitamin D IU/d check vitamin D level inflammatory marker part standard care follow- every 3 month nine month . Every participant receive dietary counseling throughout study duration . Our aim identify optimal dose strategy repletion maintenance vitamin D level subset IBD patient . Based clinical experience , dose high recommended dos bone health need achieve maintain optimal level Vitamin D IBD patient , even patient remission small bowel ( malabsorption ) involvement .</detailed_description>
