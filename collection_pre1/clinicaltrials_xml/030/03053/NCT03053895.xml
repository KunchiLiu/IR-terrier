	<detailed_description>DECIDE ( Bedside versus Operating Room Burr-Hole DrainagE ChronIc SubDural HEmatoma ) Background Significance : Chronic subdural hematoma ( CSDH ) abnormal collection liquefy blood product dura arachnoid membrane brain may cause brain tissue compression subsequent neurological sequela . One common risk factor contribute CSDH head trauma , usually form minor head injury . Older individual increase risk CSDH due brain atrophy occur advance age well tendency fall sustain minor head trauma . Chronic alcoholic also increase risk alcoholism lead globalize brain atrophy , increase risk fall , hepatogenic coagulopathy . Coagulopathies include use anticoagulant , antithrombotics , antiplatelets certain health condition common risk factor CSDH . Study Aims : The primary aim study conduct high-quality randomize trial compare safety effectiveness bedside operating room burr-hole drainage CSDH . The main objective study demonstrate effectiveness bedside drainage safety bypass perioperative risk associate anesthetic especially among elderly . The ultimate goal study standardize bedside drainage treatment choice CSDH management . Primary Objective : To assess efficacy bedside drainage compare operating room burr-hole evacuation CSDH management examine hypothesis bedside associate low recurrence rate . Secondary Objectives : To examine bedside drainage operate room burr-hole drainage efficacious term functional outcome . To evaluate hypothesis bedside drainage safer compare operating room burr-hole drainage measure mortality morbidity . Overall study design : Multi-centered pragmatic randomize control trial across North America ( USA Canada ) compare bedside drainage operate room burr-hole drainage CSDH . Duration : Over 3 year study period , patient follow 6 month measure study outcomes . Study population : The study population include 486 eligible patient &gt; 18 year age confirm diagnosis symptomatic CSDH ( 243 patient per arm ) . Inclusion Criteria : Patients age &gt; 18 year present symptomatic CSDH confirm diagnostic imaging , able provide inform consent legal representative available unable . Main intervention comparator ( ) : Patients randomly assign two arm study , bedside operating room burr-hole drainage . For patient randomize bedside drainage CSDH , twist-drill procedure conduct patient 's bedside use local anesthetic . For patient randomize burr-hole drainage , procedure perform operating room local general anesthesia base surgeon 's anesthesiologist 's judgement clinical stability patient . Randomization via www.randomize.net website stratify center patient age variable unspecified block size . Follow-Up Post-Randomization : Patients randomize follow study outcome day 1 , 2 , discharge , month 1 , 3 6 . Primary Outcome : The efficacy comparative surgical procedure measure recurrence rate CSDH within 6 month initial CSDH drainage . Secondary Functional Outcomes : Postoperative neurological functional status patient measure use Markwalder Grading System ( MGS ) , Glasgow Outcome Score ( GOS ) , modify Rankin Scale ( MRS ) . Secondary Safety Outcomes : The safety procedure measure term mortality morbidity include surgical site infection , misplacement postoperative subdural drain , tension pneumocephalus , new intracranial hemorrhage , medical complication . Sample Size : Sample size estimation base Chi-squared two-sided test null hypothesis bedside drainage different burr-hole drainage reduce proportion patient experience hematoma recurrence within 6 month drainage procedure . Including possible attrition rate 10 % total 486 patient ( 243 per arm ) require detect difference recurrence rate 7 % risk ratio 0.36 ( 11 % burr-hole group 4 % bedside drainage group ) , power 80 % level significance set alpha=0.05 . Primary Analysis : Primary analysis intention-to-treat data analyst blind participant allocation . Interim Analyses : Interim analyse conduct upon recruitment 25 % expect sample size ( 122 patient ) assess recruitment rate , recurrence rate safety outcomes . This trial important ongoing search efficient safe intervention strategy .</detailed_description>
