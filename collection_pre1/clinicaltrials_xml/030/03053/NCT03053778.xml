	<brief_title>The Heart Valve Clinic Study</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The incidence valvular heart disease estimate exceed 42 million people worldwide . In Denmark 1700 patient undergo heart valve surgery every year number increase due age population . The common heart valve diseases aortic stenosis , follow mitral regurgitation aortic regurgitation , whereas patient treat Denmark mitral stenosis primary tricuspid valve pulmonic valve disease . Heart valve surgery lifesaving procedure patient severe symptomatic heart valve disease , complication heart valve surgery common readmission frequent rate exceed 40 % Denmark . Most frequent cause readmission , include new onset atrial fibrillation , pleural pericardial effusion , infection acute heart failure . These cause potentially detect careful outpatient follow-up order avoid unplanned readmission , improve mental , physical social health outcome . A recent Danish study demonstrate 56 % surgical heart valve patient readmitted within year readmission associate low psychical mental PROs . PROs ' include validated patient health status survey allow quantification critical patient-centered outcome . Further previous study suggest association PROs prolong hospital stay , morbidity mortality cardiac patient . Knowledge PROs potentially use identify patient especially may benefit intensified follow-up heart valve surgery . Existing guideline recommend patient follow valve surgery review regular basis cardiologist special knowledge heart valve disease . A recent European study demonstrate though , gap exist guideline clinical practice . A plausible way improve postoperative care could introduce multidisciplinary heart valve clinic ( HVC ) , specialized nurse educate patient intervene support patient surgery collaboration cardiologist surgeon . This proven efficient improve outcome , mortality , readmission quality life patient heart failure.3 A multidisciplinary teamwork provide timely access clinical review patient simultaneously look sign symptom valve dysfunction.18 Although , previous study describe HVCs . Although , previous study describe HVCs , effect gain HVC compare usual care readmission , mortality , cost-utility patient-reported outcome yet systematically investigate . The aim study firstly describe PROs heart valve surgery , incorporate knowledge structure intervention , secondly evaluate HVC association PRO 's , readmission , mortality cost-utility . The study consist two part , - Matched cohort study compare HVC historical control group evaluate effect HVC readmission , mortality HRQoL . - A health economic analysis effect HVC compare historical control Group . The intervention collection clinical data : Introducing HVC gain knowledge effect readmission , mortality health economics . Preoperative : Clinical data regard patient gather admission include calculate Euroscore II , pulmonary function measure spirometry , status nutrition , smoke alcohol consumption , BMI , electrocardiography ( ECG ) , recent echocardiography . Furthermore , patient ' frailty status assess gait speed test day surgery use risk model . Postoperative : Before discharge train cardiac nurse perform screen pleural pericardial effusion , volume overload , risk atrial fibrillation repeat frailty assessment . Before discharge patient ' medication evaluate adapted accord clinical status , patient educate warn sign surgery . The surgical status evaluate discharge . Based data PROs patient ' follow-up individualized . Follow-up : The specific follow-up plan accord patient ' status patient consider high risk readmitted base clinical evaluation discharge ( e.g . atrial fibrillation ) intensive follow-up . The focus follow-up status patient ' physical condition regard ; weight , pain shortness breath combination area PROs study I . Consideration follow-up make depend condition patient . After 1 month patient see HVC ECG echocardiography perform . At visit patient educate informed regard disease illness , lead well understanding self-management care post-operative period . The aim education give patient insight promptly identify report symptom sign progression valve disease dysfunction prosthetic repair valve . The patient education thereby also aim improve patient ' wellbeing psychological condition increase feel security prevent poor physical outcome .</detailed_description>
