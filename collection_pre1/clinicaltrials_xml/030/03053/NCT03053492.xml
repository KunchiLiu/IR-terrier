	<brief_summary>This study 2 part : In one part study , people stroke either play custom design computer game stroke rehabilitation call Duck Duck Punch shelf computer game weaker arm 3 time per week 6 week . Evaluations determine whether one computer game improve arm movement . In second part study , people stroke , caregiver people stroke stroke rehabilitation therapist meet several focus group design useful informative Duck Duck Punch performance report .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Stroke problem nationally , especially southeastern USA , region know `` stroke belt '' stroke incidence high age stroke onset low . The vast majority , &gt; 75 % , stroke survivor experience paresis one arm/hand resolve acutely . Long-term arm movement impairment restrict independence self-care vocational activity , increase caregiver burden reduces quality life . Although rehabilitation improve outcomes , systematic financial pressure increasingly limit duration . Unfortunately , happen time strong evidence emerge traditional therapy program provide adequate amount movement practice need motor recovery . Thus , need innovative technology augment traditional stroke rehabilitation program way provide necessary movement practice within constraint current rehabilitation practice . To meet need , Principal Investigators develop prototype Kinect-based post-stroke rehabilitation game call Duck Duck Punch ( DDP ) . While maintain appeal game , DDP therapeutic focus unique design elicit arm motor recovery process consistent evidence-based stroke rehabilitation principle . The player move his/her physical arm control avatar arm reach `` punch '' virtual duck . Custom feature allow tailor game difficulty match player 's impairment level player seek accomplish optimally challenge movement goal . By design , avatar respond atypical arm motion , encourage player trial error variety motion implicitly learn normal strategy . Thus , unlike commercially available `` shelf '' game , success require `` therapist approve '' healthy arm motion . Success motivate continued game play extend practice healthy motion . Therapists integrate DDP in-clinic in-home therapy additional quasi-supervised movement practice receive performance report quantifies monitor progress toward recovery goal . Further development report enable integration billable rehabilitation program . The Investigators license DDP form company , Recovr , receive investment funding initial start-up market research . Of note , DDP also receive FDA 510 ( k ) Clearance `` support physical rehabilitation adult clinic home via performance therapist-assigned reach exercise upper extremity . '' In funded NIH/NIGMS pilot project , investigator establish technical merit feasibility DDP tool augment inpatient , outpatient home-based stroke rehabilitation increase therapist- patient-directed movement practice opportunity . Very promising result motivate current project seek test functional viability DDP determine commercial potential .</detailed_description>
