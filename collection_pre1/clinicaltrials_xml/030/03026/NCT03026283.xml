	<detailed_description>CCTA increasingly become prefer non-invasive imaging modality high sensitivity negative predictive value detection CAD . It show robust image modality evaluation chest pain , associate decrease unnecessary hospital admission , length stay , major adverse cardiovascular event rate , recidivism rate , downstream resource utilization compare standard evaluation [ 5 ] . While finding far highly suggestive CCTA 's significance gatekeeper Invasive Coronary Angiography ( ICA ) rule obstructive CAD , few half obstructive stenosis identify CCTA ischemia-causing , signify poor positive predictive value inherent lack physiological information [ 6-8 ] . Consequently , utilization CCTA entirely avert need downstream test functional assessment CCTA-detected obstructive lesion either stress testing ICA . Recently major treatment modality , associate use CCTA , become available offer promise improve positive predictive value physiological relevant hemodynamic data . Advances computational fluid dynamic technique apply standard CCTA emerge powerful tool virtual measurement FFR CCTA imaging ( CT-FFR ) . This techniques correlate well invasively measure FFR [ 1-4 ] . CT-FFR investigational agent , approve FDA November , 2014 . However , work necessary delineate patient population could derive maximal benefit new technology . While publication regard use CT-FFR specifically address cost diagnostic work-up obstructive disease , clear cost structure result change diagnostic testing also change . Deferral avoidance cardiac catheterization nuclear stress test likely yield significant reduction cost diagnostic test . From 1/1/2009 3/31/2015 team introduce operated CCTA Chest Pain triage program low intermediate risk patient Stony Brook University Hospital ED non-emergency outpatient service , tertiary care hospital Suffolk County . Concurrently , establish registry monitor patient outcomes patient receive CCTA Stony Brook Medicine . Our registry contain nearly 15,000 patient CCTA procedure . Our major registry study establish effectiveness CCTA image modality evaluate Emergency Department chest pain cost efficient manner false negative rate le 1 % [ 5 ] . However , registry reflect poorer positive predictive value document industry study [ 6-8 ] . False positive workup result necessity perform cardiac catheterization patient risk obstructive disease base assessment current standard care ( combine screen CCTA stress MPI ) . Reduction rate false positive testing would lead reduction risk invasive procedure radiation exposure patient reduce cost health care system . Several medical institution currently use HeartFlow CT-FFR standard care evaluate obstructive disease . Generally , standard care institution refer patient 30 90 percent obstruct CCTA reduction flow &lt; = 0.8 deem medical significant attend cardiologist Invasive FFR . HeartFlow report u confidentially routine use CT-FFR result 54 % reduction false positive rate compare use CCTA alone . The purpose study evaluate incremental benefit Fractional Flow Reserve derive CCTA ( FFR-CT ) compare invasive FFR gold standard patient obstructive disease ( &gt; 30 % &lt; 90 % stenosis ) . This study also assess capability CT-FFR enhance performance negative positive predictive value less experienced reader provide feedback base CT-FFR evaluation . This prospective clinical trial design evaluate incremental benefit virtual FFR measure CCTA , compare invasive FFR CCTA detection flow-limiting coronary stenosis , define invasive FFR &lt; 0.8 vessel diameter &gt; =2mm . 572 consecutive patient present Lenox Hill Hospital Outpatient Clinics CCTA due chest pain stable angina ten month period meeting study inclusion criterion eligible study ( Figure 1 ) . Our team employ CCTA-appropriateness criterion ensure proper selection patient , derive Appropriate Use Criteria Cardiac Computed Tomography publish 2010 jointly author multiple society include American College Cardiology Foundation ( ACCF ) , Society Cardiovascular Computed Tomography ( SCCT ) , American College Radiology ( ACR ) [ 10 ] . FFR-CT measurement perform core laboratory blinded fashion . All eligible patient undergo 64-slice great multi detector CCTA CT-FFR measurement . The severity stenosis determine site level III CCTA reader . Patients obstructive lesion ( 30 % 90 % stenosis ) receive Stress-MPI , per SOC protocol , CT-FFR . Patients positive Stress-Myocardial Perfusion Imaging ( MPI ) CCTA ( 50 % - 70 % % ) positive CCTA ( 71 % 90 % ) undergo ICA invasive FFR measurement accordance accept guideline establish practice standard . Those patient invasively measure FFR &lt; 0.8 vessel diameter &gt; = 2mm , require revascularizations base invasively estimate stenosis severity consider flow-limiting obstructive CAD , rest consider non-flow limit obstructive CAD ( also &gt; 50 % stenosis ICA ) . If stenosis severity turn &lt; 50 % ICA ( gold standard ) , conclude patient non-obstructive CAD . ( Figure 1 ) . Patients 30 % 49 % obstructive disease , accord CCTA , refer optimal follow care . Any group positive CT-FFR return ICA invasive FFR measurement , follow protocol 50 % 90 % obstruction . Defining event performance ICA intervention necessary , expect compare event rate patient treat CCTA FFR-CT , use t-tests multivariate , risk adjust 90 day hazard model 95 % confidence interval . Our null hypothesis outcome vary regardless test use assess obstructive disease . Our alternative hypothesis evaluation FFR-CT oppose CTTA change event rate . We also correlate noninvasive invasive FFR study . We assess inter-observer reliability two reader cohort ' ( &gt; 10 year experience less 10 year experience ) read CCTA CT-FFR.. We also assess nondiagnostic rate CT-FFR exam compare independent quality rating CCTA scan scan reader . Scans rated excellent , good , adequate , non-diagnostic . Non-diagnostic exams send CT-FFR . For sent CT-FFR compare percentage non-diagnostic exams percentage non-diagnostic CT-FFR , also correlate exam result level obstruction .</detailed_description>
