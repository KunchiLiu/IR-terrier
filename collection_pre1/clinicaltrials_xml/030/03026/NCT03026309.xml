	<detailed_description>Introduction : Major depressive disorder ( MDD ) versatile psychiatric disorder prevalence 8-12 % population many country . According current approach MDD characterize lowered activity monoamine neurotransmitter , undetermined whether result difference sensitivity receptor depletion synaptic cleft due low expression mao-a/mao-b hyperactivity . Most antidepressant medication use today base monoamine depletion theory depression . These medication include selective serotonine reuptake inhibitor ( SSRIs ) , serotonine norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor ( SNRI 's ) Tricyclics anti-depressants ( TCAs ) , inhibit reuptake monoamine , induce elevate level synaptic cleft . Some medication affect monoamine receptor directly . Dysfunctional dopamine neurotransmission essential role deficit attention , motivation anhedonia core symptom depressive disorder . Pre-synaptic D2r ( Dopamine 2 receptor ) density pre frontal cortex ( PFC ) show significantly low depressed patient versus healthy individual . At present , study use image technique depress patient use mainly different type magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) separate nuclear medicine image positron emission tomography ( PET ) tracer . The role traditional MRI evaluation depression psychiatric disorder , different study , aim mainly differentiate structural feature therefore help strengthen diagnosis aspect . There several structural change measure brain MDD patient compare control . Among decreased hippocampal volume show also compare remitted patient , increase Hypothalamic-Pituitary gland volume , decrease Pre Frontal Cortex ( PFC ) Basal-Ganglia volume . These finding also establish accordance large meta-analysis study structural change use MRI CT scan perform date . PET scan give indication regard brain 's general agent specific metabolism . Most PET scan perform depressed patient use FDG 11-C Serotonine radioligands . Only study examine F-DOPA PET uptake depressed patient , mostly Parkinsonian depression one affective flatten impulsive symptom small sample size ( n=6 ) . Most study show indication decrease DOPA uptake striatum specifically Nucleus Accombens ( NAc ) . Additional information require indicate F-DOPA uptake relevant region brain MDD . To best knowledge first study use [ 18F ] F-DOPA PET/MRI depress patient . PET/MRI offer true multimodality image combine anatomy , function molecular process allow accurate identification disease assessment . A fact well establish genetic factor together environmental factor occur across lifespan likely underlie vulnerability depression . However mega-analysis several genomewide association study ( GWAS ) , analyze 1.2 million autosomal X chromosome single-nucleotide polymorphism ( SNPs ) find SNP achieve genome-wide significance . This discrepancy consistently observe substantial heritability major depression ( 18 ) fact specific genetic variant identify robustly contribute disorder suggest mechanisms work . Epigenetics refers change chromatin structure underlies change gene expression associate alteration DNA sequence . DNA methylation one system underlies epigenetics . Methylation DNA require addition methyl group 5 ' position cytosine CpG dinucleotides . Following cytosine methylation , access transcription factor regulatory element reduce due steric interference . DNA methylation pattern hereditable one hand dynamically react environment hand . This trait Epigenetics make regulatory mechanism , determine gene expression , congruent nature psychiatric disorder . Diverse pattern DNA methylation observe different tissue subject different environment . It even different separate brain region . An Epigenome-wide association study ( EWAS ) way . In one PFC tissue post mortem depress subject researcher find enrichment neuronal growth developmental gene site Brain drived neurotrophic factor . ( BDNF ) Decreased BDNF level well establish marker depression . Lower level BDNF protein also report hippocampus animal expose chronic stress . Interestingly , administration antidepressant increase hippocampal BDNF , prevent stress-induced decrease . These finding intrigue give hippocampal volume loss observe mood disorder decrease BDNF serum level individual mood disorder depressive personality trait . Based convergent preclinical clinical data , BDNF gene represent logical target genetic investigation mood disorder . Another Epigenome-wide association study analyze whole blood DNA find IL-6 C-reactive protein ( CRP ) plasma level increase person lifetime depression , among depression , IL-6 methylation show inverse correlation plasma IL-6 CRP . To date common imaging practice psychiatric clinic allow differentiate medicate therapy optimal patient . To best knowledge , first study evaluate treatment compatibility use combination [ 18F ] F-DOPA PET/MRI image symptoms assessment pre-treatment . Study Objectives Purpose : The aim study assess feasibility modality image symptom evaluation prediction treatment compatibility . Dopamine metabolism measure mesocorticolimbic system ( VTA-NAc-PFC ) 18F-FDOPA PET structural functional MR finding patient diagnosed depression pre-treatment . Main objective : 1 . Comparing na√Øve level F-DOPA reuptake healthy individual untreated Depressed patient Mesocorticolimbic System ( VTA-NAc-PFC ) assess structural difference two group Hippocampus , Hypothalamic-Pituitary gland Mesocorticolimbic System ( VTA-NAc-PFC ) rest state fMRI . Secondary objective : 1 . Comparing difference DNA Methylation plasma patient compare healthy control . 2 . Assessing correlation symptom ' severity score ( evaluate base Hamilton Rating Scale ) base line 6 month PET 18F-DOPA uptake repertoire Mesocorticolimbic System , structural measurement DNA Methylation . Materials Methods : Study Design : A prospective , pilot study . Clinical assessment : A quantitative measure symptom ' burden determine threw clinical assessment base `` Hamilton Rating Scale Depression '' base DSM-V criterion baseline ( pre-treatment ) , 3 month 6 month treatment initiation . According DSM-5 diagnosis depression require five ( ) follow symptoms present 2-week period represent change previous functioning : ( 1 ) depress mood ( 2 ) loss interest pleasure . ( 3 ) Significant weight loss weight . ( 4 ) Insomnia hypersomnia . ( 5 ) Psychomotor agitation retardation . ( 6 ) Fatigue loss energy nearly . ( 7 ) Feelings worthlessness excessive inappropriate guilt . ( 8 ) Diminished ability think concentrate . ( 9 ) Recurrent thought death . Symptom evaluation Hamilton Rating Scale do psychiatrist . Finally attempt link specific cluster symptoms treatment compatibility accordance image molecular finding . The compatibility treatment medication compare percentage treatment success clinic 'standart care ' manner . Assessment patient 's progress determine change symptom and/or second scan follow visit 3,6 month . .Imaging diagnostic PET/MR protocol : We would use evaluation dopamine precursor 3,4-dihydroxy-6- [ 18F ] -fluoro-l-phenylalanine ( [ 18F ] FDOPA ) uptake rate constant ( K ( ) ) reflect L-dopa transport . L-aromatic amino acid decarboxylase activity , vesicular uptake number dopamine nerve terminal . would like measure compare [ 18F ] F-DOPA uptake Mesocorticolimbic network depressive unmedicated patient healthy individual . We examine [ 18F ] F-DOPA uptake repertoire characterize typical spatiotemporal pattern along different depressive brain accordance many kind symptom ' manifestation molecular demographic data . In addition , would implement , new MR sequence diffuse tensor imaging ( DTI ) susceptibility-weighted imaging ( SWI ) evaluate mesocoticolimbic dopaminergic tract use T1 , T2 sequence measure Hippocampal Hypothalamic-Pituitary gland volume patient compare healthy individual . Furthermore use T2* sequence evaluate rest state Blood-Oxygen-Level Dependent ( BOLD ) contrast imaging . In addition scan result correlate clinical evaluation symptom unmedicated patient . All scan perform department Nuclear Medicine Tel-Aviv Assuta Medical Center use PET/MR scanner ( Biograph mMR , Siemens AG , Erlangen , Germany ) accordance manufacturer 's guideline . Patients require fast least 4 hour prior arrival department . Upon arrival intravenous catheter place radiopharmaceutical gadolinium administration . Patients receive intravenous injection 10 mCi 18F-FDOPA PET MR table scan begin immediately . Dynamic PET parameter acquire along different MR sequence . MR brain include follow sequence : T1 , T2 T2 fluid attenuate inversion recovery sequence ( FLAIR ) , susceptibility-weighted sequence ( SWI ) , Diffuse Tensor Imaging ( DTI ) , blood-oxygenation level-dependent ( BOLD ) signal resting-state functional imaging .
