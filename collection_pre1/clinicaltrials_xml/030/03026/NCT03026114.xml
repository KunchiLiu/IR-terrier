	<detailed_description>Purpose : To describe demographic , clinical , echocardiographic characteristic management outpatient Heart Failure ( HF ) follow representative setting cardiology centre . Background : Heart failure one leading cause mortality adult Turkey . However , available data limit unicenter registry . The TURKHEF registry one first include large sample patient HF different region Turkey . Objective : Several study conduct western country differentiate feature epidemiology , treatment , outcomes among patient preserve reduced EF . Scarce data available middle-east population general Turkish patient particular , different etiology , ethnic , cultural background risk factor patient West . The aim study study Turkish patient HF , define clinical characteristic sign symptom heart failure , echocardiographic finding medication admission . With national study , evaluate recommendation recent European guideline regard pharmacological non-pharmacological treatment adopt clinical practice . We also evaluate prevalence clinical profile patient HF , accord definition propose European Society Cardiology , investigate appropriateness characterize patient different clinical presentation need . Methods : We design prospective , multicentre , national , observational study characterize HF . Patients present cardiology outpatient clinic sign and/or symptom HF screen . The eligibility criterion include patient old 18 year sign and/or symptom HF , admit public private hospital . Assessed outcomes included cause decompensation , use medication , care quality indicator . Data : Clinical data , include medical history , cardiovascular risk factor , associate comorbidities , collect . The symptoms patient grade accord NYHA ( New York Heart Association ) classification . Blood sample collect analysis NT ( N terminal ) -proBNP /or BNP ( brain natriuretic peptide ) , complete laboratory investigation perform well . A 12-lead surface ECG record 25 mm/s speed . Interpretation perform skilled investigator , leave ventricular hypertrophy ( LVH ) consider accord Sokolow index . Diastolic function parameter measure follow : peak early diastolic filling ( E ) late diastolic filling ( A ) velocity , E/A ratio , E deceleration time , early diastolic septal mitral annular velocity ( e ' ) ( average three cardiac cycle ) , E/e ' index LV filling pressure . Left atrial volume index calculate apical four-and two-chamber view , use area - length formula . Diastolic dysfunction classify four grade accord 2009 ASE ( American Society Echocardiography ) guideline . Conclusion : Clinical Characteristics Management TURKish Adult Outpatients With HEart Failure ( TURKHEF ) study aim characterize baseline characteristic patient heart failure Turkey .</detailed_description>
