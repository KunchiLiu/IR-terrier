	<brief_summary>The purpose study describe change quadriceps muscle size quality first 10 day extracorporeal membrane oxygenation ( ECMO ) use ultrasound imaging . This study also examine relationship change muscle strength level physical function day 10 day 20 ECMO commencement .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Acute Skeletal Muscle Wasting Relation Physical Function Patients Requiring ECMO</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The use ECMO increase dramatically past decade improvement technology survival . Whilst potentially life-saving intervention group patient high risk death , highly invasive expensive . ECMO pose dramatic physiological burden patient major long-term consequence . Among , severe prolong neuromuscular weakness perhaps significant complication . Described clinically intensive care unit acquire weakness ( ICUAW ) , associate prolong wean mechanical ventilation , delayed rehabilitation , increase hospital length stay , mortality residual deficit physical functional ability persist 5 year follow ICU admission . The health value , patient society , could substantially improve patient achieve complete recovery . Muscle strength test early stage critical illness limit , require patient awake , alert cognitively intact , therefore delayed diagnosis ICUAW due inability patient complete muscle strength test common . Consequently , grow interest utility ultrasound image monitor trajectory muscle waste inform development target intervention critically ill patient . Ultrasound image skeletal muscle non-invasive , painless radiation free technique provide objective , accurate reliable data skeletal muscle critically ill patient . This study use ultrasound image quantify early change skeletal muscle size quality , relationship strength physical function patient ECMO . Risk stratification patient peripheral muscle waste vital optimise clinical management , include development improve rehabilitative strategy improve recovery optimise risk/benefit profile ECMO .</detailed_description>
