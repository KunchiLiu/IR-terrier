	<brief_summary>10 % case refer specialist diagnostic haemato-pathology service RMH cytopenia . The hypothesis test proportion patient idiopathic cytopenias mutation myelodysplasic syndrome ( MDS ) -associated gene . The investigator sequence panel know MDS-associated gene patient material ( bone marrow blood ) send routinely diagnostic service conventional technique fail establish clear diagnosis . 200 patient idiopathic cytopenia follow determine survival , blood count development acute leukaemia haematological malignancy . The clinical outcome correlate mutation detect .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Improving Diagnosis Idiopathic Cytopenia Using Gene Sequencing</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Patients cytopenias identified local District General Consultant haematologist consent obtain . A bone marrow sample send RMH per usual diagnostic pathway . Once receive RMH , aliquot frozen sequence Molecular Pathology lab . Only case cytopenia without specific diagnosis focus study . Results feed back refer consultant caveat regard significance . Patients undergo telephone follow data also provide local consultant . The investigator look overall survival , development haematological malignancy full blood count . This occur annually .</detailed_description>
