	<brief_summary>Endotracheal intubation common care critically ill patient . Complications airway management set frequently encounter may associate increase risk death . The prevention complication urgent emergent endotracheal intubation key focus airway management research . Post-intubation hypotension ( PIH ) , common complication endotracheal intubation critically ill , may prevent bolus intravenous fluid prior start procedure , approach examine prospective trial . There randomized trial intravenous fluid administration prevent PIH critically ill adult . The investigator propose randomize trial fluid load prevent PIH critically ill adult .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Preventing Cardiovascular collaPse With Administration Fluid Resuscitation Before Endotracheal Intubation</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The investigator propose randomize , parallel-group trial evaluate impact fluid load decrease cardiovascular collapse endotracheal intubation critically ill adult . Patients admit study site deem clinical team require intubation fulfill inclusion criterion without meet exclusion criterion enrol randomly assign intravenous fluid load versus none . All decision regard airway management remain discretion treat provider . Data collect time intubation prospectively medical record order determine effect assign intervention short- long-term outcome . All data collect non-invasively already part clinical data obtain usual ICU care bedside medical record . No additional data collect observed bedside obtain medical record . Study Population : The study population critically ill adult clinical team decide perform endotracheal intubation use sedation without neuromuscular blockade . Patients exclude operator feel : 1 . Additional intravenous fluid form fluid load absolutely indicate contraindicate , 2 . The urgency intubation would make perform study procedure unsafe . Patients include regardless gender , race , weight body mass index , initial oxygen saturation , anticipate grade view , clinical factor . Study Interventions : Fluid Loading - ( 1 ) 500 milliliter intravenous crystalloid solution operator 's choosing ( 2 ) infuse time randomization prior administration procedural medication ( 3 ) level central peripheral intravenous intraosseus access use allow infuse gravity ( 4 ) stop 500 mL infuse . All intravenous infusion precede decision perform endotracheal intubation alter . No Fluid Loading - No intravenous fluid start decision make perform endotracheal intubation . All intravenous infusion precede decision perform endotracheal intubation alter . Primary Endpoint : Cardiovascular collapse - composite endpoint define one following : - Death within 1 hour intubation - Cardiac arrest within 1 hour intubation - New systolic blood pressure &lt; 65 mmHg induction 2 minute completion intubation - New increase vasopressor receipt induction 2 minute completion intubation</detailed_description>
