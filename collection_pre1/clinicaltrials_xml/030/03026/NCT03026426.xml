	<detailed_description>Epidemiologic research clearly establish significant public health importance mental disorder low- middle-income country ( LMIC ) . Among mental disorder , depression become major problem single condition , often , part complex clinical setting multiple condition risk factor combine . There substantial co-morbidity depression chronic physical condition , outcome condition impair co-morbidity . Most disease burden Latin America attributable chronic disease cardio-vascular disease hypertension diabetes , well mental disorder depression . Despite public health impact depression , often go unrecognized untreated . One important factor treatment gap limit financial human resource . The mental health resource available LMIC often optimally distribute either . Funds trained personnel typically allocate tertiary health care service , psychiatric hospital . Therefore , short- medium-term effort develop , evaluate , disseminate effective mental health intervention LMIC must adapt severe workforce shortage , resource limitation , budgetary inequity . The mental health field need consider develop self-help automate intervention reach people insufficient access specialize health care provider .

The investigator conduct randomize control trial individual chronic disease , i.e . hypertension and/or diabetes , symptom depression primary health center hospital Lima , Peru . Participants randomly assign control arm intervention arm . The late receive CONEMO intervention , monitor nurse . The focus project use self-help intervention provide advice , support , motivation . However , study suggest depressed patient leave alone device fail make good use self-help intervention . Therefore , nurse monitor participant web-based dashboard connect smartphone application ( CONEMO ) , motivate continue use CONEMO participant non-adherent give technical support . Nurses take part supervision meeting least week . Method : CONEMO randomize control trial conduct 432 chronic patient present diabetes and/or hypertension depressive symptom recruit primary health care center public hospital Lima , Peru . Half participant randomize receive CONEMO intervention half receive enhance usual care . The randomization make base 2 stratum : health center/hospital participant come his/her PHQ9 score screening ( ≤14 ; ≥15 ) . The intervention , base behavior activation , deliver smartphone monitor nurse mediate intervention , motivate support participant monitoring his/her performance . The CONEMO intervention deliver 3 time week period 6 week , sum total 18 session . Intensity depressive symptom assess research assistant use PHQ-9 baseline , 3- 6-month follow-up assessment . Outcomes : The primary outcome study proportion participant reduction 50 % PHQ-9 score 3-month assessment . The secondary outcome proportion participant reduction 50 % PHQ-9 score 6-month assessment , improvement quality life , adherence diabetes , level activity hypertension medication social functioning . There also cost-effectiveness evaluation use intention treat analysis , process evaluation . For process evaluation , data collect questionnaire CONEMO system , fill participant 3 month inclusion , interview nurse end intervention .</detailed_description>
