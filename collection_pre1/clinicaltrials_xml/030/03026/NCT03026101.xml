	<brief_summary>Migraine common headache disorder , prevalent 18 % female 6 % male . Emergency room visit , physician consults , hospitalization , medication , indirect cost lose work day decrease productivity place global economic burden migraine 20 billion dollar . It prevalent 28 million people US alone . Symptoms include unilateral , throb , debilitate headache pain accompany nausea , vomit , photophobia , phonophobia . Upwards 75 % migraine patient reduced functionability , lose time work , 1/3 patient require bed rest manage symptom . The health-related impact quality life comparable experienced patient congestive heart failure , hypertension , diabetes . While burden migraine society clear , pathophysiology migraine remain largely unknown . The trigeminovascular system , include external internal carotid artery associate sensory fiber subserve head long implicated pain cutaneous allodynia experience migraine patient . Wolff 1953 , first posit migraine headache pain cause dilation circumferential expansion extracranial carotid artery . He demonstrate migraineurs twice pulse amplitude external carotid artery compare control subject change directly correlate migraine symptom . In 2008 study , randomize migraineurs receive nitroglycerin via peripheral IV placebo 20 minute prior obtain magnetic resonance angiography ( MRA ) . Nitroglycerin , potent dilator blood vessel , reliably induce migraine-like pain 80 % patient , transient dilation vessel nearly 40 % , mostly extracranial vessel . Sumatriptan 's efficacy migraine relief provide evidence theory , selective extracranial vessel constrictor cross blood brain barrier . The goal current work utilize direct , real-time angiography , provide high resolution map vasculature , demonstrate change vessel flow patient migraine headache attack . This information may guide therapeutic intervention future order well treat migraine patient .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The goal current study demonstrate time-linked headache pain super-selectively administration vasodilatory medication external carotid artery branch , observe vessel change presume headache relief transient occlusion vessel . This work first study attempt correlate onset headache pain selective vessel dilation see angiography , spatial temporal resolution far superior MRA imaging . It also test effect transient vessel occlusion set possible relief symptom . This novel approach migraine evaluation could advance understanding disorder steer future research towards effective management migraine pain . Only patient fail medical non-invasive therapy consider study . Subjects evaluate history physical clinic visit migraine 'pre-angiography ' screen performed time . A thorough history migraine symptomatology , agree participate , obtain via questionnaire , include : severity , location , quality , alleviate exacerbate symptom , medication use , associate symptom , frequency , degree debilitation . This information collect regard migraine uniquely study . The patient also give headache log one measure column space row describe individual migraine episode first clinic visit angiogram date . After clinic visit , schedule angiography 2 4 week evaluation migraine . Their headache log collect prior procedure . The main portion study occur single angiography session follow 5 hour post-procedure period patient monitor closely part standard post-angiogram care . An anesthesiologist present throughout procedure available medication review administration need . The patient sign consent form start day remind option participate study continue normal migraine treatment . If choose participate , patient bring angiography suite transfer angiogram table . The patient prepped draped standard fashion angiogram give instruction regard procedure day . The patient receive local lidocaine groin site minimize discomfort standard arterial access purpose angiogram . Catheterization commence external carotid artery . At time , patient 's headache history guide decision first vessel cannulation . If patient frontal migraine , internal maxillary artery cannulate , parietal headache focus superficial temporal artery , occipital artery posterior , occipitally locate symptom , side patient 's migraine . A microcatheter place origin respective artery control contrast injection perform determine baseline vessel caliber blood flow . Patients ask time experience pain discomfort . If none , nitroglycerin drawn inject volume 200Âµg dilute 10ml saline vessel . This standard injection dose vasodilation medication routinely available use treat vasospasm , vasoconstriction occur subarachnoid hemorrhage angiography suite . This dose also use several cranial cardiac study association adverse reaction relate systemic spread . The expectation small dose reach systemic circulation . After 5 minute , another contrast run perform determine change vessel size patient question headache symptom . After another 5 minute , another contrast run perform see nitroglycerin still effective . If patient describes symptom , focus shift one 2 external carotid artery branch test induction headache use nitroglycerin protocol . Each vessel evaluate full 10 minute vessel cause headache pain , study terminate final control injection femoral sheath removal . Pressure groin hold 20 minute patient take recovery room monitor lie flat , standard fashion 5 hour discharge home order prevent groin hematoma . They evaluate headache pain hourly discharge , give another headache log complete prior 2 week follow-up visit . The headache log collect time complete study patient . If vessel immediately , time produce headache pain , patient query regard type quality headache , ask similar migraine . A 10 minute angiogram repeat vessel evaluate . With persistent headache , microballoon bring vessel origin , inflated block flow vessel 5 minute deflate . As state previously , risk occlusion vessel permanently , certainly temporarily perform part protocol . These non-critical vessel dense anastomotic network safe occlude . Symptoms evaluate see subside result occlusion . Five minute balloon deflate , another contrast run perform evaluate caliber study vessel . After run , groin sheath remove protocol follow outpatient follow-up . If headache symptom subside , patient administer standard pain medication , fentanyl , give routinely angiography dose 25mcg abate pain . This low , tolerable , safe dose give assistance anesthesia colleague , necessary . Their headache pain closely monitor 5 hour recovery period , give 1 25mcg dose period order fully subside pain patient still may . This angiogram take approximately 30 minute complete , low risk procedure.. The vessel study diagnostically solely extracranial completely separate intracranial vessel . Any anomalous communication identify extracranial intracranial vessel automatically disqualify patient participation study . Despite minor discomfort groin puncture patient , assistance anesthesiologist pain intra- post-procedurally experienced patient well control . The patient may also opt receive rescue pain medication time angiogram discontinue study . As state previously , extracranial vascular circulation large anastomotic network single vessel sacrifice perform without great risk . These vessel sacrifice without sequela intraoperatively routinely perform craniotomy . In case provocative artery find , occlusion vessel lead improve symptom , test temporary balloon occlusion without great risk . It hope pilot work guide future intervention control blood flow offend vessel , see migraine abate permanently vessel removal circulation . If hypothesis correct , intervention may create minimize patient 's need medication , improve quality life , free debilitation migraine .</detailed_description>
