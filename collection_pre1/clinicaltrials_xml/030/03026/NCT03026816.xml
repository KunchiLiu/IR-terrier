	<brief_summary>Epidural spinal cord stimulation purpose facilitate volitional movement new novel neuromodulatory treatment . Epidural SCS long history use chronic pain establish medical device platform . The purpose study investigate establish use SCS volitional movement . Specifically , establish disinhibitory effect SCS great population inherent great variability . In addition establish disinhibitory effect SCS cSCI , study attempt explore parameter space spinal cord stimulator platform order optimize stimulation setting patient creation clinical decision support system ( CDSS ) . Preliminary evidence suggest benefit autonomic function , study also begin explore effect SCS cardiovascular function , urinary function , psychiatric outcome , quality life , offer significant potential patient suffer chronic spinal cord injury .</brief_summary>
