	<detailed_description>The general theory inhibitory interhemispheric competition speculates , physiological condition , two cerebral hemisphere find state balance mutual inhibition . Accordingly , electrophysiological functional imaging study show stroke involvement motor function lead reduce excitability affect hemisphere M1 increase excitability contralateral M1 . Stroke therefore might impair interhemispheric balance , lead decrease inhibition contralesional hemisphere ipsilesional hemisphere , turn , increase inhibition ipsilesional hemisphere contralesional hemisphere . This imbalance cerebral hemisphere excitability tend decline functional recovery first month stroke , proportion functional recovery ipsilateral structure . Alternatively , permanence healthy hemisphere hyperactivation chronic phase stroke usually index little functional recovery correlate great structural damage ipsilesional corticospinal tract transcallosal fiber , although study suggest vicarious role healthy hemisphere . Recently , author propose structural reserve-based bimodal model recovery , vicarious model would valid patient poor structural reserve ( therefore extensive damage ) , interhemispheric competition model would valid patient large structural reserve . In light data , conceivable procedure aim promote re-establishment normal balance interhemispheric interaction facilitate motor function recovery paretic limb , least patient appropriate structural reserve . Transcranial stimulation direct current ( tDCS ) non-invasive brain stimulation technique use low intensity electrical current constant voltage variable duration able modulate cortical excitability efficiently , lastingly ( effect begin stimulation last hour end stimulation ) safely healthy subject : moreover , able produce change excitability direction ( i.e . towards increase towards reduction ) dependence electrode position scalp . Specifically , t-DCS appear induce metaplasticity phenomenon , polarity-dependent modulation response subsequent synaptic potentiation protocol . Considering result conclusion recent meta-analysis , seem appropriate expose patient t-DCS immediately early stage intervention aim promote synaptic plasticity , neuro-rehabilitation technique . Alongside traditional physical therapy technique , last twenty year many research group around world start develop robot support physical treatment . A review robot-mediated physical therapy clinical trial show innovative rehabilitation technique effective acute chronic stroke patient , although proven superiority traditional rehabilitation method . In study , investigator use robotic exoskeleton allow target intervention specific task three spatial dimension ; robot , market name Armeo Power® ( Hocoma AG , Switzerland ) , one advance rehabilitation device upper limb . The effectiveness tool demonstrate recent multicenter trial chronic stroke patient moderate-severe upper limb motor deficit . The purpose study evaluate benefit arise combination dual t-DCS ( ipsilesional excitation contralesional inhibition ) robotic therapy Armeo Power® treatment chronic stroke patient upper limb paralysis . This study double blind randomize control trial chronic stroke patient upper limb paresis undergone robotic treatment Armeo Power® randomize concomitant dual tDCS ( excitatory injure side inhibitory health side ) sham tDCS . All patient undergo initial evaluation start treatment ( 30 15 day start ) fill form medical history personal data sign informed consent . Once eligible , patient subject first clinical evaluation use validated scale , kinematic evaluation upper limb motor performance ArmeoPower® neurophysiological evaluation . At end evaluation , every patient assign randomized system one two study group : - Group A : robotic treatment Armeo Power® associate REAL dual tDCS ( anodic injure hemisphere , cathodic healthy hemisphere ) - 40 patient - Group B : robotic treatment Armeo Power® associate SHAM dual tDCS - 40 patient Immediately prior start treatment ( time T-1 ) , every participant perform second clinical assessment kinematic evaluation begin treatment day gym Private Department Saint Lucia Foundation . The ArmeoPower® device exoskeleton robot upper limb rehabilitation able allow patient ' execution movement proximal ( shoulder-elbow movement ) distal ( movement wrist ) segment upper limb . Once arm robot adapted patent 's upper limb , exoskeleton mount set define action area volume exploration . At begin session , ArmeoPower® exoskeleton mount accord patient ' store setting , take 10 minute . Once mount , proceed real sham tDCS stimulation , depend group patient belong . Participants group A perform real dual tDCS stimulation immediately session robotic treatment , patient group B perform treatment robotics platform intensity duration group A precede sham dual tDCS stimulation . Real dual tDCS stimulation require application anode injured motor cortex ( M1 ) cathode healthy motor cortex ( M1 ) , simultaneously perform excitability suppression healthy hemisphere activation ischemic cortex . Motor cortex simultaneously stimulate intensity equal 1-2 mA maximum duration 20 minute . Sham dual t-DCS require application electrode position duration , without delivery electrical stimulation . The robotic rehabilitation treatment start immediately end stimulation , actual treatment last 30 minute . The robot able relieve weight arm assist patient motor execution . The patient see monitor target upon move effector execute movement active assistance robot , compensate patient 's motor deficit . Videogame-based exercise functional training exercise daily life activity carry visual , acoustic performance feedback . A physical therapist specific train certificate always present session , 1:1 ratio patient . Each patient perform 5 session per week two consecutive week , perform clinical , kinematic neurophysiological evaluation expect T0 ; patient re-evaluated follow-up one month ( T1 ) 3 month end treatment ( T2 ) , clinical kinematic assessment . Data analyze use parametric statistic appear normally distribute ( base Kolgomorov-Smirnov test Lilliefors correction ) , particular apply two-way mixed model analysis variance ( intra- inter-factor subject ) . If data wo n't appear normally distribute , analyze use Friedman 's analysis intra-subject variation , Mann-Whitney u-test variation two group . The level significance set 0.05 analysis , except post-hoc applied Bonferroni correction . Guidelines safe use non-invasive brain stimulation ( Wassermann , 1998 ) respect ; participant able sign informed consent . There literature report adverse event contraindication regard use ArmeoPower® robotics platform , except patient severe deformity paretic upper limb , exclude study . Data patient anonymous store password protection . There sample biological material , drug delivery , healthy volunteer animal .</detailed_description>
