	<brief_title>Baricitinib Relapsing Giant Cell Arteritis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Baricitinib , orally administer , potent , selective reversible inhibitor JAK1 JAK2 show preliminary safety efficacy chronic , immune-mediated inflammatory condition rheumatoid arthritis psoriasis . This small molecule uniquely suit potential novel therapeutic agent GCA suppressive effect Th17 ( IL-6 , IL-23 ) andTh1 ( IL-12 , IFN-γ ) pathways . This study evaluate safety tolerability baricitinib population patient relapse GCA . The study open-label pilot study assess safety tolerability baricitinib ( 4 mg daily , oral , 52 week ) addition standardize glucocorticoid taper . It anticipate adjunct baricitinib safe well tolerated patient GCA demonstrate preliminary efficacy measure reduce inflammatory marker , decrease steroid requirement increase relapse-free survival .</detailed_description>
