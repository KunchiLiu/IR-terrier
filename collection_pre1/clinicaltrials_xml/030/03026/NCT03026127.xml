	<detailed_description>The goal project refine test novel emotion-regulation base psychosocial intervention design reduce suicide risk middle-aged older adult ( 50-90 year old ) discharge suicide-related hospitalization ( i.e . suicidal ideation suicide attempt ) .

Research assistant , unaware study aim , conduct assessment study entry ( hospital admission ) , discharge , 6 12 week post-discharge . Target engagement assessed electrocortical measure ( i.e . late positive potential , LPP ) standard pictured-based stimulus novel cognitive reappraisal paradigm . The R33 phase aim provide evidence target engagement optimize CRISP large sample , evaluate relationship cognitive reappraisal suicide risk measure Columbia Suicide Severity Rating Scale-C-SSRS estimate implementation parameter large-scale clinical trial . A different sample 90 middle-aged old adult ( use inclusion/exclusion criterion R61 phase ) randomize ( 3 1 ) CRISP ( N=60 ) Supportive Therapy ( ST , control treatment design improve emotion regulation ) ( N=30 ) . Assessments conducted admission , discharge , 6 , 12 24 week post-discharge . Primary aim : 1 ) CRISP participant show improvement cognitive reappraisal ability discharge end treatment ; 2 ) improvement cognitive reappraisal ability associate suicide risk 24 week .</detailed_description>
