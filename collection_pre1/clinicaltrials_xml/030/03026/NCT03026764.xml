	<brief_title>Inpatient v Outpatient Total Hip Replacement</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Total Hip Arthroplasty ( THA ) currently one successful procedure orthopaedics . Over last 40 year , postoperative care significantly evolve . Initially , standard procedure follow THA patient require stay hospital recover 2.5 3 week . However , implementation less invasive technique , couple early weight bear comprehensive postoperative rehabilitation protocol , inpatient stay drastically decrease average 2 3 day . A new , minimally invasive surgical ( MIS ) technique lead even large decrease hospital stay , culminate day discharge . The possibility early mobilization , combine increase push patient accelerate recovery return activity , lead implementation outpatient THA select patient . For day discharge succeed , extensive preoperative perioperative care must accompany procedure . Furthermore , aggressive rehabilitation improve pain control crucial successful outpatient THA . For young patient need return work early possible , quicker recovery time essential . Perfecting outpatient THA crucial step towards achieve requirement . There 4 major component successful THA : pain relief , functional recovery , patient satisfaction durable reconstruction . Outpatient THA fairly new concept arthroplasty , patient satisfaction properly assess follow new THA protocol . Satisfaction accordance THA refers patient achieve functional pain expectation . A similar study evaluate patient satisfaction randomize control trial ( RCT ) inpatient versus outpatient anterior cruciate ligament ( ACL ) reconstruction report outpatient satisfaction follow surgery high inpatient satisfaction . Although different procedure , would seem outpatient ACL reconstruction outpatient THA similar pain level , safety patient satisfaction . The goal outpatient surgery regard satisfaction provide patient relief anxiety , allow early control independence . Potential advantage outpatient surgery include patient permit recover secure , private comfortable home environment , surgeon improve efficiency time management decreased responsibility visit inpatient . In addition potential satisfaction benefit , outpatient THA potential source cost saving patient hospital . Numerous effort hospital make decrease cost increase available bed additional patient . A previous study investigate financial effect outpatient THA find average hospital bill outpatients $ 4000 less inpatient . Including preoperative physical therapy home healthcare , total charge outpatients $ 2500 less inpatient . A similar study demonstrate select individual successfully undergo THA outpatient set increase complication , also receive substantial saving patient healthcare system . By reduce cost increase healthcare staff availability , hospital allocate money area need funding , wait time drastically reduce future patient . The important part preoperative care successful outpatient THA give patient appropriate goal expectation . Patients educate anaesthesiology team , physical occupational therapist , surgeon , nurse , anyone else involve surgery . Patients require attend class explain various aspect operative experience , well discharge goal technique postoperative home rehabilitation . Furthermore , functional symptomatic goal need clearly define . In educational session , pain management strategy one main focus . To successful day discharge , patient must well verse pain management proper rehabilitation strategy . Before preoperative class , patient instructed practice certain skill , bed transfer , cane/crutches use gait training . Potential complication discuss patient reassure normally suppose happen follow surgery . The goal preoperative care patient define set goal expectation surgery , medication , rehabilitation . For outpatient THA surgery , prefer perform surgery morning facilitate day discharge . Immediately follow surgery , primary goal treat pain , nausea hypovolemia . Prior symptom arrive , issue deal use proper fluid medication . Physical therapy usually initiate 3 4 hour follow surgery . The combination early rehabilitation program , combine minimally invasive surgical technique vital rapid recovery process . Home physical therapy begin immediately , focus ambulation . The patient ask follow-up visit within 1 week surgery make sure patient 's goal meet . The primary concern outpatient THA safety patient . There also concern include emergency room readmission patient difficulty home immediate postoperative period . Furthermore , patient require transfer inpatient facility experience delay recovery surgery . Anecdotal data collect prior start research project . Since clinical practice change , informal conversation outpatient THA demonstrate 10/11 patient would outpatient surgery , 9/11 would recommend outpatient THA surgery others . These encouraging finding important justification perform present study . Although previous THA outpatient study demonstrate successful result , imperative complete RCT diminish bias associate finding . In absence high quality comparative evidence , success day discharge THA may result selection bias , since previous research largely driven observational study highly select population . This would severely decrease generalizability previous study . To knowledge , first level one study investigate cost , early complication patient satisfaction associate outpatient THA pragmatic selection patient . This study answer important question best treat patient undergo THA , whether early discharge follow surgery affect patient outcome .</detailed_description>
