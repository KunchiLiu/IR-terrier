	<brief_title>Durvalumab Tremelimumab Combo Versus Sequential</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Study Groups : If participant find eligible take part study participant randomly assign ( flip coin ) 1 2 study group ( Combination group Sequential group ) . This do one know one study group well , , bad group . Each study cycle 4 week . Combination Group : If participant assign Combination Group , participant receive 4 cycle tremelimumab durvalumab together , follow 9 cycle durvalumab alone . If participant ' disease get bad point participant begin standard care treatment choose study doctor participant give option enroll another study . If participant receive standard care treatment , study doctor discus risk procedures participant detail . If participant choose enroll another study , separate consent form provide participant take study . Sequential Group : If participant assign Sequential Group , participant receive 4 cycle tremelimumab alone , disease get bad , participant receive 9 cycle durvalumab alone . The study doctor discus . Study Drug Administration : Each time participant receive tremelimumab durvalumab , give vein 60 minute Day 1 cycle . Length Study : Participants may receive study drug 13 cycle . If participant combination group , participant may receive standard care treatment study drug long doctor think participant ' best interest disease get bad . If participant sequential group participant complete full 13 cycle study drug without disease get bad , participant follow visit disease get bad participant begin receive treatment another study . Participants take study intolerable side effect occur , participant unable follow study direction , study doctor think participant ' best interest . Study Visits : Combination Group : All visit occur Day 1 28-day cycle . On Day 1 Cycles 1-13 : - Participants physical exam . - Blood ( 2 tablespoon ) draw routine test , immune system test , check function participant ' thyroid Cycles 1-6 . If participant able become pregnant , routine blood test include pregnancy test Cycles 1 3 . - Urine collect routine test . - Participants complete questionnaire participant screen . Participants alternate complete 7 questionnaire 4 questionnaire cycle . During Cycle 1 : - Participants return clinic blood draw ( 1 tablespoon time ) biomarker immune system test Days 8 , 15 , 22 . - Participants EKG check participant ' heart function . During Cycles 2 , 4 , 6 , 8 , 10 , 12 , 2 week participant receive study drug , participant MRI CT scan check status disease . During Cycle 3 , participant core tumor biopsy biomarker immune system test . If disease get bad point participant begin standard care treatment choose study doctor participant give option enroll another study . If disease get bad 13 cycle treatment study drug , participant enter wait period . If disease get bad wait period , participant begin standard care treatment choose study doctor participant give option enroll another study . During wait period , follow test procedure perform 30 day every 2 month participant begin standard care treatment chosen participant ' doctor participant leave study : Participants physical exam . - Blood ( 2 tablespoon ) draw routine test check function participant ' thyroid . - Urine collect routine test . - Participants complete 7 questionnaire screen . If participant receive standard care treatment , participant follow study visit schedule participant receive tremelimumab durvalumab , except participant blood draw biopsy biomarker immune system test . Sequential Group : All visit occur Day 1 28-day cycle . On Day 1 Cycles 1-4 : - Participants physical exam . - Blood ( 2 tablespoon ) draw routine test , immune system test , check function participant ' thyroid . If participant able become pregnant , routine blood test include pregnancy test Cycles 1 3 . - Urine collect routine test . - Participants complete questionnaire participant screen . Participants alternate complete 7 questionnaire 4 questionnaire cycle . During Cycle 1 : - Participants return clinic blood draw ( 1 tablespoon time ) biomarker immune system test Days 8 , 15 , 22 . - Participants EKG check participant ' heart function . During Cycles 2 4 , , 2 week participant receive study drug , participant MRI CT scan check status disease . During Cycle 3 , participant core tumor biopsy biomarker immune system test . After Cycle 4 disease get bad , whichever occur first , participant wait least 8 week allow tremelimumab clear participant ' system participant receive 9 cycle durvalumab ( Cycles 5-13 ) . About 1 month 8-week waiting period , participant study visit . The following test procedure perform : - Participants physical exam . - Blood ( 2 tablespoon ) draw routine test check function participant ' thyroid . - Urine collect routine test . - Participants complete 7 questionnaire screen . Participants begin receive durvalumab Day 1 Cycle 5 . On Day 1 Cycles 5-13 : - Participants physical exam . - Blood ( 1 tablespoon ) drawn routine test check function participant ' thyroid . - Urine collect routine test . - Participants complete questionnaire participant screen . Participants alternate complete 7 questionnaire 4 questionnaire cycle . During Cycle 5 , participant EKG check participant ' heart function . During Cycles 5 6 , additional blood sample ( 1 tablespoon ) drawn immune system test . During Cycles 6 , 8 , 10 , 12 , 2 week participant receive study drug , participant MRI CT scan check status disease . End Study Visit After participant receive participant ' last dose study drug standard care treatment choose study doctor , participant end study visit . The following test procedure perform : - Participants physical exam . - Blood ( 2 tablespoon ) draw routine test check function participant ' thyroid . If participant become pregnant , part sample use pregnancy test . - Urine collect routine test . - Participants complete 7 questionnaire screen . Follow-up About 30 day every 2 month participant ' last dose study drug standard care treatment : - Participants physical exam . - Participants MRI CT scan check status disease . - Participants complete 7 questionnaire ( first 2 month ) . This investigational study . Neither durvalumab tremelimumab FDA approve commercially available type cancer study . Participants currently use research purpose disease . The study doctor explain study drug design work . Up 100 participant enrol study . All take part MD Anderson .</detailed_description>
