	<brief_summary>The aim study examine molecular alteration protein level lesion oral lichen planus ( OLP ) , oral squamous cell carcinoma ( OSCC ) healthy mucosa . Global protein profile method base liquid chromatography couple mass spectrometry use , special emphasis evaluation deregulate extracellular matrix molecule expression , well analyse insulin-like growtg factor 2 ( IG2F ) insulin-like growth factor 2 receptor ( IGFR2 ) expression healthy mucosa , OLP OSCC tissue comparative semiquantitative immunohistochemistry . Mass spectrometry base proteomics profile healthy mucosa , OLP OSCC tissue ( accompany histologically unaltered tissue , respectively ) identify 55 extracellular matrix protein . Twenty among identified protein common group sample . Statistically significant difference final IGF2 IGF2R IRS score favour IGF2R may corroborate IG2FR antitumor role OLP OSCC act negative regulator IGF2 activity .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Although OLP categorise precancerous condition associate significantly increase risk oral cancer , molecular pathophysiology OLP potential malignant transformation OSCC poorly understand remain controversial . Development new analytical method enhances research field malignant disorder . Identification novel biomarkers help diagnostic process , pre-symptomatic intervention prediction treatment response . Proteomics base mass spectrometry enable analysis novel , putative biomarkers . In study , proteomics use analyse detail extracellular matrix ( ECM ) proteins protein related ECM signalization well-established role malignant transformation invasion tumor cell . IGF2 IGF2R know biomarkers cellular metabolism , role oral precancerous lesion , namely oral lichen planus ( OLP ) well oral squamous cell carcinoma ( OSCC ) explore far . The second aim study analyse IG2F IGFR2 expression oral lichen planus oral squamous cell carcinoma tissue comparative semiquantitative immunohistochemistry</detailed_description>
