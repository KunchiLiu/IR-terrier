	<detailed_description>Biologics use treat variety medical condition across multiple medical specialty . In Dermatology specialty , biologics use treat condition moderate-to-severe psoriasis , chronic condition impairs quality life much major medical condition . Biopharmaceuticals medication isolate biological source include microorganism , animal human . Examples biologic medication commonly use dermatology include tumor necrosis factor-alpha ( TNF-alpha ) blockers/inhibitors ( etanercept , infliximab , certolizumab pegol , golimumab ) , interleukin 12/23 blocker ( ustekinumab ) , interleukin 17A blocker ( secukinumab , ixekizumab ) . These medication generally function decrease inflammation disrupt inflammatory cycle . Biologic medication administer via injection patient healthcare provider . Most medication require periodic injection approximately per month . Patients may undergo periodic lab monitoring assess side effect . Biologic medication revolutionize dermatology general medical field . Patients often apprehensive choose biologic medication option due anxiety regard need regular injection , leave patient undertreated continue suffer psoriasis . Reducing fear injection may improve adherence treatment may improve treatment outcome . Fear injection inherently subjective may easily modify . Anchoring tendency human rely specific value making decision make judgment relative value . Patients never take injection subjectively view idea take injection relative `` take injection '' baseline . This comparison scary represent considerable hurdle take new injectable medication may otherwise optimal treatment . Resetting anchor may need help patient overcome fear injection . The investigator hypothesize patient first counsel possibility take injectable biologic medication daily , would much less hesitant take monthly injection .</detailed_description>
