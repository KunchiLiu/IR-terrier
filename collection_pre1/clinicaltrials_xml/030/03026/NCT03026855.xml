	<detailed_description>Platelet Rich Plasma ( PRP ) therapy innovative treatment use body 's cell relieve pain promote accelerate heal Non-healing Foot Ulcer /Wound . The body 's response tissue injury deliver platelet , play instrumental role normal heal process secrete growth factor attract stem cellsâ€”critical component heal cascade . Any wound ulcer skin present 4-5 week duration , without heal call non-healing ulcer . Non-healing ulcer include venous , arterial , diabetic , pressure traumatic ulcer . Cellular therapy use Autologous Platelet Rich Plasma provide new option wound heal . The efficacy treatment proven surgical application , treatment severe burn transplantation cell tissue . Local application solution plasma enrich platelet derive patient 's blood intend trigger heal process non-responsive chronic wound , increase wind repair rate reduce pain . PRP good option non-healing wound utilize body 's natural healing process jump-start wound heal . Plasma contain valuable growth factor separate blood component utilize point care technology base density gradient centrifugation . The platelet rich plasma harvest activated mixture human thrombin calcium chloride initiate heal cascade follow PRP injection directly ulcer/wound periphery spread wound form PRP gel .</detailed_description>
