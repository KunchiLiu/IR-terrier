Manual ventilation induction intubation ( `` bag-valve-mask '' ventilation ) propose mean prevent hypoxemia , common complication intubation outside operating room . Safety efficacy data , however , lack . PreVent randomize trial compare manual ventilation induction laryngoscopy manual ventilation induction laryngoscopy endotracheal intubation critically ill adult . The primary efficacy endpoint low arterial oxygen saturation . The primary safety endpoint low oxygen saturation , high fraction inspire oxygen , high positive end-expiratory pressure 24 hour procedure .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Preventing Hypoxemia With Manual Ventilation During Endotracheal Intubation ( PreVent ) Trial</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PreVent prospective , parallel-group , pragmatic , randomized trial compare manual ventilation induction laryngoscopy manual ventilation induction laryngoscopy endotracheal intubation critically ill adult . The primary aim PreVent trial compare effect manual ventilation induction intubation versus manual ventilation low arterial oxygen saturation experience critically ill adult undergo endotracheal intubation . The PreVent trial anticipate begin enrollment January 2017 enroll adult undergo endotracheal intubation sedation and/or neuromuscular blockade participate unit . Patients randomize 1:1 manual ventilation versus manual ventilation . In manual ventilation group , manual ventilation use bag-valve-mask provide time induction time endotracheal intubation , except laryngoscopy . In manual ventilation group , manual ventilation provide induction endotracheal intubation , except treatment hypoxemia . The primary efficacy endpoint low arterial oxygen saturation procedure . The primary safety endpoint low oxygen saturation , high fraction inspire oxygen , high positive end expiratory pressure 24 hour intubation . The planned enrollment 350 patient . Conduct trial overseen Data Safety Monitoring Board . An interim analysis perform enrollment 175 patient . The analysis trial conduct accordance pre-specified statistical analysis plan make publicly available prior conclusion enrollment .</detailed_description>
