	<brief_summary>Objectives : To assess predictive value IUS child IBD . Design : A prospective longitudinal cohort study . Setting : Institute Gastroenterology , Nutrition Liver Diseases , Schneider Children 's Hospital . Participants : Children 2 year 17 year ( 200 patient ) diagnose either CD UC . Main outcome measure : The change bowel wall thickness , assess IUS , 2-year follow-up accord therapeutic regimen .

	<detailed_description>Hypothesis : The investigator hypothesize bowel wall thickness measure routinely IUS role predict short- long-term disease outcomes flare , hospitalization , treatment escalation surgery . Objectives : Primary Objectives : To assess change bowel wall thickness , assess IUS , 2-year follow-up , accord therapeutic regimen evaluate predictive significance disease outcome ( flare , hospitalization , treatment escalation surgery ) . Secondary Objective : To evaluate correlation sonographic measure clinical disease index , serum inflammatory laboratory marker , fecal calprotectin , endoscopic radiologic measure perform part routine care . Methods : - Design : A prospective longitudinal cohort study . - Patients : Children age 2 year 17 year diagnose IBD . Intervention : Children diagnose either CD UC follow-up Institute Gastroenterology , Nutrition Liver Diseases , Schneider Children 's Hospital , enrol . Patients enrol diagnosis time point follow-up . Patients ' characteristic retrieve medical file include demographic detail , disease phenotype , endoscopic radiologic variable , anthropometric measure , laboratory evaluation , complication therapeutic regimen . At enrollment every 3 month total period 2 year patient perform IUS regular clinic visit . All measure include laboratory exam , anthropometric measurement disease activity index ( either wPCDAI CD PUCAI UC ) perform part standard care purpose study . If endoscopic evaluation MRE necessary accord treat physician discretion assessment disease activity , perform part study result record included data analysis . Data analysis : Data analyze use SPSS ( version 23.0 , SPSS , Inc. , Armonk , NY , USA ) r-project version 3.1.1 . Continues variable present either mean±SD median interquartile range ( IQR ) depend data approximation normal distribution . Agreement IUS MRE ( available ) assess use Bland-Altman plot Concurrent Validity quantify correlation coefficient concordance correlation coefficient . Associations therapeutic intervention variable outcome measure examine use repeat measure ANOVA . p-values &lt; 0.05 consider significant . Sample size : All pediatric IBD patient Schneider Children 's Hospital , fulfil inclusion criterion eligible study . For assessment therapeutic intervention IUS investigator use mixed model ANOVA . Sample size calculate repeated measure ANOVA in-between interaction . Assuming effect size F 0.25 ( partial η2=0.06 ) , alpha 5 % statistical power 80 % correlation 0.5 , investigator need least 34 CD patient 34 UC patient .</detailed_description>
