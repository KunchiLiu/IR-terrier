	<brief_summary>The aim study check standard screen blood pressure arm central blood pressure , blood pressure heart pregnant woman . The standard brachial pressure routinely monitor throughout pregnancy , however sensitive enough distinguish preeclampsia type hypertension predict preeclampsia risk . Central aortic pressure monitoring become valuable clinical tool preliminary study suggest measure central blood pressure may better predictor preeclampsia . It non invasive n't require undressing . It involve use standard blood pressure cuff place around thigh , check carotid pulse pressure ultrasound take measurement person neck torso . With knowledge useful screen tool identify patient high risk hopefully lead closer monitoring , earlier treatment reduced morbidity mortality</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>When blood pressure measure conventionally brachial artery assume measurement accurately reflect pressure central circulation . However , central aortic pressure blood pressure root aorta determine cardiac output peripheral vascular resistance , stiffness conduit artery time magnitude pressure wave reflection . Studies show importance central aortic pressure implication assess efficacy antihypertensive treatment respect cardiovascular risk factor . In CAFE Study traditional method measure blood pressure arm show underestimate efficacy drug amlodipine overestimate efficacy like atenolol ( 4 ) . This clinical trial demonstrate different medication lower blood pressure different effect central aortic pressure blood flow characteristic , despite produce similar brachial blood pressure reading . They also able show central aortic pressure well independent predictor cardiovascular renal outcome . The Strong Heart Study go depict central pressure predictive load impose coronary cerebral artery thereby bear strong relationship vascular damage prognosis . Hypertensive disorder pregnancy , particular , preeclampsia , lead cause maternal neonatal morbidity mortality . In United States United Kingdom , approximately 5 % pregnancy complicate preeclampsia , patient , 1-2 % progress eclampsia . It estimate rate higher develop country . An estimated 50,000 woman die annually preeclampsia worldwide . The presence hypertension pregnancy also associate two-fold increase risk gestational diabetes mellitus . In addition , history preeclampsia increase woman 's subsequent risk vascular disease , include hypertension , ischemic heart disease , myocardial infarction stroke . The increase risk complication limit mother ; baby woman hypertensive disorder pregnancy likely suffer adverse outcome woman without hypertension . A large cross-sectional study observe 250,000 woman infant show woman gestational hypertension 30 % great risk death major morbidity , woman pre-eclampsia 400 % increase risk , compare woman without hypertension . Although preeclampsia preventable , early diagnosis , careful monitoring aggressive treatment crucial preventing mortality . The brachial pressure routinely monitor throughout pregnancy , however sensitive enough distinguish preeclampsia type hypertension predict preeclampsia risk . Central aortic pressure monitoring become valuable clinical tool outside pregnancy , particular assessment patient 's hypertension , renal disease diabetes . Preliminary study suggest measure central blood pressure may predictive preeclampsia . In normal pregnancy aortic stiffness show vary throughout pregnancy , reach low point second trimester rise third trimester . A number study investigate change pulse wave index third trimester across spectrum hypertensive disorder . Central pressure , along Augmentation pressure find significantly high gestational hypertension preeclampsia compare normal pregnancy . In addition , Aortic augmentation pressure pulse wave velocity show vary preeclampsia , gestational hypertension , normal pregnancy . The ability accurately identify woman risk preeclampsia would significant clinical benefit . The ability distinguish hypertensive disorder identify woman increase risk preeclampsia lead well management hypertensive disorder pregnancy therefore good outcome mother child . The aim study examine early evaluation central blood pressure arterial stiffness ( pulse wave analysis ) predictor gestational hypertension/preeclampsia .</detailed_description>
