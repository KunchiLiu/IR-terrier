	<brief_summary>Rationale : The immune system age population becomes compromise age ( term `` Immunosenescence '' ) . Therefore , elderly people decrease ability respond infection vaccination . Furthermore , many health issue associate age link inflammation ( `` Inflammaging '' ) . It suggest compromise immune function part due reduce Toll-like receptor ( TLR ) function , part innate immune system . Milk dairy base product show beneficial effect inflammation immunity . This effect may mediate via support innate immune response promote TLR7 signal vitro assay ( unpublished observation ) . Also prebiotics suggest influence marker innate immune function . Furthermore , TLR function suggest correlated vitamin D status . Therefore , current pilot study , potential milk protein , prebiotics vitamin D support innate immune function elderly investigate . Objective : Aim current study evaluate effect milk protein innate immune response elderly pilot study . Furthermore , support effect prebiotics Vitamin D study . Study design : The study double-blind placebo-controlled pilot study . Study population : Healthy female elderly subject 65-85 year age . Intervention : Period 1 : Milk protein placebo . Period 2 : Milk protein + prebiotics placebo . Period 3 : Milk protein + prebiotics + Vitamin D placebo .</brief_summary>
