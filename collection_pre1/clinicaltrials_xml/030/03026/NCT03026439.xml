	<detailed_description>Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease ( COPD ) prolong course onset , follow classical epidemiological principle chronic disease genetic predisposition . `` Disease onset '' may define physiologic impairment express abnormal spirometric index , `` early disease '' could include clinical manifestation , cough , phlegm , dyspnea exercise limitation , normal spirometry . For present proposal , use dyspnea define symptomatic subject , since dyspnea relevant symptom range disease . Besides , define `` early disease '' current ex-smoker-adults : ) complain dyspnea normal spirometry ; b ) complain dyspnea mild bronchial obstruction ; , c ) mild bronchial obstruction without dyspnea . These subtypes roughly similar Global initiative Chronic Obstructive Lung Disease ( GOLD ) stag 0 1 [ 1 ] , although characterize presence absence dyspnea . The dyspnea cut value choose separate symptomatic asymptomatic subject modify Medical Research Council ( mMRC ) score ≥1 , line several recent communication [ 2-4 ] , differs cut recommended GOLD ( score ≥2 ) [ 5 ] . In addition , GOLD 0 stage [ 1 ] , include GOLD guideline 2001 currently use , comprise dyspneic subtype , include light new evidence point potential relevance [ 6 , 7 ] . Early disease subtypes 1 . Symptomatic current ex-smokers normal spirometry report Woodruff et al [ 7 ] large sample individual complain chronic respiratory symptom , reduce exercise tolerance , compute tomography ( CT ) image bronchiolitis . These result line previous finding another large study Regan et al [ 8 ] 50 % symptomatic smoker normal spirometry respiratory-related impairment evidence emphysema CT imaging . Woodruff et al [ 7 ] use COPD Assessment Test ( CAT ) questionnaire define symptom [ 9 ] find cough , phlegm , dyspnea , activity limitation , energy level equally distribute among symptomatic smoker regardless presence spirometric COPD . However , although CAT intend specific COPD [ 9 ] , domains may reflect concomitant respiratory ( asthma bronchiectasis ) and/or nonrespiratory disease ( heart failure , ischemic heart disease , obesity , depression ) [ 10 ] . In contrast , Regan et al [ 8 ] measure seven `` respiratory-related impairment '' find one present 54 % patient . Three impairment could consider rather specific COPD , like CT percentage emphysema &gt; 5 % gas trap &gt; 20 % , St. George 's Respiratory Questionnaire ( SGRQ ) total score &gt; 25 . However , four impairment ( chronic bronchitis , modify Medical Research Council ( mMRC ) dyspnea score ≥2 , exacerbation 6-min walk distance &lt; 350 ) non-specific may partly fully explained comorbidities like gastroesophageal reflux disease , rhinosinusitis , obesity heart failure , among others . Actually , retrospective data suggest patient COPD comorbid condition may great risk symptom without comorbidity [ 11 , 12 ] . 2 . Non-dyspneic current ex-smokers mild COPD also describe [ 13 , 14 ] . It seem group coexist individual normal lung function 6-min walk test performance [ 14 ] subject rest lung hyperinflation , reduce diffusion capacity lung carbon monoxide ( DLCO ) slightly increase cycle-exercise-induced dyspnoea [ 13 ] . 3 . Dyspneic current ex-smokers mild COPD significant emphysema airway thickness , low DLCO , exercise-induced arterial desaturation , reduce 6-min walking distance [ 14 , 15 ] . In addition , incremental cycle-exercise exhibit increase ventilatory demand , lung hyperinflation great exertional dyspnea smoker control [ 16 ] . Hypothesis We hypothesize dyspneic individual notwithstanding spirometry result , share clinical , structural physiologic abnormality . In particular , expect two dyspneic group without mild COPD exhibit reduce exercise capacity , addition bad quality life ; low physical activity ; great lung hyperinflation ; great emphysema airway thickness ; reduce peripheral muscle mass , asymptomatic counterpart , i.e. , non-dyspneic mild COPD control . Study aim This study intend identify three early COPD subtypes already define use difference exercise capacity primary outcome . As secondary outcome , intend separate group mean difference clinical ( quality life , physical activity ) , physiological ( exercise test ) structural characteristic ( emphysema , airway disease , peripheral muscle mass CT imaging ) . Future analysis plan evaluate longitudinal deterioration clinical , physiological structural characteristic . Potential influence obesity undiagnosed heart failure dyspnea thus , exercise capacity , explore within three subtypes . Study design The study cross sectional design aim obtain representative sample adult 45 80 year . Two hundred forty participant enrol four stratum already define , i.e. , dyspneic current ex-smokers without mild COPD ; non-dyspneic current ex-smokers without ( control ) mild COPD . Study subject recruit outpatient clinic pulmonary function lab Pontifical Catholic University Chile Health Network mean physician referral , advertisement clinical area , self-referral study center . The Institutional Ethics Committee approve study protocol sign informed consent obtain participant . Sample size A sample size least 52 subject per group provide enough power ( 80 % ) detect significant difference ( 95 % confidence level alpha 0.05 ) 6-min walk test among symptomatic asymptomatic participant , base conservative relevant difference walk distance 50 meter common standard deviation 110 metre . Such difference find compare symptomatic asymptomatic subject normal spirometry [ 7 ] , may underestimation patient mild spirometric COPD [ 14 ] , difference symptomatic asymptomatic patient 100 metre . Forestalling participant loss rate 20 % , 60 patient include group .</detailed_description>
