	<brief_title>Docetaxel Plus Nivolumab Docetaxel Alone Patients With Advanced Non-squamous NSCLC Previously Treated With Nivolumab</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OUTLINE : This multi-center study . INVESTIGATIONAL TREATMENT : Eligible subject randomize 1:1 ratio receive treatment either : Arm A : docetaxel 75 mg/meters square ( mg/m2 ) plus nivolumab 360 mg IV every 21 day Arm B : docetaxel alone 75 mg/m2 every 21 day For treatment arm , 21 day equal 1 cycle therapy subject eligible continue treatment progressive disease Response Evaluation Criteria Solid Tumors v1.1 ( RECIST v1.1 ) unacceptable toxicity . The follow screening labs demonstrate adequate organ function must perform within 30 day prior registration : Hematological : - White Blood Cell ( WBC ) ≥ 2 k/mm3 - Absolute Neutrophil Count ( ANC ) ≥ 1.5 K/mm3 - Platelets &gt; 100k - Hemoglobin ≥ 9 g/dL Renal : - Calculated creatinine clearance ≥ 40 cc/min Hepatic : - Bilirubin 1.5 ≤ upper limit normal ( ULN ) - Aspartate aminotransferase ( AST ) ≤ 1.5 × ULN - Alanine aminotransferase ( ALT ) ≤ 1.5 × ULN Coagulation : - International Normalized Ratio ( INR ) Prothrombin Time ( PT ) Activated Partial Thromboplastin Time ( aPTT ) ≤ 2 × ULN ( Note : use vitamin K antagonist allow )</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Subject must meet follow applicable inclusion criterion participate study : Written inform consent American Health Insurance Portability Accountability Act 1996 ( HIPAA ) authorization release personal health information prior registration . NOTE : HIPAA authorization may include informed consent obtain separately . Age ≥ 18 year time consent . Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group ( ECOG ) Performance Status 02 within 30 day prior registration . Histological cytological confirm nonsquamous nonsmall cell lung cancer . Measurable disease accord RECIST 1.1 within 30 day prior registration . A subject prior brain metastasis may consider complete treatment brain metastasis least 4 week prior study registration , corticosteroid ≥ 2 week , asymptomatic . Subjects must clinical benefit single agent nivolumab define least 3 month PFS , progression . Most recent therapy must treatment single agent Nivolumab . Subjects must experience disease progression single agent Nivolumab therapy . Most recent Nivolumab infusion must complete least 6 week randomization . The subject must recover reversible acute toxic effect ( alopecia ) ≤ Grade 1 baseline . MANDATORY archival tumor tissue ( prior treatment single agent Nivolumab ) must identify prior registration obtain screening period . Confirmation acquisition occur prior C1D1 treatment . Unavailability tissue render subject ineligible study . Biopsy excisional , incisional core needle . Fine needle aspiration insufficient . Sample requirement FFPE block + 1 H &amp; E stain slide 25 unstained slide + 1 H &amp; E stain slide . MANDATORY biopsy registration prior C1D1 treatment : Primary tumor metastatic lesion must amenable biopsy registration prior C1D1 treatment PDL1 status correlative study . Biopsy excisional , incisional core needle . Fine needle aspiration insufficient . Women childbearing potential ( WOCBP ) must negative serum pregnancy test within 14 day prior registration . These woman must also negative serum urine pregnancy test ( minimum sensitivity 25 IU/L equivalent unit HCG ) within 24 hour prior start Nivolumab every 6 week thereafter . NOTE : Women consider child bear potential unless surgically sterile ( undergone hysterectomy , bilateral tubal ligation , bilateral oophorectomy ) postmenopausal . Menopause define clinically 12 month amenorrhea woman 45 absence biological physiological cause . In addition , woman age 62 must document serum follicle stimulate hormone ( FSH ) level le 40 mIU/mL . Women childbearing potential must willing abstain heterosexual activity use 2 form effective method contraception time inform consent 5 month treatment discontinuation . The two contraception method comprise two barrier method , barrier method plus hormonal method . Women breast feed time inform consent 5 month last dose study treatment . Men sexually active WOCBP must use contraceptive method failure rate le 1 % per year . Men receive Nivolumab sexually active WOCBP instruct adhere contraception period 7 month last dose investigational product . As determined enrol physician protocol designee , ability subject understand comply study procedure entire length study Subjects meeting criterion may participate study : Prior treatment docetaxel . Previous autoimmune complication nivolumab require discontinuation therapy treatment steroid ( ongoing treatment 10 mg prednisone steroid equivalent daily , exclude inhaled topical steroid ) . Previous discontinuation Nivolumab due adverse event . Prior treatment antiPD1 , antiPDL1 , antiPDL2 , antiCD137 , antiCTLA4 antibody ( include ipilimumab antibody drug specifically target Tcell costimulation checkpoint pathway ) . Exception : nivolumab . Any serious uncontrolled medical disorder active infection would impair ability subject receive protocol therapy . Pregnant breastfeeding ( NOTE : breast milk store future use mother treat study ) . Known additional malignancy active and/or progressive requiring treatment ; exception include basal cell squamous cell skin cancer , situ cervical bladder cancer , cancer subject diseasefree least five year . Active central nervous system ( CNS ) metastases . Subjects brain metastasis eligible metastasis treat magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) evidence progression [ low minimum 4 week ] treatment complete within 28 day prior first dose nivolumab administration . There must also requirement immunosuppressive dos systemic corticosteroid ( &gt; 10 mg/day prednisone equivalent ) least 2 week prior study drug administration . Treatment investigational drug within 30 day prior registration . Subjects whose tumor express EGFR mutation exon 19 21 , ALK rearrangement , ROS1 rearrangement still FDA approve targeted agent available treatment . Subjects active recent history know suspect autoimmune disease recent history syndrome require systemic corticosteroids/immunosuppressive medication EXCEPT syndrome would expect recur absence external trigger .
