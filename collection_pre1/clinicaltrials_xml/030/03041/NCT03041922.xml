	<brief_title>Estimation Changes Soft Tissue Rigidity Buttocks Sitting Under Weight Bearing Compared Sitting Without Weight Bearing</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The purpose current new research check whether Ultrasound device use tool assess elasticity soft tissue buttock measure elasticity tissue without bear weight healthy population set standard normal value . The far purpose research use ultrasound device predict development pressure ulcer . Population Methods : In study , Up 15 healthy people participate . Each participant pas ultrasound scan buttock , lie sit chair design purpose research signing inform consent form . The process : 1 . The participant lie stomach bed determine location muscle mark marker.By ultrasound , investigator measure thickness fat muscle tissue Ischial Tuberosity ( ITs ) skin . 2 . The participant sits without bear weight chair build study , seat construct five strap . Non-weight bearing test strap far test area , transducer place marked place , thickness elasticity muscle tissue fat measure . 3 . The participant sits bear weight chair . weight bear test strap close test area , transducer place marked place , thickness elasticity muscle tissue fat measure . After measure elasticity soft tissue , data analyze order define range difference elasticity without weight bearing .</detailed_description>
