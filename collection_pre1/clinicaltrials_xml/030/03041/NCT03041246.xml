	<detailed_description>Pregnancy vaginal delivery consider main risk factor damage pelvic floor various degree , start mild stress incontinence fool fecal incontinence well pelvic pain urination difficulty . There various way measure strength pelvic floor evaluate functional problem . Measured strength pelvic floor muscle physical examination accord Oxford Grading Scale ( scale 0-5 ) well use Perineometer device , equally efficient well correlate . Other modality use surface electro myography ( EMG ) , present level muscle electrical activity expiration volume strength pelvic floor muscle also positively correlated strength pelvic floor . Recent study present dysfunction pelvic floor pregnancy well postpartum period use pelvic floor disability index 20 ( PFDI20 ) questionnaire validate Hebrew . Ample knowledge exist efficacy physiotherapy exercise improvement pelvic floor function strength , however , prolong continuous exercise need achieve good result well compliance perseverance . The long-term effect unwieldly . Manual mobilization pelvic floor well-known treatment modality . However literature regard effect technique sparse . A recent series case report present immediate major improvement pelvic floor dysfunction manual mobilization . The peripartum period critical function pelvic floor however yield manual therapy function strength pelvic floor evaluate pregnant woman . We hypothesize manual therapy improve strength function pelvic floor within short time span objectively measured common well used parameter The aim study analyze influence pelvic floor fascial mobilization ( PFFM ) function strength pelvic floor muscle well parameter presume influenced strength pelvic floor pregnant woman Materials methods The study involve number phase : Phase one : Screening enrollment patient Women follow high risk pregnancy clinic Sheba medical center , carry singleton pregnancy age 20-45 year old 2nd 4th delivery ( primiparous multiparous woman ) examine follow parameter : demographic medical data , focus interview symptom pelvic floor dysfunction include urination fecal function well pelvic floor pain , manual assessment accord Oxford grade scale perform , strength pelvic floor measure use Perineometer ( Peritron 'AV ' Combined Anal &amp; Vaginal Perineometer NEW MODEL ) . Other parameter measure include : mobilization pelvic-femoral joint , Forced expiratory volume 1 ( FEV1 ) ( connection show FEV1 , intraabdominal pressure strength pelvic floor , assessment vocal quality ( analyzed communication clinician , repeat assessment perform two week 4 week , estimate assessment time - 20 Min ) 80 woman expect enrolled . Phase Two Women fulfill one follow parameter enrol second phase study . ( n=40 ) 1 . Oxford grade scale ≤3/5 2 . Pelvic floor strength assess perineometer≤ 30 cm/h20 3 . Clinical symptom urine , flatus fecal incontinence 4 . Pelvic floor , hip joint pelvic joint pain Randomization perform one two group : Group A-Control group ( n=20 ) Group B-Study group ( n=20 ) Guidance towards exercise strengthen pelvic floor provide group . Study group treat manually pelvic floor two session two week apart . The manual manipulation pelvic floor involve intra vaginal superficial well pelvic skin area pressure point . The manipulation involve cervix uterus rectum . Each session last one hour Both group assess ultrasound blood flow middle cerebral artery , umbilical artery uterine artery part parameter may show benefit fetus due pelvic floor mobilization . Reassessment woman repeat treatment study group perform two four week primary assessment . The study perform high risk pregnancy clinic Sheba medical center . Women enrol voluntarily financial benefit .</detailed_description>
