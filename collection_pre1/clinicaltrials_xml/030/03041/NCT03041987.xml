	<detailed_description>The study multicenter prospective cohort study , aim explore underlie mechanism chronic kidney disease progression association adverse consequence . The study establish baseline cohort 5000 Chinese pre-dialysis chronic kidney disease patient , follow death dropout start renal replacement therapy . The follow-up conduct least 5 year . Their clinical information biomaterials collect baseline annually follow-up . The baseline visit include follow item : detailed demographic ; socioeconomic health care service information ; medical family history ; medication history ; questionnaires concern quality life , health behavior , depressive anxiety symptom , cognitive function , physical activity . Anthropometric measure ( height , weight , waist circumference , hip circumference , rest blood pressure , heart rate , grip strength , 15-feet measure walk ) also collect . The laboratory parameter chemistry test , intact parathyroid hormone , 24-hour urine electrolyte , protein creatinine ratio , albumin creatinine ratio also collect participant measured central laboratory . After baseline visit , participant return annually follow-up visit evaluation . The evaluate item follow-up visit similar baseline visit , sample collection . The principal clinical outcome study broadly categorize renal disease event , cardiovascular event , death . Renal disease event include incident end stage renal disease significant loss renal function.Cardiovascular event include acute myocardial infarction , unstable angina , hospitalization congestive heart failure , incident serious cardiac arrhythmia , cerebrovascular event , peripheral vascular disease . Death clarify cardiac , cerebrovascular , renal , others , unknown .</detailed_description>
