	<brief_title>Decreasing Antibiotic Use Infants With Suspected Ventilator-associated Infection</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>In 2011 Centers Disease Control ( CDC ) estimate antibiotic-resistant infection result $ 20 billion excess healthcare cost 100,000 unnecessary death U.S. alone . Ventilator-associated infection ( VAI ) commonly diagnose hospital-acquired infection pediatric intensive care unit ( PICU ) account half antibiotic use . We believe diagnosis often error much antibiotic use unnecessary . Initiating broad-spectrum antibiotic routine VAI infection suspect child mechanical ventilation , data show culture negative 48-72 hour antibiotic frequently still continue base identification bacteria respiratory secretion culture . The investigator previously show , however , identification bacteria respiratory secretion culture common asymptomatic child continue antibiotic basis `` positive '' respiratory secretion culture associate short hospital stay improve survival . Antibiotics benign . Antibiotics expensive , disproportionate adverse effect young child , often require placement catheter potential source infection , overuse associate increase resistance worldwide . Antibiotic exposure young child associate increase risk obesity , type 1 2 diabetes , inflammatory bowel disease , celiac disease , allergy , asthma . Mouse study find early antibiotic exposure disrupts development early-life gut bacterial composition ( microbiome ) , lead metabolic perturbation affect fat deposition may alter normal immunologic development . There diagnostic test VAI distinguish tracheal bacterial colonization actual infection straightforward . The normal lung essentially sterile placement endotracheal tube ( ETT ) compromise lung 's ability clear aspirate secretion allows direct route bacterial contamination mouth throat . The resultant tracheal bacterial composition ( `` microbiome '' ) largely unstudied preliminary research suggest consist small number wide diversity bacteria originate mouth . Loss bacterial diversity conjunction proliferation pathological bacteria think herald conversion colonization infection . The investigator believe positive respiratory culture alone absence indicator infection insufficient justification continue antibiotic , consequently , much antibiotic use VAI unnecessary potentially harmful . To critically evaluate belief potentially decrease use unnecessary antibiotic propose follow : Aim 1 : To develop guideline ass likelihood VAI discontinue antibiotic risk judge low Hypothesis 1.1 : Using iterative process PICU doctor reach consensus criterion assess likelihood VAI discontinue antibiotic risk VAI judge low Aim 2 : To assess efficacy safety discontinue antibiotic child judge low risk VAI Hypothesis 2.1 : Discontinuing antibiotic 48-72 hour child judge low risk VAI result few total day antibiotic difference survival , number subsequent infection episode , duration need mechanical ventilation length stay PICU compare care prior implementation guideline . Aim 3 : To describe longitudinal change tracheal bacterial composition ( `` microbiome '' ) child mechanical ventilation Hypothesis 3.1 : Loss diversity tracheal microbiome predate clinical sign symptom VAI . Hypothesis 3.2 : Emergence dominant bacterial pathogen tracheal microbiome associate clinical sign symptom VAI . Decreasing unnecessary antibiotic use important implication public health . Pediatric intensive care medicine run effective antibiotic also expose child antibiotic risk , many begin understood . Avoidance unnecessary antibiotic exposure young child critical would facilitate rational guideline assessment risk appropriate treatment suspect VAI . As VAI common reason antibiotic use PICU , obvious target careful antibiotic stewardship . Better understand normal tracheal microbiome placement endotracheal tube would also inform future decision regard appropriate antibiotic use VAI suspect . The effective mean decrease antibiotic resistance avoidance unnecessary use .</detailed_description>
