	<detailed_description>Shoulder dislocation prevalent dislocation frequency 0.5 % -1.7 % among population , require reduction medical staff emergency room ( ER ) . Reduction procedure often painful require level sedation , analgesia , muscle relaxation completeness . Several sedation protocol reduction maneuver describe literature , institution guide protocol optimize patient comfort safety . The literature describe multiple sedative agent Propofol , Etomidate , Midazolam , Fentanyl , etc . In emergency department ( ED ) Tel Aviv Medical Center ( TLVMC ) , sedation protocol contain Midazolam Ketamine main sedative analgesic agent . Sedation without risk . Known complication respiratory depression , aspiration , hemodynamic instability . These complication seem prevalent patient decrease cardio-respiratory reserve , elderly , morbid obese , obstructive sleep apnea ( OSA ) , chronic obstructive pulmonary disease ( COPD ) congestive heart failure ( CHF ) patient . In addition , sedation require resource facility occupy equipment monitoring vitals , oxygen supply source , capnography human resource include medical staff certify provide sedation handle possible complication nursing staff supervise patient throughout procedure admission release home ER . The ED TLVMC active busy throughout day . Sedation condition create real challenge medical team . This translated shortage manpower equipment availability time need care patient . Such atmosphere create huge burden medical team end treatment insufficiency patient safety failure . Recently , several new publication publish regard implementation peripheral nerve block ( PNB ) US guidance analgesia painful orthopedic procedure ER . Implementation PNB pain management orthopedic procedure ER might constitute theoretical advantage sedation . Interscalene block ( ISCB ) effective tool use shoulder surgery . However , limited data performance US guide ISCB shoulder dislocation reduction 's comparison analgesic modalities.Only one study date compare sedation v . US guide ISCB shoulder dislocation reduction procedure ER . This study show patient receive ISCB short length stay ER require less supervision medical intervention medical team . Both US guide ISCB sedation shoulder dislocation procedure perform TLVMC . However study do evaluate determine one analgesic modality advantage . Objectives : Comparison two common analgesic method , US guide ISCB vs.sedation , shoulder dislocation reduction ER TLVMC . Methods Materials Study Design : This prospective , randomize , interventional non-blinded study two arms- US guide ISCB group Sedation group . The sedation conduct orthopedic physician certify perform sedation US guide ISCB conduct anesthesiologist least one year experience preform regional anesthesia use US guidance . Sample Size : The study include 70 subject - 35 group . In order compensate dropout aim recruitment 90 subject . Statistical Analysis : Quantitative data normal distribution evaluate use t-test independent sample . In case assumption parametric test hold true , quantitative data evaluate use a- parametric Mann-Whitney test . Quantitative variable present mean standard deviation . Dichotomous data evaluate use chi-square test . Fischer exact test use 20 % expect observation less 5 expect observation less 2 . Categorical data present number case percent . Multivariate logistic regression analysis use primary outcome order determine independent risk factor . The data include multivariate logistic regression model clinical significance accord investigator clinical judgment data find Pv &lt; 0.1 univariate analysis . A Pv 0.05 consider significant .</detailed_description>
