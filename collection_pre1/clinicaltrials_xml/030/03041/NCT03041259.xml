	<brief_title>Revascularization Stenosed Vessels Using Optimized Treatment Rejuveinix Reversing Endothelial Dysfunction</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This study prospective , randomize , double-blind , multi-center study , compare MAE WIQ rate historical control evaluate safety efficacy Rejuveinix treatment patient present symptom define Rutherford categories 4 , 5 , 6 , undergone successful infrainguinal percutaneous intervention within femoral , femoral-popliteal , popliteal , peroneal , and/or tibial artery . Treatment ankle permit ( e.g . pedal artery ) . This intervention must successful define ≤ 30 % stenosis determine angiographic duplex ultrasound . Preclinical study support Rejuveinix acute perfusion property potential provide synergistic benefit patient undergo current standard care interventional procedure . Following endovascular intervention , one target vessels/lesions , use FDA clear technology , bare metal stent , angioplasty , and/or atherectomy , patient receive Rejuveinix adjunct therapy . Enrolled subject assign randomly one two group . Group A receive two 20 mL treatment Rejuveinix per week plus one placebo treatment per week comprise 20 mL 0.9 % saline . A dye added placebo ; dye select one found Orange Book . Group B receive three treatment Rejuveinix per week . Each 20 mL treatment combine 100 mL 0.9 % saline administer via intravenous ( IV ) injection course minimum 30 minute . The study trial occur 12 one-week cycle washout period two day cycle ( one-week cycle include either 2 3 Rejuveinix treatment depend randomize group ) . Reven also assess result calculate four 21-day cycle allow direct comparison preclinical result . The goal study demonstrate Rejuveinix treatment adjunctive therapy non-inferior historical control term patient safety , measure MAE rate , efficacy , assess modify WIQ .</detailed_description>
