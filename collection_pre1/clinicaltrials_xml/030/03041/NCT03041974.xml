	<detailed_description>During conservation red blood cell concentrate , red blood cell ( RBCs ) undergo biochemical morphological change well describe , collectively term `` storage lesion `` . The exact effect lesion term beneficial deleterious implication recipient remain elucidated . However , several retrospective study target population suggest increase duration RBC conservation could lead increase morbidity mortality transfuse patient . The multicenter , prospective trial ABLE ( Age Blood Evaluation , ISRCTN44878718 ) aim evaluate randomise clinical trial , impact age transfuse RBC concentrate several outcomes critical care patient . Among modification RBCs undergo storage , generation microparticles red blood cellsRBCs residual platelet present blood concentrate never evaluate prospective clinical study . It report number red cell-derived microparticles ( RMPs ) present store blood increase storage duration . In vivo , microparticles MPs appear increasingly involved disease process , notably due pro-inflammatory pro-coagulant effect . Furthermore , show antigen Rhesus group express RBC derive microparticles , investigative team show microparticles derive elsewhere ( endothelial cell ) capable activate cell important induction immune response ( dendritic cell ) . Thus , transfuse red blood cell derive microparticles could participate post-transfusional alloimmunization may also evaluate study . The aim IMIB study ( 1 ) quantify red cell- platelet-derived microparticles MPs RBC concentrate , ( 2 ) evaluate impact quantity transfuse microparticles ( MPs ) survival several outcome patient enrol ABLE trial France . Other aims investigate relationship number microparticles RBC unit ( 1 ) age RBC , ( 2 ) donor characteristic , ( 3 ) procedure use prepare blood product ( define potential new `` lesion storage '' marker ) .</detailed_description>
