	<brief_summary>The goal clinical research study learn Jakafi ( ruxolitinib ) delay , low amount therapy may need future , possibly eliminate need future therapy recently diagnose CLL patient .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Administration Jakafi ( Ruxolitinib ) Patients With High-Risk Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia ( CLL )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>All study visit take place MD Anderson . If convenient participant , participant may participant 's physical exam routine blood draw complete local lab doctor 's office . The result tests/procedures sent study doctor review . This option discuss participant . Otherwise , participant do study visit MD Anderson . Before participant start take ruxolitinib : - Blood ( 2 teaspoon ) draw cytokine test special kind test tell researcher change pathways help CLL cell grow . This call B-cell receptor test . Cytokines protein may affect immune system . - Participant CT scan check status disease . - Participant complete 2 questionnaire participant 's symptom . This take 10 minute complete . - If participant become pregnant , blood ( 1 teaspoon ) and/or urine collect pregnancy test . Every 1-2 month every time participant come MD Anderson part participant 's routine care : - Participant physical exam . - Blood ( 2 teaspoon ) draw routine test . If need , blood draw may repeat every 2-4 week . At 3 month participant start treatment : - Blood ( 2 teaspoon ) draw cytokine test B-cell receptor test . - Participant complete 2 questionnaire participant 's symptom . This take 10 minute complete . About 6-8 month participant start treatment : - Participant physical exam . - Participant bone marrow aspiration check status disease . To collect bone marrow aspirate , area hip site numb anesthetic , small amount bone marrow withdrawn large needle . - Participant CT scan . Follow-Up : - About 30 day participant 's last dose ruxolitinib , blood ( abut 2 teaspoon ) draw routine test . - At Day 30 Follow-Up : If participant become pregnant , blood ( 1 teaspoon ) and/or urine collect pregnancy test . Participant CT scan . This investigational study . Ruxolitinib FDA approve commercially available treatment myelofibrosis ( MF ) . It consider investigational use ruxolitinib treat CLL . The study doctor explain study drug design work . Up 40 participant take part study . All enrol MD Anderson .</detailed_description>
