	<detailed_description>Randomized , double-blinded , single-center , split body split face , use study multiple exposures natural sunlight condition healthy volunteer . Each subject instruct self-apply test product designate exposure body/face site normally would sunburn protection beach . Exposure sit limited duration study face , neck , arm include shoulder legs top knee . Each two product apply exclusively exposure site designate side body duration study . Product label include color cod indicator application side standard sunscreen drug fact label contain usage direction . The difference level sunburn ( erythema ) protection afford level UV ( Ultraviolet ) induce pigmentation ( melanogenesis ) response mediate typical usage SPF 50+ SPF 100+ sunscreen assess clinical evaluation . Erythema melanogenic response also evaluate fix body site location diffuse reflectance spectroscopy ( DRS ) chromameter assessment . Subject product usage track record tube weight product use . Sunlight exposure behavior track subject activity diary . Solar ultraviolet radiation condition record centralized stationary radiometer . Erythema protection afford two product base bilateral sunburn comparison match exposure site erythema score exposure area . Success criterion demonstration superior sunburn protection SPF 100+ compare SPF 50+ indicate less sunburn SPF 100+ side SPF 50+ side ( base bilateral sunburn comparison ) . Mediation UV induce pigmentation response afford two product base bilateral pigmentation comparison match exposure site chromameter DRS measurement . All subject evaluate baseline begin day .</detailed_description>
