	<brief_summary>Mechanical ventilation , spite life-saving technique , also induce lung injury ( VILI ) mediate inflammatory response , thus profound impact course critically ill patient . Ventilatory strategy aim minimize VILI reduce mortality rate . Patients suffer cardiogenic pulmonary edema may need venoarterial extracorporeal oxygenation , time mechanically ventilate . The objective study analyze change induce use utraprotective ventilatory strategy inflammatory lung response patient impact outcome .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Ultra Protective Ventilation During Venoarterial Extracorporeal Membrane Oxygenation ( UPV-ECMO )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Mechanical ventilation cornerstone critically-ill patient support , provide well gas exchange condition respiratory muscle rest . Providing life-support technique may harmful lung tissue , last decade research effort focus minimize ventilator-induced lung injury ( VILI ) . Knowledge regard mechanisms injury lead change clinical practice , consist application positive end-expiratory pressure ( PEEP ) use low tidal volume , give rise strategy know `` protective ventilation '' . Moreover , use extracorporeal membrane oxygenation ( ECMO ) techniques contributes maintain adequate gas exchange lung damage resolution . A tidal volume range 6 ml/Kg ideal body weight , reasonable level PEEP standard care patient ARDS . However , optimal level tidal volume PEEP completely establish . On side , decrease tidal volume 6 ml/Kg face problem . The role so-called `` ultraprotective '' approach , extracorporeal support require reduce tidal volume 3 ml/kg less , although feasible , currently research . During venoarterial ECMO , blood remove vessel pump circuit oxygenate CO2 remove ; finally , blood return arterial circulation . The development new circuit device make therapy become safer useful , improve outcome application widespread many center world . One ECMO advantage carbon dioxide removal , allow reduce tidal volume 6 ml/kg . Ultraprotective strategy 3 ml/kg demonstrate feasible , additional benefit strategy demonstrate . Therefore , study , patient suffer cardiogenic pulmonary edema require ECMO mechanical ventilation submit ultraprotective ventilator strategy . Lung inflammatory response measure intervention , order evaluate impact subset patient .</detailed_description>
