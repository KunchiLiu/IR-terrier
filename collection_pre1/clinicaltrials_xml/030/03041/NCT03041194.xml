	<detailed_description>Interstitial cystitis painful bladder syndrome condition chronic often debilitating nature . Interstitial cystitis commonly define symptom urinary urgency frequency associate pelvic pain . Around one million men woman United States Europe suffer condition . The diagnosis Interstitial Cystitis one exclusion base cystoscopy finding clinical symptom . Common symptoms Interstitial Cystitis include urinary frequency , urinary urgency , dysuria , pain low abdominal region , bladder , vagina , urethra , perineum . Women age 40 60 commonly affect Interstitial Cystitis . In Nurses ' Healthy Study I II prevalence Interstitial Cystitis 52-67 individual 100,000 . There single cause Interstitial Cystitis however , several known theory cause Interstitial Cystitis . A popular hypothesis defect glycosaminoglycan layer bladder epithelium allow leakage absorption urinary solute . The major solute responsible cause bladder symptom epithelium injured potassium . The long held notion patient Interstitial Cystitis avoid acidic food . This logic largely base anecdotal data questionnaire food , beverage supplement increase symptom . Controversy exist Interstitial Cystitis diet restrict many food necessary attempt decrease Interstitial Cystitis symptom .
