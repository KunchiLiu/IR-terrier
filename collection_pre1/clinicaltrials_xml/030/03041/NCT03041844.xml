	<brief_title>Enhanced Ultrasound Treatment Chronic Wounds With Monitoring Healing Quality Life Outcomes</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The two common type chronic wound venous ulcer ( VUs ) diabetic ulcer ( DUs ) . The investigator conduct first double-blind randomize control trial ( RCT ) test effect low-frequency , low-intensity ( LFLI ) ultrasound ( US ) chronic wound heal health relate quality life ( HRQOL ) high statistical confidence ( Î± &lt; 0.05 , power &gt; 0.90 , n=60 VUs , n=60 DUs ) . The investigator ' approach combine active therapy non-invasive diagnostic monitoring wound hemodynamics throughout treatment cycle , include analysis impact nutritional status inflammation wound closure . There several innovative aspect work . Specifically , ( 1 ) The lightweight , battery-powered applicator first potentially wearable ultrasound wound therapy device safe apply extend period time . ( 2 ) The applicator actively promote heal , fundamentally different commercial ultrasonic system remove necrotic tissue . ( 3 ) The study approach link LFLI US exposure change wind hemodynamics HRQOL , potential enable personalize medicine . ( 4 ) The analysis patient nutritional systemic inflammatory status may enable treatment customization identify patient likely benefit LFLI US therapy . ( 5 ) The study approach incorporate disease-specific generic measure HRQOL , unique therapeutic ultrasound RCT . The low-frequency , low-intensity ( 20 kHz , &lt; 100 mW/cm2 spatial peak-temporal peak ) , portable ultrasound applicator lightweight ( &lt; 25g ) permit safe clinically pragmatic wound treatment . The field parameter US device previously optimize venous ulcer , three recent pilot clinical human study ( VUs : n=20 , n=25 ; DUs : n=10 ) demonstrate treatment improve heal 15 % per week compare sham treatment . The investigator therefore anticipate treatment accelerate closure chronic wound , hypothesize ( 1 ) LFLI US improve generic disease-specific HRQOL score , ( 2 ) LFLI US activate beneficial change microvasculature wound surround tissue , ( 3 ) individual poor nutrition high level inflammation delay wound heal . The specific aim : ( 1 ) Assess effect LFLI US VUs DUs measure wound closure primary endpoint generic disease-specific HRQOL secondary endpoint . ( 2 ) Monitor effect LFLI US wound perfusion oxygenation use non-invasive optical method , ( 3 ) Determine impact nutritional status inflammation closure DUs VUs . Overall , work validate LFLI US safe , portable , cost-effective therapy chronic wound . This important new therapy improve clinical paradigm wound management urgently need . Over long-term , study finding may enable development personalize wound treatment regimen across care setting .</detailed_description>
