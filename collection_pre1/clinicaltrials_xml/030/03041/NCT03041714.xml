	<brief_summary>Background : Essential tremor person tremor , neurological symptom . Dystonic tremor person also dystonia . Dystonia condition muscle contraction cause change posture . Researchers fully know area brain cause tremor , type differ . They also know test identify difference . Objective : To look difference essential tremor dystonic tremor . Eligibility : People age 18 older without tremor Design : Participants screen medical history , physical exam , urine test . Those tremor complete questionnaire tremor affect . The screening study visit do day separate day . Participants 1 2 study visit . These include magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) tremor test . For MRI , participant lie table slide cylinder take picture . Sensors skin measure breathing , heart rate , muscle activity . This take 2 hour . Tremor test include transcranial magnetic stimulation ( TMS ) , electrical stimulation finger , movement task , record tremor movement . For TMS , two wire coil hold scalp brief magnetic field produce . A brief electrical current pas coil . For test , small sticky pad electrode put skin . Participants move hand hear sound . They get weak electrical shock finger . These test take 3-4 hour . Participants take part either part study .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Neurophysiologic Study Patient With Essential Tremor Dystonic Tremor</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Objectives : &lt; TAB &gt; To explore neurophysiological difference patient essential tremor ( ET ) dystonic tremor ( DT ) . Sample Size Population : &lt; TAB &gt; We plan recruit 26 healthy volunteer ( HVs ) , 26 patient ET , 26 patient dystonic tremor Movement Disorders Botulinum Toxin ( BoNT ) clinic HMCS . The dystonic tremor group divide 2 subgroup : pure dystonic tremor ( pDT ) , patient dystonia tremor limb , tremor associate dystonia ( TAWD ) , patient isolate tremor dystonia elsewhere . We plan enroll 13 patient pDT 13 TAWD . We plan recruit total 20 participant include patient ET , DT HVs use data protocol 10-N-0009 permit . All neurophysiologic result compare patient HVs . Design : Subjects come NIH least one study visit . All subject undergo screen visit include take medical history physical examination . Then patient score clinically tremor ET DT dystonia DT . All subject series transcranial magnetic stimulation ( TMS ) study . TMS-induced electromyographic ( EMG ) activity hand forearm muscle record motor evoke potential ( MEPs ) . Pyramidal threshold determine inion stimulation . Then , paired-pulse stimulation cerebellum follow motor cortex perform rest tonic activation hand muscle . Only patient recording tremor rest , postural holding , action specific task write use accelerometry EMG . Additionally , single TMS deliver motor cortex cerebellum patient elicit tremor order explore effect TMS tremor . All subject ( HVs ET , DT ) test threshold discriminate somatosensory stimulation performance quick ballistic movement . All subject also undergo magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) study include structural MRI , rest state functional MRI ( rsfMRI ) , diffusion tensor imaging ( DTI ) , MR spectroscopy . The subject either undergo MRI study visit part experiment separately . Outcome measurement : The various neurophysiological result include data TMS experiment , tremor analysis , threshold temporal discrimination , ballistic movement MRI experiment . These result compare HVs patient group .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>INCLUSION CRITERIA : Must 18 year old Fulfill diagnostic criterion essential tremor , pure dystonic tremor tremor associate dystonia , define Consensus Statement Movement Disorder Society Tremor , 1998 . We recruit patient display hand tremor group follow : Hand tremor patient ET group . Dystonic hand tremor patient pDT group . Cervical dystonia ( CD ) patient spasmodic dysphonia hand tremor without clinical evidence hand dystonia TAWD group . For HVs : absence dystonia neurological disorder effect motor sensory system . Ability give inform consent . Ability comply study procedure , base judgment investigator ( ) . Agree drink caffeine alcohol 48 hour participate protocol . EXCLUSION CRITERIA : Either follow exclude patient study : Secondary form dystonia tremor , include tardive dyskinesia . Botulinum toxin treatment &lt; 3 month prior visit . Any following exclude patient healthy control study : Employees and/or staff NINDS Has use illegal drug within past 6 month base history . The intent exclude drug use may affect study result . Participants appear intoxicated time test reschedule . Has 7 alcoholic drink week case woman 14 alcoholic drink week case man . Abnormal finding neurologic exam ( tremor dystonia patient group ) Has brain tumor , stroke , head trauma , epilepsy history seizure . Has major depression major mental disorder ( axis I disorder ) Has neurologic disorder tremor dystonia Has head injury loss consciousness second . Has metal body , cardiac pacemaker , brain stimulator , shrapnel , surgical metal , clip brain , cochlear implant , metal fragment eye , Pregnancy lactation For patient currently take primidone , anticholinergic benzodiazepine . For MRI scanning , unable lie flat back expect length study 3 hour . For MRI scanning , uncomfortable small space 3 hour .</criteria>
