	<brief_title>Corneal Collagen Crosslinking Increase Resistance Support Graft KPro Type I Against Corneal Melting</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The Boston type 1 keratoprosthesis ( KPro ) artificial cornea restores clarity visual axis . It indicate patient conventional corneal transplantation offer low probability success . Several innovation lead improved outcome follow implantation KPro . However , retention KPro vary 83 100 % recent series . The extrusion KPro usually cause melt corneal tissue ( keratolysis sterile necrosis ) use support . This corneal melt mediate enzyme class matrix metalloproteinases ( MMP ) . Several different type insult may lead excess enzyme . Chronic inflammation ocular surface undoubtedly best recognize risk factor . Indeed , autoimmune disease Stevens-Johnson syndrome , Lyell syndrome ( toxic epidermal necrolysis , TENS ) mucous membrane pemphigoid , high rate corneal melt post KPro . Moreover , development retroprosthetic membrane recently recognize risk factor melt . Furthermore , dryness corneal epithelium , due insufficient tear production alteration blink reflex eye , also lead overexpression MMP . Finally , infectious keratitis lead significant thinning corneal tissue , even infectious process resolve . Corneal collagen cross-linking technique approve Health Canada strengthen biomechanical property cornea . The crosslinked corneas become resistant collagenase MMP . The use crosslinked corneal graft support KPro interest approach prevention corneal melting . A prospective , randomize , control double-blind study conduct patient receive Kpro Centre Hospitalier de l'Université de Montréal . Forty patient randomize two group , half receive KPro crosslinked graft-support , half receive usual graft-support . Patients meet surgeon discus risk , benefit KPro type I alternative treatment . Patients accept KPro surgery , informed nature course study offer participate study . The Eye bank Canada manage randomization maintain code identify crosslinked cornea untreated cornea , keep surgeon patient blind . Randomization do free application ( http : //www.randomizer.org/form.htm ) . A series 10 number generate . Even number indicate crosslinked cornea odd number indicate non-crosslinked cornea . The order digits increase subject enrol study . The procedure corneal collagen crosslinking perform Eye Bank Canada similar procedure treatment keratoconus . Under sterile condition , corneo-scleral button inspect meet standard care . If patient randomize crosslinked group , cornea treat crosslinking describe . If patient randomize control group , cornea treat crosslink deepithelialized soak riboflavin drop describe . The surgeon receive graft operate accord standard procedure . The KPro surgery postoperative care perform standard way thus study group . Postoperative follow hold 1 day , 1 week , 2 week , 1 month 3 month continue subsequently every 2-4 month depend judgment surgeon . These visit include measurement visual acuity intraocular pressure full slit-lamp examination . In particular , presence corneal melting , leakage aqueous humor , corneal infection extrusion note . Meanwhile , image allow quantification thickness cornea graft-support ( optical coherence tomography anterior segment ) perform least first three month postoperative . This imaging repeat 1 , 2 5 year . The prevalence various complication ( melt , leak , infection , extrusion ) compare two group Fischer exact test . Also , time surgery occurrence complication compare use Student test . Finally , survival analysis Kaplan-Meier perform 1 ) occurrence corneal melt 2 ) maintain visual acuity great 20/200 .</detailed_description>
