	<brief_summary>PET ( Positron Emission Tomography ) image use help make patient management decision stag treatment assessment , often cancer diagnosis . Improper injection PET tracer ( dye ) may occur approximately 15 % time . This known extravasation infiltration , compromise doctor 's ability read PET image . Often , site tracer inject vein ( usually inside elbow ) image take , read physician unaware extravasation infiltration occur . Technology exist capture time activity curve ( amount tracer location period time ) PET tracer uptake period ( usually tracer inject , tracer circulate 60 minute prior image ) , enable physician accurately detect extravasation infiltration . This information currently unavailable physician read routine PET/CT ( compute tomography ) scan . Time activity curve information gather sensor circulation period appear match brief picture take approximately 70 minute tracer injection . This study determine time activity curve correspond PET image injection site take tracer uptake period . If time activity curve correspond PET image , use determine tracer properly inject . If improper injection , clinician alert fact interpret image additional information .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>PET ( Positron Emission Tomography ) image use help make patient management decision stag treatment assessment , often cancer diagnosis . Improper injection PET tracer ( dye ) may occur approximately 15 % time . This known extravasation infiltration , compromise doctor 's ability read PET image . Often , site tracer inject vein ( usually inside elbow ) image take , read physician unaware extravasation infiltration occur . Technology exist capture time activity curve ( amount tracer location period time ) PET tracer uptake period ( usually tracer inject , tracer circulate 60 minute prior image ) , enable physician accurately detect extravasation . This information currently unavailable physician read routine PET/CT scan . Time activity curve information gather sensor circulation period appear match brief picture take approximately 70 minute tracer injection . This study determine time activity curve correspond PET image injection site take tracer uptake period . If time activity curve correspond PET image , use determine tracer properly inject . If improper injection , clinician alert fact interpret image additional information . In oncology , whole-body PET/CT typically perform head pelvic floor ( eyes thigh ) . The use term whole-body mislead commonly use field view ( FOV ) arms-up whole-body PET/CT protocols include base skull upper thigh include brain , skull , large portion upper low extremity . In FOV , commonly use site injection , namely antecubital fossa ( inside elbow ) , frequently include imaging field . In Frontiers Oncology article , Osman also determine base commonly use FOV PET/CT center , infiltration present , may unnoticed clinician approximately 31 % case . Lucerno Dynamics , privately hold company North Carolina , also discover static image may incapable report quality FDG administration ~60 minute uptake period . Lucerno 's system use two investigational study two center . At one center , system use 8 patient total 15 scan . At center , system use 40 patient total 85 scan . Similar rate infiltration find described publish article . Based experience , Lucerno find infiltration partially resolve uptake period , even visible PET image , image may reveal extent infiltration . This could severely negatively impact research therapy decision thus patient outcome . The Lucerno device ( Lucerno ID ) nonsignificant risk device add 2-3 minute current standard care PET/CT scan process . Lucerno ID sensor apply patient 's skin injection radiotracer remove FDG uptake period prior PET/CT image process . The Lucerno ID ability identify infiltration , whether within outside FOV reviewing clinician , alert clinician patient undergoes compromise PET/CT scan due infiltration . This technology prevent patient receive additional CT radiation exposure compromise scan , save cost , improve patient outcomes ensure accurate PET scan interpretation .</detailed_description>
