	<brief_summary>Background : stroke major cause death disability . Intravenous thrombolysis mechanical thrombectomy able re-open occlude vessel save ischemic tissue death . However , recanalization occlude vessel may trigger activation detrimental molecular pathway exacerbate blood brain barrier ( BBB ) disruption , eventually determine hemorrhagic transformation ( HT ) cerebral edema ( CE ) , cause so-called `` reperfusion injury '' . There increase evidence number factor measurable circulate biomarkers , particularly metalloproteinases ( MMP ) , contribute reperfusion brain injury . Preliminary data show BBB disruption trace vivo Computed Tomography Perfusion ( CTP ) imaging . The aim study evaluate effect circulate image biomarkers relation reperfusion injury . Methods : consecutive patient present acute ischemic stroke anterior circulation territory , scoring≥7 NIHSS , candidate intravenous thrombolysis endovascular treatment , enrol one hospital centre . Circulating level pro- , anti-inflammatory , immunomodulatory factor , metalloproteinases inductors/inhibitors , factor endothelial dysfunction fibrin resistance lysis measure blood sample take patient pre-thrombolysis 24 hour thrombolysis . Biomarker level study relation CTP measure BBB permeability relation image sign reperfusion injury acute intervention , hemorrhagic transformation cerebral edema . Results : enrollment start October 2015 . As January 2017 , 70 patient include . Results expect end 2018 estimated sample size 140 patient . Using definite protocol , prospective collection data , adequate number patient assure statistically power data , study integrate clinical information image biological factor involve reperfusion injury cerebral ischemia .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Study design : This observational hospital-based study include 140 patient ischemic stroke anterior circulation within 12 hour last see well , treat either intravenous thrombolysis endovascular thrombectomy . Included patient National Institutes Health Stroke Scale ( NIHSS ) ≥7 . Both circulate biomarkers sample CT Perfusion perform acute intervention . Clinical/functional image assessment repeat 24 hour intervention 3 month stroke . Work Methodology : Stroke severity measure use NIHSS , post-stroke disability modify Rankin Scale ( mRS ) administer 3 month visit phone interview . Investigators rate hemorrhagic transformation ( HT ) grade use European Cooperative Acute Stroke Study ( ECASS II ) criterion CE accord Safe Implementation Thrombolysis Stroke-Monitoring Study ( SITS-MOST ) protocol . Cerebral image include baseline plain CT , CT angiography CT perfusion baseline . CT repeat 24 h , time clinical deterioration observe . Collection image data blind clinical laboratory data . Baseline follow CT scan assess three stroke physician ( FA , BP , VP ) presence early ischemic sign ( Alberta Stroke Programme Early CT score , hyperdensity middle cerebral artery ) , presence severity small vessel disease marker ( white matter change , preexist lacunar infarct , brain atrophy ) , presence grade HT , present . Perfusion map generate patient deconvolution-based delay-insensitive algorithm . For permeability calculation , adiabatic approximation distribute parameter analysis use . Permeability maps generate dedicated software . Recanalization rate assess 24 hour either CT angiography , Magnetic Resonance angiography transcranial doppler . In case effective recanalization ( Thrombolysis In Cerebral Infarction scale=2b/3 ) end endovascular procedure clinical improvement , recanalization reassess 24 hour . Laboratory protocol : Blood collect tubes anticoagulant , well tube without anticoagulant , start 24 h thrombolysis . Tubes centrifuge room temperature 1500 × g 15 min , supernatant store aliquot −80°C . Statistical analysis : Pearson χ2 use test significance compare categorical variable ANOVA test numeric variable . To analyze difference biomarkers level baseline 24 h , non-parametric Mann-Whitney U test use relatively large statistical variation . As main explanatory variable , use single patient 's baseline level relative pre- post-thrombolysis variation ( Δ median value ) Metalloproteinases ( MMP ) 2-3-9 Tissue Inhibitors Metalloproteinases ( TIMP ) 1-2 level , calculate accord formula : ( 24-hour post-thrombolysis MMP TIMP-pre-thrombolysis MMP TIMP ) /pre-thrombolysis MMP TIMP . Baseline level Δ value analyze relation demographic clinical feature across subgroup patient different outcome . The net effect biomarker study ( baseline , 24 h , Δ value ) outcome also estimate logistic regression ordinal model , include potentially confound covariates . Novel candidate emerge course study consider analysis In case skew distribution biomarker value , author consider possibility log-transformation data . Milestones : Phase 1 ( 6 month ) : ) Project protocol establishment ; b ) Dedicated database data collection construction ; c ) CTP protocol determination ; ) Training recruit staff Phase 2 ( 36 month ) : ) Baseline patient cohort enrollment ; b ) Imaging data collection c ) Circulating biomarker collection ; ) Follow-up assessment ( 3 month enrolment ) Phase 3 ( 6 month ) : ) Post-processing neuroimaging acquire baseline ; b ) Data completeness consistency control ; c ) Data analysis ; ) Dissemination result</detailed_description>
