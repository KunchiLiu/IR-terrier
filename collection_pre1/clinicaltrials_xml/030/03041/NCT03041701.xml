	<brief_summary>Background : Rhabdomyosarcoma ( RMS ) common soft tissue sarcoma childhood . Two type embryonal RMS ( ERMS ) alveolar RMS ( ARMS ) . Dasatinib may block over-expression certain enzyme . Ganitumab may block certain growth factor , might suppress tumor growth . This drug combination may help slow tumor growth people ERMS ARMS . Objective : To see dasatinib combine ganitumab safe shrink slow growth tumor people ERMS ARMS . Eligibility : People age ERMS ARMS respond previous treatment swallow tablet Design : Participants screen : - Medical history - Physical exam - Blood , urine , heart test - Scans/x-rays - Tissue sample : This previous surgery biopsy . - Optional biopsy : A small piece tumor remove needle . Participants ask co-enroll another protocol . Participants get drug interaction handout wallet card show food medication avoid . Participants treat cycle . The first cycle 35 day rest 28 day . Participants take dasatinib mouth daily . They get ganitumab IV every 2 week . They physical exam every 1-2 week , urine heart test cycle .

	<brief_title>Insulin-like Growth Factor 1 Receptor ( IGF-1R ) Antibody AMG479 ( Ganitumab ) Combination With Src Family Kinase ( SFK ) Inhibitor Dasatinib People With Embryonal Alveolar Rhabdomyosarcoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Background : - Rhabdomyosarcoma ( RMS ) common soft tissue sarcoma childhood . The annual incidence United States 4-7 case per million child 15 year , represent 250 new case per year . Two major histologic subtypes exist : embryonal rhabdomyosarcoma ( ERMS ) alveolar rhabdomyosarcoma ( ARMS ) , latter carry particularly poor prognosis . - Over-expression type 1 IGF receptor ( IGF-1R ) ligands observed multiple malignancy , include pediatric sarcoma , abnormal activation pathway contribute sarcoma development progression . Downstream signal cascade IGF-1R regulate tumor cell proliferation , survival , metastasis MAPK/ERK PI3K/mTOR pathway . In majority RMS , IGF-1R highly express . - Monoclonal antibody target IGF-1R interfere ligand bind decrease expression receptor cell surface internalization degradation receptor . A number test clinical setting . Results phase II trial use monotherapy monoclonal antibody IGF-1R result clinically meaningful response 10-15 % patient RMS . However , vast majority responses short-lived rapid onset resistance . - YES member SRC family tyrosine kinase ( SFKs ) , non-receptor tyrosine kinases function number signal pathway necessary cell growth , differentiation survival . Preclinical work suggest involvement YES number solid tumor type , include colon carcinoma , oral squamous cell carcinoma , glioma , pancreatic cancer , mesothelioma , RMS . - Recently , Helman lab publish preclinical work show embryonal alveolar RMS model , blockade IGF-1R result YES activation YES activation associate resistance IGF-1R blockade . In addition , combination blockade IGF-1R YES vitro result downregulation phospho-AKT cell line . Treatment block IGF-1R YES result enhance growth inhibition multiple cell line embryonal alveolar RMS vitro vivo . Objectives : Primary Objective : 1 . Phase I : To determine safe dose dasatinib give ganitumab patient relapse refractory embryonal alveolar RMS . 2 . Phase II : To determine use ganitumab plus dasatinib able associate modest fraction patient experience objective clinical response ( CR PR ) define RECIST criterion . In addition , second primary objective estimate fraction without progression 4 month . Secondary Objectives : 1 . To assess PFS patient receive combination , fraction patient SD great equal 6 month patient receive combination . 2 . To describe toxicity confirm tolerability combination ganitumab dasatinib patient relapse refractory RMS . Eligibility : - Patients must diagnosis relapsed refractory embryonal alveolar RMS , able swallow tablet , archival tissue available . - Patients must adequate performance status adequate major organ function recover acute toxicity prior therapy . Design : - This open label , single site , phase I/II study design determine ganitumab give combination dasatinib child adult relapse refractory embryonal alveolar RMS curative option exist . - In phase I portion , use standard 3 + 3 design , limit dose escalation perform define maximum tolerate dose ( MTD ) high safe dose test dasatinib give combination ganitumab patient population . - In phase II component , sixteen ( 16 ) evaluable patient , include 6 patient phase I portion treat select phase II dose , enrol rule 5 % fraction clinical response favor 30 % fraction clinical response , use one side 0.10 significance level exact test binomial proportion . In practice , fraction 16 patient objective response determine report along 80 % 95 % confidence interval . If 3 objective response 16 evaluable patient , low one-sided exact 90 % confidence interval 7.1 % , thus rule 5 % . - It anticipate approximately 8-10 patient per year may accrue onto trial . Thus , 2 3 year expect complete accrual . If actual accrual slower , would consider open trial additional site improve accrual rate . In order allow small number inevaluable patient , accrual ceiling phase II component set 18 patient . - In patient , mechanism response resistance assess analyze archival tissue expression IGF-1R , insulin receptor , IGF-2 expression phospho-YES expression , genomic sequencing ( protocol 10-C-0086 ) . Genomic sequence tumor cell tissue relative non-tumor cell whole blood profile identify genomic variance may contribute response disease progression provide understand molecular abnormality . RNA sequence conduct provide expression data give relevance DNA mutation ; Quantitative proteomics analysis conduct determine exact amount specific protein confirm expression gene correlative response disease progression . All genomic , transcriptomic , proteomic molecular analysis retrospective exploratory . - In patient great equal 12 year agree undergo biopsy tumor , provide tissue easily accessible biopsied safely minimal morbidity , mechanisms response resistance assess analyze biopsy tissue expression IGF- 1R , insulin receptor , IGF-2 expression phospho-YES expression , genomic sequencing .</detailed_description>

Patients must measurable disease , define least one lesion accurately measure least one dimension ( long diameter record nonnodal lesion short axis nodal lesion ) great equal 20 mm conventional technique great equal 10 mm spiral CT scan . Patients must able undergo appropriate imaging study monitor tumor response . Archival tissue tumor ( slide block ( block prefer ) ) must available analysis . If tissue available , patient willing undergo pretreatment biopsy may enroll . Prior Therapies : There maximum number prior medical therapy . There must curative life prolong treatment available . Patients receive IGF1R antibody inhibitor eligible , long appropriate washout period elapse ( see ) .
