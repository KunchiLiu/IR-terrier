	<detailed_description>Surgical intervention treat inguinal hernia common pediatric surgical procedure , often perform use inguinal incision . Children undergo hernia repair suffer significant degree discomfort postoperatively . A multimodal pain management approach include medication acetaminophen , non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug opioids traditionally use combination regional anesthetic technique . Regional anesthetic technique include surgical infiltration local anesthetic , caudal-epidural ( CE ) block ilioinguinal/iliohypogastric ( IIG/IHG ) nerve block . Regional anesthetic technique CE ultrasound ( US ) guide IIG/IHG well-established method show reduce use intraoperative anesthetic need post operative rescue analgesia . Traditionally , IIG/IHG nerve block complete use landmark-based approach due unpredictable block result failure rate 30 % potentially serious complication unintentional intraperitoneal injection , many anesthesiologist prefer reliable CE technique . However , CE provide excellent intraoperative anesthesia provide short duration post-operative analgesia ( 4-6 hour ) associate low limb motor block urinary retention . Recent literature demonstrate US guide IIG/IHG complete small volume local anesthetic success rate 100 % low risk complication . Furthermore evidence suggest provide increased duration postoperative analgesia pediatric patient undergo groin surgery . Finally , two publication retrospectively review complication 45000 regional anesthetic block suggest US guide peripheral nerve block ( e.g. , IIG/IHG ) favour neuraxial technique epidural caudal anesthetic due risk-benefit profile . A recent meta-analysis compare IIG/IIH block CE block child note additional comparative study require previous study compare two technique many methodological limitation include small sample size , use blind ( non-US guide ) regional anesthetic technique group patient undergo various surgical procedure ( e.g. , orchiopexy hernia repair ) despite significant difference recovery pain profile . The investigator propose complete prospective randomize single-blinded non-inferiority study evaluate compare effectiveness US guide CE block US guide IIG/IHG nerve block achieve post operative analgesia follow hernia repair . Currently , number Pediatric Anesthesiologists Alberta Children 's Hospital routinely complete IIG/IIH CE block ultrasound guidance . As part study investigator hope provide necessary knowledge ( sonoanatomy , technique ) offer supervise clinical training anesthesiologist interested participate study . While hernia repair remain common procedure , study compare use US guide CE US guide IIG/IHG . The aim study establish non-inferiority post-operative pain hospital assess Face , Leg , Activity , Cry , Consolability ( FLACC ) scale US guide IIG/IHG compare US guide CE follow hernia repair surgery . Secondary objective assess group difference need rescue analgesia hospital , analgesia administer home , postoperative pain measure within 24 hour post hospital discharge . Investigators hypothesize US guide IIG/IHG nerve block lead non-inferior objectively measure FLACC pain score ( â‰¤ 1 point FLACC scale ) post-operatively hospital relative US guide CE block inguinal hernia surgery .</detailed_description>
