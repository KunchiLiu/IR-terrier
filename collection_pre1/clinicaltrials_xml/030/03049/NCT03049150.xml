	<detailed_description>The PRE-RENAL study prognostic accuracy study test ability MALDI-MS assay predict incident acute kidney injury fracture neck femur surgery . The study aim validate finding urinary peptide panel previously develop validated cohort septic patient . Kidney injury follow surgery part severe illness important complication , delay reduce chance recovery . A reliable early test kidney injury would useful treatment prevent minimise start early possible . This study , base group medical researcher work chemist , analyse clinical urine specimens patient undergo major orthopaedic ( bone ) surgery . We explore whether pattern protein urine could use early warning kidney injury present exist test demonstrate .</detailed_description>
