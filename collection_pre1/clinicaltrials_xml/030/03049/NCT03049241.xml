	<brief_summary>Potential factor involve neuromuscular fatigue classify two category : 1 ) central factor involve central nervous system neural pathway , 2 ) peripheral factor occur within muscle beyond neuromuscular junction . In adult , show peripheral factor contribute large part fatigue induce repeat maximal contraction . However child , central factor could account development fatigue great extent . Force-generating capacity musculotendinous stiffness could two discriminatory factor account difference neuromuscular fatigue child adult . Force production capacity musculotendinous stiffness vary function muscle length . Naturally , could differ depend muscle group study . The main aim present protocol compare effect knee extensor ankle plantarflexors length development aetiology neuromuscular fatigue , child adult . The investigator formulate hypothesis short muscle length force low musculotendinous stiffness , difference force child adult would reduce . Thus neuromuscular fatigue development aetiology would similar group . The result present protocol allow well understand aetiology neuromuscular fatigue child help improve training rehabilitation program .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Neuromuscular Fatigue Aetiology Comparison Between Prepubertal Boys Adults</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The study neuromuscular fatigue child recently topic field sport science . Such knowledge could improve efficiency security training rehabilitation healthy child child disease like obesity . The LENGTH-FATIG study provide knowledge peripheral central mechanism neuromuscular fatigue child adult . Fatigue test different muscle group ( knee extensor ankle plantar flexor ) different muscle length ( short , optimal long ) . During high-intensity exercise , prepubertal child resistant fatigue adult . Contributions central peripheral component development neuromuscular fatigue also different population . The reduced child 's fatigue coud particularly relate low peripheral ( i.e . muscular ) fatigue . This might attribute fact prepubertal child rely oxidative anaerobic metabolism adult fatigue exercise . On hand , nervous factor could also explain difference fatigue child adult . However , topic scarcely document still controversial . To knowledge , study still compare aetiology central fatigue ( supra-spinal vs. spinal ) child adult . Only voluntary activation level study child , conventionally use assess central fatigue . But factor n't differentiate spinal supra-spinal contribution neuromuscular fatigue development . The LENGTH-FATIG research project physiological observational study compare two age group ( adult child ) . Subjects perform three randomize fatigue protocol three muscle length ( short , optimal long ) knee extensor ankle plantar flexor . Data analyze use LabChart 7.3 Pro software ( ADInstrument , New South Wales , Australia ) Statistica 8.0 software ( StatSoft , Inc. ) significance accept two-sided alpha level p &lt; .05 . The normality homogeneity variable check respectively Shapiro-Wilk test Barlett test . If normality homogeneity variable verify , absolute value variable ( Force , EMG , NIRS , etc . ) compare use three factor ( age x muscle length x muscle group ) analyse variance ( ANOVA ) repeat measure . If analysis reveal significant effect factor interaction factor , post-hoc Newman-Keuls test perform determine difference different condition . If , contrary , normality homogeneity variable verify , effect muscle length , muscle group age evaluate use Friedman test . If test show significant effect , comparison different condition perform use Mann-Whitney Wilcoxon test .</detailed_description>
