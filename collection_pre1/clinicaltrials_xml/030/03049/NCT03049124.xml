	<brief_summary>Currently , clear indication exercise safe confers health benefit adult undergo preoperative neoadjuvant chemoradiation rectal cancer - population may limit exercise tolerance may increase risk adverse event associate exercise . In prospective single-arm feasibility trial , aim examine safety feasibility 12-week exercise intervention adult undergo preoperative neoadjuvant chemoradiation rectal cancer inform development large-scale randomized control trial ass efficacy exercise administer preoperative neoadjuvant chemoradiation rectal cancer . Adults diagnose rectal cancer schedule preoperative neoadjuvant chemoradiation recruit 12-month period supervise exercise intervention consist aerobic strength train do 3 time per week . Feasibility , safety , patient-reported outcome , physical test perform pre-intervention , post-intervention , follow-up ( i.e. , 6 week post-intervention ) . This study provide data feasibility exercise intervention help determine safe progress large-scale randomized control trial test benefit exercise adult undergo preoperative neoadjuvant chemoradiation rectal cancer . It also provide initial estimate parameter patient-reported outcome , require calculate sample size large-scale randomize control trial ensure sufficiently power .</brief_summary>
