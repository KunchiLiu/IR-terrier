	<brief_summary>This phase IIa trial study well recombinant EphB4-HSA fusion protein pembrolizumab work treat patient non-small cell lung cancer spread place body head neck squamous cell cancer come back spread place body . Recombinant EphB4-HSA fusion protein may stop growth tumor cell block enzymes need cell growth . Monoclonal antibody , pembrolizumab , may interfere ability cancer cell grow spread . Giving recombinant EphB4-HSA fusion protein pembrolizumab may work well treat patient non-small cell lung head neck squamous cell cancer .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Recombinant EphB4-HSA Fusion Protein Pembrolizumab , MK-3475</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . Determine response rate combination pembrolizumab recombinant EphB4-HSA fusion protein ( sEphB4-HSA ) combination therapy . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . Determine biomarkers response . II . Determine unique toxicity combination pembrolizumab sEphB4-HSA . OUTLINE : Patients receive pembrolizumab intravenously ( IV ) 30 minute day 1 recombinant EphB4-HSA fusion protein IV 30 minute day 1 , 8 , 15 . Courses repeat every 3 week 24 month absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . After completion study treatment , patient follow 30 day every 12 week .</detailed_description>
