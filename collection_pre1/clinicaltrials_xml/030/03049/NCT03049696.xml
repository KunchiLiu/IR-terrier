	<brief_summary>The primary objective study determine whether participation pre-bariatric surgery physical activity behavior modification/education program ( ENCOURAGEING START ) tailor unique need obese bariatric surgery patient , improve physical fitness , surgical outcome , patient health quality life . Short- ( one year ) long- ( five year ) term outcome compare matched historical control ( 1:1 ) base age , gender , body mass index ( BMI ) exist Manitoba Centre Metabolic Bariatric Surgery ( CMBS ) database . Our finding determine whether pre-bariatric surgery physical activity behavior modification/education program result improve surgical patient outcome inform development evidence-based physical activity ( PA ) guideline bariatric surgery patient improved CMBS program delivery .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Does Participation Pre-Operative Physical Activity Program Improve Patient Outcomes Quality Life ?</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The objective study design implement 16-week pre-operative physical activity behaviour modification/education program ( ENCOURAGEING Start ) base collaborative partnership among Centre Metabolic Bariatric Surgery ( CMBS ) , University Manitoba Faculty Kinesiology Recreation Management , Victoria General Hospital ( VGH ) . Twenty-four CMBS patient , approve bariatric surgery , participate 16 week ENCOURAGEING START program . The goal develop evidence-based pre-operative physical activity ( PA ) guideline tool improve bariatric surgery program delivery patient outcome . All patient receive Centre Metabolic Bariatric Surgery ( CMBS ) standard care include two four multidisciplinary visit six month , exercise counseling kinesiologist , completion behavior modification program ( Craving ChangeTM ) , achievement lifestyle dietary modification goal order schedule surgery . An interdisciplinary team nurse , psychologist , dietitian , kinesiologists , anesthetist internal medicine professional participate patient preparation . Intervention group participant also complete 16-week supervised physical activity behaviour modification/education program ( ENCOURAGEING START ) cost . The first eight week ENCOURAGEING START program structure exercise education period patient must attend . During second eight week period , opportunities drop-in physical activity provide patient opt home exercise . Patient participation physical activity monitor follow-up experience complete ( phone/email ) . A successfully develop test evidence-based physical activity promotion model ( design co-applicant Dr. Todd Duhamel ) tailor unique need bariatric surgery patient population . It show successful increase weekly physical activity level patient Body Mass Indexes ( BMIs ) 30 35 target physical psycho-social-cognitive aspect health . The intervention deliver kinesiologist ( Certified Exercise Physiologist ) . Intervention group participant complete two session supervise , structure exercise class per week eight week . Progression moderate/high-intensity interval program base patient 's capability occur . This approach show safe effective bariatric patient population . Participants also attend education session risk factor reduction , healthy eating , physical activity/exercise , stress management promotion self-managed care . Principles share decision-making utilized provider patient involve intervention share control treatment decision . During second eight week interval 16-week intervention , participant provide access facilitate attendance drop-in exercise class Active Living Centre ( University Manitoba ) . Participants opportunity meet kinesiologist least four occasion ( 60 minute per meeting ) throughout 16-week intervention . This provide participant additional physical activity counsel would like support overcome barrier prevent physically active past . This counseling ( referral aspect ) model build upon early experience program recognize importance support colleague , friend family . Participant attendance 16-week intervention monitor . In order ensure adequate participation rate study , participant follow-up complete telephone email ( base participant consent preference ) . All patient complete liquid diet ( 900 calorie per day ) two week prior surgery order reduce intra-abdominal obesity facilitate procedure . The study follow intension treat ( ITT ) model patient exclusion/withdrawal document report accord CONSORT guideline . A time series quasi-experimental design use document change outcome measure . Short ( one year ) long-term ( five year ) outcomes compare matched historical control 1:1 base age , gender , BMI exist CMBS database goal determine whether participation program improve physical fitness , surgical outcome , patient health quality life obese patient . The primary outcome study change 6-minute walk test ( 6MWT ) measure distance patient walk six minute , unassisted self-selected pace ; validate measure physical fitness well-established measure functional capacity easily test expensive administer . The 6MWT used measure improvement functional capacity pre- post-bariatric surgery study . The secondary outcome include anthropometric measurement ( height weight , BMI ( kg/m2 ) , neck circumference , waist hip circumference , body composition ( Bioelectric Impedance Analysis ; BIA ) , strength measurement ( sit stand half-squat test assess dynamic balance , flexibility muscular endurance , hand grip arm curl test assess upper limb muscle strength dynamic muscular endurance biceps ) , physical activity level ( Actigraph accelerometer ) , cardiovascular disease risk measurement ( blood pressure , total , LDL , HDL cholesterol triacylglyceride measurement , blood glucose , HA1c , small large artery elasticity ) , frailty measurement , patient quality life/satisfaction/mental health depression survey ( Laval Health Related Quality Life Questionnaire , PHQ9 HAM-D ; see included survey ) , CMBS program outcome measure ( surgical complication rate , hospital length stay , comorbidity resolution , continue participation physical activity , weight loss , weight loss maintenance ) . Tests Week 0 ( pre-intervention ) include 6MWT , anthropometric , body composition , strength , physical activity level ( accelerometer ) , quality life/mental health survey , cardiovascular/ diabetes disease risk measurement , frailty measurement , arterial elasticity . Tests week 16 ( post-intervention ) 12 month ( post-operative ) include 6MWT , anthropometric , strength , physical activity level ( accelerometer ) , quality life/mental health patient satisfaction survey , cardiovascular/ diabetes disease risk measurement , frailty measurement , arterial elasticity . The quality life/mental health patient satisfaction survey also complete 5 year post-operative period . Two REDCap database ( Data Survey ) design implemented facilitate data collection surgical patient outcome , longitudinal survey deployment patient response . The surgical outcome metric base American Society Metabolic Bariatric Surgery 's ( ASMBS ) quality indicator bariatric surgery goal inform define standardize outcome measure RYGB surgery Manitoba Canada .</detailed_description>
