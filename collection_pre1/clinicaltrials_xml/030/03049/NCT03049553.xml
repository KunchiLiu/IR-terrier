	<brief_summary>In Denmark , first birth cohort woman offer HPV-vaccination girl enter cervical screen program . These woman expect well protected cervical cancer . It yet decide screen woman . This method study investigate possible screen scheme could provide reduce burden screen HPV-vaccinated birth cohort .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Trial23 - Randomized Method Study Cervical Screening Women Offered HPV-vaccination Girls</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>In Denmark , woman age 23-49 offered cervical screen liquid-based cytology ( LBC ) every 3rd year , woman age 50-59 every 5th year . Women age 60-64 offered exit HPV-DNA test . In 2008 vaccination Human papilloma virus ( HPV ) offer free charge girl age 13-15 . HPV-vaccination part child vaccination program 12-year old girl since 2009 . Women born 1994 offer HPV-vaccination age 14 , approximately 80 % HPV-vaccinated . These woman enter screen program 2017 . HPV-testing show provide good protection cervical cancer cytology test , 6-year protection CIN3+ negative HPV-test observe high 3-year protection negative cytology test ( ref ) . The aim study evaluate primary screen HPV-testing LBC triage every 6 year woman offer HPV-vaccination girl would provide least protection present screening , measure cumulative number cervical intraepithelial neoplasia ( CIN ) . This screening scheme would allow HPV-negative woman benefit prolonged screening interval thereby reduce burden screen HPV-vaccinated birth cohort . The study deem method study ethical committee Capital region inform consent , therefore , require . The study approve Danish data protection agency . The study undertaken randomize , public health trial embed exist screen program study area : Region Zealand , Northern Denmark region , Central Denmark region part region Southern Denmark . The study plan run three screen round . We expect 12000 woman screen baseline screening round . The study include woman born 1994 live study area . These woman randomize 1:1 either control- intervention arm . The difference two arm intervention arm , HPV-test perform addition LBC cervical sample . The result HPV-test affect screen follow-up , perform solely purpose method study . CINtec p16 histology perform cervical biopsy study ensure quality diagnosis . Randomization perform statistician department prior study start . When cervical sample receive pathology lab allocation ( HPV+/- ) appear automatically IT-system . The study conduct non-inferiority study . If non-inferiority declare , analysis superiority conduct . Censoring performed event death , emigration , end study first cervical intraepithelial neoplasia grade 3 ( CIN3+ ) conization . Data primary secondary endpoint collect National Health register . The project support fund 'Det Frie forskningsr√•d ' , 'Helsefonden ' 'Johannes Clemmesens Forskningsfond ' . Cobas HPV-DNA CINtec p16 histology test-kits sponsor Roche . Both test standard use pathology department prior project . Results baseline screen round final result study publish relevant peer-reviewed journal .</detailed_description>
