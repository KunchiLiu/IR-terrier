	<brief_title>Effect Phosphodiesterase-5 Inhibition With Tadalafil SystEmic Right VEntricular Size Function</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Currently , estimate 300-600 adult live Switzerland congenital heart disease ( CHD ) right ventricle ( RV ) subaortic ( systemic ) position . This include adult prior atrial switch operation complete transposition great artery ( D-TGA ) adult congenitally correct transposition great artery ( ccTGA ) . Although midterm survival favourable , late outcome compromise ventricular dysfunction systemic RV , end-stage heart failure , premature death . Medical heart failure therapy ( ACE-inhibitors , beta-blockers , aldosterone antagonist ) show improve ventricular function survival patient leave heart failure acquire heart disease . Unfortunately , case-reports study fail show similar clinical benefit drug adult fail systemic RV . Currently , establish end-stage therapy fail systemic RV heart transplantation . Given ubiquitous shortage donor organs number adult risk , medical option improve fate patient systemic RV urgently need . The RV leave ventricle ( LV ) different embryological origin , myocardial architecture contractile property . In response increase afterload , RV systemic position , RV express fetal gene pattern , increase phosphodiesterase ( PDE ) -5 expression . PDE-5 express normal RV , up-regulated hypertrophy RV . PDE-5 inhibition increase contractility experimental model RV hypertrophy , normal RV . In clinical practice , effect PDE-5 inhibition systemic RV function exercise capacity adult TGA test . This study assess double-blind , randomize , placebo-controlled multi-center pilot trial effect PDE-5 inhibition Tadalafil RV size function , exercise capacity neurohumoral activation adult systemic RV 3-year follow-up period .</detailed_description>
