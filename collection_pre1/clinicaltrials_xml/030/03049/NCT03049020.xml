	<brief_title>The Efficacy Laparoscopic Sacrocolpopexy Treatment Pelvic Organ Prolapse Women With Without Avulsion Levator Ani Muscle</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Introduction Pelvic organ prolapse ( POP ) , common health problem affect 40 % woman . The life time risk undergo least one session pelvic organ prolapse surgery estimate approximately 13 % . The prevalence reoperation primary pelvic reconstructive surgery high , around 30 % , articles report figure 58 % . From begin 1990s view pelvic floor defect urinary incontinence woman start change significantly . The diagnostics management defect become independent uro-gynecological sub-specialization within gynecology obstetrics , include among 4 basic sub-specializations recognize European Board College Obstetrics Gynecology . Surgical treatment indicate woman symptomatic POP conservative management fail decline . There indication repair asymptomatic POP isolated procedure surgical correction uncertain benefit add peri- post-operative risk . The objective treatment always aim restore quality life comfort . Very little known factor associate surgical failure . Studies identify variety risk factor : young age , high body mass index advance preoperative prolapse ( grade III-IV ) associate increase risk reoperation study , study prove hypothesis . One factor significantly influence result pelvic organ surgery presence pelvic floor injury . Injury levator ani muscle mainly affect result traditional vaginal wall repair , 60 % risk recurrence . In last year , attempt reduce recurrence improve outcome reconstructive surgery treatment pelvic organ prolapse , surgeon start use transvaginally introduce prosthetic material ( mesh ) . This type surgery significantly increase efficacy procedure ( anatomic cure rate 90 % ) , use associate risk complication ( vaginal erosion potential consecutive infection , granuloma , dyspareunia , vesico-vaginal fistula , chronic pain ) thereby potentially reduce patient ' quality life lead additional surgery . If mesh introduce sacrocolpopexy vaginal wall open , significant decrease mesh-related complication . Laparoscopic sacrocolpopexy consider gold standard management apical prolapse high long-term efficacy . Based retrospective data available , seem status pelvic floor may also influence result procedure , present investigator data confirm hypothesis . Therefore investigator plan obtain data prospective analysis result laparoscopic sacrocolpopexy . For prospective longitudinal study , investigator plan include patient surgical treatment pelvic organ prolapse laparoscopic sacrocolpopexy indicate . Based pre-study power analysis enrollment 120 patient plan ( preliminary evaluation result could increase 160 patient ) , minimal number prove disprove null hypothesis : The pelvic floor influence result laparoscopic sacrocolpopexy woman symptomatic pelvic organ prolapse stage II high . Based previous study anticipate failure rate patient defect pelvic floor high . To enroll adequate number patient study conduct two university center long experience type surgery ( number enrol patient workplace identical ) . Based pre-study statistical calculation ( power analysis ) indicate required sample size final statistical analysis group 54 patient ( allocation ratio 1:1 ) . Investigators estimate drop-out rate 10 % , therefore plan enroll 60 patient group . Aim study Based prospective study , evaluate pre-operative pelvic floor status - presence injury musculus levator ani - may influence result laparoscopic sacrocolpopexy . The investigator hope confirm disprove hypothesis presence injury increase risk post-operative prolapse recurrence . Inclusion criterion : Age 18 , sign informed consent , symptomatic pelvic organ prolapse stage II high ( accord International Continence Society Pelvic Organ Prolapse quantification system - POPQ ) anterior apical ( central ) compartment , agreement postoperative follow-up . Exclusion criterion : Previous pelvic reconstructive surgery mesh , isolate posterior compartment prolapse , previous radiotherapy lesser pelvis , contraindication laparoscopic sacrocolpopexy . Pre-operative assessment . All patient undergo complete urogynecological investigation procedure : history , clinical examination , assessment pelvic organ prolapse use POPQ system , examination levator rest tone contraction ( Oxford scale ) , appropriate urodynamics accord International Continence Society recommendation ultrasound examination . They also complete standardized international questionnaire ( ICIQ-UI SF , PISQ 12 , POPDI ) . Ultrasound examination perform combined examination use convex probe , abdominal perineal approach , sectoral vaginal probe introital approach . The study record mainly digital form . Acquired data 4D imagery preserve form data set process appropriate proper software . The ultrasound examination include assessment standard parameter describe position urethrovesical junction , bladder descent , uterus descent , posterior vaginal wall descent ( rectocele , enterocele ) . Using 3D/4D ultrasound examination status pelvic floor evaluate ( presence avulsion puborectalis muscle , abnormal genital hiatus distension ) . Based pre-operative ultrasound examination , woman divide two group : 1 . Group - woman without defect pelvic floor urogenital hiatus size 30 cm2 2 . Group - woman pelvic floor trauma urogenital hiatus size 30 cm2 Surgery peri-operative monitoring All surgical procedure provide general anesthesia , antibiotic prophylaxis use . Surgery provide standardized step : identification promontory , dissection peritoneum promontory preparation ligamentum longitudinale anterior , peritoneum dissection , dissection vesicovaginal septum bladder neck , dissection rectovaginal septum towards perineum , application Y mesh , fixation vaginal apex use non-absorbable suture , anterior posterior vaginal wall absorbable suture fixation upper mesh arm ligamentum longitudinale anterior use non-absorbable suture , follow complete peritoneum closure mesh . The procedure could include salpingo-oophorectomy , supracervical hysterectomy total hysterectomy ( concomitant procedure exclusion criterion ) . Any peri-operative complication monitor . Surgical evaluation include operating time ( incision last suture ) , estimate intraoperative blood loss ( vacuum aspiration ) , perioperative complication ( bladder perforation , vagina perforation , bowel injury , ureter injury vascular injury ) . Postoperative data analyze , include early postoperative complication ( hematoma , spontaneous void recovery , urinary tract infection , ileus , constipation ) late postoperative complication ( procedure failure , mesh erosion , de novo void difficulty , de novo stress urinary incontinence , surgical procedure ) . Post-operative follow-up The first post-operative complete examination plan 3 month surgery ( examination procedure ) . The next check-up provide one year two year surgery , procedure 3-month check-up . In addition pre-operative ultrasound examination , position mesh monitor . We plan minimum one year follow-up patient study , also two year possible . Postoperative follow-up terminate result surgery evaluate failure , case reoperation offer . We also plan post-operative follow-up five year . Criteria evaluation cure failure : Primary outcome : objective cure define absence pelvic organ prolapse ( use POPQ system - maximal I. stage prolapse ) . Number failure group : failure define pelvic organ prolapse stage II high use POPQ system clinical examination , descent 1 cm low edge pubic bone base ultrasound examination . Secondary outcome : These include change genital hiatus size , distance mesh bladder neck urethrovesical junction ) , low position mesh , evaluation subjective parameter , quality life base evaluation questionnaires ICIQ-SF , PISQ 12 , POPDI , occurrence de novo stress urinary incontinence , number re-operations pelvic organ prolapse , occurrence de novo symptom overactive bladder , sexually active patient occurrence de novo dyspareunia Our project completely fulfill primary aim conception health research till year 2022 , subfield `` Innovative surgical procedure '' . Basic aim priority project : implementation surgical procedure low invasivity treatment pelvic organ prolapse predict efficacy pre-operative pelvic floor status , minimize unfavorable impact surgical procedure patient . Basis evaluation socio-economic contribution project solution high-quality evaluation modern surgical procedure . Implementation new effective procedure pelvic organ prolapse shall significantly decrease total treatment cost , significantly improve long term quality life patient . Thus necessary conduct type study , order use procedure improve maintain treatment effectiveness , increase complication rate , decrease recovery time - thus fundamental impact amount money invest public budget . ) Methods promotion For comparison two group patient , without pelvic floor injury estimate range selection particular group . If mark p1 percentage success rate procedure patient pelvic floor injury , p2 percentage success rate procedure group without pelvic floor injury , 5 % significance level prove zero hypothesis ( percentage success rate group ) alternative hypothesis ( percentage success rate differ ) . We require ranges selection group , percent value p1=85 % , P2=60 % require power test 80 % . Under condition statistical calculation indicate require sample size group 54 patient , whole analyze data almost 108 patient . We estimate drop-out rate 10 % , plan enrol 60 patient group- total 120 patient . The success rate use calculate size group estimate previous study ; estimate success rate 60 % patient pelvic floor defect , high efficacy patient normal pelvic floor ( 85 % ) . After evaluation one year result 60 woman plan provide interim analysis re-calculated number woman enrol study reach statistical significance , able increase number enrol woman 20 center total number 160 include patient . Based statistical model , special software data input prepare . The value monitor exactly specify model allow subsequent statistical processing . In study use several type statistical evaluation . In table summarize general characteristic , data evaluate mean data average median , significant deviation . Furthermore , establish floor cap 95 % confidence interval arrive average . Zero alternative hypothesis establish validity determine . Where number compare , chi square apply , case number observation small , Fischer exact test use . We use non-parametric Kruskal-Wallis one-way analysis variance quantitative feature Fisher exact test contingency table . We use Bonferroni inequality correct p value case multiple comparison .</detailed_description>
