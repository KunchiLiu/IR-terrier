	<brief_summary>Parkinson 's Disease ( PD ) define characteristic motor symptom include slow movement , small movement , difficulty movement initiation disruption time . Besides gross motor symptom , fine motor impairment PD cause difficulty everyday task write , self-care , fine object manipulation . These activity limitation lead disability , social isolation , reduce quality life . In series breakthrough study Michael Thaut colleague develop Neurologic Music Therapy ( NMT ) find address many gross motor impairment improve gait balance . The underlying idea rhythm essential component relate music specifically motor behavior . The mechanism action call `` rhythmic entrainment '' one system 's motion signal frequency entrain frequency another system . The effect NMT fine motor function investigate yet . Music activity important life many old adult . Notably , use music associate increase well-being older adult , foster social connection mood regulation . Furthermore , many musical activity limit physical demand , make attainable individual live mobility impairment physical restriction . Based literature investigator preliminary study , investigator propose test efficacy Neurologic Music Therapy comparison Occupational Therapy ( OT ) standard care adult Parkinson 's spectrum . The investigator define work plan use different musical instrument grow tempo specifically improve fine motor movement .</brief_summary>
