	<brief_title>Stress Echo 2020 - The International Stress Echo Study</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>In prospective , multicenter , international , observational study design , &gt; 100 SE lab network systematic clinical , laboratory image data collection time SE structure follow-up information least 6 month 1 year , 3 year specific protocol . For group primary aim evaluate feasibility several index SE evaluation patient know suspected specific disease ( 1,2,3 ) . The secondary aim ass value parameter predict functional impairment . The tertiary aim ass prognostic value SE indices prognostic stratification disease medium-long-term . The study theater international network cardiology SE laboratory , study endorse promoted Italian Society Echocardiography . The start point recruitment phase recent electronic survey Italian Society Echocardiography , 2015 censor 134 laboratory moderate- ( &gt; 100/year ) high- ( &gt; 400/year ) volume SE activity , precisely interrogated interest participation SE2020 . The recruitment plan forecast 500 patient end 2016 , double rate enrollment subsequent year , parallel increase number recruit labs fulfilling quality control criterion , reach target number 100 end 5-year schedule ( 4 ) . Data collection Stress protocols harmonize accord recent European North-American scientific society ' guideline , semi-supine exercise recommend pharmacological stress dosages 40 mcg/kg/min dobutamine , 0.84 mg/kg 6 min dipyridamole , 4-min step 200 microg/kg/min adenosine . With dobutamine , atropine ( 1 mg ) administer patient suspect CAD ( protocol 9 ) , associate high rate complication history neuropsychiatric symptom , reduce left ventricular function , small body habitus . The maximal allow dobutamine dose 20 mcg/kg/min patient aortic stenosis , high dos less safe probably unnecessary ( 3 ) . All laboratory share standardized case report form cod database format facilitate retrieval communication . For application outside CAD CAD test vasodilator stress , atropine give top pharmacological stress . Although data collection dedicate project-specific case report form allow , encourage implement dedicate , free ad-hoc system data storage reporting develop National Research Council , Institute Clinical Physiology . The software provide suitable informatics infrastructure SE 2020 Italian multicenter study , intuitive graphic interface , eye-catching graphic format convenient reporting option . It could represent trade-off comprehensive information require scientific standard smooth workflow priority busy , high-volume , clinically-driven activity . The software develop tested Italian translation last release language ( English , Portuguese Serbian ) currently progress . Data analysis Data express mean ± standard deviation ( normally distribute data , wall motion score index ) , median inter-quartile ( 25th , 75th ) range ( non-normally distribute data , B-lines ) per cent frequency ( categorical data , presence absence severe mitral regurgitation ) , absolute number . One-sample comparison perform use Wilcoxon test , chi-squared test without Fisher 's correction categorical data . Event rate estimate Kaplan-Meier curve compare log-rank test . Univariable analysis Cox proportional hazard model perform assess association candidate variable outcome . All variable P &lt; 0.20 univariable analysis consider candidate variable multivariable analysis . Goodness fit model base C-statistics variant , adjust optimism use bootstrap replication ( least 1000 ) . A receiver operate characteristic analysis use obtain best prognostic predictor individual SE variable . We also analyze data accord clinically guide stepwise procedure , variable include model order actually consider cardiologist . Statistical significance set p &lt; 0.05 . Quality control It well-known diagnostic performance SE closely related level expertise cardiologist-echocardiographer perform test , since evaluation regional wall motion subjective qualitative , considerable variability even among experienced center undisputed reputation ( 1 ) . The reproducibility accuracy wall motion read substantially increase limited training ( 2 ) development conservative , pre-specified reading criterion ( 4 ) . Therefore , quality control diagnostic performance various laboratory must order enter meaningful information data bank . The burden quality control hub center principal investigator subproject , various speak center may converge . For general project , hub center regional wall motion analysis Pisa-CNR , coordination principal investigator . There five different level quality control , increase level complexity : 1 . Level 1 , pre-requisite : volume activity lab least 100 SE test per year , requirement credentialing SE activity scientific societies 2 . Level 2 , speak center read hub SE image , consist 20 select study regional wall motion analysis . The concordance require identification test negativity/positivity , positive test , correct localization ischemic zone . For test , multiple choice 6-answer test give . The criterion ≥ 90 % concordance ( least 18 20 study ) require , previously describe first-generation SE multicenter study ( 4 ) . 3 . Level 3 , hub center read speak center study , consist 20 any-quality consecutive study record speak center . The criterion ≥ 80 % concordance ( least 16 20 study ) require , previously describe first-generation SE multicenter study ( 4 ) . 4 . Level 4 , core lab reading . All center grant full access image SE study enter data bank audit read core lab laboratory , standard specific subprojects number 10 genetic SE , every effort need make minimize variability single reader analyze study acquire different center , require recommendation small-to-medium sample study , resource allow ( 4 ) . 5 . Level 5 , specific protocol quality control . Although SE quality control prove work well regional wall motion analysis , novel SE application involve different parameter , methodology acquisition read criterion . Therefore , subproject , web-based training session quality control organize specific hub center principal investigator assure consistency data ( 4 ) . The principal investigator subproject prepare set 20 study rest-stress image . For test , multiple choice 6-answers test give ( 1 correct ) . The criterion ≥90 % concordance ( least 18 20 study ) require . The specific sign test certification : end-diastolic end-systolic volume change ( protocol 1 ) ; B-lines ( protocol 2 , 4 , 6 9 ) ; leave ventricular outflow tract gradient ( protocol 3 10 ) ; E/e ' ( protocol 4 ) ; mitral regurgitation quantitative assessment ( protocol 5 ) ; aortic stenosis quantitative assessment ( protocol 5 ) ; right ventricular function ( protocol 7 ) ; systolic pulmonary artery pressure measurement stress ( protocol 8 ) ; coronary flow velocity reserve ( protocol 9 ) ; leave ventricular elastance ( protocol 9 ) ; global longitudinal strain ( protocol 4 10 ) . This study also intend special level voluntary accreditation expertise specific field interest , well volume activity criterion request guideline . The accreditation process run certify Italian scientific society echocardiography strictly follow criterion procedure European association cardiovascular image ensure standardization independence process . When otherwise specify , rest SE measurement perform accord late joint recommendation European North-American society ( 4 ) . Overall study design We collect experience Italian , Brazilian , Hungarian Serbian SE labs 5-year period 2016 2020 . In broad framework , 10 sub-projects address specific patient ' subset . The target population range 250-patient sample protocol focus specific disease ( protocol 7 repair tetralogy Fallot ) 2,500 protocol heart failure ( number 2 ) 5,000 all-comers know suspected CAD test novel index ( number 9 ) . Different study project cover entire spectrum disease , age clinical status current patient . The recruited participant `` well well '' ( super-fit athlete enter project 6 ) , `` worry well '' ( young first-degree relative patient hypertrophic cardiomyopathy familiar form dilate cardiomyopathy pulmonary arterial hypertension , project 10 ) , `` suspect sick '' ( instance patient suspect diastolic heart failure CAD project 4 9 ) , sick sick ( instance , patient advance heart failure valvular heart disease enter project 1 , 2 5 ) . Some degree overlap unavoidably present project , instance subject eligible project 2 also recruitable project 1 ( undergo cardiac resynchronization therapy ) project 5 ( heart failure preserve ejection fraction ) . Over time , patient may move one project another : instance , first-degree relative hypertrophic cardiomyopathy patient negative phenotype enrol project 10 may subsequently develop overt form disease enrol project 3 . All potential gray-zone situation readily identify individual SE report . Although set mainly Italian cardiological community , essential document write English plan extend project community long-standing history cooperation experience multicenter trial . Brazilian , Hungarian Serbian center already recruit additional laboratory country enter process accreditation . The project curiosity-driven , independent sponsor , clinically orient . However , plan start-up phase , support public private funding agency industry possible - provide unrestricted interfere way data collection analysis . There bonus payment subject recruitment subject referral . Enrolled patient refer SE lab clinically-driven indication . Each patient sign inform consent form allow scientific utilization data , respectful privacy right , time test . The study project submit coordinate center principal investigator January 31 , 2016 approve revise form Rome-1 ethical committee July 20 , 2016 ( protocol number 1487/Lazio1 ) .
