However , many patient undergo non-cardiac surgery within first two year PCI . Perioperatively , two counteracting risk take account , first , risk thromboembolic complication , ASA medication discontinue second , risk surgical bleeding , ASA therapy continue . However , factor contribute preoperative decision-making ASA-withdrawal still unclear . This study aim assess independent factor associate clinical decision discontinue ASA preoperatively patient undergo elective non-cardiac surgery . In particular study aim determine presence coronary stent independently associate ASA discontinuation . Furthermore study ass , benefit-risk-estimates ( numerical rating scale ) patient supervise physician associate decision withdraw ASA . Study design Patients long-term ASA undergo non-cardiac surgery well supervise anesthesiologist participate preoperative survey . Detailed information ASA medication , perioperative ASA use , comorbidities , factor might associate decision discontinue ASA preoperatively benefit-risk-estimates ( numerical rating scale ) sample questionnaire .</detailed_description>
