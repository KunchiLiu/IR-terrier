	<brief_summary>Gastric cancer incidence North America 24,000 new case annually , approximately 15 % diagnose early stage . Standard care early gastric cancer ( EGC ) treatment historically include anatomical resection regional lymphadenectomy . However , recent emergence organ-sparing technique , select patient low risk lymph node metastases able avoid anatomical resection inherent short long term consequence . Despite advance , EGC patient high risk feature continue require anatomical resection achieve adequate lymph node staging , despite fact 75-95 % patient ultimately find node negative disease . Due inadequacy standard image modality reliably detect nodal metastasis EGC patient , sentinel lymph node sample gastric cancer develop use principal similar use broadly breast melanoma patient . Early report Asia suggest technique high success rate , accuracy sensitivity , however never verify North American context . This study aim test SLN sample North American gastric cancer patient high volume regional treatment centre , aim expand application organ spar resection EGC patient .

	<detailed_description>Gastric cancer incidence North America 7.4/100,000 population , 24,590 new case diagnose annually United States1 . Of , approximately 15 % detect early gastric cancer stage spread regional lymph nodes2 . Recent advance gastric cancer detection , endoscopic use narrow band image magnification endoscopy , help improve detection rate early lesions3-5 . Gastric cancer detect early stage excellent prognosis , report long term overall survival rate 71-92 % 6-9 due low rate peritoneal distant metastatic spread frequently occur patient advanced lesion . However , mainstay treatment even early gastric cancer ( EGC ) remain anatomical resection regional lymphadenectomy . While oncologically sound , anatomical resection often associate complication unpleasant short long-term side effect , include post-operative weight loss , dump syndrome , vitamin deficiency , anastomotic complication , delay gastric empty , bile reflux , among others . Given long life expectancy patient resection EGC , curative resection organ preservation improve post-operative quality life treatment goal . Recently , organ-sparing technique emerge allow select early gastric cancer treat without anatomical resection . These technique , include endoscopic mucosal resection ( EMR ) endoscopic submucosal dissection ( ESD ) , allow curative resection highly-selected lesion complete organ preservation . The shortcoming organ spar resection technique presently lymphadenectomy perform , lead patient perhaps under-staged therefore under-treated . According Japanese Gastric Cancer Treatment Guidelines10 , early lesion deem appropriate organ-sparing endoscopic resection meet follow criterion : confine mucosa ( T1a ) , tumour size &lt; 2cm , ulceration , well-differentiated tumour grade . Together , tumour feature low risk lymph node metastasis ( &lt; 1 % ) . Long-term outcome ESD highly favorable , local recurrence overall survival rate comparable anatomical resection7,8 . For tumours meet criterion however , risk lymph node involvement drastically increase , submucosal invasion , ulceration , tumour size &gt; 3cm , poorly differentiate tumour type , lymphovascular invasion confer risk lymphatic metastasis 4-26 % 11 . For reason , current best practice recommend EGCs high risk feature continue undergo anatomical resection regional lymphadenectomy . However 75-95 % patient ultimately regional metastasis final pathological analysis , suggest could spar anatomical resection lymph node basins definitively stag prior surgery . Presently , several image modality available characterize lymph node stage gastric cancer , include endoscopic ultrasound ( EUS ) , compute tomography ( CT ) positron emission tomography ( PET ) . Unfortunately , sensitivity modality woefully inadequate accurately predict microscopic lymph node metastasis , therefore reliably use differentiate high risk EGCs require anatomical resection lymphadenectomy amenable organ-sparing resection12-15 . To address gap ability accurately detect nodal metastasis early gastric cancer , sentinel lymph node ( SNL ) sampling pioneered Asia undergone refinement study since early 2000s . A recent multi-institutional study 397 patient conduct across 12 centre Japan report rate SLN detection 97.5 % accuracy SLN stage compare post-resection stage 99 % 16 . These number rival report SLN biopsy breast melanoma cancer large randomize controlled trials17,18 . Indeed , tumour type , SLN biopsy standard care globally stag clinically node-negative patient due diagnostic superiority stag modality . Following success SLN sample gastric cancer , select Asian institution apply technique divert sentinel node-negative ( SLN -ve ) T1 T2 gastric cancer patient away anatomical resection extensive lymphadenectomy towards organ-sparing endoscopic wedge resection . The Upper GI Oncology Program McGill University Health Centre see approximately 80 gastric cancer patient per year , SLN sample potential inform resection decision ~25-30 % . Currently , program performs 15-20 ESDs annually early esophageal gastric lesion , approximately 30-40 anatomical resection perform node-negative gastric esophageal cancer patient per year . Implementation gastric SNL sampling technique would enable expansion ESD program offer organ-sparing curative resection EGC patient presently offer anatomical resection . The purpose study determine utility feasibility SLN sample gastric cancer North American context .</detailed_description>
