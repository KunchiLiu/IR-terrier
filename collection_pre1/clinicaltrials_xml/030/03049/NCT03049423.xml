	<brief_title>MRI Appearance Injured Ligament Tendon Ankle Different Postures</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The ankle joint important part human low limb . It function maintain normal stand human body , support bear body weight conduct movement . As one complex joint human body , surround ligament tendon play important protective effect , also play fix role movement ankle effectively prevent excessive ankle varus/valgus . Ankle fracture account approximately 3.9 % total body fracture , rank first intra-articular fracture . An ankle injury often accompany intra-articular fracture surround ligament rupture . With increase requirement joint function clinical surgery , inappropriate treatment ankle ligament injury result limit movement function ankle , even lead traumatic arthritis chronic ankle instability . X-ray examination routinely preferred diagnosis ankle injury , make accurate diagnosis ankle dislocation fracture . However , X-ray plain film low resolution tendon ligament lesion , easy result miss diagnosis mild fracture , bone contusion occult fracture , moreover , difficult fully clear location , type degree ankle injury . MRI high definition resolution implement multi-parameter multi-directional scanning . Its histopathological finding accurately objectively display ankle surround ligament injury severity . MRI able display anatomic structure severity ligament injury ankle three anatomic plane : transverse , sagittal coronal . Sagittal MRI good helper diagnosis Achilles tendon lesion , clearly show talus , posterior tibial tendon , talocalcaneal joint , Achilles tendon , subtalar joint , articulatio talonavicularis , tibiotalar joint , cartilage joint cavity . Coronal MRI clearly show structure peroneal joint , tibiotalar joint , lateral malleolus , especially articular surface tibia , fibula ankle bone well ligament fibula ankle bone ; meanwhile , display posterior tibial ligament , posterior talofibular ligament posterior tibial tendon . Transverse MRI well show tibiofibular ligament , anterior talofibular ligament . The ankle ligament mainly consist three part : lateral collateral ligament , medial collateral ligament tibiofibular ligament . Activities ankle refer flexion extension along sagittal plane , include plantar flexion dorsiflexion , play role support bearing , movement conduction function lever . Adverse event If expect unexpected adverse event ( headache nausea ) MRI detection , date occurrence , type injury therapeutic management record . Severe adverse event , include requirement immediate surgery , damage patient 's work ability , life-threatening event death report project manager institution review board within 24 hour . Data collection , management , analysis open access All data collect case report form , record electronically save dedicate computer . Continuous variable record collect descriptive statistical analysis , allow real-time review identify potential deviation . The validity data assess censor every 6 month random sample 10 % database . Only researcher participate study right query database modify . Statistical analysis complete professional statistician responsible statistical report . The statistical result give project manager , responsible write research report . Anonymized trial data release www.figshare.com .</detailed_description>
