	<brief_title>Tailored Exercise Interventions Reduce Fatigue Cancer Survivors</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Background Rationale Approximately one-third cancer survivor experience severe persistent fatigue number year post-treatment , distress symptom often under-treated healthcare professional due lack mechanism-targeted intervention . The assessment cancer-related fatigue ( CRF ) reliant subjective fatigue measurement self-report questionnaire . Less attention give objective physiological measurement . However , well-established technique allow assessment neuromuscular fatigue peripheral central origin could utilize study CRF . Very study consider objective measure alongside self-report scale study CRF two use technique cancer survivor . To date , study investigate neuromuscular fatigue whole body , dynamic activity relevant daily task ( involve low limb due functional relevance locomotion ) . Novel test develop laboratory could use part wider screen develop individualized intervention alleviate CRF . It well accept field CRF multidimensional addition potential neuromuscular component , role sleep disturbance may also implicate . Interventions target improve sleep quality therefore warrant , sound evidence efficacy exercise intervention particular improve CRF cancer survivor . As non-pharmacological intervention , physical activity strong evidence base treat CRF . However , mechanism explain reduction CRF exercise understood . Due complex multi-factorial nature CRF , would benefit tailor exercise intervention specific deficit ( regard neuromuscular mechanism ) difficulty ( example sleep disturbance ) experience individual . Ultimately , mechanism-targeted exercise intervention could translate clinical rehabilitation program lead improve quality cancer survivor . Research Question &amp; Objectives The primary aim research investigate effect traditional vs. tailor 12-week exercise intervention objective measure neuromuscular fatigue sleep disturbance , subjective measure CRF cancer survivor . Secondary objective include : - To determine central peripheral contribution neuromuscular fatigue whole-body exercise cancer survivor experience persistent CRF ; - To evaluate relationship objective measure neuromuscular function subjective self-report measure CRF cancer survivor . - To evaluate relationship objective measure sleep disturbance subjective self-report measure CRF cancer survivor . Methods Fatigued cancer survivor complete treatment ≥ three month ≤ five year prior enrollment recruit study . The study design involve pre-testing , 12-week intervention post-testing . Participants require visit laboratory two experimental visit 12-week intervention . Lab visit involve measurement subjective ( questionnaire ) objective ( e.g . neuromuscular sleep ) measure fatigue . Participants match ( ) type cancer ; ( b ) level fatigue ( c ) age . Participants randomly assign one three treatment group : classical training ( CT ) , tailor training ( TT ) control group . The CT group undertake supervise exercise intervention involve aerobic exercise light resistance training . The experimental TT group prescribe individualized exercise intervention design specifically counteract deficit difficulty identify pre-testing . The program establish base result initial test . Both group train 3 - 5 time per week .</detailed_description>
