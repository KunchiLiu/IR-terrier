	<brief_summary>The purpose study determine whether low-dose ketamine infusion use main intra-operative analgesic different burn patient , thereby reduce total intra-operative opioid requirement . Secondary objective determine whether low-dose ketamine infusion lengthen amount time first narcotic give recovery room ICU , whether pain score awake patient low post-operatively .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Intraoperative Low-dose Ketamine Infusion Main Analgesic Burn Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Burn patient suffer several type pain ( due stimulation mechanoreceptors , nociceptors , chemical stimulation ) well injury . Multiple agent use control pain special group . Due different pain mechanism up-regulation mu receptor , numerous pain control modality seek . Opioids mainstay treat pain patient . Adjuvant non-opioid agent less effective used alone . These agent include non-steroidal , anti-inflammatory drug ( NSAIDs ) , Î±-2 antagonist , local anesthetic ketamine . Regional block use perioperative period contraindication , catheter leave place extended period time . Opioids many side effect respiratory depression , nausea , vomit , itch , urinary retention , hyperalgesia . The latter concern patient chronic opioids , include burn patient . Ketamine non-competitive N-methyl-D-aspartate ( NMDA ) antagonist successfully use burn intensive care unit ( BICUs ) provide pain dressing change . It also use BICUs supplement analgesic effect opioids . Ketamine exert clinical analgesic effect mainly NMDA antagonism , also interact receptor AMPA monoaminergic , nicotinic , muscarinic , mu , delta , kappa opioid receptor . It resemble local anesthetic interaction sodium channel . Low dose ketamine infusion ( LDKI ) use postoperative analgesic different patient group various duration time . Some study show benefit use intraoperative low-dose ketamine non-burn surgery order reduce post-operative opiate requirement . Little known , literature , intraoperative low-dose ketamine infusion use main analgesic burn patient general , severely burn patient specific . Previous study show ketamine potentiates analgesic effect low-dose fentanyl , less degree , low-dose morphine stimulation phosphorylated extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1/2 ( ERK1/2 ) . It also increase duration opioid-induced analgesia , delay opioid induce tolerance , play role prevent opioid-induced hyperalgesia delay desensitization improve resensitization ERK 1/2 signal . From pharmacologic standpoint , advantageous pain modality hemodynamically-compromised burn patient . Ketamine use extensively burn ICUs low-dose infusion ketamine capture much attention treat burn patient operate room ( OR ) . Burn patient come OR numerous time wound debridement , skin graft unrelated surgery . The use inhalation anesthetic pose risk hypotension hemodynamically fragile patient . Opioids still main agent treat patient OR sometimes give high dos , due resistance up-regulation mu opioid receptor mention . These dos often effective control pain lead hypotension combine potent inhalation agent .</detailed_description>
