	<detailed_description>The study perform single-blinded , randomize , crossover manner . Thirty subject ( 20 insulin resistant subject 10 healthy subject ) randomly assign one two sequence : sequence A ( n=15 ) RRB RRB+FOS ( mean subject consume RRB ( 125 g/day ( ) ( equivalent 1 cup fresh RRB ) ) breakfast 4 week , 4-week washout period , subject consume RRB FOS ( 125 g/d RRB 8 g/d FOS ) 4 week ) ; sequence B ( n=15 ) RRB+FOS RRB ( mean subject receive RRB FOS 4 week , 4-week washout , RRB another 4-week ) . At begin end 4-week treatment , subject undergo 6-h Study Day ( 4 study day 12-week study duration ) follow 1-h next morning follow-up visit . Subjects require meet several inclusion exclusion criterion , assess online survey on-site clinic assessment , include questionnaire , blood analysis anthropometric measure . Eligible subject invite participate study . Each subject ask come 1 Screening Visit , 4 dinner pick-ups ( day Study Day ) , 4 Study Days 6 Weekly Meetings . During Screening Visit , subject read , sign date write Institutional Review Board approve Informed Consent Form prior perform study procedure . And assessed qualification , instructed process complete study questionnaire counsel restrict intake color plant food rich phytonutrients 3 day prior Study Day . They ask restrict alcohol intake , coffee/tea/ caffeinated beverage intake moderate / vigorous physical activity drink plenty water maintain hydration 24 h prior Study Day . They instruct come Clinical Nutrition Research Center ( CNRC ) day Study Day pick dinner meal even snack . Subjects ask get least 7 hour sleep come CNRC 10-h overnight fast Study Day . Each Study Day require subject clinic ~7 h complete baseline post challenge beverage testing procedure , include 6 h study day 1 h next morning follow-up visit . Subjects evaluate compliance protocol ( diet , exercise , sleep , fast ) , body weight blood pressure measure , ingest cup red raspberry drink ( 250 g RRB ( equivalent 2 cup fresh RRB ) 64 g glucose ) blood , urine feces sample collect .</detailed_description>
