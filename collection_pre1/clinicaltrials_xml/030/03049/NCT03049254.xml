	<detailed_description>Sudden cardiac arrest ( SCA ) account 360,000 death US 400,000 Europe per annum , include thousand age 40 die unexpectedly without warn . Whilst majority SCAs trigger heart attack , age 40 year tend due genetic heart disease , identify early may save life family member . Epidemiological post-mortem study show arrhythmogenic ventricular cardiomyopathy ( AVC ) lead cause SCA , responsible 25 % deaths age group . AVC highly clinically genetically heterogeneous condition , result fibro-fatty replacement myocardium may lead ventricular dysfunction , heart failure , electrical rhythm disturbance SCD . Although AVC predominantly affect right ventricle ( ARVC ) , affect right leave ventricle , LV isolation ( ALVC ) result type dilate cardiomyopathy ( DCM ) propensity arrhythmia ( aDCM ) . Recent report aDCM familial distribution suggest undiagnosed AVC , reflect heterogeneity limit understanding . AVC consider disease desmosome ( cell-adhesion protein ) lead identification desmosomal mutation ( plakoglobin , plakophilin-2 , desmoplakin , desmoglein-2 desmocollin ) , mostly inherit autosomal dominant manner incomplete penetrance variable expressivity . Non-desmosomal gene also discover ( desmin , titin , RYR2 , transform growth factor -3 , transmembrane protein 43 phospholamban ) . Together , account 50-60 % know AVc-related mutation , remainder genetically undetermined . Additionally , multiple mutation also exist within family within individual compound complexity AVC . Inter intra-familial variability inexplicable current knowledge , suggest epigenetic environmental factor contribute phenotype . Disease expression highly variable even amongst member family mutation make clinical detection cascade screen challenge . Finally , predict patient risk SCD AVC may AVC difficult potentially lethal . Since SCD first lethal tragic manifestation disease , optimize screen strategy paramount importance . The long-term goal program leverage well-phenotyped cohort patient AVC Mayo Clinic Papworth Hospital , University Cambridge , , enroll others discover novel pathogenic variant , correlate genotype phenotype , develop robust screening tool diagnosis AVC prevent SCD . Overall hypothesis : onset AVC reliably accurately predict first-degree relative index case use genetic , electrocardiographic ( ECG ) image data . Aim # 1 : Identify novel candidate gene variant associate AVC ( include case involve right , leave dilate cardiomyopathy type ) . This aim accomplish use next generation sequence probands-family member trio `` genomic familial triangulation '' approach innovative bioinformatics , statistical , system base biology approach . Aim # 2 : Correlate genotype phenotype confirm case AVC follow longitudinally use clinical , ECG image data 2a . predict disease onset ; 2b . predict disease progression ; 2c . predict likelihood arrhythmia ( ventricular , supra-ventricular atrial fibrillation ) . Aim # 3 : Combine registry Mayo Clinic , Rochester , USA Papworth Hospital , University Cambridge , UK , study longitudinal data correlate genotype phenotype . Aim # 4 : Characterize desmosomal change buccal mucosal cell genotype validate gold-standard endomyocardial biopsy . Project approval : This study approve Mayo Clinic IRB Papworth Hospital NHS Foundation Trust collation exist data develop registry . New direction project seek appropriate approval IRB site due course . Recruitment strategy : Patients already see Mayo Clinic Rochester Papworth Hospital site enrol , provide research authorization active . A HIPPA waiver approve registry collates exist data . Standard Mayo Clinic policy inform patient clinical data utilized research purpose , patient ask specifically decline research authorization wish opt . A similar system place Papworth Hospital . For specific aim require blood bio-specimens biobank , separate IRB utilized require sign consent form . Baseline data include limited following , index presentation screen visit first-degree relative : - Baseline demographic - Clinical history - Examination finding include feature suggestive cardio-cutaneous syndrome etc . - Family history least 3 generation . An online tool utilized generate pedigree ( http : //www.progenygenetics.com/online-pedigree ) - Serial ECG data ( 12-lead , signal-averaged Brugada protocol ) - Continuous ECG monitoring data ( Holter , extended-Holter , event recorder , implantable loop recorder etc . ) - Imaging data ( echocardiography , cardiac MRI , cardiac CT ) - Cardiopulmonary exercise test exercise stress test - Questionnaires exercise capacity , activity daily live ( approved IRB self-completed patient ) - Cardiac catheterization data - Existing genotyping data ( include method use ) - Where available , endomyocardial biopsy data For clinical follow-up visit screen follow-up first-degree relative , addition test , follow collect : - Cardiac implantable electronic device data - Cardiac electrophysiology study , catheter ablation deliver , record Biobank genotyping novel variant discovery : Current guideline recommend genetic test index case blood-relatives . Where perform available , collect . Probands blood-relatives invited participate optional component study . Blood , saliva buccal scraping collect probands blood relative , identify current pathogenic variant associate AVC , discover novel variant . Biobank novel biomarker discovery : Blood store baseline subsequent visit test know blood-biomarkers disease progression ( high-sensitivity cardiac troponins , natriuretic peptide , high-sensitivity CRP cytokine ) . Blood also store high throughput 'omics ( transcriptomics , metabolomics proteomics ) identify novel biomarkers reflect disease progression , prognostication crucially help illuminate new biological pathway . Annual Clinical Assessment : Most patient AVC followed-up annually frequently dependent upon symptom . At follow-up ECG and/or Holter usually perform . The investigator ensure site performs consistently . Data generate used registry . In addition , investigator may contact patient telephone ass symptom ( follow IRB approval ) . Follow-up every 3-year interval : Clinical guideline screen first-degree relative recommend follow-up approximately every 3 year , phenotype expression delay ( exception familial case pathogenic variant identify , blood-relative negative ) . Thus , time period choose subsequent follow-up visit , patient re-assessed 2010 Task Force Criteria evidence AVC . This follow-up visit include : - Clinical history - Examination - ECG ( 12-lead signal-averaged ) - Holter monitor - Repeat cardiac MRI - Exercise testing ( CPET treadmill ) It objective continue registry indefinitely , order capture adequate event rate valid accurate modelling predict disease progression . Data Collation Management : The investigator use REDCap ( Research Electronic Data Capture ) tool completion case report form enrollment follow-up visit ( link demonstration website http : //projectredcap.org ) . The server base in-house Mayo Clinic , access provide approve study personnel . No personal identifiable information collate online . All case unique study ID , key link subject ID patient identifiable data locate site , available PIs senior research personnel . The data store consider confidential disclose 3rd party , exception participant clinical health-care provider responsible patient 's welfare .</detailed_description>
