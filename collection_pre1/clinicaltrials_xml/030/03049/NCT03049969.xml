	<brief_summary>The propose study test feasibility tolerability transcranial direct current stimulation ( tDCS ) add cognitive remediation program n=100 adult . For 20 cognitive remediation session , participant receive 20 minute active tDCS stimulation ( 2.0 mA , dorsolateral prefrontal cortex DLPFC montage ) complete cognitive training task .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Cognitive Remediation Augmented With Transcranial Direct Current Stimulation ( tDCS )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Transcranial Direct Current Stimulation ( tDCS ) novel , safe , well-tolerated , low-cost treatment approach may enhance benefit cognitive remediation . The application tDCS relatively recent therapeutic development utilizes low amplitude direct current induce change cortical excitability . To meet study 's objective , investigator focus specifically work memory ( WM ) training outcome . Limiting train WM exercise provide opportunity test proof concept combine therapy within short two-week time frame , maximize synergistic effect engage region target tDCS .</detailed_description>
