	<brief_summary>The objective research project investigate specific behavior exposure related sugarcane work association non-communicable disease , specifically Chronic Kidney Disease Unknown Origin ( CKDu ) among sugarcane worker Guatemala . Over course 6-month sugarcane harvest investigator assess risk factor decline kidney function , also change biomarkers kidney function pre post work shift field factory worker possible relationship dehydration heat stress . The investigator also evaluate effectiveness intervention aim increase hydration reduce heat stress . Finally investigator measure biomarkers exposure environmental sample heavy metal , agrochemicals , infectious disease ( Leptospira ) .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>This protocol describe two prospective cohort study one intervention study conduct throughout sugarcane harvest , October May , Pantaleon 's sugarcane plantation Guatemala . Overview Studies The investigator propose conduct three study make use exist pre-employment data prior year collect new data 6-month sugarcane harvest . Pre-employment data collect worker ( N=5000 ) Pantaleon screening occur throughout harvest . Pre-employment screen data include information demographic , behavior , work practice , non-communicable disease , include kidney disease . The purpose three new study collect detail data risk factor biomarkers CKDu . Risk factor assess collect information survey medical exam , collect biological sample ( blood urine ) subsample worker . Study 1 ) Natural History CKDu Study Study Rationale : This study prospectively follow cohort sugarcane worker ( N=407 ) multiple year understand natural history CKDu . By follow cohort worker , able describe prevalence incidence abnormal eGFR identify risk factor CKDu . Study Design Populations : Pantaleon conduct post-harvest evaluation 407 worker follow 2015-2016 harvest . The investigator conduct prospective longitudinal study establish cohort worker ( recruited end 2015-16 harvest ) work Pantaleon replicate post-harvest evaluation end 2016-2017 harvest . Study 2 ) Industrial Mill Worker Observational Study Study Rationale : This study prospectively follow stratify random selection 100 mill worker throughout harvest understand prevalence incidence kidney damage . The investigator able describe prevalence incidence abnormal eGFR identify risk factor CKDu . Although mill worker indoors , informally observed work condition high heat , place risk heat stress , dehydration possibly CKDu . Study Design Population : Occupational Health Safety staff Pantaleon identify job description associate heat exposure mill . Pantaleon conduct pre-employment evaluation among 100 mill worker , specifically select random sample worker job title associate high heat . At end harvest , investigator collect occupational non-occupational risk factor survey medical exam measure creatinine level blood finger prick among 100 mill worker . Study 3 ) Hydration Study Study Rationale : This study prospectively assess acute chronic kidney damage among sugarcane worker evaluate kidney function ) start harvest end harvest , b ) work shifts harvest . An intervention implement aim increase hydration reduce heat stress among sugarcane worker throughout day . The investigator assess effectiveness intervention increase hydration work productivity , final goal intervention aim decrease acute chronic kidney damage . Study Design Population : This study comprise follow : 1 ) implementation intervention include wellness incentive enhance education heat stress hydration , 2 ) investigation biological marker dehydration acute kidney injury among approximately 500 sugarcane worker . Workers recruit 10 work group randomly select Pantaleon work site . Each group data collect 3 time 6-month harvest . Sub-Study 3.1 ) Heat Sub-study Study Rational : This sub-study increase understand physiological response worker heat exposure determine worker ' metabolic workload . The investigator able examine across shift change physiological response effect acute chronic kidney function . It help determine worker receive sufficient duration number rest period . Study Design Population : Among participant Hydration study , 100 worker randomly select participate Heat study . Data study collect 3 period Hydration Study ( November , January , March ) . When Heat Sub-study participant data collect Hydration Study , investigator collect additional information participant .</detailed_description>
