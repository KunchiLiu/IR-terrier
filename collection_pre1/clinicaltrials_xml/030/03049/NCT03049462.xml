	<brief_summary>Background : Brown adipose tissue ( BAT ) type fat body . It may prevent weight gain , improve insulin sensitivity , reduce fatty liver . Researchers want see BAT help body burn energy . Objective : To learn BAT work burn energy . Eligibility : Healthy people age 18-40 body mass index 18 40 Design : Participants screen : Medical history Physical exam Blood , urine , heart test Dietitian interview Participants overnight baseline visit . This include : Repeats screen test Exercise test Scans . For one scan , radioactive substance inject arm . FSIVGIT : An IV insert vein right leave arm . Glucose insulin inject one arm . Blood glucose insulin level measure . Metabolic suite : Participants stay 18 19 hour room measure metabolic rate . Monitors body measure heart rate , movement , temperature . Optional fat biopsy : A small piece tissue remove needle . Participants take 2-4 pill daily 4 week . All woman take drug mirabegron . Men randomly get either drug placebo . All participant visit 2 week pill . They repeat screen test . Participants overnight visit 2 week later . They repeat baseline test . Participants keep food medication diary . Participants follow-up visit 2 week stop pill . This include heart test .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Physiological Responses Adaptation Brown Adipose Tissue Chronic Treatment With Beta 3-Adrenergic Receptor Agonists</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Background issue controversy More ever , rise rate obesity diabetes . As opposed white fat store excess calorie , brown fat also know brown adipose tissue BAT consume energy generate heat . In setting increase food consumption cold-exposure , study show human BAT becomes active , potentially combat weight gain . Other emerge evidence indicate human BAT may endocrine organ , release hormone blood regulate organ like skeletal muscle , liver , insulinreleasing pancreatic beta-cell . However , alongside promising study people believe enough BAT human functionally relevant , contribute little heat generation overall health . Purpose/Rationale propose study One principal reason skepticism ability utilize human BAT much compare small animal BAT activation show promise . Therefore , critical step develop medicine grow BAT people evaluate kind health benefit achieve . Specific objectives This study administer clinically-available beta 3-AR agonist , mirabegron ( Myrbetriq , Astellas Pharma ) . We determine whether increase BAT volume activity people take medication daily four week . Our current goal see chronic administration mirabegron lead increase BAT volume metabolic activity produce health benefit . Key element involve At begin study , participant undergo series test determine baseline amount BAT , blood sugar status , level specify hormone . The test take place course two day inpatient Metabolic Patient Care Unit NIH Clinical Center . Participants take medication placebo four week time continue standard daily routine . At two week , participant return one day assessment interim change validate safety . At end four week second set inpatient test two day . Participants bring back two week finish study follow-up safety visit , time receive ECG heart rate monitoring . Primary outcomes The primary outcome change BAT metabolic activity measure 18F-FDG PET/CT . Secondary endpoint examine multiple factor , include body weight , fat mass , glucose tolerance , change level hormone , improve liver function .</detailed_description>
