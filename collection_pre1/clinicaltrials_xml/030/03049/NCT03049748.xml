	<brief_title>Self-Management App Patients With Left-Ventricular Assist Devices</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>About 250,000 5.8 million Americans suffer advanced end-stage heart failure . Generally , individual require heart transplant mechanical circulatory support left-ventricular assist device ( LVAD ) . LVAD implanted liberate patient cripple symptom heart failure , case avert imminent death . However , maintain health improve quality life ( QOL ) depend `` trouble-free '' LVAD . Despite refinement circulatory support technology , many patient family caregiver still face challenge manage LVAD home setting . The LVAD home-care regimen comprise complex technical non-technical task procedure must implement frequently consistently . During first 6 month follow hospital discharge , patients/caregivers generally exhibit low level confidence ( i.e. , self-efficacy ) managing tasks/procedures . This problem appear contribute low adherence regimen poor outcome . The current self-management process include provision instructional manual log vital sign , LVAD parameter , etc . To address problem , research team develop mobile phone VAD Care App self-management tool . The app aid may ease patients/caregivers ' problem manage complexity home-care regimen . The app offer patients/caregivers ( ) daily reminders tasks/procedures perform , ( b ) videoconferencing feature communicate healthcare provider LVAD health issue , ( c ) on-line LVAD training/education . The prototype app test 16 patient caregiver . Results include ease use high acceptability competency rate among users.The specific aim present study obtain preliminary efficacy data care app self-management tool patient long-term LVAD . This study employ randomize control trial establish preliminary estimate effect care app following : ( 1 ) patient caregiver ' self-efficacy ( 2 ) adherence LVAD home-care regimen ; ( 3 ) LVAD-related complication healthcare utilization ; ( 4 ) patient ' overall health status ( 5 ) QOL . A total 40 patient-caregiver dyad recruit . There 20 patients/caregivers allocate control ( usual care ) experimental ( usual care + VAD Care App ) group . Data collection perform pre-hospital discharge ( baseline ) 1 , 3 6 month post discharge use self-administered questionnaire , chart review , interview , retrieval historical data care app . Descriptive inferential statistical procedure employ data analysis . The outcome pilot inform next stage investigation crucial transform LVAD self-management process improve outcome .</detailed_description>
