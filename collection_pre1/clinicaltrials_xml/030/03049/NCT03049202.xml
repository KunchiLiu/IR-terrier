	<brief_summary>Obstructive lung disease increase global health problem pandemic proportion , COPD alone affect &gt; 10 % population . Smoking main well study risk factor develop COPD . However , chronic airway obstruction also never-smoking population recently recognize increase health problem . In clinical segment ( PI : Prof. C. Magnus Skold ) , 1000 subject Swedish national SCAPIS study clinically well characterized one six Swedish University Hospital Respiratory clinic ( clinical site PIs : Anders Andersson , Leif Bjermer , Anders Blomberg , Christer Janson , Lennart Persson , Magnus Skold ) . This first screen include never-smokers COPD identify SCAPIS study . A subset 300 subject group Healthy never-smokers , current-smokers normal lung function , current-smokers COPD , ex-smokers COPD , never-smokers COPD select Bronchoscopy segment , sample perform number anatomical location , include bronchial biopsy , airway epithelial brushing , bronchoalveolar lavage . Serum , plasma , urine sample also collect . In system medicine segment ( PI : Assoc . prof Asa M. Wheelock ) , alteration epigenetic , mRNA , microRNA , proteome , metabolome microbiome level perform multiple lung compartment ( airway epithelium , alveolar macrophage , exosomes , bronchoalveolar exudate ) . By mean biostatistics bioinformatics approach , specific mediator molecular pathway critical pathological mechanism obstructive lung disease relate never-smoker disease phenotype identify . In immunohistochemistry segment ( PI : Prof. Jonas Erjefalt ) , number molecule relevance disease pathology investigate bronchial biopsy collect 300 subject Bronchoscopy segment .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>BROnchoalveolar Investigations Never-smokers With Chronic Obstruction From Swedish CardioPulmonary bioImage Study</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease ( COPD ) umbrella diagnosis define obstructive lung function impairment , likely cause multitude etiology include environmental exposure , genetic predisposition developmental factor . Due heterogeneity disease , molecular mechanistic sub-phenotyping COPD represent essential step facilitate development relevant diagnostic treatment option constantly grow patient group . In BRONCHO-SCAPIS study , molecular sub-phenotypes smoking-induced COPD investigate . A particular focus relate recent epidemiological indication increase proportion never-smokers develop disease . The study encompass profile mRNA , miRNA , proteome , metabolomes lipid mediator multiple lung compartment ( airway epithelium , alveolar macrophage , exosomes , bronchoalveolar exudate ) use range 'omics platform , combination extensive clinical phenotyping early stage COPD patient , never-smokers , smoker normal lung function gender . The primary objective study identify molecular sub-phenotypes never-smokers COPD , specifically correlate clinical phenotype multi-molecular 'omics profile multiple lung compartment early stage COPD patient compare healthy at-risk control population . Secondary goal involve identification subset prognostic/diagnostic biomarkers classification define subgroup , well relevant pharmaceutical target .</detailed_description>
