	<brief_summary>The purpose study perform longitudinal high-resolution 7T MRI participant first-episode psychosis ( FEP ) enrol ongoing randomize control clinical trial ( RCT ) cognitive training . The investigator seek determine whether 12-week course intensive cognitive training auditory processing young FEP patient deliver remotely stand-alone treatment neuroprotective neural tissue loss auditory cortex ( superior temporal gyrus , STG ) , possibly cortical region . The investigator also observe effect train white matter integrity brain .</brief_summary>
