	<detailed_description>Cardiovascular disease remain main cause death type 2 diabetes . Most attributed atherosclerosis elevate blood pressure , though even correct factor , patient type 2 diabetes still increase risk develop cardiac failure , mainly diastolic dysfunction . This phenomenon also describe diabetic cardiomyopathy . Although much know aetiology disease , compel evidence animal research increase intracellular cardiac fat accumulation mitochondrial dysfunction , see type 2 diabetes , may play part development . The reason reduce mitochondrial function diabetic cardiomyopathy completely understood , however gene regulatory pathway peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor alpha ( PPAR-α ) identify important determinant shift substrate metabolism regulation oxidative metabolism type 2 diabetes . In animal study , role PPARα test extensively . In mice cardiac-restricted overexpression PPARα ( MHC-PPAR ) , find PPAR-α involved upregulation CPT-1 mitochondrion , increase uptake long-chain fatty acid mitochondrion facilitate fatty acid undergo beta-oxidation . Chronic exposure elevate FFAs regulate PPAR-α rodent cardiomyocytes , would decrease cardiac function inhibition FA oxidation increase intracellular fat accumulation . It therefore speculate increase fatty acid availability type 2 diabetes obesity ( due excessive fat mass ) lead decrease cardiac PPAR-α metabolism thereby decrease mitochondrial metabolism , turn parallel increased cardiac fat accumulation cardiac lipotoxicity . So far , human study PPAR expression heart scarce . Marfella et al . find unaltered expression PPAR-α patient metabolic syndrome . Conversely , Anderson et al. , show slightly reduce PPAR-α protein level slightly high PGC1α level diabetic atrial tissue , though difference reach statistical significance cohort patient . As study perform small group subject fail determine down-stream target PPAR metabolism mitochondrial function , remain unclear whether like animal study also human reduce PPAR-a expression relate mitochondrial dysfunction . Therefore need study explore role PPAR-a human heart connection oxidative metabolism cardiac function . Mice lack cardiac lipase ATGL ( ATGL-/- mouse ) actually due reduction PPAR metabolism , cardiomyopathy mouse could completely prevent treating animal synthetic PPAR-a ligand . Very interestingly , patient mutation ATGL gene also characterize excessive cardiac muscle fat accumulation reduce mitochondrial function . Treating two patient mutation ( rare mutation ) PPAR-agonist ( bezafibrate ) result improved mitochondrial function reduction muscle cardiac lipid accumulation . These data support notion disturb PPAR metabolism may involve development cardiomyopathy , also human . However , unfortunately , limited data PPAR-expression fail human diabetic heart . Therefore need study validate mechanism human , finding might great consequence ; prevention treatment cardiac lipid accumulation drug improve mitochondrial function , PPAR-agonists , might value patient type 2 diabetes . Also cardiac disease , chronic heart failure ischemic heart disease , suggest fat accumulation mitochondrial dysfunction may play role , mean patient might benefit well treatment drug target mitochondrial function . Although compelling evidence mitochondrial function play important role cardiac metabolism , measure cardiac mitochondrial function non-invasively vivo remain challenge . In vivo mitochondrial function estimate non-invasively 31P-Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy ( 31P-MRS ) , whereby ratio Phospho-creatine ( PCr ) Adenosine Triphosphate ( ATP ) measure ( PCr/ATP-ratio ) . Several study show ratio reduce patient type 2 diabetes , low PCr/ATP ratio predict mortality patient cardiac failure15-17 . In skeletal muscle show PCr-resynthesis strongly correlate mitochondrial oxidative capacity18 . However , method heart truly reflect mitochondrial function human reveal . In 31P-MRS 2 dimensional measurement method use , multiple slice plan heart . One slice plan directly base heart plane valve contain ventricular septal tissue chamber . Here signal acquisition spectrum derive . This method validate golden standard mitochondrial function : ex vivo respirometry cardiac tissue19 . Thus , mitochondrial respiration rate measure tissue homogenate exposure different substrate , stimulate different complex electron transport chain mitochondrion . One issue mitochondrial respiration may differ atrial ventricular tissue . However , despite difference absolute respiration rate , behaviour different complex relative respiration rate ( complex ) show strongly related19 . Since relatively easy obtain atrial appendage cardiac tissue surgery , investigator propose use atrial tissue obtain surgery validate 31P-MRS tool determine mitochondrial function . The investigator use broad range patient guarantee range cardiac mitochondrial function , examine cardiac mitochondrial function indeed reduce type 2 diabetic patient . However , 31P-MRS still technique development distance receiver coil crucial obtain spectra good quality , investigator intend include men time ( increase breast mass woman may decrease signal noise ratio hence spectral quality analysis ) . Therefore , validation method apply male population study .</detailed_description>
