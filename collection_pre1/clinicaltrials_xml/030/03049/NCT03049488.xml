	<brief_summary>Background : RSV virus infects lung breathe passage . Healthy adult infect generally mild cold symptom week two . But also serious , especially infant old adult . It spread direct indirect contact respiratory secretion . Researchers want study new vaccine prevent RSV . Objective : To see vaccine RSV safe cause side effect . Eligibility : Healthy adult 18 50 year old Design : Participants screen different protocol . Participants 13 visit 1 year . Some participant receive vaccine . Some receive vaccine mixed alum , could make body respond vaccine well . All receive dose injection upper arm . They receive two dos , one beginning study another 12 week later . Participants watch 1 hour injection . They call 1 day . They keep track temperature side effect 7 day . Participants receive ruler measure change skin injection site . At visit , participant check health change problem . They may blood drawn . At visit , participant sample take nose mouth .</brief_summary>
