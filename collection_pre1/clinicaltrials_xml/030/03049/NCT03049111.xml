	<brief_title>Screening Inhaled Allergen Challenge Dermatophagoides Farinae</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Asthma increasingly common chronic illness among child adult , allergen exposure among common common trigger asthma exacerbation . Exacerbations allergic asthma characterize early phase response ( EPR ) , mediate release preform mediator like histamine mast cell , late phase response ( LPR ) 3-7 hour later mediate chemokines cytokine attract leukocyte neutrophil eosinophil airway , increase mucus production , trigger airway smooth muscle contraction , result airway constriction airway hyperreactivity ( AHR ) . The LPR occur absence EPR . The LPR think predominantly responsible symptom associate acute exacerbation allergic asthma often used measure efficacy trial asthma therapeutic . This group take particular interest target inflammatory cytokine , Interleukin-1β , involve early late phase asthmatic response inhale allergen allergic asthmatic . In lung , interleukin 1 beta ( IL-1β ) produce numerous cell type ( include epithelial cell , macrophage , neutrophil , eosinophil , mast cell ) , signal receptor induce transcription pro-inflammatory gene ( 17-19 ) . IL-1β increase bronchoalveolar lavage fluid person symptomatic asthma vs. asymptomatic asthma ; likewise , immunohistochemistry bronchial biopsy allergic asthmatic reveal increase expression IL-1β bronchial epithelial cell macrophage . Previous study animal vitro model demonstrate IL-1β directly impact three aspect airway inflammatory response : 1 ) . granulocyte ( neutrophil/eosinophil ) recruitment ; 2 ) . non-specific ( 23 , 24 ) allergen-specific airway reactivity ; 3 ) . production clearance airway mucous . Supporting literature preliminary study human subject promote study IL-1 blockade mitigating feature acute allergen-induced asthma exacerbation . The role IL-1 allergen challenge model fully define . In study examine 12 asthmatic allergic D. farinae research center , find 9/12 asthmatic great 10 % reduction force expiratory volume 1 second ( FEV1 ) inhale dust mite challenge . These individual consider responder . It notable compare post-allergen level cytokines responder non-responders much great concentration IL-1β post-challenge sputum responder vs. nonresponders , Furthermore , within responder , post challenge IL-1β also significantly correlate sputum eosinophil concentration ( r=0.83 , P &lt; 0.05 ) neutrophil concentration ( r=0.89 , P &lt; 0.05 ) 24 hour allergen challenge . These data suggest IL-1β may play role immediate airway hyperresponsiveness late phase recruitment inflammatory cell ( neutrophil eosinophil ) inhale allergen challenge . In order well understand role IL-1β allergen-induced airway inflammation , induce sputum obtain determine high baseline sputum IL-1β concentration large increase IL-1β follow allergen challenge impact non-specific airway hyperresponsiveness ( via methacholine challenge ) , sputum granulocyte recruitment ( neutrophil eosinophil count exhale nitric oxide ( eNO ) , marker airway eosinophilia ) , change expression inflammatory allergy-related gene . To last point , little known mechanism contribute response pattern allergic asthmatic undergo allergen challenge . Changes gene expression occur window time EPR LPR , expression change may dictate whether LPR occurs extent occur . The goal screen protocol identify subject exhibit EPR LPR eligible enrollment yet develop Il-1β protocol . Subjects undergo baseline methacholine challenge establish reactivity , allergen exposure , follow 24 hour later methacholine challenge .</detailed_description>
