	<detailed_description>Psoriasis affect 2-3 % American population . Psoriasis involve less 10 % BSA absence joint involvement tend treat locally . More 80 % people psoriasis &lt; 10 % BSA involvement . A wide variety therapy currently exist , include topical corticosteroid Vit D analog , oral immunosuppressant , retinoid agent , phototherapy . Given prevalence localize psoriasis dissatisfaction treatment , investigation localize treatment priority researcher goal improve current standard care . UV light wavelength 10nm - 380nm , slightly short wavelength visible light . The UV light classify narrow spectrum ( UVB light wavelength 280-315 nm ) . UVA wavelength 315-400nm . Tanning bed use UV light produce effect . Whole body ultraviolet B ( UVB ) phototherapy efficacious recommend first line option selective psoriasis treatment recommendation . In pregnancy , UVB therapy recommend first line treatment extensive plaque guttate psoriasis . Although UVB phototherapy include guideline psoriasis treatment , use come without risk . Toxicities include cataract formation , herpes reactivation , photoaging , long-term exposure may lead increase risk genital tumor male . In addition , use UVB rarely use first-line treatment localize psoriasis probably due financial issue increase requirement clinic visit . Narrowband UVB therapy ( emission 311- 313nm ) superior broad-band UVB light , reduce toxicity . Psoriatic plaque withstand much high dose UV light surround uninvolved skin ; UV treatment involve skin therefore offer increase efficacy few treatment . In addition , localize treatment may remain remission even 4 month clear localize laser treatment . Localized treatment therefore favorable treatment option psoriasis , use high dos spar healthy skin .</detailed_description>
