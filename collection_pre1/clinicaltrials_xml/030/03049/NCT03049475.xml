	<brief_summary>Background : Sickle Cell Disease ( SCD ) blood disorder occur mainly people African descent . Researchers want learn painful attack complication associate SCD . They want look relationship SCD specific change blood . They want study role genetics , inflammation , blood clot factor SCD . They blood sample collect acute painful attack attack . Objective : To learn painful attack complication associate SCD . Eligibility : People age 18-80 SCD healthy Africans African Americans without SCD Design : - Participants screen medical history physical exam . - Healthy participant one visit . - Participants SCD first visit pain attack . They next visit pain attack . About 3-4 month attack , final visit . - Visits include physical exam , blood urine test . - Participants may blood sample use genetic test research .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Episodic pain common acute morbidity lead cause hospitalization patient sickle cell disease . It cause microvaso-occlusion induced sickled red blood cell , outcome polymerization deoxygenate hemoglobin S ( HbS ) . Factors contribute acute sickle pain include release cell-free DNA ( cfDNA ) heme initiate downstream event involve inflammation thrombosis , ischemia-reperfusion injury . Cell-free DNA show present plasma healthy subject , elevate disease condition characterize increase cell death necrosis apoptosis . Indeed , previously show cfDNA patient sickle cell disease ( SCD ) increase dramatically acute painful episode . During acute sickle pain , mark elevation plasma hemoglobin also observe due acute increase sickled red blood cell hemolysis . Both cfDNA heme ( break product hemoglobin ) act damage-associated molecular pattern ( DAMP ) molecule , initiate endothelial inflammation , stimulation neutrophil extracellular trap ( NET ) formation , leukocyte recruitment , microvascular thrombosis . Although several study cytokines chemokines steady state acute sickle cell disease , comprehensive study inflammatory marker correlate quantitative level profile cfDNA . In study , would like apply next generation sequencing ( NGS ) analyze cfDNA plasma patient SCD steadystate , painful crisis derive insight origin tissue damage . In parallel free plasma DNA , propose measure marker hemolysis inflammation ( cytokine , chemokines ) , investigate interaction circulate molecule blood cell ( e.g . neutrophil ) potential modulate progress severity disease . In addition , would also like explore distinctive cell-free DNA inflammatory signature SCD steady-state acute vaso-occlusive crisis . Overall , study provide opportunity evaluate new biomarkers sickle cell pain crisis predict disease severity prognosis . These measure may allow u good understand role vaso-occlusion , hemolysis , inflammation-related event response serve clinical endpoint future study disease pathogenesis and/or therapeutic intervention sickle cell disease .</detailed_description>
