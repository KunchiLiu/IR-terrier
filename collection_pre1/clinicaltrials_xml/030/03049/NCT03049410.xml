	<brief_summary>This prospective multicentre randomise control trial compare outcome Intracorporeal RARC ( iRARC ) open radical cystectomy ( ORC ) patient bladder cancer . The study recruit patient non-muscle invasive bladder cancer ( NMIBC ) muscle invasive bladder cancer ( MIBC ) select radical cystectomy treatment bladder cancer . The time interest measurement primary outcomes 90 day post-surgery . Eligible patient include receive neo-adjuvant chemotherapy ( typically gemcitabine cisplatin ) either ileal conduit neo-bladder reconstruction . Patients select radical cystectomy appropriate counselling follow specialist multi-disciplinary team ( SMDT ) recommendation , approach ask consent study . Consenting participant randomise 1:1 either iRARC ORC . Patients follow minimum 90 day post-surgery . The study conduct NHS Trusts designate Cancer Centres . Patients stratify - Type urinary diversion ( Continent diversion ileal conduit ) - Performance status - Centre Trial assessment conduct baseline ( surgery ) , whilst participant admission 5 , 12 , 24 week 1 year post surgery .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Trial Compare Robotically Assisted Radical Cystectomy With Open Radical Cystectomy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Radical cystectomy ( RC ) represent gold standard treatment invasive bladder cancer . Reductions morbidity mortality operation occur recent year refine anaesthesia , surgical technique , centralization service high volume centre . The multimodal concept enhance recovery RC ( ERAS ) , include pre , intra post operative step , also help reduce length stay complication RC . For abdominal surgery , recognize minimally invasive surgery less morbid open surgery , produce improvement post-operative recovery without alter curative nature procedure . However , date , little conflict evidence benefit minimally invasive surgery open surgery RC . This may reflect complex nature procedure ( involve surgery urinary gastro-intestinal tract ) , limitation current evidence benefit . To date , three prospective trial compare RARC open RC ( ORC ) . However , limited sample size design , application RARC extra-corporeal reconstruction yet report . The investigator believe study ( report plan ) compare optimal RARC ( e.g . intra-corporeal reconstruction ) optimal ORC ( e.g . high volume centre use ERAS ) . In addition , investigator believe none adequately assess rehabilitation RC . As , investigator propose prospective RCT randomize eligible patient either ORC RARC . The investigator focus upon measure functional recovery return normal activity .</detailed_description>
