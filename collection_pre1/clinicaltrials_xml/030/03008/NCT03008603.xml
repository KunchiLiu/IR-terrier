	<detailed_description>This prospective , single-arm study evaluate safety , effectiveness usability XACT device . The study approve Institutional Review Board ( IRB ) participate center prior patient enrollment . Subjects undergo CT-guided , minimally invasive percutaneous procedure interventional radiology suite , e.g. , core biopsy , fine needle aspiration ( FNA ) , tumor ablation , etc. , willing sign inform consent document screen compliance study inclusion exclusion criterion . A total thirty ( 30 ) subject enrol study 2-4 medical center . The intention recruit subject , cover variety CT-guided interventional procedure variety different procedural tool may use device . Investigators screen patient base inclusion/exclusion criterion describe subject ' demographic , general medical history , medical condition/indication , coagulation factor , concomitant medication vital sign obtain . Clinical accuracy primary efficacy endpoint define ability place instrument procedural tool location suitable plan intervention . The investigator review final instrument position post-placement CT image determine pre-operative planned target reach . This information use calculate success rate . Additionally , usability XACT device evaluate use rating scale assess ease device setup , device operation , pre-operative planning , robot positioning , guide needle advancement . The total time procedure record , number CT scan perform radiation dose ( DLP CTDI ) . The distance tip needle/tool target , XACT robot reach pre-defined target measure order determine system accuracy quantitative term use system tool .</detailed_description>
