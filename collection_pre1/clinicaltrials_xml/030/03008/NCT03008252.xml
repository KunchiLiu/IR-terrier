	<detailed_description>In last year , new clinical entity emerge include patient consider suffer problem cause wheat and/or gluten ingestion , even though celiac disease ( CD ) wheat allergy . This clinical condition name non-celiac gluten sensitivity ( NCGS ) , although recent article , researcher suggest term `` non-celiac wheat sensitivity '' ( NCWS ) , know date component wheat actually cause symptom . Other area doubt NCWS regard pathogenesis , paper report intestinal immunologic activation , others link NCWS dietary short chain carbohydrate ( fermentable oligo-di-monosaccharides polyols , FODMAPs ) load . The researcher recently demonstrate high proportion patient NCWS develop autoimmune disorder , antinuclear antibody ( ANA ) positive , show DQ2/DQ8 haplotype compare patient irritable bowel syndrome ( IBS ) , support immunologic involvement NCWS . The clinical picture NCWS characterize combined gastrointestinal ( bloat , abdominal pain , diarrhea and/or constipation , nausea , epigastric pain , gastroesophageal reflux , aphthous stomatitis ) extra-intestinal systemic manifestation ( headache , depression , anxiety , 'foggy mind , ' tiredness , dermatitis skin rash , fibromyalgia-like joint/muscle pain , leg arm numbness , anemia ) . Lactose intolerance cow 's milk protein allergy ( CMPA ) two condition high prevalence general population large overlap NCWS lactose intolerance CMPA symptom . Therefore , aim present study investigate 1 ) prevalence positive lactose breath test DBPC cow 's milk protein challenge NCWS patient self-reported gastrointestinal extra-intestinal symptom relate milk and/or milk derivates ingestion , 2 ) clinical , serological , histological characteristic NCWS patient lactose intolerance CMPA comparison NCWS patient without lactose intolerance CMPA .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>All NCWS patient meet recently propose criterion : negative serum antitissue transglutaminase antiendomysium ( EmA ) IgA IgG antibodies absence intestinal villous atrophy IgEmediated immunoallergy test negative wheat cow 's milk protein ( skin prick test and/or serum specific IgE detection ) . Adjunctive criterion adopt patient : resolution gastrointestinal extraintestinal symptom standard elimination diet , without wheat , cow 's milk , egg , tomato , chocolate , food ( ) causing selfreported symptom symptom reappearance doubleblind placebocontrolled ( DBPC ) wheat challenge , perform describe previously . Exclusion criterion : age &lt; 18 year positive EmA culture medium duodenal biopsy , even villi crypt ratio duodenal mucosa normal selfexclusion wheat diet refusal reintroduce enter study organic cutaneous and/or gastrointestinal disease concomitant treatment steroid and/or antihistamine . Lactose intolerance CMPA diagnose , patient selfreported gastrointestinal extraintestinal symptom relate milk and/or milk derivates ingestion , use lactose breath test DBPC cow 's milk protein challenge , respectively .</criteria>
