CINV one distress severe side effect cancer treatment significant impact patient 's quality life . The chemotherapy agent cause bad degree nausea vomit categorize two group : moderately emetogenic chemotherapy ( MEC ) highly emetogenic chemotherapy ( HEC ) . Nausea vomit occurs within first day administration chemotherapy agent consider acute CINV , nausea vomit follow 24 hour administration chemotherapy agent consider delayed CINV . Refractory CINV occur patient develop CINV subsequent cycle chemotherapy drug prevent vomit nausea ( antiemetic prophylaxis ) successful control CINV early cycle . The purpose study assess efficacy Akynzeo treatment refractory CINV</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Combination Netupitant Palonosetron ( Akynzeo® ) Treatment Refractory CINV</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This Phase II , single-center , single-arm , open-label , feasibility trial use fix dose combination netupitant palonosetron ( Akynzeo® ) treatment refractory CINV . The primary aim study feasibility , define 70 % completion rate study procedures 7 day . Eligible subject identify weekly palliative care patient triage meeting . Patients 18 year age old , histologically confirm cancer , confirm refractory CINV eligible . After obtain write informed consent verify study subject meet eligibility criterion , subject enrol study University California San Diego ( UCSD ) Moores Cancer Center Clinical Trials Office . Subjects allow participate study . Study Day 1 day Akynzeo® dosing . Subjects receive single capsule Akynzeo® ( 300 mg netupitant 0.5 mg palonosetron ) Study 1 . Study drug may take without food . Subjects complete study drug diary document date time Akynzeo® administration . On Study Day 1 , study coordinator educate subject complete Multinational Association Supportive Care Cancer ( MASCC ) Antiemesis Tool , Functional Living Index Emesis ( FLIE ) scale , medication diary document complete day .
