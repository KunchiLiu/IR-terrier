	<brief_title>Targeting Pulmonary Perfusion Alpha-1 Antitrypsin Deficiency</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Emphysema common type lung disease patient alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency ( AATD ) . Emphysema refers destruction fine network air space blood vessel lung , result look like `` hole '' lung . Emphysema associate increase risk death currently medication , except replacement alpha-1 antitrypsin ( AAT ) , show treat emphysema . The study plan enroll subject alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency-associated lung disease ( PiZZ phenotype ) augmentation therapy perform cross-over randomize control trial ( RCT ) aspirin compare placebo perform withdrawal study augmentation therapy , test hypothesis aspirin effective improving blood flow lung reduce damage endothelial cell . The study 2 phase : randomize cross-over phase withdrawal phase . Subjects randomize receive aspirin placebo 2 week . There 2-week washout period , participant cross receive treatment ( receive aspirin first receive placebo receive placebo first receive aspirin ) . Then withdrawal AAT augmentation therapy , subject ask stop AAT augmentation therapy 5 week . This allow AAT level drop briefly see absence AAT augmentation .</detailed_description>
