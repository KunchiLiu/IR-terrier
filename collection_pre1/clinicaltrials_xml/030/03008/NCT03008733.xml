The main objective pilot study provide descriptive analysis morphology nerve ultra high frequency ultrasound subgroup CIDP patient , anti-MAG antibody neuropathy NMMBC control . The thickness epineurium , hallmarks fascicular organization , Doppler vascularity , nerve-sectional area , specification section surface , nerve hypertrophy , thickness perineurium ultrastructural characterization different fascicular organization typology well analyzed order well understand specific sonographic characteristic disease compare control , data exist present literature image resolution . Secondary objective : 1 . Compare morphological characteristic obtain ultra high frequency ultrasound different subject subgroups accord morphological data collect sonographic score : evaluation nerve hypertrophy ( intra- inter-ratio nerve nerve ) ( 4 ) intra-fascicular nerve nerve cross-ratio . 2 . To study correlation sonographic clinical score score different subject subgroups use functional assessment scale : MRC score , R-ODS score , INCAT , ONLS , ataxia Score torque rating grip strength . 3 . To study correlation sonographic score electrophysiological score make électroneurogramme ( ENG ) different subject subgroup : amplitude distal motor latency distal motor conduction , motor conduction velocity , presence time dispersion conduction block step motor conduction , latency waveform F proximal motor conduction amplitude sensory potential sensory conduction .</detailed_description>
