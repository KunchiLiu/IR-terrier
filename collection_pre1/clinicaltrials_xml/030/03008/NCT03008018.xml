	<detailed_description>The aim study evaluate safety/tolerability , pharmacokinetic , pharmaco-dynamic effect KA2507 establish maximum tolerate dose ( MTD ) . Patients PD-L1 express solid tumor relapse refractory prior treatment eligible participate study . Following completion multiple ascend dose study , protocol may amend include expansion cohort patient melanoma and/or solid tumor . This multiple ascend dosing ( MAD ) study 5 treatment regimen cohort base use 3+3 design ( 30 patient overall ) . The principal objective establish maximum tolerated dose , safety , tolerability pharmacokinetic ( PK ) profile blood urine HDAC6 inhibitor patient solid tumor explore effect pharmacodynamic marker target engagement response treatment . Daily/twice daily dos give open label monotherapy . A review safety PK data conduct last patient cohort reach day 28 treatment . The review confirm dose use subsequent cohort . Dose escalation continue MTD reach . Upon completion dose escalation phase study , dose expansion phase plan . Patients respond treatment may elect remain therapy disease progression , death investigator decide stop treatment .</detailed_description>
