	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To determine safe dose olaparib ramucirumab , exceed olaparib dose 300 mg twice daily ( tablet formulation ) . ( Phase I ) II . To determine efficacy olaparib plus ramucirumab measure objective response rate ( ORR ) . ( Phase II ) . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . To estimate median progression-free survival ( PFS ) . II . To estimate median overall survival ( OS ) . III . To measure prevalence BROCA-HR biomarker study population . IV . To determine toxicity olaparib ramucirumab combination . V. To evaluate effect regimen quality life score European Organization Research Treatment Cancer Quality Life Questionnaire-Core 30 ( EORTC QLQ-C30 ) . TERTIARY OBJECTIVES : I . To assess correlation Myriad homologous recombination deficiency ( HRD ) assay result , signature 3 status , mutation BROCA-HR panel . II . To evaluate association finding BROCA-HR panel , Myriad HRD assay , signature 3 result response therapy . III . To determine result immunoassay poly-ADP-ribosylated ( PAR ) substrates tumor tissue . IV . To create PDX model study DNA repair gastric tumor treat PARP inhibitor ( PARPi ) pre-treatment biopsy repeat biopsy 16 week treatment . V. Biobank additional tumor tissue future genomic analysis . VI . Biobank peripheral blood future genomic analysis assessment circulate tumor deoxyribonucleic acid ( DNA ) . OUTLINE : This phase I , dose-escalation study olaparib follow phase II study . Patients receive olaparib orally ( PO ) twice daily ( BID ) day 1-14 ramucirumab intravenously ( IV ) 60 minute day 1 . Courses repeat every 14 day absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . After completion study treatment , patient follow 4 week every 6 week thereafter .</detailed_description>
