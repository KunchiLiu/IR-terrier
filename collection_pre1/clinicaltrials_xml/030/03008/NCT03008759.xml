	<brief_summary>The literature recognize fluoride widely use study mean dental remineralization . The use fluoride toothpaste brushing consider rational method prevention caries . However , current challenge toothpaste substantivity , new compound introduce formulation . This study aim evaluate vivo effect fluoride dentifrice contain nanoencapsulated Fluoride ( Nano-F ) - fluoride retention saliva dental plaque . A study clinical laboratory type , crossover , double-blind , randomize held . After sample calculation , total 12 individual age 18 35 year old , healthy , decayed , miss , fill teeth index le 6 resident brazilian northeast capital part sample . Fluoride bioavailability evaluate biofilm saliva use fluoridate weekly . The biofilm assess 1h 12 h brushing ; unstimulated saliva time 3 , 15 , 30 , 45 , 60 minute 12 hour . It 3 toothpaste : 50 % Nanoencapsulated Fluoride , 100 % Nanoencapsulated Fluoride Free sodium fluoride . Between week use , brush extend washout ( without fluoride ) avoid carryover effect . inferential data analysis carry , consider amount alpha &lt; 0.05 . So knowing caries dynamic process , large fluoride retention oral fluid promote Nanoencapsulated Fluoride may important impact Des-Re process control dental caries</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>1 . Study design It quantitative study double-blind randomize crossover clinical type inductive approach documentation technical direct observation measurement laboratory . In order ass bioavailability intraoral fluoride week use fluoride toothpastes contain Nanoencapsulated Fluoride , collect biofilm sample 1h 12 h brushing ; unstimulated saliva time 3 , 15 , 30 , 45 , 60 minute 12 hour . The data obtain physical chemical analysis sample fluoride ( F ) . Therefore , study consist two interrelated step : clinical phase biofilm collection saliva ; laboratory stage fluoride analysis sample . Will conduct pilot test three participant start study . 2 . Sample Size The sample size calculation perform use fluoride concentration data dental biofilm previous study take effect size difference experimental dentifrice ( 100 % Nanoencapsulated Fluoride ) positive control least 3.4 ppm F- biofilm 12 hour , namely , 25 % . Admitting experimental protocol beta error 10 % alpha error 5 % , one-tailed statistical power 90 % , sample size calculate 6 people . For calculation use Excel software mathematical formula clinical trial superiority give . Adding sample loss result 12 people . 3 . Experimental Dentifrice For study use four toothpaste : 50 % Nanoencapsulated Fluoride , 100 % Nanoencapsulated Fluoride , Free sodium fluoride , Without fluoride . The toothpaste , make available company Brazil pack package taste mint . Except wash tube toothpaste identify letter ( A , B C ) independent researcher . The letter code revealed participant researcher accompany . These drawn random daily use seven day four time , give interval one week wash-out . In period wash-out use toothpaste without fluoride . In end , study participant use 5 experimental dentifrice different time . 4 . Clinical phase The participant inform study acceptance , he/she initiate study . Initially clinical examination order report presence exclusion criterion already list . After verify absence criterion , dental prophylaxis pumice removal biofilm case may make supragingival scraping . The patient advise make use fluoride product experiment . At first , volunteer instruct use toothpaste without fluoride ( wash ) first week , order equate study participant eliminate potential carryover effect toothpaste use previously . The participant get tube toothpaste instruct brush teeth 1 minute rinse 10 mL water twice day ( morning night ) . On seventh day , participant instruct brush occlusal surface teeth , allow biofilm accumulation flat surface . When go bed , warn eat drink ( except water ) well brush teeth next day . On follow morning , approximately 12 hour last brushing fasting , first dental biofilm sample unstimulated saliva collect . It use remove biofilm Hollenback vestibular face , interproximal , palatal lingual right hemiarch deposit pre-weighed Eppendorf tube analytical balance . To saliva collection , participant , rest , instruct spit minute graduate glass tube . After , participant brush occlusal surface 1 min rinse 10 mL water . Soon , new collection saliva plaque . Saliva sample give time 3 , 15 , 30 , 45 60 minute brush , biofilm leave hemiarch collect one hour brushing . After collection offer breakfast organize researcher participate crown research center . 5 . Laboratorial phase Samples evaluate physical-chemical analysis fluoride use calibrate fluoride electrode . Samples analyze fluoride concentration use ion-specific electrode diffusion facilitate hexamethyl disiloxane ( HMDS ) . The calibration curve make analysis . All analyze do triplicate submit validation . 6 . Data analysis The study data analyze inferential statistic consider p &lt; 0.05 .</detailed_description>
