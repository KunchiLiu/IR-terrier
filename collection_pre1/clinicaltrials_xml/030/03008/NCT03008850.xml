	<brief_summary>Shivering common post-anesthetic complication occur 65 % patient undergoing spinal epidural anesthesia . Shivering may interfere electrocardiogram , blood pressure oxygen saturation monitoring . In addition , shiver increase oxygen consumption , carbon dioxide production metabolic rate 400 % . Thus , may result problem patient low cardiac pulmonary reserve . Preventing shiver could therefore result well postoperative outcome reduce incidence post-surgical complication .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Shivering Prevention During Cesarean Section Intrathecal Injection Magnesium Sulfate</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Magnesium sulfate ( MgSO4 ) anti-shivering effect . Moreover , potential neuroprotective effect may enhance neuroprotection effect hypothermia . Intrathecal MgSO4 administration provide effective perioperative analgesia prolong period anesthesia sensory blockade without additional side-effects . However , research role MgSO4 prevention shiver focus intravenous infusion drug . Few clinical trial examine effect add intrathecal MgSO4 anesthetic agent bupivacaine suppress anesthesia-related shivering patient . Similar infusion study , hypothesize addition intrathecal injection MgSO4 bupivacaine would improve perioperative shiver female patient undergo elective caesarean section . Few previous study evaluate neuroaxial anti-shivering effect intrathecal magnesium none evaluate anti-shivering effect intrathecal MgSO4 . Therefore , elect use low dosage ( 25 mg MgSO4 ) formerly utilized investigation analgesic effect . Magnesium sulphate intracellular cation various physiologic function enzyme activation , nerve signal conduction , protein synthesis vasomotor tonicity regulation . Magnesium sulphate use various clinical situation include preeclampsia , tocolysis , arrhythmia , myocardial ischemia , bronchial asthma postoperative shivering .</detailed_description>
