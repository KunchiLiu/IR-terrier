	<brief_title>Spiration Valve System 9 mm European Post Market Evaluation Study</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This study design evaluate performance 9 mm valve system patient least one airway treat . Patients severe airflow obstruction , severe emphysema , significant hyperinflation , moderate severe dyspnea eligible evaluate enrollment study . In study , eligible patient severe emphysema target lobe intact fissure . Patients must able tolerate flexible bronchoscopy procedure . After evaluation inclusion exclusion criterion , review CT data core laboratory , patient enrol study . The indication endoscopic reduction pulmonary volume intrabronchial valve present various preliminary examination . The duration study 7 month patient . It involve examination valve insert , valve insert within scope bronchoscopy , follow follow-up examination directly valves insert , follow-up period least 3 night appropriate clinic follow-up visit 14 , 30 , 90 180 day valve insert . The study expect enroll 30 patient complete 6 month follow-up visit 4 site 15 patient per site .</detailed_description>
