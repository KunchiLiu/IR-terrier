	<brief_summary>Neonatal hypothermia associate increase risk mortality well multiple morbidity . The prior HEAT study conduct institution show difference neonatal hypothermia change ambient operate room temperature . The investigator 's objective determine increase ambient operative room temperature decrease rate neonatal morbidity . Operating room temperature randomize current institutional standard 20°C ( 67°F ) temperature 24°C ( 75°F ) , weekly basis period 1.2 year .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>This open , prospective , randomize , single center trial address primary research question : Does increase ambient operate room temperature result low rate composite neonatal morbidity ? During 1.2 year study period , operate room temperature labor delivery adjust either current standard care ambient operating room temperature 20°C ( 67°F ) , maximum temperature allowable per hospital policy current operating room , 24°C ( 75°F ) , determine cluster randomization . Composite neonatal morbidity record include hypoglycemia necessitating treatment ; need respiratory support within first 24 hour ; culture-proven sepsis ; mortality . Association outcomes type passive active warming perform include morbidity stratify gestational age well maternal outcome . In addition , electronic survey administer operating resident physicians assess experience study condition .</detailed_description>
