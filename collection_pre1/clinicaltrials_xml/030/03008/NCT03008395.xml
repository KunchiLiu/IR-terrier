Current evidence suggest standard educational intervention suboptimal . This study evaluate novel approach diabetes self-management use dialogue tool base empowerment motivational communication method . The approach evaluate study call EMMA : empowerment , motivation medical adherence . Participants randomize EMMA treatment usual , treated period 4 month evaluate period 12 month .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The management type 2 diabetes ( T2D ) experience many patient complex . This especially true diabetes management include multiple medical intervention oral agent injectable medication ( insulin , GLP-1 ; DPP-4s ) combination diabetes specific behaviour blood glucose monitoring foot care well healthy lifestyle behaviours physical activity healthy eating . Studies show 40-50 % patient T2D suboptimal adherence self-management recommendation . In general , estimate half patient chronic disease take medication prescribe . Suboptimal medical adherence drive poor glycemic control well poor quality life individual patient mention increase health care cost due comorbidities , reduce work function hospital admission . Suboptimal adherence may drive numerous factor , include lack symptom TD2 ( perceive nonseriousness disease ) , side-effects treatment ( GI distress associate metformin , weight gain associated insulin ) conjunction complex dose regimen , lack knowledge belief efficiency medication , lack motivation , cultural factor well poor instruction judgmental communication healthcare professional patient . There need new method understand driver nonadherence support patient proactively self-manage TD2 . There also need new tool ( i.e. , knowledge translation method ) support healthcare professional engage patient base dialogue ( collaboration ) active patient involvement ( self-management ) , overcome barrier adherence thereby improve ability obtain good glycemic control . The purpose study evaluate self-management support intervention call EMMA : Empowerment , motivation &amp; medical adherence . EMMA concept consist number dialogue tool use diabetes consultation ( see ) . The concept , original form test , feasibility study ( N = 19 T2D ) 2011-12 . The study show significant reduction HbA1c ( EMMA : median decrease 2.0 mmol / mol ( -1.0 3.0 ) versus control : median increase 2.5 mmol / mol ( -2.0 -4.5 ) p = 0.05 ) ( Varming 2012 ; Andrésdóttir 2014 ) . The investigator collaborate Danish group develop EMMA protocol develop train program support diabetes educator delivery intervention . The use EMMA method consistent motivational communication behaviour change counsel . The investigator plan conduct small scale randomize comparison trial EMMA method diabetes service NSHA Central Zone .</detailed_description>
