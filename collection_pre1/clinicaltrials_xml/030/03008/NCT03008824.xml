	<brief_summary>There rapidly escalate epidemic obesity type 2 diabetes across world , fast rise occur low- middle-income country . India one high rate world , disease start young age low level body weight UK white caucasian . Among city-dwelling Indians , approximately 8 % people age 30-40 year already diabetes . This create heavy burden disease disability , intolerable economic burden medical cost lose earnings . Until , effort prevent diabetes mainly focus modifying diet , lifestyle activity at-risk adult ( example overweight , family history diabetes already high blood sugar ) . However , recent research indicate factor act early life ( development womb ) place individual risk later diabetes . These include maternal malnutrition low birthweight , diabetes mother pregnancy . Our research show Indian mother often low vitamin B12 level , turn cause high blood level harmful metabolite ( homocysteine ) . We show mother get diabetes pregnancy . Their child likely bear low birth weight , develop body fat high plasma insulin level childhood , sign higher diabetes risk later life . The risk increase mother normal high status another B vitamin , folate . Thus , show , first time link specific nutritional deficiency mother diabetes risk next generation . One possible mechanism effect maternal nutrition risk diabetes child epigenetic effect , whereby nutritional environment early development affect switch control gene expression . Since switch pass via either parent , think possible paternal vitamin B12 status could also important .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Background : Risk GDM offspring 's metabolic risk : There escalate epidemic type 2 diabetes ( T2D ) across world ethnic group , particular , people South Asian origin . Current strategy prevent T2D rely mainly alter risk factor obesity , sedentary lifestyle healthy eating . Though important , unlikely make big impact escalate epidemic , consumes significant proportion health care budget , world-wide . Some risk develop metabolic disease T2D cardiovascular disorder ( CVD ) evident even birth . Indeed , recent research suggest factor act early development , include foetal growth restriction exposure gestational diabetes ( GDM ) mother increase diabetes obesity risk later life . The investigator recent work show maternal vitamin B12 insufficiency hyper-homocysteinaemia , combination normal/high maternal folate status , associate increase risk GDM mother , growth restriction foetus , adiposity insulin resistance child . GDM describe glucose intolerance first recognise pregnancy . Similar T2D , GDM also increase alarm rate , attribute partly increase maternal age body weight . The current estimate around 4 % pregnancy though could increase much 17 % new IADPSG guideline implement . Women develop GDM 7-8 time high risk T2D13 child bear high risk develop T2D , abdominal obesity metabolic syndrome later life thus increase risk CVD adulthood . Though exact etiological process increase risk clear , effect could act epigenetic mechanism ( intra-uterine programming ) . The study Krishnaveni et al raise intrigue possibility simple measure prevent GDM future T2D . It believe high prevalence B12 insufficiency India attribute vegetarianism . As majority UK population non-vegetarian , conceivable B12 deficiency unlikely pregnancy . However , investigator recently show : ) B12 deficiency uncommon woman childbearing age ( 14 % ) pregnant woman ( 20 % 16-18 week pregnancy ) b ) B12 deficiency GDM associate high BMI high birth weight clinic population . Psychological impact GDM : Mothers screen GDM low perceive well-being . Diagnosis GDM pregnancy often come shock cause significant distress expectant mother . There evidence distress improve treatment , presumably due education support . These limit data come woman Caucasian origin data exists woman South Asian origin . To confirm observation UK multi-ethnic population , investigator plan carry adequately power case-control study examine : ) influence early pregnancy B12 , folate homocysteine level ( well clinical , biochemical genetic marker ) risk GDM offspring 's risk future metabolic disorder measure detailed anthropometry baby along biochemical genetic marker cord blood ; b ) psychological impact diagnosis GDM measuring anxiety distress questionnaire . Hypothesis : Imbalance B12 , folate homocysteine early pregnancy predicts risk GDM mother metabolic risk offspring Research plan methodology : Population : Pregnant woman attend antenatal care UK ; Cases pregnant woman carry singleton foetus , without pre-gestational diabetes , diagnose GDM pregnancy . Equal number South Asian Caucasian mother GDM recruit . Intervention / Exposure : Maternal vitamin B12 , folate homocysteine level early pregnancy ( &lt; 16 week gestation ) Comparison Group : Mothers cohort develop GDM matched age , parity BMI case Study Design : A prospective observational case-control study design compare early pregnancy B12 , folate homocysteine level pregnant woman develop GDM ( case ) ( control ) . Sample size : There publish data rate B12 deficiency GDM woman UK limit data exists non-GDM woman Caucasians . Preliminary result investigator ' group show approximately 15 % insufficiency non-GDM around 20 % -25 % GDM woman Caucasian origin . To detect 5 % difference prevalence B12 insufficiency 90 % power 5 % significance level , 700 GDMs require . We plan identify 1400 control match age , BMI parity . To achieve this,4080 pregnant woman require first trim 2.5 year ( 20 % develop GDM ) . Allowing 10 % drop-out rate age , parity &amp; BMI matching 4500 pregnant mother recruit . Implementation plan : Several study launch plan raise awareness among public , midwifes general practitioner region . The relevant clinical research network ( CRNs ) involve begin raise awareness direct involvement study . Most potential participant give participant information sheet ( PIS ) see book visit community midwife . The midwife ass eligibility study hand PIS fit inclusion criterion . The midwife inform research team mother ' detail via Reply Slip objection contact . The research team contact mother possible , recruitment visit plan coincide book blood date scan appointment ( usually around 12 week gestation ) minimise study visit ( 'Research Team Recruitment ' , see right-hand side Recruitment Flow chart ) . In situation mother identify midwife fit inclusion criterion study ( i.e . high-risk factor GDM therefore refer GTT ) , give PIS book visit , research team send post mother invitation letter . Feedback mother recruitment visit ( i.e . date scan ) suggest mother would happy partake study visit receive PIS 4 main reason : 1 ) study ( PIS ) simple understand ; 2 ) spend significant amount time await scan midwife appointment visit ; 3 ) want blood sample take visit ( mother blood test routinely standard care ) ; 4 ) prefer come back separate visit . The investigator also believe reasonable non-interventional study provide opportunity mother participate study . Therefore mother enough time read understand PIS provide consent , could recruit straightaway blood test do together routine blood day . However , prefers take PIS away time decide , research team see future date . Such strategy also replicate community book visit facilitate participation study . The participant basic demographic information collect anthropometric measurement do recruitment visit ask fill physical activity psychological well-being questionnaire . To facilitate ease fill questionnaire , ever possible patient give iPads complete . We collect blood sample ( approximately 15-20ml addition routine book blood ) , urine stool sample ( optional ) . Mothers OGTT 24-28 week gestation blood , urine stool ( optional ) sample take time study purpose . Modified WHO ( 1998 ) NICE criterion use diagnose gestational diabetes ( i.e . fast plasma glucose â‰¥ 6.1 mmol/l OR fast plasma glucose &lt; 6.1 mmol/l 2 hour plasma glucose &gt; 7.8mmol/l &lt; 11.1 mmol/l 75g glucose tolerance test ) . The criterion change new IADPSG criterion adopt course study ( NICE update criterion ) . The mother ask fill psychological well-being questionnaire wait time OGTT mother subsequently diagnose GDM , attend antenatal-diabetes clinic . The remainder participant 's antenatal care carry joint antenatal-diabetes clinic ( diagnosed GDM ) community ( non-GDM mother , unless indication refer obstetric clinic ) . All participant deliveries one NHS Hospitals involve study . Cord blood , piece cord placental biopsy ( around 2cm ) take time birth well detailed birth neonatal outcome data stool sample baby shortly afterwards . Baby 's body fat content distribution measure 'PEAPOD ' machine . This non invasive , baby friendly way accurately measure fat distribution baby . This optional . For mother Caesarean section ( medical/obstetric reason ) , ask separate consent take sample abdominal fat subcutaneous well myometrial smooth muscle tissue . All sample obtain stored future DNA isolation . During post-natal OGTT GDM mother ( 6 week post-partum ) additional blood sample collect store . Also , well-being questionnaire give participant post-natally . From 3 12 month , breast feeding mother contact either postal questionnaire telephone . Appendices summary additional data collection : 1 . IPAQ ( Physical activity ) questionnaire - baseline 2 . PhQ9 questionnaire - baseline 3 . GAD7 questionnaire - baseline 4 . Warwick - Edinburgh well questionnaire ( WEMWBS ) - baseline , 24-28 week 6 week postpartum OGTT 5 . Euro-QoL - Quality Life measure baseline , 24-28 week 6 week postpartum GTT 6 . Socio-economic measure - baseline , 24-28 week 6 week postpartum GTT 7 . PSQI ( Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index questionnaire ) 8 . Breast feeding questionnaire ( post natal )</detailed_description>
