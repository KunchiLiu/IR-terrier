	<brief_title>A Study Patients Undergoing Total Knee Hip Arthroplasty Regional Hospital Denmark</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Fast-track surgery total knee hip arthroplasty improve markedly recent year decrease hospitalization postoperative complication . In 2014 perform 9000 total hip arthroplasty ( THA ) 8500 total knee arthroplasty operation ( TKA ) Denmark . During year Bornholm 's regional hospital perform 85 THA 's 47 TKA 's operation . Even though initial surgical procedure technical radiological satisfactory , big proportion patient endure dissatisfaction disability total joint replacement ( TJR ) ( 20-40 % ) . The strong predictor dissatisfaction TKA find preoperative expectation meet postoperatively ( 10.7x great risk ) . To date , criterion standard assess outcome neither expectation satisfaction patient undergoing TJR . Patient 's expectation particular significance link request elective often costly treatment . Several study investigate fulfillment patient ' expectation , however focus primarily assess expectation regard pain , may also influence several factor . Patient 's expectation also strongly related patient 's assessment outcome . It well establish correlation satisfaction surgery objective improvement pain , function general health-related quality life , patient ' expectation postoperative satisfaction may also incorporate multiple varies factor affect overall outcome . One factor `` ability forget artificial joint '' everyday life therefore regard ultimate possible goal patient satisfaction . Additionally , many patient undergo TJR experience continue disability , largely caused persistent pain postoperatively . Studies show high level pain catastrophizing predictor high level acute persistent pain various surgery , investigation pain catastrophizing predictor outcome TJR warrant . Many patient experience dissatisfaction disability TJR undergo revision present burden community health clinicians health service continue remedy dissatisfaction . The rehabilitation initial surgery proven produce short-term benefit , benefit seem persist . As many patient ' experience limit clinical improvement postoperatively national consensus rehabilitation group , optimal rehabilitation protocol group patient still warrant . Several association patient characteristic chance achieve clinically importance improvement TJR surgery identify age , gender , body mass index , ethnicity , psychological distress , co-morbidity-profile radiographic osteoarthritis severity . It speculate fast-track surgery aid early recovery , number fall within population patient undergoing total low limb arthroplasty increase result increase , early activity . JÃ¸rgensen &amp; Kehlet find overall incidence fall postoperatively hip knee replacement low , inclusion fall history may important optimize rehabilitation protocol reduce future risk fall group patient . Patients undergo low TJR wish return pre-pathological physical status , found limited interest actually undertake great effort physical therapy fully achieve either pleasure health gain . Individual beliefs perception present big factor influence physical activity postoperatively therefore important examine develop management plan aim optimize rehabilitation group patient . There dearth literature examine impact actual response rate rehabilitation TJR surgery take fall history , patient expectation , subjective well objective measurement account . It therefore important clarify relationship characteristic responsiveness postoperative rehabilitation . The available data suggest identify address mechanism reduce activity identification group patient may may benefit rehabilitation programme may approach need . This data use allocate already sparse resource beneficially , optimise criteria rehabilitation intervention . An expert consensus best practice already identify need preoperative screening identify patient need rehabilitation patient undergoing total hip arthroplasty . Aim : This project descriptive , hypothesis-generating study . The aim identify risk factor poor response rehabilitation program TJR use identify patient susceptible poor outcome order optimise appropriate rehabilitation strategy rationalise distribution health care resource . Material method : This project prospective cohort design patient schedule undergo total joint replacement ( total knee arthroplasty total hip arthroplasty ) Bornholms regional hospital invite participate . Due minimal effort time require filling questionnaire perform 30sec chair stand test minimal number patient expect decline participation . Based clinical experience annual number patient undergo low extremity TJR Bornholm 's regional hospital expect around 160 patient . During study enrolment basic , demographic data ( e.g . age , gender , co-morbidities , BMI ) collect participant . Preoperative assessment ( prior surgery ) postoperative assessment ( follow 3 month surgery ) include : Preoperative assessment : - Use joint specific analgesic medication - Fall history - Patient expectation questionnaire - Pain catastrophizing questionnaire - KOOS / HOOS questionnaire - 30 second chair stand test Postoperative assessment : - Use joint specific analgesic medication - Fall history - KOOS / HOOS questionnaire - Pain catastrophizing questionnaire - 30 second chair stand test - The Forgotten Joint Score - Patient satisfaction questionnaire Approvals : This cohort study obtain approval Danish Datatilsynet ( J.nr . 2016-41-4783 ) . This study change pre postoperative treatment include patient , therefore formal approval require . Postoperative rehabilitation : All patient give rehabilitation plan hospital engage 4-12 week rehabilitation program one two rehabilitation centre locate Bornholm . The rehabilitation start individual consultation experience physiotherapist within 3 week surgery appropriate home-exercises revise instruct , shortly consultation patient enrol out-patient , group-based physical therapy program , twice weekly session 4-12 week , length program depend patient objective response physical therapy . The patient encourage continue home-based exercise parallel physical therapy session culmination physical therapy program . At end supervise physical therapy program , involved physiotherapist subjectively assess patient 's compliance regard exercise adherence rehabilitation patient undertaken . Evaluation surgery rehabilitation intervention perform hospital 3 month surgery assign orthopaedic surgeon , postoperatively outcome measurement record . Statistical analysis : The statistical analysis compare preoperative postoperative score term use analgesic , fall history , patient expectation / satisfaction , KOOS / HOOS , pain catastrophizing , forget joint score 30sec chair stand test . Significance set &lt; 0.05 . A Chi-square test use investigate whether distribution categorical variable differ one another . Multivariable linear regression perform examine association patient characteristic response rate TKA THA individually TKA/THA combine .</detailed_description>
