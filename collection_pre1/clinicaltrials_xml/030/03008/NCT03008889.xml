	<brief_summary>The purpose study demonstrate feasibility 9-week , randomize trial N-acetylcysteine ( NAC ) compare placebo 14 child ( age 5 12 year ) Autism Spectrum Disorder ( ASD ) moderate level repetitive self-injurious behavior ( SIB ) . Additional aim evaluate positive predictive value screen method classify child automatically maintain self-injurious behavior ; evaluate preliminary efficacy NAC reduce repetitive SIB child ASD ; evaluate biomarkers possible mechanisms action NAC child ASD .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Feasibility Study N-acetylcysteine Self-injurious Behavior Children With Autism Spectrum Disorder</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Self-injurious behavior ( SIB ) child autism spectrum disorder ( ASD ) cause physical harm child interfere child 's ability make use educational program helpful treatment speech therapy . The turmoil cause self-injurious behavior child ASD invariably interfere daily routine family life often stop episode family member worry set SIB episode . This project use detailed assessment method develop field behavior therapy evaluate potential N-acetylcysteine ( NAC ) treat child ASD moderate repetitive SIB . NAC over-the-counter dietary supplement may beneficial effect brain well-documented antioxidant effect and/or reduce glutamate signal . In proposed study , 14 child ASD repetitive SIB age 5 12 randomly assign gradually increase dos NAC placebo 9 week . The research team , parent child blind treatment NAC placebo . Participants come research site periodically complete measure behavioral assessment . After 9 week treatment , child randomize NAC show improvement encourage continue take supplement outside study . Children randomly assign placebo show improvement offer open-label treatment NAC . Children improve take NAC improve placebo advise next step study team . The goal feasibility study establish acceptability viability study procedure vulnerable population , learn potential benefit adverse effect NAC . Demonstrating feasibility aim preliminary efficacy safety NAC prerequisite planning large , definitive , study .</detailed_description>
