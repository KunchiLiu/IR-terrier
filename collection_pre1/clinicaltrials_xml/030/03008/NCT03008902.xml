	<brief_title>A Study Effects Age Hyperkyphosis Spine Motion Loading</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The purpose study obtain unique measure thoracic spinal motion young , old , hyperkyphotic old adult . We develop unique subject-specific musculoskeletal model individual estimate load apply vertebrae vivo , examine spinal motion load vary age increase kyphosis . Vertebral fracture ( VFs ) common type fracture old adult , occur 20-35 % woman 15-25 % men age 50 , associate significant morbidity , increased mortality , annual cost exceed $ 1 billion United States . However , limited understanding mechanism ( beyond low vertebral bone mineral density strength ) lead VFs hinders ability predict prevent injury . Similarly , hyperkyphosis , define excess forward curvature thoracic spine , suffer 20-40 % old adult , cause poorly understood standard clinical treatment . Hyperkyphosis VFs inter-related , individual VFs often bad kyphosis , hyperkyphosis independent risk factor future VFs . Hyperkyphosis may increase VF risk increase vertebral loading , good understand need biomechanics common spine condition . VFs occur often mid-thoracic ( T7-T8 ) thoraco-lumbar ( T12-L1 ) vertebra elsewhere spine , suggest biomechanical factor predispose area fracture increase vertebral loading . In first phase project , novel musculoskeletal model develop uniquely predict peaks vertebral load around T12-L1 region spine , observe mid-thoracic region . Our preliminary data suggest increased thoracic stiffness cause great vertebral load mid-thoracic level ( T7-T9 ) , increase thoracic kyphosis increase vertebral loading , particularly thoraco-lumbar ( T12-L1 ) region . Further advance musculoskeletal model need fully evaluate possibility , particular knowledge gap remain regard vivo kinematics thoracic spine ribcage healthy hyperkyphotic individual . This project aim fill gap produce novel vivo measurement thoracic spine motion young , old , hyperkyphotic old adult .</detailed_description>
