	<brief_summary>This multi-center , phase II/III , open-label , randomize , parallel standard chemoradiation-controlled study eligible subject randomize 1:1 ratio receive control treatment study treatment . The primary objective trial evaluate effect add-on JP001 standard chemoradiation increase overall survival ( OS ) newly diagnose glioblastoma ( GBM ) patient .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Phase II/III Trial CCRT With Without JP001 Newly Diagnosed GBM</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>After enrollment , subject ' previous tumor block use glioblastoma diagnosis consent provide study period send central laboratory assessment MGMT status . Moreover , subject randomize either Control Study arm Visit 2 . Subjects Control arm receive standard chemoradiation . However , subject Study arm receive standard chemoradiation combination concurrent JP001 whole study period . During study , sufficient amount investigational product supply subject study group next schedule visit . Subjects self-administer investigational product orally water approximately time day . Subjects fast minimum 2 hour prior dos JP001 and/or Temozolomide fast another 1 hour take JP001 and/or Temozolomide . During end treatment , subject evaluate efficacy safety parameter . Moreover , Follow-up visit safety 4 week End-of-Treatment visit . If subject early withdrawn study , End-of-Treatment visit arrange assessment assign visit perform . The Safety Follow-up visit early withdrawn subject could either clinic visit telephone contact . If withdrawn subject refuse perform Follow-up visit , Follow-up visit allow cancel . For subject complete discontinued study treatment , assessment survival status perform every 8 week telephone contact death , study end ( last subject last visit ; last subject need follow least 30 month ) , study termination Sponsor . Survival information record medical source CRF . If subject lose follow-up refuse receive assessment survival status , investigator record last date subject know alive medical source case report form .</detailed_description>
