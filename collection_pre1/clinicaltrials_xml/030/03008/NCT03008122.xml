	<detailed_description>This study single-center , randomize , double-blinded , placebo-controlled , Phase 1 , dose de-escalation study evaluate safety , reactogenicity , immunogenicity purify inactivated , alum-adjuvanted ZIKV vaccine ( ZPIV ) administer homologous prime-boost regimen healthy male non-pregnant female adult subject live flavivirus-endemic area . This study enroll 90 healthy male non-pregnant female subject age 21 49 conduct Ponce Medical School Foundation , Inc.-CAIMED Ponce , Puerto Rico . The entire duration subject 's participation approximately 26 month include recruitment collection data safety reactogenicity study vaccine collection sample assessment immunogenicity . This study expect take approximately 42 month complete . Two dose level evaluate . Each subject receive either placebo 5 mcg ( Group 1 ) 2.5 mcg ( Group 2 ) ZPIV administer intramuscular ( IM ) injection Days 1 29 . The study consist screen period 28 day , vaccination period subject receive prime dose vaccine Day 1 follow homologous boost Day 29 , follow-up period 24 month post boost vaccination . The study begin enrollment 2 sentinel subject Group 1 receive 5 mcg ZPIV open label . One sentinel subject vaccinate , follow one day safety reactogenicity , halt rule meet per determination PI co-PI , second sentinel subject receive 5 mcg ZPIV open-label . Both sentinel follow safety Day 8 predefined halting rule meet safety concern identify , enrollment remain 43 Group 1 subject proceed double-blind fashion . The procedure use administration boost vaccination Group 1 sentinel : 1 sentinel ( either ) receive 5 mcg ZPIV open-label , follow one day safety reactogenicity , halt rule meet , 2nd sentinel receive boost vaccine . Both sentinel follow Day 8 2nd vaccination safety reactogenicity halt rule meet , boost vaccination remain 43 Group 1 subject proceed . Enrollment 2.5 mcg ZPIV group ( Group 2 ) begin subject Group 1 receive 1st dose vaccine follow Day 8 safety reactogenicity , provide halting rule meet safety concern identify . As dose de-escalation study , sentinel subject use Group 2 . All 45 subject Group 2 receive study product placebo double-blind fashion . In total , 40 subject receive 5 mcg ZPIV , 40 receive 2.5 mcg ZPIV , 10 receive placebo ( saline ) . All subject receive homologous boost ZPIV placebo 28 day post-prime halting rule preclude second vaccination meet . Solicited local systemic reactogenicity data collect subject Day 8 vaccination . Unsolicited adverse event collected subject Day 57 ( 28 day 2nd vaccination ) . SAEs , AESIs , history new medical condition onset first vaccination collect duration study . Blood evaluation antibody ZIKV ELISA neutralize antibody assay collect Visit 00 , prior vaccination , multiple timepoints afterward . Primary objective : 1 ) Assess safety reactogenicity homologous prime boost regimen ZPIV give two different dose level dose de-escalation format healthy adult subject live Puerto Rico , flavivirus endemic area . 2 ) Compare safety reactogenicity profile ZPIV vaccination , dosage group , pre-vaccination flavivirus immune status . Secondary Objectives : 1 ) Assess humoral immune response homologous prime-boost regimen ZPIV dose vaccine determine kinetics immune response , seroconversion rate , Geometric Mean Titers ( GMT ) overall , compare result dosage group pre-vaccination flavivirus immune status . 2 ) Assess durability humoral immune response ZPIV 6 , 12 , 18 , 24 month second vaccine administration overall , compare result dosage group pre-vaccination flavivirus immune status .</detailed_description>
