Length Treatment : You may continue take study drug long doctor think best interest . You longer able take study drug disease get bad , intolerable side effect occur , unable follow study direction . Your participation study follow-up . Study Visits : On Day 1 Each Cycle : - You physical exam . - Blood ( 2 tablespoon ) urine collect routine test . - If doctor think need , blood ( 1 teaspoon ) drawn check hepatitis . If hepatitis screen test screening , repeat . - On Day 1 Cycles 2 beyond , EKG . - On Day 1 Cycle 3 every 3 cycle ( Cycles 6 , 9 , 12 , ) , part routine blood draw use check level fat blood . On Day 15 Cycle 1 : - You physical exam . - Blood ( 3 ½ tablespoon ) draw routine pharmacodynamic PD testing . - You three EKGs 5 minute apart dose 2-4 hour . On Day 15 Cycle 2 , EKG 2-4 hour dose . At end Cycles 2 , 4 , 6 every 3 cycle ( Cycles 9 , 12 , 15 , ) ( +/- 7 day ) : - You MRI and/or CT scan . If sign disease chest chest disease , CT scan chest . - If disease could felt pelvis begin study , pelvic exam . End-of-Treatment Visit : Within 4 week last dose study drug : - You physical exam . Blood ( 2 tablespoon ) urine collect routine test . - You MRI and/or CT scan . If sign disease chest , CT scan chest . Follow-Up : At 30 day last dose study drug every 3 month ( +/- 1 month ) , member study staff contact phone regularly schedule clinic visit ask side effect may . These call visit last 5-10 minute time . This investigational study . Everolimus FDA approve commercially available treat kidney , breast , pancreatic cancer . Letrozole FDA approve commercially available treat breast cancer ovarian cancer . Ribociclib FDA approve commercially available . It currently use research purpose . The combination everolimus , letrozole , ribociclib treat endometrial cancer investigational . Up 76 patient enrol study . All take part MD Anderson .</detailed_description>
