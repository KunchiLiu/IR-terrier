	<brief_summary>Patients tracheostomy mechanical ventilation initially lose ability speak , use one-way speaking valve ( OWSV ) one method restore speech patient . Patients tracheostomy experience loss speech report frustration feeling confinement communication impairment , therefore investigator would like restore speech patient soon safe . However , currently little known literature timing use OWSV patient tracheostomy . Therefore , investigator propose pre-test post-test clinical trial pilot study investigate safety early use OWSV patient undergo percutaneous tracheostomy . Study aim identify patient would benefit early use OWSV determine effect early use OWSV speech clinical outcome . To achieve aim , patient undergo percutaneous tracheostomy screen , patient meet screen criterion randomize intervention control group . The intervention group receive early speech-language pathology ( SLP ) evaluation OWSV trial 12-24 hour follow tracheostomy procedure , control group receive standard SLP evaluation OWSV trial 48-60 hour follow tracheostomy procedure . Intervention control group compare speech clinical outcome measure pre-test 12-24 hour follow tracheostomy post-test 48-60 hour follow tracheostomy characteristic patient successfully tolerate early OWSV use identify .</brief_summary>
