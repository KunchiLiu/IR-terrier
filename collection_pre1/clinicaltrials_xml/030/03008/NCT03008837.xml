	<brief_summary>Given recent increase opioid-related death evidence show use opioids non-malignant chronic pain , grow need non-narcotic pain management . Fibromyalgia difficult treat chronic pain condition often treat opioids despite exist evidence . The prevalence fibromyalgia increase among Veterans return gulf war already significant burden senior Veterans may suffer chronic pain decade already . Many treatment option fibromyalgia carry intolerable side effect . PENFS ( percutaneous electrical neural field stimulation ) FDA-approved , non-pharmacologic therapy currently utilize within military VA system , sufficient evidence regard outcome neural mechanism adequately investigate . An understanding neural underpinnings analgesic effect could lead 1 ) improvement pain management quality life , 2 ) cost-savings 3 ) development new technique address pain .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Feasibility Study : fMRI Evaluation Auricular PENFS Fibromyalgia</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>BACKGROUND : Fibromyalgia chronic pain syndrome consist chronic widespread pain , decrease physical function , fatigue , psychoemotional/sleep disturbance , various somatic complaint , affect anywhere 5-10 million Americans , ~1,500 Veterans carry diagnosis fibromyalgia see per year Atlanta VAMC alone . It estimate fibromyalgia cost American population $ 20 billion/year lose wage disability . Initial therapy often include complementary alternative medicine ( CAM ) therapy , generally consider safe , although efficacy thoroughly evaluate fibromyalgia . Thus , non-pharmacologic alternative require rigorous scientific investigation treatment fibromyalgia . There evidence support use percutaneous electrical neural stimulation ( PENS ) treatment pain condition , may increase effect relative acupuncture base systematic review . While fMRI data acupuncture fibromyalgia exists , data exists PENS treatment . An evolved form PENS , percutaneous electrical neural field stimulation ( PENFS ) auricle already use military VA system treatment chronic pain , evidence regard mechanism effect lack . Stimulation vagus nerve , auricular branch , previously study pain relief fibromyalgia . However , application PENS-type stimulation auricle previously study fMRI , type therapy may lead neural change worthy exploration . OBJECTIVE : To evaluate feasibility use fMRI biomarker neural substrate pain functional change follow PENFS treatment . HYPOTHESIS : PENFS result decrease functional connectivity insula default mode network evaluate fMRI , correlate significant improvement pain function relative standard therapy fibromyalgia . METHODS : Subjects meet study criterion receive baseline assessment include rest state fMRI , collection biobehavioural information cognitive psychological assessment standardize form , eat , sleep drinking habit , Defense Veterans Pain Rating Scale ( DVPRS ) , PROMIS measure , arm curl , 30-s chair stand , handgrip strength test , [ measure realms `` Activity Participation '' International Classification Functioning , Disability , Health , ] baseline analgesic consumption . Subjects stratify base age gender divide standard therapy control ( medication management physical therapy ) PENFS ( series 4 , weekly ) treatment assess fMRI change 2 week final treatment . Pain function also assess 2 week , 6 week 12 week follow final treatment . CLINICAL RELEVANCE : [ Auricular PENFS study fMRI . Stimulation auricle may produce neural change differ traditional therapy . Understanding underlying neural mechanism auricular PENFS could assist develop targeted treatment fibromyalgia chronic pain . ] Further , PENFS significantly improve pain relief function standard therapy , could decrease need opioid analgesic associated risk , primary objective VA Opioid Safety Initiative . The present investigation serve elucidate neural change PENFS , could directly applicable Veterans suffer fibromyalgia provide evidence regard relative effectiveness already clinically-employed non-pharmacologic treatment ( lack thereof ) , result evidence-based implementation potential cost saving VA system .</detailed_description>
