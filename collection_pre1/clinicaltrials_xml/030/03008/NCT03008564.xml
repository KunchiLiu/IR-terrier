	<brief_summary>There dispute location adductor canal block perform ( 3-6 ) . Two Common approach use ultrasound guide adductor canal block 'point entry ' : 1 . Point A : midway point ASIS base patella 2 . Point B : Point 2-3 cm proximal site femoral artery become popliteal artery traverse away sartorius muscle towards femur adductor hiatus ( 2 ) We want determine ultrasound anatomy healthy volunteer : 1 . Measuring distance Point A Point B 2 . Studying ultrasound anatomy Point A B - Determine location respect adductor canal femoral triangle . This allow u determine best site perform adductor canal block</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Adductor Canal Block Ultrasound Anatomy Volunteers</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>It important answer primary question variable length adductor canal would like determine optimal position perform adductor canal block . The adductor canal typically contain saphenous nerve , nerve vastus medialis muscle occasion , obturator nerve ( 1 ) . The roof adductor canal vasto-adductor membrane length report range 5.5 cm 15 cm mean 7.6 cm2 would suggest length AC variable . We would like determine length AC use ultrasound . The AC would determine begin apex femoral triangle end proximal adductor hiatus . The length location AC would important characterize volume local anesthetic use associate quadriceps weakness could significance short AC . There dispute location adductor canal block perform ( 3-6 ) . Point A dispute within femoral triangle would therefore femoral nerve block suggest small body evidence ( 4-5 ) . Clinically , unclear difference quadriceps muscle weakness two approach although could hypothesize place block point A would lead quadriceps muscle weakness . With information gather study , plan perform clinical study perform nerve block two point different volume local anesthetic compare amount analgesia motor weakness two different approach . 60 Volunteers ( 30 male 30 female ) age 18 75 year body mass index 18 35 kg/m2 include study . Volunteers previous surgery deformity low extremity exclude study This observational study without control group . Several reference point mark anatomical landmark and/or ultrasound : A. anterior superior iliac spine ( landmark ) ; B. base patella ( landmark ) ; C. apex femoral triangle ( ultrasound ) ; D. distal portion adductor canal ( Point B describe earlier ; ultrasound ) . The primary outcome measure look distance Point A Point B . We also plan measure distance ( centimeter ) : 1 . Base patella Point A 2 . Base patella Point B 3 . Apex femoral triangle</detailed_description>
