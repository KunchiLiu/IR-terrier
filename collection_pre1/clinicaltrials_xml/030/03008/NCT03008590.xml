	<detailed_description>Chronic pain affect 100 million Americans , arthritis common cause . Existing treatment chronic arthritic pain mildly effective , risks medication use treat pain numerous continue discover . Treatment chronic high priority research area VA CSR &amp; D . Naltrexone opioid antagonist FDA approve oral daily dose 50 mg prevent recidivism alcoholic . At much low dose 4 - 4.5 mg daily , however , show small , blind , randomize trial improve pain fibromyalgia , gastrointestinal symptom Crohn 's disease , quality life multiple sclerosis . The publish data case report complex regional pain syndrome , low back pain , scleroderma . However , advocacy low-dose naltrexone ( LDN ) internet-based MDs patient high , since LDN prescribe off-label , use greatly exceeds justify evidence . The drug prescribe via compound pharmacy , use cost patient ~ $ 40/month . Among many unproven treatment widely use , LDN particular interest result surveys patient particularly impressive , quite safe , benefit plausible pharmacologically . There evidence modulation central pain-processing pathway down-regulation inflammatory pathway microglia . Considering diversity condition propose benefit LDN unequivocal need good approach pain relief chronic condition , high-quality clinical trial need inflammatory non-inflammatory condition . This small placebo-controlled study , power detect effect size small see NSAIDs beneficial non-pharmacologic approach , propose prerequisite consider pivotal trial VA Cooperative Studies Program . The propose study randomize , double-blinded , cross-over , placebo-controlled trial adult osteoarthritis inflammatory arthritis persistent pain . Sixty patient enrol 16 week , receive LDN 8 week placebo 8 week . Widely accept patient-reported outcome measure use . The co-primary endpoint reduction pain severity pain 's interference function 8 week LDN compare 8 week placebo , use Brief Pain Inventory . Other patient-reported data use secondary outcome covariates analyze determinant response treatment .</detailed_description>
