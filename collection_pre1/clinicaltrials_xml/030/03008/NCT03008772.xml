	<brief_summary>To define long-term incidence frequency ISR follow DES implantation . Compare clinical presentation , treatment intervention success among de novo coronary artery stenosis DES ISR . Compare short- long-term outcome de novo coronary artery stenosis DES ISR , assess incidence mortality , MACE , MI , TLR/TVR index hospitalization , 30 day , 6 month , 1 year , 3 year , 5 year , available .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Drug-eluting coronary stent ( DES ) significantly reduce rate neointimal hyperplasia in-stent restenosis ( ISR ) compare bare metal stent ( BMS ) treatment coronary artery disease . In addition , continue evolution scaffold polymer design concomitant improvement antiplatelet therapy improve rate late late stent thrombosis . However , despite novel metal scaffold technology , increase operator experience , improvement adjunctive implantation technique , incidence ISR durable-polymer DES remain problem , 1-year rate high 12 15 % . The outcome associate ISR highlight fact mean benign process study report MI rate high 19.4 % one study demonstrate total rate death nonfatal MI 3.5 % . In addition , ISR present acute coronary syndrome ( ACS ) independent effect major adverse cardiac event . The emergence fully bioresorbable vascular scaffold ( BVS ) provide excite alternative combat long-term structural functional effect coronary vessel see implantation permanent metal scaffold , regardless drug coating . Initial study demonstrate non-inferiority BVS compare contemporary DES regard death , MI , MACE . In addition , intravascular imaging confirm complete resorbtion BVS 3 year time . The long-term benefit technology yet fully assess . However , base literature outline complicate course ISR short-term see bare metal stent era , project complete resorbtion vascular scaffold improve long-term outcome patient ischemic heart disease . Currently , clinical presentation , incidence , outcomes ISR contemporary DES completely understand . The goal particular study retrospectively evaluate long-term impact ISR 10-year period current contemporary DES . The data compare de novo coronary artery lesion similar characteristic complexity highlight significant difference clinical course disease . Ultimately , investigator hopefully demonstrate need improvement arena , BVS potentially provide .</detailed_description>
