	<brief_summary>This study evaluate performance safety fluorescence base fibre optic glucose sensor home usage.24 subject take part study , include 4 pre-diabetic subject , 8 Type I diabetic patient , 8 Type II diabetic patient 4 diabetic patient require continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis ( CAPD ) . Type 1 , Type 2 prediabetic subject wear one FiberSense sensor , randomly allocate either upper arm ( 50 % ) abdomen ( 50 % ) 28 day . In addition , subject wear Dexcom sensor side abdomen 7 day one four study week . In 4 CAPD subject , one FiberSense sensor place upper arm 28 day . No additional comparator sensor place CAPD subject .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Effectiveness Safety Study Percutaneous Optical Fibre Glucose Sensor ( FiberSense )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The FiberSense system glucose-monitoring device indicate continually record interstitial fluid glucose level patient age 18 old insulin dependent diabetes mellitus purpose improve diabetes management . The System intend use patient home health care facility . The FiberSense system indicate use adjunctive device complement , replace , information obtain standard home glucose monitoring device . The FiberSense system aid detection episode hyperglycemia hypoglycemia , facilitate acute long-term therapy adjustment , may minimize excursion .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Type I II diabetes mellitus require insulin management glucose control least one year prior enrollment diabetes continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis prediabetic individual impair fast glucose impair glucose tolerance OGTT Male female age ≥ 18 year old ≤ 70 year old . Women pregnant , lactate plan pregnancy participation clinical study . Willingness , ability commitment comply test , procedure followup outline protocol include ( limited ) frequency clinic visit use prespecified glucose monitoring device . Willingness abstain swim participation measurement phase . In opinion investigator , absence physical limitation , addictive disease , underlie medical condition ( include mental health ) may preclude patient good study candidate . Written inform consent participate study provide patient . Poorly control diabetes mellitus HbA1C &gt; 11 % . Currently pregnant , demonstrate positive pregnancy test screen Day00 . Impaired hepatic function measure alanine aminotransferase ( ALT ) aspartate aminotransferase ( AST ) ≥ three time upper reference limit . Any active acute chronic disease condition , opinion investigator , might interfere performance study . Any active acute chronic infectious disease , opinion investigator , would pose excessive risk study staff . Current use recent exposure medication opinion investigator could influence patient 's ability participate study performance test device . Extensive skin changes/diseases preclude wear require number device normal skin propose application site ( e.g. , extensive psoriasis , recent burn severe sunburn , extensive eczema , extensive scarring , extensive tattoo , dermatitis herpetiformis ) . Have know allergy medicalgrade adhesive , know hypersensitivity product use study . Known current recent alcohol drug abuse Blood donation 500 ml within last three month Currently participate another investigational study protocol test result may interfere study compliance , diagnostic result , data collection . Has MRI scan , CT scan , diathermy schedule propose study participation . An identified protected vulnerable patient ( include limit detention , prisoner ) . Women reproductive potential unwilling adopt contraceptive measure study period</criteria>
