	<brief_title>PSMA PET/CT Prostate Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Positron emission tomography / computer tomography ( PET/CT ) nuclear medicine diagnostic imaging procedure base measurement positron emission radiolabeled tracer molecule vivo . A radiotracer use today 68Ga-HBED-CC-PSMA ( DKFZ-11 ) - hereinafter abbreviate 68Ga-PSMA - radiolabeled urea-based ligand prostate specific membrane antigen ( PSMA ) PET/CT . Imaging 68Ga-PSMA PET use characterize localize prostate cancer human vivo . There extensive data literature show value 68Ga-PSMA PET/CT image accurately stag restaging prostate cancer . The objective study replicate safety efficacy 68Ga-PSMA PET/CT establish ability reproduce result literature use 68Ga-PSMA PET/CT diagnostic decision make tool management prostate cancer patient . During study eligible prostate cancer patient undergo one 68Ga-PSMA PET/CT . The primary endpoint study incidence adverse event ( AE ) study population 7 day follow scan , sensitivity specificity 68Ga-PSMA PET/CT v CT per-patient per-lesion basis .</detailed_description>
