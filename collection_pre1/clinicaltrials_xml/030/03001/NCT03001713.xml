	<brief_summary>This project aim reduce disparity cardiovascular disease ( CVD ) risk factor control rate heart attack stroke among low-income , racially / ethnically diverse Americans receive primary care safety net community health center ( CHCs ) . To achieve important objective , investigator adapt successful clinical decision support ( CDS ) system currently use CVD care several large , integrated health care system , meet patient need workflow process 60 CHCs . The investigator determine use CDS improve CVD care , reduce disparity CVD care outcome , increase patient engagement CVD treatment choice , CHCs . Results randomize trial help accelerate translation major investment health informatics system substantial clinical benefit large number high-risk , low-income patient . Results also provide template CVD care improvement spread CHCs extend clinical condition .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>CV Wizard : Does Clinical Decision Support Tool Improve CVD Risk Factor Control Safety Net Clinics ?</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The investigator seek learn whether clinical decision support ( CDS ) system well-resourced care setting effective safety net community health center ( CHCs ) , enhance cross-setting implementation . Thus , investigator propose clinic-randomized , pragmatic trial uptake impact 'CV Wizard ' CDS tool 60 CHCs share link electronic health record . CV Wizard summarize patient 's reversible CVD risk , generates prioritize , guideline-based care recommendation base risk , show 'provider view ' 'patient view , ' enable patient engagement . Use rate satisfaction CDS high large healthcare delivery system develop test . The investigator : study impact CHC setting , assess uptake CDS system , ass strategy integrate CHC workflow , impact patient ' CVD risk risk factor management . The investigator hypothesize cutting-edge CDS improve rate guideline-based CVD preventive care CHC patient , experience disparity CVD risk factor , care outcome . The 60 study clinic member OCHIN , Inc. , non-profit health center-controlled network national leader health information technology CHCs . OCHIN 's leadership enthusiastically support propose work help ensure recruitment goal meet . The investigator partner stakeholder / medical leadership OCHIN 's member clinic every step , via exist structure . This study address gap guideline-based CVD care high-risk population , use target , multi-level strategy ; considers setting-specific need ; test CDS affect guideline implementation community clinic ; use technology support patient engagement . Results yield knowledge provide CHCs cutting-edge CDS , associate impact CVD disparity . The innovative study second trial implement CDS tool private care setting CHCs , first complex CDS tool address range CVD risk management guideline , make prioritize care recommendation , facilitate point-of-care patient engagement . Results could lead substantial improvement CVD prevention , care , outcomes CHCs nationwide . Our overarch aim : Aim 1 . Conduct clinic-randomized trial impact evidence-based point-of-care CDS system ( ) overall CVD risk score , ( ii ) control individual CVD risk ( blood pressure ; HbA1c , lipid level ; aspirin use ; smoking ; body mass index ) , among high CVD risk CHC adult patient . H1 : High CVD risk patient Arm 1 CHCs significantly low overall CVD risk score 12-month post-index visit period , compare Arm 2 CHCs . H2 : High CVD risk patient Arm 1 CHCs poor control specific CVD risk factor index visit significantly good control factor 12 month post-index visit period , compare Arm 2 CHCs . H3 : Disparities specific CVD risk factor control CHC patient ' versus national CVD risk factor control rate significantly reduce 18 month post-implementation Arm ( secondary analysis ) . Aim 2 . Develop hone need-based implementation support protocol help Arm 1 CHCs implement CV Wizard CDS system standard workflows ; ass whether use protocol develop Arm 1 CHCs accelerates implementation adoption CDS system Arm 2 CHCs . H4 : CDS uptake CHC workflows significantly faster Arm 2 CHCs Arm 1 CHCs . Aim 3 . Conduct mixed method process evaluation , guide Technology Acceptance Model , identify address patient , provider , delivery system barrier uptake / impact CDS CHCs .</detailed_description>
