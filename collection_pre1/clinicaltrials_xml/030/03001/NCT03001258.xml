	<brief_summary>Demand near vision correction community exist Bangladesh thin presence eye- care . This study aim test skill BRAC service-providers identify presbyopia-cases , ensure frequent service , meet community need . This non-inferiority equivalence randomize intervention trial , do February-June 2015 , six randomly select sub-districts , 2059 camp-patients screen . BRAC Health-cadres ; program organizer ( PO ) , upgrade shasthya- shebikas ( USS ) shasthya- shebikas ( SS ) , assign three different arm consist two sub-districts permuted-block randomization.105 eye-camps organize minimum 500 sample per arm . Sensitivity specificity calculate understand screening performance . Screening report match gold standard recruiting refractionists .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Study context : In align significant unmet need presbyopia prevalent eye care scenario Bangladesh , BRAC- multinational non-government organization ( NGO ) , implement project title 'Reading glass improve livelihood ( RGIL ) ' provide eye care service people suffer eye problem special emphasis give near vision loss presbyopia since 2006 . The objective project provide access vision screen affordable eyeglass people combat diminish quality life due blurry up-close vision extend referral people eye problem . BRAC 's Health Nutrition Population Program ( HNPP ) Division implement project partnership Vision Spring , USA . It issue whether program could use exist Community Health Workers ( CHW ) , ( BRAC designate shasthya shebikas , refer SS ) instead assign program organizer ( BRAC designate , refer PO ) job , conduct screen take leading role selling glass . In BRAC health program usually SSs expect work six day week , spend two hour day household visit , cover around 250 Households ( HHs ) month , promote behaviour change communication various health component . SSs non-salaried staff lower educational level , usually eight year school . During initial stage job , receive 16 day basic train basic preventive , promotive curative health care , back regular monthly refresher train . POs usually master level degree regular salaried staff BRAC field level worker . When hired BRAC , receive six day basic health management training able work health worker community . This change role shifting , adopt mean program easily ensure wide coverage within short period CHWs number well great access community . Moreover presbyopia easily effectively correct reading glass certify ophthalmologist necessarily require visual correction ; lay person low literacy appropriate training prescribe reading glass . It well-understood organize camp limitation regard coverage whole population regular basis . Moreover , order sustain read glass program along camp , system warrant trained workforce could screen suggest eye glass routine community visit . It therefore , experimental study assess performance different level workforce screen presbyopia case , necessary bring change service delivery model scale throughout Bangladesh . Eye camp organize study sub-district aim eliminate vision problem face presbyopic patient . Potential patient encourage join camp information significance camp day , time place camp , procedure patient ' registration , brief diagnostic technique , benefit estimate refractive error offer prescribe glass presbyopia case largely disseminate throughout whole community . Refraction undertaken use E chart respective camp provider . Glasses available buy patient require spectacle cost around 2 USD spot provider instruct counsel glass use . These glass import USA Vision Spring , USA . During time intervention , USS employ 20 sub district RGIL implement BRAC HNPP . To ensure USS recruitment study randomly select 6 sub-districts 20 . Two sub district randomly assign one three arm permuted-block randomization . Community people age 35 , male female difficulty near vision invite screening . Individuals diagnose eye disease require regular treatment willing participate study exclude ( figure 1 ) . Sample size : The sample size three-arm study estimate use non-inferiority design . It assume true detection rate reference arm ( refractionist ) 80 % experimental arm would identical . We estimate enrolment 288 participant three arm 2.5 % one-sided significance level would yield 85 % power demonstrate similarity margin -10 % , detection rate identical . Assuming design effect 1.5 cluster design , aim enrol 435 participant arm . For compare accuracy rate arm , require sample size 470 per arm detect 10 % difference 80 % power , 5 % significance level 1.5 design effect . We recruit minimum 500 per arm . Data collection tool technique : Both quantitative qualitative data collect 2 week simultaneously face-to-face respondent camp hour . For quantitative data , two separate closed-ended structured questionnaire develop . Information regard patient 's demographic socio-economic status collect . From service provider , information age , year work BRAC , duration involvement BRAC 's RGIL project also collect . Their level knowledge assess score several issue instance , common foreign body infection relate eye problem , immediate measure , vision ( either near distance ) relate eye issue , presbyopia , 's aetiology certain eye condition would require refer registered eye specialist . Furthermore , refractionists present camp run three provider respective arm . All patient screen three arm re-examined refractionist confirm diagnosis presbyopia record defined format . We keep blinded refractionists screen outcome i.e . refractionists aware screen report make service provider prior examine patient . Background data collect presbyopia positive participant identify BRAC worker . Data collection perform skilled interviewer ( consist science graduate field experience ) . A five-day intensive training organize consist lecture , mock interview , role play field practice eye camp . Before actual survey , team deploy camps participant inform purpose study inform verbal consent , interviewer take information camp day . For qualitative observation , recruit two anthropologist research assistant ( RA ) complete undergraduate master anthropology . present entire camp hour run three different service provider three study upazillas observe activity ( patient counsel prescribe eye glass well market aspect ) . A total eight camp observe provider arm three upazillas two RA . There one RA per camp assign observe two case note step screen process presbyopia BRAC provider key feature camp per camp protocol example , counsel marketing . The qualitative data collect use semi structure observation checklist develop follow presbyopia screen protocol pretested prior data collection . Observers give four day train include one day practical observation exercise eye screen camp relevant theme observe . A total 24 case observe . We blind service provider direct observation research assistants possible quantitative data collector present camp . Blinding do understand unbiased performance intervention group . Content analysis adopt analyse data accord predefined theme .</detailed_description>
