	<detailed_description>Aortic dissection ( AD ) aneurysm common catastrophic aortic disease clinical setting . In U.S. , prevalence approximate 2.9-3.5 cases/100000 person per year , recent evidence show increase incidence 14 case per 100000 patient per year . AD aneurysm classify type Stanford A B base whether ascend aorta involve . For acute type B aortic dissection ( ABAD ) , generally account one third aortic dissection especially common among Chinese due suboptimal control blood pressure . Optimal treatment ABAD symptom onset remain uncertain . Conservative therapy heart rate blood pressure control acute phase essential treatment patient without serious complication concurrent mesenteric artery lower limb arterial embolism . The long-term survival ABAD still low though great improved medication optimization surgical repair technique past decade . It report 5-year 10-year survival rate ABAD 60 % 35 % respectively . As development minimally invasive technique recent year , endovascular repair procedure become routine procedure treatment patient ABAD , render improved prognosis 5-year survival rate close 80 % . Hypertension well known common cause AD . The statistic International Registry Acute Aortic Dissection ( IRAD ) demonstrate 72.1 % AD patient history hypertension . The hypertension may aggravate hematoma expansion result serious consequence . Therefore , effectively blood pressure control may alleviate severe pain cause acute AD lessen progression arterial dissection . The control hypertension primary treatment acute aortic dissection , maintain throughout entire treatment . Currently , guideline recommend decline transaortic pressure via control heart rate blood pressure AD patient acute phase . Theoretically , control blood pressure minimal level meeting sufficient end-organ perfusion decrease risk vessel rupture much possible . Whereas , much low blood pressure target may increase mortality patient . Powell colleague find minimum blood pressure increase 10mmHg ( vs. &lt; 70 mmHg , maximal 120 mmHg ) AD patient , risk death decrease 12 % ( OR = 0.88 , P &lt; 0.001 ) . Nevertheless , unanimous optimal target blood pressure patient AD far . The American Heart Association Canadian Cardiovascular Society recommend blood pressure control low 140/90mmHg , patient diabetes chronic renal failure , blood pressure target le 130/80 mmHg . Recently , Japanese Circulation Society recommend blood pressure control less 130mmHg . Hence , intensive control blood pressure &lt; 120 mmHg , compare &lt; 140 mmHg , may improve patient ' outcome . Thus , study , effect intensive blood pressure control ( &lt; 120mmHg ) conventional blood pressure control ( &lt; 140mmHg ) prognosis ABAD patient compare . Methods Study design set The study prospective randomize control trial recruit maximal 360 patient eight tertiary Chinese hospital 2 year . All patient new diagnosed ABAD participate hospital screen potential eligibility . The study approve ethic committee hospital ( 20160920-9 ) . Written inform consent sign patient legally authorize representative . The study register website ClinicalTrial.gov . Sites patient Doctors eight hospital attend kick-off meeting hold Courtyard Marriott , Hangzhou , March 19th , 2016 , discuss research protocol detail . The amend research protocol pass accord revise discussion result agreement participate unit . The method blood pressure measurement apparatus use unify . All hospital adopt similar non-invasive blood pressure monitor method unify monitoring frequency observe whether blood pressure control within target range two group . Likewise , blood pressure target discharge maintain level . All patient AD participate hospital conform follow inclusion exclusion criterion randomize . Inclusion exclusion criterion show part . Randomization Blocked randomization adopt intensive conventional blood pressure control treatment allocate random ratio 1:1 block size 4,6,8 , 10 360 subject . The study open label trial . After investigator participate center screen potential patient within 4 hour acute onset , number pre-allocated envelope gotten denote group patient allocate . Treatments All patient admit ICU general ward discretion doctor . Based guideline aortic management , patient receive analgesic therapy standard control heart rate blood pressure treatment . Intravenous esmolol use continuous control heart rate . Choice intravenous antihypertensive agent discretion charge physician . After stabilization situation , intravenous medication shift oral treatment . The target blood pressure intensive conventional group &lt; 140mmHg &lt; 120mmHg respectively . For patient , undergo endovascular treatment approximate two week later . Study endpoints The primary outcome composite in-hospital adverse outcome , include death , permanent paraplegia semi- paralysis hospitalization , renal failure require hemodialysis discharge . The secondary outcome include mortality 6-month 1-year , ICU length stay , total length hospital stay , postoperative renal injury , re- intervention . Data collection Research coordinator individual participate hospital collect require data case report form . However , data de-named special security code require access data . To facilitate communication investigator , case report form write Chinese . The primary research institute responsible collect check data center ; contact co-investigators various center check revise question . The primary research institute establish independent study quality control group implement disposal plan unexpected circumstance may occur . Sample size calculation interim analysis The primary outcome composite in-hospital adverse outcome , include death , stroke , permanent paraplegia semi- paralysis hospitalization , renal failure require hemodialysis discharge . Bashir et al report incidence comprehensive nosocomial severe prognostic adverse event ABAD 45.2 % . Assume incidence severe prognosis adverse event comprehensive hospital intensive blood pressure control could reduce 30 % , total 322 subject enrol study sufficient find difference statistically two group appropriate software calculation power 0.8 two-side test α = 0.05 . Considering dropout rate 10 % , propose include 360 case totally study . A formal interim analysis conduct halfway study enrollment . The overall type I error control use O'Brien-Fleming spending function , final significance level 0.05 primary end point . Statistical analysis Descriptive data report either mean ± SD , median ( interquartile range ) number percentage . With respect difference two group , categorical variable compare use chi-square analysis . Continuous variable compare use Independent Sample T test normally distribute data Mann-Whitney U test non-normally distribute data . For survival analysis , Kaplan-Meier estimate generate assess difference group use log-rank test , express data cumulative mortality curve . Statistical analysis perform use SPSS 16.0 ( Chicago , Ill , USA ) PASS 11.0 . Statistical significance define P value &lt; 0.05 . Discussion ABAD comprise approximately 30 % aortic dissection case . In contrast type A aortic dissection , patient type B dissection tend old , high rate atherosclerosis . Initial goal acute aortic dissection management direct control blood pressure heart rate , subsequently limit propagation false lumen control aortic shear stress . Whilst medical management demonstrate in-hospital mortality rate le 10 % , post-discharge acute type B aortic disease continue evolve eventually result complicate type B disease . Moreover , complicate acute type B aortic dissection show even strike mortality high 30 % , particularly elderly . Poor control blood pressure believe one main reason progress type B aortic dissection complication even laceration extend ascend aorta . Dalsart colleague demonstrate systolic blood pressure 130 mmHg associate big aortic enlargement type B aortic dissection ( P=0.02 ) . In another study 25 year follow-up 252 patient receive repair acute type A aortic dissection , patient maintain systolic blood pressure &lt; 120 mm Hg improve freedom reoperation , compare target blood pressure 120-140 mm Hg &gt; 140 mm Hg . Hence , guideline recommend reasonable initial target systolic blood pressure 100 120 mm Hg . However , target base hypothesis end-organs blood supply compromise . Data International Registry Acute Aortic Dissection ( IRAD ) show approximately one quarter patient present acute type B aortic dissection follow complicated category , include malperfusion spinal artery lead paresis , paraplegia malperfusion visceral artery lead abdominal pain . Thus , balance decrease blood pressure low amount maintain adequate end-organ perfusion challenge . Given vast majority patient type B aortic dissection history hypertension , low target blood pressure may comprise cerebral perfusion complicate organ perfusion , consequently cause stroke morbidity ischemic intestinal necrosis . On hand , much strict blood pressure target sometimes constrain patient daily activity may aggravate patient ' worry , inversely increased increase blood pressure . Unfortunately , empirical data trial guide optimal blood pressure target set various patient . Hence , study design bridge gap . In conclusion , investigator believe study provide new insight blood pressure management patient acute Type B aortic dissection subsequently improve outcome .</detailed_description>
