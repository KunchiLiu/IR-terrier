	<detailed_description>Older Adults ( OAs ) , age 65 year old , fast grow segment U.S. population . As life expectancy increase , maintain physical independence become public health priority . It well recognize regular physical activity ( PA ) do safely senior , multiple physical , emotional , cognitive benefit . Yet , remain least physically active age group . This suggest translational reach efficacious PA protocols real-world remains limited , need research scalable individual naturalistic setting exists . An emerge trend senior choose Independent Living Facilities ( ILFs ) home . ILFs offer variety social , cultural , fitness service .

This program offer 1 ) innovative potentially effective medium reach senior , 2 ) ability select sequence together session personalize fitness level , type exercise , duration , 3 ) organization ability provide desire wellness option meet resident organizational need . The purpose study provide initial research translate efficacious research-based PA protocols senior scalable format usable real-world ILF setting , gain knowledge individual organizational level improve implementation sustainability evidence-based approach . Specific Aims include extensive formative research use , interest , effectiveness interactive multimedia approach promote PA , integration senior living setting . A work prototype develop test usability ILF resident administrator , senior reside ILFs . Outcomes establish feasibility produce test STEP LIFE large-scale randomized trial . A large trial inform 1 ) future translation PA promotion OA residential setting ( e.g. , assist living , memory care , rural setting ) , 2 ) sustainable implementation strategy evidence-based health promotion protocols senior .</detailed_description>
