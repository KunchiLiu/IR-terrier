	<brief_summary>Breast milk readily accept ideal source nutrition almost infant , include premature low birth weight infant . However , high-risk infant require addition fortifiers milk order achieve sufficient level calorie , vitamin , mineral adequate growth . We currently use liquid human milk fortifier provide sufficient protein intake , require addition liquid protein supplement . A new product release provide sufficient protein liquid HMF , without acidification see previous product . This prospective , randomized noninferiority study compare safety efficacy new HMF additional protein current standard add additional protein supplementation top HMF .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Noninferiority Trial Liquid Human Milk Fortifier ( HMF ) Hydrolyzed Protein Versus Liquid HMF With Supplemental Liquid Protein</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>All infant admit Neonatal Intensive Care Unit ( NICU ) Cardinal Glennon gestational age &lt; 32 week birthweight &lt; 1500g , whose mother intend use breast milk ( maternal donor ) approach study participation . Infants enrol point feeding become fortified , typically around 8th day life . Eligible infant whose parent consent participation randomize one two study regimen . Sealed envelope contain subject treatment group prepare randomization schedule computer-generated use pseudorandom permute block algorithm . Multiples randomize together treatment group . The randomization block stratify birth weight ( 500-1000g 1001-1500g ) . Infants laboratory value follow sign metabolic acidosis nutritional status . These lab ( BMP , Magnesium , Phosphorous , Alkaline Phosphatase , prealbumin ) drawn study day 1 , 15 , 30 . Total blood volume labs approximately 1.4 mL , may obtain venipuncture heel stick . These lab monitor nutritional sufficiency low birth weight infant already , change timing lab obtain . Infants remain designated HMF one 3 different time point : 1 ) Infant tolerate HMF must take , 2 ) Infant longer receive breastmilk transition premature formula , 3 ) Infant get ready go home HMF remove feeding . Hospitalization data collect infant either discharge NICU reach 36 week correct gestational age , whichever occur first . Data collect include : birthweight , gestational age , gender , antenatal steroid , APGARs , day parenteral nutrition , day enteral feeding initiate , daily enteral volume intake , daily caloric protein intake , day HMF and/or liquid protein initiation . Lab data record noted . Growth data record daily weight weekly head circumference lengths . Intolerance assess incidence feeding intolerance , nil per o ( NPO ) time , change diet due intolerance , incidence metabolic acidosis , incidence necrotizing enterocolitis , incidence spontaneous intestinal perforation , cause death , length hospital stay . Data NICU complication , include late onset sepsis , retinopathy prematurity , intraventricular hemorrhage , bronchopulmonary dysplasia , use postnatal steroid ( affect growth ) also record . Neurodevelopmental data collect infant first Bayley evaluation Nursery Follow-up clinic , usually perform 15-18 month age . We record cognitive , language , motor score . We also collect information therapy service receive , incidence blindness deafness .</detailed_description>
