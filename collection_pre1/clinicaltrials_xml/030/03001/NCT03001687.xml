	<brief_title>Impact Vitamin D Supplementation Hepcidin Levels Transfusion Requirements Surgical Septic Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Patient blood management become important concept perioperative care surgical patient septic patient , aim improve outcome . Hepcidin might potential target reduce transfusion requirement major abdominal surgery patient sepsis . Major surgery sepsis induce complex immune dysregulations , characterise pro-inflammatory state ( postoperative acute-phase reaction ) . Excess hepcidin value acute inflammatory condition might represent exaggerated response lead iron-sequestration anemia , functional iron deficiency anemia . Vitamin D supplementation might constitute novel strategy modulate hepcidin-ferroportin-iron axis surgery sepsis-induced acute inflammation . Thus , vitamin D might impact hepcidin value might reduce transfusion requirement . I. Inflammation-induced regulation hepcidin-ferroportin-iron axis Surgery sepsis associate iron-restricted anemia . After major abdominal surgery sepsis , prototypical inflammatory syndrome , often complicate development anemia , appear . Inflammatory cytokine ( like interleukin 6 ) release acute infection alter iron metabolism induce excess synthesis hepcidin . Anemia major abdominal surgery sepsis may expression impaired erythropoiesis result hepcidin up-regulation . Hepcidin play role development anemia , together inhibition erythropoietin production , decrease lifespan erythrocyte , blunt erythropoietic response . Functional iron deficiency increasingly recognise cause anemia general surgical patient patient sepsis . Iron two-faced element . First , iron essential living incorporate `` breathing '' molecule haemoglobin mitochondrial respiratory chain . On hand , iron detrimental due generation oxidative stress availability grow bacteria . Low serum iron level consider detrimental lead anemia low tissue oxygen delivery . Iron deficiency anemia associate poor outcome surgical septic patient . Also , transfusion associate immune suppression adverse reaction . Thus , approach correction anemia advocate , even though yet include clinical practice . Hepcidin master regulator iron metabolism hence , modulator anemia state inflammation . Hepcidin acute phase protein synthetised liver act hyposideremia induce hormone . It bind ferroportin ( iron exporter ) prevent release iron cell : prevents absorption dietary iron enterocytes prevents iron release macrophage , store . Thus , effect hepcidin would iron sequestration , lower serum iron concentration . The beneficial result would low availability iron bacterial growth ( thus , direct antimicrobial effect ) less oxidative stress . The detrimental result limited possibility synthesis new haemoglobin molecule occurrence anemia . The up-regulation hepcidin , pro-inflammatory biomarker , characterise acute chronic inflammatory condition . The induction hepcidin synthesis may cause iron-restricted erythropoiesis surgical population patient sepsis . The induction hepcidin synthesis may contribute development anemia , detrimental tissue oxygenation might increase transfusion requirement aggravation immune suppression blood transfusion . In animal model anemia due inflammation , hepcidin knockout mouse milder anemia fast recovery . Excess value iron regulate hormone hepcidin cause intracellular sequestration iron might decrease availability iron erythropoiesis , lead anemia frequently encounter inflammatory condition . Anemia frequent among critically ill patient , associate increased transfusion rate worse outcomes . Anemia may impair oxygen delivery peripheral tissue impose transfusion , carry risk immune suppression . Recent data emphasise need restrict transfusion much possible , transfusion associate increased morbidity mortality . Instead , alternative method improve anemia ameliorate tissue oxygen delivery might beneficial . II . Vitamin D down-regulates hepcidin expression Vitamin D hormone promote bone health , also wide range cellular activity include differentiation hematopoietic cell down-regulation inflammatory cytokine . Vitamin D anti-inflammatory immune-regulating property maintenance adequate vitamin D status may play role manage inflammation immunity . Vitamin D supplementation patient chronic inflammatory condition like chronic kidney disease improve value circulate marker inflammation immunity . Recently , highlight certain condition , like chronic kidney disease , administration vitamin D reduce serum hepcidin value transfusion requirement . Up , data regard possibility use vitamin D supplementation surgical septic shock patient , physician could target hepcidin-ferroportin-iron axis prevent occurrence anemia , hence , reduce transfusion requirement . Oral vitamin D supplementation lower hepcidin value might increase erythropoiesis decrease inflammation . III . Vitamin D supplementation critically ill. Safety profile The therapeutic potential vitamin D topic intense interest . A high prevalence low vitamin D level confirm patient critically ill. Vitamin D deficiency associate high infection rate , 30-day mortality in-hospital mortality adult critically ill patient . During critical illness , vitamin D supplementation favorable safety profile possible mechanism vitamin D supplementation induce bactericidal pleiotropic effect suggest . To improve vitamin D status , high-dose vitamin D require critically ill , display blunt response supplementation . Recent evidence suggest treatment vitamin-D deficient critically ill patient may improve outcome mortality , possibly enhance innate immunity inhibition proinflammatory cytokine . Further clinical trial explore effect vitamin D supplementation up-regulation process proinflammatory cytokine need .</detailed_description>
