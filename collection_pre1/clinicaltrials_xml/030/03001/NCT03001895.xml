	<brief_summary>Prostate specific membrane antigen ( PSMA ) unique membrane bound glycoprotein , overexpressed manifold prostate cancer cell well-characterized image biomarker prostate cancer . Positron emission tomography / computer tomography ( PET/CT ) nuclear medicine procedure base measurement positron emission radiolabeled tracer molecule . 18F-DCFPyL tracer prostate cancer PET image bind PSMA . The strength functional imaging method distinguish tissue accord metabolism rather structure . Studies show PET/CT image 18F-DCFPyL detect prostate cancer lesion excellent contrast high detection rate even level prostate specific antigen low . The objective study evaluate patient-wide SUVmax 18F-DCFPyL PET/CT locoregional metastatic prostate cancer correlate histopathologic Gleason score initial biopsy . It hypothesize SUVmax correlate positively Gleason score . This interest non-invasive risk stratification may possible future .</brief_summary>
