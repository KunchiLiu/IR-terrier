	<brief_summary>Water electrolytic homeostasis remarkably control mineralocorticoid pathway ( renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system act renal tubule ) . However , neonatal period human characterize reduced ability kidney ensure normal function urine concentration maintenance sodium water balance . This renal functional immaturity , associate premature infant ( VPT ) ( bear &lt; 32 week amenorrhea ( SA ) ) immaturity adrenal responsible default aldosterone biosynthesis . This relative aldosterone deficiency induces difficulty VPT adapt extra-uterine life maintain positive sodium balance essential postnatal growth . The improvement perinatal care ( antenatal corticosteroid maturation , ventilation technique use surfactant ) increase survival child . Nevertheless , extreme prematurity ( le 32 week ) , concern nearly 2 % live birth France , remain associated neurodevelopmental sequelae nearly 40 % child 5 year . Secondary hydroelectrolytic disorder transient mineralocorticoid adrenal insufficiency probably one factor responsible neurological deleterious outcome well occurrence complication ( bronchopulmonary dysplasia , enterocolitis necrotizing ) extreme prematurity . Indeed , aside administration antenatal steroid induce maturation , prevention postnatal dehydration reduces risk intracranial hemorrhage population . However , high fluid intake associate increase incidence patent ductus arteriosus , bronchopulmonary dysplasia necrotizing enterocolitis . This necessitate evaluation preventive measure avoid fluid electrolyte imbalance pharmacological approach base mineralocorticoid administration premature infant , due relative aldosterone deficiency identify population .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Extreme prematurity affect 2 % birth per year France subject significant morbidity mortality . It likely fluid electrolyte imbalance associate mineralocorticoid adrenal insufficiency transient observe population vulnerable newborn contribute occurrence complication influence prognosis medium long term child . The expected impact pilot study direct benefit patient , reduce kidney soda loss 3rd day life throughout first week life ( assessed non-invasive method : urine collection compress measurement urinary Na / creatinine ) . This physiological approach ( substitution deficient hormone ) allow good control sodium water balance . This could limit number common complication extreme prematurity , occur first week life , patent ductus arteriosus , intra-ventricular hemorrhage bronchopulmonary dysplasia . The administration glucocorticoid postnatal period ( action glucocorticoid mineralocorticoid ) enable reduction incidence bronchopulmonary dysplasia severe . However , treatment associate increase incidence neurodevelopmental effect relate activation glucocorticoid pathway . Using specific mineralocorticoid agonist preserve beneficial effect without adverse effect observe . The result pilot study second time consider clinical trial Phase III national international evaluate significant reduction complication substitution Fludrocortisone first week life great premature . These result major medical economic impact . Indeed , neonatal morbidity indicator ( intraventricular hemorrhage , patent ductus arteriosus , bronchopulmonary dysplasia enterocolitis necrotizing ) associate subsequent development neurodevelopmental sequela ( cerebral palsy / cognitive impairment ) age two five year .</detailed_description>
