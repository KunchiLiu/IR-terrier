	<brief_title>Study Angiogenic Cell Therapy Progressive Pulmonary Hypertension : Intervention With Repeat Dosing eNOS-enhanced EPCs</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>SAPPHIRE use autologous progenitor cell-based gene delivery enhance lung microvascular repair regeneration patient severe symptomatic PAH . A total 45 patient enrol multi-centre , phase II , randomize , double-blind , placebo-controlled , 3-arm protocol . Up seven centre across Canada participate . Consented study participant meet eligibility criterion screen period schedule undergo apheresis . Following successful apheresis collection receipt cell sample cell manufacture facility , randomization take place though web-based system . Manufacturing cell therapy product perform cell manufacture facility accord assign treatment allocation : Arm 1 : Placebo ( Plasma-Lyte A ; 4 monthly IV infusion ) Course 1 ( 1st 6 month ) follow Autologous EPCs transfected human eNOS Course 2 ( 2nd 6 month ; 4 monthly IV infusion ) Arm 2 : Autologous EPCs transfected human eNOS Course 1 ( 1st 6 month ; 4 monthly IV infusion ) follow Placebo ( Plasma-Lyte A ) Course 2 ( 2nd 6 month ; 4 monthly IV infusion ) Arm 3 : Autologous EPCs transfected human eNOS Course 1 ( 1st 6 month ; 4 monthly IV infusion ) follow repeat dose Autologous EPCs transfected human eNOS Course 2 ( 2nd 6 month ; 4 monthly IV infusion ) Approximately 5-9 day later , study product transport investigative site initial treatment deliver study participant outpatient set equip continuous monitoring vital sign oxygen saturation . Participants subsequently monitor minimum 1 hour discharge clinic judged study investigator clinically stable . Treatment follow-up assessment take place 12-month period ( 11 study visit total ) . Once 12-month trial data collection complete , trial convert registry goal collect long-term safety information annual telephone contact 10 year . Participants permit enroll clinical trial registry period .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Age ≥ 18 year , ≤ 80 year Established diagnosis pulmonary arterial hypertension due following : Idiopathic hereditable PAH ; Scleroderma associate PAH ( limited diffuse ) ; Drugs ( anorexigens ) toxins ; Congenital heart defect ( atrial septal defect , ventricular septal defect , patent ductus arteriosus ) repair ≥ 1 year WHO functional class II , III , IV appropriate stable therapy PAH least 3 month prior screen period randomization , apart modification anticoagulant diuretic dosage . Able walk unassisted ( oxygen use allow ) . An average 6Minute Walk Distance ( 6MWD ) ≥ 125 meter ≤ 400 meter two consecutive test Screening period . Previous diagnostic right heart cardiac catheterization ( RHC ) within last five year finding consistent PAH : specifically , mean pulmonary arterial pressure ( mPAP ) ≥ 25 mmHg ( rest ) ; pulmonary capillary wedge pressure ( PCWP ) ( leave ventricular end diastolic pressure ) ≤15 mmHg , pulmonary vascular resistance ( PVR ) &gt; 5 WU . Echocardiography perform within 6 month prior Screening Period confirm left atrial volume index ( LAVI ) ≤ 34 ml/m2 absence clinically significant leave heart disease include evidence mild leftsided valvular heart disease , systolic diastolic leave ventricular dysfunction Ventilation perfusion ( VQ ) nuclear scan perform within last five year show absence ( i.e . low probability ) pulmonary embolism . Pulmonary function test conduct within 12 month prior Screening Period confirm : total lung capacity ( TLC ) ≥ 70 % predict value ; force expiratory volume one second ( FEV1 ) ≥ 70 % predict value . Must rest arterial oxygen saturation ( SaO2 ) ≥88 % without supplemental oxygen measure pulse oximetry Screening Visit Must enrol exercise training program pulmonary rehabilitation within 3 month prior Screening Visit must agree enroll exercise training program pulmonary rehabilitation Screening Period first 6 month study . Participants enrol exercise program pulmonary rehabilitation 3 month prior screen may enter study agree maintain current level rehabilitation first 6 month study . Women childbearing potential ( define less 1 year postmenopausal surgically sterile ) must practice abstinence use two highly effective method contraception ( define method birth control result low failure rate , i.e. , less 1 % per year , approve hormonal contraceptive , barrier method [ condom diaphragm ] use spermicide , intrauterine device ) . Subjects must negative ßhCG pregnancy test Screening period negative urine pregnancy test result study visit . Willing able comply study requirement restriction Pregnant lactating . PAH related condition cover inclusion criterion , include limited pulmonary venous hypertension , pulmonary venoocclusive disease , pulmonary capillary hemangiomatosis , chronic thromboembolic pulmonary hypertension . Evidence mild interstitial lung disease Chest CT within last 5 year ( last 3 year patient scleroderma associate PAH ) . Treatment investigational drug , device therapy within 3 month prior screen period schedule receive investigational drug , device therapy course study . Any musculoskeletal disease disease would significantly limit ambulation . Unrepaired recently repair ( &lt; 1 year ) congenital systemictopulmonary shunt patent foramen ovale . Historical evidence significant coronary arterial disease ( CAD ) ANY ONE following : History MI History PCI Angiographic evidence CAD ( &gt; 50 % stenosis ≥1 vessel ) Positive Stress Test Previous CABG Stable angina If significant CAD , participant ALL THREE remain AMBITION study HFpEF risk factor exclude : BMI ≥ 30 kg/m2 , AND History essential hypertension , AND Diabetes mellitus ( type ) Creatinine clearance &lt; 30 ml/min ( use CockroftGault formula ) require hemodialysis . Inability undergo apheresis procedure due poor venous access laboratory test within acceptable range ( include INR patient Coumadin ) . ChildsPugh class C liver cirrhosis Previous atrial septostomy . Any clinically significant illness abnormal laboratory value ( measure screen period ) , opinion Investigator , might put subject risk harm study might adversely affect interpretation study data .
