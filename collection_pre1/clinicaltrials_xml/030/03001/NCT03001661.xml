	<brief_summary>Induction labour ( labour start artificially ) traditionally carried range different drug surgery ( rupture membrane 'waters ' ) . Dilapan-S mechanical device , know osmotic cervical dilator , provide alternative drug surgery . Thin rod absorbent material ( active drug present ) insert neck womb ( cervix ) , absorb fluid , swell mimic natural process 'ripening ' ( prepare ) cervix . This initial process important contraction begin . Unlike drug , Dilapan-S cause premature contraction , frequent , may cause baby become distressed . The project compare cervical ripen use Dilapan-S standard use prostaglandin drug . Women single pregnancy , require induction labour , consider high risk , invited participate . Investigators hope recruit 860 woman UK maternity unit 2 year . Participants equal chance randomise drug , standard practice , cervical dilator . The speed labour commences , mode delivery side effect compare . Importantly , investigator shall also assess patient satisfaction anxiety induction process , ask participant complete short questionnaire experience go home baby . If osmotic dilator effective investigator expect NICE consider option alongside cervical ripen method .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Prospective , Phase III , UK , Open , Multicentre , Superiority , Randomised Controlled Trial CE mark medical device Investigational Medicinal Product ( CTIMP ) . Potentially eligible patient identify obstetrician midwife , base need induction labour . Once decision induce labour make , woman approach participate trial give patient information leaflet ( PIL ) enclose induction admission letter . Patients wish enter trial confirm eligibility obstetrician . Prior patient undertake trial-related procedure , inform consent obtain . Participants randomise 1:1 ratio either 1 ) synthetic osmotic cervical dilator 2 ) 10-mg controlled-release dinoprostone vaginal insert . Randomisation provide computer generate programme . A research assistant disclose nature assignment enrolment . Investigators calculate 860 patient ( 430 arm ) need recruit 2 year period . Given nature intervention , SOLVE trial blind trial . Full data collection conduct patient give informed consent , medical record . This include baseline data , detail mother child birth . Patients also ask complete maternal satisfaction questionnaire discharge . There follow-up patient post-discharge care unless Serious Adverse Event require . If patient withdraws consent study , data collection stop . Only anonymised data enter Case Report Forms ( CRFs ) study team . Details patient approach trial record trial Screening Log , fully anonymised copy return trial office review .</detailed_description>
