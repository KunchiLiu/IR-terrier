	<brief_summary>This study compare patient low back pain ( LBP ) age gender match control determine difference two group relate : range movement , secondary outcome ( level disability , quality life , evidence depression , anxiety stress ) , movement pattern demographic characteristic . The first phase include baseline 3 month follow-up assessment LBP patient control , include demographic characteristic , outcome measure , physical assessment . The second phase ongoing phase continue interim assessment LBP patient , 6 12 month .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The first phase study use non-randomized two-group prospective longitudinal study design ( Group A subject LBP , Group B subject without LBP ) . The second phase study use single-group prospective longitudinal study design ( Group A , subject low back pain ) . A timeline step-by-step detail study procedure phase also describe Appendix B . Group A include subject LBP , member research team screen attempt consecutively enroll patient undergo assessment low back pain two clinical location ( International Spine Pain &amp; Performance Center , Synergy Manual Physical Therapy ) . The enrollment baseline visit occur time . During enrollment subject privately brief purpose involvement study allow ask question opt interested . Informed consent review sign subject give copy consent form ( 15 minute ) . Since collection `` baseline data '' ( outcome measure ViMove Assessment ) already consider standard clinical practice subject low back pain clinical setting , provide informed consent would allow researcher access information purpose registry . A summary information collect baseline include : patient demographics/medical history ( age , gender , pain episode duration , BMI , employment , marital status , comorbidities , co-interventions , ICD-10 LBP diagnosis ) , outcome measure ( LBP movement pattern classification , LBP Classifier Questionnaire , QVAS back leg , Oswestry Disability index , START-Keele , Fear Avoidance Behavior Questionnaire , EuroQol-5D , DASS-21 , patient perception movement contribution pain ) ( 20 minute ) , assessment ( ViMove standard assessment , 30 sec chair test , 40m walk test ) ( 25 minute ) . See Appendix C. Group B include subject without LBP , member research team recruit volunteer within DC metro area use flyer post campus George Washington University , local DC metro gymnasium recreational center , word mouth email list serf associate educational program within The George Washington University School Medicine Health Sciences . Subjects screen phone presence history low back pain well exclusion criterion . If subject agrees move forward participation ask come The George Washington University Program Physical Therapy locate 2000 Pennsylvania Ave Suite 2000 , NW Washington DC 20006 , International Spine Pain &amp; Performance Center Synergy Manual Physical Therapy . Enrollment baseline visit occur time . During enrollment subject privately brief purpose involvement study allow ask question opt interested . Informed consent review sign subject give copy consent form ( 15 minute ) . Baseline data collect include : subject demographics/medical history ( age , gender , BMI , employment , marital status , comorbidities , co-interventions ) QVAS back leg , EQ-5D , DASS-21 ( 10 minute ) ViMove standard assessment , 30 sec chair test , 40m walk test ( 25 minute ) . See Appendix C. ViMove Testing ( Groups A &amp; B ) : The ViMove system ( dorsaVi , Australia ) use assess movement pattern lumbar muscle activity group ViMove standard assessment , 30 sec chair test , 40m walk test , inertial measurement system comprise two wireless motion sensor contain triaxial accelerometer , triaxial gyroscope magnetometer , two wireless surface electromyography ( EMG ) sensor , small wireless record device ( RFD ) wear subject . The manufacturer report average difference &lt; 1 degree single plane , range movement compare match measurement ViMove Fastrak opto-electronic device ( Charry , Umer et al . 2011 ) . The ViMove motion sensor collect data approximately 20 Hz . When ViMove test perform group , 4 sensor adhere subject 's skin use customise biocompatible adhesive . The placement sensor determine use template validate part FDA 510K application . During test , sensor communicate data wirelessly RFD connect computer run dorsaVi ( ViMove software ) . Customised algorithms convert data generate software meaningful biomechanical information , include measure range movement , peak angle , speed movement muscle activation . Subjects Group A follow-up healthcare provider base standard clinical care practice . Enrolled subject Group A undergo follow 3 month , 6 month 12 month ( 45 minute session ) ; follow visit may may coincide regular clinical office visit healthcare provider . Subjects Group B follow 3 month ( 35 minute ) . Follow include complete outcome measure assessment collect baseline well collection patient status , event , protocol deviation . Subjects may exit research project follow circumstance : - Subject chooses withdraw ( e.g . consent withdrawal ) - At end follow-up period - Investigator deem withdrawal necessary ( e.g . medically justified , failure patient maintain adequate registry compliance ) - Subject death - Subject longer available follow-up</detailed_description>
