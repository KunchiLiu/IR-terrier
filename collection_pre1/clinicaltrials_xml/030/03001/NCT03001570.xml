	<brief_summary>Nowadays association radiotherapy anti- Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor ( anti-EGFR ) monoclonal antibody Cetuximab represent valid option treatment head neck locally advance squamous neoplasm , particularly , oropharynx carcinoma . Up date indirect comparison standard curative treatment ( i.e . concurrent radiochemotherapy ) preliminary data show equivalent efficacy regimen . For reason , concurrent Cetuximab radiotherapy administer patient eligible chemoradiotherapy . The introduction Cetuximab associate new kind toxicity , especially cutaneous , increasingly report . The aim study improve toxicity/benefit ratio patient receive concurrent radiotherapy cetuximab locally advanced head neck neoplasm . Hence , improvement could achieve modulate radiation therapy dose per fraction follow Cetuximab pharmacokinetics .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Radiobiological rationale Overexpression EGFR find involve two different mechanism response ionize radiation : former relate increase cell proliferation rate , latter lead low radiosensitivity . 1 . Increasing cell proliferation rate From analysis already report evidence , quantify effect high cell proliferation rate due overexpression EGFR . These finding report patient affect squamous carcinoma head neck district evaluate EGFR status . In patient , local recurrence compare patient different length treatment fractionation . Consequently , real doubling time subgroup high low EGFR expression extrapolate . From extrapolated value , equivalent dos day non-delivered treatment calculate patient receive accelerated schedule . Furthermore , dose report relation different primary site ( oropharynx , larynx , oral cavity , hypopharynx ) . Modification double time ( TD ) neoplastic cell population patient Low High EGFR expression . 2 . Reduction radiosensitivity Unfortunately , radiosensitizing drug modify radiosensitivity evaluate retrospectively . Actually , efficacy evaluate basis overall effect treatment radiosensitivity change day day radiation pharmacological concurrent treatment . However , change radiosensitivity analyse pre-clinical setting . In many report , progressively high radiosensitivity show cellular survival curve increase EGFR inhibitor concentration . Nevertheless , concentration EGFR inhibitor correspond vivo concentration radiotherapy delivery . Fortunately , data obtainable Cetuximab pharmacokinetic curve . Therefore , cell survival curve correspond drug concentration obtain perform graphic interpolation . From curve , daily radiosensitivity parameter find . Subsequently , daily dos respect daily radiosensitivity identify radiobiological calculation model . This fractionation , design Cetuximab pharmacokinetics , calculate equivalent curative treatment ( 70Gy give conventional schedule ) . At time , low cutaneous toxicity expect `` modulate '' schedule due possibly increase cellular repair . Pharmacokinetics data Cetuximab find population : Vmax 4.38mg/h ( 15.4 % ) , Km 74g/ml , central compartment volume Vl 2.83 l ( 18.6 % ) , peripheral compartment volume 2.43 l ( 56.4 % ) intercompartmental clearance 0.103 l/h ( 97.2 % ) . Those parameter remain unmodified also prolonged therapy . Administrated dos find adequate cell wall receptor saturation . A definition overexpression EGFR still lack . Different cut-offs propose distinguish patient `` high expression '' patient `` low expression '' EGFR . In recent study adoption accelerate fractionation show advantage patient expression EGFR &gt; 50 % . Thus , adopt cut-off study .</detailed_description>
