	<brief_summary>The purpose study compare two medication currently inject intra-operatively help decrease pain surgery patient undergo primary total hip replacement ( THR ) . The two medication Exparel® ( bupivacaine liposome injectable suspension ) plus bupivacaine epinephrine versus bupivacaine epinephrine . This study look see one medication work well manage post-operative pain THR . The study hypothesis Exparel® plus bupivacaine epinephrine demonstrate well pain management THR patient post-operatively . Both medication FDA-approved post-operative analgesia .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Intraoperative Liposomal Bupivacaine vs. Bupivacaine Total Hip Replacement Pain Management</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>All surgery perform orthopaedic surgeon . Two group , one receiving Exparel® ( bupivacaine liposome injectable suspension ) plus bupivacaine epinephrine ( LB group ) receive bupivacaine epinephrine ( Control group ) , compare use post-operative pain score , hospital length stay , time ambulation , fall , narcotic use , narcotic-related adverse effect . Aside hospital length stay , outcomes record 72 hour follow surgery . An priori power analysis perform calculate total number patient need enrolled achieve minimum 90 % power , threshold statistical significance set 0.05 . Based previous study report mean oral opioid consumption 57.04mg ± 25.6 24 hour post THR , mean difference 17.14mg consider clinically significant . Thus , least 26 patient necessary group adequately power assessment . The diagnosis osteoarthritis determine patient history , physical examination , image finding . Each patient receive thorough explanation protocol , willing patient sign informed consent form . All patient underwent personal preoperative education program regard pre , intra- , post-procedural information include physical therapy , expectation , discharge goal , home therapy , pain management . After write consent collect , form sent hospital pharmacy randomization . Envelopes randomize , seal , number , give pharmacy staff , ultimately dispense envelope nurse operating room numerical order . The pharmacy document required information , select medication , drug accountability form accord content envelope . A nurse deliver study drug operate room seal , non-descriptive envelope . During standard anterior approach procedure , anesthesiologist administer fentanyl hydromorphone need analgesia . The local anesthetic administer reduction implant . Patients LB group receive 20cc liposomal bupivacaine , 40cc 0.25 % bupivacaine epinephrine , 20cc normal saline . Each patient control group receive 60cc 0.25 % bupivacaine epinephrine . Using 20-gauge spinal needle , local anesthetic inject use deep tissue administration technique . Structures innervate femoral nerve , superior gluteal nerve , lateral femoral cutaneous nerve consider suitable injection . Throughout administration , frequent aspiration perform check blood minimize risk intravascular injection . The patient , surgical team , floor staff blind local anesthetic drug give . During hospitalization , patient observe , evaluate treat accord postoperative protocol . Patients receive opioids pain management need , routinely documented hospital staff . Opioids include fentanyl , hydromorphone , oxycodone , codeine , tramadol , morphine , hydrocodone . All opioid dosage convert morphine equivalent dosage analysis . Each patient begin physical therapy within first 24 hour postoperatively . Patients discharge able begin self-care , pain control utilizing oral regimen , able tolerate oral medication intake .</detailed_description>
