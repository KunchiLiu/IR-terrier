	<brief_title>Interrupted Oblique Intradermal Suture Versus Conventional Interrupted Intradermal Suture</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Bi-layered skin closure one common method close cutaneous defect . The deep layer close conventional interrupted intradermal suture use absorbable material , superficial layer approximate simple interrupted simple continuous suture use non-absorbable material . The cosmetic result bi-layered closure well simple interrupted suture alone , interrupt intradermal suture component play major role reduce wound tension , effect minimize suture mark . Although advantages bi-layered closure recognize , bi-layered closure often use favor simple interrupted suture due fact interrupt intradermal suture time consume suture material require . Thus , intradermal suturing technique identify take less time require less material yielding similar cosmetic result , patient would opportunity receive bi-layered closure obtain good wound outcome . Several novel intradermal suture technique could alternative conventional interrupted intradermal suture technique , include bury butterfly suture , double butterfly suture , subcutaneous invert cross mattress suture , interrupt oblique intradermal suture . Among novel technique , interrupt oblique intradermal suture ( OIS ) recognize relative simplicity . OIS easy perform , even beginner . The simplicity effectiveness OIS increase potential become one standard suture technique medical practice . OIS similar conventional interrupt intradermal suture ( IS ) , except suture OIS cant angled relative vertical plane . To perform OIS , needle pass deep superficial dermis cant 30°-60° normal vertical plane . The needle inserted opposite wound edge superficial deep dermis mirror-image fashion . The thread tie square knot finish suture . The key characteristic distinguishes OIS IS OIS involve suture angle vertical plane IS involve suture vertical plane . In theory , OIS hybrid method combine IS bury horizontal butterfly suture . OIS combine ability IS reduce tension wound edge ability horizontal butterfly suture provide good wound edge apposition eversion . Because OIS cant , provide tension vertical horizontal plane . Moreover , 1 stitch OIS yield wound closure approximately equal 2 stitch IS due horizontal distance 1 OIS stitch 2 VIS stitch . Accordingly , infer OIS result 50 % reduction suture time suture material use . However , OIS obstacle many novel suture technique little literature support OIS clinically make usage generalization TIS remain limited . It hypothesize OIS equivalence IS wound outcome consumes less time less suture material . This study aim demonstrate equivalence wound outcomes interrupted oblique intradermal suture ( OIS ) conventional interrupt intradermal suture ( IS ) method .</detailed_description>
