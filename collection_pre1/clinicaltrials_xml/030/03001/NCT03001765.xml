	<brief_summary>Hypothesis : Patients previously discharge emergency department subsequent non-diagnostic 30 day external patch monitor suspect arrhythmia benefit early Reveal LINQ™ Insertable Cardiac Monitoring System placement . Primary Study Objectives : To evaluate outcome intensive monitoring strategy ( patient negative 30 day SEEQ™ Mobile Cardiac Telemetry ( MCT ) System result purpose Reveal LINQ™ Insertable Cardiac Monitoring System ) patient suspect previously document arrhythmias result clinically actionable event .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Eligible patient enrol presentation Emergency Department St. Elizabeth Healthcare symptom suggestive cardiac arrhythmia prior leave emergency department . Patients exit study consider complete identification cardiac arrhythmia define protocol ( endpoint ) , 12 month enrollment date , whichever occur first . Protocol define endpoint 1 . Planned insertion permanent pacemaker , implantable cardiac defibrillator chronic resynchronization device . 2 . Planned cardiac ablation procedure . 3 . Initiation medical therapy purpose treat dysrhythmia . 4 . Diagnosis arrhythmia require medical invasive arrhythmia management .</detailed_description>
