Recruitment : In first place , staff Nursing home Solis inform intervention . Consequently , initial selection suitable client take place . Clients receive palliative care participate study . Suitable client caregiver inform study mean informative presentation well informative letter client caregiver ask give informed consent . Randomisation : Two location nurse home Solis non-randomly allocate experimental control condition . Participants live experimental location receive movement-oriented dementia care ( MDC ) , participant live control location receive care usual . Procedure : Movement-oriented Dementia Care give many resident possible psychogeriatric ward intervention location .
