	<criteria>Step 1 HIV1 infection , document licensed rapid HIV test HIV enzyme chemiluminescence immunoassay ( E/CIA ) test kit time prior study entry confirm licensed Western blot second antibody test method initial rapid HIV and/or E/CIA , HIV1 antigen , plasma HIV1 RNA viral load . NOTE : The term `` license '' refers US FDAapproved kit , require IND study , site locate country United States , kit certify licensed oversight body within country validate internally . For Cohort A participant , ART initiate chronic infection ( e.g. , 6 month estimate date infection , determine site investigator and/or available medical record ) . For Cohort B , diagnosis acute HIV infection ( AHI ) ( define criterion list ) initiation ART within 45 day AHI diagnosis ( define early date positive HIV1 RNA antigen/antibody assay ) . 1 . Documented diagnosis Fiebig Stages IIIV . OR 2 . Enzyme chemiluminescence immunoassay ( E/CIA ) IgM positive , HIV1 RNA p24 antigenpositive , negative indeterminate Western blot . OR 3 . Diagnosis Fiebig stag III , ART initiate &gt; 10 day AHI diagnosis . Diagnosis Fiebig stage III infection involve follow criterion : E/CIA negative , HIV1 RNA p24 antigenpositive , negative indeterminate Western blot . NOTE : Candidates diagnose AHI base criterion ( `` c '' ) must positive HIV1 RNA test subsequently positive Western blot . Receiving continuous ART least 2 year NNRTI , PI , INSTIcontaining regimen . NOTE A : ART interruption 7 day least 90 day prior entry acceptable . NOTE B : Within betweenclass change ART within previous 2 year acceptable . For candidate whose ART include NNRTI , willingness ability change PI INSTIcontaining regimen least 4 week prior ART interruption local availability regimen . Nadir CD4+ cell count ≥200 cells/mm3 . NOTE : Candidate recall documentation acceptable . CD4+ cell count ≥500 cells/mm3 obtain within 60 day prior study entry US laboratory compliant Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments ( CLIA ) equivalent network approve nonUS laboratory operate accordance Good Clinical Laboratory Practices ( GCLP ) participate appropriate external quality assurance ( EQA ) program . One document plasma HIV1 RNA limit detection FDAapproved assay ( limit detection : 75 , 50 , 40 , 20 copies/mL ) 12 24 month prior screen HIV1 RNA one document HIV1 RNA limit detection FDAapproved assay ( limit detection : 75 , 50 , 40 , 20 copies/mL ) collect few 12 month prior screen HIV1 RNA . Plasma HIV1 RNA level &lt; 20 copies/mL obtain Roche TaqMan v2.0 assay &lt; 40 copies/mL obtain Abbott assay , within 60 day prior entry . The following laboratory value obtain within 60 day prior entry US laboratory compliant CLIA equivalent network approve nonUS laboratory operate accordance GCLP participate appropriate EQA program . Absolute neutrophil count ( ANC ) ≥750 cells/mm3 Hemoglobin ≥11.0 g/dL men ≥10.0 g/dL woman Platelet count ≥100,000/mm3 Creatinine ≤1.5 mg/dL Aspartate aminotransferase ( AST ) ( SGOT ) ≤1.5x upper limit normal ( ULN ) Alanine aminotransferase ( ALT ) ( SGPT ) ≤1.5x ULN HCV antibody negative result obtain within 60 day prior study entry , HCV antibody result positive , negative HCV RNA result within 60 day prior study entry positive HCV RNA result within 24 week prior entry . Ability willingness participant provide inform consent . Willingness blood sample collect stored indefinitely use HIVrelated research purpose . For female reproductive potential ( woman postmenopausal least 24 consecutive month , i.e. , menses within precede 24 month , woman undergo surgical sterilization , specifically hysterectomy , bilateral oophorectomy and/or bilateral salpingectomy ) , negative serum urine pregnancy test within 48 hour prior study entry . NOTE : Acceptable documentation hysterectomy bilateral oophorectomy , bilateral salpingectomy , tubal microinserts , partner undergone vasectomy , menopause participantreported history . All participant must agree use barrier protection ( e.g. , condom , dental dam ) sexual activity throughout entire course study prevent HIV transmission . All participant must agree participate conception process ( e.g. , active attempt become pregnant impregnate , sperm donation , vitro fertilization ) . If participate sexual activity could lead pregnancy , participant/partner must use least two reliable form contraceptive ( e.g. , condom , without spermicidal agent ; diaphragm cervical cap spermicide ; IUD ; hormonebased contraception ) , least one barrier method , study . Site investigator anticipate fully active alternative ART regimen could construct would available event virologic failure participant 's current ART regimen . Absence either active hepatitis B virus ( HBV ) infection , indicate negative hepatitis B surface antigen ( HBsAg ) HBV viral load assay within 60 day prior entry know chronic hepatitis B infection base previously positive HBV DNA positive HBsAg without subsequent positive hepatitis B surface antibody ( HBsAb ) . Step 1 Any plasma HIV1 RNA limit detection FDAapproved assay ( limit detection : 75 , 50 , 40 , 20 copies/mL ) within 24 month prior entry . NOTE : A single unconfirmed `` blip '' ( i.e. , plasma HIV1 RNA limit detection &lt; 200 copies/mL ) allow precede followed value limit detection blip occur 6 month prior study entry . Currently breastfeed plan breastfeed course study pregnant . Active drug alcohol use dependence , opinion site investigator , would interfere adherence study requirement . Acute serious illness , opinion site investigator , require systemic treatment and/or hospitalization within 60 day prior entry . Any history AIDSdefining illness use current list U.S. Centers Disease Control Prevention ( CDC ) 's website . Receipt studydefined prohibited medication within 6 month prior entry . Prior history difficulty establish venous access current contraindication leukapheresis , opinion site investigator base assessment . Receipt vaccination within 1 week prior entry . NOTE : The entry visit must schedule ensure 1 week elapse vaccination .</criteria>
