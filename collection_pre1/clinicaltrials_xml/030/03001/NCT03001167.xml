	<detailed_description>This study aim prospectively determine mechanistic link antibiotic exposure , disruption infant gut microbiome development , obesity child . Given prevalence early life antibiotic use health consequence obesity , evidence propose association important implication public health pediatric medicine . Currently United States , 32 % labor woman receive intrapartum antibiotic reach unborn baby almost 10 % newborn give broad-spectrum antibiotic immediately birth . After discharge nursery , infant young child high rate antibiotic prescribing age group US , approximately 15 % child receive systemic antibiotic six month age . Animal study link antibiotic-induced alteration microbiome adiposity , large prospective human study explore association entire spectrum early life antibiotic exposure , gut microbiome development , obesity conduct . In order address knowledge gap , study assemble longitudinally follow large , diverse birth cohort approximately 420 individual determine relationship ( 1 ) antibiotic exposure microbiome development ; ( 2 ) antibiotic exposure weight gain ; ( 3 ) microbiome development weight gain . To accomplish , study examine routine intrapartum , neonatal , infant antibiotic exposure ; use bacterial taxonomic marker gene sequencing , metatranscriptomics , metabolomics measure antibiotic-related shift microbiome taxonomic carriage , biodiversity , rate maturation infant gut microbiome ; perform comprehensive , serial anthropometric measurement assess weight gain adiposity first 24 month life .</detailed_description>
