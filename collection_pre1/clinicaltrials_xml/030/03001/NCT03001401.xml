	<brief_summary>The propose study seek compare visual acuity , tomographic outcome , biomechanical change inflammatory profile normal eye ( matched age , refraction corneal thickness ) undergo iDesign SMILE procedure . The hypothesis iDesign may deliver equivalent good clinical outcome SMILE , remove less tissue correct high order aberration .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Comparison Next Generation Laser Techniques Myopia Correction : iDesign v . SMILE</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>iDesign promise new technique treat myopia astigmatism use ocular aberration measure high resolution wavefront sensor . [ 1,2 ] Early study iDesign platform establish safety efficacy correction myopia few patient report night vision problem . [ 1,2 ] In keratoconus , iDesign also provide excellent outcome follow collagen crosslinking.3 SMILE recent technique eliminate creation flap appear achieve similar refractive outcome conventional LASIK less dryness , less inflammation faster wound heal . [ 4,5 ] SMILE corrects low order aberration . [ 4,5 ] Thus , comparative assessment iDesign SMILE necessary since iDesign potentially give good visual outcome low volume tissue removal . If low volume tissue remove , also hypothesize corneal would stable biomechanically . [ 5 ] Further , SMILE provide correction high order aberration . With inclusion high order aberration iDesign treatment plan , hypothesize short long term outcomes well iDesign SMILE .</detailed_description>
