	<brief_title>Patients With Rectal Cancer : `` Wait-and-see '' Approach</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The combination preoperative ( chemo ) radiotherapy total mesorectal excision ( TME ) show reduce risk local recurrence patient resectable adenocarcinoma rectum ( 1-6 ) . The improved local control rate come price increase risk surgical complication , include postoperative death rate 2-8 percent ( 7 , 8 ) , may reach 30 per cent 6 month age 85 year ( 9 ) , well long-term impact anorectal , urinary sexual function ( 10 , 11 ) . Patients cancer low rectum close proximity sphincter muscle , may require permanent stoma , associate high psychological morbidity . Preoperative chemoradiotherapy follow delay resection produce pathological complete response . One review phase II III study identify overall pCR rate 13.5 % , even high rate pCR observed dos radiotherapy exceed 45 Gy ( 12 ) . Certainly patient proceed radical surgery achieve pCR chemo radiation favorable long-term outcome ( 13 ) . But patient whose tumor already sterilize chemo radiotherapy need proceed radical surgery ? A number study emerge highlight rationale 'wait see ' policy patient achieve complete clinical response ( cCR ) chemo radiotherapy . The majority clinical data support approach come Brazil ( 14-20 ) . The Brazilian data suggest observation patient yield survival rate similar patient undergo radical surgery confirmation pCR ( 16 ) . More recent study United Kingdom Netherlands appear support feasibility approach ( 21 , 22 ) . To date publish prospectively collect data wait-and-see policy North American Centre .</detailed_description>
