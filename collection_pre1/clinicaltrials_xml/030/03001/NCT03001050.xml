	<detailed_description>Background rationale study : 4.5 million Patient 's seek medical care shoulder pain annually United States . 250,000 patient receive rotator cuff surgery United States annually . Those rotator cuff surgery produce societal saving $ 3.44 billion per year ; average $ 13,771.00 per patient young age 61 . In case rotator cuff tear Increases age . The Societal Economic Value Rotator Cuff Repair ( AAOS ) 2015 Rotator cuff repair result lifetime societal saving U.S. approximately $ 3.44 billion annually . Societal saving offset direct cost treatment patient young age 61 , result average net saving $ 13,771 per patient . This number significantly increase $ 77,662.00 patient young 40 year age . Common problem , 55 year-old man injure left arm . He use sling difficulty perform simple activity . 1 week later fall develops immediate pain shoulder . On examination unable move leave arm upward sideways direction without support arm . Radiographs bring show sign shoulder osteoarthritis , dislocation , fracture . Shoulder pain third common musculoskeletal reason seek medical care . Although small tear less likely propagate , large tear tend progress time eventually may become irreparable significant tendon retraction , muscle atrophy , tendon tissue quality allow repair . In 1972-Neer proposed 95 % rotator cuff injury cause mechanical compression coracoacromial arch , others argue cuff tear cause spur formation . - Type I-flat - Type II-curved - Type III-hooked Multifactorial : Extrinsic factor ; - Subacromial impingement - Glenohumeral instability - Internal impingement - Trauma ( acute/repetitive ) Intrinsic Factors ; - Tendon vascular supply - Collagen fiber abnormalities A positive painful arc test result positive external rotation resistance test result accurate find detect Rotator Cuff Disease ; whereas presence positive lag test ( external internal rotation ) result accurate diagnosis full-thickness rotator cuff tear . Differentiating full thickness tear partial tear , sensitive test belly-press test ( 56.8 % ) , specific lift-off test ( 96.95 ) . Bone microvascularization footprint play role rotator Cuff healing . The use Pinpoint may play pivotal role rotator Cuff healing , en lieu Plasma Rich platelets variable result base concentration level . 6 level randomize control trial show clinically significant difference Constant score , University California , Los Angles shoulder rating ( UCLA ) , American Shoulder Elbow Surgeons ( ASES ) score double-row single-row rotator cuff repair . Overall odds ratio ( OR ) intact rotator cuff tendon heal 1.93 patient treat double-row versus single-row repair , difference significant . A statistically significant benefit double-row repair ASES UCLA score observe subgroup tear great 3cm . The take home point ; Double row may improve structural healing : Clinical Relevance ? 9 study meta-analysis , 5 randomize prospective study ( LEVEL1 ) . Double-row rotator cuff repair technique significantly low re-tear rate , high ASES score great range motion internal rotation compare single-row repair technique . Point : Especially rotator cuff tear size &gt; 30mm , double-row technique recommend repair . This Level 4 study Cleveland Clinic show majority tear occur 6 24 week . The role potential hand hold device ass tendon quality office change rehab protocol base tendon retraction . Role study intervention : - Assessing bony vascularity footprint tendon integrity . - Current standard care : Steroid injection non-operatively treatment option . Could steroid injection affect tendon micro vascularization ? Could use Pinpoint ass tendon quality long term heal potential . - Cystic osseous resorption osteolysis . - Breakdown product ( PLLA ) cause synovitis chondrolysis . - Breakdown product ( PLLA ) may interfere healing-Complications Bioabsorbable Suture anchor shoulder . Why Medical Row Knots ? - Enhances Biology seal footprint synovial fluid . - Compared knotless medical row , good biomechanics incl . load failure , stiffness , less gap formation . - A biomechanical comparison 2 technical double-row rotator cuff fixation : importance medical row knot . Clinical Implications Surgeon 's Role ; - Choice tissue-penetrating instrument ; small penetrating device result improves characteristic stitch hold strength . - Size tissue bite ; big bite size stronger . - Most critical variable surgeon control rotator cuff repair choice stitch . Role Pinpoint : In re-tear partial-repair group , postoperative tendon preservation middle fact significantly affect Japanese Orthopaedic Assocation ( JOA ) UCLA score ( P=.014 , respectively ) . Considering patient tendon heal well clinical factor , Pinpoint may help identify tendon footprint vascularity time surgery . Goals Pinpoint : To attempt show increase vascularity may effect muscle quality , therefore improve strength function long term . Objective : - This prospective study aim obtain accurate level within range 95 % CI imaging Rotator Cuff tendon footprint . - Ensure Vascularity tendon footprint tendon restore anatomic footprint . See level Rotator Cuff bite affect vascular flow tendon . - Does tie medical row excessive tension change vascularity Rotator Cuff . - We would like see use Pinpoint system may cost effective Plasma Rich Platelet . - Decrease number re-tear rate Rotator cuff repair . Overall goal : Improve long term patient function outcome . Increase Rotator Cuff heal rate . Cost effective time efficient method Rotator Cuff evaluation arthroscopy . Procedures involve ( Research Interventions ) Patients undergo Rotator Cuff Repair : - Pre-operatively Questioners complete pre-op American Shoulder Elbow Surgeons ( ASES ) , University California Los Angeles ( UCLA ) , Disabilities arm , shoulder hand ( DASH ) , Short Form Health Survey-12 ( SF-12 ) &amp; Short Form Health Survey-36 ( SF-36 ) - Operative Collect OR information - Post-operative ASES , UCLA , DASH SF-12 &amp; SF-36 - Ultra sound 3 month , 6 month , 1 year 24 month The operative intervention proceed current standard protocol dictate described procedure . No change operative technique undertaken apart injection dye visualization camera . The idea would place Pinpoint probe within subacrominal space , check vascular status tendon , take bite tendon place pinpoint back check vascularity decrease . The Indocyanin Green dye kit use along PINPOINT system . Patients potential allergy history allergy sensitivity sodium iodide iodinate contrast agent use system , ask participate . The possible adverse reaction , anaphylaxis , Hypotension , tachycardia , dyspnea urticarial . The duration procedure increase study imaging ; could 15 30 minute .</detailed_description>
