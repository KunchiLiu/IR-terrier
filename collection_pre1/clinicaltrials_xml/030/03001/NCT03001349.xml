	<brief_summary>The goal clinical research study use 68GA-DOTATOC instead standard-of-care 111-In-pentetreotide tracer chemical PET/CT scan diagnose neuroendocrine tumor . A tracer inject participant 's bloodstream help study doctor see possible tumor .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>An Expanded Access Imaging Neuroendocrine Tumors Using 68Ga-DOTA-TOC</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Study Scans : If participant eligible take part study , participant PET/CT scan . Before PET/CT scan , participant receive 68GA-DOTATOC injection . The scan last hour . If participant 's regular doctor think PET/CT scan need , participant also receive 68GA-DOTATOC scan . Usually , perform every 4-6 month . Length Study : Participant 's active participation study participant 's last PET/CT scan . Follow-Up : Participant call study staff 24 hour participant receive 68GA-DOTATOC 30 day later . Participant ask participant participant side effect . The phone call last 5-10 minute . Participant 's medical record may review scan purpose study . This investigational study . 68GA-DOTATOC investigational PET/CT tracer . It FDA approve PET/CT tracer . Up 100 patient take part study . All enrol MD Anderson .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>1 . Patients diagnose suspected NET , require 111Inpentetreotide image clinical indication 2 . Subjects high risk NET familial predisposition , also clinical finding require radiolabeled somatostatin image 3 . Other somatostatinpositive tumor 111In pentetreotide use successfully , adult meningiomas 4 . Ability subject , Legally Authorized Representative ( LAR ) , patient deem treat physician cognitively impair questionably impaired way ability patient give inform consent questionable , understand , willingness sign , write informed consent 5 . Patients suspect neuroendocrine tumor , unknown primary NET , metastatic NET , tumor , meningioma , primary physician considers somatostatin image clinically indicate 6 . Other NET subject , whether asymptomatic symptomatic , sporadic familial , VHL MEN1 , also include . 1 . Pregnant lactating woman : Pregnant woman exclude study effect 68GaDOTATOC pregnancy know ; exception may grant expect risk outweigh benefit , clinical opinion attend physician . Pregnancy test follow MD Anderson procedure diagnostic reagent . Selfreporting used ass pregnancy status . If subject unsure status , urine serum pregnancy test perform inclusion 2 . Lactation suspend least one day follow administration 68GaDOTATOC mother , unknown potential risk adverse event nurse infant secondary administration radionuclide lactate woman 3 . Subjects contraindication use 111In pentetreotide 4 . Known severe allergy hypersensitivity oral contrast precludes administration oral contrast . 5 . Patients body weight 400 pound , BMI preclude entry bore PET/CT scanner , result probable compromise image quality CT , PET/CT MRI . 6 . Any additional medical condition , serious intercurrent illness , extenuate circumstance , opinion investigator may significantly interfere study compliance .</criteria>
