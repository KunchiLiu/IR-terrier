	<brief_title>Immediate Implants Inserted Through Open Flap , Open Flap Bone Grafting Flapless Techniques</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Background Objectives A recent systematic review investigate dimensional alveolar bone change insertion post-extraction implant report lack randomize control trial would serve scientific base building clinical guideline alveolar site treatment insertion post-extraction implant . Different study suggest insertion post-extraction implant perform fully elevate flap insert bone graft residual space implant surface alveolar socket . Other investigation report insignificant difference open flap flapless approach , whereas insertion bone graft remain controversial . The present study three-armed randomized clinical control trial conduct follow objective : 1 . Evaluation morphological alveolar bone level difference ( marginal bone loss ) post-extraction implant insert follow technique : 1 ) open flap surgery alone ; 2 ) open flap surgery bone grafting ; 3 ) flapless . 2 . Estimation effectiveness three surgical technique measurement secondary outcome intra-operatory post-operatory complication , pain discomfort , time cost . Materials Methods - This three-armed randomized control clinical trial arm belong one treatment : 1 ) open flap surgery alone ; 2 ) open flap surgery bone grafting ; 3 ) flapless . - The randomize sequence generate computer program ( STATA 13 ) statistician also conduct blind statistical analysis result . - All patient recruit prior trial commencement . They extensively inform regard intervention sign treatment consent . - Patients recruit accord follow inclusion criterion : absence systemic disease might compromise implant integration wound healing , appropriate periodontal health ( measure periodontal index ) , presence premolar indication extraction , presence adjacent teeth , absence fenestration , presence vestibular alveolar wall minimum 0.5mm thickness . Patients undergone CT scan past 5 year heavy smoker ( 20 cigarette per day ) include study . - Calculation sample size already perform experienced statistician , account minimal predict difference group 1mm ( SD 0.75mm ) marginal bone loss , alpha error 0.05 80 % power . Based calculation , total 30 patient include study . - Interventions perform accordance ethical standard suggest Helsinki Declaration ( 1975 ) . Approval Ethical Committee University Bari already obtain ( reg.nr . 4987 ) . - All surgical intervention perform experienced surgeon inform type intervention tooth extraction ( allocation concealment dark seal envelope ) . - The primary outcome marginal bone loss ( MBL ) alveolar bone dimensional change measure CT Cone Beam perform immediately implant insertion 6 month . Secondary outcome intra-and post-operative complication , pain discomfort , time cost . - Outcomes measure another clinician blind term treatment allocation . - Statistical analysis perform independent statistician . Statistical test include : One-way Anova , Bonferroni test several linear logistic regression order estimate potential predictive variable . Statistical significance set .05 . - Interruption study consider following situation : 1.preliminary observation highly significant difference technique indicate one technique highly superior ; 2. big number lose follow-up ( big consider sample size calculation ) - Patients exclude study follow case : miss follow-up hygiene control 1 3 month post-intervention , miss 6 month follow-up control , poor cooperation term domestic oral hygiene ( periodontal index measure ) , income systemic local disease might compromise outcome .</detailed_description>
