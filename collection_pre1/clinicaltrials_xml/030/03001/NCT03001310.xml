	<brief_summary>Achromatopsia recessively inherit condition characterise lack cone photoreceptor function result impairment colour vision visual acuity , central scotoma often eccentric fixation , disable hypersensitivity light ( photophobia ) involuntary eye movement ( pendular nystagmus ) . Children CNGB3-related achromatopsia profound sight impairment birth early infancy . The condition currently untreatable , real possibility gene therapy could offer significant benefit term improve sight quality life ( QOL ) , base others experience ocular gene therapy trial ) pre-clinical data demonstrate improved outcome CNGB3- related achromatopsia . Possible benefit improve cone-photoreceptor function include improve visual acuity ; improve colour perception ; relief disable photophobia . Although young individual may benefit gene supplementation therapy virtue great visual plasticity , anticipate intervention may offer benefit across range age aim define range . For reason , participant various age include ; child include acceptable safety profile establish adult .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The purpose trial determine safety efficacy subretinal administration ATIMP participants CNGB3-related achromatopsia . Since primarily safety study assessment efficacy explored nature , control group wo n't include enrol patient CNBG3 mutation . Since rare disease , small number participant ( 27 ) recruit . This study conduct two academic hospital : one UK one USA . In dose escalation phase , 18 adult participant administer one 3 different dos ATIMP cohorts 3 participant time . Based toxicity data , IDMC make recommendation dose administer next cohort 3 participant . The IDMC may recommend additional 1 2 participant give dose decide proceed . Once acceptable safety profile establish adult , 9 additional participant , may child adult , include . The IDMC agree maximum tolerate dose adult recommend administer dose child . During study participant make 13 visit study site period six nine month measure parameter safety efficacy intervention . Participants attend screen visit ensure eligibility study , three baseline visit establish reference measurement , visit undergo operation deliver normal CNGB3 gene eye eight follow-up visit within six month operation make sure operation safe measure whether improvement sight . The visit operation design ensure study able determine safety measure positive benefit . At screen visit participant ask sign consent form eligibility participate trial determine . They ask medical history , eye medication history , test pregnancy appropriate blood sample take determine genetic fault CNGB3 gene , do previously . Images retina take response eye light measure . Prior ATIMP administration , participant three baseline visit establish reference measurement . These baseline visit include test blood sample haematology , biochemistry serology , test measure various aspect visual function , image scan document retina test participant ' ability navigate maze . The baseline visit take 1 3 day depend number test schedule visit . ATIMP administration perform medical operation deliver normal gene retina . The operation involve `` keyhole '' surgery general anaesthetic remove vitreous jelly eye , injection virus vector retina . The operation last one two hour . Assessments 6 month ATIMP administration measure response participant ' eye intervention . Visits occur approximately 1 day , 3 day , 1 week , 2 week , 4 week , 6 week , 3 month 6 month operation . Participants examine visit test perform measure safety effect intervention . These include detailed test sight , photograph , scan , measure electrical response light , mobility test blood test . Each follow-up visit take 1 3 day depend number test schedule visit . Safety assess ongoing basis trial . When six month follow time point reach study , participant subsequently invite enrol separate follow-up study assess safety 60 month follow ATIMP administration . Participants current study strongly encourage join follow study part ongoing clinical review , though obligation part .</detailed_description>
