	<detailed_description>The investigator propose study specifically innovatively focus development novel positive psychology intervention adapt patient T2D . The MGH Diabetes Center MGH primary care clinic serve source subject study , patient diagnosis T2D serve potential subject . The investigator enroll 12 T2D patient , take part 16-week PP-MI health behavior intervention . In project , investigator plan follow : 1 . Test 16-week , telephone-delivered health behavior intervention utilize PP exercise systematic goal-setting brief , non-randomized , proof-of concept trial ( N=12 ) . 2 . Determine whether initial intervention feasible small cohort T2D patient . 3 . Explore potential benefit intervention outcomes interest ( e.g. , optimism , positive affect ) . Baseline information enrol participant obtained patient , care provider , electronic medical record require characterization population . This information include data regard medical history ( type 2 diabetes mellitus ) , current medical variable ( condition affect physical activity ) , medication , sociodemographic data ( age , gender , race/ethnicity , live alone ) . Participants undergo initial screen visit meet study staff person . At visit , study eligibility confirm , eligible willing participant enrol . Following enrollment , participant complete self-report measure , nurse Translational Clinical Research Center collect vital sign draw blood A1c . To ensure participant low baseline physical activity , take home wear accelerometer 1 week . Participants undergo second in-person visit confirm participant eligible complete program -- -- initiate program . During session , A1c accelerometer data review . Participants require A1c value 6.5 % 9 % , unless eligible A1c level past 6 month , case current A1c may 6 % 9.5 % . Furthermore , participant must low physical activity ( &lt; 75 minute moderate vigorous physical activity past week , measure accelerometer ) continue program . Upon confirmation eligibility , participant begin study intervention . During second in-person visit , participant receive PP-MI treatment manual . For session , PP exercise describe manual , instruction space write exercise effect . Next , MI section outline specific MI-based topic ( e.g. , pros/cons , manage slip ) facilitate physical activity goal-setting . Interventionists complete PP exercise 1 MI session 1 together participant aid engagement . Interventionists also explain/assign PP exercise 2 discuss MI-based activity goal match participant ' stage change medical recommendation ( assign activity track ) . Participants complete remain session ( 14 total ) phone next 16 week . Phone session last approximately 30 minute , PP physical activity assignment complete phone session . PP MI component deliver stepwise within session ( rather intertwine ) base experience , participant feedback , pilot work . If week miss , session skip , rather intervention complete sequentially ( participant miss week miss final session ) , exception final visit , skip Planning Future case . Participants undergo in-person follow-up assessment 16 week . At session , participant repeat self-report assessment administer baseline . Vital sign blood sample collect final in-person visit . Finally , prior assessment , participant wear accelerometer additional 7 day measure moderate vigorous physical activity . The investigator allow window 3 week , allow flexibility schedule in-person appointment Boston ( allow coordination medical visit MGH ) maintain integrity study finding .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>T2D . Eligible patient diagnose T2D , diagnosis least 1 year , confirm diabetes clinician medical record review . Consistent American Diabetes Association ( ADA ) criterion T2D , participant must HbA1c [ A1C ] least 6.5 % within last 6 month . The investigator exclude patient A1C &gt; 9 % give patient range likely extreme nonadherence and/or require ongoing treatment adjustment , increase heterogeneity sample pilot project . If patient appear otherwise eligible , A1C value within 6 month , require baseline A1C value 6.59 % . Low physical activity . The investigator define low physical activity ≤75 minutes/week MVPA ( represent ≤40 % ADA recommendation moderate great intensity aerobic physical activity total 150 minute per week ) . This cutoff allow adequate room improvement key outcome . As initial screen , investigator use modify version International Physical Activity Questionnaire ( IPAQ ) extensively used/validated medical cohort , include T2D . Patients complete modify IPAQ regard activity past week ( typical week , past 7 day atypical ) ass number minute spend perform MVPA . Patients report ≤60 minutes/week MVPA wear accelerometer 7 day confirm low physical activity . Prescribed oral glucoselowering drug choose lifestyle intervention ( diet exercise ) manage T2D . To eligible , patient must prescribe stable glucoselowering medication regimen ( stable plan control diet/exercise alone ) least 3 month anticipate adjustment . Including whose T2D manage diet exercise alone allow inclusion participant may high likelihood engagement behavioral intervention . The investigator exclude patient take insulin reduce heterogeneity T2D severity initial trial . Cognitive impairment preclude consent meaningful participation , assess use sixitem screen develop purpose . Lack phone availability . Inability read/write English . Additional medical condition ( e.g. , severe arthritis , chronic pulmonary obstructive disease , class III IV heart failure ) preclude physical activity . Enrollment mindbody program , lifestyle intervention program ( e.g. , cardiac rehabilitation ) , clinical trial .</criteria>
