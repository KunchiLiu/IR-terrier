	<brief_title>A Comparison Electromyographic Activity &amp; Glenohumeral Motion</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>To achieve study aim , 88 adult ( 44 control , 44 stiff shoulder ) age 18-65 recruit . The investigator apply protocol base current evidence effectiveness mobilization ( 4 bout 30 sec , oscillatory gr III mobilization @ 1 Hz vs. 4 bout 30 second , static gr III mobilization ) , intervention determine randomize blocked assignment . Before intervention , investigator assess level EMG activity posterior rotator cuff posterior glide , force require mobilization reach end range stretch , amount humeral head translation glenoid via US , pain pressure threshold ( PPT ) . The data collect allow investigator determine mechanism involve range motion ( ROM ) change hypoalgesia produce glenohumeral ( GH ) joint mobilization normal stiff shoulder evaluate main interaction effect : type mobilization ( static v oscillatory ) , magnitude joint translation via image ultrasound , EMG response supraspinatus infraspinatus muscle , change local central pain processing observe via PPT test . These data allow investigator evaluate whether motion improvement occur due mechanical factor ( stretch capsule observe via change translation ) , neurophysiologic factor ( change translation associate reduction EMG activity ) , . Concurrent measurement pain process nervous system ( local central mechanism ) allow evaluation whether change pain process occur follow oscillatory movement , sustain movement , . This information result improve understanding mechanism action joint mobilization , determination efficacy various mode mobilization improve joint translation , determination efficacy various mode mobilization decrease pain . Data analysis : All data analyze aggregate form use quantitative statistic . Descriptive statistic utilized demographic data include age , height , weight , gender , handedness , side intervention . Groups measure use test difference base group assignment ( normal v stiff shoulder ; sustain v oscillatory mobilization ) compare peak root mean square EMG activity , pain pressure threshold , force mobilization , amount translation measure via US well analysis interaction effect . All data analyze use intention treat model , miss data point replace use imputation via mean group . All outlier , define data point beyond 95th percentile identify outlier analysis SPSS , Winsorized minimize effect potentially spurious outlier via replacement high non-outlier obtained value group . Descriptive statistic include mean , range standard deviation assess group condition . Data assess required assumption parametric testing/ Analysis variance ( ANOVA ) include Mauchly 's test sphericity Shapiro-Wilk test normality . Data meeting required assumption assess appropriate non-parametric equivalent test . Aim 1 investigate relationship within group difference rotator cuff activity ( EMG ) posterior glide mobility mobilization force glenohumeral joint individual stiff normal shoulder base joint mobilization type . To analyze within subject main effect , interaction effect , second order interaction effect group mobilization condition DV , three-way between-between-within mixed ANOVAs use . IV : shoulder condition stiff v normal ; oscillation v static posterior glide ; time . X Repeated measure Dependent variable ( DV ) : EMG , US translation , force In presence significant three way interaction , post hoc test determine simple two way interaction effect perform use separate two way ANOVAs Univariate test utilized determine presence simple main effect . Post hoc analysis utilize pairwise comparison presence significant main effect . Bonferroni correction utilize due multiple test , comparison within simple-simple main effect consider family comparison . To investigate relationship rotator cuff activity ( EMG ) posterior glide mobility individual stiff normal shoulder , point bi-serial correlation utilized ass meaningful relationship follow variable : Mobilization condition x change EMG , US , force Group ( stiff v control ) assignment x change EMG , US , force Aim 2 investigate within group difference relationship change PPT type mobilization ( static , oscillatory ) individual stiff normal shoulder . Between group difference assess via ind . t-tests , use dichotomous independent variable ( IV ) static vs. oscillatory mobilization , DV PPT measure . Within group difference assess via paired t-tests , use dichotomous IV static vs. oscillatory mobilization , DV PPT measure .</detailed_description>
