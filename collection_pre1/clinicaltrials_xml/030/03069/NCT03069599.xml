	<brief_summary>The aim project describe differential immunologic response patient undergo situ IRE , margin accentuation IRE surgical resection primary tumor , surgical resection primary tumor . The primary hypothesis IRE induces long sustained activation cell-mediated immune system , distinct immune response surgical resection . The primary endpoint study comparison CD4+/CD8+ ratio indicator antitumor immunity longitudinally within group intervention time three group . CD4+/CD8+ ratio measure preoperatively postoperative day 1 , 7 , 42 , 180 . As secondary outcome , additional measurement take specifically characterize immune response base peripheral blood sample . Flow cytometry use quantify cell subset ( CD3+ , CD62L+ , NK cell , dendritic cell , Th1/Th2 ratio , Foxp3+ Tregs ) , ELISA use measure cytokine level ( IL-1 , IL-2 , IL-4 , IL-6 , IL-10 , TNFalpha , IFN-gamma , VEGF , TGF-beta1 , TGF-beta2 , sIL-2R , HSP70 ) , time-points primary outcome . Each group patient describe consist 10 consecutive pancreatic cancer patient . Patients age 18 old resectable , borderline resectable , locally advanced pancreatic cancer include . Patients locally advanced disease undergo 3 month preoperative chemotherapy monitor exclude metastatic disease . Main exclusion criterion cardiac conduction abnormality sign distant metastasis .</brief_summary>
