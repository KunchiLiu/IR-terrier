	<brief_title>Clarify Predictive Risk Factors Chemotherapy-induced Liver Injury</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Nasopharyngeal carcinoma ( NPC ) one common malignancy southern China , annual incidence 15 50 case per 100,000 people . NPC radiosensitive chemosensitive . Recently , many new drug include docetaxel cisplatin incorporate induction chemotherapy phase NPC . The common toxicity TP ( docetaxel cisplatin ) chemotherapy chemotherapy-induced liver injury , appropriate management toxicity help patient improve tolerance chemotherapy . However , patient n't always experience chemotherapy-induced liver injury drug . Therefore , important determine risk factor predict chemotherapy-induced liver injury . The investigator design present study clarify risk factor associate development severe hepatotoxicity therapy docetaxel cisplatin nasopharyngeal carcinoma ( NPC ) .</detailed_description>
