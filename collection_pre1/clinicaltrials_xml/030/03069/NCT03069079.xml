	<brief_title>Investigation Dental Health Children With Neutrophil Defects : A Clinical Study</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>1 . BACKGROUND Primary immunodeficiency disease ( PIDs ) group rare inherit disorder estimate affect approximately 1 2,000 child . In PIDs intrinsic defect human immune system , failure produce enough antibody fight infection , failure cellular defence infection . These condition usually manifest early life often life-threatening . Rarer , severe form PIDs present childhood serious infection often associate additional autoimmune inflammatory complication . Periodontal disease inflammatory disease gingivae ( gum ) due imbalance host response subgingival bacteria associate destruction support tissue teeth early loss dentition masticatory function . While periodontitis non-destructive partner condition , gingivitis ( reversible plaque-induced gingival inflammation ) , common , prevalence periodontitis primary dentition second decade life appear low , range 0.1 % 1 % . This prevalence increase dramatically child affect PIDs , point periodontitis consider common feature syndromic genetic condition due single gene defect affect host response , leukocyte adhesion deficiency ( LAD ) , severe congenital neutropenia , cyclic neutropenia Chediak-Higashi syndrome . Children defect neutrophil activity seem particularly susceptible develop severe periodontitis , due important defensive role neutrophil periodontopathogenic bacteria . In case , primary permanent dentition affect , devastate effect mastication , aesthetic quality life , also owe lack reliable restorative solution . Furthermore , oral disease ( particular periodontitis ) may also provide additional systemic inflammatory burden subject . This could occur since periodontal bacteria show enter systemic circulation inflame gum tissue even normal tooth brushing , find atheromatous plaque amniotic fluid pregnant woman . The treatment periodontitis involve non-specific reduction bacterial load gingival margin , achieve oral hygiene instruction non-surgical periodontal therapy ( NSPT ) . More advanced case need antibiotic , surgical treatment extraction . In child PID response treatment highly variable presence periodontitis often lead early tooth loss , add poor quality life sufferer . Incorporation periodontal screening advocate early diagnosis treatment periodontal diseases child especially child neutrophil defect , order prevent disease progression tooth loss . However , publish paper periodontitis child immunodeficiency case report familial observation review . Therefore , 's lack well-designed study investigate prevalence periodontitis oral diseases general child neutrophil defect response treatment . In particular , clear factor determine onset periodontitis subset child PID . Such factor may range composition subgingival microbiota , immunological reaction bacteria , inflammatory response periodontium . A good understanding causative factor may help early diagnosis treatment , reduce burden affect child . 2 . AIMS AND OBJECTIVES The hypothesis behind study : ) Specific microbiological host response parameter dictate severity periodontal disease associate risk early tooth loss child suffer neutrophil defect ii ) Periodontal treatment child neutrophil defect periodontitis lead improvement oral health ( reduction periodontal pocket bleed score ) , would reduce risk tooth loss potentially improve future quality life . Therefore , aim study offer specialist periodontal assessment treatment child neutrophil defect , determine impact neutrophil defect upon gingival health ass response periodontal therapy . This facilitate development novel therapeutic management pathway specific condition , determine whether need specific care protocols consequent improvement tooth retention , quality life systemic health . - The primary objective study : - To investigate presence periodontal disease response periodontal treatment child affect neutrophil defect - The secondary objective study : - To investigate presence dental diseases child affect neutrophil defect - To assess oral microbiological host response parameter child affect neutrophil defect . 3 . STUDY DESIGN 3.1 Overall study plan This exploratory longitudinal study . Fifty child affect neutrophil defect potentially affect periodontium identify subject attend Immunology Haematology clinic Great Ormond Street Hospital ( GOSH ) , follow medical examination . All child undergo dental examination qualify dentist currently complete specialist training periodontology . Children also provide sample gingival crevicular fluid ( GCF ) subgingival plaque . Following baseline , non-surgical periodontal therapy provide necessary participant followed-up re-examined 6 month treatment . 4 . STUDY POPULATION 4.1 Participant Selection Fifty child affect neutrophil defect care Great Ormond Street Hospital ( GOSH ) meeting inclusion criterion participate study . Most child attend GOSH regularly ( least 6-monthly ) review/treatment plan appointment ( see Dr Ancliff Dr Worth ) . The parents/guardians potentially suitable child initially contact letter prior attendance GOSH . Every invitation follow telephone call discus issue enquiry willingness participate . When possible , upon parent ' agreement study participation , patient could enrol undergo screen visit day routine GOSH visit ( would save extra travel patient live outside London ) . Alternatively , offer another appointment . All study visit take place GOSH . QMULwill serve sponsor coordinate centre study . . 5 . STUDY VISITS Study visit include baseline , non-surgical periodontal therapy follow-up . All visit carry Great Ormond Street Hospital . 5.1 Visit 1 ( Screening ) Informed consent Collection data clinical laboratory diagnosis , time diagnosis , previous current systemic treatment previous dental treatment Basic Periodontal Examination ( BPE ) assessment caries ( DMFT ) mucosal diseases Saliva plaque sample - Clinical photograph - Treatment plan All child find BPE score 1 ( gingival bleeding ) , 2 ( presence calculus ) , 3 4 ( presence gingival pocket ) offer possibility enter treatment phase study ( visit 2 onwards ) , provide GOSH . Children find affected periodontal disease offer possibility see GOSH visit 2 , wish . 5.2 Visit 2 ( Baseline first treatment session- ± 28 day ) Recording adverse event ( AE concomitant medication ) - Full periodontal examination include collection periodontal measurement ( dental radiograph appropriate ) - Gingival crevicular fluid ( GCF ) sample - Session tooth scaling , oral hygiene polish All child find require treatment need attend additional 1 4 treatment session GOSH detail : 5.3 Visit 3A 3D ( treatment , within 2 month visit 1 , 1 4 visit ) Update medical history , check adverse event , non-surgical periodontal therapy ( maximum 4 session ) : oral hygiene instruction supra- sub-gingival debridement . 5.4 Visit 4 ( last follow-up , 6 month last treatment visit ± 21 day ) Update medical history , check adverse event , dental examination collection periodontal measurement , perform oral hygiene instruction , sample saliva , subgingival plaque gingival crevicular fluid , tooth scale polishing ( need ) . 5.5 Medical dental history A complete medical dental history obtain screening confirm baseline visit . Information previous medical test status current treatment obtain treat GOSH physician . The history include demographic background information , ethnicity , systemic dental status information . 5.6 Concomitant medication All concomitant medication record throughout study . 5.7 Periodontal examination At screen visit , Basic Periodontal Examination ( BPE ) perform , consist gentle probe teeth gum index teeth ( UR6 , UR1 , UL6 , LL6 , LL1 LR6 URd , URc , ULd , LLD , LLc , LRd ) identify presence gum disease . A number 0 ( health ) 4 ( gingival pocket &gt; 5mm ) record quadrant . The dmft/ DMFT ( decay miss fill teeth ) index use record caries experience . Mucosal status investigate record presence ulcer , blister , white patch , speckle area mass . Saliva sample plaque sample collect . At baseline visit , calibrate dental examiner perform detailed assessment , consist collection full-mouth measurement probe pocket depth ( PPD ) , clinical attachment level ( CAL ) , gingival bleed probe gingival crevicular fluid sample assessment plaque level ( simplify visible biofilm index ) . 5.8 Dental sample A series sample collect patient ' oral cavity ( sample saliva , GCF subgingival plaque biofilm ) . GCF take gentle insertion 4 paper-strips gingival crevice mesio-buccal aspect 4 teeth ( 3 first molars 1 incisor ) . Subgingival plaque collect examiner follow gentle insertion curette base 3 first molar 1 first incisor site ( one quadrant ) . In case absence permanent molar , sample collect second deciduous molar . The 4 subgingival sample pool together . 5.9 Definition periodontal disease Following periodontal examination , child diagnose : - Healthy : attachment loss ( measured CAL &gt; 3mm CAL &gt; 3mm &lt; 2 non-adjacent teeth ) no/minimal gingival inflammation ( measure &lt; 15 site bleed probe ) - Gingivitis : attachment loss ( measured CAL &gt; 3mm CAL &gt; 3mm &lt; 2 non-adjacent teeth ) presence gingival inflammation ( ≥15 site bleed probe ) - Periodontitis : attachment loss ( measured CAL &gt; 3mm ≥2 non-adjacent teeth ) 5.10 Dental radiograph If BPE code 3 detect , bite-wings long cone parallel periapical radiograph ( indicated BPE 4 ) use Rinn holder take detect marginal bone level , accord clinical need . The distance coronal apical bone level cemento-enamel junction analyse describe previously , also take account age patient , tooth eruption stage presence primary , mixed permanent dentition . Radiographs digitized future analysis use image-analysis software . 5.11 Non-surgical periodontal treatment All child offer oral hygiene tooth scale polish session . For child affected periodontal disease , subgingival debridement also perform accord need , aim disrupt subgingival biofilm responsible onset progression periodontal pathology . This accompanied , appropriate , use local anaesthesia adjunctive antimicrobial ( systemic locally apply subgingivally ) , accord clinical presentation child 's medical condition . In addition , require , nitrous oxide sedation ( NOS ) could use treatment . NOS safe widely-used technique paediatric dentistry . It administer inhalation via nasal mask use reduce dental anxiety along behaviour management technique . There contra-indications . It suitable patient nasal congestion severe dental anxiety . NOS conduct follow guideline Standards Conscious Sedation Provision Dental Care appropriate clinical consent form obtain use . Accurate supra- sub-gingival removal calculus dental plaque perform ultrasonic and/or manual instrument . The necessary sub-gingival debridement perform 1 4 visit ( either full mouth treatment , half-mouth treatment quadrant-wise treatment ) depend patient preference practical consideration , use manual ( Gracey curettes , Hu-Friedy ) ultrasonic device ( EMS ) . Caries treat necessary ( share care general dental practitioner / community dental service ) . Children mucosal lesion require treatment give letter GDP suggest referral collaborate expert Oral Medicine ( Prof. Stephen Porter ) . 6 . Missing data The inclusion young subject present study introduces risk miss data , owe difficulty data sample collection child ( due unwillingness examine sample ) . The Investigators endeavor complete data sample collection minimal discomfort subject . However , dental periodontal examination achievable , subject exit study . Once main variable outcome study ( presence periodontal disease mean collection BPE ) record , subject exclude analysis , even data collect . For example , child tolerate periodontal probing ( hence collection BPE ) refuse provide plaque sample , he/she still include study last visit . The final study analyse report/publications take account possible miss data reason collect . 5.7 Repeatability Prior initiation study , designate examiner participate training repeatability exercise . For repeatability exercise , examiner score 5 subject PPD REC perform repeat examination subject day least 15 minute separation . Upon completion measurement , intra-examiner repeatability PPD measurement assess . The reproducibility examiner test use Bland-Altman approach calculate Lin 's concordance correlation coefficient . A co-efficient repeatability less ± 2 mm 95 % case consider acceptable . 5.8 Laboratory analysis Samples initially store -70° -80° analysis . Microbiological analysis involve next generation sequence 16S rRNA metagenome QMUL . GCF sample elute undergo analysis inflammatory marker describe . 9 . PARTICIPANTS ' COMPLETION AND WITHDRAWAL 9.1Reasons withdrawal Participants inform right withdraw study time reason , without prejudice medical care . The investigator also right withdraw participant study follow reason : - Occurrence unacceptable adverse event/illness - Participant/parent/guardian request - Protocol violation - Administrative reason - Failure return follow-up - General specific change Participant 's condition unacceptable treatment judgment investigator 9.2 Completion/Withdrawal Procedures At time withdrawal , study procedure outline end study visit conclude . The primary reason participant 's withdrawal study record CRF . 10 . ADVERSE EVENT REPORTING 7.1 Adverse Events ( AEs ) An adverse event include noxious , pathological unintended change anatomical , physiological metabolic function indicate physical sign , symptom and/or laboratory change occur phase clinical study , whether associate study . This include exacerbation pre-existing condition event , inter-current illness , drug interaction significant worsen disease study . For adverse event , investigator must pursue obtain information adequate determine outcome adverse event ass whether meet criteria classification serious adverse event require immediate notification sponsor designate representative . For adverse event , sufficient information obtain investigator determine causality adverse event . Clinically significant symptom follow NSPT include outside normally accepted range ( judged clinician ) . This would include : - Excessive progressively increase pain discomfort - Excessive swell - Signs infection ( e.g . suppuration ) - Excessive bleeding Moreover shall record participant take drug result adverse event . 7.2 Serious Adverse Events definition A serious adverse event serious adverse drug reaction untoward medical occurrence dose : - result death - life-threatening ( immediate risk death ) - require participant hospitalization prolongation exist hospitalization - result persistent significant disability/incapacity - result congenital anomaly/birth defect . Medical scientific judgment exercise determine whether event important medical event . An important medical event may immediately life-threatening and/or result death hospitalization . However , determine event may jeopardize participant may require intervention prevent one outcomes listed definition , important medical event report serious . 7.3 Reporting Serious Adverse Events Because need report health authority suspect unexpected serious adverse reaction ( SUSARs ) timely manner , vitally important investigator report immediately adverse event would consider serious . Any serious adverse event ( include death ) due cause , occur course clinical study , whether related study , must report immediately Principal Investigator designee . 7.4 Reporting period The nature individual adverse event , date time onset , duration , severity relationship treatment corrective treatment must establish investigator record CRF . Adverse event record follow sign first consent form last study visit . Any serious adverse event occur time report period must promptly report causal relationship investigational product suspect SUSARs follow resolution . 8 STATISTICAL PROCEDURES 6.1 Sample size estimation A convenience sample 50 child ( base current estimation number child neutrophil defect see yearly GOSH ) propose study , since formal power calculation could perform owe lack similar study literature . However , hypothesise subgingival presence bacterium A.actinomycetemcomitans baseline could discriminate responder non-responders periodontal treatment ( difference 0.5mm ± 0.5 mm mean clinical attachment gain ) , 41 child ( include 20 % drop-outs ) undergo periodontal therapy would give 80 % power prove disprove hypothesis . 6.2 Statistical analysis All data derive study anonymised enter dedicated database . The initial plan analysis describe prevalence periodontal disease study cohort ( divide medical diagnosis ) . Appropriate summary statistic determine separately affect non-affected subject . Differences demographic systemic parameter ( diagnosis , current treatment ) affect non-affected subject assess two-sample t-test Mann-Whitney test appropriate . Explorative logistic regression analysis perform detect effect microbiological inflammatory parameter ( e.g . presence periodontopathogenic bacterium A.actinomycetemcomitans cytokine concentration GCF ) group , take account many child may long-term antimicrobial therapy . Response therapy assess compare clinical periodontal parameter baseline follow-ups random effect analysis take time point repeat measure .
