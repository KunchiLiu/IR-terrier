	<brief_title>Autologous Bone Marrow-Derived Stem Cell Transplantation Patients With Premature Ovarian Failure ( POF )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Premature ovarian failure ( POF ) characterize hypergonadotropic ovarian failure mostly prevalent age 40 . It astonishingly frequent affect around 1 % woman age 40 . The clinical finding include amenorrhea abnormally high level luteinizing ( LH ) follicle stimulate hormone ( FSH ) . The etiology POF unidentified majority case . It occur due combination genetics , immunological disease , environmental factor . POF characterize lack secondary follicle , arrest folliculogenesis , decrease estrogen level , female infertility . Currently , available therapeutic intervention verify effective retrieving fertility patient POF . Several trial ovarian stimulation typically ineffective . Consequently , diagnosis POF cause great physical emotional distress among patient . Hence , serious need develop innovative treatment plan POF . The late research show reduce ovarian reserve cause age niche rather defect germ cell line . Current scientific evidence suggest bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cell ( BMSCs ) could repair injured tissue hold great promise treat many disease include male female infertility . The uniqueness study demonstrate transplantation purify specific population autologous bone marrow derive stem cell mesenchymal stem cell ( BMSCs ) patient POF without vitro expansion culture , minimal manipulation . Stem cell withdrawn transplant back patient day procedure , thus present high safety efficacy parameter .</detailed_description>
