	<brief_summary>Postpartum hemorrhage ( PPH ) occur one ten deliveries worldwide lead cause maternal morbidity mortality . In develop country 30 % woman develop PPH access number treatment readily available . Interestingly , rate PPH consequently maternal morbidity increase significantly even developed nation , Canada , past decade . This rate also increase amongst parturients Ontario . Unfortunately , effective preventative treatment exist . Antifibrinolytic drug routinely use reduce bleed requirement blood transfusion wide range hemorrhagic condition . The commonly use antifibrinolytic drug tranexamic acid ( TXA ) . TXA safe , affordable , side effect . The World Health Organization recommend TXA use reduce blood loss several condition , include patient establish PPH refractory conventional therapy.However , little know prophylactic use TXA prevent PPH .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Use TXA Prevent Postpartum Hemorrhage</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This pragmatic , singlecentered , doubleblinded , randomized-controlled pilot trial ass feasibility administer prophylactic dose TXA prevent onset PPH amongst parturients undergoing cesarean section spontaneous vaginal delivery . Our primary outcome determine proportion patient receive investigational product successfully . Our secondary outcome include 1 ) additional feasibility endpoints余 2 ) safety endpoint 3 ) various clinical endpoint . These clinical endpoint include ) incidence PPH ( severe PPH ) 余 b ) total number transfusions余 c ) use uterotonic drugs余 ) hospital length stay . The investigator anticipate TXA safely administer parturients prior delivery . The investigator also believe effective prophylactic therapy PPH reduce severity associate morbidity . Results trial use design conduct large multicentered trial , power assess outcomes interest . Furthermore , prophylactic use TXA PPH could improve outcome parturients Ontario worldwide effective management PPH remain ongoing challenge .</detailed_description>
