	<detailed_description>Patients pulmonary arterial hypertension ( PAH ) severely reduce exercise capacity reduce quality life . At diagnosis , PAH patient New York Heart Association ( NYHA ) functional class III symptom fatigue shortness breath less ordinary activity . Physical activity confers multiple benefit relevant PAH pathophysiology include improvement endothelial function , energy metabolism , right ventricular ( RV ) function . Increasing physical activity highly efficacious PAH , result six-minute walk distance ( 6MWD ) improvement exceeds effect medication . The goal proposal adapt test feasibility mHealth intervention increase physical activity geographically diverse PAH population . In secondary aim , assess conventional PAH trial outcome ( 6MWD , quality life ) physiologic mechanism increase activity may improve exercise capacity . The investigator hypothesize mHealth intervention feasible increase physical activity subject PAH . This study propose randomize trial unblinded step track smart text track 12 week . Participants wear display-free triaxial accelerometer , continuously transmit data compatible smartphone ( own 75 % PAH population ) . Efficacy endpoint select mirror FDA criterion drug approval PAH . The follow aim test : Aim 1 : To test feasibility mHealth intervention increase step count patient PAH . Fifty PAH patient randomize mHealth intervention usual activity 12 week . The primary endpoint daily step count Week 12 . Secondary endpoint assess step target achievement , daily activity time , aerobic time . The fidelity data collection text transmission also assess . Aim 2 : To examine effect mHealth intervention exercise capacity quality life . Participants complete six minute walk test emPHasis-10 questionnaire baseline 12 week . The primary endpoint six minute walk distance . Secondary endpoint emPHasis-10 quality life scale score , Borg dyspnea score , rest heart rate . Aim 3 : To examine effect mHealth intervention mechanism improve exercise capacity . Subjects undergo echocardiography , blood draw , body composition assessment . The primary endpoint RV longitudinal strain . Secondary endpoint homeostatic model assessment insulin resistance , lean muscle fat mass , B-type natriuretic peptide .</detailed_description>
