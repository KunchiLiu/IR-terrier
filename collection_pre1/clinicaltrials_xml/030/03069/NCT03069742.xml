	<detailed_description>Breast cancer common malignancy among woman U.S. primary prevention disease major public health issue . The U.S. Preventive Services Task Force professional organization recommend clinician discuss chemoprevention high-risk woman . Breast cancer chemoprevention anti-estrogens , tamoxifen , raloxifene , exemestane , anastrozole , under-utilized , despite several randomized control trial demonstrate 40-65 % decrease breast cancer incidence among high-risk woman . Compounding underutilization fact large proportion woman may unaware high-risk status due investigator ' inability adequately screen primary care set . Further research need determine knowledge breast cancer , actual/perceived risk , risks/benefits chemoprevention best communicate woman order promote breast cancer prevention strategy . The investigator hypothesize combine patient-centered decision aid physician-centered decision support tool integrate clinic workflow improve accuracy breast cancer risk perception , facilitate referral specialize risk counseling , increase chemoprevention uptake . We anticipate BNAV tool facilitate referral breast clinic primary care provider ( PCPs ) RealRisks decision aid prime high-risk woman seek referral . The primary endpoint uptake selective estrogen receptor modulator ( SERM ) Aromatase inhibitor ( AI ) breast cancer chemoprevention 6 month ( next primary care appointment ) active arm compare usual care .</detailed_description>
