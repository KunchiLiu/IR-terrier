	<brief_summary>Total hip replacement ( THR ) common major surgical procedure perform elderly patient significant comorbidities . Optimizing patient 's anesthetic analgesic modality could play significant role minimize risk adverse event perioperative period potentially shorten time discharge recovery . Establishing safe effective post-operative analgesic plan central importance successful THR anesthesia care . The application ultrasound visualization improve efficacy fascia iliaca compartment block ( FICB ) . However , ultrasound-guided suprainguinal FICB yet evaluate clinically large trial method provide post-operative analgesia follow THR . The investigator hypothesize perform suprainguinal fascia iliaca block ultrasound , possible achieve superior reliable analgesia first 24 hour without block .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>The Efficacy Ultrasound-guided Suprainguinal Fascia Iliaca Compartment Block Early Post-operative Analgesia After Total Hip Arthroplasty</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The search optimal pain treatment strategy work progress . As technique technology evolve approach best analgesic regimen would minimize unwanted side effect potential risk importantly improve patient satisfaction . The literature support use peripheral nerve block analgesia well improve functional outcome total knee arthroplasty . The addition peripheral nerve block THR controversial , effective nerve block , posterior approach lumbar plexus , advanced regional technique potential serious complication . The application ultrasound visualization improve efficacy infrainguinal fascia iliaca block . However , ultrasound guide suprainguinal fascia iliaca block yet evaluate clinically large trial method provide post-operative analgesia follow primary hip arthroplasty . The investigator hypothesize perform suprainguinal fascia iliaca block ultrasound , possible achieve superior reliable analgesia obtain use landmark `` 2-pop '' technique infrainguinal block . The aim study ass whether ultrasound guide suprainguinal fascia iliaca block provide superior early postoperative analgesia patient undergoing primary hip arthroplasty , minimize pain immediately resolution spinal anesthetic . The investigator propose perform first triple-blinded RCT examine early analgesic efficacy ultrasound-guided suprainguinal FICB THR .</detailed_description>
