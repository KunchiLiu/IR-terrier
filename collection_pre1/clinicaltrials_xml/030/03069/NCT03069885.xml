	<detailed_description>Incisional negative pressure wound therapy ( Prevena™ ) vs. conventional post-operative dressing immediate breast reconstruction ; randomize control clinical trial . • Introduction Over last 60 year , steady rise incidence breast cancer Denmark . Due Danish breast cancer screen program increase use genetic counseling , patient diagnose breast cancer , pre-cursors hereof , increase lifetime risk breast cancer earlier age previously . In woman high estimate risk breast cancer , current study indicate reduce lifetime risk cancer , thereby increase survival , undergo risk reduce mastectomy . Therefore , Danish woman may choose undergo risk reduce mastectomy , estimate lifetime risk breast cancer 30 % . At Department Plastic Breast Surgery , Aarhus University Hospital , Denmark , rise number immediate breast reconstruction perform , currently count approximately 200 per year . This increase partly due increase number prophylactic risk reduce mastectomy , well increase number woman choose immediate breast reconstruction diagnose Ductal Carcinoma In-Situ ( DCIS ) . As woman need undergo adjuvant cancer therapy breast surgery , fast recovery essential order adjuvant therapy delay . Women undergo surgery young age , presumably live long time , possible complication immediate breast reconstruction . Therefore , good result first surgery fast rehabilitation , essential importance woman 's recovery quality life . The immediate breast reconstruction , hold several benefit compare mastectomy subsequent delay breast reconstruction . Benefits rapid return work , low complication rate , good aesthetic outcome , need one surgery , surgery free complication . The complication rate immediate breast reconstruction , report range 3,9 % 14,8 % , frequent complication skin necrosis , surgical site infection ( SSI ) , implant loss haematoma/seroma . Incisional negative pressure wound therapy ( iNPWT ) , new approach surgical site closure use negative pressure wound therapy ( NPWT ) . Recently , PrevenaTM approve iNPWT-system applied end surgery , still sterile environment . PrevenaTM consist sponge foam bactericidal silver lining , dress adherent film , connect vacuum device , produce vacuum 125 mm Hg . The PrevenaTM foam dress place suture line , recommend kept place continuous period last 2 7 day . iNPWT base principle behind NPWT , know vacuum assist closure ( V.A.C . ) , well described literature . NPWT show efficient way treat chronic wound , increase blood flow formation granulation tissue , stimulate cell proliferation angiogenesis , decrease bacterial count , reduce oedema , improve wound closure rate , collagen organization wound maturation animal- clinical-studies . Furthermore , recently iNPWT show promising result lower post-operative complication , low rate surgical site infection , low incidence wound dehiscence , low loss split thickness skin graft . In experimental porcine setup , indication increase lymph clearance low production seroma/hematoma show use iNPWT . Additionally , biomechanical analysis , Wilkes et al . find evidence reduce lateral stress wound , theory , could lead faster closure improve scar aesthetic . Overall , iNPWT show reduce several frequent complication may occur follow immediate breast reconstruction . However , immediate breast reconstructive setting , iNPWT yet study , breast surgery general , limited data use NPWT iNPWT . The current study aim investigate whether PrevenaTM provide superior post-operative wound treatment , compare conventional treatment , woman undergo prophylactic therapeutic mastectomy immediate breast reconstruction . • Hypothesis iNPWT , administrate PrevenaTM , reduce post-operative complication patient undergo immediate breast reconstruction , compare conventional post-operative dressing . • Aim The aim current study evaluate whether iNPWT provide superior wound treatment patient undergo immediate breast reconstruction , compare treatment conventional post-operative dressing . The result study possibly help minimize complication rate increase patient satisfaction , find optimal wound treatment immediate breast reconstruction thereby contribute faster recovery , woman undergo procedure . • Methods The project conduct randomize control trial . Patients include study randomize either conventional post-operative dressing PrevenaTM iNPWT treatment . Patients allocate 1:1 ratio , 30 patient treat PrevenaTM 30 patient treated conventional post-operative dressing . - Study population 60 patient admit immediate breast reconstruction Department Plastic Surgery , Aarhus University Hospital , upon inform consent offer participation prospective , randomize study use two type post-operation dress breast reconstruction surgery - Risks , side effect disadvantage As surgery , risk wound infection , blood clot alter sensation operate area . This lead antibiotic treatment , appropriate , second surgery stop bleeding remove damage tissue . These risk , however , associate breast reconstruction , associate participate research project . PrevenaTM approve use internationally post-operative dressing since 2010 . PrevenaTM well describe medical literature , achieve good result compare conventional post-operative dressing , show few , amount complication . The risk patient choose participate project thus solely related breast reconstruction , participation research project . • Economics Initiators project Department Plastic Brest Surgery , Aarhus University Hospital . All cost investigate post-surgical wound treatment ( PrevenaTM conventional post-operative treatment ) hold Department Plastic Brest Surgery , Aarhus University Hospital . Participating patient give reimbursement . Patients may , however , apply reimbursement cover document travel expense , regard regulation Central Denmark Region . The salary scientific personnel , cost material conference seek covered external funding private and/or governmental fund . Funding solely seek foundation scholarship , benefactor financial interest outcome study . Furthermore , fund sought source , research project remain independent contributor . • Publication Positive , negative , well inconclusive result expect published peer-reviewed international journal interest field . Furthermore , result expect presented national international conference plastic reconstructive surgery . • Ethical consideration It expect number woman seek immediate breast reconstruction increase . The propose study aid find optimal wound dress follow surgery . Conducting study help bring complication rate type surgery utmost importance , individual patient undergo surgery socio-economic setting . All patient invite participate study evaluate experienced breast plastic surgeon best suit immediate breast reconstruction implant . PrevenaTM , iNPWT , show good result previous study type surgery , show none minor complication . The general treatment , use steri strip , use many year primary choice . As investigator expect few amount complication use PrevenaTM , predictable disadvantage individual patient regard participate study . The patient ' privacy , physical mental integrity Danish law concern process personal data respect . Furthermore , research project carry accordance Helsinki Declaration II . The project approve Central Denmark Regional Committee Health Research Ethics , see appendix 2 ( Danish ) register Central Denmark Regions joint application Danish Data Protection Agency , see Appendix 3 ( Danish ) . • Perspectives The result current study elucidate iNPWT aid wound heal immediate breast reconstruction , would lead few patient experience delay adjuvant therapy . Furthermore , result aesthetic satisfaction elucidate iNPWT provide patient well self-reported aesthetic result . Faster healing could potentially result short hospital stay . At Department Plastic Breast Surgery , Aarhus University Hospital , approximate cost per hospitalization day 4000 Danish krone ( DKK ) . With price 975 DKK. , PrevenaTM-device could potential economical benefit , average reduction hospitalization time single day . Finally , potential cost saving few post-operative complication , hold consideration . All , result current study may provide increase number woman undergo immediate breast reconstruction short hospital stay , good breast reconstructive result faster adjuvant therapy .</detailed_description>
