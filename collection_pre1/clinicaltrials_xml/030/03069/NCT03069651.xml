	<brief_summary>Cystic fibrosis ( CF ) common fatal inherited condition Caucasians , cause recurrent chest infection ( pulmonary exacerbation ) . People CF experience pulmonary exacerbation often require 14day course intravenous antibiotic treatment either deliver hospital community . Patients admit hospital see regularly member CF multidisciplinary team ( MDT ) , include doctor , nurse , dietician physiotherapist . This allow patient ' progress closely monitor also give patient opportunity discuss concern question . In contrast , patient receive IV antibiotic community see MDT begin end 14 day course IV antibiotic . Although CF nurse often visit patient 12 occasion course treatment , patient routinely reassess rest MDT . There therefore less opportunity MDT adjust patient ' treatment patient communicate MDT . We therefore aim study whether patient receive IV antibiotic community benefit monitoring oxygen saturation lung function , well take part twice-weekly videoconferences MDT ( 'virtual care ' ) . We expect enable MDT ass patient ' progress closely allow patient communicate MDT easily . We assess whether improves patient ' experience care whether translates improvement health economic outcome . One hundred subject recruit 12month period , 50 subject allocate 'virtual care ' 50 subject allocate 'routine care ' . Subjects receive 'routine care ' receive usual clinical care . The research team well place perform study part large CF centre excellent record clinical research .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Virtual Care CF ( VIRTUAL-CF ) Study</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Study design Subjects recruit randomly allocate 1:1 ratio , mean sealed envelope , receive either 'virtual care ' 'routine care ' 14day course communitydeliveredIV antibiotic . Subjects randomly allocate receive 'virtual care ' show use oximeter spirometer , well videoconferencing software . 'Virtual care ' subject ask perform lung function test ( use spirometer ) record oxygen saturation ( use oximeter ) twice weekly videoconference CF team . Times date videoconference arrange time convenient patient . Subjects able videoconference use internetenabled device ( laptop , tablet , mobile phone ) available patient 's use , device provide part study . The videoconferencing software use study Webex , widely use within NHS videoconferencing patient data fully encrypt . Subjects group ( 'virtual care ' 'routine care ' ) offer home visit CF nurse require usual appointment make outpatient clinic immediately course intravenous antibiotic finish usual . Both cohort ( 'virtual care ' 'routine care ' ) ask complete CFQR ( validate disease-specific health relate quality life questionnaire ) begin end course IV antibiotic . Subjects group also ask complete satisfaction questionnaire end course antibiotic . Patients receive 'virtual care ' specifically ask ease use oxygen saturation spirometer equipment , well videoconferencing system . Data regard participant ' lung function , nutritional status medication record clinic visit cohort . Subjects cohorts also ask record cost relate care throughout course treatment ( e.g . travel , park ) . The researcher record cost associate care participant ( cost nursing visit staff time ) cost conduct study ( e.g . cost oxygen saturation monitor , spirometer videoconferencing equipment ) . The primary outcome health-related quality life ( measure CFQR ) subject receive 'virtual care ' compare subject receive 'routine care ' . Our null hypothesis significant difference CFQR subject receive 'virtual care ' compare subject receive 'routine care ' . Secondary outcome : patient satisfaction care , day intravenous antibiotic , lung function weight subject receive 'virtual care ' compare subject receive 'routine care ' . A health economic analysis conduct determine whether 'virtual care ' value money NHS patient perspective .</detailed_description>
