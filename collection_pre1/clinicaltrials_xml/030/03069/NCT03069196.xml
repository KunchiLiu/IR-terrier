	<brief_summary>Due early diagnosis ( &lt; 20yrs age ) Type 1 Diabetes , patient face long duration disease great glycemic exposure make vulnerable towards chronic complication . The aim study investigate prevalence incidence micro macro-vascular , pulmonary complication pattern growth failure approximately 500 Type 1 Diabetes patient enrol Diabetes Unit , King Edward Memorial Hospital Research Centre . Then follow 100 participant 15 year age baseline do 2 year document incidence progression complication . This contribute assess public health burden complication Type 1 Diabetes . Factors associate prevalence complication investigate . This risk factor analysis could aid modify current prevention treatment recommendation complication . Results study could modify current clinical practice .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>BACKGROUND &amp; RATIONALE OF THE STUDY : Type 1 Diabetes ( T1D ) characterize progressive destruction insulin secrete pancreatic β-cells . The common mechanism involve autoimmunity component β-cells . As per International Diabetes Federation report 2013 , India house 67,700 child ( &lt; 15yrs ) T1D . It also state approximate figure 10,900 newly diagnose T1D child ( &lt; 15yrs ) per year . India account high number child T1D South East Asian Region . Karnataka Diabetes Registry T1D patient ( 1995 2008 ) report incidence 3.8per 100,000 person India le compare Europe Western country . Same study also report huge gap international standard care practice India majority T1D patient n't attain glycemic target . Despite unfavorable statistic , T1D receive adequate attention term clinical epidemiological research , achieve standard practice train Medical practitioner . Many time , also quote `` Poor Cousin Type 2 Diabetes '' . A salient feature T1D early onset diagnosis ( &lt; 20yrs age ) compare type 2 diabetes . Consequently patient face long duration disease great glycemic exposure time reach productive age suffer chronic complication broadly classify : 1 . Microvascular ( retinopathy , neuropathy , nephropathy ) 2 . Macrovascular [ coronary artery disease ( CAD ) , cerebrovascular disease ( CVD ) , peripheral vascular disease ( PVD ) ] . These complication contribute poor quality , substantial morbidity premature mortality prime year life premature death T1D patient . Limited study available India micro macro-vascular complication T1D . Previous study detect atherosclerotic process accelerate T1D population western study demonstrate premature thicken arterial Intima Media Thickness ( IMT ) within short disease duration . Schuyler et al 1976 first time suggest pulmonary complication among T1D . Since limited attention give lung target organ diabetes even lung large vascular network . Studies report peripheral airway dysfunction restrictive impairment lung function even absence smoking , allergies cause airflow destruction among T1D patient . Screening pulmonary complication among patient T1D currently include routine clinical setting . Growth parameter like stand height , weight important indicator child 's overall health T1D patient increase risk develop growth failure . This due role insulin main regulator Growth Hormone/Insulin Growth Factors ( GH/IGF ) axis presence portal insulin insufficiency among T1D patient . A recent study Pune report compromised growth diabetic child compare matched control . Impaired pre-pubertal pubertal growth child adolescent report many study . Factors like gender , age diagnosis , puberty , metabolic control , insulin regime affect growth . Bonfig et al 2012 observe negative association degree metabolic control impaired growth . Risk factor complication T1D study Western population . Most report duration disease , hyperglycemia , hypertension dyslipidemia predictor micro macro-vascular complication . But surprisingly `` 50-yr Medalist study '' find association glycemic control prevalence micro-vascular complication . Research Gap : The public health burden T1D increase India ignore . Studies assess long-term complication T1D India limit . They relatively small sample size , cross-sectional retrospective design . Incidence progression complication report India.Prevalence progression pulmonary complication among T1D patient study . Growth data T1D patient also limit benefit study . Aims Objectives : Aim : This thesis investigate prevalence ; incidence progression micro-vascular , macro-vascular , pulmonary complication growth failure among T1D patient clinic setting ( specialty Diabetes Unit ) . 1 . OBJECTIVE 1 : To determine prevalence long-term complication among T1D patient . 2 . OBJECTIVE 2 : To determine impact factor like age , socio-economic status , body mass index ( BMI ) , body fat ( adiposity ) , duration disease glycemic control prevalence complication . 3 . OBJECTIVE 3 : To document clinical progression complication duration 2 year .</detailed_description>
