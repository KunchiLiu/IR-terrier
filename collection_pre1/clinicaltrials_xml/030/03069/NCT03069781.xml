	<brief_summary>The maintenance skeletal muscle mass function critical healthy age . Muscle loss disuse , term muscle disuse muscle atrophy , lead impaired functional capacity , onset insulin resistance , well heighten risk morbidity mortality . With advance age chronic wasting muscle . This especially true woman , rapid rate decline muscle mass great anabolic resistance experience around time menopause , despite high protein synthesis rate . As woman longer life expectancy , particularly venerable age-related frailty morbidity . Skeletal muscle protein turnover serve maintain optimal function protein also provide plasticity tissue alter demand increase load unloading muscle . Reduced period physical activity also similar , albeit milder , impact skeletal muscle , people likely experience multiple bout skeletal muscle disuse lifetime , particularly old adult woman , fail fully recover . Thus , muscle disuse atrophy significant continue problem reclamation lose muscle mass , strength/function , potentially metabolic health ( particularly insulin-induced glucose disposal ) , follow disuse oftentimes incomplete may exacerbate menopause . Previous evidence demonstrate loss muscle mass less pronounced post-menopausal woman receive hormone replacement therapy . Skeletal muscle estrogen-β-receptors cell membrane , cytoplasm nuclear membrane , therefore direct mechanistic link low estrogen level decrease MPS . Interestingly , despite high rate protein synthesis , old woman still lose muscle mass advance age . It suggest negative muscle protein balance due enhance rate MPB . Insulin potent inhibitor MPB estrogen show enhance insulin sensitivity skeletal muscle . However , knowledge , study examine efficacy estrogen supplementation attenuate loss skeletal muscle mass function period disuse . The finding investigation may yield critical data wish combat skeletal muscle disuse atrophy , particularly menopause .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>The Effects 17β-estradiol Skeletal Muscle</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Design detailed description methodology This parallel-group randomized control trial , blind 17β-estradiol ( n=10 ) placebo ( n=10 ) supplement administer every day 10 day . Twelve healthy young men ( age : 18-25yrs ; BMI : 22-33 kg/m2 ) recruit participate study . During phone e-mail conversation explain purpose experimental design study address question participant might ( see telephone email script ) . Participants visit laboratory screen assess whether eligible participate study . During screen first explain experimental design obtain write informed consent . A medical questionnaire complete participant assess general health use medication . Body height mass measure baseline characteristic participant . Participants request fill 3-d dietary record ass habitual energy protein intake . Participants randomly assign 17β-estradiol ( n=10 ) placebo ( n=10 ) supplementation group . Randomization perform use computerized list randomizer ( http : //www.random.org/lists/ ) , participant sequentially allocate condition accord randomized list . The experimental trial compose 10 day 17β-estradiol ( Estrace , Acerus Pharmaceuticals Corporation , Mississauga , ON , Canada placebo ( 400 mg/day Polycose , Abbott Laboratories , St. Laurent , QC , Canada ) supplementation , include 3 day pre-immobilization , 7 day single leg immobilization . Three day prior immobilization ( t=-3 ) blood sample obtain muscle strength assess daily 17β-estradiol placebo supplementation initiate . Participants consume 1mg/day 3-days 3mg/day 7-days Estrace 400 mg/day Polycose 7-days . The estrogen placebo bottle cod ensure complete blind researcher participant . Additional blood sample obtain assess compliance participant supplementation . In addition , t=-3 saliva sample obtain ingest 150 mL deuterium-labeled water ( D2O ) . Daily saliva sample continued end experimental trial ass precursor pool enrichment . Dietary intake control 10-days ( include 3 prior immobilization 7 immobilization ) provide energy balance diet contain 1 weight per day equally distribute breakfast , lunch , dinner ( 15 ) . Participants instruct refrain vigorous-intensity physical activity ( run , fast cycling , competitive sport , carry heavy load , etc . ) refrain alcohol consumption 3 prior 7-day single leg immobilization . Daily activity monitor SenseWear Armband , subject require wear t=-3 end experimental trial . Participants one leg immobilize mean knee bracing ( http : //www.breg.com/products/knee-bracing/post-op ) thus contralateral limb act internal control . The leg immobilized chosen random counterbalance manner result equal number participant weaker strong legs immobilize . The brace ( http : //www.breg.com/products/knee-bracing/post-op ) wear fix flexion position 140° ( i.e. , 40° full extension ) plastic band remove check pressure point daily reseal custom-modified plastic strap melt seal strap , do previously19,20 . The reason brace remove without break plastic seal , could break case emergency brace remove entirely , require . Using model disuse find immobilize brace well tolerate , restrictive , importantly occlude popliteal and/or femoral artery blood flow , case edema venous thrombosis previous study . Participants also provide elastic support bandage lessen risk deep vein thrombosis . On t=0 , blood sample , saliva sample muscle biopsy collect assessment muscle protein synthesis rate . Muscle strength volume assess use Biodex ultrasonography respectively . A knee brace place start 7-day single leg immobilization phase . The choice leg immobilization randomize balanced dominance accord maximal isometric strength . At end immobilization phase ( t=7 ) , blood sample obtain , muscle biopsy collect immobilized non-immobilized leg , muscle volume strength assess . After strength assess leg , muscle biopsy take assess effect 17β-estradiol muscle response single bout exercise ( Biodex ) non-immobilized immobilized leg 3-hrs exercise bout .</detailed_description>
