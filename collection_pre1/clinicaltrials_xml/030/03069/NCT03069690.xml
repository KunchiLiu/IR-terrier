	<brief_title>Optimizing Health From Pregnancy Through One Year Postpartum</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The perinatal period , pregnancy first postpartum year , important implication woman 's health . Excessive gestational weight gain link deleterious health outcome ; yet woman exceed guideline establish gestational weight gain , particularly woman begin pregnancy overweight obese . These woman likely remain overweight obese one year postpartum even gestational weight gain within guideline pregnancy-related weight gain lose postpartum . Efforts mitigate health risk related perinatal overweight substantial benefit woman 's longer-term obesity cardiometabolic health . To date , intervention minimize excessive gestational weight gain alone limited impact . Some woman may require continued intervention postpartum period achieve optimal weight management . Alternatively , intervention deliver postpartum may sufficient achieve healthy weight one year postpartum . It also important adapt intervention woman 's need vary course pregnancy postpartum . Accordingly , application propose sequential multiple assignment randomize trial ( SMART ) determine efficacy different intervention sequence pregnancy , postpartum , . This non-restricted SMART also allow investigator investigate impact different combination intervention function gestational weight gain . The propose SMART innovative first effort evaluate different sequence intervention across perinatal period mitigate maternal health risk one year postpartum . Pregnant woman ( N=300 ) , stratify prenatal weight status ( body mass index=25-29.9 vs. ≥30 ) enrol entry prenatal care randomize initially intervention address challenge weight self-regulation pregnancy , Health Behaviors Transition ( HABITpreg ) , educationally-enhanced treatment usual ( TAUpreg ) . At delivery , woman re-randomized postpartum self-regulation intervention ( HABITpost ) educationally-enhanced treatment usual ( TAUpost ) . Women complete assessment prenatal baseline , end pregnancy , 6- 12-months postpartum .</detailed_description>
