	<criteria>History histologically confirm colorectal adenocarcinoma metastatic liver clinical radiographic evidence extrahepatic disease . Confirmation diagnosis must perform enrol institution . Confirmed RAS/RAF wild type tumor . Paraffinembedded tumor tissue obtain primary tumor metastasis Have receive prior treatment metastatic disease oxaliplatinbased regimen disease progression °Please note : Patients receive prior oxaliplatinbased regimen adjuvant setting eligible . Oxaliplatin must give metastatic setting . Patients must meet follow criterion unresectability determine two hepatobiliary surgeon one radiologist : When margin negative resection would require resection three hepatic vein , portal vein , retrohepatic vena cava . Requiring resection leave less 2 hepatic segment ( include caudate lobe ) behind adequate arterial/portal inflow , venous outflow biliary drainage . ** **A patient consider resectable procedure include minor wedge thermoablation encompass 10 % less volume remain 2 segment . Patient‟s liver metastasis must comprise &lt; 70 % liver parenchyma . All patient must clinically fit undergo surgery determine preoperative evaluation Lab value within 14 day prior enrollment/randomization : WBC ≥ 3.0 K/uL ANC &gt; 1.5 K/uL Platelets ≥ 100,000/uL Renal function ( ≤ 10 day prior enrollment/randomization ) °Creatinine ≤ 1.5 mg/dL creatinine clearance ≥ 50 mL/min calculate CockcroftGault method follow : CockcroftGault method follow : Male creatinine clearance = ( 140 age year ) x ( weight Kg ) / ( serum Cr mg/dl x 72 ) Female creatinine clearance = ( 140 age year ) x ( weight Kg ) x 0.85 / ( serum Cr mg/dl x 72 ) ( use creatinine clearance per protocol base chemotherapy regimen ) Hepatic function , follow : ( ≤ 10 day prior enrollment/randomization ) Total Bilirubin ≤ 1.5 mg/dl Calcium ≥ low limit normal ( ≤ 48 hour prior enrollment/randomization ) KPS ≥ 60 % ( ECOG ( Karnofsky ) performance status ( preferably 0 1/≥ 60 % Karnofsky ) ) Patients &lt; 18 year age Patients receive one chemotherapy regimen metastatic disease Patients chemotherapy naïve Prior radiation liver ( Prior radiation therapy pelvis acceptable complete least 4 week prior registration ) Active infection °Active infection include patient positive blood culture Prior treatment HAI FUDR Prior TACE Female patient pregnant lactate plan become pregnant within 6 month end treatment ( female patient childbearing potential must negative pregnancy test ≤ 72 hour enrollment randomization , must negative pregnancy test ≤ 72 hour prior treatment start ) If patient serious medical problem may preclude receive type treatment Patients history know presence primary CNS tumor , seizure wellcontrolled standard medical therapy , history stroke also exclude . Serious nonhealing active wound , ulcer , bone fracture History interstitial lung disease e.g . pneumonitis pulmonary fibrosis evidence interstitial lung disease baseline chest CT scan Patients diagnosis Gilbert‟s disease History malignancy , except : 1 . Malignancy treat curative intent know active disease present ≥ 3 year prior randomization felt low risk recurrence treat physician 2 . Adequately treat nonmelanomatous skin cancer lentigo maligna without evidence disease 3 . Adequately treated cervical carcinoma situ without evidence disease</criteria>
