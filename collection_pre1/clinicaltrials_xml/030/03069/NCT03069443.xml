	<brief_title>Isometric Handgrip Home Training Lower Blood Pressure Hypertensive Older adulTs</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Hypertension markedly increase risk cardiovascular disease overall mortality . Lifestyle modification increase level physical activity recommend ﬁrst line anti-hypertensive treatment . A recent systematic review show isometric handgrip ( IHG ) training superior traditional endurance strength train lower rest systolic blood pressure ( SBP ) . The average length previous IHG training study approximately 7.5 week longest 10 week . Therefore , presently unknown possible low blood pressure level beyond 10 week mark . Recently , investigator develop novel method monitoring handgrip intensity use standard Nintendo Wii Board ( Wii ) . The primary aim study explore effect 20-weeks IHG home training facilitate Wii hypertensive old adult ( +50 year age ) lower SBP compare usual care . Secondary aim explore if/when level effect SBP occur 20-week intervention period train group explore adherence potential harm relate IHG home training . Methods : Based previous evidence , investigator calculate 50 hypertensive old adult ( +50 year age ) need achieve power 80 % . Participants randomly assign either intervention group ( IHG home training + hypertension-guidelines lifestyle change ) control group ( hypertension-guidelines lifestyle change ) . Participants intervention group perform IHG home training ( 30 % maximum grip strength total 8 min per day per hand ) three time week 20-weeks .</detailed_description>
