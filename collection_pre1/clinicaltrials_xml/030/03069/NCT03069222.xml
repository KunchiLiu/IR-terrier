	<brief_title>Longitudinal Assessment Spinal Cord Structural Plasticity Using DTI SCI Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Today , International Standards Neurological Classification Spinal Cord Injury ( ISNSCI ) , include test motor cutaneous sensory function , Spinal Cord Independence Measure ( SCIM ) gold standard neurological classification spinal cord injury ( SCI ) . These standard measure important application rehabilitation SCI primary clinical outcome measure . Despite importance usefulness application , standard measure limitation . For example , ISNSCI , intend clinical classification system , subjective relatively insensitive incremental neurophysiological functional change acute chronic stage recovery . Moreover , ISNSCI evaluate spinal cord ( SC ) function bellow neurological level . For patient child patient concomitant brain injury , reliable evaluation complete due limited cognitive engagement evaluation process . Magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) propose objective tool help clinician make prognosis . However , recent study show conventional clinical MRI correlate well score measure ISNSCI . Diffusion Tensor Imaging ( DTI ) advance MRI tool capable probe white matter integrity information measure directional diffusion water molecule , thus provide microscopic detail conventional MRI . Recent finding suggest DTI promising , non-invasive objective tool evaluate monitor structural change within white matter axon pathways SCI . Our preliminary data show significant deviation DTI indices normative value healthy subject SCI patient whose conventional T2 scan appear normal ( see preliminary data section ) . A likely explanation observe alteration DTI indices degeneration demyelization descend axonal pathway . Although DTI use animal model measure evolution injury SC show great promise detection pathological change SC , longitudinal DTI data obtain human SC available indicate sensitivity DTI technique detect SCI progression recovery . Is DTI capable detect structural change take place SC course rehabilitation individual SCI ? Will measure DTI parameter correlate ISNSCI-based score ? The fundamental hypothesis current study rehabilitation facilitate SC fiber tract repair along spontaneous adaptation follow injury help reconnect injured nerve fiber motoneuron control muscle turn improve motoneuron activity promote muscular function , change detect proposed longitudinal DTI protocols standard clinical tool motor function evaluation . The expected result gain longitudinal study would support application DTI monitoring plastic change injure SC DTI-derived measure could potentially aid clinician make objective diagnosis injury estimate progression , critical planning target therapy . However , scope proposal distinguish contribution structural change occur SC spontaneous treatment factor . Because unethical treat patient , limitation overcome current human study . Given primary focus study longitudinal tracking SC structural change use neuroimaging rather determine relative contribution change spontaneous recovery treatment , limitation significantly influence quality study . To test hypothesis , investigator propose follow Specific Aims . Aim 1 : Track SC structural change patient incomplete SCI ( iSCI ) use DTI . Each patient propose study scan cover entire cervical region SC use DTI sequence baseline , 2 week , 1 month , 3 month 6 month start standard rehabilitation intervention . DTI index ( see method detail ) quantify compare across time point . Previous longitudinal brain DTI human animal study suggest DTI sensitive detect brain whiter matter structural change 24 hour ( animal study ) 3 month ( unpublished human DTI result PI 's group ) brain injury , 6 month initial scan patient Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis ( ALS ) ( DTI data available 6 month initial scan study ) . The investigator hypothesize propose DTI protocol able capture structural change SCI recovery course . Aim 2 : Correlate SC plasticity manifest change DTI indices clinical assessment injury sensorimotor function . Quantitative DTI index correlate clinical diagnosis SCI clinical evaluation upper low limb sensorimotor function patient . It hypothesize DTI index SCI significantly correlate clinical diagnosis score upper low sensorimotor function . The DTI parameter hold great promise biomarker SCI expect prognostic value predict functional outcome rehabilitation program .</detailed_description>
