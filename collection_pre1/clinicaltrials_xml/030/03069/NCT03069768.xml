	<brief_summary>The primary aim study conduct 60-patient feasibility , acceptability , preliminary efficacy study mSMART ( Mobile App base Personalized Solutions Tools Medication Adherence Rx Pill ) , smartphone application ( `` app '' ) improve medication adherence among substance user . The investigator compare 2 group cigarette smoker undergo quit attempt varenicline ( Chantix ) : ) experimental group use mSMART app smartphone MEMS Cap ( Medication Event Monitoring System , smart pillbox record date time-stamped medication event whenever pill box open closed , thus allow primary measurement medication adherence ) b ) control group use MEMS Cap mobile web-based survey smartphone .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Stage Ib Trial mSMART With Varenicline</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Poor medication adherence ( ) result poorer treatment outcome ( b ) account $ 100 $ 290 billion U.S. healthcare cost annually . Therefore , intervention target medication adherence increasingly crucial patient care cost-effectiveness . Mobile technology smartphones increasingly ubiquitous affordable U.S. , integrate augment medication adherence . mSMART smartphone application target medication adherence substance user . The study team develop assessed mSMART Stage Ia trial among 9 non-treatment seek cigarette smoker . mSMART provide psychoeducation medication ( e.g. , dosage , benefit , side-effects ) , assessment medication compliance characteristic associate substance use , provide reminder take medication , conduct real-time medication event feedback intervention . The aim current study extend finding Stage Ia trial assess preliminary feasibility acceptability mSMART cigarette smoker . In proposed study , investigator conduct Stage Ib continue development mSMART occupational wellness set . This also include study feasibility , acceptability , preliminary efficacy mSMART treatment seek cigarette smoker undergo quit attempt . A sample 60 cigarette smoker give varenicline ( Chantix ) randomize either control condition ( i.e. , use MEMS Cap , smart pillbox record instance pill bottle open ) treatment condition ( i.e. , use MEMS Cap mSMART ) 12 week treatment period . The primary hypothesis treatment group achieve high level medication adherence assess via MEMS Cap . The secondary hypothesis treatment group also yield low level salivary cotinine week 12 assessment , indicate high rate smoke abstinence relative control group . Findings current study inform continue development mSMART intervention enhance substance use treatment outcome , include form substance use besides cigarette smoking .</detailed_description>
