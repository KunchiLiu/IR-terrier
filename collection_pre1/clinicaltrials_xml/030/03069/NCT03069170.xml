	<brief_summary>Until , effective approach stop progression multiple sclerosis stimulate re-myelination . Autologous stem cell transplantation show hope quickly develop alternative therapy . We propose use autologous bone marrow-derived specific stem cell population mesenchymal stem cell transplantation ( BM-MSC ) associate immuno-modulation treat patient relapsing-remitting MS ( RRMS ) .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Multiple sclerosis ( MS ) autoimmune de-myelinating disease myelin sheath nerve cell central nervous system damaged.This damage disrupts ability part nervous system communicate , result range sign symptom , include physical , mental , psychiatric issue . To date , There know cure multiple sclerosis . Treatments attempt improve function attack prevent new attack . Stem cell posse strong immunomodulatory property show play role maintenance peripheral tolerance control autoimmunity may stimulate repair regeneration lesion . Clinical study show stem cell safely harvest form tumor . Most human stem cell trial focus clinical application haematopoietic stem cell ( HSC ) , mesenchymal stem cell ( MSC ) , . When administer intravenously immune inhibitory effect ameliorate animal autoimmune disease . MSC transplantation significantly improve clinical outcome experimental allergic encephalitis ( EAE ) . When administer intravenously , MSC may migrate inflammatory brain lesion promote survival nervous cell . Hence , MSC become focus study potential cell therapy stimulate neuro-protection human neurodegenerative disease MS. We propose safety efficacy trial intravenous intrathecal injection autologous bone marrow-derived stem cell patient MS .</detailed_description>
