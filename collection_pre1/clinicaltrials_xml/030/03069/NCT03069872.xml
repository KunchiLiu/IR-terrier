	<brief_summary>Background Ovarian cancer ( OC ) disease poor prognosis due diagnosis late stage . Early-stage OC present non-specific vague symptom therefore OC usually detect reach advanced stage . From 2008 , Danish general practitioner ( GPs ) could urgently refer patient suspected OC standardize cancer patient pathway ( CPPs ) . The CPP design woman present specific sign alarm symptom , suppose shorten pathway suspicion treatment . Hypothesis Direct access fast transvaginal ultrasound ( TVU ) general practice feasible early diagnosis OC . Aim The aim study assess implementation clinical implication direct referral access fast TVU general practice . Materials methods The study feasibility study GPs Central Denmark Region offer direct access fast TVU woman age 40 year present symptom could origin OC , classify alarm symptom . The GPs receive education update knowledge OC symptom use guideline early diagnosis OC general practice . The study period 1 year . Perspectives There great need test rational strategy diagnose OC earlier stage order improve survival . For woman fulfil access criterion CPP , main prospect earlier diagnosis improve identification symptomatic OC , study may provide important new knowledge facilitate diagnostics OC future reduce time diagnosis improve survival .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Trial Fast Access Transvaginal Ultrasound Through General Practice Earlier Diagnosis Ovarian Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Background Around 550 ovarian cancer ( OCs ) diagnose yearly Denmark . Still , OC fourth commonest cause cancer death amongst woman Denmark . Epithelial ovarian cancer ( carcinoma ) account 90 % OCs Denmark second high incidence world ( 15 per 100.000 woman ) life-time risk around 2 % . The mean age diagnosis 63 year , 80 % postmenopausal . In Denmark , 74 % diagnosed FIGO stage III-IV therefore time diagnosis regional metastatic spread . Five-year survival FIGO stage I 83 % , stage II 62 % , stage III 23 % stage IV 11 % . Thus , OC detect advanced stage poor prognosis . In 2008 , national fast-track system cancer patient establish ensure fast diagnosis initiation treatment . The fast-track system cancer patient pathway ( CPP ) imply patient present 'alarm ' symptom e.g . OC refer immediately diagnostic workup ; 14 day must pass referral initiation treatment . Only one quarter woman OC refer primarily route . Therefore , additional accelerate route need majority woman OC . A possibility could access fast TVU general practice woman present vague non-specific symptom may represent underlie OC . Aim Develop conduct train general practitioner ( GPs ) late knowledge OC symptomatology . And time investigate feasibility clinical implication general practice direct referral access fast TVU , intend woman present vague non-specific symptom . Material method GPs Central Denmark Region offer direct access fast TVU woman age 40 year present vague non-specific symptom could origin OC , classify alarm symptom . Shortly afterwards GPs offer short lecture OC symptomatology instruction use TVU earlier diagnosis OC general practice . The lecture conduct researcher research group . Prior investigation , woman refer TVU receive consent form symptom-questionnaire . The symptom questionnaire focus experienced symptom past year . After finished investigation , TVU test result return electronically refer GP . The study period one year . Data analysis focus frequency TVU use general practice , action take test result patient-reported symptom prior TVU . Perspectives The project provide important new knowledge GPs referral practice suspect OC . For woman present vague non-specific symptom may origin OC , introduction TVU general practice provide new possibility evaluate symptom . Therefor introduction TVU corner stone identification efficient way evaluate woman risk develop OC . This study contribute important knowledge improve diagnostics OC future may reduce time diagnosis .</detailed_description>
