	<criteria>Male female age ≥ 18 year time inform consent Be willing able provide write informed consent/assent trial Be willing comply treatment protocol Subjects must histologically confirm metastatic and/or locally advance sarcoma Subjects must least 1 injectable cutaneous , subcutaneous soft tissue nodal lesion ≥ 10 mm long diameter . Of note , bone lesion eligible injection unless soft tissue component amenable injection . Injectable lesion must choose previously irradiate field unless radiographically and/or pathologically documented tumor progression lesion prior enrollment Subjects must least one prior line systemic therapy ( e.g . chemotherapy , immunotherapy , target biological therapy ) sarcoma . Prior adjuvant therapy count provide complete 6 month previously Subjects must measurable disease ( least one target lesion ) define RECIST 1.1 . Target lesion must choose previously irradiate field unless radiographically and/or pathologically documented tumor progression lesion prior enrollment Adequate performance status : ECOG 0 1/KPS 10070 % Adequate organ function determine within 10 day treatment initiation , define follow : I. Hemoglobin ≥ 8.0 g/dl ( without need hematopoietic growth factor transfusion support ) II . Absolute neutrophil count ≥ 1,500/mm3 ( 1.5 x 109/L ) III .

Subjects previously treat brain metastasis may participate provide stable ( without evidence progression image least four week prior first dose trial treatment neurologic symptom return baseline ) , evidence new enlarge brain metastasis , use steroid least 7 day prior trial treatment . This exception include carcinomatous meningitis exclude regardless clinical stability Evidence clinically significant immunosuppression follow : Primary immunodeficiency state Severe Combined Immunodeficiency Disease Concurrent opportunistic infection Receiving systemic immunosuppressive therapy ( &gt; 2 week ) include oral steroid dose &gt; 10 mg/day prednisone equivalent within 2 month prior enrollment . However , set nonimmune mediate indication use , chronic/active low dose steroid use may permit discretion principal investigator Known history human immunodeficiency virus ( HIV ) disease History evidence symptomatic autoimmune disease ( e.g. , pneumonitis , glomerulonephritis , vasculitis , ) , history active autoimmune disease require systemic treatment ( i.e. , use corticosteroid , immunosuppressive drug biological agent use treatment autoimmune disease ) past 2 year prior enrollment . Replacement therapy ( e.g. , thyroxine hypothyroidism , insulin diabetes physiologic corticosteroid replacement therapy adrenal pituitary insufficiency ) consider form systemic treatment autoimmune disease Active herpetic skin lesion prior complication herpetic infection Require intermittent chronic treatment intravenous oral antiherpetic drug ( e.g. , acyclovir ) , intermittent topical use Has know active Hepatitis B ( e.g. , HBsAg reactive ) Hepatitis C ( e.g. , HCV RNA [ qualitative ] detect ) Received live vaccine within 28 day prior enrollment . Note : Seasonal influenza vaccine injection generally inactivate flu vaccine allow ; however intranasal influenza vaccine ( e.g. , FluMist® ) live attenuate vaccine , allow Has know history active TB ( Bacillus Tuberculosis ) Female subject pregnant breastfeeding , plan become pregnant male subject plan father child within project duration trial , start prescreening screen visit , study treatment 3 month last dose talimogene laherparepvec 4 month last dose pembrolizumab , whichever later Male female subject childbearing potential unwilling use acceptable method ( ) effective contraception study treatment 3 month last dose talimogene laherparepvec 4 month last dose pemrolizumab .
