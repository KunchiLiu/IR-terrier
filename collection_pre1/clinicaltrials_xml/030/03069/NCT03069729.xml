	<brief_summary>The goal research develop good tool diagnose illness foot legs people diabetes . Investigators use thermal video foot aid refinement system design detect sign diabetic peripheral neuropathy ( DPN ) . The team investigator also look diabetic eye disease might relate diabetic foot disease .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Thermal Screening Early Diabetic Peripheral Neuropathy ( DPN )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This study focus development test microvascular functional imaging system , computer-based system screen thermal video image , design detect biomarkers diabetic peripheral neuropathy ( DPN ) . Additionally , severity level diabetic retinopathy ( DR ) compare DPN . All participant study undergo foot exam , thermal image foot , standard retinal imaging . These non-invasive assessment perform initial study visit . Some participant offer additional study visit . One additional visit involve standard nerve conduction velocity assessment neurologist , involve DPN exam podiatrist . Portions study take place University New Mexico Health Sciences Center ( UNM HSC ) . The research utilize service Clinical Translational Science Center ( CTSC ) . The study approve University New Mexico Health Sciences Center 's Human Research Review Committee ( HRRC ) , coordinate support activity three federally mandate Human Research Review Committees ( HRRCs ) responsible review approve human research .</detailed_description>
