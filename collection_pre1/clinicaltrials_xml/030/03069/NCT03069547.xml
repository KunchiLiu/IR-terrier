	<brief_summary>Patellofemoral Pain ( PFP ) common knee problem , primarily affect adolescent young adult . PFP characterise significant retropatellar and/or peripatellar pain impairment function quality daily life . Exercise therapy unequivocally recommend core component management PFP . Different exercise type ( e.g . quadriceps strengthen , hip strengthen functional/neuromuscular exercise ) investigate , knee hip strengthen exercise common recommend type . These exercise approach produce similar small moderate effect pain physical function . However , PFP population heterogeneous `` one-size-fits-all '' -approaches presumably sub-optimal heterogeneity ignore . The heterogeneity probably explain overall limited beneficial effect exercise , lack difference direct comparison different exercise type . In sense , unlikely certain patient characteristic may predict outcome success either hip training program training program focus quadriceps remain show . This study two aim : 1 . To assess comparative effectiveness two different exercise program ( Quadricep Exercise [ QE ] vs. Hip Exercise [ HE ] ) self-reported pain function individual PFP . 2 . To explore candidate patient characteristic predict differential response two exercise program ( QE v HE ) self-reported pain physical function individual PFP . According study aim pursue follow hypothesis : - QE HE equivalent efficacy self-reported pain 12 week treatment patient PFP . The second study aim explore possible candidate patient characteristic may associate differential outcome . As exploratory , pursuit aim hypothesis-free .</brief_summary>
