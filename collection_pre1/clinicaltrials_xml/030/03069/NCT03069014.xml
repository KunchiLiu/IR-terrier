	<brief_title>Study LM11A-31-BHS Mild-moderate AD Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The goal AD Pilot conduct prospective , double-blind , multicenter , phase IIa exploratory safety , feasibility proof-of-concept trial mild moderate Alzheimer 's disease patient orally bioavailable p75 neurotrophin receptor ligand LM11A-31-BHS dosed twice daily 26 week . Successful completion trial provide safety , endpoint statistical basis design execution phase 2b/3 efficacy trial . It also bring AD field much-needed new set target mechanism help pioneer strategy concomitant target multiple fundamental AD-related pathological process . During 26 week study period eligible patient invite 5 visit . Safety monitor include full extent phase 2 clinical , electrophysiological laboratory testing .</detailed_description>
