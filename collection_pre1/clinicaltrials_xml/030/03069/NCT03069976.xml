	<brief_summary>Based upon possible implication microbiota abnormal microbial metabolite alter bile acid , pathogenesis PSC , emerge data suggest oral antibiotic , vancomycin metronidazole , may therapeutic effect overlap syndrome PSC . The goal study evaluate role antibiotic microflora child AIH/PSC overlap syndrome PSC alone . The investigator hope learn effect oral antibiotic bacteria present stool , hope learn characterize human intestinal microbial community , child suffer overlap syndrome PSC . The hypothesis investigator overlap syndrome PSC develop due alter microflora result abnormal bile acid pool . The outcome overlap syndrome PSC could affect presence absence RCUH . Antibiotics correct microflora may result disease/cholangiopathy remission .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>`` Overlap Syndrome PSC : Evaluating Role Gut Microflora Its Identification With Antibiotics Children ''</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The use antibiotic Metronidazole ( Flagyl ) Vancomycine , 14 day , induction therapy rescue therapy . Study participant provide blood stool sample order evaluate bile acid profile microbiome , course metronidazole , comparison make pre- post-antibiotics . The investigator determine benefit oral metronidazole therapy improvement clinical symptom improvement liver function test .</detailed_description>
