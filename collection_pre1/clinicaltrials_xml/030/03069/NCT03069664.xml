	<brief_title>Palliative Pancreatic Duct Stenting Patients With Inoperable Pancreatic Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>In prospective study patient inoperable pancreatic cancer . In patient pancreatic tumor cause radiologically visible dilatation pancreatic duct proximally tumor minimum diameter 6mm . Patients also suffer chronic abdominal pain cause pancreatic cancer . The strength pain patient experience evaluate visual analogue scale ( VAS ) . Patients study report experience chronic abdominal pain least strength VAS 6 time recruitment . In pilot study total 40 patient recruit . Patients divide two 20 patient group . First group receive pancreatic duct stent follow pain medication need control group go conventional pain relief method . All patient ask evaluate strength experience pain visual analogue scale time recruitment , every 4 week 24 week . The patient also ask evaluate quality life standardize EORTC-QLQ C30 version 3 quality life questionnaire time recruitment every 4 week 24 week . The patient also ask report body weight , amount pancreatic enzyme supplement need every point survey .</detailed_description>
