	<detailed_description>A two year , parallel , two phase , two group , open-label , randomize control trial design patient severe complex obesity refer Tier 3 obesity service ( include patient refer Tier 3 service part bariatric surgery pathway ) . This first phase study ( first 52 week randomization ) determine whether target use LIRA 3 mg combination standard care provide Tier 3 set result participant attain ≥15 % weight loss compare standard care alone Tier 3 service . The second phase study aim provide evidence whether patient achieve ≥15 % weight loss baseline weight first phase study , able maintain ≥15 % weight loss another 52 week use standard care plus LIRA 3mg compare standard care alone . Further , budget impact , cost-effectiveness , improvement obesity-related co-morbidities , complementary aspect safety , effectiveness treatment satisfaction treatment group assess compare ( see Section 6.4.2 ) . The study intentionally design reflect `` real- world '' case Tier 3 provider may require different number visit programme . However , appointment data collection , appointment dietician first 8 week , appointment clinician application stop rule LIRA 3mg Liraglutide supply standardise five site . Visit Week ( - ) 4 initial screening , assessment eligibility consent participate study healthcare professional . A second screening visit could take place regard eligibility indicate ( example repeat blood pressure measurement repeat blood ) . Phase I The first phase study start visit week 0 randomisation , clinician dietician assessment . Patients LIRA 3mg group start Liraglutide accordance pre-specified titration protocol . Further visit week 2 , 4 , 8 12 data collection , appointment dietician ( week 2 , 4 8 ) , monitor side effect patient LIRA 3mg monitoring dose escalation ( week 2 4 ) . A visit week 16 data collection , assessment clinician 1st stop rule possible extension prescription LIRA 3mg participant standard care plus LIRA 3mg group lose ≥5 % baseline weight . Further appointment take place data collection monitoring side effect ( patient LIRA 3mg ) 20 week . A visit week 32 randomisation data collection assessment clinician 2nd stop rule possible extension prescription LIRA 3mg ( high tolerate dose ) . Further visit data collection LIRA 3mg supplementation 40 week another assessment clinician 3rd stop rule 52 week randomisation ( visualisation see Figures Appendices 2,3 ) . Phase II The second phase study ( extension study ) include visit participant week 78 data collection supply LIRA 3mg continue LIRA 3mg second year week 104 data collection ( last visit participant ) . Visits week 65 91 take place participant treatment LIRA 3mg order prescription supply LIRA 3mg ( Appendices 2,3 ) . Patients screen ( Visit 1 ) 28 day prior Baseline Visit ( Day 0 ) . The first phase study begin randomisation Baseline Visit initiation treatment accord protocol group . Study participation end visit 104 week , end second phase trial . Maximal time study 110 week ( Screening 4 week baseline plus 104 week study plus allow margin 2 week ) . 6.2 Intervention Participants randomise 2:1 fashion either intervention control arm ( 2 intervention : 1 control ) . The intervention arm standard care Tier 3 service plus LIRA 3mg protocol stopping rule . The LIRA 3mg protocol describe ( see also Appendix 2 ) . LIRA 3mg prescribed participant intervention arm first 16 week . Dose escalation Liraglutide occur tolerate accord pre-specified titration protocol , 0.6mg maximum 3.0mg . Liraglutide dose initiate 0.6 mg increase 1.2 mg week two , 1.8 mg week three , 2.4mg week four 3.0 mg week five . The diet lifestyle option control arm , may include meal replacement , prescribe . Participants intervention group aware continue LIRA 3mg treatment ( high tolerate dose ) , achieve target weight loss first 16 week . First stop rule : After 16 week medication , participant lose ≥5 % baseline weight offer treatment LIRA 3mg ( high dose tolerate ) 12 week . Second stopping rule : After 32 week medication , participant lose ≥10 % baseline weight already treatment LIRA 3mg offer another 24 week LIRA 3mg . ( high dose tolerate ) Third stop rule : After first year treatment ( week 52 since randomisation ) , participant achieve ≥15 % start weight already treatment LIRA 3mg offer another 52 week LIRA 3mg ( high dose tolerate ) . Participants fail reach threshold continue LIRA 3mg treatment , choose stop treatment , continue offer standard care provide Tier 3 equivalent service . Participants remain routinely Tier 3 ( equivalent ) service line NICE guidance . After end Tier 3 programme may offer treatment option , include bariatric surgery , per NICE guidance accord decision local Tier 3 Multidisciplinary Team . At end second year , participant ask come back assessment . The control group receive standard care specialist obesity service ( Tier 3 equivalent ) . Participants standard care group follow best medical care provide service typically involve dietary advice reduce energy intake ( may include period partial total meal replacement ) , accompany - available - physical activity programme , support behavioural change technique regular professional contact . Clinician input include medical assessment participant severe complicate obesity prescription anti-obesity drug ( orlistat ) per local Tier 3 service policy . Participants remain routinely Tier 3 ( equivalent ) service line NICE guidance . After end Tier 3 programme may offer treatment option , include bariatric surgery , per NICE guidance accord decision local Tier 3 Multidisciplinary Team . At end second year , participant ask come back assessment .</detailed_description>
