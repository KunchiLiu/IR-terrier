	<detailed_description>Quinoa possible alternative wheat , corn rice due high nutritional value possible property cardiovascular disease . There animal study suggest quinoa beneficial effect marker cardiovascular disease , particularly blood lipid profile . The grain unique nutritional profile , high fibre level wide range phytochemical may influence gut bacteria improve gastrointestinal health . However , effect quinoa human rarely investigate two small intervention publish . These study also show improvement blood lipid profile consume quinoa daily . There study investigate effect quinoa gut bacteria gastrointestinal health . Therefore , human dietary intervention study aim determine effect quinoa consumption marker cardiovascular disease , gut microbiome gastrointestinal health . The study randomize cross-over design dietary intervention study 4-week study period separate 4-week wash-out period . The treatment daily consumption test bread roll contain quinoa deliver 20g quinoa per day ( one roll per day ) . The control amount refine wheat roll . Markers cardiovascular disease risk , include fast blood lipid profile , plasma glucose insulin concentration , rest blood pressure compare begin end treatment period . Changes number specie gut bacteria , product bacterial fermentation make stool sample collect begin end intervention period indicator gastrointestinal health .</detailed_description>
