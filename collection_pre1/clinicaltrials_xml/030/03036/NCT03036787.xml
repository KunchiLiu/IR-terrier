	<brief_summary>Infant born preterm increase risk adverse long-term developmental outcomes.The risk associate preterm birth increase gestational age decrease , vulnerability remain extremely- preterm ( &lt; 32 week ) moderate- late preterm ( &gt; 32 week ) . There many study literature show prevalence developmental delay increase premature birth . However , study literature investigate long term follow motor cognitive development subgroup preterm infant . Hence aim study evaluate difference motor cognitive development moderate-late ( &gt; 32 week ) extremely-very preterm infant .</brief_summary>
