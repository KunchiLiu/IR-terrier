	<brief_summary>Surgery shoulder may perform patient seat upright position know `` Beach Chair Position ( BCP ) . '' This position certain advantage compare alternative surgical position ( e.g . side lie ) situation . However , find surgery BCP temporarily decrease amount oxygen brain result combined effect gravity anaesthesia . This result complication follow surgery memory loss confusion . Rarely , serious complication report past include death stroke . Due report complication use `` cerebral oximetry '' shoulder surgery BCP become common . Before surgery , monitor place patient forehead measure amount oxygen present brain help control acceptable level . A number monitor commercially available . Two monitor commonly discuss literature ; INVOS™ 5100 FORE-SIGHT® machine . However , actual relationship supply oxygen brain surgery chance later develop problem memory thinking ( know `` post operative cognitive decline '' - POCD ) clear . It also know one monitor accurate another predicting complication . Therefore , main aim study examine relationship cerebral oxygen level shoulder surgery incidence POCD ( i.e . problem memory think ) . A second aim compare INVOS™ 5100 FORE-SIGHT® monitor ability measure cerebral oxygen cerebral desaturation event ( CDEs ) well importance key clinical variable ( e.g . blood pressure , nausea , body fat etc ) .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>PURPOSE OF THE INVESTIGATION The purpose investigation generate evidence cerebral oxygenation shoulder surgery incidence POCD . Currently , evidence relate POCD follow surgery conflict relates mostly outcomes follow cardiac surgery . There strong need explore relationship specific context shoulder surgery BCP . INTERVENTION GROUPS This study involve single prospective cohort . Patients meet selection criterion recruit study follow voluntary informed consent . Cerebral oxygenation measure application cerebral oximeter patient forehead . AIM OF THE STUDY This study three aim ; ( ) To examine relationship cerebral desaturation shoulder surgery BCP , incidence POCD . ( ii ) To determine variation cerebral oxygenation record use randomise ( superior/inferior ) simultaneous application INVOS™ FORE-SIGHT® oximeter , shoulder surgery beach chair position . ( iii ) Assess relationships cerebral oxygen desaturation shoulder surgery BCP variables include mean arterial pressure , incidence nausea/vomiting , duration hospital stay , BMI , hypertension adverse event . RESEARCH QUESTION There three research question correlate three research aim ; ( ) Is cerebral desaturation shoulder surgery associate POCD ? ( ii ) Do FORE-SIGHT® INVOS™ 5100 device vary measurement cerebral oxygenation shoulder surgery BCP ? ( iii ) Is relationship cerebral desaturation event shoulder surgery BCP variables include mean arterial blood pressure , post-operative nausea/vomiting , length hospital stay , BMI , hypertension adverse event ? NULL HYPOTHESES The three null hypothesis ; ( ) Cerebral desaturation measure use cerebral oximetry relate POCD shoulder surgery BCP . ( ii ) There significant difference INVOS™ 5100 FORE-SIGHT® monitor assessment cerebral oxygenation shoulder surgery BCP . ( iii ) There relationship cerebral desaturation event shoulder surgery BCP variables include mean arterial blood pressure , frequency post-operative nausea/vomiting , length hospital stay , BMI , hypertension adverse event . PRIMARY HYPOTHESES The primary research hypothesis ; ( ) Cerebral desaturation event surgery BCP relate POCD . ( ii ) The INVOS™ 5100 FORE-SIGHT® monitor show significant difference ability measure cerebral oxygenation . ( iii ) Cerebral desaturation event experience shoulder surgery BCP relate drop mean arterial blood pressure , increase likelihood post-operative nausea vomiting , great length hospital stay , high BMI , hypertension great frequency adverse event .</detailed_description>
