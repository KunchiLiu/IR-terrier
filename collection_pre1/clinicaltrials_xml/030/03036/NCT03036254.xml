	<brief_title>Hyperbaric Oxygen Therapy Cognition Diabetic Elderly High Dementia Risk</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This resubmission respond `` PAR-16-365-Pilot Clinical Trials Spectrum Alzheimer 's Disease Age-related Cognitive Decline ( R01 ) '' . It examine efficacy hyperbaric oxygen therapy ( HBOT ) improve cognitive functioning cognitively impair elderly diabetes ( T2D ) , high risk dementia . It collaboration Icahn School Medicine Mount Sinai , NY , University Wisconsin , Sagol Center Hyperbaric Medicine Research Asaf Harofeh Medical Center , Israel—one world 's large busiest hyperbaric units—and Sheba Medical Center , Israel . HBOT treatment oxygen-enriched air ( 100 % ) administer patient pressure ambient atmosphere . The combined action hyperoxia hyperbaric pressure lead significant improvement tissue oxygenation , result cerebrovascular benefit improve ischemic damage cerebral blood flow . Recently , researcher group publish compel evidence clinical trial indicate HBOT neurotherapeutic effect stroke , well cognitive function elevate brain activity SPECT . New preliminary data suggest potential neurotherapeutic effect HBOT T2D elderly mild cognitive impairment ( MCI ) , show well cognitive performance brain activity . The researcher propose randomize controlled clinical trial examine short ( 12 week ) long-term ( 12 month ) efficacy HBOT . The researcher test hypothesis HBOT compare sham condition improve cognitive function increase cerebral blood flow glucose utilization MCI patient T2D . Such patient high dementia risk enrich cerebrovascular disease , thus high potential benefitting HBOT . Aim 1 examines potential beneficial effect HBOT cognition ( primary composite measure executive function episodic memory , affect T2D ) . Aim 2 examines effect HBOT ischemic injury measure CBF level capillary gray matter ( MRI arterial spin label ) , macrovessels ( novel 4D Flow MRI technology develop researcher group ) . Aim 3 focus effect HBOT cerebral glucose utilization use [ F18 ] FDG-PET . Finally , Aim 4 investigates mediation biomarkers , i.e . whether inclusion mediation model attenuate effect HBOT cognition , suggest underlying mechanism . This study perform Israel , optimal infrastructure expertise study component significantly low cost . HBOT widely deploy US successful , pilot study provide basis multi-center large-scale clinical trial definitive evidence benefit cognition T2D patient high dementia risk . Despite advance understand risk factor pathologic basis dementia , treatment limited effect . As proportion elderly increase , accelerate prevalence T2D dementia amplify application 's public health impact .</detailed_description>
