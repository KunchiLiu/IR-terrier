	<brief_summary>The Global Program Elimination Lymphatic Filariasis ( GPELF ) operation sing year 2000 , aim eliminate disease year 2020 , follow 5-6 round effective annual Mass Drug Administration ( MDA ) . The treatment regimen Ivermectin ( IVM ) combination Diethylcarbamazine ( DEC ) Albendazole ( ALB ) . In Ghana , MDA undertake since 2001 . While disease eliminate many area , transmission persist implementation unit experience 15 round MDA . Alternative intervention strategy , include twice yearly MDA sleep insecticidal net significantly accelerate transmission interruption setting high transmission intensity . Thus , evident new intervention strategy could eliminate residual infection area persistent transmission speed LF elimination process . This study therefore seek test hypothesis biannual treatment LF endemic community accelerate interruption LF transmission . Two cluster randomize trial implement LF endemic community Ghana . The intervention yearly twice-yearly MDA deliver entire endemic community . Allocation study group cluster identify use prevalence LF . Clusters randomise one two group : receive either ( 1 ) annual treatment IVM+ALB ; ( 2 ) annual MDA IVM +ALB , follow additional MDA 6 month later . The primary outcome measure prevalence LF infection , assess four cross-sectional survey . Entomological assessment also undertake evaluate transmission intensity disease study cluster . Costs cost-effectiveness evaluated . Among random subsample participant , microfilaria prevalence assess longitudinally . A nested process evaluation , use semi-structured interview , focus group discussion stakeholder analysis , investigate community acceptability , feasibility scale-up delivery system .</brief_summary>
