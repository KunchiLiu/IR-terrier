	<brief_summary>This placebo-controlled clinical trial VRC01 administration analytic treatment interruption ( ATI ) adult begin antiretroviral therapy ( ART ) early acute HIV infection ( Fiebig stage I III ) . Eligible volunteer randomize 3:1 ratio either VRC01 placebo , randomization stratify Fiebig stage . Volunteers receive ART non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor ( NNRTI ) undergo 4 week protease inhibitor ( PI ) substitution NNRTI prior randomization . ATI begin day first dose either VRC01 placebo . Participants monitor closely HIV viremia pre-defined criterion ART resumption . Administration study agent ( VRC01 ) every three week discontinue 24 week ART resume , whichever occur first . Volunteers remain virally suppress without laboratory clinical indication ART resumption 24 week continue intensive monitoring ART resumption criterion additional 24 week , time VRC01 placebo administer .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The study agent , VRC-HIVMAB060-00-antibody ( AB ) , manufacture VRC Vaccine Pilot Plant operate Leidos Biomedical Research , Inc , formerly SAIC-Frederick , Inc , Frederick , MD . Specific manufacture information include product vial label Certificates Analysis find Investigator 's Brochure ( IB ) . Quality Assurance ( QA ) lot release test manufacturer ongoing stability program verify conformance product specification prior use clinical trial . VRC-HIVMAB060-00-AB ( VRC01 ) broadly neutralize human monoclonal antibody ( mAb ) target HIV-1 CD4 bind site . It develop VRC/NIAID/NIH . VRC01 IgG1 subtype highly somatically mutate germ-line precursor . The heavy chain CDR3 region 14 amino acid long , average length relative natural antibody , glycosylation pattern derive production Chinese Hamster Ovary ( CHO ) mammalian cell line . This placebo-controlled clinical trial VRC01 administration ATI adult begin ART early acute HIV infection ( Fiebig stage I III ) . Eligible volunteer randomize 3:1 ratio either VRC01 placebo . Participants undergo randomization stratify Fiebig stage . Volunteers receive ART NNRTI undergo 4 week PI substitution prior randomization . ATI begin day first dose either VRC01 placebo . Participants monitor closely HIV viremia pre-defined criterion ART resumption . Administration study agent ( VRC01 ) every 3 week discontinue 24 week time ART resume , whichever occur first . Volunteers remain virally suppress without laboratory clinical indication ART resumption 24 week continue intensive monitoring ART resumption criterion additional 24 week , time VRC01 placebo administer . Clinical study visit take place Thai Red Cross AIDS Research Centre , optional procedure may occur King Chulalongkorn Memorial Hospital . This study recruit 24 adult age 20-50 year diagnose acute HIV infection ( Fiebig stage I III ) initiate ART Bangkok , Thailand . Participants recruit protocol RV 254 ( SEARCH 010 , WRAIR 1494 ) . This ongoing parent study cohort enroll participant document acute HIV infection Thai Red Cross AIDS Research Center Bangkok , Thailand . All participant RV 254 offer ART time enrollment separately fund protocol . Study agent : VRC01 administer dose 40 mg/kg intravenously every three week participant assign intervention arm trial total duration 24 week ART resumption criterion meet , whichever come first . Placebo : Normal saline ( Sodium Chloride Injection USP , 0.9 % ) administer intravenously every three week participant assign placebo arm trial total duration 24 week ART resumption criterion meet , whichever come first . ANALYTIC TREATMENT INTERRUPTION ( ATI ) Analytic treatment interruption begin day administration first dose either VRC01 placebo . During ATI , participant monitor closely clinical laboratory indication resume ART . These criterion design protect subject clinical , immunological , virological adverse effect ATI .</detailed_description>
