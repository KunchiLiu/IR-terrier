	<brief_summary>As individual grow old , number factor reduce cognitive ( think ) abilities `` normal '' age , neurodegenerative disease , cardiovascular disease . This study evaluate whether cognitive rehabilitation transcranial electrical stimulation ( TES ) improve cognitive ability . Cognitive rehabilitation refers method use improve task people trouble everyday life . Transcranial electrical stimulation use small amount electricity try alter brain functioning . These approach may help improve cognitive ability like attention , learning , memory , find word , problem solve well everyday function . The goal study identify best use method , either alone combination .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The primary objective study evaluate feasibility neurorehabilitation treatment tailor individual patient need , ultimate goal maximize cognitive real-world function old adult cognitive aging , mild cognitive impairment ( MCI ) , neurodegenerative , neurological diseases/conditions . Transcranial electrical stimulation ( TES ) non-invasive , neurorehabilitation procedure weak electric current pass electrode place scalp intention modulate excitability underlie brain region . Because field TES relatively young , rapidly evolve , primarily focus cognitive neuroscience `` healthy '' individual , clear need well-conceptualized conducted clinical research . The current protocol intentionally broad respect methodology patient characteristic order tailor potential TES intervention individual patient small sample . The current protocol utilize various form TES include transcranial direct current stimulation ( tDCS ) , alternate current stimulation ( tACS ) , random noise stimulation ( tRNS ) sham stimulation old adult . As cross-over design , participant may receive active ( `` real '' ) TES and/or sham TES conditions.This include head head comparison different form TES . Additionally , TES could perform conjunction cognitively-based intervention since may enhance neuroplastic response target brain region ( ) time shaping/optimizing pathway engage cognitively-based intervention . This broad approach important since etiological difference cognitive impairment may necessitate distinct intervention .</detailed_description>
