	<brief_title>Flaxseed Consumption Bone Metabolism Postmenopausal Women .</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Osteoporosis affect approximately 1 3 woman age 50 account day spend hospital diabetes breast cancer ; amongst woman age group ( Cosman , De Beur et al . 2014 ) . Aging , sedentary lifestyle , poor diet smoking risk factor ( Foundation 2003 ) . A healthy diet ( include food rich calcium , vitamin D phytoestrogens ) may protect osteoporosis risk fracture ( Go , Tserendejid et al . 2014 ) . Phytoestrogens diet putative benefit post menopause ( Mei , Yeung et al . 2001 ) . The term phytoestrogens describes wide variety plant food derive chemical structure similar estradiol ( oestrogen ) . The three main class phytoestrogens isoflavones , lignans coumestans . Oil seed good source lignans , flaxseed particularly rich . ( Weaver Cheong 2005 ) . Flaxseeds consumption previously associate change bone turnover marker postmenopausal woman ( Hutchins , Martini et al . 2001 ) . This study therefore design test hypothesis consumption quantity flaxseeds achievable individual 's habitual diet ( 40g ) induce improvement bone turnover marker , mediate increased circulation phytoestrogens , postmenopausal woman . . The study arm ) A placebo control arm , volunteer consume placebo 40g porridge ( match fibre fat flaxseed product ) every day 12 week , ii ) 40g flaxseed add 40g porridge daily 12 week study period . Adherence intervention assess via analysis concentration mammalian lignans enterolactone enterodiol urine . The primary outcome study change marker bone health . The secondary outcome study change urinary plasma androgen . Volunteers need attend Hugh Sinclair Unit Human Nutrition clinical unit four occasion facilitate screen study visit . Volunteers require provide fast blood ( 30ml ; 2 tablespoon ) ; 24 hr urine ( start day prior study visit ) faecal sample 3 study visit ( baseline , week 6 12 ) . As vitamin D status bone turnover marker related bone health , volunteer give opportunity undergo additional measurement total body composition use dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry ( DXA ) baseline week 12 .</detailed_description>
