	<brief_summary>Background : Arginine vasopressin ( AVP ) hormone make body . It make negative feeling stronger . The way AVP regulate may abnormal people mood anxiety disorder . SRX246 new drug block receptor AVP brain cell . Researchers want study drug affect way people respond threat anxiety . Objectives : To see new drug SRX246 affect people respond threat unpleasant shock . Eligibility : Healthy adult age 21-50 Design : Participants screen another protocol . Participants 4 visit 4 week . At visit 1 , participant small electrode tap arm give shock . Electrodes arm , chest , face measure sweat , heart rate , blink . Participants hear loud noise get test shock 15 minute . At 3 visit , participant test : - Blood urine test - Heart test - Suicide screen At visit , participant answer question mood anxiety . They identify emotion picture . They shock test 40 minute : hear loud sound headphone get shock . Participants take study pill 2 time day week visit 1 week visit 3 . One week SRX246 . The week placebo . Participants may contact daily remind take medicine . Participants either follow-up visit follow-up phone call .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Effects SRX246 , Vasopressin Receptor ( V1a ) Antagonist , Experimental Model Fear Anxiety Humans</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Objective : The objective proposal determine effect SRX246 , candidate anxiolytic investigational new drug , fear anxiety base fear-potentiated startle human . Additionally , effect compound emotion recognition explore . The compound first-in-class , highly selective , orally available , CNS penetrate vasopressin ( V1a ) receptor antagonist develop Azevan Pharmaceuticals Inc . The anti-fear anti-anxiety activity twice daily dose 5-7 day SRX246 evaluate healthy male female subject use behavioral paradigm phasic ( fear ) sustain ( anxiety ) aversive state derive experimental model human pre-clinical study rodent . Subjects also undergo computerized behavioral task assess neurocognitive processing emotion . Study population : The study population consist 47 healthy male female volunteer age 21-50 diverse racial ethnic background . Design : The study use double-blind , cross-over design subject receive placebo 180 mg every morning/120 mg every evening ( total 300mg every day ) SRX246 5-7 day test ( give counter-balanced order ) . We examine effect drug potentiation startle use well-established paradigm involve anticipation no-shock , predictable shock , unpredictable shock . Drug effect emotion recognition also explore . Outcome measure : The main outcome measure startle potentiation task magnitude startle reflex retrospective anxiety condition ; secondary measure skin conductance subjective anxiety . Latency accuracy emotion recognition measure Emotional Expression Multimorph Task .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>INCLUSION CRITERIA : Healthy male female volunteer , age 2150 , inclusive . Subjects able give consent sign informed consent form indicate understand purpose procedure study willing participate study procedure restriction . Body mass index ( BMI ) 18.5 34.0 kg/M ( 2 ) , inclusive , total body weight &gt; 50kg ( 110 pound ) . EXCLUSION CRITERIA : NonEnglish speaker Current history Axis I psychiatric disorder ( ) identify Structured Clinical Interview DSMIVTR , nonpatient edition ( SCIDnp ) clinical evaluation . Active history active suicidal ideation . Lifetime alcohol drug dependence accord Structured Clinical Interview DSMIVTR , nonpatient edition ( SCIDnp ) . All prescription nonprescription medication herbal remedy prohibit within 7 day 5 halflives ( whichever longer ) prior first dose study medication least 7 day 5 halflives ( whichever longer ) last dose study medication , except hormonal contraceptive female . Clear evidence firstdegree relative history psychosis , bipolar disorder major depression determine family history method ; specifically , participant know diagnosis treatment order confirm presence disorder . Subject currently participate another clinical trial ( ) expose investigational noninvestigational drug device , do within precede month . Current evidence history significant medical illness organic brain impairment , include syndrome inappropriate antidiuretic hormone secretion ( SIADH ) , diabetes insipidus ( DI ) , stroke , epilepsy , CNS tumor , demyelinate disease , cardiac , pulmonary , gastrointestinal , renal hepatic impairment would likely interfere action , absorption , distribution , metabolism , excretion SRX246 , influence psychophysiological response . Current evidence median nerve entrapment carpal tunnel syndrome . Any laboratory abnormality investigator judgment consider clinically significant ( ECG , TSH , LFT , etc. ) . Abnormal urine specific gravity ( 1.00 1.03 ) document urine sample refractometry . Subject rest blood pressure outside systolic blood pressure range 90140 mmHg diastolic blood pressure outside range 5090 mmHg two consecutive measurement take 10 minute apart . Subject rest pulse rate great 100 bpm less 50 bpm two consecutive measurement take 10 minute apart . Pregnancy , lactating/breastfeeding , positive pregnancy test . * A history significant drug allergy systemic allergic disease ( e.g. , urticaria , atopic dermatitis ) , known/suspected hypersensitivity SRX246 , allergy gelatin . Lack measurable startle response ( 3 time baseline EMG activity ) least 5 9 startle use habituation visit . Subjects would noncompliant visit schedule study procedure . Possible noncompliance may include planned vacation plan hospitalization study . For woman able get pregnant men able father child , unwillingness use least two effective birth control method 15 day prior time enroll study , 15 day last exposure study drug . Effective method contraception study include : 1. hormonal contraception ( birth control pill , inject hormone vaginal ring ) , 2. intrauterine device , 3. barrier method ( condom diaphragm ) combine spermicide , 4. surgical sterilization ( hysterectomy , tubal ligation , vasectomy ) . Employee NIMH immediate family member NIMH employee . A urine pregnancy test perform visit . Since test might detect early stage pregnancy ( i.e . maximum 10 day period fertilization implantation ) , woman childbearing age exclude study agree contraceptive measure .</criteria>
