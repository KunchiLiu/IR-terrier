	<brief_summary>EGPA ( Eosinophilic Granulomatosis Polyangiitis , previously Churg-Strauss syndrome ) rare vasculitis , characterise asthma , rhinosinusitis eosinophilia . There previously confusion around diagnostic criterion , multiple set classification criterion use inappropriately diagnosis . The ERS form taskforce produce specific diagnostic criterion , divide Churg-Strauss Syndrome cohort two group - vasculitic EGPA tissular Hypereosinophilic Asthma Systemic Manifestations ( HASM ) . It known group separate diagnostic criterion also separate clinical symptomatology , disease course varies , could significant impact management research .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Eosinophilic Granulomatosis With Polyangiitis Cohort</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Background Eosinophilic Granulomatosis Polyangiitis ( EGPA , previously Churg-Strauss Syndrome ) rare , idiopathic , ANCA associate vasculitis ( AAV ) , alongside Granulomatosis Polyangiitis ( GPA ) Microscopic Polyangiitis ( MPA ) . It eosinophilic small/medium vessel vasculitis characterise asthma , rhinosinusitis eosinophilia . Patients also suffer renal , cardiac , gastrointestinal neurological involvement . First describe Churg Strauss 1951 , exact epidemiology remain difficult lack clear diagnostic criterion . It appear prevalence around 11-13 per million population mean age 50 year old represent 10 % diagnosed vasculitides . Following Churg Strauss ' original paper , first attempt provide diagnostic clarity provide John Lanham 1984 . Lanham list symptom see set patient EGPA suggest symptom require disease symptom `` additional '' . The American College Rheumatology ( ACR ) 1990 publish list 6 symptom assist classification vasculitides , create compare 20 patient EGPA 787 patient forms vasculitis . This frequently use diagnosis despite intended classification . In 1994 , revise 2012 , International Chapel Hill Consensus Conference produce nomenclature definition vasculitides , frequently incorrectly use diagnostic criterion . Finally , 2014 , diagnostic criterion provide European Respiratory Society Churg Strauss Syndrome ( ERS-CSS ) taskforce ; however publish literature still use variety criterion . EGPA recognise Th2 predominant disease elevate level IL-4 , IL-5 , IL-13 IgE accord number case control study case report . Association IL-10 level ANCA negative EGPA report . Th17 responses also seem elevate raise serum IL-25 report , potentiate Th2 cytokine release . Eosinophil product detectable serum , BAL , urine biopsy vary time-courses . Roles cell regulatory T cell , memory T cell , dendritic cell , macrophage , ILCs others investigate . Previous work within investigator ' unit demonstrate disturbance coagulation system patient asthma . The investigator demonstrate , moderate asthma appear favour fibrinolysis , severe asthma fibrinogenic condition . Deposition fibrin within airway fatal asthma previously recognise , case study demonstrate strong activation coagulation system five day prior exacerbation . Another case study demonstrate increased activation coagulation system patient active EGPA normalise remission , depth work do . It previously recognise ANCA positive patient often different disease phenotype ANCA negative , suffer vasculitic symptom renal disease less cardiac involvement . In 2014 ERS-CSS taskforce provide diagnostic criterion two main phenotype - separate vasculitic phenotype remain call Eosinophilic Granulomatosis Polyangiitis ( EGPA ) , ANCA negative tissular phenotype call Hypereosinophilic Asthma Systemic Manifestations ( HASM ) . It currently unclear distinction match biological endotypes , whether different treatment strategy advisable two group . It possible HASM precursor state full vasculitic EGPA , however increase incidence cardiac manifestation within group would point away , would differ prevalence genetic marker IL-10 promoter activation . Prior advent corticosteroid use , prognosis EGPA poor mortality rate 50 % 3 month . Treatment primarily consist immunosuppression corticosteroid , induction therapy use cyclophosphamide severe case . Rituximab approve use GPA MPA , case report demonstrate good effect patient severe , refractory EGPA , uncontrolled therapy . Those suffer CSS expose prolonged steroid therapy majority patient experience side effect medication weight gain , osteopaenia , impair glucose tolerance , cataracts skin atrophy . Steroid spar agent azathioprine mycophenolate use variable effect . Treatment primarily guide eosinophil count symptom score Birmingham Vasculitis Activity Score ( BVAS ) currently diagnostic test EGPA-specific biomarkers . Presence specific biomarker would allow accurate alteration patient ' mediation , non-specific symptom imitate EGPA prompt increase steroid dos . Research question Do ERS-CSS diagnostic criterion divide PHT cohort group distinct clinical characteristic ? How EGPA HASM group differ clinical physiological characteristic change time ? Potential impact If investigator confirm EGPA HASM represent distinct clinical entity within cohort , research biological mechanism treatment option need , work help guide study .</detailed_description>
