	<brief_summary>Background : Patients suffer residual disability anterior decompression fusion ( ACDF ) surgery cervical disc disease may prescribe physical activity ( PPA ) neck-specific exercise ( NSE ) . Currently , lack data success either approach . There also knowledge-gap concern use internet-based care chronic neck pain , inclusive cervical disc disease . The scarcity data , high proportion patient various degree incapacity follow ACDF , warrant increase effort investigate improve cost-effective rehabilitation . Objective : To investigate effectiveness structure , internet-based NSE program , versus PPA follow ACDF surgery . Methods : This prospective , randomise , experimental , longitudinal multicentre study , include 140 patient residual disability ( ≥30 % Neck Disability Index ; NDI ) follow ACDF radiculopathy due cervical disc disease . Patient recruitment occur follow attendance routine clinical appointment , schedule 3-months post-surgery . Patients randomise one two group ( 70 patients/group ) , schedule 3-month treatment either internet-based NSE PPA . Questionnaires background data , pain discomfort , physical mental capacity , satisfaction care , health workplace factor complete , physical measurement neck-related function perform independent test leader blind randomisation . Measurements perform inclusion , 3-month treatment ( end treatment ) , 2-year follow-up . Radiography complete 2-year follow-up . Preoperative data collect Swedish Spine Registry ( Swespine ) . Data healthcare consumption , drug use , sick leave request relevant national register .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The purpose study investigate whether internet-based , structured NSE , differs PPA surgery cervical disc disease , relation function , pain , work capacity , health-related quality life , satisfaction care , cost effectiveness . The hypothesis internet-based NSE superior term outcome measure PPA . This assumption , base earlier study patient chronic WAD , remain untested individual residual disability follow ACDF . The project expect lead improve care , well-being , patient satisfaction , , result , reduce societal burden . Design This prospective , randomise , experimental longitudinal multicentre study , two-year follow-up . Questionnaires distribute physical measurement take baseline , end treatment ( 3 month enrolment ) , 2 year . Preoperative data collect Swespine . Patients recruit surgical unit follow regular follow-up visit physiotherapist/surgeon approximately 3 month postoperatively . Should study criterion meet , receipt write oral informed consent , patient completes questionnaire undergoes physical measurement neck-related function . The patient randomise ( computerised block randomisation list compile statistician ) one two group 3 month treatment ) internet-based NSE 3 visit physiotherapist b ) PPA 3 visit physiotherapist . In addition , prior treatment , patient group examine physiotherapist , accordance Swedish law . The test leader physiotherapist surgical unit involve study treatment blind randomisation group . Qualified clinician perform X-rays ( potentially ) ultrasound registration . Following randomization result put opaque envelope contains name patient randomisation group , send physiotherapy outpatient care clinic . Questionnaires test physical neck-related function conduct baseline ( randomisation ) , 3 month ( treatment end ) , 2 year . Participant physiotherapist provide oral , write , practical training , able consult project manager time . Exercise diaries number care contact record group . Study criterion Inclusion criterion surgical department : • Record data Swespine Inclusion criterion surgery : - Cervical disc disease , confirm MRI data compatible clinical finding ( neurological examination perform neck surgeon i.e . neurosurgeon/orthopaedic surgeon ) show nerve root compression cervical spine . - Radiculopathy pain one arm , without sensory and/or motor deficit - At least 3 month persistent arm pain Inclusion criterion study : - ACDF due cervical disc disease ( disc herniation without osteophyte , stenosis cause osteophyte ) one two segmental level - Age 18-75 year - Residual disability ( approximately ) 3 month surgery ( re-visit surgeon/ physiotherapist neurosurgery/ neuroorthopedic clinic ) term Neck Disability Index ( NDI ≥30 % ) . - Access computer/tablet/smartphone Internet - Motivated exercise Exclusion criterion : - Myelopathy - Previous fracture dislocation cervical spine - Malignancy benign spinal tumour ( e.g . neuroma ) - Spinal infection , ongoing post-operative infection , previous spondylodiscitis - Previous cervical spine surgery - Factors contraindicate study participation hinder treatment follow-up systemic disease , physical mental illness , injury , inconvenience , postoperative complication . - Known alcohol/drug abuse - Lack ability write/comprehend/or express oneself Swedish language Intervention Internet-based neck-specific exercise ( NSE ) Participants provide explanation justification exercise . Training include exercise activate deep neck muscle ( initially daily ) , continue endurance training neck shoulder muscle ( 3 times/week ) . Exercise tailor individual 's physical condition , scale progressively term severity dose . Participants undertake three visit physiotherapist , exercise introduce repeat , order establish control patient comprehension . The exercise complete help internet support outside healthcare system , access anywhere , probably home . Photos video exercise , information , answer frequently ask question available internet-support platform . Patients contact physiotherapist e-mail necessary . Three visit physiotherapist provided addition mandatory first visit ( new clinical investigation require Swedish law ) . At end treatment period , patient encourage continue practicing exercise . Prescribed physical activity ( PPA ) The training consist general , physical , land-based activity ( 3 times/week ) . The aim find physical activity outside care unit suit individual , base specific need problem . The goal individual increase overall level physical activity , activity perform part self-care/wellness routine . This may involve activity perform home , walk accord set schedule , home exercise give physiotherapist ( neck-specific training ) , aerobic class etc . To increase compliance , simple motivational interview perform PPA schedule provide , occur session separate visit , physiotherapist patient prefer . Patients advise contact physiotherapist prescribed activity fail work another activity identify . Three visit physiotherapist provided addition mandatory first visit ( new clinical investigation require Swedish law ) , patient encourage continue practice end treatment period . Sample size calculation statistic Seventy participant per group ( i.e . total 140 patient ) require . Sample size calculation ( conduct statistician ) base primary outcome measure Neck Disability Index ( NDI ) . In order detect clinically relevant improvement 7 % ( 3.5 point ) NDI scale , 70 participant per group need ( assume 80 % power , level significance 5 % ) . This calculation base group difference record previous study . These include study individual chronic whiplash-associated injury offer training , well study investigate benefit surgery physical therapy cervical disc disease . As lack study rehabilitation patient disability ACDF , calculation remain hypothetical sample size may need adjust first 30 people ( 15/group ) complete 3-month follow-up . This number also adjust event participant dropping-out , least 70 individual per group complete intervention . Data analyse use intention-to-treat approach . Alternative analysis ( sub-group analysis ) carry degree implementation treatment ( compliance ) take account , well sex , dizziness , headache , neurological finding , number segmental level operate . Analyses perform use parametric non-parametric statistic , depend type data , consultation statistician appropriate . Ultrasound registration , electromyography , Magnetic Resonance Imaging kinesthesia may do sub-group participant investigate neck muscle structure function . Interviews may do sub-group individual regard function , experience opinion . Ethical consideration This study approve Regional Ethical Review Board Linköping Ref : 2016 / 283-31 . The scientist independent commercial tie . Patients recruit provide informed consent . Patient data present group level connection individual make . All data anonymised report , subject Official Secrets Health Acts . The test leader independent blind randomisation . Exercises , general neck-specific , use extensively clinical practice anticipate harm implementation risk muscle soreness . Any important harm unintended effect group collect test leader . All questionnaires test material encode research group , code list store lock , fireproof file cabinet , house university room control ( card-based ) access . Only individual receipt unique website address post researcher access program ; patient neither communicate caregiver via program .</detailed_description>
