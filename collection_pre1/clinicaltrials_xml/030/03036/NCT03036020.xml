	<detailed_description>Background Stroke third lead cause death western country , major cause adult disability leave two third stroke survivor struggle moderate severe disability . Stroke affect approximately 15 million people worldwide year . Up 90 % stroke ischemic ( cerebral infarction ) , mostly due acute thromboembolic obstruction cerebral artery , whereas around 10 % strokes cerebral hemorrhage . Acute ischemic stroke must consider medical emergency , early recanalization obstruct artery must attempt . The intravenous drug alteplase ( Actilyse® ) , recombinant human tissue type plasminogen activator , approve use within 4.5 hour symptom start ischemic stroke . The early treatment initiate , however , good odds good outcome . A cerebral infarction differentiate cerebral hemorrhage without neuroradiological investigation . If patient acute cerebral hemorrhage treat thrombolysis may fatal . Therefore , contrary setting cardiac infarction , intravenous thrombolysis cerebral infarction perform in-hospital computer tomography ( CT ) , magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) , scan brain . The consequence obligatory radiological examination unavoidable time delay ischemic stroke patient actually treat within `` golden 90 minute '' symptom onset . The way avoid , brain , detrimental time delay logical ; establish diagnosis ischemic stroke outside hospital time near symptom onset possible . Subsequently open possibility early prehospital thrombolytic treatment much high number patient . Minimizing prehospital time delay proven positively influence thrombolytic rate acute ischemic stroke . However , recent study telemedicine-equipped ambulance ( telestroke ambulance ) show prehospital real-time stroke severity assessment hospital-based stroke physician ambulance transport technical acceptable stability clinical use . In Berlin study use `` actor stroke patient '' move ambulance , acceptable clinical evaluation 40 % patient achieve . A recent clinical stroke study University Saarland , Germany , however , demonstrate concept prehospital stroke diagnosis feasible . Using specially design mobile stroke unit ( MSU ) , car ambulance equip stroke neurologist , CT scanner point care biochemical laboratory , time symptom onset diagnostic therapeutic decision thrombolysis reduce 76 35 minute . The CT scanner MSU show provide brain scan high quality 95 % case allow differentiation cerebral infarction cerebral hemorrhage . No safety radiation issue occur either staff patient . The time delay stroke diagnostics may reduce early radiological diagnosis , also need reliable clinical recognition stroke symptom . The reliability National Institutes Health Stroke Scale ( NIHSS ) establish several clinical trial perform trained neurologist . Dewey et al proved 1999 trial `` Inter-rater reliability National Institutes Health Stroke scale : Rating Neurologists Nurses Community-Based stroke Incidence study '' overall agreement NIHSS scoring trained nurse trained neurologist different agreement neurologist . The study suggest trained nurse could administer NIHSS reliability similar stroke- trained neurologist . Aims The main aim NASPP study ass efficacy safety prehospital diagnosis stroke use Norwegian stroke ambulance concept . NASPP aim demonstrate anesthesiologist train pre-hospital critical care may perform acute stroke diagnostics clinical assessment CT scan interpretation integrate skill already exist organizational frame Norwegian prehospital EMS system . NASPP systematically explore Norwegian model prehospital acute stroke diagnostics prior implementation prehospital thrombolytic stroke treatment . NASSP equip regular ambulance staff specially trained anesthesiologist specialize nurse . NASPP perform clinical part study close co-operation Østfold Hospital , Fredrikstad . Hypothesis Cerebral CT examination anesthesiologist train prehospital care ; feasible accurate stroke ? An anesthesiologist train pre-hospital care able perform , ass transfer teleradiology cerebral CT scan patient present stroke symptom last 4 hour . The performance anesthesiologist compare independent assessment may radiologist neurologist admission hospital , neuroradiologist . The prehospital diagnosis ischemic stroke anesthesiologist train prehospital critical care - new concept . An anesthesiologist train pre-hospital critical care make accurate prehospital clinical radiological diagnosis acute ischemic stroke , enable early prehospital thrombolytic treatment . Long-term prognostic value NIHSS assessment prehospital phase ischemic stroke . To assess prehospital NIHSS score may predict long-term ( 3 month ) patient outcome assess modify Rankin Scale ( mRS ) , acute stroke patient treat treated thrombolysis . Design NASPP observational cross-sectional study , design test efficiency accurancy prehospital diagnostics acute stroke Norwegian stroke ambulance concept . NASPP consider pilot study , due paucity data literature lack exist medical experience . NASPP aim include 200 patient . Methods material : Clinical study Cerebral CT examination anesthesiologist train prehospital care ; feasible accurate stroke ? Prehospital ischemic stroke diagnostics anesthesiologist trained prehospital critical care - new concept . After complete preclinical study aim prove anesthesiologist train pre-hospital critical care perform `` state art '' prehospital acute stroke diagnostics . Patient care delivery conduct specially design stroke ambulance operate Østfold Hospital , Fredrikstad . The stroke ambulance respond patient age 18 contact 113 emergency dispatch center present symptom paresis arm leg , facial paresis , visual speech disturbance ( Norwegian Index medical emergency chapter 27.03-27.05 ) . The local dispatch center send stroke ambulance emergency turnout patient . The stroke ambulance operate 08.00 20.00 p.m. weekday study period , practical economical consideration . The stroke ambulance respond patient localize 10 -15 minute drive hospital , make sure time lose live close proximity hospital . The dispatch center simultaneously alarm on-call neurologist Østfold Hospital , Fredrikstad . The Norwegian Air Ambulance Foundation organize train stroke ambulance crew ( anesthesiologist nurse train prehospital care ) . The training course base preclinical trail , also include simulation training stroke ambulance . The ambulance anesthesiologist complete test interpretation cerebral CT scan acute stroke , NIHSS certification . The anesthesiologist nurse train operate biochemical point care laboratory ( glucose , platelet , INR Hb ) CT machine . The stroke ambulance respond patient stroke symptom meet inclusion criterion . A total 400 patient include , patient ask oral consent . If aphasic , reduced consciousness , patient include study . On site anesthesiologist rapid screen use ABCDE ` trauma care . If patient stable investigation proceed NIHSS score complete . The patient get two venous line , blood sample collect . Blood sample GFAP S-100 B store delivered laboratory hospital analysis . A circulatory stabile patient take stroke ambulance , CT scan perform . In circulatory unstable patient ambulance anesthesiologist decide perform CT scan head directly hospital . While CT scan take blood sample analyze point care laboratory . The ambulance anesthesiologist assess CT scan fill study form . The CT scan simultaneously send Østfold Hospital , Fredrikstad interpretation neurologist radiologist call . The patient transport hospital communication neurologist call follow standard procedure . The anesthesiologist report result NIHSS score CT scan , study form complete anesthesiologist research purpose . The ambulance anesthesiologist medically responsible patient hospitalization . The neurological team call provide medical care , appropriate start thrombolytic treatment patient admission . A neuroradiologist , without clinical knowledge , review CT scan study include least 400 patient . The result initial interpretation ambulance anesthesiologist hold anonymous , blinded neuroradiologist . The in-hospital write report collect review . The result analyze statistically show distribution different category inter-rater agreement , compare neurologist radiologist admission hospital . To test hypothesis anesthesiologist train pre-hospital critical care decide upon whether he/she would give thrombolytic treatment patient base upon clinical finding , anamnestic information , NIHSS score , laboratory test result CT scan interpretation . Therapy decision write study form , report hospital . Retrospectively therapy decision make anesthesiologist statistically compare therapy decision make in-hospital stroke team . We aim determine level inter-rater agreement stroke anesthesiologist in-hospital stroke team , regard decision thrombolysis diagnostics .</detailed_description>
