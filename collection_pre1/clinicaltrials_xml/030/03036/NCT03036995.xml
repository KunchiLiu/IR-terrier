	<brief_summary>Vitiligo depigmentation disorder affect 0.5 2 % general population . It acquire pigmentary disorder skin mucous membrane characterize circumscribed , depigmented macule patch . Apremilast phosphosdiesterase 4 ( PDE4 ) inhibitor show efficacy good tolerance rheumatoid arthritis psoriasis . Apremilast induces potent activation cyclic AMP ( cAMP ) pathway lead anti-inflammatory effect decrease response Th1 Th17 lymphocytes . Interestingly , cAMP pathway also well demonstrated main pathway promote melanogenesis induce differentiation proliferation melanocyte . The principal aim compare , 24 week treatment , efficacy Apremilast label dosage combination therapy narrow band UVB versus placebo therapy narrow band UVB repigmentation patient non-segmental vitiligo . Patients non-segmental vitiligo BSA &gt; 10 % patient Vitiligo stable slowly progressive 3 month , seek treatment Department Dermatology , University Hospital Nice , France recruit study . The Patients see consultation investigator , selection criterion check . All patient receive full body narrow UVB treatment , twice weekly session narrow UVB 24 week . From W24 W48 - All responders* receive narrow UVB treatment accord French clinical use i.e.twice weekly session narrowband UVB 24 week . - All responders* randomize receive either apremilast** 30mg BID placebo . - Response define increase least 30 % VASI score W24 compare baseline **Responders initially randomize placebo arm benefit titration At week 24 , non responder patient stop treatment study 4 week observationnal follow-up ( W28 ) . Observational Follow-up Phase - W48 W52 Four-week Observational Follow-up Phase subject complete study ( responder non responder ) discontinue study early .</brief_summary>
