	<brief_summary>This clinical trial study well recombinant human papillomavirus nonavalent vaccine work prevent human papillomavirus-related cancer adult woman kidney transplant . Vaccines make peptide human papillomavirus may help body build effective immune response kill tumor cell . Giving booster vaccination may make strong immune response prevent delay recurrence cancer .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Recombinant Human Papillomavirus Nonavalent Vaccine Preventing Human Papillomavirus-Related Cancer Adult Women After Kidney Transplant</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To assess human papillomavirus ( HPV ) vaccine-type-specific seroconversion rate 12-months post-transplantation among female live donor kidney transplant recipient receive &gt; = 1 dos recombinant human papillomavirus nonavalent vaccine ( Gardasil 9 HPV vaccine ) &gt; = 30 day prior transplantation . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . To evaluate follow female live donor kidney transplant recipient receive &gt; = 1 dos Gardasil 9 HPV vaccine &gt; = 30 day prior transplantation : HPV vaccine-type-specific seroconversion rate 12-months post-transplantation stratify : ) number dos ( 1 versus [ vs. ] 2 ) vaccine give pre-transplant ; b ) time elapse last vaccine dose transplant procedure ; c ) variation dose type post-transplant immunosuppressant medication ; ) differences human leukocyte antigen ( HLA ) histocompatibility donor recipient . II . To evaluate follow female live donor kidney transplant recipient receive &gt; = 1 dos Gardasil 9 HPV vaccine &gt; = 30 day prior transplantation : persistence stability HPV vaccine-type-specific geometric mean titer ( GMT ) 6 12-months post-transplantation , rise HPV vaccine-type-specific GMT 13-months posttransplantation visit ( 1-month third/booster vaccine dose ) . III . To evaluate follow female live donor kidney transplant recipient receive &gt; = 1 dos Gardasil 9 HPV vaccine &gt; = 30 day prior transplantation : vaccine safety profile allograft rejection/opportunistic infection stratify number vaccine dose time last vaccine dose transplant procedure . IV . To evaluate follow female live donor kidney transplant recipient receive &gt; = 1 dos Gardasil 9 HPV vaccine &gt; = 30 day prior transplantation : HPV detection sample cervix/vagina , oral cavity baseline ( pre-vaccination ) 6- 12-months post-vaccination , overall number vaccine dos ( 1 vs. 2 ) , sexual behavior , type-specific seroconversion rate , time elapse last vaccine dose transplant procedure . OUTLINE : Patients receive recombinant human papillomavirus nonavalent vaccine intramuscularly ( IM ) baseline approximately 30 day first dose . Patients receive booster 12 month kidney transplant .</detailed_description>
