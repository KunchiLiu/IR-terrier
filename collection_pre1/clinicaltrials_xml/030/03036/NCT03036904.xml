	<brief_title>Study Venetoclax Plus DA-EPOCH-R Treatment Aggressive B-Cell Lymphomas</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This clinical trial men woman aggressive B-Cell Lymphomas include : - Diffuse large B-cell lymphoma ( DLBCL ) , - B-cell lymphoma unclassifiable intermediate feature DLBCL Burkitt Lymphoma ( BL ) , - High grade B-cell lymphoma ( HGBCL ) , - Transformed indolent NHL ( TiNHL ) . The aggressive B-cell lymphoma enrol study recognize poor prognosis use conventional chemoimmunotherapy . DA-EPOCH-R alternative highly effective chemoimmunotherapy platform lymphoma may serve optimal chemotherapy backbone incorporation novel agent venetoclax . The Bcl-2 protein play significant role regulation cell death malignant cell . Overexpression Bcl-2 family protein associate chemo-resistance broad variety cancer , BCL2 abnormalities common aggressive B-cell Lymphomas . Venetoclax highly selective Bcl-2 family protein inhibitor bind Bcl-2 family proteins potentially overcome resistance enhance response therapy . This study design evaluate safety preliminary efficacy venetoclax combination DA-EPOCH-R . Subjects receive venetoclax conjunction six 21-day cycle DA-EPOCH-R. Dosing DA-EPOCH-R follow establish protocol . Venetoclax administer day 3 12 cycle 1 day 1 10 subsequent cycle . Following completion therapy , subject follow every three month two year . Subjects remove study due toxicity follow resolution stabilization toxicity .</detailed_description>
