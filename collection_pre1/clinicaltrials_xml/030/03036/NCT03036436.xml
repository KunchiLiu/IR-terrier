	<brief_summary>Participants take part 12 week intervention , least one follow 24 +/- 2 week . Each participant provide support , motivation professional guidance improve physical activity ( PA ) level give commercially available PA tracker . The PA tracker also include smartphone web-based application , participant upload exercise perform day , keep date goal use smartphone log computer . The aim study find useful effective technology support healthcare professional help cancer survivor become physically active . This study measure objective PA level participant start study end . The acceptability use intervention promote PA cancer survivor also investigate .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The overall aim determine feasibility specific PA intervention , combine technology professional input , cancer survivor population . Study Design : A single arm feasibility trial PA intervention use technology behavioural change theory tool achieve increase PA . Participants study receive 12 week intervention . Outcomes measured baseline , 12 week 24 week ( +/- 2 week ) post baseline . Patient recruitment : Participants recruit attend St. James ' Hospital oncology haematology service . Study personnel provide information patient assess eligibility . Informed consent gain participant . Sample size : Proposed sample size 60 ( base Sim Lewis , 2012 recommendation ) allow 20 % drop-out . Intervention : This study use commercially available 'Fitbit ' wearable technology pair smartphone application . PA goal prescribe qualified , chartered physiotherapist use American Cancer Society ( ACS ) guideline ( Doyle et al 2006 ) . Participants use Fitbit paired application 12 week . The Fitbit device tool motivation monitoring PA behaviours intervention . This study also use evidence-based psychological behavioural change theory . Behavioural change technique include 'self-monitoring behaviour ' , 'goal-setting ' , 'feedback behaviour ' 'information health consequence ' . Procedures : This study include time-points baseline , 12 week ( Intervention end ) 24 week post baseline ( +/- 2 week ( Follow-up ) . Pre-intervention : Consent PA measurement - Consent : Study personnel meet potential participant outpatient appointment . The agreement patient 's consultant exercise obtain patient information leaflet ( PIL ) provide . The researcher explain study give potential participant consent form patient information leaflet verbal explanation study . - Initial PA measurement : Participants consent give Actigraph PA monitor instruct wear 7 day measure baseline physical activity level . Participants wish consider study take PIL home , post back , receive Actigraph post . Baseline Session : Participants attend - 1 ) An educational session , deliver lead researcher , chartered physiotherapist . This group information session PA follow cancer treatment . - 2 ) Educational session introduce technological component participant instruct use upload Fitbit data allow monitoring researcher ( ) . - 3 ) Measurement height , weight , BMI body composition 6 minute walk test During intervention . ( week 1-12 ) - Participants wear Fitbit upload data self-monitoring monitoring charter physiotherapist researcher . - Participants receive schedule structure telephone call , give feedback achievement goal reminder upload data follow ; 2 call week till week 4 , 1 call week week 4 8 2 call , 2 week apart week 8 week 12 . After intervention end ( 12 week ) : - Measurement height , weight , BMI body composition 6 minute walk test - Participants wear Actigraph x 7 day 12 week end intervention : - Measurement height , weight , BMI body composition 6 minute walk test - Participants wear Actigraph x 7 day</detailed_description>
