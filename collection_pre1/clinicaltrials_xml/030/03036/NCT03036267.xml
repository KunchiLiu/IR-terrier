	<brief_summary>Asthma rate high asthma control greatly reduce Black , Medicaid-insured adult , due part poor adherence inhale corticosteroid ( ICS ) , turn may due erroneous health belief asthma negative belief regard ICS .

	<brief_title>BREATHE Asthma Intervention Trial</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Uncontrolled asthma disproportionally impact Black poor adult . Adherence inhale corticosteroid ( ICS ) , play significant role asthma control , relatively low poor minority population . Non-adherence ICS associate erroneous personal health belief regard asthma care negative belief regard ICS . Despite , intervention concurrently address belief regard asthma self-care ICS . Shared decision-making intervention test underserved Black adult , despite model 's success pediatric population White , privately insured patient asthma . Federally Qualified Health Centers ( FQHCs ) unique challenge help patient achieve asthma control overlook asthma intervention research . Process evaluation often lack intervention development . We address treatment methodological gap . Objectives : This pilot study ( 1 ) develop brief share decision-making intervention deliver primary care provider ( PCPs ) improve asthma control Black adult receive care FQHCs ; ( 2 ) evaluate intervention 's feasibility acceptability ; ( 3 ) ass preliminary evidence intervention effect asthma control , ICS adherence , force expiratory volume one second ( FEV1 ) - objective lung function measure - asthma quality life ( QOL ) 3-month follow-up period . Hypotheses : ( 1 ) The intervention feasible acceptable , ( 2 ) 3 month , relative control , patient whose PCPs train intervention significant improvement asthma control ( primary outcome ) , ICS adherence , FEV1 asthma QOL ( secondary outcome ) . Methods : Using community-based participatory research include Patient Advocate , develop intervention , Brief Evaluation Asthma Therapy ( BREATHE ) . Intervention development guide patient family/support person asthma patient input , well PCP feedback . We conduct randomize trial intervention 8 PCPs 2 FQHCs Philadelphia , PA ; PCP enroll 10 Black adult ( N=80 ) uncontrolled asthma , erroneous asthma care belief negative ICS belief . PCPs randomize within FQHC intervention control ; patient follow 3 month . Process evaluation interview patient PCPs obtain feedback regard intervention procedure . Significance : This study high public health significance ( 1 ) target highly vulnerable population poor asthma control - Black poor adult erroneous asthma care beliefs negative ICS belief ; ( 2 ) adapts model-based intervention develop novel intervention deliver PCPs simultaneously target erroneous asthma beliefs negative ICS belief , potential amplify intervention effect increase likelihood sustainability ; ( 3 ) include process evaluation , bridge gap science practice , aid design full-scale randomized control trial ( RCT ) .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>The intervention trial informed focus group Focus Group Adult patient persistent asthma love one adult patient persistent asthma ( prescribed ICS regardless whether use ICS ) receive care participate FQHCs Focus Group Patients persistent asthma love one patient persistent asthma age 18 OR NOT prescribe ICS NOT receive care participate FQHCs Intervention Patients must : 1 . Adults ( 18 year age old ) 2 . PCPdiagnosed persistent asthma 3 . Currently prescribe ICS 4 . Receiving asthma care participate FQHCs 5. Who screen positive uncontrolled asthma ; 6 . Have erroneous personal health and/or negative ICS belief . Interested participant meet first 4 criterion screen uncontrolled asthma use wellvalidated Asthma Control Questionnaire ( ACQ ) . The ACQ include 6 item asthma symptoms one objective measure pulmonary function : FEV1 . Selfreport item FEV1 use calculate summary ACQ score . ACQ score &gt; 1.5 positive predictive value 88 % identifying uncontrolled asthma clinical trial . Trained study staff obtain FEV1 use hand hold spirometer calibrate daily . Patients ACQ &gt; 1.5 screen belief associate ICS nonadherence use CAMA administer customized tablet allow immediate scoring . Intervention 1 . Participation focus group development phase 2 . NonEnglish speak ' 3 . Serious mental health condition ( e.g. , psychosis ) preclude completion study procedure confound analysis .</criteria>
