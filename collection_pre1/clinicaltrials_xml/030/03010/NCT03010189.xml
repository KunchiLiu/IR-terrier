	<brief_summary>Cluster headache one painful headache , characterize recur episode unilateral , periorbital pain , accompany autonomic symptom seem sympathetic parasympathetic origin . The pathophysiology behind condition largely unknown , increase evidence indicate hypothalamus play pivotal role . The headache attack come cluster bout ( hence name ) last three month , headache disappears least one month . 10-15 % chronic cluster headache . During attack , patient cranial sympathetic hypoactivity parasympathetic hyperactivity , whereas cranial parasympathetic hypoactivity remission phase . There emerge hypothesis headache attack elicit state autonomic hypoarousability , also support fact cluster attack occur night , patient sleep . The aim project study intercept sleep-wake cycle , autonomic tone occurrence headache attack , use actigraphy , heart-rate variability pupillometry . All method well validate , frequently use study sleep autonomic function . The study design case-control model 15 cluster headache patient undergo pupillometry , wear actigraph heart-rate variability-monitor two week , cluster bout remission phase . The actigraphy register nocturnal movement sleep quality , headache attack register press button actigraph . The pupillometry measure pupillary constriction dilation response light , reflex control autonomic nervous system . The heart-rate variability monitor fluctuation heart rate reflect sympathovagal balance cardiac control . All participant fill Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index registration . In addition , 15 healthy control undergo one session examination . The result study give valuable insight pathophysiology condition painful great impact patient ' quality life , also add knowledge relation headache , sleep autonomic nervous system .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Cluster headache ( CH ) primary headache recur episode unilateral , periorbital pain accompany unilateral autonomic symptom tear , conjunctival injection , nasal congestion rhinorrhea , miosis ptosis . Headache attack last 15 180 minute , patient may eight attack day . Most attack occur night midnight 04 a.m. Headache attack come recur bout last three month , headache disappears least one month . 10-15 % patient chronic cluster headache , mean pause bout . The condition prevalence 0.2 % affect men 3-4 time often woman . The combination unilateral headache autonomic symptom make CH interest disorder study view headache pathophysiology . Increasing amount evidence point hypothalamus locus quo CH pathophysiology . During attack , autonomic symptom seem cause hypofunction sympathetic activity ( miosis ptosis ) , hyperfunction parasympathetic activity ( conjunctival injection , tear nasal congestion ) . Physiological study seem imply patient bout upregulated parasympathetic activity cause activation trigemino-parasympathetic reflex downregulated sympathetic tone , outside bout downregulated parasympathetic tone . Studying autonomous nervous system cluster headache patient difficult , usually headache month year attack quite short lasting , excruciate painful occur , leave patient restless urge move . This make difficult study actually happen painful phase . Thus , find new way study autonomic nervous system patient various stage disease important . In addition autonomic dysfunction , sleep disturbance frequent well document CH patient . Sleep often problematic headache , CH patient seem high prevalence insomnia even compare headache population . This merely result recur nocturnal headache , CH patient significantly reduce sleep quality compare control even one year last headache attack . The documentation mostly consist study use well validate questionnaire Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index ( PSQI ) diagnostic criterion DSM IV . Only one major study assess sleep quality cluster headache use quantitative method polysomnography . In study , author find cluster headache patient headache bout reduce percentage REM sleep , long REM latency few arousal compare healthy control . There temporal relationship headache attack specific sleep stage . Sleep single important trigger attack cluster headache , attack occur late night early morning hour . We know balance sympathetic parasympathetic tone differ REM NREM-sleep stag healthy individual , transient decrease sympathetic tone night , reflect period reduce heart rate blood pressure . This `` dipping '' coincides increase occurrence cluster attack , fit well emerge theory cluster headache attack elicit state hypoarousability , reduce sympathetic tone . Thus , sleep disturbance , together autonomic dysfunction , integral part CH pathophysiology , study need elucidate association sleep , autonomic dysfunction headache attack . The aim study assess sleep quality autonomic tone CH patient inside outside headache bout , compare healthy control . Inside bouts , investigator assess occurrence headache attack relate autonomic tone . The data gather use actigraphy , pupillometry heart-rate variability , well validate research tool . In addition , participators fill PSQI report subjective sleep quality . Pupillometry : The pupillary response light conduct autonomous nervous system . In short , constriction pupil parasympathetic response , pupillary redilation sympathetic response . By measure velocity constrict dilate pupil , get good view balance two . The measurement make 1 lux ambient darkness pupillometer consist infra-red camera film pupil respond small light flash , measure time pupil take contract redilate . Heart-rate variability : Heart-rate variability ( HRV ) indirect , non-invasive way measure autonomic nervous system activity , contribution sympathetic parasympathetic nervous system . Frequency-specific fluctuation heart rate assess power spectrum analysis . The high frequency component ( HF : 0.15-0.4 Hz ) reflect vagal control , whereas low frequency component ( LF : 0.04-0.15 ) reflect sympathetic control . The LF/HF ratio reflect sympathovagal balance . Reduced Heart-rate variability associate increased mortality patient myocardial infarction heart failure . A simple computer place forearm combine monitor place chest , give minimal discomfort patient , may measure heart rate variability . Actigraphy : Polysomnography gold standard sleep assessment , quite extensive resource intensive method . In late year , new technology make actigraphy reliable easy way measure sleep less invasive manner . An actigraph small , wrist-watch-sized device monitor movement use accelerometer track motion create graph . In addition , button push mark event bedtime waketime . Actigraphs widely use study sleep-wake cycle circadian rhythm . Several study compare actigraphy polysomnography assessment e.g . insomnia sleep disturbance , find valid cost-effective alternative . The Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index : There several self-report questionnaire available measure subjective sleep quality , Pittsburgh sleep quality index one best validate widely use alternative . PSQI measure retrospective subjective sleep quality disturbance last month . The study conduct case-control study , compare patient healthy control , also compare patient headache bout . The patient undergo pupillometry , actigraphy HRV registration twice : remission phase , headache phase . Pupillometry conduct out-patient clinic . Here , participant also receive actigraph HRV-monitor . Each registration last two week , actigraph , form watch , place patient 's wrist record movement day night , heart rate monitor form belt record heart rate variability . Software available interpret data make possible measure sleep vasoactive tone . After two week , patient fill PSQI , report subjective sleep quality , may compare registration actigraph . To register headache phase , patient must willing contact study researcher give notice bout begin , may come receive actigraph . The patient ask mark occurrence attack registration press button actigraph . The healthy control undergo pupillometry , actigraphy HRV monitoring , fill PSQI registration . The PSQI also register use sleep pill , may use patient control . For two week registration , average number hour daylight note , may influence sleep quality patient . These data give Norwegian Meteorological Institute .</detailed_description>
