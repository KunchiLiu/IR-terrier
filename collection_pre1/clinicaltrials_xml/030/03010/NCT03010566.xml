	<brief_title>Lung Volume Reduction Coil Microbiome Study</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Patients severe emphysema hyperinflation benefit lung volume reduction technique design reduce gas trapping , improve air flow , restore natural chest wall lung mechanic . The best evidence exist lung volume reduction surgery ( LVRS ) , recently increase interest , use , bronchoscopic lung volume reduction ( BLVR ) technique . One intrigue method use endobronchial lung volume reduction coil ( LVRCs ) , nitinol wire deploy lung take preform shape similar tennis ball seam , seem work mechanical compression lung tissue replace elastic recoil force lose emphysematous destruction lung tissue . Treatment aim place 10 coil upper lobe 2 procedure separate 1-3 month . A number study use LVRCs publish , provide relatively short term follow-up safety data . Fairly widespread clinical use LVRC occur Germany , however . It increasingly recognise minority patient treat LVRCs ( approximately 5-10 % ) develop dense consolidation around one device , development significant cavitation patient . At least 1 death attribute decline associate development change , number patient developed infection persistent resistant organism . Unlike endobronchial valve ( currently widely use BLVR device ) , patient tell LVRC treatment permanent device remove implantation , something obviously implication device become infected colonised micro-organism . The lung microbiome complete collection microorganism inhabit lung , include bacteria , virus , fungi . Studies demonstrate importance microorganism pathogenesis chronic obstructive pulmonary disease ( COPD ) , drive exacerbation loss lung function , lungs patient severe COPD ( potentially suitable LVRC treatment ) contain different community bacteria healthy people . Culture-independent molecular technique available precise cataloguing lung microbiome , result far detailed informative standard culture technique . By DNA sequence 16S rRNA gene use barcode identify bacterial organism give sample also relative proportion , much broad , less selective group bacteria assay . The bilateral sequential nature LVRC treatment provide unique opportunity collection multiple sample patient different time point treatment , thus track change lung microbiome may cause LVRC implantation . It practice perform bronchoscopy 6 month initial treatment patient undergone BLVR ( LVRCs , endobronchial valve , thermal vapour ablation ) order monitor device migration , granulation tissue formation , obtain specimen bacterial culture . This therefore mean LVRC patient undergo bronchoscopy 3 occasion , space approximately 3 month apart .</detailed_description>
