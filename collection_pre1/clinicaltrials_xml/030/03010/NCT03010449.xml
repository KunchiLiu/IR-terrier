	<brief_title>LVR Severe Emphysema Using Bronchoscopic Autologous Blood Instillation Combination With Intra-bronchial Valves</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease ( COPD ) umbrella term encompass two entity cause progressive ultimately disable breathlessness . Emphysema process destructive airspace distal terminal bronchiole , loss gas exchange tissue , elastic recoil circumferential tether small airway lead collapse forced expiration . Chronic bronchitis disorder bronchus cause excess production impair mobilisation mucus . Increased parasympathetic tone progressive remodelling airway impair response bronchodilator . Static dynamic hyperinflation persistently expand chest flatten diaphragm despite increase use accessory respiratory muscle result disadvantage respiratory pump . Patients severe emphysema hyperinflation may benefit lung volume reduction technique design reduce gas trap improve airflow , chest wall lung mechanic . The best evidence exist lung volume reduction surgery ( LVRS ) , however without risk increase interest development bronchoscopic lung volume reduction ( BLVR ) techniques include emplacement intra-bronchial valve bronchoscopic instillation blood product , show individually improve lung function , exercise capacity , quality life . Most experience bronchoscopic lung volume reduction endobronchial valve introduce 2001 . One-way valve insert segmental airway deflate emphysematous lobe lung , allow compromise less diseased tissue expand regain function . Reduction hyperinflation improve lung function , exercise capacity , quality life , observe use intra-bronchial valve ( IBV Valve System ) Olympus patient upper lobe-predominant emphysema . These improvement pronounce radiologically intact lobar fissure , surrogate observation think indicate absence collateral ventilation , confirm use Chartis balloon catheter system . A combined approach CT fissure analysis Chartis measurement suggest ensure appropriate selection patient . Bronchoscopic instillation biological agent fibrinogen , thrombin autologous blood sub-segmental airway induces lung volume reduction initially airway obstruction resorption atelectasis follow localised inflammatory reaction lead tissue remodelling alveolar level , fibrosis contraction target lobe . Unlike intra-bronchial valve , collateral ventilation issue , seem influence outcome . The cost compare favourably prosthetic implant . Preliminary data phase 1 2 trial use fibrinogen thrombin patient upper lobe-predominant emphysema demonstrate improvement lung function , exercise capacity , quality life score 6 month trend towards well outcomes receive 20mls ( versus 10mls ) eight sub-segmental site ( four per upper lobe ) . Most patient experience self-limiting inflammatory reaction characterise fever , malaise , shortness breath , pleuritic chest pain and/or leucocytosis within 24 hour . 11 50 patient ( 22 % ) phase 2 experience procedure-related COPD exacerbation comparable form endoscopic lung volume reduction . Similar physiological symptomatic outcome observe patient homogeneous emphysema 20mls ( versus 10mls ) per sub-segment instillation . Bakeer et al compare bronchoscopic lung volume reduction patient heterogeneous emphysema use autologous blood ( n=7 ) fibrin glue ( n=8 ) . At 12 week , statistically significant improvement hyperinflation , lung function , exercise capacity ( 6MWT ) , quality life score observe group . COPD exacerbation few compare early study , author suggest may due use triple lumen balloon catheter protect surround sub-segments overspill unintended inflammatory response . The prospect broadening eligibility intra-bronchial valve implantation include collateral ventilation treat autologous blood attractive yet study . Furthermore , mechanisms action intra-bronchial valve autologous blood instillation fully understood may extend beyond lung volume reduction . In valve procedure volume reduction achieve , clinically meaningful improvement quality life independent lung function describe . Recruitment compress lung , restoration elastic recoil redirection airflow postulate effect likely involve small airway . This may investigate , example , multiple breath nitrogen washout ( MBNW ) sensitive marker small airways disease measure ventilation inhomogeneity , functional residual capacity estimate trap gas volume . Impulse oscillometry ( IOS ) yield information airway resistance reactance ( measure compliance ) distinguish large small airway resistance .</detailed_description>
