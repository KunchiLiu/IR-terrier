	<brief_title>PriMatrix Management Diabetic Foot Ulcers</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>A diabetic foot ulcer ( DFU ) major health complication affect 15 % individual diabetes mellitus lifetime . The treatment DFUs extremely challenge ulcer may respond standard care ( SC ) treatment frequently become infected . Advanced wound therapy like PriMatrix become important strategy treatment hard-to-heal chronic DFUs trap bind patient ' cell rebuild dermis layer skin aid healing . The study evaluate efficacy PriMatrix Dermal Repair Scaffold closure DFUs subject diabetes mellitus comparison Standard Care treatment .</detailed_description>
