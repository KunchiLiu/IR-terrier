	<brief_summary>Among different social cue environment , eye constitute salient source initiate social interaction communication . Interestingly , previous work ( Prinsen et al. , 2016 ) lab demonstrate direct eye contact two individual readily evoke increase propensity 'mirror ' people ' action . Particularly , use transcranial magnetic stimulation ( TMS ) , investigator show mirror-motor mapping level primary motor cortex ( M1 ) , also know `` interpersonal motor resonance '' ( IMR ) , significantly increase upon observation action accompany direct eye contact , compare observation action accompany averted eye gaze . With present study , investigator aim investigate role eye contact IMR , particular , explore whether administration 'prosocial ' neuropeptide oxytocin ( OT ) influence eye-contact induced IMR . In general , OT know play important role promote prosocial behavior perception socially-relevant stimulus , eye gaze . To date however , link OT IMR less clear .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>In present study , investigator want explore single-dose intranasally administer OT modulate interpersonal motor resonance ( IMR ) and/or enhance effect eye contact IMR . To investigate effect exogenous OT administration , investigator adopt double-blind , within-subjects ( cross-over ) , randomize , placebo-controlled trial . The investigator recruit approximately 30 neurotypical young adult males 18 - 35 year old . Since cross-over design include , subject participate two session , separate one week . Participants randomly assign receive single dose OT ( 24 international unit ) placebo nasal spray first second session . In session , non-invasive brain stimulation technique 'transcranial magnetic stimulation ' ( TMS ) use level primary motor cortex obtain end-state measure unconscious 'mirror-motor mapping ' IMR . During TMS , participant observe video stimuli model perform simple , intransitive hand movement combine either direct avert gaze . Additionally , behavioral measure include : social attachment social responsiveness assess via self-report questionnaire eye track technology include monitor participant 's spontaneous gaze behavior . The main statistical analysis neurophysiological data within-subjects factor administer nasal spray ( OT PL ) , observe gaze direction ( direct avert gaze ) observe movement ( open hand movement movement ) . Furthermore , link neurophysiological ( TMS ) behavioral measure ( questionnaire data gaze behavior ) investigate .</detailed_description>
