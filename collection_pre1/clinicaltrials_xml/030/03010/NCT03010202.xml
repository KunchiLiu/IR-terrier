	<brief_title>The PROLONG Trial - Rituximab Maintenance Therapy ITP</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This multi-center , international , randomize , two-phase study : First phase ( induction phase ) open-label , hypothesis-generating , involve 1:1 randomization : rituximab ( group 1 ) rituximab plus dexamethasone ( group 2 ) determine response rituximab improve addition dexamethasone . Second Phase ( maintenance phase ) main part study , involve 1:1 double-blind randomization low dose rituximab placebo determine response achieve first phase prolong administrate maintenance treatment low dose rituximab . Primary objective : To determine maintenance therapy low-dose rituximab superior placebo prolong response among ITP patient achieve initial response rituximab . Secondary objective : 1 . To explore initial overall response rate , week 24 , improve least 10 % add dexamethasone rituximab ( induction phase ) . 2 . To assess safety study treatment , especially infectious episode ( induction &amp; maintenance phase ) . 3 . To assess bleed complication study ( induction &amp; maintenance phase ) . 4 . To assess use rescue medication platelet-elevating therapy study ( induction &amp; maintenance phase ) . 5 . To determine rate Complete Response ( CR ) induction phase sustain CR maintenance phase ( induction &amp; maintenance phase ) . 6 . To determine duration overall response CR ( induction &amp; maintenance phase ) . 7 . To assess health-related quality life fatigue ( induction &amp; maintenance phase ) .</detailed_description>
