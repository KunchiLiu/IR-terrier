	<brief_summary>It report smoker patient ( &gt; 400 cigarette/year ) suffer postoperative complication non-smoker patient lobectomy . Evidences suggest pulmonary rehabilitation could reduce pulmonary complication thoracic surgery . However , effect long-term result pulmonary rehabilitation smoker patient study . The purpose study determine whether pulmonary rehabilitation effective smoker patient underwent lobectomy .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Effect Pulmonary Rehabilitation Perioperative Outcomes Smoker Patients With Lung Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>In China , smoker population 300 hundred million . Tobacco become one world 's public health problem . 30 percent global surgery patient smoke history . It report smoker patient ( &gt; 400 cigarette/year ) suffer postoperative complication non-smoker patient lobectomy ( 38.2 % vs 12.5 % ) . Smoking independent risk factor postoperative complication cardiothoracic surgery . Evidences show smoke negative effect airway management play important role postoperative recovery thoracic surgery . Therefore , hypothesise intervention-related study find way reduce postoperative complication smoker patient significantly meaningful improve overall outcome pulmonary surgery 80 percent patient lung cancer smoker China . Recently , series strategy airway management propose clinical doctor . As one important part airway management , pulmonary rehabilitation demonstrate evidence-base medicine reduce pulmonary complication thoracic surgery increase breathing capacity . According report literature , effect long-term result pulmonary rehabilitation smoker patient study , design randomize control trial determine whether pulmonary rehabilitation would effective smoker patient underwent lobectomy associated significant loss lung function . According report paper China , main observation index experimental group 25.7 , control group 10 % . At level α=0.05 ( Bilateral ) , power test ( 1-β ) =0.80 , ratio=1:1 . The estimated minimum required sample size group 93 case , statistical loss rate set 10 % . The overall sample size study 200 case .</detailed_description>
