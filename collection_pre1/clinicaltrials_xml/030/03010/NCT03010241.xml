	<brief_summary>Background : Distal symmetric polyneuropathy ( DSPN ) common complication type 2 diabetes mellitus ( T2DM ) common form peripheral neuropathy . DSPN increase risk foot ulceration seven-fold , significant risk factor 60 % amputation low limbs patient T2DM . Reportedly , TCM may advantage relieve symptom reduce incidence DSPN exacerbations.We postulate patient DSPN benefit therapy TCM treatment accord syndrome differentiation . Methods design : A randomized , double-blind , placebo-controlled multi-centric clinical trial design use basis co-regimen mecobalamin . Subjects met inclusion criterion randomly divide two group . The patient study group treat Tangbi prescription , patient control group treat placebo . Treatment schedule 24 week . The sample size 188 cases.Major evaluation indicator : Changes Clinical Symptoms Signs Distal Symmetrical Polyneuropathy patients.The clinical symptom sign patient record Michigan Diabetic Neuropathy Score ( MDNS ) , change Michigan Diabetic Neuropathy Score ( MDNS ) compare two group medication . Secondary Evaluation Indicators : ① nerve conduction velocity change , The change nerve conduction velocity nerve compare take medicine.② Clinical symptom sign change , The clinical symptom sign patient compare take medicine . Discussion : We postulate patient DSPN benefit therapy TCM treatment .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>The Multi-Centric Clinical Study Chinese Medicine Intervention Diabetes Distal Symmetric Polyneuropathy .</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>1 . Purpose study Major objective : To evaluate efficacy traditional Chinese medicine ( Tangbi prescription ) improve clinical symptom patient diabetic distal symmetric polyneuropathy . Secondary objective : To evaluate effect traditional Chinese medicine ( Tangbi prescription ) nerve conduction velocity patient diabetic distal symmetric polyneuropathy . 2 . Experimental Measures contrast A randomized , double-blind , placebo-controlled multi-centric clinical trial design use basis co-regimen mecobalamin . The patient study group treat Tangbi prescription ( 1 dose / day , twice ) , patient treat placebo ( 1 dose / day , twice ) control group . Treatment schedule 24 week . The sample size determine 188 case statistic calculation . Sample size calculation basis : According preliminary study Antang-tongbi prescription data , placebo group scale ( Toronto TCSS scale ) score difference 3.45 , Tangbi prescription scale score 4.14 , public standard deviation = 1.33 . The sample size estimate hypothesis test formula measurement data : N = 2 * [ ( Zα + Zβ ) * δ / ] ^ 2 ( pp . 112-113 third edition Epidemiology ) ( n sample size σ estimate standard deviation , two group ' continuous variable mean difference ; Zα Zβ correspond standard normal difference ; Zα Zβ value , see Human Health Edition , Epidemiology , Third Edition , page 73 , Table 6.2 ) . Supposing= 0.05 , β = 0.10 , accord one-sided check table , quantile Zα = 1.64485 , Zβ = 0.84162 , put formula , result n = 78.10 . Therefore , group need 78 patient . Considering 20 % withdrawal rate , total number case 188 , 94 case group . 3 . Bias analysis The evaluation index study clinical symptom , affect many factor . Although many way treatment oral drug , exact evidence evidence-based medicine prove . Therefore , little factor impact bias evaluation result , conclude follow aspect : ( 1 ) blood glucose level . ( 2 ) exist treatment measure , ( 3 ) condition EMG determination . These influence factor address follow : ( 1 ) As blood glucose level factor , randomize , double-blind study design approach use ensure consistency factor two group . ( 2 ) subject take Methycobal reduce psychological effect patient efficacy curative effect increase patient compliance . ( 3 ) Train EMG doctor consistently , EMG determination fix , form SOP study . 4 . Research design 4.1 The design scheme A randomized , double-blind , placebo-controlled multi-centric clinical trial design use basis co-regimen mecobalamin . Subjects met inclusion criterion randomly divide two group . The patient study group treat Antang-tongbi prescription , patient control group treat placebo . Treatment schedule 24 week . The sample size 188 case . 4.2 Research Period Medication cycle 24 week . 4.3 curative effect evaluation criterion 4.3.1 Major evaluation indicator Changes Clinical Symptoms Signs Distal Symmetrical Polyneuropathy patient . The clinical symptom sign patient record Michigan Diabetic Neuropathy Score ( MDNS ) , change Michigan Diabetic Neuropathy Score ( MDNS ) compare two group medication . 4.3.2 Secondary Evaluation Indicators ① nerve conduction velocity change The change nerve conduction velocity nerve compare take medicine . ② Clinical symptom sign change The clinical symptom sign patient compare take medicine . 4.4 Curative effect observation indicator ① Nerve conduction velocity ( every 6 month ) . - MDNS scale ( every 3 month ) . 4.5 Observational Indicators ① Background observation ( 0 week ) 1 . Demographic data : gender , age , height , weight . 2 . General clinical data : medical history , course disease , treatment history , combine disease medication . - Diagnostic monitoring indicator 1 . Blood pressure , fast blood glucose test ( every 1 month ) . 2 . Glycated hemoglobin , blood lipid ( every 3 month ) . 4.6 Analysis relevant measure base bias analysis 4.7 Basic treatment ① Diabetes education ; - Diabetic diet ; - Rational control blood glucose : use oral hypoglycemic agent insulin injection keep patient blood glucose stable study . In principle , type dose hypoglycemic agent maintain unchanged . If fasting blood glucose fluctuate 20 % , diabetes expert need find remove predisposing factor soon possible , adjust dose monitor blood glucose change , blood glucose smooth 4 week . Adjusted dose drug need detailed record combine medication table . ④ Taking Mecobalamin tablet ( 1 / time , 3 time / day ) . ( Eisai ( China ) Pharmaceutical Co. , Ltd. ) 4.8 Provisions combine treatment 1 . All Chinese herbal medicine efficacy study drug ( include Chinese herbal medicine similar therapeutic indication Chinese herbal medicine similar efficacy ) ban study period . 2 . All combination therapy treatment ( treatment measure treatment medicine disease ) document combined medication table . - Besides Methycobal , drug treatment diabetic peripheral neuropathy prohibit , include α-lipoic acid , epalrestat , VitB12 .</detailed_description>
