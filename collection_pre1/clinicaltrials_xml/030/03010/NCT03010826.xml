	<brief_summary>The neural circuit brain require layer insulation order transmit signal rapid efficient fashion . This insulation call White Matter comprise specific type brain cell call oligodendrocyte . Damage brain white matter occur follow injury disorder like Multiple Sclerosis result sensory , motor , cognitive problem . Currently effective medical therapy promote brain repair reduce disability follow damage white matter . In project , hope change situation encourage brain generate new oligodendrocyte thus new white matter . Our first step find measure sensitive white matter growth .</brief_summary>
