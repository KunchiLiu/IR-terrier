	<brief_title>A Novel Robotic System Single Port Natural Orifice Transluminal Endoscopic Surgery</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Background : Single port surgery natural orifice transluminal endoscopic surgery ( NOTES ) emerge minimally invasive surgery technique reduce patient trauma enhance recovery . However , wide adoption technique hamper limitation instrumentation technical difficulty . Robotic assistance may improve surgical capability single port surgery NOTES provide augmented motion precision manipulation dexterity . Objectives : To evaluate clinical feasibility safety single port surgery NOTES ( mainly transanal transoral surgery ) use novel single port robotic system . Design : Prospective , single center , multispecialty study consistent stage 1 ( Innovation ) study describe Innovation , Development , Exploration , Assessment , Long-term Study ( IDEAL ) framework . Subjects : Sixty consecutive patient various benign/malignant pathology indicate single port colorectal/urologic surgery transanal/transoral surgery fulfil inclusion exclusion criterion recruit . Intervention : Single port surgery transanal/transoral surgery perform use novel single port robotic system . Study Endpoints : Primary : conversion rate perioperative complication . Secondary : operative time , blood loss , pain score , analgesic requirement , length stay . Hypothesis : The prospective study provide important information feasibility , safety , effectiveness novel single port robotic system perform single port surgery NOTES various surgical specialty . A positive study provide support evidence continue development new technology .</detailed_description>
