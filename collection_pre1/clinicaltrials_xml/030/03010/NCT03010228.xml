	<detailed_description>This observer-blind , partially randomize , multi-center dose escalation Phase I study aim assess safety , immunogenicity dose response VLA15 healthy adult age 40 year . Overall 180 subject enrol 6 treatment group : VLA15 12µg w/o ( without ) Alum , VLA15 48µg w/o Alum , VLA15 90µg w/o Alum . For first 24 subject , study open-label subject randomize include stagger dose escalation scheme safety precaution . Thereafter , study conduct observer-blind respect investigator site staff involve clinical evaluation subject , subject blind well . Remaining 156 subject randomize 6 treatment group . I.M . vaccination administer Days 0 , 28 56 deltoid region non-dominant arm . The study investigate safety tolerability well immunogenicity VLA15 . The primary objective address safety tolerability vaccine three month enrollment , i.e . 84 day first vaccination . The study include 1 screen visit 8 outpatient visit day 0 day 365 . In addition , safety phone call perform .</detailed_description>
