	<brief_summary>The investigator propose develop pilot HIV prevention intervention base rectal STI testing , counseling , treatment MSM Peru . The investigator use nucleic acid test screen 750 behaviorally high-risk MSM rectal gonorrheal and/or chlamydial ( GC/CT ) infection . GC/CT-positive subject receive single-dose antibiotic treatment single-session Personal Cognitive Counseling ( PCC ) ( n=50 ) standard post-test counseling ( n=50 ) . A GC/CT-negative control group ( n=50 ) also enrol compare biological outcome include change level inflammatory cytokine follow rectal STI . The intervention base three interrelated objective : 1 ) To use periodic rectal STI nucleic acid test identify member MSM population great short-term risk HIV infection ; 2 ) To provide single-dose antibiotic treatment control immune activation mucosal inflammation cause rectal GC/CT infection increase cellular risk HIV transmission ; 3 ) To use Personal Cognitive Counseling ( PCC ) understand modify recent high-risk sexual practice lead rectal STI acquisition increase future HIV risk . The investigator propose screen 750 behaviorally high-risk MSM rectal GC/CT infection enroll 100 GC/CT-positive individual ( use conservative 15 % prevalence estimate ) 50 GC/CT-negative control ( match age baseline frequency URAI ) . GC/CT-infected participant give single-dose antibiotic therapy randomize receive single-session PCC ( n=50 ) standard post-test counseling ( n=50 ) . The primary outcome impact PCC self-reported sexual risk behavior ( URAI ) . Secondary outcome ass : 1 ) Feasibility/Acceptability STI screen program ; 2 ) Impact GC/CT infection treatment level inflammatory cytokine ( IL-6 , IL-8 , TNF-αand IL-1β ) rectal mucosa ; 3 ) Prevalence persistent/recurrent rectal GC/CT ; 4 ) HIV incidence GC/CT-infected -uninfected MSM .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Overview . The investigator plan screen 750 behaviorally high-risk , HIV-uninfected MSM order enroll 100 subject rectal GC/CT infection 50 uninfected control . GC/CT-infected participant receive single-dose antibiotic therapy randomize receive either PCC standard-of-care post-test counseling . GC/CT-negative participant receive standard post-test counseling . Behavioral biological assessment conduct Baseline , 3-month 6-month Follow-up visit . The primary outcome effect PCC prevalence URAI HIV-infected unknown status partner precede 3-months . Secondary outcome include feasibility/acceptability intervention , prevalence persistent recurrent GC/CT infection , change rectal cytokine level , incidence HIV infection . Recruitment . Participants recruit local HIV test site use method describe . Screening Visit . The investigator screen 750 MSM report least one recent episode unprotected receptive anal intercourse ( URAI ) rectal GC/CT infection goal identify 100 GC/CT-positive participant ( use conservative 15 % prevalence estimate assume 10 % loss follow-up 6 month ) . ) Rapid HIV Testing : After provide informed consent , potential participant undergo rapid HIV testing . Study staff provide pre- post-test risk reduction counsel base CDC 's RESPECT-2 model ( 24 ) screen HIV point care use 4th Generation Rapid HIV-1/2 assay ( Alere Determine , Alere ) . ii ) Physical Examination : Potential participant undergo routine physical examination ass sign STI . Participants evidence proctitis ( rectal discharge inflammation ) treat Ceftriaxone 250 mg injection Azithromycin 1 g oral invite enroll study base symptomatic criterion . iii ) Syphilis Testing : Potential participant undergo syphilis test RPR ( RPRnosticon , Biomerieux ) , positive result confirm TPPA ( Serodia TPPA , Fujirebio ) . Results provide within 14 day individual latent syphilis infection treat three weekly dos Penicillin G 2.4 Million IU . iv ) Rectal NAT Screening : All potential participant , regardless symptom , test rectal GC/CT infection screen visit . A rectal swab obtain clinical staff test GC/CT use transcription mediate assay ( TMA ) ( GenProbe Aptima , Hologic ) . Results provide within 14 day . v ) Antibiotic Therapy : Participants symptomatic proctitis screen visit provide appropriate antibiotic treatment ( Ceftriaxone 250 mg IM Azithromycin 1g PO ) , advise importance partner notification , offer antibiotic therapy packet deliver recent sexual partner ( maximum 5 packet per participant ) . Each packet include single dose Cefixime 400 mg Azithromycin 1g PO well print information GC/CT infection local test treatment resource HIV STIs ( include free partner test treatment Via Libre site ) . Enrollment Visit . Based result nucleic acid test and/or symptomatic criterion , enroll 100 HIV-uninfected MSM rectal GC/CT infection randomize receive either PCC ( n=50 ) standard post-test counseling ( n=50 ) . An additional 50 GC/CT-uninfected control subject also enrol . ) Antibiotic Therapy : Participants diagnose rectal GC/CT nucleic acid test receive antibiotic therapy 5 partner treatment packet describe . ii ) Randomization : Participants diagnose rectal GC/CT infection and/or symptomatic proctitis randomize receive either PCC standard care post-test counseling . Randomization assignment construct random permute block allocation ( block size = 7 , alternate 4/3 ratio ) . Computer-generated assignment store opaque , seal envelope open sequentially time allocation . iii ) Behavioral Survey : GC/CT-infected participant arm ask complete CASI-administered behavioral survey . The survey instrument self-administered use iPad device ask participant sexual practice previous 3 month , include number type sexual partner ( primary/stable partner , casual/recurrent contact , casual/single contact , anonymous contact , commercial sex client worker ) , frequency sexual intercourse ( oral , anal , vaginal ) , frequency unprotected intercourse , frequency unprotected intercourse HIV-infected unknown serostatus partner . To collect additional detail partner-level risk factor , participant ask provide information recent sexual contact ( maximum three contact within 6 month ) . For contact , participant ask describe partner 's age , gender , sexual orientation , sexual role , partnership type , length partnership , partner HIV serostatus , sexual practice , include act-specific condom use . Additional question address demographic , STI symptom ( e.g. , dysuria , urethral rectal discharge , etc . ) , drug alcohol use , depression , anxiety , self-efficacy negotiating condom use . iv ) Personal Cognitive Counseling ( PCC ) : After complete survey , participant diagnose GC/CT-infection receive either PCC standard care post-test counseling , accord randomization arm . PCC Procedures : ) SJEI Completion : Participants first ask complete SJEI instrument independently . ii ) SJEI Review : A study counselor meet participant review response SJEI ask recount recent sexual encounter involve URAI . Participants ask tell story context , pay attention environmental cue , interpersonal interaction , individual emotion cognitive process occur step encounter . After narrate story , participant review together counselor self-justification employ interaction , use objective , `` offline '' analysis explore `` online '' cognitive process use justify sexual risk behavior episode . iii ) Risk Counseling : The counselor work participant highlight moment critical behavioral decision point occur , identify self-justification use engage risk behavior moment , develop strategy control risk behavior future interaction . A key component counsel involve link prior episode URAI current diagnosis rectal GC/CT , strategy highlight flaw previously use self-justification . iv ) Role-Play : The counselor participant rehearse risk reduction strategy role-playing typical interaction high-risk sexual behavior may occur . After complete session , participant ask discuss satisfaction PCC model , include comfort discuss cognitive process occur sexual encounter , perceive usefulness counseling , important issue address . v ) Standard Care Post-Test Counseling . GC/CT-infected participant standard care arm ( GC/CT-negative participant screen infection ) receive standard post-test counseling accordance Peruvian Ministry Health guideline . Counseling include discussion recent sexual risk behavior , condom use reduce risk future HIV/STI acquisition , partner notification , follow-up testing . vi ) Rectal Cytokine Measurements . GC/CT-infected participant randomize standard post-test counseling arm match 1-to-1 GC/CT-negative control . Matching base age number episodes URAI report previous 30 day ( categorized 1 , 2-3 , &gt; 3 episode ) . GC/CT-infected participant match GC/CT-negative control ask provide swab sample rectal mucosa monitor change level inflammatory cytokine time diagnosis antibiotic treatment . To collect sample , physician insert sponge swab 4 cm participant 's rectum leave place 30 second prior removal . Samples store liquid transport medium -4°C completion study , time sample send UCLA Mucosal Immunology Core ( MIC ) Laboratory . Levels IL-1β , IL-6 , IL-8 , TNF-α rectal mucosa measure . Repeat measurement collect 3- 6-month Follow-up visit ass change initial diagnosis post-treatment . Results use establish baseline value change level key cytokine follow STI treatment define parameter intermediate biological outcome project RCT . Follow-up Visits . All participant ask return 3-month 6-month Follow-up assessment . ) Behavioral Survey . All participant diagnose rectal GC/CT infection Enrollment ask complete CASI-administered Follow-up survey visit . Similar Baseline survey , Follow-up instrument ass sexual risk behavior , substance use , mediate factor ( depression , anxiety , condom self-efficacy ) previous 3-month period well partner notification treatment outcome . ii ) Repeat HIV Testing . Rapid HIV test provide follow-up visit use procedure . iii ) Repeat GC/CT Testing . All participant receive repeat nucleic acid test rectal GC/CT follow-up visit . Results repeat test provide telephone person within two week . Participants new , recurrent , persistent infection treat Ceftriaxone 250 mg IM Azithromycin 1g PO . Post-test counsel new , persistent , recurrent infection provide accord participant 's original randomization assignment ( PCC standard care counsel ) . iv ) Repeat Cytokine Testing . Rectal swab measurement obtain GC/CT-positive participant randomize standard care arm match GC/CT-negative control follow-up monitor change inflammatory cytokine level rectal mucosa antibiotic treatment GC/CT-negative control time period . Samples store test UCLA MIC laboratory .</detailed_description>
