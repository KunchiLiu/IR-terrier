	<brief_summary>Achieving adequate range motion post Total Knee Arthroplasty ( TKA ) important goal return optimum function . Traditionally , adequate range motion achieve combination in-home outpatient physical therapy . While physical therapy successful , limitation cost availability . As copayments rise , patient may decide afford physical therapy , potentially compromise outcome surgery successful return function . It assume easy fun use , patient administer , incentive device provide accurate , quantitative flexion extension measurement may accelerate patient mobility return function TKA . The Measuring Every Day ( MED ) portable goniometer commercially available provide objective , consistent range motion measurement record send electronically clinician 's office potentially enable earlier clinical therapy adjustment modification prescribed therapy . Goniometry commonly use tool measure document range motion ( ROM ) clinical evaluation physical therapy examination . The technique use assess limitation patient 's joint provide information clinician may help determine treatment . The study design compare range motion measurement data 6 week patient randomize receive either traditional physical therapy MED device . The hypothesis patient use MED device achieve equivalent range motion six week compare patient participate traditional standard care physical therapy .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Measuring Every Day ( MED ) Study</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The MED commercially available , digital range motion monitoring device patient recover knee surgery . It display flexion extension measurement option connect Apple Android device send data clinician 's office review . Patients capability log Measuring Every Day website assign username password create . This allow view progress send message study team . Study team member also access website review ability send receive message . All share file reside Amazon HIPAA compliant platform . This prospective , randomize , unblinded , single-center study compare MED device traditional physical therapy . The study include 46 patient undergone successful , unilateral total knee arthroplasty . All patient receive minimum 2 physical therapy session prior hospital discharge also instruct flex extend operative knee 10 time every 15 minute awake per standard care discharge . Patients randomize 1:1 ratio prior discharge hospital either : 1 ) total knee arthroplasty standard care rehab consist 2 week in-home physical therapy consist 3 session per week start within 48 hour hospital discharge , follow 4 week out-patient therapy three time weekly , 2 ) ten repetition MED device three time daily 8:00am , 2:00pm 8:00pm . Patients transmit 10th measurement time point clinician 's office . Patients randomize MED device train use device prior hospital discharge . All enrolled subject return surgeon 's office Week 2 index knee range motion measure PI study coordinator MED device . If subject enrol MED device arm minimum flexion 90 degree extension -25 degree , consider screen failure return traditional physical therapy . All enrolled subject return surgeon 's office Week 6 index knee range motion measure PI study coordinator use MED device goal achieve minimum flexion 120 degree extension 0 degree .</detailed_description>
