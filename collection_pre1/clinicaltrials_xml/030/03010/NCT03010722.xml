	<brief_summary>This single centre prospective biological translational research study involve collection tumour tissue , blood sample clinical data patient treat regorafenib metastatic Colorectal Cancer ( mCRC ) Royal Marsden Hospital . Patients eligible study histological diagnosis CRC , refractory standard available therapy palliative intent mCRC , receive prior treatment least one anti-VEGF antibody chemotherapy drug include fluorouracil ( 5FU ) capecitabine , oxaliplatin irinotecan , patient RAS mutant tumour .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Prospective Translational Study Investigating Molecular Predictors Resistance Response Regorafenib Monotherapy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This exploratory translational research study obtain research biopsy RAS mutant metastatic colorectal cancer ( mCRC ) tumour tissue prior commencement regorafenib multi-tyrosine kinase inhibitor ( MKI ) treatment target vascular endothelial growth factor receptor ( VEGFR ) , tumour microenvironment oncogenic driver alteration , development resistance . Candidate marker resistance identify tissue biopsy genetic molecular analysis parallel collection serial blood specimen facilitate identification resistance marker track resistance evolution circulate nucleic acid . Early dynamic contrast enhance MRI ( DCE-MRI ) along diffusion weight ( DW ) -MRI image beginning , day 15+/-7 post treatment perform . Additionally , dual contrast enhance CT ( DECT ) perform accord routine clinical evaluation time point drug administration 8 week drug administration . Disease monitor serial CT scan chest abdomen pelvis ( CT-CAP ) every eight week , progression . The aim study identify novel predictive biomarkers resistance response target therapy mCRC previously treat oxaliplatin , fluoropyrimidines irinotecan , use genetic , epigenetic , transcriptomics , proteomic live tissue culture method . These molecular analysis perform metastatic tumour tissue sample take firstly commencement regorafenib , secondly progression disease , thirdly archival primary metastatic tumour tissue . There additional biopsy 8 week patient response stable disease , determine Response Evaluation Criteria Solid Tumours ( RECIST ) 1.1 criterion .</detailed_description>
