	<brief_title>Studying Airway Microenvironment Patients Undergoing Surgical Bronchoscopic Interventions COPD</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease ( COPD ) umbrella term encompass two entity cause progressive ultimately disable breathlessness . Emphysema process destructive airspace distal terminal bronchiole , loss gas exchange tissue , elastic recoil circumferential tether small airway lead collapse forced expiration . Chronic bronchitis disorder bronchus cause excess production impair mobilisation mucus . Increased parasympathetic tone progressive remodelling airway impair response bronchodilator . Static dynamic hyperinflation ensue - persistently expand chest flatten diaphragm despite increase use accessory respiratory muscle - result disadvantaged respiratory pump . Patients severe emphysema hyperinflation benefit lung volume reduction technique design reduce gas trap improve airflow , chest wall lung mechanic . The best evidence exist lung volume reduction surgery ( LVRS ) , however without risk increase interest development bronchoscopic lung volume reduction ( BLVR ) techniques include emplacement endobronchial valve coil target lung denervation ( TLD ) , show improve lung function , exercise capacity , quality life . Endobronchial cryotherapy novel investigational treatment patient chronic bronchitis . Porcine model show ablation abnormal metaplastic goblet cell regeneration healthy ciliated epithelium submucosa within 48 hour complete heal 60 day follow treatment . A pilot study evaluate 11 patient undergoing lobectomy pneumonectomy presume lung cancer . Metered spray , one two separate location , administer 2 week prior surgery , least 2cm distal propose resection margin ( first segmental lobular bronchus ) . No adverse event report . Histology 8 submit specimen demonstrate localised cryothermic effect extend beyond submucosa , minimal inflammation . Chronic airway infiltration neutrophil , macrophage , Th-1 predominant lymphocytes driven increased expression inflammatory protein , cytokine chemokines , intensified exacerbation . It generally accept acute exacerbation accelerate decline lung function COPD . Recent study suggest role microvesicles ( MVs ) pathogenesis COPD , drive exacerbation . MVs fragment cell membrane range 0.1 1Âµm diameter shed almost eukaryotic cell . They recognise key mediator intercellular communication , transport variety molecular cargo include protein nucleic acid distant cell , implicate various inflammatory disease include COPD . The majority study look circulate endothelial-derived MVs , elevate patient COPD , significantly high exacerbation , predictive rapid force expiratory volume 1 second ( FEV1 ) decline . However , paucity data epithelial-derived MVs within lung . We know acute lung injury model alveolar macrophage-derived microvesicles , carry biologically active tumour necrosis factor , rapidly release early phase may play role initiate disease process . Bronchoalveolar lavage brushing establish technique obtain material respectively , measurement inflammatory protein microvesicles , cytology messenger ribonucleic acid ( mRNA ) analysis . A novel technique sample mucosal line fluid use synthetic absorptive matrix ( 'bronchosorption ' ) show great sensitivity standard bronchoalveolar lavage ( BAL ) , eliminate disadvantage dilution . A combination three technique directly harvest low airway sample multiple site pulmonary inflammation would allow comparison proteomic , transcriptomic , histology data endobronchial environment intervention . This would first study evaluate lung microenvironment context , may identify predictive biomarkers response intervention future exacerbation risk .</detailed_description>
