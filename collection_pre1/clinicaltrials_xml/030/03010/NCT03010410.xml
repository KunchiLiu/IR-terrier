	<brief_summary>Aging associate immunosenescence impair host defense mechanism , contribute influenza-related morbidity mortality . Preliminary data demonstrate platelet transcriptome markedly different healthy subject influenza patient . Interferon-induced transmembrane protein ( IFITM ) family member among transcript significantly increase platelet influenza expression IFITM-3 impair elderly subject , pattern associate increased mortality . This study build data investigate age influence expression platelet IFITM family member patient influenza sepsis . This study prospectively determine age alters induction ( IFITMs ) platelets hospitalized influenza sepsis patient . The study also determine diminished expression IFITM family member correlate increase risk adverse outcome older influenza sepsis patient .</brief_summary>

	<criteria>≥18 year old time enrollment Meet one follow three main criterion : A . INFLUENZA ( AND OTHER RESPIRATORY VIRUS ) PATIENTS : Patients admit intensive care unit ( ICU ) primary microbiologic diagnosis influenza ( strain ) routinely clinically identify respiratory virus within 1 week symptom onset . Influenza respiratory virus diagnose use RTPCR viral panel respiratory tract specimen , currently standard care patient admit ICUs IMC respiratory symptom . OR B. SEPSIS PATIENTS : Sepsis patient must 1 . Suspected confirmed infection AND 2 . Organ dysfunction define SOFA &gt; = 2 baseline ( baseline data available , SOFA assume 0 ) OR C. SEPTIC SHOCK PATIENTS : AFTER INFUSION OF 20ML/KG CRYSTALLOID OR EQUIVALENT , Septic shock patient must 1 . Suspected confirmed infection AND 2 . Lactate &gt; 2 mmol/L AND 3 . Receiving vasopressor All patient must enrol study within 72 hour ICU admission Exclusion criterion Have congenital acquire immunodeficiency disorder ( e.g. , chronic variable immune deficiency , agammaglobulinemia , hypogammaglobulinemia , leukocyte adhesion defect , IgA deficiency , etc . ) Have neutropenia ( &lt; 1,000/mm3 ) Have receive immunosuppressant medication within previous 30 day ( e.g. , prednisone prednisone equivalent dose≥10mg daily ≥14 day cyclosporine , TNFalpha antagonists , tacrolimus , sirolimus , interferon , mycophenolate , biological agent , methotrexate , azathioprine , polyclonal/monoclonal antibody , etc . ) Have history bone marrow organ transplantation Have active malignancy ( include nonmelanoma skin cancer localize prostate cancer ) , receive chemotherapy drug within last 6 month .
