	<brief_summary>Incisional negative pressure therapy ( INPWT ) previously show certain patient population decrease wound heal complication , decrease rate hematoma seromas , well well scar quality . We find group patient , panniculectomies preparation renal transplant , significantly high rate wound heal complication . We believe best way demonstrate benefit incisional negative pressure wound therapy group patient know significantly high rate wind complication .</brief_summary>
