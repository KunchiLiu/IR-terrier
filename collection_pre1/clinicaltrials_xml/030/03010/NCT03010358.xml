	<brief_title>Entospletinib Obinutuzumab Treating Patients With Relapsed Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia , Small Lymphocytic Lymphoma , Non-Hodgkin Lymphoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To evaluate safety tolerability entospletinib administer combination obinutuzumab patient relapsed/refractory chronic lymphocytic leukemia/small lymphocytic lymphoma ( CLL/SLL ) non-Hodgkin lymphoma ( NHL ) , identify dose phase 2 expansion . ( Phase I ) II . To evaluate efficacy entospletinib combination obinutuzumab patient relapsed refractory CLL/SLL , measure complete response ( CR ) rate . ( Phase II ) SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . Objective response rate ( ORR , define complete remission , complete response incomplete marrow recovery , partial remission nodular partial response ) . ( Phase II ) II . Event free survival define interval date first study treatment date objective sign disease recurrence , subsequent anti-leukemic therapy , death , whichever first report . ( Phase II ) III . Safety tolerability entospletinib combination obinutuzumab adverse event ( AEs ) . ( Phase II ) TERTIARY OBJECTIVES : I . Peripheral blood B-cell depletion recovery . II . Preliminary assessment predictive value minimal residual disease ( MRD ) . III . Pharmacodynamics effect vivo administration entospletinib NFkappaB activation expression anti-apoptotic protein CLL cell . IV . Association establish biomarkers ( chromosomal abnormality , immunoglobulin heavy chain [ IGHV ] mutational status , p53 mutational status ) response ( ORR event-free survival [ EFS ] ) entospletinib ( ENTO ) combination obinutuzumab patient relapsed/refractory CLL . OUTLINE : This phase I , dose-escalation study entospletinib follow phase II study . Patients receive entospletinib orally ( PO ) either day ( QD ) twice day ( BID ) day -7 -1 ( run-in phase ) depend assign dose level . Patients also receive obinutuzumab intravenously ( IV ) day 1 , 2 , 8 , 15 day 1 subsequent course . Treatment obinutuzumab repeat every 28 day 6 course daily treatment entospletinib continue every 28 day 12 course absence disease progression unexpected toxicity . After completion study treatment , patient follow 3 , 6 , 9 , 12 month every 4-6 month thereafter .</detailed_description>
