	<brief_summary>Aneurysmal subarachnoid haemorrhage ( aSAH ) affect 10,000 individual per year UK . It account ~5 % stroke , responsible 25 % quality-adjusted life year ( QALYs ) lose due stroke . Although early repair rupture aneurysms aggressive postoperative management improve overall outcome , remain devastate disease mortality approach 50 % . Survivors leave neurological injury range subtle cognitive deficit disable cerebral infarction , le 60 % return functional independence . SAH trigger series pathological process result neuronal damage consequent neurological deficit term early brain injury ( EBI ) . Many patient survive initial bleed , deteriorate day later delay ischaemic neurological deficit ( DIND ) , cause poor outcome death 30 % patient SAH . Both pathological process still poorly understood limit number treatment option . DIND treat blood pressure augmentation ensure adequate blood flow brain . In awake patient , response easily accurately assessed perform thorough neurological examination . In patient whose clinical condition demand sedation , intubation ventilation , assess response treatment use neurological examination virtually impossible . Multimodality monitoring ( MM ) , primarily microdialysis brain tissue oxygen tension catheter insert relevant part brain offer direct assessment delivery utilisation metabolic substrates cellular level . These use early detection DIND well monitor blood pressure augmentation . The aim study establish validate clinical protocol MM derive management SAH patient , determine optimal therapy correct abnormality brain metabolism explore relationship MD monitoring modality .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>This prospective observational study patient poor grade subarachnoid haemorrhage ( SAH ) cause ruptured brain artery aneurysm . The investigator aim include 100 patient 5-year period . SAH diagnose use computer tomography image brain presence rupture aneurysm mean computer tomography angiogram vessel head . These two investigation part standard clinical practice every patient suspect SAH . Term `` poor grade '' use case SAH patient unconscious i.e . coma consequence disease whose clinical condition require intubation ventilation ( without sedation ) thus admission intensive care unit . All patient poor grade SAH admit neuroscience critical care unit screen participation study . All poor grade SAH patient unconscious thus unable give inform consent . Therefore , next-of-kin eligible patient approach discuss consider patient 's involvement study . If next-of-kin , treat clinician approach professional consultee . Once consent obtain next-of-kin , participant follow monitoring institute : 1 . An intracranial access device insert general anaesthesia intracranial pressure ( ICP ) , Licox partial tension tissue oxygen ( PbtO2 ) probe microdialysis ( MD ) catheter . Neuromonitors insert part brain supply affected artery . This procedure perform neurocritical care unit theatre patient undergo operative procedure time . Continuous neuromonitoring commence . Hourly MD sample process leftover sample store -80oC cytokine analysis later date . Neuromonitoring continue long clinically need 21 day ictus . 2 . All participant fit near-infrared spectroscopy monitor ( NIRS ) . This non-invasive monitor use measure tissue haemoglobin concentration oxygen content continuously bedside . 3 . Daily transcranial Doppler ( TCD ) examination perform bedside ass caliber large cerebral artery . This procedure use regular clinical practice diagnose large vessel spasm one pathological substrate delay cerebral ischaemia ( DCI ) All participant CT brain perfusion scan day 3 day 5 initial haemorrhage ( ictus ) clinically need ass brain perfusion possibility DCI part standard clinical practice . These scan review report consultant neuroradiologists . If identify area ( area ) reversible ischaemia , researcher review position invasive brain monitor - outside area DCI , additional monitor insert identified area reversible ishaemia . Researchers use invasive brain monitor ( MD LiCox ) non-invasive monitoring ( NIRS TCD ) ass response standard treatment cerebral reversible ischaemia hypertensive therapy i.e . mean arterial pressure ( MAP ) augmentation vasoactive medication . Repeat CT brain perfusion scan perform day 7 10 initial haemorrhage earlier clinically indicated assess response treatment . Following 6 month period , researcher see patient outpatient clinic ass functional outcome . This part patient 's standard clinical care patient offer clinical follow way . Researchers collect biological sample available part standard clinical care participant subject participant additional procedure . This would consist : - left microdialysate sample use standard clinical care participant - daily blood sample participant arterial line central venous catheter - sample cerebrospinal fluid ( CSF ) participant external ventricular drain</detailed_description>
