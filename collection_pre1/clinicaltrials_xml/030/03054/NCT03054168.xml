	<detailed_description>Skeletal muscle represent large organ body , comprise &gt; 50 % total body mass . The function skeletal muscle best understood role locomotion provide mechanical support skeleton facilitate movement . However , skeletal muscle also important maintain whole-body metabolic health . For example , muscle also act site glucose disposal thereby act maintain whole-body glycaemic control . In addition , skeletal muscle represent vast protein store , amino acid use time fast , infection disease provide energy maintain critical organ . Exercise ( resistance type exercise ( RE-T ) particular ) still remain effective mean maintain increase muscle mass stimulation muscle protein synthesis ( MPS ) , despite , exercise regulates change muscle mass still unknown . A number pathway infer key , however clear number study systemic hormone level , testosterone particular , may provide significant contribution . It well know chronic androgenic hormone deficiency lead loss lean body mass strength , turn contribute impaired physical function . Furthermore , testosterone level pharmacologically reduce ( use gonadotropin release hormone analogue ) healthy young male , resistance exercise training induce increase muscle mass strength absent . Whilst systemic hormone level carefully maintain youth ( unless illness deficiency present ) , level hormone decrease age , particularly regularly physically active , indeed approximately 25-30 % old men level testosterone threshold use define hypogonadism . Therefore , significant need understand underlie mechanism behind hormonally induced muscle mass regulation . Furthermore , old age resistance traditional anabolic stimulus nutrition resistance exercise , old adult show blunted-anabolic hormonal profile response resistance training compare young . These impairment hormonal regulation ageing may part responsible slow decline muscle mass age know sarcopenia . Whilst muscle-wasting condition considerable concern , loss muscle old age pose great socio-economic burden . Therefore significant clinical need identify contribute factor muscle loss specifically target intervention ( i.e. , pharmacological hormonal therapy ) . The aim project two fold : 1 ) Firstly aim investigate impact systemic hormone level control muscle mass healthy young adult undertake resistance exercise training program , hypothesize reduction hormone level systemically normal young adult impair MPS muscle mass gain response resistance exercise training . 2 ) Secondly aim investigate impact enhance testosterone level older adult responsiveness resistance exercise training contribution systemic testosterone level muscle mass regulation ageing , hypothesize increase testosterone level older male improve responsiveness anabolic stimulus ( RE-T ) .</detailed_description>
