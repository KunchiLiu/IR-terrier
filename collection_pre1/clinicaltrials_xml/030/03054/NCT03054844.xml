	<brief_summary>Intranasal ( IN ) midazolam anxiolytic commonly use pediatric population procedural anxiolysis emergency department ( ED ) set facilitate painful distressing procedure , laceration repair . Intranasal midazolam effective safe child . However , due acidic nature midazolam , burn sensation associate intranasal administration midazolam . The use IN lidocaine show decrease pain associate administration IN midazolam acidic solution . The IN lidocaine give premedication ( PREMED ) , spray naris first provide topical anesthesia , follow administration IN midazolam . Lidocaine also give concurrently IN midazolam ( PREMIX ) , mixed midazolam combine mixture administer . Both method show effective decreasing pain associate intranasal administration acidic solution , midazolam , although PREMIX method could advantage require less number spray , tolerate good child . Although method show work , know PREMIX method non-inferior PREMED method decrease pain distress associate administer IN midazolam . Therefore , investigator aim determine PREMIX method non-inferior PREMED method use lidocaine decrease pain distress associate administration IN midazolam child .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>We enroll 50 child determine whether PREMED method non-inferior PREMIX method . We base sample size outcome pain distress associate administration IN midazolam , measure use primary outcome measure Observational Scale Behavioral Distress-Revised ( OSBD-R ) . The OSBD-R observational measure distress well validate pediatric population evaluate painful distressing procedure , use child young 1 year age [ 1,2 ] . The sample size 50 patient determine base prestated margin non-inferiority ( delta ) 1.8 ( SD 2.25 ) . This value base minimum clinically significant difference use prior study painful procedure child emergency department [ 3,4,5 ] . To determine noninferiority use delta 1.80 ( SD 2.25 ) , 1-tailed alpha 0.025 power 80 % , would require 25 patient arm , total 50 patient . OSBD-R score determine independently two blind trained assessor review videotape study procedure . Interrater reliability OSBD-R two assessor evaluate determine intraclass correlation coefficient . The period administration midazolam alone PREMED group period administration midazolam/lidocaine mixture PREMIX group two phase compare determine primary outcome . Secondary outcome measure pain distress associate IN midazolam administration include Children 's Hospital Eastern Ontario Pain Scale ( CHEOPS ) ; Faces-LegsActivity-Crying-Consolability ( FLACC ) scale ; cry duration . These continuous measure analyze use independent sample t-test.We also evaluate parental provider satisfaction across various domain use 5-point Likert scale ( see attach document question ask ) . Responses dichotomize `` agree '' ( i.e . respondent answer `` agree '' `` strongly agree '' ) `` disagree '' ( i.e . respondent respond `` undecided '' , `` disagree '' , `` strongly disagree '' ) analyze use chi square test .</detailed_description>
