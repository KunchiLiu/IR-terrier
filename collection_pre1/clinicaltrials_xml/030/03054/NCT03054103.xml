	<brief_summary>Background : Phacoemulsification common surgical procedure perform United States European Union sedation commonly use phacoemulsification help alleviate patient anxiety prevent patient interfere procedure . The investigator administer ketamine addition midazolam regard . To study effectiveness technique , The investigator propose study determine add low-dose ketamine midazolam beneficial ( negative ) effect operate condition , patient satisfaction , recovery unilateral phacoemulsification procedure perform use topical anesthesia intravenous ( IV ) conscious sedation . Methods : In free-standing Outpatient Surgery Center , investigator conduct randomized , double-masked , 3-arm , prospective comparison IV midazolam vs. midazolam ketamine 5 mg IV vs. midazolam ketamine 10 mg IV . The investigator measure single surgeon 's assessment surgical condition , self-reported patient satisfaction , postoperative pain score , duration postoperative stay . The investigator also analyze dose midazolam require meet subjective anxiolysis group .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Phacoemulsification common surgical procedure perform United States European Union . In addition , number diagnosis cataract expect double 25,000,000 2010 50,000,000 2050 incidence phacoemulsification also increase . Therefore , attempt optimize outcome efficiency significant . Sedation commonly use phacoemulsification help alleviate patient anxiety prevent patient interfere procedure . However , great deal variation exist anesthetic management case . Investigators publish use number agent sedation literature . These include midazolam , clonidine , propofol , fentanyl , dexmedetomidine , remifentanil , oral diazepam . Intravenous ( IV ) clonidine half-life 9-13 h increase risk postoperative hypotension . Propofol cause disinhibition titrate surgery prevent oversedation . Opioids carry increase risk respiratory depression , prolonged sedation , well delirium elderly . Finally , oral medication allow quick dose adjustment surgery . Intravenous midazolam commonly use sedation phacoemulsification minor procedure . It property anxiolytic , muscle relaxant , effective reduce intraocular pressure . However , anxious patient administer benzodiazepine may require high dos cataract surgery lead oversedation disinhibition subsequent patient movement . These response reduce patient 's ability follow simple command affect surgical outcome . Additionally , patient receive much sedation may fall asleep wake startle , similarly compromise outcome surgery . In search additional medication improve surgical condition patient comfort phacoemulsification , investigator explore use medication improve analgesia reduce patient movement procedure , namely ketamine . Ketamine NMDA antagonist sedative analgesic property minimal effect respiration . Ketamine use premedicate sedate patient undergoing day care procedure without adverse effect , patient , typically , remain cooperative albeit sedate . These property along relatively short elimination half-life 2 h ( compare 3-4 h midazolam ) make ketamine attractive agent sedation monitor anesthesia care ( MAC ) cataract surgery . The purpose study determine add low-dose ketamine midazolam beneficial ( negative ) effect operate condition , patient satisfaction , recovery unilateral phacoemulsification procedure perform use topical anesthesia IV conscious sedation . The investigator measure surgeon 's assessment participant 's cooperation surgery accord predetermine Likert scale . The investigator also record follow outcome measure regard participant 's surgery : 1 ) total dose midazolam , 2 ) average time spent procedural room , 3 ) postoperative length stay ( LOS ) , 4 ) average postoperative pain score . The subject receive survey inquire subject ' comfort sedation level surgery . Finally , investigator record follow demographic data participant : gender , age , psychiatric diagnosis , use CNS , psychiatric , opioid medication . Statistical Analysis The investigator use Fisher 's exact test examine data express percentage , Students t-test yes/no data , repeat measure ANOVA 3 group analysis ( LOS , surgical duration ) . The investigator judge significance P-value 0.05 . The investigator utilize generalize estimate equation ( GEE ) fit logistic model ass difference responses patient base amount ketamine receive . The GEE approach fit model correlate outcomes , case subject one procedure perform .</detailed_description>
