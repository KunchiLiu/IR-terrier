	<detailed_description>Gallstones cause pain , jaundice pancreatitis block bile duct . Bile duct stone remove endoscopic procedure call endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography ( ERCP ) use basket balloon . However , large stone ( 15mm size ) multiple stone difficult remove ERCP routine technique . In case , break stone small piece remove safely . We call mechanical lithotripsy . Mechanical lithotripsy do use basket sheath wrap around stone , turn attach handle turn result stone breakage . But , technique difficult perform . Other easy standard-of-care technique use remove difficult bile duct stone ERCP peroral cholangioscopy-directed laser lithotripsy ( POC-LL ) endoscopic balloon sphincterotomy ( EBS ) . The POC-LL technique help u directly see bile duct stone . Using technique catheter insert endoscope bile duct reach stone . Using catheter , energy laser ( laser lithotripsy ) accurately focus onto stone cause stone break-up . After stone broken small piece remove usual method use balloon basket . EBS technique 8 20mm balloon use enlarge ( dilation ) open bile duct . Following dilation , stone remove use routine method . It discretion treat physician technique use remove bile duct stone . The purpose study compare need use mechanical lithotripsy patient undergo POC-LL EBS removal difficult bile duct stone</detailed_description>
