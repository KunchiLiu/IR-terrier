	<brief_summary>Oxycodone oral opioid analgesic commonly prescribed management pain post-operative patient Boston Children 's Hospital . Oxycodone widely use adult child relieve post-operative pain . However , pharmacokinetics ( body ) pharmacodynamics ( work ) well establish child . Some child , specific genetic make-up , may metabolize drug quickly therefore may risk side effect commonly prescribe dose . The investigator would like find general anesthesia ( GA ) effect drug absorb , metabolize excreted child . In order study aspect , investigator would like give oxycodone surgical patient ( group one receive oxycodone begin GA group two receive oxycodone end GA ) Boston Children 's Hospital measure metabolic activity also perform specific genetic analysis .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>This research involve two treatment group : ( child 2-5 year old ) ( child 6-8 year old ) . The first group include 20 child 2-5 year old . In group child randomize either receive 0.1mg/kg liquid oxycodone via orogastric ( OG ) tube induction procedure begin general anesthesia , 0.1mg/kg liquid oxycodone via OG tube procedure end general anesthesia . Every patient receive inhalational intravenous induction anesthesia decide anesthesia team day surgery , routine clinical care . An intravenous cannula ( IV ) insert every patient part routine clinical care . No additional intravenous line require study . An arterial line use indicated surgical procedure . As part study protocol , blood sample ( 5 mL ) take IV send genetic analysis . The genetic testing specifically analyze follow genotype : cytochrome P450 ( CYP ) 2D6 3A4 , represent difference cytochrome P450 metabolism oxycodone . An orogastric tube place stomach ( placement verify routine accept clinical guideline ) anesthesia part standard routine clinical care remove gastric content . The orogastric tube use intragastric liquid oxycodone administration dose 0.1 mg/kg either procedure ( begin general anesthesia ) procedure ( end general anesthesia ) . This weight-adjusted dose 0.1 mg/kg administer per standard clinical dosing guideline Boston Children 's Hospital.. The second group include 20 patient ( child 6-8 year old ) . In group child randomize either receive 0.1 mg/kg liquid oxycodone per oral ( PO ) surgery pre-op holding , 0.1 mg/kg liquid oxycodone PO surgery Post Anesthesia Care Unit ( PACU ) . As part routine clinical care , anesthesiologist may give follow narcotic additional pain management base clinical judgment : Fentanyl , sufentanil , remifentanyl . For purpose study , follow narcotic administer : morphine hydromorphone . Additionally , oxycodone administer initial study dose operating room . These medication produce metabolite would interfere pharmacokinetics study . Furthermore , morphine , hydromorphone oxycodone withhold entire study period ( 24 hour ) . This standard clinical care , withhold morphine/hydromorphone/oxycodone result additional risk patient , since equally effective pain management option available standard care . If clinician deems morphine , hydromorphone , oxycodone necessary clinical care , withheld , patient withdrawn study . A total 11 blood sample draw study . The first sample send genetic testing . The 10 sample draw follow time point : sample 1 : within 2 hour post dose oxycodone , sample 2-7 : within 30 90 min last sample drawn within 12 hour post dose oxycodone , sample 8-10 : anytime 12 24 hour post dose oxycodone ( assign clinically indicate base duration surgery minimize patient disturbance ) . Therefore , blood sample ( 1 mL ) draw 10 different time point patient . Blood study purpose draw exist intravenous line arterial line specific time point indicate child anesthesia . Postoperatively , regard time blood draw , necessary exact rather accurately record time sample take . Thus , coordinate draw routine laboratory test possible , order minimize patient discomfort .</detailed_description>
