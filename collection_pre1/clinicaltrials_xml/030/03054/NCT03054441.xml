	<brief_summary>In hemiplegia quantitatively measurement asymmetry use upper limb could overcome limitation many outcome measure score dependent experience training therapist . The main aim study determine validity Actigraph GXT3+ measure asymmetry use two upper limb Assisting Hand Assessment ( AHA ) child , adolescent young hemiplegia age 5-19 year , compare age-matched typically develop subject ( TD ) .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>This study aim validate use Actigraphs evaluation tool upper limb asymmetry child / adolescent young adult typical development hemiplegia . The validation involve two stage : The first stage , carry clinical setting , provide use Actigraphs ( Actigraph GXT3+ subgroup also FitBit ) administration clinical test usually perform evaluation manual dominance individual hemiplegia also suitable typical development . This first phase allow compare quantitative measure acquire actigraphs ( e.g . mean activity hand asymmetry index i.e . difference mean activity two arm ) clinical standardized measure . The second phase , carry non-clinical setting , provide use Actigraphs ( Actigraph GXT3+ subgroup also FitBit ) subgroup subject involve first phase week order measure asymmetry index activity daily live .</detailed_description>
