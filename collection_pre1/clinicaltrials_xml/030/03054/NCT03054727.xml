	<brief_title>Long Term Assessment Post Thrombotic Syndrome : OPTIMEV Study ( SPOT )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Post thrombotic syndrome ( PTS ) refer chronic manifestation venous insufficiency follow deep vein thrombosis ( DVT ) . It frequent complication DVT , affect 40 % patient proximal DVT ( popliteal vein ) . Though lethal , PTS burdensome severly impact patient 's quality life ( QOL ) . In addition DVT , PTS find important predictor total medical cost . Thus PTS cosmetic problem constitutes real public health concern field VTE . However , far , many epidemiologic therapeutic issue remain unresolved . On epidemiologic point view , incidence PTS long term ( i.e . 5 year ) largely unknown . In addition , available reliable data risk PTS isolate distal DVT ( i.e . infrapopliteal DVT without pulmonary embolism ( PE ) , &gt; 50 % low limb DVT ) isolate PE . At last , risk independent predictor severe disable form PTS ( particularly venous claudication venous ulcer ) need assess ( absence old outdated data ) . On therapeutic point view , far curative treatment establish PTS . The cornerstone PTS ' treatment lie prevention via optimal anticoagulation therapy , use compression stocking ( effectiveness recently question SOX RCT trial ) sometimes thrombolysis case proximal DVT without bleed risk . Impact long term usual DVT treatment PTS natural history , prescribe routine clinical practice real life setting , never assess . Furthermore , absence identify independent predictor disable PTS constitute important break use assess full effectiveness invasive therapy . In perspective , investigator aim perform long term follow-up ( 12 year ) already constitute OPTIMEV cohort order try answer above-mentioned epidemiologic therapeutic unresolved issue . Objectives Primary objective : To assess incidence ( baseline till 12 year ) severity PTS , 12 year low limb DVT , calculate clinical Villalta score . Secondary objective : To assess long term ( 12 year ) 1 . Determine risk factor disable PTS ( DVT patient ) . 2 . Characterize incidence severity PTS accord VTE initial presentation ( isolated distal DVT , isolate proximal DVT , PE + DVT ) . 3 . Determine rate venous insufficiency unexposed population also expose population . 4 . Estimate impact PTS patient 's quality life . 5 . Assess incidence cancer population , compare expose patient non expose patient include OPTIMEV cohort . 6 . Assess incidence cardiovascular event population , compare expose patient non expose patient include OPTIMEV cohort . 7 . Assess incidence death population , compare expose patient non expose patient include OPTIMEV cohort . 8 . Assess incidence new DVT population , compare expose patient non expose patient include OPTIMEV cohort . 9 . Assess attributable risk DVT sign symptom chronic venous insufficiency DVT patient 10 . Determine whether correlation CUS finding PTS clinical severity 200 patient PTS ( Villalta &gt; = 5 ) . Methods Cohort study expose unexposed patient nest OPTIMEV multicentre observational study ( Clinical Trials NCT00670540 ) Constitution OPTIMEV cohort : From November 2004 January 2006 , 8256 patient suspicion symptomatic VTE ( low upper extremity DVT , PE ) enrol benefited objective test confirm rule suspicion VTE . This include bilateral whole leg compression CUS case suspicion DVT ; Baseline characteristic include patient 's demographic , sign , symptom &amp; risk factor VTE , venous status , result objective test treatment prospectively collect electronic case report form . Patients confirm VTE random selection control ( patient VTE rule baseline ) initially follow phone clinical research assistants 3 year use standardized questionnaire obtain information health-related event ( death , VTE recurrence , bleeding , arterial cardiovascular event , diagnosis cancer lower limb ulcer , hospitalization treatment ) . The general practitioner vascular medicine physician contact whenever possible event report patient 's history seem potentially unreliable . Medical record review case hospitalization new visit vascular physician follow- period . All suspected adverse event adjudicate study 's expert committee . At 3 year rate lose follow-up patient decline continue study low ( &lt; 3 % ) For long-term follow-up ( 12 year ) , patient VTE random selection patient free VTE consider . As per previous follow-up visit , clinical research assistant contact eligible patient use standardized questionnaire assess PTS/venous insufficiency use validate phone-questionnaire ( Villalta score Utne Sandset ) . Patients suspicion disable PTS/venous insufficiency random selection control refer participate vascular medicine physician clinical follow-up visit realization PTS assessment ( Villalta score CEAP ) whole limb CUS exploration venous system + Ankle Brachial Index ( ABI ) measurement ) . QOL questionnaires also fill . Statistical consideration Statistical analysis perform Themas team Grenoble . Based result pilot-feasibility study ( random selection 100 VTE patient , 15 % lose Follow-Up ( FU ) 5 % death ) , 1000 patient low limb DVT PE baseline ( `` expose '' patient ) attend clinical follow-up visit . This allow u estimate , precision plus menus 3 % incidence PTS 12 year 45 % precision plus menus 2.5 % incidence disable PTS 20 % . Perspectives This study improve knowledge long term incidence PTS accord various presentation VTE disease , impact routine clinical practice therapeutic management ( particularly compression therapy anticoagulation ) risk PTS , allow determine independent predictor disable PTS . On clinical practice point view , study assess benefit PTS preventative treatment isolate DVT isolate PE well select patient eligible invasive procedure .</detailed_description>
