	<brief_summary>This feasibility study test new trial design important drug Systemic Lupus Erythematosus ( SLE `` lupus '' ) . SLE autoimmune disease . The immune system attack body 's tissue , part body may affect , commonly lupus cause rash arthritis , affect patient ' quality life . Lupus usually treat steroid drug suppress immune system . Although help , many patient n't respond well enough also concern long term side effect . There new type treatment call biologics . These target individual cell molecule rather whole immune system may effective few side-effects . B cell part immune system know play role lupus . There already biologic remove , call rituximab . In rheumatoid arthritis vasculitis ( similar lupus ) , rituximab proven effective clinical trial . However , lupus clinical trial seem show benefit . But many doctor patient find rituximab effective , trial could n't show way drug 's effect measure . Therefore important test whether truly effective lupus . In 6 month clinical study investigator look lupus patient skin disease arthritis common randomise receive either rituximab placebo . Patients careful clinical examination undergo different method measure effectiveness treatment . There new version rituximab call `` biosimilars '' . In study biosimilar GP2013 use . If trial successful large definitive study design base result .</brief_summary>
