	<brief_summary>This research study evaluate combination study drug , venetoclax , standard chemotherapy regimen , EPOCH-R , possible treatment Richter 's Syndrome . The drug involve study : - Venetoclax - EPOCH-R : - Etoposide - Prednisone - Vincristine Sulfate ( Oncovin ) - Cyclophosphamide - Doxorubicin Hydrochloride ( Hydroxydaunomycin ) - Rituximab</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Phase II Study Venetoclax Combination With Dose-adjusted EPOCH-R Patients With Richter 's Syndrome</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This research study Phase II clinical trial . Phase II clinical trial test safety effectiveness investigational drug learn whether drug work treat specific disease . `` Investigational '' mean drug study . Tumor cell patient Richter 's Syndrome often resistant chemotherapy . One reason may protein call BCL-2 prevent cancer cell die exposed chemotherapy . Venetoclax oral drug specifically target BCL-2 . It already show highly effective kill tumor cell CLL patient whose cell resistant chemotherapy , lead FDA ( U.S. Food Drug Administration ) approval patient . A small number patient Richter 's Syndrome treat venetoclax single drug , patient improvement cancer treatment . In research study , investigator look see whether add venetoclax standard chemotherapy regimen , R-EPOCH , help chemotherapy work well effectively kill tumor cell patient Richter 's Syndrome . Venetoclax approve Richter 's Syndrome use combination chemotherapy , use trial consider investigational .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Must confirm diagnosis chronic lymphocytic leukemia small lymphocytic lymphoma per IWCLL 2008 criterion ( Hallek et al , 2008 ) biopsy prove transformation diffuse large B cell lymphoma ( DLBCL ) , consistent Richter 's Syndrome . Age great equal 18 year . Because CLL Richter 's Syndrome extremely rare person &lt; 18 year age , child exclude study . ECOG performance status &lt; 2 ( see Appendix A ) Patients must meet follow hematologic criterion screen , unless significant bone marrow involvement malignancy confirm biopsy : Absolute neutrophil count ≥1000 cells/mm3 ( 0.5 x 109/L ) . Growth factor allow achieve Platelet count ≥40,000 cells/mm3 ( 40 x 109/L ) independent transfusion within 7 day screen Subject must adequate coagulation , renal , hepatic function , per laboratory reference range Screening follow : Activated partial thromboplastin time ( aPTT ) prothrombin time ( PT ) exceed 1.5 × ULN ; Creatinine ≤ 1.5 x ULN creatinine clearance ≥ 50 mL/min use 24hour urine collection creatinine clearance Aspartate aminotransferase ( AST ) alanine aminotransferase ( ALT ) ≤ 3.0 × ULN ; Bilirubin ≤ 1.5 × ULN ; Subjects Gilbert 's Syndrome resolving autoimmune hemolytic anemia may bilirubin 3.0 × ULN still eligible The effect venetoclax develop human fetus unknown . For reason , woman childbearing potential men must agree use adequate contraception ( hormonal barrier method birth control ; abstinence ) prior study entry duration study participation . Should woman become pregnant suspect pregnant participating study , inform treat physician immediately Patients undergone prior allogeneic transplantation eligible provide significant active graft versus host disease transplant day 0 &gt; 6 month first dose chemotherapy Ability understand willingness sign write informed consent document Patients Hodgkin variant transformation CLL exclude History severe allergic anaphylactic reaction monoclonal antibody therapy chemotherapy drug use study ( see Appendix D ) , unless antibody give desensitization program consultation allergist Subject receive follow within 14 day 5 drug halflives ( whichever shortest ) prior first dose chemotherapy , recover less Grade 2 clinically significant adverse effect ( ) /toxicity ( ) previous therapy : Any anticancer therapy include chemotherapy , biologic agent antineoplastic treatment ( e.g . monoclonal antibody ) radiotherapy , investigational therapy , include target small molecule agent . History malignancy , except : Malignancy treat curative intent know active disease present first dose study drug felt low risk recurrence treat physician . Adequately treated nonmelanoma skin cancer lentigo maligna without evidence disease . Adequately treated carcinoma situ without evidence disease Lowrisk prostate cancer active surveillance Concurrent systemic immunosuppressant therapy ( eg , cyclosporine A , tacrolimus , etc . ) within 28 day first dose study drug . Corticosteroids allow , must dose prednisone 20 mg ( equivalent ) low prior start chemotherapy . Vaccinated live , attenuated vaccine within 4 week first dose study drug . Known bleed disorder ( eg , von Willebrand 's disease ) hemophilia . History stroke intracranial hemorrhage within 6 month prior enrollment . History human immunodeficiency virus ( HIV ) active hepatitis C virus ( HCV ) hepatitis B virus ( HBV ) . Patients positive hepatitis B core antibody hepatitis B surface antigen must negative polymerase chain reaction ( PCR ) result enrollment . Those PCR positive exclude . Any uncontrolled active systemic infection . Major surgery within 4 week first dose study drug . Any lifethreatening illness , medical condition , organ system dysfunction , investigator 's opinion , could compromise subject 's safety put study outcome undue risk . Currently active , clinically significant cardiovascular disease , uncontrolled arrhythmia Class 2 high congestive heart failure define New York Heart Association Functional Classification ; history myocardial infarction , unstable angina , acute coronary syndrome within 6 month prior randomization . Unable swallow capsule malabsorption syndrome , symptomatic inflammatory bowel disease ulcerative colitis , partial complete bowel obstruction time screen . Breastfeeding pregnant . Serum pregnancy test conduct . Male subject consider father child donate sperm study approximately 90 day last dose study drug . Unwilling unable participate require study evaluation procedure . Unable understand purpose risk study provide sign date informed consent form ( ICF ) authorization use protect health information ( accordance national local subject privacy regulation ) Patients receive study agent Patients know CNS involvement Baseline QTcF &gt; 480 m . NOTE : This criterion apply patient leave bundle branch block . Patients require warfarin vitamin K antagonists anticoagulation ( anticoagulant allow ) . Concurrent administration medication food strong inhibitor inducer CYP3A ( see Appendix B ) . Patients ongoing use prophylactic antibiotic eligible long evidence active infection antibiotic prohibit medication Unable receive prophylactic treatment pneumocystis , herpes simplex virus ( HSV ) , herpes zoster ( VZV ) start treatment Significant comorbid condition disease judgment Principal Investigator would place patient undue risk interfere study</criteria>
