	<brief_summary>Observational study clearly show people diabetes end-stage kidney failure increase risk foot ulceration leg amputation . However , little evidence address problem . Diabetes foot care team show reduce hospital admission , length stay leg amputation people diabetes . Since introduction The James Cook University Hospital ( JCUH ) major diabetes-related leg amputation rate fall 86 percent ( 1995 2010 ) . People diabetes end-stage kidney failure require haemodialysis ( blood cleaning ) 3 time per week several hour time . This time commitment make difficult attend clinical appointment . An audit JCUH show population fails attend normal diabetes foot service . This project aim reduce incidence foot disease people diabetes end-stage kidney failure dialysis . The investigator set podiatry-led intervention within dialysis unit prevent promptly treat foot disease population . This involve foot risk assessment , risk reduction treatment dialysis . The intervention involve diabetes consultant , podiatrist , vascular orthopaedic surgeon . In way investigator hope reduce leg amputation , hospital admission , procedure unblock artery death high risk group . The study run dialysis unit JCUH . Patients divide two group : attend dialysis Monday , Wednesday Friday form treatment group attend Tuesday , Thursday Saturday continue manage present . The investigator collect data patient health care record look particular leg amputation , hospital admission due foot problem , foot surgery operation unblock artery .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Podiatry Led MDT Intervention Reduce Burden Foot Disease Patients With End Stage Kidney Failure</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Diabetes large cause leg amputation kidney failure ; 15-20 % people diabetes foot ulcer lifetime , 5-10 % ulcer one time . The history foot ulcer person diabetes increase risk leg amputation 2-3 fold . A person diabetes 23 time likely leg amputation person without diabetes . The risk foot ulcer increase another four time risk leg amputation eight time people diabetes kidney failure dialysis compare diabetes normal kidney function . Kidney failure people diabetes increase 56 % 2006 2010 . Sixty per cent people diabetes leg amputation dead within 5 year . Those end stage kidney failure foot ulcer even bleaker outcome : 50 % alive 2 year . This reduce 26 % follow leg amputation . An audit 2014 patient attend dialysis unit hospital show half diabetes . Of , half foot ulcer point . Half ulcer time audit . Less one quarter foot ulcer review Diabetes Foot Team . National guidance state people diabetes foot ulcer see diabetes foot team within one work day ulcer detect . The investigator look evidence show reduce risk foot problem people diabetes end-stage kidney failure dialysis unable find evidence . Regional kidney diabetes specialist group confirm work address problem anywhere North East neither aware intervention anywhere UK . None lead Consultants UK work field diabetes-foot disease aware existence project like agreement need one . The exist literature show severity problem solution . The investigator plan provide evidence show effective cost-saving solution reduce burden diabetic foot disease people diabetes end-stage kidney failure People require dialysis attend dialysis unit 3 time week fix day fix session n't tend change . People diabetes kidney failure dialysis divide 2 group : treatment group comparator group . The treatment group dialysis Monday , Wednesday Friday . The comparator group dialysis Tuesday , Thursday Saturday The comparator group continue receive diabetes foot care use standard model existence present ( i.e . screen GP practice , podiatry review close home referral hospital diabetes foot team necessary ) The treatment group review podiatrist dialysis . The Podiatrist examine foot first meeting look diabetic foot problem , present , make standard assessment risk diabetic foot problem develop . Further management guide assessment . The population fall two group : without active foot problem high risk develop foot problem ; active foot disease ( e.g . foot ulcer ) . High risk patient without current foot problem receive package treatment aim prevent foot ulcer ( include education , removal hard skin , foot nail care , change shoe provision bespoke insole , cream podiatric review . Those active foot problem investigation treatment accord individual need , might include x-rays , test bacterial infection , blood test , removal hard skin , wound dressing offload . Treatments improve blood supply foot surgical removal infect tissue might need . This lead podiatrist . However , member diabetes foot care team ( MDT ) involve require , use exist weekly diabetes foot MDT meeting forum discussion patient . Other MDT member also see patient dialysis unit , thus provide patient-centred care .</detailed_description>
