	<brief_summary>This multicenter run-in phase Ib / roll-over phase II study triple target drug combination ( HER2-targeted small molecule inhibitor tucatinib , CDK4/6 inhibitor palbociclib aromatase inhibitor letrozole ) first second line therapy patient metastatic hormone receptor positive HER2-positive breast cancer .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Tucatinib , Palbociclib Letrozole Metastatic Hormone Receptor Positive HER2-positive Breast Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This multicenter , single arm , open-label , run-in phase Ib / roll-over phase II study novel HER2-targeted tyrosine kinase inhibitor tucatinib combination CDK4/6 inhibitor palbociclib aromatase inhibitor letrozole subject HR+/HER2+ locally advance unresectable metastatic breast cancer . The study enroll post-menopausal woman premenopausal woman treatment willing treated standard ovarian suppression . The phase Ib part study determine safety tolerability combination tucatinib , palbociclib letrozole confirm current RP2D tucatinib FDA approve dose palbociclib remain triplet combination . The dose letrozole constant study period . Once safety combination establish , move phase II part study expansion cohort subject RP2D purpose assess efficacy refine assessment safety combination treatment .</detailed_description>
