	<brief_title>Hemodynamic Assessment Distal Revascularization Interval Ligation</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This study involve identification patient ischemic steal deem candidate distal revascularization interval ligation ( DRIL ) , follow prospective data collection intraoperative noninvasive data key point operation . After informed consent , chart review perform identify patient characteristic well detail presentation steal syndrome , include symptomatology , duration , characteristic contributory arteriovenous access , preoperative data include upper extremity/forearm pressure , fistula flow data , finger pressure without fistula compression . Patients noninvasive intraoperative measurement bilateral forearm blood pressure measurement use automate blood pressure cuff within sterile band operative side well contralateral ( `` control '' ) side . Automated blood pressure measurement perform four time point operation , simultaneously arm ( operative versus control ) : 1 . After surgical exposure intervention perform , 2 . After clamp brachial artery dissection control vessel assess effect interval ligation ( IL ) alone forearm blood pressure . 3 . After performance distal revascularization ( DR ) BEFORE interval ligation brachial artery . 4 . After completion procedure , include distal revascularization AND interval ligation ( DRIL ) . The performance blood pressure measurement alter performance operation , influence intraoperative decision-making . Intraoperative patient position set-up unaffected addition distal forearm blood pressure cuff data acquisition . Neither pre-operative selection post-operative care influence participation study , data acquire . It note technique intermittently use standard care need current practice . Patients assess symptom improvement DRIL patency standard 14 day , 3 month , 6 month , 9 month 1 year follow visit .</detailed_description>
