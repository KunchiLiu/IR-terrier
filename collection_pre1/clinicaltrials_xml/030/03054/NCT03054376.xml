	<brief_summary>The study include healthy young habitually active subject . All subject subject two week immobilization one leg follow four week train leg . The subject randomize either one-leg training non-immobilized leg two-week immobilization period train non-immobilized leg immobilization period . Measures include skeletal muscle morphology , marker angiogenesis apoptosis , muscle metabolic marker , vascular function , vascular protein performance .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>One leg young healthy subject immoblized two week . Changes angiogenic protein marker apoptosis muscle tissue muscle extracellular fluid determine legs parallel functional consequence immobilization assess . Vascular function vascular protein also determine . In order understand oxidative capacity muscle alter parallel change capillarization , marker mitochondria measure .Half subject randomize single-leg training immobilization period ass whether simultaneous train reduces loss capillary , muscle function vascular function immobilize leg . After immobilization period study participant train immobilized leg control leg four week moderate intense interval cycle training parameteres immobilization assess leg . The study also include measurement circulate compound platelet blood .</detailed_description>
