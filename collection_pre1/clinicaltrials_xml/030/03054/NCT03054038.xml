	<brief_summary>This phase I trial study side effect best dose afatinib necitumumab see well work treat patient EGFR mutation positive non-small cell lung cancer spread place body . Afatinib may stop growth tumor cell block enzymes need cell growth . Monoclonal antibody , necitumumab , may interfere ability tumor cell grow spread . Giving afatinib necitumumab may work well treat patient EGFR mutation positive non-small cell lung cancer .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Afatinib Necitumumab Patients With EGFR Mutation Positive Advanced Metastatic Non-small Cell Lung Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To determine maximum tolerate dose combination afatinib necitumumab therapy EGFR mutation positive non-small cell lung cancer ( NSCLC ) patient progress follow first- third-generation EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitor ( TKIs ) . II . To determine efficacy safety profile afatinib necitumumab combination therapy patient EGFR mutation positive NSCLC patient progress follow first- third-generation EGFR TKIs . OUTLINE : This dose-escalation study . Patients receive afatinib orally ( PO ) daily ( QD ) day 1-28 necitumumab intravenously ( IV ) 60 minute day 1 15 . Courses repeat every 28 day absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . After completion study treatment , patient follow 28 day every 3 month 1 year .</detailed_description>
