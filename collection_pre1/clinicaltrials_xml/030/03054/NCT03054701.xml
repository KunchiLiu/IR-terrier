	<detailed_description>Background : Patellofemoral pain ( PFP ) high prevalence adolescent adult population ( 7 % 15 % ) much 91 % affected experience ongoing knee pain 20 year initial diagnosis . Exercise-based treatment focus strengthen muscle around hip knee usually effective treat patient PFP . However , approach proven ineffective subgroup females long-standing PFP . This group find altered condition pain modulation indicate facilitated central mechanism . A localized analgesic effect exercise distant non-painful muscle observe previously patient long-standing musculoskeletal pain . This known exercise induce hypoalgesia . In relation , increased condition pain modulation find predictor increase effect exercise induce hypoalgesia , indicate link two mechanism . The aim study ass exercise distant non-painful muscle around hip large acute analgesic effect localize knee pain compare knee specific exercise female patient long-standing PFP . Study design : This study randomize , control , participant assessor blind crossover study . The study conduct Research Unit General Practice Aalborg . Reporting study follow CONSORT guideline randomize trial Non-pharmacologic Treatment . Method : Thirty woman age 20 25 current knee pain experience ongoing recurrent duration 5 year randomize either knee hip specific resistance exercise first intervention . After washout period 15 minute , participant perform exercise . The participant undergo test-procedure first exercise , exercise final exercise . The test-procedure consist handheld pressure algometry cuff pressure algometry assess pain pressure threshold , pain detection threshold pain tolerance threshold . Condition pain modulation temporal summation pain assess cuff algometry . In order ass knee pain relation exercise , participant ask rate knee pain exercise set . The primary outcome pain pressure threshold assess handheld pressure algometry center patella test limb . Recruitment : A random sample participant APA2011 cohort experience ongoing PFP 2016 invite participate study . The participant contact telephone invite participate study . Verbal information regard study provide phone write material send e-mail . In case cohort provide insufficient number participant , patient general practice seek invited participate . This process do collaboration general practice clinic area . If combination above-mentioned strategy provide required number participant , online social-medias like Facebook Twitter use mean obtain sufficient number participant . Allocation sequence : The participant randomize either sit knee extension sidelying hip abduction first . A computer generate allocation sequence conduct www.random.org independent researcher . This individual put slip paper , say either `` Hip '' `` Knee '' opaque seal envelope . The envelope mark sequential number . When first participant underwent baseline test assign ID number 1 ( ID1 ) . After complete baseline test participant proceed exercise room exercise instructor wait . The exercise instructor select envelope mark `` ID1 '' note participant assign hip knee exercise first exercise . Familiarization session : Before exercise , load participant exactly 12 repetition establish use elastic band different elastic ability . This also work familiarization session participant get know exercise . For familiarization session , black elastic band use default sit knee extension exercise , whereas yellow elastic band use sidelying hip abduction exercise . If participant capable perform less 10-12 repetition default elastic band , length color change ensure participant exercise 12RM . Precautions : Participants ask withstand caffeine , alcohol , nicotine physically exhaust activity 24 hour undertake study protocol show dampen effect pain . Due nature study , participant encourage withstand take analgesic day undergo study protocol . Data analysis : A preliminary analysis see order exercise effect result conduct . To investigate statistically significant difference PPT , pain detection threshold ( PDT ) pain tolerance threshold ( PTT ) VAS score measure three time-points , repeat measure analysis variance ( ANOVA ) undertaken data find normally distribute . If data normally distribute Kruskal-Wallis test apply instead . This data present mean , standard deviation , f-value p-value . For PPT , PDT PTT mean difference 50 kPa consider clinically relevant . In addition , association knee pain intensity baseline test EIH response hip versus knee exercise investigate . By test possible ass great knee pain intensity large EIH response hip exercise compare knee exercise . To assess flare pain exercise mean change numeric pain rating start finish set within exercise ( hip knee ) calculate . To investigate correlation handle PPT measure three site ( center patella test limb , belly m. tibialis anterior muscle og test limb epicondyle contralateral elbow ) test correlation conduct . In order examine flare pain exercise behave way TSP , test correlation two variable conduct . Sample size : A group 10 healthy subject volunteered participate pilot study prior recruitment current study . Data regard handheld PPT measure center patella use calculate sample size require power study . The mean difference handheld PPT hip exercise knee exercise within group 44 kPa correspond standard deviation 80 kPa . These data use two-sided power analysis two pair mean conduct STATA . With significant level 0.05 power set 0.8 , minimum 28 participant would require power study . However , 30 participant include order insure study adequately power case miss data due system malfunction effect size turn low anticipated 0.55 . This randomized study embed within large cross-sectional study approve ethical committee approval number ( N-20160058 ) .

	<criteria>Participants PFP require current nontraumatic anterior retropatellar knee pain experience ongoing recurrently duration least 5 year . At least two follow daily activity provoke kneerelated symptom : prolonged sit kneeling , squat , run , hopping , stair walking , tenderness palpation patella double leg squatting . Worst pain previous week 3 cm 10cm visual analog scale ( VAS ) . Patients sustain traumatic injury hip , knee , ankle lumbar spine within past 3 month exclude . Other identifiable knee condition isolation ( , occur concurrently PFP . As example , subject isolate patellar tendinopathy exclude . If subject PFP concurrent pain patellar tendon , include ) . Individuals rheumatoid arthritis , knee joint effusion , selfreported patellofemoral instability , know malign condition , neurological disease previously knee surgery exclude well . In case suspicion serious pathology rheumatologist consult .</criteria>
