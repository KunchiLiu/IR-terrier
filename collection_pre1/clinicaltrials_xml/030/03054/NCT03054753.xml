	<brief_summary>The postoperative shoulder rehabilitation abduction brace rotator cuff reconstruction shoulder crucial successful heal reconstruction . In study investigator want analyse abduction brace-wearing time use electronic sensor , implanted abduction brace . The participant inform sensor completion abduction brace rehabilitation 6 week postoperatively .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Prospective Sensor Controlled Compliance Analysis Shoulder Abduction Splint After Rotator Cuff Repair</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>After arthroscopic reconstruction rotator cuff tear heal depends tension free positioning reconstruct tendon . Therefore abduction brace administer routinely 6 week . The re-rupture rate rotator cuff reconstruction 30 % . One reason may mechanical overuse cause non wear abduction brace . From experience investigator suggest abduction brace wear behaviour differs among patient . The participant´s wear compliance evaluate Silverio et al . questionary never sensor . In study investigator want analyse participant´s abduction brace wear compliance use sensor , implanted abduction brace monitor wear time , reveals objective wearing time . The sensor certificate sensor , measure temperature °C every 15 min . If abduction brace worn participant body temperature capture sensor . If measure temperature 33°C sensor capture time period `` worn '' time . With measurement abduction brace wear time capture objectively . A similar kind sensor use evaluate wearing time scoliosis-braces patient adolescent idiopathic scoliosis ( Miller DJ eta al. , Morton A et al. , Takemitsu et al . ) With questionary participant ask wearing time inform implanted sensor . This answer represent subjective wearing time . The first endpoint study evaluation objective subjective abduction wear time . The second endpoint evaluation correlation compliance subjective outcome .</detailed_description>
