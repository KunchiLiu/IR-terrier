	<brief_summary>Patients history two recurrent pregnancy loss ( RPL ) history live baby perform investigation recurrent miscarriage ( RM ) include : laboratory investigation , trans vaginal ultrasound ( TVS ) , autoimmune work hystroscopy result free , schedule three dimensional trans-vaginal ultrasound ( 3D TVS ) midluteal phase measure impedance uterine artery blood flow ( two dimensional Power Doppler TVS ) .Also use 3D power Doppler sub-endometrial blood flow assess . In addition thickness Junctional Zone ( JZ ) use coronal view 3 D TVS . To compare patient least one full term live baby normal vaginal delivery history early pregnancy loss .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Among patient attend Recurrent pregnancy loss outpatient clinic kasr Al Aini teach hospital , Cairo University .Those meeting investigator inclusion criterion select study . All patient history two consecutive , first trimester miscarriage . Patients two miscarriage include study since equal frequency abnormal test result demonstrate among patient two miscarriage . Accordingly , American College Obstetrics Gynecologists state evaluation couple two consecutive miscarriage initiate . All woman undergo extensive examination , investigation ( laboratory , TVS hystroscopy ) order evaluate know etiological factor RPL . Only Patients free examination normal investigation enrol study . Healthy fertile woman attend outpatient clinic obstetrics gynecology kasr Al Aini hospital , Cairo university , routine scan recruit control group . Inclusion criterion require absence previous miscarriage presence least one previous uncomplicated pregnancy . Women history pelvic disease abnormal finding ultrasound examination exclude study . The thickness morphology JZ evaluate uterine coronal view obtain 3D TVS . Endometrial thickness measure subendometrial blood flow ( vascularization index VI , flow index FI vascularization flow index VFI ) obtain 3D power Doppler . The sonographic evaluation perform midluteal phase cycle ( 18th 22nd cycle day ) , avoid possible hormonal influence , use E8 ( GE Healthcare , Zipf , Austria ) ultrasound machine equip multifrequency 3D volume endovaginal probe ( 2.8-10 MHz ) . The examination include 2D-TVS evaluation pelvic organ exclude abnormality . Transvaginal Doppler flow measurement impendence uterine artery blood flow perform . In order evaluate JZ coronal view uterus obtain use 3D-TVS . Two four static grey-scale volume uterus obtain sagittal plane transverse plane . The volume acquisition technique perform standardized fashion . Recent study indicate use criterion allow assessment JZ reproducible enough used clinical practice . In particular : frequency , 6-9 MHz ; magnification uterus half screen ; sweep angle , 1208 ; sweep velocity adjust medium maximum quality ; 3D volume box exceed uterus 1 cm side . The coronal view reconstruction technique involve place straight curve line ( OmniView render mode ) along endometrial stripe sagittal transverse view . The multiplanar view manipulate satisfactory coronal image obtain uterine external profile cavity , bilateral visualization interstitial portion Fallopian tube . Volume contrast imaging ( VCI ) apply ( 2- 4 mm slice thickness ) volume render ( mixed light surface gradient light ) . Following acquisition , ultrasound volume store subsequent offline analysis . On coronal view JZ appear hypo-echoic zone around endometrium . JZ measurement therefore perform 3D multi-planar view use VCI . Disruption infiltration hypo-echoic JZ hyper-echoic endometrial tissue evaluate JZ thickness measure distance basal endometrium internal layer outer myometrium . The minimum ( JZmin ) , maximum ( JZmax ) difference maximum minimum JZ ( JZmax - JZmin ) thickness assess . The JZmax JZmin define large small JZ thickness measure coronal longitudinal section level uterus ( fundus anterior , posterior lateral wall ) .</detailed_description>
