	<brief_summary>CYP2D6 characterize huge variability general population , mainly genetic polymorphism drug-drug interaction ( DDIs ) . CYP2D6 genotype know impact extent DDIs . Indeed several study point differential DDIs extent accord CYP2D6 genotype . The term phenoconversion phenotype switch use describe phenomenon give subject change phenotype another due external influence DDIs . When give sufficiently strong CYP2D6 inhibitor , phenotype individual mutant allele ( extensive metabolizer , EM ) CYP2D6 modify poor metabolizer ( PM ) phenotype . This vulnerability also think dependent CYP2D6 genotype . Various combination allele predict EM genotype , represent 60 70 % general population . The aim study determine whether presence genetic mutation CYP2D6 impact DDIs involve CYP2D6 enzyme . Our interest focus CYP2D6 EM carrier two fully functional allele carrier one non-functional one functional allele . In order elucidate question , CYP2D6 activity measure healthy volunteer administration single low dos dextromethorphan tramadol presence duloxetine paroxetine , two know CYP2D6 inhibitor .</brief_summary>
