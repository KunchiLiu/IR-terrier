	<brief_title>Phase II Study Ibrutinib Patients With Relapsed Refractory Marginal Zone Lymphoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Patient sample : Patients histologically prove marginal zone lymphoma ( splenic , nodal extra-nodal subtypes include ) . Other important requirement recruitment study : - Prior treatment one line rituximab rituximab-based chemoimmunotherapy failure achieve least partial response ( PR ) document disease progression - Age ≥ 21 year age - Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group ( ECOG ) performance status 0-2 - At least 1 measurable disease site compute tomography ( CT ) scan least 1.5cm long dimension . - Patient must indication treatment e.g. , symptoms disease , bulky disease ( &gt; 5cm ) , threaten end-organ function , cytopenia require transfusion growth factor support Dosage Dose Regimen : 560mg Ibrutinib administer orally daily . Patients mild liver impairment ( Child's-Pugh A ) , ibrutinib 140mg ( 1 x 140mg capsule ) administer instead . The patient continue treatment one following occur : - Patient disease progression ( assessed investigator ) . - Patient intercurrent illness adverse event prevents ibrutinib administration . - Patient decide withdraw study . - Investigator considers withdrawal best interest patient . - Patient require continuous therapy prohibit concomitant medication alternative medication therapy available replacement prohibit medication . - Patient lose follow-up . - Patient non-compliant . - Patient becomes pregnant . - Study termination Sponsor regulatory authority . - Death - Completed 3 year ibrutinib treatment Assessment : CT Neck pelvis FDG-PET/CT skull base mid-thigh perform repeat every 12 week Statistical consideration : The primary objective study determine efficacy ibrutinib Asian patient relapse refractory MZL . We consider ORR 50 % desirable . Simon 's 2-stage minimax design use test null hypothesis overall response rate le equal 20 % ( response rate consider clinically compel ) . Twelve subject include first stage , least 3 responder , total 21 subject enrol . The treatment declare ineffective less 8 responder total . This design 90 % power detect overall response rate 50 % 5 % significance level . Study Endpoints : Primary : 1 . Overall response rate ( complete remission [ CR ] + partial remission [ PR ] ) Secondary : 1 . Survival parameter - Progression-free survival - Overall survival 2 . Safety - Frequency severity adverse event - Frequency AE require discontinuation study drug dose reduction Total sample size : The planned sample size 21 patient enrolled multiple centre Singapore South Korea</detailed_description>
