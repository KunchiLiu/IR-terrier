	<brief_title>Study Aerosol Gemcitabine Patients With Solid Tumors Pulmonary Metastases</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Study Drug Administration : If find eligible take part study , participant assign dose level gemcitabine base participant join study . Up 6 dose level gemcitabine test . Up 3 participant enrol dose level . The first group participant receive low dose level . Each new group receive high dose group , intolerable side effect see . This continue high tolerable dose gemcitabine find . Each study cycle 28 day . Participants visit clinic start every cycle receive dos study drug next cycle . Participants provide machine call nebulizer make gemcitabine mist . To take study drug , participant breathe drug mist mouthpiece nebulizer . Participant take gemcitabine mist 2 time week 4 week ( 28 day ) . The study staff tell participant day take study drug . If doctor think participant 's best interest , participant may continue receive study drug 12 cycle . Length Study : Participant may continue take study drug 12 cycle . Participant longer able take study drug disease get bad , intolerable side effect occur , participant unable follow study direction . If participant develop tumor outside lung either participant study , doctor think participant 's best interest , participant may local control procedure ( radiation surgery ) , may help control disease continue receive study drug . Participant would sign separate consent form explain procedure risk . Participation study participant 's last follow-up phone call . Study Visits : Within 3 day Day 1 every cycle : - Participant physical exam . - Blood ( 4 teaspoon ) draw routine test check participant 's liver function . - Participant PFTs . - Participant participant 's blood oxygen level measure pulse oximeter . - If participant become pregnant , urine collect pregnancy test . On Day 8 Cycle 1 : - Participant physical exam . - Blood ( 4 teaspoon ) draw routine test check participant 's liver function . Participant CT scan time Cycles 2 , 4 , 6 , every 3 cycle . The study doctor tell participant participant scan . To avoid come study clinic often , participant may blood draw do participant 's personal doctor . Participant may call study staff ask participant side effect 1 day participant 's first 2 dos study drug , end Cycle 1 , 1 time every 3 month participant leaf study study end . These call last 15-20 minute time . This investigational study . Gemcitabine FDA approve commercially available treatment pancreatic lung cancer , solid tumor . Its administration inhalation investigational . The study doctor explain study drug design work . Up 44 participant enrol study . All take part MD Anderson .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>1 . Patients diagnosis solid tumor lung metastases patient 's current disease state must one know curative therapy therapy proven prolong survival acceptable quality life . 2 . Willing comply protocol therapy require safety monitoring ( selfreport , pulse oximetry , remote spirometry , lab ) . 3 . Adequate organ function define : peripheral absolute neutrophil count ( ANC ) ≥ 1,000/mm3 , platelet count ≥ 100,000/mm3 ( transfusion independent define receive platelet transfusion within 7 day period prior enrollment ) , hemoglobin ≥ 8.0g/dl ( may receive RBC transfusion ) , renalcreatinine ≤ 2 x ULN ; hepatic bilirubin AST ≤ 5x ULN ; pulmonary : FVC ≥50 % predict , Oxyhemoglobin saturation rest ≥95 % ( supplemental oxygen ) . 4 . Patient age ≥ 12 year ≤ 50 year . 5 . Performance Status : ECOG ≤ 2 patient ≥ 16 year old Lansky play ≥ 60 % patient ≤15 year old . 6 . Patients must resolution acute toxic effect ( exclude alopecia ) prior anticancer therapy NCI CTCAE Grade ≤ 1 baseline laboratory value define inclusion criterion . 7 . No radiotherapy within 2 week . 8 . Subjects receive GCB systemically previously eligible participation . 1 . Currently treat bronchodilator corticosteroid know active asthma . This include patient suffer asthma child outgrew . 2 . Pregnant breastfeed woman enter study due risk fetal teratogenic adverse event see animal study . Pregnancy test must obtain female postmenarchal childbearing potential ( e.g . female amenorrheic least 12 consecutive month surgically sterilize ) . Males female reproductive potential participate unless agree use effective contraception entire period receive protocol therapy least one month treatment end . Effective contraception define intrauterine device ( IUD ) , hormonal ( birth control pill , injection , implant , patch ) , tubal ligation partner 's vasectomy . Abstinence acceptable method birth control . 3 . Uncontrolled intercurrent illness include , limited , ongoing active infection , bradycardia , related cardiac disease , bundle branch block , symptomatic congestive heart failure , unstable angina pectoris , cardiac arrhythmia , psychiatric illness/social situation would limit compliance study requirement . 4 . Subjects baseline symptom fever and/or cough and/or shortness breath and/or wheeze and/or fatigue grade ≥ 2 ( CTCAE v4.0 ) . 5 . Patients receive concurrent cancer therapy include chemotherapy , immunotherapy , biologic therapy . 6 . Unresolved toxicity prior anticancer therapy , define resolve NCI CTCAE Grade ≤1 exception alopecia laboratory value list per inclusion criterion . Subjects irreversible toxicity reasonably expect exacerbated investigational product may include ( eg , hear loss ) .</criteria>
