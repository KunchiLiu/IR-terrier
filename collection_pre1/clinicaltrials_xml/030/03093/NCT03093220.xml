	<brief_summary>Community-acquired pneumonia ( CAP ) heterogeneous disease cause great morbidity , mortality health care burden globally . Typing method discriminate different clinical condition disease essential well management CAP . Traditional type system base separately clinical manifestation ( PSI CURB-65 ) , pathogen ( bacterial type , virulence , drug resistance , etc ) host immune state ( immunocompetent , immunocompromised immunodeficiency ) . Thus , barely able represent real disease status precisely predict mortality . As development multi-omic technology , relatedness different phenotype molecular level revolutionize ability differentiate among patient . Our study aim establish novel molecular type method CAP . Multi-omic ( include genomics , transcriptomes , metabolism ) data obtain enrolled CAP patient isolated pathogen would integrate analyzed interpret . Tthe investigator believe appropriate molecular typing method would lead revolutionary change current arrangement CAP .</brief_summary>
