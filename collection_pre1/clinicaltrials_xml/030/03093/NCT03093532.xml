	<detailed_description>Effective intervention address uncontrolled hypertension ( HTN ) , particularly underrepresented population use emergency department ( ED ) primary care , critically need . Uncontrolled HTN , contribute significantly cardiovascular morbidity mortality , frequently encounter among patient present ED . EDs serve point entry health care system many high-risk patient population , particularly minority low-income individual . Our preliminary data largely minority patient population present ED show significant rate subclinical heart disease ( diastolic dysfunction leave ventricular hypertrophy ) patient elevate blood pressure ( BP ) . These early echocardiogram change reversible exist strategy improve BP control . The propose project underscore 1 ) The prevalence uncontrolled/undiagnosed HTN among ED patient underrepresented group primary care physician ( PCP ) alarmingly high , 2 ) ED engagement early risk assessment/stratification facilitate PCP follow-up novel feasible innovation help address health disparity gap HTN . The central hypothesis proposal ED-based screening , brief intervention , referral treatment program HTN ( SBIRT-HTN ) use exist ED resource , couple follow-up visit ED pharmacist-initiated Post-Acute Care Hypertension Transition Clinic ( PACHT-c ) , improve BP control patient empowerment , facilitate PCP follow-up rate , consequently improve treatment compliance predominately underrepresented hypertensive population . This proposal strengthen exist partnership academic urban ED Federally Qualified Health Center ( FQHC ) model integrate secondary cardiovascular prevention population high risk complication due uncontrolled/undiagnosed HTN . Moreover , proposal innovative prospective randomize controlled trial high-risk ED patient population establish PCP persistent elevate BPs . Eligible patient elevate BP establish PCP ( PCP contact past year ) present University Illinois Hospital &amp; Health Sciences System ( UI Health ) ED . The three arm : 1 ) usual care ( current practice passive outpatient referral follow-up care ) , 2 ) ED-based SBIRT-HTN program ( patient empowerment tool ) use exist ED resource follow assisted referral usual care , 3 ) ED base SBIRT-HTN coupled 48-hour follow-up visit ED pharmacist-initiated Post-Acute Care Hypertension Transition Clinic ( PACHT-c ) follow assisted referral primary care . The aims evaluate effectiveness intervention ( SBIRT-HTN &amp; PACHTC-c ) uncontrolled BP 6 month . The primary outcome BP improvement . Based demographic ED population study site ( 70 % current UI Health ED population ethnic minority ) , majority participant underrepresented minority ( African-American Hispanic/Latino ) low-income individual . The investigator propose follow specific aim hypothesis : Aim 1 : Evaluate effectiveness ED-initiated SBIRT-HTN program BP control 6 month post intervention compare usual care . H1 : Early identification initiation risk stratification algorithm involve non-invasive assessment ( limited echocardiogram ) early subclinical cardiovascular disease ( combined patient education regard HTN &amp; cardiovascular complication ( patient empowerment ) point-of contact ED ( arm 2 ) result great BP control 6 month compare usual care group ( arm 1 ) . Aim 2 : Evaluate impact PACHT-c component ED-based SBIRT-HTN program BP control 6 month post intervention compare usual care ED-SBIRT-HTN alone . H2 : The PACHT-c component ( arm 3 ) result great BP control compare randomize usual care ( arm 1 ) ED-based SBIRT-HTN alone ( arm 2 ) .</detailed_description>
