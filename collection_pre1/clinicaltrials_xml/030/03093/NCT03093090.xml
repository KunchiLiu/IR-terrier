	<brief_summary>Poorly absorb medication furosemide common recent experiment suggest improvement absorption occur type medication consume liquid milk . The purpose study evaluate absorption furosemide normal adult take bottled water , milk ( Parmalat™ Whole Milk ) , baby formula ( Similac Pro-Advance™ ) , Ensure Plus™ . These result use make model predict liquid affect drug absorption child , potentially provide way improve medication absorption child .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Low solubility drug common pharmacopeia estimate 40 % new chemical entity develop pharmaceutical industry practically insoluble water . Exploratory vitro study CDER recently demonstrate solubility , thus potentially bioavailability , poorly soluble drug may highly enhance administer milk ( Parmalat™ Whole Milk ) baby formula ( Similac Pro-Advance™ ) . While reason variable bioavailability furosemide well characterize , effect gastric pH , food dose liquid commonly observe absorption BCS Class IV drug . Absorption variability much great child due developmental change factor gastric fluid , blood flow intestine , bile acid composition/secretion , intestinal surface area drug metabolize enzyme transporter abundance . Therefore , critical determine physio-chemical physiological interaction furosemide explain inter-subject inter-dosing variability . An integrated vitro , silico vivo pharmacology approach study effect dose liquid PK PD furosemide novel . Quantitative understanding factor affect furosemide absorption first evaluate use vitro test solubility , dissolution protein bind dose liquid . The physiochemical information relevant drug absorption elimination curated literature build PBPK model . Such vitro- vivo extrapolation ( IVIVE ) link PBPK model approach crucial good characterize furosemide 's variable bioavailability . Another novel aspect study include renal metabolism furosemide PBPK model . While plasma concentration critical determine rate extent furosemide absorption , renal elimination primary contributor PD response furosemide delivery drug luminal surface renal tubule require . PBPK model allows extrapolation model special population . For example , model optimize validated predict effect dose liquid adult PK furosemide vitro data , approach extrapolate child use pediatric gut physiological parameter . This novel approach allow prediction furosemide PK PD child without conduct clinical study difficult study population .</detailed_description>
