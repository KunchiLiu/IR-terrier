	<brief_summary>This randomize , two-arm , open-label Phase II multicenter study design examine effect add bevacizumab ixabepilone treatment patient recurrent persistent platinum-resistant/refractory epithelial ( non-mucinous ) ovarian , fallopian tube , primary peritoneal cancer . Its primary objective ass whether add bevacizumab ixabepilone improve progression-free survival target population .

	<brief_title>Evaluation Weekly Ixabepilone With Without Biweekly Bevacizumab</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The primary objective study follow : - To assess activity ixabepilone bevacizumab compare ixabepilone alone patient recurrent persistent platinum-resistant/refractory epithelial ( non-mucinous ) ovarian , fallopian tube , primary peritoneal cancer . We assess compare ixabepilone +bevacizumab ( experimental ) arm ixabepilone-alone ( control ) arm improvement median progression free survival ( PFS ) . The secondary objective study follow : - To compare experimental arm control arm increase objective response rate ( ORR ) durable disease control rate ( DDCR ) . - To compare experimental arm control arm increase overall survival ( OS ) . - To assess safety profile ixabepilone combination bevacizumab ovarian , fallopian tube , primary peritoneal cancer patient . - To assess whether prior treatment bevacizumab impact future response bevacizumab combination ixabepilone . In addition primary secondary objective study , additional exploratory/correlative objective . The exploratory/correlative objective study follow : - To characterize number , length composition ( e.g. , class III β-tubulin expression ) microtentacles ( McTNs ) isolate circulate tumor cell isolated whole blood patient undergoing treatment ixabepilone without bevacizumab , correlate best response , PFS , OS . - To observe McTNs circulate tumor cell blood use novel polyelectrolyte multi-layer ( PEM ) tether technology . - To correlate ex vivo response McTNs drug treatment clinical response order develop real-time assay predict response therapy . - To explore use circulate tumor ( ct ) DNA biomarker disease response compare performance CA-125 . - To examine whether clinical response ixabepilone without bevacizumab differs high low expressors class III β-tubulin .</detailed_description>
