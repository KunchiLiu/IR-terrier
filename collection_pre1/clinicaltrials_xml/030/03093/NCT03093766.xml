	<brief_summary>The goal study find difference patient develop ICU-acquired hypernatremia ( IAH ) . Therefore extended sodium fluid balance perform . Also couple factor possibly contribute development IAH and/or could give clue mechanisms development IAH investigate .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Balance Study ICU-acquired Hypernatremia Sodium Handling ( BIAS )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>ICU-acquired hypernatremia ( IAH ) common critically ill patient , 's aetiology still fully understood . Sodium overload inadequate fluid administration generally consider important factor , previous retrospective study reveal difference sodium fluid balance patient develop IAH . Because retrospective balance prospectively study study sure importance balance development IAH . Previous study indicate ( lot ) factor contribute development IAH . In study factor investigate , hop find difference patient develop IAH .</detailed_description>
