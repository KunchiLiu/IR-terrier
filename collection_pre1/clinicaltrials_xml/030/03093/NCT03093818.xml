	<brief_title>PREemptive Pharmacogenomic Testing Preventing Adverse Drug REactions</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Pre-emptive pharmacogenomic testing implement clinical site across seven European country ( United Kingdom , The Netherlands , Austria , Greece , Slovenia , Italy Spain ) . The 36-month study split two 18-month block . The participate country randomize start either implement pharmacogenomics guide prescribe standard care first block . In pharmacogenomics guide prescribe arm , result pharmacogenomic test incorporate ( electronic ) medical record may use physician pharmacist guide drug dose selection 42 routinely prescribed drug , per Dutch Pharmacogenomics Working Group guideline . In standard care arm , patient receive pharmacogenomic testing . After 18-month block , country switch implement opposite strategy recruit new patient . Patients eligible participation receive first prescription one 42 drug Dutch Pharmacogenomic Working Group guideline available ( acenocoumarol , amitriptyline , aripiprazole , atomoxetine , atorvastatin , azathioprine , capecitabine , carbamazepine , citalopram , clomipramine , clopidogrel , clozapine , codeine , doxepin , efavirenz , escitalopram , flecainide , flucloxacillin , fluorouracil , haloperidol , imipramine , irinotecan , mercaptopurine , metoprolol , nortryptiline , oxycodone , paroxetine , phenprocoumon , phenytoin , pimozide , propafenon , sertraline , simvastatin , tacrolimus , tamoxifen , tegafur , thioguanine , tramadol , venlafaxine , voriconazole , warfarin zuclopenthixol ) . All patient follow minimum three month maximum 18 month . In total , 8,100 patient recruit ; 4,050 receive pharmacogenomic testing , 4,050 receive standard care . Each implementation site concentrate , limited , recruit patient within specific therapeutic area . Therapeutic area include primary care , general medicine , cardiology , oncology , psychiatry , neurology , transplantation . It hypothesize implement pharmacogenomics guide drug dose selection decrease incidence clinically relevant adverse drug reaction 30 % ( 4 % 2.8 % ) .</detailed_description>
