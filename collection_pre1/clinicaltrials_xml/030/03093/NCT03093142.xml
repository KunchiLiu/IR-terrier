	<brief_summary>This double blind , randomize control trial pretest-posttest control interventional group design . Both assessor participant blind assessment evaluation . All patient subacute stroke undergo in-patient out-patient rehabilitation screen initially series screen test . Suitable patient assign randomly 3 group respectively . Group 1 combine transcranial direct current stimulation ( tDCS ) neurofeedback group . Group 2 neurofeedback group . Group 3 control group sham neurofeedback training .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Treatment session three group conduct investigator train neurofeedback transcranial direct current stimulation ( tDCs ) . The neurofeedback protocol follow study Reichert et al. , 2016 . Electroencephalography signal SensoriMotor Rhythm ( SMR ) training record channel Cz , digitize 256 Hertz ( Hz ) filter 0.5 Hz high-pass 60 Hz low-pass filter . 50 Hz Notch filter setup eliminate background noise . A 5-channel system amplifier ( Procomp5 , thought technology ) would adopt data record . The ground electrode locate right mastoid , reference leave mastoid . Each participant perform 10 training session different day . Sessions conduct 3-5 time week consist 10 min preparation , 3-min baseline trial participant saw move bar instruct relax without try control bar voluntarily , six 3-min feedback run . In run , participant instruct increase SMR power reduce artifact ( EMG &amp; EOG ) . Three bar present computer screen : height bar middle reflect real-time SMR power ( 12-15 Hz , band power ) , height leave bar reflect theta power ( 4-7 Hz , EEG band power ) height right bar beta power ( EEG band power 21 35 Hz indicate movement high-frequency disturbance ) . The data record baseline trial use calculate individual threshold three bar . The threshold SMR power adapt automatically run basis previous run ( mean ) . When SMR band power exceed predefined threshold , color bar change red green . When participant able move SMR bar threshold keep artifact bar threshold , reward give get point show screen . Furthermore , auditory feedback provide reward mean midi tone feedback . Participants give instruction control feedback bar tell stay mentally focus physically relax . Patients three group receive 30 minute conventional computer remediation train neurofeedback train session . Attention Processing Training III software adopt client train . The software categorize attention accord Sohlberg &amp; Mateer , 1987 divide sustain attention , selective attention , suppression , work memory alternate attention . The programme consist visual auditory exercise . The investigator assign computer remediation exercise client accord participant ' ability . The tDCS + neurofeedback group carry 30 minute tDCS simultaneously computer remediation . The tDCS protocol base work Jo . et al. , 2009 anodal tDCS ( 2 milliampere ( mA ) , 30 min , 30 second ramp time ) apply DLPFC F3 F4 accord 10-20 system . Stimulation ( 2 mA , 30 minute ) deliver direct current stimulator pair 35 cm2 rubber electrode enclose saline-soaked sponge affix head rubber band . The anode place F3 cathode place F4 . The sham neurofeedback group conduct sham neurofeedback training . The investigator would setup accord study do Engelbregt et al. , 2015 . The investigator supervise client neurofeedback training would know condition another investigator would setup machine training . The electrode sham object would place inactive slot record machine . The machine cover blanket setup operate investigator know whether sham experimental condition .</detailed_description>
