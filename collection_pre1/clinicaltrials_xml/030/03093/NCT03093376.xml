	<brief_summary>Clinically significant anxiety affect 20 % preschool-aged child often fail respond currently available treatment . Emerging science suggest increase brain capacity `` effortful control '' ( EC ) may help anxious child regulate emotion behavior improve outcome . Thus , propose study , child train EC task ( include selective attention , response inhibition , etc . ) increase capacity effortful control ( EC ) fear behavior . To determine whether EC train improves brain capacity regulate fear , investigator assess neurophysiological behavioral index effortful control fear reactivity training .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>This experiment randomize child participant clinical subclinical anxiety across two condition test effect pilot effortful control ( EC ) training intervention . Up 40 preschool age girl ( 4-6.99 year ) clinical subclinical anxiety symptom complete either weeklong , camp-like EC training ( n=20 ) waitlist control ( n=20 ) . Before active control condition ( time 1 time 2 , respectively ) , EEG-based measure , error-related negativity ( ERN ) , collect child play simple computer game . The ERN index neural mechanism underlie EC . Other measure collect EC train include blink reflex know fear potentiate startle ( FPS ) ; laboratory-assessed EC fear behavior ; , clinically assess anxiety symptom . The EC intervention `` EC camp '' occur 4 morning ( Saturday Sunday two consecutive weekend ) 9AM 12PM . These time choose maximize child focus energy well convenience family . EC camp comprise short , game-like exercise teach effortful control skill ( e.g. , response inhibition , selective attention , set shift skill ) . Of 40 participant enrol study , 20 randomize receive EC training intervention 20 wait list control . Wait list participant give set write material ( adapt EC camp protocol ) complete home caregiver post-wait list assessment . Primary analysis test group mean difference ERN FPS change ( i.e . time 1 time 2 ) among child assign EC training compare control condition . Secondary analysis test relationship change neurophysiological target change EC Fear behavior change anxiety severity . This study hop examine mechanistic plausibility precise , neuroscientifically-derived treatment childhood anxiety , promote developmental trajectory towards health away chronic illness .</detailed_description>
