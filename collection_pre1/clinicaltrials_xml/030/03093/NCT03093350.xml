	<brief_summary>The study conduct patient breast cancer come back standard treatment . Volunteers research study treat use special immune system cell call tumor-associated antigen ( TAA ) -specific cytotoxic T lymphocyte , new experimental therapy . The protein target study call tumor-associated antigen ( TAAs ) . These cell proteins specific cancer cell . They show , show low quantity , normal human cell . In study , target five common TAAs . They call NY-ESO-1 , MAGEA4 , PRAME , Survivin SSX2 . On different study , patient treat far treatment show safe . We want try treatment patient breast cancer . These TAA-specific cytotoxic T lymphocytes ( TAA-CTLs ) investigational product approve Food Drug Administration . The purpose study determine clinical efficacy TAA-specific CTLs , learn side-effects , see whether therapy might help patient breast cancer .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Investigators take maximum approximately 79 teaspoon blood subject one three occasion two-month period . Under certain condition relate subject health , may need collect blood use process call apheresis . Apheresis process blood pass machine separate component blood need . Investigators use blood grow T cell . Investigators first grow special type cell call dendritic cell activate T cell . Once make , investigator load small piece protein call peptide take TAAs want target . This help train T cell kill cancer cell express TAAs surface . Then TAA-specific CTLs expand . The cell infuse intravenous infusion ( IV ) patient 1-10 minute . The patient may pre-treated acetaminophen ( Tylenol ) diphenhydramine ( Benadryl ) . Acetaminophen ( Tylenol ) diphenhydramine ( Benadryl ) give prevent possible allergic reaction TAA-CTL administration . Initially , two dos TAA-CTLs give four week apart . The patient 's cancer assess pre-infusion , 6 week second infusion . If second infusion reduction size patient 's tumor Computed Tomography ( CT ) , Magnetic Resonance Imaging ( MRI ) , Positron Emission Tomography ( PET ) assess radiologist , patient receive six ( 6 ) additional dos TAA-CTLs wish . At least one month pas additional dose . All treatment give Center Cell Gene Therapy Houston Methodist Hospital . In first second TAA-CTL infusion , 6 week 2nd infusion , patient receive anti-cancer treatment radiation therapy chemotherapy . If patient receive therapy in-between first second infusion TAA-CTLs , take treatment able receive second infusion . MEDICAL TESTS BEFORE TREATMENT : - Physical exam . - Blood test measure blood cell , kidney liver function . - Measurements patient 's tumor routine image study . - Pregnancy test patient female child . MEDICAL TESTS DURING AND AFTER TREATMENT : - Blood test measure blood cell , kidney liver function . - Imaging study 6 week 2nd TAA-CTL infusion . To learn way TAA-CTLs working patient 's body , extra 20-40 mL ( 4-8 teaspoon ) blood take infusion , Weeks 1 , 2 , 4 first cell dose Weeks 1 , 2 , 4 6 second cell dose . Afterwards , blood collect 3 , 6 , 9 12 month 2nd infusion . We use blood see long TAA-CTLs last , look patient 's immune system response cancer . Study Duration : The patient 's active participation study last approximately one ( 1 ) year . If patient receive additional dos TAA-CTLs describe , active participation last one ( 1 ) year last dose . Investigators contact patient year 4 additional year ( total 5 year follow-up ) order evaluate patient 's disease response long-term .</detailed_description>
