	<brief_title>Individual Blood Pressure Optimization Based Cerebral Autoregulation After Implantation Continuous-flow LVAD</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Preoperative data collect baseline information chart review patient interview surgery follow : patient demographic , co-morbidities , medication , preoperative laboratory result , preoperative vital sign . Intraoperative data collect chart review monitor review follow : type implant device , concomitant procedure , length surgery , duration cardiopulmonary bypass aortic cross clamp , blood product administer hemodynamic variable , NIRS signal . Postoperative data collect chart review monitor review follow : medication , blood product administer , postoperative laboratory result , adverse event operative mortality* , length mechanical ventilation , length inotrope administer , hemodynamic variable , length intensive care unit hospital stay , mortality , NIRS signal . Participants receive routine standard institutional perioperative care include invasive radial artery blood pressure monitoring . Participants connect NIRS monitor use sensor probe place right left side forehead per routine clinical application . NIRS signal monitoring initiate induction general anesthesia operation room collect baseline data , continue LVAD implantation procedure . After implantation LVAD , continuous NIRS monitoring carry ICU termination invasive arterial blood pressure monitoring . For participant enrol study , medical treatment provide deviate standard clinical care , include surgery procedure well blood sample collection . The data review routinely seek trend . When need examine specific clinical issue , risk factor give complication , additional clinical data retrieve medical record . All data set analyze used presentation publication anonymized protect patient confidentiality . This study conduct indefinitely .</detailed_description>
