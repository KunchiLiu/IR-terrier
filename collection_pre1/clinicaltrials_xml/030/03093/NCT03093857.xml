	<brief_summary>Patients thoracoabdominal aortic aneurysm need endovascular open operative restructuring ask participate study . After obtain write consent central venous catheter liquor drainage routinely place surgery . The catheter drainage stay patient least 72 hour postoperatively . In total , nine measurement liquor serum perform within week order determine follow parameter : neuropeptide P , neuropeptide Y , neurofilament triplet protein ( NFL ) , S100B , glial fibrillary protein ( GFAp ) , lactate , glucose , oxygen .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Patients complex aortic disease receive operative treatment risk spinal cord damage due insufficient blood circulation spinal cord surgery . The risk depend comorbidities , extent surgery , perioperative management . Despite adequate preoperative imaging , assessment blood circulation spinal cord endovascular open operative restructuring struggle . Beside monitor possibility spinal cord function surgery , insufficient approach regard early detection spinal ischemia use laboratory parameter exist . Several biomarker , e.g . neuropeptide P , neuropeptide Y , neurofilament triplet protein ( NFL ) , S100B , glial fibrillary protein ( GFAp ) , lactate , glucose , oxygen , evaluate singularly bundle marker small patient group . Surgeries thoracoabdominal aortic aneurysm associate high risk despite already exist high standardize procedure ( Cowan et al . 2003 ) . The major complication cardiovascular , renal , pulmonary , gastrointestinal complication , ischemias spinal cord . Especially , ischemia spinal cord fear complication cause irreversibility small time frame . During study sample liquor tissue ( serum , urine ) drawn pre- , peri- postoperatively . Patients receive routinely place liquor drainage due temporal duration surgery . The liquor drainage stay patient also early postoperative phase . Hence , patient bother additional examination . Additionally , biomaterial ( blood ) drawn routinely use biomarker measurement well biobanking .</detailed_description>
