	<brief_title>The Endocrine Secretome After Gastric Bypass Surgery</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Enteroscopy conduct sedation Propofol® . The pre-surgical sampling include biopsy retrieve stomach expect site anastomosis . During RYGB surgery , ~1 cm gut tissue sample remove site anastomosis . The post-surgical enteroscopy ~3 month RYGB surgery include biopsy take gastric pouch , alimentary limb , biliopancreatic limb common channel . One sample location immersion-fixated formalin subsequent histological analysis one sample place tube RNA-preserving medium mRNA expression analysis . Remaining sample snap-frozen store -80°C processing . Enteroendocrine cell identify isolated biopsy obtain several site small intestine use immunohistochemistry laser capture technology . Isolated individual enteroendocrine cell extensively characterise next generation sequencing ( Illumina NGS ) . The participant also go four mixed meal test blood sample perform : 8 % diet-induced weight loss initiate one week before/one week after/3 month RYGB surgery . Blood sample several specific time point . The plasma , serum urine collect study participant RYGB surgery analyse biomarkers/analytes correlate clinical data ( weight , BMI , waist/hip ratio , blood pressure ) molecular phenotype find gut sample . To study change gut bacteria ( microbiota ) composition stool sample collect study analyse microbiota composition mean bacterial DNA sequencing .</detailed_description>
