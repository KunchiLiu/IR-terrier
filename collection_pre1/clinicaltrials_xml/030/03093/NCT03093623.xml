	<brief_title>The Effect Physical Activity Abstain From Smoking Precancerous Lesion</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Cervical cancer seventh common malignancy sixth common cause cancer-related death Taiwan . The development cervical cancer pass cervical intraepithelial neoplasia ( CIN ) , include CIN I , CIN II , CIN III . CIN I classify low-grade squamous intraepithelial lesion ( LSIL ) , 57 % patient CIN I know regress spontaneously , patient CIN II CIN III 5 % 15 % progress invasive cervical cancer , respectively . Both two need active treatment classify high-grade squamous intraepithelial lesion ( HSIL ) . Fortunately , 5-year survival rate 90 % patient CINs receive clinical management soon possible . The immunocompetence play important role prevention cervical cancer . High-risk human papillomavirus ( HR-HPV ) infection demonstrate one vital risk factor CIN cervical cancer . Most HPV infection know regress spontaneously cell-mediated immunity , whereas small fraction persistant HPV infection , increase risk CIN promote progression cervical cancer . Physical activity report increase cell number activity immune cell promote cell-mediated cytotoxic effect protect HPV cancer cell . Also , find physical activity decrease risk breast cancer , hepatocellular carcinoma , colon cancer , prostate cancer . Regular moderate intensity physical activity ssociated decrease death cancer . Moreover , tobacco smoke report abate human immunocompetence raise risk cervical cancer well enhance progression CIN inhibition cell-mediated immunity . Also , extract tobacco demonstrate enhance proliferation viral load HPV , consequently induce carcinogenesis cervical intraepithelial cell . Investigators suggest physical activity could decrease risk CIN promote cell-mediated immunity . Also , physical activity abstain smoking could benefit regression CIN decrease DNA viral load HPV . However , roles physical activity abstain smoke regression CIN viral load fully clarify . Therefore , propose project , investigator 【1】estimate effect physical activity decrease risk cervical intraepithelial neoplasia . 【2】estimate effect physical activity regression cervical intraepithelial neoplasia . 【3】estimate effect abstain smoking regression cervical intraepithelial neoplasia . 【4】estimate additive effect synergistic effect physical activity abstain smoke regression cervical intraepithelial neoplasia . 【5】estimate effect physical activity decrease DNA viral load human papillomavirus . 【6】estimate effect abstain smoke decrease DNA viral load human papillomavirus . 【7】estimate additive effect synergistic effect physical activity abstain smoke decrease DNA viral load human papillomavirus</detailed_description>
