	<brief_title>Vaginal Antimicrobacterial Preparation Before Cesarean Secation Endometritis Prevention</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>BACKGROUND In last decade , caesarean section rate escalate steadily worldwide . In 2013 , 32.7 % birth United States cesarean section 1 . These high rate cesarean delivery substantial concern due potential associate complication endometritis ( 6-11 % ) 2 , wound complication ( 1-2 % ) 2 , hemorrhage , injury pelvic organ ( 0.2-0.5 % ) 2 , thromboembolic disorder ( 100-240 per100,000 ) 3 . One common complication follow CS endometritis . Post c endometritis prolongs patient hospitalization therefore elevate hospital 's cost also intervene mother 's ability take care bond new baby . It also pose risk future fertility increase risk long term complication include Asherman 's syndrome rare case may necessitate hysterectomy . Therefore , decrease post c endometritis substantial goal OBGYN practitioner . In current literature debate surround contribution perioperative vaginal preparation prevention post CS endometritis . In meta-analysis seven randomized trial vaginal preparation CS use povidone-iodine addition abdominal preparation show significantly reduce frequency postoperative endometritis 4 . However , benefit restrict woman rupture membrane benefit woman undergo CS still undetermined . Currently recommendation routine perioperative vaginal preparation CS.The benefit perioperative vaginal preparation motivation study . The design study randomize control trial meant evaluate whether perioperative Vaginal preparation superior Vaginal preparation decrease post CS endometritis Furthermore , past setting povidone-iodine test . Povidone-iodine compromise thyroid function physician replace chlorohexdine solution . Since transition trail revise prevention endometritis vaginal preparation chlorhexidine . Since CS perform 30 % births infection complicate 6-11 % CS reduce rate post CS complication major impact hospital occupancy cost also new mother experience ability face challenge awaits newborn . METHODS Women randomly assign patient two group . The experiment group undergo vaginal preparation . The control undergo perioperative vaginal preparation antiseptic soap follow chlorohexidine-alcohol . Both group check cervical dilation sterile glove surgery . All patient participate trail sign write informed consent . All patient receive preventative antibiotic peri-operatively accord hospital protocol . Exclusion criterion know allergy antiseptic soap , chlorohexidine-alcohol shellfish , patient infection perioperative period . Inclusion criterion : elective emergent CS patient report fever skin infection sign 5 day prior surgery . Once patient admit delivery room , approximately 7 day several hour decision perform CS make inclusion criterion meet , patient assign randomly group use computerize randomization software . Primary outcome - sign endometritis ( e.g . erythema around surgical scar , discharge pain ) . Patients follow daily discharge . A blood count drewn discharge rule sign infection . Patients contact 6 week surgery telephone inquire sign infection , Emergency Room visit ambulatory visit doctor due endometritis . The participant ask positive skin culture wound complication cellulitis , seroma scar separation . STATISTICAL ANALYSIS The sample size calculate trail assume rate endometritis 6 % basis rate know literature 2 . A 4 % low rate endometritis expect vaginal preparation group compare vaginal preparation group . A total 1040 patient enroll study , 520 group order 80 % power detect 50 % difference endometritis rate two group two tail α level 0.05 . The data analysis conduct accord per-protocol principle . Data stratify accord factor maternal age , BMI , medical background specifically diabetes autoimmune condition , gestational age , ethnicity . Relative risk primary outcome calculate 95 % confidence interval .</detailed_description>
