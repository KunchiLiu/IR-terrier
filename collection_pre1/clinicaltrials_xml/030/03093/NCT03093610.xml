	<brief_summary>Previous study show removal chest tube lung surgery significantly improve pain symptom lung function . The criterion chest tube removal still remain vague modern thoracic surgery rely personal experience instead evidence-based criterion . Every hospital traditional standard fluid threshold believe without adapt compare even introduction new minimal-invasive operation technique . According literature traditional fluid threshold vary 100 500 even millilitre 24 hour . Since pleural fluid resorption proportional body weight investigator believe body weight relate approach chest tube management would improve safety would allow early chest tube removal without high rate complication . In way investigator believe improve pain management achieve early discharge patient .</brief_summary>
