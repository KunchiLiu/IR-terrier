	<brief_summary>The goal study study stability Delta-TT cup polyethylene insert Delta-TT cup ceramic insert combine H-MAX femoral stem mean RSA ass whether difference stiffness cup influence incorporation mechanical stability . It hypothesize micromotion short-term ( &lt; 2 year ) patient ceramic insert high stiffness , however , component consider stable short long-term .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Early Stability Delta-TT Cup With Polyethylene Insert Versus Ceramic Insert . A RSA Study .</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Rationale : Roentgen Stereophotogrammetric Analysis ( RSA ) accurate measurement technique use obtain micromotion implant relative insert tantalum marker surround bone . Using RSA , long-term prediction prosthetic loosening make base two year follow-up . Therefore , recommend analyse ( new ) prosthetic component mean RSA . Objective : The goal study study randomise trial stability Delta-TT cup polyethylene insert Delta-TT cup ceramic insert combine H-MAX femoral stem mean RSA ass whether difference stiffness cup influence incorporation mechanical stability . It hypothesize micromotion short-term ( &lt; 2 year ) patient ceramic insert high stiffness , however , component consider stable short long-term . Secondary goal compare stability C2 femoral stem , H-MAX femoral stem well compare relevant migration result similar stem literature . These RSA result contribute knowledge early stability long-term prosthetic loosening cementless stem .</detailed_description>
