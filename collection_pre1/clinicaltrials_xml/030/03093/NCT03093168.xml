	<brief_title>BCMA Chimeric Antigen Receptor Expressing T Cells Multiple Myeloma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Primary Objectives 1 . To determine feasibility ad safety BCMA CAR-T cell treat patient multiple myeloma . 2 . To determine vivo dynamic persistency BCMA CAR-T cell . 3 . To access efficacy BCMA CAR-T cell patient multiple myeloma . Secondary Objectives 1 . To assess bone marrow tumor migration BCMA CAR-T cell . 2 . To investigate tumor kill capability BCMA CAR-T cell vitro 3 . To investigate possibility host immune response mouse derive BCMA scFv , evaluate correlation CAR-T persistence . 4 . To correlate subset differentiation BCMA CAR-T cell observe anti-tumor efficacy .</detailed_description>
