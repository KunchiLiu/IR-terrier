	<detailed_description>Background &amp; Significance : Essential oil formally document use since time Egyptians . The Ebers Papyrus document note Egyptians use frankincense different physical ailment . In Greece Hippocrates use essential oil fumigate city Athens fight plague .

Robert Tisserand early 1990s review French chemist work add research help make essential oil know public present day . In recent year lavender study human subject test know reputation sedative , anxiolytic , analgesic property . In one clinical trial oral administration lavender compare Ativan 0.5mg generalize anxiety disorder . The study support oral lavender oil call Silexan effective 0.5mg Ativan adult generalize anxiety disorder . A second clinical trial analyze sleep quality find ischemic heart patient intensive care unit receive well sleep 100 % lavender oil undiluted placed cotton ball within 20cm patient hour 9pm-6am . Two study use lavender oil inhalation recovery room oxygen mask surgery pain control . The first study patient breast biopsy , second patient laparoscopic adjustable gastric banding . The study breast biopsy patient show high satisfaction rate pain . The patient undergoing laparoscopic banding also show high rate satisfaction pain well decrease opioid use recovery room . Furthermore one study use 100 % lavender oil undiluted skin pediatric patient undergo tonsillectomy topical application ask patient inhale . The study show decrease use Tylenol usage postoperatively . Design &amp; Procedures : Design Randomized study control group test group . Using 1:1 treatment allocation ratio , total 40 patient ( 20 per arm ) randomly assign control treatment arm . The Statistical Investigator generate randomization scheme monitor randomization process course trial . The study use randomization random permute block . The test group receive 50 % lavender oil dilute fractionate coconut oil control group current standard care essential oil intervention . Fractionated coconut oil use colorless , odorless , stain clothing , long shelf life . It also serve carrier oil essential oil absorb skin instead evaporate skin due essential oil volatile nature . Study Procedure The lavender essential oil use company doTERRA . This essential oil company choose company medical science govern board make physician , surgeon , chemist pharmacist . The oil also third party test Dr. Robert Pappas trust chemist essential oil community purity quality . Gas chromatography mass spectrometry use ensure purity unwanted substance essential oil . doTERRA 's essential oil also already used hospital set Vanderbilt University hospital Tennessee . doTERRA 's essential oil diffuse Vanderbilt ER nursing station . After 3 month diffuse staff felt less work related stress , less time feeling overwhelm , energy work . Study Interventions : After inform consent obtain , exactly 4 drop 50 % lavender solution place wrist radial artery . The patient rub wrist hand together inhale exhale slowly one minute . This occur thirty minute take operating room . The dilution 50 % choose review Robert Tisserand 's book essential oil safety , consult local certified aromatherapist , Cynthia Loving , consult Dr. David Hill , executive vice president chief medical officer doTERRA essential oil . This percent dilution recommend skin likely cause irritation skin . Repeated insult patch skin test doTERRA support dilution rate safe skin . Furthermore previous study use 100 % lavender oil child age 5-12 undergoing tonsillectomy adverse reaction . The first dose give thirty minute prior operate room take 20 minute lavender absorbed thought skin reach peak plasma level . During surgery patient receive 4 drop 50 % solution lavender oil temple region temporal artery every 2 hour completion surgery . This applied anesthesia team . If temporal region accessible shoulder foot alternate location application . When patient arrive recovery room receive lavender oil oxygen mask . A 50 % solution use place 4 drop lavender solution mask wipe around mask cotton ball . This delivery method use use study New York University Medical Center study postoperative pain adverse event occur . When patient post-operative floor receive 50 % lavender oil wrist every 4 hour manner preoperatively hour 6am 9pm . Nightly ( 9pm-6am ) , 8 drop 50 % lavender oil place cotton ball situate within 20cm patient . This method concentration choose review study ischemic heart patient intensive care unit . The patient receive lavender bedside cotton ball statistically significant good sleep quality . The control group current standard care lavender intervention . Blood pressure , pulse , respiratory rate , oxygen saturation monitor preoperative area lavender give 30 minute give . The level pain also ask prior application second set vitals . The control group get two set vital measurement pain scale measurement without intervention . The vitals record patient anesthesia every 30 minute . There notation chart lavender give correlate time application time vitals record . A review electronic medical record do record amount narcotic need interop group . In recovery room patient give lavender oxygen mask vital sign pain score measurement take 15 , 30 , 60 minute lavender application . In control group arrival recovery room data point measure time interval intervention . The amount narcotic need recovery room take electronic medical record group . Postoperatively floor vital sign note record every 4 hour . At 4 hour interval vital sign take lavender applied experimental group intervention control group . One set vitals sign record 45min application lavender time lavender apply . There review narcotic use electronic medical record group . There notation lavender give correlate lavender application narcotic use . The anxiety questionnaire give preop application lavender daily every post-op day stay . The questionnaire call hospital anxiety depression scale . The sleep questionnaire give preop application lavender daily every post-op day stay . The sleep questionnaire call Richard Campbell Sleep Questionnaire . Daily start postop day 1 patient also record level satisfaction pain control scale 1-10 1 satisfy 10 satisfied . Patients typically stay hospital 1-3 day post-op . A survey fill daily . Data Analysis &amp; Statistical Considerations : Study Design/Endpoints : The primary outcome difference pain score 2 group and/or decrease narcotic use and/or increase patient satisfaction pain control . Secondary outcome well sleep decreased anxiety . The secondary outcome difference score two survey , Richards Campbell sleep questionnaire Hospital Anxiety Depression Scale . Analytic Plan Method : Differences change score pain two group well demographic clinical continuous variable examine use t-test Wilcoxon test , depend whether variable normally non-normally distribute respectively . The difference categorical variable examine use chi-squared Fisher 's exact test . Analysis conduct intention treat ( ITT ) . Missing data impute multiple imputation method . Differences outcomes control potential covariates ( age , etc ) examine use linear regression . Significance test assess alpha = 0.05 . Analysis conduct use SAS 9.4 ( SAS Institute , Inc. , Cary , NC . ) .</detailed_description>
