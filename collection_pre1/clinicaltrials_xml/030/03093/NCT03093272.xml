	<brief_summary>This research study study combination drug possible treatment castration-resistant prostate cancer . The intervention involve study : - Docetaxel ( type chemotherapy ) - Apalutamide ( study medication , also know ARN-509 ) - Prednisone ( corticosteroid give prevent reaction docetaxel ) . - Leuprolide acetate ( also know Lupron , GnRH agonist similar drug standard care , cause chemical castration greatly lower level testosterone body )</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Study Docetaxel + ARN-509 Castration-Resistant Prostate Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This research study Phase II clinical trial . Phase II clinical trial test safety effectiveness investigational intervention learn whether intervention work treat specific disease . `` Investigational '' mean intervention study . Apalutamide consider investigational product , believe reduce growth prostate cancer cell . The FDA ( U.S. Food Drug Administration ) approve apalutamide treatment disease , studied prostate cancer . Docetaxel approve therapy type cancer . The FDA approve combination two drug use . In research study , investigator evaluate combination two drug , docetaxel apalutamide . The investigator keep track participant ' prostate-specific antigen ( PSA ) , scan , overall health determine well drug combination work treat type cancer .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Histologically confirm adenocarcinoma prostate Castrationresistant prostate cancer require follow criterion : A castrate level testosterone ( &lt; 50ng/dL ) Prostate cancer progression since last treatment document PSA rise bone progression accord PCWG2 soft tissue radiographic progression accord RECIST criterion Version 1.1 If antiandrogen , need show PSA decline least 6 week withdrawal period last dose bicalutamide nilutamide 4 week last flutamide dose Will require 2 week washout period last dose ketoconazole , abiraterone acetate radiation Treatment abiraterone acetate CRPC past require . Does need last treatment prior enrollment . There limit number prior therapy Metastatic disease bone scan nodal visceral lesion CT MRI Age ≥ 18 year Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group ( ECOG ) performance status 0 1 ( See Appendix A ) Adequate organ function evaluate follow laboratory criterion : Hemoglobin ≥ 9g/dL ; transfusion erythropoietin supplementation permit within last 3 month Absolute neutrophil count ( ANC ) ≥ 1500/µL Platelet count ≥ 100 x 10^9/L Total bilirubin ≤ upper limit normal ( ULN , Note : In subject Gilbert 's syndrome , total bilirubin ≥ 1.5 × ULN , measure direct indirect bilirubin direct bilirubin ≤ ULN , subject may eligible ) AST ALT &lt; 2.5 x ULN &lt; 5x ULN liver metastasis Serum creatinine &lt; 2.0 × ULN creatinine clearance &gt; 30cc/min Serum albumin ≥ 3.0 g/dL Serum potassium ≥ 3.5 mmol/L ( &lt; 3.5 , replete reassess eligibility long stable potassium supplementation &gt; 48 hr ) Ability swallow study drug whole tablet The effect apalutamide docetaxel develop human fetus unknown . For reason chemotherapeutic agent know teratogenic , men must agree use adequate contraception . Specifically , must agree use condom ( even men vasectomy ) another effective method birth control sex woman childbearing potential agree use condom sex woman pregnant study drug 3 month follow last dose study drug . They must also agree donate sperm study 3 month receive last dose study drug . Ability understand willingness sign write informed consent document . Pathology consistent majority specimen small cell carcinoma prostate ( prostate cancer neuroendocrine feature acceptable ) . Prior treatment enzalutamide CPRC ; nonCRPC use allow ( e.g. , neoadjuvant , combine radiation localize disease n't progress setting ) Prior treatment docetaxel chemotherapy except &gt; 12 month since give either neoadjuvant adjuvant set hormone sensitive disease ( e.g. , CHAARTED population ) Presence untreated brain metastasis Seizure know condition may predispose seizure ( include limit prior stroke , transient ischemic attack within 1 year prior randomization , brain arteriovenous malformation ; intracranial mass schwannomas meningiomas cause edema mass effect ) . Loss consciousness within 12 month may permit upon discussion study PI . Medications know low seizure threshold must discontinue substitute least 4 week prior study entry . Current , recent ( within 4 week first dose study ) , plan participation experimental drug study Persistent grade &gt; 1 ( NCI CTCAE v4.0 ) AEs due investigational drug administer 14 day study enrollment . Radiation within 2 week prior enter study Peripheral neuropathy ≥ Grade 2 . Current evidence following : Uncontrolled hypertension Gastrointestinal disorder affect absorption Active infection ( e.g. , human immunodeficiency virus [ HIV ] viral hepatitis ) medical condition would make prednisone/prednisolone ( corticosteroid ) use contraindicate Uncontrolled intercurrent illness include , limited , severe unstable angina , myocardial infarction , symptomatic congestive heart failure ( defined New York Heart Association Grade II great ) , arterial venous thromboembolic event ( e.g. , pulmonary embolism ) , clinically significant ventricular arrhythmia , significant vascular disease ( e.g . aortic aneurysm , aortic dissection ) , symptomatic peripheral vascular disease within 6 month prior randomization . Psychiatric illness/social situation would limit compliance study requirement . Any condition opinion investigator , would preclude participation study History allergic reaction severe hypersensitivity reaction drug formulate polysorbate 80 antisense oligonucleotides . History allergic reaction attribute compound similar chemical biologic composition apalutamide docetaxel Participants receive medication substance strong inhibitor inducer CYP3A4 ineligible . Because list agent constantly change , important regularly consult frequentlyupdated list http : //medicine.iupui.edu/clinpharm/ddis/table.aspx ; medical reference text Physicians ' Desk Reference may also provide information . As part enrollment/informed consent procedure , patient counsel risk interaction agent , new medication need prescribe patient consider new overthecounter medicine herbal product .
