	<brief_title>Preoxygenation With Nasal Cannula Noninvasive Positive Pressure Ventilation</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Noninvasive positive pressure ventilation addition nasal cannula useful technique pre-oxygenate provide apneic oxygenation hypoxic patient undergoing emergency airway management . This study aim evaluate preoxygenation quantify end-tidal oxygen ( etO2 ) concentration result nasal cannula placement underneath noninvasive positive pressure ventilation ( NIPPV ) mask . This prospective randomize cross study healthy volunteer undergo continuous positive airway pressure ventilation via noninvasive ventilation ( NIV ) mask without addition nasal cannula . End-tidal oxygen concentration measure oxygen sensor follow three minute NIPPV without addition nasal cannula , subject serve control .</detailed_description>
	<criteria>Any healthy volunteer age 1865 year . Previous inability tolerate noninvasive positive pressure ventilation addition nasal cannula . Known underlying cardiac pulmonary disease . Active respiratory infection .</criteria>
