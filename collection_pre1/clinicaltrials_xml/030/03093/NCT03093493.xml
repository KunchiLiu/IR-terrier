	<brief_summary>We plan collect blood saliva DNA extraction use genetic test child adult EDS relative . Medical record institution clinical note visit Dr. Holick 's clinic review obtain following information : previous diagnosis institution , age , clinical sign symptom EDS , Joints Hypermobility Syndrome ( JHS ) , , metabolic genetic disorder laboratory result , radiology report image , genetic testing support diagnosis . Subjects ' peripheral vein blood saliva take . No clinical intervention/randomizations perform . No patient ' identifier report . In pilot study genomic DNA extract used genotyping sequence 30 EDS patient 30 relative without EDS compare genetic variation . After validation Sanger sequence variation , plan prepare genetic panel EDS . After validation testing , plan evaluate saliva DNA similar manner compare result obtain DNA blood sample . The purpose comparable , able use saliva place blood easy method access person 's DNA . This especially helpful evaluate infant patient prefer blood sample drawn .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Ehlers-Danlos Syndrome ( EDS ) genetic disease affect collagen synthesis structure result multisystem connective tissue involvement twelve different subtypes . The clinical manifestation EDS include skin hyperextensibility , skin fragility , joint hypermobility , muscle hypotonia , easy bruising , mast cell hypersensitivity . We recently report case series EDS patient different sign symptom . Most evaluated along parent evidence acquire inherited bone disease . What remarkable 93 % case least one parent clinically document evidence EDS genetic disorder compromise structural integrity collagen/elastin matrix . Most parent unaware genetic disorder diagnosis make first time clinic . Our previous study review patient 's medical record approve Boston University Medical Center 's IRB . We access EDS patient referral Dr Holick 's clinic . We plan collect blood saliva sample EDS patient relatives genetic study . Genetic evaluation limit number patient show causative variation . For example , one case patient evaluate outside hospital causative variant COL5A1 , COL5A2 , FKBP14 , TNXB gene , negative , find later causative variant serpin peptidase inhibitor , clade F , member 1 ( SERPINF1 ) gene . A causative variation SERPINF1 gene associate osteogenesis imperfecta ( OI ) /EDS overlap syndrome mutation gene cause type VI OI . The highly variable clinical presentation patient hypermobility clinical sign EDS prompt effort classify patient EDS homogeneous group aid diagnosis management . This result establishment 14 type ( include 6 major type 8 minor type ) . This classification acknowledge presence `` others '' include `` unspecified '' form make clear clinical genetic heterogeneity EDS could fully capture classification . Indeed , numerous report patient hereditary disorder connective tissue , overlap clinical manifestation EDS , meet diagnostic criterion . For decade , genetic basis heritable disorder connective tissue remain largely unknown . The rise molecular genetics advance next-generation sequence unlocked door continue lead major advance understand causative gene many genetic disorder . Evaluation subject condition often include molecular test important counseling , therapeutic sometimes legal implication . An accurate molecular diagnosis provide basis counsel regard prognosis reproductive option . Accurate genetic diagnosis show provide psychological benefit patient family . In order facilitate sequence multiple gene cause common form heritable condition , design genetic study obtain data genetic variation EDS next generation sequence . The next generation sequence panel may value guide future clinical pathway genetic diagnosis EDS . We plan recruit EDS patient relatives genetic test . We also plan submit NIH grant purpose provide require preliminary data pilot grant genetic variation EDS . The primary objective compare genetic variation EDS patient relative . We expect find genetic variation may explain clinical sign symptom EDS patient . Secondary objective provide novel test panel single diagnostic platform EDS . After perform next generation sequencing , plan design genetic panel EDS . A third objective determine saliva good reliable source DNA genetic test DNA obtain blood .</detailed_description>
