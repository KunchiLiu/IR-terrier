	<brief_summary>Invariant Natural killer T ( iNKT ) cell unique subset lymphocytes express homogeneous TCR recognize KRN7000 up-regulated many kind cancer cell . PD-1+CD8+T cell patient advance tumor likely tumor-specified . Our hypothesis immunotherapy strategy infusion iNKT cell PD-1+CD8+T cell may decrease tumor burden improve overall survival . The purpose study assess safety efficacy treatment patient advance solid tumor infuse iNKT cell PD-1+CD8+T cell .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Clinical Safty Efficacy Study Infusion iNKT Cells CD8+T Cells Patients With Advanced Solid Tumor</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Treatment patient advance solid tumor great unsolved challenge physician . Efficacy conventional treatment , surgery , radiotherapy chemotherapy limit . AS novel therapy , immunotherapy show great prospect . Human iNKT cell directly lysis tumor cell perforin-dependent mechanism , intracellular granzyme B expression may also potentiate cell kill . Tumor cell express CD1d may especially susceptible direct NKT cell lysis . iNKT cell play important role immune regulation secrete various cytokine . PD-1+CD8+T cell likely tumor-specific patient advance tumor . Expansion method iNKT cell PD-1+CD8+T cell vitro develop publish patent . Infusions iNKT cell CD8+T cell prove safe mouse . In clinical trial , safety efficacy immunotherapy infusion iNKT cell CD8+T cell assess .</detailed_description>
