	<brief_summary>Recently , demonstrate multimodal high-intensity interval training ( MM-HIIT ) ( utilize resistance-based functional movement ) produce similar aerobic adaptation compare high-intensity interval training ( HIIT ) use row great muscle performance female . In addition , HIIT show enjoyable continuous training , may lead enhanced self-efficacy increase physical activity . To investigator ' knowledge , however , cardiometabolic effect ( blood pressure , abdominal/visceral fat , blood sugar , blood lipids/fats ) MM-HIIT report . The investigator aim compare MM-HIIT HIIT use traditional aerobic fitness exercise ( row ) degree cardiometabolic , physical performance ( strength , endurance , power ) , psychosocial ( self-efficacy enjoyment ) adaptation .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The PI verify age driver license form identification ensure study participant least 18 year age participate . After obtain consent , PI administer pre-exercise screen tool , Physical Activity Readiness Questionnaire Everyone , participant complete order aid determine study eligibility . If participant deem eligible , 3 questionnaire email participant completion : Physical Activity Enjoyment Scale , Exercise Self-efficacy Scale , International Physical Activity Questionnaire ( IPAQ ) short form . Given participant instructed change physical activity habit outside study , IPAQ use control pre- post-intervention weekly throughout duration intervention . All form must complete submitted PI prior data collection . Data collection consist ( 1 ) blood collection visit , ( 2 ) exercise test abdominal/visceral fat measurement session , ( 3 ) three exercise/movement familiarization session ( conduct pre-intervention ) , ( 4 ) three strength , muscular endurance , muscular power test session intervention , 12 week train three time per week describe . Excluding consent obtain meeting , participant attend 8 session prior begin intervention detail . During intervention , participant wear heart rate monitor order monitor training intensity . The PI lead data collection procedure assistance School Health Science student Dr. Myung Choi except blood collection analysis supervise Dr. Kristen Landis-Piwowar . All measure assess pre- post-intervention . Blind copy email send remind participant upcoming data collection session schedule data collection appointment . Day 1 : Prevention Research Center ( blood collection visit ) Following 12-hr fast , assessment include : - weight , height , waist circumference - rest heart rate - blood pressure - venipuncture ( blood sugar fat ) - blood analysis Day 2 : Prevention Research Center ( exercise test visceral fat visit ) Assessments include : - dual-x-ray absorptiometry ( DXA ) measure visceral adipose tissue - bicycle VO2max test standard warm-up clinical monitoring ass aerobic endurance - Physical Activity Enjoyment Scale Exercise Self-efficacy Scale ( post-intervention ) Days 3-5 : Oakland University ( OU ) Recreation Center ( familiarization visit ) Familiarization session include : - teaching movement use subsequent test train - assessment musculoskeletal limitation - intervention leader assistant attend session part training Days 6-8 : OU Recreation Center ( performance test visit ) Assessments include : - Day 6 : one repetition maximum ( 1 RM ) test back squat ( muscular strength ) ; 70 % 1RM back squat max effort repetition unbroken ( muscular endurance ) - Day 7 : 1 RM overhead press ( muscular strength ) - Day 8 : 1 RM deadlift ( muscular strength ) max broad jump ( muscular power ) - standardize warm-up prior cool-down follow session - least 48 hour rest session Pre- post-intervention health measurement : Prevention Research Center Anthropometrics vital sign measure height ( use stadiometer ) , weight ( use eye-level beam scale ) , heart rate blood pressure ( sit sphygmomanometer ) obtain . Pre- post-intervention endurance measurement : Prevention Research Center Aerobic fitness directly assess VO2max bicycle test . Each participant allow warm-up bicycle 5 minute low intensity . The VO2max bicycle test include 3 minute stage increase intensity stage 30 - 60 watt . The required cadence maintain 60 revolution per minute ( RPM ) stage . The test terminate volitional fatigue define participant longer able maintain 60 RPMs 20 second encouragement tester . For people , test take approximately 10 minute . Pre- post-intervention strength measurement : OU Recreation Center Prior strength testing , three familiarization session conduct whereby participant teach give chance practice movement use test training . During session , participant assess musculoskeletal limitation lack hip ankle mobility may require movement/exercise modification ensure safe technique . Following familiarization session , participant complete three day test , least 48 hour test day . These test session occur OU Recreation Center . Each test session precede standardized warmup instruction regard upcoming session . On separate day , muscle strength assess use 1-repetition maximum ( 1RM ) test back squat , press , deadlift use standardized protocol . The back squat perform parallel ( hip crease apex patella ) , press initiate bar clavicle , deadlift perform conventional stance . All testing day repeat follow training . Pre- post-intervention muscle endurance muscle power : OU Recreation Center Muscle endurance assess repetitive back squat voluntary exhaustion . The load set 70 % pre-training 1RM back squat pre- post-training test . This test conduct immediately 1 RM test back squat . Movement standard 1RM test , total number successful repetition achieve without rest record . Muscle power assess use static broad jump . The best horizontal distance achieve 3 trial record . This test conduct immediately 1 RM test deadlift . Pre- post-intervention biochemistry measurement : Prevention Research Center Following 12-hour fast , participant complete venipuncture collection procedure . Two invasive needle stick perform investigation ( one needle stick pre-intervention another needle stick post-intervention ) . Four milliliter ( mL ) blood collect pre- post-intervention measurement : total cholesterol , high-density lipoprotein cholesterol , triglyceride , alanine aminotransferase , aspartate aminotransferase , glucose , low-density lipoprotein cholesterol . This total amount blood ( 8mL ) collect trial equate 1.6 teaspoon blood ( 5mL = 1 teaspoon ) . The risk blood draw may include : infection , delay healing , bruise and/or inflammation site vein puncture , physical discomfort , mental discomfort , faint feel faint injury nerve vessel . These risk minimize use trained professional ( Dr. Kristen Landis-Piwowar ) experience perform blood draw , sterile technique single use , disposable , material supervise blood draw analysis . Study participant may refuse participate time withdraw study without penalty . Pre- post-intervention visceral fat measurement use dual x-ray absorptiometry ( DXA ) scan : Prevention Research Center For measurement visceral fat , participant ask lie flat special table DXA scan . A trained technician ( Elise Brown , Ryan Tyler , Myung Choi , Samantha Orr ) position participant 's body scan perform scan , take &lt; 5 minute . Pre- post-intervention psychosocial questionnaires The purpose include psychosocial assessment propose study ass change physical activity enjoyment exercise self-efficacy . High-intensity interval train show enjoyable continuous training , may lead enhance self-efficacy . These questionnaire email participant completion : Physical Activity Enjoyment Scale Exercise Self-efficacy Scale . The intervention lead student ( one leader least 2 assistant ) train PI , exercise protocol follow : MM-HIIT Group : This group train use multimodal exercise 5 set 60 second work , follow 3 minute rest ( total 20 minute session ) . Each session exercise within set , every session different others movement utilized . There three movement use set . The first movement strength movement ( overhead press , squat , deadlift ) 4-6 repetition . The second movement follow first immediately faster body weight light implement power movement lunge , body weight squat , push ups 6-8 repetition . The third movement follow second immediately fast , sprint-like movement box jump , ball slam , jump rope remainder 60 second . The intent set complete much effort possible across full 60 second . The intervention leader record weight use exercise instruct participant increase intensity ( 110 % previous intensity use ) subsequent session maximum prescribed repetition . R-HIIT Group : This group train use row ergometer 5 set 60 second work , follow 3 minute rest ( total 20 minute session ) . Each training session across 12 week . The intent set complete much effort possible across full 60 second . Control Group : This group instruct continue activity involve prior study begin new exercise program course study . To incentive participation group , control group offer MM-HIIT intervention follow semester cost .</detailed_description>
