	<brief_summary>This research study study safety tolerability investigational combination drug , radium-223 plus pembrolizumab possible treatment castration-resistant prostate cancer . The intervention involve study : - Radium-223 - Pembrolizumab</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Study Evaluating Addition Pembrolizumab Radium-223 mCRPC</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This research study Phase II clinical trial . Phase II clinical trial test safety effectiveness investigational intervention learn whether intervention work treat specific disease . `` Investigational '' mean intervention study . The FDA ( U.S. Food Drug Administration ) approve radium-223 treatment option participant 's disease . The FDA approve pembrolizumab participant 's specific disease , approve us , type skin cancer call melanoma . In research study , investigator evaluate immune response , safety tolerability combination pembrolizumab ( type immunotherapy drug ) plus radium-223 . Pembrolizumab work block PD-1 pathway , play important role lessen activity one 's immune system fight cancer . Pembrolizumab therefore refer PD-1 inhibitor , act stimulate patient 's T cell , important immune cell , attack tumor treat cancer . Radium-223 target cancer exist bone directly . Radium-223 bind mineral bone deliver radiation directly cancer spread bone limit damage surround body tissue . Part study look whether investigator may effectively control participant 's prostate cancer combine drug . Radium-223 may kill cancer cell release protein specific tumor . The participant 's immune system use proteins teach T cell cancer look like , identify attack . Pembrolizumab increase number activity immune cell , build T cell `` army '' specialize recognize attack cancer . The way two drug work cancer immune system may result good control tumor radium-223 alone need investigated .</detailed_description>

Has know history active TB ( Bacillus Tuberculosis ) Has prior anticancer monoclonal antibody ( mAb ) within 4 week prior study Day 1 recover ( i.e. , ≤ Grade 1 baseline ) adverse event due agent administer 4 week earlier . Has prior chemotherapy , target small molecule therapy , radiation therapy within 2 week prior study Day 1 . There must least 2 week washout period last dose prior systemic radiation therapy prostate cancer prior Day 1 study treatment . Screening may commence washout window . Any patient recover ( i.e. , ≤ Grade 1 baseline ) adverse event due previously administer systemic agent radiation therapy . Exceptions : Subjects ≤ Grade 2 neuropathy , hot flash , hypertension may qualify study eligibility criterion meet . Note : If subject receive major surgery , must recover adequately toxicity and/or complication intervention prior start therapy . Receiving investigational agent History allergic reaction compound similar biologic chemical composition pembrolizumab Radium223 Has know additional malignancy progress require active treatment . Exceptions include basal cell carcinoma skin squamous cell carcinoma skin undergone potentially curative therapy . Has know active central nervous system ( CNS ) metastases and/or carcinomatous meningitis . Subjects previously treat brain metastasis may participate provide stable ( without evidence progression image least four week prior first dose trial treatment neurologic symptom return baseline ) , evidence new enlarge brain metastasis , use steroid least 7 day prior trial treatment . This exception include carcinomatous meningitis , exclude regardless clinical stability . Has active autoimmune disease require systemic treatment past 2 year ( i.e . use disease modify agent , corticosteroid immunosuppressive drug ) .
