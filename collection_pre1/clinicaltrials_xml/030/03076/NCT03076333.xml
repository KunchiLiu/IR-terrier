	<brief_summary>Purpose : To assess utility PET/MR assess response neoadjuvant radiation therapy treatment high grade sarcoma . Participants : Adult patient potentially curable high grade sarcoma treat UNC neoadjuvant radiation therapy follow potentially curative surgical resection . Procedures ( method ) : Patients treat potentially curable high grade sarcoma neoadjuvant radiation therapy follow surgical resection undergo pre-treatment , mid-treatment , post-treatment PET/MR response treatment assess evaluate change size FDG avidity . Patients undergo curative intent resection follow . Their pathology review treatment affect assess percent necrosis , size , resection margin . Patients follow assessed recurrence .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>PET/MR Assessing Response Neoadjuvant Radiation Therapy Tx High Grade Sarcomas</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Investigators propose PET/MR study midpoint radiation treatment accurately predict patient respond neoadjuvant radiation therapy . The study enroll patient high-grade sarcoma identify preoperative biopsy treat neoadjuvant radiation study . The standard care patient receive MRI scan pre-treatment post-treatment time point . Patients study receive standard pre- post-treatment imaging form PET/MR , PET conduct simultaneously MRI , within context study also receive one additional PET/MR end second week therapy . These patient receive curative intent surgery follow usual fashion assess local and/or distant recurrent disease . The pathology assess completeness resection percent necrosis . On basis pathology , patient classify responsive non-responsive therapy . Quantitative measure PET MRI compute : change PET tumor-mean standardize uptake value ( SUV ) tumor size assess MRI , pre- post-treatment , pre- mid-treatment . The image-based quantitative measure correlate pathology outcome evaluate predictability image measure treatment response . Patients follow intent correlate image measure clinical outcome .</detailed_description>
