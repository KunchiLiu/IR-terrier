	<brief_summary>The purpose study determine call pulsatility curve , describe relationship intracranial pressure ( ICP ) ICP pulsatility , use predict outcome treatment , form shunt surgery , idiopathic normal pressure hydrocephalus ( INPH ) guide adjustment shunt opening pressure surgery . The main hypothesis study : 1 . The pulsatility curve may best auxiliary test predict shunt surgery outcome INPH patient . With `` fix '' shunt opening pressure , preoperatively assessed potential pulse amplitude reduction ( determine analysis pulsatility curve ) predict postoperative improvement gait velocity cognitive function . 2 . A postoperative pulsatility curve use optimize ICP pulsatility guide opening pressure adjustment . Shunt adjustment base pulsatility curve three month postoperatively increase improvement , complication , compare shunt `` fix '' open pressure . Based hypothesis , three specific aim study define : 1 . To determine improvement three month surgery associate postoperative reduction pulse amplitude . 2 . To determine pulsatility curve obtain preoperatively predict improvement gait velocity cognitive function INPH patient three month surgery . 3 . To compare outcome six month surgery complication rate INPH patient `` fix '' open pressure versus shunt adjust base pulsatility curve , three month shunt insertion .</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Possible probable INPH accord INPH guideline . Symptom duration ≥ 3 month Age ≥50 year Able walk 10 meter without assistant device . Decision recommend shunt surgery base either : Improvement cerebrospinal fluid ( CSF ) tap ( i.e . positive tap test ) , ; Increased CSF outflow resistance , ; A combination `` typical '' signs/symptoms + `` typical '' MRI finding ; A combination ac . NPH due hemorrhage , meningitis stroke ( secondary NPH ) . Symptom duration ≥ 5 year . Patients consider surgical risk . Baseline gait velocity &gt; 1 m/sec ( 60 m/min ) . Mini Mental State Exam score ≤ 20 point . Musculoskeletal condition preclude gait assessment . Severe hear visual impairment Medication form warfarin novel oral anticoagulant ( NOAC ) No reduction pressure CSF infusion investigation , i.e . complete assessment pulsatility curve</criteria>
