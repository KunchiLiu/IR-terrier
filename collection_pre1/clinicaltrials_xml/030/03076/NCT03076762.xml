	<brief_title>Comparative Study Suburothelial Trigonal Botulinum Toxin A Injection Treatment Interstitial Cystitis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Introduction Interstitial cystitis/painful bladder syndrome ( IC/PBS ) debilitate chronic disease unknown etiology characterize urgency frequency suprapubic pain full bladder . Current treatment usually unsuccessful completely eradicate bladder pain increase bladder capacity . Intravesical resiniferatoxin consider effective show large scale multiple center trial . Several oral medication pentosanpolysulphate ( PPS ) , amitryptynine , cyclosporin try therapeutic efficacy proven ineffective . Intravesical treatment heparin , hyaluronic acid , chondroitin sulphate , bacillus Calmette-Guerin , dimethylsulphoxide , resiniferatoxin , botulinum toxin A show early effectiveness patient . However , placebo effect weigh randomize , double-blind trial undertaken demonstrate actual therapeutic effect therapeutic modality . Although botulinum toxin type A ( BoNT-A ) widely report efficacy treatment neurogenic idiopathic detrusor overactivity ( DO ) satisfactory result , study use BoNT-A treatment IC/PBS . In recent basic research , BoNT-A show inhibit release acetylcholine norepinephrine , also nerve growth factor , adenosine triphosphate , substance P calcitonin gene-related peptide nerve fiber urothelium . In clinical experiment , BoNT-A show reduce DO , impair bladder sensation , decrease visceral pain chronic inflammatory disease . These result suggest BoNT-A treatment modulate sensory transmission well reduce detrusor contractility . Although BoNT-A injection seem promise treat symptom IC/PBS , long term result provide successful outcome . The limited successful result possibly due inadequate distribution BoNT-A deliver bladder wall , inadequate dose toxin , lack promote factor enhance therapeutic effect BoNT-A . Repeated intravesical BoNT-A injection recently perform refractory IC/PBS therapeutic effect seem promising . About 70 % patient non-ulcer type IC/PBS may benefit repeated BoNT-A injection every 6 month . Immunohistochemistry study also confirm reduction inflammatory biomarkers pro-apoptotic protein Bax Bad expression repeat BoNT-A injection . Concerning injection sit BoNT-A IC/BPS bladder , consensus . Suburothelial injection Trigonal injection use treatment IC/BPS short-term long-term result equivalent . It unmet clarify injection method superior clinical efficacy patient safety . This study design randomize , double-blind trial test therapeutic effect adverse event intravesical BoNTA injection suburothelium trigone . The result study might provide clinical evidence well therapeutic regimen BoNT-A treatment IC/PBS . Materials Methods A total 60 patient IC/PBS fail previous treatment least 6 month enrol study . A diagnosis IC/PBS establish base characteristic symptom cystoscopic finding glomerulations , petechia , mucosal fissure hydrodistention . All patient treat least two type treatment modality include non-steroid anti-inflammatory drug , oral PPS , intravesical instillation heparin , hyaluronic acid , tricyclic antidepressant least 6 month symptom remain unchanged relapse . They investigate thoroughly enrollment exclude meeting inclusion criterion NIDDK . However , study patient Hunner 's ulcer include previous study show ulcer type IC/BPS respond intravesical BoNT-A injection . Patients request keep 3-day voiding diary prior treatment record functional bladder capacity ( FBC ) number urinary frequency nocturnal . The IC symptom assess O'Leary-Sant symptom problem index . The pain score report patient self-assessment use 10-point visual analog scale ( VAS ) system . Videourodynamic study potassium chloride ( KCl ) sensitivity test routinely perform patient inform possible complication associate BoNT-A injection generalize muscle weakness , difficult urination , transient urinary retention , urinary tract infection . Videourodynamic study perform standard procedure use 6 Fr dual channel catheter 8 Fr rectal balloon catheter . Cystometric study perform normal saline fill rate 20 ml/min . All description terminology report accordance recommendation International Continence Society . After videourodynamic study , 40ml KCl solution 0.4M infused slowly bladder test regard positive painful ( ≧2 VAS score ) urgency sensation ( urgency severity score increase ≧1 ) elicit compare normal saline infusion urodynamic study . This study perform Hualien Tzu chi General.The study approve Institutional Review Board ( IRB ) ethic committee university register ClinicalTrial.gov . Each patient inform study rationale procedure , write , informed consent obtain treatment . Eligible patient admit treatment . They randomly assign receive intravesical injection 100U BoNT-A ( BOTOX , Allergan , Irvine , CA , USA ) trigone ( treatment group ) suburothelium ( comparative group ) immediately follow cystoscopic hydrodistention intravenous general anesthesia operation room . Blood ( 10ml ) urine sample ( 30ml ) collect intravesical injection bladder hydrodistention . Bladder wall biopsy also perform hydrodistention . The patient allocate treatment control group permute block randomization code centrally control clinical pharmacist prepares solution injection . The intravesical injection perform urology attend doctor without record injection mode medical chart . The principle investigator , patient , study nurse know injection mode patient ' bladder keep study double-blind condition . Each vial BoNT-A dilute 10 ml normal saline , result 10U BoNT-A per 1.0 ml . Patients assign suburothelial BoNT-A injection receive 20 injection bladder body whereas assign trigonal injection receive 10 site injection trigonal area ( 5 injection behind interureteric ridge 5 inside trigone ) . The injection needle insert 1mm urothelium bladder wall , use 23 gauge needle rigid cystoscopic injection instrument ( 22 Fr , Richard Wolf , Knittlingen , Germany ) . Cystoscopic hydrodistention perform intravesical pressure 80 cm water 15 minute maximal bladder capacity ( MBC ) hydrodistention record . Bladder biopsies take four sit 2cm lateral posterior ureteral orifice hydrodistention . After BoNT-A injection , 14 Fr urethral Foley catheter indwell one night patient discharge next day . Oral antibiotic prescribe 7 day . Patients follow outpatient clinic 2 week 4 week later . Then patient follow out-patient clinic 2 week , 4 week 8 week . Data 3-day voiding diary symptom inventory use O'Leary-Sant symptom score , well information FBC , daily urinary frequency , nocturia , pain VAS record baseline , 2 week , 4 week , 8 week . The large voided volume 3-day voiding diary consider measure FBC . At 8-week follow-up intravesical injection patient question current bladder condition urodynamics study KCl test performed . The urodynamic study perform baseline 12 week intravesical treatment . The urodynamic parameter include first sensation bladder filling ( FSF ) , urge sensation ( US ) , cystometric bladder capacity ( CBC ) , detrusor pressure ( Pdet ) , maximum flow rate ( Qmax ) void postvoid residual ( PVR ) . KCl test also perform . The primary end-point study reduction bladder pain 8-week follow-up . If patient reduction VAS pain score 2 , consider successfully treat . The treatment outcome also assess global response assessment ( GRA ) evaluate overall perception treatment result . The result consider excellent patient report improvement GRA &gt; 2 patient become free bladder pain ( VAS=0 ) . The outcome consider improved improvement GRA =1 . Patients excellent improve result consider subjectively successful result . The result void diary , urodynamic study , IC symptom score pain VAS compare baseline 8-week end-point . Long-term successful result assess self-reported improved GRA pain VAS 6 month . Data compare treatment placebo group . A p-value le 0.05 consider statistically significant . If patient still feel bladder pain unsuccessful result end-point , repeat BoNT-A injection give 3 month procedure . At time , bladder biopsy , urine blood sample also collect study . . If patient want receive repeat BoNT-A injection , intravesical hyaluronic acid instillation proceed .</detailed_description>
