	<brief_summary>Background : Stomach cancer common around world . The US low-risk region . But 5-year survival rate US low . This cancer usually late stage time diagnose . One way detect earlier screen many people procedure call endoscopy . But may feasible low-risk develop country . Researchers want find biomarker early-stage disease help create effective way screen . DNA methylation chemical modification DNA . It generate signal certain cancer , include stomach cancer . Researchers want find blood-based DNA methylation marker stomach cancer . Objective : To study plasma DNA methylation potential biomarker detection stomach cancer . Eligibility : Participants 2 study already do China Design : Researchers use blood sample participant 2 study . The blood collect 1999/2000 . They use sample develop stomach cancer year 2006 . The sample stay cancer free time . Participants already give write informed consent . Researchers take DNA sample . They look methylation .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Despite markedly decline incidence recent decade , almost one million new case stomach cancer estimate occur 2012 , make fifth common malignancy world lung , breast , colorectal , prostate cancer . More 70 % case ( 677,000 case ) occur develop country , half occur Eastern Asia ( mainly China ) . Although North America consider low-risk region , 22,000 case diagnose US year . Five-year survival 2005-2011 US le 30 % , since stomach cancer generally asymptomatic early stage often metastasize time diagnosis . In contrast , 5-year survival rate almost 70 % South Korea Japan mass screen program implement large proportion stomach cancer detect early stage . UGI endoscopy consider gold standard diagnosis stomach cancer endoscopy-based mass screening may feasible relatively low-risk less developed region . Therefore , identification biomarkers early stage disease crucial development effective screening strategy . With recent advance cancer genetics assay technology , opportune time discover minimally invasive , specific , cost-effective biomarkers . A surprising discovery large scale cancer genome project TCGA enormous variation mutational pattern across within individual tumor type . Even commonly mutate gene typically alter less half case give cancer . The two frequently mutate driver gene stomach cancer , TP53 ( tumor protein p53 ) ARID1A ( AT rich interactive domain 1A ) , mutate 44 % 17 % case , respectively . Mutation rate remain stomach cancer driver gene even low . Importantly , mutation gene often spread across several exon complicates detection DNA-based sequence variation , since large number sample extensive genotyping require achieve adequate sensitivity power . In contrast , DNA methylation , chemical modification CpG dinucleotides alter base pair sequence , generate robust signal compare genetic alteration . For example , methylation Stratifin promoter find 96 % ( 24/25 ) breast carcinoma , 83 % ( 15/18 ) ductal carcinoma situ , 38 % ( 3/8 ) benign atypical hyperplasia , absent breast tissue healthy individual , suggest methylation status locus early event breast cancer could serve breast cancer biomarker . Aberrant DNA methylation occur early phase carcinogenesis contribute development progression . Notably , comprehensive molecular characterization 295 primary stomach cancer TCGA classify tumor four molecular subtypes . All four type exhibit DNA hypermethylation various degree , one type heavily methylated tumor group previously analyze TCGA . Moreover , study also suggest aberrant methylation may associate various pre-malignant condition like Helicobacter pylorus infection , severe gastritis , intestinal metaplasia , dysplasia , imply role epigenetic field effect may reflect early step neoplastic transformation stomach . Importantly , hypermethylation detect circulate cell-free DNA ( cfDNA ) think derive preneoplastic tumor tissue . Efforts discover blood-based DNA methylation marker underway various type cancer . In particular , plasma methylated SEPT9 DNA evaluate detection colorectal cancer , commercialblood test review approval US Food Drug Administration .</detailed_description>
