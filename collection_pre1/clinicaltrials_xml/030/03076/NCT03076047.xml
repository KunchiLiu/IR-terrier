	<brief_title>Capnography Post-Anesthesia Care Unit ( PACU )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Background Significance Carbon dioxide ( CO2 ) level monitor throughout respiratory cycle via capnography . In way , capnography allows healthcare professional follow number respiratory factor ( i.e. , depression , apnea , hypercapnia ) real-time . Earlier detection alteration ventilation status well enable provider accurately dose medication procedure , especially at-risk patient population patient obstructive sleep apnea ( OSA ) [ 1 , 2 ] . In recent study bariatric patient , approximately 15 % experience postoperative pulmonary complication . These patient could benefit significantly capnography monitoring measure accurately estimate prevalence respiratory complication . Through study seek understand end-tidal CO2 ( ETCO2 ) level patient obstructive sleep apnea vary patient post-anesthesia care unit ( PACU ) . By collect information patient outcome , hope good understand value monitoring technique at-risk patient population . Though capnography PACU previously demonstrate improve patient safety satisfaction , capnography never study population patient risk obstructive sleep apnea . Study Design This prospective , blind observational pilot study monitor change end-tidal CO2 level provide incremental value pulse oximetry detect respiratory difficulty ( i.e. , hypercapnia ) .</detailed_description>
