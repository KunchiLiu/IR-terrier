	<brief_summary>This phase Ib trial study side effect best dose niraparib give together radium Ra223 dichloride treat patient prostate cancer keep grow even amount testosterone body reduce low level spread primary site bone . Radium Ra 223 dichloride , act like calcium target cancer bone may deliver radiation directly bone tumor , limit damage surround normal tissue . Niraparib may stop growth tumor cell block enzymes need cell growth . Giving radium Ra 223 dichloride niraparib may work well treat patient hormone-resistant prostate cancer metastatic bone .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Radium Ra 223 Dichloride Niraparib Treating Patients With Hormone- Resistant Prostate Cancer Metastatic Bone</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To determine safe dose niraparib combine radium Ra 223 dichloride ( radium-223 ) patient metastatic castrate-resistant prostate cancer ( mCRPC ) receive prior chemotherapy . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . To determine proportion patient 50 % prostate-specific antigen ( PSA ) reduction baseline men treat niraparib radium 223 . II . To determine radiographic PFS ( rPFS ) 6 month men treat niraparib radium 223 . III . To determine proportion patient circulate tumor cell ( CTC ) conversion ( &gt; = 5 &lt; 5/7.5ml ) confirm second assessment &gt; 4 week later men treat niraparib radium 223 . IV . To determine overall progression-free survival men treat niraparib radium 223 . V. To determine time total-ALP ( alkaline phosphatase ) progression define patient total-ALP decline baseline &gt; = 25 % increase baseline value , least 12 week baseline . VI . To determine time total-ALP ( alkaline phosphatase ) progression define patient initial total-ALP decline baseline &gt; = 25 % increase nadir value , confirm second value obtain three week later . VII . To determine total-ALP normalization , define return total-ALP value within normal range 12 week 2 consecutive measurement ( least 2 week apart ) treatment patient ALP upper limit normal ( ULN ) baseline . VIII . To determine long term safety-tolerability combination niraparib radium 223 men treat niraparib radium 223 . TERTIARY OBJECTIVES : I . Study deoxyribonucleic acid ( DNA ) repair aberration ; whole exome transcriptome pre-therapy tumor biopsy sample . II . Compare change bone marrow micro-environment ( hematopoietic stem cell [ HSC ] niche\ C-X-C motif chemokine ligand 12 [ CXCL12 ] /C-X-C motif chemokine receptor 4 [ CXCR4 ] axis ) pre post therapy 10 men treat niraparib radium 223 . III . Evaluate baseline plasma cell-free ( cf ) -DNA aberration DNA repair gene breast cancer ( BRCA ) 1 , BRCA2 , ataxia telangiectasia mutate ( ATM ) , ataxia-telangiectasia rad3-related ( ATR ) , partner localizer brca2 gene ( PALB2 ) well androgen receptor ( AR ) gene via next generation sequence . IV . Compare gene expression change baseline serial ( end cycle 1 3 ) whole blood ribonucleic acid ( RNA ) ( collect blood edetic acid [ EDTA ] tube RNA-later ) use Nanostring PanCancer immunology panel . V. Evaluate baseline CTCs nuclear androgen receptor ( AR ) , phosphorylated ( p ) nuclear factor kappa-beta ( NF-kB ) , gamma-H2A histone family member X ( H2AX ) focus via immunostaining .</detailed_description>
