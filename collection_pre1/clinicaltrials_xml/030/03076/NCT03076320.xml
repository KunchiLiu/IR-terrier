	<brief_summary>Acne vulgaris complex skin disorder involve multiple abnormality pilosebaceous unit . Acne common skin disease puberty worsen throughout adolescence . However , epidemiological study suggest acne arise age , frequently affect individual puberty 30 year age , 79 % -95 % subject age 16 year 18 year 80 % subject puberty 30 year age . Acne consider main reason consultation dermatologist institutional private clinical practice . Clinical feature include seborrhoea , non-inflammatory lesion , inflammatory lesion various degree scar . There many classification acne scar severity . Moderate severe acne 15-20 % . Facial acne scar affect sex equally occur degree 95 % case . There significant correlation initial acne grade overall severity scar site sexes . This would suggest treatment aim reduce severity acne might reduce incidence scarring . Both superficial inflammatory acne lesion well deep nodular lesion seem capable produce scar . Conventional therapy recommend treatment acne vulgaris include retinoids , benzoyl peroxide ( BPO ) , antibiotic , hormonal therapy . Combination therapy use agent complementary mechanism provide opportunity target multiple pathogenetic cause acne vulgaris . The combination gel 0.1 % adapalene 2.5 % BPO once-daily treatment acne vulgaris . In several double- blind , randomize control trial ( RCTs ) , Adapalene-BPO ( A-BPO ) combination therapy apply daily 12 week significantly reduce number inflammatory non-inflammatory lesion subject moderate acne vulgaris . In Mexico available commercial product combination ( Effezel® ; Galderma ) . The limitation topical therapy low tolerability patient experiment several level irritation , erythema , dryness , desquamation , burning , itch ) , patient advise expect side effect , contribute discontinue therapy become severe . On hand , 5-methyl-1-phenyl-2- ( 1h ) -pyridone pirfenidone ( PFD ) wide-spectrum antifibrotic drug modulates diverse cytokine action , involve TGF-β , TNF-α , epidermal growth factor , platelet-derived growth factor , VEGF , IGF-1 , fibroblast growth factor , interferon-γ , interleukin ( IL ) -1 , IL-6 , IL-8 show promising effect vitro vivo setting . Also , PFD proven effective prevention regression pulmonary fibrosis , peritoneal sclerosis , hepatic cirrhosis , uterine fibromyoma , leave ventricular fibrosis , renal interstitial fibrosis , breast capsular contracture experimental model . A recently open phase II clinical trial evaluate therapeutic use PFD gel localize scleroderma . Results show act inflammatory fibrotic phase . The component Zaxcell modified-diallyl disulfide oxide ( M-DDO ) antimicrobial antiseptic agent , prove patient chronic diabetic ulcer potent germicide show increase beneficial effect PFD preventing infection , accelerate improve ulcer resolution . ( Observations publish ) . According , investigator believe Zaxcell ( PFD + M-DDO ) could play important role modulation inflammatory scar process acne . The investigator hypothesis PFD patient moderate severe acne modulates amplification inflammatory response , regulate inflammasome activation , macrophage polarization activity regulate wound heal process skin early fashion . Zaxcell innovative gel synergetic mode action could modulate inflammatory response . Furthermore , antiseptic property regulate process wound healing , fibrogenic scarring process . In vitro vivo study provide initial body evidence safety clinical benefit PFD , main component Zaxcell promise candidate treatment moderate severe acne .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Participants randomize use random number table distribute control ( Effezel ) experimental group ( Pirfenidone+M-DDO ) . Before screen , participant undergo informed consent process sign institutional review board-approved informed consent form . The study conduct accordance Good Clinical Practices principles origin Declaration Helsinki ( revise Seoul , Korea , 2008 ) . Potential subject acne scar select investigator practice solicit advertisement . To include , subject must meet inclusion criterion . Demographics data medical history register monthly basis . Before treatment , subject inflammation scar evaluate face back area use Investigator´s Global Assessment scale ( IGA scale ) lesion count . The face back area affect map photograph . Participants experimental group receive topical Zaxcell ( Pirfenidone 10 % +M-DDO gel ) two time day face superior back patient control group receive Effezel ( Adapalene 0.1 % +Benzoyl peroxide 2.5 % ) day . Both group apply topical treatment acne face superior back area six month previous cleanse area neutral soap . Two biopsy skin take beginning , month one month 3 back area treatment apply . After time , clinical evaluation photograph perform . Participants evaluate every month 6 month last application .</detailed_description>
