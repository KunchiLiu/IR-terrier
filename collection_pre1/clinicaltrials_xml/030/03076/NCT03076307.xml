	<brief_summary>Patients Parkinson 's disease ( PD ) know affected subtle cognitive impairment early disease course , mostly executive field . Procedural motor skill , mainly control basal ganglion associative loop ( particular dorsal caudate nucleus ) ( Rodriguez-Oroz et al. , 2009 ) , also study patient PD ( Schnider et al. , 1995 ; Muslimovic et al. , 2007 ; Terpening et al. , 2013 ) . However , correlation dopaminergic 123I-FP-CIT SPECT image cognitive impairment assess . One reason absence reference value striatal uptake recently . Last year , investigator establish local uptake reference value DAT image base large cohort subject non-degenerative condition ( Nicastro et al. , 2016 ) therefore use value precisely assess uptake loss patient PD . With present study , investigator expect enroll patient early PD 123I-FP-CIT SPECT previously perform center . Subjects perform specific motor task base mirror-drawing star-shaped figure . This do invert direction horizontal/vertical computer mouse movement screen . Speed error rate assess patient well healthy control subject . Correlation striatal SPECT uptake , especially caudate nucleus uptake , analyzed PD patient . In addition , resting-state EEG perform subject . General medication dopaminergic drug particular , whenever use , discontinue . For subject enrol study , cognitive neurological examination perform .</brief_summary>
