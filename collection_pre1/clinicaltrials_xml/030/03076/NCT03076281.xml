	<brief_summary>This randomized phase II trial study well metformin hydrochloride doxycycline work treat patient head neck squamous cell carcinoma remove surgery . Metformin hydrochloride may reduce metabolic activity cancer cell surround supportive tissue . Doxycycline may minimize toxic side effect anti-cancer therapy . Giving metformin hydrochloride doxycycline may work well treat patient head neck squamous cell carcinoma .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Metformin Hydrochloride Doxycycline Treating Patients With Head Neck Squamous Cell Carcinoma That Can Be Removed Surgery</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To determine treatment metformin hydrochloride ( metformin ) , doxycycline , combination metformin doxycycline increase percentage stromal cell express CAV1 patient squamous cell carcinoma head neck . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . To determine effect metformin , doxycycline , metformin doxycycline treatment percentage tumor cell apoptotic determine TdT-Mediated dUTP Nick End Labeling Assay ( TUNEL ) assay , express MCT4 , MCT1 , BGAL , TOMM20 squamous carcinoma head neck region tumor cell . II . To assess safety tolerability metformin , doxycycline , metformin doxycycline treatment subject squamous cell carcinoma head neck . TERTIARY OBJECTIVES : I . To assess effect metformin , doxycycline , metformin doxycycline therapy metabolic profile cancer cell stroma use mass spectroscopy imaging ( MSI ) pair sample , compare metabolite profile pre-treatment post-treatment tumor sample . II . To assess effect metformin , doxycycline , metformin doxycycline therapy metabolic state patient characterize serologically : erythrocyte sedimentation rate , exosome evaluation , metabolomics profile , micro ribonucleic acid ( RNA ) expression profile physiologically perform nutritional assessment via nutritionist-mediated 3-day dietary recall compare patient 's estimate dietary intake estimate caloric need .</detailed_description>
