	<criteria>INCLUSION CRITERIA : Patients must histologically confirm thymoma thymic carcinoma pathology department/CCR/NCI . Patients must least one prior line platinumbased chemotherapy patient must refuse cytotoxic chemotherapy . Progressive disease must document prior study entry patient must advance , unresectable disease amenable surgical resection . Prior treatment PD1 PDL1directed immune checkpoint blockade permit treatment discontinue due disease progression lifethreatening adverse event per investigator discretion ( laboratory abnormality alone prior therapy exclude patient trial ) . Disease must measurable least 1 unidimensional measurable lesion RECIST 1.1 . Male female subject age great equal 18 year Because dose adverse event data currently available use Avelumab patient &lt; 18 year age , child exclude study , eligible future pediatric trial . ECOG performance status less equal 1 . Patients must normal organ marrow function define : absolute neutrophil count : great equal 1,500/mm^3 OR great equal 1.5 x 10^9/L platelet great equal 100,000/mm^3 OR great equal 100 x 10^9/L hemoglobin great equal 9g/dL ( may transfuse ) total bilirubin less equal 1.5 x upper limit normal range ( ULN ) AST ( SGOT ) /ALT ( SGPT ) less equal 2.5 x ULN OR less equal 5 x ULN subject document metastatic disease liver creatinine clearance great equal 30 mL/min accord Cockcroft Gault formula ( local institutional standard method ) Highly effective contraception male female subject risk conception exists . ( Note : The effect study drug develop human fetus unknown . Thus , woman childbearing potential men must agree use highly effective contraception , define 2 barrier method , 1 barrier method spermicide , intrauterine device use oral female contraceptive . Effective contraception must use 30 day prior first study drug administration , duration trial participation , least 60 day last avelumab treatment administration risk conception exists . Should woman become pregnant suspect pregnant partner participate trial , treat physician inform immediately . ) Pregnancy test : negative serum urine pregnancy test screen woman childbearing potential . EXCLUSION CRITERIA : Concurrent treatment nonpermitted drug Concurrent anticancer treatment within 28 day start trial treatment ( e.g. , cytoreductive therapy , radiotherapy [ exception palliative bone direct radiotherapy ] , immune therapy , cytokine therapy except erythropoietin ) ; major surgery within 28 day start trial treatment ( exclude prior diagnostic biopsy ) ; concurrent systemic therapy immunosuppressive agent within 28 day start trial treatment ; use hormonal agent within 7 day start trial treatment ; use investigational drug within 28 day start trial treatment . History previous malignant disease within last 2 year follow exception : basal squamous cell carcinoma skin , cervical carcinoma situ , ductal carcinoma situ breast , papillary follicular thyroid carcinoma , nonmuscle invasive bladder cancer . Active autoimmune disease might deteriorate receive immunestimulatory agent . Patients diabetes type 1 , vitiligo , psoriasis , pure red cell aplasia , Good syndrome hypo hyperthyroid diseases require immunosuppressive treatment eligible . Patients symptomatic brain metastasis exclude trial secondary poor prognosis . However , patient treatment brain metastasis whose brain disease remain stable 3 month without steroid therapy may enrol . Active infection require systemic therapy significant acute chronic infection include , among others : Hepatitis B virus ( HBV ) hepatitis C virus ( HCV ) infection screen ( positive HBV surface antigen HCV RNA antiHCV antibody screen test positive ) . Known history test positive HIV know acquire immunodeficiency syndrome . Prior organ transplantation include allogenic stemcell transplantation . Known prior severe hypersensitivity investigational product component formulation , include know severe hypersensitivity reaction monoclonal antibody ( NCI CTCAE v4.03 Grade great equal 3 ) . Persisting toxicity relate prior therapy ( NCI CTCAE v. 4.03 Grade &gt; 1 ) however , alopecia , sensory neuropathy Grade le equal 2 , Grade le equal 2 constitute safety risk base investigator judgment acceptable . Pregnancy lactation period . Note : negative pregnancy test require woman childbearing potential . Women postmenopausal ( agerelated amenorrhea great equal 12 consecutive month folliclestimulating hormone ( FSH ) &gt; 40 milli international unit per milliliter [ mIU/ml ] ) , undergone hysterectomy bilateral oophorectomy exempt pregnancy test . If necessary confirm postmenopausal status FSH level include screening . Pregnant woman exclude study Avelumab class agent know antineoplastics/monoclonal antibody potential teratogenic abortifacient effect .

Clinically significant ( i.e . active ) cardiovascular disease : cerebral vascular accident/stroke ( &lt; 6 month prior enrollment ) , myocardial infarction ( &lt; 6 month prior enrollment ) , unstable angina , congestive heart failure great equal New York Heart Association Classification Class II , serious cardiac arrhythmia require medication . All severe acute chronic medical condition include colitis , inflammatory bowel disease , pneumonitis , pulmonary fibrosis psychiatric condition include recent ( within past year ) active suicidal ideation behavior ; laboratory abnormality may increase risk associate study participation study treatment administration may interfere interpretation study result , judgment investigator , would make patient inappropriate entry study . Any psychiatric condition would prohibit understanding rendering informed consent . Legal incapacity limit legal capacity . Nononcology vaccine therapy prevention infection disease ( e.g . seasonal flu vaccine , human papilloma virus vaccine ) within 4 week study drug administration . Vaccination study also prohibit except administration inactivate vaccine ( e.g . inactivate influenza vaccine ) . HIVpositive TET patient ineligible risk develop opportunistic infection treatment immune checkpoint inhibitor . Prior case disseminate herpes virus fungal infection document patient population .</criteria>
