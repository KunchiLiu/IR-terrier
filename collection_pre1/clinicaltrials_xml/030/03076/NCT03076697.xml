	<detailed_description>Millions Americans risk sight-threatening disease either unable access eye care service unaware eye care screen could reduce risk vision loss . In addition , national shortage eye care provider . Primary care provider lack resource effectively screen sight-threatening condition . Of three lead cause permanent vision loss blindness adult United States ( namely , diabetic retinopathy , glaucoma , age-related macular degeneration ) , three disease largely affect structure refer `` posterior part eye . '' This encompass retina optic nerve , well accompany vasculature . The posterior part eye require advanced instrumentation , training , technological advance visualize pathology optimize examination posterior part eye , accordingly screen sight-threatening eye disease manner feasible previously . However still largely restricted eye care-specific setting train resource available invest technologically-advanced instrument . Thus , remain critical need develop safe , effective , readily available , efficient method tool optimize examination screen sight threatening disease . In addition , tool applicable variety eye care setting , include inpatient outpatient clinical context order optimize eye care . In absence tool , patient continue limited access eye care remain risk sight-threatening eye condition otherwise could prevent manage appropriately . Diabetes mellitus lead cause death disability worldwide . The World Health Organization estimate 346 million people worldwide DM estimate 552 million people may affect 2030 . Diabetic retinopathy common microvascular complication diabetes , affect nearly patient history diabetes 15 year . Among US adult age 40 old , estimate 28.5 % -40.3 % diabetic diabetic retinopathy 4.4 % -8.2 % vision-threatening retinopathy , high estimate among non-Hispanic black individual . Epidemiological study National Eye Institute reveal diabetes lead cause vision loss working-age adult U.S. , guideline recommend patient diabetes undergo , minimum , yearly dilate examination posterior part eye . This particularly important detect treat diabetes-associated eye condition , patient often asymptomatic advanced stage , point vision recovery may limit . Despite absence visual symptom patient early diabetic eye complication , condition diabetic retinopathy recognizable latent stage , readily diagnose grade retinal imaging ( fundus photography ) . Given prevalence clinically-silent ( examination-apparent ) progression , diabetic retinopathy ideal screen disease . Furthermore , visual outcome favor early detection treatment.. There effective , universally agreed-upon treatment diabetic retinopathy include laser photocoagulation proliferative retinopathy , intravitreal injection focal photocoagulation diabetic macular edema , improve glucose blood pressure control . Despite guideline annual screen benefit early detection relate vision outcome overall diabetic disease control , substantial gap care regard annual retinal screening diabetic . It estimate nearly half adult DM US receive recommended screening . Screening may even sporadic area world shortage ophthalmologist . This study seek determine whether smartphone camera attachable device optic illumination specific image posterior part eye effective screening tool could use optimize posterior eye exam , improve access , ease diagnosis , early intervention eye disease . Glaucoma another disease affect posterior part eye , specifically optic nerve , second lead cause blindness worldwide . In particular , open-angle glaucoma chronic , insidious disease progressive loss peripheral central vision . When diagnose treat early , however , permanent vision loss , manifest later stage disease , may prevent . The diagnosis glaucoma typically rely structural change optic nerve functional visual field deficit . Diagnosing screen glaucoma resource-poor setting challenge . For example , study Frequency Doubling Technique ( FDT ) perimetry rural India find low sensitivity test ( 7 % ) , whereas study industrialize setting find much high sensitivity ( 59 % ) . Furthermore , many structural test modality OCT retinal nerve fiber layer stereoscopic optic nerve photography require specialized equipment expert analysis order effectively use diagnosis . Age-related macular degeneration ( AMD ) lead cause irreversible blindness develop world . Worldwide , 14 million people blind due wet AMD . By 2020 , estimate 196 million people suffer AMD worldwide . The US population AMD double 2050 . Dry AMD account 90 % AMD patient , wet AMD cause majority visual impairment . Dry AMD characterize drusen various size characteristic pigmentary change classification system . Fundus photography establish method perform characterization . Patients dry AMD risk progression wet AMD , occur rate 13 % within 5 year . When dry AMD progress wet AMD , change occur fundus appearance include presence retinal fluid bleeding . Wet AMD require prompt treatment prevent vision loss . The visual acuity initiation anti-VEGF therapy best predictor final visual acuity 2 year therapy . Treatment wet AMD anti-VEGF therapy result improvement stabilization vision 90 % wet AMD patient . Currently patient dry AMD evaluate annually possible progression instruct monitor vision daily home approximately half case wet AMD come patient symptom half asymptomatic physician follow-up . Several home monitoring system develop , include Amsler grid Foresee Home monitoring use Vernier hyperacuity . Fundus photography another method monitoring due visually apparent change occur , utilization low-cost , smartphone-based fundus photography system would greatly increase access . Additionally , within pediatric population , similarly critical need develop effective , efficient , child-friendly method evaluate pediatric eye ( particularly intraocular/posterior eye ) diseases . Pediatric patient pose challenge exam , general anesthesia sometimes need child unable tolerate complete eye exam . Refined instrumentation technological advance comfortable pediatric patient may make possible explore novel , noninvasive photographic tool optimize eye care special patient population within wider range establish care setting minimize need exam anesthesia distress patient . For example , leukocoria ( white red reflex ) important referral ensure patient eye cancer call retinoblastoma . Given difficulty examine patient , provider time take patient operate room exam anesthesia , risk anesthesia along high cost . Importantly , Retinopathy prematurity ( ROP ) occur abnormal blood vessel grow retina cause blindness premature baby . ROP happen often baby survive young age due advance neonatal care . Screening ROP challenge many hospital child 's eye specialist staff nearby . This much large public health problem develop country neonatal care improve ophthalmic expertise pediatric eye disease lack . ROP telemedicine program allows physicians send image interpret large medical center , like U-M Kellogg Eye Center . Babies bear 31 week weigh less 1,500 gram undergo repeat screening monitor ROP . Photographs baby ' eye take use pediatric retinal camera . Kellogg team routinely evaluate image together remotely make follow treatment decision . As example indicate , need cheap , reliable , user-friendly diagnostic modality screen posterior eye disease , particularly resource-poor community internationally , order prevent blindness . Increasing accessibility portability eye exam hold great promise improve reach ophthalmic care , remote community inpatient setting . Ophthalmology uniquely suit remote screen evaluation give optical transparency eye importance ocular examination diagnose eye disease . This study evaluate smartphone-based camera capable capture high quality , wide field image retina . This multi-site , cross-sectional diagnostic study conduct multiple site . At site , patient approach clinic , inpatient , operate room setting . Photographs take smartphone-based camera along standard care , include traditional desktop fundus photography . The feasibility accuracy smartphone-based camera diagnose eye disease test . Several ophthalmology specialist grade smartphone fundus photograph , traditional retinal photograph , document eye examination eye disease question ( diabetic retinopathy , age relate macular degeneration , glaucoma , retinopathy prematurity , etc. ) . The agreement grader diagnosis eye disease assess . The sensitivity specificity diabetic retinopathy glaucoma diagnose smartphone also assess , use traditional retinal imaging reference standard separate analysis use ophthalmologist 's examination reference standard . The follow aim project : Aim 1 : ass sensitivity specificity diagnosis posterior eye disease ( e.g. , diabetic retinopathy , glaucoma , macular degeneration ) smartphone camera relative ( A ) ophthalmologist examination outpatient inpatient care setting ( B ) traditional fundus photography feasible . Aim 2 : assess feasibility smartphone-based camera pediatric-friendly approach image posterior eye disease ( retina optic nerve head ) outpatient , inpatient , operative care setting , assess sensitivity specificity diagnosis screen important pediatric condition ( e.g . leukocoria retinopathy prematurity ) . Aim 3 : ass agreement mask grader diagnosis different disease involve posterior eye image smartphone-based camera .</detailed_description>
