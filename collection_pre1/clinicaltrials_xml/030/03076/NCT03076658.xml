	<brief_summary>A study skeletal structure structure change time . The aim study evaluate skeleton 10 year increment determine understand normal skeleton person age . By use x-ray analysis , new low dose x-ray system ( EOS ) use evaluate whole body see change bone structure time . Subjects ask undertake one x-ray analysis whole body skeletal structure . There 25 male 25 female subject per decade . The averaging measure skeletal parameter provide information change time generate standardize expectation general change skeletal structure participant age .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Current technique advance spinal surgery allow physician correct complex spinal deformity nearly alignment desire . The investigator ability analyze spino-pelvic alignment evolve concurrently ; however , investigator goals deformity correction still completely understood . With increase ability ass whole body alignment , investigator must establish baseline `` normal '' population inclusive age relate change . investigator hypothesis global body alignment vary base sex progressively vary age . The goal study create open access database `` normal '' volunteer full body radiographic image obtain use new EOS biplanar x-ray imaging system . The system provide radiographic view weight-bearing skeleton equivalent plain radiography . The development open access database full body image global spine parameter provide spine surgeon normative data use guide clinical decision make surgical planning . Furthermore , database use researcher obtain control measurement comparison study various spine , potentially non-spine , pathology . Specific Aims 1 . To create open access database radiographic full body image sagittal coronal plane subjectswithout spine deformity acute severe chronic disease , across range age group 20 80 year old male female . 2 . To document age relate change occur radiographic parameter spine pelvis include subject across wide range age .</detailed_description>
