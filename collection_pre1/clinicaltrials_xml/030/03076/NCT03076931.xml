	<brief_summary>Objective : The purpose proposal use High Speed Videoendoscopy ( HSV ) develop test image biomarker support diagnosis predict vibratory outcome airway reconstruction . Our protocol involve elicit record follow five behavior : ( 1 ) hard throat clear ; ( 2 ) cough ; ( 3 ) laugh ; ( 4 ) short multiple phonation ; ( 5 ) sustain phonation . These HSV recording use develop biomarkers . Study Design : A prospective cohort study 60 patient , 36 undergo airway reconstruction 24 age match control . Setting : Center Pediatric Voice Disorders , Department Otolaryngology , Cincinnati Children 's Hospital Medical Center Methods : Subjects undergo full voice evaluation , include HSV evaluation protocol , main study site prior airway reconstruction , 6 month post 1 year post surgery . Voice evaluation include aerodynamic , acoustic , perceptual voice assessment , pediatric voice handicap index questionnaire , videostroboscopy , HSV . The airway evaluation include airway sizing calibration .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Fifty percent child undergo airway reconstruction subglottic stenosis ( narrow airway vocal fold ) develop voice disorder . Voice disorder lead psychosocial problem affect many child lifetime , specifically career choice long-term quality life . Our current understanding voice problem follow surgical airway reconstruction limit . There lack research understand alteration phonatory mechanism due underlie initial condition ( stenosis ) surgical airway reconstruction perform . The purpose proposal develop test image biomarkers support diagnosis surgical decision-making lead improved voice outcome . The overarch goal work establish foundation upon surgical practice could enhance improve voice outcome still achieve optimal airway result . Specifically , project use : prospective pre- post-surgery cohort design develop imaging biomarker `` vibratory potential '' predict vibratory outcome airway reconstruction . Quantitative image processing methodology use development validation new image biomarkers , base high-speed videoendoscopy . This research project address substantial gap knowledge pediatric voice airway surgery , potential significantly improve quality life patient severe difficult manage voice disorder . The result could translate adult patient population voice disorder ( e.g . development disease-specific imaging biomarkers ) .</detailed_description>
