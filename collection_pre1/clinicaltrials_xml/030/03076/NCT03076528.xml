	<brief_summary>Among patient diabetes 35 % suffer chronic renal disease may require dialysis kidney replacement time . Furthermore , diabetic end stage renal disease ( ESRD ) require dialysis , risk foot complication amputation even common , expensive , devastate . Interestingly , even though incidence foot ulcer patient dialysis report patient history foot ulcer ; dialysis patient significantly high rate foot amputation . The goal research incorporate innovative virtually supervise non-weight bearing exercise patient undergoing dialysis reduce risk fall foot ulceration enhance low extremity blood flow , joint perception joint mobility . Diabetic patient hemodialysis Hamad Medical Company recruit randomize either intervention ( IG ) control ( CG ) group follow 6 month . The intervention group take part 4-week non-weight bearing exercise program twice per week hemodialysis clinic supervision qualify research staff member . This intervention include interactive game-based exercise include repetitive ankle foot movement . Wearable sensor provide real-time visual/auditory feedback foot ankle position allow perception motor-errors motor-action . The control group instruct complete supervised foot ankle exercise without use sensor technology . Changes balance , gait , physical activity , incidence foot problem compare pre- post-intervention . In addition , incident fall , foot ulcer , limb amputation 6 month post intervention document . Investigators hypothesize patient receive sensor-based exercise benefit compare group receive conventional non-technology training term improve functional performance reduce incidence foot problem , fall , limb amputation .</brief_summary>
