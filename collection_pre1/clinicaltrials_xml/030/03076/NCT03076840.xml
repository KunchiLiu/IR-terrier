	<brief_summary>The hamstring muscle important muscle affect performance almost activity daily living . Since muscle large muscle pas across two major joint ( hip knee joint ) , susceptible become tight lose extensibility . On hand , agreement standard protocol treatment hamstring tightness . Kinesio tape one option treatment hamstring muscle , safe , passive non-painful intervention , proven effective help individual especially poor compliance poor tolerance painful stretching exercise . The aim present study investigate acute effectiveness Kinesio tap hamstring muscle extensibility . 96 student hamstring tightness recruit University Dammam participate prospective experimental study . All participant assign randomly either Kinesio tape group , Sham tape group control group . Outcome measure hamstring length measurement use active knee extension test strength measurement hamstring quadriceps muscle use handheld dynamometer . Outcome measurement take baseline 15 minute intervention .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Design : Prospective , pre-post experimental study three group ( Kinesio tape group , sham tape group control group ) Setting : This study conduct laboratory University Dammam one session ( half hour ) participant . Participants : 96 student hamstring tightness recruit University Dammam sample convenience participate study . These student enrol study base follow inclusion exclusion criterion . Inclusion Criteria : 1 . Female student age 18-25 year 2 . Body mass index 18-30 ) 3. student reduce hamstring length ( hamstring tightness ) define literature ( popliteal angle le 160 degree ) Exclusion criterion : 1. low limb musculoskeletal pain 2. abdominal , low limb spinal surgery 3. pregnancy 4. previous injury trauma hamstring muscle , hip , knee And ankle joint 5 . Skin allergy , disease hypersensitivity 6 . Low back pain neurological impairment low extremity 7 . Body mass index 30 18 Procedure : A poster announcement publish University Dammam , 96 female student recruit convenience sampling student . The possible participant approach idea research ( duration participation , length treatment session , goal research , possible risk include skin irritation allergy Kinesio tape ) explain student . The student instruct deal skin irritation remove tape apply ice area 10-15 min , student inform compensation skin reaction due Kinesio tape , although may less likely happen . The student give chance ask question . If student agree participate research , give consent form read ask question detail ask sign consent form . After , subject scan eligibility fit inclusion exclusion criterion primary researcher , This do safe secure room laboratory physical therapy department evaluation intervention procedure take place . If student fit eligibility , student undergoing tape allergy test apply small piece Kinesio tape patient skin 10 minute . If student pass test allergy reaction , enrol study . Students age , height , weight body mass index ( BMI ) record , student undergo 5 minute walk warm pre-condition muscle examination . Then , hamstring length measurement , strength measurement hamstring quadriceps muscle do ( All student data cod stored primary researcher secure password ensure student data confidentiality ) . The outcome measure : 1 . Hamstring length measurement : Hamstring muscle length measure use active knee extension test ( AKE ) ( Active knee extension reliable associate minimal pelvic lumber motion . Therefore , considers suitable preferable test evaluate length hamstring muscle . The knee extension angle ( popliteal angle ) measure use conventional goniometer reliable tool measure range motion The hamstring length measurement perform student supine position 90-degree hip flexion touch horizontal bar apparatus.The non-tested low limb secure strap attach table . While student maintains contact thigh horizontal bar apparatus , ask extend leg much possible . The angle knee joint measure researcher goniometer . The measurement do three time , mean value record 2 . Hamstring quadriceps muscle strength measurement : The hamstring quadriceps muscle strength measure primary researcher use handheld dynamometer . The hamstring strength measurement do student prone position , student ask flex knee hard possible researcher try prevent movement handheld dynamometer proximal medial malleolus . The quadriceps strength measurement do procedure sit position student ask extend knee After finish baseline outcome measure ( hamstring length measurement strength measurement ) , student give number assign randomly either Kinesio tape group sham tape group control group . Each group fellow program . The outcome measurement repeat 15 min conclusion treatment period</detailed_description>
