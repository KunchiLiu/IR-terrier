	<detailed_description>Dentin hypersensitivity characterize acute short-term pain multifactorial etiology . This condition clinical challenge due different treatment protocol available . Therefore , aim study double blind randomize clinical trial , evaluate effectiveness different clinical protocol reduction dentin hypersensitivity . Thirty-two patient dentin hypersensitivity least three teeth selected.The teeth randomly divide two different group accord desensitization approach ( single agent neural action ; single agent obliterate action ; associate technique ( neural obliterator agent ) . The dentin hypersensitivity level evaluate immediately desensitization 1 , 2 , 4,12 24 week . Data collect , tabulate submit statistical analysis .</detailed_description>
