	<brief_title>Genetic Evaluation Men - The GEM Registry</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Objectives : 1 . Collect detailed family cancer history , personal medical history , prostate cancer clinical feature , exposure history men prostate cancer men without prostate cancer support study focus identify hereditary cancer syndromes genetic/epidemiologic factor predispose prostate cancer susceptibility . 2 . Collect behavioral measure support research focus assess need men undergo cancer risk evaluation satisfaction process . 3 . Create maintain biospecimen bank specimen men prostate cancer without prostate cancer support study focus genetic alteration predispose prostate cancer risk . 4 . Perform targeted broad-scale genetic genomic sequencing detect genetic alteration relate prostate cancer risk . 5 . Develop mechanisms recontact participant update research genetic result guide genetic testing inherit prostate cancer risk .</detailed_description>
