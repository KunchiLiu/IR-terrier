	<brief_summary>The purpose study investigate person dietary intake effect gut microbiome association two variable weight glucoregulation . Specifically , investigator compare gut microbiota , fast glucose insulin , c-peptide hemoglobin A1-c three group subject : obese patient ( BMI ≥ 30 kg/m2 ) type 2 diabetes mellitus ( T2DM ) , obese patient without T2DM , normal weight lean control without T2DM . Each patient also complete detailed dietary recall ( ASA-24 ) investigate association diet , microbiome weight/glucoregulation .</brief_summary>
