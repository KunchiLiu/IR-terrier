	<brief_summary>This two-center ( University Colorado , University California San Francisco ) community-based comparative effectiveness study outpatient palliative care Parkinson 's disease ( PD ) relate disorder ( progressive supranuclear palsy ( PSP ) , corticobasal degeneration ( CBD ) , multiple system atrophy ( MSA ) , Lewy Body Dementia ( LBD ) . It utilize randomized stepped-wedge design compare patient caregiver outcomes usual care community versus usual care augment palliative training telemedicine support provide resource ( e.g . social work ) .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>More Than Movement Disorder : Applying Palliative Care Parkinson 's Disease</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Parkinson 's disease ( PD ) second common neurodegenerative illness affect approximately 1.5 million Americans 14th lead cause death United States . PD traditionally describe movement disorder characteristic motor symptom ( e.g . tremor ) . However , recent research demonstrate impact nonmotor symptom pain , depression , dementia mortality , quality life ( QOL ) , nurse home placement caregiver distress . Regarding model care PD , evidence suggests care include neurologist result low mortality nursing home placement care solely primary care physician . Unfortunately , also significant evidence many need important PD patient caregiver ( e.g . depression , plan future ) poorly address current model care . Palliative care approach care individual life-threatening illness focus address potential cause suffer include physical psychiatric symptom , psychosocial issue spiritual need . While developed cancer patient , palliative care approach successfully apply chronic progressive illness include heart failure pulmonary disease . To date minimal attempt apply principle PD although evidence suggest PD patient ' unmet need current model care may amenable palliative care . A small grow cadre center offer outpatient palliative care PD early evidence efficacy randomize trial academic-based outpatient palliative care underway lead investigator proposal . While work critical forwarding field , work need provide model widely disseminate . The current proposal address gap assess effectiveness feasibility novel community-based intervention empowers community neurology practice improve care PD patient caregiver palliative care training , coach telemedicine resource . The investigator hypothesize intervention improve patient QOL caregiver burden prove feasible acceptable community provider . The investigator Specific Aims : 1 ) Determine ) effectiveness b ) feasibility novel community-based outpatient palliative care intervention PD . ; 2 ) Describe effect intervention patient caregiver cost service utilization ; 3 ) Identify opportunity optimize community-based palliative care population : ) describe patient caregiver characteristic associate intervention benefit ; b ) direct patient , caregiver provider interview . Innovations investigator approach include novel model provide disease-specific community-based palliative care dependent limit palliative specialist resource , stepped-wedge trial design use telemedicine resource provide multidisciplinary care . The research significant create foundation future community-based dissemination study PD broad field palliative care .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Patients must fluent English Speakers , Must age 40 , They must meet United Kingdom ( UK ) Brain Bank criterion probable PD , They must meet standard criterion progressive supranuclear palsy ( PSP ) , corticobasal degeneration ( CBD ) , multiple system atrophy ( MSA ) , Lewy Body Dementia ( LBD ) . Patients must high risk poor outcome define Brief Needs Assessment Tool ( BNAT ) screen psychosocial issue , symptom , caregiver burden . Caregivers identify ask patient : `` Could ( participant ) tell u one person help ( participant ) ( participant 's ) PD outside clinic ? '' Caregivers may selfidentified case severe dementia order obtain data relevant vulnerable underrepresented group . Urgent palliative care need ( patient randomize offer appropriate service immediately ) ; Unable unwilling commit study procedure ; Presence additional chronic medical illness may require palliative service ( e.g . metastatic cancer ) ; Already receive palliative care hospice service . Not expect continue care enrol physician least 6 month . The investigator purposefully keep inclusion/exclusion criterion broad allow great generalizability result ensure inclusion potentially underrepresented understudied subgroup .</criteria>
