	<brief_title>Neural Biomarkers Clozapine Response</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>A large number patient chronic psychotic disorder continue symptom follow unsuccessful trial first-line antipsychotic drug . For patient refractory psychosis , clozapine consistently demonstrate superior efficacy . Clozapine often underutilized administer late patient 's course treatment , lead increased morbidity , unnecessary medication trial , increase health care expenditure . Meanwhile , mechanism action underlie clozapine 's novel effect remain unknown studied modern neuroimaging method . Identifying neural mechanism clozapine exerts effect may lead biomarkers facilitate efficient utilization drug , introduce novel treatment target . In patient refractory psychotic symptom , propose study use resting-state task-based functional MRI ( fMRI ) examine neural circuitry efficacious treatment trial clozapine . Patients undergo fMRI scan 12 week treatment , aim determine : baseline pattern resting-state functional connectivity task-based activation predict response treatment ; change resting-state task-based functional circuitry associate efficacious treatment . Results proposal may lead biomarkers optimize treatment algorithms psychotic disorder facilitate drug development refractory psychosis .</detailed_description>
