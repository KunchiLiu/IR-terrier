	<detailed_description>The objective study determine whether new minimally invasive method vivo measurement cortical bone tissue property identify risk fragility fracture hip radius . Our hypothesis woman fragility fracture hip radius alter cortical bone tissue property compare non-fracture control independent standard clinical test , BMD . To test hypothesis , propose two aim : Aim 1 : Compare cortical bone tissue property assess vivo reference point indentation woman hip fracture non-fracture control . We compare cortical bone tissue material property , assess novel vivo indentation mid-tibia postmenopausal woman recent hip fracture ( n ) age-similar control without fracture ( n= ) . In addition vivo indentation measurement , assess hip spine BMD DXA ; well factor may influence risk fracture ( e.g , vit D status , medication use physical activity ) . Hypotheses : Postmenopausal woman hip fracture bad bone tissue material property compare non-fracture control even adjustment BMD potential confounders . Aim 2 : Compare cortical bone tissue property assess vivo reference point indentation woman distal radius fracture non-fracture control . We compare cortical bone tissue material property , assess novel vivo indentation mid-tibia postmenopausal woman recent distal radius fracture ( n ) age-similar control without fracture ( n= ) . In addition vivo indentation measurement , assess hip spine BMD DXA ; well factor may influence risk fracture ( e.g , vit D status , medication use physical activity ) . Hypotheses : Postmenopausal woman distal radius fracture bad bone tissue material property compare non-fracture control even adjustment BMD potential confounders . Successful completion project address need good assess bone mechanical property tissue level order accurately predict fracture risk . The study provide novel information possible clinical utility minimally invasive , vivo bone indentation measurement measure bone strength relationship fracture risk .</detailed_description>
