	<brief_summary>Autologous T cell engineer express anti-CD19 chimeric antigen receptor ( CAR ) infuse back patient B cell malignancy , include lymphoma leukemia . The patient monitor infusion anti-CD19 CAR-transduced T cell adverse event , persistence anti-CD19 CAR-transduced T cell treatment efficacy . Objectives : To evaluate safety efficacy anti-CD19 CAR-transduced T cell therapy patient B cell malignancy . Eligibility : Patients 1 80 year age , relapse refractory CD19-expressing B-cell malignancy ( leukemia lymphoma ) respond standard treatment . Patients history allogeneic stem cell transplant meet eligibility criterion eligible participate . Patients must adequate organ function . Design : Peripheral blood patient collect isolation peripheral blood mononuclear cell ( PBMCs ) , transduce lentiviral retroviral vector encode anti-CD19 CAR contain CD28 4-1BB CD3 zeta costimulatory domain . Patients receive lymphodepleting precondition regimen prepare immune system accept modified T cell . Patients receive infusion modify T cell . They remain hospital monitored adverse event recover treatment . Patients frequent follow-up visit monitor persistence modify T cell efficacy treatment .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Anti-CD19 Chimeric Antigen Receptor ( CAR ) -Transduced T Cell Therapy Patients With B Cell Malignancies</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Despite progress make date treatment patient B cell malignancy , include leukemia lymphoma , many patient relapse refractory disease respond standard treatment . It show anti-CD19 CAR-transduced T cell may effective approach treat relapse refractory disease . The procedure involve collect PBMCs patient modify T cell attack malignant B cell . In trial , autologous T cell engineer express anti-CD19 chimeric antigen receptor ( CAR ) contain signal domain CD28 4-1BB CD3-zeta infuse back patient B cell malignancy , include lymphoma leukemia . The patient pretreated lymphodepleting precondition regimen infusion anti-CD19 CAR T cell , monitor adverse event , persistence anti-CD19 CAR-transduced T cell treatment efficacy . OBJECTIVES : Primary objective : To determine safety feasibility administration anti-CD19 CAR transduce T cell patient CD19+ B-cell malignancy . Secondary objective : To determine treatment regimen result clinical regression B-cell malignancy patient describe . To determine vivo persistency anti-CD19 CAR-transduced T cell .</detailed_description>
