	<detailed_description>The prevalence opioid use disorder pregnancy four per 1000 delivery 2011 increase 5.4 % 2013 . Repeated , acute withdrawal pregnancy recommend may associate intrauterine growth restriction ( IUGR ) preterm labor delivery . The American College Obstetricians Gynecologists ( ACOG ) recommend methadone first line treatment opioid use pregnancy buprenorphine alternative . Methadone therapy use since 1970 's treatment heroin addiction pregnancy efficacy well document . Prescribing methadone barrier , significant drug interaction enrollment register substance abuse treatment program . Emerging evidence support use buprenorphine opioid use disorder pregnancy . Buprenorphine distinct advantage methadone include low risk overdose , few drug interaction , need registration methadone treatment program . However , buprenorphine low rate retention treatment methadone . Opioid use disorder increase risk adverse pregnancy outcome compare woman use opioids.One outcome neonatal abstinence syndrome ( NAS ) affect approximately 55 % 94 % neonate expose addictive medication pregnancy . A 2016 review five trial involve buprenorphine methadone pregnant patient find buprenorphine significantly improve similar outcome methadone neonatal outcome . Buprenorphine expose infant require less treatment NAS ( 20 % -47 % v 45.5 % -57 % , respectively ) experience short duration NAS ( 4.1-5.6 v 5.3-9.9 day , respectively ) compare methadone expose infant . Buprenorphine associate few preterm delivery adverse fetal outcome include rate NAS , medication assistance NAS , total dose morphine use treat NAS . There currently study evaluate level buprenorphine dose rate NAS . Several pharmacokinetic change occur pregnancy impact medication increase risk subtherapeutic level . Subtherapeutic buprenorphine level may increase risk withdrawal symptom craving , may increase risk relapse . The volume distribution increase hydrophilic lipophilic medication throughout pregnancy due increase body fluid , increase adipose tissue , decrease protein binding . Buprenorphine metabolize cytochrome P450 ( CYP450 ) 3A4 , UGT1A1 , 1A3 , 2B7 . Pregnancy increase hepatic metabolism CYP450 3A4 UGT2B7 . Buprenorphine eliminate 70 % feces 30 % urine . Pregnancy increase hepatic renal elimination . Elimination increase partly due increase cardiac output secondary increase plasma volume . Cardiac output reach maximum approximately 32 week , whereas peak renal elimination occur 36 week . These pharmacokinetic change typically require dos increase pregnancy progress . A limitation methadone therapy unpredictable pharmacokinetics pregnancy . Methadone lipophilic highly protein-bound medication , make medication less available pregnancy . It metabolize mainly CYP3A4 , lead decreased concentration methadone plasma pregnancy . One study perform Pond colleague examine methadone serum concentration second third trimester two separate time point post-partum . They find plasma trough methadone concentration low methadone renal clearance high second third trimester post-partum time period , support find methadone require dose increase pregnancy progress . A literature review explore study relate dose monitor methadone pregnancy . This review include study find methadone plasma trough level 0.78 µmol/L require prevent withdrawal . The author review find evidence support methadone pharmacokinetics appear altered pregnancy lack evidence support routine serum monitoring . Although base Drozdick study endorse monitor trough level withdrawal symptoms apparent . Few study evaluate effect pregnancy pharmacokinetics buprenorphine . Based characteristic medication would expect pharmacokinetic change pregnancy would similar methadone . One difference buprenorphine active metabolite may make buprenorphine dose predictable . pharmacokinetics buprenorphine plasma , oral fluid , sweat pregnant woman ( n=9 ) . At 28-29 34 week gestation 2 month postpartum , plasma , oral fluid sweat level collect 24 hour . The maximum concentration total amount buprenorphine norbuprenorphine plasma lower pregnancy compare postpartum level ( buprenorphine Cmax 0.2ng/mL/mg v 1ng/mL/mg Tmax 1.5h*ng/mL/mg v 7h*ng/mL/mg , norbuprenorphine Cmax 3ng/mL/mg v 13ng/mL/mg Tmax change ) . Therefore , significant metabolic change pregnancy immediately postpartum could indicate need dose adjustment buprenorphine . Another small trial nine pregnant woman buprenorphine maintenance therapy assess urinary excretion buprenorphine metabolites every 12 day second trimester 6 week postpartum . The mean ratio urine buprenorphine norbuprenorphine significantly high second trimester compare third trimester patient . Additionally , mean dose buprenorphine increase second third trimester seven nine woman . In subset 3 patient , 24-hour buprenorphine metabolite excretion collect . Buprenorphine level higher pregnancy postpartum three ( 0.8 mg , 5.0 mg , 2.0 mg v 0.55 mg , 4.0 mg , 0.8 mg , respectively ) . The uncorrected buprenorphine urine concentration range 5.5 12.1 µg/L [ mean 7.0 ( 2.8 ) µg/L ] , although evaluate withdrawal symptom occur certain threshold . The buprenorphine dose study flexible , increase decrease make clinical decision base compliance take medication , participant request , urine toxicology , participant self-reports opioid withdrawal symptom crave . Buprenorphine dose positively correlate creatinine-corrected norbuprenorphine ( P &lt; 0.001 , R = 0.197 ) , buprenorphine-glucuronide ( P &lt; 0.002 , R = 0.143 ) , norbuprenorphine-glucuronide ( P &lt; 0.001 , R = 0.182 ) concentration across study . However low correlation coefficient indicate prediction metabolite concentration urine base buprenorphine dose , vice versa , would unreliable . These study support need increase dos buprenorphine throughout pregnancy , may small determine whether relationship buprenorphine urine level dose adjustment exists . Currently , study examine relationship gestational age buprenorphine dose adjustment achieve maintenance dose . This information could assist provider optimize monitoring pregnant woman inform provider regard dose adjustment . Preventing subtherapeutic level may decrease risk withdrawal symptom , crave , risk relapse . No data available evaluate whether particular gestational age require dose adjustment due pregnancy-related pharmacokinetic change . The program obtain quantitative qualitative buprenorphine norbuprenorphine urine level visit . These data use confirm take buprenorphine prescription . No data available determine lower threshold urine buprenorphine metabolite level correlate symptom require dose increase . Additionally , data available evaluate rate NAS , treatment NAS , total dose morphine NAS correlate function maternal dose .</detailed_description>
