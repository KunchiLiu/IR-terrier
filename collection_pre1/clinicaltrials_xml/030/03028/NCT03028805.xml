	<brief_summary>This fully automate randomize trial two randomization branch-points . The first inclusion disease-specific order admission order base predictive model use real-time data . The second use dynamic order end-user test rather static order design committee . The primary hypothesis automatic inclusion disease specific order admission order improve adherence guideline patient COPD . The secondary hypothesis clinical operational outcome improve , thereby improve value .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Study Automated Care Pathway Patients With Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease ( COPD )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This single-center , single-blinded , 2x2 factorial randomize control trial test automate order set inclusion evidence-based order set design end user test order set use clinical outcome adult patient admitted hospital acute exacerbation Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease ( COPD ) . First , investigator develop predictive model identify patient admit hospital COPD exacerbation base retrospective data , limited data available real-time admission . Second , 1,000 admission UCSF Medical Center adult predict COPD predictive algorithm prospectively block randomize encounter automatic inclusion COPD order set admission order usual care . Providers care patient arm trial independently search use COPD order set . Any provider use COPD order set either arm also randomize see two version order set . The first static list order , second dynamic , mean order display appropriate . For example , patient chest x-ray need routine repeat test . The dynamic order set show provider x-ray complete specific time display prompt repeat test . Providers , course , still order anything deem clinically appropriate , may choose order repeat x-ray patient change clinical status . The component order set base international guideline Global Initiative Chronic Lung Disease ( GOLD initiative , collaboration National Heart , Lung , Blood Institute World Health Organization ) multi-stakeholder work group UCSF include two hospitalists , two pulmonologists , two transitional care nurse specialist , one advance practice nurse , one pharmacist , one respiratory therapist , one physical therapist , one nurse .</detailed_description>
