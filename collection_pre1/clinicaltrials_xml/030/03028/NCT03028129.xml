	<detailed_description>Despite know disease mankind 9000 year , tuberculosis ( TB ) still major public health problem develop country , mainly due so-called highly endemic site , prison . It Infectious disease , airborne transmission , TB present active latent form . Despite biological aspect transmission , unhealthy environmental condition ( room without direct sunlight , poor ventilation overcrowd ) individual factor ( malnutrition , immunosuppression , use alcohol drug ) significant influence transferability infectivity . With discovery drug active Mycobacterium tuberculosis , observe reduction disease incidence world . Despite decline incidence , World Health Organization ( WHO ) classify TB public health problem due emergence multidrug strain extensively resistant treatment , add case latent TB reactivation , observed advent HIV/AIDS . Studies show direct relationship incidence TB prison environment . Nevertheless , presence prison one location increase incidence disease , indicate exchange disease prison community . Currently , control TB prison system base track individual active TB / latent , respective treatment . For identification individual active disease , necessary recognition respiratory symptom ( cough mainly ) sputum smear microscopy sputum culture , chest X-ray . As search individual latent form , must carry skin test Purified Protein Derived ( PPD ) . Most unit Brazilian 's prison system diagnostic method available hence transport individual realization necessary , generate additional cost , case , unfeasible process execution . With completion study , seek determine effectiveness primary prophylaxis prison population order gather new scientific evidence , bring affordable method control TB prison . Despite advance diagnosis treatment TB , third lead cause death infectious disease worldwide ( Naghavi et al , 2015 ) . In 2015 , WHO estimate incidence 9.6 million new case TB world , 1.1 million death . For Brazil estimate incidence 44 case per 100,000 ( WHO , 2015 ) . The incidence TB decline 2 % per year , rate homogeneous global context . Brazil occupy 22nd place ranking WHO estimate annual rate 83,310 case disease ( Zumla et al , 2015 ) . In past seven year , estimate incidence decline 0.7 % ( per year ) . A key factor slow progress TB control Brazil , emerge country existence high-risk subpopulation , include slum prison , act reservoir amplifier transmission disease ( Basu ; Stückler ; Mckee 2011 ; Dowdy et al , 2012 ) . A recent systematic review show average incidence TB prison population 23 time record general population ( Baussano et al , 2010 ) . With fourth large prison population world , observed Brazil , increase incidence TB among prisoner last seven year . Although prisoner represent 0.3 % population , increase prison population period result almost double proportion TB case occur among prisoner ( 4.1 % 2007 , 8 , 1 % 2013 ) . The arrest ideal environment spread TB , since show individual user tobacco alcohol high dos , addition drug abuse overcrowd cell poor ventilation limit access care health diagnosis TB . Currently , Ministry Health recommend active search TB entrance prison year chest X-ray . Due cost logistics , prison adhere recommendation . There also clear recommendation use tuberculin skin test perform treatment latent tuberculosis . If procedure active case detection / prophylactic treatment would impact high transmission prison question still remain open ( Al-Darraji ; Kamarulzamn ; Altice , 2012 ) . The concentration case TB prison represent obstacle opportunity control disease , depend effectiveness intervention environment . Preliminary study show high annual rate TB infection ( 26 % ) among prison population 12 penitentiary Mato Grosso Sul . Besides large burden disease population significant dispersion TB prison community ( Sacchi et al , 2015 ) . Cross-sectional study show high yield annual screening TB , however , effectiveness measure combine intervention remain unclear ( Ferreira et al , 1996 ; Fournet et al , 2006 ; Lemos et al , 2014 ; Vieira et al , 2010 ; Sanches et al , 2013 ; Walnut ; Abrahão ; Galesi , 2012 ; Kuhleis et al , 2012 ; Estevan ; Oliveira ; Croda , 2013 ) . Due combination high force infection prison short prison term , primary prophylaxis may effective intervention . This new approach never evaluate context prison low middle income country ; assess impact program strategy TB screen prophylaxis , longitudinal data essential . Given infrastructure create long-term prospective study Brazil , excellent opportunity close critical knowledge gap barrier effective implementation TB control high transmission prison .</detailed_description>
