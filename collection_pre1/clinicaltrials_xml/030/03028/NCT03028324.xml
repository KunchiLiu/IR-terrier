	<brief_title>Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation ( TMS ) Primary Progressive Apraxia Speech ( PPAOS )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Apraxia speech ( AOS ) motor speech disorder affect program motor speech production . It characterize impaired ability coordinate sequential , articulatory movement necessary produce speech sound . It result insult brain , stroke , present sign/symptom another neurodegenerative disease . TMS neurostimulation technique show modulate cortical excitability non-invasive manner , associate positive outcome variety neurological psychological disorders.There evidence support role TMS individual primary progressive aphasia . In addition , case report suggest improvement speech follow TMS individual primary progressive AOS . This study undertaken examine role TMS primary progressive AOS .</detailed_description>
