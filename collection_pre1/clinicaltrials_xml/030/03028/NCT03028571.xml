	<brief_title>Autonomic Blockade Endogenous Glucose Production</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>In study , investigator test null hypothesis change insulin-mediated suppression endogenous glucose production ( EGP ) response autonomic blockade . The investigator measure EGP baseline ( EGPBsl ) last 30 minute hyperinsulinemic euglycemic clamp ( EGPClamp ) two different occasion ( intact Blocked study day ) . A double blinded randomize cross-over design use . Subjects randomize either intact blocked day month later crossed-over arm . The investigator perform analysis also blind treatment receive . At baseline study day expect see difference since subject serve control . During clamp , insulin suppresses EGP . In obese insulin resistant subject suppression blunt . If hypothesis correct , expect improvement suppression insulin EGP autonomic blockade . For study , primary endpoint therefore , EGP clamp intact blocked day . H0= { ( EGPClamp ) Blocked - ( EGPClamp ) Intact } =0 ]</detailed_description>
