	<brief_summary>This study gather real-time ECG data use SHERLOCK 3CG™ Tip Confirmation System ( TCS ) , electrocardiogram ( ECG ) -based peripherally-inserted central catheter ( PICC ) tip confirmation technology . The study promote development software package ( MODUS ) accurately define maximum P-wave ECG waveform . All study participant receive PICCs standard care .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Study Assess Electrocardiogram Waveforms Produced Through Utilization Sherlock 3CG™ Tip Confirmation System</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The SHERLOCK 3CG™ Tip Confirmation System ( TCS ) fully integrate magnetic track ECG-based PICC tip confirmation technology . It clear FDA March 19 , 2012 indicate use alternative chest x-ray fluoroscopy PICC tip placement confirmation adult patient . In order develop SHERLOCK 3CG™ platform simplify PICC placement clinician , Bard Access Systems , Inc. develop software package , MODUS , accurately define maximum p-wave ECG waveform . This software provide visual and/or audio queue notify PICC placer location tip PICC relative cavoatrial junction patient . Subjects require bedside PICC placement standard care meet eligibility criterion enrol . The software package use guidance placement PICC tip . PICCs place per standard care procedure use anthropometric measurement SHERLOCK 3CG™ TCS System . Data placement send back Bard analysis .</detailed_description>
