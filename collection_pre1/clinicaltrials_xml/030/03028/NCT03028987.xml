	<brief_title>Adaptive Immune Responses Repertoire Influenza Vaccination Infection ( SLVP031 )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This study 20 healthy monozygotic ( MZ ) twin ( 10 twin pair ) , 18-49 year old , participant past Stanford-LPCH Vaccine Program trial identify human leukocyte antigen ( HLA ) DR1501+ DR0701+ lab assay result . Volunteers contact assess interest participate study . Both twin pair must willing participate study . All participant randomize within twin pair receive either seasonal live , attenuate influenza vaccine ( LAIV ) seasonal quadrivalent inactivate influenza vaccine ( IIV4 ) . Immunization Day 0 , blood sample immunogenicity assays collect prior immunization Days 7 ( 6-8 ) 28 ( 24-32 ) . This study halt due Advisory Committee Immunization Practices use LAIV .</detailed_description>
