	<brief_summary>Current therapy heart failure ( HF ) bring together strategy improve quality life exercise tolerance , well reduce morbidity mortality . Some HF patient present change musculoskeletal system inspiratory muscle weakness , may restore inspiratory muscle training , thus increase respiratory muscle strength endurance , maximum oxygen consumption ( VO2 ) , functional capacity , respiratory response exercise , quality life . Yoga therapies show improve quality life , inflammatory marker , VO2 peak HF patient , mostly reduce ejection fraction ( HFrEF ) . However , effect different yoga breathe technique patient HF preserve ejection fraction ( HFpEF ) yet assess .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Yôga Breathing Techniques Training Patients With Heart Failure Preserved Ejection Fraction</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Yôga technique without breathe control show improve oxygen consumption patient HF , mostly HFrEF . However , almost half HF patient present HFpEF , less study perform patient . It recently demonstrate HFpEF induces significant molecular , mitochondrial , histological , functional alteration diaphragm soleus , attenuate exercise training . In cardiac disease age , several author show significant reduction heart rate variability ( HRV ) frequency range associate breathing , use spectral analysis heart rate ( HR ) respiration.Therefore , present randomize clinical trial ( RCT ) conduct order test hypothesis program yôga specific breathe technique different ventilatory rhythm could associate improvement inspiratory muscle response , functional capacity , oxygen uptake efficiency slope ( OUES ) , circulatory power , oscillatory ventilation , kinetics oxygen consumption recovery period , distinct feature autonomic nervous system , natriuretic peptide , echocardiographic measurement , quality life ( QoL ) patient HFpEF , without inspiratory muscle weakness ( IMW ) .Therefore , present randomize clinical trial ( RCT ) conduct order test hypothesis 8-week program yôga specific breathe technique different ventilatory rhythm could associate improvement inspiratory muscle response , functional capacity , oxygen uptake efficiency slope ( OUES ) , circulatory power , oscillatory ventilation , kinetics oxygen consumption recovery period , distinct feature autonomic nervous system , natriuretic peptide , echocardiographic measurement , quality life patient HFpEF , without IMW .</detailed_description>
