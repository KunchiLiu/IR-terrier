	<brief_title>Adjacent Segment Mechanics Cervical Arthrodesis Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The etiology adjacent segment pathology follow cervical fusion remain highly controversial . Adjacent segment disease believe result one follow distinct cause : 1. natural history adjacent disc ; 2. disruption adjacent segment anatomy due initial surgery ; 3. biomechanical stress adjacent level follow fusion . The long-term goal research reduce prevent symptomatic adjacent segment degeneration spine . The overall hypothesis study adjacent segment kinematics ( i.e . translation , rotation , helical axis motion ) arthrokinematics ( i.e . disc deformation facet joint surface interaction ) ACDF determine primarily patient-specific anatomy iatrogenic factor , increase biomechanical stress due fusion . A prospective longitudinal study propose determine extent patient-specific factor ( Specific Aim 1 ) , iatrogenic factor ( Specific Aim 2 ) , alter biomechanics ( Specific Aim 3 ) affect dynamic cervical spine function follow fusion . Participants C56 ( n=22 ) C67 ( n=22 ) single-level fusion patient , C456 ( n=22 ) C567 ( n=22 ) two-level fusion patient , asymptomatic control similar age fusion patient ( n=22 ) . Patients test prior surgery , one year post-surgery , three year post-surgery . At test , participant complete clinical questionnaire assess pain function , perform full range motion flexion\extension axial rotation head cervical spine biplane radiograph record 30 image per second . A highly accurate validate volumetric model-based track process custom data analysis software utilized determine intervertebral kinematics ( i.e . translation , rotation , helical axis motion ) arthrokinematics ( i.e . disc deformation facet joint surface interaction ) test session . This prospective study identify factor great effect adjacent segment mechanic cervical fusion . If hypothesis confirm , provide support increase attention patient-specific factor surgical technique . Alternatively , result indicate adjacent segment mechanic influence primarily increase stress arthrodesis , provide support increase attention design motion-sparing device .</detailed_description>
