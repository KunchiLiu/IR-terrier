	<brief_title>Implementation Fast-track Surgery Program Total Hip Knee Replacement Evaluation Risks Benefits Patient</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The primary goal study evaluate risk possible implementation project total knee ( TKR ) hip ( THR ) replacement fast track setting . The specific feature study introduce intervention modality care rapidly minimize prevent know complication associate THR TKR . Following total hip replacement ( THR ) , length stay usually 1 3 day 3 5 day total knee replacement ( TKR ) . The investigator develop new protocol intensive care give possibility return home le 24 hour want evaluate feasibility security protocol . To evaluate security feasibility protocol investigator want recruit 150 participant agree enroll study.The investigator evaluate variable ; number complication occur within 12 month fallowing surgery , number readmission post-surgery , pain control efficiency , number blood transfusion need , length wound spread , patient satisfaction cost program implementation . The investigator want identify success failure factor optimise program afterwards . In order achieve evaluation , investigator compare data obtain 150 patient data retrieve medical file patient already usual intervention past , standard length stay .</detailed_description>
