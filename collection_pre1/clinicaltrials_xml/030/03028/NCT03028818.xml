	<brief_title>Fever Observational Study</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Fever ( high temperature ) normal bodily response infection , show beneficial effect human chickenpox , malaria rhinovirus infection . In child recommend National Institute Health Care Excellence cool child use drug physical method cool mat , sole aim reduce child 's temperature . However , recommendation aim management critically ill child , uncertainty around use cooling intervention consider advantage fever defend body virus bacteria critical illness , weigh possible negative physiological consequence high fever e.g . increase metabolic rate . Observational study show treatment fever critically ill child inconsistent . There lack robust data guide antipyretic intervention , clinician usually start fever management around 37.5Â°C . Evidence emerge fever may beneficial critically ill adult . Due physiological difference adult child important need evaluate whether different approach fever management critically ill child may also beneficial . Prior conduct large , expensive , randomise clinical trial ( RCT ) evaluate whether high temperature threshold start treatment cool child would beneficial , conduct three study know possible u test key outcome measure result test different temperature thresholds antipyretic management . The Fever Observational Study one study , aim identifying : potential population would eligible propose definitive trial , current temperature threshold ( ) fever management , describe characteristic outcome measure intention decide main measure see treatment method successful .</detailed_description>
