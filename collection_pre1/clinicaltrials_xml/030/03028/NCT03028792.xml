	<detailed_description>The main aim pilot study examine feasibility , tolerability , acceptability computerized attention training program child clinically elevate anxiety . Youth rural Latino community , significant anxiety symptom ( N = 52 ) randomize active attention bias modification program ( AMP ) four week attention control condition ( nonactive ) four week . Families assess baseline , mistreatment , post-treatment 3 month followup . AMP responder determine reduction self-report measure anxiety clinician administer assessment . Community health worker ( promotoras ) train administer program youth . Data gather examine feasibility , tolerability , acceptability type treatment mode service delivery . It hypothesize AMP feasible , tolerable , acceptable underserved community sample ethnic minority youth . Study Design : Following ascertainment study eligibility completion baseline assessment , youth assign four week AMP ACC ( attention control condition ) . All youngster family undergo comprehensive baseline assessment reassess mistreatment , treatment endpoint ( week 4 ) 3 month followup . Screening : Youth recruit various mechanism . 1 . Flyers post primary care clinic Imperial Valley Los Angeles County . Clinicas de Salud del Pueblo private , non-profit corporation provide primary care service throughout Imperial County . Flyers post 10 primary care clinic , locate Imperial County . 2 . The second method recruit subject physician referral provider within primary care system . Prior study start , pediatricians/providers receive information study , symptom child anxiety , use short screening measure assist detect child anxiety . If provider one clinic identifies child anxiety parent report child symptom consistent anxiety ( fear , worry , nervousness , unexplained somatic complaint , etc . ) , provider option explain study parent give study brochure . Alternatively , provider , able , also ask parent sign consent contact form , give research team permission contact directly discuss study . 3 . Providers may also choose refer patient study promotora assist explain study participant , screening , consent participant . 4 . Flyers also post Sun Valley Behavioral Medical Center , private medical clinic serve medical mental health need child , adolescent adults Imperial County . In case , parent expect call research team information . 5 . The co-PI study , Dr. Denise Chavira ongoing school base study conduct high school student Imperial Valley . Given study cover range age ( 8-17 ) , also recruit high school . As part exist consent form ( protocol 14-000663 ) , student ask check box interested participate future research study . We contact student indicated interest future study discuss current project . In method , community health worker/promotora/e contact parent conduct initial screen . Thereafter promotora and/or research coordinator arrange person meeting parent youth review consent parent assent form youth administer eligibility measure . The initial eligibility assessment conduct consent/assent form sign return research team . At end eligibility visit , PIs ( Chavira Chang ) review questionnaire determine final eligibility . Those eligible process baseline visit receive AMP ACC program well measure . We include table measure well assessment schedule 10.1 section 1.0 . Attention Modification Program : AMP modify version dot-probe paradigm similar original task use MacLeod , Mathews , Tata . Each trial begin fixation cross present center computer screen 500 m . The cross replace pair face present center screen 500 m . The face pair disappear probe ( i.e. , letter `` E '' `` F '' ) appear immediately location one two face . Participants instruct decide whether letter E F press correspond mouse button . The letter probe remain screen participant responds . Response latencies identify probe record onset presentation letter probe button press . A total 288 training trial deliver session . This paradigm modify facilitate attention bias away threaten material . In case , probe always replace neutral face . Thus , although specific instruction direct attention away threatening face , trial , position neutral face indicate position probe . Attention Control Condition : Like AMP , attention control condition dot-probe task begin fixation cross present computer screen 500ms , follow pair face ( one neutral , one threatening ) 500ms , trial complete face pair disappear probe ( letter `` E '' `` F '' ) appear location one two face . Participants instruct decide whether letter E F press correspond mouse button . The letter probe remain screen participant responds . Response latencies identify probe record onset presentation letter probe button press . A total 288 training trial deliver session . However , case , probe replaces neutral threat face 50 % time . Assessment . All parent child enrol study complete assessment baseline , mid-treatment , post-treatment 3 month followup . Assessments focus feasibility outcomes clinical outcome measure . Further , measure moderate factor include order well understand variable ( e.g. , poverty , attention control , acculturation ) may suggest trend differential treatment response within two condition .</detailed_description>
