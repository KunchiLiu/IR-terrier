	<brief_summary>The PreTBI II study aim investigate diagnostic potential prehospital S100B GFAP measurement prediction need neurosurgical observation and/or intervention moderate TBI patient , rule-in high-risk patient . Ultimately select patient benefit neuro surgical expertise specialize department thereby possibly well patient outcome . Hopefully also minimize treatment delay , secure optimal resource consumption streamline patient course predict presence neurotrauma . Hypotheses : 1 . A prehospital serum S100B level &gt; 10 microgram g/L expectedly certain currently unknown cut-off value indicate need neurosurgical observation and/or intervention moderate TBI patient . 2 . A prehospital serum GFAP level certain currently unknown cut-off value significantly predict need urgent neurosurgical observation and/or intervention moderate TBI patient . 3 . Biomarker dynamic prehospital in-hospital biomarker value S100B GFAP significantly predict need urgent neurosurgical observation and/or intervention . 4 . Biomarker dynamic prehospital in-hospital biomarker value S100B GFAP significantly predict hospital course outcome patient moderate TBI .</brief_summary>
