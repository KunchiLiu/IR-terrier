	<brief_title>WEE1 Inhibitor With Cisplatin Radiotherapy : A Trial Head Neck Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Patients head neck cancer high-risk feature increase risk relapse surgery . Surgery , often follow cisplatin chemotherapy radiotherapy currently standard treatment offer . Whilst chemo-radiotherapy improves cure rate , outcomes remain poor , treatment significant impact quality life . Chemotherapy yet find definitive role prior surgery . There therefore urgent need develop effective treatment improve cure rate patient population . The purpose trial see whether incorporate drug call AZD1775 management head neck cancer offer possibility address clinical issue . AZD1775 drug show increase effect cisplatin radiotherapy test laboratory . The blood sample tumour biopsy take trial important learning much possible effect AZD1775 body investigate tumour might develop resistance drug . The WISTERIA trial patient age 18 70 year cancer oral cavity , larynx hypopharynx undergo surgery . Patients recruit Group A must accessible tumours re-biopsy , whilst patient recruit Group B high risk relapse surgery . The primary objective trial see dose AZD1775 safely give combination cisplatin surgery ( Group A ) chemo-radiotherapy surgery ( Group B ) . The Investigators also get preliminary information regard effectiveness combine treatment . To find safe effective dose AZD1775 , different dos test Group .</detailed_description>
