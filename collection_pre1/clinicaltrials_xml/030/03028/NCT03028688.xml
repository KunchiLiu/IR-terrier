	<brief_summary>Millions patient undergo upper GI endoscopy United States year . A large number patient anesthesia assist comfort procedure . The majority patient protect airway procedure , mean endotracheal tube . Instead current standard care give supplementary oxygen via nasal cannula . Because patient deeply sedate general anesthesia risk low oxygen saturation procedure , present significant patient safety issue . The purpose clinical trial compare current anesthesia standard care high flow nasal cannula oxygen delivery anesthesia . The investigator 's hypothesis high flow nasal cannula oxygen delivery decrease frequency patient experience hypoxemia anesthesia upper GI endoscopy .</brief_summary>
