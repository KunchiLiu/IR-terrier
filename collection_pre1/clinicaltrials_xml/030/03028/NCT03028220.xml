	<brief_summary>Good glucose control type 1 diabetes associate reduced risk diabetes complication self monitor glucose level important component achieve maintain glucose control . Continuous glucose monitoring ( CGM ) improve overall glucose control age group use continuously , reduces incidence low blood glucose ( hypoglycaemia ) people good glucose control . Hypoglycaemia one common metabolic complication type 1 diabetes , occur frequently , people become less aware . This reduce aware hypoglycaemia significant risk include seizure , coma even death , impact people 's ability drive function . The Abbott Libre intermittent glucose monitoring system provide 8 hour retrospective continuous glucose monitoring data user monitor waved proximity sensor . In contrast realtime CGM Libre system sensor use 14 day non-adjunctive ( require calibration capillary blood glucose ) . This clinical study propose assess impact Libre frequency , duration severity hypoglycaemia , compare Dexcom G5 realtime CGM focus people impaired awareness hypoglycaemia .</brief_summary>
