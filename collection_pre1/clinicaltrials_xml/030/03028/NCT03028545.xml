It fact gradually lead emergence complementary model capable enrich understanding determinant future people affect severe psychiatric disorder , particular model invite separate `` become person '' `` psychiatric disorder `` take account '' personal role person `` healing .

The subject engages long , progressive process , without return previous state . In dynamic response equilibrium perturb disease , interested restore new equilibrium rather factor trigger loss . Recovery see trajectory punctuate decisive moment background progressive change , process oscillates awareness , ambivalence forward shift . However , study point number crucial dimension involve recovery severe psychiatric disorder , one important limitation study distance psychopathological consideration , thus set aside possibility specific process recovery depend pathology . The identification recurrent experiential logic specific various psychiatric disorder therefore appear important field investigation . It would potentially able guide development new therapeutic device base recovery model .</brief_summary>
