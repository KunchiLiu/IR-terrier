	<brief_summary>Colorectal Cancer ( CRC ) third common cancer fourth common cause cancer-related death worldwide . CRC frequently give rise transcoelomic spread tumor cell peritoneal cavity , ultimately lead Peritoneal Carcinomatosis ( PC ) . A new loco-regional treatment modality combine Cytoreductive Surgery ( CRS ) Hyperthermic Intraperitoneal Peroperative Chemotherapy ( HIPEC ) . The current HIPEC dosing regimen treatment colorectal PC divide body surface area ( BSA ) -based protocols concentration-based protocol . Most group currently use drug dose base calculate BSA ( mg/m2 ) analogy systemic chemotherapy regimen . These regimen take BSA measure effective contact area , represent peritoneal surface formula dose intensification . However , imperfect correlation exist actual peritoneal surface area calculate BSA . Sex difference , also alter pathophysiological characteristic frequent complication patient ( ascites ) responsible difference peritoneal surface area , turn affect absorption characteristic . This take u away initial homogenous drug concentration desire , increase variability systemic tumor exposure drug . Pharmacokinetic change induce volume chemotherapy solution constant drug dose , administer intraperitoneally , already report . This result less precise prediction toxicity associate treatment . By contrast , group use totally different dosimetry regimen base concentration . From pharmacologic point view , big advantage concentration-based system residual tumor nodule CRS expose constant diffusional force , thus , cytotoxicity . Unfortunately prize pay good prediction efficacy IP chemotherapy high unpredictability level plasmatic cancer chemotherapy , thus , toxicity . This randomise non-blinded phase III clinical trial first trial pharmacologically evaluate two dose regimen , BSA-based concentration-based , applied standard care current practice .</brief_summary>
