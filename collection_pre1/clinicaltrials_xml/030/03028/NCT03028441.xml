Two dosage level ( 5 x 10^4 5 x 10^5 TCID50 ) 3 immunization schedule ( day 1 29 , day 1 85 day 1 169 ) evaluate . The study 6 cohort , 30 subject , 25 receive study vaccine 5 receive placebo . Cohorts 1-3 receive low dosage lyophilize vaccine product ( 5 x 10^4 TCID50 ) cohorts 4-6 receive high dosage ( 5 x 10^5 TCID50 ) lyophilize vaccine product . Each subject receive two study injection use one three dose schedule outline . This study enroll 180 healthy subject age 18 45 year ( inclusive ) . Subjects counsel study sign inform consent prior study procedure . Screening perform include evaluation medical history , travel history country know CHIKV circulation , medication history , physical examination safety laboratory evaluation .
