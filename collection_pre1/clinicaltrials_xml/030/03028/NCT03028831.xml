	<brief_summary>Alaska native people ( AN ) high record incidence death rate colon cancer world ( &gt; 90:100,000 ) . We hypothesize AN , despite high consumption anti-inflammatory antineoplastic n-3 fish oil , increase risk colon cancer colonic butyrate deficiency result remarkably low consumption fiber-containing food . We hypothesize fiber supplementation usual diet result bloom butyrate produce microbe colon , result increased butyrate production , suppress high microbial secondary bile acid production , antagonize action food ( smoked fish ) environmental carcinogen ( tobacco , alcohol ) , interact high circulating level n-3 fish oil suppress colonic inflammation cancer risk . In order investigate , conduct randomize double-blinded 4-week clinical trial 100 randomizable healthy , middle-aged AN undergoing screening colonoscopy , objective obtain 60 complete intervention . The intervention consist either high-dose soluble fiber supplement give drink , together usual diet currently contain 15g total fiber/d , control digestible starch drink plus usual diet . The primary endpoint clinically significant reduction Ki67 proliferative colonic mucosal biomarkers cancer risk . Microbiome metabolome mechanism responsible anticipated change mucosal biomarkers also investigate . Our result extreme risk AN evaluated comparison similar measurement previously make minimal risk rural Africans intermediate risk African Americans . Our result use provide scientific basis definitive large-scale high-fiber supplementation study ( achieve &gt; 50g total fiber/d ) suppress adenomatous polyp recurrence follow colonoscopy .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Randomization double blind , placebo control , clinical trial : Recruitment continue 60 volunteer complete intervention study . Based previous experience similar study , anticipate 20 % screen patient ineligible drop , mean , plan consent screen approximately 100 potential participant . Baseline data participant retain . Individuals randomize via minimisation ( base age , sex , polypectomy , high fish consumption , BMI - factor might influence microbiota composition function ) ) either resistant starch ( RS ) group control digestible starch ( DS ) group upon completion Stabilization Period . 1 . RS Group : Participants continue usual diet plus fiber supplement give daily dose 70g high-amylose maize starch ( HAM-RS , HI-MAIZE®260 : Ingredion Incorporated , Bridgewater , NJ ) , contain 42g type 2 resistant starch , 4 week . Data previous study [ 69 ] suggests usual diet contain approximately 13g dietary fiber/day , chiefly insoluble , indicate total fiber intake would approx . 55g/d . Supplements pre-weighed batch source keep airtight container . The supplement may take single divide dose dissolve 250ml water , low fat milk , orange juice 2 . DS ( Control ) Group participant continue usual diet , plus 70g fully digestible starch ( waxy corn starch comprise amylopectin , AMIOCA® corn starch , Ingredion Incorporated , Bridgewater , NJ ) weigh , analyze , prepare previously . The RS control supplement appear taste similar , allow cod distribution double-blind fashion . The supplement equicaloric . Interventions include fecal colonic content sample measurement microbiome metabolome , flexible sigmoidoscopy obtain mucosal biopsy dietary supplementation . Monitoring During Clinical Trial : This follow scheme lay Figure 7 . On day 0 , participant visit clinic asked save first fecal sample use standard operating procedure develop proven effective last study . They give first supplement drink make vehicle choice , take standard meal provide diet kitchen . During trial , instruct use simple diary complete home . This record major food item consume day , time completion drink supplement , well bowel function questionnaire assess daily GI tolerance , i.e . abdominal discomfort , distension , gas , bowel frequency , nausea , vomit . They ask return clinic follow-up appointment day 7 , 14 21 order repeat fecal breath test describe . At time , body weight monitor use one scale . At end 4 week , participant ask return clinic repeat colonic sampling perform baseline .</detailed_description>
