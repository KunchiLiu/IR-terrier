	<detailed_description>Poor self-regulation ( i.e. , inability harness cognitive , emotional motivational resource achieve goal ) contribute number unhealthy behavior across life course , include overeating , lack physical activity , smoking , alcoholism substance abuse link poor long-term health . The self-regulation process generate desire substance make difficult engage healthy habit theorize begin early lifespan . Targeting early self-regulation profile signal risk engage unhealthy behavior would allow effective intervention . The investigator ass self-regulation pre-adolescence , critical transition child gain responsibility manage health choice self-regulation become increasingly associate health outcome . Obesity complex health issue early-emerging biological behavioral precursor related self-regulation ; good model understand broad range health condition require active self-management . Childhood obesity also ongoing public health crisis , almost 25 % child overweight age 4 year ( 35 % school-age ) . The goal study measure childhood self-regulation target know associated obesity risk poor adherence medical regimen ass whether intervene mechanism improve self-regulation . The investigator cohort child high rate obesity extensively phenotyped bio-behavioral self-regulation obesity risk factor early childhood . The aim , low-income school-age child extant cohort , develop field-test intervention design address self-regulation target use Multiphase Optimization Strategy ( MOST ) design detect intervention effectiveness child family factor ( e.g. , maternal education , family stress , early childhood eat stress regulation pattern ) may moderate intervention effect . The investigator hypothesize intervention cause change self-regulation target closely relate intervention component ( e.g. , EF-focused intervention change EF target ) .</detailed_description>
