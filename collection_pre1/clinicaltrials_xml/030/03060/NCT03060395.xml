	<brief_title>Effects A2 Milk Gastrointestinal Function Non-lactose Milk Intolerance</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Non-lactose milk intolerance condition define clinically yet current literature report existence subject moderately milk intolerant whose intolerance neither attribute defect lactose intolerance , milk protein allergy . Yet , experience least one two follow symptom follow milk consumption : gas , bloating , abdominal cramp . It known A1gene variant cod beta-casein lead production bioactive peptide opioid activity name betacasomorphin 7 ( BCM7 ) . This peptide associate several metabolic health disorder include diabetes , elevate cardiovascular risk stimulation pro-inflammatory signal . Recently , report non-lactose milk intolerant subject experience symptom consume milk contain non-mutated A2 gene variant cod beta-casein . In study , hypothesise consumption A2 milk improve gastrointestinal symptom non-lactose milk intolerant individual . The primary outcome study reduction gastrointestinal inflammation follow course A2 milk consumption .</detailed_description>
