	<brief_summary>General anesthesia affect tissue oxygen saturation microcirculatory reactivity . However , difference microcirculation cause anesthetic method well study . Near-infrared spectroscopy ( NIRS ) measure peripheral tissue oxygen saturation noninvasively use conjunction vascular occlusion ( VOT ) experiment . The purpose study examine change NIRS derive tissue oxygen saturation ( StO2 ) microcirculatory reactivity VOT inhalation anesthesia healthy population . This prospective , observational study perform 57 healthy patient undergone elective surgery volatile general anesthesia . The investigator measure StO2 microvascular reactivity use NIRS combine vascular occlusion test ( VOT ) . The parameter perform twice per patient , induction anesthesia . Occlusion slope recovery slope VOT compare anesthesia . Moreover , change depend age analyze .</brief_summary>
