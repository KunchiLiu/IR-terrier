Major assessment baseline , post-treatment , follow-up 12 week later . Participants randomize PI WL trial arm offer access online app upon completion study . Participants blind hypothesis nature placebo intervention , inform 1 3 chance assign placebo intervention . Participant timeline Potential participant assess eligibility initial assessment depressive symptom . The initial assessment phase consist administration Patient Health Questionnaire-9 ( PHQ-9 ) short screen telephone interview . Applicants meet inclusion criterion inform via e-mail . They give summary score interpretation PHQ-9 score encourage discus problem professional , necessary . Information reach one - clinical psychologist psychotherapist - also provide . Subsequent assessment consist instrument present Outcome measure section . After initial assessment , participant meet inclusion criterion randomly assign one three condition : active intervention condition ( Group 1 ) , placebo intervention ( Group 2 ) , delayed-intervention condition ( wait-list ) ( Group 3 ) . The participant active intervention active placebo condition assess pre-intervention ( Time 1 - baseline ) , mid-intervention ( Time 2 - 3 week baseline ) , post-intervention ( Time 3 - 6 week baseline ) , 3-months post-intervention ( Time 4 ) . The participant delayed-intervention condition assess wait period ( Time 1 - baseline ) , mid-waiting period ( Time 2 - 3 week baseline ) , post-waiting period ( Time 3 - 6 week baseline ) . Participants assign active intervention condition give access online application along explicit instruction regard use section . Participants give 6 week complete intervention , time weekly message send . Messages include regular assignment design complete thorough use application 's course exercise , encourage review material whenever possible . However , participant free use application pace . Similarly , participant active placebo condition give give access sham version app . During 6-week intervention period expose amount online ( i.e. , app message ) therapist communication active intervention participant .

Based fact current protocol therapist check-in component , sample size recruitment target n = 220 set allow sample attrition , thus estimate drop-out rate approximately 30 % . Recruitment Possible participant approach ad social network . Those interested use application ask access study 's website follow standard recruitment procedure . They subsequently contact via telephone call , point enrollment procedure describe . Assignment study group The participant randomly assign one three trial arm , use software Randomizer.org . Randomization perform research assistant use simple ( unrestricted ) randomization sequence assigns three unique number per participant ; number assign either 1 , 2 , 3 accord number experimental condition . To conceal allocation mechanism , research assistant monitor assessment allow access application participant waitlist control group , 6 week . The principal investigator statistician run data analysis remain blinded study condition completion study . Monitoring study implementation . Three clinical psychologist , member study team , screen risk unintended effect harm participant ( i.e. , clinically significant increase depressive symptomatology , measure CESD-R ) . The psychologist also monitor weekly online evaluation clinically interpret CESD-R score every participant . If participant complete CESD-R evaluation , telephonic contact follow . If necessary , supervisor decide interrupt participant 's access application make referral .</detailed_description>
