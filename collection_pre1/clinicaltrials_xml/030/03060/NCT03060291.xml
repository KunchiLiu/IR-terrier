The consultant work parent enhance relevant parent family management skill . Despite demonstrated effectiveness intervention , school resource staff implement without substantial support . It seem , , school would benefit online package require few school resource implement . The FCU-Online design incorporate successful component original FCU reduce burden school . And , accessed online , parent utilize resource time location convenient . In study , 300 family randomly assign one three condition : web/ mobile-only version FCU , web/mobile + coach version , middle school usual . Research mental health intervention deliver internet suggests coach `` in-person '' contact enhance outcomes . However , program require coach in-person contact cheap easy school deliver . Therefore , web/ mobile-only version may allow school deliver intervention great number family child .

	<brief_title>Prevention Substance Use At-Risk Students : A Family-Centered Web Program</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>School-based , family-centered intervention reduce substance use adolescence show highly effective result reduction problem behavior , achievement problem , depression , substance use time . Although intervention show effective efficacy trial across United States , school resource implement intervention without substantial support . Barriers low staffing , poorly trained staff , limited resource prevent successful uptake family-centered intervention school , yet school system supportive enhance family-school partnership . Because school system lack necessary infrastructure resource deliver intervention , would benefit online package evidence base accessible parent . However , family-centered , web-based intervention substance use prevention exist Internet , derive empirically base program . To address gap , project investigator develop test efficacy online version Family Check-Up ( FCU ) school parent use either school home . The FCU school-based , model-driven intervention develop past 20 year iteratively revise basis multiple intervention trial diverse population . This study build upon investigator ' successful program research develop test efficacy The FCU-Online . It design incorporate successful component original FCU , strengths-based assessment norm reference , feedback use motivational interviewing , follow-up module focus enhance parent skill family management early adolescence . This research design randomly assign 300 family receive middle school usual , FCU-Online web/mobile , FCU-Online web/mobile+coach version . Research delivery mental health intervention via Internet suggest coach `` person '' contact enhance outcomes ; however , program require coach in-person contact may large public health impact . A coach version intervention compare online-only version require staff school . Project investigator test efficacy online version respect change key parent construct , positive parenting parental monitoring . It predict change parent lead reduction risk behavior , problem behavior school substance use . This research significantly contribute researcher ' understand effective intervention adolescent reduce risk behavior substance use transition high school , significantly contribute overall uptake dissemination family-centered intervention school . Specific aim study follow : Aim 1 : Design evaluate web-based FCU intervention at-risk family early adolescent ( age 11-14 ) guide feedback focus group target know risk factor later substance use . The program feature online assessment feedback caretaker deliver via either phone Internet . An intervention website application mobile message support delivery program module help motivate facilitate tracking activity . Examples present potential user , include parent school personnel , assess feasibility usability . A 6-month pilot study test recruitment , assessment , intervention procedure . Aim 2 : Examine efficacy FCU-Online intervention conduct randomize , control trial 300 at-risk middle school youth . Research suggest live coach enhances outcomes associate web-based intervention ; however , web-based intervention require coach widely disseminate great potential large public health impact . The investigator propose examine outcomes associate web/mobile+coach version web/mobile-only version FCU . Families randomly assign FCU-Online intervention ( 100 web/mobile+coach , 100 web/mobile ) middle school usual ( n = 100 ) . Aim 2.1 . Evaluate main effect version FCU-Online , include academic achievement , behavioral control , family cohesiveness , delay onset substance use . Aim 2.2 . Test developmental , mediational model parent skill behavior mediate change youth behavior time . It expect family receive FCU show reduction growth youth ' risk behavior , compare control group . Reductions mediate positive change parent behavior parent skill development . Aim 2.3 . Examine moderator , include gender , ethnicity , socioeconomic status , model intervention effect test moderator time . The investigator assess feasibility FCU Internet-delivered intervention middle school , extent participant engage intervention complete program , satisfaction program , effect FCU improve parent skill , positive youth adjustment , reduction youth problem behavior 2 year . Aim 2.4 . Examine factor relate successful uptake implementation intervention school . The public health impact Internet intervention diminish uptake intervention poor . To understand factor related implementation school , school personnel train end project delivery FCU-Online intervention . The investigator assess feasibility , usage , coach fidelity , uptake engagement data collect via website . Data teacher school administrator collect examine factor promote implementation school researcher ' understand intervention apply real-world setting .</detailed_description>
