	<brief_summary>This prospective study randomize 1:1 people live multiple sclerosis-associated fatigue one two spectra light therapy . Each participant ask use light box twice daily home workplace preset hour day total four week . Participants ask record fatigue standard measurement scale , , use light therapy box . The investigator anticipate reduction self-reported fatigue follow use light box therapy particular spectrum light among people live multiple sclerosis .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Study Protocol : Eligible participant consent randomized 1:1 ( ) white LT ( 10,000 lux ) , ( b ) dim red LT ( &lt; 300 lux ) . Participants inform study examine effect two different light spectrum fatigue . The following assessment administer study principal investigator baseline visit : ( 1 ) Kurtzke Extended Disability Status Scale ( EDSS ) , ( 2 ) FSS , ( 3 ) Beck Depression Inventory II ( BDI ) , ( 4 ) Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index ( PSQI ) , ( 5 ) Berlin questionnaire obstructive sleep apnea , ( 6 ) Epworth Sleepiness Scale . A two-week sleep diary collect enrollment order screen significant behavioral insufficient sleep circadian rhythm disorder . The light box use LT design stand desk tabletop . It use home office . The light deliver downward angle maximize effectiveness . The box run 124 watt contains full spectrum 5000k 10,000 lux bulb . Bright light treatment require least 2,500 lux effective . Data Collection : The study period include two-week baseline period , four-week treatment period , four-week follow period . Throughout study period , participant record fatigue use Visual Analogue Fatigue Scale ( VAFS ) four time daily , start waking , every four hour thereafter . The VAFS simple , validate 10-point scale range 1 10 participant report fatigue snapshot particular moment . Data collection occur participant self-report fashion . A FSS score collect enrollment well end four week treatment period end four week follow-up period . There three visit principal investigator ( PI ) , include baseline visit describe , visit PI end treatment period participant report FSS discus experience LT , third follow-up visit end four-week follow period final FSS . At last visit query whether believe intervention effect fatigue whether believe alternative therapy ( white light dim red light ) would less beneficial . Additionally participant ask keep LT log record daily LT exposure associate side effect . Statistical Analysis : The primary outcome measure change average FSS four-week study period bright light `` active '' vs. dim light `` control '' group . There report FSS response bright LT pMS . Using conventional value α=0.05 β=0.80 2-tailed test probability equally sized group : difference 10 point FSS group require 18 people per study arm ; difference 8 point require 28 people per group . If power reduce 70 % , sample size 22 14 8-point 10-point difference . First , investigator compare mean change FSS score , baseline completion LT , intention treat analysis . The secondary outcome measure change global VAFS score light therapy group . Frequencies use describe baseline characteristic across treatment arm . X2 statistic Fisher 's exact test use compare difference group . VAFS evaluate use mixed-effects model account correlation repeat measurement . Participant logbooks use generate summary statistic graphically display fatigue pattern throughout day . Logbooks also qualitatively assess safety tolerability LT .</detailed_description>
