	<brief_summary>The FDA recently gain authority regulate nicotine content cigarette . Prior research suggest smoker switch low nicotine content ( VLNC ) cigarettes experience reduce addiction nicotine likely quit smoking . Currently , common method smoker reduce nicotine intake reduce number cigarette per day ( CPD ) . No research compare reduce smoker ' nicotine intake switch VLNC cigarette vs reduce CPD regard decrease dependence quitting ; thus investigator examine two strategy randomize smoker 1 ) switch VLNC cigarettes 2 ) reduce CPD . In addition , smoker use nicotine patch help reduce nicotine intake .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Switching Very Low Nicotine Content Cigarettes v Reducing Cigarettes Per Day</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Primary : 1 . Determine relative feasibility switch VLNC cigarette vs reduce CPD participant aid nicotine replacement therapy ( NRT ) . 2 . Determine whether switch VLNC cigarette reduce CPD effectively reduce nicotine dependence participant aid NRT . Secondary : 3 . Determine whether switch VLNC cigarette vs reduce CPD increase quit attempts 7-day point-prevalence abstinence participant aid NRT . 4 . Determine relative effectiveness switch VLNC cigarette reduce CPD participant aid NRT comparison ) craving , b ) withdrawal , c ) perceive harm smoking ) participant ' enjoyment smoking . 5 . Determine whether switch VLNC cigarette reduce CPD increase use e-cigarettes non-combustible nicotine product . Rationale Proposed Study : A policy reduce nicotine content cigarette could useful majority smoker ready quit . Specifically , FDA recently gain authority regulate cigarette ' nicotine content switch low nicotine content ( VLNC ) cigarette propose future regulatory policy give smoker option decrease nicotine intake cigarette order decrease nicotine dependence quit smoking . A review clinical trial suggest switch VLNC cigarette without nicotine replacement therapy ( NRT ) reduce dependence , carcinogen , carbon monoxide increase quit ; however , long-term effect unclear . Nicotine dependence determine nicotine intake ( i.e. , yield ) well non-nicotine reinforcer condition repetitive act smoking ( i.e. , multiple cigarette per day ) . Presently , reduce cigarette per day ( CPD ) common strategy reduce nicotine intake appear effective method reduce dependence . However , regulatory policy introduces VLNC cigarette provide smoker opportunity reduce nicotine intake without change frequency smoke behavior ( i.e. , CPD ) . Thus , reduce nicotine switch VLNC cigarette may affect conditioned reinforcer dependence differently reduce nicotine intake via reduce CPD . The investigator know research compare regulatory policy reduce nicotine intake via VLNC cigarettes vs common method reduce nicotine intake via reduce CPD . This comparison provide important information regard component involve change nicotine dependence potential effect policy regulate nicotine content cigarette . NRT appear increase feasibility effectiveness switch VLNC cigarette well reduce full nicotine CPD . In scenario , NRT facilitate net reduction nicotine . Further , NRT currently available smoker reduce CPD , available smoker cigarette ' nicotine level reduce FDA , likely use aid . The present study compare participant switch VLNC cigarette vs participant reduce CPD participant receive NRT patch . Specifically comparison examine difference feasibility effectiveness reduce nicotine dependence . Study Design : Consenting participant randomly assign 1 ) switch VLNC cigarettes NRT 2 ) reduce full nicotine CPD NRT 5-week study period . All participant complete baseline measure receive full nicotine VLNC study cigarette well weekly supply 21-mg nicotine patch instruction replace old patch new patch morning . During first study visit , investigator provide participant one-week supply full nicotine study cigarette ( 16.5 ± 0.17 mg/g ) total 150 % normal number CPD order establish baseline CPD novel study cigarette provide free charge . The 16.5 mg/g nicotine content NIDA research cigarette estimate nicotine yield ( 0.8 mg ) similar many commercial cigarette . Participants instruct smoke study cigarette , smoke usual first week study . All study cigarettes investigational purpose available intended commercial use . Switching VLNC cigarettes Participants randomize switch VLNC cigarettes receive supply 100 % baseline number CPD study visit ( determine week 1 ) throughout week 2 5 instructed smoke usual ( e.g. , attempt reduce CPD ) . They receive study cigarette progressively low nicotine content ( mg/g tobacco ) begin 11.26 ± 0.11 mg/g week 2 , 5.54 ± 0.27 mg/g week 3 , 2.54 ± 0.05 mg/g week 4 , 0.44 ± 0.01 mg/g week 5 . Participants also receive supply NRT patch instruction wear one patch per day every day throughout week 2 5 . This schedule select base available VLNC cigarette finding indicate gradual transition cigarette nicotine content approximately 1 mg/g less NRT patch safe , effective feasible . The investigator estimate NRT use compliance VLNC study cigarette daily weekly self report . Reducing CPD The investigator provide participant randomize reduce CPD full nicotine study cigarette ( 16.5 ± 0.17 mg/g ) study visit throughout 5-week study period instruct smoke cigarette provide study . After establish baseline CPD week 1 , participant receive progressively few cigarette begin 70 % baseline CPD week 2 , 35 % week 3 , 15 % week 4 , 3 % week 5 . Participants receive minimum 1 CPD week 5 . Participants also receive supply NRT patch instruction wear one patch per day every day throughout week 2 5 . This schedule select match percent reduction nicotine content cigarettes smoker randomize switch VLNC cigarettes . Further , schedule NRT aid reduction CPD appear safe , feasible effective . The investigator estimate reduction CPD , compliance study cigarette , NRT use daily weekly self-report .</detailed_description>
