	<detailed_description>We propose open-label , steady-state study TFV FTC PK blood colon tissue healthy TGW feminize hormone compare healthy ci men , risk HIV infection . Research participant already receive eight day TDF/FTC dose . Evaluating TDF FTC PK steady-state important reduces inter-individual variability since rate phosphorylation TFV FTC highly variable , result highly variable TFV-DP Emtricitabine-Triphosphate ( FTC-TP ) PK among individual first day rise steady-state .</detailed_description>
