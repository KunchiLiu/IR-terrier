	<detailed_description>Background : The placebo literature suggest conceptual ( i.e . socially instructed belief ) associative learn process critical genesis placebo effect . Several study perform placebo 'conditioning ' ( associate sham treatment reduce pain repeated experience ) interfere conceptual processing inform subject intensity stimulus lower . This manipulation prevent attribution pain reduction placebo treatment learning process . These study show conditioned analgesia . However , 'conditioning ' perform without verbal explanation treatment seem work , robust placebo effect create . Conceptual process appear critical . Conversely , several study manipulate conceptual expectation alone , manipulate verbal instruction , find markedly reduce absent placebo analgesia pain report brain event-related potential . Learning experience also seem critical . These study separately lead conclusion 'expectancy ' 'conditioning ' critical process , debate focus one driver placebo effect . The investigator propose another view : Both process critical , interact . Experience drive change value learn system , type value learning , 'credit assignment ' problem , brain must decide cue-outcome association update result experience : Is pain reduced treatment effective cause pain change ? Conceptual process fill gap , draw explicit memory generalization similar past experience solve credit assignment problem , create analgesia experienced relief attribute treatment . This view compatible old information base theory condition new evidence rat human alike maintain expectancy specific outcome mental model contingency distinct associative learning . In spite dozen publish study demonstrate effective placebo analgesia establish paradigm investigator use , precise nature learn occurs unknown , placebo analgesia typically study learning-systems perspective . The aim present study assess influence social information associative learning placebo analgesia . In addition , interaction neurochemical system placebo analgesia hardly explore , proposal represent significant effort regard . For example , oxytocin interacts synergistically opioids PAG ( periaqueductal gray ) ( CCK ( Cholecystokinin ) ) relieve pain , separate literature reliably increase trust reduces anxiety interpersonal situation . In spite fact oxytocin proposed central placebo effect administer human know subjective effect side effect , role placebo analgesia explore extensively . The experiment propose clarify role oxytocin system contribution social facilitation analgesia , instrumental develop systems-based model placebo effect . Experimental Design : Participants perform two task experimental session . First , perform social-influence learn task investigate effect oxytocin social instruction effect learn pain . Second , perform social-support pain , test effect oxytocin pain-alleviating effect social support pain .</detailed_description>
