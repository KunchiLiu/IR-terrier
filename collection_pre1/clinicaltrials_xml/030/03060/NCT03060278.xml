	<detailed_description>Smoking remains lead cause preventable morbidity mortality United States,1-3 tobacco use accounting death year combine death attributable alcohol , drug , homicide , suicide , motor vehicle accident , sexual behavior.4 While smoke cessation decrease risk lung cancer , cancer , heart attack , stroke , chronic lung disease,5 smoking quit rate low . Approximately 40-50 % adult daily smoker make quit attempt year , le 14 % smoker able maintain abstinence even single month.6 Individuals low socioeconomic status far likely smoke less successful quitting.7-9 Thus , smoke critically significant behavioral risk factor contribute social disparity incidence mortality disease.10-15 Data indicate smoker higher socioeconomic status likely low socioeconomic status use effective resource quit smoking , appear partially explain high cessation rates.16 Therefore , efficiently connect underserved smoker limit resource efficacious tobacco cessation program easily accessible crucial disease prevention elimination health disparity . Food security define United States Department Agriculture ( USDA ) consistent , dependable access enough food household member lead active , healthy life.17 In 2014 , 14 % US household classify food insecure,17 condition describes limit uncertain access nutritionally adequate , personally acceptable , safe foods.18 National study indicate food insecurity within low-income household associate hypertension ( 24.6 % ) , self-reported hyperlipidemia ( 43.3 % ) , diabetes ( 10.2 % ) , smoke ( 35 % ) .19 Emerging data suggest population access food food pantry fare bad compare general low income , food insecure population , self-reported hypertension ( 65.4 % ) diabetes ( 25.9 % ) notably higher.20 Participants ( n=20 ) randomize one two treatment condition : 1 ) Standard Treatment ( ST ; n=10 ) Automated Treatment ( AT ; n=10 ) . In ST condition , research staff provide participant in- person brief advice quit enroll proactive telephone counsel program smoking cessation . This ST approach mirror Ask Advise Connect ( AAC ) approach team previously develop implement numerous clinic settings.21,22 ST evaluate AT , fully automate AVAST approach . In AT condition , smoker provide brief in-person advice quit enrol fully automate interactive smartphone-based treatment program comprises interactive text messaging , image audio/video clip . Participants treatment condition provide nicotine replacement therapy ( NRT ) form transdermal patch . The goal pilot project establish preliminary efficacy feasibility AT . Data collect pilot use support submission NIH R01 application ( equivalent ) , determine AT perform bad resource intensive ST approach . If lack inferiority establish large project , AT approach readily scalable ; easily implement community-based clinic organization ; offer efficient way allocate limit public health resource tobacco control intervention .</detailed_description>
