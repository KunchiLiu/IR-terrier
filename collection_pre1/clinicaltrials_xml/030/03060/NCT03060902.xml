A total 300 dyad ( initial child age : 36-54 month ) collect Eugene , Oregon Pittsburgh Pennsylvania , 100 pair three group : child mother BPD receive DBT Skills , child mother BPD receive Family Services Usual , child non-disordered mother , match income , final group participate assessment ( quantify normative ER growth ) . All child assess 4 time every 2-months , first assessment occur prior treatment assignment . Investigators use biobehavioral laboratory battery measure child ER , assess emotion understanding , strategy use , attention regulation inhibitory control , parasympathetic regulation . In mother , similar multi-method approach ass emotion acceptance , strategy use , recognition , parasympathetic regulation employ . Finally , laboratory assessment , observations mother 's ability effectively respond child context child negative emotion . Growth curve model chart child ER trajectories 3 group investigator compare child ER growth function : group status ( DBT Skills vs. Family Services Usual vs. income match , non-disordered control ) , change maternal ER , change maternal emotion socialization .
