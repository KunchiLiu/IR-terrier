	<brief_summary>This study aim assess feasibility dual-device treatment prior rehabilitation session orthopaedic injury require immobilization , impact improve outcome decrease risk development neuropathic pain . We evaluate clinical feasibility effectiveness incorporate Alpha-Stim Inter-X treatment standard rehabilitation protocol address risk factor associate development neuropathic pain ( i.e. , pain , range motion , skin temperature ) well impact reduce pain medication .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Combined InterX Alpha-Stim Optimized Rehab After Immobilization ( CES Alpha-Stim ) Non-invasive Interactive Neurostimulation ( InterX ) Optimized Rehabilitation Following Extremity Immobilization</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Once patient provide consent determine meet inclusion criterion process occur follow : 1 . Patients administer baseline demographic standard medical history questionnaire , include information prescription medication use . In addition , patient fill baseline self-report outcome administer ( LANSS ) Pain Scale . Range motion temperature also assess initial session . Some measurement standard care would fill patient even participate study . Usual CARE The usual care aspect study delivery pain treatment ( NIN CES ) commonly use Center Intrepid . The experimental aspect combine delivery treatment , use sham treatment control . The treatment ( NIN CES ) deliver pragmatic fashion , treatment deliver conjunction rehab visit last approximately 4-weeks total . Each session last approximately 20-40 minute long , often deliver conjunction rehab visit ( physical therapy occupational therapy ) occur anywhere 1 3 time week . STRICTLY RESEARCH The experimental aspect study comparison combine treatment ( NIN + CES ) , standard NIN sham CES , standard care alone . Before initiation treatment patient randomize either NIN + CES , NIN + Sham CES , standard care immediately immobilization device ( cast , brace , etc ) remove . Randomization perform random number gerator . All group continue rehabilitation indicate throughout entire course study treatment , beyond indicated therapist . We keep track rehab appointment visit , control . 3 . At 1-month follow-up , subject fill self-report outcome measure baseline , include prescription pain medication administer LANSS pain scale . Range motion temperature also assess . 4 . At 2 4-month follow-up assessment administer . If subject complete formal therapy prior 2 4 month follow-up time point ask return clinic complete assessment . Patients may contact telephone email , agreeable , provide reminder return appointment ( ) . 5 . Outcomes compare three group time point ( i.e. , initial , one month , two month , four month ) . 6 . All patient follow 4 month . Although every attempt make collect data specific time , due variability patient clinic schedule , actual timing collection may vary ( +/- 1 week ) propose measure may collect time point .</detailed_description>
