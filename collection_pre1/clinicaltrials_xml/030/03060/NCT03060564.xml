	<brief_title>Reconstruction Of Acute Coracoclavicular Ligament Disruption With Without Tendon Graft</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Acromioclavicular ( AC ) joint dislocation comprise 12 % shoulder girdle injury . Many method reconstruct coracoclavicular ligament , provide vertical stability acromioclavicular joint , describe . The use tendon graft augment reconstruction provide improved biomechanical stability , less radiographic change postoperatively include loss reduction , improve function . However , use tendon graft necessitates large drill hole clavicle compare suture-only repair construct . The size placement tunnel clavicle associate high rate complication . It show repair set acute injury demonstrate le complication include loss reduction compare chronic dislocation . However , report describe repair acute AC joint dislocation without graft augmentation describe significant change coracoclavicular distance routine follow radiograph , 90 % implant migration rate . While use tendon graft would expect provide stability , may turn cause increase complication rate . 1 . To determine complication rate reconstruction AC joint dislocation without use tendon graft . 2 . Determine patient satisfaction , ASES , Constant , SF-12 , SANE , SST score shoulder undergo reconstruction acute AC joint dislocation without use graft . 3 . The investigation aim determine whether graft use reconstruction acute AC joint dislocation .</detailed_description>
