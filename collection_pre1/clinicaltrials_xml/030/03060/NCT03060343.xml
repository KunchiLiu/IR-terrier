	<brief_title>Zeushield Cytotoxic T Lymphocytes ( Z-CTLs ) Relapsed Refractory Non Small Cell Lung Cancer ( NSCLC )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The purpose first human study determine safety feasibility Zeushield Cytotoxic T Lymphocytes ( Z-CTLs ) patient relapse refractory NSCLC . Z-CTLs therapy novel immunotherapy investigation patient T-cells ( type white blood cell ) collect modified laboratory , give back patient . The T-cells modify transform intracellular signal domain PD-1 CTLA-4 immune activation stimulus signal transform T cell new kind cancer-killer cell : zeushield cytotoxic T lymphocytes ( Z-CTls ) .</detailed_description>
