	<detailed_description>1.0 INTRODUCTION It commonly know thyroid hormone affect function cardiovascular system . Several study mention hormone influence cardiac function geometry directly indirectly . Three potential mechanism describe , direct cellular effect , interaction sympathetic nervous system change peripheral circulation . A study already publish , deal correlation thyroid hormone heart function . Only one prove suppressed ventricular contractility subtotal thyroidectomy hyperthyroidism . This clinical trial aim compare pre- post-operative heart function total thyroidectomy , use echocardiography . Outcomes assessed patient hospitalization three , six twelve month ' follow-up appointment . 2.0 OBJECTIVES To evaluate effect total thyroidectomy function cardiac muscle . 3.0 DESIGN AND STUDY POPULATION The study design prospective , single-center , cohort study . Any patient schedule total thyroidectomy offer participation study fulfill specific inclusion exclusion criterion . 3.3 Duration study The study conduct least 50 patient treat . It estimate take 12 month enroll patient additional 12 month complete follow-up assessment . 4.0 STUDY PROCEDURE 4.1 Pre-operative requirement Procedures preform routine hospital examination , antibiotic prophylactic treatment , anticoagulant treatment diet accord standard management protocol record study . The following pre-operative information record : 1 . Demographic information include : name , age , gender , ethnicity 2 . Height , weight , Body Mass Index ( B.M.I . ) American Society Anesthesiologists ' ( A.S.A . ) physical status 3 . Behavioral history ( Smoking , alcohol drug use ) 4 . Preoperative laboratory finding ( Complete blood count , Ca2+ , fT3 , fT4 , TSH , PTH , VitD ) 5 . Preoperative echocardiography 6 . Diagnosis include clinical observation previous image result 7 . Medications 8 . Current past history surgical medical comorbidities 4.3 Pathology data The following pathology data record patient : 1 . Post-operative diagnosis include pathology report 2 . Weight gland 3 . Dimensions gland 4.4 Postoperative follow-up Follow-up evaluation perform hospitalization well 3rd , 6th 12th month discharge . The following information record : 1 . Wound condition 2 . Average Pain score patient rest moving/day 3 . Postoperative laboratory finding ( Complete blood count , Ca2+ , fT3 , fT4 , TSH , PTH , VitD ) 4 . Postoperative echocardiography three ( 3 ) , six ( 6 ) twelve ( 12 ) month . 5 . Clinical sign hypocalcemia ( Chvostek Trousseau ) 6 . Comments 5.0 COMPLICATIONS AND ADVERSE EVENTS The investigator require notify coordinator serious adverse event . The coordinator also require notify Ethics Committee accord local regulation requirement . Serious Adverse Events include : 1 . Death regardless cause 2 . Any-life-threatening event 3 . Any hospitalization prolongation exist hospitalization 4 . Any event result persistent significant disability incapacity patient . 6.0 STATISTICAL ANALYSIS The objective study evaluate effect total thyroidectomy myocardial function . Statistical analysis include description pre- post-operative outcome , indication patient characteristic associate outcomes . Since study pre-specified hypothesis statistical analysis exploratory interpretation result within context . 7.0 DATA MONITORING PLAN The coordinator monitor data . Furthermore , coordinator review progress clinical trial include safety data ensure conduct , record report accordance protocol , good clinical practice applicable regulatory requirement . 8.0 DATA CONFIDENTIALITY Each patient identify his/her initial unique patient identification number . Source data store source document . Only personnel responsible collect data transcribe case report form access data . Records protect . 9.0 FUNDING No funding execution present protocol consider necessary . The investigator willing execute present study without additional reimbursement . 10.0 ETHICS Prior onset study , institution review board ( IRB ) approval obtain . Any change study protocol , informed consent form , investigator must re-approved IRB . All patient enrol study provide consent prior enter study . Informed consent form shall sign dated patient . The investigator retain form part study record . This study execute accordance Declaration Helsinki , agreement guideline conduct clinical investigation principle ICH GCP outline E6 document . By sign present protocol , participant study commit carry respect local legal requirement . 11.0 INFORMED CONSENT All eligible patient capacity provide write informed consent . The described inclusion exclusion criterion design ensure entry appropriate population patient study approve local IRB . Screening criterion conduct coordinator . Eligible patient educate research proposal study investigator . To determine whether patient understood issue , ask describe research entail whether question . All question address prior enrollment . The patient decline participation study time . A write informed consent form generate . For patient , case report form ( CRF ) complete , provide general medical information history .</detailed_description>
