	<detailed_description>This open label , dose escalation , phase I study determine PR2D assess DLT , safety efficacy AC0010 patient B-cell lymphoma . This study include two part . During Part 1 Dose Escalation , `` 3+3 '' design apply . Dose escalation begin dose level 1 = 400 mg . This dose escalation follow exploratory expansion phase 3 4 group 15~41 patient ( CLL group , MCL group , non-germinal center B cell-like DLBCL group , and/or FL/WM ( macroglobulinemia ) group ) . The study evaluate safety efficacy AC0010 patient group</detailed_description>
