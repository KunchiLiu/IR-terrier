	<brief_summary>This study single center , open-label , randomized clinical trial determine effect pioglitazone ( PIO ) treatment alveolar macrophage immune function , redox stress , NADPH oxidase expression outpatient alcoholic subject . The researcher recruit cohort otherwise healthy patient alcoholic use disorder Substance Abuse Treatment Program Atlanta Veterans Affairs ( VA ) Medical Center randomize receive usual treatment two four week usual treatment plus PIO treatment two four week . There also healthy control group ( match age , gender , smoke status ) receive treatment . To measure effect pioglitazone , participant undergo bronchoscopy take study drug 2-4 week later look change . The bronchoscopy allow researcher obtain fluid lung see well immune cell respond bacteria determine phagocytic capacity .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Alcohol abuse major burden society enormous problem veteran population . Many people aware chronic alcohol ingestion cause serious health problem like liver injury brain damage chronic alcohol consumption also hurt lung . People regularly drink daily maximum level recommend Centers Disease Control Prevention ( CDC ) ( 1 drink per day woman 2 drink per day men ) likely suffer pneumonia acute lung injury . The primary goal clinical research study determine Food Drug Administration ( FDA ) approve diabetes drug , call pioglitazone , improve lung immune defense otherwise healthy alcoholic . There strong evidence experimental animal model pioglitazone preserve lung health even daily alcohol ingestion . This National Institutes Health ( NIH ) fund project recruit veterans patient Atlanta VA Hospital . Half participant randomly assign receive pioglitazone half assign receive treatment . Participants assign pioglitazone take pill per day two four week . To measure effect pioglitazone , participant undergo procedure call bronchoscopy take study drug 2-4 week later look change . The bronchoscopy allow researcher obtain fluid lung see well immune cell respond bacteria ( determine phagocytic capacity ) . The researcher also plan enroll 12 healthy veteran patient drink . These participant undergo one-time bronchoscopy visit require . The finding study guide future , large scale clinical trial determine pioglitazone use clinical set improve outcome alcoholic develop pneumonia acute lung injury .</detailed_description>
