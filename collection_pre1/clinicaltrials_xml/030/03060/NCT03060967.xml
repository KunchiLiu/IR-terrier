	<detailed_description>Major depression frequent psychiatric disorder estimate lifetime prevalence 16-17 % general population . Although pathophysiology completely understood , large body literature plead causative role disturbance reward process , refer : ) hedonic sensation ( i.e . `` like '' ) define pleasure felt exposure appetitive stimulus , ii ) motivation ( i.e . `` want '' ) represent ability initiate maintain behavioral response orient toward appetitive stimulus . Several methodological approach use study hedonic motivational process major depression . Some clinical investigation try explore : ) taste sensitivity , reflective hedonic reaction food stimulus , ii ) time judgment , indicative degree motivation , expect low time perceive long . However , study suffer serious limitation rely frequent utilization subjective assessment method . Other author instead examine either : ) process emotional information use positive , negative , neutral face word , ii ) process motivational value reinforcement , monetary cue . These experimental paradigm couple functional neuroimaging allow objectively identify anatomo-functional correlate internal affective state . However , limited availability costly procedure characterize use functional neuroimaging . investigator therefore develop tested new experimental computer-based easy-to-use test intend provide objective , implicit quantitative measurement hedonic motivational state human . According task , subject ask view compare two stimulus , appetitive one ( food picture ; F ) devalue counterpart ( food picture greyscale ; D ) , trial , assess either size ( task A ) duration presentation ( task B ) . Geometric figure use control present color ( C ) greyscale ( D ) ( 1 ) . Both task register French agency protection computer software . Here , investigator propose use novel test : ) ass hedonic motivational state subject suffer major depression ii ) compare responses healthy volunteer . Responses test depressed patient evaluate two separate experimental session either fast satiety condition . The present study expect begin February 2017 total duration 36 consecutive month . A sample 36 patient suffer major depression recruit compare 36 healthy normal volunteer . They match age sex . During inclusion visit , information study design deliver write inform consent collect . Thereafter , subject screen use `` Association pour la Méthodologie et la Documentation en Psychiatrie '' ( AMDP ) questionnaire , Mini-International Neuropsychiatric Interview Three-Factor Eating Questionnaire anamnestic , diagnostic psychometric ( eat behavior ) evaluation , respectively . Dietary habit record specific appropriate instrument use National Program Nutrition Health.This associate assessment : ) depressive anxiety symptom . severity Montgomery Asberg Depression Rating Scale , Brief Anxiety Scale , overall functioning Global Assessment Functioning scale depress patient ; , ii ) neuropsychological function include cognitive flexibility/psychomotor speed Trail make Test ( A-B ) visuospatial memory Rey-Osterreich Figure Test . To ensure subject familiar experimental procedure , task A B explain first 5-10 trial perform . Two separate experimental session conduct , one satiety 6-hour fasting breakfast , 3-4 day apart . During session , participant ask perform two validated instrumental task front screen computer . Visual analogue scale ( VAS ) assess hunger level complete task perform . A VAS also use global assessment appetitive property view food image end second experimental session . This procedure adopt avoid give subject specific information exact objective study therefore potentially limit biased response food image .</detailed_description>
