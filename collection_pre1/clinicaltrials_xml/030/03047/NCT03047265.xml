	<brief_title>Concurrent Chemoradiotherapy Patients With Locoregionally Advanced Nasopharyngeal Carcinoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Nasopharyngeal carcinoma one common malignancy South China . Nasopharyngeal carcinoma sensitive radiotherapy chemotherapy . Concurrent chemoradiation become standard treatment locally advanced stage III-IVb nasopharyngeal carcinoma . However , The recommend single-agent DDP concurrent chemotherapy regimen high-risk patient ( IVa-IVb period ) improve efficacy significant . Paclitaxel combine platinum period chemotherapy regimen widely use head neck cancer , cervical cancer , esophageal squamous cell carcinoma lung cancer tumor , number study show good tolerance efficacy . And number previous study show paclitaxel combine platinum chemotherapy period head neck cancer nasopharyngeal cancer multiple phase II clinical trial achieve encouraging result . Based background basis , high risk ( IVa-IVb ) nasopharyngeal carcinoma treatment , applicant intend carry first IMRT + paclitaxel + DDP concurrent chemotherapy compare DDP single drug concurrent chemotherapy regimen Pharyngeal cancer prospective randomize controlled phase Ⅱ clinical trial paclitaxel + DDP dual-chemotherapy regimen treatment high-risk nasopharyngeal carcinoma provide evidence-based basis . ( IVa-IVb ) nasopharyngeal carcinoma ( NPC ) , provide high-level evidence-based evidence-based approach treatment nasopharyngeal carcinoma high risk ( stage IVa-IVb ) . The result study used international guideline optimize high- Treatment cancer patient .</detailed_description>
