	<detailed_description>This single arm pilot study use TCR alpha/beta+ T cell-depleted peripheral blood stem cell ( PBSC ) closely match unrelated donor partially matched/haploidentical related donor hematopoietic stem cell transplant ( HSCT ) patient acquire inherited bone marrow failure ( BMF ) syndromes . Previously establish , disease-specific transplant preparative regimen administer base specific underlie BMF condition . Mobilized PBSC process use CliniMACS system TCR alpha/beta+ T cell depletion plus CD19+ B cell depletion . The study determine efficacy strategy term engraftment , rate acute chronic Graft versus Host Disease ( GvHD ) , one year overall event-free survival .</detailed_description>
