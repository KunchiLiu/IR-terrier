	<detailed_description>Ultrasound use assessment medical abortion eligibility vary practice site . The National Abortion Federation ( NAF ) , Society Family Planning ( SFP ) , World Health Organization ( WHO ) guideline recommend routine use sonography ; however , many institution practice still require part clinic protocol . Many clinician routinely perform transvaginal sonography ( TVS ) , invasive assessment transabdominal ultrasound ( TAS ) ; reliance TVS , specifically , cost-prohibitive due high-level disinfection ( HLD ) requirement . Thus , routine US use greatly decrease access abortion service . Medical abortion account increase proportion abortion perform United States ; 2012 , 20.8 % abortion medical abortion . Routine use ultrasonography particularly TVS may holdover secondary use early clinical trial medical abortion efficacy - use remain part many provider ' clinical practice despite evidence always necessary . This study , specifically , would value many clinician currently use TVS medical abortion patient could support use TAS rather TVS majority patient . The result could also provide guidance often practice setting without TVS HLD would able provide medical abortion , patient . Such setting could include primary care rural clinic , low volume clinic , cost time associate HLD require use TVS prohibit limit provision medical abortion . In addition , even high-volume specialty family planning clinic would benefit reduction use TVS . In US , many provider sonography available use routinely . However , even US , many clinic may seek offer medical abortion without sonography , researcher study type approach . This propose study evaluate intermediate change practice , primarily gear towards large number provider routinely provide transvaginal ultrasound . For provider , move TVS TAS could cost effective acceptable patient . In detail , study enroll patient present medical abortion multiple clinical site . These woman undergo routine intake per usual clinical protocol , randomize receive either TVS TAS . Afterwards , routine clinical care provide clinician , include medical abortion provision test determine eligibility . Women complete acceptability survey conclusion visit . For provider , prior participation , provider complete questionnaire regard professional characteristic . Investigators provide train session provider site review TAS ( i.e. , technique standardize report ) assume provider less experience compare TVS early pregnancy . This training session help minimize difference TVS TAS related provider experience variability current practice . In addition , prior participant enrollment , clinic site enroll 5 pilot patient , provider perform TAS accustom provider clinic staff study protocol . Each clinician perform TAS least 2 5 pilot patient .</detailed_description>
