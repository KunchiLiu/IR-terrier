	<brief_title>Pancreatic Islet Cell Transplantation After Kidney Transplantation - A Novel Approach Immunosupression</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Diabetes mellitus ( DM ) type 1 disease significant social economic impact . The prevalence disease United States 120,000 individual age 19 less 300,000 500,000 age 150 million worldwide . There 30,000 new case diagnosed year United States . DM one frequent chronic diseases child United States 1 . The cost treatment complication disease United States 90 billion dollar year . To date mechanical device able effectively adjust dose insulin inject accord serum glucose level patient DM . This lead less-than-perfect sugar control , episodes hypoglycemia dangerous . The emerge alternative whole organ pancreas transplantation pancreatic islet cell transplantation ( ICT ) . The process base enzymatic isolation pancreatic islet Langerhans organ procure cadaveric donor 13-15 ; islet obtain inject liver recipient via percutaneous catheterization portal venous system 16 . This procedure allow selective transplantation insulin-producing cell population avoid open surgery well transplantation duodenum exocrine pancreas related morbidity . The initial effort ICT modest result . The immunosuppression regimen similar one use solid organ transplantation , base high dose steroid calcineurin inhibitor - agent diabetogenic effect . The result improve markedly change manipulation islet , change immunosuppression thus avoid high dos steroid use sirolimus , tacrolimus daclizumab initiate investigator group University Alberta Edmonton , Canada . Their protocol require general two islet cell infusion order attain critical cell mass necessary achieve insulin-independency . The change treatment adopt Edmonton Protocol , use several transplant center , worldwide . Isolation islet donor pancreata occur Baylor University Medical Center Islet Cell Processing Laboratory ( ICPL ) . The islet cell infusion perform Interventional Radiology Suite Baylor University Medical Center Baylor All Saints Medical Center interventional radiologist . The procedure take place suite design invasive procedure use sterile technique access general anesthesia necessary . Following procedure patient observe Interventional Radiology recovery area long necessary determine Physician transfer Transplant Service overnight stay . After recovery , patient admit hospital Transplant Service 1-2 day observation . The focus research ICT center development safe effective procedure eventually replace surgical pancreas transplantation together ideal immunosuppressive regimen provide safe effective prevention rejection , minimize adverse event associate negatively impact transplant recipient 's quality life .</detailed_description>
