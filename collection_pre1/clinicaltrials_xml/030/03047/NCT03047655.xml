	<detailed_description>A grow number cross-sectional study investigate role human lipidome new biomarker metabolic disease . However , data issue still sparse especially interventional data available . We intend clarify , human lipidome correlate metabolic state change state reflect lipidome . Using high-throughput shot-gun technique , able measure several hundred lipid specie one blood sample . The `` GesundLeben '' trial provide data 100 human subject metabolic syndrome , undergo distinct type lifestyle intervention 6 week . The cohort design include participant sex , restrict subject without impaired glucose tolerance . Standardized metabolic assessment cover routine laboratory parameter ( e.g . transaminase , HbA1c ) oral glucose tolerance test well non-radiologic anthropometric measurement ( BMI , WHR , BIA ) .</detailed_description>
