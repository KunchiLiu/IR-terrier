	<brief_title>Radiotherapy Related Skin Toxicity : Mepitel® vs. Standard Care Patients With Locally Advanced Head-and-Neck Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The primary goal randomize trial demonstrate Mepitel® Film superior Standard Care respect prevent grade 2 radiation dermatitis ( RD ) patient receive radio ( chemo ) therapy 50 Gy locally advance squamous cell carcinoma head-and-neck ( SCCHN ) . The primary aim randomize multinational multicenter trial investigate rate patient experience grade ≥2 RD ( CTCAE v4.03 ) 50 Gy radiotherapy ( RT ) . Evaluation 50 Gy RT primary endpoint , since 50 Gy , irradiated volume include primary tumor bilateral cervical supraclavicular lymph node , , therefore , almost identical patient . After 50 Gy , irradiate volume much individual , depend location size primary tumor , involvement lymph node , treatment approach ( definitive vs. adjuvant ) . This randomized , active-controlled , parallel-group trial , compare follow treatment radiation relate skin toxicity patient head-and-neck cancer : Mepitel® Film ( Arm A ) vs. Standard Care ( Arm B ) . About 4 contribute center plan include average 21 patients/year . The recruitment duration 168 patient = 24 month . The follow-up period 3 week . The total running time = 25 month . Stratification prognostic factor : 1 . Tumor site : oropharynx/oral cavity vs. hypopharynx/larynx 2 . Treatment approach : radiochemotherapy vs. RT alone 3 . Participating site In case small group due uneven distribution stratification group , stratum might connect Analysis ( data base lock final analysis data . This trial patient receive definitive adjuvant radio ( chemo ) therapy locally advance ( SCCHN ) . Radiotherapy RT administer use conventional fractionation ( 5 x 2.0 Gy per week ) . In patient , initial target volume include region primary tumor plus bilateral cervical supraclavicular lymph nod 50 Gy . Patients treat adjuvant RT follow complete resection primary tumor involve lymph node ( R0-resection ) receive radiation boost 10 Gy ( 5 x 2.0 Gy per week ) region primary tumor involve lymph node . In case microscopically incomplete resection ( R1-resection ) , boost dose primary tumor region 16 Gy . In case extra-capsular spread ( ECS ) lymph node , lymph node show ECS receive additional boost 6 Gy ( i.e . cumulative boost dose 16 Gy ) . Patients receive definitive RT , receive boost 10 Gy ( 5 x 2.0 Gy/week ) primary tumor , involve lymph node , lymph node level adjacent involve lymph node . An additional boost another 10 Gy ( 5 x 2.0 Gy/week ) administer primary tumor involve lymph node . Treatment perform either intensity-modulated RT ( IMRT ) volumetric modulate arc therapy ( VMAT ) RT . The rate patient experience grade ≥2 RD ( CTCAE v4.03 ) 5. week therapy ( 50 Gy ) focus clinical study . Additionally another 2 week RT ( 70 Gy ) might perform . This treatment conduct accordance common treatment guideline . The treatment patient &gt; 50 Gy analyze within study . The occurrence adverse event ( AEs ) serious adverse event ( SAEs ) document duration RT . The final dose RT document Case Report Form ( CRF ) . Concomitant Chemotherapy In patient receive definitive RT , concomitant chemotherapy cisplatin carboplatin administer . The cumulative cisplatin carboplatin dose end 5. week RT ( 50 Gy ) 200 mg/m2 . This cumulative dose may either achieve 20 mg/m2 give RT fraction 1-5 21-25 , 25 mg/m2 give RT fraction 1-4 21-24 , weekly dose 40 mg/m2 . Cisplatin carboplatin administer saline hydration intravenous bolus infusion . The saline hyper-hydration give accord investigational centre 's routine . All patient treat cisplatin carboplatin addition RT must receive adequate anti-emetic therapy prior administration cisplatin carboplatin . It recommend 5-Hydroxytryptamine type 3 ( 5HT3 ) antagonist ( e.g . granisetron ) dexamethasone 8 mg i.v . administer prior cycle treatment . Quality assurance plan : Monitoring : The Center Clinical Studies ( ZKS ) Lübeck conduct clinical on-site monitoring German site accord common guideline regulation . According SOPs , trial specific monitoring activity define start trial document writing ( monitor manual ) . Patient registration randomization The patient assign two code number : number contribute center plus patient identification ( ID ) number , continuously ascend , start 001 . After registration , patient randomize 1:1 ratio receive either Mepitel® Film ( Arm A ) Standard Care ( Arm B ) treatment radiation relate skin toxicity . A stratified randomization perform block . The stratification conduct 4 center , 2 treatment approach , 2 tumor site . The randomization perform centrally ZKS via fax . The proceeding base standard operating procedure ( SOPs ) ZKS . . Sample size calculation The primary goal randomize trial demonstrate Mepitel® Film superior Standard Care respect prevent grade 2 RD patient receive radio ( chemo ) therapy 50 Gy locally advance SCCHN . The null hypothesis equal rate grade ≥2 skin toxicity test two-sided alternative hypothesis different rate . Based hypothesis system , sample size require trial calculate take account follow assumption : - A Chi-square Test apply - The two-sided significance level set 5 % - In patient treated radio ( chemo ) therapy locally advance SCCHN , previous study suggest rate grade ≥2 skin toxicity 86-92 % standard skin care administer . - Based data , rate grade ≥2 skin toxicity 85 % assumed reference group ( `` worst-case '' ) , i.e . patient receive standard care skin toxicity . - Administration Mepitel® Film consider clinically relevant , rate grade ≥2 skin toxicity reduce 65 % . - The power yield statistical significance difference rate fact 20 percentage point set 80 % . Based assumption , 80 patient require per study arm within Full Analysis Set ( FAS ) . Taking account 5 % patient qualify FAS , total 168 patient randomize . Statistical analysis General Considerations All data record CRFs describe study population , toxicity quality life ( QoL ) analyze descriptively . Categorical data present contingency table frequency percentage . Continuous data summarize least : frequency ( n ) , median , quartile , mean , SD , min max . Number patient protocol deviation listing describe deviation provide . In general , chi-square test use compare percentage two-by-two contingency table , replace Fisher´s exact test expect frequency least one cell associate table less 5 . Stratified two-by-two contingency table analyze use Cochran-Mantel-Haenszel test . Logistic regression model serve multivariable method binary endpoint data . Comparison ordinal variable treatment arm perform use asymptotic Wilcoxon-Mann-Whitney test , replace exact version case ordinal category small number category and/or sparse data within category . Any shift location quantitative variable study group perform Wilcoxon-Mann-Whitney test well . Time-to-event data analyze Kaplan-Meier method , merely non-informative censoring occurs . For statistical comparison , logrank-test provide supplemented multivariate Cox proportional hazard model . The data analysis perform accord statistical analysis plan ( SAP ) , finalise prior database lock prior statistical analysis . Primary Endpoint The rate patient experience grade ≥2 RD patient receive radio ( chemo ) therapy 50 Gy statistically compare use Cochran-Mantel-Haenszel Chi-square test two-sided significance level 5 % . This test natural non-parametric extension Chi-square test test treatment effect , adjust effect stratification variable use randomization . For assessment robustness result , logistic regression model grade ≥2 RD apply include parameter use stratification . In addition , model include also additional patient characteristic fit . The confirmatory evaluation perform within FAS , Per Protocol Set serve sensitivity analysis . Secondary endpoint Time grade 2 RD 50 Gy RT define time start RT least grade 2 RD . Patients without grade 2 RD censor date receiving total dose 50 Gy . The distribution time grade 2 RD administration 50 Gy describe use Kaplan-Meier method . These analysis stratify treatment arm prognostic risk group use randomization . Estimates median time grade 2 RD estimate rate specific time point extract Kaplan-Meier analysis together associate 95 % confidence limit . The treatment difference test use stratify log-rank test , stratify stratification factor . Furthermore , Cox proportional hazard model apply yield adjust estimate associate hazard ratio . All AEs report accord CTCAE v4.03 also subject statistical analysis . AE table present total number patient report least one specific event maximum CTCAE grade . Patients report one episode event count bad CTCAE grade per patient . Special table give CTCAE Grade III/IV/V AEs . Analysis restrict treatment related AEs treatment related CTCAE Grade III/IV/V event . QoL evaluate use validate EORTC quality life questionnaire ( QLQ ) -C30 EORTC QLQ-H &amp; N35 questionnaires . Data score accord algorithm describe respective scoring manual . For QoL domains item , descriptive analysis present stratified visit treatment arm . For descriptive statistical analysis , summary table provide show measure location dispersion ( min , quartile , median , max , mean , SD ) stratify visit , treatment arm . Individual score item subject statistical analysis . Absolute change QoL-scores baseline tabulate stratified treatment group visit . For graphical illustration , Box-Whisker diagram present across visit treatment group . Nonparametric ( exact ) Wilcoxon-Mann-Whitney test apply exploratory comparison purpose .
