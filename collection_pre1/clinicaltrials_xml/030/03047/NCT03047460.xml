	<brief_summary>The establishment biomarker ( ) predict clinical response therapy course 1-2 year clinical trial critical expeditious development treatment Multiple Sclerosis ( MS ) . Identification biomarker would enable short small clinical trial result faster development much need treatment MS , specifically neuro-reparative therapy . The etiology disease progression conduction block , demyelination axonal degeneration . Evoked potential provide direct assessment underlie etiology disease progression MS . They functional assessment multiple pathway , include visual , motor sensory , evaluate integrity myelin axon . The variability motor evoke potential ( MEP ) measure limited multimodal evoke potential ( mmEP ) use international , multicenter clinical trial . MEP evaluation significantly contribute predictive value mmEP 's . Recent advance technology establishment standardize protocol MEP reduce variability associate procedure . The objective study evaluate reliability feasibility MEP SSEP international , multicenter trial mmEP evaluate biomarker disease progression . The rationale study explore feasibility reliability MEP 's somatosensory evoke potential ( SSEP 's ) multicenter clinical trial potential use biomarker predict clinical progression/improvement international clinical trial evaluate remyelinating therapy . Study Objectives Endpoints : Objective : The primary objective study evaluate feasibility test-retest reliability MEP 's ( SSEP 's ) multicenter clinical trial healthy subject subject MS. Endpoints : The primary reliability endpoint intraclass correlation coefficient ( ICC ) follow evoke potential parameter Motor Evoked parameter measure : - MEP latency - Central motor conduction time ( CMCT ) root latency method - MEP amplitude - MEP amplitude compound motor amplitude ratio ( MEP-M ratio ) right leave abductor digiti minimi ( ADM ) right leave tibialis anterior ( TA ) - Somatosensory evoke potential parameter include Evoked potential latency upper low limb bilaterally . Study Design : This multinational , multicenter study conduct healthy adult volunteer MS patient establish feasibility reliability mmEP 's . A total 40 subject , 10 ( 5 healthy 5 MS ) 4 site enrol . The study consist two visit , 1-30 day apart , subject screen confirm eligibility complete specify study assessment . Study Locations : Canada , Germany , Switzerland Italy , 1 site country . Number Planned Subjects : A minimum 40 subject plan study . Subjects withdraw study prior completion second visit may replace discretion investigator . Study Population : This study conduct subject 25 58 year age , inclusive , either healthy volunteer ( HV ) diagnose clinically definite MS detectable lesion MEP SSEP . Study Groups : Two group , healthy volunteer clinically definite MS include . Duration Study Participation : Study duration subject two visit , second visit schedule &gt; 24 hours-30 day first visit Criteria Evaluation : Key Study Assessments : Electrophysiological . MEP 's SSEPs measure upper low limb bilaterally . All study read locally review blind reader another center . The ICC every measure evoke potential parameter determine central local read .</brief_summary>
