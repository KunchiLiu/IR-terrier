	<brief_summary>Mammography consider standard image method breast cancer screening , know result reduce mortality breast cancer . However , diagnostic yield mammography depend particularly breast tissue density , sensitivity low 30-48 % dense-breast woman . Ultrasound attractive adjunct image method mammography widely accessible , relatively inexpensive well-tolerated patient . The addition hand-held ultrasound mammography demonstrate significantly increase breast cancer detection woman dense breast . It however dependent expertise skill operator . In recent year , FDA approve use automate breast ultrasound ( ABUS ) use screen woman dense breast . Unlike handheld ultrasound , ABUS relatively simple use , necessitate less technical training , result high reproducibility . The research aim evaluation automate breast ultrasound ( ABUS ) regard detection classification breast lesion , compare hand-held ultrasound , accord American College Radiology Breast Imaging-Reporting Data System ( BI-RADS ) classification . The investigator also evaluate parameter regard patient ' comfort , workflow , duration image interpretation .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>ABUS produce 3D volume acquisition use 6-15 Mega Herz reverse curve transducer . Images digitally reformatted dedicated workstation produce axial , sagittal coronal reformatted image . Unlike handheld ultrasound , ABUS relatively simple use , necessitate less technical training , result high reproducibility . Previous study show automate breast ultrasound well tolerated patient useful detection solid cystic lesion evaluate tumor extent preoperatively . Automated breast ultrasound perform `` Invenia ABUS '' ( Automated Breast Ultrasound System ) design automate breast image General Electric ( GE ) Healthcare . Images acquire use 15 centimeter field-of-view reverse curve ultra-broadband transducer 6-15 Mega Herz . Using mechanical compression assist , transducer place breast six volume acquire six sweep ( right anterior-posterior , right lateral , right medial ; leave anterior-posterior , left lateral , leave medial ) . Acquisition time expect 15 minute per patient , approximately 30-40 second acquisition per volume . ABUS examination perform investigator institution 's radiographer , variable degree experience perform hand-held breast ultrasound examination ( HHUS ) . Reformatted image volume view designate workstation 2 megapixel high resolution monitor , use customized hanging protocol , multi-slice 3D viewing patent clinical algorithm . Interpretation image do institution 's breast imaging radiologists 15 year experience perform read hand-held breast ultrasound study . Each breast assign final ABUS BI-RADS score accord American College Radiology classification range 1 6 . A discrepancy ABUS Breast Imaging-Reporting Data System score hand-held ultrasound BI-RADS score ( HHUS BI-RADS 1-2 &amp; ABUS BI-RADS &gt; 2 , HHUS BI-RADS &gt; 3 &amp; ABUS BI-RADS 1-2 ) result referral woman second-look hand-held ultrasound determine reason mismatch .</detailed_description>
