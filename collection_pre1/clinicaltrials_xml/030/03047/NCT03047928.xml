	<brief_title>Combination Therapy With Nivolumab PD-L1/IDO Peptide Vaccine Patients With Metastatic Melanoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Background : Huge advance make treatment metastatic melanoma ( MM ) past 5 year . Especially immunotherapy show promising result . Cancer cell naturally attack cell immune system , induce state tolerance whereby escape immune attack . This escape bring many mechanism . An important one program death pathway ( PD-1/PD-L1 ) . PD-L1 commonly overexpressed cancer cell . Interaction PD-1 activate T cell PD-L1 cancer cell lead inhibition cytotoxic T cell . Another important mechanism overexpression metabolic enzyme IDO cancer cell . Activation IDO also inhibit cytotoxic T cell . Investigators recently identify spontaneous T cell reactivity PD-L1 IDO tumor microenvironment peripheral blood patient MM healthy donor . Both IDO PD-L1 reactive CD8 T cell cytotoxic kill cancer cell immune regulatory cell vitro.. Thus boost specific T cell recognize immune regulatory protein IDO PD-L1 may directly modulate immune regulation . Due distinct mechanism action , combination treatment monoclonal antibody target PD-1 ( Nivolumab ) vaccine peptide PD-L1 IDO may synergistic effect . Investigators previously report phase I trial , IDO peptide test 15 patient MM combination Ipilimumab , grade 3-4 toxicity see . The PD-L1 peptide currently test first-in-man study patient multiple myeloma . Methods : A two-step clinical phase I/II trial design use , start pilot study include 6 patient MM test feasibility tolerability . If treatment find feasible study extend phase II study 24 patient . The objective describe anti-tumor immune response objective response use RECIST 1.1 . Patients treat Nivolumab accordance standard regimen , involve outpatient IV infusion every second week long clinical benefit . The PD-L1/IDO peptide vaccine give start Nivolumab every second week first 6 vaccine thereafter every fourth week 1 year . 15 vaccine administer total . Patients follow clinical control diagnostic image every 12 week . Patients receive vaccine follow 3 6 month parallel standard care treatment Nivolumab .</detailed_description>
