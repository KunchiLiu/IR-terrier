	<brief_summary>Around third patient develop acute kidney injury ( AKI ) hospital admission ( hospital-acquired - HA-AKI ) . The primary aim study prospectively test whether introduce complex intervention ( 'care package ' - comprise clinical prediction rule incorporate electronic alert generates checklist patient management relevant health professional ) identify patient admission hospital risk develop HA-AKI , highlight need closer monitor allow putative preventative measure put place . The investigator introduce care package one acute hospital evaluate effectiveness reduce HA-AKI associated morbidity , ten month , compare sister hospital within Trust ( act control site ) . The investigator extend evaluation ten month ass sustainability first site introduce package control hospital ass generalisability . The primary aim reduce HA-AKI , secondary aim include improve outcomes associate HA-AKI , management patient already AKI admission hospital ( whose care may also benefit checklist ) cost-effectiveness analysis .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Electronic Alerting Tool Help Prevent Acute Kidney Injury</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Acute Kidney Injury ( AKI ) common hospital ( incidence 10-20 % - 70 % critically ill ) , high associate morbidity mortality . Even small change renal function associate increased mortality . The 2009 National Confidential Enquiry Patient Outcome Death examine care patient die hospital primary diagnosis AKI . Over 40 % case unacceptable delay diagnosis 20 % case , AKI think predictable avoidable . Electronic alert study patient establish AKI , however , highlight rise creatinine insult rather identify patient risk AKI - third hospital AKI case occur admission ( HA-AKI ) . Risk factor report surgical burn patient . However , strategy identify patient admit medical emergency risk develop AKI lack - group accounting Intensive Care admission AKI . The investigator multidisciplinary team , significant experience utilise technology healthcare , develop novel prediction score - Acute Kidney injury Prediction Score ( APS ) . Utilising physiological measurement , biochemical parameter know co-morbidities , APS identify patient risk develop HA-AKI follow admission ( 1/3 AKI case ) . A 'care package ' devised incorporating APS automate electronic algorithm send realtime alert staff Observation chart , e-mail patient 's Consultant advise checklist . Alongside , E-learning AKI module ward staff develop building NICE Guidance additional information regard APS . Aims Primary : investigate whether introduce 'care package ' reduce HA-AKI patient admit hospital emergency . Secondary include determine whether intervention : reduces associated complication ; improve outcome patient AKI admission ; cost-effective . Research Questions Primary : 'care package ' systematically recognise 'at risk ' patient , alert prompt management staff educate problem , reduce HA-AKI ? Secondary : - Can harm associate AKI reduce ? - Is intervention acceptable staff barrier implementation ? - Are improvement sustainable intervention successfully apply second hospital ? - Does intervention improve outcome AKI admission ? - Is intervention cost-effective ? Design A prospective , non-randomised , parallel cohort study , before-after trial period , intervention control hospital site , perform . A run-in phase ( 10 month ) baseline data collection prospective external validation follow intervention one site ( Worthing ) Chichester site act control ( Phase 1 ) 10 month . The intervention introduce Chichester whilst continue Worthing ( Phase 2 ) 10 month . The additional period allow analysis intervention ' impact readmission . Potential benefit : 1 . Preventing morbidity mortality include secondary complication chronic kidney disease ( immediate long term ) . 2 . Reducing length stay , thus reduce potential exposure harm . 3 . Prevent requirement renal replacement therapy escalation Intensive Care associate morbidity , mortality psychological harm . 4 . A Cost-effectiveness analysis aim demonstrate whether strategy could provide saving locally wider health economy ( short long-term ) . 5 . Inform healthcare community applicability information technology benefit patient improve staff engagement , potential utilisation number condition .</detailed_description>
