	<brief_summary>The purpose study retrospectively evaluate treatment pattern AML-related key healthcare resource use among AML patient , stratify FLT3 mutation status , intensive chemotherapy ( IC ) eligibility , relapse refractory ( R/R ) status .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Treatment Patterns Key Healthcare Resource Use Acute Myeloid Leukemia ( AML ) With Without FMS-like Tyrosine Kinase-3 ( FLT3 ) Mutation Study Based Retrospective Chart Review</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The current study retrospective non-interventional study use real-world data collect exist medical record evaluate descriptively treatment pattern key healthcare resource use among AML patient without FLT3 mutation . The current study relies secondary use exist data , intervention involve . Patients receive first AML treatment initial diagnosis , classified relapsed/refractory ( R/R ) , January 1 , 2013 December 31 , 2015 randomly select include study , data exist medical record extract . Eligible patient group base FLT3 mutation status , intensive chemotherapy ( IC ) eligibility , R/R status . For newly diagnose patient , index date define initiation date first AML treatment follow initial diagnosis . For R/R patient , index date define date patient classify R/R . The study period period index date last follow-up date death , whichever come earlier . The endpoint measurement study treatment pattern key AML-related healthcare resource use study period .</detailed_description>
