	<brief_summary>This observational design : - Aim 1 : Define novel homogeneous group patient unclassified leukodystrophy work toward find cause disorder ; - Aim 2 : Assess validity utility next-generation sequence diagnosis leukodystrophies ; - Aim 3 : Establish disease mechanism select known leukodystrophies ; - Aim 4 : Track current care natural history patient define longitudinal course determinant outcomes disorder . These objective achieve collecting , subsequently analyze , data sample longitudinal fashion across leukodystrophies .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Genetic white matter disorder ( leukodystrophies ) estimate incidence approximately 1:7000 live birth . In past , patient white matter disease unknown cause evaluate investigator achieve diagnosis few 46 % case extensive conventional clinical testing . Even diagnosis achieve , diagnosis take average eight year `` odyssey '' result test charge patient insurer excess $ 8,000 average per patient , include patient never achieve diagnosis . With next generation approach whole exome sequencing , diagnostic efficacy closer 70 % , approximately third individual achieve specific etiologic diagnosis . This remain group patient ( unclassified leukodystrophy ) offer opportunity describe novel disorder provide improve diagnostic tool . These diagnostic challenge represent urgent unresolved gap knowledge disease characterization , obtain definitive diagnosis paramount importance leukodystrophy patient . Moreover , mechanisms disease many leukodystrophies know cause poorly understood : many systemic abnormality manifest test white matter . Finally , little known best symptomatic management many leukodystrophies without etiologic cure thus limited standard care available management patient . The purpose study : ( Aim 1 ) define novel homogeneous group patient unclassified leukodystrophy work toward find cause disorder ; ( Aim 2 ) ass validity utility next-generation sequence diagnosis leukodystrophies ; ( Aim 3 ) establish disease mechanism select known leukodystrophies ; ( Aim 4 ) track current care natural history patient define longitudinal course determinant outcomes disorder . It hop present study help clarify nosology leukodystrophies significantly advance understanding pathogenesis disease , best diagnostic testing tool , best symptomatic management condition . Due breadth approach , rarity condition , approach carry multiple clinical center specialize expertise leukodystrophies .</detailed_description>
