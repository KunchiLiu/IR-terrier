	<brief_summary>After provide write informed consent , first 20 Subjects meet Inclusion/Exclusion Criteria consecutively enrol Standard Care cohort . The moderate treatment cohort consecutively enrol , follow tight glycemic control cohort . After sensor insertion , baseline evaluation include APACHE II , SOFA , laboratory evaluation determine . Subjects enrol standard care cohort treat accord institution 's protocol measure glucose manage insulin . These subject monitor GlucoClear System manage base value trend GlucoClear system . Subjects enrol treatment cohort monitor manage special version GlucoClear continuous monitoring system . This system contain GlucoClear Insulin Dosing Algorithm provide insulin dose recommendation enable clinician manage patient glucose within pre-specified target level . These recommendation present screen clinical professional approve override . Subjects moderate treatment cohort glucose manage range 120 - 180 mg/dl . Subjects tight glycemic control treatment cohort manage range 80 - 120 mg/dl . After discharge ICU , subject followed adverse event mortality 30 day , either telephone contact office visit .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Effects GlucoClear CGM System Performance Insulin Therapy Critically Ill Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Hyperglycemia , hypoglycemia glycemic variability , three component dysglycemia independently associate morbidity mortality critically ill patient . Blood glucose ( BG ) control insulin potential decrease morbidity mortality intensive care unit ( ICU ) patient . Blood glucose control insulin , however , associate increase risk hypoglycemia effect glycemic variability uncertain . BG control insulin utilize manual system glucose measurement blood-consuming time-consuming , since frequent blood draw glucose measurement necessary order achieve blood glucose control . Severe hypoglycemia ( blood glucose level &lt; 40 mg/dl ) fear complication blood glucose control insulin . Undoubtedly , implementation blood glucose insulin incidence hypoglycemia increase . Reported incidence severe hypoglycemia rise 5 10-fold compare conventional glucose control strategy randomize controlled trial . Several report show significant association hypoglycemia patient outcome . Recently , association even suggest moderate mild hypoglycemia ( blood glucose level 40-69 mg/dL ) patient outcome . Incidences moderate hypoglycemia prevalent severe hypoglycemia . The risk develop ( severe moderate ) hypoglycemia hamper , least part , broad implementation blood glucose control insulin , particular aim normal blood glucose level [ 17,18 ] . Recent study show also significant association glycemic variability patient outcome . BG control algorithm , properly apply , could decrease glycemic variability . Experimentally , rodent experiment show brain damage associate duration severe hypoglycemia , instead correction ( mainly overcorrection ) intravenous dextrose cause formation radical . Hence , close glucose monitoring prevent overcorrection mandatory . These different argument strongly support need reliable accurate CGM . The GlucoClearTM Continuous Glucose Monitoring system Edwards Lifesciences measure blood sugar Glucose Oxidase Sensing Technology in-blood measurement . Blood automatically draw analyzed every 5 minute peripheral venous catheter , real time graphical display . Blood return patient system automatically self-calibrates . The GlucoClear CGM design highly accurate . In recent study perform critically ill patient , show comply require standard quality . The main research question address present study : `` To extent CGM-guided strategy improve quality BG control performance '' ?</detailed_description>
