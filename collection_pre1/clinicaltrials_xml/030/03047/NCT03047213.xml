	<brief_summary>This pilot phase II trial study well sapanisertib work treat patient bladder cancer spread start nearby tissue lymph node ( locally advance ) place body ( metastatic ) tuberous sclerosis ( TSC ) 1 and/or TSC2 mutation ( change deoxyribonucleic acid [ DNA ] ) . Sapanisertib may stop growth tumor cell block enzymes need cell growth .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Sapanisertib Treating Patients With Locally Advanced Metastatic Bladder Cancer With TSC1 and/or TSC2 Mutations</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To determine overall response rate ( ORR ) define complete response ( CR ) partial response ( PR ) patient locally advance metastatic transitional cell carcinoma ( TCC ) harbor TSC1 mutation . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . To evaluate safety tolerability sapanisertib ( MLN0128 ) ( TAK-228 ) patient locally advance metastatic TCC harbor TSC1 TSC2 mutation . II . To evaluate progression free survival ( PFS ) overall survival ( OS ) . TERTIARY OBJECTIVES : I . To determine ORR patient locally advance metastatic TCC harbor TSC2 mutation . II . To evaluate toxicity , PFS , OS TSC2 mutation patient . OUTLINE : Patients receive sapanisertib orally ( PO ) daily ( QD ) day 1-28 . Courses repeat every 28 day absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . After completion study treatment , patient follow 4 week every 6 month thereafter .</detailed_description>
