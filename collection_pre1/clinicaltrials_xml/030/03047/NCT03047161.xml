	<detailed_description>Purpose Fetal research clinical practice hamper lack suitable investigational technique . Currently , ultrasound widely use method study fetal anatomy physiology , significant limitation assessment cardiac rhythm . The purpose propose study utilize fMCG , magnetic analog fetal ECG , characterize heart rate rhythm pattern fetus fetal arrhythmia risk fetal arrhythmia . The study intend pivotal study . The subject device already clear clinical use record fetal rhythm ; however , FDA determine IDE require propose study . The study expect last approximately 5 year The Tristan 624 house within magnetically shielded room Biomagnetism Laboratory locate within Wisconsin Institutes Medical Research University Wisconsin-Madison campus . Protocol Facilities The UW Biomagnetism Lab locate within Wisconsin Institutes Medical Research , state-of-the-art translational research facility adjacent UW Hospitals Clinics . The study sponsor , Ronald Wakai , PhD , Professor Medical Physics , Laboratory Director . Within laboratory , medical supervision provide Janette Strasburger , MD . The facility directly adjacent UW Hospital . An emergency response plan place facility Biomagnetism Lab . In study 700 pregnancy thus far , emergency response plan need . Subject cohort The investigator plan study total 150 subject : 50 pregnant woman uncomplicated pregnancy 100 pregnant woman pregnancy complicate fetal arrhythmia condition put fetus risk fetal arrhythmia . These case consider `` high-risk '' due presence risk serious arrhythmia fetus . It take approximately 5 year start data collection recruit subject collect analyze data . The pregnant mother age 18 old . They study early 15 week ' gestation may ask return every 4 week , physician determines additional fMCG study necessary . Inclusion criterion normal subject . The pregnant woman subject must least 12 week pregnant least 18 year old . They must uncomplicated pregnancy . Exclusion criterion normal subject . The pregnant woman subject exclude earlier 12 week pregnant young age 18 . The 510 ( k ) summary list exclusion use subject device . Inclusion criteria high-risk subject . The pregnant woman subject must least 15 week pregnant least 18 year old . The primary inclusion criterion diagnosis serious fetal arrhythmia , define sustain low high heart rate . Low heart rate , bradycardia , high heart rate , tachycardia , base normative value gestation ( usually 110 -120 beats/min , 160-180 beats/min ) . Intermittent bradycardia tachycardia frequent and/or complex ectopy ( irregular rhythm ) also important detect arrhythmia may become incessant course pregnancy implication patient management . Abnormal repolarization , long QT syndrome ( LQTS ) , another important class arrhythmia . Fetuses family history LQTS suspicious rhythm ( low heart rate , intermittent AV block , ventricular tachycardia ) also study . Exclusion criteria high-risk subject . The pregnant woman subject exclude earlier 15 week pregnant young age 18 . High-risk subject participate physician grant permission participate study . Again , 510 ( k ) summary list exclusion use subject device . Recruitment method - Women age 18 older uncomplicated pregnancy recruit place poster local perinatal clinic . When prospective subject call , study describe ask high-risk condition might affect participation . If issue arise , Dr. Wakai consultation Dr. Strasburger determine whether appropriate study . Informed consent obtain time study Dr. Wakai one associate . Normal subject invite return follow session 5 time . - Pregnancies complicate fetal arrhythmia risk fetal arrhythmia recruit Dr. Janette Strasburger , Medical College Wisconsin . She screen subject , explain procedure , counsel , recruit study prior refer Dr. Wakai . These patient already clinically evaluate anticipated advertising participant post flyer require . In addition patient Madison , Milwaukee Chicago , high-risk patient across country may enrol study . In case patient 's physician contact investigator he/she believe fMCG may beneficial clinical care . These high-risk subject screen appropriateness Dr. Strasburger , consult patient 's physician order determine whether risk travel Madison reasonable . Informed consent obtain time study Biomagnetism Lab Dr. Wakai one associate . - There inclusion exclusion criterion base race ethnicity . Informed Consent - Informed consent requirement regulation relate informed consent follow . Informed consent obtain prior perform study-related activity . - Prior signing consent form , subject give tour lab , experimental procedure describe , question answer . For subject , consent HIPAA authorization obtain PI one representative time study . Subject preparation The subject ask remove metal magnetic object ( e.g . watch , glass , jewelry , coin ) person change patient gown . The subject lie patient table magnetically shield room throughout study . An intercom system allow verbal communication time subject observed aperture room . Data Acquisition Ultrasound . An ultrasound exam perform Dr. Strasburger assess heart rhythm fetus . The exam perform accord American Society Echocardiography ( ASE ) standard fetal arrhythmia . fMCG record . The SQUID detector place maternal abdomen near location fetal heart . Several 10-minute recording make , reposition detector recording , Data analysis . fMCG After recording digitally filter band-limit signal , signal processing technique apply remove maternal interference . Maternal heart rate evaluate . The fetal QRS complex detect use autocorrelation . Fetal heart rate tracing calculate RR interval , actogram tracing derive instantaneous amplitude QRS complex , change response fetal trunk movement . Averaged fMCG waveform compute increase signal-to-noise ratio . The data organize report . The report consist 1 ) fetal heart rate actogram tracing , 2 ) average fMCG waveform , 3 ) fMCG rhythm strip . Rhythm interpretation clinical diagnosis base assessment data . The fetal heart rate tracing use identify period abnormal heart rate , correspond bradycardia , tachycardia , ectopy . The fetal heart rate tracing actograms use assess heart rate reactivity , association fetal heart rate acceleration fetal movement . The fetal heart rate tracing also use assess fetal heart rate variability high precision . The averaged waveform use measure waveform intervals—PR , QRS , QTc—which use detect abnormality AV conduction , ventricular conduction , repolarization . The interval define way ECG : PR interval measure onset P-wave onset QRS complex ; QRS interval measure duration QRS complex ; QT interval measure onset QRS complex termination T-wave ; correct QT interval , QTc , correct QT interval heart rate divide square root RR interval , measure second . The interval compare historical norm . The rhythm strip use diagnose rhythm abnormality similar way ECG , base timing morphology waveform component . For fetal arrhythmia high-risk subject , result interpret Dr. Strasburger , send report discus result refer physician . In order protect confidentiality subject , data send electronic file label identification number , refer physician Drs . Strasburger make aware identity subject ( patient ) .</detailed_description>
