	<brief_title>CB-839 + Azacitidine Treatment Myelodysplastic Syndrome ( MDS )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Study Drug Administration : Every study cycle 28 day . - Participant take CB-839 mouth 2 time per day participant study . Participant take dose food , 12 hour apart . - Participant receive azacitidine vein 10-40 minute , injection skin 1 hour take CB-839 Days 1-7 every cycle . If need , participant may receive azacitidine participant 's local doctor 's office . It important participant tell study doctor drug participant take study . This include prescription drug , over-the-counter drug , natural herbal medicine , alternative medicine , vitamin . Length Study : Participant may continue take study drug long doctor think participant 's best interest . Participant longer able take study drug disease get bad , intolerable side effect occur , participant unable follow study direction . Participation study End-of-Study visit . Study Visits : Participant may visit participant 's regular home doctor study visit PD PK test take place . However , participant need come MD Anderson Day 1 cycle order get participant 's supply CB-839 . On Day 1 Cycle 1 : - Participant physical exam . - Blood ( 2 tablespoon ) draw routine test pharmacokinetic ( PK ) test dose CB-839 . PK test measure amount study drug body different time point . - Participant two EKGs within 2-4 hour dose . On Days 8 , 15 , 22 Cycle 1 : - Participant physical exam . - Blood ( 2 tablespoon ) draw routine testing . On Day 1 Cycles 2 3 , Day 15 Cycle 1 , blood ( 1 tablespoon ) drawn PK test dose . Participant take morning dose CB-839 home clinic visit . On Day 1 Cycle 2 beyond : - Participant physical exam . - Blood ( 1 tablespoon ) drawn routine biomarker testing , include genetic biomarkers . Biomarkers find blood/tissue may relate participant 's reaction study drug . Participant bone marrow biopsy aspirate biomarker pharmacodynamic ( PD ) test check status disease Day 1 Cycles 2 , 4 , 6 , every 3 cycle . PD test measure level study drug participant 's body may affect disease . End-of-Study Visit : Within 28 day last dose study drug : - Participant physical exam . - Blood ( 2 tablespoon ) draw routine test . - Participant EKG . - Participant bone marrow biopsy aspirate biomarker PD testing . Participant may also blood ( 2 tablespoon ) draw sample instead . - If participant become pregnant , blood ( 1 tablespoon ) urine collect pregnancy test . This investigational study . CB-839 FDA approve commercially available . It currently use research purpose . Azacitidine FDA approve commercially available treatment MDS . Its use combination CB-839 investigational . The study doctor explain study drug design work . Up 46 participant enrol study . All take part MD Anderson .</detailed_description>
