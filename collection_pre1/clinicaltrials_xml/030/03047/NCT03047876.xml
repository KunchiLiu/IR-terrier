	<brief_summary>Many neonate infant undergo complex cardiac surgery affect neurological developmental delay . Whilst catastrophic event immediately identifiable clinical examination macro change MRI CT scan , small change often immediately visible detect . This observational pilot study examine brain vascular reaction hypothermic circulatory arrest antegrade cerebral perfusion neuro-protection technique aortic arch surgery neonates infant . A combination duplex ultrasound transcranial doppler use record in-depth information cerebrovascular change occur entire length surgical procedure early postoperative period . The propose technique equipment non-invasive use clinically evaluate brain perfusion similar age group . During aortic arch surgery , patient 's body brain temperature reduce value 18 24 degree centigrade order decrease metabolic demand provide form metabolic protection . However , consensus within clinical community regard optimal temperature perform surgery . Moreover , order improve cerebral perfusion , brain perfuse via right internal carotid artery cold blood . At Alder Hey Children Hospital , surgery undertaken three surgeon , due clinical preference , differs relation temperature surgery undertaken . This provide opportunity observe impact different temperature cerebral vascular reactivity neonate young infant The argument future comparison large randomise study make base information gain observational study .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Brain Vascular Reactivity Hypothermic Circulatory Arrest With Antegrade Cerebral Perfusion During Aortic Arch Surgery</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Children undergone cardiac surgery high risk neurological disability . Adequate cerebral perfusion surgery paramount minimise risk brain injury well-documented complication . Whilst easily identifiable brain image post-operatively , less known intracerebral vascular reactivity arise due inadequate cerebral perfusion immediately follow surgery may result long-term neurological deficit . Some change observe solely long term evaluation childhood behaviour , see Boston Circulatory Arrest Trial . Aortic arch surgical repair surgery perform acynotic patient condition like Hypoplastic Aortic Arch Interrupted Aortic Arch , cyanotic patient diagnosis Hypoplastic Left Heart Syndrome , single ventricle repair undertaken mean Norwood type operation . Aortic arch surgery perform aid cardiopulmonary bypass require stop body 's circulation time employ repair aortic arch . In order provide protection body brain , patient 's temperature reduce 18-25C minimise metabolic requirement . This particularly important brain circulation stop operate aortic arch bloodless field . In recent year , technique aim preserve brain perfusion circulatory arrest develop . Antegrade cerebral perfusion cold blood ( 18-25C ) via right internal carotid artery successfully employ routinely use Alder Hey Children 's Hospital . Nevertheless , target brain temperature , rate cooling , perfusion pressure PCO2 arterial blood significantly influence cerebral vascular reactivity perfusion . The optimal temperature ensure neuroprotection currently unknown temperature cool base surgeon preference rather solid evidence . Currently , clinical practice UK employ near infrared spectroscopy ( NIRS ) index cerebral perfusion . Whilst simple non-invasive tool , measure oxygen level frontal lobe , purely indicative oxygenation , absorption oxygen cerebral tissue . An injured brain continue show normal level saturation NIRS despite hypoxia ( lack oxygen ) induce injury . Novel image technique available provide in-depth information real time cerebral perfusion quantify magnitude change follow surgery child . One research study employ Transcranial Doppler monitor cerebral velocity aortic arch surgery whilst cardiopulmonary bypass aim maintain cerebral velocity surgery level similar cooling . More recently , duplex ultrasound image cerebral vessel fontanelle employ obtain perfusion data hemisphere brain aortic arch surgery . Taken together , measurement technique provide unique novel insight cerebrovascular change occur surgical post-operative period .</detailed_description>
