	<brief_summary>The study design evaluate effectiveness novel kinematic biofeedback system - SWORD Phoenix- rehabilitation total knee replacement . SWORD Phoenix allow patient perform independent rehabilitation session home , remote monitoring clinical team . The investigator hypothesize clinical outcome home-based rehabilitation program least similar outcome traditional home-based rehabilitation face-to-face session . This randomize controlled trial active comparator . Patients enrol randomized pre-operatively 2 group : intervention group control group . Both group perform 8 week rehabilitation start day 7 surgery . The intervention group perform daily rehabilitation session home use SWORD Phoenix , remote monitor physical therapist . The control group perform 1h rehabilitation session 3 time week , home , give physical therapist . Outcomes measured week 4 8 . The primary outcome performance Timed-up-and-Go ( TUG ) test patient comparison pre-operative score . Secondary outcome measure term : ) range motion knee joint ( flexion/extension ) ; b ) Knee Osteoarthritis Outcome Score ) ; c ) quality life , measure SF-36 scale .</brief_summary>
