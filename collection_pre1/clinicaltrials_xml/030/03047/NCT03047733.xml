	<brief_summary>OBJECTIVE : To investigate efficacy cyclic on-off treatment compare conventional continuous excimer laser treatment . DESIGN : A randomized , control , split-body , non-inferiority study . SETTING : The trial perform two tertiary health care center Korea . PARTICIPANT : Twelve patient ( 16 pair lesion ) stable symmetric vitiligo le 5 year ' disease duration enrol . INTERVENSION : The paired symmetric vitiliginous lesion randomize either continuous cyclic on-off treatment . All lesion treat twice weekly 9-month : continuously , cyclically 2-month treatment 1-month intermission ( total 3 cycle ) . Topical tacrolimus apply throughout trial . OUTCOME MEASURES : The repigmentation assess use image analysis program clinical photograph . The primary outcome mean difference repigmentation rate non-inferiority margin set 10 % . During intermission period , clinical change loss repigmentation worsen vitiligo lesion assess .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>[ Study design population ] A randomized , control , split-body , non-inferiority trial design . After obtain informed consent , 12 patient stable symmetric vitiligo le 5 year ' disease duration enrol . The patient take systemic steroid enlarge lesion exclude . The paired symmetric vitiliginous lesion randomize either continuous cyclic excimer laser treatment . Total duration study 9 month . In cyclic excimer laser treatment , cycle arbitrarily determine one cycle consist 2-month treatment period ( ) consecutive 1-month intermission period ( ) ( total 3 cycle trial ) . [ Treatment protocol ] The lesion treat twice week . Initial irradiation dose 50 mJ/cm2 face 100 mJ/cm2 trunk extremity . If minimal asymptomatic erythema , energy level escalate 50 mJ/cm2 . In cyclic treatment , treatment resume intermission previously use irradiation dose . Topical tacrolimus 0.1 % ointment apply twice daily throughout whole length trial . [ Assessment primary outcome ] Photographic documentation lesion conduct every month degree repigmentation assess repigmentation rate ( % ) baseline use image analysis program ( Digital Researcher Vitiligo Area Evaluation , Dr. VAE , Korea ) . An intention-to-treat analysis plan , last observation carry forward method apply impute miss value presence dropout . The primary outcome mean difference quantitative change repigmented area continuous cyclic on-off treatment . The non-inferiority margin set 10 % . During intermission period cyclic treatment , clinical change loss repigmentation worsen vitiligo lesion assess . [ Statistical analysis ] All statistical analysis conduct use R 3.2.4 ( R Foundation Statistical Computing , Austria ) P value &lt; 0.05 consider statistically significant .</detailed_description>
