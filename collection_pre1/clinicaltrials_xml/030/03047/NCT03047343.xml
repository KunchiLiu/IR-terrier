	<brief_summary>Pulmonary artery strap surgical technique aim provide palliative treatment newborn suffer congenital heart defect , characterized increase blood flow pulmonary blood pressure . The intervention consist place band around pulmonary artery . This band cause artificial stenosis , therefore induce reduction pulmonary arterial pressure . It act first step , prepare ground future definitive repair intervention . It mainly use context septal defect , atrio-ventricular canal defect uni-ventricular heart . The complication link strap include , among others , erosion band artery lumen , migration obstruction pulmonary artery , pulmonary valvular insufficiency , obstruction coronary artery ineffective strapping . The early mortality rate pulmonary artery strapping 1980 vary 1.8 % 13.6 % , strap readjustment rate oscillate around 20 % . It assume mortality link nature cardial malformation ( uni-ventricular bi-ventricular ) rather procedure . This retrospective study aim evaluate intra-hospital extra-hospital mortality rate pulmonary artery strapping , well readjustment rate within two group patient : benefit uni-ventricular cardiac reparation benefit bi-ventricular cardiac reparation . The aim determine short term mortality rate intervention incidence complication within hospital , within two group .</brief_summary>
