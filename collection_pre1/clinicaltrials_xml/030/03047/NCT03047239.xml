	<detailed_description>Glaucoma subject select base schedule appointment ( consecutive selection ) clinic record patient database ( convenience selection ) invite participate study . After sign date informed consent form , receive appointment screen visit , undergo ophthalmic examination review medical ophthalmic history well prior current treatment . The eye high risk disease progression select study eye eligible . On study day 0 ( SD0 ) , subject receive TF 24-hour record profile ocular dimensional change , start 11 3 pm , simultaneous record 24-hour blood pressure ( BP ) . The recording carry ambulatory condition subject pursue close normal daily activity possible . Subject activity capture logbook . After completion recording , subject receive ophthalmic exam exclude adequately address side effect provide logbook investigator . At 3-month interval follow TF record 2 year TF recording , follow-up visit schedule assessment visual field ( VF ) , retinal nerve fiber layer ( RNFL ) thickness optical coherence tomography ( OCT ) , optic disc photo intraocular pressure ( IOP ) . 24-hour TF recording ( start time SD0 ) perform 1 2 year , glaucoma subject undergo glaucoma surgery follow-up period , additional 24-hour TF profile record approximately 3 month intervention ( start time SD0 ) .</detailed_description>
