	<brief_title>The Functional Status Anterior Cruciate Ligament Reconstruction ( ACLR ) Patients Discharge From Rehabilitation</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Aims : 1 ) To investigate subjective measure , objective measure , functional performance psychological factor ACLR patient discharge rehabilitation . Hypothesis : 1-a There difference ACLR patient discharge rehabilitation , return sport criterion leg symmetry index ( LSI ≥ 85 % ) , functional performance single-hop distance test 1-b There difference ACLR patient discharge rehabilitation , return sport criterion leg symmetry index ( LSI ≥ 85 % ) , objective measure quadriceps hamstring isometric muscle strength test . 1-c There difference ACLR patient discharge rehabilitation , return sport criterion ( LSI ≥ 85 % ) subjective measure self-reported knee function ( KOOS ) ( IKDC ) 1-d There difference psychological factor anterior cruciate ligament return sport injury scale ( ACL-RSI ) ACLR patient discharge rehabilitation cut-off score return sport ( score ˃ 63 ) . 1-e There difference psychological factor Tampa scale kinesiophobia ACLR patient discharge rehabilitation cut-off score fear movement ( score ≤ 37 ) . 2 ) To investigate relationship self-reported knee function , isometric muscle strength , single-hop test psychological factor post ACL reconstruction . Hypothesis : 2-a There correlation self-reported knee function isometric muscle strength ACLR patient discharge rehabilitation . 2-b There correlation self-reported knee function single-hop test ACLR patient discharge rehabilitation . 2-c There correlation self-reported knee function psychological factor ACLR patient discharge rehabilitation . 2-d There correlation isometric muscle strength single-hop test ACLR patient discharge rehabilitation . 2-e There correlation isometric muscle strength psychological factor ACLR patient discharge rehabilitation . 2-f There correlation single-hop test psychological factor ACLR patient discharge rehabilitation . Study Procedure After participant confirm interested study , see rehabilitation class regular hospital appointment . During participant ' last visit rehabilitation department , briefed study , agree partake , ask sign consent form . Self-reported knee function The participant ask complete Knee injury Osteoarthritis Outcome Score ( KOOS ) questionnaire symptom , stiffness , pain , function daily living , function sport sand recreational activity quality life , The International Knee Documentation Committee subjective knee form ( IKDC ) questionnaire , assess symptom , function , sport activity . Psychological factor The participant ask complete The Tampa Scale Kinesiophobia ( fear movement ) ( TSK ) questionnaire ass pain related fear movement follow Anterior Cruciate ligament Return Sport Injury ( ACL-RSI ) scale , questionnaire measure athletes ' emotion , confidence performance , risk appraisal concern return sport follow ACL injury . A demographics form ( age , height weight ) also complete . Isometric muscle strength To gather isometric muscle strength data participant , data isometric muscle strength leg obtain use two different test knee extensor knee flexor muscle , use hand-held dynamometer ( HHD ) . The participant ask wear sport clothing . The strength low limb participant assess use HHD , peak force measure throughout five second muscle contraction . Quadriceps muscle measure first request participant sit edge treatment bed knee 90 degree flexion foot ground . The participant ask apply maximum force extend knee joint HHD device , fix use belt place front leg proximal ankle joint . They ask five second , repeat three time 30 second rest . The maximum peak force record throughout three trial . To measure hamstring muscle , participant instruct sit edge treatment bed 90 degree ' flexion knee foot ground . Then , participant instruct apply maximum force flex knee joint immovable HHD device fix belt place back leg proximal ankle joint . They ask five second , repeat three time 30 second rest . Maximum peak force record throughout three trial . Functional tasks Participants request perform single-leg hop distance , assess use standard metric tape measure . A 3m strip tape place floor , start line label use 0.3m strip tape place perpendicular 3m strip tape . The participant perform three practice trial hop test . After finish practice trial , four test trial ask perform single leg hop distance describe ( Bolgla Keskula , 1997 ) . Attempts classify successful provide participant hop land full stability one leg three second . The participant require achieve four maximum hop attempt complete stabilisation land three second . Attempts deem unsuccessful participant hop touch ground leg landing , fail hop within limited marked distance ; fail hop count note , process . The participant 's leg length measure lie supine position first test use standard tape measure measure anterior superior iliac spine ( ASIS ) distal tip medial malleolus . Leg length use data analysis normalise excursion distance . The participant begin toe start line , stand one leg , hop far horizontally land leg , distance hop record . The hop data normalise limb length divide distance cover participant 's leg length multiply 100 , result percentage value . After complete test , participant ask repeat procedure leg .</detailed_description>
	<criteria>Inclusion criterion : In order eligible study must meet following : 1 . Aged 18 40 year old . 2 . Adult unilateral ACL injury ACL reconstruction . 3 .
