	<brief_summary>Olaparib demonstrate preliminary efficacy metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer . In trial 49 evaluable patient treat olaparib , 11 / 49 experience PSA response , every patient radiographic response also PSA5 response . Ten 11 responder mutation DNA repair gene . While PARP inhibition show promise initial study , reserve use end-stage patient may optimal time olaparib therapy patient . In addition , PARP enzymes function role beyond DNA repair , specifically prostate cancer involve transcriptional regulation androgen receptor . PARP inhibition test early disease state prostate cancer .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The propose study open-label single-arm phase II trial . Eligible patient non-metastatic biochemically-recurrent prostate cancer PSADT ≤6 month minimum PSA 1.0 . After enrollment , patient treat olaparib establish dose 300mg tablet mouth twice daily . Patients follow monthly clinic visit , safety lab ( include CBC w/diff , Comp ) , PSA , toxicity assessment . Treatment [ minimum drug exposure 12 week ] continue PSA double study entry ( confirm another measurement least 4 week later ) , development radiographic metastatic disease , toxicity require drug cessation . CT scan NM bone scan perform every 6 month patient remain olaparib treatment . This study enroll 50 subject . The study design employ stepwise adaptive statistical plan , derive part Biankin et al , Nature 2015 Oct 15 ; 526 ( 7573 ) :361-70 . The design adapt multi-stage design , interim stopping rule determine futility need enrichment study population . The study initiate two-stage design unselected population . The assumption trial unselected population : null hypothesis 0.1 PSA response rate alternative hypothesis 0.3 unselected population . The first stage 20 subject . If ≤2 subject respond first stage , unselected population study halt futility assessment DNA mutation present initial cohort undertaken . If less 3 subject known/suspected deleterious mutation follow gene ( ATM , BARD1 , BRCA1 , BRCA2 , BRIP1 , CDK12 , CHEK1 , CHEK2 , FANCL , PALB2 , PPP2R2A , RAD51B , RAD51C , RAD51D , DNA repair gene ) accrue first stage , trial proceed enrichment . If 3 subject known/suspected deleterious mutation gene interest accrue , trial proceed enrichment , long response rate subset subject ≥20 % . In case 3 subject accrue , yet response rate subset &lt; 20 % , trial halt futility . However , ≥3 subject among first 20 respond , additional 10 unselected subject accrue . If ≥6 subject respond 30 unselected population second stage , null hypothesis reject unselected population broad efficacy conclude . The trial proceeds complete accrual 50 subject order well estimate PSA response rate strengthen data correlative study . If &lt; 6 respond , null hypothesis reject . Again , less 3 subject known/suspected deleterious mutation follow gene ( ATM , BARD1 , BRCA1 , BRCA2 , BRIP1 , CDK12 , CHEK1 , CHEK2 , FANCL , PALB2 , PPP2R2A , RAD51B , RAD51C , RAD51D , DNA repair gene ) accrue first second stage combine , trial proceed enrichment . If 3 subject mutation accrue , enrichment proceed long response rate subject subject ≥20 % .</detailed_description>
