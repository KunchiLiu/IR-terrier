	<detailed_description>Protocol Title : Avelumab patient newly diagnose Glioblastoma Multiforme Indication : Patients newly diagnose Glioblastoma Multiforme Study Type : Single center , phase 2 , open label , addition avelumab standard therapy Objectives Primary Objectives : To determine safety tolerability avelumab administer 10mg/kg IV q2weeks patient receive standard therapy newly diagnose GBM . Secondary objective : To determine impact addition avelumab dose 10mg/kg IV Q2weeks patient receive standard therapy newly diagnose GBM overall survival ( OS ) , progression free survival ( PFS ) antitumor activity parameter accord immunotherapy Response Assessment Neuro-Oncology ( iRANO ) ( 1 ) 52 week . Exploratory objective : To explore biomarkers could predict treatment response avelumab : tumor immunoscore , presence extent PD-L1 expression tumor cell microglia/macrophages within tumor To correlate OS PFS relation change baseline end study neurocognitive function measure evoked potential P300 ( normal ) , baseline corticosteroid dose , average daily corticosteroid dose whole study duration , tolerability reason complete temozolomide standard 6 monthly pulse therapy presence severity immune related adverse event ( irAE 's ) . To assess compare mention biomarkers tissue sample patient second surgical resection ie treatment failure . To assess GBM population duration pseudoprogression lagtime need immunotherapy become effective . Study Design : This single center , phase 2 , open label , add-on , single dose study patient receive standard therapy newly diagnose GBM . In total 30 patient meet entry criterion enter study within 3 week finish last day combine radiotherapy/temozolamide . Avelumab initiate concurrently initiation first 5 day , monthly cycle temozolamide continue total 52 week . A local pathology report constitute adequate documentation histology study inclusion . The tumor block use diagnosis GBM must collect patient sent MGMT assessment ( already do ) , biomarker immunoscore analysis . The availability sample mandatory randomization study , must send within 2 month patient 's entry study analysis . Paraffin embed block contain formalin-fixed tumor tissue representative glioblastoma diagnosis preferred sample ( available , sufficient quality ) , otherwise , partial tumor block , pathology material sent . If surgery perform biopsy perform ( possible send FFPE tumor tissue block ) least 10 unstained , uncovered slide must send . The study consist 3 different phase : Combination Phase , Monotherapy Phase Extended Safety Follow-up Phase Combination Phase : Upon completion standard combination therapy radiotherapy ( total dose 60 Gy , administer daily 2Gy fraction , 5 days/week ) temozolomide ( 75 mg/m2/day p.o . qd ) treatment break 21 day , combination phase start . Patients receive temozolomide avelumab 6 cycle 28 day . During 1st cycle Temozolomide give first 5 day dose 150mg/m2/day p.o . In next cycle , temozolomide dose escalated 200/mg/m2 permit patient 's hematological non-hematological toxicity profile ( per NCI-CTC AE version 3 ) . The temozolomide dose adjust accord hematological non-hematological toxicity per temozolomide 's product monograph ( appendix 4 ) . Avelumab administer day 1 day 15 cycle dose 10mg/kg IV . Avelumab therapy withhold accord occurrence severity avelumab related adverse event per table 3 . Patients continue combination temozolomide ( 150-200mg/m2 per day PO X5 day Q28days ) avelumab ( 10mg/kg dose , IV day 1 15 per cycle ) 6 cycle complete confirmed disease progression unacceptable ( grade 3 high ) avelumab relate toxicity occur . Monotherapy Phase : Upon completion Combination Phase upon stop temozolomide temozolomide related toxicity patient continue avelumab Monotherapy Phase . Avelumab 10mg/kg IV Q2weeks continue monotherapy total 52 week avelumab receive evidence confirm disease progression per iRANO definition unacceptable ( grade 3 high ) avelumab relate toxicity occur . Patients experience irAE 's may accord table 3 directive avelumab therapy suspend . The use Bevacizumab , second surgical resection re-irradiation allow study consider evidence disease progression . Patients promptly inform upon confirmation disease progression per new iRANO criterion . They offer pursue avelumab therapy per protocol withdraw therapy enter extend safety follow phase . Upon completion Monotherapy Phase week 52 patient offer option roll open label extension study receive commercial avelumab via special access program . Extended Safety Follow-up Phase : Patients discontinue avelumab therapy reason point study enter extended safety follow-up period 90 day . Treatment investigator local oncologist 's discretion . All subject observe possible occurrence delay irAE 's . Survival data information subsequent therapy collect . Tissue sample patient undergo second surgical resection obtain biomarker analysis .</detailed_description>
