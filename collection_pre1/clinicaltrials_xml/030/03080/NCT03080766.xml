	<brief_summary>Acute myeloid leukemia ( AML ) heterogeneous group diseases distinct clinicopathologic feature share common abnormal increase myeloblast blood bone marrow ( BM ) . In 5-10 % patient , myeloblast exhibit chromosomal abnormality ( complex and/or monosomal karyotype , CK/MK* ) associate refractoriness conventional chemotherapy extremely bad prognosis . Standard induction chemotherapy AML comprise daunorubicin cytarabine , `` 7+3 '' regimen . However , treatment largely ineffective CK/MK AML temporary clearance blast achieve 30-40 % case cumulative toxicity result repeated course chemotherapy significantly increase morbidity mortality risk subsequent allogeneic BMT . Therefore , standard treatment unsatisfactory unmet clinical need effective less toxic induction regimen . Both previous recent study show 10 day course decitabine ( 20 mg/m2/day ) induce remission 70-100 % patient CK/MK AML , particularly TP53 mutation . In study , patient CK/MK AML treat decitabine induce remission . Bone marrow examination perform course complete clearance blast disease progression . Patients achieve CR/CRi ( see ) continue receive 4 course , patient eligible BMT donor available receive curative BMT . We reckon time take 4 course decitabine suffice transplantation workup HK . . Patients ineligible BMT continue receive decitabine leukemia progression . The response rate , leukemia free survival ( LFS ) , overall survival ( OS ) percentage patient bridge BMT compare historical 7+3 regimen control .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>The Use Decitabine Induction Therapy Acute Myeloid Leukemia With Complex and/or Monosomal Karyotype</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This open-label interventional study study use decitabine induction therapy acute myeloid leukemia complex and/or monosomal karyotype . Subjects receive decitabine every 28 day , disease progression bone marrow transplantation carry , schedule : Cycle 1 : Receive decitabine 10 day Cycle 2 Cycle 3 : Based result bone marrow examination , subject may receive decitabine 5 day 10 day Cycle 4 disease progression : Rdecitabine 5 day . Subjects may also resume 10 day treatment cycle 6 physician judge appropriate . The drug administrate intravenously . Blood drawn every 7 day bone marrow extraction would do Day 28 ( +/- 3days ) day 1 cycle treatment examination .</detailed_description>
