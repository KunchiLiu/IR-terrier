	<brief_summary>The impact reduction daily physical activity ( DPA ) patient COPD ( chronic obstructive pulmonary disease ) highly studied area , due impact quality life clinical evolution disease . This fact multifactorial component : function naturally diminished time , effect loss physical condition ( decondition ) . However , dynamic hyperinflation respiratory muscular dysfunction , especially patient symptomatology , identify relevant factor impact daily physical activity Due detrimental effect pulmonary hyperinflation , diaphragm flatter shorter , position mechanical disadvantage . This contribute reduced effort capacity increase dyspnea patient daily activity . Resistance train improves exercise capacity reduces dyspnea , however improve inspiratory muscle strength . It reason , specific train inspiratory muscle , offer special interest patient decrease inspiratory muscle strength pulmonary hyperinflation .</brief_summary>
