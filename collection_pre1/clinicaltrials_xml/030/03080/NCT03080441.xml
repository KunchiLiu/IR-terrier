	<brief_title>Minimization Intradialytic Hypotension Using Cardiography-Guided Intervention</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The incidence intradialytic hypotension ( IDH ) event , report occur 15 % 50 % hemodialysis ( HD ) treatment , still high despite major technical advance HD technology . By definition , excessive reduction intravascular volume ultrafiltration limit vascular refill tissue vascular space cause IDH . Chronic HD patient exhibit high prevalence peripheral vascular cardiac abnormality . Specifically , hemodynamic instability HD occur due insufficient reduction venous unstressed volume , poor diastolic filling reduce atrial pressure associate diastolic dysfunction , alter cardiac contractility , impair vascular reactivity . An IDH event lead myocardial cerebral organ ischemia . Long- short-term adverse outcome associate IDH , common HD complication significant cause morbidity . Recent pilot study suggest IDH-prone subject , measurement hemodynamic variable HD use categorize hemodynamic response three subgroup : cardiac power index ( CPI ) reduction stable total peripheral resistance ( TPR ) , TPR reduction stable CPI , reduction TPR CPI group . It hypothesize target intervention subgroup reduce IDH .</detailed_description>
