	<brief_title>The Occurrence Post Dural Puncture Headache After Epidural Blood Patch</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Currently , spinal anesthesia commonly use cesarean section many institute , since safe technique mother child , high satisfaction obstetrician colleague .

However , procedure inevitable adverse event high spinal block , nerve injury postdural puncture headache ( PDPH ) . The PDPH cause accidental dura puncture result continuous cerebrospinal fluid ( CSF ) leakage gradual intracranial pressure reduction . This potential complication neuraxial anesthesia clinical practice . The needle characteristic bevel orientation , stylet reinsertion , approach , multiple insertion , operator experience , patient age , history previous PDPH , body mass index ( BMI ) &gt; 35 responsible factor incidence . Chan et al . reveal amongst 65,348 parturients , occurence PDPH 1.1-1.9 % , Bloom et al . propose number 0.4 % .

Other additional treatment include bed rest , analgesic , increase fluid intake , caffeine containing beverage . In severe case , retractable pain might good response intravenous caffeine epidural blood patch ( EBP ) . Though treatment PDPH include pharmacologic non-pharmacologic regimen , Cochrane review conclude EBP effective conservative treatment [ 6 ] . As result , investigator curious regard factor determine incidence postdural puncture headache parturients undergoing cesarean section epidural blood patch .</detailed_description>
