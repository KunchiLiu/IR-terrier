	<brief_summary>This research project look whether measure movement responses certain question help predict suicidal thought action . This project two part : The first part occur participant receive hospitalize Bedford VA Hospital . It involve wear watch-like device his/her wrist answering question task measure mood mental health symptom , suicidal thought . In second phase , investigator call participant around 12 month s/he leave hospital . The investigator discuss s/he s/he suicidal thought make suicidal act .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>The `` AIM Study '' : Investigating Whether Actigraphy Ideation Measures Can Promote Patient Safety</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>RESEARCH DESIGN : A prospective cohort study Veterans conduct determine previously-identified specific actigraphy-based measurement highly associate suicidal ideation non-Veterans predict suicidal ideation , suicidal behavior , and/or rehospitalization Veterans . METHODS : An analysis Veterans admit Bedford , Massachusetts VAMC acute psychiatry unit conduct . The primary analysis focus upon Veterans current suicidal ideation recent suicidal behavior ( SI/SB ) primary psychotic disorder , Alzheimer 's , Parkinson 's disease , undergo alcohol detoxification . A separate analysis conduct patient undergo alcohol detoxification , half SI/SB half without SI/SB . Participants wear small , unobtrusive , wristwatch-like actigraph nondominant wrist , complete self-rated clinician-rated assessment suicidal ideation , well self-rated assessment severity psychiatric symptom . A Resiliency Index ( RI ) calculate use nonlinear dynamic analysis amplitude movement time frame 6 minute - 2 hour . These time frame period clear structure movement data evident , patient suicidal ideation show less variation amplitude patient without suicidal ideation . If medication give alcohol detoxification determine interfere RI , secondary analysis examine entire sample Veterans . One Aim focus upon determine whether original Resiliency Index alternative movement data index , one base change movement data hospitalization , predict presence severity suicidal ideation among Veteran inpatient . This aim also examine sensitivity specificity RI detect presence suicidal ideation , substantial suicidal ideation . ( In non-Veterans , RI show sensitivity 72 % specificity 100 % detect suicidal ideation , 86 % 88 % , respectively , detect substantial ideation ) . In addition , investigator may determine whether RI predict subsequent suicidal behavior rehospitalization different time period within original 12 month followup period , alone combine data symptom severity , past history , present hospitalization .</detailed_description>
