PDPH cause significant short-term disability , prevents mobilisation , affect childcare activity result prolong hospital stay . Initial treatment involve painkiller patient fails respond , Epidural Blood Patch ( EBP ) . EBP involve take patient 's blood inject epidural space . It generally agree PDPH self-limiting condition resolve two week . However emerge evidence patient PDPH could increase risk develop longstanding ( chronic ) headache . Retrospective case study show 28 - 34 % patient develop PDPH longstanding headache 18 month insertion epidural . There also recent evidence new onset low back pain developing patient receive epidural blood patch perform treat PDPH . Nearly two third patient hospital UK new onset low back pain receive epidural blood patch treatment . Presently , prospective clinical study evaluate development longstanding headache new onset low back pain development PDPH . Aim present study evaluate incidence longstanding headache accidental dural ( ADP ) puncture incidence new onset low back pain epidural blood patch treatment . Methods : The propose study prospective , cohort study conduct three centre ( Leicester , Derby Sheffield ) 36 month . Index participant suffer ADP match control participant receive uneventful epidural insertion . The index control participant match age , body weight , parity type delivery . Mothers longstanding headache low back pain exclude form study . After provide write consent , participant provide questionnaire pack contain three set two questionnaire complete 6 , 12 18 month develop headache well stamp envelope return questionnaires research team . A research team member perform telephone follow 6 , 12 18 month encourage completion questionnaire . Participation study end 18 month completion study questionnaire .</detailed_description>
