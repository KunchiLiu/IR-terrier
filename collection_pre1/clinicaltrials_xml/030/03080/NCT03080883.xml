	<brief_title>Apixaban Preventing Secondary Cancer Related Blood Clots Cancer Patients Who Have Completed Anticoagulation Therapy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . Any episode major bleed include fatal bleeding clinically relevant non-major bleeding . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . The proportion patient experience least one bleeding event within 6 month begin treatment . II . Venous thromboembolism ( VTE ) recurrence include deep vein thrombosis ( DVT ) , pulmonary embolism ( PE ) , fatal PE , arterial thromboembolism . OUTLINE : Patients randomize 1 2 group . GROUP I : Patients receive low dose apixaban orally ( PO ) twice daily ( BID ) 365 day . GROUP II : Patients receive high dose apixaban PO BID 365 day . After completion study treatment , patient follow 12 month .</detailed_description>
