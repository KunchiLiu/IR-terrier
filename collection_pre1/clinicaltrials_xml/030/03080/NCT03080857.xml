	<detailed_description>Atrial fibrillation ( AF ) common sustain arrhythmia affect 1-2 % population western world , increase 10 % patient age 75 . The lifetime risk development AF 26 % men 23 % woman . It associate significant morbidity , mortality cost , also two-fold increase mortality six-fold risk stroke . Severity symptom AF may range 'nuisance ' feeling palpitation debilitate symptom affect quality life , interfere normal livelihood significantly impair exercise tolerance severe symptom ( hemodynamic compromise heart failure ) , associate poor prognosis increase mortality . Patients symptomatic pose great burden health care system , often make repeat visit emergency room treatment repeat hospitalization . AF know chronic disease . The majority patient progressively episodes AF , present persistent AF . As chronic disease , cure control effective treatment . AF often occur set disease , increase complexity determine appropriate therapy . Most often , AF occur set cardiovascular disease , obesity , diabetes , sleep apnea combination . In order effectively manage AF , 'holistic ' approach necessary . Appropriate management hypertension , sleep apnea , obesity , etc . part mainstay therapy AF . This part Canadian Cardiovascular Society ( CCS ) AF guideline recommendation state : `` underlying cause precipitate factor AF include hypertension identify treat '' . Current guideline suggest AF treatment focus strategy manage control heart rate rhythm . Exercise physical activity show improve outcome patient cardiac condition ( ischemic heart disease , myocardial infarction , congestive heart failure ) , effect AF still clear . The current Canadian health care system design address acute illness , rather chronic disease , impact hospitalization symptomatic AF . There AF clinic QEII Health Sciences Centre assist AF management patient see specialist . The investigator propose create , evaluate , refine implement virtual , patient-centered platform guide patient out-of-hospital management atrial fibrillation , evaluation specialist .</detailed_description>
