	<brief_summary>The purpose study investigate effect Astym® treatment , The Stick® treatment massage treatment performance among healthy college athlete investigate relationship functional movement functional performance . Participants recruit Division II , National Association Intercollegiate Athletics ( NAIA ) basketball volleyball team . The participant randomize one three group : Astym treatment ( AT ) , The Stick treatment ( ST ) massage treatment ( MT ) . The participant baseline measure vertical jump ( VJ ) , Y-Balance Lower Quarter Screen ( YBLQ ) , rating current perceive low extremity function use visual analog scale ( PLEF-VAS ) . The participant treat use either AT , ST , MT follow baseline measure . Immediately follow intervention , second measurement VJ , YBLQ , PLEF-VAS take place . The data analyze use mixed ANOVA test conduct dependent variable . In addition , functional movement think related functional performance . A Pearson Product Correlation analysis use understand relationship YBLQ VJ . It hypothesize AT group different percent change YBLQ , VJ , PLEF-VAS compare ST MT group . It hypothesize correlation YBLQ VJ exist . As result , clinician could use AT among basketball volleyball athlete without hinder acute performance . Any risk participant could encounter minimal . Participants may withdraw data time . The intervention test similar athlete would expose collegiate career . Any participant injure study refer university sport medicine staff , health center , Indiana Wesleyan University health center .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>All participant complete baseline testing , intervention , post intervention test single day . The total time participant complete entire study anticipate 1.5 2 hour . Upon arrival Athletic Training Clinic , participant 's demographic information collect . This information consist following : age , weight , height , percent body fat use standard seven site skinfold measurement . Other information record , sport , position , gender , year college sport experience , year school . The research team ensure participant dress appropriately athletic short T-shirt . Spandex® compression type garment allow worn time study . Once demographic information collect , full body warm initiate . Participants instruct warm bike 5 minute intensity 4 6 represent OMNI scale perceive exertion . This warm base guideline set forth American College Sports Medicine . Following warm , participant 's baseline measurement take order : Vertical Jump ( VJ ) , Y-Balance Lower Quarter ( YBLQ ) , rating Perceived Lower Extremity Function-Visual Analog Scale ( PLEF-VAS ) . Following baseline data collection , participant randomly assign intervention . One three treatment previously describe take place Athletic Training Clinic . An individual associate research committee research team conduct randomization . Immediately follow intervention , participant proceed performance evaluation test area post treatment test . The participant may elect bring one chaperon choose treatment area . Warm performance test order remain consistent participant follow order conduct baseline measure . Trained undergraduate research assistant , blind treatment allocation collect test data . The test data include : VJ , YBLQ , PLEF-VAS . The clinician ( doctoral candidate assist clinician ) provide Astym treatment ( AT ) , The Stick treatment ( ST ) , massage treatment ( MT ) present VJ , YBLQ , PLEF-VAS clinicians provide intervention present test area baseline test collection . Testing Procedures Participants perform VJ YBLQ Screen follow 5-minute-warm previously describe . The high jump three attempt record counter movement VJ . The long reach three attempt anterior , posteriolateral posteromedial direction record follow establish YBLQ protocol . Vertical Jump A Belt Mat ( University Toronto ; Toronto , Canada ) vertical jump measure device utilize study . The participant position mat belt place around waist . The belt tape measure run form belt mat . The participant ask stand erect establish 'zero ' . The participant jump vertically belt around waist pull remain tape measure . The vertical jump height record displacement tape measure . The participant propel vertically high possible . A preparatory stutter step use ; however , counter movement may use . A countermovement participant quickly flex knee hip move thorax forward downward swinging arm back . Three jump attempt give participant measurement take place attempt . Measurements record near half inch convert centimeter . The high measurement use analysis . Y Balance Lower Quarter Screen Testing procedure YBLQ ( Y Balance Test Kit , Move2Perform ; Evansville , IN ) follow protocol previously establish researcher The participant view two minute instructional video prior practice six reach three direction bilaterally : anterior , posteriormedial posteriorlateral . Following practice reach , participant stand Y Balance center footplate right foot behind start line . With free foot , participant reach anterior direction push indicator box far possible . Three successful measurement many six attempt reach direction record best , successful reach use analysis . The participant switch stance leg . The indicator box reset participant reach right foot anterior direction . This cycle continue posteromedial posterolateral direction . Successful reach participant maintain contact stance leg center footplate behind start line throughout reach attempt . Successful reach also include maintain contact indicator box reach attempt , use indicator box support , return start position control . The participant rest long take recorder reset indicator box log reach distance . Rating Perceived Lower Extremity Function The participant ask rate current perceive low extremity function 100mm line anywhere 'my function bad ' 'my function best . ' The participant rate place vertical line intersect 100mm horizontal line perpendicularly . A standard metric ruler use measure farthest leave intersecting line . This distance record .</detailed_description>
