	<detailed_description>Treatment anal incontinence ( AI ) remain challenge - although conservative treatment reduce severity many patient ' AI , many continue experience symptom severly affect quality life ability function properly socially professionally . The level AI measure St Marks score ( range 0-24 zero complete continence ) . Some patient AI show defect anal sphincter ( i.e . traumatic lesion post partum ) help reconstructive surgery . These procedure effective carry substantial risk postoperative infection , heal process painful . One main treatment option anal incontinence today Sacral Nerve Stimulation ( SNS ) , effective invasive expensive treatment rather high level infection . It normally perform two separate session require life-long follow new surgical procedure every 6-7 year . Historically artificial anal sphincter study show effective high rate infection lead removal device . In recent year study instead focus `` bulk agent '' ( injection i.e . silicone submucosal space aim increase rest pressure anal canal ) , effect seem limited agent inject rapidly resorb body . Treatment intersphincteric implant novel treatment option patient . Available study show good result regard effect low frequence postoperative infection . The implant rarely dislocate resorb body , contribute long-term effectiveness . The operation perform short general anaesthesia available study postoperative symptom . The first technique describe call Gatekeeper ( six implant ) , since complete Sphinkeeper ( ten implant ) , focus present study .</detailed_description>
