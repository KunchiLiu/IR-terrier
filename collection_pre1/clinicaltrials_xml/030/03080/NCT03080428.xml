	<brief_summary>The need/benefit adjuvant chemotherapy could negligible certain category patient newly diagnose unilateral non metastatic breast cancer . Physicians sometimes divide administration adjuvant treatment administration risk distant relapse 10 year around 10 % uncertainty theoretical benefit chemotherapy le 5 % 10 year accord guideline use center . Several genomic test develop last decade . These test use sample breast cancer tissue analyze activity group gene . Knowing whether certain gene present absent , overly active active enough , help physician predict risk recurrence . In addition standard pathological characteristic , genomic test could helpful make treatment decision , whether chemotherapy part treatment plan . First generation prognostic test currently widely use worldwide guide decision make regard adjuvant chemotherapy ( OncotypeDX™ Mammaprint® ) . Prognostic test reach level evidence 1A , result prospective randomized trial `` Mindact '' . In `` Mindact '' trial , among woman early-stage breast cancer high clinical risk low genomic risk recurrence , receipt chemotherapy basis 70-gene signature lead 5-year rate survival without distant metastasis 1.5 percentage point low rate chemotherapy . Given finding , approximately 46 % woman breast cancer high clinical risk might require chemotherapy . The health-economic value signatures general population patient localize breast cancer appear low current cost . Meanwhile , next generation prognostic signature develop integrated clinical parameter suggest high add value beyond standard traditional characteristic include tumor burden , grade , Estrogen Receptor ( ER ) Progesterone Receptor ( PR ) , Her2 , age also standard assessment proliferation . In study , clinical utility genomic test ( Endopredict® , Prosigna® , OncotypeDX® , Mammaprint® assay ) define impact chemotherapy decision adjuvant set patient ER-positive , Her2-negative early breast cancer uncertainty indication chemotherapy use standard assessment compare .</brief_summary>
