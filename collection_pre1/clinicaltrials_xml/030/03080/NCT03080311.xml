	<brief_summary>APG-1252 highly potent Bcl-2 family protein inhibitor , promise drug candidate show high binding affinity Bcl-2 , Bcl-xL Bcl-w . The preclinical study show APG-1252 alone achieves complete persistent tumor regression multiple tumor xenograft model twice weekly weekly dose-schedule , include SCLC , colon , breast ALL cancer xenograft ; achieve strong synergy chemotherapeutic agent , indicate APG-1252 may broad therapeutic potential treatment human cancer single agent combination class anticancer drug . APG-1252 intend treatment patient SCLC solid tumor . Upon completion Phase 1 dose escalation study establish maximum tolerate dose ( MTD ) , dose-limiting toxicity ( DLTs ) , and/or recommend phase 2 dose ( RP2D ) , several phase Ib/II study implement accordingly .</brief_summary>
