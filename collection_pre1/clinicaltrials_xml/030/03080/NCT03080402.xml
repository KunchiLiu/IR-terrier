	<brief_summary>A prospective trial use evaluate efficacy prophylactic mechanical perturbation training program . 24 female athlete regular participant activity involve cut , pivot , jumping , lateral movement prior injury range age 15-30 year eligible . Using prospective risk stratification design , female athlete knee abduction moment ( KAM ) &gt; 25.25 Nm drop jump motion analysis classify high KAM receive 12 session mechanically-driven perturbation train female athlete KAM &lt; 25.25 Nm drop jump motion analysis classify normal KAM participate baseline performance testing , follow 6 week later another session drop jump motion analysis performance testing .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Anterior cruciate ligament ( ACL ) injuries prevalent sport female athlete particularly high risk . Female athletes 2-4x high risk ACL injury compare male counterpart high-risk sport . Modifiable non-modifiable risk factor play role high incidence ACL injury female athlete . High knee abduction moment ( KAM ) , know modifiable risk factor ACL injury risk . Female athletes KAM great 25.25 Nm identify high risk ACL injury . The ability classify female athlete high risk ACL injury , highlight importance identify modifiable risk factor readily address physical therapist develop targeted treatment potentially reduce ACL injury risk improve functional performance . Neuromuscular training program treatment design help improve coordination , strength , control . Such training program design alter biomechanical neuromuscular measure , particular high KAM , order improve performance function thereby reduce risk ACL injury . Neuromuscular training program involve plyometric exercise reduce dynamic low extremity valgus limb-to-limb asymmetry healthy female athlete . Despite reduction injury rate see performance neuromuscular training program , incidence ACL injuries remain high acceptable . Novel train method currently development optimize current ACL injury prevention program . As unanticipated perturbation may contribute ACL injury risk , incorporate mechanical platform device provide unanticipated surface compliance change ( i.e . floor lower subject 's foot ) ACL injury prevention program potential optimize knee biomechanics neuromuscular performance , include unanticipated perturbation . Mechanical perturbation advocate effective training method modify sensorimotor system restore normal neuromuscular coordination expose subject control , progressive perturbation . Furthermore , mechanical perturbation potential improve dynamic postural stability control , enhance muscle activation pattern . One advantage mechanical perturbation device utilize perform variety dynamic task hop jumping compare static loading task stand balance activity . Dynamic task may place great demand knee joint , promote joint stability subject overcome perturbation . Additionally , mechanical perturbation may allow physical therapist administer random perturbation different phase activity ( i.e . subject land hop , taking-off jump ) simulate real-life perturbation occur different functional sporting activity . The goal study assess effectiveness intensive neuromuscular training program reduce risk factor associate ACL injury</detailed_description>
