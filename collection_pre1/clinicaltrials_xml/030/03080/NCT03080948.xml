	<detailed_description />
	<criteria>Patients ≥ 18 year age Highrisk nevus phenotype ( ≥ 50 nevi ≥ 1 atypical nevus ) First present MSKCC cutaneous melanomarelated care within past 12 month Cases : recent diagnosis ( ≤ 12 month ) unequivocal invasive cutaneous melanoma ( AJCC Stages IIV ) confirm MSKCC pathology Cases : completion surgical treatment primary melanoma Ability sign inform consent Known germline highpenetrance melanoma predisposition mutation ( , CDKN2A CDK4 ) Cases : history invasive cutaneous melanoma ( AJCC Stages IIV ) confirm MSKCC pathology , history acrolentiginous type cutaneous melanoma Cases : history systemic adjuvant therapy treatment metastatic melanoma , include : MEK inhibitor ( trametinib , cobimetinib , etc . ) , BRAF inhibitor ( vemurafenib , dabrafenib , etc . ) , immunotherapy ( pembrolizumab , nivolumab , atezolizumab , ipilimumab , etc. ) . Controls : history Stage 0IV melanoma confirm MSKCC pathology History limb amputation condition ( e.g. , tattoos , burn ) per investigator discretion would modify nevus phenotype Physical inability undergo total body photography reflectance confocal microscopy imaging ( , remain relatively still durations 35 minute ) Known hypersensitivity adhesive ring use reflectance confocal microscopy Inability give inform consent Have skin afflict anther skin condition ( example , psoriasis ) would affect ability characterize nevus phenotype ( per investigator discretion ) Familial cutaneous melanoma history ( family least one invasive melanoma two diagnosis invasive melanoma pancreatic cancer among first seconddegree relative side family ) . We confirm melanoma family history via medical record documentation , whenever possible , recommend previous study disprove half report family history melanoma among firstdegree relative casecontrol study .</criteria>
