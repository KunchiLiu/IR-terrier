	<brief_title>Do Achieve Goal `` No Worse Than Mild Pain '' Daily Clinical Practice ?</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>In contemporary postoperative pain management , patient treat combination non-opioid opioid analgesic , analgesic method . The intention enhance pain relief additive synergistic effect combination . However , literature complex heterogenic characterize small sized study investigate diversity analgesic combination method . Consequently well-documented `` best current proven intervention '' definable Efficacy analgesic often base result randomized trial measure difference two group base average pain level group , example median mean . This approach weaknesses individual patient vary response , average pain level actually experienced patient . Also , well know analgesic may work 30- 50 % patient possible predict experience excessive pain . Besides , data pain score follow normal distribution , usually either good bad . Studies demonstrate , basically , patient want efficient pain treatment large pain reduction ( example 50 % ) and/or pain level correspond mild pain , Numeric Rating Scale ≤ 3 . Pain treatment include achievement adequate pain relief likely fail . Consequently , new simple universal criterion postoperative analgesic success suggest base individual patient response analysis : Efficacy measure individual level , patient experience `` bad mild pain '' ( Numeric Rating Scale ≤ 3 ) . In re-calculation individual patient data 16 randomized clinical trial , investigator recently document use success criterion least 80 % patient achieve Visual Analogue Scale ≤ 30 , 50 % study achieve goal fulfillment . A current review document , movement evoke pain underreported . Only 39 % trial measure movement evoke pain even though trial measure movement evoke pain pain rest suggest movement evoke pain 95 % - 226 % severe intense patient pain rest . Therefore great importance benefit treatment patient , future trial record pain rest also movement evoke pain , additionally supply relevant information actual physical maneuver use assessment . It therefore essential , light `` bad mild pain '' , base individual responder analysis , investigate current benefit harm postoperative pain treatment . Our goal highlight need intensify focus individual patient 's pain investigator expect shed new critical light current clinical pain treatment .</detailed_description>
