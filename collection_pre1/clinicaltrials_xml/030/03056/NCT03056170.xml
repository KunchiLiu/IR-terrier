	<brief_summary>tDCS technique emerge prospective therapy neurologic , psychiatric addictive disorder . Specifically , fronto-temporal tDCS , anodal stimulation leave dorsolateral prefrontal cortex ( DLPFC ) cathodal stimulation leave temporo-parietal junction ( TPJ ) , report reduce treatment-resistant auditory hallucination ( AH ) , negative symptom insight illness schizophrenia . However , despite increase use clinical setting , tDCS suffers limitation , especially regard strength duration therapeutic effect . Some imaging report suggest tDCS effect restrict brain area locate electrode , spread distribute cortical network functionally connect target reach subcortical area . Overall , study suggest tDCS modulates functional connectivity within across resting-state network brain activity . However , effect currently describe different level depend imaging technique use . Moreover , majority study focus motor cortex stimulation , specific effect fronto-temporal tDCS scarce . Finally , effect stimulation apply online rarely inspect . According therapeutic effect fronto-temporal tDCS schizophrenia dopaminergic pathophysiological hypothesis schizophrenia , effect fronto-temporal tDCS dopaminergic transmission major interest . As cortex densely connect basal ganglion area , tDCS effect probably capable reach subcortical dopaminergic area . Indeed , recent fMRI study highlight subcortical effect tDCS applied cortical level include modulation cortico-striatal thalamo-cortical functional connectivity . In addition , study suggest cortical stimulation approach , transcranial magnetic stimulation ( rTMS ) modulate dopaminergic transmission . However , tDCS effect dopaminergic transmission investigate indirectly . Finally , information biological effect tDCS scatter create coherent ensemble mandatory critical step understand mechanism action tDCS . According hypothesis fronto-temporal tDCS modulates brain activity , connectivity dopaminergic transmission , aim project reveal combine neurobiological impact online single session fronto-temporal tDCS unique experiment develop simultaneous multimodal image approach ( PET-MRI ) . The online implementation stimulation allow decipher change induce stimulation . As first step investigate patient schizophrenia , healthy subject involve present study . The distributed change explore rest : - Spontaneous functional connectivity assess functional magnetic resonance imagery ( fMRI ) . - Brain activity assess cerebral blood flow quantitatively directly measure arterial spin labelling ( ASL ) . - Connectivity assessed diffusion tensor imaging ( DTI ) . - Specific localized dopaminergic transmission evaluate positron emission tomography ( PET ) use dopaminergic D2 subtype receptor availability via [ 11C ] raclopride binding . The pioneering aspect project use innovative simultaneous multimodal imaging system , adopt tDCS montage use validate therapeutic context apply tDCS online . We expect unique approach provide image biomarker essential improve understanding : 1. `` normal brain '' deficient mechanisms underlying schizophrenia well neurological disorder . 2. neurobiological effect tDCS order : - Bring key element proof concept tDCS - Optimize tDCS therapeutic context - Suggest marker therapeutic response</brief_summary>
