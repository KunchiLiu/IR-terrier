	<detailed_description>Pyruvate dehydrogenase complex ( PDC ) deficiencies major class mitochondrial disease , limit oxidation carbohydrate energy production , especially important brain . So far , definitive treatment disorder . This study , `` Natural History Advanced Genetic Study Pyruvate Dehydrogenase Complex Deficiencies , '' create database information collect long period time patient PDC deficiency . This database part exist North American Mitochondrial Disease Consortium ( NAMDC ) Patient Data Registry Biorepository database . The study collect data specific PDC deficiency , include data derive patients/families . Approximately 150-200 subject confirm PDC deficiency enrol 4 year . The genetic basis pathophysiology explore third confirmed PDC deficient patient , currently find identify mutation DLD five `` primary '' PDC-specific gene ( PDHA1 , PDHB , DLAT , PDHX , PDP1 ) , might benefit different treatment . The specific aim : 1 . Create Pyruvate Dehydrogenase Complex ( PDC ) Deficiencies specific database within NAMDC Patient Data Registry 2 . Use advance genetic analysis technology find mutation people none find 3 . Identify connection clinical genetic finding see different type PDC deficiency may respond different treatment , identify outcome form treatment could test ongoing future study . About Study : This study collect comprehensive ( complete ) longitudinal natural history clinical data proven Pyruvate Dehydrogenase Complex ( PDC ) deficiency , include data diagnosis , symptom , outcomes . The study include data patients/parents well medical data . The investigator use medical record detail questionnaire targeted collect in-depth information critical outcome . This questionnaire collect information subject parent importance different outcomes allow family discuss outcome may consider important home . These data update cyclically annual basis ( every 6 month infant ) medical laboratory record family questionnaires/interviews . Additional detail treatment seek maximize knowledge effect . The investigator obtain enrolled subject , annual basis , deproteinized whole EDTA-blood sample analysis lactate , beta-hydroxybutyrate ( Î²OHB ) , thiamine thiamine pyrophosphate ( TPP ) , marker disease status treatment efficacy . Data analysis focus spectrum neurological manifestation PDC deficiency , clinically relevant outcome measure , response therapeutic intervention . Such analysis serve inform future clinical trial . Data Dictionary : On file Columbia University Medical Center provide investigator University Hospitals Cleveland Medical Center .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>1 . Low PDC activity skin fibroblast , blood lymphocyte muscle biopsy , reference range , valid internal control establish sample assay integrity , PDHA1 testing , and/or 2 . A known pathogenic mutation gene associate PDC deficiency . Relative Subjects 1 . First second degree relative primary subject genetic testing indicate presence variant unknown significance ( VUS ) . 1 . Another chronic neurological disease ( mitochondrial nonmitochondrial ) consider likely related PDC deficiency . 2 . Inadequacy need blood tissue sample unwillingness inability submit sample . 3 . Unwillingness participate NAMDC Patient Data Registry Biorepository protocol . Relative Subjects 1 . Inadequacy need blood sample unwillingness inability submit sample .</criteria>
