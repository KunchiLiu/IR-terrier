	<brief_summary>This study explore impact exercise nutrition ( EX+NUTR ) , relative exercise alone ( EX ) intervention , brain structure function well blood biomarkers older adult subjective cognitive decline ( SCD ) vascular risk factor . The overall hypothesis combine EX+NUTR , relative EX , intervention evoke positive change brain structure ( e.g . hippocampal volume ) , neural activity ( e.g . task associate functional activation monitor fMRI ) , cognitive performance . These change associate improved metabolic profile , reduction inflammatory cytokine oxidative burden , great intervention compliance .</brief_summary>
