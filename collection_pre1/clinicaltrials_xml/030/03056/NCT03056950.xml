	<brief_summary>Occlusion training , resistance exercise perform specialized venous tourniquet , lead beneficial change muscle strength low resistance minimal stress nearby joint . This novel resistance train potential greatly improve muscle strength gain individual unable , medical reason , perform high resistance exercise typically require improve strength . Our study examine effect technique strength recovery follow distal radius fracture treat cast immobilization ( non-operatively ) . The primary objective intervention achieve accelerate recovery forearm , wrist hand function assess use measure grip/pinch strength , validated questionnaire , functional outcome testing . Occlusion train potentially serve specialty intervention rehabilitation patient , reduce cost care , improve treatment option patient provider .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>BFR DISTRAD NON OP : Blood Flow Restricted Training During Rehabilitation Following Distal Radius Fracture</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Investigator 's perform prospective , randomize , control study . All subject group adult sustain distal radius fracture treat cast immobilization ( non-operative ) San Antonio Military Medical Center ( SAMMC ) clinic system . Participants provide information study inclusion/exclusion criterion , upon conclusion formal consenting process , signature consent document , consider enrol study . Prior intiation study procedure patient must clear participation treatment surgeon per standard post-fracture protocol . Medical clearance document Enrollment form ( Appendix A ) Medical History form ( Appendix K ) . This verified access medical record confirm referral make post-fracture rehabilitation . Before initiation treatment , enrolled subject randomize either standard rehabilitation group occlusion train rehabilitation group . Randomization perform random number generator . Treatment initiate approxmiately 6 week s/p fracture ( clear orthopedic surgeon ) . Participantswill undergo approximetely 8-12 week treatment therapy session two three day week ( consistent standard care ) , re-assessments complete approximately 4 week , 8 week , 12 week initiate training protocol . The 12-week time point ( initiation therapy ) approximately time patient release full activity per standard care . The control ( non-occlusion training ) group follow standard s/p distal radius fracture rehabilitation protocol . Treatment include passive , active assistive , active range motion ( P/AA/AROM ) wrist , forearm hand ; desensitization need ; edema control need ; heat/cold modality need ; strengthen exercise . Specific strengthen exercise include wrist flexion/extension foam wedge , forearm pronation/supination arm position side elbow 90 degree , thumb opposition ( pinch strength ) well grip strengthening . The amount resistance use determine patient tolerance post operative precaution . The occlusion training group follow protocol describe utilize occlusion train strengthen exercise . We use establish occlusion train protocol already use CFI . The resistance strength training determine base individual participant tolerance . A cuff wrap around proximal portion arm involve extremity . In order individualize pressure subject , limb occlusion pressure measure ( dopplar ultrasound radial artery wrist level ) first schedule therapy visit . Limb occlusion pressure pressure necessary completely occlude arterial blood flow . The cuff pressure utilized post-operative exercise set 50 % limb occlusion pressure . Repetions 30 , 15 , 15 15 four set . A 30-second rest give set . The tourniquet stay inflate throughout entire exercise rest session , longer 30 minute consecutively time tourniquet inflate . After completion 4 set tourniquet pressure deflate . The subject ' strength re-assessed approximately every 2-4 week load increase tolerate .</detailed_description>
