	<brief_summary>Stereotactic body radiation therapy ( SBRT ) precise form radiation therapy allow physician deliver radiation dose single session . Because , number radiation session reduce typical 45-48 session , conventional daily session radiation , 5 session give every day week half . Giving radiation high dose treatment may effective kill prostate cancer cell standard way use external radiation therapy small amount radiation give many session . Androgen Deprivation Therapy ( ADT ) hormonal therapy one method treat intermediate risk prostate cancer . This therapy work reduce level testosterone stop affect cancer . The ADT use study know Degarelix . Degarelix approve medication reduces body 's production testosterone ; medication usually give men intermediate risk prostate cancer get external radiation . This study randomize study find whether combine stereotactic ( also know precision ) radiation prostate cancer combine short course Degarelix result great likelihood kill cancer prostate compare stereotactic radiation therapy give alone . It show combination radiation medication interfere testosterone production effect make prostate cancer cell sensitive radiation .</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Biopsy proven intermediate risk prostate cancer , include patient one follow variable : Gleason 7 disease PSA 1020 ng/ml Clinical T2bT2c disease Note : Patients radiographic evidence T3 disease ( i.e . extracapsular extension , seminal vesical invasion radiographically ) exclude . Serum testosterone ≥ 240 ng/dL determine within 2 month prior enrollment At least 4 week must elapse major surgery KPS ≥ 80 % Prostate size determine MRI &lt; 90 cc . Prostate size determine CT scan MRI available . 18 year age old IPSS ≤ 20 Patient must available followup . After 2 year followup follow posttreatment biopsy , telephonebased followup acceptable Laboratory test finding within 8 week randomization : Adequate hepatic function serum bilirubin ≤ 1.5 time upper institutional limit normal ( ULN ) , ALT AST ≤ 2.5 x ULN . Patients history Gilbert 's syndrome may enrol total bilirubin &lt; 3 mg/dL predominance indirect bilirubin Adequate renal function serum creatinine ≤ 1.5 x ULN Adequate hematologic function absolute neutrophil count ≥ 1,500 cell/mm3 platelet ≥ 100,000 cells/mm3 hemoglobin value ≥ 9 g/dL ( Note : patient whose anemia correct hemoglobin value ≥ 9 g/dL blood transfusion allow ) CT MRI evidence metastatic disease bone . Patients one positive lymph node consider suspicious determine clinical assessment MRI CT Prior treatment prostate cancer , include history chemotherapy , hormonal therapy within 30 day enrollment surgery prostate cancer ( except prior TURP would allow ) History another malignancy within previous 3 year except follow : adequately treat basal cell squamous cell skin cancer , superficial bladder cancer , currently complete remission , cancer complete remission least 3 year Patients Crohn 's disease ulcerative colitis</criteria>
