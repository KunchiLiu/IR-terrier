	<brief_summary>Introduction Undiagnosed deep vein thrombosis ( DVT ) lead significant morbidity mortality , include death DVT-associated massive pulmonary embolism ( PE ) . While several validated clinical prediction rule , blood test image modality exist investigate potential DVT , currently lack rapid , accessible reliable method exclude possibility DVT without resort formal venous duplex scan . Currently , use ED validate clinical prediction rule combine high-sensitivity D-dimer test poor predictive value , 75-90 % patient suspected DVT negative formal venous duplex scan . Compression bedside ultrasound however recently show safe , rapid accurate method diagnosis proximal DVT emergency department high sensitivity specificity ( combined sensitivity specificity 96.1 % 96.8 % , respectively1 ) . Research Question In present study , investigator primarily ass whether two-site compression POCUS combine negative age-adjusted D-dimer test accurately rule DVT ED patient regardless Wells criterion . Methods This single-center , prospective , observational study carry one year Emergency Department Jewish General Hospital Montreal , Quebec . The investigator aim enroll convenience sample 475 patient age 18 year old present ED symptom suggestive DVT . All enrol patient receive standard care require low leg DVT presentation . After calculate Patients DVT risk use modify well criterion , patient undergo POCUS DVT follow D-dimer test . Based result , patient either undergo formal duplex scanning , discharge without test receive three-month phone follow-up . A true negative low leg DVT define follow : 1 . Negative follow-up phone questionnaire patient send home formal duplex venous scanning . 2 . Negative formal duplex venous scan patient deem likely low leg DVT use Wells score , negative D-dimer POCUS Age-adjusted DVT add account knee DVT avoid need patient return fellow duplex study 1 week . To estimate technique 's sensitivity 4 % margin error 95 % confidence interval , 92 confirm DVT patient need . The investigator expect recruit total 475 patient within one-year period JGH ( 95 DVT-positive patient 380 DVT-negative patient ) . Impact The use compression bedside ultrasound negative age-adjusted D-dimer test rule DVT ED may accelerate decision regard patient disposition significantly decrease length patient stay ED . In addition , may help avoid unnecessary medical intervention diagnostic test , thus represent potential quality care cost-saving improvement well .</brief_summary>
