	<brief_summary>Spinal muscular atrophy ( SMA ) one common physical disability childhood . For SMA , progressive muscle weakness early fatigue hamper mobility sufferer . Osteopenia common population group due poor bone growth muscle disuse . As result , non-traumatic related fracture bone pain common . Recently , whole body vibration therapy ( WBVT ) proven improve bone health muscle function healthy adult post-menopausal woman . Among limited study WBVT child muscular dystrophy , promise result show gross motor function , balance , muscle strength WBVT appear safe child SMA . The present pilot study design investigate WBVT safe feasible individual SMA WBVT improve muscle function , functional ability , postural control bone mineral density child SMA . Convenience sample 10 individual SMA type III recruit . The participant receive WBVT 25 Hertz peak-to-peak amplitude 4mm session 18 minute , 3 day per week 4 week . Assessment perform baseline completion intervention examine muscle function , functional ability , postural control bone mineral density participant . It anticipate outcome pilot study SMA may show intervention safe , feasible beneficial child SMA type III regard muscle function , functional ability , postural control bone mineral content may relate practical issue intervention population group . The outcome also provide research evidence clinicians intervention recommend individual similar problem .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Spinal muscular atrophy ( SMA ) X-chromosome-linked disorder , loss motor neuron anterior horn spinal cord due deletion SMN1 gene . SMA usually classify 4 category , base onset time severity condition . Type I SMA severe category , boy diagnose 6 month old severe muscle weakness , cause poor head control unable sit independently . Boys type II SMA diagnose 6 18 month age able sit independently stand walk without assistance . SMA type III diagnose 18 month 30 year age boys stand walk independently still variable degree muscle weakness . Some would lose ambulation early adulthood require wheelchair mobility . Type IV SMA mild form adult onset , normal mobility longevity . However , also experience mild muscle weakness throughout life . This muscle weakness would lead early loss ambulation , reduce pulmonary function complication due immobilisation osteoporosis . Early fatality uncommon . Osteopenia due disuse , fact , common child physical disability . In study 69 child moderate severe cerebral palsy ( CP ) , show distal femur lumbar spine areal bone mineral density ( BMD ) z-scores appear worsen time , may reflect possibility poor bone growth velocity individual CP . Fracture bone pain major complication osteopenia CP majority non-traumatic fracture occur femur humerus . Other factor may contribute osteopenia physical disability include pubertal delay , vitamin D deficiency , dietary calcium deficiency , under-nutrition low body weight , corticosteroids anticonvulsant . Despite minimise factor , osteopenia appear persist . Limited study do examine bone health child SMA child Duchene muscular dystrophy ( DMD ) , similar clinical presentation although different pathology . A study 41 boy DMD , bone density proximal femur significantly decrease even ambulatory boy ( mean z-score -1.6 ) progress rapidly level 4 standard deviation norm compare normal boy . Forty-four percent boy episode fracture , mostly low limb . Recently whole body vibration therapy ( WBVT ) preliminarily show simple effective technique increase bone mass , muscle mass strength . In general , user stand static position stand performs dynamic movement device provide vibration Hz 50 Hz ( Hertz , Hz represent number complete movement cycle per second ) . It hypothesise vibration stimulate muscle spindle alpha-motor neuron , elicit muscle contraction . The latter would increase muscle mass turn , increase bone mass . It also postulate direct effect mechanical deformation bone increase fluid flow canalicular space stimulation osteocyte may contribute increase bone mass vibration therapy . Increase oxygen consumption , body temperature skin blood flow ( erythema ) also demonstrate . As WBVT elicit significant cardiovascular response , appear safe used child various medical condition . In systematic review 22 study ( include 7 study CP 2 DMD ) effect WBVT body composition physical fitness child adolescent disability , author conclude WBVT appear improve bone mass muscle strength population group . However , heterogeneity study notice , include great variation treatment protocol lack control group hence , recommend minimal dosage WBVT conclude . Since review , two randomise control trial ( RCT ) publish child CP . In one recent study , 30 child spastic diplegia CP GMFCS level I II randomised treatment group ( WBVT traditional physiotherapy ) control group ( physiotherapy ) . The treatment group receive 3 lot 3 minute 3 minute vibration ( 12 18 Hz ) , 2 5 time per week 3 month . Significant improvement knee extensor strength stand stability report treatment group . In another study 2013 , 27 child spastic diplegia hemiplegia CP GMFCS level I III randomised treatment group control group cross 4 week . The treatment group perform specific trunk exercise vibration platform ( 35 Hz ) , 5 10 minute per session , 2 4 session per week 4 week . Significant improvement find gait speed , muscle thickness abdominal muscle number sit-ups do 1 minute . A visual improvement also show sit stand posture . Although show high frequency low amplitude vibration seem safe rehabilitation mouse muscular dystrophy , intensive strengthening exercise , may induce damage muscle fibres child DMD SMA clinically indicate raise serum creatine kinase ( SCK ) level , remain concern . Hence current study population group target examine safety intervention . Three study child DMD 1 DMD SMA use WBVT found . In general , appear WBVT seem safe child DMD SMA . Although might raise SCK level , level would gradually reduce baseline level , , clinical sign symptom muscle damage . A promising result also show improve bone mineral density child DMD . However , due overall small number study sample size , definite conclusion WBVT effective improve bone density muscle strength population group yet . Based current research evidence , suggest 10 20 minute per session , least 3 time per week minimum 26 week frequency 25 35 Hz peak peak amplitude le 4 mm may appropriate protocol target improve bone mass muscle strength child adolescents disability . Studies rigorous research design homogeneous participant require investigate recommend dosage WBVT improve child disable condition . Methodology This feasibility study aim examine safety WBVT child type III SMA . Children type III SMA target adequate independence living community still experience early fatigue normal level exercise due nature condition . They high risk suffering complication due compromise mobility osteopenia , early loss ambulation compare healthy peer . The WBVT perform GalileoTM Med L Plus ( Novotech Medical GmbH ) study participant stand knee flex least 20 degree . The vibration frequency duration increase 5 day maximum 3 minute 24 25 Hz peak peak amplitude 4mm . The participant undergo WBVT 1 session per day , 3 day per week 4 week . The whole WBVT session last 18 minute 9 minute vibration . Participants : 10 child type III SMA age 6 18 year recruit . The age range extend aim increase number recruitment due rarity condition . All participant continue usual intervention regime , , study period . Recruitment : Children family identify paediatrician neuromuscular clinic Duchess Kent Children 's Hospital Hong Kong . Participants and/or parents/guardians ask interested participate study contact detail ( name contact telephone number ) pass onto PI . PI contact family telephone . Power analysis : There previous study specifically conduct group child adolescents hence data available power calculation . Most importantly , aim study examine safety feasibility WBVT group client .</detailed_description>
