	<brief_title>POOLED Red Blood Cells Prepared From Pooling 5 Leukoreduced , Irradiated RBC Units</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This research study enrol subject receive RBC ( red blood cell ) blood transfusion part treatment . In study , test new way prepare RBC unit ( pooled RBC unit ) transfusion compare standard RBC unit . We test blood transfusion may associate side effect may harmful . We develop new way process RBC transfusion try reduce side effect . The pooled RBC unit make sterilely pool five ( 5 ) single RBC unit one container blood mixed together , separate five individual RBC unit , ready use transfusion . The purpose study determine safety blood prepare new way compare standard RBC product . The primary objective determine significant difference transfusion associate adverse event POOLED-RBCs compare standard RBC product group . Secondarily determine significant difference new antibody new positive direct antiglobulin test ( DAT ) formation POOLED-RBCs compare standard RBC product group .</detailed_description>
