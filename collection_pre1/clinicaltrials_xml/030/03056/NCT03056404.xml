	<brief_title>Research Specific Proteins Interest Serological Diagnosis Bird Fancier 's Lung</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Allergic diseases important part health concern Europe country `` industrialized '' . Among distinguished hypersensitivity pneumonitis ( HP ) , consecutive repeat inhalation organic substance ( bacteria , fungi , avian protein ... ) . As HP , BFL invalidate disease , usually lethal patient reduce sufficiently early exposure antigen . Associated symptom include breathe difficulty dry cough , general fatigue state accompany fever rapid pronounce weight loss . These clinical sign may similar flu-like condition , difficult discern respiratory disease . Diagnosis base set clinical , radiological biological argument often discuss . Using criteria predictor would increase opportunity diagnose HP without use invasive clinical examination biopsy bronchoalveolar lavage . Although serology useful argument diagnosis , value often criticize . Thus , significant variation performance serological test observe one provider another , supplier , one batch another . This issue could raise use recombinant antigen . The principle use reaction purify protein interest produce genetic engineering . The Parasitology-Mycology department acquire expertise research proteins interest serology allergic diseases manufacture recombinant antigen . Thus work team identify protein interest diagnosis two HP occupational origin translates expertise identify pigeon 's protein study feasibility research . For project , pigeon droppings ( Columba livia ) , collect different breeder region identify antigenic source . The objective HYPERSENS project extend problematic specie bird understand specific specie antigenic protein . The aim also identify produce recombinant proteins identify cause avian hypersensitivity pneumonitis .</detailed_description>
