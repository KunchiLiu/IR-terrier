	<detailed_description>The overarch goal study conduct multi-site randomize control trial compare Adaptive Disclosure-Moral Injury Loss ( AD-MIL ) , new combat-specific psychotherapy war-related PTSD stem Moral Injury ( MI ) traumatic loss ( TL ) , Present Centered Therapy ( PCT ; Frost et al. , 2014 ) , term impact psychosocial functioning . The investigator five hypothesis , group ( A ) functional change ( B ) mental health change . A : Functional behavioral change hypothesis : A.1 . Immediately post-treatment , 3- , 6-months post-treatment , Iraq Afghanistan Veterans PTSD randomize AD-MIL great reduction social , educational , occupational disability A.2 . Immediately post-treatment , 3- , 6-months post-treatment , Iraq Afghanistan Veterans PTSD randomize AD-MIL great improvement quality life . B : Mental health change hypothesis : B.3 . Veterans randomize AD-MIL great reduction PTSD symptom severity small percentage PTSD case B.4 . Veterans randomize AD-MIL great reduction depressive symptom B.5 . Veteran randomize AD-MIL great reduction shame guilt The investigator also explore impact treatment anger aggressive behavior , suicidal ideation , alcohol abuse . BACKGROUND Posttraumatic stress disorder ( PTSD ) highly prevalent disable condition among war Veterans , pose significant public health burden . Depending degree type exposure warzone stressor , approximately 20 % 2.5 million service member serve Iraq Afghanistan develop clinically significant PTSD . PTSD cause private suffering uniquely damaging ripple effect family member , friend , co-worker , productivity , healthcare cost . Veterans PTSD suffer variety co-morbid mental physical health condition heavy service-utilizers . They also extensive functional impairment , occupational problem , family relationship difficulty , aggressive risky behavior , reduce quality life . Unfortunately , although considerable gain make VA 's dissemination PTSD treatments highly effective civilian trauma , therapy show work considerably less well war trauma . The investigator argue partly due lack attention military culture ethos unique harm war trauma , namely , moral injury ( MI ) traumatic loss ( TL ) . In addition , VA treatment fail demonstrate impact function quality life , problem less impacted warzone trauma target treatment . Instead , symptom change typically sole metric success , functional deficit rarely take account . The investigator argue PTSD symptom conceptualize targeted part fabric whole Veteran context . Consequently , overarch goal propose study fill substantial care-gap VA create evidence-based treatment war-related PTSD stem MI TL focus improve psychosocial functioning . The investigator modify extended Adaptive Disclosure treat MI TL ( AD-MIL ) building skill train behavioral contract improve functioning , target MI- TL-related psychological behavioral obstacle positive potentially habilitative engagement occupational , relationship , family role . If find effective , AD-MIL fill care-gap VA , reduce PTSD patient ' suffering , help Veterans reclaim establish positive relationship , work role , self-care routine . METHOD The investigator plan conduct multi-site randomized control trial AD-MIL , compare PCT . The trial follow consensus recommendation clinical trial VA ( VA-ORD , 2008 ) : ( 1 ) clearly define target symptom : Functional clinical outcome operationalized ; ( 2 ) reliable valid measure : Assessment tool select content relevance psychometric property ; ( 3 ) use blind evaluator outcome : The evaluator independent blind treatment condition . This assessor remind participant help maintain blind ; ( 4 ) assessor training : The independent evaluator ( IE ) carefully train criterion monitor ongoing basis ; ( 5 ) manualized , replicable , specific treatment program ; ( 6 ) unbiased assignment treatment arm ( 7 ) treatment adherence : Sessions record , random percentage use ass treatment integrity . Adherence therapy manual monitor senior supervisor . The investigator follow CONSORT guideline randomization participant track . Participants Participants comprise sample 186 Veterans ( include woman member diverse ethnic racial group ) PTSD result Iraq Afghanistan Wars . Recruitment Veterans recruit treated VA sit Minneapolis , MN , San Diego , CA ( Oceanside CBOC ) , San Francisco , CA . Co-Investigators ( Co-Is ) study sit successfully resolve operational obstacle challenge implement clinical trial respective setting . Referrals clinical study nurture Co-I 's role clinician PTSD expert . Co-Is ( ) provide material describe nature study target population seek , distribute say material via formal ( e.g. , staff meeting ) informal ( e.g. , bulletin board ) channel ; ( b ) attend clinical staff meeting ; ( c ) give talk describe various treatment staff grand round context ( e.g. , trainee ) ; ( ) provide feedback staff refer patient . Assessor Training Adherence A co-investigator , Dr. Matt Gray ( University Wyoming ) train assessor prior begin enrollment . Training include read view training material , observation CAPS administration , supervised administration least three CAPS . Dr. Gray expertise conduct CAPS assessment past experience perform train fidelity monitoring use CAPS assessment clinical trial . Each assessor consider trained CAPS `` match '' Dr. Gray three interview . To establish matching , Dr. Gray co-rate interview conduct assessor . A match occur assessor Dr. Gray agree diagnosis within 2 point severity symptom cluster ( PTSD criterion B , C , D , E ) . If assessor match three interview five attempt , Dr. Gray determine whether additional training necessary assessor need replace . All assessment audiotaped ensure standardized approach use across patient ( provide participant consent ) . Dr. Gray review audio recording 10 % assessment , select randomly . Dr. Gray discretion increase proportion review difficult patient assessor need additional monitoring . Assessors provide feedback performance . All recording store restricted-access directory ( i.e. , lab personnel personal usernames expressly grant access may access directory contain folder recording , must log personal username password ) lock office maintain Boston VA Healthcare System , Jamaica Plain campus . Selected session ( recording interviewer-scored assessment sheet ) transport Dr. Gray via Federal Express another carrier allow track . Random Assignment Veterans randomly assign PCT AD-MIL . The Boston site generate randomize permuted block scheme randomly assign patient block gender minority status . Block size gender minority status base distribution variable site . Blocking gender minority status ensure appropriate accrual rate participant low base-rate characteristic . The Boston site use constrain randomization ( i.e. , bias coin design ) unexpected imbalance arises gender minority distribution across treatment group . Treatment Fidelity Monitoring Two half-time therapist Ph.D. 's clinical counseling psychology VA internship experience treat Veterans PTSD train deliver AD-MIL PCT ( ) . Training involve review respective manual support material , intensive supervision two trial case , weekly group phone supervision ( Dr. Litz AD-MIL ; Dr. Bolton PCT ) , weekly one-on-one supervision Dr. Amidon ( AD-MIL ) Dr. Bolton ( PCT ) . Dr. Amidon train Dr. Litz administer AD Marine Corps trial recently train conduct AD-MIL . Dr. Bolton provide training , supervision , fidelity monitoring numerous treatment outcome study , include two large randomize trial Veterans PCT compare trauma-focused intervention . Drs . Amidon Bolton review recording first 2 trial case shape fidelity . All session audiotaped . Two random session recording random 20 % case rat ensure fidelity treatment approach . Selected session transport Dr. Amidon Bolton via Federal Express another carrier allow track . ANALYSES Inferential analysis . The longitudinal clustered nature design produce multilevel nest data structure . In study , Veterans therapists nest ( cluster ) within performance site . The low level ( level-1 ) data consist repeated measure individual assessment . Level-1 data nest within upper level ( level-2 ) person-level variable ( e.g. , treatment arm study site ) . In SAS Proc Mixed two level merge one model random intercept slope ( aka `` growth curve '' model ) use compound symmetry variance within site auto-correlated AR1 structure repeat measure . The investigator conduct mixed model analysis random slopes/random intercept multilevel regression framework estimate initial status formally compare 3-month change time outcome ( i.e. , linear contrast , level-1 within-subjects component analysis ) . Also , exploratory analysis , investigator test coefficient vary function level-2 component , include long term 6-month follow-up data . The analysis include continuous categorical time vary invariant predictor covariates , use data , produce accurate parameter estimate . Aim I : Randomized controlled trial AD-MIL , compare PCT : Hypotheses 1 2 : Veterans AD-MIL arm steeper downward upward slope SDS ( primary endpoint ) QOLI score , respectively . Schematically , follow model test : Level 1 : Yij = 0j + 1jdumpost + 2jdum3mosfu + 3jdum6mosfu + rij , Level 2 : 0j = 00 + 01T + ui ; 1j = 10 + 11T , 2j = 20 + 21T , 3j = 30 + 31T Yij SDS score subject j assessment point . In model , time represent dummy-coded variable . Initially , dummy-coded variable represent post-treatment ( dumpost ) three- ( dum3mosfu ) six- ( dum6mosfu ) month follow-up interval enter level-1 component model . With cod scheme , pre-treatment time point reference time point ; therefore , 0j = individual 's pre-treatment SDS score , 1j , 2j , 3j index change pre-treatment post-treatment , three-month follow-up , six-month follow-up , respectively . rij represent level-1 ( within-subjects ) residual term . At level-2 , regression equation level-1 coefficient , T indicator treatment condition ( AD-MIL PCT ) , uj represent level-2 residual term . With Time ( T ) enter dummy-coded variable , level-2 equation , 0. represent value particular level-1 regression coefficient treatment condition cod 0 ( i.e. , reference group ) , 1. represent difference two treatment condition . The primary hypothesis evaluate level-2 coefficient 11 , represent difference two treatment group pre- post-treatment . The investigator hypothesize AD-MIL group show large treatment gain : H0 : 11 = 0 vs. H1 : 11 0 . The level-2 coefficient 21 31 evaluated determine whether treatment difference remain follow-up assessment . Different cod scheme employed time component analysis . For example , orthogonal polynomial contrast code use evaluate linear quadratic change SDS score pre-treatment six-month follow-up assessment point . Identical calculation perform B-IPF DRRI-2 Post-Deployment Social Support measure . Hypotheses 3-5 : Veterans AD-MIL : ( 3 ) steeper downward PTSD symptom severity slope ( CAPS-5 PCL-5 ) low incidence PTSD case ( test Chi-square ) ; ( 4 ) steeper slop depressive symptom ( PHQ-9 ) ; ( 5 ) steeper slope shame guilt ( PANAS TRGI ) . Separate model test outcome . These model structure model use test Hypotheses 1 2 , continuous measure score designate outcome variable ( Yij ) separate analysis . Once , level-2 coefficient 11 represent difference two treatment group pre- post-treatment primary interest , level-2 coefficient 21 31 evaluated determine whether treatment difference remain follow-up assessment . Exploratory analysis : Will AD-MIL associated steeper downward slop anger aggressive behavior ( STAXI-II , CTS2 ) , suicidal ideation ( DSI-SS ) , alcohol abuse ( QDS ) compare PCT ? The model use evaluate question structure model . The investigator especially circumspect statistically significant finding variable . Clinical significance : Clinical significance calculate Jacobson-Truax ( 1991 ) method . This method suggest two-step criterion . First , reasonable cutoff dysfunctional functional population establish . Because normative data Veterans SDS QOLI yet exist , Jacobson Truax 's ( 1991 ) suggest cutoff A , define point 2 SDs beyond range pre-therapy mean ( cutoff A = Mclinical - 2 SDclinical SDS + 2 SDclinical QOLI ) use . Next , reliable change index ( RC ) participant calculate ensure change due artifact measurement error . The RC compute accord follow : RC = ( x2 - x1 ) /Sdiff x1 represent participant 's pre-treatment SDS QOLI total score , x2 represent participant 's post-treatment follow-up total score , Sdiff standard error difference two test score . Sdiff calculate internal consistency measure time point . An RC large 1.96 reflect real change . Based two-step criterion , individual classify recover ( pass cutoff A RC criterion ) , improve ( pas RC criterion cutoff A ) , unchanged ( pass neither criterion ) , deteriorate ( pass RC criterion symptom score increase ) follow-up interval . Chi-square analysis use compare proportion per arm follow-up .</detailed_description>
