	<detailed_description>Plasmodium knowlesi common cause malaria , malaria death , Sabah , Malaysia . Acute kidney injury ( AKI ) common feature severe knowlesi malaria ; however mechanisms AKI knowlesi malaria unknown . In falciparum malaria , recent evidence suggest oxidative stress haemolysis-related cell-free haemoglobin ( CFHb ) may contribute pathogenesis AKI . Cell-free haemoglobin oxidative stress : CFHb release intravascular haemolysis , exceed bind capacity plasma haptoglobin , filter glomeruli enters renal tubule . CFHb pathogenic ferrous heme oxidize ferric state , confer peroxidase activity hemoglobin . Consequently , hemoglobin reduce hydroperoxides , hydrogen peroxide ( H2O2 ) lipid hydroperoxides , generate ferryl state heme ( FeIV=O ) protein radical . The ferryl heme protein radical generate lipid radical oxidation free phospholipid-esterified unsaturated fatty acid . The arachidonic side chain membrane phospholipid particularly vulnerable free radical-mediated damage complex cascade lipid oxidation lead generation F2-isoprostanes ( F2-IsoPs ) isofurans ( IsoFs ) . F2-IsoPs IsFs increase severe falciparum malaria , show induce vasoconstriction associate renal injury haemolytic condition include rhabdomyolysis , sepsis post-operatively . Paracetamol oxidative stress : A novel mechanism paracetamol recently demonstrate , show paracetamol act potent inhibitor hemoprotein-catalyzed lipid peroxidation reduce ferryl heme less toxic ferric state quench globin radical . In proof concept trial , paracetamol therapeutic level show significantly decrease oxidative kidney injury improve renal function inhibit hemoprotein-catalyzed lipid peroxidation rat model rhabdomyolysis-induced renal injury . In retrospective study patient sepsis , receive paracetamol set raise CFHb associate reduced lipid peroxidation , reduce risk death . More recently , randomize placebo-controlled trial , paracetamol associate reduction F2-IsoPs improve renal function adult sepsis detectable CFHb . Rationale : The investigator hypothesize paracetamol may provide renal protection patient severe knowlesi malaria reduce hemoprotein-induced lipid peroxidation occur haemolytic condition . As currently consensus exist concern adequate medical treatment severe malaria complicate intravascular haemolysis AKI , potential application paracetamol would great benefit , especially safe widely available . Proposed activity : The main activity propose randomise , open label , control trial regularly-dosed paracetamol , versus paracetamol , patient knowlesi malaria , assess effect paracetamol renal function oxidative stress .</detailed_description>
