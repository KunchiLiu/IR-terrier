	<detailed_description>Specific Aim 1 . Recruit non pregnant woman T1DM investigate efficacy dietary NAC ameliorate oxidative stress Study design . Diabetic patient provide NAC placebo 14 day , receive usual clinical care . The oxidative stress status assess measure biomarkers blood sample pre post intervention . In addition placebo control group , three treatment group include Group 1 ( NAC 600 mg/day ) , Group 2 ( NAC 1200 mg/day ) , Group 3 ( NAC 1800 mg/day ) study . The choice dosage NAC base publish study , show effectiveness NAC 600 1200 mg day alleviate oxidative stress diabetic patient , men woman , without adverse side effect . The investigator use supplement company TwinLab study . The university Maryland Pharmacy department analyze NAC purity prior start study . At day 7 , participant call via phone ass symptom side effect medication . All participant call . At end 14 day , patient return CDE survey ask compliance medication side effect . They also bring pill bottle study personnel pill count . At time blood draw biomarker level look change oxidative stress . Specific Aim 2 . To investigate effect PUFAs ameliorate oxidative stress diabetic non-pregnant woman . Study design : The investigator recruit new group Non-pregnant woman T1DM enrol randomly assign placebo one three treatment group . Study volunteer divide 1 3 group . PUFA ; Group 1 ( 1000 mg/day ) Group 2 ( 2000 mg/day ) Group 3 ( placebo ) . The treatment regimens , sample collection , biomarker assessment , side effect monitor statistical analysis perform described SA 1 . The investigator perform analysis oxidative stress biomarkers describe SA1 . The investigator use TwinLab commercial supplier PUFA trial . There fish oil supplement involve great 40 publish trial . The fish oil supplement analyze University Maryland pharmacy department prior start study analyze purity . Specific Aim 3 : To investigate potential secondary benefit NAC/PUFA kidney function lipid profile . Urine serum sample collect enrolled subject day 0 Day 14 monitor improvement microalbumin urine lipid profile serum . Previous study show improvement LDL supplementation NAC . The investigator look various dosage effect improvement microalbumin lipid profile .</detailed_description>
