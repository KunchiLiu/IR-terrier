	<brief_title>A Study Evaluate Efficacy ELAPR002f ELAPR002g Females Males With Atrophic Acne Scars</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The study consist pre-screen visit follow seven study visit . There pre-screen visit 30 potential study subject 2D 3D photograph take candidate treatment field enable Sponsor Trial Centre staff set practical guideline subject recruitment base example atrophic acne scar image publish acne scar assessment scale . Subjects participate pre-screen period may invite participate full study consider able meet eligibility criterion . There screen visit confirm eligibility ass baseline parameter ( D-28 D-1 ) . In addition , propose treatment field side face select screening record 2D &amp; 3D photograph location mark detail acetate sheet . For enrolled subject three intradermal ( i.d . ) treatment session ELAPR002f ELAPR002g placebo , give one-monthly interval ( approximately D0 , D28 D56 ) . The treatment D0 administer reduce appearance atrophic roll acne scar treatment field relative surround skin . The treatment D28 D56 give optimise treatment outcome minimise appearance atrophic roll acne scar treatment field . In addition facial acne scar , minimum 5 subject treatment group also receive treatment two moderate severe , distensible , roll acne scar present approximately 5-10cm apart back torso . There assessment visit 14 84 day first treatment session ( D14 D84 ) review adverse event assess implant site . ELAPR002f ELAPR002g administer alone vs. placebo . Subjects follow total 24 week ( D168 ) follow first treatment , efficacy safety assessment undertaken study visit . At final follow-up visit ( D168 ) biopsy sample take treated atrophic acne scar back torso ( active placebo treat ) subject receive treatment scar back torso . Each study subject act control active placebo treatment give single-blind treatment field contralateral side face . Prior administration select treatment field identify mark washable marker use 2D 3D image acetate sheet create screen visit ensure consistency anatomic site treatment ( biopsy subject receive treatment back torso ) .</detailed_description>
