	<brief_summary>Patients Crohn 's disease ( CD ) ulcerative colitis ( UC ) often treated medication suppress immune system . These patient therefore increase risk develop infection , influenza , pneumonia , hepatitis B , may prevent vaccination . While awareness increase among gastroenterologist importance vaccination IBD patient , continue question effectiveness vaccination immunosuppressed patient . It previously show patient immunosuppressive therapy certain biologic medication ( TNF-blockers : infliximab adalimumab ) impair immune response vaccination compare healthy control , mechanism immunosuppression agent systemic . Vedolizumab , biologic medication CD UC approve May 2014 , target α4β7 integrin , key component gut immunity , hypothesize agent effect gut specific . There limited data suggest healthy patient give vedolizumab alter response parentally administer vaccine , however study CD UC population describe . Additionally , IBD patient treat vedolizumab frequently also concomitant therapy immunomodulator ( 6-mercaptopurine , azathioprine , methotrexate ) , patient ability mount immune response demonstrate .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Immunogenicity Influenza , Pneumococcal Hepatitis B Vaccines IBD Patients Treated With Vedolizumab</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The purpose study determine immune response rate ( ) influenza , ( b ) pneumococcal , ( c ) hepatitis B vaccine IBD patient receive vedolizumab therapy compare patient therapy IBD . Four study group establish -- 1 . Group A - IBD patient vedolizumab monotherapy . 2 . Group B - IBD patient receive combination treatment vedolizumab concomitant immunomodulator therapt ( methotrexate , azathioprine , 6-mercaptopurine ) . 3 . Group C - IBD patient biologic therapy ( infliximab , adalimumab , certolizumab , golimumab , ustekinumab ) . 4 . Group D - IBD patient take immunosuppressive therapy . Patients group stable treatment IBD least three month . For four vaccine include study ( influenza , PCV-13 , PSV-23 , hepatitis B ) , total 220 sample collect . Given one vaccine may clinically indicate individual patient , single patient may receive one vaccine , therefore include immune response analysis vaccine receive . Once subject sign consent enrol study , follow procedure take place : Baseline/enrollment visit : The subject comprehensive medical history physical exam perform baseline clinic visit . During visit also fill 10 question IBD quality life questionnaire , baseline serum sample obtain , receive vaccine ( ) indicate base vaccination history . These vaccine include , pneumococcal pneumonia - PSV-23 PCV-13 ( give single dose 0.5 mL intramuscularly deltoid region upper arm ) , influenza - Afluria Fluzone patient 65 year ago ( give single dose 0.5 mL intramuscularly deltoid region upper arm ) , hepatitis B - Energix ( administer three dose series 1.0 mL give 0 , 1 , 6 month , patient receive booster single intramuscular dose 1.0 mL give ) . Subjects instruct call study team concern development fever , chill , rash concern symptom . Follow phone call : Subjects receive follow-up phone call 2 week vaccination identify adverse effect include fever chill , rash , visit emergency room primary care physician . Follow visit : At 3-4 week vaccination , patient visit serum obtain . Patients also ask adverse event fever vaccine reaction , well complete 10 question IBD quality life questionnaire ( IBDQ ) .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>1 . Adult patient age 1875 IBD ( diagnose standard clinical , radiographic , endoscopic , histopathologic criterion ) receive care Boston Medical Center , Center Digestive Disorders . 2 . Patients receive one follow treatment IBD vedolizumab monotherapy , combination treatment vedolizumab concomitant immunomodulator therapy ( methotrexate , azathioprine , 6mercaptopurine ) , combination treatment TNF inhibitor concomitant immunomodulator therapy ( methotrexate , azathioprine , 6mercaptopurine ) , immunosuppressive therapy ( patient may take oral topical 5aminosalicylates ) . Patients group stable treatment IBD least three month . 1 . Any patient prior vaccination intend vaccine , exception receive hepatitis B booster . 2 . Any patient allergy vaccine component . 3 . Patients provide informed consent . 4 . Patients administer nonlicensed experimental immunomodulators 5 . Patients take steroid orally intravenously ( 20mg prednisone equivalent dose corticosteroid ) least 10 day , within 30 day prior vaccination . 6 . Patients receive immunoglobulin therapy blood product within past one month .</criteria>
