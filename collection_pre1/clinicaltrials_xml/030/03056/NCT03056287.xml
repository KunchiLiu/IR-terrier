	<brief_summary>This project ass effect aerobic exercise training ( AET ) , repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation ( rTMS ) combination depressive severity well locomotor function person post-stroke depression ( PSD ) . Both AET rTMS establish stand-alone treatment non-stroke related depression , though neither adequately study post-stroke . Furthermore , substantive research indicate AET improve post-stroke locomotor function , thus offer novel approach treat PSD well establish vehicle study effect PSD response rehabilitation . The purpose project determine impact AET , rTMS combination ( AET+rTMS ) treatments post-stroke depressive symptom locomotor function guide development future clinical trial . A total 40 depress post-stroke subject randomly assign one four group 1 ) AET ; 2 ) rTMS ; 3 ) combine AET rTMS ( AET+rTMS ) 4 ) control ( sham rTMS ) group ( n=10 per condition ; equally distribute mild moderate MDD ) . Further , additional 10 non-depressed post-stroke subject complete 8 week AET allow u determine effect PSD response training ( Aim 2 ) . Training ( AET , rTMS AET+rTMS ) take place 8-week period , three time per week non-consecutive day . Measures depression ( HRSD17 ) well self-selected walk speed ( SSWS ) perform prior initial treatment session week well 8 week follow cessation treatment . Additional measure locomotor function ( walk endurance amount daily community step ) assess prior training ( pre ) , follow 4 week training ( mid ) , upon completion 8 week training ( post ) well 8 week follow cessation training ( follow-up ) , allow determination efficacy ( persistence ) training outcome .</brief_summary>
