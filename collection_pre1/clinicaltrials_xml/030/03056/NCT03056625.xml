	<brief_summary>Vitamin A deficiency ( VAD ) remain public health problem occur child woman . WHO estimate 190 million preschool age child ( five year age ) 19.1 million pregnant woman inadequate concentration retinol . VAD may increase risk morbidity mortality childhood , pregnancy postpartum period . In develop country , vitamin A status lactate woman optimal . Even United States , vitamin A status low income pregnant woman marginal . Therefore , woman reproductive age risk vitamin A depletion compromise vitamin A status breastfed infant . Vitamin A transferred milk retinol bind protein bound chylomicron associate vitamin A carrier . Because teratogenicity vitamin A , transfer vitamin A pregnant mother fetus carefully control . This result infant born low store vitamin A . Therefore human milk still best vitamin A source infant . The concentration vitamin A breast milk high first 21 day postpartum ( colostrum first 4-6 day transitional milk next 7-21 day ) . Breast milk vitamin A concentration infant 's vitamin A status base maternal dietary intake . Breast milk retinol concentration useful tool unique indicator lactate woman represent extrapolation vitamin A status breastfed infant . In high risk vitamin A deficiency area , prior recommendation lactate woman give two dos 200,000 IU vitamin A within 6 week post-delivery . However , lack impact evidence regimen lead WHO 's withdrawal recommendation public health policy . Food-based intervention regard sustainable approach improve population vitamin A status . Most recently , vitamin A-depleted sow feed high-provitamin A carotenoid maize result significant increase liver store nurse piglet significant high milk retinol concentration sow feed white maize give high-dose vitamin A supplement . Previous effort fortify staple common vehicle vitamin A offer promising solution prevention vitamin A deficiency vulnerable population . Food fortify vitamin A potential improve woman 's vitamin A status increase vitamin A concentration breast milk . Rice important staple food Thailand , represent culture consumption lifestyle Thai people . Recent study Thai school child feed extruded rice grain fortify zinc , iron vitamin A every weekday 2 month , significantly increase liver store vitamin A , assess stable isotope technique . Likewise , fortification rice vitamin A may also benefit mother lactation . The outcome study useful guide promotion food-based strategy improve vitamin A status mother infant lactation .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Efficacy Vitamin A Fortified Rice Lactating Thai Women</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Objectives To determine efficacy vitamin A fortified rice get breast milk lactate mother determine breast milk vitamin A concentration , total body reserve vitamin A via isotope dilution technique , follow 14 week feed trial lactate woman . Methodology The intervention two arm , vitamin A fortified rice regular rice 35 participant ( lactate woman ) per group . Participants receive one meal per day weekday period 14 week . The fortified dose measure final cooked product , aim administer approximately 500 µg retinol rice meal . Vitamin A fortified rice produce extrusion technology add retinol artificial rice mix normal rice . Data collection 1 . Demographic data Each participant ask demographic data first interview . The data include general information ( age , education occupation ) , socioeconomic status , number child duration breastfeed mother , woman child . 2 . Anthropometric data Anthropometric measurement include weight height participant weight , length head circumference infant record first day post-intervention . 3 . Dietary assessment At baseline ( Day 1 : 3+1 week first breastfeed ) , participant interview food consumption previous 24 hour 3 time ( 2 weekday 1 weekend day ) . The data consist food item , food type , food component weight size consume portion . Information interview analyze INMUCAL software ( Mahidol University , Thailand ) 4 . Collection analysis breast milk sample Breast milk sample collect vitamin A analysis . Collection breast milk sample divide two period follow time point start 3+1 week first breastfeed . - baseline : Day 1 15 - 14 week post-intervention : Day 121 135 5 . Collection analysis blood sample The change vitamin A status participant determine use pair13C-retinol isotope dilution test . This involve give first dose 2 µmol retinol equivalent 13C2-retinolretinyl acetate participant day 1 second dose ( 2 µmol retinol ) give participant day 121 . Blood sample collect 4 time ( Day 1 , 15 , 121 135 3+1 week first breastfeed ) measure isotopic ratio 13C/12C calculation liver vitamin A concentration . Blood sample draw plastic clot blood tube wrap aluminum foil protection light . Then , blood centrifuge 3000 rpm 15 minute , serum separate immediately dark cryovials store -20 ◦c .</detailed_description>
