	<brief_summary>The goal clinical research study learn give genetically change immune cell , call NK cell , chemotherapy improve disease stem cell transplant patient relapse ( return ) and/or refractory ( responded treatment ) B-cell lymphoma leukemia . Also , researcher want find high tolerable dose CAR-NK cell give patient relapse refractory B-cell lymphoma leukemia . The safety treatment also study .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Gene Transfer : The process change DNA ( genetic material cell ) NK cell call `` gene transfer . '' NK cell separate frozen cord blood use machine . Researchers perform gene transfer change NK cell ' DNA , inject genetically change NK cell body patient receive transplant . Length Study Participation You may take part study 15 year . Your participation study long-term follow-up visit describe . Tests Before Study Drug Administration : Before receive study drug , blood ( 4 tablespoon ) draw research test . This blood use baseline study immune system start treatment . Within 7 day receive study drug : - You physical exam . - Blood ( 4 tablespoon ) draw routine test . If become pregnant , part blood use pregnancy test . Study Drug Administration : You receive fludarabine cyclophosphamide help prepare body CAR-NK infusion . These drug may kill cancer cell , main goal use . The day receive CAR-NK cell call Day 0 . The day receive CAR-NK cell call minus day . The day receive CAR-NK cell call plus day . On Day -6 , admit hospital give fluid vein hydrate . On Days -5 , -4 , -3 , receive fludarabine vein 1 hour cyclophosphamide vein 3 hour . You also receive mesna vein cyclophosphamide dose low risk side effect bladder cause cyclophosphamide . On Days -2 -1 , rest . On Day 0 , receive genetically modify NK cell cell infusion vein . If graft-versus-host disease ( GvHD ) cytokine release syndrome NK cell infusion , receive AP1903 vein possibly steroid mouth vein . GvHD occur donor cell attack cell person receive . Cytokine release syndrome ( CRS ) occur large amount protein release blood . The risk GvHD CRS , serious , describe great detail . Study Tests After NK Infusion : On Day +2 Weeks 1 , 2 , 3 , 4 , 8 , 12 , 16 : °Blood ( 5 tablespoon ) draw routine test , chimerism test ( see well transplant take ) , research test . During Weeks 1 , 3 , 4 , 16 : °You bone marrow aspiration biopsy check status disease research test . To collect bone marrow aspiration/biopsy , area hip numb anesthetic , small amount bone marrow bone withdrawn large needle . Long-Term Follow-Up : For safety reason , FDA require patient receive infusion CAR-NK cell treat gene transfer procedure must long-term follow-up yearly least 15 year receive gene transfer . You blood test perform check make sure type infection call replication-competent retrovirus ( RCR ) . For test , blood ( 4 teaspoon time ) drawn 1 , 3 , 6 month NK cell infusion , every 6 month 5 year , year 10 year . If RCR test result first year NK cell infusion show RCR infection , rest leftover blood sample ( left RCR test Years 2-15 ) store Bellicum Pharmaceuticals safety reason . This researcher study change blood ( related RCR ) may arise Years 2-15 . This investigational study . The make infusion genetically change NK cell drug AP1903 ( receive , explain ) FDA approve commercially available use type disease . They currently use research purpose . The chemotherapy drug study ( fludarabine , cyclophosphamide , mesna ) commercially available FDA approve . Up 36 patient take part study . All enrol MD Anderson .</detailed_description>
