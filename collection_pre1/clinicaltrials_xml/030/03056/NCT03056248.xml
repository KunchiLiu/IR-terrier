	<brief_summary>A grow body pre-clinical evidence suggest glycogen synthase kinase 3β ( GSKβ ) implicate development progression acute kidney injury ( AKI ) . Lithium naturally occur standard inhibitor GSKβ . The purpose study examine low dose lithium carbonate able reduce incidence AKI patient undergo cardiac surgery place cardiopulmonary bypass surgery . We hypothesize low dose lithium might reduce incidence duration AKI patient undergo cardiac surgery cardiopulmonary bypass .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Cardiac surgery associate acute kidney injury ( CSA-AKI ) significant problem . The prevalence vary 0.3 % 22.9 % depend definition AKI . The pathogenesis AKI population multifactorial . Factors associate AKI patient include increased age , preoperative elevate creatinine , presence diabetes , reduce ejection fraction , increase body weight , presence carotid artery bruit , duration cardiopulmonary bypass , aortic cross clamp time , duration surgery . CSA-AKI independent predictor mortality , morbidity , increase length stay hospitalization cost . Moreover patient also increase risk chronic kidney disease end stage renal failure future . Various pharmacologic approach try prevent early CSA-AKI diuretic , vasodilator , anti-inflammatory drug . Fenoldopam , atrial natriuretic peptide , brain natriuretic peptide show little renoprotection . However strategies lack high quality evidence support use standard care . There strong evidence suggest single multiple pharmacotherapy significantly impact reduce CAS-AKI . Thus current best therapy CSA-AKI prevention , supportive care , hemodynamic optimization renal replacement therapy . AKI extremely complex process involve multiple pathophysiologic pathway . Glycogen synthase kinase 3β ( GSK3β ) implicate many pathway beyond glycogen metabolism show important player development AKI . Lithium US Food Drug Administration ( FDA ) -approved drug use 50 year first line agent treat mood disorder . It standard inhibitor GSK3β . Latest evidence murine model cisplatin-induced AKI ischemia/reperfusion-induced AKI suggest lithium treatment may attenuate kidney dysfunction kidney histologic injury follow AKI . Lithium able promote kidney tubular cell repair hence improvement AKI murine model . In addition , lithium also find exert anti-proteinuric renal reparative effect . On background want explore potential preventive therapeutic role lithium carbonate CSA- AKI .</detailed_description>
