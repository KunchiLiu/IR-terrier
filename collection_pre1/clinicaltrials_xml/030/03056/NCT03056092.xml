	<brief_summary>Objective : To determine association baseline aqueous cytokine level treatment interval patient variable dose regimen intravitreal ranibizumab patient neovascular age-related macular degeneration ( nAMD ) , macular edema secondary retinal vein occlusion ( RVO ) diabetic macular edema ( DME ) . Methods : A prospective , single-centre study perform contain 3 sub-studies accord study population : nAMD , macular edema secondary RVO DME . Inclusion criterion : patient follow St. Michael 's Hospital diagnosis nAMD , macular edema secondary RVO DME . Patients exclude visual acuity worse counting finger , macular pathology cause structural change retina , receive anti-VEGF injection photocoagulation therapy 6 month prior study , intraocular surgery 3 month prior study , history vitreoretinal surgery ocular inflammation study eye , use systemic topical anti-inflammatory steroid , patient dialysis renal failure , allergy study drug fluorescein , &lt; 18 year old , woman pregnant . All patient treat ranibizumab intravitreal injection variable dose regimen : Patients DME examine monthly receive mandatory injection first three month ( baseline , week 4 8 ) . Afterwards , continue see monthly need new injection decide upon clinical finding visit . An anterior chamber ( AC ) tap do injection require visit . Patients nAMD RVO examine monthly receive mandatory injection first three month . From week 12 72 ( month 18 ) , visit schedule increase 2-weeks interval base stability ocular condition response treatment . At visit , injection AC tap perform . The maximum interval injection 12 week . If disease becomes unstable , interval injection shorten , stabilizes , treatment frequency extend . In patient , baseline aqueous humour specimen obtain prior first ranibizumab intravitreal injection follow-up sample take immediately prior subsequent injection base treatment regimen cytokine analysis end follow-up .</brief_summary>
