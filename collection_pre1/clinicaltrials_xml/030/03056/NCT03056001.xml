	<brief_summary>The purpose study evaluate safety , tolerability efficacy doxorubicin combination pembrolizumab subject metastatic unresectable soft tissue sarcoma . Based previous study , pembrolizumab may effective study treatment .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Safety , Tolerability , Efficacy Doxorubicin Pembrolizumab Sarcoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The primary objective study assess safety toxicity profile doxorubicin pembrolizumab previously treat untreated subject unresectable metastatic soft tissue sarcoma . The secondary objective assess overall survival , response rate , duration response , progression-free survival regimen use RECIST 1.1 criterion . The exploratory objective assess PFS , ORR , DoR , DCR use immune-related RECIST ( irRECIST ) criterion , evaluate correlation PD-L1 expression level antitumor activity MK-3475 , investigate biomarkers may correlate tumor response , evaluate difference tumor tissue characteristic biopsy take post-treatment MK-3475 versus baseline .</detailed_description>
