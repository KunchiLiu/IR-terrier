	<brief_summary>After meal , level glucose rise circulation . In individual overweight old , blood glucose rise level damage tissue cause health problem . Usually hormone insulin , release pancreas , effectively lower blood glucose . However , overweight old people insulin less effective . Certain food low rise blood glucose , particularly proteins . This work increase release hormone gut call Glucagon-Like Peptide 1 ( GLP-1 ) , turn increase release insulin . A Component milk leave cheese making , term Whey protein , particularly good release GLP-1 . Whey protein use food additive take supplement help build muscle . Whey protein mixture proteins investigator modify effective lowering blood glucose . Using laboratory test investigator identify protein present Whey increase level GLP-1 remove . It 's removal raise level protein effective . In study , investigator would like test effectiveness `` modify '' whey protein . To , 30 old , overweight volunteer recruit give modify whey protein , normal whey protein mixture amino acid breakfast meal raise blood glucose level . These drink give randomise sequence 1 week apart . On visit , blood sample measure blood glucose related hormone level take . As GLP-1 also effect appetite , investigator measure effect modify whey protein subsequent appetite volunteer ask hungry feel .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Modified Whey Protein Effect Post Meal Glucose Levels Study</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The prevalence obesity associate type 2 diabetes rise dramatically , adversely affect health life expectancy increase health care cost . There urgent need low incidence delay onset condition lifestyle-related intervention . Dietary whey protein act gut release GLP-1 insulin release , thereby lower post-meal glucose level satiety . Whey protein mixture proteins investigator modify potentially effective lower blood glucose . Using laboratory test , protein present whey increase level GLP-1 identify remove . Its removal raise level protein effective . The study test effectiveness `` modify '' whey protein . If modify whey protein find effective may use minimise post-meal rise glucose level .</detailed_description>
