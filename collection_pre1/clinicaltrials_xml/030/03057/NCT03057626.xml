	<brief_title>Late Effects After Treatment Patients With Previously Diagnosed High-Risk Neuroblastoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To estimate prevalence organ dysfunction , subsequent malignant neoplasm ( SMN ) , growth impairment , abnormal pubertal development , neurobehavioral dysfunction large cohort representative 5-year survivor high-risk neuroblastoma treated modern therapy . II . To identify demographic , clinical treatment-related risk factor associate increase risk organ dysfunction , SMN , growth impairment , abnormal pubertal development neurobehavioral dysfunction long-term survivor high-risk neuroblastoma . III . To explore impact new biologic therapy diagnostics include immunotherapy , immunocytokines , isotretinoin ( cis-retinoic acid ) iobenguane I-131 ( 131 I-MIBG ) risk late effect . IV . To determine impact impaired organ function , physical growth , pubertal development , neurobehavioral function health-related quality life ( HRQOL ) long-term survivor high-risk neuroblastoma . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . To establish cohort high-risk neuroblastoma survivor , store peripheral blood sample , treat multi-modal therapy since year 2000 resource future investigation . OUTLINE : Patients undergo collection blood urine sample day 1 . Patients also undergo clinical assessment , laboratory , radiographic , ancillary study day 1 .</detailed_description>
