	<brief_summary>Medical titanium plat routinely use fix mobilized bone segment jaw surgery . Generally plat commercialized standard construction specification . Thus repeatedly bend arched match contour anchor jaw bone locate place fasten screw . To prevent stress fatigue induce plate bending improve structural design , utilized three-dimensional printing technique develop new production procedure fabricate customized titanium plate accord patient 's specific skeletal contour dimension derive medical imaging data . In general , three-dimensional printing customized implant expect facilitate surgical operation , reduce application duration improve precise restoration . Up , application three-dimensional printing titanium fixation plat jaw surgery available two center globally . The published preliminary work prove prospect customized titanium plate promote mandibular reconstruction surgery upper maxilla orthognathic surgery though printed titanium plat look rather bulky sample size small still lack qualified randomize controlled trial print conventional titanium plate . To good benefit burgeon use three-dimensional printing health care , imperative conduct feasibility study explore application three-dimensional printing titanium fixation plat jaw surgery base patient . The aim study conduct case series study focus feasibility safety apply three-dimensional printed titanium plat jaw reconstruction surgery orthognathic surgery . The outcome measure include success rate , potential adverse event accuracy . A sample size 48 subject recruit prospectively . Considering fact titanium plat widely use jaw surgery unit large oral maxillofacial surgery center Hong Kong , well-designed customized titanium plate therefore great potential benefit patient population . Furthermore , well-developed three-dimensional manufacturing protocol could also apply relevant medical area push forward personalize medicine era future .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Three-Dimensional Printing Patient-Specific Titanium Plates Jaw Surgery : A Pilot Study</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Plate osteosynthesis basic philosophy maintain skeletal stabilization jaw surgery . Numerous brand osteosynthesis system available make pure titanium titanium alloy standard construction specification . Usually titanium plate bend arch well match three-dimensional contour anchor jaw bone . However optimal bend titanium plate sometimes difficult time-consuming especially inexperienced surgeon complicate case . Excessive bending could also initiate residual stress potentially worsen mechanical property titanium plate ( 1 ) . The three-dimensional ( 3D ) printing , additive manufacturing , well developed fabricate customized material computer-generated digital file . In recent year , 3D print patient-specific medical implant evolve newly-emerged technology powder bed fusion , enable melting metal shape device ( 2 ) . In September 2015 , China 's innovative 3D printed hip joint prosthesis commercially certify China 's State Food Drug Administration . In February 2016 , world 's first 3D print patient-specific titanium cranial/craniofacial plate implant get U.S. Food Drug Administration 's approval . Beyond , number print implant show excellent performance clinical research . These print medical implant majorly pure titanium Ti6Al4V alloy , exhibit good resistance fatigue corrosion consider biocompatible metal ( 3 ) . Relying individualized imaging data , print implant patient-specific adapt anatomical structure precisely . Since additive manufacturing ultimately different conventional multi-step production operation , could reduce cost lead time , especially print complex device individualize case . While clinical application , 3D printing customized implant expect facilitate surgical operation , reduce application duration improve precise restoration ( 4 ) . It predict application 3D printing technique medical area may bring forward another major advance toward personalized medicine ( 5 ) . Many customized medical implant approve future across world . With advent metal additive manufacturing , 3D-printed patient-specific titanium plat successfully fabricate . In 2012 , Per Derand et al . report first application 3D-printed titanium plate establish workflow imaging , via virtual design , manufacture cut guide customize titanium reconstruction plate , utility fibula-based mandibular reconstruction surgery . The pre-printed plate facilitate operation reduce operation duration half hour though postoperative accuracy graft bone modest compare virtual planning ( 6 ) . Simultaneously , Leonardo Ciocca et al . report computer-aided designing manufacturing guide secondary mandibular reconstruction discontinuity defect involve employment surgical guide print titanium reconstruction plate surgical transfer virtual planning ( 7 ) . In 2013 , Simona Mazzoni Leonardo Ciocca et al . applied surgical protocol study group seven mandibular reconstruction patient compare advantage standard pre-plating technique stereolithographic model control group . The result reveal computer-aided surgical protocol viable reproduce patient ' anatomical contour , give surgeon well procedural control reduce procedure time ( 8 ) . In 2015 , Simona Mazzoni et al . develop computer-aided design manufacturing technique fabricate surgical cut guide titanium fixation plat upper maxilla reposition surgery without occlusal wafer . The study result confirm high accuracy transfer virtual planning use surgical guide fixation plate ( 9 ) . In review literature , application 3D printing titanium fixation plat jaw surgery available two center currently : Maxillofacial Surgery Department S Orsola Malpighi Hospital Italy Oral Maxillofacial Surgery Department Lund University Sweden ( 6,7 ) . The published preliminary work prove prospect 3D-printed titanium plat promote mandibular reconstruction surgery upper maxilla orthognathic surgery though printed titanium plat look rather bulky sample size small still lack qualified randomize controlled trial print conventional titanium plate . To good benefit burgeoning use 3D printing health care , develop new design manufacturing protocol print customized fixation plate , design specific load circumstance perfectly adapt anatomical structure jaw . It imperative conduct feasibility study explore application 3D printing titanium fixation plat jaw surgery base patient .</detailed_description>
