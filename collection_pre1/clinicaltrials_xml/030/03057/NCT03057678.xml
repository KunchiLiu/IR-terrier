	<brief_summary>Otologic surgery often involve mastoidectomy safely access inner ear . In procedure , portion mastoid part temporal bone remove . The surgery lengthy challenge many critical structure embed mastoid difficult identify accurately remove surgical drill . In previous work , investigator develop compact , bone-attached robot automate mastoidectomy drill translabyrinthine acoustic neuroma removal ( TANR ) . The robot attach directly bone . Instead , rigid surgical fixture investigator call prepositioning frame ( PPF ) attach temporal bone , robot attache PPF . Attaching robot participant eliminates need expensive image guidance system compensate participant motion , require compact robot limit range motion . The PPF support robot head plan mastoidectomy volume within robot 's range motion . In study , investigator plan test PPF attach ten participant . By process intraoperative CT scan attach PPF , investigator measure percentage plan mastoidectomy would reachable robot attach . The investigator also measure time require attach PPF . The data investigator acquire enable improvement PPF design , would advantageous proceed robotic drilling experiment .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Mastoidectomy common otologic surgical procedure part mastoid portion temporal bone remove surgical drill . The procedure perform treat disease infection mastoiditis cholesteatoma , also perform one step surgery , facial recess approach cochlear implantation ( CI ) translabyrinthine approach acoustic neuroma removal ( TANR ) . The investigator work new medical device assist specifically TANR procedure . The focus study one component device , pre-positioning frame ( PPF ) . TANR surgery perform remove benign tumor auditory nerve cause severe hear balance problem remove . The current standard care mastoidectomy , follow labyrinthectomy ( excision labyrinth inner ear ) gain access skull base , specifically internal auditory canal ( IAC ) , tumor locate . Several critical anatomical structure embed mastoid bone , include facial nerve , control motion face , large blood vessel carotid artery intracranial continuation jugular vein , tegmen , boundary mastoid brain . Surgeons specially train recognize avoid structure drill . Drilling TANR surgery often take several hour due slow advancement drill hard bone labyrinth region . After drill delicate critical portion surgery begin i.e . removal acoustic neuroma . The investigator hypothesize robot , guide pre-operative image , perform drill TANR surgery preserve safe margin around critical structure thus enable surgeon focus delicate , final stage TANR surgery . There several robotic system available orthopedic drilling procedure joint arthroplasty resurfacing . These system include RIO System ( Stryker Mako , Ft. Lauderdale , FL , USA ) , ROBODOC Surgical System ( Think Surgical Corp. , Fremont , CA , USA ) CASPAR ( URS Ortho GMBH &amp; Co. KG , Rastatt , Germany ) . However , system show accurate enough perform TANR surgery safely , rely expensive image guidance system continuously track patient 's position relative robot , order ensure robot-guided drill stay within safe margin . The investigator previously design small light-weight robot attach bone patient 's head , provide require accuracy TANR surgery without expensive image guidance system . To reach entire mastoidectomy volume TANR surgery , robot must correctly position relative patient 's temporal bone anatomy . The investigator hypothesize rigid fixture , investigator call pre-positioning frame ( PPF ) , correctly position robot complete drilling TANR surgery patient population . The goal study investigate first step implement system attach PPF patient undergo standard TANR surgery order well understand time take step optimize surgical workflow . The PPF , attach directly participant head behind ear , use bone screw adapt cranial reconstruction hardware . These bone screw typically use area skull place similar penetration depth 3.5 mm . The safety margin tip screw inside skull surface 0.25mm In future study , robot would attach fiducial marker top surface PPF . Our current PPF design incorporate data ten robotic drilling experiment . Six trial perform excised temporal bone , four perform full cadaver head . Using result experiment , investigator improve shape PPF optimally reach range plan TANR mastoidectomy volume , also improve legs PPF facilitate rapid secure implantation bone screw . The surgical workflow investigator plan full robotic mastoidectomy describe context , clear , step 7 , 8 , 10 perform propose study . 1 . Prior surgery , surgeon manually segment mastoidectomy volume preoperative CT image use investigational software create purpose . 2 . During surgery , PPF anchor temporal bone self-drilling bone screw . 3 . An intraoperative CT scan acquire participant 's head PPF attach use portable CT scanner . 4 . The intraoperative CT image register preoperative CT pre-operative segmentation transform intraoperative CT use registration . 5 . Fiducial marker PPF localize intraoperative CT image , allow pre-operative segmentation data transform intraoperative CT image space . 6 . Robot motion automatically plan use investigational mastoidectomy planning software . 7 . ( The robot fasten fiducial marker PPF , activate execute drill trajectory . The surgeon retain supervisory control robot stop alter speed necessary ) . 8 . ( The robot remove PPF follow completion drill ) . 9 . The PPF remove participant loosen bone screw . 10 . ( The surgeon complete manual surgical action follow mastoidectomy drilling , removal IAC tumor . ) The investigator plan clinically validate improve PPF design perform step ( exclude step 7 , 8 , 10 ) ten participant . Note PPF remove directly step 5 CT image register . Using previously develop robotic mastoidectomy planning software ( step 6 ) , investigator calculate percentage TANR mastoidectomy reachable attach PPF configuration . Step 6 do image collect impact clinical procedure .</detailed_description>
