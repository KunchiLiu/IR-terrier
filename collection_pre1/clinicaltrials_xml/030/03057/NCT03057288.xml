	<brief_summary>It multicenter prospective observational study include consecutive patient esophageal tumor rectum indication radiotherapy The main objective study evaluate feasibility fiducial marker placement EUS guidance . The evaluation criterion : - Success rate evaluation placement two marker : one upper part tumor one low part . Success procedure evaluate endoscopist end procedure . Pictures marker objectify good placement marker . - Complications ( early within 24 hour late complication ) pain , bleeding , perforation , infection , migration marker - The length procedure - The cost ( procedure , hospitalization ) - The clinical efficacy , study decrease estimate target volume , decrease dose deliver healthy tissue improvement position irradiation beam radiotherapy technician - The presence marker end radiotherapy</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Prospective Study Evaluating Feasibility Fiducial Markers Placement Patients With Esophageal Rectal Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>- Rational Cancers rectum esophagus affect 15 000 4300 people per year France ( TNCD , national digestive cancer thesaurus ) . Their prognosis remain bleak , particularly due late diagnosis , 5-year survival rate 10 % cancer esophagus 55 % 5 year rectal cancer ( TNCD ) . When diagnosed advanced stage ( &gt; T2 N + ) , treatment radiotherapy +/- chemotherapy indicate . The precise definition macroscopic tumor volume radiotherapy represent important difficulty base endoscopic image data obtain condition different use preparation radiotherapy treatment . A good definition target tumor volume use radiopaque marker know fiducial marker would likely improve efficacy tolerance treatment , even allow additional irradiation would target precisely tumor . - Objectives : The main objective study evaluate feasibility fiducial marker placement EUS guidance . The secondary objective evaluate : - Complications ( early within 24 hour late complication ) pain , bleeding , perforation , infection , migration marker - The length procedure - The cost ( procedure , hospitalization ) - The clinical efficacy , study decrease estimate target volume , decrease dose deliver healthy tissue improvement position irradiation beam radiotherapy technician - The presence marker end radiotherapy primary secondary â€¢ Research methodology It prospective multicenter study , 18 center participate . Forty patient include period 24 month .</detailed_description>
