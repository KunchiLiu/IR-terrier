	<brief_title>A Safety Efficacy Study TALEN CRISPR/Cas9 Treatment HPV-related Cervical Intraepithelial NeoplasiaⅠ</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>HPV persistent infection major causal factor cervical intraepithelial neoplasia ( CIN ) cervical cancer . The important role E6 E7 play HPV-driven carcinogenesis make attractive target therapeutic intervention . Previous evidence show use designate TALEN CRISPR/Cas9 genome edit tool could produce disruption HPV16 HPV18 E6/E7 DNA , significantly decrease expression E6/E7 , induce cell apoptosis inhibit cell line growth . This study evaluate safety efficacy TALEN-HPV E6/E7 CRISPR/Cas9-HPV E6/E7 treat HPV Persistency HPV-related Cervical Intraepithelial NeoplasiaⅠ</detailed_description>
