In Phase 2 , subject undergo 12 week sofosbuvir/velpatasvir therapy initiate 2 week postpartum . Feasibility/acceptability adherence sofosbuvir/velpatasvir assess 4 , 8 12 week therapy . In Phase 3 , subject continue follow 15 month treatment completion . Treatment effectiveness SVR evaluate 3 month rate IVDU recidivism , HCV reinfection patient center outcome health relate quality life ( QOL ) assess 6 , 9 12 month follow treatment completion .</brief_summary>
