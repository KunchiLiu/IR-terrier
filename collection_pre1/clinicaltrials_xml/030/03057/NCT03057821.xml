	<brief_title>Propionibacterium Acnes Shoulder Arthroplasty</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Over half post-operative infection shoulder arthroplasty due Propionibacterium acne . Even apparently `` aseptic '' revision , nearly culture take time revision surgery positive P acne , thus low-grade infection bacteria may common cause failure previously suspect . Current antibiotic prophylaxis method ineffective P acne . Despite intravenous cefazolin , P acne culture glenohumeral joint 42 % patient undergoing primary total shoulder arthroplasty . Despite skin preparation chlorhexidine , P acnes culture 73 % portal site arthroscopy . P acne insensitive alcohol . Dermatologists long treat P acne primary cause acne vulgaris . One popular effective treatment acne vulgaris topical benzoyl peroxide . A prior prospective clinical trial demonstrate add topical 5 % benzoyl peroxide 48 hour prior surgery reduce P acne culture positivity 6 % . The downside treatment must apply patient , home , 48 hour prior surgery . An additional downside benzoyl peroxide skin irritant patient tolerate . In aqueous environment , benzoyl peroxide rapidly decompose benzoic acid hydrogen peroxide . Benzoic acid skin irritant hydrogen peroxide active ingredient . Benzoyl peroxide use instead hydrogen peroxide hydrogen peroxide breaks water oxygen expose light . Recently , stabilize form hydrogen peroxide develop demonstrate equally effective benzoyl peroxide treatment acne vulgaris . One potential reason hydrogen peroxide 's efficacy P acne absorb skin , address P acne reside sebaceous gland . To date , study examine whether addition hydrogen peroxide pre-operative skin preparation reduce intra-operative P acne culture positivity .</detailed_description>
