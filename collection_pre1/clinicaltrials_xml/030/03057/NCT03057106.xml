	<brief_summary>Durvalumab new type drug many kind cancer . It consider `` immunotherapy '' `` chemotherapy '' . Laboratory test show work allow immune system detect cancer reactivate immune response . This may help slow growth cancer may cause cancer cell die . Durvalumab show shrink tumour animal study 5000 people seem promise . Tremelimumab new type drug various type cancer . It work similar way durvalumab may improve effect durvalumab . Tremelimumab may also help slow growth cancer cell may cause cancer cell die . It show shrink tumour animal study 1200 people seem promising .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Durvalumab Tremelimumab ± Platinum-Based Chemotherapy Patients With Metastatic Squamous Non-Squamous NSCLC</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Combinations durvalumab tremelimumab also study . While combination study 200 people , clear offer well result combined chemotherapy . Recently , immunotherapy target PD-1/PD-L1 axis show promise treat patient non-small cell lung cancer .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Patients must histologically and/or cytologically confirm diagnosis squamous nonsquamous , nonsmall cell carcinoma lung . Patients poorly differentiate tumour eligible NSCLC confirm immunohistochemistry marker ( TTF1/P63 P40/CK5 ) . Patients know EGFR mutation know ALKfusion eligible . Patients must high risk , define presence one follow unfavourable prognostic factor : Stage IVB disease Stage IVA disease least one following : Elevated LDH , Weight loss ≥ 5 % 3 month randomization , Poorly differentiate histology . Patients must adequate histopathology specimen must consent release specimen protocol require testing . This mandatory component study . Patient must consent provision sample blood order specific correlative marker assay proscribe may conduct . All patient must measurable disease define RECIST 1.1 All radiology study must perform within 28 day prior randomization ( within 35 day negative ) . The criterion define measurable disease follow : CT scan ( slice thickness 5 mm ) ≥ 10 mm &gt; long diameter Physical exam ( use caliper ) ≥ 10 mm Lymph node CT scan ≥ 15 mm &gt; measure short axis Measurable lesion must outside previous radiotherapy field sole site disease , unless disease progression document . Patients must 18 year age old . ECOG performance status 0 1 . Absolute neutrophils ≥ 1.5 x 10^9/L Platelets ≥ 100 x 10^9/L Hemoglobin ≥ 90 g/L Bilirubin ≤ 1.5 x UNL ( upper limit normal ) AST ALT ≤ 2.5 x UNL Creatinine clearance ≥ 45 mL/min Cytotoxic Chemotherapy : Patients may receive prior cytotoxic chemotherapy advanced/metastatic disease . Adjuvant Chemotherapy : Patients may prior adjuvant therapy completely resect disease , provide complete least 12 month prior randomization . Patients treat concurrent chemotherapy/radiation regimens unresectable locally advanced Stage III disease eligible provide complete least 12 month prior randomization . Other Systemic Therapy : Patients may receive prior EGFR alk inhibitor . Patients may receive prior treatment immunebased therapy , include durvalumab tremelimumab vaccine oncolytic viral therapy . Patients must recover reversible treatment related toxicity prior randomization . Radiation : Prior external beam radiation permit provide minimum 28 day ( 4 week ) elapse last dose radiation date randomization . ( Exceptions may make however , low dose , nonmyelosuppressive radiotherapy . Note : exception give radiation lung abdomen due risk immune mediate organ toxicity ) . Concurrent radiotherapy permit . Patients must recover acute toxic effect radiation prior randomization . Surgery : Previous surgery permit provide wound heal occur least 14 day elapse ( major surgery ) prior randomization . Patient must able ( i.e . sufficiently fluent ) willing complete quality life health economics questionnaire . Patient consent must appropriately obtain accordance applicable local regulatory requirement . Patients must accessible treatment followup . All randomized patient must follow treated participate centre . In accordance CCTG policy , protocol treatment begin within 2 work day patient randomization . Female patient childbearing potential sexually active nonsterilized male partner must use least one highly effective method contraception study 6 month last dose durvalumab tremelimumab 3 month last dose durvalumab alone Patients history malignancy , except : adequately treat nonmelanoma skin cancer , curatively treated insitu cancer cervix , solid tumour curatively treat evidence disease ≥ 3 year . Active prior document autoimmune inflammatory disorder ( include inflammatory bowel disease ( e.g . colitis Crohn 's disease ) , diverticulitis exception diverticulosis , celiac disease serious gastrointestinal chronic condition associate diarrhea ) , systemic lupus erythematosus , Sarcoidosis syndrome , Wegener syndrome ( granulomatosis polyangiitis ) , rheumatoid arthritis , hypophysitis , uveitis , etc. , within past 3 year prior start treatment . The following exception criterion : Patients alopecia . Patients Grave 's disease , vitiligo psoriasis require systemic treatment ( within last 2 year ) . Patients hypothyroidism ( e.g . follow Hashimoto syndrome ) stable hormone replacement . History primary immunodeficiency , history allogenic organ transplant require therapeutic immunosuppression use immunosuppressive agent within 28 day randomization* prior history severe ( grade 3 4 ) immune mediate toxicity immune therapy grade ≥ 3 infusion reaction . Live attenuate vaccination administer within 30 day prior randomization History hypersensitivity durvalumab tremelimumab excipient . Patients receive treatment antibody must intolerable toxicity require steroid manage toxicity . Mean QT interval correct heart rate use Fridericia 's formula ( QTcF ) ≥ 470 msec screen ECG measure use standard institutional method history familial long QT syndrome . Patients untreated and/or uncontrolled cardiovascular condition and/or symptomatic cardiac dysfunction ( unstable angina , congestive heart failure , myocardial infarction within previous year cardiac ventricular arrhythmia require medication , history 2nd 3rd degree atrioventricular conduction defect ) . Patients significant cardiac history , even control , LVEF ≥ 45 % . ( Note : patient uncomplicated controlled hypertension require LVEF measurement absence significant cardiac history ) Concurrent treatment investigational drug anticancer therapy Patients untreated brain meningeal metastasis eligible . Patients treat CNS disease radiologic AND clinical evidence stable brain metastasis , evidence cavitation hemorrhage brain lesion , eligible provide asymptomatic require corticosteroid ( must discontinue steroid least 1 week prior randomization ) . Pregnant Lactating Women : Women childbearing potential must pregnancy test ( urine serum ) proven negative within 14 day prior randomization . If urine test positive , pregnancy testing may include ultrasound ruleout pregnancy falsepositive suspect . For example , betahuman chorionic gonadotropin high partner vasectomize , may associate tumour production hCG , see cancer . Patient consider eligible ultrasound negative pregnancy . Men woman childbearing potential must agree use adequate contraception . Patients serious illness medical condition would permit patient manage accord protocol ( include corticosteroid administration ) , would put patient risk . This include limited : Contraindications use pemetrexed , gemcitabine , cisplatin and/or carboplatin ( consult product monograph ) ; History significant neurologic psychiatric disorder would impair ability obtain consent limit compliance study requirement ; Active infection require systemic therapy ; ( include patient know active hepatitis B , hepatitis C human immunodeficiency virus ( HIV ) tuberculosis ) ; Active peptic ulcer disease gastritis ; Known pneumonitis pulmonary fibrosis clinically significant impairment pulmonary function .</criteria>
