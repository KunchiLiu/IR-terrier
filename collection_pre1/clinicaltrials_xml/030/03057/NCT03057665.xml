	<detailed_description>The goal study evaluation atomic magnetometer adult fetal MCG study . The investigator ass signal-to-noise bandwidth performance human acquisition condition . They also gain experience practical issue associate make measurement human subject . The measurement session take place magnetically shield room UW Biomagnetism Laboratory , similar study make SQUID detector 20 year , without incident . The room contain bed and/or chair subject may comfortably lie sit . The subject remove metal magnetic object ( e.g . watch , glass , jewelry , coin ) change metal-free clothing . The subject put laser eye protection goggles . The subject lie sit patient bed magnetically shielded room chest ( stomach case pregnant mother ) close possible magnetometer ( typically 1 cm away ) , monitor closely small opening shield room ensure comfort throughout study . Positioning device respect patient do one researcher . In case pregnant woman , ultrasound take ascertain position baby facilitate initial position magnetometer . Depending need possible positioning , researcher may may leave room device positioning . The subject ask remain still data acquisition . ( Should subject become uncomfortable simply need move around , complete freedom particular measurement terminate . ) Visual audio contact subject maintain time via open window magnetically shield room . Using atomic magnetometer , five-minute MCG recording make several location order map signal . The recording analyze off-line . An MCG fMCG may also record Dr. Wakai 's commercial Magnes Tristan SQUID magnetometer , use similar acquisition parameter process procedure AM . The purpose SQUID measurement compare attain waveform . Processing procedure SQUID data identical atomic magnetometer data . A typical recording session consist 10 minute magnetometer alignment optimization , follow several 5-minute magnetometer acquisition period separate rest break subject relax preliminary data analysis conduct researcher . The session may complete SQUID measurement , require additional 15 minute , brief exit interview see subject comfort issue identify session . The total recording session take 2 hour .</detailed_description>
