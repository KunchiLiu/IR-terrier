	<brief_title>Optimal Insulin Correction Factor Post- High Intensity Exercise Hyperglycemia Adults With Type 1 Diabetes ( FIT )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>FIT open-label , repeat measure cross-over study . The overall objective study investigate glycemic response 0 % , 50 % , 100 % 150 % bolus insulin correction ( base personal insulin correction factor ) post-exercise hyperglycemia physically active adult type 1 diabetes ( T1D ) use multiple daily injection ( MDI ) control , clinically representative , experimental setting . Following 2 week screen phase , patient enter 8 week transition insulin glargine U300 ( Toujeo® ) another basal insulin , order optimize insulin dose determine individual insulin correction factor . The final phase study intervention phase , consist 4 separate visit . At visit , patient perform 15 minute high intensity exercise morning . If become hyperglycemic following exercise ( blood glucose &gt; 8.0 mmol/L ) , receive one four insulin correction dos ( 0 % 50 % , 100 % , 150 % usual correction factor ) randomize order . They monitor clinical pharmacology unit study staff rest day overnight . The patient wear continuous glucose monitor ( CGM ) intervention visit . The primary outcome study great net reduction plasma glucose ( YSI ) follow 50 % , 100 % 150 % bolus insulin correction post-exercise hyperglycemia , compare bolus insulin correction . Key secondary outcome include mean time spend post-exercise hyperglycemia ( &gt; 8.0 mmol/L ) , post-exercise euglycemia ( 4.0-8.0 mmol/L ) post-exercise hypoglycaemia ( ≤ 3.9 mmol/L ) within 180 minute 24 hour follow bolus insulin correction .</detailed_description>

Insulin total daily dose ( TDD ) ≥ 30 U/day In good general health know condition could influence outcome trial , judgement Investigator good candidate study base review available medical history , physical examination clinical laboratory evaluation Willing adhere protocol requirement duration study Exclusion Criteria Pregnant lactate Active diabetic retinopathy ( proliferative diabetic retinopathy , vitreous haemorrhage past 6 month ) could potentially worsen exercise protocol Any evidence unstable cardiovascular disease , disorder abnormality per physician 's discretion . . Currently follow low calorie weightloss diet may impact glucose control mask primary secondary outcome measure More one episode severe hypoglycemia seizure , coma require assistance another person past 6 month Known hypoglycemia unawareness Use acetaminophen ( Tylenol ) runin phase study period Medications insulin might impact outcome measure : Beta blocker Agents affect hepatic glucose production beta adrenergic agonist antagonist , xanthine derivative Pramlintide Any noninsulin diabetes therapy</criteria>
