	<brief_title>A Pilot Study Of Ga-68-DOTA-TOC Imaging In Participants With Small Bowel Carcinoid Tumors</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This research study Pilot Study , first time investigator examine study intervention . Many patient diagnose carcinoid tumor undergo treatment long act release ( LAR ) octreotide . It presently standard patient receive equal dos octreotide . However , response treatment dose medication may vary substantially one person another . This study use novel form PET/MR image see good understand treat carcinoid tumor , may future allow doctor tailor treatment dose base PET/MR finding select right drug dose individual person . It important note participant method treatment dose participant medication ( Octreotide LAR ) change study . The imaging technique use study call Ga-68-DOTA-TOC PET/MR scan . Ga-68-DOTA-TOC radioactive tracer give vein participant PET scan . The scanner detect radioactivity tracer attach cell within body use information create image ( picture ) computer screen analyze . These type scan investigational . `` Investigational '' , mean scan still study research doctor try find . It also mean FDA ( U.S. Food Drug Administration ) approve type PET scan type cancer .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Age ≥ 18 year Have histologically cytologically confirm small bowel carcinoid tumor Receiving stable dose octreotide LAR part treatment regimen ≥3months Presently plan ongoing octreotide accord current standard care least 18 month ( i.e . throughout study followup period ) . Presently plan restaging use contrastenhanced CT scan baseline least every 6 month , part standard care assessment . The effect Ga68DOTATOC develop human fetus unknown . For reason PET imaging agent know teratogenic , woman childbearing potential men must agree use adequate contraception ( hormonal barrier method birth control ; abstinence ) prior study entry duration study participation . Should woman become pregnant suspect pregnant partner participate study , inform treat physician immediately . Men treat enrol protocol must also agree use adequate contraception prior study , duration study participation , 4 month completion Ga68DOTATOC administration . Ability understand willingness sign write informed consent document . Participants radiotherapy within 4 week prior enter study recover adverse event due agent administer 4 week earlier . Participants know brain metastasis exclude clinical trial poor prognosis often develop progressive neurologic dysfunction would confound evaluation neurologic adverse event . History allergic reaction IV contrast reaction attribute compound similar chemical biologic composition Ga68DOTATOC use study . Uncontrolled intercurrent illness include , limited , ongoing active infection , symptomatic congestive heart failure , unstable angina pectoris , cardiac arrhythmia , psychiatric illness/social situation would limit compliance study requirement . Pregnant woman exclude study Ga68DOTATOC potential teratogenic abortifacient effect . Because unknown potential risk adverse event nurse infant secondary administration Ga68DOTATOC mother , breastfeed mother also exclude study . Expected lifespan less 18 month investigator assessment Previous hypersensitivity reaction LAR octreotide Nonremovable nonMR compatible placement include hearing aid denture , metal IUD , surgical aneurysm clip , cardiac pacemaker , prosthetic heart valve , neurostimulator , implanted pump , cochlear implant , metal rod , plat screw , surgery leave implanted material , metal injury eye , metallic tattoo anywhere body , tattoo near eye transdermal patch History Meniere 's disease</criteria>
