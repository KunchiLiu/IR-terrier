	<brief_summary>Title : Active surveillance adverse event follow immunization trivalent influenza vaccine ( split virion inactivate ) produce Butantan Institute . Rationale background : Since 2013 , IB perform passive pharmacovigilance activity relate TIV . Data source safety surveillance currently include data share National Immunization Program data collect IB´s customer service channel . IB implement active surveillance study part pharmacovigilance plan order well define incidence select adverse event follow immunization ( AEFI ) TIV , passive surveillance activity continue . Obtaining pharmacovigilance data TIV , via active surveillance , implement response WHO requirement pre-qualification TIV . Prequalification vaccine allow use multiple region around world . Study objectives : Primary objective : characterize estimate incidence solicit adverse event follow immunization ( AEFI ) associate administration trivalent influenza vaccine produce Butantan Institute ( TIV ) . Secondary objective : 1 ) characterize estimate incidence overall ( solicit unsolicited ) AEFI associate administration TIV ; 2 ) characterize estimate incidence unsolicited AEFI associate administration TIV . Study Design : This prospective cohort study aim identify evaluate adverse event follow immunization among individual vaccinate TIV national immunization campaign . The design include active surveillance phone contact visit study site . Health facility designate set sentinel sit enroll individual vaccinate IB TIV active follow solicit AEFI occur within first 14 day post-vaccination , unsolicited AEFI 6 week post-vaccination . Population : The follow group target group national immunization campaign recruit participation study : - child six month five year old ; - pregnant woman ; postpartum woman ( mother 45 day birth ) ; - healthcare worker ; - elderly ( people 60 year old ) . Variables : Solicited AEFI monitor include local reaction ( erythema , pain , swell , ecchymosis , pruritus induration ) , systemic reaction ( headache , fever , malaise , arthralgia , myalgia , rash , chill , pruritus , fatigue , sweat ) irritability persistent cry ( child 6 year ) . Unsolicited AEFI report period 6 week post-vaccination record . All adverse event report study MedDRA cod . Other variable interest study demographic information study participant : date birth , gender , age , ethnicity , well vaccination information include date immunization , site , vaccine lot . Data Sources : Study information include sign symptom follow immunization TIV record daily 14 day post immunization , record participant 's study file . Study Size : A total 900 individual ( 300 health care worker , 300 elderly , 100 pregnant woman , 100 post-partum woman 100 child six month five year old ) , present immunization IB TIV , agree participate providing Informed Consent , enrol study study staff . Data Analyses : Descriptive approach use meet defined objective describe protocol , well formal statistical test appropriate . Incidence rate ( IR ) AEFI TIV calculate number event divide total number participant expose TIV target group period follow . IR calculate base total person time follow-up , 95 % confidence interval calculate .</brief_summary>
