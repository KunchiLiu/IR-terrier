	<brief_summary>The investigator plan assess efficacy standard low dose HCTZ treatment recurrence prevention calcium-containing kidney stone . More specifically , investigator aim assess dose-response relationship three different dosage HCTZ . Study intervention : HCTZ 12.5 mg , 25 mg 50 mg daily per o 24 36 month . In addition , patient HCTZ treatment arm receive state-of-the-art non-pharmacologic recommendation stone prevention accord current guideline . Control intervention : Placebo daily per o 24 36 month . In addition , patient placebo arm receive state-of-the-art non-pharmacologic recommendation stone prevention accord current guideline .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Randomized Double-blind Placebo-controlled Trial Assessing Efficacy Standard Low Dose Hydrochlorothiazide Treatment Prevention Recurrent Nephrolithiasis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Nephrolithiasis global healthcare problem current lifetime risk 18.8 % men 9.4 % woman . Without specific treatment , 5- 20-year recurrence rate 40 % 75 % , respectively . Given high cost medical treatment surgical intervention well morbidity relate symptomatic stone disease , medical prophylaxis stone recurrence attractive approach . About 80-90 % stone compose calcium oxalate various admixture calcium phosphate . Increased excretion calcium urine , hypercalciuria , common metabolic abnormality encounter patient recurrent nephrolithiasis . Thiazide diuretics cornerstone pharmacologic metaphylaxis 40 year . The effect thiazides reduce risk stone recurrence attribute ability decrease urinary calcium excretion . However , factor , reduction urinary pH urinary oxalate excretion , probably contribute effect . Efficacy thiazides recurrence prevention calcareous nephrolithiasis test 11 randomize control trial ( RCTs ) . With exception two trial , thiazide significantly reduce stone recurrence . Most trial 1980 's 90 's cumulative number patient study remarkably low prevalent disease . Our systematic review RCTs reveal major methodological deficiency trial , include : lack double-blinding intention-to-treat analysis , unclear allocation concealment , lack adverse event drop report unknown baseline risk disease severity . Furthermore , high dos thiazide employed trial , case best study thiazide , hydrochlorothiazide ( HCTZ ) , 100 mg daily . At high dos , side effect occur frequently . Nowadays , thiazides widely use treatment recurrent nephrolithiasis arterial hypertension , significantly low dos . In case recurrent nephrolithiasis , however , practice support randomized evidence consequently , investigator know whether currently employ low dose thiazide regimen effective reduce risk stone recurrence . Thus , evidence benefit harm thiazide diuretic prevention calcium-containing kidney stone general remain unclear . In addition , efficacy currently employ low dose thiazide regimens prevent stone recurrence know .</detailed_description>
