	<brief_title>Combination Study Prexasertib Olaparib Patients With Advanced Solid Tumors</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This research study Phase I clinical trial , test safety investigational intervention also try define appropriate dose investigational intervention use study . `` Investigational '' mean intervention study . The FDA ( U.S. Food Drug Administration ) approve LY2606368 treatment disease . The FDA ( U.S. Food Drug Administration ) approve Olaparib ovarian cancer approve us . LY2606368 checkpoint kinase 1 ( CHK1 ) inhibitor develop treatment patient advance cancer . CHK1 inhibitor work prevent cancer cell able repair damage DNA ( one building block cell ) lead cell death . Olaparib poly ( ADP-ribose ) polymerase ( PARP ) inhibitor . PARP protein body repairs damage DNA . In cell rapidly grow cancer cell , block repair DNA may benefit , since cause cell die . In research study , investigator combine LY2606368 Olaparib hop safe combination LY2606368 enhance cancer respond Olaparib . In previous laboratory study perform treat cancer cell CHK1 inhibitor PARP inhibitor , find CHK1 inhibitor successful increase efficacy .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Written inform consent obtain prior studyspecific procedure consider part routine medical care . Patients must histologically confirm solid tumor metastatic unresectable , available therapy likely convey clinical benefit . Patients must measurable disease RECIST version 1.1 . Measurable disease define least one dimension ( long diameter record nonnodal lesion short axis nodal lesion ) ≥ 20mm ( ≥ 2cm ) conventional technique ≥ 10mm ( ≥ 1cm ) spiral compute tomography ( CT ) scan , MRI , caliper clinical exam . See Section 11 evaluation measurable disease . There limit prior line therapy ; however , patient must recover eligibility level prior toxicity adverse event result previous treatment prior enter study ( except alopecia ) . Age ≥18 year , dose adverse event data currently available use prexasertib combination olaparib patient &lt; 18 year age , child exclude study . ECOG performance status 01 . PERFORMANCE STATUS CRITERIA . Patients must normal organ marrow function define : absolute neutrophil count ≥ 1,500/microliters platelet ≥ 100,000/microliters white blood cell ( WBC ) ≥ 3 x 109/L hemoglobin ≥ 10 g/dL total bilirubin ≤ 1.5 x institutional upper limit normal ( ULN ) AST ( SGOT ) /ALT ( SGPT ) ≤2.5 x institutional ULN ≤ 5 x institutional ULN set liver mets creatinine ≤ 1.5X institutional ULN OR creatinine clearance ≥60 mL/min CockcroftGault equation participant creatinine level institutional normal . The effect prexasertib olaparib develop human fetus unknown . For reason , woman childbearing potential male patient partner childbearing potential must agree use two highly effective form contraception ( see Section 5.5.2 ) prior study entry , duration study participation , 3 month completion study . Men treat enrol protocol must also agree use adequate contraception prior study , duration study participation , 3 month completion prexasertib olaparib administration . Should woman become pregnant suspect pregnant partner participate study , inform treat physician immediately . Women childbearing potential enrolling study must negative serum pregnancy test prior registration . Childbearing potential defined woman postmenopausal ( define amenorrheic ≥ 12 month follow cessation exogenous hormonal treatment ; LH FSH level postmenopausal range woman 50 ; radiationinduced oophorectomy last menses &gt; 12 month prior ; chemotherapyinduced menopause last menses &gt; 12 month prior ) surgically sterile ( bilateral oophorectomy hysterectomy ) . Ability understand willingness sign write informed consent document . Patients must willing able comply protocol duration study include undergoing treatment schedule visit examination . Patients must able tolerate oral medication gastrointestinal process would preclude absorption olaparib . Patients chemotherapy radiotherapy within 3 week ( 6 week nitrosoureas mitomycin C ) prior enter study . Patients receive prior PARP inhibitor exclude . Patients receive prior CHK1 inhibitor exclude . Participants undergone major surgery within 14 day start study treatment , participant recover baseline status effect surgery receive 14 day prior . Patients receive investigational agent . Patients know brain metastasis carcinomatous meningitis exclude clinical trial , exception patient brain metastatic disease previously treat remain stable MRI ≥ 2 month prior enrollment , without steroid antiepileptic medication . These patient may enrol discretion Principal Investigator . History allergic reaction attribute compound similar chemical biologic composition prexasertib olaparib . Uncontrolled intercurrent illness include , limited , ongoing active infection , symptomatic congestive heart failure , unstable angina pectoris , cardiac arrhythmia , uncontrolled seizure , myocardial infarction within past 3 month , superior vena cava syndrome , unstable spinal cord compression ( untreated unstable least 28 day prior study entry ) , psychiatric illness/social situation would limit compliance study requirement . Additionally , patient comorbid disease metabolic dysfunction would render subject high risk treatment complication may exclude discretion Principal Investigator interest patient safety . The effect prexasertib olaparib develop human fetus unknown . For reason , pregnant woman exclude study . Because unknown potential risk adverse event nurse infant secondary treatment mother prexasertib olaparib , breastfeed woman also exclude . Known HIVpositive participant combination antiretroviral therapy ineligible potential pharmacokinetic interaction prexasertib olaparib . In addition , participant increase risk lethal infection treat marrowsuppressive therapy . Participants know active Hepatitis B C. Participants receive previous allogeneic bone marrow transplant . Consistent QTc &gt; 470 msec one screening ECGs . Patients history long QTc syndrome personal family history ventricular arrhythmia exclude . Participants involvement plan and/or conduct study ( applies AstraZeneca staff and/or staff study site ) . Participants receive medication substance strong moderate inhibitor inducer CYP3A4 ineligible . Please see Section 5.5.1 detail require washout period . Because list agent constantly change , important regularly consult frequently updated list http : //medicine.iupui.edu/clinpharm/ddis/table.aspx ; medical reference text Physicians ' Desk Reference may also provide information . As part enrollment/informed consent procedure , patient counsel risk interaction agent , new medication need prescribe patient consider new overthecounter medicine herbal product . Participants history myelodysplastic syndrome acute myeloid leukemia . Participants evidence pneumonitis scan screen exclude due pulmonary toxicity associate olaparib</criteria>
