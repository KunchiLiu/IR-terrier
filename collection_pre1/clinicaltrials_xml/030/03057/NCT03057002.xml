	<detailed_description>In study investigator propose detect early mitochondrial metabolic change heart patient positive genotype phenotype HCM use novel hyperpolarized [ 1-13C ] pyruvate MRI methodology . Carbon-13 stable isotope ( radioactive ) make approximately 1.1 % natural carbon . Carbon-13 non-zero spin quantum number allow investigation carbon contain substance use magnetic resonance . However , compare analytical method , carbon-13 magnetic resonance limit intrinsically low sensitivity [ 2 } . Recent experimental study suggest alter energy substrate metabolism may precede structural change myocardial hypertrophy . A good understanding myocardial metabolic change HCM important , elucidation change may precede clinical development myocardial fibrosis malignant arrhythmia . Hyperpolarized [ 1-13C ] pyruvate cellular metabolic flux assess 10,000-fold high sensitivity compare traditional method . The aim pilot study test hypothesis patient HCM present focal alteration myocardial hyperpolarized [ 1-13C ] pyruvate flux . To achieve aim investigator assess myocardial metabolic change HCM subject positive HCM genotype phenotype ( n=5 ) healthy control subject ( n=5 ) match age , sex , Body Mass Index ( BMI ) . Total target enrollment set 15 subject allow attrition screen failure . Cardiac function structure evaluate MRI ( proton image ) contrast administration . Then myocardial metabolism assess utilizing MRS ( carbon spectroscopy ) intravenous injection hyperpolarized [ 1-13C ] pyruvate . The study agent , hyperpolarized [ 1-13C ] pyruvate , administer Food Drug Administration ( FDA ) Investigational New Drug ( IND ) , currently review process , PI Dr. Craig Malloy . Human preliminary data essential secure large scale funding require clinical study . The identification mitochondrial metabolic change precede replacement fibrosis malignant arrhythmia may generate paradigm shift early detection target treatment HCM potentially improve clinical outcome . Cardiac focus application Advanced Imaging Research Center , genetic disease diagnosis Eugene McDermott Center Human Genetics development dedicate HCM Clinic UT Southwestern Medical Center offer today unique opportunity lead globally translational scientific effort field .</detailed_description>
