	<detailed_description>This pilot feasibility study Cognitive Behavioral Coping Skills ( CBCS ) Group Intervention representative sample patient Hepatitis C viral ( HCV ) undergo standard antiviral treatment small RCT examine ( 1 ) study feasibility , ( 2 ) effect size estimate , ( 3 ) whether clinically significant improvement occur key outcomes . This pilot study allow investigator test hypothesis study procedure feasible participation CBCS-HCV group acceptable useful participant . Furthermore , effect size estimate key outcome variable determine outcomes appear improve result intervention potentially evaluated future efficacy study . Several patient-reported outcome ( PROs ) evaluate : health-related quality life ( HrQOL ) , perceive stress , depression , anxiety , anger , fatigue , sleep , pain medication adherence . The investigator also determine group participation affect viral cure rate . Change score effect size &gt; .35 consider potentially clinically significant reasonable evaluate large efficacy study . Study feasibility element evaluate include : feasibility RCT study design , intervention delivery , patient acceptability , therapist protocol fidelity , recruitment , enrollment , attendance , retention data collection . The investigator plan enroll evaluate intervention two wave study participant ( Wave 2 , Wave 3 ) . When block 12 patient consent Wave 2 , participant randomize standard care ( SC ; n=6 ) CBCS-HCV group intervention ( n=6 ) . The procedure use consent randomize 12 patient Wave 3 SC vs CBCS-HCV . Patients randomize CBCS participate 4 weekly CBCS session prior start HCV treatment , 5 session HCV treatment , day attend follow-up treatment visit week 2 , 4 , 6 , 8 , 12 . Outcome data collect baseline ( T1 ) , prior HCV treatment start ( T2 ) ; week 8 HCV treatment ( T3 ) , end CBCS intervention/ HCV treatment week 12 ( T4 ) , 1-month post-CBCS intervention/ HCV treatment ( T5 ) . The primary outcome change total HrQOL score . Secondary outcome change PROs note . Additional secondary outcome group difference medication adherence viral cure rate . Elements study feasibility also evaluate .</detailed_description>
