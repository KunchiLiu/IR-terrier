	<brief_summary>Intravenous lidocaine commonly give intravenous ( IV ) line prior injection propofol reduce amount pain propofol injection . The investigator want study give lidocaine IV forearm limb tourniquet apply prevent `` wash '' lidocaine prior propofol injection help reduce propofol injection pain .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Comparison Two Techniques IV Lidocaine Propofol Injection Pain</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The investigator expect tourniquet lidocaine superior straight non-tourniquet lidocaine reduce propofol injection pain . The investigator also want determine association tourniquet duration reduction pain propofol administration . Small study indicate 60 second tourniquet lidocaine superior 30 second less tourniquet duration mixed lidocaine/propofol injection . The investigator suspect many clinician use 60-second tourniquet technique due extra time involve hypothesize practical application apply tourniquet soon patient position operate table widely adopt clinician cause delay also provide necessary amount time benefit tourniquet . The investigator also want record time tourniquet application start propofol administration , investigator predict would least 60 second see correlation duration venous stasis IV lidocaine pain benefit . Methods Measures Design This conduct randomize control trial two method administer lidocaine prior propofol injection . Setting The study set locate within North Carolina Baptist Health , academic medical center , Endoscopy Suite Outpatient Surgery Center subject schedule receive propofol part sedation anesthetic . Sample Size The investigator estimate 25 subject two group require test hypothesis base prior study . Interventions Interactions The investigator use two group : - Group 1 : 50mg 2 % lidocaine give prior propofol dose IV line . - Group 2 : 50mg 2 % lidocaine give IV venous occlusion apply patient position operating room table time onset propofol administration . The tourniquet investigator use McKesson Quick Release tourniquet apply forearm 10cm distal elbow joint tourniquet group . Venous stasis confirm cessation flow hang IV fluid . For group , premedication give , normal practice procedure . Study procedures involve place 20 gauge intravenous ( IV ) catheter vein distal mid forearm . Venous occlusion achieve either latex free tourniquet McKesson Quick Release tourniquet apply forearm 10cm distal elbow joint . Tourniquet pressure somewhat variable sufficient cause venous stasis confirm flow hanging IV fluid . Injections deliver roughly 1 ml/sec . Schedule event study ( perform 1 2 investigator : - Day procedure : hold area - Consent subject study participation - Randomly assign patient one two group - Day procedure : procedure area -Accompany subject operating procedure room , perform protocol group subject assign , note outcome measure self-described discomfort observer grade discomfort - Day procedure : recovery area -Revisit subject recovery 30 minute procedure determine post-procedure recall discomfort - Post-study period - Analyze data Analytical Plan The investigator analyze result initially use descriptive statistic . Comparison group do use chi square test proportion , t-tests ANOVA procedures continuous variable . Regression analysis perform identify independent outcome predictor . Other inferential statistical analysis conduct appropriate . Informed Consent One two investigator obtain sign informed consent subject . This perform hold room prior procedure since subject pre-procedure examination perform hold room see prior day procedure .</detailed_description>
