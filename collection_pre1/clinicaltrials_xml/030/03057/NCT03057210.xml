Massage represent approximately 45 % time spent sport physiotherapist field , however , mechanisms well establish study present divergent result literature . Objectives : The objective study analyze compare effect massage apply immediately 1 hour physical exertion , functional , clinical metabolic variable . Design : A cross-over randomized clinical trial . Participants : Forty men age 18 30 year , healthy fulfil eligibility criterion . Procedures : Participants randomize five group ( n = 8 per group ) : ( GA , GB , GC , GD GE ) , perform 5 stage study randomize time , one stage per session . Stage 1 : control ; Stage 2 : Participants receive massage protocol ; Stage 3 : physical exercise protocol ; Stage 4 : Participants perform physical exercise protocol immediately , receive massage ; Stage 5 : Participants perform physical exercise protocol 1 hour end exercise receive massage . Sessions occur 1-week interval . Measurements . The primary outcome measure measure 2h start stage , secondary outcome measure measure specific time stage . The primary outcome include measure functional performance , measure secondary outcome include clinical metabolic variable .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Introduction : Post-exercise recovery technique extensively investigated order optimize restoration various body function consequently performance . Massage represent approximately 45 % time spent sport physiotherapist field , however , mechanisms well establish study present divergent result literature . Objectives : The objective study analyze magnitude effect massage functional , clinical metabolic variable . The secondary objective compare effect manual massage post-exercise recovery technique apply different time ( 1 . Immediately physical exertion ; 2 . 1 hour end intense exercise ) functional , clinical metabolic outcome physically active subject Design : A cross-over randomized clinical trial . Participants : After fulfil eligibility criterion , forty male participant participate study . The inclusion criterion include : healthy male , age 18-30 year , level physical activity within group average . The exclusion criterion include : presence anemia , inflammatory process , diabetes , cardiovascular disease , alcoholic , smoker , user illicit drug , chronic user anti-inflammatory drug occurrence muscle injury low limb and/or trunk last six month . Procedures : Participants randomize five group ( n = 8 per group ) : ( GA , GB , GC , GD GE ) , perform 5 stage study randomize time , one stage per session . Stage 1 : control ; Stage 2 : Participants receive massage protocol ; Stage 3 : physical exercise protocol ; Stage 4 : Participants perform physical exercise protocol immediately , receive massage ; Stage 5 : Participants perform physical exercise protocol 1 hour end exercise receive massage . Sessions occur 1-week interval . Intervention : The first three stage study ( E1 , E2 E3 ) perform know basal behavior study variable / two different stimulus ( massage physical exercise ) . In stage 4 5 perform analysis effect massage post-exercise recovery , comparison effect massage perform immediately exertion 1 hour exertion . The sequence performance functional test always , regardless stage study , follow order : 1st Vertical Jump Test ; 2ยบ Maximum Isometric Voluntary Measurements . The primary outcome measure measure 2h start stage , secondary outcome measure measure specific time stage . The primary measure include Strength power test , Maximal voluntary isometric contraction ( MVIC ) Squat jump . The secondary measure include subjective pain assessment , perception recovery , psychological questionnaire , belief questionnaire de analysis blood lactate concentration . Analysis : The normality data evaluate Shapiro-Wilk test . For analysis clinical , functional metabolic parameter group case normal distribution , one-way ANOVA post-test Tukey Kruskal-Wallis adopt Dunn post-test normal distribution . For analysis parameter , however , within group ( moment analysis ) use ANOVA repeat measurement Tukey post-test normal data Friedman 's test Dunn post-test non-normal data . The level significance set p &lt; 0.05 test .</detailed_description>
