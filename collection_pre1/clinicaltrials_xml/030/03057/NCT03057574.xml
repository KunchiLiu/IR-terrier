	<brief_title>Gonapure® Multifollicular Stimulation Egyptian Women Undergoing IVF/ICSI</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Gonapure® human follicle stimulate hormone ( FSH ) preparation recombinant DNA origin contain luteinizing hormone ( LH ) activity . FSH stimulate ovarian follicular growth woman primary ovarian failure . FSH , active component Gonapure® primary hormone responsible follicular recruitment development . In order affect final maturation follicle ovulation absence endogenous LH surge , human chorionic gonadotropin ( hCG ) must give follow administration FSH , monitor patient indicates sufficient follicular development occur . There inter-patient variability response FSH administration . The dosage schedule treatment female infertility must determine accord needs patient ; usual monitor response study patient 's serum oestrogen level and/or ultrasonic visualization follicle . Treatment start within first 7 day menstrual cycle . Treatment usually begin 75 450 International unit daily intramuscular injection 7 10 day ; follow individual adjustment accord patient 's follicular response i.e . adequate , excessive , response achieve . The investigator decide start dose accord standard clinical practice ( within approve label ) . Treatment stop follow 1 2 day single dose human chorionic Gonadotropin 10000 International unit induce oocyte maturation .</detailed_description>
