	<brief_title>The Addition Pembrolizumab Postoperative Radiotherapy Cutaneous Squamous Cell Cancer Head Neck</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Primary Objective : To assess safety estimate 1-year PFS postoperative radiation therapy ( RT ) + concurrent adjuvant Pembrolizumab high risk resect cutaneous squamous cell cancer head neck ( cSCC-HN ) . Secondary Objectives 1 . To evaluate relationship baseline program death-ligand 1 ( PD-L1 ) expression tumor tumor-infiltrating lymphocyte ( TILs ) preliminary efficacy . 2 . To phenotype tumor infiltrate lymphocyte peripheral blood lymphocyte ( PBLs ) , investigate tumor suppressor population include Tregs , myeloid-derived suppressor cell ( MDSCs ) cluster differentiation 8 ( CD8 ) suppressor cell assess ex vivo effector function cytokine production cytotoxicity assay well suppressor function assay autologous PBLs . 3 . For participant tumor tissue available , evaluate tumor microenvironment ( TME ) , immune marker invasive margin tumor , include CD8 , PD-1 , PD-L1 , T-cell immunoglobulin mucin-domain containing-3 ( TIM-3 ) , galectin-9 high-mobility group protein 1 ( HMGB-1 ) , B- T- lymphocyte attenuator ( BTLA ) herpes virus entry mediator ( HVEM ) , well lymphocyte-activation gene 3 ( Lag-3 ) , cytotoxic T-lymphocyte-associated protein 4 ( CTLA-4 ) others . 4 . If sufficient tumor available , also evaluate genomic and/or transcriptomic profile subset tumor use RNA-seq /Whole Transcriptome Shotgun Sequencing . Trial Design : This phase II trial evaluate addition concurrent adjuvant fixed-dose pembrolizumab combination standard intensity-modulated radiation therapy ( IMRT ) , order establish safety estimate efficacy regimen test subsequent randomize registration trial . Thirty seven patient enrol .</detailed_description>
