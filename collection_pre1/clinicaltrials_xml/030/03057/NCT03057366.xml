	<detailed_description>The drug test study call Pevonedistat . Pevonedistat test treat people advance solid tumor . The study enroll approximately 4 6 pharmacokinetics ( PK ) -evaluable participant part A . After completion mass balance absorption , distribution , metabolism , excretion ( ADME ) assessment Part A study , eligible participant opportunity continue Part B secondary study site , would begin approximately 2 week completion Part A . - Part A : Pevonedistat 25 mg/m^2 - Part B ( optional ) : Pevonedistat combination chemotherapy regimen ( Pevonedistat 25 mg/m^2 + docetaxel 75 mg/m^2 pevonedistat 20 mg/m^2 + carboplatin 20 mg/m^2 + paclitaxel 175 mg/m^2 ) All participant receive study drug via intravenous route . This multi-center trial conduct Hungary . Participants remain confined study site 9 14 day Part A . Participation Part B optional , participant re-evaluated inclusion/exclusion criterion administrate treatment . Participants undergo treatment Part B maximum 12 cycle ( 21 day cycle ) include approximately 36 week Part A B combine . Participants attend end study visit 30 day last dose study drug Part A B .</detailed_description>
