	<brief_title>Pyrimethamine Intermediate/High-risk Myelodysplastic Syndromes ( MDS ) That Has Relapsed Refractory Azanucleosides</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The objective study determine safety , dose tolerance , pharmacokinetics pharmacodynamics pyrimethamine intermediate / high-risk / relapse azanucleoside-refractory MDS within confines phase I study . Pyrimethamine self-administered participant orally per day morning food . Phase 1 study start dose 50 mg per day . ( NOTE : For participant dose level 50mg , dose reduction , need 25 mg. ) Intra-patient dose escalation permit ( beyond high dose allow ) Complete Remission/Response ( CR ) reach week 1 Cycle 3 significant toxicity . ( NOTE : In study , term `` intra-patient '' indicate within participant different participant ; i.e. , dose escalation do within individual participant . ) The decision escalate intra-patient dos base safety dose tolerance assessment make end one treatment cycle ( 28 day continuous drug administration ) 6 participant . Dose-limiting toxicity ( DLT ) define occurrence two consecutive grade 2 3 serious adverse event ( SAEs ) recover within 24 hour give dose . MTD define dose DLT observe among three consecutive participant , one DLT among six participant . Participants treat initially one 28-day cycle follow toxicity evaluation - Toxicity adverse effect assessment make Day 1 Day 28 every cycle therapy .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Participants age 18 year ( ≥ 18 year ) Diagnosis MDS confirm within 6 month , review patient chart , prior study entry accord WHO ( World Health Organization ) criterion FAB ( FrenchAmericanBritish ) classification MDS classify intermediate1 , intermediate2 high risk per IPSSR ( International Prognostic Scoring SystemRevised ) score confirm diagnosis MDS cytogenetic abnormality diagnosis bone marrow blast percentage 10 30 % ( patient cytogenetic failure dry tap ) Potential participant must meet ONE follow : Progression ( accord 2006 IWG criterion ; see Appendix C ) time initiation azacitidine decitabine treatment past 3 year ; OR Failure achieve complete partial response hematological improvement ( accord 2006 IWG ) least four cycle azacitidine decitabine administer past 3 year OR Relapse initial complete partial response hematological improvement accord 2006 IWG criterion observe least four cycle azacitidine decitabine administer past 3 year OR Intolerance azacitidine decitabine define drugrelated ≥Grade 3 liver renal toxicity lead treatment discontinuation past 3 year Off treatment MDS least 3 week . Filgrastim ( GCSF ) erythropoietin allow study clinically indicate Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group ( ECOG ) performance status 0 , 1 2 Willing adhere prohibition restriction specify protocol Patient ( patient 's legally authorize representative ) must sign informed consent document indicate patient understands purpose procedure require study willing participate study Adequate organ marrow function define : total bilirubin within normal institutional limit AST ( SGOT ) ALT ( SPGT ) ≤ 2.5 X institutional upper limit normal creatinine ≤ 1.5 X institutional upper limit normal At least one cytopenia ( ANC ≤ 1800/µL platelet count ≤ 100,000/µL hemoglobin [ Hgb ] ≤10 g/dL ) Women childbearing potential men partner childbearing potential must agree use adequate contraception ( hormonal barrier method birth control ; abstinence ) prior study entry , duration study participation , 90 day follow completion therapy . If woman become pregnant suspect pregnant participating study , inform treat physician immediately . A woman childbearing potential female ( regardless sexual orientation , undergone tubal ligation , remain celibate choice ) meet follow criterion : Has undergone hysterectomy bilateral oophorectomy ; Has naturally postmenopausal least 12 consecutive month ( i.e. , menses time precede 12 consecutive month ) Male Female patient meet follow exclusion criterion baseline exclude study participation : Current anticipate use investigational agent Participants chemotherapy radiotherapy within 3 week prior enter study recover clinically significant adverse event due agent administer 3 week earlier . The Principal Investigator treat investigator determine abnormal laboratory value toxicity due prior agent administer vs. disease clinically significant . History allergic reaction sensitivity pyrimethamine Patients history folic acid deficiency , currently folic acid replacement therapy previous history megaloblastic anemia think related folic acid deficiency Current use anticipate need treatment medication substances inhibitor inducer CYP2C9 . Uncontrolled intercurrent illness include , limited , ongoing active infection , symptomatic congestive heart failure , unstable angina pectoris , cardiac arrhythmia , psychiatric illness/social situation would limit compliance study requirement Pregnant nursing . Pregnant woman exclude study pyrimethamine class C agent potential teratogenic abortifacient effect . As pyrimethamine also secrete breast milk , lactate woman also exclude study . Because unknown potential risk adverse event nurse infant secondary treatment mother pyrimethamine , breastfeed discontinue mother treated pyrimethamine . These potential risk may also apply agent use study . There potential congenital abnormality regimen harm nursing infant</criteria>
