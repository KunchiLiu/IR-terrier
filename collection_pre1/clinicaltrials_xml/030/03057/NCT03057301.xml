	<brief_summary>Worldwide , glaucoma common cause irreversible blindness . The major risk factor raise pressure within eye ( intraocular pressure , IOP ) . IOP typically measure use Goldman applanation tonometry ( GAT ) . This involve instill anaesthetic eye drop use probe contact cornea obtain pressure measurement . A major disadvantage GAT limit number pressure measurement obtain , whereas IOP know vary throughout day ¾ people high night . The result clinicians poor understanding patient 's 24 hour IOPs effect might glaucoma . This serious limitation treatment glaucoma depend lower IOP . Recently new device become available , design specifically home IOP monitoring . The iCare HOME tonometer CE mark commercial device ( http : //www.icaretonometer.com/products/icare-home-tonometer/ ) use gain insight 24-hour IOP fluctuation . We wish determine feasibility home IOP monitoring use device . The iCare HOME tonometer depend patient perform self-tonometry . Testing one 's IOP may technically difficult likely large number patient struggle .</brief_summary>
