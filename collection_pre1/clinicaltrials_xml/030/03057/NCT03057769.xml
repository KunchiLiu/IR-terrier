	<brief_summary>Acute pancreatitis common fear complication ERCP , occur 1 % 30 % procedure . It account substantial morbidity represent substantial cost health-care system . European Society Gastrointestinal Endoscopy Japanese Society Hepato-Biliary-Pancreatic surgery guideline recently large-scale RCT recommend routine use NSAIDs indomethacin rectally ERCP . Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug ( NSAIDs ) show inhibit prostaglandin synthesis , phospholipase A2 activity , neutrophil/endothelial cell attachment , believe play key role pathogenesis acute pancreatitis . Other possible mechanism suggest occurrence pancreatitis . Papillary edema cause manipulation cannulation endoscopic treatment receive attention . The papillary edema may cause temporary outflow obstruction pancreatic juice , increase ductal pressure , result occurrence pancreatitis . Topical application epinephrine papilla may reduce papillary edema decrease capillary permeability relax sphincter Oddi . A meta-analysis ( include 2 exist RCTs post-hoc analysis previous study ) papillary epinephrine spraying compare saline spray intervention indicate potential relative risk reduction PEP ( RR 0.34 , 95 % CI 0.19-0.61 ) . Papillary epinephrine spraying may inexpensive convenient alternative prevention post-ERCP pancreatitis . A large pragmatic RCT determine whether routine use papillary epinephrine spray reduce post-ERCP pancreatitis need .</brief_summary>
