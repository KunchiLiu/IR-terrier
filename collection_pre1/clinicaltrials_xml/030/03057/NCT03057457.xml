The First Indication Use : An NGAL test result assay cutoff aid risk assessment development stage II III acute kidney injury ( AKI ) within 1 day patient assessment patient intensive care unit ( ICU ) hypotensive ( MAP &lt; 70 mmHg ) and/or receive vasopressor support . Second Indication Use : In patent stage II III AKI , NGAL measurement aid risk assessment development persistent ( ≥2 day ) stage 2 3 AKI . The Primary Objective clinical trial validate NGAL test use cutoff 140 ng/ml show clinical performance predict development moderate severe acute kidney injury within 1 day . The Secondary Objective validate NGAL test show clinical performance predict persistent moderate severe acute kidney injury contiguous 2 day interval . It anticipate 20 Clinical Sites US participate trial . The study sit recruit consecutive patient meet inclusion exclusion criterion admit hospital ICU critical care set . Patients receive clinical standard care include standard laboratory test request subject 's physician .</brief_summary>
