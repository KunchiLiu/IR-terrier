	<brief_summary>Atopic dermatitis ( AD ) constitute significant burden patient , family , healthcare system . About 60 % patient AD adult . Patients moderate-to-severe AD sufficiently control topical treatment alone require intermittent continuous treatment systemic immunomodulating agent UV-therapy . Systematic review indicate although 12 different intervention moderate-to-severe AD study clinical trial , strong recommendation possible short-term use cyclosporin A ( CSA ) . Methodological limitation majority trial choice non-validated outcome outcomes relevant patient prevent evidence-based clinical decision making . Pharmaceutical treatment patient suffer AD diverse frequently line current guideline ( example S2-guideline Germany ) . Systemic anti-inflammatory immune-modulatory therapy include several conventional immunosuppressive agent glucocorticosteroids , CSA , methotrexate ( MTX ) , azathioprine ( AZA ) , interferon-gamma ( IFN-γ ) , intravenous immunoglobulin ( IVIG ) , mycophenolate mofetil ( MMF ) mycophenolate acid . Dupilumab first biologic treatment AD promising result clinical trial . Other biologic treatment currently develop treatment moderate-to-severe AD . Large head-to-head trial miss long-term effectiveness systemic intervention moderate-to-severe AD speculative . In situation , clinical registry provide valuable information evidence-based clinical decision making . Objectives : Establishment national evidence-based clinical registry research network follow objective : 1 . Characterization medical care pharmaceutical therapy adult suffer moderate-to-severe AD . The perspective patient ( utility , treatment goal , quality life , treatment satisfaction ) , sequence treatment , change treatment primary focus . 2 . Investigation comparative effectiveness , tolerability safety systemic therapy moderate-to-severe AD . 3 . Development platform investigation , pragmatic clinical trial , epidemiologic study , outcome research , immunologic molecular research ( give approval responsible ethic commission ) .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Study procedure : No study relate intervention perform . Included patient prospectively follow least 24 month . A maximum duration follow-up intend . During observation period standardize study visit perform prospectively document patient characteristic , clinical data , patient-reported outcome , physician 's reason treatment decision , satisfaction treatment . The first study visit schedule patient inclusion ( baseline-visit ; V1 ) . The second third study visit schedule 3 6 month baseline , respectively . ( V2 3 month , V3 6 month ) . Thereafter , study visit schedule 3 month ( new systemic treatment initiate ) 6 month ( case new systemic treatment prescribe ) . Data assessment : Prospective electronic documentation disease course severity , medical care pharmaceutical treatment AD . Pseudomized data store registry center ( Center Evidence-based Healthcare , Dresden ) . Study assessment include : 1 . A short physician report form document patient history clinical parameter objective severity clinical sign , affect body region , physician 's global assessment disease severity , course disease medical treatment AD include adverse event . 2 . A patient report form ass important subjective parameter , patient report outcomes symptom , quality life , treatment satisfaction , patient 's assessment global disease severity , totally/partial well-controlled week .</detailed_description>
