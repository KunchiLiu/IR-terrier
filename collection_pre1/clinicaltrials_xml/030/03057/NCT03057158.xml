	<brief_summary>Millions woman suffer overactive bladder , change bladder function affect quality life . The study team believe need well understand woman get overactive bladder first place well treatment eventually offer . The purpose study determine woman insulin resistance likely get overactive bladder . Overactive bladder type bladder control problem cause woman bladder leakage . This problem common woman diabetes pre-diabetes , n't know .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The methylation cytosine CpG sit profound effect ability gene transcribe . To clarify distinguish specific methylation change responsible overactive bladder ( OAB ) insulin resistance ( IR ) , investigator compare three well-characterized group woman : 1 ) OAB IR ; 2 ) IR ( OAB ) ; 3 ) OAB ( IR ) . In proposal investigator study woman since likely affect OAB incontinence , investigator want study pure cohorts patient , clinical population care primary investigator . The plan future investigation apply finding broad group well understand gender racial difference . In Specific Aim 1 , investigator conduct epigenome-wide association study ( EWAS ) study , follow target validation study determine whether CpG sit throughout genome differentially methylated well-characterized matched cohort , control effect insulin-resistance . In Specific Aim 2 , investigator assess differential expression candidate locus relation methylation . RNA-sequencing ( RNA-seq ) use establish difference transcriptome extreme phenotype OAB+IR OAB alone . The investigator use quantitative polymerase chain reaction ( qPCR ) validate expression difference cohort , confirm difference candidate locus confirm experiment Aim 1 . The investigator proceed bioinformatic pathway analysis identify function interdependence gene alter expression alter methylation profile . In Specific Aim 3 , investigator determine whether expression ( mRNA protein ) difference void urine cell also exhibit biopsied bladder mucosa . The investigator use target assay confirm similar methylation profile gene expression void cell bladder biopsy . The investigator also compare protein expression candidate locus EXOC6 , ZFC3H1 , RPS6KA2 , SPON2 proteins , confirm Aims , cohort . When proposed study complete , expectation investigator functionally characterize methylation change investigator preliminarily identify IR associate OAB .</detailed_description>
