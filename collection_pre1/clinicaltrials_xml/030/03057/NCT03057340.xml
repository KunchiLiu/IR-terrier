	<detailed_description>Malignant tumor become leading cause death human , number one killer malignant tumor lung cancer . Intensifying environmental pollution come rise incidence lung cancer high mortality , 's bad 5-year survival rate 15 % , account first place malignant tumor , Exploiting novel antitumor technology product come arrest grow attention government business uneffectively curb tumor threat people 's life health conventional three treatment ( surgery , radiotherapy chemotherapy ) . Biological immunotherapy vote one ten big breakthrough 2013 Science magazine , consider new development direction cancer treatment 21st century . The exist immune treatment mainly include : adoptive immune therapy , tumor vaccine therapy , immune checkpoint-antibody therapy auxiliary therapy , adoptive immunotherapy research developeded former addition mature treatment among therapy . The adoptive immunotherapy carry many unit primarily autologous DC - CIK immunotherapy , call Dendritic cell ( Dendritic cell , DC ) Cytokine Induced Killer cell ( Cytokine Induced Killer , CIK ) immunotherapy . The principle technology : separating monocyte lymphocytes human peripheral blood , ugmentated activate variety cytokine vitro ( e.g. , IFN - gamma , IL - 1 , IL - 2 , anti - CD3 mAb ) mix lymphocyte antigen present broad-spectrum function kill tumor cell . The amplify activate DC-CIK intravenous back patient , release active substance CIK cell perforin , grain enzyme B tumor cell combine tumor cell body , dissolve tumor cells.Meanwhile secrete variety cytokine , IL - 2 , IFN - gamma TNF alpha , improve body 's immune function , give role anti-tumor function . Existing literature report previous study biological treatment center show good safety , small side effect good tolerance vast majority patient . In curative effect , current report reveals DC-CIK technology good curative effect maidly leukemia , lymphoma , ovarian cancer , stomach cancer , etc. , except lung cancer.It could complex lung cancer tumor antigen , weak tumor specific T cell response . How improve effectiveness present lung cancer antigen stimulate strong tumor specific T cell response need address improve curative effect lung cancer immunotherapy . In recent year checkpoint point antibody therapy breakthrough tumor immunotherapy , include CTLA-4 , PD - 1 PD - L1 . number clinical study reveal therapy PD - 1 PD - L1 antibody advance NSCLC , especially lung squamous carcinoma good treatment effect , disease objective response rate achieve 10-23 % . Autologous DC/CIK therapy widely carry domestic , good security prove many clinical practice.As lack effective tumor antigen , large randomize , double-blind study confirm function extend patient survival prevent tumor progression far . Some hospital adopt tumor cell lysis solution single molecule protein peptide/DC united CIK technology , mean load tumor cell lysis single molecule protein peptide tumor antigen DC unite vitro induce CIK time.When compare CIK therapy alone , unit therapy non-specificly damage tumor , also induce body produce tumor-specific immune response.However tumor antigen contain tumor cell lysis longevity protein effectively intaken DC , lead limited effective antigen present DC T lymphocyte . In addition , tumor antigen longevity protein exist long time natural growth tumor cell , recognize patient organization , therefore immune tolerance inhibites immune response affect effect kill tumor . Single molecule protein polypeptide induce specific immune response single tumor antigen , mutatd tumor antigen , result escape tumor . We need develop new cell treatment autologous DC/CIK therapy produce effective immune response , provide new aiternative candidate unite checkpoint antibody therapy future . Recently , Dr Hu Hong - Ming 's team put forward innovative cancer treatment strategy : use autophagy role capture tumor antigen preparation tumor vaccine . In strategy , block proteasome activity vitro culture tumor cell deal Bortezomib ( proteasome inhibitor ) cause enrichment short-lived protein ( SLiPs ) misfolded protein ( DRiPs ) autophagosome , call DRibbles corpuscle . Tumor vaccine maded collect DRibbles corpuscle preparation , also know DRibble vaccine.Our early study suggest DRibble tumor vaccine powerful tumor cell vaccine , whole tumor cell vaccine contain easily degradated short-lived protein cross present DC efficiently . These short-lived protein avoid degradated proteasome DRibble vaccine , package autophagosome vesicle double membrane structure . These vesicle contain endogenous risk signal molecule ( HSP90 , HMGB1 , etc . ) , effectively trigger congenital immune response . Therefore , co-culture DRibble vaccine , DC effectively intake DRibble vaccine present tumor relate antigen DC surface , combine MHC molecule activate T cell , result immune response . Compared whole lung cancer vaccine , DRibble lung cancer vaccine provide wide range tumor associate antigen , make body long keep tolerance lack cross present , cause strong immune response . Dr Hu Hong Ming 's team also find allogeneic Dribble induce equally effective immune response compare autologous tumor cell DRibble vaccine tumor regression , result confirm multiple tumor model . Due lack classic MHC molecule , DRibble vaccine protein rapidly degradated DC , allogeneic DRibble vaccine would induce adverse effect due induction allograft immune response , remainder 's safety efficacy . DRibble surface large number target molecular ligand DC , directely combine xDC cell high expression CLEC9A surface . xDC cell efficiently cross presente antigen DC , thus improve efficiency present DRibble antigen . Besides , immune response induce DRibble immune memory identify wide variety tumor specific antigen , amplificate palying tumor cell regeneration prevent tumor escape stimulate again.By Providence cancer center United States nearly 10 year research , safety DRibble fully validate Ⅰ/Ⅱ clinical trial . Based research foundation , project intend carry follow research : 1 . The curative effect influence overall survival late-stage NSCLC patient receivie new DRibble vaccine , compare exist DC/CIK therapy efficacy , 2 . Further study mechanism Dribble vaccine therapy effect human lung cancer cell , system analysis evaluate clinical curative effect promotion value . Research object : study intend include ⅢA/ⅢB/Ⅳ period non-small cell lung cancer without radical prostatectomy ( 60 % total number ) , patient receive 2-6 course chemotherapy , accept accept radiation therapy disease control stage . Selected patient randomly divide new immunotherapy conventional DC/CIK treatment group . Therapeutic schedule : This trial allogeneic DRibble vaccine unite DC/CIK DC/CIK alone Treatment Stage IIIA B NSCLC . Two arm study . 30 patient randomized arm 1 2 . Arm1 : DRibble vaccine DC/CIK ( The experimental group ) Arm2 : DC/CIK ( The control group ) Methods procedures 1 . Hospital ethic committee approval . 2 . Recruting appropriate patient accord inclusion criterion exclusion criterion . 3 . Sign patient inform consent 4 . The preparation DRibble lung cancer vaccines 5 . Blood sample collection : collecte 10ml patient peripheral blood , separate PBMC treatment reference specimen . 6 . Day 1 : DRibble group guide ultrasound patient inguinal lymph node vaccine inject DRibble , control group injection 7 . Day8 : collecte 50 ml peripheral blood separate monocyte lymphocytes 8 . Intensify immune cell amplification ( biological treatment center ) : use CD3 antibody activation , IL - 2 promotes lymphocytes proliferation kill cell ; GM-CSF induce mononuclear cell differentiation DC , joint immune treatment group DRibble vaccine co-culture DC cell 24h Dribble unit DC/CIK group . 9 . Identification immune cell ( clinical laboratory , biological treatment center ) : counting cell number , cell activity , surface marker . 10 . Detection Immune cell microbial ( clinical laboratory , biological treatment center ) : bacteria , mycoplasma endotoxin . 11 . 20-22 day : immune cell back patient : physiological saline wash cell , venous return suspension , within period treatment several time . 12 . 55 day : collecte 10 ml peripheral blood , separation PBMC vitro induce DC , cocultivate DRibble subcutaneous injection 60th day . 13 .
