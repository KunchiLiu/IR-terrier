	<brief_title>Lactobacillus Plantarum Preventing Acute Graft Versus Host Disease Children Undergoing Donor Stem Cell Transplant</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To determine efficacy orally-administered Lactobacillus plantarum ( LBP ) prevent development gastrointestinal ( GI ) acute graft versus host disease ( aGvHD ) child adolescent undergo initial allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation ( alloHCT ) . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . To determine whether orally-administered LBP decrease incidence grade II-IV aGvHD follow alloHCT . II . To determine whether LBP administration maintain intestinal integrity measure mean plasma citrulline level reduction mucosal barrier injury ( MBI ) bacteremia . III . To measure effect LBP intestinal flora phylogenetic composition alloHCT use 16S ribosomal ribonucleic acid ( rRNA ) gene deep sequencing . IV . To measure effect LBP intestinal flora function alloHCT use metagenomic metabolite profiling . V. To measure propose immunomodulatory effect LBP mean plasma level alloreactive-induced inflammatory cytokine ( IL-2 , IL-6 , IL-12p70 , IFNgamma , TNFalpha , etc ) patient receive LBP compare placebo . VI . To determine whether LBP administration reduces hospital day within first 100 day post hematopoietic cell transplant ( HCT ) . VII . To determine whether LBP administration reduces incidence Clostridium difficile-associated diarrhea alternative donor HCT patient . VIII . To define safety orally administer LBP strain 299 299v alternative donor HCT patient measure incidence Lactobacillus plantarum bacteremia . OUTLINE : Patients randomize 1 2 arm . ARM I : Patients receive Lactobacillus plantarum strain 299 299v orally ( PO ) nasogastric ( NG ) gastronomy ( G ) tube daily ( QD ) day 1 transplant condition regimen 56 day post alloHCT . Patients undergo alloHCT day 0 . ARM II : Patients receive placebo PO NG G tube QD day 1 transplant condition regimen 56 day post alloHCT . Patients undergo alloHCT day 0 . After completion study treatment , patient follow 120 day .</detailed_description>
