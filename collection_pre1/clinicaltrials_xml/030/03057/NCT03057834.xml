	<detailed_description>Investigators plan prospective cohort study adaptive design base physical function status . The design involve track number woman recruit physical function impairment without functional impairment . Investigators aim recruit similar number woman group . If find unequal number , adapt recruit strategy base woman 's functional status . Investigators compare change outcome measure within group 6 12 week pelvic floor muscle exercise ( PFME ) . The change pelvic floor strength/efficiency assess repeat pelvic floor PERFECT assessment compare group . Changes UI symptom , symptom severity , impact UI symptom quality life determine use standardized measure describe . Data analysis define association change PERFECT measure change UI episode ( base 3-day void diary ) , severity , type ( base QUID-7 ) , impact quality life ( PFIQ-7 ) within group . Objective measurement lower-extremity strength inform relationship lower-extremity strength , pelvic floor strength , UI symptoms baseline 6-week visit .</detailed_description>
