	<brief_summary>To study equivalence Monica Novii™ Patch System patient admit threatened pre-term labor pre-term labor &amp; delivery 32 +0 week gestation determine equivalence Novii™ Patch System monitor Fetal Heart Rate ( FHR ) , Maternal Heart Rate ( MHR ) Uterine Contractions ( UC ) Doppler FHR , tocodynamometer ( TOCO ) UC photo plethysmograph MHR FDA approve predicate .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Performance Monica Novii Wireless Patch System Pre-term Labor</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The study single-center prospective pair comparison trial , determine equivalence Monica Novii Patch System FDA clear Doppler FHR , TOCO UC photo plethysmograph MHR Predicate . Patients admit threatened pre-term labor pre-term labour &amp; delivery monitor device simultaneously FHR , UC , MHR . Only data predicate device available clinical care team . The equivalence Novii data compare simultaneously obtain predicate device data . Since TOCO UC Doppler FHR prone artefact error Pre-Term Labor population , principal investigator member study team decide : 1 . One 30 minute period 'interpretable ' Doppler FHR , photo plethysmograph MHR TOCO UA admit threaten pre-term labor subject , subject experience contraction demonstrate TOCO UC trace contraction represent clinical presentation . 2 . One 30 minute period 'interpretable ' Doppler FHR , photo plethysmograph MHR TOCO UA pre-term labor &amp; delivery subject end close delivery practical . As TOCO UC contraction represent clinical presentation . The selection 30 min period base data predicate ( Novii FHR UC data available study team ) . The two 30 min period use statistical equivalence calculation . All record data make available visual review .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>She require preterm labor ( least 32 week 0 day gestation ) monitoring singleton longitudinal , breech , transverse lie pregnancy . She none exclusion criterion . The presence follow factor condition would exclude patient consideration subject : Known major fetal malformation chromosome abnormality . Multiple gestation A condition cesarean likely carry shortly . Involvement another clinical trial currently previously pregnancy , investigator 's opinion , would affect conduct study . Medical obstetric problem would preclude use abdominal electrode ( e.g. , skin eruption , history sensitivity adhesives ) . Parturient age 18 . Medical obstetric problem investigator 's opinion would make patient incapable take part study . Inability understand consent information due medical illness diminish intellectual capacity , insurmountable language barrier . Potential coercion , e.g . Prisoners .</criteria>
