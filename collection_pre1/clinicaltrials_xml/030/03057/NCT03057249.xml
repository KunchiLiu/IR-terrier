	<detailed_description>Introduction Wound heal problem surgery stressful experience patient . Wound dress change often daily basis cause considerable discomfort patient often painful . Wound heal problem lead complication like wound infection , hernia formation , wound rupture even tissue necrosis . These complication often associate prolonged hospital stay reoperations cause economic burden hospital health budget . It generally accept adequate blood perfusion wound edge require optimal wound healing . Greater understanding impact surgical procedure skin perfusion may help reduce postoperative wound heal problem . Such great clinical relevance . Aim Can postoperative wound complication involve abdominal wall explain change skin blood perfusion ? Main result literature study In surgery , knowledge vascular anatomy apply order place incision manner good approach combine minimal damage vascular anatomy . Knowledge vascular anatomy provide exact information skin perfusion alters surgery . The invasive method indocyanine green fluorescence-agiography ( ICG-FA ) use evaluate intraoperatively effect abdominoplasty skin perfusion . However , animal study flap surgery clearly show tissue perfusion dynamic process . Using dynamic infrared thermography ( DIRT ) clinical setting reveal flap perfusion dynamic process take place day postoperative phase . DIRT non-invasive technique relies measure skin surface temperature . Studies show close correlation skin temperature skin perfusion . DIRT show good alternative ICF-FA visualize skin perfusion . Purpose study The purpose study analyze impact surgical procedure skin perfusion abdominal wall order increase understand postoperative wound heal problem avoid . Study population The study population include patient undergo one follow operation ; ) abdominoplasty , b ) breast reconstruction breast cancer free flap lower abdomen c ) endovascular stenting abdominal aorta aneurysm . These surgical procedure frequently perform procedure University Hospital North Norway ( UNN ) . Based vascular anatomy abdominal wall , procedure impact skin perfusion abdominal wall . Material Methods Approval obtain regional ethical committee principle outline Declaration Helsinki follow . Study I The inclusion criterion patient schedule abdominoplasty non-smokers stop smoke least 3 month prior surgery supraumbilical abdominal scar previous surgery Study II The inclusion criterion patient schedule secondary unilateral free abdominal flap breast reconstruction non-smokers stop smoke least 3 month prior surgery abdominal scar previous surgery . Study III Patients schedule endovascular stenting abdominal aorta . DIRT perform day surgery , intraoperatively 1st , 3rd 6th postoperative day DIRT examination perform supine position study I II . For study III , protocol use , however , intraoperative DIRT examination perform . For study III , thermal image take low extremity abdominal DIRT examination see stenting cause change rewarming low extremity follow stenting . An IR camera ( FLIR ThermaCAM S65 HS FLIR Systems , FLIR Systems AB , Boston , MA ) position directly expose anterior thorax abdomen . This camera produce sequence high-definition digital IR image accuracy 0.1º C. Thermal emissivity set 0.98 accuracy camera regularly check black body traceable temperature source ( Model IR-2103/301 , Infrared Systems Development Corp. , Florida , USA ) . IR image take regular interval register rate pattern skin recovery 3 minute mild cold challenge . Images electronically store afterwards process use image analysis software ThermaCAM Researcher Pro 2.8 SR-1 ( FLIR Systems AB ) . The pre- postoperative image take dedicated laboratory ( room temperature 21-23°C ) recovery follow cold challenge acclimatization period 10 minute thoracic abdominal wall expose . The thermal challenge deliver blow air room temperature skin surface 2 minute desktop fan . The intraoperative examination perform patient general anaesthesia end surgery . The thermal cold challenge perform wash thorax abdomen evenly 1 minute gauze soak saline room temperature ( 22-23°C ) . The abdomen divide vascular zone define Huger . The mean skin temperature calculate zone postoperative phase cooling , end cool 1 , 2 3 minute recovery . A qualitative analysis change pattern rate recovery hot spot within zone make compare result zone . A one tailed test pair variable use see statistically significant mean temperature zone time point rewarming . Statistical significance define p &lt; 0.05 . Publications The result study publish international peer-reviewed journal .</detailed_description>
