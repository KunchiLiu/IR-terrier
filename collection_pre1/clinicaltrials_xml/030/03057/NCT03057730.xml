	<brief_summary>Gingival recession common defect among American population . It also major cause root decay , hypersensitivity , contribute tooth mobility low self-esteem . Acellular dermal matrix , human-derived graft material put market treatment gingival recession . Treating gingival recession material validate treatment option year . However , treatment outcomes two patient population , namely thin biotype thick biotype , investigate . This study observe primary treatment outcomes two patient group 5 time point - 3 month , 6 month 12 month post-surgery observe short term outcome ; additional 24 month 48 month post-surgery observe long term outcome .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Clinical Trial Testing Root Coverage With Acellular Dermal Matrix Thin Thick Gingival Biotypes</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The study aim evaluate compare use acellular dermal matrix , material use treat gum recession , two study population , namely thin thick gingival biotype . Short term outcome long term stability ADM recession repair thick thin biotype evaluate . There two study group , namely thin thick group . The included subject divide two group accord gingival thickness : Thin gingival biotype group ( TnB ) : &lt; 0.8 mm , thick gingival biotype group ( TkB ) ≥ 0.8 mm . Each subject one two group . Randomization use assign subject study group , intervention group , namely ADM apply beneath coronally advance flap . The short term ( 3 month , 6 month post-surgery ) outcomes long term ( 12 month , 24 month 48 month post-surgery ) outcome compare within group group .</detailed_description>
