	<brief_summary>The relative risk colorectal cancer ( CRC ) increase first-degree relative patient CRC advance adenoma . In high-risk CCR population define family history first stage CRC advance adenoma age 60 , total colonoscopy recommend screening test . In France , rate screen colonoscopy population high risk CRC insufficient , limit effectiveness target screening . The main reason low participation rate patient undergo RCC advance adenoma unaware family implication diagnosis therefore reluctant disseminate information patient Related matter . The need good perception personal risk CRC first-degree relative patient CRC advance adenoma , expect coronary adherence increase screening , require good understanding risk Clear , adapt comprehensible information relay personally case-index . The objective project develop personalized prevention screen program JRC order meet need relative sick . The mean intervention implement respond need well take account level CRC risk family-based CRC screening prevention approach adapt high-risk CRC group characterize Family history first stage CRC advance adenoma , consequently , improve information subject concern screen prevention CRC . The aim case-index education induce intervention relative promote CCR screening .
