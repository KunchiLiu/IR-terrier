	<brief_summary>The investigator study sedentary behavior ( SED ) across pregnancy young woman . We hypothesize SED increase across pregnancy high SED related bad cardiovascular health , specifically elevate blood pressure ( BP ) excessive gestational weight gain ( GWG ) . Pregnancy biologically relevant period CVD risk factor may develop worsen , contribute future CVD . Pregnant woman also spend day sedentary , define much sit distinct little exercise . SED emerge risk factor , independent moderate-to-vigorous physical activity ( e.g. , exercise ) , elevate BP , obesity , diabetes , CVD , mortality general population , recommendation SED pregnancy study evaluate SED across pregnancy . These study limit small sample size , lack repeat measure across trimester , suboptimal SED assessment methodology , failure link clinical outcome ( e.g. , BP , GWG ) . The investigator address gap prospective study measure SED 130 pregnant woman across three trimester use state-of-the-art objective activity monitor capable measure min-by-min activity intensity posture . We also measure BP GWG trimester , , link abstract prenatal clinic weight BPs , glucose screen result , gestational diabetes , preeclampsia , adverse birth outcome . Lastly , long-term goal identify woman high risk SED pregnancy design effective intervention , investigator efficiently evaluate correlate determinant SED never study pregnancy .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Objective : The investigator aim conduct prospective cohort study use state-of-the-art , noninvasive measurement sedentary behavior n=130 pregnant woman trimester first pregnancy . We link sedentary behavior gestational weight gain , blood pressure , potential determinant demographic , health condition behavior , psychosocial factor , perceptions/beliefs , environment . Specific Aims : Aim 1 : Objectively measure sedentary behavior across pregnancy trimester Aim 2 : Relate objectively-measured sedentary behavior blood pressure gestational weight gain across pregnancy Aim 3 : Characterize correlate determinant sedentary behavior pregnancy 1.3 Background : Cardiovacular disease ( CVD ) remain leading cause death woman minimal decline past 30 year among woman &lt; 55 year old . Stagnant rate CVD mortality young woman occur alongside notable decline men old adult think due , part , high rate obesity elevate blood pressure ( BP ) . Related , American Heart Association ( AHA ) recently identify primordial prevention , population-level approach target prevent rather treat CVD risk factor , necessary strategy reduce CVD burden . To achieve primordial prevention , target must populations risk develop CVD risk factor ( vs. exist risk factor ) , young woman . Pregnancy biologically unique period young woman CVD risk factor obesity high blood pressure ( BP ) develop worsen , contribute future CVD . Pregnant woman also spend time sedentary behavior ( SED ) . SED behavior occur seated/reclining position low energy expenditure recognize behavior distinct inactivity , lack moderate-vigorous physical activity ( MVPA ) . Though MVPA known benefit , SED emerge , independent risk factor obesity , CVD , mortality . Importantly , prolong bout SED ( accumulate bout last 30 min ) non-pregnant person strongly relate obesity induce unfavorable hemodynamic response , increase BP . We hypothesize much SED across pregnancy important contributor excess gestational weight gain ( GWG ) elevate BP , two important CVD risk factor young woman . Remarkably , dearth study evaluate SED across pregnancy . In cross-sectional study , pregnant woman spend 50-60 % day SED SED high 3rd trimester . Yet , study evaluate SED increase across pregnancy ( repeat measurement ) use best practice SED assessment methodology ( objective device capable capturing posture intensity ) . Moreover , study evaluate whether great SED associate increase GWG BP pregnant woman , turn know impact pregnancy health later maternal CVD risk . Current guideline advise MVPA pregnant woman recommendation SED , highlight research gap SED consequence pregnancy . Moreover , clarify role SED pregnancy important lowering SED might feasible strategy pregnant woman , low participation in9 unique barrier MVPA . Lastly , little known correlate determinant SED pregnancy . Such data critical identifying woman risk high SED pregnancy develop effective intervention . 1.4 Significance : Sedentary behavior novel risk factor weight gain , high BP , CVD , yet pattern , correlate , determinant consequence sedentary behavior poorly understood pregnant woman . Sedentary behavior common behavior pregnant woman , dearth research study apply state-of-the-art sedentary behavior assessment method repeat measure across pregnancy major research gap intend address proposal . To investigator ' knowledge , study optimal sedentary behavior measurement , assess posture intensity awake ( i.e. , activPAL ) , conduct pregnant woman . Beyond , study evaluate temporal trend sedentary time across gestation . There research examine bout extend , uninterrupted sedentary time particularly deleterious effect BP strongly relate high BMI . Lastly , correlate determinant sedentary behavior poorly understood overall , particular , among pregnant woman . Before effective intervention design reduce sedentary behavior pregnancy , nonmodifiable modifiable factor associate sedentary behavior must better understood . Thus , objective , longitudinal measurement sedentary behavior pregnancy propose application determine pattern , correlate , determinant , consequence sedentary behavior pregnancy move toward future goal 1 ) clarify risk whether sedentary behavior recommendation appropriate pregnant woman , 2 ) identify group risk high sedentary behavior , 3 ) inform intervention target . Further , research address AHA 's mission reduce burden CVD investigate novel strategy primordial prevention cardiovascular disease young woman .</detailed_description>
