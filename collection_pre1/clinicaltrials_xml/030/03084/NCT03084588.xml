	<brief_summary>Patients undergo shoulder surgery may experience moderate-to-severe pain first 2-3 day follow operative procedure . Two method use control pain early postoperative period . First , interscalene nerve block ( ISB ) place prior surgery block pain fiber supply shoulder . Although ISB provide effective analgesia several hour surgery , block associate potential transient permanent nerve injury . Furthermore , ISB wear suddenly , result abrupt onset severe pain . A second method pain control involve use opioids . Opioids provide potent pain relief follow surgical procedure . However , agent commonly use anesthesiologist surgeon produce pain relief 2-4 hour , lead fluctuation level pain control . Recent data suggest use long-acting opioid like methadone operating room , provide analgesia 24-36 hour , may improve pain control surgery . The aim clinical trial compare postoperative pain score analgesic requirement patient randomize receive either ISB methadone start shoulder arthroscopic surgery .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Shoulder surgery one common orthopedic operation , 1.4 million procedure perform worldwide . Advances surgical technology allow majority procedure perform arthroscopically . A grow number shoulder arthroscopic procedure conduct outpatient basis . Effective pain control therefore essential patient send home day operation . This management strategy present important challenge anesthesiologist , surgeon , postanesthesia care unit ( PACU ) nurse . The pain shoulder arthroscopic procedure equivalent open procedure first 24-48 hour , 30 % patient report pain severe intensity first postoperative day . Poor pain control surgery associate lower patient satisfaction score , adverse event , development chronic postsurgical pain . A variety therapeutic strategy develop effectively control early postoperative pain . However , number important limitation approach . There three general approach anesthesiologist use provide anesthesia analgesia shoulder arthroscopic surgery . Traditionally , shoulder surgery perform general anesthetic breathing tube ( oral endotracheal intubation ) . Although provide effective analgesia duration operation , patient experience pain intraoperative anesthetic worn . In set , anesthesia care provider administers opioid intravenous line patient awaken less pain . In PACU , nurse staff continue administer intravenous opioid pain effectively control . There important limitation anesthetic management strategy . Anesthesia care provider must estimate amount opioid administer intraoperatively . Since individual response opioids may vary widely , possible patient may awaken pain may difficult extubate ( remove breathe tube ) due opioid-induced respiratory depression . Once admitted PACU , patient ' pain effectively control careful titration opioids nurse staff ( pain le 3 scale 0 10 ) . However , duration effectiveness commonly-used opioids 3-4 hour . Therefore , patient may little pain time hospital discharge , may experience severe pain several hour later . Oral analgesic agent use control pain home setting . The use oral opioids result variability level pain patient experience . This variability relate slow onset time short duration effect oral agent ( result `` peaks trough '' postoperative pain ) . A second anesthetic technique involve use general anesthetic interscalene nerve block ( ISB ) . Over 40 year ago , Winnie et al . describe use single interscalene brachial plexus block provide analgesia follow shoulder surgery . This practice involve injection large volume local anesthetic agent near nerve brachial plexus . An ISB brachial plexus block regional anesthetic technique block nerve supply shoulder , arm , forearm . The block typically administer preoperative hold area general anesthetic perform . When patient awaken general anesthetic arrives PACU , nerve block provide pain relief persist several hour . The risk nausea vomit also reduce ISB block . In addition , study demonstrate patient randomized receive ISB shorter PACU hospital length stay . The advantage ISB block prompt many clinician introduce regional anesthesia technique clinical practice . Although ISB effective postoperative pain management technique , several important limitation . The block usually perform enter operating room may delay start case . In addition , needle placement block neck , improper placement may result pneumothorax ( lung collapse ) . Approximately 5 % ISBs fail , even experience hand . Block failure necessitates use opioids control pain . Temporary phrenic nerve palsy diaphragm paralysis common ISB perform . This result significant decrement pulmonary function many patient , include normal baseline respiratory muscle strength . Most importantly , clinical investigation , cadaveric study , retrospective review suggest nerve root brachial plexus may particularly susceptible nerve injury local anesthetic use nerve block . Studies demonstrate ISB associate high risk transient long-term neurologic complication compare peripheral nerve block . Furthermore , recognize ISB may result delayed onset phrenic nerve damage permanent unilateral diaphragmatic paralysis . Finally , analgesic effect ISB may resolve abruptly , result sudden perception severe pain . In light risk , expert question routine use ISBs shoulder surgery . The third strategy anesthetic postoperative pain management involve use ISB postoperative analgesic also primary anesthetic . With approach , ISB perform preoperative hold area . Once clinician assure block functioning , patient transport operating room , sedation administer , shoulder surgery perform combination sedation regional block . Advantages technique include avoidance general anesthesia ( associated complication ) , good maintenance blood flow brain . A disadvantage technique profound nerve block must present order procedure complete successfully . Careful patient selection also essential perform shoulder surgery sedate patient sit position ( anesthesiologists easy access patient ' airway ) . Finally , patient risk complication ISB list previously . When decide appropriate anesthetic patient undergo arthroscopic shoulder surgery , clinician must weigh risk benefit technique . As noted , anesthetic approach important limitation . At Evanston hospital , approximately 75 % shoulder surgery patient ISB procedure . There high utilization block Glenbrook Hospital orthopedic surgery center . The important benefit ISB provide long-lasting pain relief postoperative period . Previous study suggest analgesic effect ISB last 12 24 hour . However , clinical trial demonstrate ISB provide pain relief approximately 6 hour , pain may worse block resolve ( compare intravenous opioids ) . Recently , Abdallah et al . perform meta-analysis 23 randomized trial examine 1090 patient assess effect ISBs pain shoulder surgery ( compare give block ) . The author observe duration pain relief patient ISB group 8 hour rest 6 hour movement . There benefit beyond time . Pain actually worse 24 hour patient give ISB . These important finding suggest effect ISB last much short period time estimate clinician , may impact evaluation risk / benefit ratio ISB . As described previously , important limitation intravenous oral opioid approach pain management duration effect agent typically 3 4 hour . This result period effective pain relief , follow period moderate-to-severe pain postoperative period . An alternative strategy opioid utilization may involve administration long-acting opioid operating room would provide effective analgesia first 24 postoperative hour ( corresponds period severe pain surgery ) . At present time , intravenous methadone long-acting opioid available clinician . Methadone develop 1939 approve FDA clinical use 1947 . A primary advantage methadone long half-life , range 25-52 hour give intravenously large dos . This unique property methadone mean single daily dos often use patient moderate-to-severe acute chronic pain . A number recent investigation demonstrate methadone effective treat variety acute chronic pain condition . Although best know drug use treat narcotic addiction , methadone also use increase frequency analgesic agent operate room provide prolong postoperative analgesia . A calculated half-life 35 hour observe methadone administer intravenously surgical patient , result median duration analgesia last 26 hour . In patient undergoing abdominal , orthopedic , cardiac , gynecologic surgery , use single dose methadone ( 20 mg 0.2-0.3 mg/kg ) induction anesthesia result improved analgesia first 24 hour surgery , compare intraoperative opioids . In investigation , patient methadone group require significantly less postoperative pain medication report low pain score first postoperative day . Up 39 % patient require additional pain medication , despite undergoing major surgery associate moderate-to- severe level postoperative pain . In randomized , double-blinded investigation cardiac surgical patient complete Evanston Hospital , subject randomized methadone group report less pain , require reduce postoperative pain medication , describe increased satisfaction overall pain management compare subject administer standard opioid ( fentanyl ) . No adverse event directly attributable methadone report clinical trial . The use methadone may advantageous set shoulder arthroscopic surgery . The investigator hypothesize single dose administer start surgery may provide pain relief throughout procedure PACU recovery first 24 hour ( ) hospital discharge home . The aim clinical trial compare analgesia provide ISB pain management strategy use intravenous methadone . Pain score collect group first 72 hour surgery . The requirement pain medication also record . Overall satisfaction pain management assess , postoperative complication note .</detailed_description>
