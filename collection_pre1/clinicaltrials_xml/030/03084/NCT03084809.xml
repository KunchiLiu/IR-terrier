	<brief_title>Chemotherapy Combined With CIK Treating Colon Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Over past decade , advance combination chemotherapy regimens colorectal cancer lead significant improvement progression-free overall survival . Cytokine-induced killer cell ( CIK ) auxiliary antitumor treatment . Research demonstrate median overall survival ( OS ) patient receive CIK combine chemotherapy ( 5-Fluorouridine , leucovorin oxaliplatin [ FOLFOX4 ] plan ) significantly increase compare patient receive chemotherapy alone . Furthermore , trend toward superior progression-free survival time ( PFS ) patient receive CIK combine chemotherapy compare patient receive chemotherapy alone . The investigator aim evaluate clinical efficacy chemotherapy ( FOLFOX4 ) combine CIK treatment postoperative colorectal cancer patient . And provide useful reference clinical application CIK colorectal cancer patient .</detailed_description>
