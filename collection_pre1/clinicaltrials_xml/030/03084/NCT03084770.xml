	<brief_summary>The aim study evaluate appropriate management sporadic asymptomatic non-functioning pancreatic neuroendocrine neoplasm ( NF-PNEN ) ≤ 2 cm . P NF-PNEN management decide hospital therapeutic decision decided/coordinated treat physician . Patients either submitted surgical resection active surveillance .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>In last decade dramatic increase diagnosis small , incidentally discover , NF-PNEN observe . Various study indicate safety conservative management lesion The European Neuroendocrine Tumor Society ( ENETS ) propose `` wait see '' approach small NF-PNEN . Indications surgery include presence localize NF-PNEN absence distant metastasis curative resection tumor associate favourable prognosis especially low grade . In last decade dramatic increase diagnosis small , incidentally discover , NF-PNEN observed.Moreover , investigator observe clear relationship tumor diameter low risk malignancy systemic progression . In particular , tumor size ≤ 2 cm seem associate negligible risk disease recurrence low incidence aggressive feature lymph node involvement.On basis , European Neuroendocrine Tumor Society ( ENETS ) propose `` wait see '' approach small NF-PNEN incidentally discover . Since , various series evaluate safety conservative management small , sporadic , incidentally diagnose , NF-PNEN . After median follow-up 28-45 month , study confirm intensive surveillance incidental small NF-PNEN safe select case . Nevertheless , available data base retrospective series significant heterogeneity inclusion criterion different tumor diameter cut-off appropriate management entity ( surveillance versus surgery ) still matter debate .</detailed_description>
