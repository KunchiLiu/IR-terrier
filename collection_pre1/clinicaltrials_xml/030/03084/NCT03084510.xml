	<brief_summary>To evaluate safety effectiveness Lotus™ Valve System transcatheter aortic valve replacement ( TAVR ) symptomatic Chinese patient calcific , severe native aortic stenosis consider high risk surgical valve replacement .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>REPRISE China - Clinical Evaluation China</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>1 . A independent Clinical Events Committee ( CEC ) adjudge safety endpoint . 2 . Subject document aortic annulus size ≥20 mm ≤27 mm base center 's assessment pre-procedure diagnostic imaging ( confirmed Case Review Committee [ CRC ] ) . 3 . Monitor review source data regularly compare EDC ensure data entry accuracy , completeness , representativeness . 4 . Will recruit maximum 50 subject maximum 5 site 5 . Boston Scientific 's Standard Operating Procedures address operation analysis activity , patient recruitment , data collection , data management , data analysis , report adverse event , change management .</detailed_description>
