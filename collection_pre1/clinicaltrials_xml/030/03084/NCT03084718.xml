	<brief_title>An 8-week Dose Ranging Study CHF 718 pMDI Asthmatic Subjects</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This phase II , multicenter , randomize , double-blind , placebo active control dose range 5-arm parallel group study identify optimal dose CHF 781 pMDI respect lung function clinical efficacy safety outcome . After 2 week run-in period rescue albuterol need background inhale corticosteroid ( ICS ) , patient randomize one 5 study treatment group . After randomization , patient assess 4 8 week study treatment center . A follow-up phone call perform week last visit . During study , daily asthma symptom , peak expiratory flow , rescue background medication use , compliance study medication record via subject diary . Treatment-Emergent Adverse Events ( TEAEs ) assess record throughout study . At screen subsequent visit , patient undergo physical vital sign examination , spirometry measurement , 12-lead ECG . Routine hematology , blood chemistry , pregnancy test perform enrollment end study . 24-hr urine cortisol creatinine assess first dose last dose study treatment .</detailed_description>
