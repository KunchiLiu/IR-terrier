	<detailed_description>Dietary treatment overweight/ obese men prostate cancer well study . As men prostate cancer overweight/ obese increase risk recurrence , metastasis mortality , elucidate diet improve biomarkers prostate cancer lead long-term weight management could improve survivorship . The primary objective proposal compare plant-based , olive oil ( PBOO ) diet conventional diet weight loss improvement metabolic biomarkers ( specifically fast insulin , glucose , triglyceride ) overweight/ obese men diagnose prostate cancer surveillance asymptomatic biochemical failure primary therapy . The secondary objective determine diet acceptable long term use . Participants consume 8 week conventional diet treat prostate cancer PBOO diet weight loss improvement biomarkers random assignment diet order . They choose one diet 6 month follow-up . Blood sample body weight obtain pre- post diet 6 month follow-up compare diet . Based earlier work colleague PI , anticipate PBOO diet result well weight loss biomarkers acceptable long-term weight management . This protocol potential elucidate diet improve body weight survival men prostate cancer .</detailed_description>
