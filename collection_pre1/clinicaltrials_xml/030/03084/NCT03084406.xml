	<brief_title>Efficacy Centervention-ATOD : An Implementation Tool Dissemination Evidence-based Programs Substance Abuse</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Alcohol , tobacco , drug ( ATOD ) use among adolescent major public health problem devastate personal , familial , societal cost . Substance use youth associate increase accidental injury ( include overdoses ) , psychiatric comorbidities , suicidality , school problem , juvenile delinquency , social family problem , sexual impulsivity , health consequences.A burgeon neuroscience literature demonstrate ATOD use youth associate host negative potentially long-term sequela , include alteration brain structure , function , neurocognition . Moreover , drug use adolescence best predictor abuse adulthood ; data publish National Center Addiction Substance Abuse reveal 90 % adult meet substance dependence criterion begin use alcohol drug adolescence . In U.S. , economic impact substance abuse staggering : 2005 , federal , state , local government spend combined $ 467 billion direct indirect cost associated addiction , render substance dependence large , costliest , preventable public health problem U.S. today . Over past decade , significant progress make field ATOD research develop evidence-based practice ( EBPs ) , research demonstrate ATOD user receive research-proven treatment nearly 2.5 time likely achieve clinically significant post-treatment abstinence compare receive non-evidence-based treatment . However , despite availability , EBPs rarely adopt use everyday service setting . Further , even adopt , considerable variation exist quality EBPs implement long-term sustainability . Furthering understand efficacious treatment program successfully introduce real-world treatment setting key bridge research-to-practice gap . The pilot test Centervention-ATOD , customizable suite online tool specifically design support quality implementation sustainability ATOD-EBP within real-world service setting , evaluate whether product award additive benefit provider implementation proficiency efficacy , quality implementation delivery , EBP ( i.e. , Free Talk CHOICE ) outcomes compare traditional implementation method . Additionally , cost-effectiveness study conduct ass whether implementation support strategy ( i.e. , Centervention-ATOD ) cost-effective traditional implementation method . The pilot test employ Hybrid Type II study design [ 14 ] simultaneously test clinical evidence-based program well implementation strategy . Regardless EBP implement , 110 mental health ( MH ) provider randomly assign one two condition : ( 1 ) Enhanced implementation ( EI ) ( 2 ) Implementation Usual ( IAU ) . Providers either implement ( ) Free Talk , motivational interview group intervention 5-8 youth per group six-week period ( b ) CHOICE , motivational interview group prevention program 5-8 youth per group five-week period . Participating youth age 14-17 may experiment alcohol drug ( AOD ) participate Free Talk intervention youth age 11-15 may may use substance participate CHOICE prevention program . At conclusion pilot test , study cost-effectiveness implementation support strategy ( i.e. , Centervention-ATOD ) conduct agency administrator participate provider .</detailed_description>
