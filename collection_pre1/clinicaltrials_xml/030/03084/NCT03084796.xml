	<brief_title>A 6-week Dose Ranging Study CHF 5259 pMDI Subjects With Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This phase II , multicenter , randomize , double-blind , placebo active control dose-ranging 6-arm parallel group study identify optimal dose CHF 5259 pMDI respect lung function clinical efficacy safety outcome . After 2 week run-in period rescue albuterol background ICS need , patient randomize one 6 study treatment group . Following randomization , subject assess 3 week 6 week study treatment center . A follow-up phone call perform week last visit . During study , daily symptom , rescue background medication use compliance study drug record via subject diary . Treatment-Emergent Adverse Events ( TEAEs ) assess record throughout study . At screen subsequent visit , subject undergo physical vital sign examination , spirometry measurement , 12-lead ECG . Symptoms COPD health status assess validated questionnaire . Routine hematology , blood chemistry , pregnancy test perform enrollment end study . 24-hour digital recording ECGs ( Holter ) perform first dose last dose study treatment .</detailed_description>
