	<brief_summary>Early initiation treatment Rheumatoid arthritis ( RA ) prevent several long term problem associate condition . However , many RA patient develop lung inflammation scarring , call 'interstitial lung disease ' ( RA-ILD ) , contribute early death 1 5 people . There proven treatment patient medication RA fact worsen lung disease . There urgent need therefore find safe medication control RA joint disease , also prevent progression RA-ILD . Abatacept approve drug treat RA use widely . It new RA medication , unique mechanism action , show prevent progression joint damage improve physical function . The investigator aim assess safety medication patient RA-ILD improve understanding mechanism lung damage rheumatoid disease . The investigator perform small clinical trial ass feasibility perform large randomise control trial . A total 30 patient RA-ILD treated abatacept infusion fortnightly first month , every 4 week total 20 week . In order eligible study , patient must able provide write informed consent , age ≥18 year , moderate severe RA joint disease activity ( DAS28 ≥3.2 ) interstitial lung disease respond progressed 6 month despite conventional immunosuppression . Change lung function ( forced vital capacity ) 24 week evaluate . To assess mechanism may involve development ILD , investigator assess effect abatacept biomarkers obtain blood lung ( bronchoalveolar lavage ) , include marker infection ( lung microbiome ) .</brief_summary>
