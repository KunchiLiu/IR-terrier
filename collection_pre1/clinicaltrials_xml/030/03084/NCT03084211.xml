	<detailed_description>Introduction : The emergency department ( ED ) first point health care contact head injure patient . The majority ( estimate 85 % ) patient suffer head injury intra-cranial damage require neurosurgical consultation , may symptoms mil traumatic brain injury ( MTBI ) . Patients MTBI may physical , emotional , behavioral , cognitive symptom headache , sleep disturbance , disorder balance , fatigue , irritability , memory concentration problem , majority self-limited symptom abate within 7 10 day . Although early spontaneous resolution occur patient , small proportion adult MTBI protract course . It estimate 15-30 % patient MTBI develop post-concussion syndrome ( PCS ) , persistence head injury symptom MTBI.3 PCS usually last 2-4 month , symptom typically peak 4-6 week follow injury4 . However , small percentage patient , symptom PCS last year longer . Approximately 20 % adult PCS return full-time work 1 year initial injury , disable permanently PCS . Current guideline recommend period ` cognitive rest ' stepwise return usual activity follow MTBI . Cognitive rest define avoidance mental activity may trigger symptom , watch television , use computer , exercise , talk phone . Patients follow ` return usual activity ' instruction encourage resume normal activity symptom resolve , symptom return upon recommencement activity , return rest . However , recent systematic review early educational intervention ED MTBI conclude clear consistent intervention standard management practice exist population . Additionally , previous research evaluate period strict bed rest , include physical cognitive rest , also show decrease severity duration MTBI symptom . Based best available evidence , current guideline management MTBI suggest complete bed rest avoid first 48 hour post-injury . Regular exercise show positive effect well-being , include mental health , improve self esteem , sleep memory . Recent study include patient PCS report exercise treatment program improve exercise tolerance decrease symptom , even patient exercise previously exacerbate PCS symptom . Additionally , Wise et al. , randomize patient severe TBI either structured exercise program 10 week usual care find patient exercise group less depress report well health status compare include exercise program . Rationale : Given paucity effective management strategy prevent PCS follow MTBI emerge evidence benefit exercise MTBI patient , urgent need research effectiveness early exercise intervention acute MTBI patient population prevention PCS . Research Question : Among adult ( 18-64 year ) patient present ED discharge diagnosis acute MTBI ( define Zurich consensus statement ) , prescribe light exercise ( ie : 30 min daily walk ) reduce proportion patient PCS 30 day , compare standard discharge instruction ? Methods : Study Design Population This randomize controlled trial conduct ED academic tertiary care hospital ( annual census 60,000 ) . Consecutive , adult ( 18-64 year ) patient present ED MTBI sustain within precede 48 hour eligible enrollment . Acute MTBI define Zurich consensus statement direct blow head , face , neck elsewhere body force transmit head may may involve loss consciousness AND result brain injury 1 symptom 1 follow clinical domain : somatic , cognitive , emotional behavioral , sleep . Triage nurse screen potential patient eligibility confirm attend physician , inform write consent obtain train research personnel ( available ) attend physician nurse . The study protocol approve local institutional Research Ethics Board register clinicaltrials.gov . Trained research personnel collect demographic clinical parameter ( history , physical examination finding , diagnostic testing , ED management ) paper electronic chart use standardize data collection tool . The research assistant ask patient complete inventory symptom establish baseline use Rivermead Post-Concussion Symptoms Questionnaire ( RPQ ) , validate , 16 item questionnaire provide instruction patient regard wearable step counter . Interventions After provide informed write consent , patient randomize either discharge instruction prescribe 30 minute light exercise ( ie : walking ) daily ( intervention ) discharge instruction describe graduate return usual activity cognitive rest ( control ) use fix 1:1 allocation ratio produce computer-based random number generator . Block size four used ensure equal allocation group . To avoid potential patient selection allocation bias , physician , nurse , RAs patient blind randomization schedule . Sealed , sequentially number , opaque envelope contain pre-assigned group allocation . By necessity , physician administer instruction patient aware allocation . However , outcome assessor blind group assignment . Prior receive discharge instruction , patient complete RPQ questionnaire . Patients contact via telephone 2 , 4 6 week follow index ED visit repeat RPQ questionnaire determine subsequent MTBI-related physician visit many day work school miss due MTBI symptom . If telephone contact successful first day schedule follow-up , participant send text message remind schedule telephone interview . If contact make within timeframe , patient consider lose follow-up data exclude analysis . Discharge instruction read attend physician ED nurse . Patients provide printed copy discharge instruction . All patient receive instruction include description common symptom follow MTBI warn sign miss intracranial injury vomiting , stupor , focal weakness , seizure severe headache . The control group discharge instruction adapt Centers Disease Control Prevention Acute Concussion Evaluation Care Plan ( work version ) healthcare provider . These MTBI discharge instruction describe graduate return usual activity plan base head injury symptom emphasize cognitive rest . The intervention group receive discharge instruction prescribe 30 minute light exercise ( ie : walking ) control group instruct gradually return activity . Outcome Measures The primary outcome study proportion patient PCS 30 day , defined increase baseline ≥ 3 symptom validate RPQ 1 month . Secondary outcome include change RPQ baseline 72 hour , 7 day , 14 day , 30 day post initial ED visit , number miss day school work repeat visit healthcare provider . To assess compliance ED discharge instruction , patient ask complete daily activity journal give step counter . Data Analyses Data enter directly study specific Microsoft Excel database ( Microsoft Corporation , Redmond , Washington ) . Descriptive statistic summarize use mean standard deviation ( SD ) , median interquartile range ( IQR ) frequencies 95 % confidence interval ( CIs ) appropriate . Differences RPQ 72 hour , 7 day , 14 day , 30 day post ED visit intervention control group compare use paired sample t-tests . Other outcome include included change number miss day school work , repeat visit healthcare provider , quality life indicator compare group use descriptive statistic 95 % confidence interval appropriate . Analyses conduct accord intention-to-treat principle . Additionally , track device ' measurement compare patient ' report symptom report daily activity . All statistical analysis conduct use SAS ( v.9.4 , SAS institute , Inc. , Cary , NC , USA ) .</detailed_description>
