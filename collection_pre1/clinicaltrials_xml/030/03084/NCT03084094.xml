	<brief_summary>One big challenge face researcher act rehabilitation science capacity dispose integrative approach utilization clinical practice . The border profile physiotherapy researcher front apply research amplification experimental integrative approach , involve study behavioral physiological variable . The rehabilitation process transcend system physiology encompass cognitive behavioral feature adapt environment surround u . It known scientific rehabilitation community necessity evidence base therapy even , therapeutic innovation . In condition , health illness , various option use integrative approach today available physiotherapy , include behavioral physiological profile individual physical activity , response stress field chronic pain . It clinical routine numerous rehabilitation center treatment diseases cause pain , leading figure physiotherapist work process . The innovative study resource alter pain state patient become primordial routine clinical use , low cost easy apply . The therapeutic treatment pain offer physiotherapist need new investigative option base evidence association neuronal , behavioral physiological response brain central organ regulation . In context , become increasingly necessary construction investigative approach purpose reach clinical practice , reduce time lapse , great volume information produce globally impact short medium term new therapeutic recommendation . Among various chronic painful entity , present fibromyalgia ( FM ) , painful diabetic polyneuropathy primary dysmenorrhea painful pathogenic complexity limit therapeutic pain rehabilitation process . The 3 painful entity present central nervous system main participant neurogenesis maintenance painful state . It primordial importance rehabilitation science improve method non invasive brain neuromodulation allow , excitation inhibition specific cortical area order produce pain inhibition , provide simple low cost treatment clinical routine . Technological advance non invasive technique modulate brain function develop , among transcranial direct current stimulation ( tDCS ) stand . Basically , electrodes place targeted brain region want stimulate inhibit . Posteriorly , apply continuous electric current ( 0,4 - 2 mA ) 3-20 minute period , order modify cortical excitability . The stimulus anodic current increase cortical excitability whereas stimulus cathodic current inhibitory effect . Few research group address issue fibromyalgia , painful diabetic polyneuropathy primary dysmenorrhea application tDCS research focus , border area rehabilitation science great potential clinical use . Preliminary study associate use tDCS decrease painful state , however approach physical function behavioral result need great investigation . The purpose present project present tDCS new modality physical rehabilitation patient chronic pain 3 entity mention . The study proposal present behavioral , social physical result tDCS application patient , suggest good quality life functionality individual .</brief_summary>
