	<brief_title>A Study Assess Safety Immunogenicity Candidate Malaria Vaccine Using Novel Routes Administration</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Group1 consist 3 volunteer receive i.v . ChAd63 ME-TRAP dose 5x10^8 vp . Group 2 consist 3 volunteer receive i.v . ChAd63 ME-TRAP dose 5x10^9 vp . Group 3 consist 3 volunteer receive i.v . ChAd63 ME-TRAP dose 5x10^10vp . Group 4 consist 3 volunteer receive s.c. ChAd63 ME-TRAP dose 5x10^10 vp . Group 5 consist 3 volunteer receive s.c. ChAd63 ME-TRAP dose 2x10^11 vp . The first Group 1 volunteer receive intravenous ChAd63 ME-TRAP vaccinate alone . Safety data first 72 hour follow vaccination must satisfactorily review remain group 1 volunteer vaccinate . The safety data first 72 hour follow vaccination volunteer group review first volunteer high dose group 2 vaccinate . Safety data first 72 hour follow vaccination volunteer must satisfactorily review remain group 2 volunteer vaccinate . Similarly safety data first 72 hour follow vaccination volunteer group review first volunteer high dose group 3 vaccinate . Once satisfactory review safety data first 72 hour post vaccination volunteer , remain group 3 volunteer enrol receive IV vaccination . In parallel Group 1 , first Group 4 volunteer receive subcutaneous Chad63 ME-TRAP vaccinate alone . Safety data first 72 hour follow vaccination must satisfactorily review remain group 4 volunteer vaccinate . The safety data first 72 hour follow vaccination volunteer group review first volunteer high dose group 5 vaccinate . Once satisfactory review safety data first 72 hour post vaccination volunteer , remain group 5 volunteer enrol receive SC vaccination .</detailed_description>
