	<detailed_description>1 . INTRODUCTION For neurological neurodegenerative disease genetic inheritance well document , guidelins improved ensure quality diagnostic approach . Unfortunately , scenario reproducible neurological neurodegenerative disorder , also strong genetic component document . This due : - Polygenicity , different gene contribute phenotype ( eg Spastic Paraplegia , associate 50 gene ) - Multifactorial disease , genetic explains part etiology disease ( Parkinson 's disease identify gene responsible 15 % patient clinical diagnosis ) - Disorders well establish genetic component , responsible gene identify . Therefore , sometimes impossible unlikely complete molecular diagnosis patient classical complex phenotype New technology Next Generation Sequencing ( NGS ) , allow analysis hundred gene single experiment . The implementation technology help identify new gene new variant associate 2 . DESIGN STUDY The goal study improve diagnostic approach molecular genetics NGS . This allow characterize genomic variation new gene responsible neurological neurodegenerative disease . In particular , NGS identify : 1 . New gene associate disease characterize genetic heterogeneity , Mendelian polygenic heredity . 2 . New variation responsible disease increase genetic susceptibility . 3 . EXPERIMENTAL PHASE ( Attachment 1 ) 1 . Neurology , require , Genetic Counseling . 2 . Genetic Counseling identifies molecular analysis specific patient . A blood sample 6 milliliter collect informed consent ( informed consent Neuromed version 2.12.2015 ) . 3 . Specific guideline test follow first diagnostic approach . Molecular analysis carry Institute Molecular Genetics Center IRCCS INM Neuromed use Sanger sequencing , multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification ( MLPA ) microsatellites . 4 . If specific analysis detect mutation , NGS panel consist 4,813 gene associate known clinical phenotype ( clinical exome , Mendeliome ) apply . 4 . MATERIALS AND METHODS - DNA/RNA EXTRACTION Genomic DNA isolate peripheral blood leukocyte accord standard procedure . Total RNA isolate cultured cell use TRIzol Reagent ( Invitrogen , Life Technologies ) accord manufacturer 's instruction . The concentration purity DNA/RNA sample determinate use Nanodrop 2000 ( Thermo Scientific , Life Technologies ) . - MLPA ( Multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification ) MLPA ( Multiplex Ligation-dependent Probe Amplification ) multiplex PCR method detect abnormal copy number 50 different genomic DNA RNA sequence , able distinguish sequence differ one nucleotide . Typical MLPA target sequence amplify , MLPA probe hybridise target sequence . In contrast standard multiplex PCR , single pair PCR primer use MLPA amplification . The result amplification product SALSA MLPA kit range 130 480 nt length analyse capillary electrophoresis . Comparing peak pattern obtain reference sample indicate sequence show aberrant copy number . The MLPA reaction divide five major step : 1 ) DNA denaturation hybridisation MLPA probe ; 2 ) ligation reaction ; 3 ) PCR reaction ; 4 ) separation amplification product electrophoresis ; 5 ) data analysis • SEQUENCING The DNA sample sequence combined tube primer , DNA polymerase , DNA nucleotide ( dATP , dTTP , dGTP , dCTP ) . The four dye-labeled , chain-terminating dideoxy nucleotide add well , much small amount ordinary nucleotide . The mixture first heat denature template DNA ( separate strand ) , cool primer bind single-stranded template . Once primer bound , temperature raise , allow DNA polymerase synthesize new DNA start primer . DNA polymerase continue add nucleotide chain happen add dideoxy nucleotide instead normal one . At point , nucleotides added , strand end dideoxy nucleotide . This process repeat number cycle . By time cycle complete , 's virtually guarantee dideoxy nucleotide incorporate every single position target DNA least one reaction . That , tube contain fragment different length , end nucleotide position original DNA ( see figure ) . The ends fragment label dye indicate final nucleotide . After reaction do , fragment run long , thin tube contain gel matrix process call capillary gel electrophoresis . Short fragment move quickly pore gel , long fragment move slowly . As fragment cross `` finish line '' end tube , 's illuminate laser , allow attach dye detect . The small fragment ( end one nucleotide primer ) cross finish line first , follow next-smallest fragment ( end two nucleotide primer ) , forth . Thus , color dye register one another detector , sequence original piece DNA build one nucleotide time . The data record detector consist series peak fluorescence intensity , show chromatogram . The DNA sequence read peaks chromatogram . • MICROSATELLITE Microsatellite analysis include PCR amplification microsatellite locus use fluorescently label primer ( 6-FAM , TET , HEX , NED ) ; label PCR product analyze capillary electrophoresis ( ABI PRISM 310 3130 XL Applied Biosystem ) ( CE ) electrophoresis separate allele size . The result process use GENESCAN GENOTYPER5 program . Once establish value individual allele , assign individual . • NEXT GENERATION SEQUENCING ( NGS ) In principle , concept behind NGS technology similar CE sequencing—DNA polymerase catalyze incorporation fluorescently label deoxyribonucleotide triphosphates ( dNTPs ) DNA template strand sequential cycle DNA synthesis . During cycle , point incorporation , nucleotide identify fluorophore excitation . The critical difference , instead sequence single DNA fragment , NGS extend process across million fragment massively parallel fashion . Illumina sequence synthesis ( SBS ) chemistry widely adopt chemistry industry deliver high accuracy , high yield error-free read , high percentage base call Q30.6-8 The Illumina NGS workflows include 4 basic step ( Figure 3 ) : Library Preparation—The sequence library prepared random fragmentation DNA cDNA sample , follow 5 ' 3 ' adapter ligation . Alternatively , `` tagmentation '' combine fragmentation ligation reaction single step greatly increase efficiency library preparation process.9 Adapter-ligated fragment PCR amplify gel purify . Cluster Generation—For cluster generation , library load flow cell fragment capture lawn surface-bound oligos complementary library adapter . Each fragment amplify distinct , clonal cluster bridge amplification . When cluster generation complete , templates ready sequence . Sequencing—Illumina technology utilize proprietary reversible terminator-based method detects single base incorporate DNA template strand . As 4 reversible terminator-bound dNTPs present sequence cycle , natural competition minimize incorporation bias greatly reduce raw error rate compare technologies.6 , 7 The result highly accurate base-by-base sequence virtually eliminate sequence-context-specific error , even within repetitive sequence region homopolymers . Data Analysis—During data analysis alignment , newly identify sequence read align reference genome . Following alignment , many variation analysis possible single nucleotide polymorphism ( SNP ) insertion-deletion ( indel ) identification , read count RNA method , phylogenetic metagenomic analysis , . 5 . STATISTICS In order determine pathogenicity variant , perform : - Molecular test proband 's family . - In-silico analysis bioinformatics software ( Sift : http : //sift.jcvi.org/ ; PolyPhen : http : //genetics.bwh.harvard.edu/pph2/ ) . - Frequency analysis general population SNPs Banks ( dbSNP : http : //www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/projects/SNP/ ; EXAC : http : //exac.broadinstitute.org/ ) 6 .
