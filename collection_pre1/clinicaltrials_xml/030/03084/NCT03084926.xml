	<brief_summary>This study investigate new experimental therapy , MP0274 , DARPin® drug candidate target HER2 . Preclinical study suggest MP0274 may provide additional benefit treatment HER2-positive cancer . This first study MP0274 human main purpose test safety tolerability patient HER2-positive cancer . This study also examine blood level MP0274 several escalate dose level recommend dose development determine . The recommend dose test second part study confirm safety ass preliminary biologic anti-tumor activity</brief_summary>
