	<brief_summary>Medical device technology use patient gain popularity . Modern cardiac disease management seek integrate multiple device technology capability optimize health outcome . Fitbit , Inc. manufacture line wireless-enabled activity , wearable tracker use conjunction mobile device . The Fitbit tracker use three-dimensional accelerometer sense record movement . This technology represent new frontier patient health care provider understand track physical activity real time . The primary aim current project ass whether activity feedback use FitBit technology affect implantable cardioverter defibrillator ( ICD ) patient activity level measure ICD accelerometer . The investigator also examine perceive added value Fitbit technology ICD patient user experience . Approximately 50 participant recruit . Participants experimental group ( n = 25 ) use Fitbit device 12 week . The experimental group receive fitness goal ( number step per day ) increase activity baseline value minimum 7000 step per day week 9 intervention . Both group receive weekly text message encourage activity . Feedback technology satisfaction , cardiac anxiety , cardiac self-care , health care utilization elicit patient multiple time point . Additional information gain patient decision-making participant may elect continue Fitbit use beyond study period ; allow behavioral evidence perceive value add technology .</brief_summary>
