	<brief_title>Safety Efficacy hiHep Bioartificial Liver Support System Treat Acute Liver Failure</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Liver damage remain life-threatening syndrome . With increase number patient await transplantation , effort make develop extracorporeal method support replace function fail organ . An bioartificial liver support system provide main function liver : detoxification , synthesis , regulation . It may prolonger expect survival time acute liver failure patient . Direct reprogramming fibroblast hepatic lineage could offer new type solution bioartificial liver support system . Our team already generate human induced hepatocytes ( hiHeps ) fibroblasts lentiviral expression FOXA3 , HNF1A , HNF4A . hiHeps express hepatic gene program , expand vitro , display function characteristic mature hepatocytes , include cytochrome P450 enzyme activity biliary drug clearance . hiHeps restore liver function prolong survival .
