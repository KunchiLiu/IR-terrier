Study design : Randomized control intervention trial . Study site : This study conduct Bauniabadh , Mirpur Dhaka city , peri-urban slum area . Study participant : The study participant 12-18 month old child either sex MAM ( WLZ : &lt; -2 -3 ) stunting ( LAZ : &lt; -2 -3 ) . Initial screen enrolment : Children screen enrol household survey section 11 Mirpur Field Research Assistants ( FRAs ) follow pre-specified inclusion criterion . Fulfilling enrolment criterion upon receive consent study participation parent legal guardian , child respective mother/caregiver enrol randomly assign one four arm accord computer-generated random number use permuted block vary lengths four twelve study 1 . Similarly , child mother/caregiver enrol randomly assign one three arm accord computer-generated random number use permuted block block length three nine study 2 3 respectively . The code assign type MDCFs keep close opaque envelope assign enrolled child . Feeding session : The child mothers/caregivers request come nutrition centre establish community Mirpur preferably 9 11 3-5 pm day 1 . The mother request give/allow food breast milk precede 2 hour observe meal time day observe feeding . On day nutrition centre , child offer 25 gram ( two meal preferably 9-11 3-5 pm ) MDCFs decide random allocation . During feeding time , mother ask spoon feed respective pre-weighed diet child s/he refuse eat , describe . After two-minute pause , diet offer second time s/he refuse . After second two-minute pause , diet offer third time refuse . After third refusal , feed episode consider 'terminated'.7 The duration feeding ( exclude intervene 'rest period ' ) record stopwatch , total duration feeding note . If child demand finish food , she/he offer amount offer begin . This feeding episode last maximum 60 minute . Measured volume plain water also give amount water take 60 minute meal period measure . The feeding episode take place direct supervision train study personnel . Children consider refuse intake move head away food , cry , clamp mouth clinch teeth , become agitate , spit food refuse swallow.8 The amount MDCF actually ingest calculated subtracting leave offered amount . Pre-weighed napkin provide ; food regurgitate , vomit spilled swabbed , weigh subtracted amount offer . Acceptability categorize 'accepted eagerly ' ate food readily , make fuss , spit , vomit cry observe meal . Children categorize 'accepted eagerly ' ate offer food either make fuss , spit , vomit cry observed meal . The third category child consume offer food all.9 The amount consume food ( g ) , energy ( kcal ) category acceptability analyze . The enrolled child monitor daily home visit train Field Field Research Assistants possible side effects/adverse event ( e.g . rash , urticaria due food allergy significant change clinical status ) week . If side effects/adverse event observe treat accord standard management provide Dhaka Hospital icddr , b .
