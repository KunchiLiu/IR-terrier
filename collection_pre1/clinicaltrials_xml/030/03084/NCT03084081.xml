	<brief_title>An Innovative Treatment Cervical Precancer ( UH3 )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Cryotherapy current gold standard treatment precancerous cervical lesion low resource setting . However , recent year number issues—particularly use compress gas , require storage replenishment large potentially dangerous tanks—have emerge clear limitation . Two technologies—the LMICs-adapted CryoPen® , manufacture sell CryoPen® , Inc. ( TX , USA ) , thermoablator commercialize WISAP Medical Technology ( Germany ) treatment option precancerous cervical lesion run electricity avoid difficulty associate compressed gas . The LMIC-adapted CryoPen® ( hereafter , CryoPen® ) differ previous cryotherapy method require external source gas ( tank ) , since gas cooling built system . Thermoablation ( also call thermocoagulation ) use since 1970s treatment cervical lesion . This treatment probe heat temperature 100 120ºC . It also effective , inexpensive method require high-level healthcare provider . The purpose study conduct randomize non-inferiority clinical trial compare CryoPen® WiSAP thermoablator CO2-based cryotherapy treatment CIN2 severe diagnosis ( `` CIN2+ '' ) exclude microinvasive invasive cervical cancer . The primary objective compare CIN2+ cure rate treatment LMIC-adapted CryoPen® , WISAP thermoablator , CO2-based cryotherapy . Women recruit Salvadorian Social Security Hospital ( ISSS ) San Salvador , El Salvador , La Liga Contra el Cancer Lima , Peru Hospital Universitario San Ignacio Bogota , Colombia . All referral site woman abnormal cytology . The investigator approach approximately 1,602 woman CIN2+ 2.5 year enrollment phase ( 30 month ) . Assuming approximately 80 % participation rate , approximately 1,281 woman enrolled— 1,152 ( 90 % ) eligible cryotherapy ( i.e . contraindication ) 129 ineligible undergo alternative treatment . The investigator estimate approximately 20 % lose follow-up twelve-month visit , complete data available total 922 woman ( 57.55 % 1,602 ) treat either CO2-based cryotherapy , LMIC-adapted CryoPen® , thermoablation . Eligible woman biopsy-confirmed CIN2+ undergo HPV genotyping next-generation sequencing . The specimen take prior treatment establish baseline HPV type present . If different HPV type present post-treatment specimen , classify new rather persistent infection . Testing conducted National Cancer Institute Rockville , MD . Women randomly assign one three study arm : A. CO2-based cryotherapy ( double freeze ) , B. CryoPen® ( single freeze ) , C. Thermoablation 40 second 100ºC . At pre-treatment visit , consent woman receive pregnancy test part eligibility criteria enrollment study . Pre-vaginal culture collect analyzed bacterial vaginosis , yeast , gonorrhea chlamydia . The culture collect 6-week follow-up visit . Consented woman enrol undergo pelvic exam visual inspection cervix follow placement dilute acetic acid cervix . Images cervix take mobile ODT device take treatment . Women deem ineligible cryotherapy undergo LEEP immediately . In case suspect cancer , woman appropriately refer . Six week post-treatment , woman return visit evaluation treatment side effect ; woman complete questionnaire ass presence pain cramp , bleeding , stenosis , watery discharge , malodorous discharge evaluate evidence cervicitis . In addition , vaginal culture collect analyzed bacterial vaginosis , yeast , gonorrhea , chlamydia . One year post-treatment , woman return follow-up visit determine residual disease , primary endpoint . Residual disease determine colposcopy four-quadrant biopsy . In addition , VIA , cytology , high-risk HPV DNA test careHPV perform . Genotyping next-generation sequencing repeat differentiate persistent new infection . The goal evaluate sensitivity VIA , cytology , HPV test post-treatment . Women diagnose recurrent/untreated CIN2+ biopsy ask return undergo LEEP . Women suspect cancer biopsy refer local cancer hospital standard care .</detailed_description>
