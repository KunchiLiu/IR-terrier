	<brief_title>Effects Almond Consumption Cardiovascular , Metabolomic , Microbiome Profiles Millennials</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Nut ( principally almond ) consumption help ameliorate cardiovascular disease , reduce risk type II diabetes mellitus ( T2DM ) . Recent study demonstrate improvement glycemic control T2DM impair glucose tolerant ( IGT ) subject well healthy adult . The association nut consumption diabetes prevalence largely mediate change body mass ( adiposity ) . The application metabolomic lipidomic approach well ass mechanisms regulate carbohydrate lipid almond-based study perform . Additionally , gut microbiota propose contribute number metabolic disorder include insulin sensitivity , glucose metabolism , cardiometabolic risk factor . However , data demonstrate complex interaction among dietary intervention , gut microbiome , glucose regulation , cardiovascular phenotype lacking . Furthermore , study nut consumption health perform adult ( median age subject : +40 year ) give increase incidence metabolic disorder ( obesity , insulin resistance , etc . ) much young stages life especially Central Valley California , data exist potential benefit almonds ameliorate metabolic disorder much early life stage . This may clinically important study adult transition adolescence adulthood associate number potential risk factor unique age group , especially enter first year college . The fixed age participant contribute homogeneous population previously study , greatly minimize potential age-dependent alteration physiology either potentiate mask effect almonds metabolic mechanism . The nutritional independence associate go away college pose many potential health challenge , example phenomenon , `` Freshman 15 '' . The increased prevalence overweight obesity great 18-29 year old , especially among report college education ( 10.6 % -17.8 % v 7.1 % -12.1 % 18-29 year old overall ) suggest aspect collegiate experience associate weight gain . While almond-supplemented diet show reduce body mass ameliorate weight gain , evidence substantiate benefit functional food address weight gain commonly associate transition college scarce untapped area research . Furthermore , transition nutritional independence make new college student vulnerable additional alteration eat pattern . Among concern relatively high number college freshman report skip breakfast ( 20 % -43 % ) , far skipped meal among study review . This important chronically skip breakfast adolescent detrimental outcomes cardiometabolic health negative impact academic performance . Additionally , college student snack , snack common morning afternoon . Data suggest benefit snacking peanut almond . However , benefit snack young college student routinely skip meal ( breakfast ) define . Therefore , able demonstrate benefit almonds college `` breakfast skipper '' would significant implication young adult first year college , thus , provide ideal opportunity address line inquiry . Lastly , application metabolomic lipidomic approach well assess mechanisms regulate carbohydrate lipid almond-based study perform . Advancements high-throughput analytical technique initiate renaissance study metabolism grand scale allow robust assessment nutritional status cellular response . These approach provide advantage mapping metabolites fashion change mechanisms elucidate demonstrated SuGAR Project .</detailed_description>
