	<detailed_description>Investigators propose study intervention provide patient-centered , automated decision support diabetes provider goal improve adherence medical recommendation ( patient provider ) , improve self-management , ultimately improve health outcome . Computer decision support system ( CDSS ) scientifically demonstrate advantage improve care , potential revolutionize diabetes care allow increase reactive proactive contact health care team , real-time adherence support , intensification treatment . In study , investigator implement ADA recommend standard care use CDSS develop research group - Child Health Improvement Computer Automation ( CHICA ) system.9 One great strength CHICA system ability implement evidence-based recommendation authoritative source , case ADA , format integrates easily routine care . A second strength CHICA system ability screen patient-centered concern , include barrier optimal care literacy , socioeconomic issue ( i.e. , food insecurity , housing insecurity , etc . ) , mental health issue ( i.e. , depression ) . The provider alert , safety mechanism set motion ( i.e. , referral mental health provider , etc . ) address identify issue . In order ensure design effective CDSS intervention possible , study team , collaboration Patient Engagement Core ( PEC ) Indiana Clinical Translational Science Institute , partner adolescent , parent , stakeholder way exceed standard expectation engagement party research . Investigators experience work directly patient elucidate patient-centered outcome , identify determinant adherence , co-design intervention inherently patient-centered.10-14 By combine patient-centered design approach along CDSS investigator able individually tailor recommendation meet real need patient , take account adolescent patient 's perspective input . This truly innovative approach offer improve technology-based support system diabetes management along attention patient-centered goal use co-designed intervention diabetes self-management .</detailed_description>
