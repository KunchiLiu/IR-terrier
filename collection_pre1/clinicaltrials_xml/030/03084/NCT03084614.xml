	<criteria>INCLUSION CRITERIA : 1 . Age 18+ year . 2 . Willing allow storage blood , breast milk , cell future research . 3 . Willing genetic testing perform . 4 . Meets one 3 follow criterion : 1 . Confirmed exposure : Exposure verifiably document ( eg , receive immunization DNCB sensitization treatment ) . OR Clinical history consistent establish epidemiology microbe interest ( eg , documentation past infection ; less priority travel endemic area live individual suffers chronic infection target microbe ) . AND Positive result establish clinical immunity test ( eg , viral RNA , antibody titer , etc ) . 2 . Suspected exposure : Clinical history consistent establish epidemiology microbe interest ( eg , travel endemic area , documentation past infection ) establish clinical assay exist verify exposure . 3 . Nonexposed : Absence exposure target microorganism measure lack exposure infect individual , lack travel endemic area , immunization history , negative screening test , method establish exposure history mucosal microbial agent . EXCLUSION CRITERIA : 1 . Active use immunosuppressive medication . 2 . Any condition , opinion investigator , contraindicate participation study .</criteria>
