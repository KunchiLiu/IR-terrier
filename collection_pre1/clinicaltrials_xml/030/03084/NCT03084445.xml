	<detailed_description>Objectives hypothesis The scale diversity chemical worldwide use today vast , range pharmaceutical food product , plastic , gasoline , semiconductor chip . Many chemical release environment find air , water , soil , house dust , food supply , result exposure human . Characterizing extent exposure effect exposure vulnerable population , pregnant woman child , utmost importance chemical structure many compound resemble hormone estrogen , testosterone thyroid hormone , affect neurodevelopment health effect . Here , focus class compound : heavy metal , volatile organic compound ( VOCs ) , brominate flame retardant ( PBDEs ) phthalates. , characterize extent exposure pregnant woman infant Israel , biomonitoring study general population scarce . We also propose examine select outcome pregnant woman offspring relation compound , establish biorepository study . BTEX ( Benzene , Toluene , Ethylbenzene , Xylene ) : Volatile organic compound ( VOCs ) compound low boil point ; VOC exposures originate numerous natural anthropogenic source clean product , paint , solvent , personal care product , automotive exhaust , tobacco smoke . Exposure certain VOCs may increase risk birth defect , neurocognitive impairment , asthma , cancer . The known VOC metabolite acrolein , acrylamide , acrylonitrile , benzene , 1-bromopropane , 1,3-butadiene , carbon disulfide , crotonaldehyde , cyanide , N , N-dimethylformamide , ethylbenzene , ethylene oxide , propylene oxide , styrene , tetrachloroethylene , toluene , trichloroethylene , vinyl chloride , xylene exposure . Benzene , toluene , ethylbenzene xylene isomer ( BTEX ) , aromatic hydrocarbon , part VOC metabolites play major role industry air pollution 1 . Prena¬tal exposure air pollution ( contain BTEX ) might associate adverse pregnancy outcome , include intrauterine growth restriction ( IUGR ) , low birth weight ( LBW ) , preterm birth ( PTB ) , intrauter¬ine mortality . Exposure BTEX chemical associate negative impact sperm quantity quality . Benzene toluene exposure associate abnormal menstrual cycle . Direct adverse effect BTEX chemical observe ovarian cell apoptosis , proliferation , hormone release animal ovarian cell . Exposures benzene toluene , commonly use produce unconventional oil gas ( UOG ) operation , associate increased risk miscarriage 2 . Xylene environmental pollutant . It also use dye , paint , polish , medical technology different industry solvent . Human life surround wide range VOCs , include xylene cause harmful health effect xylene exposure occur breath , eye , oral , dermal route . Xylene mainly metabolize liver via oxidation methyl group , follow conjugation glycine yield hippuric acid , excrete urine . High amount dose xylene may harm liver . Prolonged exposure xylene may cause multiorgan damage : toxicity nervous , reproductive , immune , hepatic respiratory system . Furthermore , xylene reduce reproductive hormone woman cause male infertility . Studies report subsequent effect experimental animal : deformity fetus skeletal , increased interruption bone formation , redness blood fetus organ , reduce fetus weight3 . Benzene known one predominant air pollutant environment . Chronic exposure benzene know cause oxidative stress , DNA damage , aplastic anemia increase risk acute myelogenous leukemia human . The mechanism crucial toxic metabolism , reactive metabolite probably epigenetic change . Common exposures benzene tobacco smoke , automobile service station , exhaust motor vehicle , industrial emission . Chromosomal abnormality sperm also report benzene exposure4 [ 4 ] , Ethylbenzene originate tobacco smoke , burn fossil fuel , industry use ethylbenzene , carpet glue , varnish paint . The hazard ethylbenzene include acute toxicity , mutagenicity , systemic toxicity , developmental reproductive toxicity , immunotoxicity , metabolism pharmacokinetics , carcinogenicity , neurotoxicity , developmental neurotoxicity . At dos produce maternal effect ( &gt; 1000 ppm ) animal , ethylbenzene fetotoxic causing decrease fetal body weight ( bwt ) increase skeletal variations5 . Exposure toluene , industrial paint paint thinner , tobacco smoke , fossil fuels6 . Toluene intoxicate reward effect brain . Acute exposure inhalant dose dependent , reversible effect like depressed central nervous system ( CNS ) . High concentration cause sedation anesthesia , high concentration result coma death respiratory depression . At delivery , toluene-exposed infant characteristically premature and/or delayed growth . Additionally , child grow , number developmental delay impairment become evident ( e.g. , language impairment , growth retardation , hyperactivity , cerebellar dysfunction ) 7 . Trichloroethylene ( TCE ) perchloroethylene ( PCE ) part VOCs air pollution . It known risk epilepsy certain type cancer cervical cancer may increase among adult expose PCE-contaminated drinking water . Exposure gestation early childhood exposure major metabolite TCE , TCAA ( trichloroacetic acid ) administer drinking water , result increased number implantation resorption site , selective cardiac teratogenicity8,9 . Heavy metal element : Metal intake via air , water food . Air pollution exposure include inhalation ingestion ultrafine particulate matter , also call nanoparticles . Epidemiological study consistently find association small increase urban particulate health effect , include increase morbidity mortality people respiratory cardiac disease . All metal excess cause disease . Long term exposure metal cause increase metal accumulation variety body tissue . Some metal toxic others10 . The prevalent element find soil Haifa bay : - Nickel ( Ni ) - Nickel sensitivity common harmful health effect human . People work nickel refinery nickel-processing plant affect chronic bronchitis , asthma reduce lung function general population . - Lead ( Pb ) - neurological ailment learn impairment inactive enzyme , thus affect red blood cell production , amino acid function number biochemical system body . Lead exposure associate increase risk miscarriage stillbirth potentially due placental rupture . - Chromium ( Cr ) - find phase environment include air , water , soil , many chemical form pollutants serious implication environment human health . Hexavalent chromium ( Cr6 ) occur environment erosion natural chromium deposit , also product industrial process . There demonstrated instance Cr6 release environment leakage , poor storage , inadequate industrial waste disposal practice . - Mercury ( Hg ) - affect central nervous function . A source exposure breathe air spill , incinerator industry burn mercury contain fuel . Mercury , high level , may damage brain , kidney , develop fetus . Short-term exposure high level metallic mercury vapor may cause lung damage , nausea , vomit , diarrhea , increase blood pressure heart rate , skin rash , eye irritation11 . - Cadmium- elevated cadmium exposure pregnancy may inversely associated child 's cognitive function measure pre-school age . Exposure cadmium show result miscarriage stillbirth expose mother , potentially decreased level antioxidant enhance lipid peroxidation result oxidative stress12 . - Mangenase ( Mn ) - use steel production improve hardness , stiffness , strength . It may use additive gasoline improve octane rating gas . Exposure high level manganese air cause lung irritation reproductive effects.13 The central nervous system common target organ many environmental metal . The adverse effect heavy metal exposure prenatal early childhood period increase concern term high exposure body weight basis , immature metabolic pathway , delicate developmental process , life course effect . Prenatal exposure lead mercury related congenital anomaly impair neurodevelopment . Metals may interact cause synergistic antagonistic effect neurodevelopment different main effect exposure metal alone . Metals exposure prenatal childhood may affect neurodevelopment/cognitive behavior14 . If risk factor genetic , ethnic environmental exposure coincide , disease development likely progress . Exposure heavy metal pregnancy associate increased risk miscarriage and/or stillbirth . Heavy metal may routinely mobilize hydraulic fracture operation show contaminate surface ground water case ( e.g. , lead ) , also inadvertent contaminant fracture fluid . Brominated Flame Retardants Brominated Flame Retardants ( BFRs ) constitute group chemical substance use worldwide reduce fire-related injury property damage . They find polymer ( polystyrene foam , high impact polystyrene , epoxy resin ) incorporate wide variety consumer product ( textile , foam furniture , insulate foam , electrical equipment , kitchen appliance , television computer ) . In 2000 , estimate &gt; 200,000 metric ton BFRs produce annually . There currently five major BFRs : three commercial mixture polybrominated diphenyl ether ( penta- , octa- deca-BDEs ) , hexabromocyclododecane ( HBCD ) tetrabromobisphenol A ( TBBPA ) routinely present broad variety consumer good . Because BFRs leach manufacture product product dump environment , expose BFRs wide variety source . The concentration BFRs environment , increase dramatically past two decade , thanks international regulatory policy , know toxicant ( DDT , lead , PCBs ) decline . Exposure contaminate food , particularly meat dairy product , believe major contributor BFR exposure human . There report newborn young infant higher serum concentration older child adult , since generally believe infant vulnerable toxicological insult . Scientists USA report median level BDEs human breast milk increase almost 10-fold 90 's early 2000 's . The in-utero period critical period exposure ; however , scarcity information respect BFR exposure early stage human development . A study monitor tetra- octa-BDE level early mid-gestation human fetal liver placenta 1998-2006 , demonstrate toxicant cross placenta early nine week fetal age also 2006 fetal tissue level &gt; 5-fold high nine year previously . Thus , fetal BFR exposure also rise . Although BFR burden human increase exposure occur early stage development , consequence relatively unexplored . Three clinical study publish date potential effect in-utero BFR exposure fetal outcome . Elevated level BFRs breast milk correlate significantly low newborn birth weight , birth length , head size , chest circumference body mass index . Significant association maternal serum BFR level 35 week gestation level several sex hormone ( testosterone , estradiol , LH , SHBG ) 3 month old female male offspring report . In addition , Main colleague find significantly high BFR level breast milk mother whose newborn son cryptorchidism . If leave untreated , cryptorchidism lead serious reproduction-related problem : low sperm count infertility well 2- 8-fold increase risk testicular cancer . These data suggest BFRs impact early stage human development least one outcome abnormal reproductive system . This serious issue : individual 's health potentially affected future generation . Phthalates Phthalates class high production volume chemical use wide variety consumer product . They commonly use plasticizer increase flexibility durability . They also use hold fragrance , propellant . Global production phthalates increase dramatically since World War II currently estimate exceed 3.5 million metric tons/year . DEHP constitute roughly 50 % market share , use DBP BBzP also large ( &gt; 100,000 metric tons/year ) . The widespread use result ubiquitous contamination , include indoor environment , exposures high industrialized develop nation . Table 1 show source exposure phthalate diesters evaluate propose study . Some recent study , find prenatal exposure phthalates associate reduction fetal growth , short pregnancy duration , perturb thyroid function , cognitive behavioral deficit child . More data clearly require fully characterize health effect vulnerable population pregnant woman child . Specific Aims : 1 . To assess Heavy metal , VOCs , PBDEs phthalates body burden measurement chemical maternal paternal serum urine , cord blood , breastmilk neonatal meconium among several representative sub-populations . 2 . To examine association exposure heavy metal , VOCs , PBDEs phthalates ( ) pregnancy complication , ( b ) anthropometrics birth ( i.e . birth weight adjust gestational age , ponderal index , head circumference adjust gestational age ) , ( c ) cryptorchidism incidence , ( ) maternal infant thyroid function . 3 . To establish bio repository medium future study establish follow method cohort later assess development growth infant , toddler child . Patients Methods : Patients recruit three delivery room Israel : `` Assaf Harofeh Medical Center '' , `` Lis ( Sorasky ) Medical Center '' `` Rambam Medical Center '' , together around 21,000 birth annually , represent sub-populations Israel . 500 mother-father-infant trio ( total 4500 ) recruit . When arrive delivery room , sign informed consent , blood urine withdrawn mother father Heavy metal , VOCs , PBDEs phthalates level . At time thyroid function test also take mother . After delivery , cord blood take , well meconium neonate . Hair , nail Breastmilk also collect . From mother The sample analyze heavy metal , VOCs , PBDEs phthalates . During stay hospital , mother father fill standardize questionnaire regard life style factor , background information , exposure opportunity . Detailed information family history , previous present pregnancy , method delivery , perinatal complication , pregnancy outcome record medical file . Feasibility research : Delivery , maternal neonatal department medical center large number delivery annually . The population admit center representative population Israel . Since blood work part admission delivery room , since neonate invasive procedure ( meconium ) , expect many couple participate innovative study . Our comprehensive approach , use combination standardize questionnaire , maternal paternal serum , cord blood , urine , breastmilk meconium analysis chemical , provide detailed definition body burden status subject . We mean desire facilitate knowledge exchange basic clinical scientist , generate knowledge use develop policy regulation , well among scientist , health professional general public . Expected contribution environmental health Israel : These first data sub-populations exposure Heavy metal , VOCs , PBDEs phthalatesin Israel . Neonatal meconium level provide important information magnitude exposure last month pregnancy , , thus , provide insight bioaccumulative nature Heavy metal , VOCs , PBDEs phthalatesduring early stage human development , important data future risk assessment . Our comprehensive approach provide detail information status subject . Such novel knowledge would also lead development preventive counseling strategy men woman high BFR phthalate exposure order minimize risk adverse outcome . Knowledge transfer strategy essential order general public , health professional , scientist policy/law regulator appropriate knowledge base understandings recommendation future . In way , knowledge generate facilitate development prevention strategy minimize health risk Israel population .</detailed_description>
