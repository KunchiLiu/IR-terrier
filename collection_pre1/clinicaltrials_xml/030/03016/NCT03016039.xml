	<detailed_description>Pelvic inflammatory disease ( PID ) , Endometritis , Wound infection infection female reproductive system . Although PID well know pathophysiology diagnosis method I well establish true magnitude unknown . Many woman report treat PID suffer vice versa . Hence main way diagnose remain clinical currently well-established biochemical marker . In endometritis wound infection cause may know pathogen involve disease formation vary broad spectrum antibiotic need . Aims : To use curcumin supplementation additive treatment induce clinical , biochemical response remission patient suspect PID , Tubo ovarian abcess , Endometritis , wound infection . Hypothesis : An addition oral curcumin highly suspect PID/Endometritis/Wound infection patient may augment clinical biochemical response accelerate improvement sign symptom report outcomes disease . Rational : Curcumin treatment show safe efficient inflammatory state mild-moderate Ulcerative colitis ( UC ) , obesity , type II diabetes mellitus use add-on conventional treatment . In gynecology especially PID/Tubo ovarian abcess disease use Curcumin supplement never study . In future necessary study use curcumin different gynecological disease ( e.g Endometriosis/Premenstrual syndrome ( PMS ) also gynecology oncology ) inflammatory immune response involve disease .</detailed_description>
