	<brief_summary>: Epidermolysis bullosa ( EB ) simplex rare orphan disease cause mutation DNA lead abnormal dominant keratin skin . Patients EB simplex develop lifelong painful thick sol foot , current standard care supportive . This pilot study target dominant mutant keratin protein skin ameliorate severity EB simplex . The purpose improve function EB simplex foot application topical sirolimus , 2 % . The investigator plan inhibit mTOR pathway regulate translation defective keratin protein work anti proliferative pathway .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Using Topical Sirolimus 2 % Patients With Epidermolysis Bullous Simplex ( EBS ) Study</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The propose 40 week pilot study conduct prospective , double-blind , randomize , placebo-controlled crossover study . Participants assign treat foot either topical sirolimus , 2 % cream daily placebo ( vehicle-control ) 12 week , follow 4 week washout period , re-treatment foot occur cross-over intervention . These study exploit naturally occur transcriptional regulation keratin sequence , know gene aberration cause EB simplex , assess potential mTOR pathway inhibition treatment patient 's plantar lesion . The objective study ass ( 1 ) safety topical rapamycin plantar lesion treatment EB simplex , 2 ) test topical rapamycin improve clinical severity lesional skin , include pain itch , subject EB simplex end treatment versus baseline compare intrasubject placebo treat control . Wound size measurement , quality life evaluation assess use epidermolysis bullosa ( QOLEB ) , EB disease activity Scarring Index ( EBDASI ) . With result pilot study , physician would able transition supportive care ( current state art EB simplex ) target molecular therapeutic , lead improve mobility quality life patient EB simplex .</detailed_description>
