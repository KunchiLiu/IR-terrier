	<brief_title>Coronary Artery Healing Bioresorbable Scaffold</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>BACKGROUND : Bioresorbable scaffold ( BRS ) represent novel approach percutaneous coronary intervention ( PCI ) , provide transient vessel support drug-delivery capability without long-term limitation ( late stent thrombosis ) metallic drug-eluting stent . Patients Non-ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction ( NSTEMI ) often feature thrombus-rich lesion large necrotic core , may associate delayed arterial healing impair stent-related outcome . Besides clinical indication underlie plaque morphology , sufficient potent strut coverage depend several additional factor ( patient characteristic , stent type procedural factor ) . Particularly , acute incomplete stent apposition strong procedural risk factor later deficient neointimal coverage . Optical coherence tomography ( OCT ) high-resolution intravascular imaging modality , enable in-vivo evaluation immediate stenting result , vascular healing pattern include strut coverage follow-up . AIM : The objective study investigate OCT-guided Magmaris BRS implantation patient NSTEMI improve coronary arterial heal 6 month compare routine angiographic guidance . Further investigate plaque composition/lipid content influence vascular healing . METHOD : The study design prospective , randomized trial . After pre-dilation , patient randomly assign either : ( 1 ) OCT-guided PCI , ( 2 ) angio-guided PCI Magmaris BRS implantation . In OCT-guided group , OCT use vessel BRS sizing . After Magmaris BRS implantation result control OCT : 1 ) BRS expansion and/or , 2 ) strut malapposition and/or , 3 ) edge dissection- and/or 4 ) residual stenosis distal and/or proximal reference segment ( ) may require intervention . A final OCT perform case re-intervention . In angio-guided group OCT perform angiography final acceptable result . A follow-up OCT perform 6 month patient assess vascular healing vasomotor test perform half patient . After 12 month dynamic change vascular heal assess first enrol half patient .</detailed_description>
