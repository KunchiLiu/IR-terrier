	<brief_title>A Trial Pembrolizumab Refractory Atypical Anaplastic Meningioma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This multicenter , prospective , single arm , open label , interventional study . The goal study , evaluate feasibility efficacy pembrolizumab treatment recurrent progressive meningioma ( WHO grade II-III ) hemangiopericytoma ( HPC ) . All patient receive IV pembrolizumab , dose 200mg , every 3 week . Patients treat disease progression intolerable toxicity . Treatment stop one year treatment case stable disease completer response , re-initiation treatment upon progression . Expression PD1 PD-L1 test , tumor cell , use IHC stain biopsy material obtain previous surgery . All patient baseline neurologic clinical exam , MRI scan , brain dedicate CT-PET scan , baseline cognitive exam QOL assessment dedicate questionnaire . Patients clinical neurological exam every treatment cycle . MRI scan repeat 2 month begin trial drug administration every 2-3 month . There designate specific criterion response assessment treatment meningioma . Therefore , response evaluation make use RECIST 1.1 criterion , use solid tumor . The trial allow continuation pembrolizumab case stable improve clinical response , pseudo-progression suspect MRI . In addition , response assessment also make accord RANO criterion , use high grade glioma . This compare RECIST evaluation , use treatment decision making .</detailed_description>
