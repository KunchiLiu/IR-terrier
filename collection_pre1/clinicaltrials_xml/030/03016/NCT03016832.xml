	<detailed_description>1 . Name Investigational Products Huangkui capsule 2 . Trial Topic A Randomized , Double-blinded , Parallel , control , Multicenter Clinical Trial ofHuangkui Capsule Treating Type II Diabetic Nephropathy ( DKD ) 3 . Trial Objectives Primary objective : To evaluate HuangKui capsule efficacy treatment type II diabetes ACR . Secondary objective : To evaluate efficacy HuangKui capsule 24-hour urinary protein changes、reduce PCR-increase eGFR , improve micro-inflammatory state , improve Traditional Chinese medicine clinical efficacy . 4 . Trial Design Designed block randomize , double-blinded , parallel control , multi-center clinical tria 4.1 Multi-center : The trial propose conduct department Nephrology Endocrinology nine hospital simultaneously . 4.2 Randomization : Using stratify block randomize design . The randomization number generate SAS statistical software . 4.3 Arms : The study subject divide 3 arm : Huangkui arm , control arm combine treatment arm . 4.4 Estimation subject number This study base main indicator ACR calculate sample size , accord clinical protocol : ①The change ACR Irbesartan combine Huangkui capsule superior Irbesartan monotherapy . ②The change ACR monotherapy group significantly low irbesartan monotherapy group According experience clinical treatment , find change ACR 12.85mg / g treatment Irbesartan combine Huangkui capsule group 6.50mg / g treatment Irbesartan group , α = 0.05 ( bilateral ( 1-β ) = 80 % , standard deviation change value ACR treatment irbesartan combine Huangkui capsule group 17.18 , Check sample size calculation formula The number sample group calculate n western medicine group = n combine treatment group = 110 case . Another group base clinical treatment experience take standard deviation 17.18 , take α = 0.025 ( unilateral test ) , β = 0.2 , , degree control ( 1-β ) = 80 % case , non-inferior boundary value 6.50mg / g , accord non-inferior test sample size calculation formula , The number sample group calculate n western medicine group = n Chinese traditional treatment group = 110 cases.According program requirement , three group design 1 : 1 : 1 , take account blanding method 20 % rejection rate . ultimately total 414 case include case , group 138 case . 4.5 Blinding : double-blinding . Blinding conduct statistician two level blind . Level 1 Blinding : blind investigational product . The investigational product comparative product use unified packaging ; level 2 blinding : blinding packaging box investigational product . 5 . Diagnostic criterion The etiology Diabetic nephropathy kidney damage , refer DN past ( diabetic nephropathy ) . But 2007 , American Foundation Kidney Disease ( NKF ) develop guideline life quality kidney disease ( NKF / KDOQI ) . The guideline recommend DKD ( diabetic kidney disease ) instead DN . In 2014 , American Diabetes Association ( ADA ) NKF reach consensus DKD refer chronic kidney disease cause diabetes , include glomerular filtration rate ( GFR ) less 60ml.min-1.1.73m-2 urine white Protein / creatinine ratio ( ACR ) high 30 mg / g 3 month , associate diabetic retinopathy . During diagnosis , one follow circumstance happen , consider CKD cause ( 1 ) diabetic retinopathy ; ( 2 ) GFR low decrease rapidly ; ( 3 ) sharp increase proteinuria nephrotic syndrome ; ( 4 ) refractory hypertension ; ( 5 ) urinary sediment activity ; ( 6 ) symptom sign systemic disease ; ( 7 ) glomerular filtration rate decrease 30 % within 2-3 month initiation treatment angiotensin convert enzyme inhibitor ( ACEI ) angiotensin II receptor antagonist ( ARB ) . 5.2 Table TCM symptom/signs Diagnostic dosage It refer `` Clinical research guideline new drug Traditional Chinese Medicine `` ( 2002 version ) , publish China Medical Science andTechnology Press 6 . Treatment option 6.1 Basic treatment 6.1.1 Anti-hypotensive We choose antihypertensive drug Monotherapy combine control blood pressure expect ACEI ARB , control blood pressure 160 / 90mmHg follow 6.1.2 Anti-hypoglycemic We use oral hypoglycemic agent insulin hypoglycemic , glycosylated hemoglobin ≤ 8.5 % . 6.1.3 Anti-hypolipidemic We choose use statin fibrates lipid-lowering drug . 6.1.4 Diet control Patients edema limit salt water , daily sodium intake &lt; 5g ; high protein diet increase glomerular hyperperfusion , high filtration , therefore advocated principle high quality low-protein diet . Protein intake high biological value animal protein-based , early protein intake limit 1g/（kg•d） 6.2 Investigational product Huangkui Capsule : produce SZYY Group Pharmaceutical Limited , Jiangsu , 0.5g×30 capsules/box Placebo simulate Huangkui capsule : produce SZYY Group Pharmaceutical Limited , 0.5g×30 capsules/box Irbesartan tablet : produce Sanofi ( Hangzhou ) Pharmaceutical Co. , Ltd. , 150mg×7 capsules/box Placebo simulate Irbesartan tablet : produce SZYY Group Pharmaceutical Limited , Jiangsu , 150mg×7 capsules/box 6.3 Trial process 6.3.1 Treatment observation period The subject meet inclusion criterion randomize three group 1:1:1 ratio . Test group : Placebo drug simulate Irbesartan tablet 150mg /qd , oral dose ; Huangkui Capsule 2.5g/tid , oral dose . Control group : irbesartan tablet 150mg /qd , oral dose ; Placebo drug simulate Huangkui capsule 2.5g/tid , oral dose . Combined treatment group : irbesartan tablet 150mg /qd , oral dose ; Huangkui Capsule 2.5g/tid , oral dose . 6.3.2 period treatment Treatment observation period 24 week , follow-up point : Week 0 , 4 , 8 , 12 , 16 , 20 , 24 . 6.4 Concomitant medication During import period throughout treatment , use RAS blocker ( ARB ACEI ) investigational product irbesartan Potassium-sparing diuretic , Calcium dobesilate , Aldehyde-containing starch , Chinese medicine reduce proteinuria . If medicine use trial , subject continue use . The use medicine record . 6.5 ACR Detection Specimens : one - time morning urine ( 5:00 ) ; Urinary creatinine detection method : enzyme kinetics ; urinary albumin detection method : immune turbidimetric method . 6.6 PCR detection Specimens : 24h urine Urine creatinine detection method : Enzyme kinetic method Urine protein detection method : dye bind method PCR = urinary protein / creatinine 7 . Efficacy endpoint 7.1 Efficacy endpoint 7.1.1 Primary endpoint ACR baseline change change rate 7.1.2 Secondary endpoint （1）24-hour urinary protein quantification baseline change change rate （2）PCR baseline change change rate （3）Glomerular filtration rate ( eGFR ) baseline change （4）High sensitivity C - reactive protein baseline value （5）TCM syndrome Efficacy endpoint Changes rate change treatment . [ Time point : baseline,12-weeks treatment,24-weeks treatment ] 7.2 Efficacy endpoint Evaluation endpoint 7.2.1 The ACR change rate ( refer `` Guiding principles clinical research treatment chronic nephritis traditional Chinese medicine '' , 2002 version ; The State Administration Traditional Chinese Medicine 1987 develop Efficacy endpoint chronic glomerulonephritis standard ) Complete remission : ACR le 30mg/g ; Markedly effective : ACR decrease 50 % treatment Effective : ACR decrease 30 % -50 % treatment Invalid : meet target . 7.2.2 Efficacy endpoint TCM syndrome Changes value rate treatment treatment [ Time point : baseline,12-weeks treatment,24-weeks treatment ] 8 . Safety Evaluation endpoints 8.1 Vital sign , body temperature , pulse , breathing , blood pressure . 8.2 Blood , urine routine test , liver function test ( ALB、ALT、AST ) , renal function test ( Bun、SCr , UA、eGFR ) , electrocardiogram , blood potassium , blood sugar ; Adverse events/adverse reaction . 9 . Statistical Methods All statistical calculation carry use SAS v9.3 statistical analysis software , hypothesis test use bilateral test , unless otherwise specify , overall comparison test level = 0.05 . Statistical analysis includes：Three group subject enrol No. , drop exclude case , demographic baseline characteristic , compliance , efficacy analysis safety analysis . For quantitative data , conduct descriptive statistical analysis case , average , standard deviation , minimum , median , maximum , upper quartile ( Q1 ) , low quartile ( Q3 ) 95 % confidence interval ( 95 % CI ) . Comparisons treatment group perform use either analysis variance Wilcoxon rank sum test . If influence covariates take account , general linear model ( GLM ) use . Descriptive statistical analysis qualitative data give term number case percentage . Count data compare treatment group , use x2 test , Fisher exact probability method ; grade data treatment group group treatment comparison analysis , Wilcoxon rank sum test . If effect center factor take account , CMH x2 test Logistic regression use .</detailed_description>
