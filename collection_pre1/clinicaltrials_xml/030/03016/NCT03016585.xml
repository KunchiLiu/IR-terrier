	<brief_summary>Fibromyalgia ( FM ) idiopathic disease affect approximately 3 % world population , primarily diagnose middle-aged woman . Although FM mainly characterize chronic pain fatigue , reduce muscular strength flexibility common symptom associate presentation disorder . Interestingly , etiology underlie mechanism FM completely understand , previous finding suggest autonomic dysfunction may explain FM symptom . Compared age-matched healthy individual , patient FM attenuate autonomic function associate reduction vagal tone increase sympathetic activity . Therefore , autonomic function worthwhile target intervention individual FM . Although traditional exercise ( aerobic resistance ) show effectively improve HRV parameter FM symptom , FM patient display decline adherence traditional exercise continue experience considerable pain fatigue year original diagnosis ultimately require medication control symptoms.Thus , new approach need improve autonomic function clinical symptom patient FM , ultimately improve physical emotional functioning lead good quality life . Tai Chi ( TC ) form ancient Chinese martial art integrate slow movement , control breathe mental concentration . TC train safe special population previously show decrease pain , fatigue well FM relate symptoms.However , potential role TC train autonomic function largely unexplored . The investigator hypothesis 12 week TC training would improve primary outcome autonomic function improvement sympathovagal balance , secondary outcome measure FM symptom ( pain , fatigue sleep quality ) , strength flexibility .</brief_summary>
