	<brief_summary>Dolutegravir ( DTG ) potent inhibitor human immunodeficiency virus type 1 ( HIV-1 ) integrase develop treatment HIV . This phase 3b ( PH3b ) , non-randomized , open-label , multi-center , treatment rollover study . The primary objective pediatric interventional study provide continue access DTG eligible participant previously participate international maternal pediatric adolescent acquire immunodeficiency syndrome [ AIDS ] clinical trial ( IMPAACT ) P1093 study ( parent study ) locally access DTG public sector . The P1093 study design evaluate pharmacokinetics ( PK ) , safety , tolerability antiviral activity DTG HIV-1 experience adolescent child well treatment-naive infant toddler . Participants evidence virological failure ( VF ) tolerate DTG parent study without significant toxicity lead permanent discontinuation drug withdrawal parent study consider open-label continued access study . Participants receive age/weight appropriate dose DTG define parent study . The objective study support evaluation serious adverse event . The duration participant accrual study extend DTG receive local ( country ) regulatory approval . Therefore , participant enrol study benefit treatment continue receive DTG local ( country ) regulatory approval commercial availability occur another source ( e.g . government program , aid program , assistance program , etc. ) . Participants enrol screening procedure complete . In case , Screening visit overlap participant 's penultimate visit parent study ( Week 180 P1093 ) . Participants meet entry criterion may enroll see clinic every 12 week safety evaluation receive DTG . It estimate 120 participant enrol study .</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Between &gt; =4 week &lt; 18 year age inclusive , Day 1 visit P1093 study . Subjects must previously participate P1093 study ( parent study ) least Week 180 evidence VF . Subjects must virological control define HIV1 ribonucleic acid ( RNA ) &lt; 400 copy per milliliter ( c/mL ) parent study penultimate P1093 visit ( Week 180 visit ) . If penultimate P1093 visit Week 180 visit indicate possibility VF , retest use confirm eligibility . Adherence issue address viral suppression must confirm prior Day 1 . Demonstrated ability willingness swallow assign dolutegravir ( DTG ) tablet ( subject require tablet ) . DTG 10 , 25 , 50 milligram ( mg ) tablet may crush dissolved . The 5 mg dispersible tablet may cut must use five milligram interval . Female subject child bear potential male subject engage sexual activity counsel safer sexual practice include use benefit/risk effective barrier method ( e.g . male condom ) risk HIV transmission uninfected partner . Male subject engage sexual activity could lead HIV1 transmission must use condom . Female subject child bear potential engage sexual activity could lead pregnancy , must use 2 adequate birth control method study 2 week stop study drug . Condoms recommend addition , appropriate use contraception method effective prevent HIV1 transmission . Parent , legal guardian subject &gt; =18 year age able willing provide sign informed consent include compliance requirement restriction list consent form protocol . Presence active AIDS defining opportunistic infection . Known &gt; =grade 3 laboratory toxicity prior study entry ( e.g . neutrophil count , hemoglobin , platelet , aspartate aminotransferase [ AST ] , aspartate aminotransferase [ ALT ] , lipase , serum creatinine total bilirubin ) . Repeat test allow eligibility determination . &gt; =grade 3 total bilirubin allowable , subject atazanavir ( ATV ) . Subjects laboratory abnormality consider unrelated DTG may allow enter study . Thus , laboratory abnormality persist upon repeat testing , subject may consider study entry consultation approval study team . Subjects permanently discontinue DTG parent study due intolerance pregnancy must include current program . The following liver toxicity within 30 day prior study entry : ALT &gt; 3 time upper limit normal ( ULN ) direct bilirubin &gt; 2 time ULN . Women pregnant plan become pregnant breastfeed study . Subject currently participate participate study compound device commercially available within 30 day sign informed consent , unless permission sponsor 's medical monitor grant . Presence history allergy/sensitivity study drug . Use disallow medication time screen . Subject unlikely adhere study procedure , keep appointment , plan relocate study . Clinical symptomatic evidence pancreatitis , determine clinician . Any condition ( include limit alcohol drug use ) would , opinion site investigator , place subject unacceptable risk injury render subject unable meet requirement protocol .</criteria>
