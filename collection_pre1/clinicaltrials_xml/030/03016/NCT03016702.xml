	<brief_summary>The purpose study test whether two new cognitive `` stress test '' may help distinguish people low higher genetic risk Alzheimer 's Disease . The investigator try understand cognitive `` stress test '' work people diagnose Alzheimer 's Disease exhibiting symptom Alzheimer 's Disease . Study subject undergo test memory executive function functional magnetic resonance image ( fMRI ) brain also walk test .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>The Cognitive Resilience Study</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The objective establish feasibility evaluate role two novel test cognitive resilience use identification early Alzheimer 's Disease . The investigator hypothesize exposure control stressor increase cognitive task demand evoke measurable phenotype poor resilience , associate Alzheimer 's Disease risk . The study include 30 volunteer participant Duke Alzheimer 's Disease Prevention Registry ( ADPR ) . The ADPR cohort characterize accord genetic risk base genotype locus associate Alzheimer 's Disease . The investigator recruit sample ADPR include 15 people `` genetic high risk '' group 15 people , match age , `` genetic low risk '' group . Investigators experimenter mask genetic profile participant . All participant undergo two cognitive stress test protocol . Both protocols include memory executive function component , one do functional MRI one ambulate force sensor mat . Both cognitive stress test minimal risk ; primary risk study loss confidentiality . Genetic testing perform part protocol ; sample strategy make use prior genetic testing result , reveal primary investigator . In addition determine whether score two novel test statistically differ AD risk group , project establish test ' feasibility characteristic use future study .</detailed_description>
