	<detailed_description>APROMISS phase 3 study evaluate safety efficacy AL3818 ( anlotinib ) hydrochloride treatment metastatic advance alveolar soft part sarcoma ( ASPS ) , leiomyosarcoma ( LMS ) , synovial sarcoma ( SS ) . Population pharmacokinetics exploratory exposure-response analysis also conduct subject receive AL3818 . Indication A : 53 subject metastatic advance ASPS amenable surgical resection receive open-label AL3818 dose 12 mg daily 21-day cycle ( 14 day treatment , 7 day treatment ) disease progression ( defined RECIST version 1.1 ) ot unacceptable toxicity . The primary endpoint objective response rate ( ORR ) , secondary endpoint duration response ( DOR ) . Indication B : 68 subject metastatic advance LMS fail least one prior line approve therapy enrol randomized 2:1 ratio receive either AL3818 ( 12 mg daily 21-day cycle ) IV dacarbazine disease progression ( defined RECIST version 1.1 ) unacceptable toxicity . Subjects randomize dacarbazine option crossover receive AL3818 time document disease progression . The primary endpoint progression free survival ( PFS ) , secondary endpoint objective response rate ( ORR ) overall survival ( OS ) . Indication C : 95 subject metastatic advance SS fail least one prior line approve therapy , include first-line anthracycline-containing chemotherapy , enrol randomized 2:1 ratio receive either AL3818 ( 12 mg daily 21-day cycle ) IV dacarbazine disease progression ( defined RECIST version 1.1 ) unacceptable toxicity . Subjects randomize dacarbazine option crossover receive AL3818 time document disease progression . The primary endpoint progression free survival ( PFS ) , secondary endpoint objective response rate ( ORR ) overall survival ( OS ) .</detailed_description>
