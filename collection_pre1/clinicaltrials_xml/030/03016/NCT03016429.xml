	<brief_summary>This protocol outline prospective study evaluate safety clinical outcome magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) examination perform patient cardiac implantable electrical device ( CIEDs ) include pacemaker ( PMs ) implantable cardioverter-defibrillators ( ICDs ) . This prospective study aim improve evidence base regard common clinical scenario . Specifically , investigator aim address whether result MRI PM/ICD patient affect physician decision making related clinical management strategy plan treatment intervention . Further , study evaluate whether result MRI patient affect patient outcomes related survival adverse event MRI scanning .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>MRI prefer image modality acute elective evaluation many condition . For example , many disease central nervous system , image modality provide requisite soft tissue resolution support critical care element neurosurgical plan assessment intracranial malignancy . Historically , MRIs consider contraindicated patient CIEDs include PMs ICDs . However , study demonstrate high utilization MRIs among patient eligible CIEDs . In many case , alternative imaging either insufficient , CT-myelography , pose substantial risk procedural hurdle may less favorable potential risk MRI . In recent year , grow literature suggest MRIs perform safely set CIEDs certain precaution take . Additionally , guidance document release professional society include American Heart Association ( AHA ) American College Radiology ( ACR ) outline recommend safety measure take minimize risk maximize benefit patient need image . However , few data perform MRIs pacemaker-dependent patient ICDs , exclude large publish study well MagnaSafe Registry . Thus , demonstrate safety clinical utility perform MRIs context high importance . In response urgent clinical consideration , Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center establish clinical protocol provide safe MRIs case compel clinical indication , close supervision oversight Radiology Cardiac Electrophysiology staff . Thus , investigator propose prospective study evaluate safety clinical outcome patient treat clinical protocol . Specifically , study proposes perform prospective clinical trial patient CIEDs clinical need MRI outpatients determine : 1 . Safety accord incidence rate acute major minor adverse event accord pre-specified definition . 2 . Clinical outcome scan utility affect patient ' survival quality life treatment , include acute longitudinal change device parameter , need system revision , proportion MRI finding influence clinical management include medical surgical intervention , diagnostic prognostic change .</detailed_description>
