	<brief_title>The Sinonasal Cavity Reservoir Upper Airway Bacterial Development</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The study microbial community dynamic critically important human health , include maintain restore healthy microbiome . Metagenomic study revolutionize microbiology address issue culture-independent manner , define essential role microbiota host development . The initial development gut microbiota begin utero strongly influenced exposure birth ( e.g . vaginal vs caesarean birth ) . The initial seed mother 's microflora ensue bacterial succession think critical long-term impact human health . Recent longitudinal study document gradual increase bacterial diversity , non-random community assembly , effect breast milk introduction table food , large taxonomic shift result antibiotic environmental stress occur infancy . Since perturbation early event link diabetes , cancer , mental health range malady , effort underway learn manipulation infant microbiome `` healthy '' state translate long-term clinical outcome . By contrast , little attention pay factor govern early-life development respiratory tract microbiota , include oral cavity . At birth , oral nasopharyngeal flora resemble maternal vaginal tract skin ( depend mode delivery ) . Preliminary datasets suggest first year life , airway microbiome evolves rich , adult-like microbial ecosystem . The keystone colonizer airways think condition subsequent colonization 600 specie , serve establish robust bacterial community characteristic human health . Other secondary colonizer frequently implicate oral respiratory infection , include chronic sinusitis , pneumonia , periodontal disease . As example , infant colonization Streptococcus pneumoniae important risk factor childhood middle ear disease . Early microbial community , therefore , represent major factor govern colonization airway pathogenic protective microbe infant microbiome development . Understanding acquisition infant airway microbial community factor alter composition critical promotion human health prevention airway diseases represent annual multi-billion dollar burden US healthcare system . While maternal-newborn exchange airway microbiota well-documented , study examine within-subject relationship among mouth , sinus , nasopharynx lung relative abundance bacterial taxon site . Recent evidence suggest oral cavity may serve reservoir pathogens trans-locate non-oral location ; oral-associated microbe infect body site evidence 16S sequencing . However , two caveat make bacterial metastasis controversial . First , oral bacteria locate solely mouth also find elsewhere airways make origin difficult establish . Thus , directionality microbial exchange airway niche space know . Secondly , 16S ribosomal RNA ( rRNA ) survey reveal bacterial composition genus phylum level , provide little information strain lineage , whether individual strain migrate site . These data critical promote development protective microbiota restrict growth recalcitrant pathogen . A complete understanding trafficking begin in-depth , strain-level survey bacterial community present airway niche shortly birth , development time . As step direction , Academic Health Center-sponsored study use metagenomic sequence assess exchange specific bacterial strain throughout upper airway . Our mouse study ( explain elsewhere ) complement study cystic fibrosis ( CF ) infant , represent unique population facilitate capture oral , sinonasal , lung microbiota first two year life . By use combination oral throat swab , together nasal suction mucus sample , metagenomic sequencing approach use characterize composition bacterial community anatomical site . Beginning birth , investigator collect time-series swab subject , monitor change development microbiota time . By , study illuminate airway traffic beneficial pathogenic microbe may represent essential pathophysiological step towards shift balance airway health disease . EXPERIMENTAL PLAN The development airway bacterial community monitor small CF patient cohort . Since CF infant monitor birth routinely sample airway microbiota routine outpatient visit part standard-of-care , represent unique population monitor bacterial trafficking oral , nasal lung cavity . All newborn University Minnesota ( UMN ) genetically screen . Those test positive CF confirm use pilocarpine sweat test . Positive subject ( 2 Cystic Fibrosis Transmembrane Conductance Regulator [ CFTR ] mutation ) sample participant ' visit CF treatment center ; average , infant see every month first 6 month , every month 1 year age , follow quarterly visit UMN CF Center ( accordance Cystic Fibrosis Foundation guideline ) . As part standard care , nasal sample collect suction visit . Nylon swab also use sample infant 's buccal mucosa . Oropharyngeal swab also obtain , consider accurate proxy low airway ( lung ) microbiomes . Based number CF newborn expect study period , investigator plan recruit 10 subject . From infant , 10 temporal swab collect airway site ( 10 infant x 10 swabs x 3 site = 300 sample ) . Swabs store saline , frozen -80C process parallel . DNA extract swab sample , sequence perform University Minnesota Genomics Center .</detailed_description>
