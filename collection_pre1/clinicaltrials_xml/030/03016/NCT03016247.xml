	<detailed_description>Background Adolescent obesity serious concern US , place young people risk multiple chronic condition . Family-based intervention effective challenge1 , adolescent ' trust parent diminish around age 14 result developmental brain changes2-4 . This distrust may thwart family-based weight self-management intervention ; therefore , study investigator assess effect build trust adolescent age 10-12 parent , alongside weight self-management skill . Trust reciprocal quality dyad cross cognitive , affective , behavioral domain consist honesty , receptivity disclosure , perceive compatibility one 's action word , result sense psychological safety criticism , embarrassment , harm.5 Because central role adolescent-parent social interactions/relationships , trust may key factor acquire sustain healthy behavior . Despite literature support importance interpersonal social interaction make behavior change1,6 , study date simultaneously examine biological behavioral pathways trust interpersonal interaction elicit behavior change . Thus , employ study design include basic research role trust putative intervention target behavior change context ongoing experimental clinical study test effect family trust-building behavioral intervention design reduce BMI overweight/obese adolescent . We posit adolescent-parent trust unique potentially important interpersonal communication putative target engage behavior change improve healthy eating , physical activity , sleep overweight/obese adolescent , turn reduce BMI . Research area cognitive processing identify two broad cortical neural network , Task Positive Network ( TPN ) , involve use skill , knowledge self-monitoring problem solve goal-directed action , Default Mode Network ( DMN ) , focus emotion-management , self-awareness relationship . Neural network activity consistently observable fMRI . These broad network tend antagonistic , one network activate , inhibit ; inhibition/activation two mode may important implication self-management effort , since individual efficiently adopt one mode—processing either tasks emotion -- give time.7,8 The Analytic v. Emotional network theory suggest flexible balanced activity mode optimal9-11 may modify learning/training , include practice meditation.12 In work one SMART Center Core leader 7,13 , Dr. Anthony Jack , fMRI reveal individual , present analytical ( mechanical ) problem , tend activate analytic processing deactivate empathic ( emotional ) processing . Conversely , present social problem , individual tend deactivate analytic processing pathway favor increased emotional processing . These compelling finding provide intrigue new way examine individual 's approach health behavior provide new view brain-behavior connection . Jack 's work 14,15 show `` coaching '' exert dose-dependent effect brain region associate motivation . In particular , focused training increase activity ventral-medial prefrontal cortex ( VMPFC leave side Figure 2 ) adjacent region sub-genual anterior cingulate nucleus accumbens . These region , part default mode network , implicate motivation . In addition identifying difference brain function connectivity,15 also examine structural change brain anatomy bring intervention . These hypothesize occur region functional changes.16,17 Prior study demonstrate residual activity DMN , performance task sub serve TPN , cause error lapse attention.18,19 On hand , DMN play key role social cognition motivation , specifically generation affective meaning 15,20,21 purpose life . A key hypothesis effective tuning DMN function essential effective TPN function , require successful self-management . Although neural cognitive capacity underlie self-management behavior may non-specific nature , identify key mechanism signature effective intervention well inform theoretical framework self-management science . Significance Our premise self-management intervention target analytic emotional component neurocognitive process effective help individual achieve self-management outcome . We use functional magnetic resonance imaging ( fMRI ) examine relationship two large-scale cortical network , default mode network ( DMN ) task positive network ( TPN ) , contribution behavior . Numerous study demonstrate network may suppress , measure task performance rest state , represent marker psychological health 22 . The investigator interpret finding ability flexibly move distinct cognitive mode associate network 13 . A key hypothesis effective tuning DMN function essential effective TPN function , turn , optimal performance self-management activity . We posit TRUST intervention influence adolescent 's emotional ( DMT ) neural process trust-building component , analytic ( TPN ) neural processing influence skill build component intervention , work together promote healthy weight self-management behavior 23 . In addition , investigator hypothesize TRUST intervention influence adolescent 's neurological reward activation social reward palatable food reward demonstrate ventral striatum 24,25 . As demonstrated model—consistent P30 Center Excellence Self-Management Research ( SMART ) framework use SMART Center studies—the investigator hypothesize adolescent 's weight self-management behavior influence ability individual balance DMT TPN neural processing . investigator posit reduction body mass index ( BMI ) improvement quality life ( QOL ) result weight self-management behavior ( eat , physical activity , sleep ) mediate two neural process ( DMT/TPN task-switching , reward activation ) , adolescent trust parent , parent trust adolescent , adolescent/parent relationship quality , social support , decision-making , self-efficacy , patient activation , self-regulation . The influence potential moderator ( gender , binge-eating , perceive stress , depressive symptom , executive functioning , parent style ) assess effect relationship intervention proximal distal outcome . The investigator conduct two-group intervention trial describe effect TRUST intervention BMI , QOL , cognitive task switch DMT TPN neural network . If finding confirm hypothesis , intervention serve model improve adolescent weight self-management behavior . The conduct project also provide invaluable insight neurocognitive underpinnings trust-building role facilitator adolescent weight self-management . Specifically , knowledge gain project provide foundational evidence trust-building primary relationship lead enhanced state self-management reward sensitivity . Improvements weight self-managements behavior show improve health outcome . Successful weight self-management behavior associate increased survival decrease morbidity . If successful , trust-building weight self-management provide acceptable feasible self-management intervention allow parent adolescent work together improve health well-being family . In general , potential benefit project outweigh potential risk , experience team investigator research staff prepare address minimal risk may occur . Purpose/Aims The purpose pilot study evaluate effect Trust-building weight Self-management Together ( TRUST ) intervention weight self-management behavior neural process overweight/obese adolescent . The aims two-group randomize trial : 1 . Compare effect TRUST intervention Enhanced Usual Care BMI QOL overweight/obese early adolescent ; 2 . Determine extent gender , binge-eating , perceive stress , depressive symptom , executive functioning , parent style moderate effect TRUST BMI QOL ; 3 . Compare effect TRUST intervention Enhanced Usual Care weight self-management behavior ( eat , physical activity , sleep ) ; 4 . Determine extent gender , binge-eating , perceive stress , depressive symptom , executive functioning , parent style moderate effect TRUST weight self-management behavior ( eat , physical activity , sleep ) ; 5 . Explore difference neural processing ( DMT/TPN task-switching , reward activation ) TRUST intervention Enhanced Usual Care group outcome .</detailed_description>
