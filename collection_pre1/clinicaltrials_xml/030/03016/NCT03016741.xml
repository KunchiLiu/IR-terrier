	<brief_summary>This clinical trial study cognitive function men prostate cancer treat androgen receptor direct therapy abiraterone acetate enzalutamide . The investigator use MRI imaging ( non-invasive , non-contrast ) see whether change brain structure activity relate treatment may relate change cognitive function . The investigator also look genetic variation might make patient less sensitive cognitive change treatment prostate cancer .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To compare cognitive function associate mediator cognitive function ( quality life , depression , pain , fatigue ) men metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer ( mCRPC ) treatment enzalutamide abiraterone acetate . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . To identify characteristic men mCRPC associate change cognitive function treatment androgen receptor ( AR ) direct therapy . II . To compare quality life associate factor , include fatigue , pain , depression , men mCRPC treatment enzalutamide abiraterone acetate . TERTIARY OBJECTIVES : I . To analyze whether single nucleotide polymorphism ( SNPs ) may associate change cognitive function treatment AR direct therapy . II . To compare functional structural component brain time brain men mCRPC treat enzalutamide abiraterone acetate use diffusion tensor imaging ( DTI ) , functional MRI ( fMRI ) , arterial spin labeling ( ASL ) , advance neuroimaging technique . OUTLINE : Treatment patient metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer randomize 1 2 arm . Control patient receive long term androgen deprivation therapy assess measure control arm . ARM I : Patients receive standard care treatment gonadotrophin release hormone ( GnRH ) agonist/antagonist therapy . Patients also receive abiraterone acetate orally ( PO ) prednisone PO twice daily ( BID ) absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . Patients undergo cognitive assessment comprise neuro-cognitive test assessment overall quality life , fatigue , pain , symptom baseline , 3 , 6 , 12 month . Patients also undergo MRI program 40 minute comprise DTI , fMRI , ASL MRI , Magnetization Prepared Rapid Gradient Echo ( MPRAGE ) MRI , Fluid attenuate Inversion Recovery ( FLAIR ) MRI , blood oxygenation level-dependent ( BOLD ) MRI baseline 3 month . ARM II : Patients receive standard care treatment GnRH agonist/antagonist therapy . Patients also receive enzalutamide PO QD absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . Patients undergo cognitive assessment MRI program Arm I . ARM III : Patients receive standard care treatment GnRH agonist/antagonist therapy undergo cognitive assessment MRI program Arm I .</detailed_description>
