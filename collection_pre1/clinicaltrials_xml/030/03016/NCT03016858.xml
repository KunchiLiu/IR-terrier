	<brief_summary>With development video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery ( VATS ) techniques technology anesthesia control , non-intubated anesthesia spontaneous ventilation widely apply VATS . A multicenter randomize parallel control study apply study assess feasibility safety thoracoscopic bullectomy surgery intravenous anesthesia spontaneous ventilation versus tracheal intubation general anesthesia .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Clinical Trial Thoracoscopic Bullectomy Surgery Under Spontaneous Ventilating Anesthesia</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Intubated anesthesia single lung mechanical ventilation ( IASLV ) consider standard care VATS . However , type anesthesia associate several adverse effect , trigger complication increase overall surgical risk . In order avoid intubated-anesthesia-related adverse effect , nonintubated strategy propose recent years.Encouraged satisfactory result preliminary experience nonintubated VATS , multicenter randomize parallel control study establish comparatively analyze outcome patient undergo either nonintubated intravenous anesthesia spontaneous ventilation ( NIIASV ) IASLV VATS thoracoscopic bullectomy surgery，especially safety operation , complication rate , muscle recovery surgery , difference postoperative hospitalization time .</detailed_description>
