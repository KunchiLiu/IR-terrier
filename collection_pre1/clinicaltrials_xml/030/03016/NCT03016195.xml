	<brief_summary>Oral sodium supplementation currently administer case poor weight gain infant particularly patient undergone gastrointestinal surgical procedure . The decision start oral supplementation base urinary sodium level although level start treatment variable range normal , healthy infant unknown . This study aim ascertain normal range sodium urine specimen collect healthy newborn baby . It believe increase level salt intestine , glucose easily absorb therefore weight gain improve . Babies condition risk salt depletion ( i.e . stoma ) currently administer oral sodium supplementation fail gain weight associate 'low ' urinary sodium level . Low level urinary sodium consider represent state low body sodium level , kidney attempt reabsorb sodium urine excrete . Current practice varies widely level treatment instigate . Some centre advise 20 mmol/L ( Birmingham Children 's Hospital Nottingham Children 's Hospital guideline ) , others 10 mmol/L ( University Children 's Hospital , Zurich ) . In Glasgow , baby poor weight gain give sodium supplementation urinary sodium level 40 mmol/L . There document range level urinary sodium healthy , newborn baby . By determine reference range urinary sodium level healthy , term baby gain weight appropriately , investigator hope able well understanding level supplementation consider target range aim .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Study design The study design cross sectional study participant detail record birth , follow second time point 6 week age correspond sample urine obtain . The population study healthy term ( 37-41 week gestation ) baby significant ante- post-natal history bear within study period single maternity unit . Participants require collect sample urine 6 week post-natal age ( provide standardize mean collect specimen ) return investigator pre-paid , pre-addressed envelope ( UN602 compliant packaging ) . This design choose obtain unbiased sample group , minimal inconvenience risk participant . All confound factor measure data-sheet accompany specimen ( sex , weight , method feed medication ) . The study susceptible bias perceive association participant either wish take part study subsequently choose collect return specimen , baby 's urinary sodium level . Prospective participant identify approached neonatal/maternity staff pre-discharge routine baby check ( see Inclusion/Exclusion criterion ) start date study period 3 month ( estimate base average newborn delivery per week expect return yield urinary sodium sample i.e . participant drop-out rate ) . There coercion participate . Mothers supply patient information statement inform consent obtain . The consent file mother 's medical note mean identification consent form link specimen obtain mother 's baby . Instead , generic form indicate intent participate study . If mother wish take part study , initial data-set obtain identify unique study participation number . This include sex baby , birth weight , intend method feeding/milk medication . A study pack issue contain set instruction outline study , gender-specific urine collection bag , specimen pot label participant 's unique identify number ( urine sample transfer prior return ) , data-set collection form pre-paid , pre-addressed envelope ( UN602 compliant packaging ) return specimen complete form . It make clear participant free withdraw study reason stage affect future care . No attempt make contact family sample return 6 week time period . There plan interim analysis . The study continue sufficient sample return order complete meaningful statistical analysis . It anticipate study last longer 3 month . Safety analysis Participation study deem involve risk patient , family staff involve . Sample size estimation 135 participant recruit 3 month . An independent statistician consult . The sample size reference limit base upon precision confidence interval around limit . On compute 95 % reference interval base normal distribution ( reference limit 15 % reference interval size ) give sample size 135 . A dropout rate least 25 % expect , therefore , order achieve adequate sample size , intend pause study 200 participant enrol . If less 135 sample return within 6 week final participant enrol , participant recruit achieve desire sample size . Sample analysis Urinary electrolytes measure Biochemistry laboratory Royal Hospital Sick Children . Urinary electrolyte ( potassium , sodium chloride ) measure in-direct ( dilute ) ion-selective electrode ( ISEs ) utilize membrane selective ion specie . A set volume urine ( 15 ul ) dilute diluent . A measuring electrode submerse solution . An electrical potential ( voltage ) develop across membrane reference measure electrode accordance Nernst equation . The measured voltage compare previously determine calibrator voltage convert ion concentration ( mmol/L ) . Following analysis sample dispose accordance Human Tissue Authority 's Code Practice . Statistical analysis The variation urinary sodium cohort present normal range . The urinary sodium child achieve satisfactory weight gain compare standard test ( long urinary sodium value normally distribute ) . Study closure The study end one follow criterion meet : - The planned sample size achieve - There insufficient funding support recruitment , reasonable prospect additional support obtain Ethical Consideration The study carry accordance World Medical Association Declaration Helsinki ( 1964 ) revision ( Tokyo [ 1975 ] , Venice [ 1983 ] , Hong Kong [ 1989 ] , South Africa [ 1996 ] Edinburgh [ 2000 ] ) . Favourable ethical opinion seek appropriate Research Ethics Committee ( REC ) patient enter study . Patients allow enter study either provide write informed consent next kin provide write informed consent . The Chief Investigator ( CI ) responsible update Ethics committee new information relate study . Finance indemnity This study currently sponsor . As study deem confer risk participant , family staff , indemnity seek . Dissemination result It intent researcher inform participant result study . Firstly , specimen collect analyzed study unidentifiable way contact take part research project . Secondly , question study design answer direct impact care participant . Instead , researcher aim present result specialty-specific conference ( e.g . British Association Paediatric Surgeons annual congress ) appropriate peer-reviewed journal , regardless outcome result .</detailed_description>
