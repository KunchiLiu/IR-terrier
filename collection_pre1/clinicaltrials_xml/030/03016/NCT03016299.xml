	<brief_summary>The subchondral bone , form subchondral bone plate subarticular spongiosa , play key role support articular cartilage . Marrow stimulation technique subchondral drill clinically important treatment option symptomatic small cartilage defect . However , The heat generate metal-bone interface drilling due friction cause thermal osteonecrosis . , recent clinical evidence suggest may induce alteration subchondral bone plate intralesional osteophyte , persist may play role degeneration repair tissue . Little known whether induce deleterious change Human Chondral &amp; Subchondral bone . The aim study compare condral &amp; Sub-chondral Histoligical damage induce different drilling technique . To best knowledge first time inspect , In- Situ , Human tissue .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>The Histological Effect Various Microfracture Techniques Human Chondral &amp; Sub-chondral Tissue - Ex-Vivo Study</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Chronic articular cartilage defect heal spontaneously . However , acute traumatic osteochondral lesion surgically inflicted lesion extend subchondral bone , spongialization , abrasion microfracture drill cause release pluripotent mesenchymal stem cell bone marrow , may heal repair tissue consist fibrous tissue , fibrocartilage hyaline-like cartilage . There Marrow stimulation technique subchondral drilling microfractures represent one frequently use method chondral osteochodral defect repair consider standard technique . [ 10-12 ] It 's well know logical understand high temperature around drill hole lead thermal injury . [ 1 ] Temperatures 47 C degree one minute associate thermal osteonecrosis [ 2,3 ] . The presence necrotic bone may delay heal predispose infection . [ 1 ] Many study evaluate thermal necrosis drill bone [ 3-6 ] . In case osteochondral lesion , drill injury area common practice orthopedics surgery knee , hip , talus others . In one study evaluate difference drilling microfractures impact cartilage heal reveal distinct difference microfracture drill acute subchondral bone structure osteocyte necrosis { 4 ] study evaluate heal difference drill bur rabbit knee , show degenerative change technique histology longer live repair cartilage 2 mm drill [ 5 ] The main objective study evaluate first time human , best knowledge , difference drilling KWires compare drill term thermal osteonecrosis histo-pathological damage . Methodes : The specimen achieve 2 group patient . The first group correspond traumatic subcapital fracture previous non hip pain complain No osteoarthritis change x-ray . The second group specimen achieve hip arthroplasty surgery due osteoarthritic change . The femoral head obtain surgery . Drill perform 3 contiguous area . First Area Nailing , Second KW drill 3rd area drill regular drill obtain triangle three drill epicenter . All test 2 different diameter - 3.5 mm &amp; 1.75mm . All 3 method check without cool - laviation saline drilling/nailing . Temperature measurement use Thermocouples 1 mm wire diameter use temperature measurement . Parameters Drilling speed , Drilling depth Orientation line sress- trabeculae- would uniform . Histological aspect : The specimen fix adequate amount buffer 4 % formalin 24 48 hour subsequent gentle decalcification ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid . Then , specimen cut strong knife/ scalpel parallel slice 3 5 mm thick wash run water 12 hour . And , section abnormal area , include articular surface submit paraffin embedding . The histological slide stain hematoxilin-eosin ( H &amp; E ) , PAS , Masson trichrome , Alcian blue . The lesion ( degeneration , hemorrhage , necrosis others ) measure micrometer microscope .</detailed_description>

The refusal patient use sample reason , include desire burying organ / tissue rheumatic autoimmune disease may affect hip joint ( eg : psoriasis , rheumatoid arthritis , stc ' ) Any chonic medication usage might affect bone cartilage ( eg : Bifosfantim , Alendronate , Risedronate , Ibandronate ) Any suspect pathology bone : malignancy , infection , Avascular Necrosis etc '</criteria>
