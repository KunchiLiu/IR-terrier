	<brief_title>Functional Electrical Stimulation ( FES ) Upper Extremity Hemiplegia Children With Cerebral Palsy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Functional electrical stimulation ( FES ) increasingly gain interest therapeutic intervention improvement motor function individual disability . FES involve administration electrical pulse stimulate motor neuron initiate muscle contraction , It use primarily individual spinal cord injury experience stroke leading loss decrease motor function limb . The repeated application FES affect limb show enable individual hemiplegia voluntarily control movement affect upper limb . A new FES system , recently develop indicated use improvement arm hand function patient hemiplegia due stroke spinal cord injury . FES non-invasive therapy involve transcutaneous delivery electrical stimulation affect upper limb , patient participation assistance therapist improve voluntary arm hand movement reach grasping . The new FES system show effectiveness adult acute stroke child chronic acquire stroke . In randomized controlled trial , FES pair intensive therapy compare intensive therapy alone show significantly improve hand function adult acute stroke . Participants trial limited mobility complete immobility affect arm receive FES pair intensive therapy clinically significant improvement hand movement compare receive intensive therapy . Recently , transcutaneous FES pair intensive hand therapy ( 3 one-hour session per week 16 week ) recently show improve hand function child chronic acquire stroke . The efficacy FES see patient stroke open possibility use similar population , include child hemiplegic cerebral palsy ( HCP ) . However , currently limit research efficacy FES population . In preliminary study , use FES alone treatment period 6 week child HCP show significantly improve wrist movement . However , research date effect FES child HCP focus gait lower limb function . There currently lack evidence effectiveness FES pair intensive therapy hand function child HCP . FES pair intensive therapy hold significant potential improve hand function child HCP warrant investigation . Therefore , propose research seek address two main objective : 1 . To investigate effectiveness FES improve upper limb function child HCP . 2 . To assess effect FES upper limb function child HCP six month post-intervention .</detailed_description>

No Botulinum toxin upper limb injection within 6months study entry , Constraintinduced movement therapy ( CIMT ) within 4 month study entry . Participants also refrain receive treatment throughout duration study . The participant 's forearm small accommodate standard FES electrodes . The participant 's muscle respond electrical stimulation test baseline assessment visit . Response electrical stimulation test baseline visit describe detail section entitle `` Muscle Responsiveness Testing '' . Based Muscle Responsiveness Testing procedure criterion , withdrawal criterion nonresponse electrical stimulation define : 1 . More 3 muscle group 11 respond FES 2 . The participant report discomfort level score 8 10 FACES scale ( Appendix A ) 11 muscle group . Participant receive active occupational therapy hemiplegic hand intervention FES intervention period . Participant attend less 36/48 FES intervention session . Participant develop newonset seizure FES intervention period .</criteria>
