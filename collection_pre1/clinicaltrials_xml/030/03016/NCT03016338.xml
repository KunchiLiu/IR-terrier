	<brief_summary>This phase 2 study investigational drug niraparib patient advanced/recurrent endometrial cancer . The purpose study determine whether block protein call poly ( ADP-ribose ) polymerase ( PARP ) niraparib provide clinical benefit patient recurrent endometrial cancer , well explore possible impact phosphatase tensin homolog ( PTEN ) loss ( loss function PTEN gene ) block PARP niraparib .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Study Niraparib Recurrent Endometrial Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The study first enroll patient recurrent endometrial cancer regardless PTEN status . If patient population meet criterion clinical efficacy , retrospective analysis PTEN status do study potentially continue focus participant PTEN loss . Participants screen eligibility standard safety test procedure within 28 day start study drug . Tests procedure do research purpose time include archival tumor tissue collection biomarker/genetic research include PTEN analysis , blood sample collection analysis even participant develops myelodysplastic syndrome ) MDS acute myeloid leukemia ( AML ) . Eligible participant take niraparib capsule tablet mouth , 300 mg , day , every day every 28 day cycle . While receive study treatment , participant ask visit study site Days 1 , 8 , 15 , 21 Cycle 1 , Days 1 15 Cycle 2 , Day 1 Cycle 3 future cycle safety test procedure . If , time , participant develop ( suspect develop ) MDS/AML , mandatory bone marrow aspirate/biopsy do test confirm diagnosis . When participant take study treatment permanently , ask return study site End Study Treatment visit test procedures do safety purpose . Participants take study treatment reason disease progression continue radiological assessment every 12 week disease progression . Participants continue follow side effect weekly first 4 week , monthly resolution .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Histologically confirm epithelial endometrial cancer . All histological subtypes allow except endometrial sarcoma , carcinosarcoma , clear cell , mixed adenosquamous tumor . Patients must radiographic evidence disease progression follow recent line treatment . Patients must previously receive least one line platinumbased chemotherapy . Prior hormonal immunotherapy allow . There restriction total number prior line therapy . Patients must measurable disease , define least one lesion accurately measure least one dimension ( long diameter record nonnodal lesion short axis nodal lesion ) ≥10 mm CT scan , MRI , caliper clinical exam , ≥15mm nodal lesion . Areas previous radiation may serve measurable disease unless evidence progression post radiation . Patients must archival tumor sample available PTEN analysis . If archival tissue available , patient option undergo tumor biopsy . Eastern Cooperative Group ( ECOG ) performance status ≤ 2 . Life expectancy great 12 week . Within 7 day propose start treatment , patient must normal organ marrow function . Chemotherapy biologic agent receive within 4 week start study treatment . Hormonal therapy within 2 week start study treatment . Pelvic radiotherapy ( treatment primary disease ) within 4 week , palliative radiotherapy encompass &gt; 20 % bone marrow within 1 week start study treatment . Previous treatment PARP inhibitor , target therapy direct homologous recombination pathway . Patients receive investigational agent . Ongoing ≥ Grade 2 toxicity relate prior cancer therapy , exception alopecia , neuropathy , lymphopenia skin depigmentation . Received transfusion ( platelet red blood cell ) ≤4 week first dose study treatment . Major surgery within 4 week registration ongoing clinically significant postsurgical complication . Study biopsy consider major surgery . Known brain metastasis , except stable great 28 day follow definitive treatment . The patient must new progressive sign symptom related CNS disease must either take stable dose corticosteroid . A scan confirm absence brain metastasis require . History myelodysplastic syndrome ( MDS ) /acute myeloid leukemia ( AML ) . History bowel obstruction within 3 month , reason prevent effective oral administration medication . Immunocompromised patient e.g . Human Immunodeficiency Virus ( HIV ) require treatment active Hepatitis B C. Prior splenectomy allow . Uncontrolled intercurrent illness . History malignancy ≤ 3 year prior registration exception ) conebiopsied situ carcinoma cervix uterus ; b ) basal squamous cell carcinoma skin . All second malignancy context discuss Principal Investigator .</criteria>
