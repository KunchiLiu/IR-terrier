	<brief_title>Enhanced Recovery After Surgery ( ERAS ) Laparoscopy-assisted Distal Gastrectomy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Preoperative education ERAS program administer ward admission specific team . Breathing train atomizing time preoperative preparation perform hospitalization ( 5-7 day ) . Patients allow eat normal diet intake 1000 ml 10 % carbohydrate drink 10 hour surgery oral 500ml 10 % carbohydrate drink 2 hour induction anesthesia . Mechanical bowel preparation recommend routine procedure . The intravenous fluid therapy restrict . Urinary catheter routinely place anesthesia . In principle , drainage nasogastric tube place ( except concern surgical safety ) . Surgical site infiltration implemented.All patient undergo laparoscopic distal gastrectomy . Urinary catheter routinely remove within 24 hour operation . An optimal management acute postoperative pain multimodal analgesia consist surgical site infiltration , nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug postoperative three day ( POD ) epidural analgesia . Adjunctive analgesia acetaminophen use resumption oral intake adequate pain relief . Patients encourage move POD 1 . The patient encourage full fluid diet POD 2 . Adhere premise eat little often daily increase , semi-fluids soft diet . A normal diet often start POD 4 . Abdominal drain routinely remove within 72 hour operation .</detailed_description>
