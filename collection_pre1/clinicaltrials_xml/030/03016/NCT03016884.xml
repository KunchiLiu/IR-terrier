	<brief_summary>The reactivation varicella zoster virus ( VZV ) ( herpes zoster ( HZ ) ) substantial public health concern . Updated ACR recommendation RA treatment suggest RA patient age ≥ 50 year vaccinate receive biologic tofacitinib therapy . The Investigators therefore propose prospective study evaluate safety , tolerability , immunogenicity zoster vaccine ( Zostavax ) patient RA , administer least 2 week prior initiation anti-TNF biologic tofacitinib therapy RA . This 6-week open-label prospective multi-center study evaluate safety , tolerability , immunogenicity Zostavax vaccine RA population prior initiation biologic/tofacitinib therapy RA . VZV-specific immune response vaccine RA patient compare healthy control subject ≥ 50 year immunized Zostavax .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Safety Tolerability Herpes Zoster Vaccine Patients Rheumatoid Arthritis Immunized prior biologics tofacitinib therapy initiation Background The reactivation varicella zoster virus ( VZV ) ( herpes zoster ( HZ ) ) substantial public health concern . Its predilection elderly immunosuppressed make important cause morbidity , cause pain , depression , long-term disability form post-herpetic neuralgia . The risk HZ increase 1.5 2 time patient rheumatoid arthritis ( RA ) compare general population.This increase attribute underlying disease process treatment RA , particular , corticosteroid , TNFα block agent , rituximab , tofacitinib . A live attenuated zoster vaccine , administer single subcutaneous injection , reduce HZ risk 70 % 51 % among immunocompetent individual 50 59 year 60 year old 2 randomize blind trial , respectively . Updated ACR recommendation RA treatment suggest RA patient age ≥ 50 year vaccinate receive biologic tofacitinib therapy . Yet , real world data prof minority RA patient initiate biologic therapy vaccinate herpes zoster . The safety concern individual may develop varicella infection vaccine virus strain . Recently , zoster vaccine safety , tolerability , immunogenicity prospectively test patient chronic low-medium dose corticosteroid therapy . Zoster vaccine generally well tolerate immunogenic patient population . Based VZV incubation period , first 42 day follow vaccination choose primary safety risk window Shingles Prevention Study , randomize blind trial precede FDA approval vaccine . The investigator therefore propose prospective study evaluate safety , tolerability , immunogenicity zoster vaccine ( Zostavax ) patient RA , administer least 2 week prior initiation anti-TNF biologic tofacitinib therapy RA . The study specifically focus zoster vaccine related adverse event , include injection site reaction , development zoster-like lesion , rate clinical herpes zoster . Study Objective : 1 . To evaluate rate adverse reaction , injection site reaction , development zoster-like lesion follow Zostavax administration . 2 . To evaluate rate clinical herpes zoster event initiation biologic small molecule therapy RA follow Zostavax administration . 3 . To evaluate immunogenicity Zostavax RA patient immunize 2 week prior biologic tofacitinib therapy . Study Design : This 6-week open-label prospective multi-center study evaluate safety , tolerability , immunogenicity Zostavax vaccine RA population prior initiation biologic/tofacitinib therapy RA . VZV-specific immune response vaccine RA patient compare healthy control subject ≥ 50 year immunized Zostavax . Healthy volunteer recruit hospital staff relatives patient agree participate studyNine Rheumatology Departments across Israel participate study . These center Tel Aviv Medical Center , Sheba Medical Center , Assaf Harofe Medical Center , Shaare Zedek Medical Center , Rabin Medical Center , Bnei Tsion Medical Center , Rambam MedicaL Center , Hahemek Medical center , Carmel Medical Center . Vaccine Information : ZOSTAVAX lyophilize preparation live , attenuate varicella-zoster virus ( Oka/Merck strain ) reconstitute sterile diluent give single dose suspension minimum 19,400 PFU ( plaque form unit ) store room temperature 30 minute . It administer single subcutaneous injection deltoid region upper arm . Study Visits : Screening Visit/Vaccination The study Investigator discus , subject , nature study , requirement , restriction . Written informed consent must obtain prior performance protocol specific procedure . Upon recruitment , patient examine treat rheumatologist , order verify diagnosis RA review pertinent vaccination medical history . Patients subsequently assess RA disease activity . Procedures perform screen period include : Informed Consent Confirmation RA diagnosis Classification RA : subject must score 6 great 2010 American College Rheumatology/European League Against Rheumatism classification criterion rheumatoid arthritis Medical History pertinent HZ vaccination include history prior concomitant medication , history prior episodes herpes zoster , zoster vaccine history . Assessment RA activity : Blood test ( ESR , CRP ) , varicella-zoster virus ( VZV ) antibody titer glycoprotein enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay ( gpELISA ) , ( carry centrally tel Aviv Sourasky medical center Immunology laboratory ) future analysis ( exclude genetic test ) . After screen , eligible patient provide informed consent , administer zoster vaccine . 2- week phone interview base follow up/ Biologic tofacitinib treatment initiation ( etanercept tofacitinib comprise 80 % total therapy ) At 2-week visit , vaccine safety assess . Following two-week interval zoster vaccine administration , biologic tofacitinib treatment initiate scheduled treating rheumatologist . Importantly , biologic treatment kind would provide study project . 4- week phone interview follow Vaccine safety adverse effect assessment . 6- week visit Vaccine safety adverse effect assessment . Assessment RA activity . Subject Withdrawal Subjects may withdraw study time request . Assessments : Assessment RA Disease Activity At study visit , patient subsequently assess RA disease activity Patient Assessment Arthritis Pain Patient Global Assessment Arthritis . Physician Global Assessment Arthritis Health Assessment Questionnaire - Disability Index ( HAQ-DI ) Safety Assessment Any adverse reactions/events follow zoster vaccine administration register assessed . Injection site adverse reaction : Local pain/erythema/swelling/pruritus/warmth/hematoma/induration Hypersensitivity Post vaccination non-injection-site zoster-like varicella-like rash Post vaccination herpes zoster occurrence Systemic adverse reaction Progression/worsening underlying disease Adverse effect define accord follow definition : MILD Does interfere subject 's usual function . MODERATE Interferes extent subject 's usual function . SEVERE Interferes significantly subject 's usual function . Blood test Samples 15 cc blood take two visit : pre-vaccination post-vaccination ( 6 week ) . VZV antibody titer measure commercially available ELISA kit . All data deidentified . Only principal investigator access table key link data set personally identifiable information . The study document keep locked department rheumatology .
