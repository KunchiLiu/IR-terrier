	<detailed_description>background Rationale : Autonomic dysfunction common complication stroke may lead poor rehabilitation outcome increase mortality . Although dysfunction common symptom stroke , acute phase chronic phase , specific therapeutic target yet . The severity autonomic dysfunction measure many way , common way assessment sympathetic-parasympathetic equilibrium heart rate variability analysis . It known plasticity brain influence autonomic nerve system provide appropriate stimulus encourages change . It find stimulation rhythm , stimulation cognitive task ( particular , stimulation executive function ) stimulation activity , influence autonomic nerve system healthy subject . Thus , ask integrate task ( activity , cognitive , rhythm ) may influence autonomic nervous system cause increase brain activity , therefore contribute rehabilitation stroke patient . Taken together , purpose study examine influence stimulation rapid slow rhythm , stimulation cognition cognitive task , stimulation activity pedal fitness bike combine stimulation , autonomic nerve system . This effect test measure heart rate variability chronic stroke patient control group equivalent age lifestyle . The Medical Device : Heart rate heart rate variability monitor Polar RS800CX watch ( PolarElectro OY , Kempele , Finland ( . A transmitter place patient 's chest collect data . This data store watch 's computer analyze specific Polar software ( Polar Protrainer 5 inc. ) . An appropriate filtration make preliminary study . Pedaling capability , RPM , collect cadence sensor Bluetooth smart . The Purpose Medical Research : The purpose study examine influence stimulation rapid slow rhythm , stimulation cognition cognitive task , stimulation activity pedal fitness bike combine stimulation , autonomic nerve system chronic stroke patient control group equivalent age lifestyle .</detailed_description>
