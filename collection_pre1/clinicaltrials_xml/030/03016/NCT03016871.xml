	<brief_summary>This phase II trial study side effect nivolumab see well work give together ifosfamide , carboplatin , etoposide treat patient Hodgkin lymphoma come back respond treatment . Monoclonal antibody , nivolumab , may interfere ability cancer cell grow spread . Drugs use chemotherapy , ifosfamide , carboplatin etoposide , work different way stop growth cancer cell , either kill cell , stop dividing , stop spread . Giving nivolumab , ifosfamide , carboplatin etoposide may work well treat patient Hodgkin lymphoma .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Nivolumab , Ifosfamide , Carboplatin , Etoposide Second-Line Therapy Treating Patients With Refractory Relapsed Hodgkin Lymphoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . Evaluate anti-tumor activity nivolumab single agent combination ifosfamide , carboplatin , etoposide ( ICE ) chemotherapy ( nivolumab [ N ] ICE ) assess complete response ( CR ) rate prior autologous hematopoietic cell transplantation . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I. Assess safety tolerability nivolumab +/- ICE chemotherapy evaluation toxicity , include type , frequency , severity , attribution , time course duration . II . Obtain estimate overall response rate ( ORR ) , response duration survival ( overall event-free ) . III . Summarize stem cell mobilization outcome ( e.g. , total CD34 ( cluster differentiation 34 ) + cell yield , number apheresis day , proportion patient achieve &gt; = 2 x 10^6 CD34+ cells/kg ) . IV . Evaluate Hodgkin lymphoma biological marker subject treat nivolumab . V. Among subject undergo autologous hematopoietic cell transplantation ( AHCT ) , estimate post-AHCT overall/progression free survival ( PFS ) probability cumulative incidence relapse/progression , non-relapse mortality ( NRM ) 100-days , 1-year 2-years . VI . Among subject undergo autologous hematopoietic cell transplantation ( AHCT ) , characterize post-AHCT toxicity first 30- 100- day post stem cell infusion type , frequency , severity , attribution , time course duration . VII . Among subject undergo autologous hematopoietic cell transplantation ( AHCT ) , evaluate short long-term post-AHCT complication , include : delay engraftment ( neutrophil platelet ) infection , graft versus host disease sinusoidal obstruction syndrome . TERTIARY OBJECTIVES : I . Collect deoxyribonucleic acid ( DNA ) /ribonucleic acid ( RNA ) lymphoma specimens serial plasma sample future biomarker evaluation . II . Evaluate potential change Hodgkin lymphoma biological marker patient treat nivolumab . OUTLINE : Patients receive nivolumab intravenously ( IV ) 30 minute day 1 . Courses repeat every 14 day 6 week absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . Patients CR partial response ( PR ) receive nivolumab additional 6 week . Patients stable disease ( SD ) progressive disease ( PD ) 6-week nivolumab treatment patient PR , SD , PD 12-week nivolumab treatment receive nivolumab IV 30 minute day 1 , etoposide IV day 1-3 , ifosfamide IV continuously 24 hour day 2 , carboplatin IV day 2 . Treatment repeat every 21 day 2 course absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . After completion study treatment , patient follow every 3 month 2 year .</detailed_description>
