	<brief_summary>This research study combine two different way fight disease : antibody T cell . Both antibody T cell use treat patient cancer . They show promise , neither alone sufficient cure patient . This study design combine T cell antibody order create effective treatment . The treatment research call autologous T lymphocyte chimeric antigen receptor cell target CD19 antigen ( ATLCAR.CD19 ) administration . In previous study , show new gene put T cell increase ability recognize kill cancer cell . The new gene put T cell study make piece antibody call anti-CD19 . This antibody stick leukemia cell substance outside cell call CD19 . For study , anti-CD19 antibody change instead float free blood part join T cell . When antibody join T cell way call chimeric receptor . These CD19 chimeric ( combination ) receptor-activated T cell seem kill tumor , last long body chance fight cancer unknown . Preliminary result show many subject receive treatment experience unwanted side effect include cytokine release syndrome . In study , help reduce cytokine release syndrome symptom , ATLCAR.CD19 cell safety switch active , cause cell become dormant . These modify ATLCAR.CD19 cell safety switch refer iC9-CAR19 cell . If subject experience moderate severe cytokine release syndrome result give iC9-CAR19 cell , subject may take part sub-study give second study drug , AP1903 . AP1903 activate iC9-CAR19 safety switch , reduce number iC9-CAR19 cell blood . The goal sub-study determine dose AP1903 give reduces severity cytokine release syndrome mild , still allow remain iC9-CAR19 cell effectively fight leukemia . The primary purpose study determine whether receive iC9-CAR19 cell safe tolerable determine optimal dose AP1903 give subject alleviate severe cytokine release syndrome .</brief_summary>
