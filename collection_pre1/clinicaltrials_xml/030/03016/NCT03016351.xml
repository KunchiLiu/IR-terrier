	<brief_summary>After participant meet inclusion exclusion criterion , randomize equally either Resistance Training group ( RT ) Aerobic Training group ( AT ) . Both group participate 8 week initial control period , follow 8 week supervise exercise training , follow 8 week deconditioning . All participant undergo assessment procedures one time prior initial 8 week control period , three period . Assessments include : blood draw ; arterial stiffness testing ; ultrasounds brachial artery measure flow-mediated dilation ( FMD ) ; gluteal adipose tissue biopsy ; exercise test determine VO2 max ; body composition analysis via DEXA scan ; ambulatory blood pressure measurement ; diet analysis via food journal ; medical history questionnaire ; urine analysis pregnancy ; activity monitoring via accelerometer . Total participation 24-26 week .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Study Design Procedures This study divide three separate 8-week period , Control period , Exercise Training period De-training period . A ) Control Period ( week 0-8 ) : Participants control period 8 week . Subjects give brochure regard benefit regular exercise nutrition overall health . Baseline visit eligibility assessment : After initial phone interview screen potential participant eligibility , participant schedule two visit baseline assessment . Visit 1 : Clinical Research Center , 2.5 hour visit Participants report morning 12 hour fast . Female participant follicular stage menstrual cycle . Everyone instructed drink water exercise day visit . After informed consent medical history obtain , follow procedure perform : - Urine pregnancy test woman - Anthropometrics : weight , height , waist circumference BMI - Vitals : Blood pressure heart rate - Blood draw approximately 2 tablespoon 30 mLs - Arterial stiffness test via pulse wave velocity : Sphygmocor ( SphygmoCor , AtCor Medical , Sydney , Australia ) device use detect stiffness blood vessel . 24 hour blood pressure monitoring . Participants ask wear blood pressure cuff arm , small monitoring record pack attach waist ( next bed sleep ) . The machine take blood pressure measurement every 30 minute awake every 30-60 minute sleep . They wear everywhere , except shower , full 24 hour . - Ultrasound brachial flow-mediated dilation administration nitroglycerin During procedure , EKG monitor ( limb lead ) . EKG recording make assess heart rate , gate subsequent measure diameter cardiac cycle . Arterial pressure monitor throughout protocol opposite arm use automated sphygmomanometry device . Visit 2 : Integrative Physiology Lab , 2 hour visit Participants report follow procedure : - Exercise testing : Maximal oxygen consumption evaluate use cycle ergometry treadmill exhaustion . We use graded exercise protocol , start easy level increase difficulty stage Participants connect breath breath metabolic system measurement VO2max . - Dual Energy X-ray Absorptiometry ( DEXA ) : DEXA provide precise non-invasive measure fat mass , lean tissue mass ( total body , well regional ) , bone mineral content bone mineral density . DEXA measurements participant 's total regional fat lean mass , bone mineral content bone mineral density do four time intervention . - Review food journal - Return 24-hour blood pressure cuff Begin 7 day activity monitoring accleerometer Participants report IPL 7 day return accelerometer . Participants ask maintain normal lifestyle study period , exception participate exercise training week 8-16 . Since sedentary subject recruit , anticipate difference group physical activity . To verify physical activity accelerometry ( GT3X ; ActiGraph ) use 7 consecutive day three period . B ) Pre-training Testing , Week 8 ( Pre-Exercise training period , week 9-16 ) : After 8 week control period , training begin , participant report two visit test , undergo follow procedure : Visit 1 : Clinical Research Center , 2.5 hour visit : Same Visit 1 procedure outline Baseline visit , include 12 hour fast . In addition participant also undergo : - Subcutaneous gluteal fat biopsy : All subject undergo subcutaneous fat biopsy sterile technique perform trained physician nurse practitioner intervention . A small fat biopsy obtain underneath skin . The skin locally anesthetize small amount lidocaine ( 2 % ) . The incision close Steristrips cover waterproof clear bandage . Since tissue relatively avascular obtain direct inspection , minimal risk bleed complication . The entire procedure take 10 minute associate minimal discomfort . Individuals instruct keep area dry 24-48 hour bandage remove . The Steristrips remain place spontaneously come 4-5 day . Visit 2 : Integrative Physiology Lab , 2 hour visit : Same Visit 2 procedure outline Baseline visit Randomization After participant meet inclusion exclusion criterion , randomize equally either Resistance Training group ( RT ) Aerobic Training group ( AT ) table random number staff member knowledge participant 's baseline profile . C ) Post training Testing , Week 16 ( pre-Detraining period , week 17-24 ) . The two visit post-training test start 24-48 hour last exercise session avoid potential effect acute exercise bout . This test identical testing occur begin Exercise training period Week 8 . De-Training Follow-up All participant ask resume normal activity 8-week exercise training program . They specifically instruct resume activity pattern enter study ( sedentary lifestyle ) , discontinue exercise training . D ) Post-detraining Testing : All procedure describe perform two visit day . Participants return accelerometer remain food journal .</detailed_description>
