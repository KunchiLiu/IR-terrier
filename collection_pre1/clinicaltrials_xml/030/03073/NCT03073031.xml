	<brief_title>The Use PatientReportedOutcomes ( PRO ) - CTCAE Melanoma Patients Receiving Immunotherapy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Hypothesis : - Melanoma patient report side effect immunotherapy use PRO-CTCAE ( Common Terminology Criteria Adverse Events ) experience overall reduction grade 3 4 event 50 % compare routine monitoring . Aim : - Primary endpoint : To examine electronic tool PRO-CTCAE use weekly basis patient receive immunotherapy supplement standard AE monitoring , result cut frequency grade 3 4 adverse event treatment 50 % compare patient get standard AE monitoring schedule every 3 week . - Secondary endpoint : 1 ) To examine time patient experience grade 2 high toxicity , differs two group 2 ) To examine symptom report intervention group 3 ) To examine difference 2 group come number extra out-patient visit , day hospital , telephone consultation day prednisone therapy 4 ) To examine PRO-CTCAE implementable daily practice ( explore study 2 3 ) . Method : All patient receive immunotherapy treatment malignant melanoma Department Oncology , Odense University Hospital ( OUH ) , ask participate . Patients meet eligibility criterion randomize 1:1 ratio either intervention arm ( use PRO-CTCAE ) control arm ( standard AE monitoring schedule ) . Approximately 70 patient arm . Inclusion take place September 2016 July 2018 . Patients intervention arm report event weekly first 12 week treatment . Clinical staff patient intervention arm receive instruction use Ambuflex system complete electronic PRO-CTCAE questionnaire ( patient ) include report daily practice ( clinical staff ) . Assistance clinical staff provide patient need . Moreover , hospital staff receive education write instruction handle weekly feedback form patient intervention arm . Evaluation : Studies show 16 % patient treated Pembrolizumab/Nivolumab experience grade 3 4 side effect treatment . When come Ipilimumab , number 27 % drug combine number high 55 % . It however adverse event patient report biochemical AEs deduct , estimate number suitable self-reporting follow : Pembrolizumab/Nivolumab 10 % , Ipilimumab 20 % , Combination therapy 40 % .The primary endpoint randomize trial reduce frequency grade 3 4 side effect 10 % 5 % pembrolizumab /Nivolumab , 20 % 10 % Ipilimumab 40 % 20 % combination theory . Realistically , 140 patient include course 2 year accord Danish Melanoma Group . A level significance 0.2 accept reach power 0.61 Pembrolizumab/Nivolumab , 0.80 Ipilimumab ) 0,96 combination therapy . These number acceptable due fact pilot study ; PRO-CTCAE use connection immunotherapy prior study project patient Denmark . Moreover , prioritize Department Oncology , OUH site , applicant make sure relevant patient recruit clinician constantly remind project . Also , applicant able teach patient clinician use tool . All , collection data easier high quality study conduct one site .</detailed_description>
