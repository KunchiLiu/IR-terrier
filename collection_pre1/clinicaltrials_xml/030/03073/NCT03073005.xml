	<brief_summary>This study evaluate performance curriculum use medical simulator train patient advanced heart failure caregiver master self-management ventricular assist device ( device implant heart help circulate blood ) . The investigator expect train improve self-management skill , reduce VAD-related infection re-hospitalizations . In addition provide innovative training patient caregiver , study advance knowledge effect simulation-based training patient self-management safety .</brief_summary>
