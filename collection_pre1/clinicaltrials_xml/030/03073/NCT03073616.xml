	<brief_title>Lung Ultrasound Postoperative Diagnosis Pneumothorax Children</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The Nuss procedure minimally invasive technique repair Pectus Excavatum ( MIRPE ) . Residual pneumothorax ( PNX ) report 50 % Nuss procedure . It consequence introduction scope bar pleural space consider minor complication due minimal clinical consequence . It routine practice confirm diagnosis PNX conventional chest X-Ray either operating room end thoracic surgery recovery room unit immediately surgery.However , anterior pneumothorax occur chest-X ray could able detect PNX . Nowadays lung ultrasound ( LUS ) allow bedside non-invasive evaluation patient ( sensitivity specificity 92 99 % respectively ) without exposure ionize radiation , perform quickly chest radiography therefore repeat several time without additional risk . The use LUS pediatric age group recent , become widely utilized neonatal pediatric respiratory disease . Bedside sonography diagnosis PNX well describe emergency trauma medicine literature result sensitive specific portable anteroposterior chest radiography . Although study describe use ultrasound detection surgical pneumothorax , none study use Nuss Procedure .</detailed_description>
