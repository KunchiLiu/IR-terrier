	<brief_summary>MI elderly woman seem share pathophysiology men , especially plaque rupture associate conventional risk factor . Therefore question solve pathophysiology specific risk factor young woman whose prognosis severe . A complete descriptive analysis appear mandatory understand peculiarity , include morphological also biological exploration well . To date systematic descriptive analysis perform include clinical characteristic , cardiac extra-cardiac morphological exploration hormonal immunological assay , particularly young premenopausal woman present MI . This study provide first time complete analysis , include hormonal assay , never make `` acute '' population . The main objective clinical study systematically pool clinical , morphological biological data young woman ( &lt; 50 year ) present Acute MI ass short-term ( in-hospital ) mid-term ( 12 month ) prognosis . The definition MI one adopt Third definition publish 2012 . As event occur young patient , diagnostic treatment may vary among centre . The incidence case centre low practice inhomogeneous , conclusion could advance concern study associate , indeed predispose factor . The work aim comprehensively systematically collect clinical laboratory data result morphological exploration carry care young woman admit acute MI high-volume centre . No additional invasive act , without direct benefit care patient realize research purpose . All examination , particular invasive morphological , integrate practice modern interventional cardiology especially complex infrequent situation , like set . They afford accurate diagnosis coronary disease one hand second hand determine causal least participating factor . A comprehensive systematic analysis particular entity MI young woman , would improve knowledge disease enable offer patient appropriate treatment monitoring . It necessary progress understand mechanism early onset coronary artery disease acute serious presentation clearly define specificity coronary disease young woman . Moreover , precise identification risk factor MI woman 50 allow well screen even introduction preventive strategy .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>WAMIF : Young Women Presenting Acute Myocardial Infarction France</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Cardiovascular disease lead cause death among woman France . In-hospital mortality acute coronary syndrome ( ACS ) remain significantly high men , relative risk 150 % , especially among young women1,2 . Early mortality rate myocardial infarction ( MI ) continue decline woman remain high . Background The risk ACS increase age , especially menopause presence classic cardiovascular risk factor hypertension diabetes . Nevertheless premenopausal woman present MI exceptional even absence risk factor . The bad prognosis woman , particularly individual 50 year could result combination harsher clinical presentation , le typical symptom , delayed diagnosis . Moreover , uncommon ACS occur young woman without usual risk factor . Hormonal change particular related contraceptive treatment incriminate , likewise chronic inflammation relate systemic disease . To date impact hormonal , inflammatory thrombophilia change elucidate . Nowadays use endovascular image diagnostic coronary angiography become common practice particular absence obvious culprit thrombotic obstructive lesion . These invasive imaging technique intravascular ultrasound ( IVUS ) OCT ( Optical Coherence Tomography ) , bring highly relevant complementary information setting , particularly clarify mechanism MI rupture erosion atherosclerotic plaque , spontaneous dissection intramural hematoma . The incidence particular form acute coronary artery lesion higher woman , especially among young one . In young , angioCT angioMRI ( aortic and/or cerebral ) often perform look atherosclerotic risk location morphological abnormality favour particular disease fibrodysplasia . PET scan ( 18FDGlusose scintigraphy ) , available , provide valuable complement : functional imaging research arterial location hypermetabolic inflammatory arteritis . Usual laboratory test make admission discharge do routine practice . These test include blood count , electrolytes , blood urea , creatinine , prothrombin time , activate partial thromboplastin time , glucose , HbA1C , lipide profil , hemoglobin electrophoresis , CRP , fibrinogen . Moreover test recommend case ACS young patient make systematically . It objective work make comprehensive systematic analyse . Some assay require special technique , avoid variability therefore bias interpretation result , , preparation sample original department , centralize : homocysteine , marker thrombophilia hormone assay . Individually , marker associate presence progression atheroma . However , assay rarely make comprehensively systematically study population young woman present MI . Moreover long accepted woman less expose men risk cardiovascular disease due protective role oestrogen . However assumption question recent work hormonal treatment menopause . The administration oestrogen prevent ischemic arterial disease postmenopausal woman may even deleterious old woman . Then appear crucial analyse hormone level acute phase MI order progress understand hormonal role ACS , far never make context . Study design This prospective multicentric observational clinical study . All woman 50 year admit one 32 participating centre , acute MI , without ST segment elevation , include . Experimental plan - For woman admit acute MI without ST segment elevation investigation centre , participation study propose . - Coronary angiography perform emergency admission accord current guideline case STEMI . In case NSTEMI , patient benefit coronary angiography accord define risk stratification . - An IVUS image do center practice technique , data collect part study . This imaging perform possible initial coronary angiography order objectify intraluminal thrombus , plaque rupture , hematoma spontaneous dissection . This diagnostic strategy carry common practice participate center atypical situation , particularly absence obstructive lesion visible thrombus angiography . OCT may carry second step mechanical and/or pharmacological thrombectomy order improve sensitivity . - Participation study propose agreement sign discharge . - In center perform cardiac MRI , MRI data collect part study . Cardiac MRI do early coronary angiography hospitalization . - The usual blood test perform patient 's admission repeat least 24 hour coronary angiography , include repeat sampling assay troponin , order measure peak , follow routine department - The specific assay , correspond test carry part WAMIF study sample discharge . - During one blood sample 5 ml sample blood make later analysis context serum bank . - Some assay , include hormonal thrombophilia centralize order standardize result interpretation - A second angiography associate challenge test Methergin® plan , discretion refer cardiologist , within 5 day index event . This test especially recommend etiology find OCT MRI order diagnose spastic angina . The test perform coronary angiography intravenous injection 0.4 mg Methergin® ( méthylergotamine ) follow control angiography 3 minute follow test intracoronary injection nitrate . - All data collect locally help clinical study technicians WAMIF study - All biological data pool analyzed IVS - The data management perform clinical research assistant SFC - A telephone interview conduct 12 month collect major cardiovascular event ( death cause , cardiovascular death , recurrent MI , stent thrombosis , stroke major bleeding ) . These event specify hospital report . Total study duration : 18 month + follow 12 month : 30 month Inclusion period : 18 month Duration participation one patient : 12 month Number participate center : 32 Average number inclusion per month per center : 0.5 1</detailed_description>
