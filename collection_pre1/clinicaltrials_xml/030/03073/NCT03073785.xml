	<brief_summary>This randomized phase II trial study well hypofractionated stereotactic body radiation therapy fluorouracil capecitabine without zoledronic acid work treat patient pancreatic cancer spread start nearby tissue lymph node . Hypofractionated stereotactic body radiation therapy specialize radiation therapy send high dos x-rays short period time directly tumor use small dos several day may cause less damage normal tissue . Drugs use chemotherapy , fluorouracil capecitabine , work different way stop growth tumor cell , either kill cell , stop dividing , stop spread . Zoledronic acid use cancer patient reduce cancer symptom may make tumor cell sensitive radiation . Giving hypofractionated stereotactic body radiation therapy fluorouracil capecitabine without zoledronic acid may work well treat patient pancreatic cancer .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To evaluate efficacy hypofractionated radiation therapy concurrently zoledronic acid ( Zometa ) . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . To examine toxicity Zometa use concurrently hypofractionated radiation therapy . II . To evaluate local failure-free survival overall survival , surgical resection rate tumor response rate . TERTIARY OBJECTIVES : I . To quantify amplitude expression gene involve cholesterol biosynthesis ( ACAT2 , DHCR7 , ELFN2 , FASN , SC4MOL , SQLE ) pancreatic tumor tissue prior follow Zometa radiation therapy pancreatic cancer tissue available . II . To measure Zometa pharmacokinetics steady-state . III . To evaluate tumor organ motion 4 dimension ( D ) compute tomography ( CT ) respiratory gate system evaluate effect tumor/organ motion dosimetry , local control survival . OUTLINE : Patients randomize 1 2 arm . ARM A : Patients undergo hypofractionated stereotactic body radiation therapy 5 fraction day 1-5 . Patients receive fluorouracil intravenously ( IV ) 24 hour day 1 weekly 4 week capecitabine orally ( PO ) every 12 hour 5 day per week start evening day 1 radiation therapy 4 week per standard care . Patients undergo surgery 6-8 week completion radiation therapy . ARM B : Patients receive zoledronic acid IV le 15 minute 1 week prior radiation therapy.Patients undergo hypofractionated stereotactic body radiation therapy receive treatment fluorouracil IV capecitabine PO Arm A . Patients undergo surgery 6-8 week completion radiation therapy . After completion study treatment , patient follow 30 day , every 3 month first year , every 4 month second year , every 6 month thereafter .</detailed_description>
