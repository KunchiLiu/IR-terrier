	<brief_title>The Boston Circulatory Arrest Study : Antecedents Correlates Well-Being Adults With Congenital Heart Disease</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Previously lethal , critical congenital heart disease ( CHD ) treat effectively surgical , catheter , medical intervention . The result dramatic improvement life expectancy bring major demographic shift , adult patient CHD outnumber child CHD , even complex condition . Adult survivor increase risk anxiety , depression , social difficulty , low educational attainment , underemployment . These psychosocial morbidity may associate deficit executive function ( EFs ) neurocognitive ability prevalent child adolescent CHD . Deficits EFs , represent measure inhibitory control , work memory , cognitive flexibility , decision-making , highly dependent integrity cortical subcortical neural network continue develop early adulthood major adverse impact self-regulation management . The goal proposal bridge gap knowledge know executive function deficit childhood CHD adult well-being . The investigator propose accomplish goal study subject , age 24-29 year , enrol infant Boston Circulatory Arrest Study study respect neuropsychological developmental function age 1 , 2.5 , 4 , 8 , 16 year , well brain MRI 16 year . In Aim 1 , relationship EFs major dimension adult well-being explore . It hypothesize low performance EFs relate poor overall well-being . The outcome measure determine well-being quality life , neuropsychological function ( e.g . social cognition , memory skill ) , mental health diagnosis function ( e.g . anxiety , depression ) , social relatedness , academic achievement , adult independence ( e.g . employment status , medical follow ) . In Aim 2 , relationship EFs MRI-derived measure brain structure , function , connectivity determine . It hypothesize low performance EFs associate low global efficiency ( integration ) high modularity ( segregation ) . The brain MRI outcomes measure use global white matter connectivity , regional cortical gray matter thickness , gray matter connectivity measure interregional correlation cortical thickness , functional connectivity define rest state functional magnetic resonance imaging . In Aim 3 , longitudinal model use analyze association adult well-being early measure EFs neurocognitive mental health variable , well earlier clinical variable adolescent neuroimaging . The association adult well-being dimension childhood adolescent EFs , measure mental health cognitive function , adolescent brain MRI finding , clinical variable explore . The ultimate goal identify early , modifiable risk factor adult performance guide design target treatment strategy optimize educational achievement , employability , quality life burgeon population adult CHD .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Study Group : Inclusion Criteria 1 . Prior participation Boston Circulatory Arrest Study 2 . Informed consent Exclusion Criteria 1 . Disorders would prevent successful completion plan study test ( severe developmental impairment prevent answer survey participate interview ) 2 . Participants lack read fluency English , language ability neuropsychology test , questionnaire validate 3 . Women currently pregnant exclude MRI portion study Control Group : Control Inclusion Criteria 1 . Age 2430 year time enrollment 2 . Informed consent Control Exclusion Criteria 1 . Conditions would prevent successful completion plan study test ( MRI ) ( e.g. , pacemaker , metal implant , orthodontia ) 2 . Congenital heart disease require surgical correction 3 . Lack read fluency English , language questionnaire validate 4 . Because purposefully wish compare dTGA patient optimal neurodevelopmental health , use exclusion criterion NIHfunded project , `` MRI study normal brain development . '' 5 .
