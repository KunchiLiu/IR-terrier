	<brief_title>Comparing Cytoreductive Surgery Hyperthermic Intraperitoneal Chemotherapy ( CRS-HIPEC ) Using Mitomycin-C Versus Melphalan Colorectal Peritoneal Carcinomatosis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>BACKGROUND : Peritoneal dissemination cancer ( peritoneal carcinomatosis ) gastrointestinal malignancy , mean tumor deposit along inside abdominal pelvic wall surface intestine organ , historically consider terminal disease . Although peritoneal surface tumor respond systemic therapy sole form treatment , patient survival remain poor cure consider impossible . A plasma-peritoneal barrier make systemic therapy relatively ineffective peritoneal surface disease . In 1990 's , cytoreductive surgery hyperthermic intraperitoneal therapy ( CRS-HIPEC ) begin popularized effective treatment . Hyperthermic intraperitoneal chemotherapy several advantage . High-dose chemotherapy use due plasma-peritoneal barrier result little absorption blood stream . Hyperthermia cytotoxic effect increase depth tumor penetration chemotherapeutic agent 3 mm moreover potentiate antineoplastic effect . Although CRS-HIPEC consider standard treatment rupture appendiceal neoplasms primary peritoneal mesothelioma , past decade indication broaden peritoneal surface malignant process . Historically , morbidity mortality associate CRS-HIPEC considerably high complex operation , thus use often discourage . However , recent time , especially high-volume center , morbidity mortality drastically improve . Due recent improvement mortality major surgical intervention , include HIPEC , focus shift toward endpoint besides efficacy , morbidity , quality life cost . While HIPEC universally felt vital component cytoreductive surgery , lack consensus optimal regimen , especially chemotherapeutic agent use . In United States , commonly use agent HIPEC mitomycin-C , however , remain unknown mitomycin-C optimal drug use regard toxicity survival . Randomized prospective study need compare toxicity effectiveness HIPEC mitomycin-C agent . OBJECTIVE : To compare morbidity mortality CRS-HIPEC utilizing mitomycin-C versus melphalan . METHODS : In study , patient randomize one two treatment arm : Arm 1 . ) Mitomycin-C initial dose 15 mg/m2 , 45 minute perfusion maintenance dose 5 mg/m2 administer ; Arm 2 ) : Melphalan 60 mg/m2 45 minute perfusion . Morbidity measure immediate short-term surgical recovery ( 90 day post-hospital discharge ) . Mortality measure begin date surgery end date participant death .</detailed_description>

If participant remove study , PI / surgeon decide standard care surgery proceed . Age 18 75 ECOG ( Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group ) Score 0 2 Recorded ASA ( American Society Anesthesiologist Classification ) classification determine anesthesiologist ( particular value require record classification require ) . Medically fit undergo complex major abdominal surgery , determine examination PI / SubIs . Medically fit receive systemic chemotherapy , determine examination PI / SubIs . Adequate organ marrow function define : leukocyte ≥ 3,000/mcL ( microliter ) absolute neutrophil count ≥ 1,500/mcL platelet ≥ 100,000/mcL total bilirubin within normal institutional limit AST ( Aspartate aminotransferase ) ( SGOT [ Serum Glutamic Oxaloacetic Transaminase ] ) ≤ 2.5 X institutional upper limit normal ALT ( Alanine Aminotransferase ) ( SPGT [ Serum Glutamic Pyruvic Transaminase ] ) ≤ 2.5 X institutional upper limit normal creatinine within normal institutional limit Women childbearing potential men partner childbearing potential must agree use adequate contraception ( hormonal barrier method birth control ; abstinence ) prior study entry , duration study participation , 90 day follow completion therapy . Should woman become pregnant suspect pregnant participating study , inform treat physician immediately . A woman childbearing potential female ( regardless sexual orientation , undergone tubal ligation , remain celibate choice ) meet follow criterion : Has undergone hysterectomy bilateral oophorectomy ; Has naturally postmenopausal least 12 consecutive month ( i.e. , menses time precede 12 consecutive month ) Men childbearing potential must donate sperm study 90 day study treatment ( surgery HIPEC ) . Exclusion Criteria Participants meeting exclusion criterion baseline exclude study participation . Current anticipated use investigational agent participate study . Patient receive systemic chemotherapy radiotherapy within 4 week prior study enrollment . Patient recover sufficiently ( PI judge patient recovery status ) adverse event due agent administer 4 week prior enrollment study . Patient history currently nonperitoneal surface metastatic disease addition peritoneal surface malignancy . History allergic reaction attribute compound similar chemical biologic composition mitomycinC melphalan . Uncontrolled intercurrent illness include , limited , ongoing active infection , symptomatic congestive heart failure , unstable angina pectoris , lifethreatening cardiac arrhythmia , severe pulmonary disease , uncontrolled diabetes , severe kidney disease psychiatric illness/social situation would limit compliance study requirement . Pregnant nursing . There potential congenital abnormality regimen harm nursing infant . Patient actively treat malignancy ( current active treatment early stage squamous basal cell carcinoma skin allow , exclude treatment investigational agent systemic chemotherapy radiotherapy ) .</criteria>
