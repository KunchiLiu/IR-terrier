	<brief_title>PREPARE , Prematurity Reduction Pre-eclampsia Care</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This proposal ( PREPARE ) , lead Brazilian investigator collaboration Global Pregnancy Collaboration ( CoLab ) centre 7 hospital centre 23 satellite community health centre ( UBSs ) . There two clinical initiative : First , programme systematic knowledge transfer ( KT ) encourage adoption WHO Guidelines prevent pre-eclampsia part routine antenatal care ( Objective 1 ) ; second intervention reduce unnecessary preterm delivery management pre-eclampsia . CoLab investigator develop method identify woman preterm pre-eclampsia whose pregnancy safely prolonged.4-6 In Objective 2.1 , method apply woman present definite suspect pre-eclampsia &lt; 37 week ' gestation . Investigators determine likelihood imminent adverse outcome woman use Soluble fms-Like Tyrosine Kinase-1-to-Placental Growth Factor Ratio ( sFlT-1/PlGF ) measurement fullPIERS clinical assessment . Prior study approach indicate 98 % negative predictive value adverse outcomes both.4-6 Investigators delay delivery whose risk low , care patient accordance evidence-based WHO guidelines.Unlike medication , management test blinded way . Management need integrated skill commitment caregiver . Hence , standard randomize controlled trial inappropriate . Instead investigator propose Stepped Wedge Design study outcomes 7 geographically diverse study centre , throughout Brazil . At least 6 woman preterm pre-eclampsia deliver centre every month . The primary outcome lower rate PRETERM BIRTH due pre-eclampsia proportion total delivery centre ( ) implementation plan compare prior introduction . The study 80 % power demonstrate 25 % reduction ( 2.0 - 1.5 % ) . Investigators assess maternal foetal adverse event secondary outcome . Objective 2.2 institute intense program knowledge transfer implement new management technique . In Objectives 2.3 2.4 determine patient provider satisfaction economic impact care plan . In Objective 3 establish biobank database begin assess demographic factor biological analytes may help identify unique predictive diagnostic/pathophysiological feature pre-eclampsia Brazilian population ( may extend low middle income country ( LMIC ) ) . For two year routine visit ( â‰¤16 week , 28-32 week ) UBS , relevant data plasma , serum , urine DNA sample store appropriate standard biorepository ( least 7000 case ) . Investigators estimate acquire sample delivery least 5000 woman . For four year , biological sample woman pre-eclampsia adverse outcome 2 match control collect admission labour ( additional 3,000 subject ) . Objective 4 initiate pilot study identify novel biomarkers , compare know pathophysiological factor LMIC ( Africa , India ) HIC use sample CoLab . Additional funding seek expansion validation ( e.g . Merck Mothers ) . Investigators also seek funding address risk stratification apparently low risk woman , base sample collect 28-32 week . Objective 5 promote intellectual interaction collaboration seven centre CoLab . Ability understand cure complex adverse pregnancy outcome lead acute long-range disability child require intensive collaboration across usual `` silo '' include hospital nation . The coordinator anticipate interaction investigator care provider seven centre foster intellectual collaboration improve standardized care . Brazilian investigator become member CoLab , increase unique vision , expertise resource ( current data biological material 28 centre ) . worldwide ) .</detailed_description>
