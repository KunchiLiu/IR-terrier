	<brief_title>Effect Expiratory Positive Pressure Dynamic Hyperinflation Ability Exercise With Upper Limbs COPD</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The study develop project aim evaluate effect positive airway expiratory pressure ( EPAP ) upper limb exercise-induced dynamic hyperinflation ( DH ) patient chronic obstructive pulmonary disease ( COPD ) . To end , cross-over study implement , develop Pulmonology Department Hospital de Cl√≠nicas de Porto Alegre . Patients moderate severe , clinically stable COPD evaluate . The anthropometric data pulmonary function collect medical record , study divide two stage . First stage : At first visit , dyspnea , quality life evaluate maximal incremental cardiopulmonary exercise test ( CPET ) upper limb DH evaluation exercise . Patients present DH incremental CPET invite return second third visit . In second third visit endurance test perform 80 % load reach incremental CPET DH determination , one test perform application EPAP face mask pressure level Of 10 cmH2O another usual breathing , mask without use positive pressure generate valve . The sequence test , ie , without EPAP , obtain electronic randomization . Patients complete stage 1 invited enter step 2 . In step , occur single visit , patient perform 6-minute pegboard ring test ( 6PBRT ) The monitoring CPET three different situation , accord randomization : habitual breathing , half-closed lip breathing ( RLS ) EPAP mask . Thus , expect application EPAP face mask use RLS reduce DH submaximal exercise upper limb , associate reduction dyspnea increase tolerance exercise COPD patient .</detailed_description>
