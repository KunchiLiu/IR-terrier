	<detailed_description>Acetylcholinesterase inhibitor ( AChE-I ) comprise major class drug use treat Alzheimer 's disease ( AD ) . Despite widespread use , controversy usefulness medication . Concerns modest response rate treat versus placebo group , relatively small effect size respect efficacy , drug cost , clinical relevance effect . One problem measure efficacy use may sufficiently sensitive detect true drug effect . Another problem change note 4-6 month therapy confound drug effect natural progression disease . Lastly , patient heterogeneity may contribute wide range degree response , decrease overall effect size . The investigator address three important issue improve clinical usefulness cholinergic therapy . First , outcome measure need sensitive effect cholinergic treatment . Second , outcome measure sensitive drug effect early course treatment measurable decline disease progression occur . Third , improve treatment would attain specific patient characteristic performance measure identify , contribute , even predict likely benefit . The premise current proposal measure higher-order attention - currently omit standard assessment treatment outcome - provide insight early efficacy cholinergic treatment . The investigator conduct preliminary study support hypotheses test value attentional measure . The rationale use attentional measure follow : ( 1 ) Attentional deficit recognize critical cognitive change early phase AD ; ( 2 ) Attentional function , particularly tasks tax available attentional capacity , mediate cholinergic system ; ( 3 ) Acetylcholine deplete AD . However , link attention cholinergic depletion AD fully explore , particularly regard response cholinergic treatment . Surprisingly , attentional measure include evaluation AChE-I treatment AD . The investigator propose attentional performance could serve highly sensitive outcome measure marker response . Study aim hypotheses 1 . To determine higher-order attentional measure sensitive effect cholinergic change early course treatment . The investigator predict performance attentional task improve AChE-I treated patient compare placebo control 7±1 week treatment . 2 . 2a . To examine effect cholinergic treatment attentional measure compare global measure measure cognitive domain . The investigator predict performance task attention sensitive traditional global measure performance . 2b . To examine whether cholinergic treatment change relationships among measure attention measure cognitive function . The prediction relationship among attention cognitive domain measure change treatment . 3 . To determine whether performance 7±1 week predict response 6 month 3a . Patient response AChE-I may influence demographic variable , influence performance one cognitive domain . The aim determine cognitive domain demographic characteristic best predicts treatment response six month . It hypothesize attention memory ( mediate cholinergic mechanism ) best predict treatment response see six month . 3b . To determine whether attentional change see patient early treatment course predict drug response . It hypothesize change attention measure baseline 7±1 week predict overall improvement patient show positive treatment response six month . Knowledge gain project facilitate inform decision individual patient undergoing pharmacological treatment . The application goal apply current AChE-I treatment well treatment , involve combine cholinergic glutaminergic agent . BACKGROUND AND SIGNIFICANCE Attention Alzheimer 's disease ( AD ) : The vulnerability higher-order attention task AD occur task selective attention , covert orienting . Attentional deficit document patient prodromal AD later develop disease , suggest potential sensitivity attention disease onset . Mechanisms attention mediate via anterior executive control ( require conjunctive search inhibitory control ) via posterior disengagement . The deficit AD may explain regional frontal posterior dysfunction , disconnection frontal posterior attentional network disrupt feedback system . Acetylcholine attention : A primary modulator attention acetylcholine ( ACh ) . Decreased ACh impairs attentional function animal human include vigilance rat , covert orient primate AD , complex attention human airplane pilot . ACh function dose related manner , increase task load high background noise correlate increase ACh release . Cholinergic antagonist ( e.g. , scopolamine ) slow reaction time ( RT ) increase omission error visual search , increase omission commission error signal detection . Higher scopolamine dos slow RT covert orient primate involve inferior parietal region . AD , attention cholinesterase inhibitor : The relationship attention acetylcholine well demonstrated assessment AChE-I . Efficacy study donepezil , galantamine rivastigmine show modest effect size range 1.8-4.1 point 70 point Alzheimer Disease Assessment Scale - Cognitive section ( ADAS-Cog ) scale . These small effect size may partially function use outcome measure , obscure sensitivity attention memory global score . Targeted cognitive domain may better response indicator . In post-mortem analysis AD patient , region low cholinergic activity correlate memory attention . Moreover , 12 week galantamine treatment , AD patient reach therapeutic dose show faster RT , good choice reaction time memory , recognition face . Also , functional imaging , early response AChE-I appear affect region mediate direct attention . In summary , attentional function intrinsically link level cholinergic activity , use outcome measure AChE-I treatment AD improve treatment sensitivity .</detailed_description>
