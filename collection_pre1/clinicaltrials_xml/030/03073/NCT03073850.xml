	<brief_summary>The purpose study investigate best strategy long-term stroke prevention patient sinus rhythm successful catheter ablation atrial fibrillation ( AF ) risk thromboembolic event ( CHA2DS2-VASc score â‰¥2 ) . The investigator go compare antiplatelet therapy oral anticoagulation ( OAC ) different dos edoxaban ( 30mg 60mg ) .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Antithrombotic Treatment Patients With Effectively Maintained Sinus Rhythm After Atrial Fibrillation Ablation</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The investigator hypothesize strategy OAC superior antiplatelet therapy , low dose edoxaban ( 30mg ) non-inferior standard dose edoxaban ( 60mg ) reduce risk stroke systemic embolism patient underwent successful AF ablation . Although AF ablation effective therapy reduce and/or eliminate burden AF , may continue risk late recurrence asymptomatic recurrence atrial tachyarrhythmias . Until , guideline recommend continuation OAC patient risk stroke systemic embolism base CHA2DS2-VASc score , even though maintain sinus rhythm . The annual rate stroke , however , still low compare predict score system , AF ablation reduce AF burden 86 % remain episode significantly short duration ( median 6 minute ) pre-ablation report previous study . Based recent study demonstrate standard-dose low-dose non-vitamin K OACs ( NOAC ) perform equally well regard stroke prevention patient AF , low dose NOACs may also sufficient stroke prevention briefly last AF episode successful AF ablation .</detailed_description>
