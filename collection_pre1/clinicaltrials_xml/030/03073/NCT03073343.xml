	<detailed_description>This prospective , unblinded , randomize study oral betaine diabetic non-diabetic patient clinical diagnosis NAFLD ALT≥ 50 IU/mL . A clinical diagnosis NAFLD base presence risk factor NAFLD ( overweight insulin resistance ) exclusion cause liver disease , alcohol viral hepatitis . Two cohort patient study : Cohort 1 ( diabetic ) consist patient clinical diagnosis non-insulin dependent type II diabetes mellitus ; Cohort 2 ( non-diabetics ) consist patient without clinical diagnosis type 2 diabetes mellitus . 24 patient enrol cohort ( total 48 patient enrol study ) anticipate drop 4 subject per cohort . Patients give dietary instruction advice exercise appropriate management NAFLD ( NIDDK liverfoundation.org handout ) . Patients prescribe 4 gram betaine/day ( 2 gram PO BID ) first 4 week study . After 4 week , patient cohort ( NIDDM non-diabetic ) randomize ( 1:1 ) continue receive betaine 4 gram per day increase 8 gram per day additional 8 week . All patient see clinic monthly basis treatment , 4 12 week completion betaine treatment . The total duration study 24 week ( 12 week betaine treatment 12 week follow-up ) . The primary outcome change ALT 12 week betaine treatment ( i.e. , ALT week 12 compare ALT baseline ( entry ) .
