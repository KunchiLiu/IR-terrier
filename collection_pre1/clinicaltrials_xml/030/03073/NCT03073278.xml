	<brief_title>Focal Radiotherapy Previously Treated Prostate Cancer Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Participants must biopsy proven locally recurrent prostate cancer . Biopsy perform Urologist . Participants PSMA-PET ( prostate-specific membrane antigen positron emission tomography ) scan MRI Radiology Nuclear Medicine experience Radiologists Royal North Shore Hospital . start stereotactic radiotherapy . Participants require fiducial marker insert prostate may require hydrogel insertion depend location recurrence . If require , do experienced radiation oncologist . Fiducial marker insertion involve insert three gold marker prostate . It use locate prostate accurately radiation treatment . Hydrogel temporary gel inject space prostate rectum reduce dose radiation receive rectum minimise side effect treatment , Focal Stereotactic Body treatment ( SBRT ) use study . There three group participant . Each group receive different level radiation dose test safety increase radiation dose . Group 1 receive 36 gray ( radiation dose unit , Gy ) ) 6 treatment . Group 2 receive 38 gray 6 treatment Group 3 receive 40 gray 6 treatment . The incremental dose escalation cease excess acute toxicity late grade 3 toxicity . SBRT deliver two three time per week , every second day . The number treatment per week depend day week participant start treatment . Participants review weekly second weekly . Toxicity record . A Safety Committee form contain multi-disciplinary team member . All serious adverse event report Principal Investigator Human Research Ethics Committee within 24 hour .</detailed_description>
