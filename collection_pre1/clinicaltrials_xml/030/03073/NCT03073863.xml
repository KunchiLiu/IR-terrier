	<brief_summary>Epidemiological study show serum cholesterol level correlate Cardiovascular Disease ( CVD ) risk , Cardiovascular Disease ( CVD ) risk increase increase LDL cholesterol level . Fortunately , confirm cholesterol-lowering therapy effective prevent Cardiovascular Disease ( CVD ) , cholesterol lower statin therapy primary strategy prevention Cardiovascular Disease ( CVD ) . Despite fact statin reduce LDL cholesterol future cardiovascular outcome , association statin intensity achieve level LDL cholesterol cardiovascular outcome fully elucidate , statins pleiotropic effect well LDL lower effect . The effect statin future Cardiovascular ( CV ) outcome seem associate statin intensity relate pleiotropic effect rather achieve LDL cholesterol level , LDL-lowering inhibition hepatic cholesterol synthesis link reciprocal increment cholesterol absorption intestine .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>It easily extrapolate relationship LDL-C level incidence Atherosclerotic Cardiovascular Disease ( ASCVD ) statin therapy correlation LDL-C level incidence Atherosclerotic Cardiovascular Disease ( ASCVD ) subject without statin therapy result lipid-lowering trial show 'the low achieve LDL-C level , well clinical outcome . However , association statin intensity achieve level LDL-C cardiovascular outcome fully elucidate , absolute amount LDL cholesterol reduction dependent statin intensity , also inter-individual variation statin responsiveness . In study , response therapy hypolipidemic agent show considerable individual variation , use dose statin different patient produce LDL-C decrease wide range 8 55 % . These difference may due interaction environmental genetic factor affect drug bioavailability , receptor function ligand structure candidate gene analyse found variant know regulator cholesterol metabolism HMGCR , Apolipoprotein E ( APOE ) , PCSK9 , Angiotensin Converting Enzyme ( ACE ) , NPC1L1 , Low-Density Lipoprotein Receptor ( LDLR ) associate statin response . Therefore , investigator suspect could mistake interpret result clinical trial different intensity statin . Actually , statin trial compare mean value achieve LDL-C clinical outcome statin therapy different intensity , report relationship individual value achieve LDL-C clinical outcome statin therapy intensity . To accept role achieve LDL-C level prevention Cardiovascular ( CV ) outcomes , still significant value adjust statin intensity . In PROVE IT-Thrombolysis In Myocardial Infarction ( TIMI ) 22 study use either 80 mg atorvastatin 40 mg pravastatin Acute Coronary Syndrome ( ACS ) patient , IDEAL study either 80 mg atorvastatin 20 mg simvastatin Acute Mycardial Infarction ( AMI ) patient , TNT study 80 mg atorvastatin 10 mg atorvastatin Coronary Artery Disease ( CAD ) patient , author demonstrate relationship level achieve LDL-C statin therapy statin intensity risk recurrent myocardial infarction death coronary cause separately . However , report relation achieve LDL-C level primary outcome adjustment statin intensity . Therefore , investigator think may inaccurate determine role achieve LDL-C level Atherosclerotic Cardiovascular Disease ( ASCVD ) prevention clinical trial trial include subject different intensity statin therapy . Same phenomenon also occur meta-analysis clinical trial different statin intensity . Therefore , Cholesterol Treatment Trialists ' Collaboration ( CTTC ) meta-analyses , reconsider absolute amount LDL-C reduction dependent statin intensity , also inter-individual variation statin responsiveness . All analysis perform intention-to-treat basis . Univariate analysis baseline characteristic patient , Cox proportional hazard model include age , sex , hypertension , diabetes , cardiovascular disease include coronary artery disease , cerebrovascular disease , peripheral artery disease , Congestive Heart Failure ( CHF ) , achieve LDL cholesterol level , achieve C-Reactive Protein ( CRP ) level , statin intensity As study use multiple dos statin , investigator would like evaluate linear regression analysis achieve LDL cholesterol level CV outcome total group , show correlation . However , investigator evaluates linear regression analysis achieve LDL cholesterol level Cardiovascular ( CV ) outcome group treat 10 mg atorvastatin , show relation , individual variability LDL-C lowering effect statin . The result expect relationship achieve LDL cholesterol level Cardiovascular ( CV ) outcome group treat 80 mg atorvastatin . With survival curve use Cox proportional hazard model total Major Adverse Cardiac Events ( MACE ) component , investigator evaluate impact following : 1 . Achieved LDL-C level ( quartile ) 2 . Statin intensity 3 . Achieved C-Reactive Protein ( CRP ) level ( quartile ) 4 . Absolute mount LDL-C lower 5 . Absolute mount C-Reactive Protein ( CRP ) lower 6 . Other risk factor age , sex , hypertension , diabetes , hyperlipidemia , etc .</detailed_description>
