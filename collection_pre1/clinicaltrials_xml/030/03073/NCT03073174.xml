	<brief_title>Dietary Intakes Periodontal Health : A Follow-Up Study</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Periodontitis chronic oral infection result breakdown connective tissue alveolar bone support teeth . Bacteria body 's immune system mediate severity periodontitis , teeth may become loose , fall remove . Sanative therapy non-surgical process involve mechanical debridement bacterial biofilms root teeth , gum line . Participants present study previously underwent sanative therapy several year ago attend clinic regular maintenance appointment maintain periodontal health . While significant association observe high intake fruit vegetable specific nutrient ( vitamin C E , beta-carotene , fish oil ) within month sanative therapy , study follow-up finding determine relationship persist period relatively stable periodontal health . Given new insight potential role flavonoid maintain periodontal health , aspect also study . The overall objective determine high intake food , nutrient supplement know osteogenic immunomodulatory effect associate improved clinical outcome individual previously underwent sanative therapy . At regular maintenance appointment , clinical measure evaluate ( clinical attachment loss , probe depth , bleed probing , plaque index ) . As well , follow evaluate : dietary intake macronutrients micronutrient use Block 2015 food frequency questionnaire ; intake fruit , vegetable fiber use Block Dietary Fruit-Vegetable-Fiber Screener ; nutritional supplement use tea intake use specially develop questionnaire salivary marker inflammation use biochemical assay .</detailed_description>
