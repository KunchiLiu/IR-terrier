	<brief_title>A Multicenter Prospective Randomized Control Study Persona Total Knee System v NexGen</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Knee replacement establish treatment late stage osteoarthritis ( OA ) knee . There increase demand joint replacement young population . Due change demographic joint replacement , population young patient seek option correct disease deformity , limit activity . Studies show modern implant design potentially improve outcome . Therefore new implant introduce marked theoretical benefit improve implant survival superior patient report outcome . Within Total knee arthroplasty , design change introduce attempt improve knee kinematics , functionality outcome , potential improvement need evaluate . The NexGen Total Knee System knee replacement system well document performance device choice many institution . Recently , Zimmer-Biomet introduce Persona Total Knee system design change include asymmetric tibia plate , increase medial pivoting extensive choice respect poly thickness , purpose improve balance , stability longevity . Such design change propose benefit need evaluate prospective clinical trial , focus patient safety , satisfaction implant durability . The aim evaluate intra-operative postop complication , long-term survivorship patient report outcome measure follow primary total knee replacement use Persona Cruciate Retaining ( CR ) total Knee system compare NexGen Cruciate Retaining ( CR ) total Knee System . This project carry 2-arm randomize control single-blinded trial . A total 314 participant include 6 center Denmark . Participants see outpatient basis 3 month 1 2 year postoperatively . After 2-year follow-up patient follow survivorship Danish Knee Arthroplasty Registry .</detailed_description>
