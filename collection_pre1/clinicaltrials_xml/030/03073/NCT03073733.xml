Preclinical study demonstrate transplantation retinal progenitor cell eye result photoreceptor replacement significant slow host photoreceptor loss . Thus , primary goal therapy preserve , potentially improve , vision intervene disease time dystrophic host photoreceptors protect reactivate . Based demonstration acceptable safety tolerability phase 1/2a study , phase 2b study design control comparison change visual function functional vision subject receive single jCell injection comparison comparable untreated control group subject RP .</detailed_description>
