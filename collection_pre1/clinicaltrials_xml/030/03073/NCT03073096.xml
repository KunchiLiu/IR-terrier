	<brief_summary>Lymphedema build-up lymph fluid body 's tissue causing chronic , debilitate swell . This commonly occur result disruption lymphatic system lymph node dissection surgery . In melanoma patient , incidence lymphedema range 5-10 % arm follow axillary dissection , 28-40 % leg follow groin dissection . LYMPHA ( LYmphatic Microsurgical Preventive Healing Approach ) innovative microsurgical technique block lymphatic vessel drain blood circulation surgically create shunt lymphatic channel blood vessel call lymphatic-venous bypass . Recently , LYMPHA show prevent lymphedema perform time nodal dissection . We propose prospective pilot study evaluate practice LYMPHA technique primary prevention lymphedema The Ottawa Hospital . The novel use LYMPHA technique hold potential prevent lymphedema rather attempt treat already progress result improve quality life cancer patient , also decrease health care cost associate treat lymphedema .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Consenting patient LYMPHA procedure time plan axillary groin dissection surgery prevention upper low extremity lymphedema , respectively . The node dissection perform Dr. Nessim , LYMPHA technique perform plastic surgeon , Dr. Momtazi , train microsurgical technique . The LYMPHA procedure consist perform lymphatic-venous anastomosis ( LVA ) time node dissection . Patent blue dye inject patient approximately 10 minute skin incision . This allow mapping lymphatic channel identification bypass . The node dissection perform preservation saphenous vein leg anterior branch axillary vein axilla . Afferent lymphatic vessel suture saphenous vein branch axillary vein distal competent valve , respectively . The total duration surgery approximately 3 hour . The LYMPHA technique account additional 30 minute standard 2-2.5 hour allocate node dissection . Pre-surgery , patient baseline limb circumference measurement surgery-affected unaffected limb ( arm leg ) . Patients follow clinically every 3 month year , second year . At follow-up visit , patient physical examination circumferential limb measurement take measure tape three specific interval limb . Patients also fill limb lymphedema-specific quality life questionnaire ( LYMQOL ) administer pre- post-surgery . ) The primary objective pilot study offer LYMPHA surgery patient require axillary groin dissection part lymphadenectomy order i.determine consent rate , ii.establish ability obtain follow-up data , iii.estimate success rate LYMPHA procedure , iv . obtain preliminary evidence efficacy LYMPHA procedure prevent lymphedema , v. obtain limb-specific quality life information pre- post- surgery , vi.design protocol randomize control trial compare lymphedema rate patient receive lymphadenectomy + lymphatic-venous bypass versus lymphadenectomy alone .</detailed_description>
