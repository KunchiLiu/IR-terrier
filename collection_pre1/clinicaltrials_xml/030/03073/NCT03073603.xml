	<brief_summary>Natural history research MS suggest risk relapse new Magnetic Resonance Imaging ( MRI ) change diminish significantly people age , especially MS patient 55 old . Thus , need continue MS medicine reduce relapse new MRI lesion may also decrease people age , especially relapse MRI scan change prolong time . This study plan learn safety stop MS medication population , compare continue medication .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>This study 2 different group research subject . One group stay current MS medication , one group discontinue medication . To decide group participant , investigator use method chance . This method like flip coin roll dice . This call `` randomization '' . Participants randomize one 2 group describe . They also extra assessment do regular routine MS clinic appointment every 6 month next 2 year . The following item do addition assessment procedure already do part clinical care item pay study : - Some questionnaire participant 's quality life include question health , mood , thinking , social life - Some questionnaire participant 's MS symptoms - A test participant 's attention , concentration , think involves add repeat number - A test participant 's physical symptom - Along MRIs participant get part routine care , also one 6 month start study part study .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Patients either Relapsingremitting MS ( RRMS ) , Secondary progressive MS ( SPMS ) , Primary progressive MS ( PPMS ) McDonald 2010 criterion . Patients define subtype base 2013 updated phenotypic criterion . Progression MS define local PI either : prospectively EDSS change least 1.0 point last two year , retrospectively , significant change motor function least one year , unrelated relapse . 55 year age old time randomization ; No evidence new inflammatory disease activity ( inactive Lublin criteria16 ) least five year Using FDAapproved MS DMTs ( include : interferon β1a , interferon β1b , glatiramer acetate , natalizumab , fingolimod , dimethyl fumarate , teriflunomide ; continuously le 5 year . Taking recent DMT continuously* less two year . Willing randomize per protocol ; patient question willingness stay trial regardless group group randomize . Willing follow protocol Able undergo brain MRI without anesthesia Continuously define less 75 % prescribed dos , time great four week last intend dose miss dose ( 8 week natalizumab , i.e . one miss dose ) . Any MS relapse last five year , determine screen visit PI Any new definitely enlarge T2/FLAIR lesion new gadoliniumenhancing lesion within past 5 year ( least 2 scan separate least 5 year must review ) brain spine MRI scan Significant ( define PI ) intolerance presentlyused DMT Use nonFDAapproved DMT systemic corticosteroid last 5 year . Use inhale topical steroid exclusion criterion . Use oral steroid great 14 day give nonMS condition exclusionary . Prior use follow past 10 year : alemtuzumab , mitoxantrone , cyclophosphamide , methotrexate , cyclosporine , rituximab Prior use experimental agent use DMT MS last five year Other significant medical psychiatric illness , uncontrolled . Examples : uncontrolled hypertension , uncontrolled diabetes , uncontrolled asthma , uncontrolled depression Cancers basal cell skin cancer within last 10 year Unable give inform consent follow protocol Unable undergo brain MRI Unwilling randomize per protocol History chronic neurological illness might mimic MS chronic intermittent symptom ( i.e . ALS , myasthenia gravis , chronic neuropathy , etc . )</criteria>
