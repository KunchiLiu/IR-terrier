	<brief_title>Satisfaction &amp; Spectacle Independence With ReSTOR 2.5 &amp; ReSTOR 3.0 IOLs</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Patients desire spectacle independence range distance , include distance , intermediate , near . The ReSTOR 2.5 multifocal lens design allow well uncorrected intermediate vision reduce glare halo compare previous , higher-add model . However , impact overall patient satisfaction , glare &amp; halo ( incidence impact ) , spectacle independence examine patient-reported outcome study . Additionally , clinical practice , many clinician find bilateral implantation ReSTOR 2.5 yield insufficient near vision 30 % patient ( 1 ) . For reason , many surgeon prefer implant ReSTOR 2.5 one eye ( usually dominant ) ReSTOR 3.0 eye , would recommend investigate combination study . MDbackline multi-center patient-reported research engine use since 2013 data collection several patient-reported outcome study major industry sponsor . Studies perform MDbackline present major meeting press peer-reviewed journal . The investigator previously conduct study patient satisfaction spectacle independence high add ( 3.0 ) multifocal lens prior approval ReSTOR 2.5 . These data , include 85 patient , use historical reference . They show high degree satisfaction spectacle independence complaint glare halo many 37 % patient ( `` fair amount glare '' ) . ( 2 ) Since approval ReSTOR 2.5 , investigator clinically observe far few complaint glare/haloes lower-add lens use least one eye . In study investigator propose evaluate patient ReSTOR 2.5 lens one eye ReSTOR 3.0 use substantially questionnaire previous study describe . We plan compare result new data ( 2.5/3.0 combination ) previous study data ( 3.0/3.0 ) .</detailed_description>
