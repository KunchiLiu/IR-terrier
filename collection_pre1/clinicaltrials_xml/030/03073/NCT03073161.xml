	<brief_summary>Periodontitis chronic inflammatory disease , untreated , lead tooth loss . To treat periodontal disease , sanative therapy use first line cost-effective strategy manage periodontal disease thus prevent tooth loss . Diet emerge modifiable factor may help individual fully respond treatment sanative therapy . Dietary flavonoid , abundant fruit tea , may particularly beneficial . Patients moderate severe chronic generalize periodontitis undergo sanative therapy recruit study . Mean clinical attachment loss well clinical measure assess baseline 8 12 week follow sanative therapy measure periodontal healing . At baseline follow-up appointment , follow assessed examine association clinical measure periodontal healing : intake macronutrients micronutrient , fruit , vegetable tea well supplement use salivary marker inflammation .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Flavonoid Intake Periodontal Healing</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Periodontitis chronic oral infection result breakdown connective tissue alveolar bone support teeth . Bacteria body 's immune system mediate severity periodontitis , teeth may become loose , fall remove . Sanative therapy non-surgical process invovling mechanical debridement bacterial biofilms root teeth , gum line . A previous study find diet high fruit vegetable , beta-carotene , vitamin C , alpha-tocopherol , fish oil ( specifically eicosapentaenoic acid ( EPA ) docosahexaenoic acid ( DHA ) ) positively associate periodontal heal sanative therapy . There evidence high intake flavonoid thus flavonoid-containing food may benefit periodontal health . These food include wide variety fruit tea . The relationship flavonoid intake within overall dietary pattern assess relation recovery sanative therapy associate marker improve periodontal health . The overall objective determine high dietary flavonoid intake associate improved clinical outcome sanative therapy compare individual low intake . At baseline follow-up appointment , follow assess : dietary intake macronutrients micronutrient use Block 2015 food frequency questionnaire ; intake fruit , vegetable fiber use Block Dietary Fruit-Vegetable-Fiber Screener ; nutritional supplement use tea intake use specially develop questionnaire salivary marker inflammation .</detailed_description>
