	<brief_summary>Specific Aim : To determine effectiveness Roflumilast improving ) whole right lung ii ) peripheral right lung mucociliary clearance ( MCC ) patient COPD chronic bronchitis . Hypothesis : Roflumilast increase mucociliary clearance patient chronic bronchitis . Study Design : This double-blinded , cross-over randomize controlled trial 1:1 randomization 20 individual chronic bronchitis . Subjects undergo baseline MCC randomize either roflumilast placebo x 4 week , 4 week wash-out phase second 4 week period roflumilast/placebo depend initial randomization . MCC conduct baseline end 4 week medication phase .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>The Effectiveness Roflumilast Improving Mucociliary Clearance Patients With COPD Chronic Bronchitis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The purpose study investigate well Roflumilast improve mucociliary clearance people chronic bronchitis . Several study show roflumilast may modulate ( change ) mucociliary function . This study design determine favorable effect lead improve mucociliary clearance ( MCC ) people chronic bronchitis , thereby , reduce potential acute infection hospitalization . Daliresp® ( roflumilast ) drug currently market ( approved U.S. Food Drug Administration ( FDA ) use human ) U.S. indicate ( use ) treatment people severe COPD treat symptom cough excess mucous link chronic bronchitis . Roflumilast use reduce risk ( chance ) COPD exacerbation ( increase symptom cough , mucus secretion , shortness breath , life threaten reduces ability breathe ) link chronic bronchitis ( swell airway lung ) . Roflumilast FDA approve decrease number flare-ups chronic obstructive pulmonary disease ( COPD ) patient severe COPD chronic bronchitis history flare-up . The exact way Roflumilast known . Although Roflumilast FDA approve drug , study drug use FDA-approved indication . If agree study , receive new COPD treatment drug provide study . You also give tablet take day , placebo least part study . A placebo substance look like study drug contains active ingredient . The study double-blind study . Double-blind mean neither study doctor know study regimen ( roflumilast placebo ) receive throughout study . However , information make available medically necessary determine participant 's study . You undergo baseline mucociliary Clearance ( MCC ) Measurements randomize ( chance , like flip coin ) receive either roflumilast placebo 4 week , 4 week wash-out phase , second 4 week period roflumilast/placebo depend initial randomization . Mucociliary Clearance ( MCC ) Measurements conduct begin end 4 week study regimen phase . You study 12 week 12 visit . At baseline , prior MCC Procedure , health assessment may include Physical Examination , Health Demographic Interview , Exhaled Carbon Monoxide ( eCO ) Testing , Spirometry ( Breathing Test ) , Expectorated Sputum Collection , Pregnancy Testing Mucociliary Clearance ( MCC ) Measurements .</detailed_description>
