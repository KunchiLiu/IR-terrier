	<brief_summary>This chart review patient underwent open prenatal repair fetal myelomeningocele . Although prenatal repair associate improved neurologic outcome decrease need cerebrospinal fluid shunt birth , one major risk preterm delivery . This study intend identify maternal , fetal intraoperative risk factor associate preterm delivery .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Fetal Myelomeningocele</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Myelomeningocele encompass common form spina bifida . The incidence range 2.73-3.80 per 10,000 birth United States . The extent neurologic sequela correlate level lesion frequently involve spectrum motor dysfunction include paralysis low extremity , contracture addition lack bladder bowel control . These result significant lifestyle limitation survivor . Additionally , hydrocephalus , brainstem herniation Chiari II malformation commonly note . Ventriculoperitoneal shunt commonly place childhood redirect cerebrospinal fluid require revision later life . The Management Myelomeningocele Study ( MOMS ) trial revolutionize management fetus myelomeningoceles demonstrate prenatal compare standard postnatal repair result decreased need cerebrospinal fluid shunt improve motor function thirty month . As result , various center around United States begin offer prenatal repair patient less twenty-six week gestation prespecified maternal fetal characteristic . Prenatal repair without risk mother fetus . The mother must undergo laparotomy accept risk involve intraabdominal surgery include bleeding , infection , adhesion formation damage nearby organ . Unique procedure , hysterotomy typically create active segment uterus allow sufficient exposure fetal lesion . Like woman undergo classical Cesarean section , patient must undergo Cesarean section around 37 week gestation future pregnancy secondary concern uterine dehiscence set labor . This major implication mother 's future childbearing potential , number previous Cesarean section increase risk intraoperative complication invasive placentation subsequent pregnancy . A fetoscopic approach reemerged United States alternative aforementioned open approach currently investigation . Intraoperative fetal distress report lead loss pregnancy . Additionally , fetal surgery carry risk spontaneous preterm birth preterm premature rupture membrane , subject fetus morbidity prematurity . This risk spontaneous preterm delivery one common significant drawback procedure represent major hurdle overcome . In MOMS trial , 46 % study group compare 8 % postnatal repair group experience spontaneous rupture membrane . Thirty-eight percent prenatal repair versus 14 % postnatal repair patient go spontaneous labor prior schedule delivery . The average gestational age birth 34 week prenatal surgery group 37 week postnatal surgery group . In another study follow MOMS trial , 100 patient underwent prenatal repair report 32.3 % rate preterm premature rupture membrane ( PPROM ) 37.5 % rate preterm labor . Also report modified surgical approach hysterotomy closure among 43 patient find 22 % rate PPROM . Thirty-nine percent deliver 37 week later compare 21 % MOMS cohort . Although increase risk preterm delivery report , little know regard risk factor associate preterm delivery follow procedure . Soni et al . find chorioamniotic membrane separation risk factor subsequent PPROM . No study publish assess risk factor spontaneous preterm delivery include preterm labor PPROM . The objective study determine maternal , fetal intraoperative factor identify increase risk spontaneous preterm delivery patient undergo prenatal open myelomeningocele repair . With identification factor , counsel patient potentially patient selection could refine future .</detailed_description>
