	<detailed_description>Research Design Methods Impact Survey Design To determine impact program main outcome ( i.e. , prevalence anemia dietary intake practice ) use quasi-experimental , control , pre-post design set intervention ( Figure 1 ) . We use quasi-experimental design possible identify large pool factory randomly sample assign factory control intervention group . To minimize possible selection bias , : . To extent possible , factory select base specified criterion , minimize major difference response intervention among ( described selection factory section ) . ii . Select individual woman pre-post study base match equivalence key characteristic ( eg , age ) ; iii . Use difference-in-difference analysis test impact . Intervention Description Two type intervention test control total 4 factory . Among factory already provide hot lunch worker , one intervention one control factory select , among factory provide hot lunch , one intervention one control factory select . Intervention hot lunch : In select garment factory already provide hot lunch meal worker , intervention consist nutritionally enhance lunch meal program ( increased dietary diversity plus inclusion multi-nutrient fortified rice ) , provision weekly iron/folate supplement female worker , BCC program conduct factory set focus improve health nutrition woman child , focus anemia prevention . Change Associates measure nutritionally improve enhanced diet individual consumption . The BCC program build exist program call 'HERhealth ' currently implement BSR Change Associates garment factory Bangladesh . The HERhealth program enhance include module nutrition ( balanced diets/dietary diversity , iron/folate rich food ) , infant young child nutrition ( IYCN ) , overview module anemia prevention , hand-washing soap dietary diversity begin intervention . Existing factory-run child day care also enhance include additional training day care worker Early Childhood Development method health hygiene practice , improvement facility regard hygiene sanitation . One control factory also include , standard HERhealth module implement . After completion endline impact survey , additional BCC module nutrition IYCF , technical advice improve lunch program day care center , deliver appropriate desire . Intervention without lunch program : In select garment factory lunch program , intervention consist twice weekly provision iron/folate supplement female worker , enhance HERhealth program , describe , include enhancement exist child day care program . One control factory select standard HERhealth module implement . As noted , additional intervention component enhance HERhealth program implement control factory complete endline impact survey , appropriate desire . Dietary component intervention ( lunch supplement ) Lunch meal Based information compile menu 7 factory currently serve hot lunch factory worker average frequency estimate serve size different food group summarize Table 1 . Rice dal serve large bowl table worker consume much choose , serve size show estimate . Other menu item serve individually fix portion size . In addition dietary modification , food service garment factories procure multi-nutrient fortify , vitamin A fortified vegetable oil , iodize salt use prepare lunch meal , already . Behavior Change Communications Component This use peer-education model whereby one module introduce month peer educator select among factory worker ; master trainer conduct session group 24-30 peer educator . For module , 3 hour regular training session one hour refresher training subsequent month , i.e . total 4 hour 2 month every module . Peer educator select among worker base leadership quality . For outreach factory worker , factory management schedule one weekly 15-minute session peer educator approximately 15 respective colleague . Additionally , factory visibility awareness tool project board relevant area ( i.e . hand wash chart bathroom wash area ) continuous refresher . The Enhanced HERhealth Curriculum consist follow module ; 1 . Summary module 2 . Health , Hygiene Personal Health 3 . Nutrition Dietary Diversity 4 . Maternal Nutrition Hygiene ( focus anemia ) 5 . Infant Young Child Feeding ( IYCF ) + Breastfeeding ( BF ) 6 . Reproductive Health Family Planning 7 . Sexually Transmitted Infections Selection factory Given large commitment require part factory management introduce hot meal , selection factory assignment study group do random allocation . Randomization would help minimize bias sample selection ( , minimize chance difference outcomes , response treatment , group occur due exist difference group ) . To minimize difference , use set match criterion guide selection , summarize : 1 . Willingness participate program comply research requirement 10-12 month period . Specifically , requirement : 1 . They would consider provide improve hot lunch ( Treatment ) 2 . Willing fully participate HERhealth program 3 . Willing make data available absenteeism 4 . Willing allow data collect selected worker baseline/endline survey monthly basis monitoring purpose throughout pilot project period To extent possible , purpose match : 2 . Factory approximately - 1500- 6000 worker 3 . Factory similar ratio woman : men ( e.g. , 60:40 70:30 ) 4 . Factory produce similar garment product ( e.g. , woven vs. knit clothing ) 5 . Factory day care facility Sample Size Calculation Outcome The sample-size survey calculate anemia consideration 10-15 % absolute reduction prevalence baseline result impact intervention compare control . Considering 5 % level significance , 80 % power 20 % non-response , minimum sample-size 328 female garment worker per factory . Measurement key outcome Anemia : Hemoglobin measure capillary blood sample use portable HemoCue machine baseline enrolment end 10 month assess anemia female garment worker . Single finger prick method use assess haemoglobin status field . The cut-off level haemoglobin consider define anemia : &lt; 110 g/L pregnant &lt; 120 g/L non-pregnant non-lactating lactate woman survey area sea level . Absenteeism : Collect data factory Human Resources management worker absenteeism . Data collect continuous basis ( i.e. , complete data throughout intervention ) . Ideally data restrict individual factory worker identify female , individual worker line predominantly female . Ideally , data restrict unscheduled time , oppose vacation time lay time non-permanent staff . Health related absenteeism monitor collection data factory doctor 's office . However , latter account employee request leave work course work day , include n't attend work . Health related absenteeism question also apply directly sample woman include baseline/endline survey . Worker retention : Human resource consult ongoing data number female garment worker staff member leave employment position throughout intervention period . They may also consult number female garment worker hire trained replace worker leave . Sampling procedure : The required number survey respondent randomly select list female worker available study factory . The place interview inside factory prior appointment interview note field worker beforehand consultation individual respondent and/or supervisor . For hemoglobin estimation , require number female worker randomly select list survey participant . For key informant interview , around 2-3 respondent per factory tentatively select result total 8-12 key informant interview . An iterative process follow key informant interview saturation information reach . In addition note take Research Assistants , audio record interview undertake . Data collection tools/measurements Questionnaire/ guideline/ checklist For survey , pre-tested semi-structured questionnaire use research staff interview select female garment worker . Necessary guideline highlight area interest use key informant interview necessary field test . Investigators train Field Research Officer ( FRO ) conduct interview . A checklist use Field Research Assistants ( FRAs ) observation study factory . Ethical Considerations Prior implementation study , necessary approval Institutional Review Board ( IRB ) icddr , b obtain protocol . Data Analysis Data entry clean Survey data double enter computer use SPSS ( version 17 ) . Checks error enter data do manually error detect correct immediately . In addition , data validate series logical range check , produce summary statistic table . Data analysis The survey data analyse use SPSS ( version 17 ) / STATA software ( version 12 ) . The summary statistic would express mean standard deviation , median percentage , 95 % confidence interval ( CI ) appropriate . To assess difference mean among factory , ANOVA categorical outcome , chi-square statistical comparison proportion 95 % confidence interval , calculate . A difference-of-difference ( DID ) analysis quantitative outcome data do . To identify significant predictor associate main outcome indicator , bivariate multiple regression analysis employ . Thematic analysis follow qualitative information collect key informant interview , observation record review . Following preparation transcript , response cod accord theme ( priori ) , sub theme emergent issue , . Triangulation data derive different method carry validate qualitative information .</detailed_description>
