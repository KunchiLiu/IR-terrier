	<brief_title>Comparison Paracoracoid Subscapularis Plane Block Interscalene Block Arthroscopic Shoulder Surgery</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Background : Postoperative pain arthroscopic shoulder surgery severe 30- 70 % patient first twenty-four forty-eight post-operative hour . Single injection interscalene block ( ISB ) commonly offer decrease postoperative pain follow shoulder surgery many associate benefit like reduce opioid consumption , nausea decrease Postoperative Acute Care Unit ( PACU ) stay . The adverse event ISB may reduce ultrasound guidance completely eliminate . One major concern phrenic nerve involvement result diaphragm paresis , major implication patient respiratory compromise . One alternative blockade suprascapular nerve suprascapular fossa axillary nerve curve around humeral neck . Although researcher Australia report good outcome earlier study do u suboptimal effect ( 102994 ) , possibly nerve block articular branch exit main trunk . There study currently ongoing block do proximally center require 2 injection . The investigator anatomical study Fresh frozen cadaver note drug deliver superficial Fascia Subscapularis muscle stain Axillary Nerve , Upper subscapular nerve possibly suprascapular nerve enters suprascapular fossa The extent two technique differ term overall analgesia evaluate . With background , The investigator want compare analgesic efficacy interscalene block versus Paracoracoid Subscapularis plane block combine superficial cervical plexus block . Aims objectives : The objective study compare efficacy safety paracoracoid subscapularis plane block interscalene block control pain arthroscopic shoulder surgery . The primary outcome duration analgesia provide regional block . The duration define time end injection local anesthetic time patient request rescue analgesia ( pain score great 6 10 ) . The secondary outcome include measurement degree respiratory depression via Pulmonary Function Test ultrasound assessment diaphragmatic function , first 24 48th hour pain score , time need perform type block , post-operative opioid requirement ( 24 hour analgesic consumption ) failure rate . Primary Hypothesis : Paracoracoid Subscapularis plane block result comparable analgesia interscalene block spar Phrenic nerve Secondary hypothesis : 1 . Paracoracoid Subscapularis Plane block result well preserved diaphragm function compare interscalene block . 2 . The failure rate similar two group ( null hypothesis ) 3 . The postoperative opioid consumption similar 2 group ( null hypothesis ) Methodology : After institutional approval informed consent , 120 , patient either sex belonging American Society Anesthetists ( ASA ) physical status 1 3 schedule elective arthroscopic shoulder surgery include study . Patients receive chronic narcotic therapy , patient major respiratory morbidity , morbid obesity patient peripheral neuropathy provide inform consent exclude study . Patients educate regard numerical rating score ( NRS ) scale 0 10 0 pain 10 bad pain ever experience preoperative NRS score document . Patients randomize one 2 group use web base randomization . All procedure do block room use sterile precaution , standard monitor intravenous sedation per standard practice hospital . The baseline respiratory function measure bedside spirometry , repeat 3 time point : Pre block , 20 minute post block 60 minute arrival PACU post-surgery . Patients diaphragm thickness measure side chest , patient seat , anterior axillary line use high frequency linear probe position vertically position probe mark skin side ensure comparable measurement . Patients ask take big breath 3 times+/-sniffs loop diaphragm movement record ultrasound machine . The point diaphragm peel chest wall note ultrasound thickness diaphragm measure use caliper available US machine . The thickness average 3 measurement . These measurement repeat contralateral side . Once complete , patient connect standard monitor ( EKG , Pulse oximetry NIBP ) receive supplemental oxygen . All patient receive titrate dos intravenous fentanyl midazolam conscious sedation per standard practice institution . All patient position supine 45 degree head tilt roll blanket ipsilateral side allow slight rotation contralateral side . Group 1 receive interscalene block 15mL ropivacaine 0.5 % level C6 ventral ramus identify 7-12MHz linear probe position horizontally . Neurostimulation 0.6mA result contraction deltoid biceps . A total 15mL inject repeated aspiration rule intravascular placement needle tip . Once do , needle tip move lateral edge sternocleidomastoid muscle additional 3mL 0.5 % ropivacaine inject deep fascia sternocleidomastoid deep investing fascia neck ( superficial cervical plexus block SCP ) . The start finish time record . In addition , probe move similar group two skin infiltration saline do blind patient . Group 2 receive paracoracoid subscapularis plane block ultrasound probe position head humerus sagittal plane . The probe move medial locate coracoid process . Pectoralis major , pectoralis minor subscapularis muscle scapular fossa identify . Using 50mm 22G block needle 15ml 0.5 % Ropivacaine deposit anterior fascia subscapularis muscle elicit motor response 0.6mA current deliver needle . Following , superficial cervical plexus block do use 3mL 0.5 % ropivacaine similar group 1 . All patient receive small band-aid 2 location possible needle entry blind observer randomization . An independent observer document motor sensory block 20 minute block injection complete group . Patients bedside spirometry repeat . They sit position . Ultrasound evaluation diaphragm do bilaterally anterior axillary line posteriorly position probe exactly mark pre-block . The thickness diaphragm assess use average three deep inspirations/sniffs . Total duration block performance , number attempt block time onset sensory block record performance block , blind observer . The failure rate nerve block determine blind observer 30 minute . Patients fail block exclude efficacy part study . After performance block , patient move operating room surgery general anesthesia accord choice anesthesiologist ( LMA vs. endotracheal intubation ) use fentanyl 2-3Âµg/Kg , propofol 2 mg/kg follow maintenance desflurane/sevoflurane air-oxygen mixture . Vasopressors opioids administer need titrated clinical effect . Total dose narcotic use record . The patient assess site severity pain rest movement arrival PACU 2 hourly interval till discharge PACU . Patients provide diary document pain score every 6 hourly thereafter 24 hour time arrival PACU ( time 0 ) . Patients contact one investigator ensure pain well control get pain score ongoing narcotic consumption 9PM day surgery 7AM postoperative day 1 . They remind fill data sheet mail back u . The investigator inquire precise time point block wore . The investigator also seek information persist neurological deficit 7AM call . If pain severe ( &gt; 7/10 ) arrival PACU , defined failure technique give intravenous hydromorphone 0.2-0.4mg titrated effect PACU . An emergency telephone number provide case medical problem 24 h performance block . All patient follow 24 48 hour later find persist neurological deficit per standard practice institution . The investigator point collect data regard duration block , time first rescue analgesia , total analgesic requirement occurrence complication related nerve block . Patients give instruction call contact u develop new onset neurological deficits/symptoms follow 4 week . Patient satisfaction document 24 hour visual analogue scale 0 totally dissatisfied 100 totally satisfied . The total participation time patient 2 day . Statistical Analysis : Data present mean +/- SD median ( min , max ) continuous data include duration hour , respiratory function , pain , patient satisfaction time point group . Statistical comparison between-group make use ANCOVA block group fix effect , endpoint dependent variable pre-block score covariate . This produce adjust mean between-group difference 95 % CI . The adjustment pre-block score also provide precise estimate effect . If low boundary 95 % CI adjust mean difference duration great 2 hour investigator declare SPB superior ISB . Because interest institution term resource use cost , procedure-related data like time administer block , time sensory onset , total narcotic dose , number attempt present use mean +/-SD , median ( min , max ) mean difference 95 % CI . Nominal data like failure rate complication describe use proportion . Site severity pain rest movement present use line graphs support hypothetical expect location pain give investigator know anatomical innervation relate type block administer .</detailed_description>
