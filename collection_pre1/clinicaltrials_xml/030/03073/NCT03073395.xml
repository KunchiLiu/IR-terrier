CT , bone scan , MRI , ultrasound , FDG PET/CT ) within 3 month screen . If subject post curativeintent local treatment ( e.g . radical prostatectomy , local radiotherapy , brachytherapy ) must meet one follow criterion : PostProstatectomy ( without adjuvant RT ) : detectable rise PSA level ≥ 0.2 ng/mL second confirmatory level ≥ 0.2 ng/mL measure least 2 week apart OR PostRadiotherapy : detectable rise PSA level risen nadir least 3 consecutive test measure least 2 week apart OR 2 . Renal Cell cancer know suspect metastatic disease base clinical imaging ( e.g . CT , bone scan , MRI , ultrasound , FDG PET/CT ) 1 . Estimated creatinine clearance ( eGFR ) &lt; 30 mL/min ( calculate serum creatinine result within 30 day screen ) 2 . Androgen deprivation therapy ( ADT ) within 3 month prior screen 3 . Chemotherapy radiation therapy within 2 week screen 4 . Inability tolerate image procedure opinion investigator treat physician 5 . Any current medical condition , illness , disorder assess medical record review and/or selfreported consider physician investigator condition could compromise participant safety successful completion study BIODISTRIBUTION GROUP : History prostate cancer post curativeintent local treatment ( e.g.radical prostatectomy , local radiotherapy , brachytherapy ) clinical PSA level meet one follow criterion 1 .
