	<brief_summary>Among patient advanced ( metastatic ) cancer , detailed characterization tumor utilizing genomic proteonomic technique may help guide treatment . It , however , remain unclear new diagnostic technology truly influence clinical economic outcome . This study evaluate patient treat accord result NantHealth GPS Cancer test achieve optimal outcome compare patient whose treatment discordant GPS Cancer recommendation .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Evaluation NantHealth GPS Cancer Test Patients With Advanced Cancers</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Personalized Medicine approach cancer management require detail diagnostic evaluation . Broad genomic profiling , use whole genome ( DNA ) whole transcriptome ( RNA ) sequence platform , hold promise identifying tumor related mutation amenable targeted therapy , potential improve clinical outcome low toxicity compare traditional cytotoxic chemotherapy . Proteomic approach may add additional insight treatment selection identify protein biomarkers know induce drug resistance indicate drug sensitivity chemotherapy , monoclonal antibody therapy , hormonal therapy , target therapy immunotherapy . The full value approach realize routine clinical cancer care . GPS Cancerâ„¢ comprehensive test available NantHealth . GPS Cancer integrate whole genome ( DNA ) sequencing , whole transcriptome ( RNA ) sequencing , quantitative proteomics mass spectrometry , provide oncologist comprehensive molecular profile patient 's cancer inform personalize treatment strategy . GPS Cancer test conduct CLIA-certified CAP-accredited laboratory . Hypothesis : 1 . The addition proteomics next generation sequencing ( NGS ) via NantHealthGPS Cancer test incorporation whole genome sequence identify treatment algorithm increase likelihood successful clinical outcome patient advance cancer . Study Design ( summary ) : 1 . The patient population consist 160 total individual tumor tissue available NantHealth GPS Cancer testing : ( 1 ) pancreatic cancer patient ineligible curative surgery , ( 2 ) metastatic breast cancer , ( 3 ) advance stage ( non-resectable/metastatic/incurable ) lung cancer , ( 4 ) metastatic non-resectable malignant melanoma , ( 4 ) metastatic colon cancer amenable curative therapy , ( 5 ) metastatic hormone refractory prostate cancer . 2 . The treat oncologist declare plan treatment strategy test result obtained.These plan compare retrospectively actual treatment plan deliver patient determine `` change rate '' . 3 . The executive steer committee review NantHealthGPS Cancer report compare result actual delivered therapy . Patients segregate cohort `` GPS treatment concordant '' `` GPS treatment discordant '' . 4 . A cohort patient similar disease ( match via COTA Nodal Address system ) draw ratio 3 1 COTA database . 5 . The time choose therapy ( time treatment failure ) calculate cohort patient `` GPS treatment concordant '' , `` GPS treatment discordant '' , `` match control '' . The time compare use standard statistical analysis . 6 . The total cost care three treatment cohort also compare . 7 . Subjects must possess medical insurance coverage Horizon Blue Cross Blue Shield New Jersey order participate . A maximum 160 patient sample test .</detailed_description>
