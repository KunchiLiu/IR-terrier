	<detailed_description>Introduction : C5 palsy ( C5P ) well-known , although rare complication cervical spine decompression surgery.1,2 In severe form , C5P cause debilitate upper extremity weakness involve deltoid and/or biceps brachii muscle , ultimately diminish patient ' quality life.3 Furthermore , half patient C5P present sensory deficit and/or intractable pain addition muscle weakness.5 Fortunately , almost case C5P present unilaterally . The deficit typically quantify diagnosed use patient 's manual muscle test ( MMT ) score ( rating 0-5 ) . The American Medical Association impairment rating guide grade MMT follow : Grade 0 = perceptible muscle contraction ; Grade 1 = muscle contraction palpable , motion ; Grade 2 = motion part gravity reduce ; Grade 3 = muscle hold part test position gravity alone ; Grade 4 = patient move part full range active motion `` '' resistance ; Grade 5 = patient move part full active range motion `` full '' resistance . C5P define : reduction least 1 deltoid and/or biceps brachii score compare preoperative score , without deterioration myelopathic symptoms.5 Although uniform understanding etiology mechanism C5P yet establish , certain hypothesis gain recognition . One prominent hypothesis , call tethering phenomenon , suggest follow decompression , posterior shift cord produce traction nerve root result nerve root lesion . Other , less agree upon hypothesis include : inadvertent injury nerve root surgery , spinal cord ischemia , segmental spinal cord disorder , reperfusion injury spinal cord . As pathogenesis C5P uncover , concert effort minimize incidence unfortunate complication undertaken.5 Prophylactic bilateral foraminotomy C5 level cervical decompression surgery study recently hope minimize risk develop C5 nerve root palsy postoperatively.6,7,8 Although current literature provide support claim , insufficient data establish technique proven measure reduce incidence C5P . In present study , seek evaluate effect bilateral foraminotomy postoperative C5P incidence rate . Background : Komagata et al.7 perform retrospective study investigate preoperative risk factor may cause postoperative C5P . The study include 305 case cervical expansive laminoplasty perform spondylotic myelopathy ossification posterior longitudinal ligament . No specific risk factor find associate high incidence C5P . However , bilateral partial foraminotomy find effective preventing C5P , C5P occur 1 gutter ( 0.6 % ) foraminotomy group 12 gutter ( 4.0 % ) non-foraminotomy group ( p &lt; 0.05 ) . Interestingly , preoperative anatomical measurement suggest correlate risk develop C5P . Lubelski et al.9 perform retrospective study determine whether postoperative C5P predict preoperative antero-posterior diameter ( APD ) , foraminal diameter ( FD ) , and/or cord-lamina angle ( CLA ) . 98 consecutive patient underwent either anterior posterior decompression surgery C4-C5 spondylotic myelopathy analyze . It find every 1-mm increase APD FD , odds develop palsy decrease 69 % ( p &lt; 0.01 ) decrease 98 % ( p &lt; 0.01 ) , respectively . In contrast , every 1-degree increase CLA , odds develop palsy increase 43 % ( p &lt; 0.01 ) . Furthermore , Lubelski et al . use three preoperative parameter - APD , FD , CLA - create nomogram predicts probability patient develop C5 palsy . This nomogram investigate validity current study . Preliminary Studies : In addition study mention , several author demonstrate efficacy prophylactic C5 foraminotomy laminoplasty prevent postoperative C5P . Sasai et al.7 perform first prospective study use microcervical foraminotomy ( MCF ) cervical laminoplasty prophylactic measure prevent C5P . MCF use selectively patient EMG abnormality ( Group A ) , decrease incidence postoperative C5P compare group EMG study MCF perform ( Group B ) . No patient Group A three patient Group B experience postoperative C5P ( 0 % vs. 8.1 % ; p=0.035 ) . No adverse outcomes report study . Based result , author suggest preexist subclinical C5 root compression cause C5P posterior cervical decompression myelopathy . In 2012 , Katsumi et al.5 perform prospective , non-randomized study analyze whether bilateral C5 foraminotomy prevent C5P open-door laminoplasty . Prophylactic bilateral foraminotomy do 141 consecutive patient see significantly decrease incidence postoperative C5P compare control group ( 1.4 % 6.4 % , respectively ; p &lt; 0.05 ) . These result support hypothesis preoperative C5 foraminal stenosis associate high risk C5P . Furthermore , finding consistent tether phenomenon hypothesis regard pathomechanism C5P . The two patient study develop C5P undergoing prophylactic foraminotomy receive meticulous decompression C5 nerve root , leave residual superior articular process . No patient either group experience postoperative infection durotomy . Although average operative time longer foraminotomy group ( 102 minute 129 minute , p &lt; 0.01 ) , significant difference intraoperative blood loss two group . In order well elucidate true effect bilateral C5 foraminotomy , procedure must perform uniformly randomize patient include . With current literature provide evidence suggest efficacy prophylactic bilateral C5 foraminotomies reduce incidence postoperative C5P , remain need randomize , prospective study investigate foraminotomy potentially beneficial procedure patient undergoing cervical decompression . Significance Proposed Study Bilateral foraminotomy correlate reduce risk develop C5P follow cervical decompression surgery , identical foraminotomy procedure never apply randomized manner qualify patient study.5,6,7 Additionally , prophylactic foraminotomy prospectively study laminoplasty . In proposed study , bilateral foraminotomy randomize patient receive cervical decompression surgery ( laminoplasty , laminectomy , fusion ) . Subsequently , incidence C5P well surgical complication monitor determine efficacy prophylactic C5 bilateral foraminotomy cervical decompression . Research Procedures : Patients undergo cervical decompression surgery consent enrolled meet inclusion exclusion criterion detail . The EPIC Electronic Medical Record database query retrieve medical record consistent study sample determine cervical decompression surgery . Patients ' sex , race , date birth , BMI , medical comorbidities , medication , history spinal trauma surgical intervention , smoke status/ history , spinal level involve , type surgery , operate surgeon , length hospital stay , operative time , blood loss , in-hospital complication note patient complication follow surgery obtain . Additionally , preoperative anteroposterior diameter spinal canal C4-C5 , ipsilateral foraminal diameter C4-C5 , morphological relationship spinal cord ipsilateral lamina ( cord-lamina angle ) obtain . Clinical outcome measure analyze use standard statistical method . Intervention : In addition decompression technique indicate directly treatment cervical myelopathy , bilateral keyhole foraminotomies do prophylactically attempt minimize postoperative complication , specifically C5 Palsy . Under microscopic loop magnification , high-speed burr use perform foraminotomy . The keyhole foraminotomy begin lamina-facet junction , careful consideration amount facet resection . Typically , medial one third drill . Then 1- 2-mm Kerrison punch carefully place nerve root use undercut facet , ensure spine destabilize foraminotomy . The amount facet resection must exceed 50 % order preserve spine stability . Consent : All patient enrol completion attach informed consent form . All patient ' information prospective study treat confidential . This study involve risk physician , OR staff . A cervical foraminotomy common , short procedure ( e.g . 5 minute ) involve make room cervical nerve root exit spinal column . It procedure surgeon perform routinely , way put patient risk spine structural problem . Similarly , impart additional measurable risk patient neurological injury infection risk already incur patient index procedure . Patients age 18 exclude previously mention scientific reason . Women minority expect participate proportionally number diagnose cervical myelopathy .</detailed_description>
