	<detailed_description>Aim study investigate effect increase intrarenal pressure flexible ureteroscopy renal blood flow . Patients undergo flexible ureteroscopy laser lithotripsy kidney stone accord EAU guideline Urolithiasis include study sign informed consent form . The pre- post-operative evaluation management perform accord EAU Guidelines Urolithiasis . Additionally , non-invasive test , bilateral renal power Doppler US perform patient pre- post-operatively . The pre-operative Doppler US perform 2 day prior surgery post-operative Doppler US perform first 24 hour follow surgery . The change blood flow renal artery arcuate artery record . Flexible ureteroscopy key component kidney stone management last 20 year . Even stone large 2 cm , flexible ureteroscopy perform high success low complication rate . Ureteral access sheath key contributor flexible ureteroscopy provide easy repeat access upper urinary tract decrease intrarenal pressure due easy flow back irrigation solution . The increased pressure flexible ureteroscopy important research area last year . Due irrigation solution irrigational pumping provide clear vision flexible ureteroscopy , intrarenal pressure rise certain point pyelo-sinusoidal , pyelo-venous pyelo-lymphatic backflow start . It show backflow start pressure rise 40 cmH2O ( centimeters-water / unit pressure measurement ) . Schwalb et al . demonstrate study kidney subject high intrarenal pressure , denudation flatten caliceal urothelium , submucosal edema congestion observe . Due deleterious effect urothelium , renal extravasation bacterial translocation occur complication may arise . Renal Doppler US , due non-invasive nature , widely use measure localize blood flow kidney , evaluate hemodynamic parameter acute kidney injury . Intrarenal backflow consequence submucosal edema congestion may decrease blood flow especially around calyx subject high pressure situation may result acute kidney injury .</detailed_description>
