	<brief_title>Cytoreductive Surgery Combined With HIPEC Chemotherapy Gastric Cancer With Peritoneal Metastasis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Peritoneal metastasis one frequent non-curable factor advance gastric cancer poor prognosis , median survival time patient less 1 year even bad China . Recently , several new modality develop report improve survival , include new chemotherapeutic agent , molecular target agent hyperthermic intraperitoneal chemotherapy（HIPEC）.Still , long-term outcome base multicenter randomized clinical trial ( RCTs ) await . The surgical approach metastatic lesion prove play crucial role prolong survival metastatic colorectal patient , might able cure patient operation aim R0 resection . For patient metastatic gastric cancer , surgical intervention primary tumor measurable metastatic lesion technically feasible , survival benefit controversial . Even though REGATTA trial demonstrate removal primary tumor necessarily beneficial , role operation aim R0 resection combine new regimen like HIPEC new chemotherapeutic agent still confuse new category classification metastatic gastric cancer base treatment response need . In order evaluate survival benefit safety cytoreductive surgery ( CRS ) HIPEC begin chemotherapy gastric cancer peritoneal metastasis , patient fulfill inclusion exclusion criterion recruit study randomize two treatment group ( A B ) . Patients group A receive CRS , HIPEC chemotherapy . Group B receive chemotherapy alone . Chemotherapy regimen base cisplatin fluorouracil ( CF ) recommend group . Patients follow 2 year survival outcome analyze .</detailed_description>
