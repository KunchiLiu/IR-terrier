	<brief_title>Etoposide , Prednisone , Vincristine Sulfate , Cyclophosphamide , Doxorubicin Treating Patients With Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia Lymphoblastic Lymphoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To examine potential efficacy DA-EPOCH front-line therapy adult acute lymphoblastic leukemia/lymphoma ( ALL ) . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . To evaluate safety feasibility regimen . II . To evaluate progression-free ( PFS ) overall survival ( OS ) patient receive DA-EPOCH newly-diagnosed ALL . III . To explore novel genetic/genomic biomarkers prognosis response treatment adult ALL . IV . To compare outcomes predict presence absence minimal residual disease ( MRD ) determine either multiparameter flow cytometry ( MFC ) high-throughput sequencing ( HTS ) . OUTLINE : Patients receive etoposide intravenously ( IV ) 96 hour , doxorubicin IV 96 hour , vincristine sulfate IV 96 hour day 1-4 . Patients also receive cyclophosphamide IV 1 hour day 5 prednisone orally ( PO ) twice day ( BID ) day 1-5 . Patients Philadelphia Chromosome positive ( Ph+ ) also receive imatinib mesylate dasatinib PO per day ( QD ) day 1-14 . Patients CD20+ also receive rituximab IV day 1 day 5 . Courses repeat every 21 day 8 course absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . After completion study treatment , patient follow every 3 month 2 year every 6 month 3 year .</detailed_description>
