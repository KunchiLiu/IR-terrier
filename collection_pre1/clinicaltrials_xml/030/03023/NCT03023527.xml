	<brief_summary>This open-label , non-randomized Phase 1 study evaluate role two regimen : A ) Nivolumab combination Pomalidomide low dose dexamethasone B ) Nivolumab + Elotuzumab + Pomalidomide + dexamethasone treatment relapse refractory multiple myeloma patient . The study perform 10 site Spain . First , MTD Nivo-Pom-Dex combination determine use 3+3 scheme . Once MTD determine Regimes ( A B ) open full accrual patient include alternate way regime simultaneously . In case unacceptable toxicity see Lead-in phase ( Nivolumab + Pomalidomide + low dose dexamethasone ) , phase would open . A safety analysis internal review committee perform first six patient include regimen B complete first two cycle . The main purpose study analyze proportion subject , refractory relapse multiple myeloma , receive combination Nivo-Pom-dex Nivo-Pom-dex-Elo experience one haematological non haematological SAE ( grade 3 high ) . Additionally , Research Hypothesis : The combination nivolumab pomalidomide dexamethasone demonstrate adequate safety tolerability permit test combination subject multiple myeloma . The addition elotuzumab nivolumab , pomalidomide dexamethasone change safety profile . Duration Study : The study remain open enrolment 15 month ( estimate ) , plan total number 40 subject reach happens first . The follow-up last recruited patient 3 year , Final analyse perform 1,5 year last patient include . Study Population : Male female adult patient Multiple Myeloma first subsequent relapse , previously expose proteasome inhibitor IMID ( Lenalidomide ) . Patients may expose , relapse refractory Lenalidomide .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Test Product , Dose Mode Administration , Duration Treatment : The study use modify 3+3 design 2 part . First ( Lead-In phase ) , MTD Nivo-Pom-dex combination determine : Regimen A : The treatment regimen include Pomalidomide , Nivolumab low dose dexamethasone . There three different dose level : - First dose level ( DL1 ) : Nivolumab 240mg intravenous infusion , every week ; Pomalidomide standard dose 4 mg/day day 1 21 28-day cycle Dexamethasone 40mg weekly except patient older 75 comorbidities receive 20 mg weekly . Initially , 3 patient enrol treat . If DLT , 3 additional patient include dose level . - In case DLT , dose level de-escalated . - If DLT haematological non-hematological attributable Pomalidomide , dose level DL-1P ( Pomalidomide 2 mg/d day 1-21 , Nivolumab 240mg every week Dexamethasone 40mg weekly 20 weekly patient older 75 comorbidities . - In case DLT non-hematological , attributable Nivolumab , combination arm stop . No Nivolumab dose reduction allow trial . Once MTD determine , regimens A B open full accrual patient include alternate way regimens simultaneously . Regimen B : The treatment regimen include Pomalidomide Nivolumab select dose level previous arm study . Dexamethasone give standard dose 40mg weekly day 1 , 8 , 15 22 28-day cycle could reduce 20mg weekly case age 75 year-old comorbidities . Elotuzumab give standard dose 10mg/kg weekly first two cycle , day 1 15 subsequent cycle . Treatment maintain disease progression . Criteria Evaluation : - Safety : Adverse event assess continuously study 100 day last treatment . Adverse event cod use current version MedDRA review potential significance importance . Adverse event evaluate accord NCI CTCAE Version 4.0 . Subjects follow treatment related adverse event recover grade ≤ 1 baseline , deem irreversible investigator . Safety assessment base medical review adverse event report result vital sign measurement , ECGs , physical examination , clinical laboratory test . - Efficacy : Disease assessment perform serum urine myeloma lab test , bone marrow assessment compute tomography ( CT ) and/or magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) , appropriate . Myeloma response base investigator assessment determine define IMWG criterion . Any initial assessment confirm repeat evaluation every 4 week . - Biomarker Assessments : Peripheral blood bone marrow sample collect subject assess mechanism primary resistance ( cell surface protein analyse transcriptome analysis ) mechanisms chemosensitivity NivoPomDex combination ( 10-colour flow cytometry , TCR clonality NGS ) .</detailed_description>
