	<brief_title>Intra-individual Open-label , Single Center Study Compare Unenhanced MRI With Dotarem Enhanced MRI</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Phoenix Children 's Hospital ( PCH ) perform approximately 200 contrast enhance MRI procedure per month . Recently PCH change MRI contrast agent linear contrast agent Magnevist macrocyclic contrast agent Dotarem . The goal study evaluate safety efficacy Dotarem enhance MRI pediatric neonatal population refer contrast enhance MRI PCH . The study design single center , open label comparison unenhanced MRI Dotarem enhance MRI pediatric patient population ( &lt; 18years ) . The comparison perform intra-individually 3 independent blind radiologist . Overall , study population consist 250 pediatric patient indicate contrast enhance MRI . The safety follow-up period 24 ( +/- 4 ) hour post injection Dotarem include assessment physical examination vital sign well assessment AEs .</detailed_description>
