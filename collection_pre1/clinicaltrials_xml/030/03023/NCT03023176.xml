	<brief_title>T-cell And General Immune Response Seasonal Influenza Vaccine ( SLVP018 ) Year 5 , 2013</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The investigator plan study immune response different influenza vaccine much broadly deeply across different age group different vaccine modality probe influence genetics response use monozygotic dizygotic twin . The investigator plan compare various immunological response , identify age-specific biomarkers cluster marker , quantify frequency influenza-specific T-cells pre- post-vaccination , determine effective breadth T-cell repertoire influenza vaccine within individual function age degree genetically determine . The study conduct healthy young identical fraternal 1-8 year-old twin . All participant immunize seasonal trivalent inactivate influenza vaccine ( IIV3 ) . Blood sample conduct assay describe take pre-immunization , Days 6-8 28 post-immunization child require 1 dose vaccine . For child require 2 dos vaccine , second immunization give least 28 day Dose 1 response measure Day 6-8 Day 28-32 post-second immunization . Children 35 month receive Fluzone® standard IIV3 Pediatric Dose , child 36 month old receive Fluzone® standard IIV3 .</detailed_description>
