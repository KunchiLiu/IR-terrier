	<brief_title>Analysis Training Intervention Pulmonary Embolism Diagnosis Emergency Department ( APEED )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The Hospital de la Santa Creu Sant Pau Emergency Department ( ED ) implement train program May June 2015 improve compliance adherence recommend clinical practice optimize diagnosis management patient suspect Pulmonary Embolism ( PE ) . The training program standardize , systematic continuous , subsequent reinforcement ensure implementation . This paper aim evaluate clinical impact train intervention . The establishment training measure improve adherence guideline implies clinical practice improvement benefit patient health system . Moreover , simple inexpensive intervention , easily reproduce ED . All adult patient ( &lt; 18 ) suspect pulmonary embolism attend Emergency Department include . Retrospective information two different period ( train intervention ) collect . First period : 1/1/2012 - 31/12/2012 second Period : 01.06.2015 - 30/11/2015 , pre post intervention . OBJECTIVES A . Primary : 1 . Analyze adherence guideline evaluation suspect PE ED . 2 . Determine clinical impact train intervention ( change adherence guideline train measure among staff Emergency Department ) 3 . Implementation consolidation systematic , standardize , continuous train intervention improve process result . B.- Secondary 1 . Analyze PE case ( presentation , clinical feature , treatment , clinical evolution ) 2. analyze clinical difference three subgroup patient PE : young patient ( &lt; 50 year ) , elderly patient ( &lt; 65 year ) cancer 3 . Analyze value D-dimmer correct age diagnostic algorithm 4 . Analyze result new algorithm ( EPC + Dimmer correct age ) elderly population group ( &lt; 65 year ) .</detailed_description>
