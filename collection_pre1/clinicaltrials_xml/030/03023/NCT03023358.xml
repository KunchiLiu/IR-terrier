	<detailed_description>Peripheral T-cell lymphoma ( PTCL ) heterogeneous group lymphoproliferative disorder arise mature T-cells post-thymic origin . PTCL represent relatively uncommon group hematologic malignancy within non-Hodgkin lymphoma ( NHL ) , account 10 % NHL case . The prognosis PTCL remain poor comparison B-cell NHL . This largely due low response rate less durable response standard combination chemotherapy regimens CHOP . Progress hamper relative rarity biological heterogeneity disease . Among PTCL case worldwide , common subtypes include PTCL-not otherwise specify ( PTCL-NOS ; 26 % ) , angioimmunoblastic T-cell lymphoma ( AITL ; 18.5 % ) , NK/T-cell lymphoma ( 10 % ) , adult T-cell leukemia/lymphoma ( ATLL ; 10 % ) , ALK-positive anaplastic large cell lymphoma ( ALCL ; 7 % ) ALK-negative ALCL ( 6 % ) ; subtypes enteropathy-associated T-cell lymphoma ( EATL ; &lt; 5 % ) primary cutaneous ALCL relatively rare ( &lt; 2 % ) ALCL common NK/T ATLL United States . PTCLs less responsive less frequent durable remission standard chemotherapy regimens CHOP thus carry poor prognosis compare diffuse large B-cell lymphoma . In prospective randomized study , PTCLs include aggressive B-cell lymphoma . However , possible assess impact chemotherapy subgroup patient PTCLs due small sample size . Only limited data exist randomized trial compare efficacy chemotherapy regimens exclusively patient PTCL . CHOP chemotherapy commonly use first-line regimen patient PTCL . However , exception ALK+ ALCL , outcomes disappointing compare favorable result achieve DLBCL . Chemotherapy regimens intensive CHOP show significant improvement OS patient PTCL , exception ALCL . CHOP chemotherapy frequently curative small number patient favorable prognostic feature . As previously discuss , retrospective analysis International T-cell Lymphoma Project show anthracycline-based chemotherapy favorably impact survival patient common form PTCLs , namely PTCL-NOS AITL . In retrospective study conduct British Columbia cancer agency , 5-year OS rate patient PTCL-NOS primarily treat CHOP CHOP-like regimens 35 % ; among patient , 5-year OS rate higher patient low-risk IPI score compare high-risk IPI score ( 64 % vs. 22 % , respectively ) . In addition , patient ALK-positive ALCL superior clinical outcome compare ALK-negative ALCL ( 5-year OS 58 % vs. 34 % , respectively ) . The addition etoposide CHOP ( CHOEP regimen ) compare CHOP alone evaluate randomize study German High-grade NHL Study Group ( DSHNHL ) . In relatively young patient favorable prognosis aggressive NHL ( age â‰¤60 year ; normal LDH level ) , CHOEP regimen result significantly high CR rate ( 88 % vs. 79 % ; P=0.003 ) 5-year EFS rate ( 69 % vs. 58 % ; P=0.004 ) . No difference observe OS outcome regimens . It also note study , majority patient B-cell histology , 14 % diagnose T-cell NHL ( 12 % patient ALCL , PTCL-NOS , AITL histology ) .36 In analysis large cohort patient PTCL treat within DSHNHL trial , patient ALK- positive ALCL favorable outcome CHOP CHOP etoposide ( CHOEP ) . Three-year EFS OS rate 76 % 90 % , respectively , patient ALK-positive ALCL . The corresponding outcome 50 % 67.5 % , respectively , AITL , 46 % 62 % , respectively , ALK-negative ALCL 41 % 54 % , respectively , PTCL-NOS . Among T-cell lymphoma , CHOEP associate trend improve EFS among relatively young patient ( age &lt; 60 year ) option patient . CHOP-21 appear standard regimen patient age &gt; 60 year , give addition etoposide provide advantage old patient due increase toxicity . Among patient ALK-negative ALCL , AITL PTCL-NOS , low-risk IPI score ( IPI &lt; 1 ) relatively favorable prognosis ; contrastingly , patient high risk IPI score derive minimal benefit CHOP CHOEP . Histone deacetylases ( HDACs ) involve remodel chromatin play key role epigenetic regulation gene expression . HDACs act transcription repressor remove acetyl group e-amino- terminus lysine residue within histone promote tight wind DNA around histone protein . Elevated expression activity HDACs implicate development progression cancer . Inhibition HDAC enzymes result increase histone acetylation , thereby induce open chromatin conformation transcription previously dormant gene . At least 18 human HDACs identify group four class . HDAC enzymes class I ( HDAC1 , 2 , 3 , 8 ) , class II ( HDAC4 , 5 , 7 , 9 IIa , HDAC6 10 IIb ) , class IV ( HDAC11 ) utilize zinc-catalyzed mechanism deacetylation histones non-histone protein , whereas class III ( SIRT 1-7 ) HDACs NAD+ dependent deacetylase enzymes . Although precise biological function individual HDACs still largely unknown , importance HDAC enzymes malignant phenotype closely associated Class I HDACs 1-3 . In addition , Class IIb HDACs 6 10 find play role expression stability tumor angiogenesis gene product . The synthesis small-molecule HDAC inhibitor ( HDACi ) active focus field anticancer drug discovery recent year . Several different chemical class HDACi describe , include hydroxamic acid , carboxylic short-chain fatty acid , cyclic peptide , benzamides . Examples class enter clinical development antitumor agent . Among , hydroxamic acid vorinostat ( SAHA ) cyclic peptide romidepsin ( FK-228 ) approve United States treatment cutaneous T-cell lymphoma , recently , romidepsin peripheral T-cell lymphoma . chidamide ( CS055/HBI-8000 ) , new member benzamide class HDACi . Chidamide inhibit HDAC1 , 2 , 3 , 10 low nanomolar concentration range broad spectrum antitumor activity vitro vivo . Mechanism study demonstrate chidamide stimulates human immune cell-mediated tumor cell kill activity increase expression gene protein involve natural killer ( NK ) cell function . Chidamide find low nanomolar inhibitor HDAC1 , 2 , 3 , 10 , HDAC isotypes well document associate malignant phenotype . Significant broad spectrum vitro vivo anti- tumor activity , include wide therapeutic index , observe . Chidamide also show enhance cytotoxic effect human peripheral mononuclear cell ex vivo K562 target cell , accompany upregulation protein involve NK cell function . Furthermore , expression number gene involve immune cell- mediate antitumor activity observe upregulated peripheral white blood cell two T-cell lymphoma patient respond chidamide administration .</detailed_description>
