	<detailed_description>Premature infant parent prone high anxiety level risk experience trauma due preterm birth implication . Facing various emotional physical neural high-risk factor may lead continuous stress reaction infant parent , affect well , parent-infant relationship infant 's medical state outcome . Attending infant ' emotional physiological need stability comfort , well parent ' support , lead improvement premature infant ' medical state parent-infant bonding process . Furthermore , reduce stress reaction facilitate perceptual memory learn premature infant . Two well establish intervention neonatal care aim address vary premature-family need Kangaroo care ( KC ) Music Therapy ( MT ) . Various research clinical report last three decade , regard modality , show beneficial effect improvement stabilization infant ' medical state , inclusion parent infant ' treatment facilitation meaningful parent-infant interaction promote bonding pattern . However , major lack rigorous Randomized control study present clinical application MT technique method NICU care exist , well research position parent center investigation , and/or present outcome perspective . Accordingly , research investigate combination MT KC RCT . The current study investigate combination two modality mixed-methods design , order provide comprehensive knowledge regard effect family-centered MT KC , premature-infants ' autonomic nervous system stability ( measure parasympathetic tone , physiological vital sign behavioral state ) ; Parents ' anxiety level ; And parent ' unique experience intervention .
