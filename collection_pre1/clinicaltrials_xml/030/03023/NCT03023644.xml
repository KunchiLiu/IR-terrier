	<brief_summary>Each year , approximately 1 child every 100 bear Congenital Heart Disease ( CHD ) , make common birth defect . With recent medical advance , child CHD survive early open-heart surgery , 2 3 million adult survivor CHD . These survivor face challenge term cognitive behavioral development . For many , limitation affect academic achievement , social adaption , ultimately , quality life . Among disable limitation pertain ability maintain attention , plan organize activity , regulate emotion , develop problem-solving strategy . Collectively , refer executive function ( EF ) higher-order ability enable one coordinate complex behavior . Additionally , impair EF also underlie mental health disorder . In spite abundance evidence child CHD struggle EF , little offer way evidence-based intervention prevent mitigate problem . The investigator propose conduct first randomize trial evaluate efficacy intervention , Cogmed Working Memory Program , improve neurodevelopmental outcome child critical CHD infant open-heart surgery . Children meet eligibility criterion agree participate randomly assign intervention control group . Children intervention group complete 25 35-40 minute session Cogmed training , spread 5 week . This Program set home-based , child-friendly , computerized activity . The control group receive standard care child CHD . Children 's score EF relate neurodevelopmental test evaluate intervention group complete Cogmed training , conclusion training , 3 month later . The latter assessment indicate whether gain EF skill child intervention group sustain training . Parents teacher also complete questionnaires child 's EF , attention , social behavior determine whether train affect behavior intervention group home school . The investigator also identify medical surgical characteristic child benefit Cogmed training . This information helpful target intervention efficiently future .</brief_summary>
