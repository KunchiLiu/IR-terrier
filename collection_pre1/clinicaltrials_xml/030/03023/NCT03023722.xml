	<brief_summary>The primary objective study : -Test activity/response rate per RECIST 1.1 criterion anetumab ravtansine patient advance pancreatic cancer stain mesothelin expression The secondary objective study : - Time Progression ( TTP ) define time study treatment RECIST 1.1 progression , death ( others go study censor ) - Toxicity pancreatic cancer patient ( 6.5 mg/kg dose )</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Phase II Anetumab Ravtansine 2nd Line Treatment Pancreatic Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This non-randomized , open-label , multicenter , Phase II study evaluate efficacy safety intravenous anetumab ravtansine ( BAY 94-9343 ) , anti-mesothelin antibody drug conjugate , pretreated mesothelin-expressing advanced pancreatic cancer . At time start study treatment , patient pretreated advanced pancreatic cancer also overexpresses mesothelin determine immunohistochemistry ( IHC ) . A maximum 30 patient enrol minimax , Simon 2-stage design single early stopping rule lack efficacy . The target population patient pancreatic cancer fail earlier treatment . All patient treat anti-mesothelin immuno-conjugate , single arm , non-randomized trial patient treat least one dose Anetumab include . The endpoint response use RECIST 1.1 criterion .</detailed_description>
