	<brief_title>Protective Mechanisms Against Pandemic Respiratory Virus ( SLVP024 )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The objective protocol investigate human innate adaptive immune response blood ( adult ) nasopharyngeal mucosa resident cell live , attenuated influenza vaccine ( LAIV ) adults child . The investigator hope learn upper respiratory tract ( URT ) epithelial cell , primary target respiratory virus , B cell T cell , two major component immune system , respond influenza vaccine . The volunteer enrol two age group : Group A : Up 12 healthy non-twin volunteer , 2-8 year old , give seasonal LAIV . Each volunteer complete total 3 visit . Volunteers divide 2 sub-groups A-1 ( n=6 ) A-2 ( n= 6 ) order collect nasopharyngeal swab different schedule ( Day 1 Day 2 ) . Volunteers assign sub-groups base convenience sampling . Both sub-groups complete Day 0 Day 28 visit one visit either Day 1 Day 2 post-immunization . Specimens include nasopharyngeal swab collect Day 1 Sub-group A1 Day 2 Sub-group A-2 , Day 28 sub-groups . No blood sample collect age group . Children prior influenza vaccine history receive second dose vaccine ( LAIV ) least 28 day first study dose , accord ACIP guideline . Group B : Up 18 healthy non-twin volunteer , 18-49 yr old , give seasonal LAIV vaccine . Each volunteer complete total 5 visit . Volunteers divide 3 sub-groups B-1 , B-2 B-3 order collect nasopharyngeal swabs blood specimen different schedule ( Day 0-6 hr , Day 1 Day 2 ) . Volunteers assign sub-groups base convenience sample . All sub-groups complete visit Day -7 , Day 0 pre-immunization , Day 7 Day 28 1 additional time point : Sub-group B-1 Day 0 , 6 hour post-immunization , Sub-group B-2 Day 1 Sub-group B-3 Day 2 . A nasopharyngeal swab collect visit except Day 0 ( baseline ) Day 7 . A blood sample collect visit except Day -7</detailed_description>
