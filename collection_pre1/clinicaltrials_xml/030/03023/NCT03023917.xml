	<brief_title>The Study Umbilical Cord Milking Prevent Decrease Severity Anemia Preterms</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Anemia significant problem pre-term infant major risk factor preterm baby mortality morbidity neonatal intensive care unit ( NICU ) . majority pre-term baby require one blood transfusion NICU . Blood transfusion safe procedure like therapeutic intervention risk associated effort make reduce number transfusion infant require stay neonatal unit . Delayed cord clamp beneficial effect prevention anemia later infancy increase iron store birth . However controversy incorporate delay cord clamp practice management third stage labour globally . Concerning need urgent resuscitation temperature management , attendant encourage clamp umbilical cord immediately post-natal resuscitation care start soon possible.However , umbilical cord milking allow swift intervention resuscitation attention thermal care take less 10 second complete . The specific aim study investigate effect umbilical cord milk prevent decrease anemia pre-term infant . Primary : To study effect umbilical cord milk hemoglobin ( Hb ) , Hematocrit ( Hct ) ferritin birth , seventh day three month age . Secondary : To study effect umbilical cord milk short term clinical profile neonate like jaundice , polycythemia etc . To evaluate number blood transfusion 3 month correct gestational age ( CGA ) , To assess preterm infant complication lung function assess oxygen dependency 36 week correct gestational age ( CGA ) , cardiovascular function assess need volume expansion , inotropes , clinically suspect patent ductus arteriosus ( PDA ) require intervention prior discharge home , incidence intraventricular hemorrhage late-onset sepsis , etc .</detailed_description>
