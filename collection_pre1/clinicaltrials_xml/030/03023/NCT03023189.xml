	<brief_summary>Upper digestive bleeding Upper gastrointestinal haemorrhage common cause cirrhosis 's decompensation associate high mortality rate among cirrhotic patient . Its leading cause rupture gastro-esophageal varix due portal hypertension . In cirrhotic patient , management acute gastrointestinal haemorrhage challenge often present coagulation ( haemostasis abnormality ) abnormality hyperfibrinolysis , especially cirrhosis decompensated . Beyond life support measure , therapeutic modality variceal bleed rely endoscopic pharmacological intervention . Tranexamic acid ( TA ) antifibrinolytic may help control bleed setting , show unquestionable benefit indication . TA previously study upper gastrointestinal haemorrhage cause liver transplantation cirrhotic patient . However , lack data conclude effectiveness ( efficiency ) early treatment acute variceal bleed cirrhotic patient . Investigators hypothesize , give early , TA would beneficial cirrhotic patient present acute Upper gastrointestinal haemorrhage , control haemorrhage , avoid rebleeding episode reduce mortality within 5 day administration . Moreover , TA could prevent early cirrhosis complication ( hepatic encephalopathy , sepsis ascites liquid infection , hepatorenal syndrome ) , could reduce indication transjugular portosystemic shunt ( TIPS ) , shorten length stay intensive care unit length hospitalization , decrease late relapse one-year mortality .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Acute Upper gastrointestinal haemorrhage ( UGIH ) frequent , estimate annual incidence 150/100 000 France . Its second aetiology rupture portal hypertension-related gastro-oesophageal varix , count 20 % patient responsible 50 % hospitalization intensive care unit ( ICU ) UGIH . In cirrhotic patient , variceal bleed main cause UGIH ( 70 % ) death ( 30 % ) , occur severe patient ( Child-Pugh score B C and/or high MELD score , high level portal hypertension ) . Acute UGIH directly responsible 50 % death , either remain uncontrolled acute phase ( within 5 day ) , early relapse ( within 6 week ) . Every episode acute UGIH worsen middle long-term vital prognosis : 60 % patient present UGIH recurrence within one year 30 % alive 3 year first episode . Moreover , acute UGIH trigger factor several severe cirrhosis-specific complication ( hepatic encephalopathy , sepsis ascites liquid infection , hepatorenal syndrome ) , lead high mortality rate . Despite improvement preventive , diagnostic therapeutic strategy , portal hypertension-related UGIH ( PHT-UGIH ) remain stable France . The haemostasis cirrhotic patient often abnormal baseline : thrombopenia , decrease factor II , V , VII , IX , X XI , decrease fibrinolytic protein , increase factor VIII , spontaneous fibrinolysis . When compensate , cirrhotic 's haemostasis remain globally preserve , due balance pro anticoagulant alteration . It seem baseline coagulopathy directly responsible acute PHT-UGIH , could surrogate marker PHT severity . However , every cause cirrhosis decompensation , acute PHT-UGIH , increase haemostatic disorder , lead hyperfibrinolysis . This could slow inhibit clotting , thus disrupt pharmacological control acute PHT-UGIH . TA could efficient acute PHT-UGIHof cirrhotic patient . It simple antifibrinolytic show clinical benefit haemorrhage and/or mortality several indication ( surgical , obstetrical traumatic ) . It widely use accord recommendation . Early administration TA seem beneficial UGIH haemorrhage . Despite theoretical efficiency , 4 recent Cochrane meta-analysis conclude lack significant data ( poor overall trial quality ) . The benefit use TA acute UGIH ( acute PHT-UGIH ) remain uncertain . At day , TA still study acute PHT-UGIH cirrhotic patient , although show benefit blood transfusion 's requirement haemorrhagic complication liver transplantation ( frequent cause cirrhosis ) .</detailed_description>
