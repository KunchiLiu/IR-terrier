	<brief_summary>Over year , numerous surgical technique free autograft pedicle graft introduce correct gingival recession defect . Combination graft either autografts allograft , new concept guide tissue regeneration ( GTR ) , platelet concentrate , etc. , develop recently correct mucogingival defect . The use PRF various surgical procedure degree II furcation , intrabony defect , sinus floor segmentation implant placement facial plastic surgery show promising result . However knowledge , till study complete , study report clinical outcome autologous platelet rich fibrin membrane treatment localize gingival recession defect . Hence , study design compare coronally advanced flap platelet rich fibrin membrane versus subepithelial connective tissue graft treatment Miller 's Class I Class II gingival recession defect .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Coronally Advanced Flap With Connective Tissue Graft PRF Recession Coverage</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The study design consist twenty site ten patient randomly select toss coin study , divide test group ( Root coverage perform coronally advanced flap platelet rich fibrin membrane ) Control group ( Root coverage perform coronal advanced flap subepithelial connective tissue graft . ) The Surgical Procedure consist ) Preparation recipient bed : After adequate anesthesia , trapezoidal flap design use three incision follow reflection partial thickness flap raise apical crest osseous dehiscence . A periosteal releasing incision give enable coronal advancement flap . Following , root plan do mesial distal interdental papilla deepithelialized . The exposed root surface condition tetracycline hydrochloride four min . ( The tetracycline hydrochloride powder mixed saline dappen dish apply root surface ) . In test group , preparation PRF carry , flap coronally position membrane completely cover secure non resorbable suture . The surgical area cover non - eugenol periodontal dress post-operative antibiotic analgesic post-operative instruction give patient . In control group , connective tissue graft harvest carry followed placement connective tissue graft recipient site . The connective tissue graft place recipient site secure position vicryl suture . The flap coronally position connective tissue graft secure non resorbable suture . The recipient bed cover non-eugenol periodontal dress post-operative antibiotic analgesic post- operative instruction give patient .</detailed_description>
