	<brief_title>Nivolumab Treating Patients With Stage IV Recurrent Lung Cancer With High Mutation Loads</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To assess objective response rate use Response Evaluation Criteria Solid Tumors ( RECIST ) 1.1 criterion . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . To assess progression-free survival ( PFS ) . II . To assess overall survival ( OS ) . III . To correlate response mutation load PD-L1 status ( 5 % 1 % cutoff ) . IV . To assess clinical benefit ( responses stable disease last &gt; = 6 month ) . V. To assess response rate mutation-defined subgroup , include subject &gt; = 25 mutations/mutational burden ( MB ) &gt; = 30 mutations/MB . VI . To correlate type mutation response . OUTLINE : Patients receive nivolumab intravenously ( IV ) 30 minute day 1 . Courses repeat every 2 week 2 year ( 104 week ) absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . After completion study treatment , patient follow 35 day every 3 month 2 year .</detailed_description>
