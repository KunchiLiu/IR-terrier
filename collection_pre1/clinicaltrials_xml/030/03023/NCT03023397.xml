	<brief_title>Evaluation Effect Nasal Allergen Challenge With Dermatophagoides Farinae Extract Nasal Airway Inflammation Allergic Individuals , Comparing E-cigarette Users Cigarette Smokers Non-smokers .</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The recent increase popularity e-cigarettes smoking cessation combination conventional cigarette lead safety concern regard potential role respiratory disease . These tobacco alternative device initially perceive `` safer '' alternative cigarette market without much know health effect . Increasing evidence demonstrate contain few toxin carcinogens conventional cigarette , involve delivery ultrafine particle low airway contain heavy metal chemical . Tobacco smoke may augment allergic inflammation result allergic rhinitis and/or asthma . Animal model allergic asthma demonstrate aggravation allergen-induced airway inflammation follow inhalation e-cig cartridge solution , increase airway eosinophil infiltration , production Th2 cytokine , airway hyperresponsivness . In vitro study human tissue demonstrate pro-inflammatory response e-cig vapour extract yet evaluate effect e-cig usage allergic inflammation human airway . Current evidence suggest e-cigarette use augments allergic inflammatory response similar way tobacco smoke , yet head-to-head comparison effect two exposure perform human . Use tobacco product remain pervasive problem society around world , significant impact respiratory health quality life . With emergence new non-tobacco base nicotine product like e-cigarettes , important understand impact substance respiratory health disease . The aim study study impact product allergic inflammation house dust mite-allergic subject already routinely use e-cigarettes compare responses cigarette smoker non-smokers . A thorough understanding potential health impact tobacco alternative substance need , especially give rise popularity product adolescent young adult substance particular appeal give purport `` safety '' variety flavor choose .</detailed_description>
