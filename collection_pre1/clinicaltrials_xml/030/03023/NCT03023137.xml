	<brief_summary>This study part big one aim evaluate lifestyle intervention pregnancy affect obstetric result , neonatal metabolism intelligence offspring ( study yet complete ) . Data regard obstetric neonatal result enter NCT01409382 , decide split result two sake clarity . A cohort woman early pregnancy loss without antiphospholipid antibody select two reason . One woman follow strictly recommendadtions . The second medication show increase rate take-home baby woman early miscarriage test negative antiphospholipid antibody . We decide focus fibrinolytic system trophoblast migration placental vasculogenesis angiogenesis depend plasmin-dependent extracellular matrix remodel . Plasminogen activator inhibitor ( PAI ) -1 inhibits generation plasmin . Since glucose insulin increase PAI-1 synthesis , hyperglycemia , stimulate insulin production , reduce plasmin generation , may impair placentation . Abnormalities glucose metabolism may also deleterious embryo cause epigenetic change . Chromosomal abnormality consider important cause early pregnancy loss . Several line evidence lend support hypothesis carbohydrate metabolism abnormality contribute pathogenesis recurrent early pregnancy loss . One pregnancies woman polycystic ovary syndrome , around 30 50 % end first-trimester miscarriage . Hyperinsulinemia prevalent feature syndrome , intervention prove effective reduce insulin level , metformin , show reduce rate early miscarriage . The patient body mass index ≥25 kg/m2 significantly high odds early miscarriage , regardless method conception . The investigator 's hypothesis balance diet combined regular exercise , improve glucose homeostasis , would increase take-home baby rate woman consecutive early miscarriage . Moderate exercise usually well tolerated mother , also fetus , indicated test fetal well-being , include umbilical artery systolic diastolic ratio .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Walking Dietary Modification Recurrent Early Miscarriages</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Women age 18 40 year try conceive spontaneously eligible two consecutive pregnancy loss first trimester , document pathology ultrasound-confirmed gestational sac . All participant underwent ultrasound examination inclusion study . Exclusion criterion follow : anatomic anomaly may increase risk pregnancy loss , amenable surgical correction pregnancy , uterine septum ; antiphospholipid antibody ; prior second- third-trimester loss ; current multiple gestation ; disability hemiplegia paraplegia ; renal liver failure ; condition require priori anticoagulation . Participants enrol staff participate center . Randomization intervention protocol Walking Diet ( W &amp; D ) control group perform pregnancy occur statistician use computer-generated random-number table . This double blind study , care take ensure appointment patient assign intervention protocol coincide control . The intervention standardize train research staff . Women assign W &amp; D instruct walk moderate pace ( 4 km/h ) least 40 minute , seven day week . Besides , remain seated day advise walk 25 30 minute twice day , avoid hence 12 hour physical inactivity . Walking could replace stationary bicycle ride swim convenient , often occur near term mother obese . Strenuous exercise discourage . Patients assign protocol W &amp; D also inform importance balance diet recommended avoid high-glycemic index meal ( high-carbohydrate , low-fiber ) . Sucralose could use sweetener . As strategy promote satiety reduce carbohydrate intake , W &amp; D participant also advise eat least two daily serving protein-rich food . The intervention begin participant wish conceive , continue delivery . Careful instruction walk speed diet give participant assign W &amp; D enrolment consultation . During exercise , neither fetal maternal cardiac rate assess . Non-adherence intervention protocol suspect non-obese participant assign W &amp; D gain &gt; 1 kg 4 week 28th week gestation , &gt; 1.5 kg 28th 32nd week , &gt; 2 kg 4 week thereafter , absence edema . The threshold low obese participant : &gt; 700 g 4 week 28th week gestation , &gt; 1 kg 28th 32nd week , &gt; 1.5 kg 4 week thereafter21 . Excessive weight gain arouse suspicion protocol violation high carbohydrate consumption , especially combined physical inactivity stimulate pancreas overproduce insulin , hormone promotes fat storage . To enhance adherence protocol , W &amp; D participant gain excessive weight recommend increase frequency , duration intensity physical activity increase protein intake . Participants W &amp; D group successful pregnancy volunteer encourage mother assign intervention protocol , especially gain excessive weight . At enrollment first-trimester consultation , W &amp; D participant explain antiemetic ondansetron take nausea become severe , order help tolerate balanced meal . No recommendation regard diet physical activity give control . Antiemetics ondansetron give control complain hyperemesis . All participant give folic acid tablet 5 mg daily 14 week gestation , prevention neural tube defect . In group , participant report abdominal pain , cramp , vaginal bleed first-trimester medicate vaginal progesterone . Subcutaneous heparin give participant whose pregnancy complicate nephrotic range proteinuria evidence placental insufficiency . Antihypertensive medication include methyldopa , amlodipine hydralazine . No patient receive aspirin metformin study . Appointments schedule accord routine . Maternal weight blood pressure assess every appointment mother screen gestational diabetes accord American Diabetes Association recommendation . Obstetric neonatal outcome obtain hospital record . Neonates classify small , appropriate large gestational age accord Olsen et al . growth curve . Written inform consent obtain participant full explanation study .</detailed_description>
