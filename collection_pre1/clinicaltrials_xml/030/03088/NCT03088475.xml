	<brief_summary>Aim . To develop compare nurse-led smartphone-based self-management programme exist nurse-led diabetes service health-related outcome type 2 diabetes patient poor glycaemic control Singapore . Background . Over past decade , Asia emerge 'diabetes epicentre ' world due rapid economic development , urbanisation , nutrition transition . There urgent need develop effective care management strategy response rise diabetes epidemic . Design . A randomised controlled trial pre- repeat post-tests control group design . Methodology . A total 128 type 2 diabetes patient poor glycaemic control recruit diabetes clinic public acute hospital Singapore convenience sample . Study participant randomly allocate either experimental group control group . Outcome measure include 10-item General Self-Efficacy Scale , 11-item Revised Summary Diabetes Self-care Activities , 19-item Diabetes-Dependent Quality Life . Data collect three time point : baseline , 3 month , 6 month baseline . Discussion . It expect programme alternative offer diabetes patient master self-care management skill , addition exist diabetes service provide diabetes clinic Singapore hospital . Furthermore , self-supporting less resource-intensive nature programme , use smartphone application mode intervention delivery , greatly reduce nurse ' direct contact time patient allow time allocate require attention .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Nurse-led Smartphone-based Self-management Programme Type 2 Diabetes Patients With Poor Blood Glucose Control</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Specific Aims The aim study : 1. develop nurse-led smartphone-based self-management programme ( NSSMP ) patient type 2 diabetes ; 2. compare NSSMP exist nurse-led diabetes service ( NDS ) self-efficacy , diabetes self-care activity , health-related quality life ( HRQoL ) , glycaemic control , acute diabetes complication ( e.g . hypoglycaemia , Diabetic Ketoacidosis [ DKA ] Hyperosmolar Hyperglycemic Syndrome [ HHS ] ) , health-service use among type 2 diabetes patient poor glycemic control Singapore . Study Hypotheses Study participant randomize exist NDS group ( i.e . control group ) newly develop NSSMP group ( i.e . experimental group ) . It hypothesize participant NSSMP group compare participant NDS group significantly : 1 . Higher level self-efficacy ; 2 . Increased level diabetes self-care activity ; 3 . More positive perceive health-related quality life ; 4 . Reduced glycosylated haemoglobin ( HbA1c ) acute diabetes complication ( e.g . hypoglycaemia , Diabetic Ketoacidosis [ DKA ] Hyperosmolar Hyperglycemic Syndrome [ HHS ] ) ; 5 . Reduced usage health service ( e.g . diabetes-related hospital readmission , emergency room attendance , unplanned medical consultation ) . Approach Adopted This Study Development NSSMP : A nurse-led smartphone-based self-management programme , NSSMP short , develop study team . The model self-efficacy use guide development NSSMP ensure would theoretically sound empirically test . The NSSMP 6-month programme comprise individual education session , newly develop smartphone App self-help education resource . The NSSMP involve use smartphone , internet , communication technology assist patient manage disease home wherever . Patient 's health data monitor smartphones . All data synchronize web-connected portal remote server . The nurse would able access participant 's data ( e.g . blood glucose , exercise , blood pressure , body weight , diet ) web-connected portal individualize care consultation could render tele video conference . Study design , set participant : A randomized control trial pre- repeat post-test control group design adopt . A convenience sample 128 type 2 DM patient poor glycemic control recruit Diabetes Clinic National University Hospital ( NUH ) . Study participant randomly assign either 6-month NSSMP group ( i.e experimental group ) NDS group ( i.e . control group ) . The exist NDS DM patient NUH consist face-to-face patient education session plus telephone follow-up . The patient require return back Diabetes Clinic attend education session base schedule appointment . They instruct measure blood glucose home mode contact ( voicemail , fax email address ) give report glucose reading weekly . If patient report , nurse make call send SMS message patient follow blood glucose result . The nurse would provide telephone counsel service patient need base blood glucose result , sometime would request patient come back Diabetes Clinic see doctor diabetes advance practice nurse . Outcome measure : Study outcome measure include 10-item General Self-Efficacy Scale , 11-item Revised Summary Diabetes Self-care Activities , 19-item Diabetes-Dependent Quality Life use measure self-efficacy , level diabetes self-care activity , health-related quality life participant respectively . The participant 's socio-demographic clinical data ( e.g . HbA1c , acute diabetes complication , lipid level ) also collect . Data collect 3 time point : baseline ( i.e . pre-test ) , 3 month baseline ( post-test 1 ) , 6 month baseline ( post-test 2 ) . The health service use ( e.g . diabetes-related hospital readmission , emergency room attendance , unplanned medical consultation ) also assess 6th month end programme . Data analysis : The IBM SPSS 23.0 use data entry analysis . Intention-to-treat adopt data analysis . Repeated measure analysis covariance use examine difference , within , interaction ( group x time ) effect continuous outcome . Confounding variable ( e.g . age ) , control covariate analysis . The Chi-squared test Fisher 's exact test use test difference incidence acute diabetes complication number health service use two group . All statistical test two-tailed , p &lt; 0.05 used indicate statistical significance . Study Significance If NSSMP demonstrate effective study , smartphone App develop project provide DM patient family members/caregivers self-help education resource home . It provide equip knowledge patient family members/caregivers enhance knowledge skill management diabetes achieve expect patient outcome improve self-efficacy , diabetes self-care activity , HRQoL , clinical outcome . It expect programme option offer diabetes patient master self-care management skill addition exist diabetes service provide diabetes clinic Singapore hospital patient poorly control condition monitor . In addition , independent nature programme application technology greatly reduce nurse ' contact time patient accord time require time , example , afflict diabetes-related complication . This result efficient use healthcare resource long run . Eventually , programme available diabetes patient live community . Feasibility Study The research team comprise experienced researcher different discipline . The PI extensive research experience area chronic diseases management mHealth intervention . Two Co-Is practised clinician diabetes care , facilitate access potential study participant oversee implementation project . One Co-I expertise biomedical engineering , mobile App development , information management . He team charge develop system . In addition , preliminary integrative literature review qualitative patient interview perform inform development content mobile app . Through harness technology , smartphone App base platform establish reduce contact time patient healthcare provider .</detailed_description>
