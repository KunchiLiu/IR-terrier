	<brief_summary>The relationship serum progesterone level day human chorionic gonadotropin administration outcome vitro fertilization /intracytoplasmic sperm injection embryo transfer controversial several decade . study present data negative effect premature luteinization report elevated serum progesterone adverse effect pregnancy rate fresh embryo-transfer cycle within different ovarian responses.However , study evaluate association serum progesterone level clinical outcome fresh vitro fertilization /intracytoplasmic sperm injection cycle , advocate serum progesterone elevation day human chorionic gonadotropin administration may adversely affect clinical outcome jeopardize endometrial receptivity . In addition , underlie mechanism premature luteinization influence clinical outcome elusive . propose premature luteinization cause impairment endometrial receptivity , may indicate change implantation window , likely affect oocyte.whereas document compromised quality oocyte might also cause . The cut point premature luteinization well establish till . Premature luteinization variously define base serum P level , threshold 0.9-1.5 ng/mL use . Previous study show metformin inhibits first step steroidogenesis dose dependently reduce granulosa cell progesterone output .Moreover author recently report low dose metformin could improve vitro fertilization outcome non poly-cystic ovarian syndrome repeaters.So , consider safety drug pregnancy , metformin give consent patient first ultrasound monitoring ovulation trigger .</brief_summary>
