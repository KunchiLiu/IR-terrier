These include change location residence lack interest later stag study . In India , traditional practice pregnant woman leave study area return maternal residence delivery . Few group belong ethnic minority , low family income low education high risk selective attrition . In absence high follow-up rate , result prospective cohort study bias . Such bias occur reason loss relate outcome investigation . The cohort study do India variable rate loss follow-up varying , 14-82 % . The barrier retain great proportion study participant due several reason . While number review report different way improve study participation , little known effectiveness specific retention strategy deploy retention mother infant birth cohort . The proportion pregnant woman turn regular antenatal health checkup poor India . This due several reason include lack awareness , lack social support , long wait time , financial constraint fear hospital care . Evidence suggest maternal education , husband 's education , marital status , availability , cost , household income , woman 's employment , medium exposure previous obstetric history affect uptake antenatal care service .

The recruitment pregnant woman MAASTHI begin month April 2016 . The current strategy deploy MAASTHI cohort follow pregnant woman birth in-person child assessment annually year 1 , 2 , 3 4 child . Despite stringent adherence include resident source population , nearly 13 % woman lose follow-ups birth . These woman deliver different hospital mostly due obstetric complication . Currently around 150 participant recruit per month , completion record , anthropometry measurement , Oral Glucose Tolerance Test ( OGTT ) . Once OGTT do 24-32 week gestation , opportunity meet till delivery . The duration without contact increase likelihood attrition future follow-up . In intervene period initial contact follow-up 's , important research staff constantly engage participant innovative method . In order improve follow-up rate , intervention trial carry examines role innovative 1 ) IVR 2 ) Mother baby workshop intervening time period baseline follow-up .</detailed_description>
