	<brief_summary>The primary purpose study electronic data collection arterial pressure waveform signal patient Aortic Stenosis . The collected digital pressure waveform data use assess feasibility use arterial pressure signal decision support tool early detection aortic stenosis condition . Furthermore evaluate hemodynamic parameter valve repair correlation outcome .</brief_summary>
