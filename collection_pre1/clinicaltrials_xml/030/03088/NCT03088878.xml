	<detailed_description>This Phase 1b/2 study investigate safety effectiveness investigational drug , cirmtuzumab , give combination ibrutinib patient B-cell lymphoid malignancy . The Phase 1b conduct two part ( Part 1 Part 2 ) . Part 1 dose-finding evaluation sequential administration cirmtuzumab monotherapy follow cirmtuzumab ibrutinib combination therapy previously treat chronic lymphocytic leukemia /small lymphocytic leukemia ( CLL/SLL ) mantle cell lymphoma ( MCL ) subject receive prior Bruton tyrosine kinase ( BTK ) inhibitor therapy . Up 48 subject enrol Part 1 determine recommend dose regimen ( RDR ) . In Part 2 , 18 subject enrol evaluate safety pharmacology cirmtuzumab ibrutinib combination give RDR determine Part 1 study . In Phase 2 ( Part 3 ) portion study , approximately 90 subject MCL randomize either Arm 1 ( cirmtuzumab ibrutinib ) RDR Arm 2 ( ibrutinib alone ) evaluate clinical activity safety two arm .</detailed_description>

Current medical need therapy due diseaserelated symptom , lymphadenopathy , organomegaly , extranodal organ involvement , progressive disease . Completion previous therapy ( include surgery , radiotherapy , chemotherapy , immunotherapy , investigational therapy ) treatment cancer 1 week start study therapy . All acute toxic effect prior antitumor therapy resolve Grade 1 start study therapy ( exception alopecia [ Grade 1 2 permitted ] , neurotoxicity [ Grade 1 2 permitted ] , select laboratory parameter [ Grade 1 Grade 2 permit exception note ] ) . Adequate bone marrow function : ) Absolute neutrophil count ( ANC ) ≥1.0 × 109/L ( Grade ≤2 ) . b ) Platelet count ≥50 × 109/L ( Grade ≤2 ) . b ) Hemoglobin ≥8.0 g/dL ( Grade ≤2 ) maintain ≥1 week prior transfusion . Note : Grade ≥3 neutropenia , thrombocytopenia , anemia permit abnormality relate bone marrow involvement hematological malignancy ( document bone marrow biopsy/aspirate obtain since last prior therapy ) . Adequate hepatic profile : 1 . Serum alanine aminotransferase ( ALT ) ≤3 × upper limit normal ( ULN ) ( Grade ≤1 ) . 2 . Serum aspartate aminotransferase ( AST ) ≤3 × ULN ( Grade ≤1 ) . 3 . Serum bilirubin ≤1.5 × ULN ( Grade ≤ 1 ) . Adequate renal function : ) Estimated creatinine clearance ( eClCR ) &gt; 45 mL/minute ( eClCR calculate CockcroftGault formula ) , b ) Measured creatinine clearance &gt; 45 mL/minute ( assessed 24hour urine collection ) . 2 . Adequate coagulation profile : 1 . Prothrombin time ( PT ) ≤1.5 × ULN ( Grade ≤1 ) . 2 . Activated partial thromboplastin time ( aPTT ) ≤1.5 × ULN ( Grade ≤1 ) . Negative viral serology : 1 .

For female subject childbearing potential , negative urine serum pregnancy test prior start study therapy . For female subject childbearing potential , willingness use protocolrecommended method contraception start screen period ≥30 day final dose study therapy . Note : A female subject consider childbearing potential unless hysterectomy , bilateral tubal ligation , bilateral oophorectomy ; medically document ovarian failure ( serum estradiol folliclestimulating hormone [ FSH ] level within institutional laboratory postmenopausal range negative serum urine beta human chorionic gonadotropin [ βHCG ] ) ; menopausal ( age ≥50 year amenorrhea ≥6 month ) .

Note : A male subject consider able father child unless bilateral vasectomy document aspermia bilateral orchiectomy . In judgment investigator , participation protocol offer acceptable benefittorisk ratio consider current disease status , medical condition , potential benefit risk alternative treatment subject 's cancer . Willingness ability subject comply schedule visit , drug administration plan , protocolspecified laboratory test , study procedure ( include bone marrow biopsy/aspirations radiographic study ) , study restriction . Evidence personally sign informed consent indicate subject aware neoplastic nature disease inform procedure follow , experimental nature therapy , alternative , potential risk discomfort , potential benefit , pertinent aspect study participation . Known histological transformation aggressive lymphoma ( ie , Richter transformation ) . Note : Biopsy documentation absence presence transformation require . Known central nervous system malignancy . Note : Central nervous system image require subject suspected central nervous system malignancy . For study participant Part 3 : History another malignancy except follow : adequately treat local basal cell squamous cell carcinoma skin ; adequately treat carcinoma situ without evidence disease ; adequately treat , papillary , noninvasive bladder cancer ; cancer complete remission ≥2 year . Significant cardiovascular disease ( eg , myocardial infarction , arterial thromboembolism , cerebrovascular thromboembolism ) within 3 month prior start study therapy ; angina require therapy ; symptomatic peripheral vascular disease ; New York Heart Association Class 3 4 congestive heart failure ; uncontrolled Grade ≥3 hypertension ( diastolic blood pressure ≥100 mmHg systolic blood pressure ≥160 mmHg ) despite antihypertensive therapy . Significant screen ECG abnormality , include unstable cardiac arrhythmia require medication , atrial fibrillation/flutter , leave bundle branch block , 2nddegree atrioventricular ( AV ) block type II , 3rddegree AV block , Grade ≥2 bradycardia , correct QT ( QTc ) &gt; 450 msec ( men ) &gt; 470 msec ( woman ) . Gastrointestinal disease ( eg , gastric intestinal bypass surgery , pancreatic enzyme insufficiency , malabsorption syndrome , symptomatic inflammatory bowel disease , chronic diarrheal illness , bowel obstruction ) might interfere drug absorption interpretation gastrointestinal AEs . Ongoing risk bleed due active peptic ulcer disease ; bleed diathesis ; requirement systemic anticoagulation antiplatelet drug ( eg , aspirin , triflusal , clopidogrel , prasugrel , ticagrelor , ticlopidine , cilostazol , vorapaxar , dipyridamole ) ; heparin , lowmolecularweight heparin heparin fraction ( eg , enoxaparin , dalteparin , fondaparinux ) oral anticoagulant ( eg , apixaban , rivaroxaban , dabigatran etexilate , warfarin ) .

Ongoing immunosuppressive therapy , include systemic enteric corticosteroid . Note : At Screening , subject may use topical inhaled corticosteroid . During study therapy , use corticosteroid prophylaxis infusion reaction minimize . However , subject may use systemic , enteric , topical enteric corticosteroid require treatmentemergent condition . Use moderate strong inhibitor inducer cytochrome P450 ( CYP ) 3A4 within 7 day prior start study therapy ( Study Parts 2 3 ) expect requirement use moderate strong CYP3A4 inhibitor inducer study therapy ( Study Parts 1 , 2 , 3 ) . Use within 7 day prior start study therapy drug know prolong QT interval ( Study Parts 1 2 ) . Concurrent participation another therapeutic imaging clinical trial . Any illness , medical condition , organ system dysfunction , social situation , include mental illness substance abuse , deem investigator likely interfere subject 's ability provide inform consent , adversely affect subject 's ability cooperate participate study , compromise interpretation study result .</criteria>
