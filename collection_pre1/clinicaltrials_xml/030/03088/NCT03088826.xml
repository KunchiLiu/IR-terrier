	<brief_summary>Oxycodone Hydrocodone commonly use oral opioid analgesic emergency department outpatient setting . Both medication high potential abuse due prominence euphoric effect ( abuse liability ) relative lack `` bad `` `` negative '' effect ( likeability ) . The highly addictive property medication lead recurrent ED visit repetitive dose prescribing may lead abuse , misuse , development dependence addiction , , importantly , death due overdose . In contrast , several research paper demonstrate administration MSIR result similar analgesic efficacy Oxycodone Hydrocodone significantly less euphoric rewarding associate effect . In addition , consumption large dos MSIR lead dysphoria , vomit sedation ( `` negative effect '' ) . To investigator ' knowledge , randomize control trial ED directly compare analgesic efficacy MSIR Percocet</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Analgesic Efficacy ( MSIR ) /Acetaminophen vs. Oxycodone/Acetaminophen ( Percocet )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The investigator ' hypothesis MSIR couple acetaminophen similar good analgesic efficacy 30 minute 1 hour oxycodone couple acetaminophen acute painful condition emergency department . This study double-blind randomized clinical trial evaluation analgesic efficacy orally administer MISIR+acetaminophen comparison Oxycodone+acetaminophen treat pain . Patients enrol single ED tertiary academic center . Patients base inclusion criterion randomize receive either 1 tablet 15mg PO morphine sulfate immediate release combine 650mg Acetaminophen 1 tablet 10mg Oxycodone combine 650 mg Acetaminophen . All drug crush give subject blind fashion . Patients , physician , nurse research assistant blind drug assignment throughout study . Medication prepare site pharmacist . Pain reassess 30 minute , 45 minute 1 hour primary outcome reduction pain score 1.3 point 60 minute . Assuming 1.3 pain difference minimally significant clinically standard deviation 3.0 ( base previous study morphine analgesia ) , minimum 90 patient per group need 80 % power alpha equal 0.05 . Secondary outcome include report adverse effect ; requirement additional analgesia . Generalized likability chance repeat use report use visual analogue scale follow question : `` Do feel DRUG EFFECT ? '' `` Do LIKE drug ? '' `` How HIGH ? '' `` Does drug GOOD EFFECTS ? '' `` Does drug BAD EFFECTS ? '' `` How much DESIRE medication ? '' `` Does drug make UNPLEASANT THOUGHTS ? '' `` Does drug make UNPLEASANT BODILY SENSATIONS ? '' `` Does drug make feel IRRITATED ? '' `` Does drug make DIFFICULT TO CONCENTRATE ? '' The patient respond position arrow along 100-point line label `` '' one end `` extremely '' . Data analyze intention treat include frequency distribution , Student 's T-test ass difference pain score vital sign . The chi-square test ass presence absence side effect two group . Statistical analysis conduct research manager hospital senior biostatistician independent data collection .</detailed_description>
