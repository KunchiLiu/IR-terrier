	<brief_title>Active Surveillance With Without Apalutamide Treatment Low Risk Prostate Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Several cohort study demonstrate survival time patient untreated early stage prostate cancer great 10 year 70 % case , suggest existence slowly progressive non-progressive form prostate cancer would never cause impairment quality quantity life undetected . These form represent currently 23 % 67 % prostate cancer . Therefore , men 's lifetime risk prostate cancer high ( 16-18 % ) , correspond risk death 3 % . These observation give opportunity consider , near current standard curative treatment , active surveillance . This therapeutically choice offer ability delay avoid definitive treatment , thereby minimize patient morbidity . Studies date show seem achieve without compromise long term outcome ( progression-free survival ) appropriately select patient . Up one third receive treatment median 2,5 year surveillance . However , even active surveillance associate high quality-adjusted life expectancy compare local treatment , active surveillance often experience lack care , patient undergoing surveillance experience disutility relate anxiety significantly affect quality life . The introduction new potent androgen receptor inhibitor able block several step androgen receptor signal pathway , raise question benefit early hormonal therapy localize prostate cancer . The aim study ass whether treatment oral androgen receptor inhibitor could influence progression localize prostate cancer delay time local treatment initiation .</detailed_description>
