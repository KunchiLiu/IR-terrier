The production reactive oxygen nitrogen specie ( RONS ) inflammatory marker increase exercise especially altitude training . Antioxidant supplementation commonly use among athlete belief prevents oxidative stress oxidative damage . A transient increase RONS however necessary activate signal cascade initiate training adaptation . Antioxidant supplementation show inhibit exercise effect several independent study , possibly interfering/reducing signal cascade initiated RONS . However , unknown whether high intake antioxidant rich food affect amount RONS , inflammation marker and/or train adaptation . The investigator want examine whether increase intake natural antioxidant form antioxidant-rich food fruit , vegetable berry , line official Norwegian dietary advice affect antioxidant status , immune function training adaptation associate altitude train Norwegian elite athlete .</brief_summary>
