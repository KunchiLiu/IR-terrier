	<brief_title>Early Use Vasopressin Post-Fontan Management</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The treatment prevent manage low cardiac output syndrome congenital heart surgery cardiopulmonary bypass include manipulation vascular volume infusion phosphodiesterase inhibitor ( milrinone ) catecholamine ( epinephrine norepinephrine ) inotropic vasoactive effect , associate risk contribute morbidity mortality . Vasopressin , vasoactive drug efficacy septic shock , also utilized improve postoperative hemodynamics cardiac surgery child . It common institutional practice use vasopressin patient population , usually escalation two three vasoactive drug . There several study pediatrics adult suggest vasopressin inferior vasoconstrictor therapy , advantageous look specific end point . The investigator propose randomize use vasopressin use earlier point typical post-operative medication strategy . The propose study double blind , randomize , placebo control study vasopressin infusion immediately completion Fontan operation . The goal identify vasoactive treatment strategy improve hemodynamics low catecholamine infusion burden , reduces volume fluid resuscitation , reduce in-hospital resource utilization . Neonatal pediatric intervention associate congenital heart disease ( CHD ) continue produce improve outcomes . There establish guideline manage patient congenital heart surgery due lesion-specific unique challenge post-operative period . Volume resuscitation catecholamine infusion traditional treatment method maintain adequate perfusion . However , two treatment modality associate increase risk worsen lung function prolong ventilator support aggressive fluid resuscitation , increase myocardial oxygen demand , precipitation arrhythmia . Given multifactorial etiology postoperative low cardiac output syndrome , often unclear catecholamine infusion optimal improve circulatory function . Vasopressin , alternative vasoactive therapy commonly utilized shock , utilized improve postoperative hemodynamics neonatal pediatric patient population recently gain attention . The use arginine vasopressin infusion infant child cardiac surgery first report 1999 case series 11 patient vasodilatory shock postoperative period . This case series report initiation vasopressin hypotension refractory traditional treatment method report significant rise hemodynamics improve blood pressure patient well wean inotropic support 10/11 patient . Since study conflict report regard vasopressin level use vasopressin improve hemodynamics . Results study published 2008 evaluate vasopressin level 39 patient CHD pre post-operative period conclude child deficient level vasopressin follow surgery cardiopulmonary bypass ( CPB ) . In addition , low level associate hypotension . A large study 2010 121 patient congenital heart surgery CPB describe result suggestive clinically important hypotension associate low vasopressin level . Several publication report improved blood pressure decrease catecholamine usage patient CHD . Two report focus vasopressin use infant single ventricle physiology . In reported case series vasopressin infusion initiate post-operative period rescue therapy . None study advocate initiation vasopressin immediately post-operatively prior time period hemodynamic instability , except one retrospective chart review Alten et al . This study 2012 initiate vasopressin operating room CPB 19 neonate undergo either arterial switch d-transposition great artery Norwood palliation procedure hypoplastic leave heart syndrome . In study , neonates vasopressin initiate operating room receive significantly low amount volume replacement catecholamine support immediate post-operative period . They also describe low heart rate , low incidence arrhythmia , short duration mechanical ventilation shorter intensive care unit stay compare lesion-matched control group . More recently 2016 , single center retrospectively review experience vasopressin patient undergoing Fontan operation 10 year period 's effect chest tube output . They determine patient receive vasopressin perioperatively less chest tube output short duration chest tube drainage addition short hospital length stay improve fluid balance compare historical control . There gap literature describe improve outcome specific target vasoactive inotropic therapy regimen use post-operative Fontan procedure patient . This propose novel study provide evidence outcome base post-operative medical intervention . The propose study double blind , randomize control study vasopressin infusion versus placebo first 24-hours Fontan completion . The aim study evaluate impact vasopressin early postoperative course relatively homogenous population , specific attention catecholamine use , hemodynamics , pleural drainage , extracardiac organ function ( kidney liver ) length stay . Furthermore , investigator plan evaluate vasopressin level two group .</detailed_description>
