	<brief_summary>The Center Autonomic Medicine Pediatrics ( CAMP ) build first International CCHS ( Congenital Central Hypoventilation Syndrome REDCap ( Research Electronic Data Capture ) Registry . This registry international collaboration CCHS patient physician recruit around world . The purpose IRB-approved research study gain good understand various clinical manifestation CCHS advance age , related patient 's specific PHOX2B mutation . With good understand specific CCHS PHOX2B mutation associate disease manifestation , able well anticipate healthcare need provide accurate guideline healthcare provider world-wide care patient CCHS . The study aim obtain detailed phenotypic information ( information health well-being ) patient CCHS . Participation would require fill confidential survey ask question regard phenotype past medical history . Involvement project completely voluntary compensation take part . However , project help u learn devastate disease , goal advance treatment .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>International Congenital Central Hypoventilation Syndrome ( CCHS ) Registry</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>CCHS disorder characterize alveolar hypoventilation control breathe deficit , symptom autonomic nervous system ( ANS ) dysregulation ( ANSD ) . This study aim develop patient registry CCHS , provide crucial insight disease development , improve outcome child improve early recognition disorder , understand phenotypic spectrum , evolution clinical course . Data store REDCap ( Research Electronic Data Capture ) system secure web application design exclusively support data capture research study secure manner . The REDCap server host securely Northwestern University , behind firewall , virus protection , use Secure Socket Layer ( SSL ) authentication encrypt communication user server . Protected Health Information ( PHI ) label database access restrict Principal Investigator ( PI ) key personnel participate consent process follow contact participant . Participants International CCHS REDCap Registry identify recruit CAMP 's registry new , current , past CCHS referral , include CCHS patient refer PHOX2B test and/or consultation . Additionally , patient may also recruit via internet use email , Facebook page , mail list family group . Anyone interested offer inclusion International CCHS Registry . Participants able participate remotely , home location internet , phone , computer access . De-identified data collect REDCap registry de-identified analyzed . Patients enrol study offer participation NIH GRDR . This optional part study , require inclusion . The Global Rare Disease Registry ( GRDR ) establish NIH Office Rare Disease Research . The goal GRDR establish data repository de-identified patient data , aggregate standardized manner , use Common Data Elements ( CDEs ) standardize terminology . De-identification patient 's data utilize Global Unique Identifiers ( GUID ) system . Lurie Children 's Hospital retain ownership data share GRDR . The de-identified data GRDR available investigator enable analysis across many rare disease facilitate various biomedical study , include clinical trial , pursuit develop drug therapeutic improve healthcare quality life many million people diagnose rare disease . Any patient agree part GRDR data de-identified de-identified data export share GRDR . These participant also give option contact participation clinical trial . If option chosen , researcher access de-identified information GRDR planning conduct clinical trial allow contact CAMP project coordinator ask patient fit profile need participant contact offered inclusion . No de-identified information share researcher outside CAMP , rather CAMP project coordinator contact identify patient fit participation criterion share contact information detail clinical trial . Interested patient give option contact researcher conduct clinical trial discretion .</detailed_description>
