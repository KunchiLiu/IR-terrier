	<criteria>General Histologically confirm recurrent and/or metastatic SCCHN oral cavity , oropharynx , hypopharynx larynx amenable curative treatment . At least one measurable lesion MRI CTscan accord RECIST 1.1 , evaluate within 3 week prior treatment allocation . Such lesion must previously irradiate ; measurable lesion ( ) irradiate , clear progression must document . Progressive disease first line platinumbased chemotherapy without cetuximab give palliative treatment progressive disease within 1 year platinumbased chemotherapy give part multimodal curative treatment . ECOG performance status 0 1 . Tumor core biopsy accessible tumor site available central test . Patients must adequate organ function , evaluate within 14 day prior treatment allocation . Patients ≥ 18 year old must able give write informed consent . Patients ≥ 70 year old must undergo G8 screen . Women childbearing potential must negative pregnancy test ( serum urine within 72 hour prior cohort allocation ) . Sexually active patient must use highly effective method contraception registration 6 month last treatment dose . Female subject breast feed discontinue nursing prior first dose study treatment 6 month last study treatment . Before patient registration/randomization , write informed consent must give accord ICH/GCP , national/local regulation . General Unresolved significant toxicity CTCAE version 4.03 grade ≥ 2 previous anticancer therapy alopecia . Any follow within 6 month prior treatment allocation : myocardial infarction , severe/unstable angina , ongoing cardiac dysrhythmias CTCAE version 4.03 Grade 2 , atrial fibrillation grade , coronary/peripheral artery bypass graft , symptomatic congestive heart failure ejection fraction le 50 % , cerebrovascular accident include transient ischemic attack , symptomatic pulmonary embolism . Significant active cardiac disease include uncontrolled high blood pressure accord CTCAE version 4.03 grade 3 . Nasopharynx sinonasal tumor . Surgery investigational drug chemotherapy anticancer therapy within 4 week treatment allocation . Curative radiation therapy ( 6070 Gy ) within 8 week treatment allocation . Palliative radiation therapy ( e.g . 8 Gy painful lesion ) allow . Known untreated uncontrolled brain metastasis carcinomatous meningitis . Known diagnosis immune deficiency know history Human Immunodeficiency Virus ( HIV ) ( HIV 1/2 antibody ) . Known active Hepatitis B ( e.g. , HBsAg reactive ) Hepatitis C ( e.g. , HCV RNA [ qualitative ] detect ) preexist liver cirrhosis . Known preexist interstitial lung disease ( ILD ) . Bronchoemphysema consider ILD . Other uncontrolled active illness ( active infection require antibiotic , bleed disorder , uncontrolled diabetes , … ) . Any psychiatric , psychological , familial , sociological geographical condition potentially hamper compliance study protocol followup schedule .
