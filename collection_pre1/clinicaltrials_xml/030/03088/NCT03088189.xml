	<detailed_description>Background : The concept fetal programming suggest adverse intrauterine growth environment influence development fetal organ structure function , hence lay basis risk chronic disease later life consequent effect human capital . One important factor determine intrauterine growth maternal fetal nutritional status . Micronutrients vitamin B12 folic acid essential determinant one carbon metabolism play important role DNA synthesis , methylation epigenetic regulation gene expression . The ongoing Pune Maternal Nutritional Study ( PMNS ) demonstrate association low maternal vitamin B12 level pregnancy impair cognitive functioning offspring 9 12 year age . This observation suggest maternal micronutrient status pregnancy influence neurocognitive development functioning later life . Various intervention study conduct Delhi Bangladesh support vitamin B12 folic acid supplementation child 6-30 month age improve motor neurocognitive development . On background Diabetes unit KEMHRC , Pune conduct Pune Rural Intervention Young Adolescents since last 3 year . Subjects PMNS cohort randomize part control trial nutritional intervention vitamin B12 v multiple micronutrient milk protein v placebo . This study aim understand intergenerational effect vitamin B12 supplementation . 74 infant bear trial since 2013 . This present unique opportunity study effect parental periconceptional vitamin B12 supplementation infant neurocognitive development . Objective Hypothesis : To compare group difference , infant neurocognitive development score assess 24 month age mother receive either vitamin B12 alone , MMN milk protein placebo . Hypothesis : Infants bear mother receive vitamin B12 would favorable infant neurocognitive development score compare placebo . And effect would enhance group whose mother receive MMN milk protein . Methods : Study subject : The study subject include infant born parent enrol PRIYA trial . As August 2016 , 74 infant bear trial old bear June 2013 . The subject recruitment ongoing infant bear subsequently also include . Procedure : After institutional ethical clearance , parent infant approach 24 month age would approach study informed consent obtain parent . The infant parent would bring KEM hospital schedule appointment . Assessment Bayley scale infant toddler development - III would perform TDH center KEM hospital train assessor . All assessment would perform age 24Â±2 month . For infant already older 24 month assessment would perform current age obtain approval study institutional ethic committee . Tool : The Bayley scale infant toddler development - III standardize instrument assess motor neurocognitive development infant . The scale ass development domain cognitive , receptive communication , expressive communication , fine motor , gross motor , socio-emotional . The scale provide general adaptive composite score along score individual domain .</detailed_description>
