	<detailed_description>This prospective uncontrolled cohort study investigate primary non-response ( PNR ) , loss response ( LOR ) adverse drug reaction ( ADR ) IFX ADA patient severe active luminal Crohn 's disease . The primary objective study investigate mechanism underlie PNR , LOR , ADRs remission anti-TNF withdrawal . The secondary aim develop personalised anti-TNF treatment strategy , identification clinically meaningful serological genetic predictive marker . This study build achievement UK international IBDGC identify IBD susceptibility gene . These discovery provide important insight disease pathogenesis expect impact clinic number year . This study aim take genetics biomarker discovery IBD clinic address question immediate clinical importance . The study commence February 2013 utilise network 120 UK hospital currently participate UK IBDGC pharmacogenetic programme ( www.ibdresearch.co.uk ) . The collection clinical data align data collect Royal College Physicians UK IBD Biologics Audit . The clinical data PANTS collect separately use dedicate application hold within N3 network ( www.pantsdb.co.uk ) . In order avoid duplicate data entry share relevant anonymised data UK IBD Biologics Audit ( due course UK IBD registry ) . The PANTS study aim build bio-resource use UK IBD scientific community . Anonymised data make available interested party follow appropriate ethical approval consideration scientific management committee . Patients randomly allocate one therapy another attempt make match population include control disease activity . Therefore study design directly compare PNR LOR rate IFX ADA . This observational study fund CORE , British Society Gastroenterology research charity unrestricted educational grant Merck Sharp &amp; Dohme ( MSD ) AbbVie . The sponsor study Royal Devon Exeter NHS Foundation Trust .</detailed_description>
