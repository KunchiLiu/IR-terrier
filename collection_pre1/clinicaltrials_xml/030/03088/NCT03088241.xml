	<brief_summary>This trial address question viral load ( VL ) threshold switch first-line second-line antiretroviral therapy ( ART ) . The WHO currently set threshold 1000 copies/mL . However , optimal threshold define virological failure need switch ART regimen determine . In fact , people VL level less 1000 copies/mL , however , fully suppress , increase risk drug resistance mutation ( DRM ) subsequent virological failure . In resource-limited setting VL monitor frequent high-income country , could serious implication patient may continue fail regimen long period . Our research consortium conduct multi-center , parallel-group , open-label , randomized clinical trial resource-limited setting ass whether threshold 100 copies/mL compare WHO-defined threshold 1000 copies/mL switch second-line ART among unsuppressed HIV-positive patient first-line ART lead well outcome .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Study background &amp; rational : The Joint United Nations Programme HIV/AIDS ( UNAIDS ) launch 90-90-90 target 2020 base result newly-acquired scientific evidence - irrespective CD4 count - early antiretroviral treatment ( ART ) HIV-positive individual beneficial prevents HIV transmission . UNAIDS expect 90-90-90 target lead reduction yearly global HIV incidence 2 million currently 500,000 2020 . A crucial step achieve third pillar UNAIDS 90-90-90 target - 90 % viral suppression among HIV-positive individual treatment - thus ensure successful treatment outcome monitoring management first-line ART failure . Since 2013 , WHO recommend routine viral load ( rVL ) measurement preferred monitoring strategy resource-limited setting defines virological failure confirm VL 1000 copies/mL despite good adherence . Specifically , guideline recommend case VL ≥ 1000 copies/mL patient undergo enhance adherence support second VL test 3 month later . A second VL ≥ 1000 copies/mL confirm good adherence would trigger switch second-line regimen , whereas VL &lt; 1000 copies/mL patient continue unaltered first-line ART . However , optimal threshold define virological failure need switch ART regimen yet determine . In fact , people VL level less 1000 copies/mL , fully suppress ( usually define 50-100 copies/mL ) , increase risk drug resistance mutation ( DRM ) subsequent virological failure . A recently publish study research consortium Lesotho indicate similar finding , demonstrate significant accumulation drug resistance mutation patient VL level less 1000 copies/mL . The VL threshold 1000 copies/mL recommend WHO Lesotho national guideline switch second-line ART likely miss substantial number patient first-line ART persist virus replication 1000 copies/mL DRM . In resource-limited setting VL monitor frequent high-income country , could serious implication : VL 1000 copies/mL patient may receive follow-up VL year , thus may continue fail regimen long period time . In conclusion , patient increase risk DRM , accumulation resistance mutation , drug-resistant virus transmission , subsequent virological failure . Study hypothesis : Our research consortium hypothesize patient first-line ART two consecutive unsuppressed VL measurement equal/more 100 copies/mL , second VL 100 999 copies/mL , switch second-line ART ( intervention group ) lead high rate viral resuppression ( VL &lt; 50 copies/mL ) therefore superior compare switch second-line ART accord WHO guideline ( control group , standard care ) . Study design : Multi-center ( 2-12 center ) , parallel-group ( 1:1 allocation ) , open-label , superiority , prospective randomize clinical study .</detailed_description>
