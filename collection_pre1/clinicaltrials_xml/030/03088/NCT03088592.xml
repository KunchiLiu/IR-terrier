	<brief_summary>The pathology Parkinson 's disease ( PD ) mechanism Deep Brain Stimulation surgery ( DBS ) completely understood . The recording data use routinely part procedure map target structure , however , may analyze order well understand neural network dynamic PD . The purpose study perform simultaneous neural recording sub-cortical structure ( e.g . subthalamic nucleus [ STN ] globus pallidus internus [ GPi ] ) cerebral cortex . These simultaneous recording may provide insight pathology PD mechanism DBS . The researcher also study effect anesthesia level neuron synchronization . Recordings micro-ECoG grid electrode cortex show improve spatial resolution use gain well understand cortical network dynamic synchronization subcortical structure .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Subjects identify exclusively researcher ' clinical practice evaluation DBS surgical candidacy Parkinson 's disease . Once determined patient appropriate candidate DBS placement ( multidisciplinary team consensus ) meet inclusion criterion , researcher discuss study subject explain rationale study well implication subject 's participation treatment . Informed consent obtain prior study procedure perform . Subjects study time enrollment surgery post-operative visit test complete , usually 6 month surgery . Follow-up time consist standard follow-up schedule patient undergo DBS follow . This include clinic visit 10-14 day , 12 week , 6 month DBS surgery . Subjects also follow-up neurocognitive evaluation consist evaluative test administer pre-operatively . These post-operative visit standard patient undergo DBS Parkinson 's .</detailed_description>
