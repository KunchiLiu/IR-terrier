This hypothesis investigate previous study far . Overall Objective ( ) : Overall objective : compare safety ( efficacy ) LAAO use St. Jude leave atrial appendage closure device standard medical therapy prospective , multi-center , randomized trial patient undergo TAVI routine clinical practice . Primary Objective : To assess safety device intervention regard stroke prevention prevention bleed complication patient population high risk stroke bleed . Secondary Objectives : Short-term ( procedural ) safety device intervention assess ( rate successful deployment leave atrial appendage occluder ; rate kidney failure ) . As secondary objective , long-term effect device intervention stroke bleed prevention well mortality assess compare medical therapy . Outcome ( ) : Primary : Composite endpoint ischemic hemorrhagic neurologic event , peripheral embolism , life-threatening/disabling major bleed complication cardiovascular mortality 1 year Secondary : All death ( cardiac non-cardiac ) 30 day , 1 , 3 , 5 year Device success 30 day In-hospital acute kidney injury ( AKI ) Study design : An investigator-initiated , randomize , multicenter , non-blinded , all-comers study Measurements Procedures : 80 patient atrial fibrillation undergo TAVI randomize non-blinded fashion ( 1:1 randomization ) LAAO ( device group ) SMT operator ' discretion ( medical group ; antiplatelet therapy oral anticoagulation oral anticoagulation alone ) .

	<brief_title>Comparison Left Atrial Appendage Occlusion v Standard Medical Therapy Patients AF Undergoing TAVI</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Background Rationale Transcatheter aortic valve implantation ( TAVI ) minimally invasive treatment option patient suffer severe symptomatic aortic stenosis . Superiority TAVI medical treatment show randomized PARTNER B trial follow PARTNER A trial show non-inferiority invasive open-heart surgical aortic valve replacement high-risk patient . Over last year , many patient successfully treat TAVI worldwide . Peri- post-procedural morbidity differ considerably surgical interventional treatment group PARTNER A trial : major bleeding ( 19.5 % vs 9.3 % 30 day ) new onset atrial fibrillation ( 16 % vs 8.6 % 30 day ) occur often surgically treated patient , vascular access complication ( 3.8 vs 17 % 30 day ) neurologic event ( 5.5 % vs 2.4 % 30 day ) frequently encounter TAVI population . The high rate neurologic event TAVI group particular concern , give association high mortality clinical impact major neurologic event patient 's quality life daily function . Only 40-50 % stroke occur intra-procedurally , follow high hazard rate first week constant hazard thereafter . After 30 month , surgical group experience numerically high stroke rate , although statistically significant . Measures reduce procedural post-procedural stroke rate still look . While procedural stroke likely reduce improvement valve delivery system ( small delivery system ) operator experience , cerebral protection device currently test trial preliminary result rather disappoint . Risk factor post-procedural stroke TAVI previous history stroke , extensive peripheral vascular disease , high functional class . A subgroup patient particular concern patient suffer atrial fibrillation : predictor early ( day 1-30 ) cerebrovascular event new-onset atrial fibrillation ( OR 2.76 ) , whereas chronic atrial fibrillation predictor ( OR 2.84 ) occurrence late ( &gt; 30 day ) cerebrovascular event . Amat-Santos report high rate strokes/systemic embolism patient hospital new onset atrial fibrillation TAVI ( 13.6 % vs 3.2 % 30 day ) . Patients diagnose new onset atrial fibrillation procedure anticoagulation initiate experienced alarmingly high 30-day stroke rate 40 % . Despite result high prevalence atrial fibrillation ( AF ) 33 % overall TAVI population , 30 % AF patient vitamin K antagonist ( VKA ) , 70 % TAVI . While oral anticoagulation effective medical treatment ischemic stroke prevention patient , often withheld patient give high risk bleeding . TAVI patient typically suffer much co-morbidity poly-medicated , also suffer lot bleeding risk factor . The bleeding risk score ( HASBLED score ) express risk major bleed score system consist 9 individual risk factor bleed ; patient high risk bleeding , 3 factor present . The stroke risk score ( CHA2DS2-Vasc score ) comprise 9 individual risk score stroke patient suffer atrial fibrillation . Both risk score share common risk factor , age , hypertension previous stroke . It therefore surprising patient high risk stroke time high risk major bleeding . The TAVI population form high risk group high prevalence risk factor : average patient age PARTNER trial 84 year , 11 % show severe renal impairment , 75 % indication concomitant acetylsalicylic acid use suffer per definition heart failure . In Stortecky 's study TAVI patient suffer AF , average CHA2DS2-Vasc score 4.5 , &gt; 95 % patient score &gt; 3 . Left atrial appendage occlusion ( LAAO ) allow avoid oral anticoagulation provide time least equally good protection stroke peripheral embolism . It may therefore attractive alternative oral anticoagulation TAVI patient population : concept LAAO base fact thrombus formation atrial fibrillation occur &gt; 90 % leave atrial appendage ( LAA ) . Mechanical occlusion LAA reduce stroke risk eliminate source thrombus formation . Clinical study prove concept true : PROTECT-AF study randomize &gt; 700 patient either LAA occlusion medical therapy ( VKA ) . At one year , non-inferiority LAAO proven , numerically less embolic event LAAO group . At European conference ( EuroPCR conference ) 2013 , Holmes ( principal investigator PROTECT-AF trial ) report 4-year follow-up data significant 40 % reduction composite stroke/peripheral embolism/cardiovascular death 34 % reduction cause mortality LAAO group compare oral anticoagulation . By reduce bleed complication , anticipate morbidity mortality continue diverge two group . Comparable result large registry use Amplatzer device ( St. Jude Medical , St. Paul , USA ) LAAO report : average follow-up 32 month , cardiovascular death , stroke , peripheral embolism occur 7 % patient . In latter study , oral anticoagulation instantly stop LAAO patient . In propose `` Randomized Comparison Left Atrial Appendage Occlusion versus Standard Medical Therapy Atrial Fibrillation Patients Undergoing Transfemoral Transcatheter Aortic Valve Implantation '' , study investigator test hypothesis , LAAO superior standard medical therapy high-risk TAVI population . This hypothesis investigate previous study far . The design investigator-initiated , randomize , multicenter , non-blinded , all-comers study . It understand , pilot trial intention prove safety , underpowered show superiority medical therapy .</detailed_description>
