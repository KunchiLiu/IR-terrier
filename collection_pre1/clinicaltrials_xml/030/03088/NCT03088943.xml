	<detailed_description>Perioperative echocardiographic quantification myocardial function great importance patient management increasingly recommend intraoperatively spite unresolved under-explored issue . One issue perioperative measurement diastolic function . Diastolic dysfunction diastolic heart failure - commonly refer `` heart failure preserve ejection fraction ( HFpEF ) '' - responsible 35 50 % heart failures . Intraoperative measurement diastolic function prognostic management relevance patient undergoing cardiac non-cardiac surgery . However , even recent guideline intraoperative transesophageal echocardiography ( TEE ) neglect topic , exception recent , briefly allude role TEE play assess diastolic function , without address issue measurement view use . The clinically prevalent echocardiographic view assessment intraoperative diastolic function tissue Doppler imaging ( TDI ) midesophageal 4-chamber ( ME 4C ) TEE view . This view , look heart leave atrium , standard view evaluate intraoperative global cardiac performance . However , Doppler angle assess diastolic performance generally much great 20° , Doppler techniques know angle dependent base Doppler equation , use view may relevantly underestimate TDI velocity . Views apex heart ( i.e . deep transgastric long axis view [ dTG LAX ] TEE view well apical 4-chamber [ AP 4C ] transthoracic echocardiography ( TTE ) view ) cosine angle towards mitral annular plane excursion near zero , thereby allow valid measurement accord Doppler equation . However , TDI velocity often - potentially erroneously - report ME 4C TEE view . The objective project address number important clinical topic regard diastolic dysfunction TEE . Two main objective examine : - Assess whether tissue doppler imaging ( TDI ) measurements mitral annular plane velocity systolic excursion midesophageal 4-chamber TEE view ( ME 4C ) significantly underestimate diastolic cardiac performance compare deep transgastric long axis TEE view ( dTG LAX ) due intrinsic misalignment doppler beam . [ i.e . technological limitation ? ] - Assess whether difference mitral annular plane velocity systolic excursion ME 4C dTG LAX underestimate use TDI compare value derive speckle track echocardiography ( STE ) . [ i.e . technological limitation , STE show consistency ? ] Two secondary objective examine : - Determine influence frame rate ( temporospatial resolution ) STE-derived mitral annular velocity systolic excursion conduct STE measurement post cardiopulmonary Bypass ( CPB ) atrially pace patient 1. midesophageal 4 chamber view ( ME 4C ) 2. deep transgastric long axis view ( dTG LAX ) . [ i.e . ST show consistency , limitation ? ] - Confirm existence explore potential reason ( anesthesia , ventilation , TTE vs. TEE , Doppler alignment ) differences mitral annular plane velocity systolic excursion observe preoperatively ( i.e . cardiologist ) intraoperatively ( i.e . anesthetist , intensivists ) . Specifically , compare value four view : 1. apical 4-chamber view TTE ( AP 4C ) preinduction , 2. apical 4-chamber view TTE ( AP 4C ) postinduction , 3. midesophageal 4 chamber view ( ME 4C ) postinduction , 4 . Deep transgastric long axis view ( dTG LAX ) postinduction . [ i.e . relative contribution ignore misalignment angulation compare intraoperative factor explain observed underestimation diastolic velocity distance see cardiologist ( AP 4C TTE view ) anesthetist's/intensivist 's ( ME 4C TEE view ) ? ]</detailed_description>
