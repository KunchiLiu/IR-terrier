	<detailed_description>Fibromyalgia Pain Syndrome ( FPS ) common debilitate condition associate mainly generalise pain , emotional distress cognitive symptom . The etiology unknown , specific treatment exist far . It bear similarities another , localise clinical condition : Myofascial Pain Syndrome ( MPS ) , result pain caused , amongst others , muscular trigger point . Lately , FPS MPS classify belong new , large entity : Central Sensitivity Syndromes ( CSS ) , strong chronic peripheral sensitive stimulus ( like musculoskeletal pain ) believe induce , time , enhance response central nervous system ( CNS ) towards stimulus , result stimulus felt powerfully ( central sensitization , CS ) . This secondary neuroplastic change CNS , reversible extent . Since shock-waves effective treat pain MPS ( eliminate trigger point thus restore muscle tissue function ) , since MPS FPS could link common pathophysiologic mechanism ( CSS ) , investigator hypothesize shock wave could beneficial treat pain FPS . Two group 20 participant prospectively compare three month 's period . One group receive shock-waves painful muscular area weekly 12 week , group receive shock-waves . The investigator intend study difference pain quality life end three month .</detailed_description>
