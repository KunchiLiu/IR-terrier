	<brief_summary>Background : The European General Practitioners Research Network ( EGPRN ) design validated comprehensive definition multimorbidity use systematic literature review qualitative research throughout Europe . This survey assess criterion EGPRN concept multimorbidity could detect decompensating patient residential care within primary care cohort 6-month follow-up . Method : Family Physicians include multimorbid patient encounter residential care home July December 2014 . Inclusion criterion EGPRN definition Multimorbidity . Exclusion criterion patient legal protection unable complete 2-year follow-up . Decompensation define occurrence death hospitalization seven day . Statistical analysis undertaken uni- multivariate analysis 6-month follow-up use combination approach include automatic classification expert decision making . A Multiple Correspondence Analysis ( MCA ) Hierarchical Clustering Principal Components ( HCPC ) confirm consistency result . Finally logistic regression perform order identify quantify risk factor decompensation .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The concept multimorbidity first publish 1976 . Multimorbidity define World Health Organization ( WHO ) people affect two chronic health condition . Multimorbidity interest challenge concept particularly Family Medicine ( FM ) , give increase prevalence chronic illness age population across developed country . It closely related global comprehensive view patient , core competency FM , define , instance , World Organization National Colleges , Academies Academic Associations General Practitioners/Family Physicians ( WONCA ) . It global 'functional ' view ( useful Long-Term Care ) versus 'disease ' center point view ( useful acute care ) . The European General Practice Research Network ( EGPRN ) create research agenda specifically design methodological instrumental research , include development primary care epidemiology , focus patient-centered health . A comprehensive definition concept multimorbidity ( i.e . one understandable usable collaborative research ) important objective research network . The objective help researcher FM investigate complexity patient ' condition overall impact patient ' health . This concept multimorbidity could additional tool Family Physicians ( FPs ) , enable prevent decompensation . A research team , include 9 national group , active within EGPRN , create research community purpose clarify concept multimorbidity FM throughout Europe . This group produce comprehensive definition concept multimorbidity systematic review literature . This concept translate European language use collaborative research . Finally , validate use qualitative research throughout Europe specific research agenda issue . The EGPRN concept multimorbidity include set different variable assess patient ' multimorbidity , multimorbidity modulate factor multimorbidity consequence . Decompensation ( i.e . death hospitalization acute care ) challenge FM FPs , familiar patient 's health status , could miss tiny factor , notice , could help prevent decompensation . A predictive model could integrate clinical practice could help prevent decompensation avoid serious health outcome patient . The EGPRN concept multimorbidity consider highly suitable purpose . It could lead usable model prevent decompensation . The French population age , one three people 60 year age 2050 . Consequently , number dependent patient , require institutionalization Care home ( CHs ) , grow . Patients reside CHs include EGPRN definition multimorbidity . In France , European country , patient residential care treat FPs . The purpose research ass criterion EGPRN concept multimorbidity could detect decompensating patient residential care within primary care cohort 6-month follow-up .</detailed_description>
