	<detailed_description>The HIV epidemic still active France , 7 000 8 000 new infection per year.There estimate 150,000 people live HIV France . Data hidden epidemic show : - approximately 30,000 patient unaware HIV status - Ile de France area account 44 % new infection . For 20 year , patient-initiated HIV counsel test system help thousand people know HIV status , coverage counsel test low . In 2007 , WHO UNAIDS publish guidance provider-initiated HIV counsel test health facility improve acceptance access prevention , treatment And care . It context , France , National Plan Fight AIDS Sexually Transmitted Infections ( STI ) 2010-2014 recommend strengthen screening strategy , make Public Health dimension , Reintegrating overall preventive approach . The expected benefit routine screen would thus individual well collective : routine screening could mean control infection modify risk behavior , could preventive tool allow early diagnosis Of disease , could associate evolution management prognosis infection allow initiation antiretroviral treatment acute phase infection . In 2011 , Ministry Health systematize screen proposal entire population , consider strategy cost-effective direct individual benefit Public Health benefit reduce number transmission . In Plan , health authority recommend hospital doctor city general practitioner prescribe HIV test much widely , target person belong identify risk group Low `` apparent '' risk . Screening remain critical problem management 20-30 % patient diagnose late stage ( CD4 &lt; 200 / mm3 ) . According Institute Health Watch , 100 000 hepatitis C viral patient undiagnosed France difference prevalence accord sex age . For hepatitis B , 55 % chronic carrier HBs antigen know status , ie 160 000 people France . The recommendation 2014 expert report ( Dhumeaux report ) change screen high proportion patient aware serological status , also recent advance treatment two infection . For hepatitis C , availability effective , well tolerate short treatment reinforces need screen , monitor eventually treat patient accord treatment recommendation . The expert report proposes : - Continue target screen base risk factor contamination ( drug addiction , sexual exposure , originate country high endemicity , etc . ) inform general population general practitioner - Expand screen strategy follow population : men age 18 60 , pregnant woman first prenatal consultation , regularly evaluate strategy - Associate case research three virus HBV , HCV HIV , take account epidemiological similarity , possibility interest group test . The success screen program depend number fundamental principle include : - Targeted disease must associate high morbidity mortality - The screening test must safe , acceptable inexpensive - Effective treatment must available These 3 principle HIV , viral hepatitis B C. HIV associate increase morbidity mortality absence antiretroviral treatment . The serological test safe , acceptable inexpensive . Antiretroviral therapy available , 2015 , French international guideline provide universal treatment regardless stage infection . Hepatitis C associate increased morbidity mortality absence treatment . The disease progress cirrhosis , hepatocellular carcinoma terminal liver disease , responsible high morbidity may also associate severe extrahepatic manifestation . A serological test available , safe , acceptable inexpensive . The antiviral treatment available new strategy new molecule allow cure 95 % patient accord stage disease . Hepatitis B associate increased morbidity mortality absence treatment . The serological test safe , acceptable inexpensive . The disease progress cirrhosis , hepatocellular carcinoma terminal liver disease , responsible high morbidity . Antiviral treatment available help control long-term infection . These 3 pathology , target screen , respond fundamental principle . The investigator hypothesize pre-operative screening increase number HIV-positive people screen decrease number people treat late HIV , HBV / HCV infection . The person detect way could take care optimal care channel precisely . Moreover , knowledge seropositivity modify behavior favor rupture transmission . The propose methodology base development screen strategy HIV B C viral hepatitis serology , systematically propose anesthesiologist person age 18 undergoing surgery anesthesia In Stomatology . This study base formalization close effective functional link Department Infectious Diseases Tropical Diseases , Department Stomatology Laboratory Virology .</detailed_description>
