	<brief_title>Improving Pain Reducing Opioid Use ( IPaRO ) Lumbar Spine Surgery Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Patients present lumbar spine surgery experience pain related spine condition . Following surgery , patient also experience surgical pain result disruption skin , muscle tissue , vertebra , intervertebral disc , facet joint . Proper pain management necessary reduce pain-related medicate side effect promote rehabilitation . This pain often treat opioid medication - roughly 40 % patient experience sub-optimal pain management . Adequate pain control become top priority among professional society , healthcare system , accredit agency . Multi-modal pain management strategy propose ( 1 ) control pre-operative pain related spine pathology ; ( 2 ) employ non-opioid medication peri-operatively pre-empt post-operative surgical pain ; ( 3 ) monitor control pain intensity surgery . There demonstrated lack evidence regard optimal post-operative protocol pathway . The investigator plan randomized clinical trial compare effectiveness two method peri-operative pain management reduce post-operative pain opioid use among patient undergo lumbar spine surgery . Prior submission National Institutes Health ( NIH ) , Agency Healthcare Research Quality ( AHRQ ) , Patient Centered Outcomes Research Institute ( PCORI ) , necessary demonstrate feasibility acceptability trial protocol . The current proposal provide critical evidence feasibility acceptability multi-modal pain management plan patient undergoing lumbar spine surgery . Additionally , study provide critical preliminary data compare effectiveness protocol-driven multi-modal pain management control post-operative pain , reduce opioid medication use , improve physical activity , sleep , health .</detailed_description>
