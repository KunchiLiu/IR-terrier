	<brief_summary>The researcher recognize possible clinical usefulness shield device jig help increase accuracy decrease time load seed biocompatible material use intra-operatively . Therefore , researcher create prototype device call GammaTile ( GT ) loader ( design patent pending ) . The reusable device make surgical quality stainless steel sufficient thickness ( great 10 half-value layer ( HVL ) provide significant staff user shield well allow sterilize . It utilize intraoperatively operative field direct patient contact . Currently two size plan . The first accommodate 2 inch x 2 inch collagen square second accommodate 1 inch x 1 inch collagen square . These commonly use size lyophilize collagen use Barrow Neurosurgical Institute ( BNI ) operating room ( OR ) .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Intraoperative Brachytherapy Central Nervous System Lesions : A Validation Study Radioactive Seed Loading Device</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This 100 patient observational-design study purpose test seed loader device method arrange secure seed carrier set pattern convenient use neurosurgeon backdrop hodgepodge currently available technique ( seed suture , seed mesh , loose seed ) , currently need secondarily secure additional , currently standardize material , cumbersome , time-consuming , assuredly accurate manner . An additional primary objective assessment loader device radiation protection tool user staff seed placement carrier prior intracranial carrier placement . Secondary objective conformality pre- post-implant dosimetry ( expect vs achieve ) post implant stability ( seed shift ) time judge routine follow MRI . An additional propose endpoint economic ( cost ) comparison modality . Eligible patient deem appropriate schedule undergo adjuvant brachytherapy central nervous system determine radiation oncologist neurosurgeon . Potential candidate lesion ( ) may newly diagnose recurrent , need gross total near gross total resection , opinion operating surgeon would amenable need propose treatment . Informed consent obtain . Radiation oncologist neurosurgeon determine appropriateness propose procedure radiation oncologist neurosurgeon determine volume configuration area implant . A carrier use currently available material ( lyophilized bovine-derived collagen , Duraform similar ) stock BNI OR . The isotope ( seed ) also already approve use anywhere body , use hospital 's radioactive material license ( RML ) . Patients pre- post-operative computerize tomography ( CT ) magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) routine care , post-operative CT 's per routine implant case dosimetry . All applicable radiation safety procedure continue follow . The sterilizable loader ( ) provide non-charge-item , anticipated classify `` Class 1 '' device FDA implant direct patient contact .</detailed_description>
