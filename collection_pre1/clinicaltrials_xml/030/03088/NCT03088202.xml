	<brief_summary>A major concern today 's oncology complexity treatment increase cost . A main contributor increase use chemo- radiotherapy end life ( EoL : last 12 month life ) . Importantly , intensive chemotherapy EoL uncertain efficacy , may result frequent hospitalization less time spend home . Also , patient incurable disease receive intensive treatment EoL bad quality life ( QoL ) . A systematic palliative care ( PC ) approach focus optimal symptom management maintenance QoL patient family often introduce late disease trajectory . Studies indicate early introduction PC patient unfavorable prognosis may improve QoL symptom prolong survival . These related finding make international stakeholder advocate strong integration oncology PC patient incurable cancer . The present project national multicenter cluster-randomized trial ( RCT ) 12 oncology department 4 Norwegian health region . The project test efficacy complex tripod intervention integrate oncology PC cancer patient life-expectancy &lt; 12 month receive chemotherapy include : A ) systematic electronic assessment symptom , B ) implementation standardize care pathway C ) education program oncologists/PC physician . The PC pathway focus patient 's journey PC trajectory include EoL care order improve quality care reduce variability clinical practice cost . The intervention aim empower physician , patient relatives promote shared-decision-making .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Patients incurable disease receive intensive treatment EoL bad quality life ( QoL ) compare receive symptomatic treatment . Also , PC approach early stage patient unfavorable prognosis may improve patient ' QoL symptom control , may lead prolonged survival give patient caregiver realistic perspective disease prognosis . Further , documentation caregiver patient advance cancer generally satisfy report less depressive symptom early introduction PC . These related finding wake study ( NEJM 2010 ) initiate current debate make international stakeholder advocate strong integration oncology PC patient incurable cancer . Despite rapid development PC service last 15-20 year , still distinct separation oncology PC Norway Western country . This infer potential optimal care last phase life patient fully explore , despite documented advantage patient caregiver . However , result study integration oncology PC country e.g . USA , may directly transferable Norway , give different health care organization , reimbursement issue different indication high degree hospice use . Information give cancer patient caregiver disease treatment important stage disease , crucial relation PC order facilitate share decision making , improve satisfaction care , patient ' sense control , QoL communication patient caregiver . As PC also aim improve QoL caregiver wait include caregiver patient last week day life may adequately address patient caregiver distress . Further , benefit early integration PC caregiver 's distress QoL remain inconclusive . Thus , overall aim PALLiON improve quality efficacy cancer care implement early integration oncology PC patient advance cancer receive chemotherapy . The long-term objective change today 's oncology practice . Today , method referral PC often base care need contrast referral base diagnosis prognosis use RCTs document favorable result . As know time referral important optimize benefit PC , aim change practice . The implementation method PALLiON complex intervention consist ) structure educational program oncologist , palliative care physician nurse , b ) standardize care pathway systematic integration oncology palliative care include cancer diagnosis , c ) systematic use Eir - electronic assessment tool patient-reported outcome ( PROMs ) , standardize care pathway , combine evidence-based treatment recommendation clinical consultation . The design make possible evaluate effect early integration oncology PC institutional patient level intervention control arm . Further , potential effect intervention center intervention arm evaluate compare post-intervention data historical data e.g . use chemotherapy , number re-admissions / emergency admission last stages life appropriate .</detailed_description>
