	<brief_summary>The obesity epidemic lead enormous increase prevalence type 2 diabetes mellitus ( T2D ) , dyslipidemia cardiovascular event . Particularly South Asians , comprise 1/5 world population , increase risk develop disadvantageous metabolic phenotype disease . Moreover , T2D occur young age lower BMI compare white Caucasians . Recent research show South Asians low energy expenditure Caucasian counterpart , also less active brown adipose tissue ( BAT ) . For time , know adult human active BAT . This metabolic tissue produce heat combust triglyceride , contrast white adipose tissue , store form energy . It show activation BAT positive effect whole body metabolism , via increase energy expenditure improve glucose- lipid metabolism . For matter , BAT propose major key player energy homeostasis , may implement current combat obesity epidemic . Aside cold exposure , research focus pharmacological activation BAT . Glucagon-like peptide 1 ( GLP-1 ) incretin hormone produce intestinal L-cells upon food intake stimulates insulin secretion pancreatic beta cell . The GLP-1 analogue Exenatide currently much use antidiabetic drug reduce hyperglycemia via aforementioned mechanism . Beyond blood glucose-improving effect , Exenatide also show low body weight improve dyslipidemia T2D patient . Elucidation underlie mechanism beneficial effect highly relevant . Recent preclinical research group show central activation GLP-1 receptor exenatide increase BAT activity thereby contribute weight loss improvement dyslipidemia . The aim research project investigate whether exenatide also able activate BAT increase rest energy expenditure , thereby improve glucose- lipid metabolism reduce fat mass body weight human . Moreover , investigator aim validate MRI scan novel way measure BAT activity . The investigator hope forthcoming finding lead discovery new treatment strategy obesity .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The current study open-label single arm prospective design , include 24 healthy young lean male ( BMI 18 25 kg/m2 ) , 12 Dutch South Asians 12 Dutch Caucasians . After medical screening , include subject receive 12 week treatment GLP-1 analogue exenatide ( Bydureon ; 2 mg s.c. 1x/wk ) . Study subject visit LUMC weekly . Before treatment study day , BAT ( mean 18F-FDG PET-CT scan MRI scan ) , rest energy expenditure ( measure indirect calorimetry ) fat mass ( bio-impedance analysis ) measure . Moreover , blood drawn investigate effect exenatide lipid- glucose metabolism .</detailed_description>
