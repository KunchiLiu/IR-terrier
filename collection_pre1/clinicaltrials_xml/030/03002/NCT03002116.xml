	<brief_summary>Diagnosis vascular involvement diabetic foot disease remain challenge . Differential diagnosis pure neuropathic neuro-ischemic diabetic foot require combination clinical examination , medical history ankle-brachial index ( ABI ) measurement , consider `` gold standard '' non-invasive modality limb ischemia diagnosis . However , diabetic patient suspect arterial ischemia result tissue loss ( critical limb ischemia ; CLI ) , false negative ABI result frequent due Monckeberg medial sclerosis produce incompressible vessel , clinical sign subjective accurate pose definite diagnosis CLI . The investigator conduct proof concept study feasibility microwave radiometry thermometry non-invasive diagnosis CLI diabetic patient tissue loss .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Microwave Radiometry Thermometry Diagnosis Critical Limb Ischemia Diabetic Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This prospective , multi-centre , trial design investigate feasibility efficacy microwave radiometry thermometry non-invasive diagnosis CLI diabetic patient tissue loss . The study include 80 patient , equally divide four group . Group N : normal subject ; group DN : diabetic patient verify neuropathic ulcer without vascular involvement ; group DC : diabetic patient CLI group NDC : non-diabetic patient CLI . All patient underwent MWR RTM -01-RES device ( University Bolton , UK ) record mean internal tissue temperature foot . MWR base principle intensity radiation proportional tissue temperature . The specific device commercially available developed detect temperature internal tissue microwave frequency . Foot temperature measurement perform near possible site ulceration patient group DN , DC NDC various site subject control group N .</detailed_description>
