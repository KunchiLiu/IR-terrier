	<brief_summary>The primary objective study assess effect cytochrome P450 3A4 enzyme ( CYP3A4 ) induction rifampicin pharmacokinetics ( PK ) eribulin mesylate follow intravenous ( IV ) administration participant advance solid tumor . The secondary objective study assess safety eribulin mesylate co-administered rifampicin assess safety activity eribulin mesylate single agent .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>To Assess Effect Rifampicin Pharmacokinetics Eribulin Mesylate Participants With Advanced Solid Tumors</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The study consist 3 phase : Pre-Treatment , Treatment , Extension . Pre-Treatment Phase 2 period : Screening Baseline . Treatment Phase consist intensive PK assessment eribulin mesylate give IV alone Day 1 follow eribulin mesylate give IV Day 15 rifampicin give orally Days 9 20 . Extension Phase allow eribulin mesylate treatment continue participant without progressive disease unacceptable toxicity .</detailed_description>

Adequate liver function evidence bilirubin less equal 1.5 time upper limit normal ( ULN ) alkaline phosphatase ( ALP ) , alanine aminotransferase ( ALT ) , aspartate aminotransferase ( AST ) less equal 3 time ULN ( case liver metastasis le equal 5 time ULN ) . In case ALP great 3 time ULN ( absence liver metastasis ) great 5 time ULN ( presence liver metastasis ) , participant also know bone metastasis , liver specific ALP separate total used ass liver function instead total ALP 8 . Adequate bone marrow function evidence absolute neutrophil count ( ANC ) great equal 1.5 x 109/L , hemoglobin great equal 10.0 g/dL great equal 6.2 mmol/L ( hemoglobin le 10.0 g/dL less 6.2 mmol/L acceptable correct growth factor transfusion ) , platelet great equal 100 x 109/L 9 . Participants willing able comply study protocol duration study 10 . Written inform consent obtain prior studyspecific screening procedure understand participant may withdraw consent time without prejudice 11 . Females childbearing potential negative serum betaHuman chorionic gonadotropin negative urine pregnancy test Visit 1 ( Screening ) prior start study drug ( ) ( Visit 3 ) . Female participant childbearing potential agree abstinent use highly effective method contraception ( eg , condom + spermicide , condom + diaphragm spermicide , intrauterine device [ IUD ] , vasectomise partner ) start prior start study drug , throughout entire study period 30 day last dose study drug . Those woman use hormonal contraceptive must also use additional approve method contraception ( describe previously ) . Perimenopausal woman must amenorrheic least 12 month consider nonchildbearing potential 12 . Male participant abstinent undergone successful vasectomy , partner woman childbearing potential must use , partner must use highly effective method contraception ( eg , condom + spermicide , condom + diaphragm spermicide , IUD ) start prior start study drug ( ) throughout entire study period 30 day last dose study drug . Those partner use hormonal contraceptive must also use additional approve method contraception ( describe previously ) 1 . Hypersensitivity halichondrin B and/or halichondrin B chemical derivative hypersensitivity rifampicin 2 . Prior participation eribulin clinical study , even previously assign eribulin treatment 3 . Preexisting neuropathy great Grade 2 4 . Any following treatment within specified period eribulin treatment start : 1. chemotherapy , radiation biological therapy within 2 week , 2. hormonal therapy within 1 week exception prostate cancer patient medical castration gonadotropinreleasing hormone analog , 3. investigational drug within 4 week 5 . Any medication , dietary supplement compound substance know induce inhibit cytochrome P450 3A4 ( CYP3A4 ) activity time study start 6 . Presence impair intestinal absorption 7 .
