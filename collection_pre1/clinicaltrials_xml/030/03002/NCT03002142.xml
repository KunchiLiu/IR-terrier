	<brief_summary>Alzheimer disease neurodegenerative disease . Recent study suggest subject hear loss likely develop Alzheimer 's disease . Hearing loss consecutive presbycusis and/or central auditory dysfunction . Standard audiometric measure pure tone speech intelligibility allow diagnosis presbycusis . However , demonstrate central auditory dysfunction , specific audiometric test noisy and/or dichotic test , need . Actually , consensus exist investigate hearing loss people Alzheimer 's disease ; therefore hearing loss may early manifestation Alzheimer 's disease . Until , investigation clinical procedure relate diagnosis Alzheimer 's disease ignore hearing ability patient . However , major part care management investigation imply patient 's communication ability caregiver . Hearing loss may one unrecognized deficit subject Alzheimer 's disease . Auditory rehabilitation hearing aid could benefit patient decrease cognitive decline management must investigate longitudinal study order demonstrate efficiency need compare placebo .</brief_summary>
