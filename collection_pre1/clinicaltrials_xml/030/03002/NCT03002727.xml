	<brief_summary>Microsatellite instability common colorectal cancer ( CRC ) young patient associate good prognosis consider predictor good response preoperative chemoradiotherapy . Counting ( cluster differentiation ) CD 133 +ve cell , marker enrichment colorectal cancer stem cell , consider prognostic marker poor survival predictor radio-resistance . Correlation microsatellite status ( MS ) CD133 count yet study especially young patient rectosigmoid cancer . So investigator hypothesize correlation microsatellite status , CD133+ve cell count , occurrence CRC young patient resistance standard treatment regimen . Improvement response treatment choice best regime avoid non beneficial treatment modality goal study .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Role CD133 &amp; Microsatellite Status Evaluation Rectosigmoid Cancer Young Adults Received Neoadjuvant Treatment</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The age incidence colorectal cancer fifty year old world wide .But , compare incidence clinicopathological feature colorectal cancer western country country constrain resource Egypt , significant low median age incidence . In Egypt report show CRC detect 11-15 % patient underwent colonoscopy diagnose 29-31 % patient age 40 year younger . Similar data come highly populate resource-constrained country Asia . This early onset rectal cancer mainly poorly differentiate , advanced prognosis , sporadic familial predisposition.Young patient microsatellite high ( MSI-h ) proximal cancer colon good prognosis lack data prognostic predictive role gene young patient irradiated rectal cancer . As young age patient show bad outcome term progression free survival high rate metastatic event , hypothesize colorectal cancer stem cell ( CR-CSC ) may role dismal outcome.CD133 one best-characterized marker CR-CSCs , many study demonstrate CD133 expression correlate survival , recurrence , metastasis chemotherapy resistance colorectal cancer . So study try establish correlation MS status enrichment CR-CSC propose relationship may implication disease outcome treatment result . Patients method : The investigator enroll 30 patient examine pre- treatment colonoscopic biopsy - Type grade carcinoma light microscopy stain haematoxylin eosin . - Immunocytochemistry perform 4 Âµ-thick section paraffin block use streptavidin-biotin-peroxidase technique . The section routinely deparaffinized , rehydrated grade alcohol distilled water . Deparaffinized section treat 0.3 % hydrogen peroxide 10 min . Suitable antigen retrieval carry . Blocking serum apply 10 min . The section incubate antibody raise 1 . MMR protein : MLH1 , MSH2 , MSH6 , PMS-2 . 2 . CD133 . Then investigator collect block patient receive neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy underwent surgery examine 1 . Under light microscope staining : Type grade carcinoma Angiovascular invasion Degree immune response Pattern depth invasion Lymph node status . 2 . CD 133 positive cell count previously report technique . The result immune complex detect universal stain kit follow instruction attached kit . Slides wash several time phosphate buffer saline place 5 minute step except peroxidase reagent wash distilled water . Negative positive control include stain series . Immunohistochemical evaluation do accord Ren F et al Zhang X et al . Digital image obtain digital camera system</detailed_description>
