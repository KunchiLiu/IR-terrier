	<brief_summary>Background : The thyroid gland base throat . Thyroid cancer disease people get abnormal cell begin grow gland . Researchers believe new drug call CUDC-907 may able help people thyroid cancer spread gotten bad . Objective : To see CUDC-907 shrink tumor people advance thyroid cancer . Eligibility : People least 18 year old diagnose locally advanced metastatic thyroid cancer . Design : Participants screen : Medical history Physical exam Blood urine test Electrocardiogram ( ECG ) heart test . Review symptoms perform normal activity A scan performed . Some compute tomographic scan ( CT ) take picture body use small amount radiation . Some magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) use magnetic field take picture . Bone scan ( participant ) FDG PET scan produce tumor image . A sample tumor previous surgery . They may biopsy tumor tumor sample available previous surgery . Participants give CUDC-907 tablet form . They take mouth day 5 day , take 2 day , week . While take study drug , participant study visit repeat screen test . After stop treatment , participant 3 follow-up visit year . They repeat test . Then participant contact phone e-mail every 6 month ... .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>CUDC-907 Treatment People With Metastatic Locally Advanced Thyroid Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Background : - There standard effective systemic therapy metastatic locally advance poorly differentiate undifferentiated thyroid cancer . - Poorly differentiate undifferentiated thyroid cancer aggressive , high mortality . - CUDC-907 first-in-class dual inhibitor HDAC PI3K signal . - Approximately 80 % poorly differentiate undifferentiated thyroid cancer driver mutation PI3K/AKT pathway activation pathway . - HDAC2 upregulated poorly differentiate undifferentiated thyroid cancer , aggressive variant differentiate thyroid cancer , CUDC-907 treatment reduces HDAC2 level thyroid cancer cell . - CUDC-907 inhibits thyroid cancer cell growth , invasion migration vitro . - In addition inhibit PI3K/AKT signal pathway , CUDC-907 inhibit EGFR/RAS/RAF/MEK/ERK signal pathway , also activate poorly differentiate undifferentiated thyroid cancer . - CUDC-907 inhibits growth metastasis mouse model metastatic thyroid cancer . - We hypothesize CUDC-907 cause cancer regression patient metastatic locally advance poorly differentiate undifferentiated thyroid cancer , aggressive variant differentiate thyroid cancer . Objective : -To determine response CUDC-907 treatment RECIST criterion patient locally advance metastatic poorly differentiate undifferentiated thyroid cancer , aggressive variant differentiate thyroid cancer . Eligibility : - Age great equal 18 year - Thyroid cancer refractory relapse standard treatment . - Aggressive thyroid cancer confirm histology cytologic analysis . - Measurable disease . - Last dose chemotherapy last radiotherapy treatment 4 week prior start treatment protocol . Design : - Open label , phase II trial determine response CUDC-907 treatment . - Patients give 60 mg CUDC-907 orally 5 consecutive day follow 2 day ( 5/2 schedule ) . - One cycle 21 day . Patients may continue treatment disease progression . - Initial anatomic functional imaging perform enrollment 2 cycle treatment . Thereafter , anatomic imaging perform every two cycle treatment .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>INCLUSION CRITERIA : Subjects great equal 18 year age . Thyroid cancer histology cytology aggressive ( anaplastic/undifferentiated thyroid cancer , poorly differentiate thyroid cancer , h ( SqrRoot ) rthle cell carcinoma , tallcell variant papillary thyroid cancer , sclerosing variant papillary thyroid cancer ) . Measurable disease . Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group ( ECOG ) performance status 0 2 . Absolute neutrophil count great equal 1,000/microL Platelets great equal 75,000/microL Creatinine less equal 1.5 time upper limit normal ( ULN ) creatinine clearance &gt; 60ml patient creatinine level 1.5 time institutional ULN ( calculate base age , weight sex Total bilirubin less equal 1.5 time ULN ; AST/ALT le equal 2.5 time ULN . For subject document liver metastasis , AST/ALT may less equal 5 time ULN . Recovery Grade 1 baseline toxicity due prior anticancer therapy ( exclude alopecia ) . Platelet transfusion help patient meet eligibility criterion allow within 3 day prior screen CBC Cycle 1 , Day 1 treatment . Women child bear potential must negative serum pregnancy test . The effect CUDC907 develop human fetus unknown . For reason , woman childbearing potential men must agree use adequate contraception ( hormonal barrier method birth control ; abstinence ) prior study entry , duration study participation 30 day follow last study treatment . Should woman become pregnant suspect pregnant partner participate study , inform treat physician immediately . Able provide write informed consent follow protocol requirement . EXCLUSION CRITERIA : Systemic anticancer therapy within 4 week study entry . Other investigational agent within 4 week prior study treatment . Pregnant woman exclude study potential risk teratogenic abortifacient effect CUDC907 unknown . Because unknown potential risk adverse event nurse infant secondary treatment mother CUDC907 , breastfeed discontinue mother treated CUDC907 . These potential risk may also apply agent use study . Diabetes mellitus control medication . Serious infection require intravenous antibiotic therapy within 14 day prior study treatment . Evidence central nervous system metastasis . Uncontrolled severe cardiovascular disease , include myocardial infarction , unstable angina , atrial fibrillation ( AFib ) within 6 month prior study treatment , New York Heart Association ( NYHA ) Class II great congestive heart failure , serious arrhythmia require medication treatment , clinically significant pericardial disease , cardiac amyloidosis , QTc Fridericia ( QTcF ) correction unmeasurable great equal 480 msec screen ECG . ( Note : QTcF great equal 480 sec screen ECG , ECG may repeat twice least 24 hour apart ; mean QTcF three screen ECGs must &lt; 480 msec order meet eligibility trial participation ) . Gastrointestinal disease disorder could interfere swallow , oral absorption , tolerance CUDC907 . This include uncontrolled diarrhea ( &gt; 1 watery stool/day ) , major abdominal surgery , significant bowel obstruction and/or gastrointestinal disease could alter assessment pharmacokinetics safety , include limited : irritable bowel syndrome , ulcerative colitis , Crohn disease hemorrhagic coloproctitis . Unstable clinically significant concurrent medical condition would , opinion investigator , jeopardize safety subject and/or compliance protocol . Second primary malignancy within 2 year study entry adequately treat nonmelanoma skin superficial bladder cancer , curatively treat carcinoma situ cervix curatively treat solid tumor deem investigator low risk recurrence .</criteria>
