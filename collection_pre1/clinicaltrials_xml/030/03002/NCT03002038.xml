	<brief_title>Comparison Clinical Effects Azathioprine Rituximab NMO-SD Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Neuromyelitis Optica Spectrum Disorder ( NMO-SD ) recurrent inflammatory demyelinate disease affect central nervous system . The disease clinically recognize optic neuritis transverse myelitis associate high risk mortality . Each attack worsen patient ' disability . This mean 5 year disease onset , half patient need use wheelchair approximately 50 % become blind . Considering disease disabling patient , maintenance treatment applied addition treatment acute attack , order prevent future recurrence . Acute attack usually treat high dos intravenous corticosteroid . Plasmapheresis also use patient fail response corticosteroid . B lymphocyte inhibitor use maintenance therapy patient . First line therapeutic medication include azathioprine rituximab recommend long term therapy second line medication include methotrexate mycophenolate mofetil . Azathioprine immune-modulatory agent available oral form n't require hospitalization administer , however , side effect bone marrow suppression hepatotoxicity , periodic check blood cell liver enzymes need . Rituximab cluster differentiation antigen 20 inhibitor lead decrease B lymphocyte antibody patient . This medication available injectable form need hospitalization administer . Close monitory need administration consider severe side effect allergic reaction respiratory distress . However , laboratory test need patient take rituximab although expensive azathioprine . No clinical trial perform previously compare clinical efficacy two drug NMO-SD patient . Therefore , aim compare efficacy randomize clinical trial .</detailed_description>
