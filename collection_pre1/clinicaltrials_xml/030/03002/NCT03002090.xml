	<brief_summary>Iron deficiency know negatively impact physical performance , attention , time spent physical activity . As result , iron deficient person must expend energy complete amount work someone healthy . Another interesting relationship observe exercise training iron status woman participate exercise training often high rate iron deficiency sedentary woman . ID commonly treat use daily iron supplementation . However , currently unknown whether participate regular exercise somehow impact effectiveness iron supplementation . Iron deficient woman participate exercise program may potentially benefit less iron supplementation . Another common treatment symptom iron deficiency traditional Chinese herbal treatment , Ba-Zhen-Ke-Li ( BZKL ) . While study show BZKL impact expression iron-related protein increase endurance performance rat , study examine efficacy BZKL improve iron marker physical performance human . This study compare efficacy BZKL improve iron status physical performance ferrous sulfate supplementation . The Cornell research team achieve objective collaboration colleague Kunming Medical University ( KMU ) Kunming , China . A double-blind , randomize , placebo control study conduct Cornell graduate student KMU . The subject healthy woman , age 18-26 year , attend KMU . Blood sample collect analyzed measure iron ) . Subjects randomly assign receive 50 mg ferrous sulfate ( 10 mg elemental iron ) , 6mg BZKL , identical placebo pill twice daily 8 week . Subjects randomly sub-divided receive aerobic exercise train train 8-week supplementation period . At week 4 8 , subject perform series test perform baseline . The investigator hypothesize : 1. woman train receive iron small improvement iron status train 2 . The woman receive iron train great improvement physical performance train receive iron , 3 . The woman receive BZKL improve iron status physical performance receive placebo .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Defining Functional Role Iron Aerobic Training Physical Performance</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Background : Despite overall improvement malnutrition Chinese population , iron deficiency ( ID ) iron deficiency anemia ( low iron low hemoglobin , IDA ) still widely prevalent China . According recent study , prevalence anemia Chinese woman childbearing age 20 % high 30 % rural area , 85 % anemia case result ID . Diabetes , heart disease , obesity also highly prevalent China - though Chinese government take action epidemic , often via intervention promote physical activity . Iron deficiency without anemia ( IDNA ) impair adult physical performance lower time spend voluntary physical activity . However , iron supplementation intend alleviate IDNA may less effective physically active , suggest intricate , currently undefined , relationship iron status , exercise , physical performance capacity . A combined analysis iron status , exercise training , physical performance Chinese woman could illuminate interaction factor role diabetes obesity reduction . One common treatment symptom iron deficiency traditional Chinese herbal treatment , Ba-Zhen-Ke-Li ( BZKL ) . While study show BZKL impact expression iron-related protein increase endurance performance rat , study examine efficacy BZKL improve iron marker physical performance human . This study compare efficacy BZKL improve iron status physical performance ferrous sulfate supplementation . Significance Specific Aims : The goal propose research clarify relationship iron status , physical performance , aerobic exercise training . By conduct iron intervention study combination exercise training program , investigator examine modify effect iron status physical performance change aerobic exercise training well modify effect participation aerobic exercise maintenance iron status . To achieve goal , randomize double-blind , placebo control trial conduct Chinese collegiate woman . The proposed work organize along three specific aim : Aim I : To determine change iron status , alone combination exercise training , influence physical performance . Hypothesis : Subjects improve iron status receive exercise training show improvements physical performance great additive improvement result either treatment alone . This result would suggest iron replete individual benefit exercise training iron deficient . Aim II : To determine aerobic exercise training affect maintenance iron homeostasis . Hypothesis : Subjects participate exercise training show small improvement iron status iron supplementation sedentary subject receive iron supplementation . This would suggest regular exercise training negatively impact iron absorption , iron excretion and/or iron homeostasis . Aim III : To determine whether BZKL use alternative iron supplementation improve iron status physical performance iron deficient , non-anemic woman . Hypothesis : Those woman receive BZKL improve iron status physical performance measure receive placebo . The propose research Aims 1 2 important know explanation observe relationship iron , exercise training , physical performance IDNA . This research allow clarification role iron status play modify effect exercise train physical performance well whether participation exercise impact effectiveness iron supplementation improve iron status . The long-term significance research establish relationship current understand iron status impact impact aerobic exercise physical performance . This knowledge could lead improved physical activity intervention , help reduce chronic disease like obesity diabetes population high prevalence ID , U.S. China . It also help inform iron intervention design alleviate ID physically active population , rural Chinese laborer woman develop country participate aerobic train improve fitness . Research Design Methods : Participants female subject age 18-26 year low body iron normal hemoglobin ( Hb ) level , ( ferritin &lt; 20 μg/L Hb &gt; 120 g/L ) otherwise healthy . The study randomize double-blind , placebo control trial 3x2 design . Power calculation base pilot study perform investigator Shanghai 2013 study Brownlie et al . Sample size calculate require 24 woman per group , expand 29 subject per group allow sample dropout . Subjects randomize receive either 50mg ferrous sulfate capsule twice day ( 20mg elemental iron/day ) , 6 mg BaZhen KeLi , identical placebo capsule 8 week . Half supplement group also randomly assign receive 8 week aerobic exercise training ( 5 days/week , 25 minutes/day ) training . At week 0 , 4 , 8 subject complete following : 1 . Anthropometric measurement ( height , weight , skinfold thickness ) 2 . Physical activity 4-day dietary intake questionnaire 3 . Resting venous blood draw iron status assessment 4 . Exercise testing ( VO2max test energetic efficiency test ) To address Aims 1 2 , investigator compare energetic efficiency , maximum ability use oxygen , ventilatory threshold , blood lactate concentration baseline , supplementation ( placebo ) , exercise training ( train ) . The 3x2 study design allow determination whether subject receive iron benefit exercise training . The investigator also examine whether participate exercise training affect iron homeostasis lower iron status .</detailed_description>
