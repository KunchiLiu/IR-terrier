	<brief_title>Effects Exercise Program Health Outcomes People With Diabetic Foot Ulcers</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>People diabetes risk life-altering complication comorbidities . One serious complication diabetic foot ulcer , significantly increase risk limb amputation . To heal diabetic foot ulcer , patient often instruct refrain bearing weight affect limb . This non-weight bearing protocol result extend period inactivity lead severe physical deconditioning , include diminished strength , endurance , flexibility . EnhanceFitness , community exercise program design old adult , hold class adapted people non-weight bearing due heal foot ulcer . These exercise class focus specifically strength training , aerobic fitness , stretch - activity counteract progressive deconditioning people diabetic foot ulcer . Health benefit associate exercise people diabetes well-established . However , experience decline health physical function healing protocol diabetic foot ulcer , potential benefit exercise yet know . The propose project aim address gap diabetes research . The long-term goal research improve health quality life people complication diabetes . The specific goal project evaluate effect seat community exercise program , EnhanceFitness , clinically-meaningful outcome people diabetic foot ulcer . Study investigator recruit people diabetic foot ulcer local wound care clinic randomly assign two group . The first group engage EnhanceFitness , exist community fitness program appropriate people weight-bearing restriction due wound-healing protocol . The second group receive standard care , include exercise recommendation . To assess effectiveness seat exercise program , investigator compare important health outcome people diabetic foot ulcer participate EnhanceFitness control group diabetic foot ulcer . Specifically , investigator assess physical physiological outcome , include glycated hemoglobin ( HbA1c ) , lower-extremity strength , wound heal . The investigator also measure psychosocial outcome , depression , perceive physical function , overall health , self-reported ability continue exercise . Further , investigator evaluate feasibility conduct research assess effect seat exercise people foot ulcer . The data collect pilot research use apply large , extramural funding aim mitigate physical deconditioning people diabetic foot ulcer .</detailed_description>
