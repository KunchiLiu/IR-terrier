	<brief_title>Improving Medical Care With Electronic Interventions Based Automated Text Phone Messages</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Telemedicine modern field clinical medicine strives incorporate telecommunication information technology diagnose manage health care distance . Interventions range telephone reminder remote physician consultation stream webcam . Simple technology telephone SMS texting become increasingly ubiquitous form communication show potential clinical benefit improve patient adherence , well promote education engagement . Existing research telephone reminder family base contract show effective increase adherence treatment session hemodialysis improve overall appointment attendance outpatient clinical system . Unfortunately , compliance rate also find decrease within three month period intervention discontinue . The big obstacle clinic implement maintaining system cost associated run program , primarily cost employing staff make phone call continuous follow-up . Electronic system provide reminder patient preferred time , preferred format , text message phone call . In study primary care outpatient appointment attendance , show rate reduce electronic reminder 10 % . By cost-benefit analysis , determine financially beneficial generate reminder message patient no-show probability 5 % . There conflict data whether personal call clinical staff member automatically generate call/text message great efficacy reduce missed appointment , however , type reminder well-received cause patient disturbance automate call pose less burden already-strained health resource . Although specialized electronic reminder application via smartphone tablet device exist today , device skill require navigate may consistent old , chronic disease population , dialysis , congestive heart failure , COPD . The investigator thereby hypothesize simpler Epharmix ( EPX ) system , use simple platform SMS phone call automate specialized reminder able reach many benefit electronic system , fraction cost . Besides purpose provide timely reminder , platform easily adapt educational engagement clinical goal . In outpatient epilepsy population , SMS-based intervention show feasible effective improving patient education perception . Another application high clinical value increase frequency physician-patient contact , via electronic intervention , reduce delay acquire critical biometric clinical data patient time . The motivation goal come several field shortage physician limit prompt diagnosis care . In particular , average wait time appointment specialist physician , neurologist , approximately 30 day . In pediatric neurology , situation even bad , average wait time 35 day 39 % child 's hospital report wait time 12 month new patient see neurologist . Psychiatry experience degree delay . Psychiatric patient average wait 25 day first appointment . Finally , even generalist practice overbooked , lead lack reporting fall geriatric patient 2-3 month later [ internal data ] congestive heart failure patient wait 1-2 month see physician report change weight breathe difficulty [ internal data ] . Given standard medication treatment adjustment depend information must wait office visit , prolong wait time create major gap recognition symptom adverse event , actual follow management . While theoretically possible accelerate patient 's time drug adjustment adverse event report call physician 's office scheduling earlier appointment , data , investigator ' knowledge , exist utilization alternative option . Various paper home diary , mood chart psychiatry , available follow patient data ; however , low compliance patient fill chart bring diary next visit . Online variant diary show almost double reporting rate . In comparison , expensive complicate device develop address similar problem . Wearable implantable EEG-based seizure monitor system development , thus far tested subject history refractory epilepsy . Home health weight monitor device available , demonstrate high cost limit broad application , provide conjunction home health care [ internal data ] . In addition , complicate telehealth monitoring , ask 10 question per call , multiple trigger actually induce negligible effect treatment outcomes patient congestive heart failure . In comparison , implantable sensor CHF demonstrate increase patient survival . An electronic intervention platform develop Epharmix , Washington University St. Louis ( WUSTL ) IDEA Labs ( ideas.wustl.edu ) team , capacity use SMS text message pre-recorded phone message various adherence track data collection application , order supplement clinical care . Specific message include proactively ask patient designate patient advocate patient experience medical event recently ; request specific care-related information , glucose value , current mood , medication adherence ; provide health care education , i.e . patient experience physical symptom . Patients receive message also provide key contact information designate health care provider promote patient engagement , well prompt appropriate medical intervention . The service maintain dedicate SMS phone line record event adverse reaction . Events designate critical prompt immediate phone base follow-through appropriate nursing staff . All record event available review patient 's health care provider . The intervention design reach patient , engage patient provider communication allow physician respond concern rapidly . This intervention may supplement patient-doctor relationship potentially improve clinical outcome , increase adherence , reduce time optimal health . Overall , study aim determine whether electronic intervention system , send SMS text message phone call proactively improve medical care outcome variety healthcare setting . Specifically , two aim : 1 ) To test Epharmix reminder improve adherence physician request action , appointment , medication , etc . 2 ) To test Epharmix platform use collect clinical data ( e.g . weight , blood sugar , disease specific event ) time later physician analysis . Procedures : Patients Washington University , Barnes Jewish Hospital St. Louis Children 's Hospital include study . Two cohort prospectively identify , one group consist adult individual age &gt; 18 , one group pediatric patient age 5 &lt; 18 . Patients cohort recruit randomize either experimental control group disease match control group . The experimental group receive electronic intervention feature automate SMS text message and/or phone call describe ; control group receive electronic intervention , may receive placebo version intervention . Pediatric geriatric patient may SMS phone message also send designate caregiver . Subjects ability opt study electronically via text phone point study .</detailed_description>
