	<brief_summary>Background . Numerous study investigate high-dose corticosteroid cardiac surgery , mixed result lead ongoing variation practice around world . The Dexamethasone Cardiac Surgery-II Trial ( DECS-II ) study compare high-dose dexamethasone placebo patient undergoing cardiac surgery . Methods . We discuss rationale conduct DECS-II , 2800-patient , pragmatic , multicenter , assessor-blinded , randomized trial cardiac surgery , feature DECS-II study design ( objective , end point , target population , balance cluster base practice preference post-randomization consent , treatment , patient follow-up analysis ) . Conclusions . The DECS-II Trial use novel , efficient trial design evaluate whether high-dose dexamethasone patient-centered benefit enhance recovery increase number day home cardiac surgery .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>High-dose corticosteroid attenuate inflammatory response surgery CPB commonly use country , uncommonly US , Canada Australia . Steroids reliably attenuate activation complement pathway associate cardiac surgery , clinical trial mixed result . The current evidence dominate result two recent large randomize trial : DECS ( n=4,494 ) 6 SIRS ( n=7,507 ) . Both DECS SIRS assign patient undergo cardiac surgery CPB receive either high intraoperative dose steroid ( dexamethasone 1 mg/kg , methylprednisolone 500 mg , respectively ) placebo . The point estimate trial suggest possible reduction serious complication mortality . Planned subgroup analyse DECS trial steroid reduce incidence respiratory failure ( 3.0 % vs. 4.3 % , P=0.02 ) , infection ( 9.5 % vs. 14.8 % , P=0.009 ) , shorten hospital stay ( median 8 [ 7-13 ] vs. 9 [ 7-13 ] day , P=0.009 ) .6 Severe renal failure ( need RRT ) reduce , 0.4 % vs. 1.0 % , P=0.04.8 But SIRS find methylprednisolone associate high incidence myocardial injury ( measure elevation CK-MB enzyme ) . Nether trial identify high risk myocardial infarction ( MI ) . The methylprednisolone-induced elevation CK-MB may therefore class effect . Another compel find pre-planned subgroup analysis patient age group limit analysis age less 75 year DECS trial , dexamethasone reduce risk primary composite endpoint , RR 0.74 ( 95 % CI : 0.58-0.95 ) , P=0.017 ; well respiratory failure RR 0.62 ( 95 % CI : 0.42-0.91 ) , P=0.014 ; possibly mortality RR 0.53 ( 95 % CI : 0.26-1.10 ) , P=0.08.6 This age-interaction effect support demonstration increase C-reactive protein concentration young patient enrol DECS trial . Therefore , highly plausible prophylactic steroid suppress deregulate inflammation thus improve outcome cardiac surgery , use less elderly ( i.e . &lt; 75 year ) patient population . In retrospect , primary endpoint DECS SIRS trial challenge , use composite heavily weight thrombotic event ( MI , stroke ) specific inflammation ( respiratory failure , kidney injury , sepsis , prolong ICU hospital stay , mortality ) . We thus plan re-evaluate dexamethasone cardiac surgery , use patient-centred , clinically important endpoint focus enhanced recovery earlier hospital discharge : `` day alive home 30 day surgery '' .</detailed_description>
