	<brief_summary>Radium-223 indicated treatment patient mCRPC symptomatic bone metastasis know visceral metastatic disease . However , data report patient mCRPC asymptomatic mildly symptomatic . Recently , result International Expanded Access Program also suggest benefit radium-223 asymptomatic patient mCRPC . In addition , mechanism action radium-223 correlate presence/absence AR-V7 mutation , although issue yet evaluate . The aim study assess efficacy radium-223 asymptomatic patient mCRPC , establish association AR-V7 status radium-223 activity .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Trial Rad-223 Activity Asymptomatic Patients With mCRPC While Abiraterone Enzalutamide Besides AR-V7 Status</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Primary objective : To assess efficacy radium-223 asymptomatic patient mCRPC progress abiraterone acetate enzalutamide treatment . Primary endpoint : To determine efficacy radium-223 term radiological rPFS . Secondary objective : - Safety profile . - To determine association AR-V7 status ( positive vs. negative ) PFS . - To establish relationship CTCs number radium-223 efficacy . Secondary endpoint : Safety AEs evaluate use Common Terminology Criteria Adverse Events ( CTCAE ) US National Cancer Institute ( NCI ) version 4.0 [ 20 ] . Grade 3 4 AEs serious adverse event ( SAEs ) assess determine safety tolerability various combination drug . Efficacy - Radiographic progression-free survival ( rPFS ) depend AR-V7 status . - Overall survival ( OS ) . - Time first symptomatic skeletal event ( SSE ) . - Time PSA progression accord ALSYMPCA study criterion . - Determination percentage PSA progression . - Alkaline phosphatase level response ( AF ) , normalization alkaline phosphatase level , accord ALSYMPCA study criterion . Molecular aspect - Assessment AR-V7 mutation evolution study treatment . - Determination change CTCs number study treatment .</detailed_description>
