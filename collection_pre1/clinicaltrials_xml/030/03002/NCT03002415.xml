	<brief_summary>Acute dehydration elderly well-known clinical condition , although situation lead chronic dehydration elderly may quite frequent , poorly study . Metabolic change body water homeostasis influence provide chronic dehydration status reduce sensitivity thirst , antidiuretic hormone renal inability concentrate urine presence chronic disease use polypharmacy may also predispose state chronic dehydration . Due fact , study detect existence chronic dehydration state population elderly people highly justifiable . In addition , understand whether increased water intake , improve chronic dehydration , may improve renal function population seem great value , since simple inexpensive intervention , confirm , take institution , family member health promoter care cohabit elderly individual . Our main objective evaluate effect stimulate calculated water intake ( per kg patient weight ) state hydration renal function population elderly individual . It also within scope project evaluate presence chronic dehydration elderly patient well subgroup diabetic patient , compare different method evaluation renal function . Design : Clinical trial Randomized main objective cross-sectional study secondary objective . The principal hypothesis guide water intake improve renal function elderly patient .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>The Effect Water Intake State Hydration Renal Function Elderly Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Intervention : Verbal write guideline give patient ingest daily volume water calculate weight ( 30 ml / kg / day ) 14 day . Patients receive acrylic glass mark 200 ml instruct take number glass day correspond calculate volume ( 30 ml / kg ) . Patients also receive leaflet indicate many glass water need take . They also instruct mark `` X '' number glass water actually drank daily fourteen day intervention . Measurements tool ( apply first second visit ) - Laboratory test : serum urinary osmolality , sodium , urea serum creatinine . To evaluate effect hydration glycemic control diabetic patient , measurement fast glycaemia glycated hemoglobin ( enzymatic method HCLP ) also perform . These dosage perform HCPA Clinical Pathology Laboratory . - Non-invasive test : electrical bioimpedance ( BIA ) InBody 370® use evaluate amount free water , since simple , low cost easy perform outpatient clinic elderly patient . - Nutritional assessment : MAN questionnaire ( Mini nutritional assessment ) apply patient select study first second visit . Since valid questionnaire evaluate water intake find , MAN questionnaire choose contains question related water intake easy quick apply . - MiniMental : The MiniMental cognitive function test apply first visit observation period ( second visit ) . The questionnaire valid screening cognitive disorder simple quick method evaluate mental ability patient study . - Food record : sheet space designate fill food liquid quantity consume throughout day . Patients advise make four-day food diary 14 day . Renal function assess estimation formula ( recommend NKF KDIGO ) use serum creatinine ( CKD-EPI , MDRD BIS2 ) formula use cystatin C ( CKD- EPI-cys BIS 1 ) . The assessment GFR 51Cr-EDTA perform subgroup 15 patient arm study parallel manner intervention use 51Cr-EDTA intravenous single injection technique dose 150μCi blood sample take 2 , 3 4 hour later . Samples centrifuge 2 ml plasma pipetted duplicate gamma counter counting . An exponential equation evaluate plasma decay 51 Cr-EDTA , provide value GFR . Serum creatinine determine calibrated Jaffe method ( Roche ) , traceable isotopic dilution mass spectrometry ( ID-MS ) , kinetic reading minimize interference bilirubin . The dosage cystatin C perform immunoturbidimetry method ( Roche ) . The coefficient intra interassay variation 2.2 % 5.3 % , respectively .</detailed_description>
