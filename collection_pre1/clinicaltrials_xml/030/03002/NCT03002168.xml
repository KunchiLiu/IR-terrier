	<detailed_description>This single-center , randomize , double-blind , placebo control , two-way crossover trial healthy volunteer . The primary objective determine fat loss stool associate alpha-cyclodextrin use compare placebo use radiotracer . The study design include two treatment period , assign random order : - Treatment 1 consist subject receive α-CD meal contain fatty acid radiotracers - Treatment 2 consist subject receive placebo meal contain fatty acid radiotracers All subject randomize receive α-CD orally ingest two tablet contain α-CD , placebo , standardize liquid breakfast ( 100 µ Ci [ 3H ] triolein 20 µ Ci [ 14C ] tripalmitin ) . The tablet consume 150 ml still ( uncarbonated ) water immediately prior consume meal . Subjects observed period 48 hour in-patient , additional 24 hour out-patient follow breakfast meal contain radiotracers . During time participant undergo meal fatty acid metabolism study , hourly blood fecal sampling , assess meal fatty acid oxidation storage . The participant undergo ≥ 14 day washout period cross alternate treatment , evaluation repeat .</detailed_description>
