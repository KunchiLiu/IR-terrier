	<detailed_description>Objective : Our objective determine functional improvement see blind subject use BrainPort realize pediatric cohort . Specific Aims : The aim proposal evaluate non-surgical visual prosthetic ( BrainPort vision device ) enable blind appreciate immediate surroundings determine way brain interprets information . Our main goal determine device use pediatric population measure subject ' improvement baseline follow area : light detection , light localization , movement perception , standardize object recognition task use BrainPort . As second aim , use multimodal MR scan session study neurophysiological basis sensory substitution child . Under aim pursue two main objective . First , correlate behavioral data image data order detect region brain structure and/or function associate successful use sensory substitution device . Second , utilize data along previously collect adult data model effect prior visual experience visual cortex plasticity due blindness . Background : The BrainPort vision device visual prosthetic design blind . It enable perception visual information use tongue camera system pair substitute eye . Visual information collect video camera translate gentle electrical stimulation pattern surface tongue . With training , user perceive shape , size , location motion object environment . It functional , non-surgical device develop demonstrate aid visually impaired . Tactile sensory system prove capable carry information brain usually acquire visually . Braille long cane provide information blind person decade , 1960 's clearly demonstrate tactile input could provide access write print1 visual images2 . The main limitation development practical vision substitution inadequacy brain-machine interface . Thirty-five year ago Paul Bach-y-Rita , MD write `` That successful sensory substitution system presently use may due limited functional capability brain ; may due fact artificial receptor system yet construct challenge adaptive capacity human brain '' 3 . BrainPort Vision Device Since 1998 , Wicab focus biomedical engineering research development commercial device base proprietary BrainPort® technology4 . The BrainPort vision device visual prosthetic design blind . Numerous previous study support use tongue sensory substitution channel2,3,5-8 . Our others ' research reveal brain correctly interpret information sensory substitution device , even information present pathway natural sensory system . For example , optical image actually receive eye travel far retina , convert image spatio-temporal pattern action potential along optic nerve fiber . By analyze impulse pattern , brain recreates image . These impulse unique vision . In fact , sensory system code information use 'language ' : neuronal action potential . Using vision example paradigm , sensory substitution require action potential accurately entrain alternate sensory information channel . With training , brain may learn appropriately interpret information alternate channel process information much would data intact natural sense . Therefore , technology benefit user stimulate tongue usable information environment , user describe resemble vision . Although BrainPort technology stimulate tongue electrode array , stimulation painful ; BrainPort device emit 11.85 µJ per pulse ( regulatory limit cutaneously electrical stimulate device : 300 mJ ) . In fact , user often report sensation like champagne bubble effervesce tongue . Participants use BrainPort device , whether several hour day course week 20 minute day one year , report discomfort . Little work do use image study blind child . Werth Seelos use fMRI measure evoke activity visual cortex child evidence visual function improvement follow field training ( Neurpsychologica . 2005 . 43 ( 14 ) : 2011 ) . However , knowledge , image blind child assess plasticity visual cortex young age do . In short term , image subject may improve ability screen patient would benefit sensory substitution device well evaluate train paradigm . In long term , understand plasticity due visual deprivation important sensory substitution , vision restoration strategy order identify subject still capable process visual input . As attempt model effect prior visual experience plasticity visual cortex follow blindness , child represent unique essential portion sample tease apart relative effect blindness duration early versus late acquisition . The BrainPort device approve FDA since June 2015 . Significance : The BrainPort vision device visual prosthetic design blind . It enable perception visual information use tongue camera system pair substitute eye . Visual information collect video camera translate gentle electrical stimulation pattern surface tongue . With train user perceive shape , size , location motion object environment . It functional , non-surgical device develop demonstrate aid visually impaired . The BrainPort vision device new technology likely available near term address safety mobility issue result blindness . Our result show use BrainPort result behavioral improvement well activation visual cortical region use fMRI PET scan adult . A trial seek determine functional ability also improve pediatric cohort justifiable follow reason : 1 . Neuroplasticity high childhood , visually deprive brain likely receptive alternative sensory stimulation age group . 2 . The BrainPort non-invasive . 3 . Other gene therapy Leber 's Congenital Amaurosis , alternative restore vision blind child time . 4 . The BrainPort already CE Mark approval pending FDA approval ( final safety study document submit FDA August 2013 ) , available purchase 2014 , least Europe Canada . Whether device could useful pediatric population important clinical question . 5 . The relation anticipate benefit risk present study least favorable subject provide available alternative approach ( blind training ) .</detailed_description>
