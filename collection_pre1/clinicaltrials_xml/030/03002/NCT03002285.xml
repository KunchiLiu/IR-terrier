	<brief_summary>Introduction : Cerebral palsy ( CP ) non-progressive disorder brain make control execution movement difficult . One possible way analyze motor control individual could analysis movement speed accuracy . Objective : To verify speed-accuracy trade-off individual CP . Method : 96 individual evaluate , 48 CP 48 typical development ( TD ) , match age sex . The software use `` Fitts ' Reciprocal Aiming Task v.1.0 ( Horizontal ) '' , perform computer use external optical mouse , progressive index difficulty ( IDs ) : ID2 , ID4a ID4b . Each index difficulty perform three time total time/touches capture .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The software use study `` Fitts ' Reciprocal Aiming Task v.1.0 ( Horizontal ) '' develop Okazaki , public domain available Internet , perform Toshiba notebook® , model Satellite A60-S1561 System Unit , use external optical mouse , Fortrek® OM-302 . This instrument use verify motor control analysis speed accuracy movement , determine log-linear relation movement time task difficulty use mathematical equation , analyze Fitts ' law , describes relation movement accuracy speed , associate target size distance11 . Thus , task use study compose target different size , small target require time execute due necessity increase accuracy , distance target reduce , speed movement becomes great accuracy decrease . In relation target size ( W ) distance target ( D ) , equation log2 ( 2D/W ) result index difficulty ( ID ) , high ID , difficult task , fact necessitates great movement time . To evaluate speed accuracy , two different index difficulty use study ( ID2 ID4 ) . The difficulty level increase change width distance bar . In addition , ID4 use two different way ( ID4a ID4b ) , distance bar width different , ID maintain . 3 Procedure design The experiment compose three trial two IDs : 2 4 ( ID 4 two kind measurement - ID4a ID4b ) , participant perform task individually room , evaluator present , seat chair ( wheelchair ) , adjust height accord need individual . A footrest available , necessary . The computer place table , participant give instruction present task , individual , hear alarm computer , require click external mouse cursor two parallel bar arrange vertically , intermittently , great speed accuracy possible , period 10 second , follow second alarm indicate end attempt . Directly follow attempt , total movement time register , divide second obtain attempt number `` click '' target . If two click wrong , individual repeat task .
