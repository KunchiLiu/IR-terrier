	<brief_summary>The Investigator postulate use PESI addition routine clinical practice , oppose routine clinical practice base clinical judgment alone , help physician correctly identify PE patient low-risk adverse outcome . Considered low-risk patient could benefit short hospital stay , aim study demonstrate use PESI lead physician discharge patient earlier , thus reduce duration hospital stay PE patient ( primary outcome ) . Outpatients diagnose PE emergency department ( ED ) admit participate unit represent target population As availability DOACs may influence duration hospital stay , secondary objective present study : 1. demonstrate shorter hospital stay low-risk PE patient ( independently method use identify ) reduce incidence hospital-associated complication improve patient satisfaction quality life , without increase incidence PE-related complication 2. demonstrate use PESI , oppose clinical judgment alone , associate great proportion patient discharge early ( &lt; 72 hour ED admission ) treat entirely home ( &lt; 24 hour ED admission ) . 3. demonstrate use DOACs reduce duration hospital stay PE patient 4. demonstrate use DOACs , oppose standard treatment , associate great proportion patient discharge early ( &lt; 72 hour ED admission ) treat entirely home ( &lt; 24 hour ED admission ) .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>STUDY DESIGN Within 24 hour acute PE diagnosis , treat physician ( local Investigator ) centrally randomize . Treating physician ( local Investigator ) participate Units call coordinate centre phone randomization . Before randomization , order avoid influence treatment choice , treat physician ( local Investigator ) declare advance treatment strategy use patient ( intention-to-treat ) , i.e . standard treatment heparin plus vitamin K antagonist ( standard group ) DOACs ( DOACs group ) Randomization stratify treatment choice local Investigator . Each two 'intention-to-treat ' approach therefore randomize two arm , i.e . arm 1 arm 2 . Arm 1 : treating physician must formally calculate PESI report clinical record form* day hospitalization top routine clinical practice ( standard care ) Arm 2 : standard care ( i.e . formally calculation PESI top ) Randomization perform centrally 1:1 ratio , follow computer-generated list randomization . STUDY POPULATION 1.1 Population Randomised physician : Each Local Investigator participate canter . All participate centre Internal Medicine Unit . PE population : Consecutive adult outpatient age , gender race , objectively confirm diagnosis suspect unsuspected acute PE emergency department ( ED ) admit participate unit include . Suspected PE mean diagnosis make image test ( compute tomographic pulmonary angiography [ CTPA ] , pulmonary angiography , V/Q lung scan ) prescribe treat physician clinical suspicion PE . Unsuspected PE mean diagnosis make incidentally imaging test perform clinical indication ( e.g . cancer stag follow-up ) . Objective diagnosis acute PE mean : positive compute tomographic pulmonary angiography ( CTPA ) , positive pulmonary angiography , high-probability V/Q lung scan ( perfusion lung scan negative chest X-ray ) , intermediate probability V/Q perfusion lung scan proximal deep-vein thrombosis ( DVT ) document compression ultrasonography . 1.2 Sample size calculation The Investigators hypothesize distribution hospital stay duration PE standard deviation 4 day . The I vestigators also hypothesize mean duration hospital stay reduce least 15 % PE patient whose treat physician randomise formally use PESI 5 % PE patient whose treat physician randomise formally calculate PESI . Low-risk PE patient almost 50 % PE population . Therefore , α error 0.05 statistical power ( 1-β error ) 80 % , 200 patient group ( total 400 patient ) need enrol find statistically significant difference ( p &lt; 0.05 ) mean hospital stay length . As variable 'hospital stay length ' non-normal distribution need express reported median , 10 % extra patient need enrol reach statistically significant difference previous statistical assumption . Final total sample size , therefore , 440 patient ( 220 patient group ) OUTCOMES 1 . Main study parameter/endpoint The primary outcome median length hospital stay 2 . Secondary study parameters/endpoints The secondary efficacy outcome follow : 1. health-system measure - proportion patient undergoing short-hospital stay - proportion patient undergoing complete home-treatment - post-discharge hospital re-admission - post-discharge outpatient visit emergency department 2. patient-related outcome - quality life ( 5-point Likert scale questionnaire ) The safety outcomes follow : 1. overall mortality 2 . PE-related - PE-related mortality - recurrent PE and/or deep vein thrombosis ( DVT ) - major bleed - clinically relevant non-major bleed - minor bleed - anticoagulation-related complication ( hematoma/infection heparin fondaparinux injection site , heparin-induced thrombocytopenia ) 3 . Hospitalization-related - hospital-acquired infection ( pneumonia ; urinary tract infection ; ) - iatrogenic complication - immobilization syndrome - pressure sores Overall mortality , PE-related safety outcome , post-discharge hospital re-admission outpatient visit emergency department measure 14 day , 30 day , 90 day .</detailed_description>
