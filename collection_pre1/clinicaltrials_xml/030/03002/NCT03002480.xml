	<brief_summary>This pilot study investigate use thromboelastograph ( TEG ) determine primary bypassing agent management bleed child adult severe hemophilia A patient inhibitor . The study evaluate TEG profile available bypassing agent ( FEIBA rFVIIa ) participate patient , determine agent provide robust clot formation measure TEG . This study consist screen visit 2-4 pharmacokinetic study determine `` best '' bypass agent base TEG result . Patients assign bypass agent dose treatment bleed episode ( Prophylaxis On-demand ) . Each patient follow period 6 month monitor short-term safety patient whose bypass agent modify .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Currently , laboratory assay assess pharmaceutical activity available agent know collectively bypass agent , negatively impact treat physician 's ability manage patient , leave decision dose regimen trial error . Both agent , FEIBA recombinant activate factor VII ( rFVIIa ) , approve treatment bleed inhibitor patient recommend dose regimen base clinical trial . However , significant amount `` experimenting '' dose regimen use physician patient . The goal project demonstrate TEG excellent biomarker predicting , manage individualize treatment FEIBA rFVIIa rare difficult treat patient population .</detailed_description>
