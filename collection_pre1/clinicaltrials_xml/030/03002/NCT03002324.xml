	<detailed_description>Genital human papillomavirus ( HPV ) common sexually transmitted infection United States . Most HPV infection asymptomatic clear within 2 year persistent infection lead disease , include several cancer . Cervical cancer common cancer cause HPV infection , virtually cervical cancer attribute HPV infection . There cure HPV , HPV prevent vaccination . Current recommendation Advisory Committee Immunization Practices ( ACIP ) state HPV vaccine may give start 11-12 year age boys girl , age 26 . Despite safety efficacy vaccine , coverage among adolescent age 11-17 year old remain low . Attaining high vaccination rate among adolescent essential decrease burden disease due cervical cancer , cancer cause HPV . Parental decision vaccinate child , specifically HPV vaccine , tie multiple construct Health Belief Model . These include perceived susceptibility HPV infection ( child risk infection ) , perceived benefit , perceive severity ( disease , vaccine related adverse event ) . This would suggest message surround HPV vaccination highly salient within construct . The current message tie HPV vaccine present Centers Disease Control ( CDC ) focus HPV infection clinical nature . In randomized trial , parent give information HPV likely accept HPV vaccine likely get child vaccinate . Based literature , researcher hypothesize reframing message promote HPV vaccination mean protection cervical cancer impact intent vaccinate among parent adolescent female ( age 11-17 year old ) . In first phase study researcher assess appeal different moral foundation impact attitude towards vaccination intent vaccinate . For phase study , researcher conduct 3-arm randomized trial compare current CDC HPV , cervical cancer focus message develop study team , non-vaccine relate control passage among parent adolescent female . The goal trial determine new cervical cancer frame message increase impact intent daughter receive HPV vaccine trial period compare current CDC message . Additionally , researcher examine impact CDC message new message intent vaccinate compare non-vaccine relate control message . The participant 's vaccine belief intent vaccinate assess online survey baseline . Two week later , participant randomize view one three message : current CDC message , cervical cancer frame message , non-vaccine relate control message . Immediately afterwards , vaccine belief intent vaccinate assess determine impact message .</detailed_description>
