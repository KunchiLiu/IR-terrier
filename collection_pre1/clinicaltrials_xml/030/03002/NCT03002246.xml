	<brief_summary>This trial collaborative study 5 site worldwide . A total 600 research subject enrol . We investigate validity use 5D Limb Volume software improve estimate fetal weight prediction broad range gestational age . The purpose compare accuracy precision birth weight prediction base new technology compare current 2D birth weight prediction model .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Automated Fetal Weight Estimation : A Multicenter Validation Using Fractional Limb Volume</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Ultrasound use 20 year estimate fetal weight prior birth . Sometimes estimation always similar baby actually weigh . In addition regular measurement take routine ultrasound exam , 3D ultrasound baby 's arm leg soft tissue may give u precise information much baby weigh . This measurement call fractional limb volume . Fractional limb volume ( FLV ) soft tissue measurement arm thigh use evaluate body composition . This measurement mostly reflect fat muscle development small amount bone . The recent introduction 5D Limb Volume software ( Samsung , Seoul , Korea ) make possible efficiently reproducibly measure semi-automated FLV use computer guide technique . Subjects receive one ultrasound scan 4-7 day delivery . Both 2D 3D measurement take . These measurement use estimate fetal weight . We compare estimate weight actual birth weight order determine accuracy precision 5D Limb Volume technology . This data may also use develop new weight estimation model could provide good accuracy and/or precision currently provide use publish method .</detailed_description>
