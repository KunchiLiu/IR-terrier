	<brief_summary>Distant metastasis cancer remain major cause cancer death . One evidence rare cell shed primary tumor exist circulation cancer patient , proven related cancer relapse distant metastasis . The number circulate tumor cell ( CTCs ) expression status specific marker ( ) also correlate disease prognosis treatment effect , might change decision treatment . In recent year , specific disruptive gene discover , EGFR non-small cell lung cancer , KRAS colorectal cancer , response rate treatment , disease control survival much improve . However , molecular information obtain cancer tissue depend repeated biopsy , risky invasive cancer patient . By mean advance CTCs sample technique genetic analysis , repeat follow-up specific gene profile possible . However , protocol well-established mature , even correlation primary cancer tissue CTCs remain unknown . To tackle problem , aim project isolate high-purity CTCs optically induce dielectrophoresis ( ODEP ) -based device cell sort technique transfer next-generation sequencing ( NGS ) analysis specific disruptive gene . In first year project , investigator testify stabilize platform utilize healthy donor ' blood cancer cell line adjust detailed experiment condition . In follow year , investigator enroll newly diagnose metastatic cancer patient disruptive gene mutation ( ) follow event gene-based therapy . Comparison NGS information cancer tissue CTCs also make one major endpoint . In brief , investigator expect study could establish practical method get genetic information , reduce risk re-biopsy achieve ultimate goal precision medicine .</brief_summary>
