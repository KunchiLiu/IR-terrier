	<brief_title>Study Tofacitinib Refractory Dermatomyositis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Dermatomyositis ( DM ) rare , progressively debilitate disorder affect muscle ( cause weakness ) skin ( cause rash ) affect patient . DM also involve multiple body system include lung , joint , gut heart . Therapy DM involve administer corticosteroid , typically immunosuppressive agent , treatment option refractory DM limit . This research do determine safety effectiveness Janus kinase ( JAK ) inhibitor call Tofacitinib adult active , treatment-refractory dermatomyositis . The investigator also look specific biomolecular change blood , skin , muscle expose Tofacitinib . Tofacitinib approve Food Drug Administration ( FDA ) treatment rheumatoid arthritis . The study aim conduct 12-week , open-label , pilot study 10 patient refractory DM ass whether JAK inhibitor effectively safely reduce symptom DM skin muscle . This study consist 9 study visit 6 month . There optional treatment extension period 4 week . All subject undergo follow-up assessment 4 week stop treatment . Results study contribute design future trial define role JAK inhibitor treatment patient dermatomyositis .</detailed_description>
