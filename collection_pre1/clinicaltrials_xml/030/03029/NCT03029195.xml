	<detailed_description>Trial Design : The present randomized control clinical trial ( RCT ) perform two phase : • RCT- ( Phase I ) A control pre- post-clinical trial design quantitative evaluation NAM therapy maxillary geometry . • RCT- ( Phase II ) A post-test controlled clinical trial design quantitative evaluation NAM therapy nasal anthropometry . Infants nonsyndromic complete unilateral cleft lip palate UCLP select admit Maxillofacial Plastic surgery department- Faculty Dentistry- Alexandria University base inclusion exclusion criterion . Sample size : Using power 80 % detect clinically meaningful difference cleave gap distance ( D1-D2 ) apply NAM therapy = 5.8 , SD ( standard deviation ) =3.4 , effect size=1.2 α=0.05 . The minimal require sample size calculate twelve per group ( increase fifteen avoid drop out ) . The sample size calculate use G*Power software . Randomization : The randomization total 45 infant do follow : Thirty infant nonsyndromic UCLP randomly allocate use closed envelop allocation concealment method . However , fifteen normal infant randomly select . RCT- ( Phase I ) Study group ( Group I ) : 15 infant In group infant undergo presurgical nasoalveolar molding primary surgical correction - Control group ( Group II ) : 15 infant This group , infant undergo primary surgical correction without presurgical NAM procedure . RCT- ( Phase II ) - Norm group : ( Group III ) : 15 infant Age match noncleft infant . A group normal age match noncleft infant randomly select act norm nasal anthropometry Egyptian model , compare compare study control group . • Procedures Measurements : 1 . Procedures RCT- ( Phase I ) 1.1 . Case history , examination , diagnosis 1.2 . Impressions work cast : Following evaluation thorough explanation treatment goal procedure parent , impression intraoral cleft defect make use fast set alginate impression material load custom make tray make wax . With infant fully awake without anesthesia clinical setting prepare handle airway emergency surgeon present part impression team . During impression making , infant hold inverted position keep tongue forward allow fluid drain oral cavity . Once impression material set , tray remove , oral cavity examine residual impression material cleft region . Intraoral impression carefully pour regular dental stone , cast recover carefully . 1.3 . Fabrication appliance : The fabrication NAM appliance do follow technique describe Grayson et al . It include intraoral mold acrylic palatal plate nasal stent . All cast mark stored measurement . - The oral molding appliance : The cleft region palate alveolus fill wax approximate contour topography intact arch . The cast duplicate obtain work cast two layer wax adapted laboratory process use clear heat-cure acrylic resin fabricate mold prosthesis 2 3 mm thickness provide structural integrity permit adjustment mold therapy . The appliance finish polished ensure tissue border smooth oral portion appliance would contact dorsum tongue give high polish . At insertion appointment , appliance carefully fit infant 's oral cavity observe minute . The infant able suckle without gag struggle . - Extraoral retentive button : An extraoral retentive button fabricate self polymerize clear acrylic resin ( * ) position face downward labial flange , angle 40◦ relative plate , allow clearance upper low lip facilitate positive seating appliance palatal tissue . The appliance secure extraorally cheek bilaterally surgical tape orthodontic elastic end . The use skin barrier dress tape advocate reduce cheek irritation . • Retentive tap adhesive tape orthodontic elastic : The skin barrier dress tape first apply infant 's cheek , lateral superior commissure . These base tape also serve anchor thinner ( 0.25 × 4 inch ) tap suture strip use hold appliance palate . Small orthodontic elastic ( inner diameter 0.25 inch , wall thickness heavy ) incorporate loops thinner tape fold . The elastic band place retentive button , thinner tape pull secured base tape infant 's cheek posteriorly superiorly . An additional broader tape apply end thin tape anchor suture strip elastic band base tape . The parent provide detailed instruction proper method lip tap along tap material adhesive . The patient recall weekly basis follow-up . Before adjustment , appliance clean soap water . Adhesive tape elastic change every week maintain proper activation force mold alveolar segment . Instructions give keep appliance oral cavity 24 hour except cleaning . The tissue surface appliance modify allow selective pressure great less alveolar segment either side cleft correct alignment . • Nasal stent Within first month treatment , phase active nasal cartilage molding begin intraalveolar gap reduce approximately 6 mm incorporation nasal stent component . A nasal stent construct 0.019 inch round stainless steel wire . It extend forward curve backward form `` swan neck '' enter 3 4 mm past nostril aperture . Finally , superior aspect nasal stent cover thin layer soft liner ensure positive elastic pressure internal tissue nasal dome . The upper lobe insert nose gently lift toward dome moderate amount tissue blanch evident . The low lobe nasal stent lift nostril apex define top columella . Periodic examination tissue adjustment appliance continue every week mold nasoalveolar complex desire shape position . The endpoint treatment patient NAM inter-segment distance less 3 mm nasal cartilage , columella , philtrum properly reposition , ensure clinically desirable approximation alveolar segment . The infant schedule surgical repair plastic surgeon parent ' consent . 1.4 . Weekly adjustment visit Weekly adjustment require maximum effectiveness presurgical appliance . On visit , new impression take poured dental stone . This do examine cleft closure guide adjustment appliance modification . . Sporadic emergency appointment also need resolve ulceration may develop . RCT- ( Phase II ) 1.5 . Surgery The primary surgical closure lip nose perform 3 month age . The surgical technique perform accord Millard 's rotation/advancement technique . Because alveolar segment approximation , gingivoperiosteoplasty perform . Digital photos submento-vertical view take infant face surgical closure . ( T '' 0 = 10 day post-surgery ) ( T '' 1= 6 month post-surgery ) . 2 . Measurements : 2.1 . Quantitative 3D maxillary geometric analysis . 2.2 . Quantitative nasal anthropometric analysis photograph . ( Photogrammetry ) . RCT- ( Phase I ) 2.1 . Quantitative 3D maxillary geometric analysis : The impression maxillary cast would take initial visit ( T0 ; pre-NAM therapy ) , ( T2 NAM therapy ) ( T3 surgery ) undergo 3D laser scan computer aid design ( CAD ) analysis . The 3D model construct use laser scan machine ( 3Shape ) 3D software CAD analysis . Reference point line , base anatomic structure , identify digitized 3D model . The linear , angular , midline deviation , distance , curvature arch identify . After laser scanning , reference base plane set . The plane contain point locate incisal point ( A ) tuberosity point noncleft cleft side ( T1 , T2 ) define XY-plane ( horizontal reference plane ) . On 3D image , outline upper alveolar arch mark use six point contain anatomical landmark ( D1 , A , C1 , M1 , T1 major segment D2 , C2 , M2 , T2 minor segment ) . The curvature radius appropriate circle upper alveolar arch major minor segment ( R r , respectively ) calculate use software . The symmetry upper alveolar arch analyze calculate ratio curvature upper alveolar arch major minor segment ( R/r ratio ) use follow formula : R/r ratio = curvatures appropriate circle upper alveolar arch major segment ( R ) /the curvature appropriate circle upper alveolar arch minor segment ( r ) . The R/r ratio time lip palatal repair compare NAM non-NAM group . RCT- ( Phase II ) 2.2 . Quantitative nasal anthropometric analysis photograph ( Photogrammetry ) : Comparing affect unaffected side surgery direct digitization process nasal morphology surgical repair quantify geometry nasal cavity . Digital photograph take primary surgical repair infant head obtain submento-vertical view include recommend landmark . Landmarks , construct reference line anthropometric landmark face nose select extracted geometrical condition discriminate nostril coordinate . The algorithm aim simplify process extract Area Of Interest ( AOI ) , case face , extract Region ( ) Of Interest ( ROI ) , case eye , nose , etc . There two main step : I- Pre-processing step : 1 . This identify AOI Image threshold face boundary identify . 2 . Within AOI , facial feature identify eye use reference point define horizontal baseline . 3 . Vertical symmetry axis identify perpendicular line horizontal baseline passing mid point eye . II- Processing step : 4 . Get nose data ( ROI ) . 5 . Mirror normal side . 6 .
