	<detailed_description>Temporomandibular disorder ( TMD ) common chronic orofacial pain condition non-dental origin , prevalence general population 3.6 % 7 % . Despite sign symptom well described literature , still absence underlie pathophysiological mechanism . Evidence base strategy diagnosis management temporomandibular pain still n't available . Psychological mechanical stress factor could contribute oxidative stress ( OS ) lead TMD . Therefore , identification oxidative stress biomarkers would objectively indicate implication OS TMD pain onset mechanism , provide basis early detection , potential target therapeutic agent prevent progression severe dysfunction . Aim quantify salivary OS marker total antioxidant capacity ( TAC ) , well recently isolate endogenous peptide opiorphin ( OP ) ( 2006 Inst . Pasteur ) , TMD patient compare control . As chronic exposure stress may cause hyperalgesia result stress response hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal ( HPA ) axis , aim test underlie mechanism correlate OP OS marker salivary cortisol ( SC ) level . Hypotheses : OS role TMD onset maintenance , thus salivary marker OS increase and/or TAC decrease ; OP influence orofacial pain syndrome , TMD , salivary level differ TMD patient control . If decrease OP level TMD patient encounter , hypothesize OP downregulation contribute TMD onset analgesic effect absent . Conversely , increase OP level would suggest OP upregulated merely reaction painful stimulus . Disbalanced SC level TMD patient would corroborate involvement HPA axis TMD mechanism , know affect intensity OS . Saliva 50 TMD patient ( diagnose validate diagnostic criterion MRI ) 50 control collect . OS marker ( 8-hydroxydeoxyguanosine , malondialdehyde , etc . ) assess ELISA spectrophotometric detection spectrophotometric reagent kit . OP level measure HPLC-MS/MS method , originally develop validate team member . The electrochemiluminescence immunoassay ECLIA use measure SC . Pain stress subjectively assess use questionnaire : subject fill Perceived Stress Scale 10 ( PSS-10 ) ; TMD patient worst experience pain record use Visual Analogue Scale initial subsequent visit , well Graded Chronic Pain Scale ( GCPS ) , Visual Analogue Scale ( VAS ) , Patient Health Questionnaire ( PHQ ) , Jaw function limitation scale ( JFLS ) , Oral Behaviours Checklist Oral Health Impact Profile ( OHIP ) -14 . TMD patient randomize 2 treatment group ( 1 : stabilization splint + placebo pill ; 2 : placebo splint + 1g vitamin C daily ) . Measurements repeat 3 6 month treatment . Monitoring OP , OS marker SC period , depend observe change TMD symptom , elucidate underlie propose mechanism perform multivariate analysis include treatment outcomes . This translational research aim make basic science finding useful clinical application . Findings high concentration OS biomarkers would , besides significance `` piece puzzle '' TMD mechanism , could also important establishment TMD diagnosis prospective therapeutic target . Salivary opiorphin , due proven analgesic effect might additionally serve possible drug orofacial pain syndrome . Novel approach understand neuroendocrine mechanism TMD link OS , well use saliva non-invasively available diagnostic biofluid represent significant scientific advance .</detailed_description>
