	<brief_title>Scopolamine Patch Pharmacokinetics Healthy Adults</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Transdermal drug delivery system ( TDDS ) available form patch convenient , attractive , easy use system . Scopolamine patch popular TDDS available United States market today . Accurate determination rate extent drug release absorption crucial ensure safety individual use type patch . Delivery rate determine early development process use vitro skin flux permeation study , later human accurately quantify residual drug patch post-wear pharmacokinetic study . In proposal , investigator employ two type evaluation determine rate extent drug release absorption RLD ( reference list drug ) Transderm Scop® TDDS ( transdermal drug delivery system ) , namely residual drug analysis post-wear pharmacokinetic analysis healthy adult volunteer . In addition , investigator compare plasma drug concentration follow patch intravenous administration Scopolamine , order determine absolute bioavailability patch . The investigator conduct residual drug analysis TDDS follow vivo wear use highly sensitive validate quantification method . Positive outcome project identify appropriate method determine rate extent drug release absorption TDDS , help regulatory agency development Guidances Industry regard characterization drug release absorption kinetics ensure safety individual utilize type product</detailed_description>
