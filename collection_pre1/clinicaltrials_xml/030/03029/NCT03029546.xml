	<brief_summary>The investigator 's main objective analyze effect routine prenatal care screen tool ( glucola test gestational diabetes ) maternal inflammation assessment maternal circulatory biomarkers blood pressure . Improving knowledge routine prenatal care variety screen factor affect maternal physiology allow investigator educate informed caring mother medical co-morbidities . - Determine acute glucose load ( 50g ) associate in-vivo in-vitro increase concentration Advanced Glycation End Products ( AGEP 's ) , turn , impact vascular endothelial reactivity induce acute increase blood pressure . Previous study generate investigator ' laboratory show circulate soluble Receptor Advanced Glycation End Products ( sRAGE ) Tumor Necrosis Factor ( TNF ) -a ( mediator acute inflammation ) consider marker extent maternal RAGE activation and/or systemic inflammation , respectively . - Determine acute glucose load ( 50g ) time normal screen gestational diabetes induces acute increase level sRAGE TNF-a . If investigator ' hypothesis confirm , investigator strong confirmation involvement glycation product TNF-a generate acute negative clinical symptom woman experience glucose tolerance test , headache , nausea , sweating , bloating .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>A . Research Design Participants identify time prenatal care visit ( 24-28 week GA ) . The investigator ask permission participation research protocol . A waiver HIPPA add protocol explain source investigator might use screen eligible subject . The electronic medical record may access partial waiver review medical information make subject candidate protocol . The subject instruct benefit study participant eligible management influence participant 's decision volunteer . If patient agrees participate , participant give write consent read . The participant ask understanding , explain , question investigator need clarify . The informed consent obtain . No ad , flyer , website posting , recruitment letter , oral/written script involve recruitment patient . Interventions : 1 . Informed consent . 2 . Collection blood ( 5 cc one teaspoon whole blood ) urine ( 1/2 cup ) specimens prior administration 50 gr . glucola test . This protocol present arm study woman ( n=50 ) clinically indicate 1 hour glucose tolerance test diagnose gestational diabetes . 3 . Blood pressure measurement every 15 minute one hour . 4 . Collection second blood ( 5 cc one teaspoon whole blood ) , urine ( 1/2 cup ) specimen follow administration 50 gr . glucola test . Collection blood time clinically indicated test abnormal clinical value might classify patient gestational diabetic . 5 . In separate group woman classify healthy pregnant control ( n=50 ) investigator obtain informed consent use protocol similar one described . 6 . Collection blood ( 5 cc one teaspoon whole blood ) , urine ( 1/2 cup ) specimen perform prior administration 50 cc plain water . 7 . Blood pressure measurement perform every 15 minute one hour . d. Collection second blood ( 5 cc one teaspoon whole blood ) , urine ( 1/2 cup ) sample occur end hour . B . Sample Participants enrol base eligibility one hour GTT . Chart review clinic schedule perform week prior identify target population recruitment 24-28 week gestation need diabetes screen . 50 pregnant woman high risk clinic present diabetes screen routine prenatal visit recruit enrollment . This population risk subsequent adverse pregnancy outcome , investigator evaluate biomarkers , advance glycation end product , affect follow glucose load diabetes screen . 50 healthy pregnant woman general obstetric clinic McCampbell Hall recruit control ingest 50cc sample water undergo identical objective measurement ( blood pressure measurement urine/ blood sample ) glucose load subject . Biomarker analysis compare glucose load population . These patient serve control undergo clinically indicate glucola screen another visit 24-28 week gestation . Exclusion criterion include : 1 . Non-English-speaking subject exclude due inability appropriately consent . 2 . Non-pregnant patient exclude since study maternal tissue pregnancy outcomes related exposure pregnancy . 3 . Men exclude since study include pregnant woman nature research . 4 . Prisoners exclude avoid potential coercion 5 . Minors 18 year age exclude due lack ability consent without legal guardian . 6 . Patients contra-indications glucola test gestational diabetes screen exclude , bariatric surgery , inflammatory bowel disease partial bowel resection , mal-absorptive condition . C. Measurement/ Instrumentation 50 pregnant patient 24 28 week gestation undergo routine screen gestational diabetes use 50g glucose load recruit . Following enrollment , maternal blood urine specimen obtain outline . Blood pressure record . For type study design patient serve participant 's control . Additionally , 50 healthy pregnant patient recruit perform test similar diabetes screen use water serve additional control . Advanced Glycation End Products among protein analyze specimen . Using standard immunoassay procedure available laboratory , investigator perform parallel proteomics analysis urine maternal blood addition placental evaluation follow delivery . Advanced Glycation End Products TNF-A focus , , perform proteomics study biological sample , investigator hope discover biomarkers biological pathway might responsible clinical manifestation test . The newly discover key protein important regulatory protein pathways potentially target identify treat diabetes medical condition pregnancy . D. Detailed Study Procedures Women recruit OSUMC High Risk Low risk Clinics , Labor Delivery . Clinical data study abstract subject 's medical record . Potential hazard relate risk additional blood draw outside routine prenatal care . These risk include bruising , discomfort pain site , infection , fainting . The risk perceive minimal , patient compensate time willingness undergo discomfort additional blood draw . Subjects cod number 1 100 . In addition , specimen cod letter code follow number consecutive number . The PI create computer worksheet name medical record subject link coded information subject cod specimen number . The computer desktop hold worksheet Public Health Information ( PHI ) disk encryption . One copy consent form keep secure locked cabinet PI 's office also lock . The subject 's name keep separate result . No report communicate back subject include medical record , since affect pregnancy , labor post-delivery care manage . Only subject 's doctor researcher know subject 's participation study . No public disclosure information make . E. Internal Validity To avoid study bias , also employ follow : 1 . Use internal control external control group 2 . Use consecutive enrolled patient F. Data Analysis Statistical comparison group perform use Student Mann-Whitney test Two-way repeat analysis variance ( ANOVA ) follow post hoc Holm-Sidak test appropriate . Pearson product moment correlation use estimate association variable . A p= &lt; 0.05 consider indicate statistical significance . Gestational age , weight fetus time glucose tolerance test , presence absence medical complication pregnancy , medication substance abuse history , maternal demographic characteristic analyze subject statistical comparison .</detailed_description>
