	<brief_summary>Adverse drug reaction collect exhaustively experimental development phase drug , trial population representative . In post-marketing authorization , use real life medicine require specify profile adverse effect pharmacovigilance . However , clinical practice , under-reporting adverse drug reaction prevents satisfactory knowledge risk . For example , multiple sclerosis ( MS ) patient population 2015 , 1 case congestive flushing report physician , none patient , approximately 7,800 patient treated Tecfidera® dimethyl-fumarate , trial report 39 % flush . The investigator propose study measure impact deployment e-reporting patient population suffer multiple sclerosis initiation first line drug therapy . The study design randomize controlled trial . Twenty-four direct indirect partner center OFSEP randomize 2 arm ( 1 standard arm without intervention , one interventional arm ) , Each arm include 6 CHU , 3 CHG 3 liberal neurologist . CHUs include 10 patient 6 month , CHGs liberal neurologist 5 patient , total 180 patient include . The expected duration study 12 month , 6 month inclusion patient , one 6-month follow-up period patient . At 1 month ( +/- 15 day ) follow-up period patient , questionnaire make telephone call patient . The study part pharmacovigilance system place France aim improve efficiency increase declaration therefore early detection signal order prevent minimize risk . The comparison two arm make possible decide usefulness national support e-reporting , respect good integration French pharmacovigilance system .</brief_summary>
