	<brief_title>An Open-Label Trial Losartan Potassium Participants With Eosinophilic Esophagitis ( EoE )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The purpose research study test safety Losartan potassium see effect ( good bad ) participant Eosinophilic Esophagitis ( EoE ) . If subject Connective Tissue Disease ( CTD ) researcher want see effect ( good bad ) Losartan EoE . EoE inflammatory disease esophagus ( tube lead mouth stomach ) typically trigger exposure certain thing food . Connective Tissue Disorders ( CTDs ) disorder affect connective tissue body , fat , bone , cartilage . Eosinophils release protein call TGF-beta . Losartan may decrease amount protein therefore help EoE CTD . Losartan drug approve United States Food Drug Administration ( FDA ) use adult child 6 year age high blood pressure . This medication study people EoE .</detailed_description>
