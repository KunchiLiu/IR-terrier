	<brief_summary>The ability upregulate fat oxidation appropriate time fast , low moderate intensity exercise high fat meal , important marker health determinant optimal endurance performance . Maximal fat oxidation reportedly occur exercise intensity 45 - 65 % maximal oxygen capacity large between-subject variability apparent . Numerous factor associate maximal fat oxidation , large amount variance remain unexplained . Additionally , within-subject variability maximal fat oxidation systematically evaluate , may partially account report between-subject variability thus , measure determinant maximal fat oxidation precisely determine . The investigator want explore determinant investigate within-subject variability fat oxidation exercise wide range 'healthy ' 'at risk metabolic disease ' adult . By investigate process work explore nutrition exercise optimise improve health weight loss .</brief_summary>
