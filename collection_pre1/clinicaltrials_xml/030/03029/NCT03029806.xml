	<brief_title>Lysine-specific Demethylase 1 Salt-sensitivity Humans</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The purpose study investigate role dietary salt play epigenetic regulation blood pressure African American Caucasians , focus salt-sensitive regulatory enzyme Lysine-specific demethylase 1 . This might help u understand people develop high blood pressure . Healthy volunteer screen eligibility invite participate 2 week study . Week 1 consumption low salt diet . Week 2 high salt diet . At end week , participant admit Clinical Research Center overnight one day . On CRC , participant remain fasting supine overnight next morning undergo hormonal vascular test . This consist blood drawing , echocardiogram , vascular tonometry , assessment renal blood flow low-dose Angiotensin II infusion . The study outcome compare variant LSD1 gene affect hormonal vascular response accord race . This information help u determine race genetic profile susceptible detrimental effect salt diet others protect effect .</detailed_description>
