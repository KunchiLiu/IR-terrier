	<brief_summary>Tooth replacement significant issue World . Such replacement consider important patient improve aesthetic , function quality life . Tooth replacement therefore significant issue . Resin-bonded bridge ( RBBs ) conservative cost-effective tooth replacement option involve minimal tooth preparation secure place adhesive cement bond outer enamel layer tooth . Clinical report prostheses University Hong Kong show high success rate great longevity dental literature . However , problem type prosthesis still need tooth preparation accommodate framework thickness bridge . In patient tooth wear , may mean cut enamel crown dentine weaken tooth . In light tooth preparation patient refuse treatment , particular patient dental drill phobia . The aim study investigate RBBs tooth preparation tooth preparation replacement single miss teeth randomize controlled trial . However , significant consequence preparation RBB mean cementation prosthesis interfere patient 's bite , make bridge prosthesis stand high . This take time patient 's original occlusion re-establish movement tooth support bridge . Despite success `` supra-occluding '' restoration report study , currently neither preparation supraoccluding dental bridge standard care general dental practitioner report clinical trial literature . Most symptom report supraoccluding restoration transient reversible . The finding research significant impact teach practice clinical prosthodontics patient care worldwide . Patients dental prosthesis require dental drilling , local anaesthetic strong tooth support bridge great longevity . More patient , particular phobic patient therefore seek treatment tooth replacement conservative treatment option .</brief_summary>
