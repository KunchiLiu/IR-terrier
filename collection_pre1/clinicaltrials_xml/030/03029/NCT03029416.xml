	<brief_summary>30 Gy single fraction SBRT lung metastasis result comparable oncologic outcome 18Gy three fraction ( dose BED &lt; /-100Gy discretion radiation oncologist ) respect disease control toxicity .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Two Radiation Dose Schedules SBRT Lung Metastases &lt; 5cm Dimension</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Using two different dos SBRT , study examine 6-month local disease control rate ( LDCR ) SBRT-treated metastasis determine optimum dose SBRT pulmonary metastasis . This allow u establish baseline SBRT data , develop second trial examine sequence immunotherapy SBRT .</detailed_description>

Ability understand willingness sign write informed consent document . Patients &gt; /=3 metastatic lung lesion one lesion great 5 cm . and/or extensive metastatic disease outside chest . Patients receive investigational agent . Patients active systemic , pulmonary , pericardial infection . Pregnant lactating woman Patients know brain metastasis exclude clinical trial poor prognosis often develop progressive neurologic dysfunction would confound evaluation neurologic adverse event . Uncontrolled intercurrent illness include , limited , ongoing active infection , symptomatic congestive heart failure , unstable angina pectoris , cardiac arrhythmia , psychiatric illness/social situation would limit compliance study requirement .
