	<brief_summary>The study evaluate utility hypoxic exercise training improve cardiovascular metabolic health among obese breast cancer survivor . While participant exercise , low fraction inspire oxygen use simulate high altitude . This approach remove mechanical strain need sustain moderate-to-vigorous exercise intensity believe support exercise tolerance . Participants randomize either treatment ( walking+simulated-altitude ) control ( walk normoxic condition ) .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Simulated-altitude Optimize Aerobic Exercise Among Breast Cancer Survivors With Limited Mobility</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Cancer survivor two-fold great risk one functional limitation compare without history cancer . Though exercise intervention breast cancer survivor exist , large portion woman ( 61 % ) exhibit form lower-body dysfunction severely restrict participation physical activity exercise . Both physical emotional well-being negatively affected combination increase adiposity , orthopedic problem muscle weakness , thus reinforce cycle physical inactivity . For reason , obese breast cancer survivor walk limitation face barrier greatly increase difficulty meeting prescribed exercise guideline ( ≥150 weekly minute moderate-to-vigorous intensity exercise ) . Though previous investigation demonstrate safety benefit exercise+simulated altitude improve body fat , physical endurance insulin sensitivity , result limit non-cancer participant . Given comorbidities common breast cancer survivor , specifically , heart disease risk , low body joint problem , low aerobic capacity , fatigue , research need .</detailed_description>
