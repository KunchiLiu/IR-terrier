	<brief_summary>This study evaluate invasive deep brain stimulation ( DBS ) treatment chronic neuropathic pain . Half participant assign group record / stimulation one pain-related circuit brain half participant assign record / stimulation different pain-related circuit brain . Relief pain symptom stimulation study group . It hypothesize neural signal correlate pain state DBS disrupt pain state group .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Deep Brain Stimulation ( DBS ) Chronic Neuropathic Pain</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The purpose study test efficacy DBS small cohort patient chronic pain refractory conventional treatment . The study involve implantation neurostimulator , Medtronic Activa PC+S device , examine efficacy two mode DBS . Open-loop DBS provide stimulation base pre-set schedule , whereas closed-loop DBS deliver stimulation base brain activity associate pain state . The goal study identify neurophysiological correlate elevate pain state find DBS parameter disrupt pain-related brain activity provide pain relief little side effect . The efficacy site-specific stimulation also study .</detailed_description>
