	<detailed_description>INTRODUCTION Calcific aortic stenosis ( AS ) common valve disease West prevalence 2.8 % patient 75 year . Once symptomatic severe AS , outcome poor , unless valve replace surgically ( sAVR ) via transcatheter aortic valve replacement ( TAVR ) , predominantly use elderly patient surgery deem high risk . Systemic amyloidosis multisystem disease characterise extracellular deposition abnormally fold protein , time result progressive organ dysfunction . These protein deposit bind Congo red stain , produce pathognomonic apple-green birefringence polarise light . Cardiac involvement lead cause morbidity mortality patient . Amyloidosis due transthyretin deposition ( ATTR ) due wild-type transthyretin amyloid deposit , also know senile systemic amyloidosis , predominantly accumulate heart . Primary light chain ( AL ) amyloidosis hereditary transthyretin amyloidosis also affect heart . Wild-type ATTR ( wtATTR ) amyloid deposition present 25 % individual age 85 autopsy . To date , academic observation , technology changing : cardiac imaging , particularly cardiovascular magnetic resonance ( CMR ) 99mTc-3,3-diphosphono-1,2-propanodicarboxylic acid ( DPD ) scintigraphy , detect disease antemortem , generate major increase national awareness . There also significant advance make treatment amyloidosis . There several drug clinical trial include novel antisense interfere RNA therapeutic reduce production TTR 80-90 % . Also horizon treatment promote clearance establish amyloid , notably include monoclonal anti-SAP ( serum amyloid P component ) antibody . Despite prevalence wtATTR amyloid deposit autopsy , clinical significance prognostic impact severe AS explored . Co-existent cardiac amyloid AS . Given prevalence wtATTR octogenarian autopsy , AS wtATTR likely co-exist - literature early evidence . In cohort 20 patient AS , undergone TAVI subsequently valve explantation autopsy ( n=17 ) surgery ( n=3 ) , cardiac amyloid find third patient think contribute death majority . Our research also support - `` RELIEF-AS '' study . In 146 patient severe AS undergoing sAVR , find cardiac amyloid deposit 6 patient . All wtATTR , calcific AS , young patient age 69 . Comprehensive imaging perform , show diagnostic image hierarchy : echocardiography non-contributory , CMR detect third case , whereas DPD scintigraphy positive four patient scan ( 2 die test ) . Biopsy ATTR deposit prognostic strong predictor adverse outcome - regardless infiltration degree image detection : post sAVR 50 % wtATTR die 1 year vs 9 % without ( p &lt; 0.001 ) . Occult amyloid also implicate need pacemaker TAVR patient . The availability TAVI extend range individual benefit intervention AS , prolong life . TAVR patient generally older likely wtATTR . One recent abstract find 16 % ( 23 % men ) prevalence cardiac amyloid patient undergo TAVR ( n=75 ) use 99mTc-pyrophosphate scintigraphy ( PYP , bone tracer available USA , possibly inferior DPD ) . WtATTR also increasingly recognize cause heart failure preserve ejection fraction ( HFpEF ) . DPD scintigraphy 120 hospitalized patient also LV wall thickness ≥12 mm EF ≥50 % , show 16 patient ( 13.3 % ) show moderate severe myocardial uptake . Why detect wtTTR amyloid severe AS ? There two separate aspect wtATTR AS . First , wtATTR patient moderate AS may mimic severe AS , ( particularly low-flow , low-gradient ) cause misdiagnosis . Second , wtATTR may disease modifier , lead severe phenotype heart failure , arrhythmia , high mortality . We think large , detectable , UK population elderly patient undergo sAVR TAVR significant occult amyloid . This could influence therapeutic option ( TAVR vs sAVR vs medical therapy ) , intervention timing medication - specific amyloid therapy , drug avoid ( e.g . digoxin diltiazem ) . How detect wtATTR ? There multiple technique could detect cardiac wtATTR . Each pros con different evidence base . Our initial study use three image modality biopsy detect presence cardiac amyloid sAVR . DPD scintigraphy superior imaging modality , high diagnostic sensitivity . There rapidly grow body evidence support DPD scintigraphy non-invasive investigation choice diagnose cardiac ATTR . A recent multi-centre study 1,000 patient show bone scintigraphy &gt; 99 % sensitivity cardiac ATTR deposit propose role diagnose condition without need invasive cardiac biopsy , previously consider gold standard . The investigator recently create new modality : equilibrium contrast compute tomography ( EqCT ) , require single extra image dataset heart take 5 minute routine TAVR work-up CT image take . Extracellular volume fraction ( ECV ) calculate EqCT discriminate 100 % cardiac amyloid involvement patient AS 53 patient . TRIAL OBJECTIVES Hypothesis : In elderly severe AS consider intervention ( TAVR , sAVR ) , wtATTR : - Common . - Conveys bad prognosis . - Can reliably detect non-invasively . Aim : To confirm prevalence , clinical impact ( procedural complication , symptom response aortic valve replacement , 1-year mortality ) potential place imaging ( DPD scintigraphy , ECV CT , CMR echocardiography ) occult amyloid severe AS . STUDY PLAN Design : prospective observational cohort 1 year follow-up . Population : patient age 75 old severe AS referred Barts Heart Centre consideration intervention ( sAVR TAVR ) . Proposed sample size : Single centre ( Barts Heart Centre ) , 250 patient . Recruitment : patient recruit General Cardiology , TAVR Cardiothoracic Surgery Outpatient Clinics . A large proportion patient discuss Valve Multidisciplinary Team Meeting , provide another source recruitment . This take place 18-month period August 2016 February 2018 . Baseline assessment : include clinical history , Quality Life Questionnaire ( EQ-5D/SF-12 ) , 6-minute-walk test , blood sample haematocrit , renal function , biomarkers ( NT-pro-BNP troponin ) , biobanking ( also AL exclusion scan positive ) , urine sample biobanking ( also AL exclusion scan positive ) , well test perform routine pre-operative work-up ( clinical electrocardiogram , blood pressure estimate global LV afterload , valvulo-arterial impedance ) . Measures exposure : prevalence cardiac amyloid assess three arm ( sAVR , TAVI medical therapy , likely patient ratio 50:150:50 ) , use five investigation modality - cohort ( echocardiography DPD scintigraphy ) ; sAVR cohort ( biopsy CMR ) ; TAVR cohort ( EqCT ) ; medical therapy cohort ( per work-up/trial prior intervention decision ) . Follow-up : 1-year follow-up clinical echocardiogram ( sAVR TAVR patient ) and/or telephone interview patient ( carry person time echocardiogram ) . This include follow Quality Life Questionnaire per baseline . If attend clinic echocardiogram 6-minute-walk test also perform . MACE mortality endpoint also identify .</detailed_description>
