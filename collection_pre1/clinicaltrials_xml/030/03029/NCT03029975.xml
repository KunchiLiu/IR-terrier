	<brief_summary>Humans lose muscle strength get older . Further , age accompany loss cognitive function . It quite clear happens ; however , know loss muscle strength increase risk physical mental health risk impair ability old people remain physically independent . Weight lift proper nutrition , particularly eat high quality protein proper time quantity , may help prevent loss person get old . To determine regular beef consumption part high protein diet aid muscle adaptive response resistance training improvement cognition , seventy healthy individual recruit lift weight 3 time week 10 week . One group ( n=36 ) consume Recommended Dietary Allowance ( RDA ) protein ( 0.8g/kg/day ) , group ( n=36 ) consume amount twice RDA ( 1.6g/kg/day ) , agreement recommendation American College Sports Medicine . Participants muscle strength test sample blood muscle collect train determine muscle adaptive response resistance exercise affect high protein intake . In addition , participant undergo cognitive assessment baseline follow-up determine influence improve muscle strength attention memory . Overall , investigator propose study use sensitive methodology determine provide protein RDA optimal time day combination weight lift program help make someone strong build large muscle someone consume RDA , well process may responsible help muscle get big stronger .</brief_summary>
