	<detailed_description>The propose study cohort-randomized control trial ACT-enhanced SS ( ACT+SS ) compare standard SS-only program . Cohorts Navy personnel ( N = 280 across 28 cohort ) refer SS program due fail risk fail body composition assessment ( BCA ) overweight/obese randomize receive 8 weekly ACT+SS intervention group 8 weekly standard SS-only intervention group . The scientific aim : 1 ) determine effectiveness ACT+SS compare standard SS-only program ; 2 ) examine psychological flexibility mechanism underlie intervention response ; 3 ) explore potential moderator intervention response . The primary outcome percent weight loss . Secondary outcome include BMI , body fat % , indices physical activity , problem eating , function quality life , emotional functioning index psychological flexibility , measure baseline , mid- post-intervention , 3- 6-month follow-up self-reported BCA status 6-month follow-up . The investigator purposefully design cohort-randomized trial intervention pragmatically implement real-life military setting , outcomes immediately relevant service member leadership . The cohort randomization essential feasibility acceptability research setting . The military-relevant generalizable finding likely impact within military . SS provide ideal comparison arm current standard practice Navy . Integrating ACT SS set overcomes many logistical , practical , chain-of-command , challenge typically impede research military . The investigator thoughtfully select primary secondary outcome theoretically link , additional assessment empirically-based allow well understanding mediator moderator intervention response Navy personnel .</detailed_description>
