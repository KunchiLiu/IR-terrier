	<brief_summary>This phase I/II trial study well pembrolizumab carboplatin work treat patient ovarian , fallopian tube , primary peritoneal cancer come back responded previous treatment . Monoclonal antibody , pembrolizumab , may interfere ability tumor cell grow spread . Drugs use chemotherapy , carboplatin , work different way stop growth tumor cell , either kill cell , stop dividing , stop spread . Giving pembrolizumab carboplatin may work well treat patient ovarian , fallopian tube , primary peritoneal cancer .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Pembrolizumab Carboplatin Treating Patients With Relapsed Refractory Ovarian , Fallopian Tube , Primary Peritoneal Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To determine clinical response rate platinum chemotherapy pembrolizumab ( MK-3475 ) platinum chemotherapy pretreated ovarian , fallopian tube , primary peritoneal . II . To examine whether retreatment platinum chemotherapy platinum resistant ovarian , fallopian tube , primary peritoneal cancer improve progression free survival concurrent administration MK-3475 . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . To assess safety tolerability concurrent administration MK-3475 platinum chemotherapy patient platinum resistant recurrent ovarian , fallopian tube , primary peritoneal cancer . II . To determine relationship PD-L1 expression response combination MK-3475 platinum . III . To assess overall survival patient treated combination MK- 3475 platinum . EXPLORATORY OBJECTIVES : I . To explore change gene expression pre post treatment tumor sample . II . To explore whether treatment MK-3475 platinum alters soluble factor sera , peripheral immune response immune cell profile . OUTLINE : Patients receive pembrolizumab intravenously ( IV ) 30 minute day 1 carboplatin IV 30 minute day 8 15 . Courses repeat every 21 day 24 month absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . After completion study treatment , patient follow 30 day , every 3 month 1 year , every 6 month 1 year , every 12 week thereafter .</detailed_description>
