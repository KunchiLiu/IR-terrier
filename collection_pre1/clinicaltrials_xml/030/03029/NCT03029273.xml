	<brief_summary>TCR-T cell therapy experience breakthrough treating tumor recent year . Phase I / II trial NY-ESO-1-specific TCR-T treatment synovial sarcoma melanoma conduct Rosenberg team National Cancer Institute show 61 % Synovial cell sarcoma 55 % melanoma therapeutic response . Another report phase I / II clinical trial multiple myeloma show 20 patient receive high affinity anti-NY-ESO-1 LAGE-1 specific TCR-T treatment , 16 ( 80 % ) average progression-free survival 19.1 month minor side effect . These achievement indicate TCR-T cell therapy target variety tumor include solid tumor without severe side effect find CAR-T trial . This study mainly focus tumor testis antigen ( Cancer-Testis Antigen ) , express normal cell . NY-ESO-1 antigen commonly express 10-50 % melanoma , lung , liver , esophageal , breast , prostate , bladder , thyroid ovarian cancer case , 60 % multiple myeloma case , 70-80 % synovial cell sarcoma . Approximately 700,000 new case lung cancer identify year China , 70 % die within one two year diagnosis due lack effective treatment . To address unmet need , TCR-T treatment target non-small cell lung cancer NY-ESO-1 antigen expression . This study investigate safety tolerability TAEST16001 ( TAEST : TCR Affinity Enhancing Specific T cell Therapy , autologous T cell transduce affinity enhance NY-ESO-1 TCR ) cell therapy subject NSCLC receive prior therapy disease disease progress relapse .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>This Phase 1 study design cell dose escalation trial evaluate safety TAEST16001 T cell therapy subject NSCLC receive prior therapy disease disease progress relapse . Anti-tumor activity exploratory objective assess . Subjects enter Screening Protocol positive HLA-A2*02:01 tumor express NY-ESO-1 . The subject evaluate DLT MTD use modify 3+3 cell dose escalation design determine cell dose range . Subjects receive cytoreductive chemotherapy cyclophosphamide 1g/day day -3 -2 follow infusion dose 5×109 TAEST16001 . Subjects stay hospital safety efficacy assessment daily T cell infusion ( Day 0 ) Day 7 , weekly week 4 8 week , 12 week , 16 week every 3 month progression disease .</detailed_description>
