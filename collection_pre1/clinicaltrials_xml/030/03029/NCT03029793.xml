	<brief_title>Biomarkers Functional Imaging Predicting Response Esophageal Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The recommend care management locally advance esophageal cancer neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy ( nCRT ) follow esophagectomy base NCCN guideline . The rate pathologic complete response ( pCR ) nCRT around 25-30 % , reflect potential cure unresectable esophageal cancer receive CRT . Since esophagectomy might substantial morbidity mortality rate , establish model predict nCRT response survival guide neoadjuvant treatment decision personalize treatment . Thus surgery might spar patient complete response nCRT , surgery could selectively reserve partial response CRT . However , report model yield unsatisfactory result due small sample size low accuracy , case adenocarcinoma model use predict survival . This study prospectively collect tissue blood sample locally advanced esophageal cancer patient , detect CRT resistance biomarkers , ass SUV value texture parameter 18F-FDG PET-CT well ADC value DWI-MRI . The investigator use advanced statistical tool establish model validate model another group patients.The investigator also establish model survival prediction . This model might possibly guide personalized treatment esophageal squamous cell carcinoma patient China .</detailed_description>
