Refractory disease define ≤ 25 % response , progress therapy within 60 day completion therapy Subjects must receive ≥ 2 prior regimen . Induction therapy stem cell transplant ( ± maintenance ) consider 1 regimen Subjects must receive prior treatment bortezomib IMiD Subjects must receive alkylating agent anthracycline alone combination myeloma treatment ( may include high dose melphalan part condition regimen prior stem cell transplant ) Males females ≥ 18 year age Life expectancy 3 month Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group ( ECOG ) Performance Status 02 Adequate hepatic function , bilirubin &lt; 2.0 time upper limit normal ( ULN ) , aspartate aminotransferase ( AST ) alanine aminotransferase ( ALT ) &lt; 3.0 time ULN Absolute neutrophil count ( ANC ) ≥ 1,000/mm3 , hemoglobin ≥ 8.0 g/dL , platelet count ≥ 50,000/mm3 Subjects receive platelet transfusion least 1 week prior obtain screen platelet count Screening ANC independent granulocyte colony stimulate factor ( GCSF ) granulocyte macrophage colony stimulate factor ( GMCSF ) support ≥ 1 week pegylated GCSF ≥ 2 week Use erythropoietic stimulating factor red blood cell ( RBC ) transfusion per institutional guideline allow ; however , recent RBC transfusion may do within 7 day prior obtain screen hemoglobin Calculated measure creatinine clearance ( CrCl ) ≥ 30 mL/min .
