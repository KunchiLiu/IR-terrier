	<brief_summary>The primary objective phase 1 trial determine dose-dependent toxicity maximum tolerate dose ( MTD ) oncolytic adenovirus-mediated cytotoxic gene therapy combination SBRT medically inoperable stage I ( T1b - T2a ) NSCLC . To accomplish objective , 9 subject enrol study . We hypothesize combined treatment demonstrate acceptable toxicity , feasible quantify adenovirus-mediated HSV-1 TK gene expression lung PET . This phase 1 trial lay foundation follow-up phase 2 trial design examine efficacy .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Nine subject ( 3 cohort , 3 subjects/cohort ) medically inoperable stage I ( T1b - T2a ) NSCLC tumor measure &gt; 2 ≤ 5 cm receive single intratumoral injection oncolytic Ad5-yCD/mutTKSR39rep-ADP adenovirus one three dose level ( 1 x 1011 vp , 3 x 1011 vp , 1 x 1012 vp ) . Depending location target lesion , adenovirus inject either transbronchially ( central tumor ) percutaneously compute tomography ( CT ) -guidance ( peripheral tumor ) . Two day later , subject administer ( orally ) 10 day course 5-fluorocytosine ( 5-FC ) valganciclovir ( vGCV ) prodrug therapy along 48 Gy ( 4 fraction 12 Gy ) SBRT . Prior follow adenovirus injection , subject administer [ 18F ] -FHBG , HSV-1 TK substrate , undergo PET image quantify HSV-1 TK gene expression . Toxicity assessment occur twice week first 2 week schedule follow-up visit 60 month . The primary endpoint toxicity . Secondary endpoint include 1 ) tumor ( radiological ) response , 2 ) local , regional , distal tumor control , 3 ) progression-free overall survival , 4 ) quality life . Exploratory endpoint include 1 ) intensity , persistence , biodistribution HSV-1 TK gene expression , 2 ) association select serum biomarkers toxicity tumor response .</detailed_description>
