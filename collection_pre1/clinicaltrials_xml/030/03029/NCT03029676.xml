	<brief_title>The Assessment POCD After TURBT Under Spinal Anesthesia</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Trans-urethral resection bladder tumor ( TURBT ) basic endoscopic procedure management bladder cancer contraindication , perform spinal anesthesia . The condition usually occur among elderly patient , every 9 10 old 55 year . At age postoperative cognitive dysfunction ( POCD ) common complication risk increase age . There study indicate use benzodiazepine perioperative period also increase number registered POCD patient undergo anesthesia . Postoperative cognitive dysfunction ( POCD ) occur operation regional general anesthesia well . The study plan evaluate risk POCD among urological patient asses whether combine benzodiazepine opioids premedication increase risk . The participant give informed consent participate study . The Beck Depression Inventory perform rule patient depression . The cognitive function test Montreal Cognitive Assessment surgery subsequently first 24 hour surgery , three week later ( patient come back receive histopathological examination ) , finally six month surgery ( control cystoscopy ) . During anesthesia , patient randomly allocate receive premedication either opioid solely benzodiazepine combine opioid . The anesthetic technique standardize . If premedication need surgery hydroxyzine administrate .</detailed_description>
