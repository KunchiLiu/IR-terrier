	<brief_summary>This phase 2 study whose purpose see whether combination pembrolizumab , DPX-Survivac vaccine low-dose cyclophosphamide anti-tumor activity patient advance epithelial ovarian , fallopian tube primary peritoneal cancer . DPX-Survivac investigational vaccine . A vaccine substance often give stimulate body 's immune system ( structure process body protects harmful substance ) help prevent certain disease . DPX-Survivac vaccine may teach immune system recognize cancer cell kill . Pembrolizumab drug approve treatment certain type melanoma ( type skin cancer ) non-small cell lung cancer . Pembrolizumab block function protein call program cell death receptor-1 ( PD-1 ) . PD-1 work keep immune system destroy cancer cell . Stopping PD-1 working may help immune system fight cancer cell . Cyclophosphamide chemotherapy drug approve treatment various cancer alone combination drug .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>This study two phase : dose escalation phase dose expansion phase . For dose escalation part , group participant receive one two dose level study drug determine best dose level test . Once best dose level find , additional participant enrol dose expansion test safety , tolerability , efficacy study drug dose level specific type cancer . All participant receive pembrolizumab , DPX-Survivac , low-dose cyclophosphamide . Participants screen eligibility standard safety test procedure within 28 day start study drug . Tests procedure do research purpose time include archival tumor tissue collection , fresh research biopsy , blood sample collection biomarker/genetic/immune research . Participants also ask agree optional fresh research biopsy disease progression Eligible participant receive follow every 21 day cycle : - Pembrolizumab , intravenously , 200 mg , Day 1 every cycle . - DPX-Survivac , injection skin upper thigh clinic . Participants receive one prim dose 0.25 mL DPX-Survivac Cycle 1 Day 1 . After 6 week , participant receive additional boosting dose 0.25 0.5 mL DPX-Survivac depending assign dose level . - Cyclophosphamide , orally , 50 mg , twice day , start 7 day Cycle 1 Day 1 , continue 7 day , 7 day . While receive study treatment , participant ask visit study site Day 1 Cycles 1-8 test procedure . Tests procedures do research purpose include additional blood sample collection second fresh research biopsy biomarker/genetic/immune research . Participants benefit study treatment may able receive additional treatment progress stop study treatment . When participant take study treatment permanently , ask return study site End Study Treatment visit 30 day stop study treatment test procedures do safety purpose . Participants take study treatment reason disease progression continue radiological assessment blood draw every 12 week first year every 24 week year 1 start new anti-cancer treatment , disease progression , study end . Participants continue follow survival review new anti-cancer therapy every 12 week .</detailed_description>
