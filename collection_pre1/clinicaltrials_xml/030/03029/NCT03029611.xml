	<brief_summary>This phase II trial study well pUMVC3-IGFBP2 plasmid deoxyribonucleic acid ( DNA ) vaccine ( IGFBP-2 vaccine ) combination chemotherapy work treat patient stage III-IV ovarian , fallopian tube , primary peritoneal cancer undergo surgery . IGFBP-2 protein find blood tumor cell diagnosed ovarian cancer . Too much IGFBP-2 associate invasive disease . Vaccines make DNA may help body build effective immune response kill tumor cell express IGFBP-2 . Drugs use chemotherapy , paclitaxel carboplatin , work different way stop growth tumor cell , either kill cell , stop dividing , stop spread . Giving IGFBP-2 vaccine combination chemotherapy may work well treat patient stage III-IV ovarian , fallopian tube , primary peritoneal cancer undergo surgery .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . Determine whether addition IGFBP-2 vaccine neoadjuvant chemotherapy increase rate complete response ( CR ) induction . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . Determine whether addition IGFBP-2 vaccine neoadjuvant chemotherapy increase progression free survival 12 month . II . Determine whether addition IGFBP-2 vaccine neoadjuvant chemotherapy improve overall survival . III . To determine whether IGFBP-2 vaccination combination chemotherapy increase level tumor infiltrating lymphocyte ( TIL ) tumor . IV . To assess level IGFBP-2 type 1 helper cell ( Th1 ) elicit vaccination concurrent chemotherapy . EXPLORATORY OBJECTIVES : I . To explore whether predictive genomic signature CR induction IGFBP-2 vaccination use combination chemotherapy . OUTLINE : Patients receive paclitaxel intravenously ( IV ) 3 hour carboplatin IV 1 hour follow IGFBP-2 vaccine intradermally ( ID ) 2 week later . Treatment repeat every 3 week 3 course absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . After completion 3 course , patient undergo cytoreductive surgery . After completion study treatment , patient follow 6 month year 5 year .</detailed_description>
