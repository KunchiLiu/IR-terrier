	<brief_title>Vedolizumab Intravenous ( IV ) Dose Optimization Ulcerative Colitis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The drug test study call Vedolizumab . Vedolizumab administer IV infusion . It test study new dos . This study investigate efficacy safety dose optimization vedolizumab IV , compare standard dose vedolizumab IV , 30-week treatment period . The study enroll approximately 200 moderately severely active patient ulcerative colitis order randomize 100 nonresponder patient . Participants receive induction therapy vedolizumab IV 300 mg Day 1 Week 2 ( Lead-in Period ) . At Week 5 , serum vedolizumab concentration measure . At Week 6 , participant assess clinical response base partial Mayo score . Results Week 5 vedolizumab concentration Week 6 clinical response determine treatment pathway . Those non-responders base partial Mayo score Week 6 assess high vedolizumab clearance , base predefined Week 5 serum vedolizumab concentration threshold ( &lt; 50 µg/mL ) randomly assign ( chance , like flip coin ) one two treatment group : - Vedolizumab IV Standard Treatment - Vedolizumab IV Dose Optimized All randomize participant receive vedolizumab IV either 300 mg 600 mg every 4 8 week . This multi-center trial conduct United States America Canada . The overall time participate study 56 week . Participants make multiple visit clinic , contact telephone , 6 month last dose study drug long term follow-up safety survey .</detailed_description>
