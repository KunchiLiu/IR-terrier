	<brief_summary>Rehabilitation approach introduce stimulus motor system , goal enhance motor function patient . For example , exposure brief intermittent episode mild hypoxia show strengthen synaptic pathway respiratory skeletal muscle motor neuron . In human spinal cord injury , exposure intermittent hypoxia ( IH ) alone combination rehabilitative strategy show enhanced motor function . Another strategy know inspiratory threshold loading , involve breathe pressure threshold load , result improve inspiratory muscle strength . Although evidence support use IH alone combination rehabilitative strategy improve motor function human , impact exposure IH IH inspiratory threshold load inspiratory muscle function ventilation human unknown .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Investigators test whether exposure IH alone combination inspiratory threshold loading ( ITL ) result increase inspiratory muscle strength ventilation . Investigators use Latin square , repeat measure design consist 12 subject participate four experimental conditions.There interval 1 week four condition , serve washout period . At end 5 session , subject rest recline chair 15 minute heart rate , blood pressure , oxygen saturation breathing monitor . Subjects blood systolic blood pressure &gt; 140 diastolic pressure &gt; 90 SPO2 &lt; 92 % ask remain laboratory 15 additional minute vital sign repeat . If blood pressure and/or peripheral capillary oxygen saturation ( SPO2 ) remain outside criterion mention , subject instruct seek assessment health provider incident report Institutional Review Board . Subjects also ask report discomfort .</detailed_description>
