	<brief_summary>Background : The bronchodilator therapy essential component management asthma exacerbation . The delivery bronchodilator lung asthma exacerbation usually achieve nebulization ( create small particle inhale ) . The commonly use nebulizer device small volume jet nebulizer consistently reliable deliver bronchodilator therapy . The Aeroneb nebulizer device FDA approve device produce consistently respirable sized particle could potentially result good bronchodilator effect standard jet nebulizer . Aim : To study whether Aeroneb nebulizer effective small volume jet nebulizer deliver bronchodilator severe asthma exacerbation . Experimental design : Patients randomize ( like flip coin ) receive bronchodilator therapy per emergency room protocol either via small volume jet nebulizer Aeroneb nebulizer . Subjects : Adult patient age 18 55 year present emergency room severe asthma exacerbation peak expiratory flow rate &lt; 50 % predict . Study procedure : When enrol study randomization , collect data standard hospital like heart rate , blood pressure breathe index also non-routine thing like score scale shortness breath serial measurement peak expiratory flow rate . We anticipate Aeroneb device effective delivering bronchodilator medication thus effective manage asthma exacerbation .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>- Patients present acute severe asthma exacerbation emergency room screen PI , co-investigator research coordinator determine eligibility base inclusion exclusion criterion . - Clinically indicated treatment must delay research-related reason patient still eligible enrollment receive initial bronchodilator therapy long PEFR remain &lt; 50 % predict enrollment occurs within 90 minute ER arrival time . - The initial part consent process cover essential element inform consent concise manner ensure timely process - Eligible patient randomize use conceal envelope method either intervention arm control arm . The randomization take place within 90 minute ER arrival , however , every effort make enroll patient soon possible ; patient enrol long PEFR le 40 % predict regardless number bronchodilator treatment receive prior randomization . - The assignment blind record investigator treat physician patient nurse respiratory therapist administer nebulization . In order avoid delay administer treatment , set Aeroneb nebulizer small volume jet nebulizer store identical box readily available ER . In order blind treat physician recording investigator , sign `` treatment progress '' display outdoor ER room patient get bronchodilator treatment . The nebulizer device place box bronchodilator treatment session . The physician recording investigator ask possible see patient sign take outdoor . - Once assign , bronchodilator treatment ER administer use nebulizer device assign patient . - The Peak flow FEV1 measure use Spirometer ( micro I ) . Both value obtain exhalation maneuver . - Patient treat manage accord asthma ER adult protocol direct ER physician charge patient 's care - After study procedure perform subject determine stable condition capacity make medical decision , investigator approach subject review element ICF subject . The collected data use subject sign part inform consent . - Within two week subject participation , research team conduct phone interview subject obtain feedback study procedure mainly inform consent process . The phone interview questionnaire include supplement</detailed_description>
