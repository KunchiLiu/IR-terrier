	<brief_summary>BioFire Diagnostics , LLC ( BioFire ; bioMerieux company ) , develop multiplexed molecular-based vitro diagnostic platform infectious disease test know FilmArray . The FilmArray Respiratory Panel ( RP ) EZ test design use FilmArray 2.0 EZ Configuration instrument identifies common bacterial viral microorganism associate respiratory tract infection nasopharyngeal swab ( NPS ) specimen collect viral transport medium ( VTM ) . The RP EZ grant CLIA-waived classification FDA October 2016 first highly-multiplexed molecular test receive designation . The purpose study measure patient outcomes follow implementation RP EZ test also gather data physician office workflow user interaction device . These data use understand adoption test may influence patient care CLIA-waived setting .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Implementation Assessment Clinical Utility FilmArrayÂ® Respiratory Panel ( RP ) EZ CLIA-waived Setting</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The FilmArray RP EZ may offer improvement conventional CLIA-waived test respiratory infection . Molecular-based test provide increased sensitivity specificity relative current clinical reference method multiplexed panel offer great breadth organism identification diagnostic yield available use standard method available CLIA-waived setting . Because attribute , result test potential enable clinician accurately diagnose treat respiratory illness . It hypothesize sensitive , specific , comprehensive result provide FilmArray RP EZ allow clinician rapidly diagnose respiratory illness implement appropriate therapy , well provide subject appropriate expectation course illness . This interventional clinical trial initiate 2016-2017 respiratory illness season measure utility FilmArray RP EZ implement outpatient care set . At least three different outpatient urgent care clinic within UCLA Health system select participation . Subjects randomize two group within site . The control group receive standard care accord subject 's provider 's determination . The intervention group receive test FilmArray RP EZ . Outcome measure include ( limited ) total healthcare cost , antimicrobial prescription rate , timeliness , appropriateness therapy , clinician attitude towards laboratory test capability , subject satisfaction healthcare encounter . As specimen collect specifically research study , write informed consent , assent , and/or parental permission obtain study participant .</detailed_description>
