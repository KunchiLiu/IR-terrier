	<detailed_description>Hereditary angioedema rare inherit disorder characterize recurrent episode accumulation fluid outside blood vessel , block normal flow blood lymphatic fluid cause rapid swell tissue hand , foot , limb , face , intestinal tract , airway . Usually , swell accompany itching , might allergic reaction . Swelling gastrointestinal tract lead cramp . Swelling airway may lead obstruction , potentially serious complication . These symptom develop result deficiency improper function certain protein help maintain normal flow fluid small blood vessel ( capillary ) . In case , fluid may accumulate internal organ . The severity disease varies greatly among affected individual . The common form disorder hereditary angioedema type I , result abnormally low level certain complex protein blood ( C1 esterase inhibitor ) , know complement . They help regulate various body function . The characteristic symptom hereditary angioedema recurrent episodes swell affected area due accumulation excessive body fluid . The area body commonly affect include hand , foot , eyelid , lip , and/or genitals . Edema may also occur mucous membrane line respiratory digestive tract , common people hereditary angioedema form angioedema ( i.e. , acquire traumatic ) . People disorder typically area swell hard painful , red itchy ( pruritic ) . A skin rash ( urticaria ) rarely present . The symptom hereditary angioedema may recur become severe . Injury , severe pain , surgery , dental procedure , viral illness , and/or stress trigger worsen recur symptom . Symptoms associate swell digestive system ( gastrointestinal tract ) include nausea , vomit , acute abdominal pain , and/or sign obstruction . Edema throat ( pharynx ) voice-box ( larynx ) result pain , difficulty swallowing ( dysphagia ) , difficulty speaking ( dysphonia ) , noisy respiration ( stridor ) , potentially life-threatening asphyxiation . Hereditary angioedema inherit autosomal dominant trait . Genetic disease determine two gene , one receive father one mother . Dominant genetic disorder occur single copy abnormal gene necessary appearance disease . The abnormal gene inherit either parent , result spontaneous new mutation ( gene change ) affect individual . The symptom hereditary angioedema type I develop due deficiency protein know complement component C1 esterase inhibitor .</detailed_description>
