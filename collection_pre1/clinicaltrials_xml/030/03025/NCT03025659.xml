	<brief_summary>This single-center , observational study . Investigators aim characterize metabolism lactate child first forty-eight hour follow cardiac surgery . Blood sample obtain 12 timepoints . Samples analyze concentration pyruvate . Results compare standard care laboratory result lactate direct indirect measure cardiac output .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Lactate Acidosis Postoperative Hearts</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Investigators characterize etiology hyperlactatemia predominantly present serial postoperative timepoints child recover cardiac surgery follow lactate level lactate-to-pyruvate ratio first 48 post-operative hour correlate cardiac output determine conventional marker physical exam . Investigators expect validate assumption child recover heart surgery whose cardiac output apparently normal , hyperlactatemia ( see ) predominantly due impaired lactate clearance metabolism , whose cardiac output low , predominantly due inadequate oxygen delivery . Blood sample obtain 12 timepoints ( arrival intensive care unit postoperatively , hour 1 , hour 2 , hour 3 , hour 4 , hour 6 , hour 8 , hour 10 , hour 12 , hour 24 , hour 36 hour 48 postoperative ) . Samples analyze concentration pyruvate . Results compare standard care laboratory result lactate direct indirect measure cardiac output .</detailed_description>
