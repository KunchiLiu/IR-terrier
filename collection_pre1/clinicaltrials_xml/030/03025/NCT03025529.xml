	<brief_title>Transcranial Stimulation Essential Tremor</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Essential tremor ( ET ) movement disorder characterize tremor hand , often head voice , affect approximately 4.8-6.7 million individual age 40 United States alone . Hand tremor limit basic activity daily live like feeding , drinking , write dress . While medication effective tremor , often poorly tolerate due sedative neuronal activity depressant property . Surgical option deep brain stimulation ventral intermedius thalamus ( Vim DBS ) highly effective invasive nature limit popularity . Noninvasive brain stimulation demonstrate ability reduce tremor precisely target brain stimulation achieve best result currently unknown . Repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation ( rTMS ) enable noninvasive , selective sustain modulation specific neural network , lead clinical benefit debilitate neurologic psychiatric disorder , include medication-resistant depression , paresis follow stroke traumatic brain injury , Parkinson 's disease , dementia . There also recent evidence rTMS cerebellum relieve hand tremor due essential tremor . TMS use electromagnetic induction generate control current target brain structure identify define use MRI-based neuronavigation . TMS safe appropriate guideline adhere . To date , impact rTMS ET sufficiently establish , pilot study offer promising result . The investigator test whether MRI-guided neuronavigated cerebellar pair pulse TMS demonstrate abnormal physiologic measure ET subject compare control whether reduction tremor via cerebellar rTMS patient ET . The investigator plan collect imaging , functional neurophysiological assessment rTMS identify mechanistic underpinnings rTMS-induced change tremor cerebello-cortical inhibition .</detailed_description>
