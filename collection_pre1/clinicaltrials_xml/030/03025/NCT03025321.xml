	<brief_summary>Repetitive bilateral ( left cathodal/ right anodal ) transcranial Direct Current Stimulation ( tDCS ) dorsolateral prefrontal cortex ( DLPFC ) seem reduce crave relapse risk . However , little known relapse rate cocaine addiction tDCS , despite need new treatment intervention reduce high relapse rate cocaine addiction . The investigator aim explore effect repetitive tDCS large sample ( N=80 ) cocaine addict patient number relapse day three month . In addition , underlie work mechanism explore ( e.g . cognitive control function ) . Ecological momentary assessment ( EMA ) use measure relapse , crave mood since retrospective self-reports seem less reliable respect .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Effects Repetitive tDCS Relapse Cocaine Addiction : EMA Study</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>For study , 80 cocaine addict patient receive real sham bilateral tDCS ( left cathodal/right anodal ) DLPFC one week detox . The participant receive two time daily 5 consecutive day . It expect particular tDCS method reduce relapse probability , previously see alcohol addict patient . Furthermore , hypothesize therapeutic effect associate diminish crave enhanced cognitive control . Craving , temptation relapse , explore mean Ecological Momentary Assessment ( EMA ) . The mixed result previous study tDCS crave may explain fact crave addiction momentary phenomenon difficult reliably measure traditional method like retrospective self-reports , EMA provide solution . Cognitive control measure mean inhibitory control Go/NoGo task reward process gamble task . The task perform baseline , one day tDCS session three month follow .</detailed_description>
