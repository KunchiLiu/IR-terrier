	<brief_summary>This trial evaluate use immunotherapy population incurable advanced breast cancer associate germline BRCA mutation . The main objective examine overall response rate pembrolizumab ( immunotherapy ) single agent therapy advance BRCA-mutated breast cancer .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Pembrolizumab Advanced BRCA-mutated Breast Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>There two BRCA gene , BRCA1 BRCA2 , play role protect cell cancer . If one gene mutate , cell may rapidly change divide , lead cancer . Pembrolizumab drug work immune system target tumor ( immunotherapy ) . The investigator want know pembrolizumab able reduce size amount cancer cell few side effect standard treatment target tumor.This research study design test investigational use pembrolizumab breast cancer .</detailed_description>

Patients nonmeasurable bone metastases addition measurable disease eligible ; however patient nonmeasurable bone disease site ( ) disease eligible . ECOG 0 , 1 , 2 Documented BRCA deleterious germline mutation . ( While somatic mutation BRCA 1 2 occur , standardized test biomarker , subject limit germline carrier ) . FFPE tumor tissue available analysis Adequate organ function Female subject childbearing potential negative urine serum pregnancy prior study registration retested within 72 hour prior receive first dose study medication . If urine test positive confirm negative , serum pregnancy test require . Female subject childbearing potential willing use 2 method birth control surgically sterile , abstain heterosexual activity course study 120 day last dose study medication . Subjects childbearing potential surgically sterilize free menses &gt; 1 year . Male subject agree use adequate method contraception start first dose study therapy 120 day last dose study therapy . Is currently participate participate study investigational agent use investigational device 30 day first dose trial treatment . 1 . Has prior chemotherapy , target small molecule therapy , radiation therapy within 3 week prior study Day 1 recover ( i.e. , ≤ Grade 1 baseline ) adverse event due previously administer agent . 2 . Subjects ≤ Grade 2 neuropathy exception criterion may qualify study . 3 . If subject receive major surgery , must recover adequately toxicity and/or complication intervention prior start therapy . Is receive systemic steroid therapy within three day prior first dose initial treatment receive form immunosuppressive medication Is expect require form systemic localize antineoplastic therapy trial . Has receive prior therapy antiPD1 , antiPDL1 , antiPDL2 , antiCD137 , antiCytotoxic Tlymphocyteassociated antigen4 ( CTLA4 ) antibody ( include ipilimumab antibody drug specifically target Tcell costimulation checkpoint pathway ) . Has participate another MK03475 trial . Has know hypersensitivity pembrolizumab excipients Has know additional malignancy progress require active treatment . Exceptions include basal cell carcinoma skin , squamous cell carcinoma skin , situ cervical cancer undergone potentially curative therapy . Has know history prior malignancy except patient undergone potentially curative therapy evidence disease recurrence 5 year since initiation therapy . Has know active central nervous system ( CNS ) metastases and/or carcinomatous meningitis . Subjects previously treat brain metastasis may participate provide stable ( without evidence progression MRI least four week prior first dose trial treatment neurologic symptom return baseline ) , evidence new enlarge brain metastasis , use steroid least three day prior study medication . Has evidence interstitial lung disease active , noninfectious pneumonitis Has active tuberculosis Has receive live vaccine within 30 day prior first dose trial treatment . Has know history Human Immunodeficiency Virus ( HIV ) ( HIV 1/2 antibody ) . Has know active Hepatitis B ( e.g. , HBsAg reactive ) Hepatitis C ( e.g. , HCV RNA [ qualitative ] detect ) . Has active autoimmune disease require systemic treatment past 2 year ( i.e . use disease modify agent , corticosteroid immunosuppressive drug ) . Subjects vitiligo resolve childhood asthma/atopy would exception rule . Subjects require inhale steroid local steroid injection exclude study . Subjects hypothyroidism autoimmune disease stable hormone replacement exclude study . Note : Replacement therapy ( eg. , thyroxine , insulin , physiologic corticosteroid replacement therapy adrenal pituitary insufficiency , etc . ) consider form systemic treatment .
