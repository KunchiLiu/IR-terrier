	<brief_title>The Use Capnography Integrated Pulmonary Index Electrophysiology Laboratory</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>In electrophysiology lab , use procedural sedation , often nurse consider routine safe.Standard monitoring procedure include continuous Oxygen Saturation ( SpO2 ) , Heart Rate rhythm interval Respiratory rate blood pressure . Capnography allow continuous monitoring exhale carbon dioxide , important tool anesthesia , provide valuable information patient 's respiratory status standard equipment operating room . Its use procedural sedation increase past year body evidence support practice grow . It previously show , use capnography may allow early detection respiratory adverse event various type procedural sedation . The fall oxygen saturation occur late adverse respiratory event , especially supplemental oxygen give . Today 's procedural sedation electrophysiology catheterization lab complex , patient increasingly old age , comorbidities , procedure lengthier often require deep sedation ( i.e . complex ablation procedure ) . The use capnography electrophysiology lab address thoroughly literature . A recent multidisciplinary review anesthesia electrophysiology lab state : `` In obstructive sleep apnea non-obstructive sleep apnea patient , capnography ideally employ throughout sedation period . `` â€¦ '' Capnography appear underutilized electrophysiology lab , give omission electrophysiology literature document safety sedation non-anesthesiologists '' We hypothesize routine use capnography nurse administer procedural sedation electrophysiology lab could aid detection early sign adverse respiratory event , thus allow early intervention reduction event .</detailed_description>
