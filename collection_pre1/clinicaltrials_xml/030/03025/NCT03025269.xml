	<detailed_description>Grey matter ( GM ) atrophy develop early multiple sclerosis ( MS ) disease process . Over 2 year , clinically isolated syndrome ( CIS ) patient develop significant thalamic cortical volume loss . In preliminary study , include 50 MS patient , investigator find presence leptomeningeal ( LM ) contrast enhancement ( CE ) associate progression cortical atrophy 5 year , measure loss cortical volume , patient MS. About 40 % relapsing-remitting MS ( RRMS ) patient present LM CE . MS patient LM CE show significantly great percentage decrease cortical ( -3.4 % vs. -1.8 % , p=0.007 ) volume , compare without . RRMS patient LM CE show significantly great percentage decrease cortical ( -3.8 % vs. -1.9 % , p=0.006 ) volume follow-up , compare without . No difference deep GM volume change find relapsing-remitting ( RR ) secondary progressive ( SP ) MS patient without LM CE . Three LM CE positive one LM CE negative RRMS patient develop secondary progressive MS ( SPMS ) course follow-up . More MS subject LM CE disability progression ( 7 , 28 % ) compare without ( 4 , 16 % ) , significantly different ( p=0.306 ) . The median EDSS MS patient LM CE increase 4.0 , decrease 2.5 without . No difference total number relapse , annual relapse rate , relapse free detect MS patient without LM CE follow-up . However , RRMS patient LM CE , investigator find trend great increase absolute change EDSS ( 0.9 vs. -0.03 , p=0.05 ) . The propose study extend preliminary finding cohort MS patient , treat Ocrelizumab assess 12 24 month use MRI hardware software . The longitudinal serial MRI assessment study design allow u examine temporal relationship LM CE , development GM pathology , cognitive dysfunction Ocrelizumab . Based preliminary result , investigator expect approximately 12 ( 40 % ) MS patient present LM CE baseline propose study . Substantial evidence show Epstein-Barr virus ( EBV ) infection play major role risk develop MS. Mononucleosis seropositivity anti-Epstein-Barr nuclear antigen ( EBNA ) Immunoglobulin G ( IgG ) along Vit D deficiency smoking risk factor MS . Serial study reveal risk develop MS extremely low among individual infect EBV increase sharply individual follow EBV infection . EBV-infected B cell identify MS brain lesion . Therefore elimination virus persistently infect B-cells could potentially inhibit/delay disease progression . Our data show correlation anti-EBV level atrophy ( degeneration ) hence effect disease chronicity/progression . Besides high Vit D administration study show effect decrease EBV antibody level , DMT 's able show beneficial effect EBV antibody level , treatment increase EBV level . EBV viremia occur hematopoietic stem transplantation set treat successfully rituximab , antibody target B-lymphocyte antigen ( CD20 ) B cell manner analogous Ocrelizumab . It report 92 % patient EBV viremia respond upon dose rituximab EBV copy per 100,000 peripheral blood mononuclear cell ( PBMC ) decrease 2578 71 Day 15 0 Day 21 . Therefore , hypothesis Ocrelizumab treatment reduce B cell EBV exposure treat patient lead benefit LM inflammation less GM atrophy development .</detailed_description>
