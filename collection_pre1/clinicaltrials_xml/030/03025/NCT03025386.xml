	<brief_summary>A cochlear implant device rehabilitation severe profound hearing loss . Despite standardization surgical procedure rehabilitation , speech discrimination performance vary significantly cochlear implant user could improve early individualized care . However , objective method yet evaluate phoneme discrimination , especially infant , account half indication implantation . In electroencephalography ( EEG ) , possible highlight discrimination auditory stimulus study wave MisMatch Negativity ( MMN ) . In work , study propose use MMN objective vocal audiometry method evaluate ability discriminate phoneme , small unit oral language , adult cochlear implant user .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Context study Cochlear implant effective recognize long-term solution people severe profound neurosensory hearing loss . Its principle collect sound environment , analyze , transform , use electrode array place cochlea , transmit back auditory nerve electrical impulse . With practice , integrate recognize brain associate mean . For normal hearing person , speech recognition involve several time frequency cue ear able decode . However , cochlear implant distorts alters speech cue ; implant easily retransmit temporal feature frequency one much deteriorate . Thus , cochlear implant user preferentially use temporal cue , provide truncate incomplete information , often result low quality understanding . Thus , learn re-learning language cochlear implant difficult young deaf child deaf adult . The cochlear implant set essentially base perceptual feature . A detection threshold comfort level fit accord perception patient several objective tool . These provide important information validity set ensure optimal speech understanding . The High Authority Health suggest speech therapy overall rehabilitation cochlear implant user . This aim develop auditory skill accord four major perceptual ax : detection , identification , discrimination understand sound . Despite care , cochlear implant user speech recognition score low normal-hearing people heterogeneous performance . Deafness etiology ( auditory neuropathy , demyelization , ... ) , integrity auditory nerve , position electrode array cochlea , cognitive ability , age implantation , duration hearing loss , quality cortical integration , cerebral plasticity , speech therapy , family environment , implant fitting could affect subject performance . Difficulties speech understand may relate poor discrimination phoneme , small unit oral language . These phonemic confusion test adult several test Phonetically Balanced Kindergarten test ( PBK ) . However , young child , child polyhandicap disabled adult , evaluation language delicate need long term . Several electrophysiological technique would nevertheless make possible objectively demonstrate ability discriminate phonemes one measure . For example , mismatch negativity wave ( MMN ) reflect cognitive process show discrimination two different sound auditory system . It measurable adult child , automatically regardless level vigilance . In study use MMN protocol highlight phonemic discrimination capacity link subjective performance adult cochlear implant user . The first objective establish user concordance amplitude MMN test discrimination logatoms , highlight capacity auditory discrimination . The second establish concordance amplitude MMN score obtain PBK . Method A forced choice test evaluate discrimination confuse logatoms cochlear implant user , representative French language . The following couple select : - `` pa `` vs `` ba `` - `` sa `` vs `` za `` - `` fa `` v `` va `` - `` pa `` vs `` pan `` - `` p√© `` vs `` pin `` Each couple logatoms test twenty time . If score great 16/20 , discrimination logatoms pair consider positive . The test , carry use Matlab MathWorks software , automate patient could without intervention experimenter ; It remain supervision order verify test proceed normally . Obtaining MMN require paradigm call `` oddball '' , `` frequent '' stimulus emit 80 % time second stimulus call `` deviant '' present 20 % time . The high repetition rate frequent stimulus ( `` pa '' example ) create electrophysiological baseline . When deviant stimulus ( `` ba '' example ) appear , introduces break electrophysiological baseline result appearance so-called mismatch negative wave , MMN . It show discrimination auditory system two different stimulus . By study amplitude wave , possible evaluate quality discrimination . A low zero amplitude mean subject discriminate two logatoms . Conversely , high amplitude , great discrimination quality . The wave latency also variable observe . The early , mark ease discrimination . For subject , concordance score logatoms discrimination test analyze separately pair . This make possible evaluate consistency concordance accord pair test logatoms . The optimal threshold MMN amplitude identify subject good auditory discrimination yet know ( innovative method ) . The first stage analysis search threshold construct receiver operate characteristic ( ROC ) curve best distinguish patient good bad auditory discrimination test logatoms ( choice threshold index Youden ) . This threshold use classify subject good poor auditory discrimination accord EEG . The agreement result EEG test logatoms discrimination analyze calculation Kappa coefficient . The PBK test use evaluate overall comprehension score . This test consist 4 list 50 word respect occurrence phoneme French language use mono- bi-syllabic word . A score 70 % accept good performance . The concordance result EEG procedure logatoms ( good bad auditory discrimination define ) result PBK test analyze use Kappa coefficient . Finally , different secondary data collect : type cochlear implant ( mark , internal external part ) , duration implantation month , etiology , data relate implant setting ( number active electrode , Thresholds C T , IDR , automatic function like SCAN , ADRO , ... )</detailed_description>
