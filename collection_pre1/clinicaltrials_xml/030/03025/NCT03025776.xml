	<brief_summary>To develop intervention , investigator need good understand task requirement ( i.e . size weight object , location workspace , etc . ) drive person stroke use 2 hand ( opposed 1 ) , severity injury impact relationship . A good understanding relationship promote inform development rehabilitative intervention . This study propose explore people stroke : . ) specific functional task requirement relate 1 vs. 2 hand use , ii . ) stroke severity impact arm use . We propose study 15 individual 6 month stroke CSU Motor Behavior Lab two x 3 hour session task-related reaching sit . The investigator systematically vary task requirement ( i.e . object size weight , location workspace , etc . ) , record use 1 versus 2 hand use videotape well record quality arm movement ( kinematics ) muscle activity ( EMG ) arm .</brief_summary>
