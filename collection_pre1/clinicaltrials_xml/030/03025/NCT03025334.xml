	<brief_summary>Parkinson 's disease ( PD ) classically regard `` movement disorder '' , earlier work focus treat motor symptom . As PD patient longer life expectancy , relatively slowly progress cognitive deficit ( compare motor deficit ) become one major challenge . Approximately 80 % PD patient eventually become demented . Therefore cognitive dysfunction one significant factor affect quality life patient PD . While dementia Parkinson 's disease routinely treat cholinesterase inhibitor ( e.g. , donepezil rivastigmine ) , efficacy mild cognitive impairment find non-demented PD questionable . Alternative approach propose include transcranial direct current stimulation ( tDCS ) consensus reach . This attribute mainly : ( 1 ) imprecise knowledge underlie functional circuitry mediate disease manifestation ( 2 ) inter-individual variability . Here , investigator utilize novel personalize network analysis approach elucidate underlying mechanism effect tDCS cognitive dysfunction non-demented PD patient . It well document caudate nucleus play important role cognitive dysfunction find PD . In investigator ' preliminary resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging ( fMRI ) study , show connectivity leave caudate nucleus correlate cognitive status PD patient measure Montreal Cognitive Assessment ( MoCA ) . The investigator hypothesize tDCS leave dorsolateral prefrontal cortex may restore functional connectivity leave caudate nucleus may turn improve patient ' cognitive performance .</brief_summary>
