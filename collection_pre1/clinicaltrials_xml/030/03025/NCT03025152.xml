	<brief_title>Efficacy Safety Hou Gu Mi Xi Patients With Spleen Qi Deficiency Radical Gastrectomy Gastric Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The incidence gastric cancer rank high many country around world . Although along development economy medical condition incidence gastric cancer appear trend decrease develop country , still one common cancer Asia . There new gastric cancer case China compare country every year . According epidemiological survey World Health Organization , 5-year prevalence gastric cancer 53.7/10,000 China - low Japan . For early gastric cancer , radical gastrectomy , important treatment , could significantly prolong disease-free survival overall survival . However , severe damage surgery follow radiation chemotherapy intestinal tract usually lead patient constitution spleen qi deficiency , concept traditional Chinese medicine ( TCM ) mainly involve digestive symptom , poor appetite , abnormal stool ( loose , diarrhea ) abdominal distention . Therefore , resolve protect function intestinal tract , change constitution spleen qi deficiency postoperatively important improve quality life reduce recurrence rate cancer . Shen Ling Bai Zhu San , classic Chinese medicinal formula originally describe Tai Ping Hui Min He Ji Ju Fang Song Dynasty ( 1102 AD ) , compose ginseng , tuckahoe , atractylodes , baked licorice , coixenolide , Chinese yam , lotus seed , shrinkage fructus amomi , platycodon grandiflorum , white hyacinth bean , dry orange peel . It effect replenish qi invigorate spleen ( spleen TCM conception differs western medicine ) , well penetrate wet antidiarrheal . It mainly use treat syndrome spleen qi deficiency , include dyspepsia , chest stomach distress , borborygmus diarrhea , limb weakness , thin body , sallow complexion , pale tongue white greasy coating , weak slow pulse , etc . In theory TCM , spleen source produce qi blood thus root life . Shen Ling Bai Zhu San could invigorate spleen supply spleen remove wet , finally nourish stomach intestine . Previous pharmacologic study also reveal Shen Ling Bai Zhu San could adjust function anaerobic aerobic bacteria gastrointestinal tract ; specifically , could improve proliferation probiotic ( bifidobacterium ) inhibit main resistance strain ( enterococcus ) thus effect improve gastrointestinal symptom . According experience TCM , constitution patient undergo radiation chemotherapy usually yin deficiency , change spleen qi deficiency due digestive disorder treatment . Therefore , Shen Ling Bai Zhu San expect improve symptom patient underwent gastrectomy follow radiation chemotherapy . Hou Gu Mi Xi dietary therapy form Shen Ling Bai Zhu San , remove atractylodes platycodon grandiflorum ( two herb could use food ) Shen Ling Bai Zhu San , add perilla leaf adapt dietary therapy long-term use . Hou Gu Mi Xi use main formula Shen Ling Bai Zhu San , could theoretically maintain treatment effect . Although reliable health effect Shen Ling Bai Zhu San prove previous study , Hou Gu Mi Xi optimize formula preparation change electuary rice paste , functional mechanism efficacy may different . Therefore , investigator plan perform hospital-based randomize controlled trial , enroll patient three hospital Nanchang City Jiangxi Province China , assess efficacy safety Hou Gu Mi Xi digestive symptom patient spleen qi deficiency radical gastrectomy gastric cancer .</detailed_description>
