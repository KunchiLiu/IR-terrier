	<brief_summary>Craniosynostosis ( CS ) common malformation occur ~4 per 10,000 live birth suture skull bone close early , cause long-term problem brain skull growth . Infants CS typically require extensive surgical treatment may experience many perioperative complication , include hemorrhage re-synostosis . Even successful surgery , child experience developmental learning disability vision problem . Most often , CS appear isolated nonsyndromic CS ( NSC ) . Of several subtypes CS , unilateral bilateral fusion coronal suture second common form CS account 20-30 % NSC case . The etiology coronal NSC ( cNSC ) well understood , although publish literature suggest multifactorial condition . About 5-14 % coronal craniosynostosis patient positive family history , specific genetic etiology identify &gt; 25 % cNSC case , suggest strong genetic component pathogenesis birth defect . The cause cNSC phenotypic heterogeneity remain largely unknown . An international team investigator generate large genomic gene expression datasets sample patient cNSC . State-of-the-art imaging , genetic , developmental system biology approach use quantitatively model novel pathway network involve development cNSC . Novel variant- , gene- network-level analysis perform genomic data obtain cNSC case , relative , control identify novel variant genetic region associate cNCS . Quantitative , analytical , functional validation prediction provide insight etiology possible therapeutic target CS potentially bone-related disorder .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Network Of Clinical Research Studies On Craniosynostosis , Skull Malformations With Premature Fusion Of Skull Bones</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The long-term goal Program Project , Craniosynostosis Network , elucidate normal abnormal craniofacial biology ultimately improve treatment craniofacial disorder . Craniosynostosis skull abnormality among common human malformation usually require surgical medical intervention . The Network integrate three project two core . Scientists diverse expertise include anthropology , morphometry , imaging , birth defect , developmental biology , genetics , genomics , epidemiology , statistic , system biology explore determinant fate relevant mesenchymal progenitor cell , abnormality osteogenesis contribute global skull growth abnormality premature closure cranial suture , especially coronal suture . High quality genomic data obtain patient coronal nonsyndromic craniosynostosis ( cNSC ) available parent . Novel genome-wide variant- , gene- network-level analysis perform family identify novel variant genetic region associate coronal craniosynostosis . This study multi-center , open-enrollment , retrospective study , employ family-based case-control study design . Approximately 4000 cNSC patient , family member , control recruit Mount Sinai majority recruit 10 collaborating institution worldwide .</detailed_description>
