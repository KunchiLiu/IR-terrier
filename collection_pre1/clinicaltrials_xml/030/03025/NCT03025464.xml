	<brief_summary>Obstructive sleep apnea ( OSA ) common type sleep apnea . The marketplace currently affordable , easy-to-use , over-the-counter , home-based OSA screening device . An affordable , available , FDA-approved easy-to-use over-the-counter OSA screening tool would allow great screen at-risk individual , especially underserved community low socioeconomic status , hopefully encouraging great proportion individual seek treatment condition . Over past year , investigative team engineer small screening device ( Zerify® ) OSA obtain preliminary evidence efficacy clinical population NIMHD-sponsored Phase I STTR award . Phase I Specific Aims 1 2 focus develop small ( 1.5 x 2.5 x 0.2 inch ) semiconductor sensor could store sound/motion data , transfer data computer , detect non-clinical simulated apnea event specificity specificity exceed 90 % . Phase I Specific Aim 3 establish preliminary psychometric performance data screen device clinical sample 52 patient ( 13 % African American , 6 % Asian , 4 % Mixed Other Race ) gold-standard polysomnography . Phase II proposal aim optimize engineer hardware associate OSA algorithms , create patient companion app wireless healthcare provider dashboard , compare efficacy screen device commonly utilized sleep apnea screener , home sleep apnea test ( HSAT ) .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Validation Sleep Apnea Screening Device Phase II</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>An alternative polysomnography ( PSG ) , do overnight lab , home sleep apnea test ( HSAT ) . Also know out-of-center testing , HSAT emerge convenient increasingly widely use method screen sleep apnea . HSAT record few signal assessment , le cumbersome traditional PSG , allow patient spend night home , eliminate need technical staff present testing . HSAT considerably less expensive PSG perform . Despite advantage , concern false-negatives underestimation disease severity HSAT . There clearly need improve accuracy less costly screening tool OSA . Zansors® wireless microsensor novel device screen sleep apnea , measure breathe pattern movement , collect data communicate smartphone via Bluetooth . In study , investigator compare Zansors microsensor HSAT PSG ass accuracy . Patients ask wear device clinical HSAT order doctor , in-laboratory sleep study . When patient train use HSAT equipment , research staff also show put Zansors® device . They wear home night HSAT . At later date , come in-laboratory sleep study , device wear overnight assess full PSG equipment . Together study , device recording help detect sleep apnea researcher compare result Zansors ® microsensor HSAT PSG equipment . If Zansors ® device confirm detect sleep hypopnea apneas accurately , use easily inexpensively people home screen obstructive sleep apnea .</detailed_description>
