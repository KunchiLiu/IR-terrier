	<brief_summary>This clinical research study consist 2 phase : dose escalation ( Phase 1 ) dose expansion ( Phase 2 ) . The goal Phase 1 research study find high tolerable dose level nivolumab give intravenous ( IV ) infusion intrathecal ( IT ) injection patient leptomeningeal disease ( LMD ) . IV infusion give vein , IT injections give directly cerebrospinal fluid ( CSF ) . The goal Phase 2 research study learn high tolerable dose level combination find Phase 1 help control disease . The safety drug combination also study phase .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Study Concurrent Intravenous Intrathecal Nivolumab Patients With Leptomeningeal Disease ( LMD )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Study Groups : If participant find eligible take part study , assign study group base join study . Up 18 participant enrol Phase 1 study , 12 participant enrol Phase 2 . If participant enrol Phase 1 , dose level IT nivolumab receive depend join study . The first group 6 participant receive low dose level IT nivolumab . Each new group receive high dose IT nivolumab group , intolerable side effect see . This continue high tolerable dose IT nivolumab find . If participant enrol Phase 2 , receive IT nivolumab high dose tolerated Phase 1 . All participant phase receive dose level IV nivolumab . Study Drug Administration : Each study cycle 14 day . Participant receive IT nivolumab injection directly CSF Ommaya reservoir Day 1 cycle . The injection take 5 minute . Participant need remain hospital 24 hour check side effect . Starting Cycle 2 , participant receive IV nivolumab vein 30 minute Day 2 every cycle . Length Study : Participant may continue take study drug long doctor think best interest . Participant longer able take study drug disease get bad , intolerable side effect occur , unable follow study direction . Participation study follow-up . Study Visits : On Day 1 Cycles 1 2 : - Participant physical exam . - Blood ( 1 ½ tablespoon ) draw routine testing , test well participant 's blood clot , check liver function . - Blood ( 4 ½ tablespoon time ) drawn immune system test participant 's IT nivolumab dose 4 hour dose . - CSF collect immune system test participant 's IT nivolumab dose 2 time next 24 hour participant 's dose . On Day 2 8 Cycles 1-3 blood ( 4½ tablespoon ) CSF collect immune system test . On Day 3 Cycle 2 , blood ( 4½ tablespoon ) CSF collect immune system test . On Day 1 Cycle 3 : - Participant physical , neurological , neurocognitive exam . - Blood ( 1½ tablespoon ) draw routine test check participant 's liver function . - Participant MRI check status disease . - Blood ( 4½ tablespoon ) CSF collect immune system test . On Days 1 2 Cycle 4 beyond : - Blood ( 4½ tablespoon ) draw immune system test . On Day 1 Cycle 5 every 4 cycle ( Cycles 9 , 13 , 17 , ) : - Participant physical , neurological , neurocognitive exam . - Blood ( 1½ tablespoon ) draw routine testing , see well participant 's blood clot , check liver function . - Participant MRI either CT PET-CT scan check status disease . - If participant become pregnant , blood ( 1 tablespoon ) urine collect pregnancy test . Treatment Beyond Progression : Sometimes disease appear get bad study drug actually work . If disease appear get bad tumor appear get large , participant may still able receive study drug doctor decide best interest . However , risk continue receive study drug disease may actually get bad . Participant still risk side effect due study drug . This could also delay start treatment . The disease may get bad point participant longer able receive treatment . If participant chooses receive study drug disease get bad , continue study visit describe above.The study doctor discus option participant . End-of-Study Visit : Within 4 week participant 's last dose study drug , follow test procedure perform : - Participant physical exam . - Blood ( 1 ½ tablespoon ) draw routine test . - CSF collect immune system test . Long-Term Follow-Up : Every 12 week participant 's last dose study drug , follow test procedure perform : - Participant physical exam . - Blood ( 1 ½ tablespoon ) draw routine test . - CSF collect immune system test . - Participant MRI either CT scan PET-CT scan check status disease . Every 12 week , participant also contact member study staff ask new anti-cancer therapy may receive . This contact take place regular clinic visit , participant may contact phone , email , mail . If participant contact phone , call last 15 minute . This investigational study . Nivolumab FDA approve commercially available treatment several type cancer . Its use LMD consider investigational . The method inject nivolumab CSF investigational . The study doctor explain study drug design work . Up 30 participant enrol study . All take part MD Anderson .</detailed_description>
