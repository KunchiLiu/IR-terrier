	<brief_summary>In study investigator evaluate effect high-dose , intermittent sunitinib versus treatment lomustine patient recurrent glioblastoma multiforme . The investigator hypothesize sunitinib , give high-dose , intermittent schedule , achieve adequate concentration level tumor , besides anti-angiogenic property , inhibit gliomagenesis inhibition multiple kinase .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Phase II/III Study High-dose , Intermittent Sunitinib Patients With Recurrent Glioblastoma Multiforme</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Study design : Multicenter , phase II/III , randomize clinical trial high-dose sunitinib versus lomustine ( CCNU ) patient recurrent GBM . Hypothesis : Sunitinib , give high-dose , intermittent schedule , may exhibit improved efficacy patient recurrent GBM acceptable toxicity profile , compare lomustine . Study population : Adult patient recurrent GBM . Primary objective : - To determine effect high-dose sunitinib versus lomustine six-month progression-free survival ( PFS6 ) patient recurrent GBM , use RANO criterion . Secondary objective : - To determine effect high-dose sunitinib overall survival ( OS 9 , OS 12 ) patient recurrent GBM . - To assess objective radiological response rate , use RANO criterion . - To assess toxicity , use Common Toxicity Criteria Adverse Events ( CTCAE ) version 4.0 . - To assess patient-oriented criterion : steroid use health-related quality life ( reported patient caregivers/relatives ) . - To explore potential value blood marker molecular diagnostics , disease response monitoring . - To explore MGMT promoter methylation status modulate response sunitinib . Treatment : After randomization , 100 patient divide equally two treatment group receive : - Group 1 ( experimental arm ) : Sunitinib , 300 mg administer orally weekly schedule . - Group 2 ( control arm ) : Lomustine 110 mg/m2 , take orally day 1 every 6 week . Disease assess MRI accord uniform neuro-oncology protocol every 6 week first 6 month every 12 week document progression . Safety profile treatment strategy assess separately cycle therapy every 12 week end treatment adverse effect resolve newly emerge . Furthermore , quality life assessment take place every 6 week use questionnaire .</detailed_description>
