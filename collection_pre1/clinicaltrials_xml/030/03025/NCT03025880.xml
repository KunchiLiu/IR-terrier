	<brief_title>Trial Evaluate Efficacy Safety Pembrolizumab Gemcitabine HER2-negative ABC</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Study Design Treatment ( continuation ) : The study include two cohort patient : ) Triple Negative ii ) Luminal A+B , approximate 1:1 distribution group . A safety dose test `` run-in-phase '' , 6+6 design , toxicity evaluate within first cycle , perform since pembrolizumab combination gemcitabine previously test . Initially 6 patient include study dose level 0 ( gemcitabine dose 1,250mg/m2 IV infusion day 1 8 21-day cycle pembrolizumab dose 200mg IV infusion day 1 21-day cycle ) : - If ≤ 2 patient experience Dose Limiting Toxicity ( DLT ) , 6 additional patient include current dose level . If confirmation dose safe ( ≤ 3 patient experience DLT ) , consider RP2D use follow recruited patient . - If ≥ 3 patient experience DLT within first 6 patient , ≥ 4 within first 12 patient include dose level 0 , de-escalation dose level -1 ( gemcitabine dose 1,000mg/m2 IV infusion day 1 8 21-day cycle pembrolizumab dose 200mg IV infusion day 1 21-day cycle ) perform . In case , group 12 additional patient include dose level -1 , ≥ 4 experience DLT , combination consider toxic study stop . If ≤ 3 experience DLT combination , consider RP2D use follow recruited patient . Initially 3 patient allow inclusion simultaneously . These 3 patient follow closely first cycle observe occurrence DLT . At time 3 patient complete first cycle , next 3 patient include one one , first cohort complete . If none 6 patient DLT , 4 patient allow inclusion second cohort 6 patient ; follow procedure first cohort . If one patient second cohort DLT , inclusion small group ( maximum number 4 patient DLT ) follow procedure first cohort 6 patient . An internal committee periodically review safety data order take decision maintain decrease dose level . This internal committee consist chief investigator , Grupo Español de Cáncer de Mama ( GEICAM ) Scientific Director study statistician . The meeting perform teleconference take decision quickly possible last patient finish first cycle treatment . Other meeting consider ad-hoc whenever necessary ( i.e new DLTs appear ) . Patients include run-in-phase dose phase II consider phase II analysis . Study Drug/Medication : Eligible patient enrol treat : Pembrolizumab dose 200mg intravenous ( IV ) infusion day 1 21-day cycle . combination Gemcitabine dose 1,250mg/m2 1,000mg/m2 ( dose explore combination pembrolizumab initial exploratory run-in-phase necessary ) intravenous ( IV ) infusion day 1 8 21-day cycle . Treatment repeat day 1 21-day cycle objective disease progression , clinical progression ( investigator criterion ) , unacceptable toxicity , death withdrawal consent , whichever occur first . Patients complete 24 month uninterrupted treatment pembrolizumab 35 administration study medication stop pembrolizumab treatment ( though may continue gemcitabine ) . Subjects stop pembrolizumab 24 month may eligible one year additional pembrolizumab treatment progress stop . An initial exploratory run-in-phase perform test safety combination determine Recommended Phase II Dose ( RP2D ) gemcitabine combination fix dose pembrolizumab . Primary Objective : - Run-in-phase : To determine Recommended Phase II Dose ( RP2D ) gemcitabine combination fix dose pembrolizumab . - Phase II : To assess efficacy pembrolizumab combination gemcitabine term Objective Response Rate ( ORR ) patient HER2-negative ABC . Primary End-point : - Run-in-phase : To determine incidence rate Dose Limiting Toxicity ( DLT ) within first cycle combination . - Phase II : Objective Response Rate ( ORR ) define Complete Response ( CR ) plus Partial Response ( PR ) accord Response Evaluation Criteria Solid Tumours ( RECIST ) version 1.1 . Secondary Objectives : The follow secondary objective study : - To assess efficacy measure combination patient include phase II ( include run-in-phase dose phase II ) . - To determine safety tolerability combination patient include study . Secondary End-points : The following secondary end-points study : - Efficacy : - Progression-Free Survival ( PFS ) assess accord RECIST version 1.1 investigator . - Clinical Benefit Rate ( CBR ) define Complete Response ( CR ) plus Partial Response ( PR ) plus Stable Disease ( SD ) last ≥ 24 week accord RECIST version 1.1 . - Response Duration ( RD ) assess accord RECIST version 1.1 . - Overall Survival ( OS ) . With special interest long term responder ( i.e . alive without disease progression 24 month study treatment ) . - Safety assessed standard clinical laboratory test ( haematology , serum chemistry ) . Adverse Events ( AE ) grade define NCI CTCAE ( National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria Adverse Events ) version 4.0 . Exploratory Objectives : The follow exploratory objective study patient include study unless otherwise specify : - To assess efficacy measure combination base immune-related ( ir ) response criterion patient include phase II ( include run-in-phase dose phase II ) . - To search tumour tissue peripheral blood biomarkers clinical activity . - To compare biomarkers data cohort healthy volunteer ( available ) data patient include study . Exploratory End-points : The following exploratory end-points study : - Efficacy : - ORR define immune-related Complete Response ( irCR ) plus immune-related Partial Response ( irPR ) accord immune-related RECIST ( irRECIST ) . - Progression-Free Survival ( PFS ) assess accord irRECIST investigator . - Clinical Benefit Rate ( CBR ) define irCR plus irPR plus immune-related Stable Disease ( irSD ) last ≥ 24 week accord irRECIST . - Response Duration ( RD ) assess accord irRECIST . - A set immune biomarkers analyse correlated evolution disease efficacy pembrolizumab combination gemcitabine ( ORR efficacy end-points : PFS , CBR RD ) , pay special attention long term responder . - This set immune biomarkers compare healthy volunteer ( available ) . Study population : Patients HER2-negative advanced breast cancer . Justification Sample size determination : A Simon 's minimax two-stage design employ possibility stop early due lack response . Results previous study show gemcitabine produce response rate around 20 % , expect H0 . With combination pembrolizumab gemcitabine , expect increase rate 35 % H1 ( absolute increase 15 % ) , alpha error 0.05 statistical power 80 % , need include 53 evaluable patient trial . The first stage include 31 evaluable patient , least 7 present response , recruitment continue include 53 evaluable patient . The null hypothesis H0=20 % reject 16 response observe 53 patient . Statistical Analyses : Demographics Baseline Characteristics : Standard descriptive statistic , mean , median , range proportion , use summarize patient sample estimate parameter interest . Safety Analyses : AEs Serious Adverse Events ( SAE ) report frequency table ( overall intensity ) . The safety analysis perform population receive least one dose study drugs/medications . Efficacy Analyses : All efficacy endpoint evaluate Per-protocol Intent treat ( ITT ) population . Biomarker analysis : The biomarker analysis exploratory descriptive . For continuous variable , mean , standard deviation , median , minimum maximum value provide . Categorical variable summarize number proportion . Biomarker endpoint evaluate patient enrol study available sample . Study Duration : The end date study date last patient´s death date sufficient data achieve primary secondary objective patient end study treatment , whichever come first . Performing exploratory objective independent date end study .</detailed_description>
