	<brief_summary>This pilot study evaluate effectiveness use photodynamic therapy treatment cutaneous squamous cell situ ( SCCis ) . Our hypothesis PDT effective treating SCCis . This study also secondarily evaluate tolerability use photodynamic therapy treatment SCCis . Investigators plan enroll 40 subject biopsy proven SCCis . Exclusion criterion include lesion high-risk site ( head , neck , hand , foot ) , previous severe adverse reaction topical 20 % aminolevulinic acid ( Kerastick ) , previous severe adverse reaction blue light ( BLU-U ) , allergy Tegaderm , primary secondary immunosuppression , history &gt; 6 skin cancer past year , photosensitize condition lupus , sensitivity porphyrin . Age , gender , size , location SCCis record . All subject receive surgical treatment SCCis . The control group undergo surgical excision tumor . After excision , subject ask fill satisfaction survey . The intervention group receive PDT plus surgical treatment . Photographs lesion take study visit . Subjects intervention group undergo study procedure application topical 20 % 5-ALA ( Levulan Kerastick ; DUSA Pharmaceuticals ) SCCis . At 3-5 week initial treatment , subject repeat 3-hour ALA incubation blue light exposure . At 6 month last treatment , subject intervention group return clinical follow-up surgical excision lesion . After excision , specimen send process pathology subject ask fill satisfaction visual analog scale . All slide read board-certified dermatopathologist . Side effect also monitor use grade scale describe previously . Mild adverse event associate PDT , include erythema , skin crusting , superficial blistering , hypopigmentation , hyperpigmentation . These reaction usually occur immediately PDT treatment .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Objective : This trial evaluate effectiveness photodynamic therapy ( aminolevulinic acid plus blue light ) treatment cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma situ ( SCCis ) . This pilot study prospectively recruit 40 subject biopsy proven SCCis time visit University Dermatology East Providence office . Exclusion criterion include lesion high-risk site ( head , neck , hand , foot ) , previous severe adverse reaction topical 20 % aminolevulinic acid ( Kerastick ) , previous severe adverse reaction blue light ( BLU-U ) , allergy Tegaderm , primary secondary immunosuppression , history &gt; 6 skin cancer past year , photosensitize condition lupus , sensitivity porphyrin . Half subject randomize control group ( n=20 ) , remain subject ( n=20 ) randomize intervention group . The subject 's age gender , size location SCCis record . For control group , subject undergo surgical excision tumor , gold standard treatment SCCis . After excision , subject ask fill satisfaction survey . They receive PDT treatment . For intervention group , photograph lesion take study visit . A clear transparency film use trace clinical margin lesion , well distinctive skin marking nevi birthmark . Subjects undergo study procedure . The area treat swabbed alcohol wipe allow dry . The investigator apply topical 20 % 5-ALA SCCis . Then , area cover Tegaderm film 3 hour . At end 3 hour , Tegaderm remove subject exposed blue light source , standard protocol treatment blue light PDT . During administration light immediately afterwards , subject monitor side effect , erythema , edema , stinging/burning , blisters/crusting , hyperpigmentation , hypopigmentation . These item grade scale 1 4 ( 1=mild 4=severe ) assess immediately treatment . This process repeat next visit 3-5 week later . At six month last treatment , subject intervention group return clinical follow-up surgical excision lesion . Patients complete satisfaction survey end visit .</detailed_description>
