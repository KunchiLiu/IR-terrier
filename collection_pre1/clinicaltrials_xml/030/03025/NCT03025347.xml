	<brief_title>Effect Exercise Appetite Gut Peptides Men With Variants Obesity-linked FTO rs9939609 Polymorphism</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The fat mass obesity-associated gene ( FTO ) rs9939609 A allele relate obesity ( Frayling et al. , 2007 ) , great food intake ( Speakman et al. , 2008 ) impair postprandial reduction ghrelin ( Karra et al. , 2013 ) . Exercise acutely suppress level ghrelin appetite ( Broom et al. , 2007 ) , yet whether response differs people without rs9939609 A allele unknown . This study assess effect exercise appetite , appetite-regulatory hormone energy intake variant FTO rs9939609 polymorphism . Cohort We initially recruit 202 subject database measure FTO rs9939609 genotype . From subject , recruit 12 individual homozygous 'obesity-risk ' rs9939609 A allele 12 homozygous T allele . A sample size 24 chosen base previous data suggest 34 pg/ml reduction circulate acylated ghrelin exercise could detect &gt; 80 % power two-tailed t-test whilst assume standard deviation difference 54 pg/ml . Familiarisation trial First , participant arrive familiarisation trial . Participants fast ~2-3 hour beforehand . Participant 's height , weight skinfold measure take . Furthermore , food preference questionnaire complete ensure acceptability food item provide study . Participants complete sub-maximal fitness test , last 16 minute , comprise four , four minute stage . Initial treadmill speed set accord fitness increase every four minute 0.5-1.5 km/h . Prior test , participant fit cannula antecubital vein blood sample withdrawn test . This familiarise participants procedure reduce stress relate novelty first visit . Next , maximal fitness test conduct measure maximal oxygen uptake . This consist incremental protocol treadmill gradient begin 3.5 % increase 2.5 % every 3 minute . The speed treadmill remain constant , determine base fitness level . Though duration test typically 9-15 minute , last participant reach volitional exhaustion . After fitness test adequate recovery time , participant present buffet-style meal instruct eat comfortably full satisfy . To finish , participant give calibrate set weigh scale instruction standardize food intake main trial . Main trial Each participant complete two main trial separate 7 day : exercise trial control trial . In 24 hour main trial , participant follow set standardization procedure . They record food consume timing meal first trial . This subsequently replicate 24 hour prior second main trial . Moreover , participant visit lab provide meal instruct prepare consume 19:00-20:00 night main trial . They also instruct refrain strenuous physical activity alcohol consumption period . Participants report lab morning trial 08:00 follow overnight fast . Participants instruct walk slowly lab morning trial . At 08:30 , cannula insert antecubital vein follow 60 minute rest . On exercise trial , 09:30 10:30 , participant run continuous pace correspond 70 % participant 's maximal oxygen uptake . Participants rest bed period control trial . Participants rest provide selection movie watch rest trial . There two meal provide participant : standardise meal ad libitum buffet style meal . The standardised meal fix breakfast meal participant provide 10:50 , instruct consume within 20 minute . The ad libitum buffet style meal give 15:50 consist array food differ energy macronutrient composition . Participants present buffet food 30 minute instructed eat comfortably full satisfy . Statistical procedure Linear mixed model , factor trial ( exercise control ) , genotype ( AA TT ) time perform time-course measure . Area curve calculate use trapezoidal rule outcome measure take periodically throughout day . Linear mixed model also use trial genotype comparison area curve value measure take throughout day . At point interest , significant main interaction effect occur , post-hoc analysis conduct use Holm-Bonferroni adjust t-tests . Statistical significance accept P &lt; 0.05 .</detailed_description>
