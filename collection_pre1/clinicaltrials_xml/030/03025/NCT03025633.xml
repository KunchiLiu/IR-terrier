	<brief_summary>Radiotherapy use high dos x-ray direct tumour kill , unfortunate side effect healthy surround tissue receive x-ray dose damage . Approximately 22 % radiotherapy patient receive treatment cure prostate cancer . The technique use require patient maintain full bladder empty bowel next prostate , aim radiotherapy planning minimise radiation dose receive healthy organ tissue reduce side effect . PEARL commercial interactive PC software show realistic functional 3D model Linac 's ( machine deliver radiotherapy treatment ) . Using PEARL 's possible display realistic patient treatment include individual would lay treatment couch machine move sound treatment . Additionally PEARL provide opportunity look inside body view internal anatomy show radiotherapy treatment direct . Information prior treatment radiotherapy normally give verbally one one . The investigator believe information easily understand PEARL use conjunction verbal exchange . PEARL give visual audio representation treatment experience , demonstrate reason behind required preparation . Research aim demonstrate patient receive information use PEARL great understanding , reduce anxiety reduce radiation dose . This test use two group patient receive radiotherapy prostate . Group A - Verbal information , Group B - Verbal information PEARL demonstration . Data collection via patient questionnaire review Cone Beam Computer Tomography ( CBCT ) image take prior radiotherapy treatment standard practice . CBCT 's used locate treatment area ass bladder bowel status ensure suitable deliver treatment accurately .</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Patients diagnose cancer prostate follow staging : T13b , N01 , M0 . Clinical intention treat use external radiotherapy base three local departmental protocol : TPCP97 , TPCP98 TPCP99 . These protocol dictate patient receive VMAT plan treatment , require full bladder empty rectum require daily localisation use kV cone beam CT ( CBCT ) . Patients consent study . Patients fulfil inclusion criterion . Patients diagnosed depression . Blind patient patient severe visual impairment . Patients reduce understanding due mental impairment . Patients willing consent study . Prisoners young offender . Patients unable understand verbal explanation give English .</criteria>
