	<brief_title>Ballooned Intercostal Drain Trial</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Chest drain essential part treatment patient fluid air around lung , usually cause breathlessness . Draining fluid air relief symptoms allows investigation carry identify cause fluid air . Chest drain difficult secure place , sometimes fall despite best possible care . This study test modify drain small balloon near end , inflate inside chest cavity , make much hard drain fall chest . This test small pilot study , encourage result . The current study compare group patient treat new ballooned drain group treat standard drain , patient equally randomly allocate group . The chest drain rigorous laboratory test CE mark human use . All patient require intercostal drainage clinical reason offer entry study , unless , view treat physician , blunt dissection require . No screen assessment require , ability sign inform consent form.Patients provide sign informed consent proceed study protocol . Patients randomise undergo either standard ICT insertion ( usual clinical care ) insertion study drain use standard clinical policy procedures participate centre . Once patient identify trial sign informed consent form , baseline detail enter dedicated web-based programme accessible site , patient allocate 1:1 either usual care study drain . All subsequent care per best clinical care patient arm study . The additional assessment usual care collection pain score . Pain rat patient visual analogue scale ( VAS ) 4 occasion - insertion , 24 72 hour post insertion , drain removal .</detailed_description>
