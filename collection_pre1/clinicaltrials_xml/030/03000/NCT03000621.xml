	<brief_summary>The objective : 1. validate panel tissue-specific miRNAs differentially express plasma patient without liver injury 2. investigate physiological range circulate miRNA panel Healthy Subjects stress 3. investigate dysregulation circulate miRNA panel prognostic predictive value clinical outcome identify patient high risk mortality acute liver failure . This trial involve peripheral blood sample subject early presentation remain stay hospitalization emergency department . The investigator develop panel miRNAs specific indicator early onset major organ failure , correlate clinical outcome miRNAs .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The ICU patient surgery chemotherapies sponsor 's institute enrol observational cohort investigation . Whole blood sample separate immediately plasma storage . The participant 2nd 3rd sample obtain 24-48 hour 48-72 hour respectively . The schedule sample schedule design concordance ICU routines avoid extra burden patient . The plasma sample use prognostic marker prognostic predictive value identify patient high risk mortality acute liver failure . Patients discharge tracked clinical recurrence disease every 28 day assess diagnostic accuracy miRNA biomarkers measure . The 2nd objective assess measure concentration miRNAs recruit healthy volunteer brief public speech . The circulate miRNAs detect directly 1 - 5 ul plasma sample miRFLP assay . This capillary electrophoresis-based miRNA quantification method detect multiple miRNAs absolute copy number small sample signature negligible batch batch variation , thus provide standardizable miRNA detection method .</detailed_description>
