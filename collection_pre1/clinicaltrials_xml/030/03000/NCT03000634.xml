	<brief_title>2015-09 : A Phase II Randomized , Open-label Study Anti-signaling Lymphocytic Activation Molecule Monoclonal Antibody During Maintenance Therapy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Past study conduct Myeloma Institute show many patient low-risk disease ( determine gene array study - study look specific gene use special equipment ) respond well treatment . However , 15 % low-risk patient still relapse first three year treatment , mean good treatment still need . This study compare effectiveness safety maintenance therapy continuous bortezomib , lenalidomide , dexamethasone ( VRD ) compare maintenance therapy alternate VRD Elotuzumab , lenalidomide , dexamethasone ( Elo RD ) every eight week . Elotuzumab , bortezomib , lenalidomide dexamethasone approve FDA treatment patient multiple myeloma . VRD standard maintenance regimen prescribe University Arkansas Medical Sciences ( UAMS ) Myeloma Institute patient low risk disease . The investigator want learn alternate VRD Elo RD maintenance therapy result well outcome .</detailed_description>

The complete regimen may also include posttransplant consolidation therapy , posttransplant consolidation require . The regimen must include , minimum , proteasome inhibitor , immunomodulatory agent , corticosteroid . Patients must lowrisk disease , define exist myeloma prognostic risk score risk score &lt; 50.4 prior bone marrow biopsy sample plasma cell present . Patients must high risk cytogenetic abnormality , define one follow chromosomal aberration detect fluorescent situ hybridization : 17p , 1q+ , ( 4 ; 14 ) ( 14 ; 16 ) . Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group ≤ 2 , unless solely due symptom multiple myelomarelated bone disease . Patients must absolute neutrophil count ( ANC ) ≥ 1,000/mm3 platelet count ≥ 100,000/µL , unless low level due extensive bone marrow plasmacytosis .
