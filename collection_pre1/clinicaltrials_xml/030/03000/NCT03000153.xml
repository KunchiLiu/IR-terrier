It also sensitive change clinical population ( Cooper , 2014 ; Michael , Cooper , &amp; Fugard , 2015 ) . In term user acceptability , client ' give Goals Form mean rating 4.2 5-point helpfulness scale ( SD = 1.2 , n = 17 ) , median modal rating 5 ( helpful ) . Ten 17 respondent ( 58.8 % ) give high rating . By contrast , mean rating PHQ-9 3.7 ( SD = 1.0 , n = 17 ) , median modal rating 4 ( helpful ) . Intro change interview ( Cooper et al. , 2015 ) . In term Goals Form helpful , five interviewee Cooper et al . 's ( 2015 ) study say give sense progress , session session course therapy . Interviewee 1 , instance , say : 'It kind give barometer I ' . Five participant say give focus structure therapy , remind come work 'where want end ' ( Interviewee 10 ) . Interviewee 6 , instance , say : ' I 'm scatty mindâ€¦because I depress I could n't concentrate 's helpful something black white paper know work .

At end therapy , participant fill service satisfaction survey . Participants experimental arm also take short quantitative questionnaire ass helpfulness CORE-10 Goals Form . In addition , random selection participant experimental arm study invite back meet researcher participate Qualitative Interview .
