	<brief_summary>Background : 1 . Burden : Recently Bangladesh introduce mandatory vitamin A ( VA ) fortification refine edible oil high dose VA supplementation infant child still place part national program . Thus preschool child plausible risk hypervitaminosis A . 2 . Knowledge gap : Serum VA concentration authenticate indicator VA status , exist deuterium- VA isotope dilution method determine whole body VA status require 3 week applicable infant child . 3 . Relevance : Our research group recently develop new simplify equation measure VA pool size 4-5 day , highly correlated compartmental model-predicted value estimate VA pool size adult high precision . However , clear whether new simplify equation also work infant child . In proposed study , validate method healthy infant infant inflammatory condition well child adequate high dietary VA intake . Hypothesis : ( 1 ) Whole-body VA status infant child estimate without account fractional catabolic rate context inflammatory condition high dietary VA intake ( 2 ) Fortification commonly consume food item VA along periodic high dose VA supplementation would increase risk hypervitaminosis A among preschool child Bangladesh Methods : Our study comprise two study . `` Study 01 '' undertaken infant `` Study 02 '' preschool child . At first need undertake one feasibility study verify whether oral dose 400 μg 13C10 13C3- retinyl acetate ( isotopic VA ) propose use study would work infant observed adult , secondly , whether PENTA valent vaccine induce inflammation infant ( plasma CRP maker ) closely mimics natural infection . We need infant inflammatory condition `` Study 01 '' answer question whether isotope dilution technique still work child undergo inflammation . Information reliability retinol isotope dilution technique infectious condition important national dietary assessment survey often observe child chronic latent infection . To minimize take multiple blood sample infant/child study , `` super kid study '' design adopt ensure 2 venous blood sample infant/child , even though multiple time point ( least 5 subject / time-point ) 28-day study period available mathematical modelling . In `` Study 01 '' total 115 infant ( 9-11 mo ) receive oral dose 13C10- retinyl acetate ( 400 μg ) dissolve 0.5 mL sunflower oil blood sample take 6h 16th day 9 different time-points . On day 16 , single dose PENTA vaccine provide randomly select 50 % infant . On day 17 , another type stable isotopic VA e.g . 13C3- retinyl acetate ( 400 μg ) orally supplement infant . Blood sample collect day 16 day 28 11 different time-points vaccine non-vaccine group . In `` Study 02 '' 50 child ( 3-5y ) `` adequate dietary VA '' intake group `` high dietary VA '' intake group enrol receive oral dose 13C10- retinyl acetate ( 400 μg ) . Blood sample collect 6h day 28 11 time-points two group . Specific activity 13C10-VA 13C3-VA blood sample measure liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry ( LC/MS/MS ) . Plasma biomarkers VA toxicity e.g . bone metabolism , liver fibrogenesis VA metabolites measure child `` Study 02 '' . Outcome measures/variables : ( 1 ) The early time point equation assess VA pool size group infant without inflammation group child adequate high dietary VA intake . ( 2 ) The association biomarkers VA toxicity estimate liver vitamin A concentration preschool child risk hypervitaminosis A .</brief_summary>
