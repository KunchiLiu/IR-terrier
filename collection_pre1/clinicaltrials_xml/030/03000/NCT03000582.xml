	<detailed_description>Creatine nitrate contain several nutrient may increase anaerobic exercise performance . Theoretically , dietary supplementation creatine nitrate resistance training improve quality training lead great change strength , power fat free mass . Endothelial function measure flow-mediated dilation ( FMD ) , non-invasive vascular health parameter measure via ultrasonography , predictor cardiovascular disease risk precede traditional risk marker . Diet , physical activity pharmaceutical intervention impact vascular function health . The purpose study determine acute vascular response creatine nitrate supplementation FMD analyze pharmacokinetics creatine nitrate supplementation .</detailed_description>
