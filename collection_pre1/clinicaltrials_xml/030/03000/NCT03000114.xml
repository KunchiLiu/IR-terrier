	<brief_summary>Dupuytren 's disease non-curative , progressive disorder lead function-impairing deformity hand . Although numerous treatment exist , common widely accepted therapy removal diseased fascia . Surgery limit prolonged recovery time , many patient require multiple surgery throughout life disease progress , repeat surgery increase risk complication . Long recovery time need repeat surgery renew interest minimally invasive treatment Dupuytren 's disease . Percutaneous needle aponeurotomy ( PNA ) allow rapid improvement finger extension minimal recovery time . The FDA approve collagenase clostridium histolyticum injection Dupuytren 's disease 2010 , also allow rapid increase finger extension , also minimal recovery time . Currently one small study compare PNA collagenase injection ( CI ) suggest similar outcome treatment . Both treatment minimally invasive , require minimal time work post-procedure pain . The main barrier widespread adoption CI cost , particularly patient multiple area disease require treatment . The project propose compare two method treat Dupuytren 's disease . Approximately 334 participant recruit patient refer treatment hand surgeon train CI PNA two Calgary , AB hospital . Need treatment determine usual fashion , option entry study propose patient meet inclusion/exclusion criterion . Participants randomize either PNA CI treatment group . The surgeon blind procedure group ; however , therapist measure outcome , study participant need divulge therapist group . Both procedure perform local freezing , range 5-20minutes . PNA involve surgeon freeze skin Dupuytren 's cord , use small gauge needle insert skin cut cord . This repeated length cord weaken , allow surgeon extend finger rupture cord . CI involve injection collagenase ( XiaflexÂ® ) , directly Dupuytren 's cord . The patient return see surgeon within one week , freeze place hand , affect digit extended rupture already weaken cord . The patient require present hand therapist team measurement joint angle assign treatment perform . In order measure treatment efficacy , study participant require return measurement treat joint every 6 month . Lastly , participant need inform perform surgeon therapist , follow-up visit complication experience .</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Patients require treatment functionally limit Dupuytren 's disease involve MCP PIP joint , define MCP joint contracture 20100 degree , PIP joint contracture 2080 degree positive table top test . Patients must 18 year age enroll study . Patients previous intervention contracture present treatment , effort compare similar disease state risk procedure . Disease involve DIP joint thumb , collagenase approve use thumb DIP joint . Pregnant nursing , although data indicate detection collagenase patient serum follow injection Dupuytren 's contracture , data explore effect collagenase fetus infant . Anticoagulation therapy ASA ( hold 7 day prior procedure ) , recommendation manufacture collagenase use study .</criteria>
