	<brief_summary>The purpose study invite people diagnose cancer meet eligibility criterion complete questionnaire treatment begin regular interval time assess impact cancer treatment people 's life short , medium long term . We explore range factor determine role recovery health well-being self-management . Although known people cancer likely experience number physical psychological problem result disease treatment , know 'typical ' course recovery health well-being look like , long take influence . We determine pathways recovery health well-being follow cancer diagnosis ( initially breast cancer diagnose &lt; 50 year , Non-Hodgkin Lymphoma gynaecological cancer ) identify factor influence . This include assess relative importance person 's illness , personal attribute , perceive burden treatment , role environment live , include health / social care personal network support , ability capacity self-manage . We identify risk problem environmental support resource people able mobilise support self-management . We also explore confidence ability manage beyond treatment factor influence whether lead earlier problem resolution restoration health well-being . This knowledge use develop test future supportive intervention enhance rapid recovery health well-being - long term aim design way help people cancer area identify problematic .</brief_summary>
