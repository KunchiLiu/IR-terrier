	<brief_summary>Background : People allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplant ( HCT ) bone marrow immune system damage . They get stem cell donor relative . Researchers want study stem cell donor recipient learn long-term effect HCT . They want learn stem cell change improve ability fight cancer . Objectives : To provide long-term follow-up care people underwent undergo HCT . To collect data , blood , tissue sample learn late complication HCT . Eligibility : Adults age 18 old undergo HCT underwent HCT survive one year date HCT . The stem cell donor recipient also need . Design : Recipients 1 visit year . They physical exam . They answer question medical history health . They receive screen surveillance test . They complete brief questionnaire . Recipients blood test . They may tissue biopsy specimen ( tissue cheek skin bone marrow biopsy ) . Recipients give current address phone number , data one two people , get contact . After first visit clinic , recipient may see doctor close home get necessary information send NIH . Donors come clinic 1 visit . They answer question medical history . Blood sample take .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Background : - Patients survive 3 year allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation ( HCT ) high probability cure underlying disease ; however , mortality rate remain 4 9-fold high general population least 30 year HCT . - The common cause late mortality HCT survivor include second malignancy , relapsed/recurrent disease , infection , chronic graft-versus-host disease ( GVHD ) , respiratory disease , cardiovascular disease . - Guidelines recommend screen preventive practice long-term survivor HCT develop , implement detect prevent late complication HCT . - Understanding pattern immune reconstitution immune dysregulation HCT may help elucidate root mechanism late complication . Objectives : -To collect clinical data patient late complication HCT Eligibility : - Patients underwent HCT indication survive one year date HCT OR patient undergo HCT ETIB protocol . - Related stem cell donor patient meet criterion participate participate donor stem cell leukocytes . - Age great equal 18 year - Any active disease relapse new hematologic malignancy include post-transplant lymphoproliferative disorder ( PTLD ) exclude protocol enrollment . Design : - Prospective , longitudinal study natural history long-term survivor HCT . - Clinical data post-transplant complication peripheral blood sample collect yearly evaluation Principal Investigator , LAI , AI representative investigator original HCT protocol . - If patient develops complication new cancer , relapse disease , new hematologic malignancy PTLD exempt require evaluation , follow survival cause death ( management complication per primary team ) . - As longitudinal registry study without plan intervention , formal statistical analysis plan accrual goal ; descriptive data report .</detailed_description>
	<criteria>INCLUSION CRITERIA FOR PATIENT SUBJECTS : Patients underwent HCT indication ( malignant nonmalignant ) survive one year date HCT ( patient may time point HCT long great equal 1 year ) OR patient undergoing HCT indication ( malignant nonmalignant ) ETIB protocol . Patients need transplant ETIB protocol . Age great equal 18 year Ability subject understand willingness sign write informed consent document EXCLUSION CRITERIA FOR PATIENT SUBJECTS : Patients active disease relapse new hematologic malignancy include posttransplant lymphoproliferative disorder ( PTLD ) exclude protocol enrollment . INCLUSION CRITERIA FOR DONOR SUBJECTS : Related stem cell donor patient meet criterion donor stem cell leukocytes Age great equal 18 year Ability subject understand willingness sign write informed consent document</criteria>
