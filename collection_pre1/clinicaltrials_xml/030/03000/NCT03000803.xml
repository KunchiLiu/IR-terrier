	<detailed_description>The timing food intake caloric distribution across 24hr day emerge contribute factor weight gain . The idea eat , eat contribute weight gain garner interest scientific community public . In fact , distribution caloric intake 24hr day recently recognize potential source `` circadian misalignment '' result adverse health outcome , include overeating , impair glucose tolerance insulin sensitivity . Moreover , reward drive eating ( eat pleasurable aspect instead energy need ) generally result caloric intake well excess energy requirement recognize major culprit epidemic obesity . The endocannabinoid ( eCB ) system involve homeostatic process ( energy need ) govern food intake , show play key role reward eat . Thus , role circadian organization eCB system misalignment may contribute overeat , overweight , obesity , diabetes main focus study . The overall goal determine whether time food intake major determinant 24 hour variation eCB activity turn affect hunger appetite , glucose metabolism , insulin sensitivity . This study focus overweight individual high risk obesity still trajectory potentially reverse lifestyle change . Following careful assessment subject 's habitual sleep meal time caloric distribution real life condition , short laboratory study determine whether participant consume daily calorie later day ( later dietary chronotype ) display delay eCB rhythm low insulin sensitivity . During 6-day patient intervention , combine laboratory ambulatory procedure , study procedure assess effect experimentally change caloric distribution across day , advance versus delay dietary chronotype . The outcome measure time daily peak eCB rhythm insulin sensitivity . This study also measure potential durability intervention subsequent habitual behavior real life condition , long one maintain feeding lab impose feeding schedule schedule effect subsequent behavior and/or weight . Identification circadian misalignment eCB system mediator increase food intake reduce insulin sensitivity may help develop novel preventive strategy .</detailed_description>
