	<brief_title>A Study Determine Efficacy Combination Daratumumab ( DARA ) Plus Durvalumab ( DURVA ) ( D2 ) Subjects With Relapsed Refractory Multiple Myeloma ( RRMM )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Indication : This study include subject relapse refractory multiple myeloma ( RRMM ) treatment least 3 prior antimyeloma therapy , include proteasome inhibitor ( PI ) immunomodulatory drug ( IMiD® ) development double-refractoriness PI IMiD . The recent multiple myeloma ( MM ) treatment regimen contain daratumumab ( DARA ) subject must progress DARA regimen . Stage 1 A cohort 18 subject enrol determine preliminary efficacy DARA plus DURVA . Once 18 subject enrol , interim analysis futility purpose conduct determine study proceed Stage 2 . Early Safety Monitoring Once 6 subject enrol complete first treatment cycle Stage 1 study , enrollment continuity would depend availability safety data on-going Phase 2 study ( MEDI4736-MM-003 ) DARA DURVA previously DARA-naïve patient . - If MEDI4736-MM-003 safety data available tolerability profile DARA plus DURVA determine adequate , enrollment continue plan Stage 1 without early safety monitoring review data . - If safety data available enrollment study pause review safety profile DARA plus DURVA Dose Review Team ( DRT ) , use data first 6 patient . - If ≥ 1 first 6 patient experience dose-limiting toxicity ( DLT ) , study halt review change dose regimen may implement . - The DRT consist Celgene Medical Monitor , Celgene lead Safety Physician , Celgene biostatistician , Celgene functional area representative , appropriate , study specific consultant ( MD/PhD ) , site investigator and/or designees enrol subject study . - All available safety , applicable , PK/ ( pharmacodynamic ) Pd , biomarker , preliminary efficacy data review consider DRT 's decision . - A DRT meeting hold review data make decision regard continuity study . Dose-limiting Toxicity Dose-limiting toxicity ( DLTs ) may evaluate DLT evaluation period initial 6 patient Part 1 study . The DLT evaluation period define first treatment cycle . Subjects consider evaluable assessment DLT : - Receive least 1 dose study treatment experience DLT OR - Receive 1 dose DURVA , 4 dos DARA complete safety follow-up end DLT evaluation period . Grading DLTs accord National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria Adverse Events ( NCI CTCAE ) Version 4.03 . A DLT define : Hematologic DLT 1 . Grade 4 neutropenia observe great 5 day duration 2 . Grade 3 neutropenia associate fever ( ≥ 38.5 °C ) duration . 3 . Grade 4 thrombocytopenia Grade 3 thrombocytopenia bleeding , requirement platelet transfusion . 4 . Any Grade 4 hematologic toxicity resolve subject 's pretreatment baseline level within 72 hour 5 . Grade 4 anemia , unexplained underlying disease . Non-hematologic DLT . Any nonhematological toxicity ≥ Grade 3 except alopecia nausea control medical management b . Any treatment interruption great 2 week due AE . While rule adjudicate DLTs context dose escalation specify , AE list may define DLT consultation Sponsor investigator , base emerge safety profile . Stage 2 If 3 subject achieve response ( PR well ) 18 subject end Stage 1 , additional 32 subject enrol evaluate safety efficacy DARA plus DURVA . Part 2 : Expansion Upon completion Part 1 , least 9 subject achieve response ( PR well ) total 50 subject determine confirm efficacy safety DARA plus DURVA , additional 70 subject may enrol . An Independent Response Adjudication Committee ( IRAC ) set trial review study data . The IRAC determine tumor response therapy confirm time disease progression ( PD ) ( disease progress ) schedule unscheduled visit subject . The safety efficacy study monitor independent Data Monitoring Committee ( DMC ) involve trial conduct . The DMC meet review study data pre specify interval throughout trial . In event trial halt early safety monitoring , evaluation emerge safety data initial 6 patient enrol Part 1 perform Dose Review Team ( DRT ) . Safety data monitor Celgene Medical Monitor Safety Physician ongoing basis throughout study . Should significant safety issue identify , DMC convene make recommendation future conduct study . The decision discontinue subject , delay refuse Sponsor , remain responsibility treat physician . However , prior discontinue subject , Investigator may contact Medical Monitor forward appropriate support document review discussion . The study conduct compliance International Council Harmonisation ( ICH ) Technical Requirements Registration Pharmaceuticals Human Use/Good Clinical Practice ( GCP ) applicable regulatory requirement .</detailed_description>
