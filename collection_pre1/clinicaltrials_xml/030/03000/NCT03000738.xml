	<brief_title>The Value Mechanisms Monocytes Subpopulations Predicting Prognosis Lymphomas</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The investigator plan prospectively involve 100 non-hodgekin lymphoma patient , include 50 diffuse large B cell lymphomas 50 peripheral T cell lymphoma without previous treatment Peking Union Medical College Hospital . The following parameter collect : age , sex , subtype , Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group ( ECOG ) performance status ( PS ) , Ann Arbor stage ( I-IV ) , presence B symptom , number type involve site , prognostic index include International Prognostic Index ( IPI ) DLBCLand PIT PTCL base medical record review . All patient would regular treatment follow PUMCH . During follow , treatment response evaluate enhanced computed tomography PET-CT . The peripheral blood would collect . The Cytodiff flow cytometric technique would use test 16 leukocyte subpopulation peripheral blood time diagnosis , interim treatment , end treatment , 1 year follow-up , 1.5 year follow-up , 2 year follow , 3 year follow-up disease progression . Progression-free survival ( PFS ) overall survival ( OS ) would estimate use Kaplan-Meier method two-tailed log-rank test.The Cox proportional hazard model would evaluate prognostic factor OS PFS . Specificity , sensitivity cut-off would establish use time-dependent receiver operate characteristic ( ROC ) curve analysis . Area curve ( AUC ) value &gt; 0.7 indicate parameter use diagnosis , value &gt; 0.9 indicate high clinical accuracy .</detailed_description>
