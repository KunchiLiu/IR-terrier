	<criteria>Signed date write informed consent . Male female ≥ 18 year age . Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group ( ECOG ) performance status 0 1 . Histologically confirm adenocarcinoma small intestine advance ( amenable surgery ) metastatic ( clinical stage IV ) . Note : Tumors ampullary carcinoma duodenal cancer intestinal feature upon pathological examination eligible . At least one prior systemic treatment ( include neoadjuvant therapy ) adenocarcinoma small intestine , intolerance prior therapy , failure recent therapy ( line ) recurrent disease . At least one measurable lesion define Response Evaluation Criteria Solid Tumors ( RECIST ) version 1.1 criterion previously irradiate follow CT MRI . Adequate organ function include : Absolute neutrophil count ( ANC ) ≥ 1.5 × 109/L Platelets ≥ 100 × 109/L Hemoglobin ≥ 9/g/dL ( may transfuse ) Total serum bilirubin ≤ 1.5 time upper limit normal ( ULN ) Aspartate aminotransferase ( AST/SGOT ) alanine aminotransferase ( ALT/SGPT ) ≤ 2.5 × ULN ( ≤ 5 × ULN liver metastasis present ) Serum creatinine ≤ 1.5 x ULN estimate creatinine clearance ≥ 50 mL/min calculate use CockcroftGault ( CG ) equation Archival tissue [ paraffin block ( ) unstained slide paraffin block ( ) ] primary tumor and/or metastatic site judge reasonably available prior initiating treatment , willingness undergo fresh pretreatment tumor biopsy . ( Prior initiating treatment , screen team must documentation archival fresh tumor specimen request local outside facility . However , physical possession request tissue wait histological analysis confirmation acquire specimen contains tumor tissue sufficient analysis requirement prior initiate treatment . ) If archival tissue available patient consent fresh biopsy , patient 's lesion deem inaccessible safe biopsy , patient allow enroll otherwise eligible . Female patient childbearing potential male patient able father child female partner childbearing potential must agree use least two method acceptable contraception 15 day prior first trial treatment administration least 60 day study participant 's final dose avelumab . Females childbearing potential define surgically sterile postmenopausal ( i.e . patient bilateral tubal ligation , bilateral oophorectomy , complete hysterectomy ; amenorrheic 12 month without alternative medical cause ) . Postmenopausal status females 55 year age confirm serum folliclestimulating hormone ( FSH ) level within laboratory reference range postmenopausal woman . Male patient able father child define surgically sterile ( i.e . patient vasectomy ) . Serum pregnancy test ( female childbearing potential ) negative screening . Reenrollment subject discontinue study pretreatment screen failure ( i.e . consent patient receive avelumab ) permit . If reenrolled , subject must reconsented . Only screen procedure perform outside protocolspecified timing must repeat . Prior therapy antibody drug specifically target T cell regulatory protein , include limited : Prior immunotherapy IL2 IFNα , antiPD1 ( include nivolumab ) , antiPDL1 , antiPDL2 , antiCD137 , anticytotoxic Tlymphocyteassociated antigen4 ( CTLA4 ) antibody ( include ipilimumab ) , antibody drug specifically target Tcell costimulation checkpoint pathway . Within 28 day first dose avelumab : Anticancer treatment , major surgery require general anesthesia , use investigational agent . Within 14 day first dose avelumab : Therapeutic palliative radiation therapy . ( Subjects receive bisphosphonate denosumab eligible provide treatment initiate least 14 day first dose avelumab . ) Within 7 day first dose avelumab : Use corticosteroid immunosuppressive medication exclusionary , except follow absence active autoimmune disease : Subjects permit use corticosteroid minimal systemic absorption ( e.g . topical , ocular , intraarticular , intranasal , inhaled ) ; Systemic corticosteroid physiologic dos ≤10 mg/day prednisone equivalent permit ; Adrenal replacement steroid dose include dos &gt; 10 mg daily prednisone permit ; A brief ( le 3 week ) course corticosteroid prophylaxis ( e.g . CT scan premedication contrast dye allergy ) treatment nonautoimmune condition ( e.g . delayedtype hypersensitivity reaction cause contact allergen ) permit . Previous malignant disease adenocarcinoma small intestine within last 5 year , exception basal squamous cell carcinoma skin cervical carcinoma situ consider curatively treat ( i.e . complete remission achieve least 2 year prior first dose avelumab AND additional therapy require receiving study treatment ) . All subject brain metastasis , expect meeting follow criterion : Brain metastasis treat locally clinically stable least 2 week prior enrollment No ongoing neurological symptom relate brain localization disease ( sequelae consequence treatment brain metastasis acceptable . Subjects must either steroid stable decrease dose ≤ 10 mg daily prednisone ( equivalent ) Receipt organ transplantation include allogeneic stemcell transplantation . Significant acute chronic infection include , among others : Known history test positive human immunodeficiency virus ( HIV ) , acquire immunodeficiency syndrome ( AIDS ) . Positive test hepatitis B virus ( HBV ) surface antigen and/or confirmatory hepatitis C virus ( HCV ) RNA ( antiHCV antibody test positive ) . Active autoimmune disease reasonable possibility clinically significant deterioration receive immunostimulatory agent : Subjects Type 1 diabetes mellitus , vitiligo , psoriasis , hypo hyperthyroid disease require immunosuppressive treatment eligible . Subjects require hormone replacement corticosteroid eligible steroid administer purpose hormonal replacement dos ≤ 10 mg 10 mg equivalent prednisone per day . Administration steroids route know result minimal systemic exposure ( topical , intranasal , introocular , inhalation ) acceptable . Interstitial lung disease symptomatic may interfere detection management suspect drugrelated pulmonary toxicity . Uncontrolled asthma [ define 3 follow feature partially control asthma within 28 day prior start study treatment : Daytime symptom twice per week , limitation activity , nocturnal symptoms/awaking , need reliever/rescue inhaler twice per week , know lung function ( PEF FEV1 ) without administration bronchodilator &lt; 80 % predict personal best ( know ) ] . Current symptomatic congestive heart failure ( New York Heart Association &gt; class II ) , unstable cardiac arrhythmia require therapy ( e.g . medication pacemaker ) , unstable angina ( e.g . new , worsening persistent chest discomfort ) , uncontrolled hypertension ( systolic &gt; 160 mmHg diastolic &gt; 100mmHg ) . Or follow occur within 6 month ( 180 day ) prior first dose avelumab : Myocardial infarction , coronary/peripheral artery bypass graft , cerebrovascular accident transient ischemic attack . ( Use antihypertensive medication control blood pressure allow . ) Concurrent treatment nonpermitted drug . Requirement anticoagulant therapy oral vitamin K antagonists Coumadin ( warfarin ) . Lowdose anticoagulant maintenance patency central venous access device prevention deep vein thrombosis pulmonary embolism allow . Therapeutic use low molecular weight heparin allow . Persisting toxicity relate prior therapy reduce Grade 1 [ National Cancer Institute Common Toxicity Criteria Adverse Events ( NCI CTCAE ) version 4.03 ; however , alopecia sensory neuropathy Grade ≤ 2 acceptable . Known severe ( Grade ≥ 3 NCICTCAE ) hypersensitivity reaction monoclonal antibody , history anaphylaxis . Vaccination within 28 day first dose avelumab trial prohibit , except administration inactivate vaccine ( example , inactivate influenza vaccine ) . Pregnant breastfeeding female . Known alcohol drug abuse . Prisoners subject involuntarily incarcerate . Known psychiatric condition , social circumstance , medical condition reasonably judge patient 's study physician unacceptably increase risk study participation ; prohibit understanding rendering informed consent anticipate compliance schedule visit , treatment schedule , laboratory test study requirement .</criteria>
