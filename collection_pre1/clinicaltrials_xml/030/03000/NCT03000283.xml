	<brief_summary>The goal study preliminarily determine/estimate feasibility whether frequent early conivaptan use , dose currently determine safe ( i.e. , 40mg/day ) , safe well-tolerated patient cerebral edema intracerebral hemorrhage ( ICH ) pressure ( ICP ) . A goal preliminarily estimate whether conivaptan dose reduce cerebral edema ( CE ) patient . This study also essential first step understanding role conivaptan CE management . Hypothesis : The frequent early use conivaptan 40mg/day safe well-tolerated , also reduce cerebral edema , patient intracerebral hemorrhage pressure .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Conivaptan Reduction Cerebral Edema Intracerebral Hemorrhage- A Safety Tolerability Study</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This single-center , open-label , safety tolerability study . Based finding literature animal research clinical observation ICH ( intracerebral hemorrhage ) associate TBI ( traumatic brain injury ) , study begin look safety , tolerability , well potential effectiveness , conivaptan reduce CE ( cerebral edema ) patient non-traumatic ICH . The seven patient study receive 40mg/day study medication conivaptan . In early phase study , focus assess safety tolerability medication . The available clinical data conivaptan neurocritical care population suggest potential harm negligible . Data TBI patient demonstrate conivaptan safe well tolerate use single dose ( 20mg ) increase Na+ control fashion reduce ICP . Previous work demonstrate safety tolerability conivaptan , dose range 20-80mg/day , neurocritical care population . Conivaptan demonstrate safe effective lowering ICP , increase serum sodium , neurocritical care population . Also note improvement cerebral perfusion pressure ( CPP ) stable blood pressure , prolong reduction ICP . Finally , method intermittent bolus dose conivaptan equally effective raise maintain serum sodium neurocritical care population continuous infusion , potentially less risk adverse reaction include phlebitis . Conivaptan , non-selective Arginine-Vasopressin ( AVP ) V1A/V2 antagonist reduces aquaporin 4 production promotes aquaresis , approve treatment euvolemic hypervolemic hyponatremia . The exact cause observe reduction ICP conivaptan uncertain . However , mechanism likely represent combination acute pure aquaresis , remove free water brain tissue , sustain regulation aquaporin 4 abate/slow development CE . The V2 antagonism conivaptan promotes free water loss , V1 antagonism may improve cerebral blood flow ( CBF ) reduce blood brain barrier permeability . Notably , serum sodium tend correlate inversely ICP CE . The early use conivaptan could potentially use clinically reduce CE mean . It mind , research team feel justify pursue study hope data obtain lead potential good removal harm future patient devastate disease . Given enormous cost ICH , problem current therapy , variability treatment , urgent need identify therapy good safety effectiveness profile compare currently use agent . This study use dose ( 40mg/day ) currently approve . Further , give primary purpose use medication study correct hyponatremia , investigational new drug ( IND ) application FDA submit , study determine exempt . Our central hypothesis reduction aquaporin-4 ( AQP4 ) expression , early use conivaptan reduce CE also safe patient . Our long term goal show early use conivaptan ICH reduce CE . If reduction possible , hypothesize improved outcome reduce need rescue therapy , ICU length stay , overall treatment cost follow . However , data need evaluate dosing amount drug . With respect conivaptan 's efficacy correction hyponatremia , direct dose-response relationship exist . Further , effect note mild degree hyponatremia .</detailed_description>
