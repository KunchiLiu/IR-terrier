	<brief_title>Motorized Spiral Colonoscopy Trial : A First Feasibility Trial</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Colonoscopy widely accept diagnosis treatment colon disease . Properly perform , colonoscopy generally safe , accurate , well-tolerated . Diagnostic colonoscopy prefer method evaluate colon patient large-bowel symptom , iron deficiency anemia , abnormal result radiographic study colon , positive result colorectal cancer ( CRC ) screening test , post-polypectomy post-cancer resection surveillance , diagnosis surveillance inflammatory bowel disease . In addition , colonoscopy introduce CRC screen Western country e.g . United States Germany . Recent trial show screen colonoscopy large potential prevention early detection colorectal cancer . Diagnostic colonoscopy usually combine endoscopic resection small medium size polyp flat neoplastic lesion . Patients large lesion detect diagnostic colonoscopy usually reschedule therapeutic colonoscopy appropriate setting . Quality parameter colonoscopy recently report . In term intraprocedural indicator cecal intubation rate ≥ 90 % case colonoscopy widely accept . Even experienced endoscopists classify 10 % colonoscopy difficult intubation cecum may impossible . A recent study evaluate efficacy safety repeat colonoscopy 520 patient prior incomplete colonoscopy . Reasons failure complete colonoscopy refer institution `` looping/redundant colon '' 53.8 % case , `` sigmoid fixation/angulation '' 38.8 % , `` sigmoid angulation loop colon '' 5.8 % case . Issues sedation cause failure 1.5 % patient . Conventional colonoscopy difficult particular anatomical variation push endoscope tend form loop limit advancement tip instrument . Techniques like alternate push pull endoscope external compression abdomen use overcome limitation . Loop formation stretch colon adjacent mesenterium well external compression inconvenient even painful patient . In addition maneuver prolong procedural duration . We recently compare use ultrathin colonoscopy standard colonoscope randomize trial term cecal intubation rate , level sedation , amount propofol need sedation , number external compression , pain score patient satisfaction parameter . The result indicate parameter well use evaluation new technique colonoscopy . Spiral assist endoscopy base completely different concept advance endoscope pleat bowel instrumentation shaft rotation . This technique widely use antegrade enteroscopy . For purpose manually rotatable overtube use thin flexible enteroscope insert . The distal end overtube contains raise spiral thread pleat small intestine overtube . By manually rotate spiral element bowel pleat onto overtube , allow operator access visualize distal portion small intestine . Spiral assist endoscopy also approve evaluated retrograde enteroscopy via anal route . It promise advantage intubation cecum terminal ileum principle pleat least part colon consecutive shortening less loop formation . These effect reduce need external compression may cause less pain patient . In addition , spiral stabilize position colonoscope advantageous careful examination target intervention . Spiral overtube-assisted colonoscopy achieve success rate cecal intubation 92 % 24 patient conventional colonoscopy fail . However conventional spiral endoscopy cumbersome use require assistance second endoscopist appropriate use . The Novel Motorized Spiral Endoscope represent new technology offer advantageous option spiral-assisted endoscopy fast less invasive approach . The system similar currently market endoscope incorporate flexible insertion tube , light source , digital imaging , channel pass accessory sample collection therapeutic intervention . The system unique incorporate user-controlled motor contain endoscope 's handle rotate spiral cuff locate endoscope 's insertion tube . Rotation cuff , soft spiral-shaped `` fin '' , pleat colon endoscope 's insertion tube , thereby allow rapid atraumatic access colon . The system also include display monitor , motor control unit , device display measure motor current signal torque , set foot pedal . It currently evaluate prospective study patient indication antegrade enteroscopy ( `` European Novel Motorized Spiral Endoscopy Trial ( ENMSET ) ) two center conduct study . So far 60 patient successfully examine without major adverse event . The aim study assess feasibility safety Novel Motorized Spiral Endoscope examine colon . The study conceive proof concept trial primary aim achieve cecal intubation rate least 90 % accord quality guideline recommendation . All clinically relevant quality parameter standard colonoscopy evaluate secondary aim comparable recent trial . This study represent first clinical evaluation use motorized spiral assist endoscope examination colon potential advantage patient term effectiveness convenience colonoscopy .</detailed_description>
