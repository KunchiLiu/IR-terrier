	<detailed_description>Background : Frail Veterans increase risk poor surgical outcome . Although surgeon operate safely even old old , elder also frail , stress surgery result significant mortality , morbidity , institutionalization . Frailty clinical syndrome mark muscle atrophy , diminish strength , decreased physical activity , exhaustion . It independent specific disease , increase age , powerful predictor increase perioperative mortality , morbidity , length stay , cost prediction base age comorbidity alone . As Veteran US population grow old frail , critically important identify effective strategy improve surgical outcome patient . `` Prehabilitation '' potential improve surgical outcome among frail . Prior research demonstrate inter-disciplinary rehabilitation strategy deploy surgery enhance recovery improve outcome build strength , improve nutrition , optimize home support . Based success , grow interest deploy similar intervention surgery call `` prehabilitation . '' By modify physiological environmental risk , prehabilitation aim augment patient ' capacity compensate stress surgery recovery . Frail patient likely benefit disproportionately prehabilitation diminish capacity adapt stress surgery . However , prehabilitation yet study either Veteran specifically frail population . Objectives : We examine feasibility novel , multifaceted pre-habilitation intervention aim improve postoperative outcome frail Veterans undergo major abdominal surgery . Specific aim : 1 . Estimate rate recruitment , randomization , retention , compliance prehabilitation intervention ; 2 . Measure ( ) physical performance , ( b ) pulmonary function , ( c ) nutrition baseline 2-week interval estimate change time explore optimal duration prehabilitation ( 2 vs. 4 vs. 6 week ) ; 3 . Estimate overall treatment-specific summary statistic postoperative outcome term 30- 90-day ( ) mortality , ( b ) major complication , ( c ) length hospital stay , ( ) health-related quality life , ( e ) quality surgical care , ( f ) change level independent living . Methods : This randomize pilot study enroll consecutive cohort 50 Veterans identify frail use standardize frailty assessment schedule major abdominal surgery general urological surgery service VA Pittsburgh Healthcare System . We randomize participant 1:1 receive either : ( 1 ) standard preoperative optimization Interdisciplinary Medical Preoperative Assessment Consultation &amp; Treatment Clinic ( IMPACT ) , ( 2 ) prehabilitation + standard IMPACT optimization . The 6-week long prehabilitation intervention include ( 1 ) strength balance training ; ( 2 ) inspiratory muscle training ; ( 3 ) nutritional coaching supplementation . Assessments include standard postoperative outcome well Short Physical Performance Battery measure physical performance , Maximal Inspiratory Pressure measure pulmonary function , prealbumin 7-point Subjective Global Assessment measure nutrition . Outcomes assess 30 90 day surgery . Compliance prehabilitation regimen assess patient logs pedometer . Analyses inform development large randomize control trial test prehabilitation intervention . Findings relevant many 42,000 frail Veterans schedule major elective surgery year .</detailed_description>
