	<brief_summary>The purpose study identify predictor future injury disability follow LPD . The investigator ' long term goal improve longitudinal outcome athletes LPD follow surgical non-surgical management . Currently , limited information available clinician regard appropriate criterion return athlete sport participation follow LPD . The evidence produce study provide necessary information develop appropriate rehabilitation strategy may reduce risk future patellar instability associate patellofemoral joint dysfunction pain .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Clinical Outcomes Following Patellar Dislocation Young Athletes</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The basis propose study determine clinical outcome follow lateral patellar dislocation ( LPD ) . Despite surgical non-surgical intervention , young athlete high risk sustain subsequent dislocation magnify effect disability . It suspect athlete return high-level activity expose knee substantial force without normalized movement strategy , may increase risk future joint injury . Currently , evidence-based criterion determine athlete 's readiness sport activity follow LPD . The purpose study characterize clinical outcome , function , neuromuscular control strategy employ athlete follow LPD time return sport participation . A prospective , longitudinal study design utilize . A cohort 100 athlete ( age 12 - 25 year ) sustain LPD sport activity require jumping , cut , pivot maneuver consecutively recruit office local orthopaedic surgeon , primary care physician , sport physical therapist study . Investigators target subset surgically manage athlete subset non-surgically manage athlete LPD . A cohort 100 individual without history knee injury recruit local school university serve control participant . Data collect evaluate clinical outcome , thigh hip strength , low body function , balance neuromuscular control strategy . Clinical outcome assess use self-report questionnaire performance-based measure , include hop agility test . Thigh hip strength assess utilizing isokinetic dynamometer . Lower body function assess use series single-leg double-leg hopping test . Balance assess utilizing clinical low extremity reach test . Neuromuscular control evaluate 3-D motion analysis run , jumping , cut activity . Overall , study provide comprehensive evaluation athlete follow LPD . It provide important information future development rehabilitation approach may maximize clinical outcome risk population .</detailed_description>
