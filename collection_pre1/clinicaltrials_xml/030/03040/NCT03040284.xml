	<brief_summary>In patient risk increase intracranial pressure ( ICP ) , ICP measurement require invasive transducer , usually insertion catheter cranium , spinal tap . These invasive modality involve risk pain do specialized care unit , high associate cost . A novel method detecting change ICP develop recently . The auditory hair cell emit sound electric signal response sound , easily detect measure non-invasively help microphone probe place external ear canal regular electrode . Indeed , cochlear aqueduct connects cerebrospinal fluid ( CSF ) space inner ear way ICP inner-ear fluid pressure equalize within second . The evaluation intracranial hypertension increase ICP ( invasive ) systematically use aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage . It detect use routine clinical sign hydrocephalus another disorder cerebrospinal liquid flow , combination standard image method ( TDM ) . The measurement noninvasive ICP could allow early detection hydrocephalus another disorder cerebrospinal liquid flow , evaluate whether increase ICP precede patient clinical worsen / imaging .</brief_summary>
