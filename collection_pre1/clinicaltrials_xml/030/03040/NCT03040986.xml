	<brief_title>Selumetinib Sulfate Treating Patients With Locally Advanced Metastatic Pancreatic Cancer With KRAS G12R Mutations</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . Determine objective response rate selumetinib sulfate ( selumetinib ) administer 100 mg orally twice daily continuous schedule patient advance pancreas cancer harbor KRAS G12R mutation . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . To determine progression free survival patient locally advance , unresectable stage IV pancreas cancer treat selumetinib monotherapy . II . To evaluate safety selumetinib patient advance pancreas cancer . III . To determine impact additional genetic alteration response selumetinib pancreas cancer harbor KRAS G12R mutation . IV . To develop clinically applicable biomarker predict response selumetinib pancreas cancer harbor KRAS G12R mutation . OUTLINE : Patients receive selumetinib sulfate orally ( PO ) twice daily ( BID ) . Treatment repeat every 28 day 27 course absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . After completion study treatment , patient follow every 2 month 52 week .</detailed_description>
