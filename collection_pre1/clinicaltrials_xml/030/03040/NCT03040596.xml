	<brief_title>The Effect Inhaled Corticosteroids Vocal Fold Nodules Children</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Voice disorder common communication disorder across lifespan , affect 5 million school-aged child annually United States . Vocal fold nodule frequent pathology affect voice child , 21 % child negatively influence give point time , result negative quality life consequence inferior academic performance . The traditional first-line approach treatment vocal fold nodule voice therapy Speech-Language Pathology , although corticosteroid often implement conjunction voice therapy reduce focal inflammation lesion site . Operating room procedures traditional method administer corticosteroid lesion site , although recent advance office-based laryngeal steroid injection become widely popular alternative reduce lesion size . Unfortunately , although in-office injection favorable operate room procedure , due less invasive nature , in-office procedure still invasive alternative pediatric population . Specifically , involve equipment may intimidate child require child remain still prolong period time , may feasible child . Furthermore , focal vocal fold injection still involve potential adverse effect vocal fold hematoma . To mediate concern , short course inhaled corticosteroid may safe non-invasive alternative reduce inflammation lesion size within larynx . The goal present study determine safety feasibility short-course inhaled corticosteroid addition standard voice therapy treat vocal fold nodule . The study also aim examine effect inhale corticosteroid quality life outcomes acoustic aerodynamic outcome .</detailed_description>
