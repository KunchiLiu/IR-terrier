	<brief_title>Pentoxifylline Tocopherol ( PENTO ) Treatment Medication-related Osteonecrosis Jaw ( MRONJ )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>HYPOTHESES HA : Among patient MRONJ , 12 month treatment PENTO , area expose bone PENTO group different area expose bone standard therapy group . H0 : Among patient MRONJ , 12 month treatment PENTO , area expose bone PENTO group equal area expose bone standard therapy group . SPECIFIC AIMS To determine PENTO regimen addition standard care treatment MRONJ significantly reduce area expose bone compare standard care alone . Standard care define clinical guideline 2014 AAOMS Position Paper Medication-Related Osteonecrosis Jaw ( MRONJ ) 1 . Challenges : Identifying patient Stage 1 , 2 , 3 MRONJ compliant therapy available follow-up . Measuring great anterior-posterior superior-inferior dimension calculate area . Ensuring patient safety interim analysis appropriate stop protocol . 2 . Approach : The investigator treat patient Stage 1 , 2 , 3 MRONJ either PENTO adjunct standard care standard care alone placebo . Impact : &gt; 6 million patient US risk MRONJ . If prove successfully treat MRONJ , trial would establish non-operative treatment option successful management MRONJ potential significant decrease morbidity patient . SAMPLE The sample derive population patient present participate trial site management MRONJ trial 's enrollment period . To included trial patient must meet criterion list . If patient exclude trial reason document study 's record well basic demographic data , MRONJ staging , risk medication , indication use antiresorptive antiangiogenic medication area expose bone collect . RANDOMIZATION A stratified permuted-block randomization use allocate patient treatment . This method ensure balance allocation achieve approximately preset treatment allocation ratio 1:1 avoids predictability future assignment . Strata construct prognostic variable initial MRONJ stage ( 1,2,3 ) antiresorptive therapy ( bisphosphonate vs. denosumab/RANK-L inhibitor ) . Within stratum , block size 2 4 used randomize patient PENTO + standard care standard care placebo alone randomization treatment sequence meet 1:1 allocation ratio within block . A computer-generated list random allocation prepare stratum . The allocation sequence conceal researcher enrol assess participant sequentially number , opaque , seal stapled envelope . Corresponding envelope open enrolled participant complete DATA MANAGEMENT AND ANALYSIS The primary analysis interest association treatment group area expose bone . The primary analysis repeat measure analysis variance ( ANOVA ) one within subject ( time ) factor one subject ( treatment ) factor complete A = area base upon Dap Dsi geometric shape lesion . If outcomes meet assumption non-parametric analogue use . SAMPLE SIZE ESTIMATE alpha = 0.05 , beta = 0.10 , Anticipated drop-out rate = 30 % A stratified permuted- block randomization use allocate patient treatment . Intention treat include subject randomize treatment ( detailed page 3 application ) . If patient drop withdraw prior 12-month treatment endpoint , last observation carry forward ( LOCF ) include analysis . In addition , patient `` treat '' ( patient receive incorrect treatment ) `` protocol '' ( n't include patient dropout withdrawal ) analyze evaluate effectiveness treatment . To detect relative change primary outcome ≥20 % parameter , minimum sample 44 patient study arm require ( total n=88 ) . The investigator deem improvement ≥20 % intervention group compare control group decrease bone exposure clinically significant . There consensus current literature clinically significant difference control treatment arm . However , study power outcomes expect base current literature , difference 50 % arm would require 7 patient per arm . Therefore investigator believe study overpower ensure statistical analysis would remain significant suspected success PENTO regimen true . STOPPING RULES Because investigational use pentoxifylline benefit PENTO MRONJ presently establish , interim analysis ( p=.001 ) perform 3 6 month . If trial stop interim analysis proven benefit , trial convert open trial patient follow entire 12-month treatment period , achieve complete mucosal coverage . Patient withdrawal study criterion include : - A serious adverse event relate trial medication . - Patient becomes pregnant . - Any relevant deterioration health subject ( AEs , vital sign , ECG , laboratory parameter ) . - Clinically relevant change vital sign technical failure OVERSIGHT RESPONSIBILITIES Oversight trial provide Principal Investigator ( PI ) Dr. Dillon Co- Investigators ( Co-I ) Dr. Petrisor , Dr. Ruggiero , Dr. Morlandt , Dr. Ward . MONITORING PROCEDURES Drs . Dillon , Ruggiero , Petrisor , Morlandt , Ward assure inform consent obtain prior perform research procedure , subject meet eligibility criterion , study conduct accord IRB-approved research plan . Blinded study data accessible time PI Co-investigators review . All five investigator review study conduct include accrual , drop-outs , protocol deviation quarterly basis . In addition , investigator review adverse event ( AEs ) individually real-time aggregate monthly basis . Last , investigator review serious adverse event ( SAEs ) , dose limit toxicity , specific intervention complication real-time . The PI ensure protocol deviation , AEs , SAEs report FDA , DSMB IRB accord applicable regulatory requirement . COLLECTION AND REPORTING OF SAEs AND AEs For study , follow standard AE definition use : Adverse event ( AE ) : Any unfavorable unintended sign ( include abnormal laboratory find ) , symptom disease temporally associate use medical treatment procedure , regardless whether consider related medical treatment procedure . Serious Adverse Event : Any AE result follow outcome : - Death - Life-threatening - Event require inpatient hospitalization prolongation exist hospitalization - Persistent significant disability/incapacity AEs grade accord follow scale : - Mild : An experience transient &amp; require special treatment intervention . - Moderate : An experience alleviate simple therapeutic treatment . - Severe : An experience require therapeutic intervention . The experience interrupt usual daily activity . The study use follow AE attribution scale : - Not relate : The AE clearly relate study - Possibly relate : An event follow reasonable temporal sequence initiation study procedure , could readily produce number factor . - Related : The AE clearly relate study procedure . SAEs specific procedure-associated AEs report University Washington IRB DSMB within 24 hour . In addition , AEs report accord University Washington IRB AE report guideline . MANAGEMENT OF RISKS TO SUBJECTS Expected AEs associate Pentoxifylline Tocopherol include : Dizziness , headache , nausea , vomit , indigestion , flushing , angina , palpitation , hypersensitivity , itchiness , rash , hive , bleeding , hallucination , arrhythmia , aseptic meningitis AE Management If unanticipated problem relate research involve risk subject others happen course study ( include SAEs ) report IRB accordance University Washington Human Subjects Division ( HSD ) protocols DSMB . AEs serious notable could involve risk subject summarize narrative format submit IRB DSMB time continue review . DATA SAFETY AND MONITORING ( DSMB ) ANALYSIS PLAN The Analysis safety ( AEs ) conduct minimum 3 6 month . However , depend upon recruitment analysis safety follow : 10 , 20 , 30 , 40 , 60 , 80 , 100 patient complete 3 month follow . Patient withdrawal criterion include : - A serious adverse event relate trial medication . - Patient becomes pregnant . - Any relevant deterioration health subject ( AEs , vital sign , ECG , laboratory parameter ) . - Clinically relevant change vital sign technical failure exclude result confirm least 1 additional measurement . PLAN FOR DATA MANAGEMENT Compliance regulatory document study data accuracy completeness maintain internal study team quality assurance process . Confidentiality throughout trial maintain previously describe study-specific confidentiality procedure . DATA store de-identified REDCap database password protect accessible study member . INFORMED CONSENT/ETHICAL CONSIDERATIONS Quality integrity research ensure data safety monitoring informed patient consent participation . Enrollment do study coordinator site participate surgeon . Other UW study coordinator coordinator research student participate trial . The research independent impartial , key study personnel directly involve patient care blind treatment . Informed consent obtain patient state overall purpose study , alternative participation , direct indirect risks/benefits participation . All patient literature consent write 8th grade read level . The confidentiality anonymity research respondents patient health information respect . IRB approval obtain study site prior begin research activity . The individual study site IRBs determine appropriate pursue expand access Investigational</detailed_description>
