	<brief_summary>The main purpose study determine whether electroconvulsive therapy ( ECT ) cause structural functional brain change thus indicate mechanism action . The second aim find predictor immediate response , sustain remission , relapse side-effects . Thirdly , study aim explore whether ECT cause change blood-brain barrier permeability whether change correlate memory problem . The fourth objective examine whether ECT cause brain tissue damage .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Exploring Effects Electroconvulsive Therapy Human Brain Depression - The Danish ECT/MRI Study</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>ECT effective treatment depression decade . Despite , neither mechanism action side-effects fully elucidate . The reason patient relapse shortly remission still completely understood . Thus , need find predictor favourable clinical effect , relapse side-effects . ECT consider professional safe procedure . However , view base rather old small study . Additionally , many patient consent treatment fear permanent loss memory contract brain damage complete ECT series . Therefore , important examine whether ECT might negative effect structure function brain , use state art Magnetic Resonance Imaging ( MRI ) techniques great study population . The study consist 60 inpatient , diagnose depression , admit one recruit Mental Health Centres , schedule ECT . The modern MRI sequence examine brain structure function use 3 time point : baseline ( ECT series ) , second examination ( ECT series ) third ( follow-up ) examination ( 6 month ECT series ) . Blood sample ( measurement Brain-Derived Neurotrophic Factor - BDNF , Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor - VEGF along marker brain injury - S100B-protein ) evaluation clinical effect side-effects ECT perform time point . The study 4 main hypothesis . The first hypothesis assumes immediate sustain response ECT predict combine neuroimaging finding blood-samples result . The second hypothesis base assumption ECT modulate microstructure connectivity fronto-limbic pathway ( FLPs ) modulation correlate clinical effect . Thus , alter microstructure FLPs depression normalise ECT series . Furthermore , depression-associated increase rest state connectivity FLPs normalise ECT . The third hypothesis ECT induce change blood-brain barrier ( BBB ) permeability , correlate severity memory problem . The last hypothesis assumes ECT cause brain tissue damage ( include brain atrophy white matter lesion - WMLs ) .</detailed_description>
