	<brief_summary>To test hypothesis preoperative injection along levator ani muscle pudendal nerve bupivacaine dexamethasone improve pain control vaginal apical reconstructive surgery . A three-arm , double-blinded , randomize control trial total 75 woman perform . The study population adult woman ( &gt; 18 year age ) uterovaginal vaginal vault prolapse schedule native tissue vaginal reconstructive surgery include apical support procedure . Participants enrol prior surgery . The procedure involve four injection site : bilateral levator ani muscle via transobturator approach bilateral pudendal nerve via transvaginal approach . Random assignment occur one three study arm : combine arm ( 20 milliliter bupivacaine/dexamethasone solution divide 4 injection site ) , bupivacaine arm ( 20 milliliter bupivacaine divide 4 injection site ) , placebo arm ( 20 milliliter saline divide 4 injection site ) .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The primary purpose three arm , randomize clinical trial test hypothesis preoperative injection along levator ani muscle pudendal nerve bupivacaine dexamethasone improve pain control vaginal native tissue apical reconstructive surgery . Hypothesis : concurrent bilateral transobturator levator ani muscle injection transvaginal pudendal nerve block bupivacaine dexamethasone perform prior vaginal apical support procedure result improve pain score 24 hour postoperatively . Participants randomize three arm : bupivacaine/dexamethasone group , bupivacaine group , placebo group . Block randomization occur stratify surgery type ensure similar number procedure randomize study arm . All 3 group receive pudendal nerve block transobturator levator ani muscle injection outline detail ( either bupivacaine/dexamethasone , bupivacaine alone saline depend randomization ) . The intervention perform participant position lithotomy position sterile preparation vagina perineum per standard protocol . These injection perform start procedure prior vaginal repair administer either attend surgeon urogynecology fellow . After intervention , vaginal reconstructive procedure perform usual attending surgeon surgical team . There fellows resident participate vaginal reconstructive surgery , however study purpose , resident physician permit administer either pudendal nerve block transobturator injection . There four attend surgeon four fellow physician administer injection . While surgeon familiar anatomy perform procedure , physician instruct intended procedure additionally directly observe operating room least one procedure ensure consistency technique . All participant undergo standardize general anesthesia regimen . After study intervention , participant undergo schedule vaginal reconstructive procedure standard . Infiltration vaginal epithelium lidocaine common vaginal repair . The maximum dos lidocaine bupivacaine additive . The amount local infiltration 50 milliliter 0.5 % lidocaine epinephrine . This dose equal 250mg lidocaine , also take account 50mg bupivacaine , within safe dose range participant weigh 50kg . Administration four injection involve study protocol described take approximately 5 additional minute total start case . After injection perform , intervention . Other assessment perform part study protocol outline : Baseline assessment : Pain assessment , assessment presence baseline nausea vomiting , baseline activity assessment perform preoperative area day surgery prior randomization . Postoperative pain score assessment : 3 hour , 24 hour , 48 hour , 72 hour , 1 week postoperatively . Postoperative pain measure numerical rating scale ( NRS ) . The NRS publicly available pain assessment tool consist eleven point scale range 0 10 ( 0 = pain 10 = worst possible pain ) present visually horizontal line . Participants ask report number mark scale . Previous study demonstrate reliability , validity ease administration . The NRS choose systematic review article demonstrate high compliance rate , good responsiveness ease use relative visual analog scale . Additionally , NRS show strong validity low error rate use elderly ( &gt; 60 year ) postoperative patient population . Postoperative nausea vomit assessment : 3 hour postoperatively The intensity postoperative nausea vomiting ( PONV ) use PONV Intensity scale . The PONV scale four question assessment design measure clinically significant nausea vomit . It initially validate general surgery population validate early postoperative gynecology patient . Clinically important nausea vomit define score great equal 50 . This scale take approximately 1 minute complete publicly available . The amount inpatient anti-emetic consumption also assess . Any anti-emetic administer surgery end time record well dosage . Anti-emetic type dosage record time discharge . Voiding status time foley catheter removal . All patient routinely assessment void function prior discharge . Whether participant pass fail void trial surgery record database . If participant fails , standard care discharge home learn self-catheterization foley catheter . In event participant fail postoperative void trial , whether participant receive foley catheter perform self-catheterization record . As routine part postoperative care , research protocol interfere performance outcome void trial . Results document , however specific assessment tool use . Time resume normal activity measure activity assessment scale ( AAS ) : 1 week , 2 week , 6 week 12 week postoperatively The AAS initially design assess functional activity perioperative period general surgery population . It since deem valid reliable measure assess postoperative activity level Female Pelvic Medicine Reconstructive Surgery patient population . It ability measure perioperative function take approximately 3-5 minute complete . It consist 13 item questionnaire assess various type physical activity degree difficulty associate activity . The types activity assess fall three subscales : sedentary activity ( question 1-4 ) , ambulatory activity ( question 6-8 ) , work exercise activity ( question 11-13 ) . Respondents also option indicate activity perform another indication ( item score ) . The time frame question previous 24 hour . Given many patient instructed avoid strenuous work exercise activity postoperative period , subscales sedentary activity ambulatory activity , patient encourage perform tolerated postoperative period , interest . Consumption analgesic medication : inpatient hospital stay first 72 hour postoperatively Narcotic consumption measure morphine equivalent . The amount narcotic obtain inpatient hospital record . All narcotic receive surgery end time time discharge include . Morphine equivalent calculate online calculator available http : //www.agencymeddirectors.wa.gov/Calculator/DoseCalculator.htm . Similarly , amount NSAIDs obtain inpatient hospital record . All NSAIDs receive surgery end time time discharge include . To assess amount narcotic NSAID consumption discharge , participant provide diary form record many daily tablet narcotic NSAIDs take . This form complete postoperative day 1-3 . For form , participant instruct mail form back office complete ( pre-address envelope provide part study ) . Participants also option brine form office time participant 's postoperative visit . Participants , physician nursing personnel involve patient care remain masked 12 week postoperatively .</detailed_description>
