	<brief_title>Pharmacokinetic Single Dose Study Oral Lasmiditan Subjects With Normal Impaired Hepatic Function</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This study enroll 24 subject include 2 hepatic impaired subject group one group control subject normal hepatic function . Approximately four subject mild hepatic impairment enrol first ( Group 1 ) . To ensure subject safety , follow dose first four subject , safety meeting take place review safety data prior dose additional subject . After safety pharmacokinetic ( PK ) result first four subject review , additional four subject mild hepatic impairment ( remainder Group 1 ) enrol concurrently moderate hepatic impairment group ( Group 2 ) . Thereafter , match subject normal hepatic function ( Group 3 ) enrol . All subject participate one treatment period receive single dose lasmiditan fast state .</detailed_description>
