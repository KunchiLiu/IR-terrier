	<brief_summary>Adolescents young adult type 1 diabetes often difficult time achieve good glucose control important reduce risk diabetes complication . Despite use multiple daily injection insulin pump glucose sensor still need many individual improve glucose level without cause low blood glucose level ( hypoglycemia ) add daily burden living diabetes . Today insulin pump receive glucose reading continuous glucose monitor adjust insulin delivery attempt keep glucose level optimal range . These system call hybrid close loop meaning much insulin delivery automate patient still interact regularly system particularly help determine insulin dose deliver cover meal . Results early study use hybrid close loop system adolescent adult type 1 diabetes encourage . This study compare FDA-approved hybrid close loop system Medtronic ( 670G ) next-generation Medtronic system program improve glucose control , particularly around mealtime , currently one big challenge hybrid close loop system . One hundred adolescent young adult ( age 14-30 ) test system three month crossover fashion . The investigator compare effective hybrid close loop system prevent high blood glucose reading day . The investigator also evaluate safety system participant adjust daily use technology .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Crossover Study Comparing Two Automated Insulin Delivery System Algorithms Adolescents Young Adults With Type 1 Diabetes</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Seven clinical site ( 4 US 3 Europe ) enroll patient type 1 diabetes ( T1D ) , age 14 less 30 year old , HbA1c 7-12 % use multiple daily injection insulin ( without continuous glucose monitoring -CGM ) use insulin pump ( without CGM ) . Participants may currently use Medtronic 670G system . All patient assess QOL attitude use diabetes management technology . - Patients glucose control current insulin treatment regimen assess 2 week use blind CGM ( CGM see glucose reading ) . - Then participant start insulin pump ( Medtronic 670G ) pump standard insulin delivery setting adjust . - Next participant start Enlite 3 continuous glucose sensor instruct use adjustment insulin pump setting make use CGM information . The pump remain usual manual mode open loop mode operation time . - All patient randomize start hybrid closed loop therapy use one two system 12 week . They either use 670G pump ( use algorithm call PID adjust insulin delivery base Enlite 3 CGM data ) open loop auto mode 3 month use different Medtronic Pump similar nature 670G slightly different algorithm call PID + Fuzzy Logic ) adjust insulin delivery base Enlite 3 CGM data open loop auto mode 3 month . Glucose control , adjustment technology safety technology carefully evaluate 3 month period participant home , school work undergo usual activity . They regular contact study team intermittently share ongoing CGM glucose data study team clinic visit upload glucose insulin data cloud view secure fashion study team . - At end 3 month participant go back 670 G CGM system manual mode open loop one month . This call washout period . - Then participant switch crossover hybrid close system originally use new hybrid close loop system close loop auto mode 3 month . - At end 3 month period either 670G system use PID algorithm new hybrid close loop system use PID + Fuzzy Logic algorithm participant rate QOL adjustment attitude toward hybrid close loop system use . - A careful analysis measure glucose control base CGM data 3 month period hybrid close loop system collect compare . In addition system safety data collect medical event study . After participant complete 3 month hybrid close loop system investigator able compare effectiveness , safety patient preference regard system .</detailed_description>
