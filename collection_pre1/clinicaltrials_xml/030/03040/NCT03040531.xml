	<detailed_description>Glucocorticoid-induced osteoporosis ( GIOP ) one primary side effect glucocorticoid use result increase risk fracture . Glucocorticoid therapy affect bone mass , glucidic lipidic metabolism , thyroid function also responsible decline cognitive function . In study natural approach use , soy-derived isoflavone , namely genistein . Genistein proven effective preserve bone mineral density post-menopausal woman , high safety profile . Genistein also able improve cardiovascular marker , well lipidic glucidic metabolism marker without interfere thyroid function . Treatment guideline use glucocorticoid establish advise prednisolone administer 5 mg per day three month long require regular monitor bone mineral density ( BMD ) treatment prevent osteoporosis must initiate ( American college Rheumatology ) . Vitamin D calcium also recommend management patient treat glucocorticoid . Bisphosphonates consider prevention treatment disorder , prevent initial loss bone mass glucocorticoid . Alendronate , risedronate , zoledronic acid show prevent reverse loss BMD glucocorticoid-induced osteoporosis great effect observe vitamin D calcium . In fact , bisphosphonates induce improvement BMD 2-fold great observe vitamin D treatment alone ( 4.6 % vs. 2.0 % , respectively ) . Anabolic therapy also use treatment glucocorticoid-induced osteoporosis . Teriparatide cause great increase BMD alendronate great reduction risk vertebral fracture . Even evidentiary clinical trial guideline , patient bone loss , general , poorly manage . In glucocorticoid-induced osteoporosis , fracture also occur high BMDs postmenopausal osteoporosis untreated woman . Consequently , guideline treatment postmenopausal osteoporosis applicable glucocorticoid-induced osteoporosis , patient treat BMD T-scores -1.0 -1.5 standard deviation . In addition , vertebral fracture may asymptomatic often require radiological diagnosis treatment . During initial phase glucocorticoid exposure bone resorption increase . Glucocorticoids inhibit formation mature osteoblast , also activate activate apoptosis cell type . Osteoprotegrin ( OPG ) expression , key factor involve modulating maturation osteoclast , reduce also glucocorticoids result increased osteoclastogenesis . Therefore , combination reduce osteoblast formation , increase osteoclast maturation lead accelerate bone loss glucocorticoid therapy . Therapies need modulate osteoclast well osteoblast activity restore normal balance bone remodel process glucocorticoid treat patient . A rational treatment glucocorticoid-induced osteoporosis combine significant anti-osteoporotic anti-fracture activity positive action several undesirable effect therapy include alteration glucose lipid metabolism , amplification cardiovascular risk , impairment thyroid cognitive function . Genistein aglycone represent innovative therapeutic bullet challenge metabolic derangement induced glucocorticoid . Among anabolic compound test recent year genistein aglycone seem promising agent able stimulate bone formation reduce bone resorption , act via genomic well non-genomic pathway . Genistein isoflavone find small quantity certain legume throughout plant kingdom . Genistein ER agonist antagonist activity different cell type work promoter specific manner gene activation via ERs . Effects genistein bone metabolism derive direct indirect action bone cell summarize stimulation osteoblastic bone formation inhibition osteoclastic bone resorption . It demonstrate genistein inhibits glucocorticoid receptor transactivation may also induce proteosomal degradation glucocorticoid receptor complex via p53 ubiquitin pathway . Another mechanism might involve genistein activity tyrosine kinase inhibitor via limitation subcellular nuclear transport recycle glucocorticoid receptor , inhibit turn effect glucocorticoids bone . In rat model , study genistein preservative effect methylprednisolone-induced bone loss osteonecrosis femoral head . In study genistein succeed prevent osteoporosis osteonecrosis femoral head co-administered glucocorticoid . The isoflavone statistically maintain bone mineral density content methylprednisolone-treated group show comparable efficacy vehicle group . Genistein co-administered methylprednisolone also statistically maintain femoral bone 's resistance rupture compare methylprednisolone group preserve normal architecture cartilage well cortical trabecular bone well-organized matrix femoral head . Besides protective effect osteoporosis , genistein show positively affect cardiovascular system reduce predictor cardiovascular risk , improve endothelial function ameliorate glucose lipid metabolism . In addition genistein possess beneficial activity central nervous system protect hippocampus injury . Regarding effect genistein thyroid function may impair glucocorticoid recent clinical trial evaluate effect three year administration pure genistein aglycone ( 54 mg/day ) thyroid-related marker , postmenopausal woman . Specifically , change thyroid hormone receptor thyroid hormone enzyme , blood level thyroid hormone thyroid auto-antibodies assess . The result research show daily consumption genistein aglycone modify circulate fT4 ( free thyroxine ) , fT3 ( free triiodothyronine ) , TSH ( thyroid-stimulating hormone ) level ; , genistein aglycone administration 3 yr affect enzyme involve thyroid hormone production , thyroid hormone auto-antibodies , expression thyroid hormone receptor confirm genistein appear alter thyroid function postmenopausal woman . Taken together clinical pre-clinical observation lead investigator hypothesize role genistein management glucocorticoid-related side effect .</detailed_description>
