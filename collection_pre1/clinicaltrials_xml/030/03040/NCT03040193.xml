	<brief_summary>Flexible bronchoscopy one widely perform procedure diagnosis various bronchopulmonary disease . Most patient tolerate procedure well although cough often report distress symptom . It likely acceptance bronchoscopy would significantly improve control cough . Use sedation bronchoscopy report improve procedure tolerance . However , awake ( sedation ) bronchoscopy routinely perform many centre include . Topical lignocaine administer bronchoscopy local anaesthesia . There limited literature efficacy lignocaine deliver nebulized route awake flexible bronchoscopy . This study would help determine utility nebulized lignocaine airway anaesthesia flexible bronchoscopy .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Nebulized Lignocaine Topical Airway Anesthesia During Flexible Bronchoscopy : A Randomized Controlled Trial</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>For patient meet inclusion criterion , demographic profile include age , sex , weight , smoke history type procedure perform bronchoscopy shall record . A write informed consent obtain participant . The patient undergo flexible bronchoscopy would randomise one one ratio either nebulized lignocaine ( 4 % ) saline ( placebo ) nebulization group . Prior bronchoscopy blood pressure , pulse rate , respiratory rate pulse oximetry saturation record baseline Patients group shall prepare similar fashion except nebulized lignocaine . Patient , Operator , outcome assessor blind allocation . During procedure , 1.5ml aliquot 1 % lignocaine deliver bronchoscope use spray-as-you go technique . The patient would monitor adverse effect throughout procedure . The bronchoscopist procedure provide 2 VAS chart mark severity cough overall procedure satisfaction . Post procedure , patient record pain experience undergoing procedure face pain rating scale .</detailed_description>
