	<brief_title>Conservative Versus Liberal Oxygenation Targets Critically Ill Children</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Around 19,000 critically ill child admit paediatric intensive care unit ( PICU ) year UK . A large number child need breathe support , usually provide invasive machine call 'ventilator ' . Clinicians make decision treatment base much oxygen patient blood ( call oxygen saturation oxygenation ) currently amount oxygen critically ill child need fully understood . This mean clinician use low oxygen saturation target , others , high target . This may problematic research neonate ( baby ) adult show oxygen saturation level influence patient 's chance survival , long stay hospital healthcare cost . Response oxygen different baby , child adult . This mean result neonatal adult research unlikely valid applicable child due age-related difference . Urgent high quality clinical evidence therefore need inform best target oxygenation critical illness child . As large clinical trial expensive conduct , important demonstrate large-scale trial do different component trial work together . Therefore , Oxy-PICU study 'pilot randomise clinical trial ' ( small version trial would like conduct ) test feasibility safety conduct large scale trial compare restrictive oxygen saturation target ( 88-92 % ) liberal oxygen saturation target ( &gt; 94 % ) . Oxy-PICU also collect blood urine sample allow depth study biology different oxygenation target . The pilot trial take place three PICUs ( two London one Southampton ) aim include 115-125 eligible child six month . Given emergency nature child need provide immediate care , inform consent seek child enter study ( know defer consent ) .</detailed_description>
