	<brief_summary>Coronary heart disease ( CHD ) lead global cause human death . Over past decade , level overall diagnosis treatment CHD greatly improve due progression clinical research development technical mean mortality CHD decrease nearly 50 % western country [ 1 ] . However , survey show improvement living standard change lifestyle , incidence CHD still rise China develop country , prevalence trend obvious young [ 2 ] . The so-called young CHD , generally refers age onset CHD less equal 45 year . Compared age-group CHD , young CHD follow characteristic : 1 . Genetic factor stronger effect young onset age , incidence obvious familial aggregation [ 3 ] ; 2 Often onset acute coronary syndrome , presumably may associate strong inflammation lesion ; 3 . Two extreme often exist coronary lesion : mild atherosclerosis severe triple-vessel disease ; 4 Rapid progression atherosclerotic lesion , stent restenosis site repeat interventional treatment , rapid progress lesion non-intervention site ; 5 Surgical mortality low regardless interventional therapy bypass surgery , rate revascularization significantly high follow 10 year .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Study method - Recruited patient meet inclusion criterion since March 2016 , collect information change risk factor , angina pre-operation , mode onset , characteristic coronary artery , morbility treatment , clinical follow-up ; ② Collect follow information clinical case : gender , age , history hypertension , history diabetes , cholesterol level , triglyceride level , sedentary , body index , family history CHD , genotype ALDH2 MTHFR , history myocardial infarction , coronary artery lesion operation situation ; ③ The follow-up perform clinic telephone every half one year . The detail include whether recurrence angina , main symptom , cause attack , lasting time , efficacy take nitroglycerin , whether perform electrocardiography examination , whether occur myocardial infarction attack site . whether performed interventional therapy CABG surgery cause surgery , whether re-examined coronary arteriongraphy , whether death cause , occur date event ; ④ Analysis pathogenic intensity risk factor age group CHD . 3.2 Study population 3.2.1 inclusion criterion Young CHD group : - Below equal 45 year age ; ② Patients suffer stable latent coronary heart disease , unstable angina , non-ST segment elevation myocardial infarction ST segment elevation myocardial infarction diagnose coronary angiography coronary CT scan ; ③ Signed inform consent form . Non-young CHD group - Below equal 45 year age ; ② Patients suffer stable latent coronary heart disease , unstable angina , non-ST segment elevation myocardial infarction ST segment elevation myocardial infarction diagnose Coronary angiography coronary CT scan ; ③ Risk factor gender , high cholesterol , high blood pressure , overweight , diabetes , smoking , homocysteine level match inclusion criterion 1 subject enrol . ④ Signed inform consent form Young non-coronary heart disease - Below equal 45 year age ; ② Patients confirm rule stable latent coronary heart disease , unstable angina , non-ST segment elevation myocardial infarction ST segment elevation myocardial infarction diagnose Coronary angiography coronary CT scan ; ③ Signed Informed consent form . 3.2.2 Exclusion criterion Exclusion criterion group follow - Patients suffer serious liver kidney disease , infection , severe systemic disease blood disease malignant tumor ; ② Pregnancy breast-feeding woman ; - Patients could timely follow refuse participate study . 3.2.3 Exit criterion Subjects claim withdraw informed consent . 3.3 Grouping method case number - Experimental group：1250 sample - Positive control group：1250 sample ③ Negative control group：500 sample</detailed_description>
