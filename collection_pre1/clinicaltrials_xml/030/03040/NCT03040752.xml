	<brief_summary>A randomize control double blind study include 200 woman preterm contraction . After successful arrest contraction woman randomize 2 equal group : GI woman receive nifedipine 20 mg tablet twice daily GII woman receive Ritodrine 5 mg tablet every 6 hour . The primary outcome gestational age delivery secondary outcome include episodes recurrent preterm labor , mode delivery , maternal side effect neonatal outcome</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Women include study diagnose preterm labor define accord American Academy Pediatrics American College Obstetricians Gynecologists ( 2012 ) regular contraction 37 week associated cervical change [ 12 ] . Regular uterine contraction mean least 4 20 minute 8 60 minute ) cervical change either cervical dilation 1 cm , and/or cervical effacement ≥ 80 % . Threatened preterm labour define contraction without appreciable cervical change . Women include 18 40 year old gestational age 28 34 week . Women fail tocolytic treatment stop uterine contraction , establish preterm labor ( cervical dilatation ≥ 4 cm ) , multifetal pregnancy , fetal anomaly contraindication continuation pregnancy ( antepartum hemorrhage , premature rupture membrane , evidence intrauterine infection non reassure fetal heart rate trace ) exclude study . During pre-selection visit , exclusion inclusion criterion apply ; record full medical history , finding abdominal , local ultrasound examination . When patient 's consent obtain , digital vaginal examination do prior start medication Treatment TPL achieve Indomethacin administer rectally . A dose 50 100 mg follow 8-hour interval exceed total 24-hour dose 200 mg maximum 48 hour [ 4 ] . After successful arrest contraction woman randomize use automate web base randomization system ensure allocation concealment 2 equal group : GI woman receive nifedipine 20 mg tablet ( Epilat Retard® , EIPICO , Egypt ) twice daily , start 12 hour arrest threaten preterm labor ( The cost 20 tab=5.20 LE ) GII woman receive Ritodrine 5 mg tablet ( Yutopar® , PHARCO , Alexandria ) every 6 hour , start 12 hour arrest threaten preterm labor . ( The cost 20 tab=20LE Treatment maintain till 37 week gestation unless establish preterm delivery commence</detailed_description>
