	<brief_summary>Enrolled subject receive histamine dihydrochloride ( HDC ; Ceplene® ) and/or IL-2 ( Proleukin® ) subcutaneously ( s.c. ) twice daily ( BID ) 3-week period follow 3- 6 week rest period . All subject assign one three consecutive cohort , comprise five patient . Cohort 1 receive HDC without IL-2 first treatment cycle , enable assessment short-term impact HDC alone clonal immunological marker . For remain cycle combination HDC IL-2 give . Cohort 2 receive combination Ceplene Proleukin cycle . After patient cohort 1 2 complete 4 treatment cycle , immunological clinical response toxicity evaluate . On basis result first 4 cycle cohorts 1 2 , third cohort 5 patient enrol receive either combination HDC/IL-2 HDC alone . In case beneficial response* 4 cycle , treatment may continue total 10 cycle . Treatment cycle 5-10 comprise 3 week treatment 6-week rest period . IL-2 administer s.c. , 1 µg/kg ( =16400 IU/kg ) body weight twice daily ( BID ) treatment period . Ceplene® administer s.c. 0.5 mg BID IL-2 . The patient family member/significant instruct administer injection study drug allow safe treatment home .</brief_summary>
