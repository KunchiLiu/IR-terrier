	<brief_title>The Effect Alpha Linolenic Acid ( ALA ) Supplementation During Pregnancy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>DHA ( Docosahexaenoic Acid ) long chain omega-3 fatty acid important brain eye development function throughout life . It also support heart health . DHA abundant omega-3 brain retina naturally find breast milk . EPA ( Eicosapentaenoic Acid ) long-chain omega-3 fatty acid important overall health . However , unlike DHA , body store EPA significant quantity brain retina ( DHA find every cell throughout body , EPA ) . These Omega 3 fatty acid consider essential due inability human body create need consume nutritional source . Food consider rich omega 3 fatty acid fat fish green vegetable . Omega-3 fatty acid `` good fat , '' among important nutrient lack Western diet today . The average person develop country consumes less 100 mg DHA daily . With increase awareness importance DHA , many people realize need make change diet add DHA-rich food supplement . Alpha Linolenic Acid ( ALA ) shorter-chain omega-3 serf source energy build block long-chain omega-3 fatty acid ( DHA EPA ) . This precursor omega 3 fatty acid abundant falx seed . The mother fetus metabolic mechanism enable transform ALA EPA , DHA endogenously . Women pregnancy predispose reduction unsaturated long chain fatty acid ( Polyunsaturated Fatty Acid = PUFA ) omega 3 group . Lately , new hypothesis claiming reduce level essential acid expose fetus later adult life spectrum metabolic cardiovascular disease . New publication animal model show high rate obesity , insulin resistance diabetes cardiovascular damage mouse expose short chain fatty acid compare treat enriched ALA diet supplementation . Different nutritional gynecological health organization around world include FDA , recommend incorporate omega 3 fatty acid supplementation daily diet specifically pregnant woman order raise blood level develop fetus . However , normal fatty acid profile omega 3 group mother fetus n't describe yet . Furthermore , total effect future benefit fetus n't thoroughly study base mainly presumption . The aim study learn effect different supplementation omega 3 group maternal fetal fatty acid profile pregnancy study epigenetic influence . Study method : Women 12 week gestation visit high risk unit fit inclusion criterion offer participate study . Demographic , medical obstetrical information collect medical file give sign informed consent . Each participant randomly assign one three arm study base order recruit ( 1- first group , 2- second group , 3 - third group , 4- first group , etc. ) . Randomization do principal investigator one high risk unit team , blind participant treat doctor . Group 1 : Enriched diet 2 capsule ALA supplementation day - 630 mg capsule . Total amount 1260 mg ( Daily recommend dose 1-2 g ) . Group 2 : Enriched diet 2 capsule DHA+EPA supplementation day ( Each capsule consist 240 mg DHA 360 mg EPA ) Group 3 : Control group - Will receive 2 placebo capsule day ( All product supply company approve FDA Israeli health ministry ) Follow take place every visit high risk unit 3 2 week apart second third trimester , respectively . On visit one blood tube include 5cc blood take fatty acid profile analysis labor 2 blood tube take mother umbilical cord separation placenta : 1- fatty acid analysis , 2- PCR evaluation mRNAs gene find correlate animal model influence maternal diet pregnancy connect metabolic syndrome pathology adulthood ( include - FASn , Elov6 , PPAR ( α , β/δ , γ ) , SCD1 , Fads2 , SREBP-1 Ppargc1alpha , Lpin1 , Plin5 , MAPK/PGC-1α .
