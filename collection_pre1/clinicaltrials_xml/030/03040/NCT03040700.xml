	<brief_summary>The FAMOUS Trial single-center , prospective , randomized study aim compare three different strategy ( clinical , anatomical , functional ) prevent MACE CABG . A total 600 patient include followed 5 year . Patients randomly allocate ( 1:1:1 ) one three follow-up strategy . Patients clinical arm follow regular medical visit every 6 month ; patient functional arm undergo myocardial perfusion scan , anatomical arm subject coronary CT. Non-invasive test perform per protocol regardless symptom every 2 year first year post-surgery . The primary outcome incidence death , acute myocardial infarction myocardial revascularization .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Background : Coronary artery disease ( CAD ) highly prevalent clinical condition , usually associate impairment quality life , high risk cardiovascular event include myocardial infarction cardiovascular death . Because anatomical and/or functional extension disease , combine high-risk clinical feature ( leave ventricular dysfunction , diabetes , chronic kidney disease name ) , many patient must undergo coronary artery bypass grafting ( CABG ) surgery . In USA , 400,000 CABG surgery perform annually . Although benefit CABG high-risk patient well establish long-term , best follow-up strategy surgery still controversial . Current guideline generally recommend follow-up patient CABG base strategy propose patient stable angina . The investigator hypothesize early identification myocardial ischemia progression coronary atherosclerosis , even asymptomatic patient , may superior clinical follow-up alone prevention cardiovascular event .</detailed_description>
