	<brief_summary>Prostate Cancer ( PC ) frequent cancer men , account 21 % new case cancer men United States . Among four incident tumor ( breast , lung colorectal cancer ) ; prostate cancer predictive biomarker guide treatment . Even though molecular heterogeneity PC well-documented , treatment molecularly stratify need genetic prognostic predictive marker critical . DNA repair defect ( DRD ) , mainly Homologous Recombination ( HR ) pathway ( BRCA1 , BRCA2 , ATM CHEK2 ) emerge potential biomarkers prostate cancer . It well know BRCA1 BRCA2 carrier well Progression-Free Survival ( PFS ) Overall Survival ( OS ) non-carriers ovarian cancer . Differently ovarian tumor BRCA mutation provide good prognosis , PC patient harbor HR defect high Gleason score 6 , increase risk recurrence poor prognosis . The predictive role DRD PC demonstrate recent trial use Olaparib , PARP inhibitor , DRD carrier . This trial show 88 % response rate Olaparib , PARP inhibitor act HR pathway synthetic lethality . Recent data demonstrate important association HR deficient high-grade serous ovarian cancer ( HGSOC ) , high neoantigen load high expression PD-1/PD-L1 compare HR proficient HGSOCs 10 . This study show BRCA1 BRCA2 mutation increase number tumor-infiltrating lymphocyte ( TILs ) confer good prognosis . The unprecedented success immunotherapy malignant disorder provide evidence patient 's immune system improve attack establish tumor , mainly melanoma , non-small cell lung cancer kidney cancer . A high mutational burden increase likelihood development specific neoepitopes would confer clinical benefit CTLA-4 PD-1 blockade . These data show specific DNA repair defect increase mutational burden , expression PD-1/PD-L1 TILs ; could improve response immunotherapy cancer . This rationale already test trial evaluate PD-1 checkpoint inhibitor Pembrolizumab mismatch-repair deficient patient , kind DNA repair defect definition . This important trial show DRD predict clinical benefit immune checkpoint blockade many type cancer , especially colorectal cancer .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Nivolumab Prostate Cancer With Mutations DNA Repair Defects ( ImmunoProst Trial )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This Phase II , two-stage , multi-center , single-arm , open-label trial Nivolumab ( BMS-936558 ) patient metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer ( mCRPC ) progress taxane-based chemotherapy regimen previously . Eligible patient must ECOG 0-2 material biomarker analysis . Prior enzalutamide , abiraterone cabazitaxel permit necessary enrollment . The germline somatic DRD ( BRCA1 , BRCA2 , ATM , PTEN , CHEK2 , RAD51C , RAD51D , PALB2 , MLH1 , MSH2 , MSH6 , PMS2 . ) assess T-NGS metastatic site liquid biopsy . The primary endpoint PSA 50 response rate ( PSA50 , follow Prostate Cancer Working Group 3 criterion ) . The trial meet endpoint ≥ 3/29 men achieve PSA50 response . The secondary endpoint include progression-free survival ( PFS ) , overall survival , radiologic PFS , PSA response rate 6 12 month .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>1 . Histologically confirm adenocarcinoma prostate tumor tissue available molecular analysis . If archival tissue biomarker analysis available patient must willing biopsy obtain tumor tissue histological diagnosis . 2 . Metastatic Castrateresistant prostate cancer ( mCRPC ) , define : Disease progression despite androgen deprivation therapy ( ADT ) may present either continuous rise serum prostatespecific antigen ( PSA ) level , progression preexist disease , and/or appearance new metastasis . Surgically medically castrate , testosterone level &lt; 50 ng/dL ( &lt; 2.0 nM ) . If patient treat GnRH LHRH agonists antagonist ( patient undergone orchiectomy ) , therapy maintain . 3 . Documented prostate cancer progression , treatment Docetaxel , assess investigator one following : PSA progression define accord PCWG3 criterion : PSA increase , ≥ 50 % ≥ 2 ng/mL nadir , confirm second value ≥ 3 week later ( confirm rise trend ) . Radiographic progression visceral lesion soft tissue disease modify RECIST 1.1 criterion . Progression bone metastasis define accord Appendix B : Prostate Cancer Clinical Trials Working Group 3 ( Adapted ) two document new bone lesion bone scan without PSA progression . Confirmation ambiguous result image modality ( eg , CT MRI ) obligatory . If Docetaxel chemotherapy use , consider one regimen . 4 . Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group ( ECOG ) Performance Status ≤ 2 Appendix A : Performance Status Criteria 5 . Life expectancy &gt; 24 week . 6 . Age ≥ 18 year 7 . At least 28 day since completion prior anticancer therapy ( except LHRH agonist antagonist ) , include chemotherapy ( taxanebased ) . Additionally , clinically relevant treatment toxicity resolve grade 1 less prior start study treatment . 8 . For hormonal treatment must follow guideline : No antiandrogens allow study period . The use antiandrogens study entry permit , least 28 day since completion prior antiandrogen require ( washout period ) . Corticosteroids dose &gt; Prednisolone 10 mg/day ( equivalent ) allow clinically indicated medical condition . At least 28 day since completion prior corticotherapy require ( washout period ) . 9 . Agreeable biomarker study include fresh tumor biopsy need . 10 . Patients must adequate organ function within 1 week prior enrollment evidence : Hemoglobin ≥ 9.0 g/dL WBC &gt; 2.000/mm3 Absolute neutrophil count ≥ 1.500/mm3 Platelet count ≥ 100.000/mm3 Creatinine Clearance ≥ 30 mL/min . Creatinine Clearance ( CrCl ) must calculate screen use CockcroftGault formula : Bilirubin &lt; 3 x upper limit normal ( ULN ) except patient know Gilbert 's syndrome . Aspartate transaminase ( AST ) ( SGOT ) &lt; 3.0 x ULN . Alanine transaminase ( ALT ) ( SGPT ) &lt; 3.0 x ULN . No cardiac disease define active angina , symptomatic congestive heart failure , myocardial infarction within previous six month . Patients active know suspected autoimmune disease . Patients vitiligo , type I diabetes mellitus , control autoimmune hypothyroidism , psoriasis require systemic treatment , condition control permit enroll . Patients condition need systemic corticosteroid dose &gt; Prednisolone 10 mg/day ( equivalent ) immunosuppressive medication within 28 day prior first dose study drug . Inhaled steroid permit necessary . Patients know active chronic liver disease . Patients prior history malignancy treat curative intention past 2 year exception basal cell carcinoma squamous cell carcinoma skin , allow case . Patients malignancy fulfill prior criterion could consider recruitment represent competitive cause death low potential progress metastatic progression . Patients condition may enrol trial approve review principal investigator . Known history test positive human immunodeficiency virus ( HIV ) , know acquire immunodeficiency syndrome ( AIDS ) , positive test hepatitis B hepatitis C virus represent acute chronic disease .
