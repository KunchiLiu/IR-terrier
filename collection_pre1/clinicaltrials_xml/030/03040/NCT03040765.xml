	<brief_summary>This study compare two medication Denosumab Zoledronic Acid For Patients With Beta Thalassemia Major Induced Osteoporosis . Patients B-thalassemia major induce osteoporosis undergo baseline assessment bone densitometry Dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry scan standard care radiology department , blood test bone specific Alkaline phosphatase type-1 Carboxy Telopeptide measure chemistry lab . Patients B-Thalassemia Major induced osteoporosis , 18 year age willing participate study enrol consent primary investigator hematology outpatient clinic . Patients osteoporosis receive one two medication , end year Dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry scan do compare response two medication . The potential risk include drug-related side effect</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Denosumab Versus Zoledronic Acid Thalassemia-Induced Osteoporosis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Despite significant improvement therapeutic management beta thalassemia major ( BTM ) past decade , osteoporosis still common finding , even optimally treated patient . The relationship bone mineral density ( BMD ) several clinical characteristic hematological marker describe . Chronic anemia , bone marrow expansion due ineffective erythropoiesis , iron toxicity , calcium zinc deficiency , low vitamin D level endocrine complication suggest contribute etiology bone diseases BTM . Nevertheless , complex etiological mechanism heterogeneous osteopathy remain incompletely clarify . A complex mechanism control bone remodel human . This mechanism include receptor activator nuclear factor kappa B ligand ( RANKL ) , natural receptor ( RANK ) osteoprotegerin ( OPG ) . The RANK/RANKL pathway essential promote osteoclast formation activation prolongs osteoclast survival . OPG act decoy receptor RANKL prevent interaction RANK thereby inhibit osteoclast formation , function , survival . Alteration RANK/RANKL/OPG system increase osteoclastic activity enhance osteoblastic dysfunction propose important mechanism etiology osteoporosis BTM . Hypogonadism , common find BTM , associate enhanced RANKL activity . The sex steroid hormone , androgen , estrogens , via respective nuclear receptor , regulate BMD human mouse . Testosterone likely direct indirect inhibitory effect human osteoclast formation bone resorption . Animal model cell culture study suggest direct inhibitory effect androgens OPG/RANKL cytokine system . In human osteoblastic cell , testosterone 5‑dihydrotestosterone mediate androgen receptor‑induced specific inhibition OPG messenger ribonucleic acid ( mRNA ) expression . Androgens also show block RANKL‑induced osteoclastic formation RANKL expression find up‑regulated osteoblastic cell androgen receptor‑deficient mouse . The effect oestradiol ( E2 ) osteoclast precursor osteoclast seem mediate osteoblastic cell . Inhibitory effect E2 associate stimulated secretion OPG osteoblast . Previous study focus characteristic thalassemic patient osteoporosis response therapy bisphosphonate . Because RANK‑RANKL OPG play significant role bone resorption seem principal implicate mechanism development osteoporosis BTM , conduct prospective study evaluate anti‑RANKL denosumab versus zoledronic acid TM‑induced osteoporosis .</detailed_description>
