	<brief_summary>The purpose Lung Institute collect isolate patient 's cell platelet rich plasma ( PRP ) deliver product back patient same-day . Lung Institute 's treatment limit self- funded patient chronic lung disease - chronic obstructive pulmonary disease ( COPD ) interstitial lung disease ( ILD ) . The patient 's cell platelet rich plasma collect venous bone marrow harvest technique . The hypothesized outcome Lung Institute therapy safety minimization adverse event , perceive improvement patient 's lung condition ( determined ability physically active ; walk great distance without oxygen improve quality life scale ) , improvement FEV1 among COPD patient , ability reduce use oxygen possibly stop it. , ability function well without use rescue inhaler , reduction cease secondary pulmonary infection , reduction emergency room visit exacerbation related disease .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>An Observational Outcomes Study Autologous Cell Therapy Among Patients With COPD Interstitial Lung Disease</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Through collection outcome data , Lung Institute aim explore describe safety efficacy autologous stem cell treatment chronic lung disease dissemination public medical community advancement regenerative medicine . The study aim confirm safety autologous cell therapy , explore effect autologous cell therapy treatment pulmonary function , describe anecdotal quality life change patient follow treatment use quantitative qualitative measure .</detailed_description>
