	<brief_summary>Transforaminal epidural block ( TFEB ) local anesthetic steroid effective treat spinal radicular pain . However , inadvertent intravascular injection lead severe neurologic complication . Digital subtraction angiography ( DSA ) epidural block might increase detection rate intravascular penetration , compare real-time fluoroscopy ( RTF ) . But , DSA disadvantage , additional radiation exposure physicians participant high cost new upgraded fluoroscopic equipment . In study , design compare DSA RTF detection intravascular penetration participant underwent cervical TFEB . The investigator prospectively examine participant receive cervical TFEB . The needle position confirm use biplanar fluoroscopy 2 ml nonionic contrast medium inject rate 0.5 ml/sec RTF . Thirty second later , 2 ml nonionic contrast medium inject rate 0.5 ml/sec DSA .</brief_summary>
