	<brief_summary>The purpose study develop imaging protocol use cardiovascular magnetic resonance ( CMR ) ass cardiac function , morphology tissue characterization . The National Heart Research Institute Singapore ( NHRIS ) house two dedicated CMR scanner support numerous investigator initiated project patient various cardiac pathologist . By optimize novel CMR sequence use study , scan time shorten patient underlie cardiac disease .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>CMR Sequence Imaging Protocol Development</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>In medical research , continuous need develop new image technique cardiovascular magnetic resonance ( CMR ) imaging . This allow u visualize study function structure heart great detail improve diagnosis treatment patient various cardiac condition . The aim study optimise new CMR sequence , allow development imaging protocol future research study . This study hence recruit 100 subject follow sub-studies : 1 . Sub-study 1 : Normal CMR protocol assessment cardiac function morphology 2 . Sub-study 2 : Exercise stress protocol CMR-compatible supine bike . For first sub-study , 50 healthy volunteer recruit . The test optimise CMR sequence setting crucial ensure accuracy robustness scan use test patient cardiac disease . For second sub-study , 50 healthy volunteer different fitness level recruit . An exercise stress protocol develop future study patient suspect coronary artery disease . For protocol , participant ask cycle supine exercise bike ass effect exercise free breathing stability CMR imaging sequence .</detailed_description>
