	<brief_summary>Reusable flexible ureteroscopes widely use treat various upper urinary tract diseases include urinary stone . However , require long turnover time procedure sterilization process . Moreover , repeat use scope ultimately deteriorate image quality lead high maintenance cost long-term . A disposable digital flexible ureteroscope release United States January 2016 , offer improve image resolution , new scope performance characteristic every case , need sterilization repair . Preliminary data center demonstrate disposable scope shorten operative time 25 % compare reusable fiberoptic scope associate 2/3 reduction procedural complication rate . Therefore , treatment disposable scope may effective patient facilitate cost management within hospital . Here , propose three-armed , prospective randomize study , compare treatment outcome disposable digital , reusable fiberoptic , reusable digital flexible ureteroscopes .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Comparing Treatment Urolithiasis Between Disposable Reusable Ureteroscope</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This single center , prospective , randomize control pragmatic clinical trial design compare disposable , reusable fiberoptic , reusable digital ureteroscopes upper urinary tract stone treatment efficacy . Three hundred subject kidney and/or ureteral stone plan recruit study . All subject computer sequence-randomized ureteroscopic treatment perform disposable ( LithoVue™ ) , reusable fiberoptic ( URF-P6™ ) , reusable digital ( URF-V2™ ) flexible ureteroscope . Patient 's demographic , physical , laboratory , image finding collect surgery . These clinical data already collect part ongoing registry study . Perioperative timing well operator 's satisfaction fatigue need second ureteroscope case record treatment course . Other clinical data collect day 7 , 30 , 90 , 180 surgery . The condition use ureteroscopes track recorded confirm repair rate . Screening data review determine subject eligibility . Subjects meet inclusion criterion none exclusion criterion enter study . The following surgical treatment use similarly three randomize arm represent standard case therapy : Ureteroscopic stone removal Under general anesthesia , patient place lithotomy position . All procedure perform direct videoscopic fluoroscopic guidance . Fluoroscopic screen utilized use mobile multidirectional C-arm fluoroscopy unit . Initially , safety guide-wire place renal pelvis , follow ureteral access sheath need maintain low intra-renal pressure facilitate procedure . Using flexible ureteroscope , renal ureteral stone identify fragmented holmium YAG laser . Basket extraction residual fragment do visual complete clearance stone fragment achieve . After ureteroscopy do stone clearance achieve , ureteral stent place end procedure drain kidney 2-21 day clinically indicate . The total duration study expect one year subject recruitment one year six month final subject follow-up .</detailed_description>
