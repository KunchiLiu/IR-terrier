	<brief_title>Prospective Analysis Value Contrast-enhanced Sonography During Biopsies Focal Liver Masses</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>As major oncology hepatology center , perform 3-5 guided biopsy liver tumor weekly . Ultrasound preferred modality image biopsy due ability visualize position biopsy needle real time high accuracy safety , nonionizing , quicker compare technique , especially CT-guided biopsy . The failure rate ultrasound guide liver biopsy ( include case biopsy decline perform due lack lesion visibility ) 10 % . By comparison , practice genotyping metastatic tumor , multiple core biopsy , often request entry oncology trial , failure tumor genotyping biopsy estimate 30 % . Recently , first ultrasound contrast agent FDA-approved characterization liver lesion [ sulfur hexafluoride lipid-type A microspheres ( Lumason , Bracco Diagnostics , Monroe Township , NJ ) ] . The microbubble agent deem safe , include cardiac failure patient chronic airway obstruction . Injecting microbubbles may allow good visualization lesion adjacent vasculature enhance microvasculature adjacent vessel potentially reduce incidence fail biopsy bleeding complication . In addition , determination necrotic region lesion may allow good direction biopsy . Yet limited literature use ultrasound contrast agent improve target liver biopsy . We intend prospectively assess non-diagnostic biopsy complication rate group patient undergo contrast-enhanced ultrasonography ( CEUS ) use microbubbles time biopsy . We compare result group failure complication rate control group patient undergo standard US-guided biopsy procedure . Over 12 month expect perform approximately 200 biopsy . Power analysis suggest 125 patient contrast-enhanced sonography control group , , require . We able enroll sufficient patient 18 month</detailed_description>
