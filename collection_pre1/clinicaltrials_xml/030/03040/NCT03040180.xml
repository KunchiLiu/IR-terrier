	<brief_title>Endoscopic Assisted Electrochemotherapy Addition Neoadjuvant Treatment Locally Advanced Rectal Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Electroporation cancer cell allow great concentration chemotherapy drug enter tumor cell . The uptake chemotherapeutic drug aid application short electric pulse tumor mass ( refer - Electrochemotherapy ECT ) . The pulse make tumor cell porous allows drug easy access cancer cell , whereas tissue organ body remain relatively poor absorb drug , thereby reduce potential side effect healthy tissue . Procedures electrochemotherapy previously apply human patient country EU , US Japan . The drug concentration use significantly reduce due target absorption tumor significantly reduce side effect normally associate chemotherapy . A large number preclinical clinical Phase I I/II study demonstrate efficiency safety ECT . These study include patient melanoma , head neck squamous cell carcinoma , merkel cell carcinoma , basal cell carcinoma adenocarcinoma nodule . An endoscopic system ( EndoVE ) deliver electric pulse gastrointestinal tumor recently develop . The treatment procedure similar standard endoscopic colorectal examination ( therapeutic colonoscopy ) add element intravenous injection bleomycin follow delivery electric pulse ( one less 1msec duration ) . The pulse endoscopically deliver directly tumor mass . The entire procedure minimally invasive completely ambulatory . A successful treatment cause tumor shrink size week follow procedure . The objective study investigate efficacy safety approach downsize locally advanced rectal tumor prior intend curative surgery . Time frame : 1 . All patient treat standard neoadjuvant chemoradiation therapy prior enrollment trial . 2 . Alle patient PET/MRI scan perform twice evaluate treatment response ( ECT ) 3 . ECT treatment perform 4 week prior surgery outline MDT . 4 . Alle patient follow 3 month .</detailed_description>
