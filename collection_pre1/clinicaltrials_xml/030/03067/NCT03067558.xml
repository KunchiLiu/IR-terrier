	<detailed_description>General aim : To understand whether ARIDA test device accurately measure respiratory rate ( RR ) child 5 year age cough and/or difficult breathing . Primary objective : To determine performance ARIDA test device , define accuracy consistency child 5 year cough difficulty breathe control set . Secondary objective : To determine performance expert clinician ( ECs ) count RR , define accuracy consistency , child 5 year cough difficulty breathe control set . To measure RR fluctuation time ARIDA test device attachment , normal breathe child age 2 59 month , control setting . Sample size : A total 290 respiratory rate assessment do . The accuracy evaluation enroll 156 child ( 52 per age group : 0 &lt; 2 month , 2 &lt; 12 month 12 59 month ) . The consistency evaluation enroll 104 child ( 52 per age group : 2 &lt; 12 month 12 59 month ) . The accuracy consistency evaluation aim enroll child ratio 3:1 fast : normal breather age group . The RR fluctuation evaluation enroll 30 normal breathe child age 2 59 month . Data collection : Overview evaluation stage : 1 . Training research team : 3 day 2 . Pre-testing procedural activity debrief : 5 day 3 . Screening procedure take place ascertain study eligibility . Written parent guardian inform consent obtain . 4 . Children enrol prospectively base eligibility determine screening procedure . 5 . Child participate assign evaluation : accuracy , consistency , RR fluctuation Steps device evaluation : Study blind ECs : All ECs conduct manual RR count accuracy , consistency RR fluctuation evaluation blind RR result pre-screen assessment ARIDA test device reading evaluation : - RR read pre-screening record research assistant ( RA ) data collection form see EC manual counter ( ) . - ARIDA test device RR reading cover obtained RA . ARIDA test device RR reading record RA . - Data collection form enter secure tablet , keep confidentially clinic office ( lock desk drawer cabinet ) health facility transfer back Malaria Consortium country office . At point un-blinding ECs require . This child/young infant develop medical complication adverse event ( AE ) attributable device treatment institute un-blinded research nurse/clinical officer treatment base outcome study . Accuracy evaluation : There 3 attempt obtain ARIDA test device EC manual RR read standard practice . The research assistant ( RA ) attach ARIDA test device child accord device instruction . When child calm , videographer start video record ARIDA test device manual EC RR count start simultaneously , mark audible 'clap ' . The manual RR evaluation last 60 second . After 60 second , EC obtain RR reading , record unsuccessful attempt repeat attempt EC ARIDA test device . If third attempt , record failure . For attempt 1 2 , ARIDA test device evaluation period last 90 second . For attempt 3 , evaluation period ARIDA test device last 120 second . Consistency evaluation : The consistency evaluation follow procedure accuracy evaluation . To obtain measure consistency two ARIDA test device , two test device attach single belt , line nipple measure RR evaluation period . To obtain measure consistency two ECs , two ECs obtain manual RR count standard practice measure RR evaluation period . The research team debrief Parent Guardian completion assessment ensure medical management child complete relevant hospital staff . Reference standard : The reference standard video panel review two independent expert . Video annotation software use panel expert order mark inhalation exhalation . If panel agree ( ≤±2bpm ) , median reading use . If panel disagree ( &gt; ±2bpm ) , third expert invite review video . If two three reading agree ( ≤±2bpm ) , median RR reading use . If three panel member disagreement ( &gt; ±2bpm ) , result exclude ( methodology base Pneumonia Diagnostics project , Malaria Consortium , 2016 , unpublished ) . RR fluctuation evaluation : This evaluation time bound repeat RR read take . If reading obtain within evaluation period , record unsuccessful attempt continue evaluation . When child calm , baseline EC manual RR count 60 second obtain . Following , child calm ARIDA test device attach child EC three manual RR count 60 second following time period : 1 . 0-1 minute 2 . 2-3 minute 3 . 4-5 minute Data storage : All data collect use electronic form uploaded tablet back protected cloud account . Patient identifier utilise data form ; UIC associate barcode use anonymise patient data track patient data . The UIC use study four numerical character . ECs numerical unique identifier , assign begin study . Data quality assurance : As part quality assurance procedure , standard clinical protocol , standard operating procedure ( SOPs ) job aid prepare .
