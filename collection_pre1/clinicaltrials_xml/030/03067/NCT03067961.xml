	<brief_summary>Typhoid fever result infection bacterium call Salmonella Typhi major cause illness worldwide . It estimate infect 20-25 million people every year affect people age , particularly common young child . The disease spread contaminate food water , effort improve water quality , sanitation hygiene likely go long way reduce global burden disease . Unfortunately , improve access clean water sanitation improvement costly difficult implement large scale . Vaccination typhoid fever likely cost-effective way reduce global disease burden . There two vaccine currently available typhoid fever . Whilst vaccine provide protection disease ( region 50-70 % ) vaccines less effective young child , population group high risk disease . In order develop new generation typhoid vaccine important complete understand bacterium cause disease . In study , investigator aim understand Salmonella Typhi bacteria cause disease . In particular , investigator aim study importance toxin produce typhoid bacteria , call typhoid toxin . The typhoid toxin recently discover . It make typhoid bacteria closely related bacteria , paratyphoid . From study do laboratory , evidence typhoid toxin important cause typhoid disease . It think typhoid toxin might important causing symptom typhoid disease , however exact role typhoid toxin infection human n't study . Studying might impact design new vaccine typhoid . In study , investigator undertake 'challenge ' two strain typhoid bacteria ( Salmonella Typhi ) . This involve expose participant live Salmonella Typhi define circumstance , ask swallow solution contain bacteria . After challenge investigator closely monitor participant period least two week investigator treat participant antibiotic soon diagnose typhoid disease . The investigator interest compare response challenge two strain typhoid bacteria differ production typhoid toxin . This process undertaken participant previous Oxford Vaccine Group study since 2011 .</brief_summary>

The participant enrol follow apply : History significant organ/system disease could interfere trial conduct completion . Including , example , restrict : Cardiovascular disease Respiratory disease Haematological disease Endocrine disorder Renal bladder disease , include history renal calculus Biliary tract disease , include biliary colic , asymptomatic gallstone previous cholecystectomy Gastrointestinal disease include requirement antacid , H2receptor antagonists , proton pump inhibitor laxatives Neurological disease Metabolic disease Autoimmune disease Psychiatric illness require hospitalisation know suspected drug and/or alcohol misuse ( alcohol misuse define intake exceed 42 unit per week ) Infectious disease Have know suspect impairment immune function , alteration immune function , prior immune exposure may alter immune function typhoid result , example : Congenital acquire immunodeficiency , include IgA deficiency Human Immunodeficiency Virus infection symptoms/signs suggestive HIVassociated condition Receipt immunosuppressive therapy anticancer chemotherapy radiation therapy within precede 12 month longterm systemic corticosteroid therapy . Receipt immunoglobulin blood product transfusion within 3 month study start . History cancer ( except squamous cell basal cell carcinoma skin cervical carcinoma situ ) . Moderate severe depression anxiety classify Hospital Anxiety Depression Score screen challenge deem clinically significant study doctor . Weight le 50kg . Presence implant prosthesis . Anyone take longterm medication ( e.g . analgesia , antiinflammatories antibiotic ) may affect symptom report interpretation study result . Contraindication fluoroquinolone macrolide antibiotic ( e.g ciprofloxacin azithromycin ) .

Fulltime , parttime voluntary occupation involve : Clinical social work direct contact young child ( define attend preschool group nursery age 2 year ) , Clinical social work direct contact highly susceptible patient person typhoid infection would particularly serious consequence ( unless willing avoid work demonstrate infected S. Typhi accordance guidance Public Health England willing allow study staff inform employer ) . Full time , part time voluntary occupation involve : Commercial food handling ( involve prepare serve unwrapped food subject heat ) Close household contact : Young child ( define attend preschool group , nursery age less 2 year ) Individuals immunocompromised . Scheduled elective surgery procedure require general anaesthesia study period . Participants participate another research study involve investigational product might affect risk typhoid infection compromise integrity study within 30 day prior enrolment ( e.g . significant volume blood already take previous study ) . Detection abnormal result screen investigation ( clinical discretion study team ) . Inability comply study requirement ( discretion study staff participant 's General Practitioner ) . Any social , psychological health issue , opinion study staff , may put participant contact risk participation study , adversely affect interpretation primary endpoint data , impair participant 's ability participate study .
