	<detailed_description>Fast track surgery ( FTS ) use multifaceted approach reduce stress response surgery , thereby improve outcome decrease length hospital stay . The core element FTS include : epidural regional anesthesia , peri-operative fluid management , minimally invasive technique , optimal pain control , early initiation oral feed early mobilization . The combination approach lead significant reduction complication rate , morbidity mortality rate , duration hospital stay cost hospitalization , greatly improve postoperative recovery The main aim study explore efficacy FTS Rwandan surgical setting demonstrate benefit FTS . This randomize control trial conduct CHUK period three month ( October - December , 2015 ) . For patient FTS arm , study investigator would assess patient daily basis work primary surgical team . The study investigator would prompt primary surgical team early feeding , mobilization , pain control fluid management recommendation . Data collect variable include postoperative analgesia , mobilisation , resume oral feeding , hospital stay complication . The primary outcome duration postoperative hospital stay secondary outcome major complication .</detailed_description>
