	<brief_summary>The purpose study identify unique urine protein marker Primary Hyperoxaluria type 1 ( PH1 ) compare healthy control . Urine protein marker identify `` proteomic '' analyse protein process lab break small building block . Using analytical chemistry technique specialize equipment many protein identify measure . Most protein find healthy living cell subtle change proteins presence different marker reflect abnormal process pattern disease . When identified disease , protein biomarkers help determine disease respond new type therapy . In study , change urine proteomic pattern time , association change estimate ( calculate ) kidney filter function , relative risk progression PH1 determine . Additionally , part study , investigator measure urinary protein peptides marker kidney tissue protection ( healthy heal kidney ongoing damage high urine oxalate level , oxalate crystal stone ) establish marker prospectively decrease PH1 urine . Longitudinal study urine `` proteomics '' may assist identify mechanism behind PH1-related progression kidney failure might contribute important information towards future identification development effective therapy slow prevent kidney failure PH1 .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Primary hyperoxaluria type 1 ( PH1 ) rare genetically inherit disorder see 1:100,000-150,000 people often underdiagnosed child . PH1 characterize abnormally high level oxalate blood urine , crystal urine , frequent formation kidney stone , harden ( calcification ) kidney call `` nephrocalcinosis . '' Identification evaluation protein peptide ( biomarkers ) urine PH1 patient may provide insight process kidney damage occur time PH1 evaluate marker point diagnosis long-term . By study biomarker pattern urine PH1 patient collect course disease , information change biomarker pattern time may provide important clue patient high risk faster progression end stage kidney failure may serve important outcome new therapy future , . Primary study objective : Identify unique urine proteomic marker PH1 versus healthy intra-familial sibling control PHI patient specimens one point time ( cross-sectionally ) . Secondary study objective : Determine change time urine proteomic pattern , association change estimate ( calculate ) kidney filter function , relative risk progression PH1 kidney disease progression . Tertiary study objective : Establish , course PH1 , protective effect body ( kidney ) normal kidney tissue heal decreased/ lose evidenced long-term change biomarker pattern . The primary endpoint study include standard clinical endpoint ( data kidney doctor would look PH1 patient would follow time clinic ) , best reflect PH1 disease progression : ( ) estimate glomerular filtration rate ( eGFR ) , know kidney filter function ; ( b ) urine oxalate ; ( c ) plasma oxalate ( eGFR &lt; 40 ml/min/1.73 m2 , kidney function significantly decrease ) . The goal Rare Kidney Stone Consortium ( RKSC ) advance understanding treatment severe , rare form nephrolithiasis cause mark excretion insoluble mineral important stone formation patient experience recur stone childhood onward risk chronic kidney disease . End state renal disease common PH1 . Importantly , condition rare enough minimal share information expertise among clinician scientist , situation slow progress toward effective treatment . Over last 6 year , RKSC form secure , web-based registry tissue bank open collaborative project . About Study : This pilot investigation use previously collect archive ( 1 ) cross-sectional 24 hr . urine sample PH1 patient ( n=20 ) healthy sibling control ( n=18 ) ( 2 ) longitudinally collect 24 hr . urine sample patient PH1 enrol RKSC registry bank ( n=55 ) . No new sample collect . Additional information collect ( provided urine specimen ) part study : De-identified data patient 's health history , medication supplement take ; history kidney stone ( chemical make-up ) ; gender , current age , height , weight ; old measurement urine acidity , blood oxalate , urine oxalate , calcium , citrate , creatinine ( muscle breakdown ) concentration , urine super saturation .</detailed_description>
