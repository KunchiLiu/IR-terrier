	<brief_title>Daratumumab Subjects With Relapsed/Refractory Acute Myelogenous Leukemia High-Risk Myelodysplastic Syndrome</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Study Drug Administration : Each cycle 28 day ( 4 week ) . If participant find eligible take part study , participant receive daratumumab vein Days 1 , 8 , 15 , 22 Cycles 1 2 , Days 1 15 Cycles 3-6 , Day 1 Cycles 7 beyond 1 year unless disease stop respond treatment , whichever early . Participant 's first dose give 4½ hour . After , infusion take 2½ hour . In study , follow do low chance daratumumab infusion relate reaction : - Participant get medication , include steroid , acetaminophen , and/or antihistamine infusion . If participant consider high risk , participant may also get medication , include inhaled steroid , infusion . - The infusion may slow stop participant reaction . - Participant may stay overnight hospital infusion study staff check participant 's health . Participant may ask study staff information type medication participant receive low participant 's chance infusion-related reaction , include administered risk . Length Study : Participant may continue take study drug 1 year . Participant longer able take study drug disease get bad , intolerable side effect occur , participant unable follow study direction . Study Visits : If participant become pregnant , blood ( 1 teaspoon ) drawn pregnancy test within 24 hour participant 's first dose daratumumab . If doctor think need , participant may physical exam participant 's study visit . On Day 1 Cycles 1 2 : - Blood ( 2 teaspoon ) draw routine test . - During Cycle 2 ( +/- 2 day ) , participant bone marrow biopsy/aspirate check status disease . On Days 8 , 15 , 22 Cycles 1 2 , blood ( 2 teaspoon ) draw routine test . On Day 1 Cycles 3-6 : - Blood ( 2 teaspoon ) draw routine test . - During Cycle 3 , EKG . - If participant become pregnant , blood ( 1 teaspoon ) drawn pregnancy test . On Day 1 Cycles 3 beyond ( +/- 2 day ) , participant bone marrow aspirate/biopsy check status disease . Participant continue test participant response study drug . The study doctor decide participant test . On Day 15 Cycles 3-6 , blood ( 2 teaspoon ) draw routine test . On Day 1 Cycles 7 beyond : - Blood ( 2 teaspoon ) draw routine test . - During Cycle 7 , participant EKG . - If participant become pregnant , blood ( 1 teaspoon ) drawn pregnancy test . End-of-Treatment Visit : About 28-35 day participant 's last dose daratumumab : - Participant physical exam . - Blood ( 2 teaspoon ) draw routine test . - Participant EKG . - If doctor think need , participant bone marrow biopsy/aspiration . - If participant become pregnant , blood ( 1 teaspoon ) drawn pregnancy test . Follow-Up Visits : The study staff call participant ask participant 1 time month first year participant 's end-of-treatment visit , every 6 month second year , 1 time every year . Each call last 5 minute . If disease respond treatment disease come back , blood ( 2 teaspoon ) draw routine test 1 time month first 2 year end-of-treatment visit . Participant may additional follow-up visit part participant 's routine care . This discussed participant . This investigational study . Daratumumab FDA approve commercially available treatment multiple myeloma ( MM ) . It consider investigational use treatment AML MDS . The study doctor explain study drug design work . Up 36 patient take part study . All enrol MD Anderson .</detailed_description>
