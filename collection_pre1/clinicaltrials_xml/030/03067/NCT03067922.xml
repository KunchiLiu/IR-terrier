	<brief_summary>Breast cancer common cancer woman India account 27 % cancer woman . Incidence rise early thirty , peak 50-64 year . Approximately 48 % 50 year age . Most present symptom develop , 2B beyond . Treatment depend stage disease . Surgical removal tumour part treatment attempt cure . Simple mastectomy involves removal breast tissue without axillary lymph node dissection removal chest wall muscle . Radical mastectomy involve removal entire breast , skin , pectoralis major minor muscle ipsilateral axillary lymph node .

The Brief pain inventory { BPI } ( obtained permission MD Anderson ) , assess severity pain impact pain daily function administer participant language familiar , preoperatively , 1 month , 4th 6th month postoperatively . The short form comprise nine question related severity pain , impact pain daily function , location pain , pain medication amount pain relief past 24 hour past week.It widely use validate several language world . EORTC QLQ [ Quality life Questionaries ] integrate system assess quality life [ health relate ] . This self administer questionnaire incorporate five functional scale , physical [ PF ] , role [ RF ] , cognitive [ CF ] , emotional [ ef ] , social ; three symptom scale fatigue , pain nausea/vomiting ; global health quality life scale several single item financial impact additional symptom like diarrhea , appetite loss , sleep disturbance . This would help identify quality life participant affection . If participant follow say interval , pain score would obtain telephonically BPI , EORTC QLQ 30 form prepaid envelope would give discharge would duly fill post give address appropriate interval . If next follow hospital coincides 4th 6th postoperative month , participant visit pain clinic assessment complete BPI .</detailed_description>
