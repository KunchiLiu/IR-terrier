	<brief_title>Autologous Bone Marrow-Derived Stem Cell Therapy Motor Neuron Disease</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>A motor neuron disease ( MND ) several neurological disorder selectively affect motor neuron , cell control voluntary muscle body . They include amyotrophic lateral sclerosis ( ALS ) , primary lateral sclerosis ( PLS ) , progressive muscular atrophy ( PMA ) , progressive bulbar palsy ( PBP ) pseudobulbar palsy ; spinal muscular atrophy also sometimes include group.They neurodegenerative disease cause increase disability eventually , death . In spite intensive research , motor neuron disease ( MNDs ) still incurable . Some key factor failure find cure lack human cell-based disease model molecular analysis drug screen difficulty obtain homogeneous population specific cell type clinical application . Stem cell biology potential transform understand disease process revolutionize approach develop novel therapy MNDs . In study , investigator suggest protocol treatment MND transplantation purify autologous bone marrow-derived stem cell via intrathecal intravenous route .</detailed_description>
