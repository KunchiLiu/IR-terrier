	<brief_title>Autologous Platelet-Rich Plasma ( PRP ) Endometrial Thickness</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>In clinical practice , thin endometrium , unresponsive conventional therapy , usually result cycle cancellation embryo cryopreservation . The evaluation adequate endometrial growth perform use grey-scale ultrasound . The minimal endometrial thickness require embryo transfer consider 7 mm end natural medically induced follicular phase , despite investigator report different cutoff value , range 7 10 mm . Currently , evidence-based data show predictive positive value endometrial thickness pregnancy rate Embryo-transfer , endometrial line 7mm chance pregnancy statistically significant reduce . Thin endometrium relatively frequent woman previous trauma uterus ( cesarean section , repetitive curettage ) , patient subject antitumoral treatment childhood ( Radiotherapy , Chemotherapy , Surgery ) , woman affect Asherman 's syndrome , chronic infection ( endometritis , Pelvic Inflammatory Disease ) inadequate blood flow ( stress , malposition uterus , fibrosis ) , patient low estradiol value excessive use Clomiphene Citrate . Several alternative treatment propose year improve endometrial thickening , show consider answer many case : , indeed , require damaged endometrium , act endometrial blood flow direct proliferative effect endometrium . The factor presume proliferative effect endometrium Granulocyte-Colony Stimulating Factor ( G-CSF ) hypothesis support vitro study . Recently , first result vitro study ongoing evaluation Platelet-Rich Plasma ( PRP ) effect endometrial cell proliferation present ( Aghayanova et al. , 2016 ) . The author demonstrate PRP increase proliferation cultured fibroblast , currently know also mesenchymal cell , progenitor different type cell , include endometrial cell . This evidence support hypothesis PRP stimulate cellular process involve endometrial regeneration , relevant management thin lining . Autologous Platelet-Rich Plasma prepare fresh whole blood collect peripheral vein process separate platelet blood component . PRP contain activate platelet stimulate action cytokine growth factor . On basis evidence , local intrauterine infusion PRP may improve endometrial growth implantation . Patients consider candidate PRP application must undergo minor hematological evaluation exclude blood disorder platelet dysfunction . The study , since involves use blood component , approve Ethical Committee participant sign inform write consent undergoing procedure . Any concern immunogenic reaction disease transmission , exist homologous blood product , eliminate PRP produce autologous blood . Preparation PRP , however , demand many process step , thus theoretic possibility contamination . For reason , sample subject quality sterility control within close mechanism . No wound infection PRP application report . Despite PGF mitogenic property , evidence growth factor include PRP promote tumor growth involve carcinogenesis .</detailed_description>
