	<brief_summary>Coronary artery disease ( CAD ) frequent cause mortality industrialize world . Hypercholesterolemia major risk factor development progression CAD . While statin currently represent first-line , gold-standard therapy primary secondary prevention cardiovascular morbidity mortality , nearly 50 % patient Europe Canada treat statin achieve target level low-density lipoprotein cholesterol ( LDL-C ) tolerate effective statin dos . Recently , grow number study PCSK9 inhibitor wide spectrum patient hyperlipidemia lipid-lowering therapy , familial hypercholesterolemia , statin intolerance demonstrate consistent , profound , sustain reduction LDL-C great magnitude reduction compare high-dose statin regimen . However , effect PCSK9 inhibition coronary plaque morphology remain unknown . This study investigate effect PCSK9 inhibitor alirocumab patient acute myocardial infarction undergo percutaneous coronary intervention ( PCI ) infarct-related artery receive guideline-recommended high-intensity statin therapy . A serial , multivessel , intravascular ultrasound , near-infrared spectroscopy optical coherence tomography image study perform determine change plaque volume week 52 . A total 220 patient enrol study randomize 1:1 ratio either alirocumab placebo .</brief_summary>
