	<brief_title>Clinical Study Assess Safety Adequacy Effectiveness SpectraCure P18 System</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>In 2011 , 200,000 men North America alone diagnose cancer prostate , make one common cancer type . It affect live subject many way . After treatment subject PSA level closely monitor detect potential recurrence . A high number subject get recurrent prostate cancer . The treatment option recurrent cancer limit primary tumor secondary treatment partly depend treatment subject previously undergone . Treatment recurrent prostate cancer may , depend standard treatment primary disease , include follow : Radiation therapy . - Prostatectomy subject initially treat radiation therapy . - Hormone therapy . - Pain medication , external radiation therapy , internal radiation therapy radioisotopes strontium-89 , treatment palliative therapy lessen bone pain . The objective study demonstrate use SpectraCure P18 System ( Interstitial multiple diode laser IDOSE® Software ) verteporfin injection ( VFI ) safe treatment recurrent prostate cancer .</detailed_description>
