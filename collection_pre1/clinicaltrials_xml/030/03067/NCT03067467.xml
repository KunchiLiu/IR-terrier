	<brief_summary>This non-randomized , purely observational , feasibility study detect metabolic change patient brain malignancy use novel hyperpolarized [ 1-13C ] pyruvate MRSI .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Metabolic Characteristics Brain Tumors Using Hyperpolarized Carbon-13 Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopic Imaging ( MRSI )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The aim pilot study test hypothesis patient brain malignancy present alter [ 1-13C ] lactate 13C-bicarbonate production infuse hyperpolarized [ 1-13C ] pyruvate tumor compare normal-appearing brain region . To achieve aim investigator assess metabolic phenotype cancer patient brain tumor ( n = 8 ) healthy control subject ( n = 8 ) . Total target enrollment set 25 subject allow attrition screen failure . During image session , follow localization tumor brain , tissue characteristic morphological change evaluate 1H MRI . Then , cerebral metabolism assess utilizing 13C MRSI intravenous injection hyperpolarized [ 1-13C ] pyruvate . Finally , contrast-enhanced 1H MRI acquire . The study agent , hyperpolarized [ 1-13C ] pyruvate , administer Food Drug Administration ( FDA ) Investigational New Drug ( IND ) , approve 1/3/2017 ( IND # 133229 ) . Preliminary data human essential secure large scale funding require clinical study . The investigator believe ability measure metabolic shift vivo could major significance assess efficacy multiple anti-tumor therapy currently development target reverse Warburg effect mean control tumor growth . Brain tumor application Advanced Imaging Research Center , Harold C. Simmons Comprehensive Cancer Center Neuro-Oncology Program Development Neurological Surgery UT Southwestern Medical Center offer today unique opportunity lead globally translational scientific effort field .</detailed_description>
