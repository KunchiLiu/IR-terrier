	<brief_summary>This project aim investigate whether increase step rate use reduce pain injury cause movement pattern runner currently experience achilles tendonopathy , iliotibial band syndrome , patellofemoral pain syndrome medial tibial stress syndrome . Many injury report share similar injury cause movement pattern . For example iliotibial band syndrome patellofemoral pain syndrome report cause increased side side drop pelvis inward movement hip . Gait retrain method change way people run order change movement patterns.Increasing step rate may present gait retrain method pose injury risk use across multiple different injury population . Studies show increase step rate reduce frontal plane movement pattern pelvis , hip foot well reduce sagittal plane joint angle ankle dorsiflexion . Based change movement pattern increase step rate recommend intervention treatment patellofemoral pain syndrome , medial tibial stress syndrome , iliotibial band syndrome achilles tendonopathy . Therefore study aim investigate whether increase step rate reduce pain change injury cause mechanic runner currently run patellofemoral pain syndrome , iliotibial band syndrome , medial tibial stress syndrome achilles tendinopathy . The aim project use simple gait intervention , increase step rate investigate technique change reduce pain immediately , short term follow long term follow . The project also look whether increased step rate maintain follow whether change movement pattern propose cause injury . Runners recruit local running club competition use poster advertisement run club email run club</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>All data collect university Salford podiatry clinic gait laboratory . Participants recruit run club race via poster advertisement send via email run club advertisement club . Also participants present run performance clinic patellofemoral pain syndrome , iliotibial band syndrome , medial tibial stress syndrome achilles tendonopathy invite take part research study investigate effect gait retrain injury . Participants agree take part send email confirm appointment along information sheet detail study encourage read attend appointment . They contact detail lead researcher wish ask question The objective address via follow data collection procedure : On arrive run clinic participant inform gait retrain intervention aim reduce pain run risk retrain protocol affect pain . If improvement symptoms follow gait retrain direct appropriate medical service management . Participants informed procedure give chance read information sheet detail procedure involve . If reading information sheet participant wish take part terminate appointment time . Before data collection begin participant sign consent form , run history form health screening questionnaire complete qualified physiotherapist order ass patient suitability complete assessment risk health . Procedures : Participants attend two visit 4 week apart . The first visit consist initial assessment data collection retrain session . Detailed . The second visit consist procedure initial assessment . Initial Assessment data collection : Participants complete appropriate self report outcome measure : iliotibial band syndrome patellofemoral pain syndrome complete Lower extremity Functional Index Anterior Knee Pain Scale . If present medial tibial stress syndrome complete medial tibial stress syndrome score Lower Extremity Functional Index . If present achilles tendonopathy complete VISA - A score Lower Extremity Functional Index . Before run retroreflective marker attach subject specific point body : shoe , ankle joint , knee joint , great trochanter hip , thigh , low leg , pelvis ( anterior superior iliac spine , posterior superior iliac spine , iliac crest ) , lumbar spine , thoracic spine , sternum acromion process shoulder . This marker placement accord protocol previously establish validate project undertaken University Salford . A qualysis motion capture system use track movement marker participant run treadmill . Once marker data collect use custom software calculate kinematic ( joint movement ) pattern person . Participants require run treadmill two different speed ( 3.2 , 3.8m/s ) . These speed choose base run speed use previous research allow comparability study . If participant feel unable run speed run self select run speed . They give 6 minute accommodation period run treadmill 3.2m/s . At point data collect 1 minute run order gain data ten step run right leave foot . Speed increase 3.8m/s give 1 minute accommodation period data collect minute run . A qualified physiotherapist monitor patient feel ok continue 2 minute interval . At end data collection run speed participant ask rate current level pain scale 0 = pain 10 = sever pain . If point participant pain exceeds 8 10 participant feel longer continue run data collection terminate . Steps identified foot marker contact treadmill , ten step collect data average across trial right leave foot . During data collection injure participant ask rate current level pain run use numerical rating scale 0 = pain 10 = sever pain . Retraining Session : Once data collect participant ask run 5 minute speed increased step rate condition data collect final 1 minute trial . Step rate calculate number step per minute . Step rate increase 10 % participant instructed run audible metronome ensure step rate increase achieve . Again end run speed participant ask rate current level pain use numerical rating scale . Following data collection participant permit 15 minute practise session run maintain increase step rate without metronome present allow participant adjust new running technique . Participants instruct continue current level run use new run technique . Participants contact detail lead researcher ( email phone number ) request provide weekly update regard run pain experience . This ensure patient continue improve , run increase pain able ask question may . If patient 's symptom increase informed stop run terminate assessment direct appropriate medical professional assessment . Participants reassess 3 week 5 week later follow procedure outline initial assessment data collection well 3 month follow follow procedure investigate long term improvement .</detailed_description>
