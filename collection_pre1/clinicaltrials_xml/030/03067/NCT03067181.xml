	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To evaluate whether strategy complete surgical resection follow surveillance maintain overall survival rate least 95.7 % two year pediatric , adolescent adult patient ( age 0- 50 year ) stage I ( low risk ) malignant germ cell tumor , least 98 % patient ovarian pure immature teratoma . II . To compare event-free survival carboplatin versus ( vs. ) cisplatin-based regimen treatment pediatric , adolescent young adult patient standard risk germ cell tumor . III . To compare event free survival ( EFS ) carboplatin-based regimen ( carboplatin [ C ] etoposide [ E ] bleomycin [ b ] ) vs. cisplatin-based regimen ( cisplatin [ P ] Eb ) child ( less 11 year age ) standard risk germ cell tumor ( GCT ) . IV . To compare EFS carboplatin-based regimen ( BEC ) vs. cisplatin-based regimen ( BEP ) adolescents young adult ( age 11 - 25 year ) standard risk GCT . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . To compare incidence ototoxicity nephrotoxicity child , adolescent young adult standard risk germ cell tumor treat carboplatin-based chemotherapy compare cisplatin-based chemotherapy . II . To refine validate novel patient-reported measure hear outcome child , adolescent young adult standard risk germ cell tumor . III . To assess utility use establish panel four circulate micro ribonucleic acid ( RNA ) universal marker diagnosis , recurrence response therapy . IV . To identify novel genetic variant associate increased risk platinum-associated ototoxicity determine standard audiology end therapy use candidate gene genome wide approach . TERTIARY OBJECTIVES : I . To prospectively determine correlation tumor marker decline ( alpha-FP beta-HCG ) clinical outcome low standard risk germ cell tumor patient . II . To prospectively determine clinical significance activation BMP , Ras/MAPK PI3K/mTOR signal pathway GCTs . III . To investigate prognostic significance establish panel four circulate microRNAs diagnosis , follow-up relapse malignant GCTs . IV . To identify integrated messenger RNA/microRNA profile primary malignant GCTs correlate poor clinical outcome . V. To evaluate significance tumor deoxyribonucleic acid ( DNA ) methylation class . VI . To characterize incidence nephrotoxicity child , adolescent young adult standard risk germ cell tumor treat carboplatin-based chemotherapy treat cisplatin-based chemotherapy . VII . To compare self-reported peripheral neuropathy patient-reported outcome child , adolescent young adult standard risk germ cell tumor treat carboplatin-based chemotherapy compare cisplatin base chemotherapy . VIII . To determine utility novel biomarkers kidney tubular injury provide early diagnosis nephrotoxicity compare nephrotoxicity cisplatin versus carboplatin . IX . Identify novel genetic variant platinum neurotoxicity , nephrotoxicity hematologic toxicity use candidate gene whole gene approach . X. Assess relationship hearing loss measure audiometry effect tinnitus assess AYA-HEARS instrument . OUTLINE : Patients low-risk stage I grade 2 , 3 ovarian immature teratoma stage I malignant germ cell tumor undergo observation transfer standard risk arm eligibility criterion meet . Patients standard risk 1 randomize 1 2 arm . ARM I ( CEb ) : Patients receive bleomycin intravenously ( IV ) 10 minute carboplatin IV 1 hour day 1 . Patients also receive etoposide IV 1-2 hour day 1-5 . Treatment repeat every 21 day 4 course absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . ARM II ( PEb ) : Patients receive bleomycin IV 10 minute day 1 . Patients also receive etoposide IV 1-2 hour cisplatin IV 1-3 hour day 1-5 . Treatment repeat every 21 day 4 course absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . Patients standard risk 2 randomize 1 2 arm . ARM III ( BEC ) : Patients receive bleomycin IV 10 minute day 1 , 8 , 15 , etoposide IV 1-2 hour day 1-5 , carboplatin IV 1 hour day 1 . Treatment repeat every 21 day 3 course absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . ARM IV ( BEP ) : Patients receive bleomycin sulfate IV 10 minute day 1 , 8 , 15 , etoposide IV 1-2 hour day 1-5 , cisplatin IV 1-3 hour day 1-5 . Treatment repeat every 21 day 3 course absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . After completion study treatment , patient follow monthly 12 month , every 2 month 24 month , every 6 month year 3-5 , annually 10 year .</detailed_description>
