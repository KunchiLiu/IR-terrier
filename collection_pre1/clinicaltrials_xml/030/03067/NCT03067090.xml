	<brief_summary>Osteoarthritis ( OA ) cause degradation deformity joint , include knee , hip , hand , foot . Approximately 55 % population 45 year 70 % population 70 year develop OA least one joint . The symptom dominate pain also stiffness swell occur . There currently cure OA , ultimate treatment joint replacement surgery . However , unmet need identify treatment option may delay avoid surgery . Aquamid Reconstruction ( AR ) polyacrylamide hydrogel ( PAAG ) non-degradable , highly visco-elastic synthetic gel , atoxic durable effect tissue-compatibility well tolerate mammal tissue allow vivo vessel fibrous in-growth . Experimental study support histopathological observation show AR exerts effect via integration time within soft tissue , combination vessel in-growth molecular water exchange . Intra-articular injection AR expect provide permanent pain relief improve functional ability cushion pad effect joint thereby reduce symptom improve patient ' quality life . The purpose study obtain information safety effectiveness AR patient OA knee .</brief_summary>
