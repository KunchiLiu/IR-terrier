	<brief_title>Involved Field Elective Volume De-Intensification Radiation Therapy Head Neck Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This study aim significantly improve acute late morbidity patient oropharyngeal laryngeal squamous cell carcinoma tailor elective irradiation region legitimate risk recurrence ( &gt; 5 % ) lower elective dose 40 Gy . Level IB electively treat unless involve pathologic suspicious lymphadenopathy . Level V treat unless two ipsilateral nodal level involve ( level V pathologic suspicious adenopathy ) . Levels III IV irradiate immediately proximal level contains pathologic lymphadenopathy ( i.e . level III irradiate level II positive ; level IV irradiate level III positive ) . We anticipate approach dramatically improve acute late complication profile .</detailed_description>
