	<brief_summary>Following realisation many aspect way live life , diet , activity level , amount screen time , potent impact mental health brain function 'lifestyle ' base intervention become topical medical research . In particular , much scientific attention devote impact physical exercise various stress reduction technique mood disorder . We aim extend work investigate impact compulsivity . We conduct pilot proof-of-principal intervention study . The study compare impact eight-weeks : 1. regular physical exercise + stress management activity A , 2. regular physical exercise + stress management activity B , 3. lifestyle usual . The participant cohort adult endorse mild-moderate behavioural compulsivity one follow domain : - drinking alcohol - gamble - eat - wash clean - check - order arrange object</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>This study investigate impact regular physical exercise stress management activity mental health brain function . It specifically focus engage activity might impact activity brain circuit associate compulsivity , help reduce compulsive pattern behaviour . A compulsive behaviour something regularly , feel pressure , difficulty stop even though benefit u . Having compulsive pattern behaviour common . It 's estimate many 80 % general population experience compulsivity point life . That 's u ! Compulsive behaviour range severity mild entrench , take many form . For example , gamble often wash one hand excessively . For people start mild pattern behaviour , glass wine every night stressful day , develop problem , like alcohol dependence . As many people experience mild moderate compulsivity would helpful accessible evidence-based strategy reduce compulsive tendency . One promising candidate physical exercise . In addition well-known physical health benefit , regular exercise also potent positive effect brain health mental well . Other candidate specific stress management activity . Certain stress management technique , brain training , meditation , psycho-education , music therapy , yoga , guide relaxation , promote optimal mental health , improve cognitive functioning help keep body 's physiological arousal system within healthy range . Some stress management activity may also help reduce compulsive behavioural pattern . Importantly , physical exercise increase neuroplasticity ( i.e . malleability brain ) , engage regular exercise may enhance effectiveness concurrent stress management activity . This research study investigate impact eight-weeks regular physical exercise pair two different stress management activity brain health , mental health , compulsivity . Both activity previously show reduce stress improve mental health , investigate whether one effective . As regular exercise stress management training time consuming , take part study reduce opportunity engage compulsive behaviour . As , primary focus study reduction time spend engage compulsive behaviour . Instead , focus whether intervention modulate aspect brain function associate compulsivity ( e.g . hippocampal integrity , functional brain activity reward processing ) , aspects cognition associate compulsivity ( e.g . affective processing bias decision making ) , indices body stress system ( e.g . cortisol awaken response ) , aspects mental health quality life compromise sub-clinical compulsive population ( e.g . experiential avoidance , general well , symptom anxiety depression ) .</detailed_description>
