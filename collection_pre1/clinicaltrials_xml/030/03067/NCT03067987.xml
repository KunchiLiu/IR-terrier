	<detailed_description>Renova-Erectile dysfunction ( ED ) Linear Shockwaves ( LISW ) device incorporate unique shockwave transducer operable deliver shockwaves treat region confine narrow rectangle . Shockwaves generation follow electromagnetic principle . Linear Shockwaves ( LISW ) , treatment erectile dysfunction evaluation contemporary medicine , It use last three year . The present study device call `` Renova-erectile dysfunction '' , shockwaves focus onto line segment improve organ coverage . Shockwaves produce `` Renova-erectile dysfunction '' aim leave right corpus cavernosa crus . The study aim determine safety effectiveness new type LISW relief erectile dysfunction . Rationale : Linear Shockwaves know bolster angiogenesis increase level vascular endothelial growth factor . Principal mode action use disease : - Coronary Artery Disease : Kikuchi et al.3 show significantly improve symptom decrease nitroglycerin use patient coronary artery bypass graft suffer stable angina . - Bone Healing : Haupt et al.4 show Low intensity shock wave treat group show radiological sign faster heal . - Calcifying tendinitis : Rompe et al.5 show shock wave patient suffer calcify tendinitis show 62.5 % partial complete disintegration deposit . Moreover , 85 % patient report improvement 24-week follow period . - Diabetic Foot Ulcers : Wang et al.6 show Extracorporeal Shock Wave Therapy ( ESWT ) patient diabetic foot ulcer show complete improvement 31 % partial improvement 58 % .Moreover , Extracorporeal Shock Wave Therapy show significantly well clinical result local blood flow perfusion , high cell concentration , activity Hyperbaric Oxygen group . Preliminary Studies : Contemporary literature show two important study field conduct Verdi et al . The efficacy trial study publish 2010 recruit 20 men vasculogenic erectile dysfunction give serial 2 session treatment 3 week follow 3 - week intervention period . At 1-month duration significant improvement erectile function measure International Index Erectile Function domain score ( 20.9 5.8 v 13.5 4.1 , p &lt; 0.001 ) . This significant result consistent 6-month follow . Moreover , pain adverse event note follow-up period . The second randomized , double-blind , sham control study show treatment group show good outcome control group measure use International Index Erectile Function-Erectile Function domain ( mean square root sample size 6.7 0.9 v 3.0 1.4 , p 0.0322 ) first follow-up . Additionally , penile hemodynamics improve significantly treatment group comparison control group ( maximal post-ischemic penile blood flow 8.2 v 0.1 ml per minute per dl , p 0.0001 ) . Primary Efficacy Objective : To evaluate change Erectile Function-Erectile Function score 9 baseline follow-ups 1 , 3 6 month ' post treatment . Secondary Objectives : To study sexual activity improvement lead optimal penetration follow-up accord : - SEP- Sexual Encounter Profile . - GAQ- Global Assessment Questions . - EHS- Erection Hardness Score . STUDY DESIGN Accrual goal : A total 80 patient Vasculogenic erectile dysfunction meeting eligibility criterion recruit Department Urology clinic . Duration Study Participation : The total duration study 7 months- include 1-month pretreatment ( washout ) follow period 6 month ' follow-up treatment . Screening Evaluations Procedures : The first visit patient screen medical evaluation . Patient 's medical co-medication history collect documented physical examination perform . Previous month 's blood test result review include general chemistry panel , lipid profile , hemoglobin A1C testosterone level chart review . Patients sign inform consent answer Erectile Function-Erectile Function questionnaire see fit criterion enrollment . In case meet inclusion criterion ( meet exclusion criterion ) , recruit study . Patients use phosphodiesterase 5 inhibitor ( PDE5-i ) last 4 week report medicine type dosage , data record file ( report prior consent gather chart review ) . Pre-Treatment Procedures Evaluations : Upon evaluate inclusion/exclusion criterion , patient recruit study randomize one two group 1:1 ratio ( randomization perform computer software maintain Department Urology ) . Patients randomized treatment group instruct stop use phosphodiesterase 5 inhibitor 4 week prior first treatment session refrain use erectile dysfunction therapy option study . They instruct undergo phosphodiesterase 5 inhibitor washout period 4 week prior treatment avoid use phosphodiesterase 5 inhibitor erectile dysfunction treatment entire study duration ( shockwave treatment follow-up ) . After washout period first treatment session , patient answer IIEF-EF , SEP EHS questionnaires baseline evaluation . Treatment procedure : The treatment session last approximately 20 minute may perform office environment . Treatment apply physician 's office . For session treatment detail ( see ) During treatment , total number shock deliver accord two treatment schedule follow : Group A : 5 daily session within week ( Monday , Tuesday , Wednesday , Thursday , Friday ( MTWThF ) , 720 shock treatment energy apply every session treat region ( leave right corpora cavernosa crus ) . Group B : Three session per week Monday , Wednesday , Friday ( MWF ) 2 consecutive week , 600 shock treatment energy apply every session treat region ( leave right corpora cavernosa crus ) Following last treatment session , patient resume baseline consumption phosphodiesterase 5 inhibitor , term type dose drug , remainder study duration . Follow-Up Procedures Evaluations : Follow-up visit conduct month 1 , month 3 month 6 last treatment session shall include : Measuring IIEF-EF , GAQ , SEP , EHS score patient clinic every follow-up visit Reporting record adverse event every follow-up visit .</detailed_description>
