	<brief_summary>Familial aggregation well recognize cancer . Though number familial cancer predisposition syndrome describe , nature inherit genetic alteration patient strong history familial cancer currently unknown , case childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia ( ALL ) . The investigator seek learn cause leukemia people family may high risk develop disease . By understand origin disease , good treatment may identify patient leukemia . PRIMARY OBJECTIVE : To identify variant gene inherit , altered gene structure and/or function , influence risk develop acute lymphoblastic leukemia ( ALL ) cancer . SECONDARY OBJECTIVE : To collect demographic , clinical laboratory information include detailed family cancer history response cancer therapy correlation primary objective .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Genetic Study Familial Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This study entail clinical interview , submission peripheral germline blood sample non-tumor DNA permission perform biologic study previously store tumor tissue applicable available . Participants diagnose cancer outside institution request sign release form allow outside institution send germline and/or tumor tissue St Jude available . For patient undergone stem cell transplant , buccal swab saliva sample request ( germline DNA ) . For patient active leukemia , non-tumor cell ( germline DNA ) may obtain use remission blood sample , skin biopsy ( obtain fibroblast ) may purify fluorescence activate cell sort leukemia sample . The skin biopsy obtain participant 18 year age old . In participant le 18 year , skin biopsy access already collect part another research protocol clinical care . All patient consider enrollment clinical genetics consult one study team member time family history take information genomic testing introduce . Detailed medical history obtain include limited demographic , clinical data include laboratory result , cancer history/diagnosis , treatment outcome , environmental exposure cancer risk factor enable phenotype/genotype correlation .</detailed_description>
