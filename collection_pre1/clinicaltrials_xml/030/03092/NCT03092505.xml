	<brief_summary>Initiation antiretroviral therapy ( ART ) lead short-term increase herpes virus-related illness include genital herpes flare , high likelihood varicella zoster virus ( VZV ) , cytomegalovirus ( CMV ) uveitis end-organ disease , herpes simplex virus ( HSV ) associate encephalitis . Herpesvirus reactivation upon ART initiation may relate immune restoration disease immune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome ( IRIS ) , etiology unclear . We hypothesize ART initiation induce herpesvirus reactivation cause increase cellular , systemic , localize immune activation alteration interferon ( IFN ) pathways initial HIV viral suppression involve reactivation . To investigate mechanism , propose document incidence clinical herpetic disease viral shed vaginal oral secretion HIV-positive woman initiate ART ass association viral shed clinical disease cellular , mucosal , systemic immune activation . We determine role IFN pathway herpesvirus reactivation follow initiation ART . We also evaluate potential impact herpesvirus reactivation HIV cellular reservoir compare residual HIV plasma viral replication cell-associated virus prior 52 week ART initiation . We propose recruit 200 HIV-infected woman initiate ART NIH Clinical Center ( n=30 40 ) Rakai Health Sciences Program ( RHSP ) site Kalisizo , Uganda ( n=160 170 ) . Women recruit regardless CD4+ T-cell count , presence opportunistic infection co-infection status . Pregnant woman exclude . During 8 study visit occur 12-month period , participant receive standard-of-care treatment HIV opportunistic infection . Blood , vaginal fluid oral swab collect study visit test viral level HIV various herpesviruses . Vaginal sample also use study difference vaginal microbiota woman without herpetic disease prior ART . Plasma sample test antibody level ( IgG ) specific different herpesviruses examine change anti-herpetic humoral response .
