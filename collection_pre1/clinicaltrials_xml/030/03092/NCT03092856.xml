	<brief_summary>This randomized phase II trial study well axitinib without anti-OX40 antibody PF-04518600 work treat patient kidney cancer spread part body . Biological therapy , anti-OX40 antibody PF-04518600 , use substance make live organism may may stimulate immune system different way stop tumor cell grow . Axitinib may stop growth tumor cell block enzymes need cell growth . Giving axitinib without anti-OX40 antibody PF-04518600 may work well treat patient kidney cancer .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Axitinib With Without Anti-OX40 Antibody PF-04518600 Treating Patients With Metastatic Kidney Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To determine whether statistically significant improvement progression free survival exist patient receive combination . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . To determine whether combination safe whether objective response rate ( ORR ) , duration response ( DOR ) overall survival ( OS ) improve result treatment combination axitinib + anti-OX40 antibody PF-04518600 ( PF‚Äê04518600 [ OX40 Ab ] ) compare axitinib + placebo . TERTIARY OBJECTIVES : I . To determine whether pre post treatment specimen collect trial demonstrate significant change tumor microenvironment enhance immune response tumor cell . OUTLINE : Patients randomize 1 2 arm . ARM I : Patients receive axitinib orally ( PO ) twice daily ( BID ) day 1-14 anti-OX40 antibody PF-04518600 intravenously ( IV ) 60 minute day 1 begin course 2 . Courses repeat every 14 day absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . ARM II : Patients receive axitinib Arm I placebo IV day 1 begin course 2 . Courses repeat every 14 day absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . After completion study treatment , patient follow 30 , 90 , 180 day .</detailed_description>
