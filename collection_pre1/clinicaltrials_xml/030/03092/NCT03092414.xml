	<brief_summary>The newly develop link color imaging ( LCI ) system ( FUJIFILM Co. ) create clear bright endoscopic image use short-wavelength narrow-band laser light combine white laser light basis BLI technology . This system obtain bright endoscopic image even distant view LCI intense white light short-wavelength narrow-band laser light . Short-wavelength narrow-band laser light enhances vessel mucosal surface pattern mucosa . Therefore , LCI may facilitate detection gastric mucosal lesion . Further study need confirm clinical utility LCI .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Linked Color Imaging Based CMV Diagnosis Gastric Mucosal Lesions</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>LCI enhances difference hue , red region spectrum , digital processing . This make red area appear red white area appear whiter . Thus , easy recognize slight difference color mucosa . Based previous experience , new LCI base endoscopic diagnosis criterion call CMV ( color- microstructure-vessel ) criterion propose , could use judge gastric mucosal lesion . LCI advantage detect color change mucosa , could provide valuable useful evidence make endoscopic diagnosis . In study , blind random control clinical trial design validate diagnostic value LCI base CMV criterion gastric disease .</detailed_description>
