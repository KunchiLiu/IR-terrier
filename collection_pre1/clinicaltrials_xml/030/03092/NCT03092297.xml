	<detailed_description>Evidence increase case Hb trigger 7-8g/dl may low te question arise whether individualize red cell transfusion strategy may benefit critically ill patient . New study show potential protoporphyrin IX-triple state lifetime technique measure mitochondrial oxygenation tension ( mitoPO2 ) vivo , possibly early indicator oxygen disturbance cell therefore physiological trigger red cell transfusion . The goal : 1 . Determining feasibility use mitoPO2 variability mitoPO2 measurement critically ill intensive care unit ( ICU ) patient receive red cell transfusion 2 . Describing effect red cell transfusion associate change [ Hb ] mitoPO2 physiologic measure tissue oxygenation oxygen balance 3 . Describing association mitoPO2 vital organ function . Included patient undergo red cell transfusion plan . However , red cell transfusion delay 2 hour . At multiple predefined moment data collection include blood sample measurement mitoPO2 take place . The result study immediately translate clinical practice . Using result , investigator design phase 2 diagnostic study , probably randomize clinical trial yield apply knowledge respect personalize red cell transfusion . Application ICU patient anaemia might might profit red cell transfusion . It lead reduction over- under- transfusion .</detailed_description>
