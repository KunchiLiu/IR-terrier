	<brief_summary>Background : Gastric cancer common serious cancer . Standard treatment chemotherapy drug . Researchers want see new treatment help . It surgical removal cancer heat chemotherapy deliver abdominal cavity call HIPEC . Objective : To test surgical removal tumor plus heated intraperitoneal chemotherapy improve survival people gastric cancer . Eligibility : People age 18 old gastric cancer tumor surgically remove Design : Participants screen : Medical history Physical exam Blood , urine , heart test Scans Tissue sample previous surgery Endoscopy biopsy : A tube camera go mouth stomach . It take sample stomach tissue . Participants might may get medicine make drowsy . Laparoscopy : Small cut make abdomen . A thin tube light camera insert abdomen . Participants sleep procedure . Participants stay hospital . They : Surgery remove many tumor possible . HIPEC 60 minute : Two thin tube put abdomen . Two chemotherapy drug give one tube . They drain another temperature degrees normal body temperature . Another drug give vein . Recovery 7 21 day : Participants tube stomach bladder IVs day . They get pain medicine , IV fluid , antibiotic , blood transfusion need . Participants visit every month 3 year , one year . Visits include physical exam , blood test , scan . They also include dietary assessment question .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Heated Intraperitoneal Chemotherapy Gastrectomy Gastric Cancer With Positive Peritoneal Cytology</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Background : An estimated 24,590 case gastric adenocarcinoma diagnose annually U.S . The peritoneal surface site metastasis find often time diagnosis common ( 40 % ) site recurrence . Laparoscopy peritoneal lavage cytopathologic analysis stag modality identify subset patient microscopic peritoneal metastasis prior consideration definitive surgical therapy Intraperitoneal chemotherapy employ advanced gastric cancer adjuvant associate improvement survival systematic review Objectives : Determine overall survival patient cytology-positive gastric cancer treat HIPEC gastrectomy Eligibility : Histologically confirm adenocarcinoma stomach Cytopathologic evidence peritoneal carcinomatosis Medically fit systemic chemotherapy , HIPEC gastrectomy Design : Single arm , phase II study HIPEC gastrectomy</detailed_description>

	<criteria>INCLUSION CRITERIA : Patients must histologically cytologically confirm gastric adenocarcinoma gastroesophageal junction ( Siewert IIII ) adenocarcinoma confirm Laboratory Pathology , NCI Must receive systemic chemotherapy , minimum 3 cycle maximum 6 cycle , prior enrollment Systemic therapy consist least fluoropyrimidinebased and/or platinum base chemotherapy Trastuzumab may add HER2neu overexpressing cancer clinically indicate Last dose chemotherapy within 4 8 week enrollment recovery Grade 1 chemotherapyrelated toxicity Documentation chemotherapy administration must obtain Subradiographic and/or cytopathologic evidence peritoneal carcinomatosis find stag laparoscopy . Documentation cytopathologic diagnosis malignant peritoneal cytology absence disseminate peritoneal disease must obtain . If cytologic analysis reveals atypical cell undetermined significance , repeat lavage cytopathologic analysis perform must demonstrate evidence malignancy . Limited peritoneal involvement find exploration final pathology deem completely resectable permit Age &gt; 18 year . ECOG performance status &lt; 2 Patients must normal organ marrow function define : hemoglobin &gt; 8.0 g/dL absolute neutrophil count great equal 1,000/mcL platelet great equal to100,000/mcL total bilirubin within normal institutional limit AST ( SGOT ) /ALT ( SGPT ) less equal 2.5 X institutional upper limit normal creatinine &lt; 1.5 mg/dl eGFR ( creatinine clearance ) great equal 60 mL/min/1.73 m2 . Physiologically able undergo HIPEC gastrectomy No history malignancy within 2 year enrollment except basal cell carcinoma skin , squamous cell skin cancer carcinoma situ cervix . Ability subject understand willingness sign write informed consent document Previous exploratory laparotomy laparoscopy tissue biopsy peritoneal lavage permit . Women childbearing potential men must agree use adequate contraception ( hormonal barrier method birth control ; abstinence ) prior study entry duration study participation . Should woman become pregnant suspect pregnant partner participate study , inform treat physician immediately EXCLUSION CRITERIA : Patients receive investigational agent Disseminated extraperitoneal solid organ metastasis Includes carcinomatosis associate clinically radiographically evident ascites ( great 500cc ) Excludes great omentum ovarian metastasis Uncontrolled intercurrent illness include , limited , ongoing active infection , symptomatic congestive heart failure , unstable angina pectoris , cardiac arrhythmia , psychiatric illness/social situation would limit compliance study requirement . Pregnant woman exclude study HIPEC gastrectomy study pregnant woman potential teratogenic abortifacient effect . Because unknown potential risk adverse event nurse infant secondary treatment mother HIPEC gastrectomy , breastfeed discontinue mother treat study . HIVpositive patient may consider study consultation NIAID physician .</criteria>
