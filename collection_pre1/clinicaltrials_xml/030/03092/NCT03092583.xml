	<detailed_description>Spondyloarthritis cover group diseases common clinical , genetic radiographic characteristic . Ankylosing spondylitis ( AS ) common , usually diagnose presence bilateral sacroiliitis conventional x-ray , accord modify New York criterion . Axial spondyloarthritis ( Ax-SpA ) mainly affect axial skeleton progress towards formation bone bony structure around sacro-iliac joint spine , lead gradual formation bony bridge sacro-iliac joint ligamentous ossification spine . Early form disease present modification sacro-iliac joint therefore , show visible sacroiliitis conventional x-ray . Thus , possible classify patient age &lt; 45 year inflammatory low back pain Ax-SpA , irrespective presence sacroiliitis x-ray . Indeed , inflammation sacro-iliac joint spine occur process ossification inflammation , detect MRI . This lead Assessment SpondyloArthritis international Society ( ASAS ) group propose candidate classification criterion Ax-SpA , notably adapt early form disease . Accordingly , patient Ax-SpA without radiographic sacroiliitis consider non-radiographic Ax-SpA . Classification criterion peripheral SpA also available . The determinant AS SpA complex , involve genetic environmental factor . In addition factor , several study recent year also highlight emerge role epigenetics pathophysiology inflammatory disease . The term epigenetics refers heritable reversible modification gene expression without change cod DNA sequence . This process may involve pathophysiology different disease clinical expression . Several different epigenetic mechanism may concur modify gene function . Changes chromatin DNA ( without modification encode sequence ) show important control gene expression suppressive permissive factor . Thus , DNA methylation could play role auto-immune inflammatory disease regulate gene expression , particularly cod pro-inflammatory mediator certain cytokine , thereby contribute dysregulation immune system . DNA methylation regulate activity DNA methyltransferase enzyme ( DNMT ) . In multicellular eukaryotic organism , DNA methylation associate chromatin repression , thereby , inhibition gene expression . DNA methylation evaluate across whole genome , also level specific candidate gene , gene encode pro-inflammatory cytokine . The level DNA methylation evaluate rheumatoid arthritis ( RA ) systemic lupus erythematosus ( SLE ) , `` methylated-DNA '' signature observe auto-immune disease . Currently , available data regard DNA methylation AS SpA general . In study , investigator aim analyse global DNA methylation patient AS Ax-SpA .</detailed_description>
