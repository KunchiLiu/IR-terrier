	<brief_title>A Randomized Trial Pembrolizumab &amp; Radiotherapy Versus Radiotherapy High-Risk Soft Tissue Sarcoma Extremity</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This multicenter , randomize phase II trial initial safety run-in test safety efficacy neoadjuvant pembrolizumab image-guided radiotherapy adjuvant pembrolizumab compare radiation therapy alone patient clinically localize extremity soft tissue sarcoma high risk develop metastatic disease ( tumor size &gt; 5 cm , intermediate- high-grade ; approximately 50 % risk distant disease 2 year ) . Histologies limit undifferentiated pleomorphic sarcoma dedifferentiated/pleomorphic liposarcoma base preliminary data SARC028 . Other term undifferentiated pleomorphic sarcoma may include , limited . pleomorphic undifferentiated sarcoma , unclassified spindle cell sarcoma , spindle cell sarcoma otherwise specify , pleomorphic spindle cell sarcoma , pleomorphic fibroblastic sarcoma , undifferentiated high-grade pleomorphic sarcoma , pleomorphicsarcoma prominent inflammation , pleomorphic sarcoma giant cell , malignant fibrous histiocytoma ( include storiform-pleomorphic inflammatory subtypes ) , fibrosarcoma , myxofibrosarcoma ( locate deep fascia muscle ) . Radiation therapy three cycle pembrolizumab administer neoadjuvant therapy patient randomize experimental arm . These patient also receive fourteen cycle adjuvant pembrolizumab surgical resection . Patients standard care arm receive neoadjuvant radiotherapy ( 50 Gy 25 fraction ) follow surgical resection RTOG 0630 .</detailed_description>
