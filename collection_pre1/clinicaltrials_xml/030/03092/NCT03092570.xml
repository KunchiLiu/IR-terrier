	<detailed_description>Cerebrovascular accident ( CVA ) first cause acquire disability France . Despite rehabilitation intervention , great proportion patient suffers motor disability upper limb . Recently , several study show post CVA patient exhibit great neural plasticity direct consequence condition . Interestingly , transcranial direct current stimulation ( tDCS ) non-invasive electro stimulation technique allow modulation cerebral activity . It show applied cerebellum , tDCS increase learn performance healthy subject . Yet , motor rehabilitation CVA highly rely motor ( ) learning . The cerebellar tDCS thus appear promise method enhance performance post-CVA motor learn consequently benefit post-CVA rehabilitation . The current study aim promote post CVA neural plasticity use tDCS order enhance motor learn upper limb .</detailed_description>
