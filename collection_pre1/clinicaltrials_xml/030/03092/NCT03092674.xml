	<brief_summary>This randomized phase II/III trial study well azacitidine without nivolumab midostaurin , decitabine cytarabine alone work treat old patient previously untreated acute myeloid leukemia high-risk myelodysplastic syndrome . Drugs use chemotherapy , azacitidine , decitabine , cytarabine , work different way stop growth cancer cell , either kill cell , stop dividing , stop spread . Monoclonal antibody , nivolumab , may interfere ability cancer cell grow spread . Midostaurin may stop growth cancer cell block enzymes need cell growth . Giving azacitidine without nivolumab midostaurin , decitabine cytarabine alone may kill cancer cell .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Azacitidine With Without Nivolumab Midostaurin , Decitabine Cytarabine Alone Treating Older Patients With Previously Untreated Acute Myeloid Leukemia High-Risk Myelodysplastic Syndrome</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To select , base overall survival , `` Novel Therapeutic '' regimens test azacitidine patient age 60 old newly diagnose acute myeloid leukemia ( AML ) myelodysplastic syndrome excessive blasts-2 ( MDS-EB-2 ) . ( Phase II ) II . To compare overall survival `` Novel Therapeutic '' regimens select phase II portion trial azacitidine patient population . ( Phase III ) SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . To estimate frequency severity toxicity regimens patient population . II . To estimate response rate , event-free survival , relapse-free survival regimens patient population . TERTIARY OBJECTIVES : I . To investigate association cytogenetic molecular abnormality outcomes regimens patient population . II . To bank specimen future correlative study . OUTLINE : Patients randomize 1 4 arm . ARM A : Patients receive azacitidine subcutaneously ( SC ) intravenously ( IV ) daily day 1-7 day 1-5 8-9 . Courses repeat every 28 day absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . ARM B : Patients receive azacitidine Arm A nivolumab IV 60 minute day 1 14 . Courses repeat every 28 day absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . ARM C : Patients receive azacitidine Arm A midostaurin orally ( PO ) twice daily ( BID ) day 8-21 . Courses repeat every 28 day absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . ARM D : INDUCTION : Patients receive decitabine IV day 1-5 cytarabine IV continuously day 6-11 . Treatment repeat every 28 day 2 course absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . MAINTENANCE : Patients deem stable discretion treat physician receive decitabine Induction . Courses repeat every 28 day absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . After completion study treatment , patient follow every 3 month 1 year , every 6 month 2 year , annually 2 year .</detailed_description>
