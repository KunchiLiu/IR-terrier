	<brief_summary>Objective : The mission Human Brain Collection Core ( HBCC ) gain insight cause mechanisms mental disorder . Study Population : To able conduct research , obtain brain tissue decease individual without psychiatric disorder . Study Design : This protocol provide ethical scientific framework tissue donation referral Offices Chief Medical Examiners , hospitals funeral home . The next kin contact give permission brain donation decease . Once tissue obtain , frozen , catalogue process distribution researcher in-house analysis . The HBCC dissects specific brain tissue base request . All collaboration subject approval oversight committee . Currently , HBCC leverage 1,000 brain variety psychiatric disorder non-psychiatric subject . Outcome measure : Outcomes vary specific collaboration , include characterization DNA , RNA , protein brain constituent provide unique information molecular level . The data thus obtain expect provide new insight brain physiology molecular pathology psychiatric disorder , possibly lead identification new therapeutic target .</brief_summary>

	<criteria>INCLUSION CRITERIA : Brain tissue need individual suffer variety neuropsychiatric disorder , include schizophrenia , anxiety disorder , suicide , bipolar disorder , depression , substance use disorder ( cocaine , alcohol , heroin like ) . In addition , brain individual without history neuropsychiatric disease need control . EXCLUSION CRITERIA : An assessment carry information available referral source ( generally Medical Examiner Office ) prior obtain consent . This information usually succinct , indicating decedent find , know , whether psychiatric obvious medical history . The following case exclude collection : Severe mental retardation . Well document , long lasting seizure disorder . Infections know affect brain syphilis , tuberculosis , exception HIV infection . The body decompose . We consider collect brain three day death . There obvious damage brain close head injury trauma ( gunshot wound , fall , etc. ) . There brain infarct , hemorrhage , tumor , stroke , brain lesion destroy normal brain structure . The patient maintain respirator ( ventilator ) 12 hour . Major sepsis . Serious renal hepatic disease . Multiple sclerosis ( MS ) , Alzheimer disease dementia degenerative disease .</criteria>
