	<detailed_description>Background : Kidney stone one common disorder urinary tract cause great deal morbidity economic loss . Because high recurrence rate , researcher interest find medicinal therapy prevent kidney stone recurrence . Vinegar consume worldwide food condiment preservative . The mature vinegar , also call black vinegar , inky-black vinegar age malty , woody , smoky flavor . It popular north China dipping sauce , particularly dumpling . Some study promote vinegar medicinal property , tonic may lower blood pressure cholesterol level . Our national epidemiological data China show consumed mature vinegar associate decrease risk kidney stone formation . Furthermore , previous vivo study find mature vinegar could inhibit renal calcium oxalate crystal formation rat model ( unpublished ) . These finding inspire u clarify nephrolithiasis prevention effect mature vinegar clinical trial . In study , investigator would like examine efficacy mature vinegar prophylaxis prevent recurrent calcium oxalate nephrolithiasis . Methods : A prospective randomize , double-blind , control , single-center clinical trial perform First Affiliated Hospital Guangzhou Medical University March 2017 March 2022 . Intervention : 80 subject randomly assign 1:1 ratio receive mature vinegar placebo . The sequence randomization computer generate performed hospital 's pharmacy service , whoever administer 5 ml mature vinegar ( Brand : Ninghuafu ) three time day placebo liquid type identical bottle . The subject , attend urologist , investigator aware study arm assignment final assessment outcome . From begin invention , participant schedule receive brief ( &lt; 10 min ) individual telephone contact per month weekly text message . The telephone contact conduct intervention staff follow standard script . Text message provide per week use remind participant invention group drink mature vinegar . Sample size estimation : According non-continuous sample size calculation formula , , P1 3-year stone recurrence rate normal group , P2 3-year recurrence rate mature vinegar group , P ( P1 + P2 ) /2 . According preliminary clinical data , 3-year stone recurrence rate normal group 30 % 50 % . Assume P1 =40 % . The vinegar invention would reduce risk recurrence three fourth . The 3-year stone recurrence rate mature vinegar 10 % ( P2 ) . Using 95 % confidence interval , Î± error 5 % , power 80 % , minimum sample size estimate 32 subject study group . To account subject lose follow-up study withdrawal , number increase 40 . Data collection follow-up : Each subject 's medical history take , physical examination perform , subject 's weight , height , body mass index , blood pressure , education , income , employment status , smoke status , alcohol consumption measure record . Assessment staff mask prior data assessment minimize potential bias . 24-h urine serum specimen obtain baseline ( value document average two set measurement perform randomization ) , 3 month rafter randomization , half year randomization , yearly interval 3 year study . Outcome Measures : The primary outcome measure time first recurrence symptomatic renal stone presence asymptomatic renal stone presence radiographically identify stone . In event recurrence , treatment consider fail , patient withdrawn trial . If recurrence , patient follow third annual visit ( month 36 ) . Patients required treatment thiazide allopurinol condition hypertension gout withdrawn trial . Recurrences consider either silent symptomatic . Silent recurrence diagnose basis renal ultrasound perform 3 month , 6 month , 1 year , 2 year , 3 year randomization . If renal stone detect , CT also perform . The imaging study perform central radiologic service , radiologist knowledge trial group assignment . A recurrence classify silent previously unreported stone detect absence symptom . A symptomatic recurrence define typical renal colic , episode hematuria , expulsion removal previously undiscovered stone . If symptomatic recurrence document basis renal colic hematuria , recurrence confirm radiographically . Secondary outcome measure include change 24-h urine composition ( calcium excretion , oxalate excretion , etc . ) , serum calcium , phosphate , creatinine , uric acid . Statistical Analysis : The analysis base intention-to-treat principle . Investigators use Kaplan-Meier analysis determine cumulative incidence recurrent stone , investigator use Cox proportional-hazards regression determine crude adjust relative risk recurrence . For analysis urinary index , investigator compare two group respect absolute change base-line value time point . These comparison carry use Mann-Whitney test . Base-line continuous variable compare use Mann-Whitney test Student 's t-test whenever appropriate ; categorical variable compare use Fisher 's exact test . A P value le 0.05 consider indicate statistical significance . All report P value two-side .</detailed_description>
