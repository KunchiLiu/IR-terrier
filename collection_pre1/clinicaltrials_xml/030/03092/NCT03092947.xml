	<brief_summary>Although acute kidney injury ( AKI ) frequently complicate cardiac surgery , method determine AKI risk lack . Renal functional reserve ( RFR ) , capacity intact nephron mass increase glomerular filtration rate ( GFR ) , represent maximal filtration capacity . We hypothesize preoperative RFR would predict postoperative AKI .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Acute kidney injury ( AKI ) frequent complication patient undergoing cardiac surgery estimate prevalence 36 % . However , clinician limit tool preoperatively identify patient risk AKI and/or progression chronic kidney disease , particularly patient normal rest glomerular filtration rate ( rGFR ) . Renal functional reserve ( RFR ) describe capacity intact nephron mass increase GFR baseline response stimulus ( e.g. , protein load ) . We hypothesize presence absence RFR could separate patient risk develop AKI patient better-preserved renal function favorable short- long-term prognosis despite identical rGFR . The aim study examine whether preoperative assessment RFR able predict risk AKI cardiac surgery .</detailed_description>
