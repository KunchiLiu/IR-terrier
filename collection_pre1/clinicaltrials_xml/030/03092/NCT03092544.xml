	<brief_summary>The purpose study identify type bacteria reside intestine healthy individual compare individual Multiple Sclerosis ( MS ) . There lot research autoimmune diseases demonstrated importance stomach `` gut '' bacteria important relationship immune system , never study MS patient . In study investigator aim show difference gut bacteria healthy individual MS , provide basis future research study diet affect MS effect `` gut '' bacteria . Additionally , study look effect dimethyl fumarate cerebrospinal fluid , plasma MRI MS patient take dimethyl fumarate compare MS dimethyl fumarate disease modify therapy MS ( normal control ) .</brief_summary>
