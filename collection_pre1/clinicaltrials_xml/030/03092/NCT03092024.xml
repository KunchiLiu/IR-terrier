	<brief_summary>The Scleroderma Patient-centered Intervention Network ( SPIN ) organization establish researcher , health care provider , people live scleroderma Canada , USA , Europe . The objective SPIN ( 1 ) assemble large cohort scleroderma patient complete outcome assessment regularly order learn important problem face people live scleroderma ( 2 ) develop test series internet-based intervention help patient manage aspect scleroderma , include hand limitation . In SPIN-HAND feasibility trial , SPIN Cohort participant least mild hand function limitation indicate interest use online hand exercise program randomize offer SPIN hand exercise program usual care . The core SPIN hand exercise program consist 4 module address specific aspect hand function , include Thumb Flexibility Strength ; Finger Bending ; Finger Extension ; Wrist Flexibility Strength . The program also integrate tool support key component successful self-management program , include goal-setting . The aim SPIN-HAND feasibility study collect data ass feasibility step need take place part main trial ; required resource ; scientific aspect ( e.g. , withdrawal rate , outcomes measure ) . Data use determine whether feasible carry main study whether change need make conduct full-scale RCT SPIN-HAND program .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Scleroderma Patient-centered Intervention Network ( SPIN ) Hand Program Feasibility Study</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The SPIN Cohort currently currently include 1700 patient 36 site Canada , USA , France , United Kingdom . It anticipate Cohort grow approximately 2,000 patient end 2017 . SPIN Cohort patient complete outcome measure via internet upon enrolment subsequently every 3 month . SPIN utilizes cohort multiple RCT ( cmRCT ) design framework conduct trial intervention . SPIN Cohort patient consent allow personal data use observational research , assess intervention trial eligibility , eligible , randomize . Patients also consent eligible randomize usual care , patient 's data use evaluate intervention effectiveness without patient notified patient randomize usual care group offer intervention . Thus , SPIN trial , trial status mask patient control arm , aware trial , patient intervention arm . The investigative team interact patient care provision outcome assessment , do automatically via internet . The SPIN-HAND feasibility study embed SPIN Cohort evaluate feasibility conduct full-scale RCT SPIN-HAND exercise program . Investigators randomize 36-40 SPIN Cohort patient least mild hand function limitation indicate interest use online hand exercise program offer hand exercise program usual care . Randomization occur time patient ' regular SPIN Cohort assessment . Eligible patient , base questionnaire response , randomize automatically use simple 1:1 randomization , use feature SPIN Cohort platform , provide immediate randomization complete allocation sequence concealment . Feasibility outcomes include patient eligibility recruitment number percentages patient respond follow-up measure . Use internet intervention describe presenting frequency logins time spend SPIN-HAND program . Analysis outcome measure include completeness data presence floor ceiling effect . Descriptive statistic use provide mean standard deviation measure . Qualitative information information relate management usability SPIN-HAND program inform necessary change intervention trial procedure .</detailed_description>
