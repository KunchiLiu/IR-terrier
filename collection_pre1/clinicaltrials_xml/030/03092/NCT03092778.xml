	<detailed_description>The purpose single arm study ass efficacy cryoablation therapy treatment mild moderate obesity test safety ( good bad effect ) procedure . The vagus nerve transmits hunger signal stomach brain , response transmits stomach expansion signal brain stomach.Investigators believe interrupt communication , participant could experience less hunger turn lose weight . The rationale use cryoablation treat obesity base investigator 's experience safely target peripheral nerve via CT guidance treat thermal ablation daily clinical practice . primary objective research evaluate feasibility safety ( time ) percutaneous image guide cryoablation posterior vagus nerve obese patient . The secondary objective consist temporal evaluation weight loss appetite procedure . This analyzed documentation weight , implementation validate outcome instrument .</detailed_description>
