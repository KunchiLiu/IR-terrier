	<detailed_description>Blood oxygen saturation percentage haemoglobin carry oxygen . It accept healthy term infant breathe room air oxygen saturation level 95 % great , similar adult ( Levesque 2000 ) . Blood oxygen saturation level carefully balance infant bear prematurely . High saturation level associate retinopathy prematurity ( ROP ) low saturation level increase mortality ( SUPPORT 2010 ; BOOST II 2013 ) . Current practice maintain premature infant ' oxygen saturation 88 93 % . After 36 week ' postmenstrual age , risk ROP greatly reduce target oxygen saturation typically increase great 93 % . Lower saturation beyond time associate poor weight gain consider carry risk develop pulmonary hypertension ( Poets 1998 ) . Many small premature infant continue require supplemental inspired oxygen 36 week ' postmenstrual age order maintain saturation great 93 % , call `` chronic lung disease prematurity '' . Some infant require discharge home supplemental oxygen . The need home oxygen determine measurement pulse oximetry prior discharge . A recently develop device , Masimo Radical 7 , widespread use preterm infant near discharge neonatal unit . This device accurate ( Bohnhorst 2002 ) , derive extra physiological measure oxygen saturation data ( heart rate perfusion index ) offer longer-term data storage model currently clinical use . In addition , Masimo Radical 7 analysis software capable count measure shorter-term dip oxygen saturation ( Sedowofia 2008 ) . An oxygen saturation study measure term overall oxygen saturation , and/or number , duration severity dip . Increasing use Masimo Radical 7 record oxygen saturation study preterm infant near discharge neonatal unit , significant number infant , reveal previously suspect episode reduce oxygen saturation frequently clinically apparent . Because dearth data record healthy term baby immediate newborn period , `` normal '' Masimo Radical 7 trace well define significance short dip oxygen saturation clear . Defining acceptable saturation limit depend complete understand normal : word , derive adequate reference limit hundred healthy neonate ( CLSI 2008 ; Pan 1990 ) . Multiple study oxygen saturation level neonate conduct , disparate device protocol , heterogeneity age , gestation morbidity subject preclude universal clinical decision limit normal oxygen saturation profile prematurely-born neonate . Furthermore , note , currently-used oxygen saturation monitor capture short-term change oxygen saturation . This study define preliminary reference limit pulse oximetry newly bear healthy term baby , order well able interpret oxygen saturation recording make preterm baby near term correct age hospital discharge . We assess feasibility data collection , use data inform subsequent large study .</detailed_description>
