	<brief_summary>The investigator conduct randomize , double blind , placebo control trial adjunctive dexamethasone initial ( 6-8 week ) treatment tuberculous meningitis Vietnamese adult . The trial address primary hypothesis enrol patient , secondary hypothesis sub-group enrol patient develop anti-tuberculosis drug-induced liver injury ( DILI ) . The primary hypothesis adjunctive dexamethasone increase survival TBM HIV co-infected adult . The secondary hypothesis current guideline management anti-tuberculosis drug-induced liver injury TBM result premature interruption rifampicin isoniazid ( critical active drug early therapy ) thereby place participant risk poor outcome .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Adjunctive Corticosteroids Tuberculous Meningitis HIV-infected Adults ( The ACT HIV Trial )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Mycobacterium tuberculosis cause ~9 million new case tuberculosis ~1.5 million death annually , around 0.4 million co-infected HIV . Tuberculous meningitis ( TBM ) severe form tuberculosis , kill around 30 % sufferer despite appropriate anti-tuberculosis chemotherapy . It especially common young child , infect HIV . There longstanding hypothesis death TBM result excessive intracerebral inflammatory response . The corollary hypothesis adjunctive anti-inflammatory treatment corticosteroid ( e.g . dexamethasone ) improve survival , demonstrate predominantly HIV-uninfected individual small number trial . Yet corticosteroids improve survival , whether HIV-infected patient , remain uncertain . The primary objective trial determine whether adjunctive corticosteroid reduce death TBM HIV-infected adult . Adjunctive dexamethasone might improve outcomes HIV-associated TBM diverse mechanism . First , may control early intracerebral inflammatory response , reduce cerebral oedema intra-cranial pressure . Second , may prevent potentially life-threatening complication hydrocephalus , infarction tuberculoma formation . Third , may prevent incidence anti-retroviral ( ARV ) treatment-associated neurological immune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome ( IRIS ) . Finally , dexamethasone may help reduce risk drug-induced liver injury thereby improve outcome enable uninterrupted anti-tuberculosis treatment . The current evidence-base use adjunctive corticosteroid treatment HIV-associated TBM restrict 98 adult recruit trial Vietnam publish 2004 . This trial randomize total 545 subject ( 98 HIV-positive ) report overall reduction 9-month mortality due dexamethasone 41.3 % ( 112/271 ) 31.8 % ( 87/274 ) ( hazard ratio time death 0.69 ; 95 % CI 0.52-0.92 , P=0.01 ) . While clear evidence treatment effect heterogeneity accord HIV status , number include HIV-infected subject low observe benefit subgroup small : 61.4 % ( 27/44 ) dexamethasone group die , compare 68.5 % ( 37/54 ) placebo group ( hazard ratio time death 0.86 ; 95 % CI 0.52-1.41 ; P=0.55 ) . There limited data HIV-infected patient TBM treat dexamethasone , finding study use corticosteroid HIV-infected individual form tuberculosis opportunistic infection suggest corticosteroid may cause harm advance HIV infection . There evidence corticosteroid may increase risk HIV-associated malignancy , especially Kaposi sarcoma . Furthermore , recent trial adjunctive dexamethasone HIV-associated cryptococcal meningitis perform Southeast Asia Africa find dexamethasone associate bad outcome , increase risk secondary infection , hyperglycaemia electrolyte abnormality , disability . On basis limit data international guideline cautiously recommend dexamethasone give HIV-associated TBM , acknowledge paucity evidence need additional control trial data . Our trial meet need data aim provide definitive evidence risk/benefit adjunctive dexamethasone treatment important severe disease . Our secondary objective investigate alternative management strategy subset patient develop drug-induced liver injury enable safe continuation rifampicin isoniazid therapy whenever possible . The investigator perform open , randomise comparison three management strategy aim demonstrate strategy result least interruption R H treatment . All patient enrol trial eligible take part study , exception know TBM cause isoniazid resistant MDR M. tuberculosis . Consent seek enrolment , option give patient enrol main study , 'drug-induced liver injury strategy study ' . Eligible patient randomise one three strategy : 1 . Observe : measure transaminases , bilirubin , INR every 3 day ; change/stop anti-tuberculosis drug unless transaminase rise ≥10x normal , total bilirubin rise &gt; 2.0mg/dl ( &gt; 34 µmol/L ) , INR &gt; 1.5 symptom hepatitis worsen ( nausea , vomit , abdominal pain ) , case go Strategy 3 . 2 . Stop Pyrazinamide ( Z ) alone . Observe , measure transaminase , bilirubin , INR every 3 day . If transaminase fall &lt; 5x ULN day 5 , total bilirubin rise &gt; 2.0mg/dl ( &gt; 34 µmol/L ) , INR &gt; 1.5 symptom hepatitis worsen time ( nausea , vomit , abdominal pain ) , go Strategy 3 . 3 . Current standard care ( current USA CDC guideline ) : stop rifampicin ( R ) , isoniazid ( H ) Z immediately add levofloxacin aminoglycoside ethambutol . Restart R ( full dose ) transaminases &lt; 2X ULN hepatitis symptom . If increase transaminases 7 day add isoniazid ( full dose ) stop levofloxacin aminoglycoside . If transaminase remain normal full dose R H , Z likely cause re-started treatment duration extend ≥12 month . If transaminase rise ≥ 5x ULN , ≥3x ULN symptom , time re-introduction R and/or H physician stop R and/or H ( depend associate transaminase rise ) . If neither R H use , treat levofloxacin , aminoglycoside ethambutol . If R use , H , treat R , levofloxacin ethambutol . If H use , R , treat H , levofloxacin ethambutol . The primary endpoint proportion time 60 day follow randomisation neither rifampicin isoniazid give ( subject dead ) . For example , RH interrupt 18 day participant die 48 day randomization , endpoint 50 % [ ( 18+ ( 60-48 ) ) /60 ] . Rifampicin isoniazid consider critical drug early TBM treatment ; inability use agent ( either bacterial resistance patient intolerance ) associate poor outcome . The vast majority interruption expect short one month strategy 3 ( standard care ) management strategy 1 2 delay time point interruption , long cut-off 60 day choose .</detailed_description>
