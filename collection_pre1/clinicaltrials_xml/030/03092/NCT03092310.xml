	<brief_title>Feasibility Evaluation Artificial Pancreas With Glucose Prediction Trust Index</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This feasibility study artificial pancreas ( AP ) system previously validate target eMPC HMS algorithm , addition trust index predict glucose value integrate portable Artificial Pancreas System ( pAPS ) . The system evaluate 20 subject , goal 10 subject complete 48-hour closed-loop session one clinical site ( William Sansum Diabetes Center ) . During session subject bolus meal snack perform 45-minute walking session . The purpose pilot study establish closed-loop insulin delivery target enchant model predictive control ( eMPC ) /Health Monitoring System ( HMS ) algorithms trust index predict glucose value safe effective , analyze learn improve upon accuracy predict glucose value , collect efficacy data inform future large study .</detailed_description>
