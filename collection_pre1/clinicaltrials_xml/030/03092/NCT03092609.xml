	<brief_summary>Anxiety disorder one common psychological disorder . Underlying anxiety increase attentional bias threat , identify causal contributor development anxiety . Given causal relationship , attention bias modification introduce treatment option anxiety reduce training individual direct attention away threat thereby decrease anxiety . Over decade research use approach , call attention bias modification ( ABM ) , suggest overall approach effective reduce anxiety . Although ABM appear promising treatment option anxiety , several factor limit effectiveness ABM . These include recognition individual-level need know underlying mechanism action ABM effective . Neuroimaging evidence suggest attentional bias visual threat associate network brain region include amygdala , anterior cingulate cortex , visual cortex . In human participant , experience-dependent neuroplasticity visible voxel-based morphometry base measure gray matter volume follow training . Recently , voxel-based morphometry measure gray matter volume link dendritic spine densityâ€”a know cellular mechanism learning-related neuroplasticity . Thus , voxel-based morphometry measure ideally suit measure learning-related neuroplasticity follow attention bias modification . In proposal participant ' level attentional bias , anxiety , gray matter volume measure complete six week attention bias modification training ( N = 50 ) attention control training ( N= 50 ) . The proposal aim ( 1 ) establish pre-treatment bias predict variability gray matter volume extend amygdala anterior cingulate cortex , ( 2 ) ass extent reduce extend amygdala anterior cingulate cortex gray matter volume follow ABM underlies reduction attentional bias anxiety , ( 3 ) Establish pre-treatment bias predictor successful ABM measure reduced bias , reduce anxiety , reduce gray matter volume extend amygdala anterior cingulate cortex . Consistent objective AREA grant NIMH 's focus identify validate new target treatment development underlie disease mechanism , current proposal plan involve student rural primarily undergraduate university research project aim establish neuroplasticity extend amygdala anterior cingulate cortex target mechanism ABM training outcome , could use objectively track training-related outcome anxiety treatment .</brief_summary>
