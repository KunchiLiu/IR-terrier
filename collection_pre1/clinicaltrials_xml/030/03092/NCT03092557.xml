	<brief_summary>This study design assess feasibility measurement local pleural strain 4 different anatomical site . The secondary objective study : - To assess intra- inter-observer variability measurement local pleural strain - To identify strain parameter demonstrate clinically relevant significant correlation change tidal volume Hypothesis : The analysis lung ultrasonographic sequence use speckle-tracking allows determination local pleural strain 4 predetermine pulmonary area .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A New Ultrasonographic Tool Assess Regional Pulmonary Strain</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Mechanical ventilation frequently use operating room intensive care setting . Although essential many case , mechanical ventilation responsible ventilator-induced lung injury ( VILI ) . The relationship mechanical ventilation VILI clearly demonstrate animal highly suspected human . The putative mechanism responsible VILI excessive pulmonary strain overdistension . Frequently observe mechanically ventilated patient , presence severe pre-existing pulmonary disease increase risk overdistension . The development tool allow early detection pulmonary overdistension would represent great asset prevention VILI allow safe adjustment mechanical ventilation parameter . Ultrasonographic image non-radiant , non-invasive technique already available intensive care set . Already used cardiac strain measurement , ultrasonography promising avenue ass pulmonary strain . This pilot study aim ass feasibility measurement local pleural strain 4 predetermine pulmonary area use ultrasonographic imaging . Following induction general anesthesia patient 's intubation , 4 different tidal volume 6 ml/kg , 8ml/kg , 10 ml/kg 12 ml/kg study . For volume , image pleura make 4 predetermined area . The site study : 4th intercostal space mid-clavicular line ( left right side ) , 7th intercostal space posterior axillary line ( left right side ) . For tidal volume , 3 consecutive respiratory cycle site record subsequent analysis . To assess intra- inter-observer variability , 10 ml/kg tidal volume , examination immediately repeat second observer 4 predetermine site . The first observer also return repeat examination site . Mechanical ventilation parameter standardize throughout study follow : volume-controlled ventilation , respiratory rate 12 breath per minute adjust obtain expired CO2 30 40 mm Hg , initial inspire oxygen fraction 40 % adjust 40 % 80 % obtain oxygen saturation â‰¥ 92 % positive end-expiratory pressure 6 cm H2O . In event desaturation ( saturation inferior 90 % ) despite increase inspire oxygen fraction , study stop adjustment mechanical ventilation parameter leave attend anesthesiologist 's discretion . Lung ultrasonography perform principal investigator co-investigator use Terason ( Teratech Corporation , Burlington , MA ) device 12L5 linear ultrasound probe . For image , probe orient perpendicularly ribs pleura pointer towards participant 's head . Depth adjust order pleural line center screen . The beam 's focal zone position level pleural line . A 12 MHz frequency use . Using reference ultrasonographic image , experience lung ultrasonographer segment pleura . From image , algorithm define region interest follow throughout rest image video sequence . Thereafter , algorithm calculate various component pulmonary strain relation tidal volume . An experienced technician visually validate speckle-tracking .</detailed_description>
