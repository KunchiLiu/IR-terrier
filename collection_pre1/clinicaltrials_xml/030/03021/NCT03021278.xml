	<brief_title>Tactile Acuity Experimentally Induced Acute Low Back Pain</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Healthy male participant recruit Academy Physical Education Katowice . Each participant assess . All participant ask provide write informed consent participation prior experimental procedure na√Øve experimental hypothesis . The plan research project previously approve local bioethical committee . Between-subject ( real-injection , sham-injection control group ) within-subject ( assessment 1 versus assessment 2 3 ) design use purpose experiment . After screen procedure preparation phase , participant randomly assign one three group : control , saline injection sham-injection . Groups differ term specific manipulation : experimental group receive intra-muscular saline injection , sham-injection group stimulate pinprick sensation produce PinPrick device . No manipulation take place control group allow control learn effect . In fact , participant inform study include two branch assign either group pain evoke result injection control group without noxious stimulus . Not reveal sham-injection condition allow comparison nociceptive ( injection ) non-nociceptive ( sham-injection ) condition . Because previous study investigate tactile acuity change acute low back pain , sample size calculation base data systematic review meta-analysis ( Adamczyk et al. , review ) previous cross-sectional data among healthy control ( Adamczyk et al. , 2016 ) . Based report mean difference 9.49mm chronic low back pain patient healthy control standard deviation 9.90mm , total sample size 57 participant ( 19 per group ) require detect significant effect . Power calculation perform specific planned-comparison test describe detailed 'statistical analysis ' section . Calculation perform G*Power ( G*Power 3.1.9.2 statistical software ) alpha level set =0.05 80 % power . Baseline difference descriptive statistic analyse one-way analysis variance ( ANOVA ) 'group ' between-subject factor . Further statistical comparison perform use repeated-measures ANOVA design , 'group ' ( real-injection , sham-injection , control group ) between-subject factor repeat measure ( assessment 1 , 2 3 ) within-subject factor . In order test hypothesis tactile acuity alteration pain induction , F-tests follow planned comparison data assessment 1 versus assessment 2 experimental group . To determine whether magnitude tactile acuity alteration differ group , plan comparison perform difference tactile acuity ( assessment 1 vs. assessment 2 ) real-injection sham-injection group real-injection control group . Bonferroni correction use multiple planned comparison . Forward , stepwise multiple regression perform determine degree tactile acuity change predict either pain intensity size distribution . All analysis conduct use STATISTICA data analysis software , version 12 ( StatSoft Inc. , Tulsa , OK , USA ) . The level significance set p &lt; 0.05 .</detailed_description>
