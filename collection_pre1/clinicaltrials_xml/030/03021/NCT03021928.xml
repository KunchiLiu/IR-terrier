	<brief_summary>Title : Optimal Delay Time Initiate Anticoagulation Ischemic Stroke Atrial Fibrillation ( START ) : pragmatic , adaptive randomize clinical trial . Primary Objective : • To determine optimal time initiate anticoagulation Non-Vitamin K Oral Anticoagulant ( NOAC ) ischemic stroke patient non-valvular atrial fibrillation . Secondary Objectives : - To compare rate primary adverse outcome per protocol analysis - To compare 30 day clinical outcome modify Rankin scale among time-to-treatment group - To compare 90 day clinical outcome modify Rankin scale among time-to-treatment group - To explore optimal timing subgroup age , sex , outcome category , NOAC choice</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Long-term oral anticoagulation standard secondary stroke prevention patient atrial fibrillation ( AFib ) . However , limited data consensus timing initiate anticoagulation therapy , concern start soon risk symptomatic hemorrhagic transformation . These data derive almost exclusively heparins Vitamin K antagonist ( e.g. , warfarin ) . Now NOACs become mainstay stroke prophylaxis AFib rapid consistent anticoagulation few stroke ( hemorrhagic especially ) , question optimal timing NOAC initiation increase importance . The primary aim determine time-to-treatment interval low associate risk adverse event context anticoagulation therapy NOACs acute stroke patient non-valvular AFib . The question investigate prospective , adaptive , randomize , control `` dose-exploration '' trial time treatment NOAC therapy treat incremental `` dose '' . An adaptive , pragmatic trial perform deviate treating physician ' usual practice except randomize time start NOAC . Data collection limit field necessary plan primary secondary analysis . The composite primary outcome event follow within 30 day index stroke : Ischemic Events ( symptomatic ischemic stroke systemic embolism ) , Hemorrhagic Events ( symptomatic hemorrhagic transformation index ischemic stroke , symptomatic intracranial hemorrhage , major extracranial hemorrhage ) , all-cause mortality . Four time-to-treatment interval , i.e . study arm , 2 14 day investigate : 60 hour , 132 hour , 228 hour , 324 hour . An innovative adaptive design use include response adaptive randomization model ischemic hemorrhagic outcome event . The ischemic hemorrhagic event within composite primary endpoint model separately use know monotonic property risk event increase ( ischemic ) decrease ( hemorrhage ) time-to-treatment interval lengthen . Interim analyse occur every 50 subject randomize , primary outcome analyze new randomization probability calculate favor arm well risk-profile .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>1 . New ischemic stroke disable neurological deficit lesion diameter brain image &gt; 1.5 cm . 2 . Nonvalvular atrial fibrillation ( paroxysmal , persistent , permanent ) . 3 . Not currently anticoagulated ( except DVT prophylaxis ) . 4 . Treating physician plan anticoagulate novel oral anticoagulant ( NOAC ) : apixaban , dabigatran , edoxaban , rivaroxaban , NOAC . 5 . Qualifying brain CT MRI scan &lt; 48hr stroke onset ( time last know well ) . If patient treat thrombolytic endovascular therapy stroke , qualify scan performed 1836 hour therapy rule clinically significant hemorrhagic transformation . This group patient must qualify NIHSS assessment perform time scan . 6 . Ability randomize within 60 hour symptom onset . 1 . Primary intracerebral hemorrhage qualify neuroimaging . Note : Hemorrhagic transformation primarily ischemic stroke may include per Investigator ` judgment . Sporadic microbleeds may include per Investigator ` judgment . As general recommendation , cerebral microbleed consider ≤ 5mm , sometimes 10mm , great diameter gradient recall echo ( GRE ) , T2* , MRI sequence . Any blood visualize CT classify macrobleed 2 . Infarct volume ( estimate ) great 50 % middle cerebral artery territory qualify scan . 3 . NIHSS &lt; 4 &gt; 23 prior enrollment . Note : For patient thrombolytic endovascular therapy , qualify NIHSS assessment obtain concurrently qualify scan 18 36 hour follow therapy . 4 . Anticipated need major surgery next 30 day would require delay , discontinuation , extend suspension anticoagulant . 5 . Symptomatic edema expect size location ischemic stroke . 6 . Decreased level consciousness present expect . 7 . Any intracranial hemorrhage within previous 6 month . 8 . Life expectancy le 90 day . 9 . Followup person telephone 90 day feasible .</criteria>
