	<brief_title>Aurinia Renal Response Active Lupus With Orelvo ( Voclosporin )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The aim current study investigate whether Orelvo , add standard care treatment active lupus nephritis ( LN ) , able reduce disease activity treatment period 24 week . The background therapy MMF initial treatment IV methylprednisolone , follow reduce course oral corticosteroid . Subjects active , flare LN eligible enter study . They require diagnosis LN accord establish diagnostic criterion clinical biopsy feature suggestive active nephritis . Efficacy assessed ability drug combination reduce level proteinuria ( measure urine protein/creatinine ratio ( UPCR ) demonstrate acceptable safety profile .</detailed_description>
