	<brief_summary>The SARA-OBS single arm phase 2 clinical trial , investigational product therapeutic intervention conduct three European country , ( Belgium , France Italy ) , US . 300 community dwell old adult ( men women≥65 year ) reporting loss physical function risk mobility disability , undergo mobility functional evaluation Dual-energy X-ray Absorptiometry DXA scan body composition determination twice , six-month interval . Participants age ≥ 65 year complain poor physical function select perform SPPB ( Short Physical Performance Battery ) test . Those SPPB score ≤ 8/12 select perform body composition analysis DXA Scan . Participants ALM/BMI &lt; 0.789 men 0.512 woman include . The investigational phase comprise two main visit : inclusion visit 6-month visit . Both 6-minute walk distance test 400-metre walk test administer main visit .

	<detailed_description>The SARA-OBS phase 2 clinical trial , investigational product therapeutic intervention . It conduct three European country , Belgium , France Italy , US . 300 community dwell old adult ( men women≥65 year ) reporting loss physical function risk mobility disability , undergo mobility functional evaluation Dual-energy X-ray Absorptiometry DXA scan body composition determination twice , six-month interval . The general objective characterise sarcopenia include `` sarcopenic obesity '' population older person live community risk mobility disability ; evaluate physical performance body composition view design phase 2 clinical study efficacy safety BIO101 prevention mobility disability at-risk community dwell old adult ( ≥65 year ) reporting loss physical function . The primary objective characterise sarcopenia include sarcopenic obesity , old person risk mobility disability . Sarcopenia define accord criterion Foundation NIH ; risk mobility disability operationalised Short Physical Performance Battery ( SPPB ) . For purpose , 6-minute walk distance 400-meter walk test evaluate 6-month interval , absence therapeutic intervention . The incident rate change estimate sample pre-specified subgroup ( e.g . gender , SPPB baseline score , etc. ) . Two important Secondary Objectives also include : 1 . To evaluate muscle strength ( handgrip/knee extension ) stair power climb test 2 . To evaluate self-administered quality-of-life test putative patient report outcomes ( PROs ) : Short Form Health Survey ( SF-36 ) Sarcopenia Quality Life ( SarQol ) subject ; addition , TSD-OC participant BMI≥30 Exploratory objective : 1 . To measure tentative biomarkers sarcopenia poor physical performance , test correlation physical function change study observation . 2 . To record actimetry via connect wearable device , order describe daily physical activity possibly identify pattern predictive improvement/worsening physical function . Primary endpoint 6-minute Walk Test/400m Walking Test Co-Primary endpoint SF-36 SarQoL subject ; additionally TSD-OC subject BMI ≥ 30 .</detailed_description>
