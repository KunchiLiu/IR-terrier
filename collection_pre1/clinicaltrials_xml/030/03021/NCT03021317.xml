	<brief_summary>ACTHAR FDA approve drug MS relapse . The purpose study examine efficacy agent improve relapse measure advanced MRI laboratory technique : 1 . Advanced serial MRI study patient acute MS relapse . MRI perform baseline , 1 month 1st dose ACTHAR , month 3 , 6 , 12 . ACTHAR administer 10 day . Patients start ACTHAR within 48 hour relapse assessment . 2 . Serial immune assay patient acute MS relapse . Serum blood sample collect baseline , last day ACTHAR ( day 10 therapy ) , 1 month post 1st dose , month 3 6 .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Effects ACTHAR Advanced MRI Surrogate Markers Disease Activity Comprehensive Immune Signature During MS Relapses</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Multiple sclerosis ( MS ) demyelinate disease CNS . In vast majority patient , clinical course characterize transient attack acute neurological compromise , follow variable degree recovery . Each relapse leave patient degree residual disability . Higher number long duration relapse associate great loss function . Hence , imperative relapse optimally treat curtailed duration allow maximal recovery repair . ACTH ( ACTHAR IV formulation ) long use treatment MS relapse . ACTH equivalent efficacy high-dose IV methylprednisolone curtail duration MS relapse . ACTH advantage steroid short half-life much less deleterious steroid effect bone fat metabolism . Importantly , ACTH unique mechanism action immune brain cell melanocortin receptor ( MCRs ) , promote production regulatory anti-inflammatory cytokine support oligodendrocyte precursor neuronal function , could lead good repair MS lesion favorable clinical outcome . The study propose herein provide good understanding effect ACTHAR improve MRI lesion characteristic time . The complementary immune genetic study provide evidence mechanism action ( MOA ) ACTHAR improve immune dysfunction relate MS relapse . This one kind study , involve advanced/state-of-the art MRI techniques immune study assess beneficial effect ACTHAR MS relapse patient time . The primary outcome MRI technique determine whether improvement subsequent stabilization/repair time tissue damage cause inflammatory MS disease activity . Multiple conventional nonconventional MR image modality examine determine sensitive reliable detect microstructural damage repair time . The result study also greatly impact design future MS trial provide guide select appropriate MRI immune method assess treatment efficacy MS . In term laboratory analysis , follow examine : 1 . Determine immune subset expression CD4+FOXP3 Tregs CD8+CD28- T suppressor cell flow cytometry visit . 2 . Global gene expression profile MNC 913,000 probe visit . Bioinformatics include pathway analysis ACTHAR-induced RNA signature . 3 . Serum protein profile immune-regulated cytokine ( Th1 , Th2 , Th17 , monokines… ) neuroprotective protein ( NGF , BDNF , ACTH , HGF , CNTF , IL-10… ) visit . 4 . All data protein gene expression , well immune subset expression compare database generate therapy-naïve stable exacerbate MS. ACTHAR signature analyze base comparison .</detailed_description>
