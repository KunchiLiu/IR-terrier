	<brief_summary>Questionnaires frequently use online research , however recruiting , completion rate online participant variety culture demographic background challenge . The challenge great online cohort way observe participant beyond contributed online . Poor recruit completion result underpowered research may representative sample population . This trigger increase cost recruitment period may extend sample size reach . When recruit completion rate inadequate study may terminate answer research question remain unknown . To mitigate challenge , reminder email send questionnaire respondent . There uncertainty tone email reminder affect proportion recruitment rate . A nested randomized trial use test intervention tone delivery survey email reminder establish evidence base . This study ( ResponseQT ) propose link anticipate 20,000 person international cohort study , ( How Frequently What Format Research Trial Results Disseminated Participants : A Survey Trialists ( ResponseQT ) explore evidence effect research question , `` Does tone survey email reminder affect proportion survey participant recruit .

	<detailed_description>RATIONALE Dissemination plan process result study communicate stakeholder research . Stakeholders include health policy maker , academic , practice clinician health service worker , patient , general public , research funders . There multiple way disseminate research finding often consider share responsibility funders research investigator . Traditionally , focus target healthcare professional , policy maker , academic journal publication conference presentation . However , optimal knowledge translation depend disseminate result stakeholder way enable consider implication result . Effective communication active dissemination research result patient lay public essential making informed decision choice , sometimes consider afterthought . Furthermore , consensus dissemination patient member lay public mean , effective dissemination process whether research result disseminate relevant patient group wider public well patient take part study . Only clinical trial index PubMed 2014-15 participant enrol study include . We include screen question start survey exclude author non-randomised controlled trial , preclinical , first-in-human trial trial study participant . AIM To identify frequency format dissemination clinical trial result participant identify barrier dissemination . OBJECTIVES 1 . To identify frequency dissemination recently publish clinical trial result participant ; 2 . To explore format result disseminate participant describe researcher ' perceive appropriateness accessibility format ; 3 . To identify frequently research result disseminate patient beyond take part trial via advocacy group ; 4 . To explore frequency public/patient involvement determine format , content , extent dissemination plan ; 5 . To determine researcher ' perceive confidence disseminate result participant patient . This research contain study within study ( SWAT ) also know nested trial ( ResponseQT ) . SWAT RATIONALE Written communication questionnaire email reminder without verbal sensory cue difficult modify reminder without feedback respondent . It would helpful know kind tone researcher take increase recruitment rate . In questionnaire , tone could perceive perception researcher 's attitude toward reader subject message . The overall tone questionnaire reminder message may affect reader one 's tone voice affect listener verbal exchange . This could influence response completion rate . Added complexity , tone interpret differently different individual . Survey communications reminder suggest two approach appeal team victory sense duty benefit others participate building sense encouragement participation . In addition , test whether introduce duty encouragement second reminder ( generic first reminder ) make difference whether someone expose duty encouragement first reminder benefit reinforcement `` nudge '' generic reminder . METHODS This research involve explore way increase recruitment rate reminder emails sent invite yet respond questionnaire . A reminder send non-respondents email 14 day follow initial mail . An additional reminder send non-respondents email 28 day follow first reminder . The nested trial ( ResponseQT ) examine evidence effect tone use within questionnaire reminder email . The group participant randomize determine tone questionnaire reminder email . All potential respondent randomize one nine group . They receive questionnaire invitation email . Reminders non-responders assign accord group randomize : Group A Tone = Duty x 2 Group B Tone = Encourage x 2 Group C Tone = Encourage + Duty Group D Tone = Duty + encourage Group E Tone = Generic tone reminder X 2 Group F Tone = Generic + Duty Group G Tone = Generic + Encouragement Group H Tone = Duty + Generic Group I Tone = Encouragement + Generic All non-responders receive reminder complete questionnaire fourteen day accord group randomize . At twenty-eight day remain non-responders receive second reminder email . The outcomes recruitment compare three stage : initial response , follow first reminder follow second reminder .</detailed_description>
