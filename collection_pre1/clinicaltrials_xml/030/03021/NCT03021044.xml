	<brief_title>Physical Activity Intervention Patients With Reduced Physical Performance After Acute Coronary Syndrome</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>BACKGROUND Physical activity help prevent stroke , type II diabetes mellitus coronary artery disease , physical inactivity link decline muscle strength cardiovascular function . Despite evidence benefit physical activity well know , 61 % adult age 65 meeting recommended level physical activity . It demonstrate regular physical exercise benefit primary secondary prevention patient cardiovascular disease improve functional capacity . The incidence cardiovascular disease high old patient ( especially 75 year old ) . In Italy , life expectancy birth reach 80 year men 85 woman ; 50 year , life expectancy age 80 increase extraordinary 61 % 55 % , respectively , due effective therapy low mortality many disease . So , recommend guideline , physical activity suggest old coronary patient ; study demonstrate benefit physical training also old patient , study enrol patient age 65 year difficulties patient ' compliance mainly due logistic problem lack motivation doctor . As far know study evaluate impact physical activity intervention functional capacity old patient admit hospital acute coronary syndrome . Among numerous test propose literature functional evaluation objective measure physical capability elderly patient , Short Physical Performance Battery ( SPPB ) evaluation hand grip strength ( grip strength ) characterize improved prognostic ability easy administration . RATIONALE AND OBJECTIVE OF THE STUDY Patients low functional capacity ( frail patient ) cardiovascular disease , particular undergo invasive procedure suffer coronary artery disease , much high adverse event , death re-hospitalizations . complication , suggest need accurate functional stratification careful evaluation risk/benefit ratio invasive procedure . An early ad hoc physical activity intervention could improve functional autonomy patient early discharge benefit long-term outcome . The present study perform assess impact , evaluate Short Physical Performance Battery ( SPPB ) , program physical activity early discharge elderly patient age 75 year old low physical performance . STUDY DESIGN This interventional , multicenter , prospective , randomize , phase III study . The present study expect enroll elderly patient admit hospital acute coronary syndrome undergo percutaneous coronary angioplasty stratify SPPB score predischarge . At moment discharge screening : patient SPPB score 0-2 10-12 exclusively follow clinical visit every year . Patients SPPB score 3-9 evaluated inclusion visit SPPB repeat . If SPPB score 0-3 10-12 , patient consider screening failure follow clinical visit ; patient SPPB score 4 9 randomized standard care ( see ) ad hoc physical activity program ( see ) . The aim study demonstrate 6 month later improvement SPPB score ( least 1 point ) patient randomized physical activity intervention versus patient randomize standard care . All patient evaluate 3 year randomization . RANDOMIZATION At discharge investigator doctor study coordinator show patient study protocol , aim , risk benefit . If patient accepts participate study , sign inform consent evaluate SPPB score test screen evaluation ( T0 ) . Patients SPPB score &lt; 3 &gt; 9 exclude follow exclusively clinical visit every year . Patients SPPB score 4-9 enrol data collect study case report form . These patient re-evaluated inclusion visit 30 day later ( T1 ) ; SPPB score 0-3 10-12 patient consider screening failure follow exclusively clinical visit every year ; contrary , SPPB score 4-9 , patient randomize standard care group experimental group . There stratified randomization : - male vs. female - SPPB value 4-6 vs. SPPB value 7-9 - admission ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction vs. non ST-segment elevation acute coronary syndrome DESCRIPTION OF THE STUDY GROUPS - STANDARD OF CARE GROUP The standard care group recommend medication correct life style ( physical activity , low salt low fat diet , smoke ) order prevent cardiovascular event . In 15-minutes talk study doctor explain patient relative importance aerobic physical activity ( 30-60 minute daily , moderate intensity , example speedy walking , least 5 days/weekly ) aim reduce cardiovascular risk . Patients also receive brochure clear explanation . Study doctor study coordinator helpful question ensure patient relatives understand importance physical activity cardiovascular health . - EXPERIMENTAL GROUP , PHYSICAL ACTIVITY INTERVENTION Besides standard care , experimental group participate program physical activity intervention . Following hospital discharge , participant stable clinical condition refer cardiologist exercise-based secondary prevention program dedicate center . All patient report difficulty climb one flight stair without rest perform basic activity daily live . The ultimate goal program long-term promotion maintenance physically active lifestyle order improve cardiorespiratory fitness functional ability . Patients treat cardiovascular disease accord accept international guideline . All exercise test training session perform without discontinue prescribed medication . On admission program , quarterly follow-up , patient perform 1-km treadmill walk test previously describe . Briefly , test carry follow : participant instruct select pace could maintain 10 30 min moderate perceive exercise intensity use Borg 6-20 scale . Participants start test walking level 2.0 km/h , subsequent increase 0.3 km/h every 30 walk speed correspond perceive exertion 11-13 Borg scale . The test start rate perceive exertion acquire every 2 min . Walking speed adjust maintain select moderate perceive intensity . Heart rate monitor continuously test . Blood pressure monitor least immediately test . No individual exclude basis his/her performance treadmill protocol . Subjects walk perceived moderate speed &lt; 3.0 km/h perform test distance 500-m . The time complete either 500-m 1-km record averaged walk speed calculate accordingly .</detailed_description>
