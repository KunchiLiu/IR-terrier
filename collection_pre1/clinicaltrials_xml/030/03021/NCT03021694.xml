	<brief_summary>The importance protein nutrition momentous one health . Dietary protein essentially nutritional contain amino acid , body use build protein , well molecules essential life . Protein consume , travel digestive system absorb . They enter blood transport bodily tissue , therefore , detect blood sampling . There differ amount amino acid find different type protein supplement . Certain amino acid ( essential amino acid ) help stimulate muscle growth help maintain muscle mass function . It important understand quickly amino acid detect blood well affect blood glucose ( blood sugar ) insulin activity . Understanding effect protein type change level blood amino acid , glucose insulin provide helpful insight suggestion supplement use .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The importance protein nutrition momentous one health . Dietary protein essentially nutritional constituent amino acid , body use synthesize protein , well nitrogen-containing molecule essential life . The Recommended Dietary Allowance ( RDA ) daily protein intake healthy adult 0.8 g/kgBW/day . Younger individual participate recreational competitive activity , however , often attempt go beyond RDA use protein supplement help increase performance . For example , demonstrate protein supplementation conjunction eight-week resistance-training program elicit great improvement muscle hypertrophy strength compare carbohydrate supplementation untrained men . There 3.2 17.5 % increase muscle cross-sectional area quadriceps femoris musculature 14.5 30.3 % strength gain leg extensor . Furthermore , several expert group recently advocate certain individual , old person , increase daily intake 1.0 1.5 g/kgBW/day support preservation muscle function . Other condition also place great normal demand amino acid , hypercatabolic stress state , like experienced burn patient 's muscle protein breakdown rate increase impairment inward transmembrane transport circulate blood amino acid . It also find experimental enrich protein `` medical food '' comprise 27 % calorie total protein result postprandial increase MPS rate 5 hour ∼33 % ( 0.073 ± 0.023 % ∙h-1 0.097 ± 0.033 % ∙h-1 ) advance cancer patient . Thus , continually reassess new innovative nutrient therapy necessary extend finding exist study technological advance , provide nutritional support-to-support health . It well know dietary protein powerful transient stimulator muscle protein synthetic rate ( MPS ) whereby change MPS response feeding may regulate specific downstream target proteins mammalian target rapamycin signaling , S6K1 , rpS6 , eIF2B . A meal deficient protein , however , increase rate MPS rise bioavailability amino acid occur . In addition , source dietary protein show impact postprandial blood level amino acid . The concept certain type proteins `` fast acting '' `` slow act '' show affect postprandial profile amino acid appear systemic circulation . Native whey micellar casein dairy proteins contain similar amount essential ( EAA ) , blood EAA level increase fast high level consumption whey protein . Differences gastric emptying , digestion absorption kinetics micellar casein native whey suggest underlying factor . Nonetheless , micellar casein protein show protract MPS human . Despite significant amount information gain respect protein source , effect combinatorial formulation postprandial profile amino acid appear blood less well know . The purpose present study test novel blend micellar casein combine native whey determine post-ingestion aminoacidemia , glycemia , insulinemia young adult men .</detailed_description>
