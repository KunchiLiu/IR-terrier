	<detailed_description>INTRODUCTION : The objective present project test effect probiotic occupational allergic sensitization , respiratory symptom bronchial hyperresponsiveness worker student expose laboratory animal , i.e. , small rodent . Furthermore , study aim determine change immunological pattern use probiotic adulthood , could prevent allergic sensitization allergic disease . Probiotics use treatment various allergic disease , especially prevention child atopic dermatitis use pregnancy , neonates infant . STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS : This randomize controlled trial involve laboratory animal worker student expose rat , mouse , hamster , guinea pig rabbit . Subjects recruit laboratory University S. Paulo State University Campinas ( Unicamp ) . Exposed subject randomly allocate two group : treatment placebo . Both group follow two year . Subjects evaluate baseline , one year two year . Treatment : intervention group receive daily capsule contain 109 CFU Lactobacillus rhamnosus HN001 , Lactobacillus paracasei Lpc-37 Bifidobacterium animalis ssp . Lactis HN019 control group receive daily similar capsule contain placebo . Procedures : blood sample blood cell count , measurement total IgE level , specific immunoglobulin E ( IgE ) rat , mouse , hamster , guinea pig rabbit ; stool sample test parasites probiotic bacteria ; skin prick test animal allergen common allergen , i.e . cockroach , house dust mite , cat , dog mixed fungi ; spirometry ; evaluation bronchial responsiveness bronchial challenge test participant develop respiratory symptom . At end two year , change sensitization , bronchial responsiveness symptom treatment group compare placebo group consider effect probiotic . Data analysis : group result compare chi-squared test regard prevalence sensitization categorical variable . For continuous variable IgE level , comparison make Student 's test . These analysis perform 1- 2-year time point .</detailed_description>

Planning continue activity next 2 year . Previous laboratory animal handle 15 day longer . This exposure may sensitize select people susceptible sensitization . Sensitization laboratory animal ( rat , mouse , hamster , guinea pig rabbit ) . Allergic disease interfere evaluation study variable . Using immunosuppressive drug ( ex : methotrexate , cyclosporine , leflunomide ) corticosteroid immunosuppressive dos ( e.g . : prednisone dose 1.0 mg/kg/day ) . Cancer treatment neoplasia . Having disease cause immunosuppression diabetes , AIDS , renal failure , heart failure organ failure . Pregnancy , breastfeeding , willing take necessary precaution avoid pregnancy study . Use probiotic product study .</criteria>
