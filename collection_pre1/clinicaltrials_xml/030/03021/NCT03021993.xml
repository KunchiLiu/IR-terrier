	<criteria>Newly diagnose histologically proven locoregional OCSCC ( T stage 24 ) without evidence distant metastasis . OCSCC include subsites oral tongue , floor mouth , gingiva , retromolar trigone , buccal mucosa . Recurrent persistent histologically proven locoregional OCSCC ( recurrent Tstage 24 ) initially treat surgery alone . To allow sufficient tumor tissue immunological analysis , patient T1 OCSCC exclude . Eligibility criterion also include follow : Greater equal 18 year age ECOG performance status 0 1 Must meet screen lab criterion outline protocol Women child bear potential ( WOCBP ) must use appropriate method ( ) contraception . WOCBP use adequate method avoid pregnancy 23 week ( 30 day plus time require nivolumab undergo five halflives ) last dose investigational drug . Women childbearing potential must negative serum pregnancy test ( minimum sensitivity 25 IU/L equivalent unit HCG ) within 24 hour prior start nivolumab . Men sexually active WOCBP must use contraceptive method failure rate le 1 % per year . Men receive nivolumab sexually active WOCBP instruct adhere contraception period 31 week last dose investigational product . Women childbearing potential ( ie , postmenopausal surgically sterile azoospermic men require contraception . Prior immunotherapy treatment another anti PD 1 agent . Prior chemotherapy include Cetuximab radiation therapy . Previous severe hypersensitivity reaction another monoclonal antibody Women pregnant , lactate expect conceive father child within research period Known history HIV AIDS Positive test HBV sAg HCV antibody indicate acute chronic infection Concomitant malignancy except cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma basal cell carcinoma Unresectable primary tumor regional disease distant metastasis . Active , know suspected autoimmune disease . Note : Subjects permit enroll vitiligo , type I diabetes mellitus , residual hypothyroidism due autoimmune condition require hormone replacement , psoriasis require systemic treatment , condition expect recur absence external trigger Presence condition require systemic treatment either corticosteroid ( &gt; 10 mg daily prednisone equivalent ) immunosuppressive medication within 14 day study drug administration . Inhaled topical steroid adrenal replacement dos &gt; 10 mg daily prednisone equivalent permit absence active autoimmune disease .</criteria>
