	<brief_title>Evaluation Energy Drinks Electrocardiographic , Vascular Hematologic Parameters Healthy Volunteers</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This randomize , double blind , control , crossover study evaluate electrocardiographic , blood pressure , hematological effect energy drink . - Subjects contact PI/AI/SC consideration participation study schedule time come Clinical Investigation Facility ( CIF ) Interview Room , private room locate David Grant Medical Center campus , initial evaluation inclusion eligibility determination . - At initial evaluation subject inform detail study , present Informed Consent Document ( ICD ) HIPAA document ask sign appropriate form voluntarily want part study . Once consent , subject ask series question see qualify inclusion study . A baseline ECG , Chem 7 , peripheral blood pressure obtain rule everything normal sinus rhythm , normal potassium level , blood pressure less 140/90 . A cardiologist approve every baseline ECG allow participant enroll study . - If subject meet inclusion criterion approve cardiologist , enrol , allocate randomize participant ID number . They also give `` Participant Instruction Sheet '' . - Participants ask document normal baseline caffeine consumption initial questionnaire . - Participants randomly assign consume either two-16 oz . container Monster Energy® drink , original flavor , two-16 oz . container active control drink , two 16 oz . container placebo drink first day treatment . - The blinding randomization perform member pharmacy staff randomization code seal envelope pharmacy . The PI , AIs SC blind . In event medical emergency , unblinding particular subject may occur upon request pharmacy staff investigator study coordinator . Only request subject unblinded . - The control drink comprise equivalent volume . The active control drink 16 oz . bottle contain : 200 mg moxifloxacin ( dissolved tablet ) , carbonated water , reconstitute lime juice ( readily available supermarket ) , cherry flavoring ( regularly use flavor compound ) . The placebo drink except contain moxifloxacin . - The energy drink control drink repackaged member pharmacy staff identical 16 oz . bottle check another staff member . The active control drink make least 24 hour 7 day advance store refrigerator designate area within inpatient pharmacy . Study drink available investigator/coordinator distribution participant . - Participants inform `` Participant Instruction Sheet '' refrain caffeine energy drink consumption 48 hour prior study day 1 , 8 , 15 . They need similar work shift 48 hour study day ( i.e . day night shift ) . In addition , participant instruct fast state ( food drink water ) 12 hour prior study day 1 , 8 , 15 . - On day 1 , baseline ECG , HR , peripheral central blood pressure , lab draw obtain prior consumption assign study drink . The lab draw use determine baseline clotting time use ROTEM® analysis . After completion baseline reading , subject 45 minute consume two-16 oz . container Monster Energy® either control drink assign . The time clock study duration start participant issue study drink . Repeat measurement ECG , HR , peripheral central blood pressure perform 1 , 2 , 4 , 6 hour . In addition , second lab draw take 2 hour submit ROTEM® analysis determine clotting time . At 2 hour subject also provide study-controlled breakfast . During measurement session , participant also ask `` describe adverse effect may experience '' . All measurement take response participant annotate participant treatment form . - Participants may eat lunch hour four five energy drink consume . They ask eat approximately meal lunch 3 study day . They may consume additional caffeine energy drink provide study group measurements take 6 hour later . - A minimum 6-day wash-out period must elapse prior initiation second phase study , time treatment/monitoring process occur ( i.e . Day 8 ) . It repeat day 15 . - Measurements include : ECG , BP , lab draw , question side effect participant may experience .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Healthy male female , active duty military service member DoD beneficiary , eligible receive care DGMC . Ages 1840 year old . Participants must willing refrain caffeine energy drink use 48 hour prior study day 1 , 8 , 15 In effort recruit subject general good health , follow medical condition disease state exclude enrollment : Cardiovascular risk factor : Heart rhythm normal sinus , history atrial ventricular arrhythmia , family history premature sudden cardiac death age 60 , leave ventricular hypertrophy , acute myocardial ischemia , atherosclerosis , hypertension , palpitation , Twave abnormality , baseline correct QT ( QTc ) interval great 440 millisecond ( m ) . This determine ECG obtain initial screening appointment , review cardiologist questionnaire response participant . Blood pressure initial screen appointment baseline study Day 1 great 140/90 Hypokalemia liver abnormality ( AST/ALT abnormality ) identify initial appointment baseline lab value draw . Presence known medical condition , confirm participant interview discretion research team . Examples : Hypertension Thyroid disease Type 1 2 diabetes mellitus Recurrent headache Depression , currently receive treatment ( due possible drug interaction ) Any psychiatric condition neurological disorder include seizure History alcohol drug abuse previous 5 year Ever diagnose told renal hepatic dysfunction Concurrent use ANY medication take amount great twice week , include herbal product supplement , NOT TO INCLUDE hormonal contraceptive . If less equal 2 day per week , investigator determine subject include exclude base available literature medication . Pregnant lactating female exclude participation urine dipstick test use confirm pregnancy ( pregnancy test perform treatment session , day 1 , 8 15 ) All nonEnglish speaking / write subject understand study consent process exclude study due unavailability medical qualify translator time study . If subject refuse sign informed consent document HIPAA Authorization , exclude well . Allergy substance study design . Any medical reason discretion investigator would pose risk health subject .</criteria>
