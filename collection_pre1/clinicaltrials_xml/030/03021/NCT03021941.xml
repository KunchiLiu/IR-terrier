	<brief_summary>In August 2014 , FDA approve ELELYSO long-term enzyme replacement therapy ( ERT ) pediatric subject confirm diagnosis Type 1 Gaucher disease . The recommended dosage treatment-naïve adult pediatric subject 4 year age old 60 unit per kg body weight administer every week 60 120 minute intravenous infusion . As postmarketing commitment , Sponsor agree evaluate pharmacokinetics ( PK ) , pharmacodynamics ( PD ) , safety Elelyso ( taliglucerase alfa ) pediatric subject Type 1 Gaucher Disease . least 5 subject body weight less 15 kg ; least 5 subject body weight 15 less 20 kg ; least 5 subject body weight 20-25 kg Type 1 Gaucher disease dose 60 units/kg every week . When applicable , PD measurements child enrol PK study may obtain taliglucerase alfa registry ( PMR 1895-5 ) include organ volume ( spleen liver ) , hematological value ( hemoglobin platelet ) well growth ( height weight ) data . Safety data , include serious hypersensitivity reaction , anaphylaxis , well change antibody status ( ie , detection titer bind neutralize antibody , detection IgE antibody ) , also collect taliglucerase alfa registry .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Pharmacokinetics , Pharmacodynamics And Safety Study Of Elelyso ( tm ) In Pediatric Subjects With Type 1 Gaucher Disease</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This study ( B3031003 ) open-label study pediatric subject Type 1 Gaucher Disease characterize PK , PD safety follow infusion taliglucerase alfa least 5 subject body weight less 15 kg ; least 5 subject body weight 15 less 20 kg ; least 5 subject body weight 20-25 kg . The PK sample collection take approximately 4 hour complete perform one month 6 month subject 's first taliglucerase infusion registry study . The subject contact day PK sample collect assess continue new adverse event review subject 's concomitant medication . Body weight time PK blood draw determine weight category subject . Subjects enrol study assign unique subject number assign registry study ( B3031002 ) . This allow linkage relevant data registry study analysis study . For purpose study , baseline evaluation obtain registry study must perform prior subject 's first dose taliglucerase alfa . The Month 6 Month 12 evaluation perform 6 month 12 month start taliglucerase alfa treatment , respectively . Subjects eligible PK study ( B3031003 ) PD assessment ( spleen volume/size , hemoglobin/platelet count height/weight measurement ) immunogenicity data Gaucher disease diagnostic history available registry study baseline visit prior start taliglucerase alfa treatment . If liver volume/size available , also analyze necessary eligibility PK study . Pediatric subject prescribed 60 units/kg taliglucerase alfa every week physician recruit registry study . Subjects screen PK study time enrol registry study ( ERT treatment-naïve subject ) 6 month enrol registry study ( previously ERT naïve subject ) PD assessment ( spleen volume/size , hemoglobin/platelet count height/weight measurement ) , immunogenicity data Gaucher disease diagnostic history ( residual enzyme activity genotype data ) perform baseline registry study prior start taliglucerase alfa treatment . Baseline data registry study PD immunogenicity test define PD measurement ( spleen volume/size , liver volume/size ( available ) , hemoglobin platelet count growth measure ) , Gaucher disease diagnostic history immunogenicity sample collect entry registry study prior start taliglucerase alfa treatment . For secondary PD endpoint , spleen volume/size liver volume/size ( available ) measure use MRI , CT ultrasound , whichever standard care accord investigator . The method use measure spleen liver volume/size Baseline one use Month 12 . Change Baseline percent change Baseline Month 12 registry study calculate spleen volume , liver volume ( available ) , hemoglobin platelet count , growth measure ( height , weight Z-scores ) . For subject enrol study , safety data taliglucerase alfa , start baseline visit ( entry registry study ) continue 28 day Month 12 PD data collection visit , obtain reporting . Safety assessment study include collection adverse event serious adverse event data , include serious hypersensitivity reaction , procedure immunogenicity test ( ie , detection titer bind neutralize antibody detection IgE antibody ) well vital sign take standard care infusion . A pre-dose blood sample test antidrug antibody ( ADA ) day PK Sample Visit collect effort ass impact immunogenicity PK .</detailed_description>
