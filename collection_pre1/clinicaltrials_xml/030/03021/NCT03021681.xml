	<brief_summary>Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease ( COPD ) characterize recurrent cough , expectoration asthma , eventually develop chronic pulmonary heart disease , chronic respiratory failure even death . The current clinical treatment patient symptomatic treatment solve problem damage lung structure fundamentally . Recent study show bronchial basement layer cell kind cell bronchial epithelial basal layer position , specific expression Krt5 antigen regeneration repair lung function , cell activity similar adult tissue stem cell . Its division migration active continue produce new cell complement death type epithelial cell functional plasticity use direct repair bronchial alveolar structure . It prove bronchial basal cell transplantation repair damage lung experimental animal . The bronchial basal cell autologous tissue , immune rejection problem . Also bronchial basal cell derive adult tissue part body , risk tumor ( animal experiment , In animal experiment , bronchial basal cell transtracheal input 100 time human dose still tumor formation ) . In early stage , patient COPD ( 2 case ) , bronchiectasis ( 2 case ) interstitial lung disease ( 1 case ) receive treatment , overall effect good . Diseases alleviate recovered different extend.The study brush bronchial basal cell fiberbronchoscopy COPD patient culture vitro , bronchoscope transfusion lesion site . To preliminary evaluate efficacy safety autologous bronchial basal cell treatment chronic obstructive pulmonary disease .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>An Exploratory Study Treatment Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease With Autologous Bronchial Basal Cell Transplantation</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Between November 2016 November 2019 , investigator initially recruit 20 stable COPD patient . Primary evaluation include medical history , physical examination , anthropometric data , blood routine , blood biochemistry , blood coagulation , electrocardiogram , high resolution chest CT , arterial blood gas , pulmonary function test,6-min walk test ( 6MWT ) , modify medical research council ( MMRC ) , St George 's respiratory questionnaire ( SGRQ ) . After initial evaluation , investigator obtain extraction bronchial basal cell micro tissue 3~4 grade bronchus mean fiberbronchoscopy , purify selectively amplify bronchial basal cell reserve .The basal layer cell culture system partner ( Regend Therapeutics ) patent technology use culture medium contain special combination growth factor composite material simulate composite basal layer environment selectively amplify bronchial basal cell , type mature epithelial cell fibroblast could grow naturally . After period time , basal lamina bronchial epithelial cell store liquid nitrogen cell bank long time . Before applied patient , bronchial basal cell need go series strict examination . Then , bronchoscopy perform bronchial basal lamina suspension inject directly lesion site . Estimate change respiratory function ( symptom , sign , chest CT , pulmonary function , 6 minute walk test , MMRC , SGRQ etc ) serum index third day , first month , third month , sixth month first year follow-up treatment respectively , evaluate safety efficiency autologous bronchial basal cell treatment COPD .</detailed_description>
