	<brief_summary>Conventional chemotherapeutic regimen design aggressive B-cell lymphoma generally less effective applied mature T-cell NK-cell lymphoma . The treatment outcome relapse refractory disease especially poor . This single centre , prospective , non-randomized , open-label , phase II study evaluate efficacy pembrolizumab patient relapse refractory mature T-cell NK-cell lymphoma . Patients receive pembrolizumab 200mg i.v . every 3 week disease progression unacceptable toxicity . A baseline radiological assessment positron emission tomography / compute tomography ( PET/CT ) scan obtain commencement treatment . Tumor response progression evaluate physical examination , standard laboratory test , PET/CT scan accord standard criterion . Standard response criterion non-Hodgkin lymphoma use assessment . PET/CT scan do week 12 , week 24 , week 36 every 18 week thereafter .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Pembrolizumab potent highly selective humanize monoclonal antibody ( mAb ) IgG4/kappa isotype PD-1 , design directly block interaction PD-L1 PD-L2 . KeytrudaTM ( pembrolizumab ) recently approve United Stated treatment melanoma unresectable metastatic , progress follow ipilumumab , ( BRAF V600 mutation positive ) , BRAF inhibitor . Mature T-cell nature killer ( NK ) -cell lymphomas lymphoid malignancy derive T-cell NK-cell lineage . They less prevalent B-cell lymphoma . Interestingly , distinct geographic difference distribution prevalence . Nodal lymphomas include peripheral T-cell lymphoma , otherwise specify ( PTCL-NOS ) , angioimmunoblastic T-cell lymphoma ( AITL ) , anaplastic large cell lymphoma ( ALCL ) cutaneous T-cell lymphoma ( CTCL ) predominate Western population , account 10 % lymphoma . In Asian country , however , extranodal NK/T-cell lymphoma , nasal type , much prevalent , constitute 10 % lymphoma ; AITL , ALCL PTCL-NOS accounting another 10 % . Epstein Barr virus ( EBV ) infection find case extranodal NK/T-cell lymphoma , majority AITL , significant proportion PTCL-NOS , imply play important pathogenetic role . Conventional chemotherapeutic regimen design aggressive B-cell lymphoma generally less effective applied mature T-cell NK-cell lymphoma . The treatment outcome relapse refractory disease especially poor . In recent retrospective analysis , median overall survival ( OS ) progression-free survival ( PFS ) patient disease relapse find 5.5 3.1 month respectively . The efficacy newly approve agent pralatrexate romidepsin relapse refractory T-cell lymphoma modest , average overall response rate ( ORR ) around 20-30 % . Novel therapeutic approach therefore need group patient dismal prognosis . PD-1 blockade use anti-PD1 monoclonal antibody show highly effective relapsed/refractory classical Hodgkin lymphoma . Furthermore , clinical response also see relapse T-cell lymphomas treatment anti-PD-1 antibody phase I study . In addition , previous report show EBV infection may enhance expression PD-L1 tumour cell , EBV-associated lymphoma NK/T-cell lymphoma express high level PD-L1 , suggest EBV-associated mature T-cell NK-cell lymphoma may susceptible PD-1 blockade .</detailed_description>
