	<brief_summary>Antenatal care ( ANC ) , facility delivery postnatal care ( PNC ) proven strategy tackle high burden maternal child mortality morbidity currently witness sub-Saharan Africa . However pregnant woman utilize service . This study aim assess impact , cost-effectiveness , scalability conditional cash transfer ( CCTs ) promote increase uninterrupted contact pregnant woman formal healthcare system Siaya County , Kenya . The study cluster randomize control trial intervention conditional cash transfer woman time honour health appointment ANC , facility birth PNC visit new-borns reach 1 year age . Study participant pregnant woman identify first ANC visit ( n = 7200 ) , subsequent new-borns . Mothers child follow throughout health visit 3 additional time point . Trial cluster 48 public primary health facility , ( 24 intervention arm 24 control arm ) . The primary outcome : ) proportion eligible ANC visit make pregnancy ; b ) delivery health facility ; c ) proportion eligible PNC visit honour ; ) proportion referral honour pregnancy postnatal period ; e ) proportion child immunization receive . Secondary outcome include ; health screen infection control , live birth , maternal child survival 48 hour delivery , exclusive breastfeeding , birth space self-rated wellness mother new-born respective time point . Primary outcome measure abstraction health record health facility attend woman trial period supplement data collection use electronic base system comprise card reader system instal recruit study facility . Secondary data abstract woman 's medical record health facility supplement telephone survey administer three time-points course study . Additional quantitative qualitative data collect questionnaire phone interview process economic evaluation . This trial contribute evidence effectiveness cost-effectiveness conditional cash transfer facilitate health visit promote maternal child health Kenya similar context .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>1 . BACKGROUND A `` Continuum Care '' reproductive , maternal , new-born child health ( RMNCH ) include integrated service delivery mother child pre-pregnancy delivery , immediate postnatal period , childhood ( 1 ) . Assuring continuity care become key programme strategy improve health mother new-borns , important measure service quality outcomes prevention mother-to-child transmission HIV ( PMTCT ) ( 2 ) . Yet many country remain major gap seek care along continuum . Retaining woman continuum even pregnancy possible achieve sub-Saharan Africa ( SSA ) , 44 % woman make recommend 4 minimum ANC visit ( focused ANC ) ( 3 ) . Focused ANC schedule service , client adhere recommend timing repeat visit require , purpose service challenge . A number treatment provide ANC deliver sequence effective . Post-natal service equally essential , half postnatal maternal death occur first week baby bear , one four child death occur first month life ( 5 ) . In SSA , postnatal care programme among weak reproductive child health programme ( 6 ) . Follow-up treatment service PMTCT ; counsel family planning , breastfeed infant feeding practice ; childhood immunization achieve many woman lose care immediately delivery , current trend . A major opportunity alter low care seek behavior SSA exist however , since two third woman come contact formal healthcare system least pregnancy ( 3 ) . A strategy retain woman care , first contact pregnancy birth childhood period could thus alter considerably negative trend maternal child health Africa . Personal financial incentive ( PFIs ) offer broad base solution need tackle challenge low care seek retention woman care continuum . It tackle financial barrier care seek , well motivational barrier . A number study ( 30 , 31 , 32 , 33 ) demonstrate personal financial incentive ( PFIs ) help increase adherence lengthy treatment schedule . Empirical evidence support rationale ; although still emerge field . In developed country , pay people change behaviour demonstrate effective behavioural problem ( 10 ) . Notable success develop country TB treatment programme ( 11 ) ( 12 ) . In sub-Saharan Africa , still new concept . 2 . METHODS 2.1 Study set The study conduct Siaya County , locate shore Lake Victoria Western Kenya . The County make 6 sub county mostly rural , population 8.3 million people ( 13 ) . 2.2 Sample size determination A sample size 7200 woman provide 80 % power detect difference co-primary outcome intra-cluster correlation coefficient ( ICC ) either low ( 0.005 ) moderate ( 0.025 ) , take standard 5 % significance level . The expected prevalence indicator control arm range 30 80 % . The average cluster size ( 48 cluster ) 150 participant . 2.3 . Data collection method 2.3.1 Abstraction health record The primary mode data collection health record woman hold facility visit study period . With consent study participant approval ethic committee , health data relevant answer primary secondary research question adjust confounders abstract monthly basis participate facility quarterly basis non-participating facility . 2.3.3 Electronic capture health visit A secondary method collect data primary health outcomes electronic base system utilized primarily cash transfer participant , additional capability remotely track health visit make study participant . The system capable capture data health visit remotely real-time time nurse touch Afya Card NCF terminal reader mean validate health visit . The card reader instal participate health facility ( 24 intervention 24 control ) , well hospital County referral take place . 2.3.4 Enrollment During enrollment , inform write consent obtain , nurse enrol facility enter detail participant card reader . 2.3.5 Telephone Surveys A telephone survey administer participant generate data outcome obtained woman make health facility visit . The second part survey ass health care seek time enrollment time interview use ass quality care . . 2.3.6 Data collection sub-group participant Additional telephone survey For random sub-sample participant ( 50 % ) , two additional phone survey gather data primary secondary outcome , well establish baseline end line data need cost-effectiveness analysis . 2 week enrollment The first contact research team sub-group enrol woman take place two week enrollment , first follow-up period . A short questionnaire administer assess cost health facility visit . 12 month Actual Delivery Date There final exit survey sub-group participant follow-up health visit health status particpants , gather feedback experience cash transfer project . High risk group High risk group study include mother infection transmit mother child , could cause severe complication mother make impossible infer positive benefit intervention health . In addition method already outline track health record participant , health visit study participant permanently shift health facility outside evaluation zone also track . This do extra phone call participant ( outside regular phone survey ) elicit information health facility study participant currently receive care , visit make facility obtain record quarterly basis . 2.3.7 Economic evaluation Cost effectiveness analysis Economics data collect serf two purpose : ) Enable adjustment service provision evaluate impact intervention outcome , b ) For cost-effectiveness analysis . Data also collect health worker 's motivation ( 22 ) arm trial . 3 . ETHICAL CONSIDERATIONS The ethical approval study obtain Maseno University Ethics Review Committee ( MUERC ) UCL Ethics committee , data collection commences . The MUERC approve pilot phase trial aim main trial clearly outline . 3.1 DATA MANAGEMENT AND ANALYSIS PLAN 3.1.1 Blinding Due nature intervention , participant blind study allocation . The research team however generally blind intervention allocation status participant . The primary outcome data gather use electronic system design third party research team remain completely blind intervention allocation status participant health visit outcome end trial . The system randomly select participant intervention control group phone interview . The exception specific cash transfer question usage . Data cash transfer would separate rest data , merge rest data analyze . Secondary data abstract project implement partner . The abstracted record identify intervention allocation status woman . The card mixed follow sequence , make impossible link ID enrol facility . The trial statistician conduct interim final analysis blind allocation . 3.1.2 Interim analysis monitoring DMC The investigator expect adverse effect intervention plan carry two interim analysis 2018 2019 , report independent Data Management Committee ( DMC ) convene accord DAMOCLES charter ( 27 ) . For meeting , DMC provide report two key safety measure trial , present separately trial arm , infant maternal mortality . The DMC decide meet whether request analysis , may include analysis study primary outcome , ultimately occasion recommend study continue stop . 3.1.3 Final analysis Final analyse intention-to-treat include mother pregnant recruitment period ( January 2017 - September 2017 ) child , regardless whether receive intervention . The investigator test difference intervention control area primary outcome use logistic regression binary outcome , ordinal logistic regression ordinal outcome , adjust cluster use random effect model . The investigator also carry sub-group analysis examine whether effect intervention differs wealth/multi-dimensional poverty quintile understand equity impact intervention . The final analysis present accord CONSORT requirement cRCTs ( 28 , 29 ) . Both interim final analysis conduct trial statistician . A detailed statistical analysis plan prepare analysis begin . 3.4 Process evaluation In order enable replication scale intervention , mixed method process evaluation conduct document design , implementation mechanism intervention . Five main source data use : ( ) project plan monitoring document ; ( b ) form capture attendance , problem strategy identify woman health facility staff ; ( c ) phone survey data ; e ) facility cost data ( e ) field note intervention team member review monthly debriefing document intervention event . 4 . CHALLENGES AND LIMITATIONS 4.1 Data measurement related challenge - Certain health outcome difficult assess project ; prematurity , since last monthly period ( LMP ) use estimate expect delivery date ( EDD ) recall base may accurate . To mitigate , telephone survey use obtain actual birth date , subsequent follow-up base actual delivery date . - There could infections Malaria occur intervention , important consequence secondary outcome study . It possible make retrospective identification type health condition capture health record . - It possible get detail data birth health outcome woman deliver home , likely control intervention group . The investigator therefore utilize phone survey secondary method gathering data outcome .</detailed_description>
