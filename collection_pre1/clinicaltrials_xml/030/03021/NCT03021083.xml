	<brief_summary>The treatment postoperative pain continue challenge posterior spinal fusion . There considerable evidence demonstrate multi-modality approach include patient control analgesia ( PCA ) opioids postoperative pain management compare conventional opioid analgesia provide great analgesic effect even amount opioids consume similar group . However , PCA modality often discontinue prior patient ' pain need meet . The IONSYS system use concept PCA-delivered narcotic may use postoperative pain management .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Evaluating Feasibility Using Transdermal Patient-controlled Fentanyl After Spinal Fusions</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Following posterior spinal fusion , many patient treat analgesic modality prolong period choose surgical alternative . In addition , narcotic-based anesthetic require procedure may induce postoperative hyperalgesia ( 1 ) . Inadequate treatment pain result prolong hospitalization , cardiopulmonary complication , poor surgical outcome ( 2 ) . Pain immediate postoperative period usually manage IV narcotic PCA transition combination long-acting short-acting oral analgesic . Because requirement continuous carrier fluid infusion , cumbersome pump technology restrict mobility supervision dedicate pain team control program pump , PCA modality often discontinue prior patient ' pain need meet . The investigator ' recent study evaluate addition pregabalin pain regimen spinal fusion . The study find removal PCA modality , patient considerable pain physical therapy ( PT ) , pain improved addition pregabalin . The IONSYS system might alleviate problem encountered conventional PCA system ( 3,4 ) . The system iontophoretic transdermal ( needleless ) system preprogrammed deliver upon activation 40 mcg fentanyl 10-minute period , 6 dos per hour . The system perform 24 hour . The drug embed matrix gel deliver current propagate two pole system . Other usual narcotic side effect , specific side effect local dermatological reaction patch ( 5 % rash , clear removal ) . The system design fentanyl , since hydromorphone incorporate type matrix . Unlike hydromorphone , fentanyl quick act n't hang around . The in-house chronic pain service currently put many patient IV fentanyl , belief work pain quickly metabolize .</detailed_description>
