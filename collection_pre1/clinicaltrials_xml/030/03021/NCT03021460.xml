	<brief_summary>This phase II trial study well pembrolizumab ibrutinib work treat patient stage III-IV melanoma remove surgery . Monoclonal antibody , pembrolizumab , may interfere ability tumor cell grow spread . Ibrutinib may stop growth tumor cell block enzymes need cell growth . Giving pembrolizumab ibrutinib may work well treat patient melanoma .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Pembrolizumab Ibrutinib Treating Patients With Stage III-IV Melanoma That Can Be Removed Surgery</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To evaluate overall response rate ( ORR ) patient advance melanoma receive ibrutinib pembrolizumab . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . To assess safety adverse-event profile combination ibrutinib pembrolizumab patient advance melanoma . II . To evaluate progression-free-survival ( PFS ) patient advance melanoma receive ibrutinib pembrolizumab . III . To evaluate duration response , overall survival ( OS ) patient advance melanoma receive ibrutinib pembrolizumab . IV . To assess effect treatment ibrutinib pembrolizumab Th1/Th2 immune polarity . TERTIARY OBJECTIVES : I . To assess CD8 T cell response multiple melanoma-associated antigen , correlate CD8 T cell response change Th1/Th2 immune polarity . II . To assess change plasma cytokine induce treatment ibrutinib pembrolizumab . III . To assess change potential biomarkers , tumor-bound soluble PD-L1 level tumor-infiltrating lymphocyte , may correlate treatment response . OUTLINE : Patients receive ibrutinib orally ( PO ) daily day 1-28 course 1 day 1-21 course 2 subsequent course . Patients also receive pembrolizumab intravenously ( IV ) 30 minute day 8 course 1 day 1 course 2 subsequent course . Course 1 continue 28 day subsequent course repeat every 21 day absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . After completion study treatment , patient follow every 6 month 5 year .</detailed_description>
