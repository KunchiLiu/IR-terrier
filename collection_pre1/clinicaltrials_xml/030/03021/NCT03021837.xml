	<brief_title>The Effect Steroids Maternal Glucose Levels</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Few study examine effect maternal glucose level corticosteroid , give complicate pregnancy enhance fetal lung maturity early delivery expect . The applicability study limit presence confound factor low number participant ( range 7 50 ) . Two relevant study Mastrobiattista al Gurbuz et al . These study 7 40 subject respectively , study change maternal 1-hour glucose tolerance test follow administration steroid fetal lung maturity . The 1-hour test involve standard oral glucose challenge use screen gestational diabetes ; thus , may reflect change circulate glucose level typical source glucose ( meal ) anticipate steroid administration . Both study show change result glucose tolerance test conclude screen gestational diabetes delay least 72 hour 1 week completion steroid course . Neither study look maternal glucose value within first 48 hour give first dose steroid , neither address whether diabetes could diagnose alternatively maternal glucose response within first 48 hour follow steroid administration . It investigator 's clinical observation glucose value may high first 48 hour . Another study look effect various dos insulin degree hyperglycemia first 3 day follow steroid administration show increase glucose value even insulin-treated . Unfortunately , subject study concurrent treatment another agent know cause hyperglycemia . No standard care exist guide whether monitor glucose value steroid administration fetal lung maturity . The time course glucose elevation clear , often glucose elevation reach level would generally warrant treatment unknown . When glucose monitoring perform , standard exists guide duration frequency monitoring . Detecting maternal hyperglycemia important several reason , include : 1 . High maternal glucose level lead high fetal level prompt fetal response high glucose level . Some pregnancy may go deliver maternal glucose level still high , result high risk neonatal hypoglycemia nursery increase risk acidosis injury brain period distress occur labor . By nature clinical situation , fetus bear first day follow administration steroid also preterm possibly already additional factor put risk complication labor nursery , hyperglycemia compound risk . 2 . The maternal hyperglycemia may complicate maternal course time pregnant woman receive medication control premature labor obstetric condition prompt use steroid first place . Fluid balance constitutional symptom may affect high glucose value . Rarely , diabetic ketoacidosis may precipitate someone history diabetes .</detailed_description>
