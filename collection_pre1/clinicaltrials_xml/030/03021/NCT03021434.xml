	<brief_title>Trial Low-cost Microbiological Water Test Kits</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The propose trial utilizes cluster randomize controlled methodology , cluster occur village level . The intervention test cluster randomize control trial inform development simple , low-cost water quality test kit develop pilot J . Brown colleague Nagpur , Maharashtra . There two intervention arm one control/comparison arm . In select village , study team work local government conduct village-level information session water quality key water safety behaviour . Informational material water safety behaviour distrubted houseohlds follow information session . In control group , household visit provide water safety informational card collect drink water sample analyze lab . They receive result analysis conclusion study . Households Intervention Arm 1 ( Standard Testing ) water sample analyzed lab , result analysis deliver household . They receive informational card describe water purification strategy . Households Intervention Arm 2 ( Test Kits ) provide material train need perform water quality test household use newly develop test kit . They also receive informational card describe water purification strategy . Following initial village-level information session , study team randomly sample household participation trial . Participating household complete short survey household demographic water handling , storage , use behaviour water sample take tested lab fecal indicator bacteria . At unannounced follow-up visit , roughly 1 - 2 month enrollment , households complete short survey change water handling , storage , use behaviour second sample household store drinking water collect laboratory analysis . The effect cluster randomize control trial water quality determine compare arithmetic mean E. coli count sample household water change water safety behaviour baseline endline . Microbiological drinking water quality assess two time point : baseline endline . At visit , 330 ml sample household water collect analysis ; ask participant fill sample container drink cup child live household . Samples keep cold ( ice cooler ) delivery laboratory thereafter store 4oC processing , begin within 8 hour sample event .</detailed_description>
