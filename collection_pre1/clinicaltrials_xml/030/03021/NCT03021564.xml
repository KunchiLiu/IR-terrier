	<detailed_description>Unexpected cardiac arrest ICU correspond cardiovascular arrest lead least one cardiopulmonary resuscitation technique ( external cardiac massage / electric shock ) . They account 0.5 5 % admission intensive care unit . Even benefit technical environment conducive prompt diagnosis rapid management , Resuscitated patient suffer chronic disease organ failure ( ) darken prognosis . Etiologies unexpected cardiac arrest ICU rarely describe literature . Their specificity come fact related patient 's medical characteristic , also deleterious effect supportive technique place time circulatory arrest ( respiratory assistance , vasopressor drug , extracorporeal circulation ... ) . These technique may also reduce effectiveness cardiopulmonary resuscitation ( cardiorespiratory interaction respiratory assistance , pro-arrhythmogenic effect vasopressor drug , haemodynamic repercussion extracorporeal circulation ) . Although cardiac arrest publish extensively in-hospital , study specifically concern unexpected cardiac arrest ICU ( none France ) . The prognosis different : unexpected cardiac arrest ICU , 50 % patient recover spontaneous cardiac activity 15 % leave alive hospital ( 3 4 % good functional autonomy ) . A prospective description risk factor , circumstance consequence medium term would identify ( prevent ) risky situation identify , among risk unexpected cardiac arrest , cardiopulmonary resuscitation justify .</detailed_description>
