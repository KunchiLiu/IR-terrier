	<brief_summary>The use fluorescence real-time evaluation organ tissue vascularization lymph node anatomy recent technology potential surgical treatment cancer . The real-time analysis tissue vascularization allow immediate identification surgeon area great less blood circulation , favor surgical decision make prevention complication related tissue ischemia ( necrosis , dehiscence infection ) . It technology potential application area Digestive Surgery , Repairing Plastic Surgery Oncology , Head Neck Surgery . In addition , fluorescence use method identify lymph node structure interest oncological treatment patient urologic , gynecological digestive tumor . Introduced Pestana et al . In late 2000s , perfusion mapping system intraoperative indocyanine assist laser angiography ( SPY Elite System © LifeCell Corp. , Branchburg , N.J. ) initial application repair surgery breast cancer treatment . The method prove useful prevention ischemic infectious complication cancer surgery . Pestana , prospective clinical series 29 microsurgical flap use several reconstruction , observe single case partial loss flap , present technology relevant role intraoperative decision making . In year , Newman et al . The first application system breast reconstruction surgery . In initial series 10 consecutive case reconstruction microsurgical flap , 4 case system allow intraoperative identification area low perfusion , thus change surgical procedure . According author , 95 % correlation indocyanine laser assist subsequent development mastectomy skin necrosis , sensitivity 100 % specificity 91 % . Similarly , Murray et al . Evaluated intraoperative perfusion , however , areola-papillary complex patient submit subcutaneous mastectomy satisfactory result term predictability cutaneous circulation . Other author large clinical series evaluate procedure observe valid result term prevention complication . Vascular perfusion anastomose fistula follow bowel surgery cancer remain serious common complication . These fistula cause insufficient perfusion intestinal anastomosis . Intraoperative angiography indocyanine assist laser use visualize blood perfusion follow intravenous injection indocyanine green contrast . Several group report ability ass blood perfusion anastomotic area bowel surgery . Although studied retrospectively , Kudszus colleague describe reduction risk revision due fistula 60 % patient whose anastomosis examine use laser fluorescence angiography compare historically paired patient without method . The principle use evaluate tubulized stomach transpose cervical region subtotal esophagectomy . Currently , fluorescence-guided sentinel lymph node mapping study breast cancer well investigative character colorectal cancer , skin cancer , cervical cancer , vulvar cancer , head neck , lung cancer , penile cancer , cancer Endometrial cancer , gastric cancer esophageal cancer . These early study demonstrate feasibility methodology surgery . Comparison laser fluorescence image blue dye indicate fluorescence image replace blue dye exceed due increase tissue penetration depth absence stain patient clean operative field . To date , clinical study involve intraoperative perfusion map identification lymph node structure SPY Elite System © system platform ( Pinpoint Firefly ) Brazil evaluate Brazilian population . In objective way influence technology predictive good bad evolution oncologic surgery well prevention local ischemic complication mean intraopeal change conduct</brief_summary>
