	<brief_summary>To evaluate impact perioperative , algorithm driven , hemodynamic therapy base individualized fluid cardiac output optimization postoperative moderate severe complication patient undergo major abdominal surgery include visceral , urological , gynecological operation . In proposed study , hemodynamic therapy tailor individually patient , base individual preload optimization functional parameter `` pulse pressure variation ( PPV ) '' base individually titrated goal cardiac index . The propose study therefore develop concept hemodynamic goal-directed therapy individually set goal design assess impact morbidity mortality .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Individualized Perioperative Hemodynamic Goal-directed Therapy Major Abdominal Surgery ( iPEGASUS-trial )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Postoperative mortality patient undergo surgery average still 4 % Europe evaluate recently cohort study across 28 European country consider even high high risk surgery . But besides significant risk death , particular moderate severe postoperative complication , affect 40 % patient major surgery , frequently lead severe reduction quality life cause high healthcare cost western nation . Perioperative hemodynamic goal-directed optimization believe integral part reduce particular postoperative morbidity significantly possibly also mortality . Algorithm driven optimization macrocirculation aim best possible oxygen substrate delivery end organs tissue think theoretical mechanism therapy . A recent large multi-center trial base pragmatic , non-individualized protocol fail reduce composite morbidity underline weak point approach . The reason fail statistically significant improvement clinical outcome first see take account individual hemodynamic need single patient . Every patient hemodynamically treat accord `` one size fit maximize stroke volume '' approach . In contrast , first mono-center trial give evidence individualize early goal-directed therapy base individually optimize volumetric cardiac preload parameter ( global end-diastolic volume ) reduce complication ICU length stay cardiac surgery . Further , even important , first multi-center pilot study use goal-directed algorithm aim optimize blood flow orient individual cardiac capacity ( individualize optimal cardiac index ) major abdominal surgery demonstrate feasibility reduction postoperative complication . This finding need confirm multi-center study adequately power detect change specific complication mortality clinical practice change accordingly . Therefore , hypothesis propose prospective two arm randomize study algorithm drive individualized hemodynamic goal-directed therapy reduces moderate severe postoperative complication massive burden quality life health care cost . The propose study develop concept hemodynamic goal-directed therapy individually set goal design assess impact morbidity mortality .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>To provide high generalizability representativeness high number patient laparotomy major surgical trauma include study . Therefore , open visceral , urological , gynecological surgery cover study . Expected duration surgery must ≥ 120 minute requirement volume therapy need expect ≥ 2 liter . Risk postoperative complication need ≥10 % assess ACS ( American College Surgery ) NSQUIP ( National Surgical Quality Improvement Program ) risk calculator . Patients &lt; 18 year , laparoscopic approach , patient sinus rhythm , patient highly impaired leave ventricular function ( ejection fraction &lt; 30 % ) severe aortic valve stenosis ( aortic valve area &lt; 1 cm2 , mean gradient &gt; 40 mmHg ) , pregnant woman , emergency surgery ( surgery require within 24 hour ) , primarily vascular surgery , patient suffer septic shock , patient phaeochromocytoma , patient suffer noncardiac chest pain , refusal consent , patient receive palliative treatment ( likely die within 6 month ) patient suffer acute myocardial ischemia ( within 30 day randomization ) exclude study . Further , case clinician intend use cardiac output monitor clinical reason patient also include study .</criteria>
