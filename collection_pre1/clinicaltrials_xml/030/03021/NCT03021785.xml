	<brief_title>A Study Multiple Intravitreal Injection TK001 Patients With Neovascular Age-related Macular Degeneration</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This multicenter , open-label study evaluate safety , pharmacokinetics , immunogenicity , preliminary efficacy multiple intravitreal injection TK001 patient AMD . It consist core study ( 12 week ) extension study ( 40 week ) . In core study , patient receive assign dose 50-μL solution administer intravitreal injection every 4 week . In extension study , evaluate every 4 week administrate PRN ( pro nata ) assign dose . The safety , pharmacokinetics , immunogenicity , preliminary efficacy TK001 evaluate core study , also assess extension study except pharmacokinetics .</detailed_description>
