	<brief_title>Respiratory Muscle Training Stroke Swallowing Disorders</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Stroke major cause morbidity mortality worldwide . Stroke lead varying degree oropharyngeal dysphagia ( 25-85 % patient ) respiratory muscle dysfunction associate increase medical complication bronchoaspiration , malnutrition death . Dysphagia present significant proportion patient admit Rehabilitation ( 85 % depend series ) stroke . Standard swallow therapy consist educational intervention aim improve self-management dysphagia protect airway , oral exercise improve lingual praxis , compensatory technique base videofluoroscopic finding . Recent study suggest IEMT improve swallow efficacy reduce eventual bronchoaspirative event . Nutritional status appear 9-67 % patient acute subacute stroke impact functional outcome provide information risk hospitalization death . Stroke patient risk develop malnutrition neurologic impairment related feeding ( chew , deglutition self-feeding ) result poor food intake . To date , study prevalence influence malnutrition stroke .</detailed_description>
