	<brief_summary>This study propose novel early intervention combine Intravenous ( IV ) amino acid plus in-bed cycle ergometry exercise improve physical outcome critically ill patient . We hypothesize innovative approach improve short-term physical functioning outcome ( primary outcome ) , well amino acid metabolism , body composition , patient-reported outcome 6-month follow-up .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The evaluation combination exercise protein supplementation intensive care unit ( ICU ) patient novel potentially important . For instance , outside ICU , clinical condition , combination protein supplementation exercise improve protein synthesis , muscle mass , muscle strength compare protein exercise alone.63-70 Hence , opportunity exists improve ICU patient ' physical outcome via evaluate combination optimize protein intake early exercise ICU setting . The propose intervention hypothesis : The investigator propose multi-centered Phase II randomize control trial ( RCT ) , blind outcomes assessment , combination intravenous ( IV ) amino acid supplementation early in-bed cycle ergometry exercise , versus usual care ICU patient require mechanical ventilation . The investigator hypothesize novel combine intervention : ( 1 ) improve physical functioning hospital discharge ; ( 2 ) reduce muscle waste improve amino acid metabolism protein synthesis in-hospital ; ( 3 ) improve health-related quality life , physical functioning , healthcare resource utilization 6 month enrollment . Preliminary data show feasibility safety IV amino acid propose exercise intervention . The investigator choose primary outcome correlate well future long-term outcome include mortality , hospitalization , quality life.2 If Phase II trial positive , investigator seek funding Phase III RCT demonstrate sustain improvement longer-term patient-centered primary outcome . If proven effective , combine intervention potential revolutionize care ICU patient major public health impact grow number ICU survivor . Objectives : To demonstrate innovative combination amino acid supplementation plus early in-bed cycle ergometry exercise improve physical outcome ICU patient . Specific Aims : 1 . Short-term performance-based physical function outcome . To determine combine IV amino acid supplementation early in-bed cycle ergometry exercise intervention , compare usual care , improve in-hospital muscle strength performance-based physical functioning outcome critically ill patient , use primary endpoint six-minute walk distance ( 6MWD ) hospital discharge . 2 . Amino acid metabolism &amp; body composition . To determine combine intervention , compare usual care , improve amino acid utilization decrease muscle waste ICU patient ( secondary endpoint ) . 3 . Patient-reported outcome health care utilization 6 month . To determine combine intervention , compare usual care , improve physical functioning , health-related quality life , healthcare utilization 6 month study enrollment ( secondary endpoint ) .</detailed_description>
