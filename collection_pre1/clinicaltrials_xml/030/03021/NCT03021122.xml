	<brief_title>Reducing Medication Errors Time Drugs Delivery During Pediatric Cardiopulmonary Resuscitation : Multicenter RCT</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>During pediatric cardiopulmonary resuscitation ( CPR ) , vasoactive drug preparation continuous infusion complex time-consuming , place child high risk adult medication error . It well establish CPR duration inversely correlate survival , decrease linearly 2.1 % per minute , decrease risk neurological sequela [ 1 ] . In study , investigator recruit nurse work 5 swiss Pediatric Emergency Departments division prepare continuous infusion vasoactive drug simulation-based pediatric CPR cardiac arrest scenario high-fidelity manikin ( Laerdal SimJunior™ ) . The scenario take place shock room increase realism . According randomization 1:1 allocation ratio , nurse prepare deliver vasoactive drug follow current conventional method aim mobile tablet application call PedAMINES™ ( Pediatric Accurate Medication In Emergency Situations ) . PedAMINES™ design support nurse step-by-step order delivery wide range drug , especially require continuous infusion . PedAMINES™ already show single-center simulation-based study reduce time vasoactive drug preparation , delivery rate medication error [ 2 ] . On day participation , obtain nurse 's write informed consent randomization , nurse receive standardize 5-minute training session use app . Then , nurse ask perform standardized 15-minute highly realistic CPR scenario , include post-return spontaneous circulation ( ROSC ) . After epinephrine-induced ROSC , nurse ask first prepare continuous infusion dopamine , use either PedAMINES™ conventional method , continuous infusion norepinephrine cross procedure . Moreover , 2 questionnaire give scenario ask nurse demographic data , perceive stress degree satisfaction . 1 . Primary outcome measure allocation group number medication dosage error commit drug preparation sequence injection . 2 . Secondary outcome measure time drug preparation ( TDP ) time drug delivery ( TDD ) . All action ( i.e . primary secondary outcome ) perform nurse scenario automatically record stored responsive simulator detector , application several video camera . To avoid assessment bias , two evaluator independently review video recording . In case disagreement , third independent evaluator help reach consensus . We aim determine whether use PedAMINES™ might improve management acute life-threatening condition quickly deliver expertise vasoactive drug administration hospital Switzerland , even non-university hospital nurse ( physician ) either little exposed pediatric CPRs . We hypothesize PedAMINES™ might primary reduce medication error , secondary reduce delay drug preparation delivery independently exist conventional preparation method nurse ' skill .</detailed_description>
