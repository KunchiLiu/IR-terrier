	<brief_summary>Busy Primary Care provider ( PCPs ) complex practice many compete demand , make difficult improve HL identification rate . Little research conduct identify effective approach address poor PCP knowledge provide tool well identify/refer patient HL appropriate intervention . Current data suggest critical need redesign PCPs deliver hear health care ( HHC ) develop focused educational program simple clinical management tool help integrate HHC practice . To address need , study educate provider hear loss ( HL ) screening/treatment well create Best Practice Alert ( BPA ) , clinical prompt , configure maximal effectiveness remind PCPs ask patient think HL . This combination education provider clinical reminder could help increase HL screen rate much clear . This 5 year R21/R33 study fund National Institute Deafness Communicative Disorders seek provide detailed understand educate provider HL use effective BPA affect HL screen rate identification people mild moderate hearing loss .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The Best Practice Alert ( BPA ) develop via iterative process two year pilot phase one site health system . First , `` standard '' BPA develop launch site pilot phase . Similarly , pilot 10-minute education system develop present BPA launch . Pre post survey clinician conduct evaluate effectiveness education program . After clinician experience BPA , Cognitive Task Analyses ( CTAs ) clinicians conduct identify way make BPA effective , BPA iteratively improve . Similarly , CTAs help u understand clinician use BPAs general . Using process , end highly rat , easy use BPA utilize actual study . We also revamp education program 10 minute video focus clinician mental model HL , use actual study . The big study , i.e. , R33 phase , launch several Family Medicine practice within two different health system . One system traditional academic institution academic faculty ( physicians audiologists ) , midlevels resident , new academic system , base within private health system , include non-academic physician private audiologists . Patients trigger BPA 55 year old , open referral chart audiology , know hearing loss already problem summary list ( PSL ) . These patient ask complete Hearing Handicap Inventory ( HHI ) check-in , common hearing loss screen tool ( score 10+ indicates probable hearing loss ) ; result share clinician . If physician chooses address prompt patient encounter , BPA design allow , 1 ) Indicate patient decline hear screening ( BPA dismiss 1 year ) , 2 ) Indicate patient already know hearing loss ( HL ) add HL PSL ( The BPA permanently dismiss ) , 3 ) Indicate patient HL time ( The BPA dismiss one year ) , 4 ) refer patient audiology hear screening . The data generate BPA extract electronic health record ( EHR ) analyze determine HL screening rate improve compare baseline data , whether provider interact BPA , whether HL add PSL . The HHI result use `` gold standard , '' i.e. , compare data generate BPA , indicate whether patient probable HL get appropriate care . When enrolled patient show Audiology audiologists ask complete three question survey verify 1 ) referral appropriate , 2 ) severity hear loss , 3 ) hearing aid recommend . This step study whether BPA generate appropriate referral . 20 % patient score 10 HHI and/or refer audiology contact phone researcher ask question conversation may recall related HL appointment well experience audiology . Iterative improvement make BPA base Cognitive Task Analysis ( CTA ) interview randomly select provider ( mostly family physician ) . Finally , implementation BPA clinical practice observe use principle Normalization Process Theory ( NPT ) study whether potential issue may impact whether patient risk HL screen refer . We also show revamp educational video within week BPA go live site , repeat pre post evaluation . We study whether education video increase identification referral patient high risk HL .</detailed_description>
