	<detailed_description>Contrast-induced acute kidney injury ( CIAKI ) serious complication occur patient chronic kidney disease undergo angiography associate adverse renal cardiovascular outcome . The investigator address two key question remain high-risk patient undergo angiography . First , early detection CIAKI contrast exposure problematic rise serum creatinine decline urine output occur several day many case under-diagnosed . Second , early risk stratification long-term adverse event also problematic exist risk prediction model modest predictive value . Availability biomarker detect subclinical CIAKI creatinine also aid risk stratification change primary secondary prevention strategy . The FDA recently approve two novel , highly sensitive , urinary cell cycle arrest biomarkers early detection AKI . The investigator show biomarkers : tissue inhibitor metalloproteinase ( TIMP ) -2 insulin growth factor bind protein ( IGFBP ) 7 , detect AKI serum creatinine critically ill patient associate long-term adverse outcome . Whether marker use predict renal cardiovascular outcome patient undergo angiography yet unknown . The investigator recently fund Department Veterans Affairs conduct multicenter , randomize , clinical trial 7,680 high-risk patient undergo angiography compare effectiveness intravenous sodium bicarbonate isotonic sodium chloride , oral N- acetylcysteine placebo , prevention serious adverse outcome associate CIAKI . The NIDDK fund associated biorepository examine know yet-to-be identified biomarkers CIAKI . The investigator propose leverage resource conduct ancillary observational study entitle Biomarker Effectiveness Analysis Contrast Nephropathy ( BEACON ) . Using urine plasma sample obtain four hour angiography 1,100 subject , investigator address two specific aim . Aim 1 examine accuracy urinary TIMP-2 , IGFBP7 , select plasma biomarkers predict composite renal outcome death , dialysis dependence , persistent renal injury day 90 contrast exposure ( Aim 1a ) ; biomarker reclassification risk adverse renal outcome develop risk score ( Aim 1b ) ; predict progression chronic kidney disease ( Aim 1c ) . Aim 2 examine accuracy urinary TIMP-2 IGFBP7 predict composite outcome hospitalization acute coronary syndrome ; heart failure ; cerebrovascular accident ; all-cause mortality within 90 day ( Aim 2a ) ; biomarker reclassification risk cardiovascular event ( Aim 2b ) . The propose work advance NIDDK 's mission early detection , risk-stratification , prognostication CIAKI . It provide new scientific knowledge use biomarkers monitor patient undergo angiography high impact clinical practice , physician , policy maker .</detailed_description>
