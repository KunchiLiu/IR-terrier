	<brief_summary>The investigator propose unique methodology study infection vaccination history immune response . As study infection history conduct mouse , limitation inherent applicability human . A longitudinal comparison study follow old adult ( age 65 ) hospitalize influenza follow hospital discharge vaccination follow season . This allow investigation course infection , well impact response vaccination .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Protection From Influenza : Determining Impact Prior Infection</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Significance : This study provide critical information best technique vaccine candidate test improve influenza treatment approach . The long-term goal research identify T-cell response surrogate ( biomarkers ) serious complication influenza old adult predict vaccine efficacy ( prevention influenza illness ) vaccine effectiveness ( prevention serious complication ) . Further , translate new insight age-related immune dysfunction design new influenza vaccine critical address unmet need population age 65 old . Innovation : The study help validation clinical tool biomarkers prognostic indicator influenza illness severity vaccinate old adult , point-of-care diagnostics would direct preventive strategy reduce impact influenza illness vaccinate old adult , correlate protection evaluate potential new influenza vaccine enhance protection serious complication influenza illness . The investigator establish GrzB activity IFNg : IL-10 ratio influenza-stimulated PBMC correlate protection influenza , preliminary data show low GrzB activity influenza-stimulated PBMC correlate severe disease high level frailty . The innovation project establish method develop correlate protection , clinical insight frailty affect immune-mediated protection influenza , direct translation research provide reasonable method primary care clinician estimate vaccine effectiveness individual old person . These result translate practical design clinical trial evaluate potential new influenza vaccine well protect serious complication influenza complement base antibody titer and/or clinical outcome alone .</detailed_description>
