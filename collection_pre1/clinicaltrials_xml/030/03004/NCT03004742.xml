	<detailed_description>1 . The primary objective study evaluate effect ingest flavonoid-rich supplement total urine polyphenol concentration shift blood metabolite related flavonoid intake healthy overweight/obese community-dwelling adult . 2 . Secondary objective determine relate effect measure inflammation oxidative stress . Studies mixed regard influence flavonoid supplement traditional biomarkers inflammation oxidative stress , metabolite shift metabolomics measurement may provide good insight . Chemistry profile symptom log compare pre- post-study group confirm prior safety data collect human participant . Hypothesis : Subjects randomize ingestion flavonoid-rich supplement compare placebo experience increase total urine polyphenols concentration shift blood metabolite relate increased flavonoid metabolism . Secondarily , subject ingest flavonoid-rich supplement experience decrease systemic inflammation oxidative stress . BASELINE TESTING ( ASU-NCRC HUMAN PERFORMANCE LAB ) : A . One week start study , subject report ASU-NCRC Human Performance Lab , orient study , provide voluntary consent . Subjects fill medical health questionnaire verify medical history lifestyle habit . Subjects must agree maintain normal dietary physical activity pattern 12-week intervention , make formal attempt lose body weight . All subject inclusion exclusion criterion must maintain study . Subjects instruct record food intake 3-day period prior start study ( Thursday , Friday , Sunday ) . Subjects instruct collect urine 24-hours day study start .

If urinate 20 minute , try hold urine proper time . - Please note exact time final collection . B . On first day study , subject return lab fast state ( 9 hour food beverage water ) turn 3-day food record 24-h urine collection sample . Height , body weight , percent body fat ( seca BIA scale ) measure . Blood sample collect antecubital vein subject seat position trained phlebotomist . Each blood sample exceed 40 ml ( 2.7 tablespoon ) . Subjects also record responses 4-week retrospective symptom log . Subjects give flavonoid placebo supplement first 4-week period , ingest first two supplement lab supervision . 12-WEEK INTERVENTION : Subjects ( N=110 ) randomize flavonoid supplement placebo supplement group 12 week ( thus two independent group run parallel 55 subject ) . Supplements administer double-blinded manner , code hold Reoxcyn Discoveries Group end study . The goal N=100 subject complete phase study . Subjects ingest two supplement supplement day study , one breakfast , second one lunch . Subjects report Human Performance Lab 4- 12-week time point overnight-fasted state repeat baseline measurement ( include 3-day food record 24-h urine collection ) . The 4-week retrospective symptom log fill pre-study , 4 , 8 , 12 week ( 8-week log administer via email ) . Subjects give 8-weeks supply supplement complete 4-week lab session . SUPPLEMENT INFORMATION : The flavonoid-rich supplement contain mixture flavonoid green tea bilberry extract , quercetin . The supplement also contain food component boost flavonoid benefit body include fish oil , caffeine , vitamin C. The daily dose 4 flavonoid tablet ( two breakfast , two lunch ) . Here detailed summary ingredient flavonoid-rich supplement ( 4 tablet per day ) : Supplement Facts Serving size : 4 Tablets Servings per container : 30 Amount per Serving % Daily Value Calories 50 Total Carbohydrate 12 g 4 % Sugars 10 g Vitamin C ( Ascorbyl Palmitate ) 100 mg 167 % Wild Bilberry Fruit Extract ( std . min . 25 % Total Anthocyanins ) 156 mg ** Green Tea Leaf Extract 180 mg ** Quercetin 100 mg ** Natural Caffeine ( Coffea arabica Bean ) 100 mg ** NovoOmegaÂ® Omega-3 F30 Powder ( Std . 30 % Omega-3 Fatty Acids ( Eicosapentaenoic Acid Docosahexaenoic Acid ) ) 200 mg ** * Percent Daily Values base 2,000 calorie diet ** Daily Value Established Other Ingredients : Sugar , Natural &amp; Artificial Flavor , Dextrose , Cellulose Gum , Sucralose , Bamboo Whole Plant Extract , Guar Gum , Xanthan Gum , Citric Acid , Malic Acid , L-Tartaric Acid Contains Fish .
