	<brief_summary>Older adult susceptible vitamin mineral deficiency variety reason increase demand many micronutrient . Multivitamin/multimineral supplement offer simple way adult improve nutrient intake , ability measurably affect micronutrient status old adult never explore . This study intend recruit healthy , non-smoking men age 70 year old . After meet entry criterion , subject require restrict use supplement and/or fortify food . A month restriction begin , subject come clinical research center take cognitive test , undergo activity monitoring , provide blood sample nutrition testing , take food frequency questionnaire . Subjects randomize one two group - one consume multivitamin/multimineral supplement ( Centrum Silver Mens Formula ) ; another consuming inert placebo tablet . Subjects consume 1 tablet day sixteen week . After period , subject return clinical research center repeat cognitive test , activity monitor , blood sampling , food frequency questionnaire . These data assess determine multivitamin consumption result change various nutrient versus take placebo ( primary outcome ) , may result change lipid lipoprotein profile , metabolic health , inflammation , blood pressure cognitive function ( secondary outcome ) . The investigator expect result study add gneeral understanding multivitamin/multimineral formula improve nutrition status old adult , therefore capacity alter marker health .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Role Centrum® Silver® Improving Micronutrient Status Older Men</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Older adult increase risk various chronic disease , inadequate level vitamin mineral may play significant role , include cardiovascular disease , Alzheimer 's disease , liver disease , cancer . Most adult United States meet Recommended Dietary Allowance ( RDA ) Adequate Intake ( AI ) many vitamin nutritionally-essential mineral diet alone , include vitamin A , C , D , E K , calcium , magnesium , potassium . Older adult particularly susceptible micronutrient inadequacy limit absorption , increase requirement , - case vitamin D - decrease synthetic capacity skin . Thus , strong rationale supplement diet old adult multivitamin/multimineral supplement , Centrum® Silver® . However , little currently know bioavailability Centrum® Silver® formula age demographic . Epidemiological study recent clinical trial show use multivitamin/mineral supplement beneficial effect disease risk men , include advanced age . It assume benefit multivitamin/mineral supplement achieve change nutrition status . However , never document concomitant change micronutrient level individual consume supplement . Furthermore , change nutritional status old individual take multivitamin/multimineral supplement subject yet explore . Therefore , study seek recruit men generally good health , 70 year age old , assess vitamin mineral status four month supplementation Centrum® Silver® . The investigator hypothesize consume multivitamin/multimineral supplement everyday result measurable increase status one vitamins mineral body . Concentrations several vitamin mineral blood sample perform , along general assessment micronutrient status white blood cell ( primary outcome ) . To see change nutrition status impact aspects human health , change lipid lipoprotein profile , antioxidant status , metabolic health , inflammation treatment difference cognitive function assess ( secondary outcome ) . Centrum® Silver® supplementation may may effect secondary outcome , compare placebo , unless measurable change primary outcome . The expectation result research add general understanding multivitamin/mineral supplement well improve nutritional status old adult . By employ direct functional method assay nutritional content , study determine well method correlate use assay method unique insight mechanism ( ) whereby multivitamin/multimineral supplement might might lead improvement health may ascertain .</detailed_description>
