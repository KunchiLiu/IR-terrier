	<brief_summary>Sodium ( Na+ ) hemostasis abnormal CKD patient , element deposit skin , muscle skeleton - cope long term sodium loading . It known sodium store non-osmotically active way , profoundly inflammatory . Furthermore , inflammation associate number uremic symptom . The investigator use novel Na+ MRI image examine Na+ deposition skin , muscle skeleton three group patient : 1 ) chronic 3-times-a-week in-center hemodialysis patient , 2 ) peritoneal dialysis patient , 3 ) patient CKD stage 4-5 ; compare result age sex match healthy control . Additionally , investigate association sodium deposition tissue uremic symptomatology biochemical marker metabolism .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Sodium Deposition Soft Tissues Patients With Kidney Disease</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Kidneys key role sodium hemostasis excretory function . In patient chronic kidney disease ( CKD ) , kidney function impair ; thus , suggest sodium handle abnormal set long-term sodium loading ( oral intake ) lack adequate urinary excretion . Yet , sodium concentration need stay relatively constant prevent fatal intra-cellular accumulation , would result cell injury death . In hemodialysis patient , least part extra sodium show non-osmotically active deposit skin , muscle skeleton . Furthermore , become increasingly recognize sodium ( accumulated tissue ) directly pro-inflammatory , affect innate immune system regulate activity macrophage skin . This linkage sodium inflammation indicate potential link sodium deposition uremic symptom experience patient . There study date examine sodium deposition skin , muscle skeleton patient different kidney function renal replacement therapy . The investigator therefore propose use novel Na+ MRI image examine Na+ deposition skin , muscle skeleton three group patient : 1 ) chronic 3-times-a-week in-center hemodialysis patient , 2 ) peritoneal dialysis patient , 3 ) patient CKD stage 4-5 ; compare result age sex match healthy control . Additionally , intend investigate association sodium deposition tissue uremic symptomatology biochemical marker metabolism . This observational cohort image study involve single center recruit patient prevalent conventional hemodialysis , peritoneal dialysis CKD stage 4-5 population London , Ontario , compare healthy control . Once recruit , participant undergo study session ( non-dialysis day hemodialysis patient ) . This session include symptom questionnaire , blood work , MRI study thigh detect sodium content . The investigator ' aim characterize Na+ deposition different patient group analyze association biochemical marker , uremic symptom severity .</detailed_description>
