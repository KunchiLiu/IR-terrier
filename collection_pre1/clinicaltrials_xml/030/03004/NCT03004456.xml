	<detailed_description>Children chronic illness experience frequent painful experience extend period time , may develop long-term physiological , psychological behavioral sequela include increased sensitivity pain high level anxiety painful procedure . There strong evidence show distraction effective reduce child 's pain distress painful procedure . However , evidence support distraction , well method pain reduction venipuncture ( i.e . vibration , topical anesthetic , sucrose ) , primarily focus child previously well , chronic disease understudied population regard pain reduction simple procedure . Children chronic disease pathology , particularly receive transplantation ( e.g . cardiac , renal , liver ) , population undergo frequent painful procedure , venipuncture multiple time per week . There currently standard care pain reduction venipuncture pediatric patient blood draw phlebotomy transplant clinic outpatient . The investigator conduct randomize control trial compare two group : Distraction versus standard care ( i.e . distraction ) . The intervention ( distraction ) administer use iPad allow child self-select developmentally appropriate distraction ( e.g . game , movie , music ) . Participants videotape approximately 1 minute , start time venipuncture . This video view later date two train study investigator assess patient 's pain distress associate venipuncture , measure OSBD-r , CHEOPS , FLACC .</detailed_description>
