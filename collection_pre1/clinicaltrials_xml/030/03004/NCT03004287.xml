	<brief_summary>This study ass whether add one new multiple myeloma therapy , daratumumab , Total Therapy approach help patient live long few side effect</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>2015-12 : A Study Exploring Use Early Late Consolidation/Maintenance Therapy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Past study conduct Myeloma Institute institution show many patient high-risk disease ( determine gene array study - study look specific gene use special equipment ) tend short remission ( disappearance sign symptom myeloma ) survive long participant low-risk myeloma . The Total Therapy approach treatment carry Myeloma Institute multiple chemotherapy agent give induction follow stem cell transplant , post-transplant consolidation , maintenance therapy proven best available treatment strategy . However , availability new treatment work different way offer possibility improve effectiveness Total Therapy treatment potentially reduce number side effect patient ' experience . Daratumumab human monoclonal antibody protein drug . It recognize specific protein , CD38 , find high level multiple myeloma cell . An antibody something find kill foreign object body , case , myeloma cell . The drug use study treatment regimen include carfilzomib bortezomib , thalidomide , lenalidomide , dexamethasone , cisplatin , adriamycin , cyclophosphamide , etoposide , lenalidomide dexamethasone .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Patients must newly diagnose active Multiple Myeloma ( MM ) require treatment . Patients previous history smolder myeloma eligible evidence progressive disease require chemotherapy . Patients must either untreated receive four cycle systemic MM therapy ( e.g . Revlimid Dexamethasone ( RD ) , Bortezomib Revlimid Dexamethasone ( VRD ) . Prior bisphosphonates localize radiation allow . Participants must highrisk disease , define least one following : Myeloma Prognostic Risk Signature ( MyPRS ) risk score ≥ 50.4 Lactate Dehydrogenase ( LDH ) ≥ 360 U/L ( Rule hemolysis infection ; contact PI doubt . ) Diagnosis primary plasma cell leukemia . Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group ( ECOG ) ≤ 2 , unless solely due symptom MMrelated bone disease . Patients must platelet count ≥ 50,000/μL , unless low level explain extensive bone marrow plasmacytosis . Patients must least 18 year age old 75 year age time registration . Participants must baseline serum creatinine level &lt; 3 mg/dL baseline Alanine Aminotransferase ( ALT ) &lt; 3x Upper Limit Normal ( ULN ) . Participants must ejection fraction echocardiogram ( ECHO ) Multiplegated Acquisition Scan ( MUGA ) scan ≥ 45 % Patients must adequate pulmonary function study &gt; 50 % predict mechanical aspect ( Forced Expiratory Volume 1 ( FEV1 ) , Forced Vital Capacity ( FVC ) diffusion capacity ( DLCO ) &gt; 50 % predict . If patient unable complete pulmonary function test due MM relate pain condition , exception may grant principal investigator document patient candidate high dose therapy . Patients must sign Institutional Review Board ( IRB ) approve informed consent indicate understand propose treatment protocol approve Institutional Review Board ( IRB ) . No evidence highrisk disease Poorly control hypertension , diabetes mellitus , active uncontrolled hepatitis , serious medical psychiatric illness could potentially interfere completion treatment accord protocol . Patients must prior malignancy , except adequately treat basal cell squamous cell skin cancer , situ cervical cancer , cancer patient receive treatment one year prior enrollment . Other cancer acceptable patient 's life expectancy exceed five year . Pregnant nursing woman may participate . Women childbearing potential must negative pregnancy document within one week registration . Subjects reproductive potential may participate unless agree use effective contraceptive method .</criteria>
