	<brief_title>Comparison Efficacy Of Probiotic Toothpaste Chlorhexidine Mouthwash To Reduce S.Mutans</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>INTRODUCTION - When basic oral hygiene poor , orthodontic appliance create area plaque get accumulate , especially around bracket , band , wire , attachment ; facilitate development white spot lesion . Probiotics act competitively inhibit pathogenic bacteria great adhesion tissue Chlorhexidine often use active ingredient mouthwash design reduce dental plaque around orthodontic appliance . AIM &amp; OBJECTIVE - The objective study evaluate compare effect topical application probiotic toothpaste chlorhexidine mouthwash Streptococcus Mutans level plaque orthodontic patient hence improve oral micro-flora oral cavity competitive inhibition Streptococcus Mutans plaque present around bracket . MATERIAL &amp; METHOD - The study consist thirty randomly select orthodontic patient undergo fixed appliance treatment . The patient divide three group - Control Group ( Group 1 ) , Probiotic Toothpaste Group ( Group 2 ) &amp; Chlorhexidine Mouthwash Group ( Group 3 ) . Samples collect two time interval : study begin ( Phase 1 ) thirty day ( Phase 2 ) .</detailed_description>
