	<brief_summary>Increased inflammation implicate pathophysiology number neuropsychiatric illness include mood disorder , affect almost 30 million adult United States alone . One mechanism inflammation may alter behavior increase brain glutamate , neurotransmitter excess implicated neuronal toxicity resistance conventional antidepressant therapy . The goal propose research test hypothesis inflammation alters behavior increase glutamate specific brain region , ultimately lead behavioral change . The propose research design determine cause effect relationship inflammation CNS glutamate well relationship CNS glutamate specific symptom . To accomplish aim , investigator administer single infusion either tumor necrosis factor ( TNF ) antagonist infliximab placebo ( n=30 per group ) patient high inflammation ( CRP &gt; 3mg/L ) . A CRP &gt; 3mg/L chosen consider high inflammation accord guideline American Heart Association . Moreover , CRP &gt; 3mg/L associate significantly increase basal ganglion glutamate clinical response infliximab . Inflammatory biomarkers , basal ganglion glutamate measure MRS , motivation psychomotor activity assess baseline day 1 3 week 1 2 follow infliximab placebo administration .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>This study aim test hypothesis increase inflammation cause increase basal ganglion glutamate consequently anhedonia psychomotor retardation patient major depressive disorder ( MDD ) . Excessive inflammation glutamate excitotoxicity two pathway receive increase attention regard pathophysiology neuropsychiatric disease include mood disorder . Patients depression exhibit increase peripheral central nervous system ( CNS ) marker inflammation well alter CNS glutamate measure magnetic resonance spectroscopy ( MRS ) . In addition , drug block either inflammation glutamate signal reverse depressive symptom , especially depressed patient treatment resistance . Inflammatory cytokine know inhibit glutamate reuptake increase glutamate release astrocytes , glutamate antagonist show block inflammation-induced depressive-like behavior mouse . Moreover , use MRS , data show administration inflammatory cytokine interferon ( IFN ) -alpha significantly increase glutamate basal ganglia association IFN-alpha-induced anhedonia psychomotor slow . In addition , increase inflammation reflect peripheral blood C-reactive protein ( CRP ) correlate increase basal ganglion glutamate association decrease motivation psychomotor speed patient MDD . Nevertheless , data date correlational , whether increase inflammation cause increase glutamate basal ganglion , turn contribute behavioral change patient depression establish . To test hypothesis , investigator plan determine cause effect relationship increase inflammation increase CNS glutamate block inflammation depress patient high inflammation ( CRP &gt; 3mg/L ) use highly specific tumor necrosis factor ( TNF ) antagonist infliximab ( n=30 ) versus placebo ( n=30 ) . In addition , study team examine whether change basal ganglia glutamate link change behavior relate basal ganglion include anhedonia psychomotor retardation .</detailed_description>
