	<brief_title>A Study Evaluate Changes Human Breast Cancer Tissue Following Short-Term Use ODM-201</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This current study enroll EBC subject differ breast cancer ( BC ) subtypes , intent characterize molecular alteration BC tissue short-term exposure anti-androgen ODM-201 . Studying biological mechanism ODM-201 target androgen receptor ( AR ) BC crucial understanding ' potential role , well provide foundation development ODM-201 disease . TRIO030 evaluate follow objective : Primary -To identify molecular alteration occur human BC tissue , follow short-term exposure ODM-201 female subject EBC ; Secondary - To evaluate safety tolerability short-term exposure ODM-201 female subject EBC . Design : This multi-center , open-label , tissue-acquisition study involve 60 subject approximately 20 site North America Europe , enroll EBC subject differ subtypes ( i.e. , triple negative [ TNBC ] , ER+/HER2- , HER2+ ) , intent characterize molecular alteration BC tissue short-term exposure anti-androgen ODM-201 . Such information may suggest ODM-201 combined modality ; example , treatment drug discover affect multiple signaling pathway . Molecular profile tumor sample ODM-201 treatment may permit identification patient likely unlikely respond agent base biological molecular characteristic tumor . Duration : It recommend surgery date define prior start protocol treatment start date ODM-201 ( Day 1 ) derive minus 14 21 day schedule surgery date . Treatment take day prior surgery subject order stop oral intake ( i.e. , `` nil per o '' ( npo ) ) , ever occur first . If reason surgery take place 21 day treatment start , acceptable subject receive ODM-201 21 day maximum 35 day ; subject continue protocol treatment day prior surgery , npo order . In case strongly recommend surgery perform soon possible 21 day treatment complete . After surgery , End Study ( EoS ) visit occur 30 day ( +/- 3 day ) subject 's last intake ODM-201 . In case ongoing protocol treatment-related AEs/SAEs time EoS visit , monitor event continue clinically indicate ( ) event resolve ( b ) event reach status , Investigator 's opinion , unlikely resolve due nature condition and/or subject 's underlying disease . Total Number Sites : Currently , total 12 site plan participate worldwide , 4 site locate within U.S , 5 Canada , 3 Germany . Sample Size/Patient Population : Sixty subject enrol study . To able assess molecular alteration ODM-201 , exposure different BC subtypes , subject either triple-negative , ER+/HER2 negative , HER2 positive , enrol study . Twenty subject subtypes include . Dosage Regimen : ODM-201 give dose 600 mg ( 2 x 300 mg tablet ) twice daily ( b.i.d ) daily dose 1200 mg . The first day ODM-201 administration study consider Day 1 . The last ODM-201 intake day prior breast cancer surgery , pre-surgery visit occur . ODM-201 take approximately time day twice day . It recommend ODM-201 take food ; recommendation take breakfast dinner day . Supportive measure dose modification : A subject experience treatment-related grade 3 high adverse event ( AE ) must withdraw protocol treatment proceed surgery undergo EoS visit . In case grade 1-2 treatment-related AE , Investigator contact Medical Monitor dose reduction treatment hold require . Washout pre-trial : Prior treatment ovarian hormone replacement therapy stop least 28 day prior registration . Use investigational drug stop within 28 day enrollment . No major surgery within 28 day enrollment ( Major surgery define require general anesthesia respiratory assistance ; involve opening great cavity body , organs remove , normal anatomy alter ; imply risk severe hemorrhage ; imply risk life patient severe disability ) . Concomitant Medication : Subjects instruct consult Investigator take medication ( include over-the-counter medication ) . Supportive medication may provide prophylactically therapeutically per Investigator discretion . Any concomitant treatment NOT list consider permit study may prescribe clinically appropriate study : - Investigational agent protocol treatment . - Any additional standard investigational anticancer agent , chemotherapy , immunotherapy , targeted/biologic therapy , endocrine therapy , etc. , even utilized treatment non-cancer indication . ODM-201 must permanently discontinue upon initiation non-protocol standard investigational antineoplastic therapy prior surgery . Rescue Medication Risk Management : No specific pre-medication require . Based current available data , special warning precaution associate use ODM-201 . Premature Withdrawal / Discontinuation Criteria : The patient may withdraw study time without prejudice future medical treatment . In case , withdrawal clearly document subject 's clinical record . Should patient decide withdraw consent , effort make complete report observation thoroughly possible . A complete final evaluation time patient 's withdrawal make explanation patient withdraw study . After complete withdrawal consent , study procedure perform data collect . Discontinuation : The Investigator also discontinue protocol treatment follow condition meet : - Intercurrent illness change subject´s condition unacceptable toxicity warrant protocol treatment discontinuation accord Investigator 's judgment - Any event , condition , criterion would warrant discontinuation ODM-201 ( i.e. , severe toxicity ) , include grade ≥ 3 protocol-treatment related AE . - Any event , condition , reason would warrant ODM-201 hold maximum acceptable delay 7 consecutive day - Subject receive non-protocol anti-cancer therapy time protocol treatment - Subject 's decision withdraw protocol treatment - Lost follow - Death - Pregnancy - Investigator 's decision - Discontinuation study sponsor</detailed_description>
