Female nonreproductive potential ( FNRP ) eligible participate study meet least one follow condition : ) Females one following procedure document plan utilize assist reproductive technique ( e.g. , vitro fertilization donor embryo transfer ) : bilateral tubal ligation salpingectomy , hysteroscopic tubal occlusion procedure followup confirmation bilateral tubal occlusion , hysterectomy , bilateral Oophorectomy ( surgical menopause ) ; b ) Postmenopausal woman include Females 60 year age old , A practical definition accepts menopause 1 year without menses appropriate clinical profile , e.g. , age appropriate , 45 year , absence hormone replacement therapy ( HRT ) medical suppression menstrual cycle ( e.g. , leuprolide treatment ) . In questionable case woman le 60 year age , blood sample simultaneous follicle stimulate hormone estradiol fall central laboratory 's postmenopausal reference range confirmatory ( level need adjust specific laboratories/assays . Females few 60 year age , HRT wish continue , whose menopausal status doubt , enrol study . Otherwise , must discontinue HRT allow confirmation postmenopausal status prior study enrolment . For form HRT , least 2 4 week elapse cessation therapy blood draw ; interval depend type dosage HRT . Following confirmation postmenopausal status , enroll study resume use HRT . Capable give sign informed consent include compliance requirement restriction list consent form protocol . Psoriasis plaque variant ( i.e . acute psoriasis guttate , psoriasis punctata , psoriasis erythroderma pustular psoriasis ) . Current evidence another ongoing acute cutaneous infection , history repeat chronic significant skin infection ( unless irrelevant opinion investigator , i.e . onychomycosis , labial herpes minor diagnosis ) . Clinicallyrelevant skin disease skin pathology , may , opinion investigator , contraindicate participation interfere skin evaluation . ALT 2x Upper limit normal ( ULN ) bilirubin 1.5x ULN ( isolated bilirubin 1.5xULN acceptable bilirubin fractionate direct bilirubin le 35 percent ) . Current chronic history liver disease , know hepatic biliary abnormality ( exception Gilbert 's syndrome asymptomatic gallstone ) . Corrected QT interval use Bazett 's formula ( QTcB ) 450 millisecond ( msec ) QTcB 480 msec subject Bundle Branch Block . The QTcB base single QTcB value ECG obtain brief recording period . If QTcB outside threshold value , triplicate ECGs may perform QTcB value average . Any condition , judgment investigator , would put subject unacceptable risk participation trial . History malignancy within 5 year prior dose , except adequately treated noninvasive cancer skin ( basal squamous cell ) . Use prohibit concomitant medication product within defined period Day 1 visit trial History sensitivity study medication , component thereof history drug allergy , opinion investigator Medical Monitor , contraindicate participation .
