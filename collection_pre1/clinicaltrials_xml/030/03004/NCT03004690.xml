	<brief_summary>Pandemics re-emerging disease put pressure health care system prepare patient care sample logistics require enhanced personnel protective equipment ( PPE ) health care worker . We generate quantifiable data ergonomics PPE applicable health care set define error rate physically limit factor due PPE-induced restriction . Nineteen study volunteer test randomly allocate head- full body-ventilated PPE suit equip powered-air-purifying-respirators performed four different test ( two laboratory tutorial , time test selective attention test investigate reaction time , mobility , speed physical exercise ) 6 work hour 22°C one day 4 working hour 28°C another day . Error rate physical parameter ( fluid loss , body temperature , heart rate ) determine ergonomic-related parameter assess hourly use questionnaire . Depending PPE system restrictive factor : reduce dexterity due multiple glove layer , impaired visibility flexible face shield back pain related respirator fully ventilate suit .

	<detailed_description>In randomize study follow good clinical practice guideline nineteen study volunteer recruit wear one two different type randomly allocate PPE suit ( www.randomizer.at ) perform four different test six time 22°C one day four time 28°C another day local core facility clinical research center . Study participant Recruiting base voluntary registration response public announcement . The study subject local ethical committee review ( No . 23-321 ex 10/11 ) person give write informed consent accord Helsinki Declaration . Key lifestyle medical parameter document every subject . Exclusion criterion pregnancy , latex polyvinyl chloride allergy , claustrophobia , hypotension , history vein thrombosis , chronic obstructive pulmonary disease , epilepsy , cardiovascular pulmonary disease , infectious disease . Ten male nine female volunteer recruit , age 21 38 year body-mass-indices 17.2 32.5 . PPE suit Suit A : TychemR F overall whole-body ( DuPont de Nemours Company , 3M , Austria ) suit include sock reusable light hood VersafloTM S-655 ( 3M , Austria ) external 3M JupiterTM Powered Air Turbo Unit ( 3M Austria ) provide head-only positive pressure . Suit B : 3MTM JS-series Typ 3 Chemical Respiratory Protective Suit ( CRPS , 3M , Austria ) integrate respirator 3M Jupiter JP-ER-03 Powered Air Purifying Turbo ( 3M , Austria ) fix rucksack generate whole-suit positive pressure . With suit , Sempercare surgical glove ( Sempermed , powder-free 150 ; Semperit , Austria ) first layer , Ansell Sol-Vex gloves 37-900 ( Ansell , Medical GBU , VWR , Austria ) second layer white rubber boot wear . Gloves boot seal suit use adhesive tape . Tests I II perform mock-up glove box provide third layer latex glove . Tests Four test repeatedly perform well additional questionnaire comfort general condition test start every four-test-series . Test I comprise correct assembly position colour numbered 2 mL tube screwcaps storage device test fine motor skill , concentration error rate . Test II check skill different approach pipetting different volume coloured water 96-well microliter plate accord give pattern . Test III `` d2 Test Attention '' time test selective attention standardize refinement visual cancellation . In response discrimination similar visual stimulus , test measure process speed , rule compliance , quality performance , allow estimation individual attention concentration performance . Test IV investigate reaction time , mobility , speed physical exercise tap touch sensor direct sign screen ( tap test talent-systems sportconsulting Gmbh , www.werthner.at ) . All subject perform test randomisation ( www.randomizer.at ) start exercise . For example , subject one start test I subject two start test II time . After ten minute test time five minute break , subject one carry test II subject two test I . After five minute break , subject one start test III subject two performed test IV 10 minute period . Again five minute break , subject one continued test IV subject two test III . Subjects document individual comfort general condition structure questionnaire test start every series test . All four test repeat 6 time 22°C ( 6 hour total working time ) first test day four time 28°C ( 4 hour total working time ) second test day . Limiting factor work condition rank every series 1 10 questionnaire whereby rank 10 reason terminate study . Heart rate ( HR ) measure wireless heart rate monitor place sternum directly skin ( Garmin Forerunner 305 ) test series ( data use statistical analysis ) additionally record test series . Body temperature body weight measure well weight respective PPE calculate dehydration evaluation heat stress .</detailed_description>
