	<brief_summary>Video record term preterm newborn host AUBMC Neonate ICU collect . The videos capture movement , skin color change , positioning , feature relevant diagnosis question . Recorded video image analyse computer software use Eulerian Video magnification technology ; image correlate simultaneously record physiological parameter ( heart rate , respiratory rate saturation ) . Images annotate clinician . Correlation skin coloration differential annotate physiological parameter may establish physiological index . These may use extrapolate existence absence disease state .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Recent medical technological advancement progressively lead increase survival rate term premature neonates . This project concern detect early sign physiological disorder term preterm baby base Eulerian Video Magnification , statistical analysis , expert knowledge . Video recording skin coloration differential normal sick neonate may use establish norm two major population . Those possibly feature use develop automatic contactless , noninvasive monitoring diagnostic system may detect early sign disease . Early detection may lead early diagnosis preemptive treatment result well outcome lower cost medical intervention . The objective project adapt Eulerian Video Magnification monitor physiologic change diagnose potential disturbance term preterm neonate different gestational age . EVM use video recording magnify skin color signal time thus permit analysis physiological state change heart rate perfusion . Those change would correlate particular condition disease state purpose automatic early diagnosis alarm issuance . Being contactless non-invasive , proposed system would particularly helpful vulnerable population sick neonate . It may lead early treatment , improve outcome , possibly , decrease hospital stay . Parents infant admit neonatal intensive care unit ( NICU ) AUBMC inform study Attending physician . The medical research assistant approach interested potential participant . An informed consent obtain prior enrollment . All infant admit NICU eligible . Those divided four equal group : 1 ) `` normal '' term , 2 ) `` normal '' preterm , 3 ) `` sick '' term , 4 ) `` sick '' preterm baby , `` normal '' health state define medical team `` physiologically stable '' . The medical team considers `` sick '' state base pathological symptom bradycardia , apnea , hypotension among others . We target collect video recording total eighty baby pilot number period eight month . Each baby record minimum twenty four hour . A subset eighty baby consider control group reference . The control group select base normal physiological state exclude baby sepsis , respiratory distress , congenital anomaly .</detailed_description>
