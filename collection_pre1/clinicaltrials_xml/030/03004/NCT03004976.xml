	<brief_summary>The primary objective study determine efficacy single intravenous infusion unrelated donor umbilical cord blood ( UCB ) improve functional outcome patient ischemic stroke . Eligible subject receive intravenous infusion UCB placebo 3-10 day follow stroke . Subjects receive immunosuppressive myeloablative medication prior infusion . Subjects follow one year post infusion safety efficacy . Assessments examine safety tolerability infusion , change neurological symptom , change quality life , emotional cognitive status . Assessments occur 24 hour post infusion , 30 , 90 , 180 365 day post infusion .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>This multicenter , placebo control , randomize , double blind Phase 2 study 100 subject 18-90 year age sustain recent ischemic stroke . Potential subject screen consented day stroke ( Day 1 ) . Treatment umbilical cord blood ( UCB ) cell placebo administer intravenously single infusion early 3 day later 10 day patient 's stroke . UCB unit select accredited U.S. public cord bank base blood type , race target cell dose range 0.5 5 x 10^7 total nucleate cell count ( TNCC ) /kg . Study subject receive immunosuppressive myeloablative medication prior infusion cord blood placebo . All subject , family medical staff blind treatment arm . When subject randomize study drug clinical site without cord blood bank , select cord blood unit ( CBU ) ship frozen overnight site . Once select available site , CBU thaw , wash , test , release infuse intravenously use common standard operating procedure ( SOPs ) sit . For subject randomize placebo , diluent appearance odor CBU prepare . Patients baseline magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) assess 1 , 3 , 6 , 12 month functional outcome . All patient receive standard care therapy enrol study subject strongly encourage participate rehabilitative therapy . The primary objective study determine , randomize , placebo control trial , efficacy single intravenous ( IV ) infusion unrelated donor UCB improve functional outcome patient ischemic stroke . The secondary objective follow : 1 . To describe safety tolerability single IV infusion unrelated donor UCB patient ischemic stroke 2 . To evaluate efficacy single IV infusion unrelated donor UCB improvement neurological symptom follow ischemic stroke 3 . To evaluate efficacy single IV infusion unrelated donor UCB improvement quality life emotional cognitive status patient ischemic stroke</detailed_description>
