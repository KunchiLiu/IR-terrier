	<brief_summary>The investigator aim evaluate ursochol therapy functional dyspepsia . The objective study evaluate effect ursochol duodenal permeability dyspeptic symptom duodenal low-grade inflammation , bile acid composition , bile acid receptor expression , nutrient tolerance intragastric pressure . Cross-over , control , randomize , double blind , placebo-controlled trial 4 week intake ursodeoxycholic acid ( ursochol ) versus 4 week intake placebo 4 week washout period . Two study day plan week 4 week 12 . During 14 week , patient fill diary . And 14 week total , patient discontinue intake proton pump inhibitor , drug effect gastric motility NSAIDs replace oral anticonception non-oral anticonception . Every two week study investigator call participant see are/if discomfort side effect .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Functional dyspepsia patient recruit screened inclusion study . The participant ask take proton pump inhibitor , drug effect gastric motility NSAIDs oral anticonception fourteen week . First , stop daily drug intake PPIs NSAIDs two week , take placebo UDC four week , two dos every day lunch dinner . Afterwards , washout period four week , four week UDC placebo intake . The patient receive diary describe symptoms/discomforts every day 14 week . All participant investigator blind nature ( UDC placebo ) pill . The random order certain patient get pill decide pharmacy UZ Leuven also unknown investigator ( double blind ) . During week two , four , six , eight , ten twelve phone conversation patient discuss symptoms/discomforts . During week four week twelve , patient come hospital one day overnight fast . First , ask fill bundle questionnaire concern physical complaint , depression , anxiety ( disturbance ) , pain/disease , body/interoceptive awareness , trauma/abuse personality give fecal sample 've collect day . The fecal sample use evaluate gastrointestinal microbiota FD patient . Then , two blood sample , evaluate liver function parameter bile acid synthesis , take endoscopy perform . All endoscopy perform experienced endoscopist ( Jan Tack ) nine duodenal biopsy ( 2 biopsy time ) ( Radial Jaw™3 needle ; outside diameter 2.2mm ; Boston Scientific , 302 Parkway , Global Park , Heredia , Costa Rica ) obtain . To measure vitro transepithelial resistance , 3 biopsy examine use adapt mini-Ussing chamber system . After equilibration , mucosal side tissue expose 4kDa FITC-dextran measure paracellular permeability . A sample take serosal side 2h 30min interval . The concentration fluoresceïn measure use fluorescence plate reader . Also , two biopsy use mRNA extraction subsequent cDNA synthesis . This cDNA use measure gene expression bile acid receptor mean real-time RT-PCR . In addition , one biopsy prepared immunohistochemistry two use western blot measure change distribution/expression bile acid receptor protein . One biopsy obtain study ultrastructural alteration transmission electron microscopy . After endoscopy , aspiration catheter position duodenum . The position catheter briefly check fluoroscopy ( typically 2-3 second , however never 15 second ) . After position catheter , fix subject 's chin he/she ask take place chair remainder experiment . For one hour , every 15 minute duodenal fluid collect fasted state . Next , high resolution manometry catheter ( HRM ) place gastric fundus measure intragastric pressure perfusion tube ( OD 2 mm ) introduce nose positioned stomach . After position catheter , fix subject 's chin he/she ask take place chair remainder experiment . After stabilization period 15 minute , intragastric infusion nutrient drink ( Nutridrink , Nutricia ; 630 KJ , 6 g protein , 18.4 g carbohydrate , 5.8 g lipid per 100 mL ) start constant speed 60 mL per minute ( determine automate system use peristaltic pump ) . Intragastric pressure measure 36-channel high resolution manometry system , intragastric manometry probe . At 1-minute interval , subject ask score satiation use graphic rating scale combine verbal descriptor scale grade 0-5 . At 5-minute interval volunteer ask fill VAS 11 dyspeptic symptom . The intragastric infusion stop soon volunteer score maximally one 11 epigastric symptom score 5 reach satiety score . 10 minute thereafter , catheter disconnect remove . After nutrient drink infusion , duodenal fluid collect every 15 minute 1.5 hour fed state . Finally , last catheter remove volunteer go home .</detailed_description>
