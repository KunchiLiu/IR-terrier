	<brief_summary>The main goal study evaluate ability single administration tocilizumab reduce myocardial damage patient present acute ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction ( STEMI ) . Secondary objective assess impact treatment : ( ) final infarct size , ( ii ) leave ventricular size function , ( iii ) inflammation , ( iv ) extracellular matrix remodeling , ( v ) lipid parameter , ( vi ) platelet activation additional pro- anti-thrombotic parameter , ( vii ) study drug safety tolerability .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Myocardial infarction ( MI ) major contributor morbidity mortality Western world . The main determinant death complication infarct size , limitation infarct size therefore important objective strategy improve outcome . In patient present acute ST segment elevation myocardial infarction ( STEMI ) , urgent myocardial reperfusion percutaneous coronary intervention ( PCI ) effective treatment end . However , despite PCI , morbidity mortality patient STEMI remain substantial . This fact suggest , adjuvant strategy require reduce infarct size improve outcome . The inflammatory cytokine interleukin ( IL ) -6 important mediator plaque destabilisation rupture acute coronary syndrome ( ACS ) may contribute ischemia-reperfusion injury succeed revascularisation . Experimental study suggest IL-6 inhibition limit infarct size anti-inflammatory mechanism . ( ref ) The investigator recently conduct double blind , placebo control trial 117 patient non-ST segment elevation myocardial infarction ( NSTEMI ) present within 72 hour onset chest pain . In study , single , intravenous dose IL-6 antagonist tocilizumab reduce inflammatory activity 50 % day subsequent intervention . Importantly , tocilizumab also reduce troponin T ( TnT ) level , suggest patient receive tocilizumab sustain less myocardial damage patient receive placebo.1 Interleukin-6 inhibition might limit infarct size reduce myocardial inflammation , theoretically , could also inhibit repair process within injured area . While recent study suggest IL-6 inhibition largely favourable effect NSTEMI , remain see similar , beneficial effect obtain patient STEMI . On background , investigator want investigate effect tocilizumab patient acute STEMI . The postulate single dose tocilizumab ( RoActemraÂ® ) favourable effect infarct size , assess marker myocardial necrosis cardiac magnetic resonance imaging ( CMR ) , without negative consequence repair process patient . The hypothesis test randomised , double blind , placebo control trial comprise 200 patient acute STEMI . This phase 2 study new excite anti-inflammatory strategy cardiovascular disease . It conduct three experience , high volume centre Norway , target new yet unmodified mechanism myocardial infarction . The ambition improve prognosis patient ACS , potential change clinical practice .</detailed_description>
