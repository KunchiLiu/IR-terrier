	<brief_summary>The purpose study ass relationship blood glucose level person Multiple Sclerosis ( MS ) experience relapse receive intravenous steroid relapse , recovery relapse . Steroid exposure commonly lead elevated serum blood glucose , however , standardize monitoring blood glucose level outpatient set common . The clinical impact associate elevate blood glucose steroid administration unknown . We hypothesize blood glucose response steroid treatment clinically relevant MS-relapse recovery .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Multiple Sclerosis ( MS ) neuroinflammatory degenerative central nervous system disorder . The majority patient early relapsing-remitting course . Standard treatment MS-relapse intravenous methylprednisolone ( IVMP ) , typically 1000 mg daily 3 day . Despite IVMP treatment , &gt; 40 % MS patient experience residual deficit MS-relapse . Potential risk factor poor relapse recovery remain unclear . Elevated serum blood glucose common well-defined consequence steroid administration , attribute steroid-related reduction insulin sensitivity . Individuals pre-treatment insulin resistance ( e.g . diabetic ) exhibit amplified hyperglycemic response . Reduced mobility , sedentary lifestyle , repeat exposure steroids- common MS - recognize risk factor insulin resistance . These factor may make MS patient particularly susceptible steroid-induced hyperglycemia . While , MS patient commonly receive intravenous steroid , clinical impact associate hyperglycemia unknown . Study Design Methods Timeline : Study require 3 visit 6 month period . Subjects : MS subject experience acute relapse recruit study . Prior study procedure , PI research coordinator obtain full write informed consent . Baseline Measurements : age , race/ethnicity , sex , weight , height , waist circumference , blood pressure , previous steroid exposure ( date , frequency , steroid type dose ) , smoke history , family history diabetes . Medication review include MS disease-modifying therapy , symptomatic medication , non-MS-related medication . Additional MS-related information include date initial MS-symptom onset , MS diagnosis , onset present relapse symptom . Oral glucose tolerance test ( OGTT ) &amp; Matsuda Index : Prior steroid administration , MS subject undergo 2-hour OGTT . OGTT Matsuda Index repeat 3- 6-month follow-up visit . Blood study : HgA1c ( hemoglobin A1C ) , fast lipid panel ( LDL-C , HDL-C , triglyceride , total cholesterol ) , insulin growth factor , vitamin D level , adiponectin level , homocysteine level , leptin level . All laboratory test complete baseline , 3- 6-month visit . Surveys : Subjects complete survey relate perceived disability , relapse severity recovery , MS-related symptom . Functional testing : EDSS , MS Functional Composite , timed-walk testing , accelerometry , low contrast visual acuity test ( LCVA ) symbol digit modality test ( SDMT ) . Intravenous steroid treatment : Standardized 1000 mg intravenous methylprednisolone ( IVMP ) daily 3 day ( reconstituted 0.9 % sodium chloride ) . IVMP bill patient insurance part routine clinical care . Blood glucose monitoring : Bayer Contour Next glucometer use measure capillary BG level 6 time daily ( Subjects instruct check BG start day screen continue BG check ( ) return appointment 5-7 day steroid treatment completion total 8-10 day . Subjects require avoid snack meal 3 day IVMP treatment .</detailed_description>
