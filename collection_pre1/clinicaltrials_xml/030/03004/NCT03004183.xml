	<detailed_description>This Phase II trial determine efficacy safety stereotactic body radiation therapy ( SBRT ) situ oncolytic virus therapy use window opportunity treatment pembrolizumab patient metastatic triple negative breast cancer ( TNBC ) metastatic non-small cell lung cancer ( NSCLC ) . In situ oncolytic virus therapy consist adenovirus-mediated expression herpes simplex virus thymidine kinase ( ADV/HSV-tk ) plus valacyclovir . Male female patient age ≥ 18 year histologically confirm locally advanced metastatic TNBC relapse refractory 1 line standard care therapy histologically cytologically confirm metastatic NSCLC immunotherapy naïve progress platinum-containing chemotherapy eligible participate study . ADV/HSV-tk ( 5 x 1011 viral particle ) 2-mL total volume inject intratumorally Day 0 study . Valacyclovir orally administer dose 2 g three time daily 14 day . Valacyclovir treatment administer 24 hour gene vector injection Day 1 Day 15 study . SBRT 30 gray ( Gy ; 6 Gy X 5 fraction ) administer 2 week Day 2 Day 16 study . Pembrolizumab ( 200 mg ) administer intravenously 30 minute every 3 week start Day 17 study continue disease progression unacceptable toxicity . The primary endpoint objective response rate ADV/HSV-tk + valacyclovir therapy combination SBRT use window opportunity treatment pembrolizumab patient metastatic TNBC metastatic NSCLC . RECIST 1.1 use ass treatment response . Secondary endpoint include ) duration response ; b ) overall survival progression-free survival rate ; c ) toxicity ( toxicity define treatment-related death ≥ grade 3 toxicity exclude alopecia constitutional symptom assess NCI CTCAE v4.03 ) ; ) antitumor activity ADV/HSV-tk plus valacyclovir therapy combination SBRT use window opportunity treatment pembrolizumab .</detailed_description>
