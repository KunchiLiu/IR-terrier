	<brief_summary>BACKGROUND AND SIGNIFICANCE : Diabetes national health problem , yet Latinos low-income household great risk . Although guideline recommend patient learn self-management strategy , many people able effectively control diabetes . Studies show culturally competent self-management programming help , patient preliminary research indicate program sufficiently respect patient ' cultural value account socio-economic limitation . STUDY AIMS : This project compare two model culturally competent diabetes self-management programming . The hypothesis program model best considers patient culture accommodate patient socio-economic circumstance best outcomes . COMPARATORS : 2 diabetes self-management program model use many Latino patient low-income household Albuquerque , New Mexico 1 . The Diabetes Self-Management Support Empowerment Model 2 . The Chronic Care Model STUDY POPULATION : Patients 240 individual consider Latino low-income household . In addition , 240 patient identify correspond social support participate . Outcomes measure base 240 patient participant . Social support data measure covariate understand patient outcome . PRIMARY OUTCOME : Improved capacity diabetes self-management measured diabetes knowledge patient activation ability put knowledge action . SECONDARY OUTCOME : Successful diabetes self-management measure reduced A1c , BMI depression . Patient stress level also measure use test hair sample identify level cortisol biological marker chronic stress . METHODS : Statistical calculation conduct make sure thing compare difference program design difference individual patient characteristic . This study compare whether program improve diabetes health knowledge , ability act , A1c , BMI , depression stress control , determine program best .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>BACKGROUND AND SIGNIFICANCE : Diabetes national health priority diabetes risk extremely high Latinos low-income household . Health guideline recommend individual learn strategy self-management diabetes , get people adopt require lifestyle change challenge many people able prevent pre-diabetes escalate control diabetes . Systematic review show culturally competent self-management programming significantly improve diabetes outcomes , different model culturally competent programming develop . STUDY AIMS : The goal study compare effectiveness 2 distinct evidence-based model culturally competent diabetes health promotion . The hypothesis program model interface synergistically patient 's culture everyday life circumstance best diabetes health outcome . Aim 1 : Characterize way three culturally competent diabetes self-management program interface patient culture socioeconomic context Aim 2 : Measure compare improvement patient capacity diabetes self-management . Aim 3 : Measure compare patient success self-management Study Description OVERALL STUDY DESIGN : This study follow NIH standard mixed-method research integrate data quantitative qualitative component study iterative fashion . The sample size power estimate base realistic evaluation effect size . Data collection involve programmatic assessment , interview , focus group , survey , test A1c , BMI , stress . The research team expertise experience patient-engaged research necessary conduct propose study investigator institutional infrastructure support academic community partnership necessary study . MAIN COMPONENTS OF THE INTERVENTION AND COMPARATORS : This study compare 2 diabetes self-management program serve large Latino patient population low-income household Albuquerque , New Mexico 1 . The Diabetes Self-Management Support Empowerment Model 2 . The Chronic Care Model PRIMARY &amp; SECONDARY OUTCOMES : PRIMARY : Improved capacity diabetes self-management measured improvement diabetes knowledge diabetes-related patient activation . SECONDARY : Successful diabetes self-management . ANALYTIC METHODS : Descriptive statistic calculate summarize patient characteristic . Means standard deviation median quartile calculate continuous variable compare across site ANOVA Kruskal-Wallis test , depend distribution data . Frequencies percentages calculated categorical variable compare chi-square test Fisher 's exact test , appropriate . Significant difference note adjust possible confounding , variable consider inclusion covariates analysis primary secondary outcome addition clinically meaningful variable interaction . It expect patient characteristic similar across two treatment site ; however , control potential difference population , investigator adjust potential confounding covariates use propensity score stratify subject group base probability attend particular treatment site give particular demographic characteristic include sex , age , primary language , level education , nativity , type insurance . Patients group quintile propensity score total five stratum analyze primary secondary outcome independently . Analyses perform standard statistical software . Propensity score matching allow causal inference non-experimental setting select similar subset comparison unit treatment group across high-dimensional set pretreatment characteristic . For qualitative data , investigator conduct rigorous , discipline , empirical analysis base plausibility , credibility relevance . The investigator conduct theory-driven qualitative content analysis , read transcript identify conceptual category pattern relate specified domain inquiry , create qualitative codebook , develop conceptual summary transcript . Following review summary , investigator code transcript systematic theme subthemes explore interconnection theme category develop holistic interpretation data ( `` constant comparison '' ) .</detailed_description>
