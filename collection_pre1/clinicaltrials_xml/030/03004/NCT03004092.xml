	<brief_summary>Diagnosis invasive aspergillosis remain difficult , often base combination patient characteristic , radiological microbiological finding . To data , galactomannan ( GM ) well-validated biomarker available . However , GM still shortcomings . There therefore need new , complementary biomarkers . In study , two test , bi ( methylthio ) gliotoxin ( bmGT ) lateral flow device , validate hematological population , compare GM .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Diagnosis invasive aspergillosis often difficult achieve certainty , require direct evidence invasive growth histopathological examination . A probable diagnosis suspect base clinical mycological evidence disease , presence susceptible patient . The EORTC-MSG guideline offer widely accept basis diagnosis . Under guideline , mycological evidence consist positive culture aspergillus spp , detection galactomannan ( GM ) relevant body sample . GM part Aspergillus mould detect use commercially available immunoenzymatic sandwich microplate assay . However , like biomarkers , galactomannan far perfect biomarker . Several beta-lactam antibiotic know cause false positive , anti-mould therapy report significantly low sensitivity [ 1 ] . Additional biomarkers could circumvent problem would therefore beneficial . A potential new target gliotoxin ( GT ) , secondary metabolite several fungi , clinically important Aspergillus [ 2 ] . GT release invasive growth , therefore use biomarker invasive fungal disease GT-producing fungi . However , GT quickly remove red blood cell circulation , make unreliable marker [ 3 ] . A degradation product GT , bi ( methylthio ) gliotoxin ( bmGT ) , appear stable take red blood cell . Serum bmGT bmGT bronchoalveolar lavage ( BAL ) fluid already show small study potential marker invasive aspergillosis , especially use combination GM [ 3-5 ] . Recently , another highly specific test become available , base detection extracellular glycoprotein secrete growth Aspergillus specie , use monoclonal antibody ( JF5 ) immunochromatographic lateral-flow device ( LFD ) [ 6,7 ] . This test allow fast ( &lt; 15 minute ) test use commercially available device . In study , LFD bmGT characterize validated hematological population , compare GM .</detailed_description>
