	<brief_title>MEDI4736 With Selumetinib KRAS Mutant Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer ( NSCLC )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Study Groups : If participant find eligible take part study , participant randomly assign ( flip coin ) 1 2 study group . This do one know one study group well , , bad group . - If participant Group 1 , participant take selumetinib 2 time day . - If participant Group 2 , participant take selumetinib 2 time day Days 1-7 15-22 study cycle . All participant also receive MEDI4736 . Study Drug Administration : Each study cycle 28 day . Participant take dose selumetinib 12 hour apart fast ( nothing eat drink except water ) 1 hour 2 hour take selumetinib . Participant follow dosing schedule participant assign ( describe Study Groups ) . Participant record selumetinib dose dose diary give participant . Participant bring diary participant 's study visit end every cycle . Both group receive MEDI4736 vein 60 minute Day 1 every cycle . Participant give standard drug help decrease risk side effect . Participant may ask study staff information drug give risk . Length Study : Participant may receive study drug long doctor think participant 's best interest . Participant longer able take study drug disease get bad , intolerable side effect occur , participant unable follow study direction . Participation study Follow-Up Period . Study Visits : About 14 day first dose study drug : - Participant physical exam . - Blood ( 3 teaspoon ) urine collect routine test . - If doctor think need , participant EKG . On Day 1 every cycle : - Participant physical exam . - Blood ( 3 teaspoon ) urine collect routine test . - If doctor think need , participant eye exam . - If participant become pregnant doctor think need , blood ( ½ teaspoon ) urine collect pregnancy test . On Day 1 Cycle 1 Week 16 , participant EKG . Participant triplicate EKGs Day 1 Cycle 1 . At Week 8 every 8 week , participant CT scan MRI check status disease . At Week 12 every 12 week , participant ECHO multigated acquisition ( MUGA ) scan . End-of-Study Visits : At 30 day 90 day participant 's last dose study drug : - Participant physical exam . - Blood ( 3 teaspoon ) draw routine test . - Participant EKG . - If participant become pregnant doctor think need , blood ( ½ teaspoon ) urine collect pregnancy test . Follow Up Period : About every 6 month , participant call member study staff ask participant participant start new treatment outside study . These call last 10 minute time . If doctor think need , participant may return clinic either CT scan MRI check status disease . This investigational study . MEDI4736 selumetinib FDA approve commercially available . They currently use research purpose . The study doctor explain study drug design work . Up 76 participant enrol study . All take part MD Anderson .</detailed_description>
