	<detailed_description>Accumulating evidence support pain , whether measure number pain site pain severity , associate poorer cognitive function mobility , fall risk old person . The attentional burden pain may factor high rate fall among old person chronic multisite pain . Tai Chi holistically integrate physical cognitive function offer possibility alleviate pain also improve attention mobility many old adult chronic multisite pain . This propose pilot study Tai Chi intervention among old adult multisite pain direct extension investigator ' current work examine attentional demand chronic pain old population . The main purpose randomize control trial ass feasibility acceptability 12-week Tai Chi program older adult chronic multisite pain history fall . The investigator examine effect Tai Chi pain characteristic , cognitive function , cognitively-mediated mobility , level pain-related biomarkers community-dwelling old adult multisite pain least one fall past year ( 65 year old , N=30 Tai Chi group N=30 mild exercise control group ) . The specific aim R21 developmental grant application : 1 ) ass feasibility acceptability 12-week randomize control Tai Chi program preparation large trial community-residing older adult . Specifically , investigator : 1A ) Evaluate feasibility recruitment engagement old adult chronic multisite pain 12-week Tai Chi intervention ; 1B ) Determine optimal Tai Chi/exercise protocol data collection protocol planning large trial ; 1C ) Assess adherence randomize participant assigned treatment ; 1D ) Obtain information difference outcome measure variation use power analysis large trial . 2 ) To examine efficacy Tai Chi pain characteristic , pain-related biomarkers , cognitive function cognitively-mediated mobility . Specifically , investigator : 2A ) Determine effect Tai Chi measure pain severity pain interference ; 2B ) Determine effect Tai Chi performance test attention executive function ; 2C ) Determine effect Tai Chi performance complex mobility task ( dual task gait measure ) ; 2D ) Determine effect Tai Chi level C-reactive protein ( CRP ) , interleukin 6 ( IL-6 ) , tumor necrosis factor alpha ( TNF-α ) , beta endorphin ( β-endorphin ) . This study provide novel insight effect non-invasive behavioral intervention , Tai Chi , chronic multisite pain associate cognitive-motor function old adult . The result exploratory study provide critical pilot data guide inform large randomize control trial design establish clinical significance Tai Chi chronic multisite pain old adult investigate mechanism Tai Chi may improve chronic pain pain-related cognitive-motor function use brain image human genetic approach .</detailed_description>
