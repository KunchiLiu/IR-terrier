	<brief_summary>The study investigator-initiated trial compare two different catheter ( standard versus ultrasound assist ) treatment acute high risk pulmonary embolism ( blood clot lung artery evidence heart strain ) . Patients already plan procedure randomize standard catheter-directed thrombolysis ( CDT ) ultrasound-assisted catheter thrombolysis ( USAT ) . Both catheter currently use routinely practice treatment pulmonary embolism , know USAT superior standard CDT , former much expensive commonly use . The purpose study learn catheter-directed therapy suitable patient pulmonary embolism ( PE ) , candidate standard catheter direct therapy ( CDT ) , ultrasound-assisted catheter direct therapy ( USAT ) , provide information regard cost effectiveness two different type treatment . A total 80 patient plan recruit . All medication administration , procedures in-hospital test perform routine clinical practice . The study compare short term long term outcome : resolution blood clot CT scan , right ventricular size improvement , quality life symptoms 3 12 month , cost effectiveness .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Standard vs Ultrasound-assisted Catheter Thrombolysis Submassive Pulmonary Embolism</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Acute pulmonary embolism ( PE ) account 5-10 % in-hospital death . Systemic anticoagulation ( AC ) standard care thrombolysis recommend high mortality risk . Catheter-directed therapy , mainly standard catheter-directed thrombolysis ( CDT ) ultrasound-accelerated thrombolysis ( USAT ) , introduce new , effective , safer treatment modality . USAT modification standard catheter thrombolysis , utilize system local ultrasound dissociate fibrin matrix thrombus , allow deep penetration lytics . However , limited data compare two treatment . More rapid clearance pulmonary thrombus USAT compare standard CDT may prove effective regard clinical outcome cost ( e.g . via reduced length ICU hospital stay ) . Alternatively , thrombus clearance similar , cost USAT may exceed cost CDT ( equipment disposable ) , without offer potential advantage . This control , randomize study seek determine ultrasound acceleration add benefit outcomes cost catheter-directed thrombolysis patient acute submassive PE . The treatment CDT USAT standard care submassive PE participant randomize receive one treatment . Participants follow visit 3 month 12 month post procedure . All procedure , test , follow visit accord current standard care .</detailed_description>
