	<brief_title>EVALUATION OF RESPIRATORY MECHANICS AND FUNCTIONALITY IN PATIENTS WITH CHRONIC OBSTRUCTIVE PULMONARY DISEASE</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Individuals COPD present restriction daily life due change bodily disorder promote disease , change type muscle fiber chronic inflammatory process , cause low level physical activity quality life , besides closely Related need hospitalization increase mortality . A cross-sectional study convenience sample perform Laboratory Cardiopulmonary Physiotherapy Federal University Pernambuco period December 2016 February 2018 . As measurement body composition perform bio-balance scale , Evaluation peripheral muscle strength use dynamometer , load cell electromyography , kinematic thoracic-abdominal measure optoelectronic plethysmography , respiratory metabolic response verify 6-minute walk test use gas analyzer , evaluation mobility diaphragmatic thickness use ultrasound associated pneumotachograph .</detailed_description>
