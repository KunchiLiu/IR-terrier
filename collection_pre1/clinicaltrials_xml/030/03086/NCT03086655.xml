	<brief_summary>Currently available method monitor antiretroviral ( ARV ) adherence HIV treatment prevention , self-report , pill count , medication electronic monitoring system ( MEMS ) , device wirelessly monitor adherence real-time , multiple limitation , include over-reporting , inability ass pill ingestion , size/expense . Our multidisciplinary research team University California , San Francisco ( UCSF ) India design new adherence-monitoring device call `` Tel-Me-Box '' small , low-cost , rechargeable , inconspicuous , could program deliver tailor real-time adherence reminder follow additional hardware modification . The aim study modify validate discreet Tel-Me-Box ( TMB ) adherence monitor reminder device hair ARV concentration pharmacologic measure drug ingestion/adherence , measure pioneer validated team , expectation device intermittent hair monitoring could widespread utility HIV non-HIV adherence science , India globally .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Tel-Me-Box : Validating Testing Novel , Low-cost , Real-time Monitoring Device With Hair Level Analysis Among Adherence-challenged Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Novel , validate method monitor adherence HIV treatment real time urgently need give well-known limitation self-reported adherence , pill count , MEMS cap . In order scalable sustainable resource-rich resource limited setting , device need low-cost design way increase risk accidental HIV disclosure subsequent stigma . Devices monitor adherence real time provide tailor reminder patient medication-taking potential greatly improve adherence HIV treatment well treatment chronic disease . Our Indo-US collaborative team conduct research HIV stigma , ARV adherence pattern barrier , treatment outcome , drug resistance decade . The study investigator also pioneer use ARV concentration small hair sample measure long-term ARV adherence resource-rich limited setting ( RLS ) . In response need novel adherence measure , team recently develop Tel-Me-Box , small , low-cost adherence device monitor adherence real time , transmit wireless signal server open . The investigator propose add hardware enable server software wirelessly program device activate tailor medication-taking reminder ( via beep , vibration , LED light ) period inactivity . The device fit pocket , hold 1-2 week ' worth medication , long battery life , simple charge capability , find acceptable Indian patient adherence challenge pilot study . Since HIV stigma serve profound barrier ARV adherence many setting , include India , small , inconspicuous nature Tel-Me-Box , along ability deliver tailor reminder feature honor participant ' privacy concern . Since electronic device monitor assess actual drug ingestion , validate biological measure adherence , ARV hair concentration , crucial . This study include pilot randomize control trial ( RCT ) examine acceptability feasibility estimate effect size automate tailored real-time adherence reminder hair ARV concentration , device- monitor adherence , viral load suppression adherence-challenged patient . The aim study validate TMB innovative tool ass adherence predict treatment outcome , demonstrate feasibility hair analyse RLS . If successful , pilot data available efficacy Tel-Me-Box automate , tailor reminder future large scale RCT .</detailed_description>
