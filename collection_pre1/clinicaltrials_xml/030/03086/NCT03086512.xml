	<brief_summary>The study design principal investigator , Dr. Alastair Younger , St. Paul 's Hospital Foot Ankle Research Group , conduct study . The study fund Acumed LLC , manufacturer Health Canada approve Acutrak 2Â® - 7.5 fully thread screw . The purpose study ass compare effectiveness fully thread screw versus partially thread screw subtalar fusion , order determine effect thread configuration success fusion procedure . Efficacy assess primarily compute tomography ( CT ) analysis percent bone bridge across subtalar joint 12 24 week post-op . Outcome score also administer compare general health foot function two group baseline multiple post-op follow-up visit . Additional resource utilization ( i.e . additional clinic and/or hospital admission ) also compare two group post-op .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Study Comparing Computerized Tomographic Progression Bone Bridging After Subtalar Fusion Using Fully Partially Threaded Screws</brief_title>
	<detailed_description />
	<criteria>The subject least 19 year age . The subject consider skeletally mature . The subject qualifies subtalar fusion base physical examination and/ past medical history include isolated osteoarthritis , posttraumatic , degenerative , rheumatoid arthritis ankle . The subject experience severe pain subtalar joint could cure nonoperative treatment option . The patient may undergo subtalar fusion part triple arthrodesis . The patient normally function ankle joint , solidly fuse ankle joint , wellfunctioning ankle joint replacement . The patient may forefoot pathology address either prior concurrent surgery ( osteotomy fusion ) . An ankle joint replacement ankle joint fusion may perform sit . The patient consent either arthroscopic open procedure . The subject able comply postoperative evaluation visit . The subject consent receive either cancellous autograft bone graft synthetic bone graft substitute The subject : 1 . Severe osteoporosis 2 . Neuromuscular impairment 3 . Prior infection affect joint The subject currently acute infection , opinion Investigator , may complicate healing . The subject know sensitivity allergic reaction screw material . The subject insufficient bone stock bone quality support screw . The subject major risk factor nonunion ( ex . poorly control diabetes current smoker ) . The subject undergoing revision prior subtalar fusion . The subject BMI &gt; 50 kg/m2 . The subject know pregnant , plan become pregnant study period The investigator judge subject unable unlikely remain compliant followup due physical mental condition ( ex . currently treat psychiatric disorder , senile dementia , Alzheimer 's disease , etc. ) . The subject unable provide inform consent . The subject unable communicate research team . The subject unable comply followup . The subject history substance addiction ( e.g . recreational drug , narcotic , alcohol ) within 12 month prior screen study entry The subject prisoner , know suspected transient The subject either consent receiving either cancellous autograft bone graft synthetic bone graft substitute The subject receive structural autograft allograft ( femoral head graft tri cortical iliac crest graft ) fill defect great 1cm3</criteria>
