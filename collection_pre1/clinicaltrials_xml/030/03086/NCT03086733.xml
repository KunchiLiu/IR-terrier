	<brief_title>Phase II Lung Metcore - Preoperative Metformin Lung Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Title study : Phase II study single agent pre-operative metformin patient clinical stage I - IIIA NSCLC proceed surgical resection . 'Lung Metcore Study ' Objectives : To evaluate effect short-term pre-operative exposure metformin operable stage I IIIA NSCLC . Primary end-points : - The difference proportion proliferate NSCLC cell ( measure compare Ki67 level ) prior metformin treatment . - The rate apoptosis NSCLC ( measure TUNEL assay ) prior metformin treatment . Secondary end-points : - The safety tolerability preoperative metformin administration NSCLC , assess National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria Adverse Events ( NCI CTCAE [ version 4.0 ] ) - Pathologic change lung tissue metformin administration . Study Design : This trial design single center , open label , single arm Phase II study pre-operative window metformin treatment stage I - IIIA NSCLC . The efficacy metformin assess effect marker cellular proliferation apoptosis . Exploratory analysis molecular marker hypothesize effect metformin NSCLC also carry . Furthermore , change serum ligand growth signal pathway lung cancer metformin treatment measure . Number patient : Thus , total expect sample size approximately 50 patient , anticipate minimal loss eligible participant treatment intolerance acceleration surgery . Accrual estimate 1.5 2 patient per month 25 33 month , base accrual rate recent pre-operative window thoracic surgical study UHN . • Metformin start dose 850mg daily increase 850mg b.i.d . ( morning evening ) 5 day tolerate . Treatment give time enrollment till even prior surgery . Correlatives : The follow molecular serological correlative biomarkers consider covariates analysis primary endpoint phase II study . Covariate pretreatment value change covariate value ( applicable ) use estimate relationship covariates patient 's Ki67 apoptotic response use logistic regression . It note several covariates test number patient analyze small , thus , test may statistically significant due chance even association exists . - Genetic Mutations NSCLC ( On pre-treatment biopsy molecular technique ) : - LKB1 mutational status ( Sequencing ) - EGFR , Ras , AKT , PI3K mutation ( Oncocarta platform ) - EGFR gene copy number ( FISH ) - ALK rearrangement status - Protein Marker Resistance To Metformin ( On pre-treatment biopsy immunohistochemistry - OCT1 expression - PROTEIN MARKERS OF RECEPTORS AND ACTIVATED PATHWAYS TO mtor IN NSCLC ( Comparison pre-treatment biopsy post-resection specimen immunohistochemistry ) : - IR - IGF-1R - Phosphorylated-AMPK - EGFR phospho-EGFR - PKB ( AKT ) phospho-AKT - Phosphorylated ( erbb2 , erbb3 , erbb4 ) - Phosphorylated-STAT3 - Phospho-ribosomal protein S6 - VASCULARITY IN NSCLC ( Comparison pre-treatment biopsy post-resection specimen immunohistochemistry ) : - VEGF - Microvessel density count ( CD34 , CD105 ) - SERUM LIGANDS TO SIGNALLING PATHWAYS IN NSCLC ( Comparison pre-treatment biopsy post-resection specimen ELISA ) : - Insulin - Glucose - IGF-1 - TGF-α - TNF-α - Calculated HOMA - CRP - Adiponectin Statistics : Patients complete metformin treatment Ki67 apoptosis score compare sample obtain pre post-metformin treatment . Changes Ki67 apoptotic score metformin treatment correlate biomarkers various pathway hypothesize mediate effect metformin NSCLC development .</detailed_description>
