	<detailed_description>An acquire brain injury ( ABI ) complex injury often follow broad range cognitive , physical , emotional , behavioral disability . Because disability , patient ABI find challenging remain return work/education post-injury even though approximately 75 % patient work age . Vocational rehabilitation ( VR ) often prolonged process lead high cost health care system society . Barriers VR success include severity ABI , age injury , income education pre-injury , also challenge directly relate workplace . Often , employer little knowledge consequence ABI , addition , lack communication regard challenge need relation work-related task influence VR . Even though return work proven important long term ABI survival increase level quality life standardize research-based VR program target patent ABI lacking . It previously show support specialize VR team help patient ABI return work post-injury study examine long term effect . Previous VR intervention perform similarly patient even though ABI broad diagnostic category various degree characteristic . Thus , VR intervention tailor patient might prove efficient effective enhance return work . This study interventional , two-arm , 6-month follow-up , cluster randomize controlled trail include 84 participant ABI allocate randomly ( allocation ratio 1:1 ) VR intervention control group consist conventional VR program ( usual care ) . The main objective study develop individually target manual-based VR program determine efficacy patient ABI . It hypothesize - participant allocate VR intervention group significant high employment study rate ( measure hour ) 6-month follow-up compare participant receive conventional VR program provide municipality ( control group ) . - health-related quality life ( HRQoL ) disability among participant HRQoL caregiver burden among caregiver significantly improve end VR intervention 6-month follow-up compare conventional VR program . A budget impact possibly cost utility analysis perform since investigator hypothesize economically sound decision municipality invest specialize VR compare conventional VR program . The duration study three year assessment take place baseline end intervention ( approximately 6-9 month ) . In order determine long term effect intervention , follow-up assessment plan 6 month . The 84 patient include study recruit four municipality Zealand Region Capital Region Denmark period April 2017 July 2017 . In order avoid confound VR intervention control group due random probability , number case control within four municipality fix ( +1/-1 ) . Due prospective nature inclusion , practically mean number patient include within municipality priori know , randomization perform randomly assign first patient within municipality either VR intervention conventional VR program . The following patient ( within municipality ) assign consecutive group . This manual-based VR study comprises follow three phase : 1 . Initial assessment : Within two week referral study , patient meet rehabilitation team project Brain Injury Centre BOMI ( Roskilde , Denmark ) .The participant fully inform content study , participation voluntary , free withdraw time study . If write informed consent obtain , patient assign unique trial ID number baseline questionnaire fill together follow socio-demographic , employment , clinical data ( gender , date birth , residence , civil status , nationality , income , pre-injury employment education status , pre-injury occupation status , length education , time since brain injury , type location brain injury , number day hospitalize , date discharge , clinical diagnosis relevant medical event , alcohol consumption abuse ) . Each patient include VR intervention group ask choose least two family member participate family intervention one family caregiver participate actively individual session serve future support resource facilitator assist return work . To exclude recruitment bias , patient meet eligibility criterion refuse participate study ask question refusal . 2 . The VR intervention program : The VR intervention last total 6-9 month consist first six different module ( 3-month ) individually plan base patient need goal , second work placement program ( approximately 3-6 month ) . To ensure uniform procedure different module , comprehensive `` standard operating procedure '' ( SOP 's ) develop rehabilitation team Brain Injury Centre begin VR intervention . All member rehabilitation team thoroughly train VR intervention . The six module group ( ) individual therapy include neuropsychological session ( 10-hours ) , balance work everyday life ( 20-hours ) , job matching ( 10-hours ) , ( b ) grouped-based therapy include psycho education ( 18-hours ) , mindfulness ( 15-hours ) , physiotherapy training ( 15-hours ) , ( c ) manualized family intervention program ( 8 session 90 minute ) , individual caregiver coaching , support caregiver assist patient use different strategy tool learn intervention everyday life workplace ( 12-hours ) , ( ) work placement program include work practice ( 3-6 month ) , support employment rehabilitation team ( 30-hours ) , development post rehabilitation plan ( 4-hours ) . 3 . Post-trial evaluation : An evaluation VR intervention perform self-developed semi-structured interview patient . Here , question related recruitment procedure , module study , time module , coach rehabilitation team collect . Furthermore , case manager four municipality refer participant study ask experience . Individuals allocate control group receive conventional VR program provide four municipality period time . Thus , participant control group receive VR support local municipal authority may vary content intensity . As intervention group , individual control group select family caregiver go questionnaires caregiver VR intervention group regard health-related quality life functional level . Furthermore , case manager municipality oblige ( 1 ) hand baseline questionnaires participant family caregiver , ( 2 ) complete questionnaire participant begin , end study , 6-month follow-up . A budget impact analysis financial stream relate ABI two compare intervention perform examine affordability intervention . The health gain quantify standardized questionnaire EQ-5D-3L ( health profile , self-perceived health status ) . If relevant feasible , cost-utility analysis ( quality adjust life year ( QALYs ) ) societal perspective perform . Data financial stream cost collect patient discharge hospital end follow-up period study self-developed questionnaire participate municipality . In order calculate present value future gain intervention discount rate 4 % apply . Statistical uncertainty result calculate , addition , sensitivity analysis critical assumption ( difference-in-difference analysis ) . Data store secure password-protected electronic database host Brain Injury Centre BOMI follow Danish legislation . Data collect prior intervention ( baseline ) , four month intervention ( month 4 ) , end intervention ( month 9 ) , 6-month follow-up ( month 15 ) various questionnaire . All assessment take place local rehabilitation center do 2-3 research assistant blind intervention . Each assistant receive thoroughly train assessment continue supervise throughout study period Ethical issue : The study report Danish Data Protection Agency ( registration number 2016-41-4950 ) . The Regional Ethical Committee Copenhagen , Denmark , state study need approval ( komitélovens §1 2 ) . The study carry accord local legal regulatory requirement , data handle accord guideline give Danish Personal Data Protection Agency . All participant must give write oral inform consent participate study , include consent publish result . If participant age 18 provide verbal acceptance parent complete write consent . We expect low risk adverse effect . However , increase fatigue intervention group could occur since intense program follow . Furthermore , VR could participant perceive stressful inclusion family caregiver could result high risk intra-family conflict . The first session family intervention program include psychoeducation recognize , handle , cope situation might escalate emotionally . All adverse effect report . Sample size power : The primary endpoint `` hour work/study per week '' assume follow poisson distribution overdispersion 4 . Under assumption , relation average hour work conventional VR treatment , expect surplus hour VR intervention study power calculate study n = 42+42 = 84 participant . A study 10 hour work conventional VR treatment 14 hour work VR intervention lead study power 0.8 level alpha = 0.05 . Statistical analysis : Baseline characteristic participant report ensure homogeneity VR intervention control group . Differences baseline characteristic continuous variable test independent sample t-test /Mann-Whitney U test dependent distribution data . Categorical variable analyze Chi-square test . The difference VR intervention control group primary secondary outcome analyze use repeat measurement statistical tool multilevel analysis include possible confounders .</detailed_description>
