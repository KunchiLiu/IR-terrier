	<brief_title>Comparision PVC Ablation Techniques</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Background : Radiofrequency ( RF ) catheter ablation ( CA ) effective therapeutic strategy eliminate refractory idiopathic ventricular outflow tract ( OT ) ventricular arrhythmia ( VA ) . However , early late recurrence occur commonly . RFCA also report associated collateral damage pain . The use Cryo ablation safer alternative energy source previously describe . In several report Cryo report successfully treat VA originate OT absence ablation relate pain collateral damage adjacent structure coronary . When compare outcome complication catheter ablation VA papillary muscle leave ventricle either Cryo RF , Cryo find associate significantly high success rate low recurrence rate RFCA . Aim : To compare outcome safety Cryo vs. RF PVCs . Methods : Patients PVC VA randomize 1:1 fashion RFCA Cryo ablation . All procedure do use 3-dimensional mapping system ( EnSite™ NavX™ system , St. Jude Medical ) . Ablation perform site early activation least pacemap exhibit QRS morphology match &gt; 11/12 . Endpoint procedure elimination non inducibility clinical VA. All patient undergo continuous monitoring least 12 hour post procedure 12 lead Holter exercise test 1 month post procedure . Successful ablation define absence clinical VA &gt; 50 % reduction arrhythmia burden Holter absence anti-arrhythmic medication .</detailed_description>
