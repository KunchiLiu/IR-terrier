	<brief_title>Pemetrexed Plus Tarceva Salvage Treatment EGFR Overexpressed Metastatic Colorectal Cancer Patients Who Were Failed After Standard Chemotherapy : A Phase II Single Arm Prospective Study</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Antitumor effect pemetrexed already proven lung cancer , pleural mesothelioma , peritoneal mesothelioma use standard therapeutic agent . In addition , drug severe side effect , pemetrexed think important option patient poor performance status elderly patient . Pemetrexed study colorectal cancer , Zhang et al demonstrate pemetrexed combine gefitinib significantly synergistic effect colorectal cancer cell ( 17 ) . In two phase II study patient receive pemetrexed first-line treatment metastatic disease , objective response rate 15 - 17 % . These trial conduct prior supplementation folic acid vitamin B12 , markedly decreased frequency hematologic toxicity pemetrexed ; routine supplementation include clinical trial agent ( 18 ) . Erlotinib ( tarceva ) oral epidermal growth factor receptor ( EGFR ) tyrosine kinase inhibitor ( TKI ) . Erlotinib show effect maintanence therapy ( combine bevacizumab ) colorector cancer . Also , erolitinib effect biliary tract cancer pancreatic cancer . Our previous phase III trial tarceva pul GEMOX ( gemcitabine plus oxaliplatin ) report add tarceva GEMOX useful specific subgroup EFGR overexpressed patient . The aim present study ass treatment efficacy side effect pemetrexed plus tarceva EGFR overexpressed patient refractory colorectal cancer treatment option whose performance status relatively preserve . &lt; Pre-medication Alimta &gt; D-7 ~ Folic acid 1mg QD PO D-7 ~ Vitamin B12 1mg/9weeks IM D-1 , D1 , D2 Dexamethasone 4mg BID PO &lt; Treatment &gt; D1 Alimta 500mg/m2 + NS 100ml IV infusion 10mins Every 3weeks</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Advanced colorectal cancer fail standard chemotherapy A . History refractoriness chemotherapy include 5FU , Oxaliplatin , Irinotecan B . Oral 5FU agent included standard chemotherapy C. Targeted agent cetuximab bevacizumab include inclusion criterion Patient must willingness ability comply study protocol include visit hospital test treatment trial ECOG performance status 0~2 Measurable lesion ( RECIST 1.1 ) must exist Expected survival 3 month first dose pemetrexed ⑧ Adequate organ function define estimate 28 day first doe pemetrexed : Poor performance status ( ECOG PS ≥ 3 ) Patient take folic acid Vitamin B12 . History previous treatment pemetrexed History malignant disease , except : nonmelanoma skin cancer properly treat , cured uterine cervical cancer solid tumor without evidence recurrence within 5 year Patient swallow oral pill . ⑥ Treatment medication clinical trial within 14 day ( long duration accord specific agent ) Systemic chemotherapy radiation ( except palliative purpose ) within 3 week ( long duration accord specific agent ) Toxicity previous treatment CTCAE grade &gt; 1 , except alopecia ⑨ bowel obstruction CTCAE grade 3/4 upper GI bleed 4 week ⑩ QTc prolongation ( QTc &gt; 480msec ) resting document twice within 24 hour family history QT prolongation syndrome</criteria>
