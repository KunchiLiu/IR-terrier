	<brief_summary>The purpose study find dos talimogene laherparepvec ( T-Vec ) give safely participant pancreatic cancer either big take surgery spread part body . The study also see T-Vec cause tumor shrinkage prevent growth . To find dos safe , participant enrol study receive 4 injection T-Vec . At least two dos evaluate study , depend many side effect see dose . Participants able pick dose , determine base study experience participant enrol previously . T-Vec call study agent study . This use T-Vec pancreatic cancer still experimental approve regulatory health agency , like Food Drug Administration ( FDA ) European Medicines Agency ( EMA ) , use people pancreatic cancer . T-Vec however approve FDA use melanoma population .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Study Talimogene Laherparepvec Pancreatic Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This phase 1 dose escalation study evaluate safety talimogene laherparepvec pancreas cancer . The primary endpoint safety determine maximum tolerate dose ( MTD ) . Talimogene laherparepvec previously establish safe administer endoscopically pancreatic tumor dose 10^7 PFU/ml 3 week intervals.In current study , patient first receive endoscopic injection 10^6 PFU/ml , perform identical fashion subsequent treatment dos . In de-escalation cohort first dose decreased 10^5 PFU/ml . The first dose low early phase I trials talimogene laherparepvec show patient seronegative herpes simplex virus ( HSV ) high toxicity first dose 10^6 . Thus subsequent study , account fact patient may HSV seronegative , initial dose lower subsequent dos allow patient seroconvert , allow well tolerate high dos . The first cohort 3 patient receive additional 10^7 PFU/ml talimogene laherparepvec every 3 week total 3 additional treatment . If 2 dose limit toxicity ( DLTs ) observe , next cohort 3 patient receive initial dose 10^5 PFU/ml follow 3 dos 10^6 PFU/ml talimogene laherparepvec every 3 week . If second cohort le 2 DLTs observe , expansion 10 patient safety analysis establish MTD low dose level ( ie . DLT frequency &lt; 33 % ≤3 patient ) . Please see definition DLT section 9 . Note DLT period 60 day 7 day follow final talimogene laherparepvec injection , whichever longer , patient survive DLT period unrelated reason replace . If 1 DLT observe first cohort 10^7 PFU/ml dose cohort expand six patient . If expansion occur DLTs observe move higher dose level . If 1 additional DLT occur expand 10 patient establish MTD . If 2 DLTs observe next 3 patent de-escalate receive 10^6 PFU/ml every 3 week . If 0 1 patient experience DLT de-escalation cohort , expansion 10 total patient dose level establish MTD . If DLTs observe first cohort escalate 10^8 PFU/ml every 3 week next 3 patient cohort . If 0 1 DLT observe , expand cohort additional 3 patient , 0 1 patient experience DLT expand 10 patient establish MTD . If 2 DLTs observe next 3 patient de-escalate first ( low ) dose 10^7 PFU/ml , 0 1 patient experience DLT cohort expand 10 patient establish MTD .</detailed_description>
