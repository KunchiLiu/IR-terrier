	<brief_title>A Dose Ranging Study CHF 1531 Asthmatic Subjects</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This phase II , randomize , double-blind , placebo active control dose-ranging , 6 arm incomplete block cross-over study identify optimal dose CHF 1531 respect lung function clinical efficacy safety outcome . After 2 week run-in period rescue albuterol need background inhale corticosteroid ( ICS ) , qualify subject require complete 4 treatment period 2 week separate 2 week wash-out interval . During treatment period , subject randomly assign take one 5 double-blind study treatment twice daily ( one 4 dos CHF 1531 match placebo ) open-label active control treatment also twice daily . All subject concomitantly receive ICS treatment QVAR® inhaler ( beclomethasone dipropionate 40 80 µg /actuation ) twice daily dose match pre-enrollment ICS , albuterol inhaler use need asthma rescue medication , entire study . The subject visit study center every 2 week undergo study procedure , receive safety follow-up phone call one week last visit . In total , study last 18 week require 10 visit study center . During study , daily asthma symptom , peak expiratory flow , rescue background medication use , compliance study medication record via subject diary . Treatment-Emergent Adverse Events ( TEAEs ) assess record throughout study . A full physical exam , routine hematology , blood chemistry , spirometry , vital sign measurement , 12-lead ECG pregnancy test perform enrollment end study . Furthermore Day 1 14 treatment period , serial spirometry , 12-lead ECGs , BP , serum potassium glucose also measure study center 12 hour post-dosing .</detailed_description>
