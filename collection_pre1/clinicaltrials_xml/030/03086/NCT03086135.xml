	<criteria>Adult subject ( 18 year old ) Subject conductive mixed hearing loss ear implant . Bone conduction threshold pure tone average ( PTA4 ; mean 0.5 , 1 , 2 4 kHz ) 55 dB HL . OR Subject singlesided sensorineural deafness candidate Baha surgery . Air conduction threshold pure tone average PTA4 20 dB HL ( mean 0.5 , 1 , 2 3 kHz ) good ear OR subject indicate AC CROS but—for reason— use AC CROS ( Air ConductionContralateral Routing Signal ) . Signed informed consent Previous experience amplify sound though nonsurgical solution . ( For example limit Hearing aid , CROS device , Bone conductional hearing device headband/ softband ) Uncontrolled diabetes judge investigator . Condition could jeopardise osseointegration and/or wound heal ( e.g . osteoporosis , psoriasis , longterm systemic use corticosteroid ) condition may impact outcome investigation judge investigator . Insufficient bone quality quantity implantation BI300 Implant . Subject receive radiotherapy area implantation , plan radiotherapy study period Use ototoxic drug could harmful hearing , judge investigator Unable follow investigational procedure , e.g . complete quality life scale . Participation another clinical investigation pharmaceutical and/or device .</criteria>
