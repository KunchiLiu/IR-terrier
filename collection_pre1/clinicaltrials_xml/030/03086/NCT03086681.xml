	<brief_summary>A total 120 patient pathologically confirm Locally advance cervical carcinoma enrol . Patients randomly divide two group , 60 patient group . One group treat Concurrent Chemoradiotherapy combine Endostar group treat Concurrent Chemoradiotherapy . The short term efficacy toxic treatment evaluate . The 1-year , 3-year , 5-year overall survival progression-free survival patient analyze . The investigator data may provide alternative option treatment Locally advance cervical carcinoma high efficacy low toxicity .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>This study multicenter , randomize control clinical trial . A set unified standard use , include clinical research program , inclusion criterion , exclusion criterion , chemoradiotherapy regimen evaluation criterion . Nine medical center participate study 120 patient pathologically confirm Locally advance cervical carcinoma enrol . These patient randomly divide two group : concurrent chemoradiotherapy combine Endostar group ( IMRT 45-50Gy , DDP 40mg/m2 , per week 5cycles , Endostar : 7.5mg/m2 d1-10 , repeat every 15 day , 4 cycle ) concurrent chemoradiotherapy group ( IMRT 45-50Gy , DDP 40mg/m2 , per week , 5cycles ) . After treatment , follow-up perform every 3 month . The treatment toxicity , local control rate , distant metastasis-free survival , overall survival , progression-free survival observe assessed .</detailed_description>
