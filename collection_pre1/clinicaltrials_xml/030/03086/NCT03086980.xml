	<brief_title>Automatic Self Transcending Meditation ( ASTM ) Versus Usual Care Patients With Glaucoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Glaucoma lead cause irreversible blindness , afflict estimate 60.5 million people worldwide . Further , grow body literature link depression anxiety poor health relate quality life ( HRQoL ) patient suffer glaucoma . For example , glaucoma significantly associate symptom depression , alter mood , anxiety . Skalicky Goldberg notice high prevalence depressive symptom increase glaucoma severity . Mabuchi et al . find approximately 11 % prevalence depression 13 % prevalence anxiety among primary open-angle glaucoma patient . Meditation , specifically , Automatic Self Transcending Meditation ( ASTM ) may help reduce depression , anxiety , stress , may improve quality life . ASTM class meditation help quiet mind induces physiological mental relaxation whilst eye shut . It utilize specific sound value ( mantra ) draw attention inward permit mind experience restful alert state consciousness . Research suggest ASTM easy learn teach . We offer patient specific standardized form ASTM call Sahaj Samadhi Meditation . In study shall measure HRQoL patient glaucoma ASTM intervention arm . HRQoL essential measure quality life related health ; help physician identify hidden morbidity clinical care well improve patient-physician communication . However , majority current ophthalmic literature describe change clinical variable intervention whilst lack information HRQoL . We think high necessity ass association HRQoL routinely measure clinical data . A primary purpose study assess ASTM confers beneficial effect HRQoL glaucoma patient compare intervention arm . Additionally , assess change , , ASTM confer self-reported depression anxiety symptom secondary outcome measure . PRIMARY HYPOTHESIS : We hypothesize patient glaucoma ASTM + TAU lead significant improvement HRQoL compare TAU alone baseline 24 week initial ASTM training . SECONDARY HYPOTHESES : We hypothesize patient glaucoma 1 ) HRQoL associate regularly measure clinical variable 2 ) ASTM+TAU lead significant improvement depression anxiety symptom 24 week compare TAU alone 3 ) The beneficial effect ASTM study variable sustain 24 week post intervention . STUDY DESIGN : We plan conduct single-center , single blind longitudinal randomize controlled trial . Research participants 142 men woman ( 71 group ) . STUDY RECRUITMENT : Potential participant mild severe glaucoma well glaucoma suspect age 18 year screen office practice Dr. Hutnik per inclusion exclusion criterion Dr. Hutnik Ivey Eye Institute , London , ON . Letter information ( LOI ) give potential participant . An ophthalmic examination - offer routine care - potential participant ( i.e. , measure best-corrected Snellen visual acuity ( VA ) pinhole acuity ) conduct . Data clinical variable visual field optical coherence tomography ( OCT ) measurement , include central macular thickening , obtain . Questionnaire : Patients undergo standardize interview perform trained interviewer measure HRQoL use time trade-off method ( TTO ) . During first office visit , also screen visit , interview , patient ask demographic question include age , gender , associate medical condition , concurrent ocular condition , ocular disease glaucoma , previous ocular surgery , inflammation , intraoperative complication , preoperative ocular pathology , chronic pain , general disease could affect immune system , actual infection . In addition , patient ask co-morbidities , whether high blood pressure , diabetes , arthritis , heart condition , stroke , non-ocular medical condition . Further , follow self-rated scale administer first office visit : Visual Function Questionnaire ( VFQ-25 ) , Patient Health Questionnaire ( PHQ-9 ) , Generalized Anxiety Disorder ( GAD-7 ) , Community Integration Questionnaire ( CIQ ) . RANDOMIZATION : Participants randomize either ASTM + TAU TAU alone equally ( 1:1 ) use computer generate randomization number available random.org . A telephone number available study concerns/queries . Pre-randomized information store use unique de-identifiers download secure database . It possible blind participant intervention status . Outcome assessor investigator blind treatment . It possible blind participant staff provide treatment intervention status . TREATMENT ARMS : 1 . ASTM : Following initial measurement ( common ASTM control group ) , participant ASTM group undergo ASTM training group 10 certified teacher supervision one study collaborator room St. Joseph 's Hospital Ivey Eye Institute , 268 Grosvenor Street , London , ON . This involve participate four , 90-120 minute session four consecutive day . This follow weekly 60-75 minute follow session 12 week bi-weekly follow-up session 13 24 week . Participants require attend 75 % weekly , 80 % bi-weekly session . In addition , participant ask practice ASTM home 20 minute twice daily study period ( 24 week ) . Participants ask log practice frequency noteworthy observation log sheet provide . Further , follow self-rated scale administer trained rater fourth ASTM session ( week 0 ) well week 12 , 24 : TTO , VFQ-25 , PHQ-9 , GAD-7 . 2 . Control Intervention : Participants randomize control arm ( Treatment Usual , TAU ) continue receive treatment usual include glaucoma medication . They follow assessment study procedure list . Following duration week 24 study participant TAU arm also offer opportunity learn ASTM . No study procedure apply information collect period . STUDY RECRUITMENT : We anticipate recruit participant rate least 2 participants/week period 36 week allow attainment sample size n=71 . There obligation participant take part study ; participation voluntary . PRIMARY ( HRQoL ) measure first office visit : Patients arm undergo standardize interview perform trained interviewer measure HRQoL first office visit study visit ( week 0 , 4 , 6 , 8 , 12 , 24 week ) . SECONDARY OUTCOME MEASURES ( first office visit study visit : week 0 , 4 , 6 , 8 , 12 , 24 ) : VFQ-25 , PHQ-9 , GAD-7 assess trained interviewer first office visit plus study visit day ( week 0 , 4 , 6 , 8 , 12 , 24 ) . Note PHQ-9 GAD-7 self-rated scale participant ask complete presence rater . ADDITIONAL PROTOCOL CONDITIONS : Individual patient withdraw study intervention appear continue would deleterious mental health safety . This determined patient , treat clinician and/or research team support use PHQ-9 particularly increase score . Variable Specification : A dependent variable create base HRQoL , interval scale variable take value 0.0 1.0 . Independent variable : Visual acuity better-seeing eye , visual field , optical coherence tomography ( OCT ) measurement , patient ' demographic characteristic , include age , gender , associate medical condition independent variable . Visual field , optical coherence tomography ( OCT ) measurement , patient ' demographic characteristic , include age , consider continuous variable . Gender categorize male female associate medical condition categorize `` current medical condition , '' include concurrent ocular condition , inflammation ; `` disease , '' include ocular disease glaucoma , chronic pain , general disease could affect immune system , actual infection ; `` medical history , '' include previous ocular surgery , preoperative ocular pathology , intraoperative complication . Data Grouping : Based BCVA , study participant group visual acuity well see eye ( group 1 , 20/20 20/40 ; group 2 , 20/50 20/100 ; group 3 , 20/200 light perception ) . Better see use since correlation show utility score well see eye . These 3 group choose since group 1 represent legal drive vision , group 2 represent moderate visual acuity loss , group 3 represent legal blindness . Data Analysis : As do many study , HRQoL calculate divide number year patient willing trade return improve quality life estimate number year remain life subtract 1.0 . Mean , standard deviation , 95 % confidence interval continuous variable visual field , OCT measurement , age , utility value , calculate . For categorical variable , visual acuity better-seeing eye , gender , associate medical condition , proportion calculate . The chi-square test statistic independence use compare unwillingness trade time TTO . The unpaired , two-tailed Student t-test use evaluate effect visual acuity well eye four group gender mean time trade-off utility value . Non-response issue : Non-respondent patient ' characteristic compare respondent patient , ' appear statistically significantly different , result generalize sample population . Data analyze use STATA Software ( Version 12.0 ) . The unit analysis HRQoL . Univariate bivariate analysis perform independent variable dependent variable elicit impact factor pattern HRQoL without adjust effect variable . Models deem statistically significant associate significant F value ( p &lt; 0.01 ) explain 15 % variability dependent variable . Only independent variable statistically significantly associate HRQoL ( p &lt; 0.05 ) use model construction . Since dependent variable continuous , plan use non-linear regression model assess effect independent variable dependent variable , control confounders . Multicollinearity , high correlation independent variable , interaction effect evaluate model . Validation Analysis : Validation perform developed NLR model . The collect data divide two portion : one portion , call `` main data , '' contain 80 % sample total collected utility value associate data ; portion , call `` test data , '' contain remain 20 % . Validation do use test data coefficient value main data calculate percentage correct case .</detailed_description>
