	<brief_title>Comparative Study Nonintubated Uniport Thoracoscopic Surgery Using Thoracic Paravertebral Nerve Block Versus Intercostal Nerve Block Peripheral Solitary Pulmonary Nodule Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Thoracoscopic minor lung resection reasonable option diagnosis treatment management undetermined peripheral pulmonary nodule . Uniport procedure could reduce postoperative pain score , length hospital stay , moreover , nonintubated technique avoid disadvantage conventional general anesthesia ventilator induce lung injury , sore throat voice change . The nonintubated technique without tracheal intubation spontaneous ventilation combine uniport single port thoracoscopic surgery emerge least invasive procedure wedge resection peripheral pulmonary nodule , even anatomical thoracoscopic lobectomy along mediastinal lymph nodule dissection case diagnosis primary lung cancer operation . The initial experience nonintubated thoracoscopic surgery include intravenous control sedation pain , thoracic epidural analgesia thoracic vagus nerve block , due series adverse event epidural analgesia , operator willing perform intrathoracic intercostal nerve block guide camera operation consider simple safety method regional analgesia .However , intercostal nerve block employ adequate pain control , surgery , patient control analgesia usual need . The previous study show paravertebral block effect relieve pain thoracic epidural analgesia less complication hypotension , nausea vomit . With advance technique application ultrasound , interest use ultrasound technique surgery perform adequate pain control local regional analgesia nonintubated surgery spontaneous ventilation . However , ultrasound technique difficult skilled experience anaesthetist increase related puncture complication hematoma , bleed pneumothorax . The method use study guide camera simple safety avoidance puncture partial pleura intercostal blood vessel , The investigator use approach postoperative pain control general intubation lung cancer patient , investigator skilled experience achieve regional analgesia nonintubated uniport thoracoscopic wedge resection . So far , article thoracic paravertebral nerve block regional analgesia nonintubated thoracoscopic procedure patient . The investigator design study compare short term outcome thoracic paravertebral nerve block nonintubated technique intercostal nerve block uniport nonintubated video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery ( VATS ) control group . This study perform third people 's hospital Shenzhen . A total 48 patient enrol ( 24 patient arm ) .</detailed_description>
