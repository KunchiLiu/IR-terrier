	<brief_title>VItamin D Novel Determinant Injurious Cardiac Remodelling After acuTE Myocardial Infarction</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Participants Patients recently ( &lt; 72 hour ) suffer acute myocardial infarction invite participate . The immediate post-infarction period one particular anxiety patient carers project design following advice Patient-Public-Involvement adviser also discussion project Cardiovascular Clinical Research Facility PPI group meeting . Patient attendance keep minimum dovetail clinical investigation wherever possible . In view exploratory nature project , primary endpoint : leave ventricular remodelling , exclusion inclusion criterion limit , prefer instead capture real-world pragmatic view change cardiac function follow myocardial infarction . This also important view context long-term plan investigate effect vitamin D ameliorate adverse change follow heart attack . Data collection , administration image protocol Demographic clinical variable record bespoke database , also store biochemical information include vitamin D , PTH vitamin D bind protein level measure routine blood sample . EDTA blood also store analysis vitamin D binding protein haplotypes . It think vitamin D exhibit acute phase response level stable follow myocardial infarction . Each participant undergo full bedside echocardiography within 72 hour acute ST elevation myocardial infarction , result available clinical use . European American guideline recommend echocardiography prior discharge patient admit STEMI , scan extra procedure . The consent process describe scan clinically indicate also use research purpose . As propose study provide support clinical service . VINDICATE ( vitamin D replenishment patient chronic heart failure ) examine remodelling vitamin D 12 month . Remodelling expect accelerated patient experience acute STEMI ( recent study acute iron supplementation compare scan baseline three month ) indeed previous work describe outcome predictor remodelling 284 STEMI patient use repeat echocardiography 6 month . Full conventional echocardiography carry grey-scale tissue Doppler image record two four chamber view use harmonic improve border definition necessary . All image store 'echopac ' digital imaging system analyse offline . This analysis include calculation LV end diastolic end systolic volume use real-time three dimensional data two-dimensional biplane disc ( modify Simpson 's ) method trace endocardial border exclude papillary muscle . An average three measurement use final analysis . The frame R-wave take end diastole , frame small LV cavity , end systole . The LV end-systolic volume index ( LVESVi ) calculate LVESV/body surface area . Statistical consideration Study design analysis plan develop help Dr David Cairns , Principal Statistician Leeds Clinical Trials Research Unit . Statistical analysis plan Clinical technical variable know relevance outcomes patient follow myocardial infarction include pre-existing left ventricular function , anaemia , age , female sex , diabetes mellitus , previous chronic kidney disease collect . Change leave ventricular volume reliable surrogate change outcome . Two possible marker progressive remodelling analyse . The first use cut-off 5 % reduction LVEF 15 % increase leave ventricular end systolic volume index ( LVESVi ) , two variable frequently use literature measure adverse remodeling . How change LVESVi LVEF continuous variable relate baseline clinical data also explore . In analysis follow guideline describe STARD TRIPOD statement produce transparent reproducible evidence relate clinical variable marker progressive remodel . Hence , initial approach perform univariate test association ( two sample t-tests , one way analysis variance chi-squared test ) look relationship predictor variable rhythm , past medical history ( ischaemic heart disease diabetes mellitus ) , pre-existing leave ventricular function , location myocardial infarction , anaemia , age , female sex , previous chronic kidney disease marker progressive remodelling . Around one quarter ( 25 % ) return patient expect fulfil binary cut offs &gt; 5 % reduction LVEF &gt; 15 % change LVESVi . This developed construct robust multivariable predictive model base step-wise logistic regression model procedure use bootstrap resampling develop internally validate model . This approach require sufficient patient ' data reliably allow regression model include potentially relevant clinical variable . Sample size prediction It assume independent predictor investigation , need 10 'events ' ( &gt; 5 % reduction LVEF ) . With nine predictor variable , allow drop out , withdrawal consent poor imaging , recognise predictor variable likely independent one another , conservatively estimate study need 90-100 subject 'events ' ( case remodelling ) robustly estimate model . Since conservatively estimate suggest around 25 % patient experience remodelling , 400 patient scan baseline 6 month . However , around half patient present Leeds STEMI come district may want return LTHT echocardiogram . It therefore conservatively estimate around 800 patient need scan achieve 400 attendance follow-up . Leeds perform primary angioplasty ( STEMI ) around 1200 patient per year allow weekend refusal , sufficient patient complete enrolment within two year . Follow-up outcome record Outcomes data one year , two year five year follow index event collect use routinely collect hospital admission mortality data .</detailed_description>
