	<detailed_description>Stroke lead cause permanent disability United States . In absence treatment restore lose tissue , clinical scientist focus upon repetitive force use paretic limb promote neural reorganization preserve tissue reduce disability . However , force use intervention time intensive extent functional recovery variable . One potential contributor variability potential trade-off compensatory cognitive motor control strategies extent procedural learning occur . Compensatory strategy adopt patient may produce quick short-term increase performance retard slower sustain improvement interfere development procedural learning . Consistent hypothesis , investigator ' previous work document increase reliance upon dorsolateral prefrontal cortex performance learn skill post-stoke . However , investigator ' previous work also demonstrate effect increase activity dorsolateral prefrontal cortex may limit reorganization important area involve consolidation practice thereby limit functional recovery post-stroke . Transcranial magnetic stimulation offer unique opportunity investigate relationship dorsolateral prefrontal cortex activity consolidation motor practice/rehabilitaion post-stroke . Here investigator ' objective determine whether suppression contralesional dorsolateral prefrontal cortex , continuous theta burst transcranial magnetic brain stimulation ( cTBS ) , form transcranial magnetic stimulation , prior motor practice enhances brain reorganization critical area lead great sustained improvement motor ability time . The propose work enhance understand motor learn post-stroke provide preliminary evidence benefit dorsolateral prefrontal cTBS adjunct current rehabilitation intervention .</detailed_description>
