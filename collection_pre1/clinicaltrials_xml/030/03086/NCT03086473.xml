	<brief_summary>This clinical trial investigate whether administration caffeine , respiratory stimulant , preterm baby soon birth prevent need breathe tube , intubation . Many preterm baby require intubation intubate soon birth , often within first hour . If caffeine give early enough sufficient stimulate effective breathing , perhaps baby may require intubation . Additionally , caffeine may improve blood flow preterm baby give soon birth . Approximately half baby study receive caffeine within two hour birth , half receive caffeine 12 hour birth . The hypothesis preterm baby receive caffeine within 2 hour birth low incidence intubation preterm baby receive caffeine 12 hour birth . The main secondary hypothesis caffeine give soon birth enhance blood flow preterm baby .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Caffeine routinely administer extremely preterm neonate respiratory stimulant prevent treat apnea prematurity , prolonged pause breathe preterm baby . Caffeine , methylxanthine , adenosine receptor antagonist effect relax smooth muscle airway , stimulate central nervous system cardiac muscle , act diuretic . The mode action apnea prematurity could several mechanism , include stimulation respiratory drive , enhancement minute ventilation , increase response hypercapnia , increase skeletal muscle tone , decrease diaphragmatic fatigue . The timing caffeine administration highly variable , range first hour life several day birth . In Caffeine Apnea Prematurity ( CAP ) trial , average day initial caffeine dose 3 day life , incidence bronchopulmonary dysplasia ( BPD ) significantly reduce caffeine group compare placebo group ( 47 % vs 36 % , p &lt; 0.001 ) . Neonates caffeine group also few day mechanical ventilation oxygen exposure , know risk factor development BPD . Further study demonstrate great benefit caffeine give first 2-3 day life versus later . These study suggest caffeine administer earlier life may beneficial term respiratory outcome . However , effect caffeine administer shortly birth unknown need study randomize , placebo-controlled trial . The investigator postulate give caffeine soon possible birth , intrinsic respiratory function support sufficiently avoid intubation altogether , thus eliminate major risk factor BPD . Intravenous caffeine reach therapeutic level almost immediately , typically within thirty minute administration . However , majority infant require invasive ventilation intubate within first hour life , usually infant received caffeine . Additionally , many center utilize minimally invasive administration surfactant , medication help keep lung open lower surface tension , treat respiratory distress syndrome newborn attempt avoid intubation , preterm neonate require immediate intubation instead receive non-invasive continuous positive airway pressure ( CPAP ) birth decrease risk BPD . These technique require spontaneous , effective breathing , early caffeine administration may aid process . This study aim deliver caffeine preterm infant immediately birth determine whether intubation avoid . While primary outcome study aim reduce intubation rate thus affect rate BPD , beneficial cardiovascular effect may also note . The incidence hypotension preterm infant &lt; 28 week high 78 % .This study also use non-invasive technology continuously monitor hemodynamic parameter include cardiac function , output , blood flow , oxygenation brain surround administration caffeine . Very early caffeine therapy may improve cardiovascular function early transitional period , potentially decrease risk devastate complication prematurity intraventricular hemorrhage . This double-blinded , randomize , placebo-controlled clinical trial investigate whether administration caffeine preterm neonate ( &lt; 32 week ' gestation ) within first 2 hour life compare 12 hour life decrease rate intubation first 12 hour life . This study also investigate whether caffeine administration preterm neonate ( &lt; 32 week ' gestation ) increase cardiac output . A total 88 infant include study , randomize two study arm . One arm receive intravenous caffeine citrate within 2 hour life placebo ( normal saline ) 12 hour life , arm receive placebo within 2 hour life caffeine citrate 12 hour life . Therefore , participant receive caffeine 12 hour life , variable timing caffeine .</detailed_description>
