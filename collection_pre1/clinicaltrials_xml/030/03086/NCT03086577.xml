	<brief_summary>Leg ulcer significant cause impair functional ability quality life approximately 1-2 percent population western country . Although pain seem one devastating aspects live chronic ulcer , research limit lack knowledge wound-related pain characteristic . Little known prevalence , pain intensity , quality , location , temporal fluctuation , witch degree pain impact physical- psychosocial functioning , well relieve exacerbate factor . The overall purpose study investigate prevalence characteristic wound related pain patient chronic leg ulcer . More specific research question : 1 ) What prevalence characteristic wound related pain patient suffer various type persistent ulcer , 2 ) How patient different ulcer diagnosis report quality wound relate pain , 3 ) Is difference wound pain characteristic among patient different etiology leg ulcer , 4 ) How pain temporal pattern patient chronic leg- foot ulcer , 5 ) What report quality life patient different ulcer diagnosis , 6 ) Is association among pain characteristic , sleep quality life patient chronic leg/foot ulcer ? The study non-experimental , explorative descriptive approach . A cross-sectional questionnaire design use explore patient 's experience wound-related pain . The patient recruit outpatient clinic appointment home-care nursing Norway . Participants fill self-report questionnaire . The battery questionnaires obtain information demographic data , pain characteristic , quality life sleep . Pain characteristic , quality life sleep assess use different questionnaire demonstrate high validity reliability . In addition , temporal pattern pain assess ask participant fill form state subjective level pain ( NRS ) every hour typical day , mark time rest sleep . Relevant information diagnosis/classification ulcer , comorbidities , ulcer management pain management collect clinical examination .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Design : The study non-experimental , explorative descriptive approach . A cross-sectional questionnaire design , provide quantitative data , use explore patient 's experience wound-related pain . Recruitment : Patients recruit outpatient clinic home-care nursing Norway . Written inform consent obtain eligible patient agree participate . The patient recruit outpatient clinic appointment . Those willing participate complete questionnaire independently return questionnaire mail pre-paid envelope . Furthermore , relevant information diagnosis/classification ulcer , comorbidities , ulcer management pain management collect clinical examination , talk participant . The clinical examination take place relation already schedule dressing-change , order minimize burden participate study . Based clinical experience , expert opinion , research group reason believe ulcer classify three main category ; ulcer venous insufficiency main perpetuating factor , ulcer arterial insufficiency main perpetuating factor , ulcer diabetes main perpetuate factor . This study look effect-size intervention , test hypothesis . Therefore , sample size calculate base need carry plan regression analysis look predictor quality life patient different etiology leg ulcer . In study , quality life dependent variable , whereas pain , sleep , age , gender , wound area possibly social status independent variable . The sample size estimation base recommendation statistician literature . The `` rule thumb '' recommend indicate study size N &gt; 104 + number independent variable ( 6 ) . This give N &gt; 110 group . The research group choose set sample size 120 respondent group take account dropout . Three group 120 respondent result total sample size 360 respondent . The questionnaire Participants fill self-report questionnaire . The battery questionnaires obtain information demographic clinical data , pain characteristic , quality life sleep . Demographic data : Information age , gender , work situation , education , live arrangement collect . This information use describe patient sample present study . Clinical data : A research nurse collect information patient ' anamnesis ulcer . Relevant information collect diagnosis/classification ulcer , ulcer management , pain management . The measure include study standardize measure clinic . Diagnosis classification ulcer The following data collect order research-group classify different ulcer : - The patient ulcer diagnosis ( state medical doctor ) , presume causal factor ( trauma pressure ) , comorbidities , localization ulcer ( body map ) , measure wind size multiply wound width ( millimeter widest ) height ( millimeter high ) . - Clinical sign wound-infection ( critical colonization ) : Unusual/bad smell , visible pu , increased moisture , increase change ulcer related pain , redness , swell , heat , reduce general condition , fever . - Circulation leg assess palpation ankle pulse . If palpable pulse find , pulse assess Doppler . If unable detect pulse Doppler , Ankle-brachial pressure index calculate . - Reduced sensibility assess monofilament tuning-fork test tactile vibration sense . - The presence visible varix register . - A photograph ulcer lower leg foot take used classify ulcer . - Bothersome itch assess ask respondent . Ulcer management : The research nurse collect data ulcer management , frequency wound dress change , wet dry dressing/treatment use , whether patient undergone ulcer debridement revision surgery last week . Furthermore , patient recruit outpatient clinic , patient ask whether first consultation clinic . Pain management : Both medical non-medical treatment pain register . It differentiate whether pain management aim ulcer pain type pain patient may suffer . Characteristics wound-related pain Pain intensity : The 0 - 10 Numeric Rating Scale ( NRS ) pain one-dimensional measure pain intensity . Pain quality : The Short Form McGill Pain Questionnaire ( SF-MPQ ) use assess different quality subjective pain experience . The aim questionnaire capture pain multidimensional phenomenon , recognize shortcoming simple pain intensity scale . The Brief Pain Inventory ( BPI ) : BPI provide information location , intensity , treatment impact pain . Temporal pattern pain : There questionnaire available adapted assessment pain pattern use self-report one set time . The research group design test one-dimensional tool ass pattern wound pain . The first part tool base last item Pain Quality Assessment Scale respondent select one tree statement reflect intermittent pain , variable pain stabile pain . The second part tool include graph respondent indicate subjective level pain ( 0 - 10 NRS ) every hour typical day . Pertaining level pain , participant also mark specific time day spend activity , resting , sleep . Localization wound-related pain : The respondent ask location wound-related pain , choose among multiple alternative option , directly wound wound-bed , wound-edges , skin surround wound , entire foot , entire leg . The respondent also write word wound pain locate . Quality life Will assess use The EuroQol-5D ( EQ-5D ) standardize instrument develop EuroQol Research Foundation use measure health outcome applicable wide range health condition . Sleep The Insomnia Severity Index ( ISI ) brief self-report instrument measure patient 's perception sleep . The ISI target subjective symptom consequence insomnia well degree concern distress cause difficulty . Analyses The data analyze appropriate parametric nonparametric test use Statistical Package Social Sciences Windows . The data analyze use mean , standard deviation , correlation coefficient , analysis variance ( ANOVA ) regression analysis . The photographs clinical ulcer data evaluate research-group order categorize ulcer , base predefined criterion three etiology group . Ethical consideration This study approve Regional Committees Medical Health Research Ethics Norway ( region south-east ) . This assure study follow necessary ethical consideration regard cross-sectional quantitative research design . Furthermore , study report Data Inspectorate . Application permission recruit participant also send Head department different clinic community nursing service patient recruit . Participation study voluntary , obligation participate `` penalty '' consequence participate . Patients receive write oral information study participation . An introductory letter describes purpose nature study confidentiality data , well write consent , form hand potential participant . Patients willing participate need sign consent form receive questionnaire . Confidentiality maintain cod participant removal identifier early stage data analysis . Completed questionnaire codebooks store separately accord rule regulation set Ethics Committee involve hospital community nursing service . The complete questionnaire store locked fire-safe safe . Digital copy data save research-servers University College Southeast-Norway ( HSN ) . The photograph take patient ' ulcer contain information identify patient . The study nurse take photo visualizes wind low leg/foot . The photo allocate patient study-identification number , save electronically research server HSN . No hard-copies photo store .</detailed_description>
