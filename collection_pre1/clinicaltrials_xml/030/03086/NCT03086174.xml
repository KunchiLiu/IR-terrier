	<brief_title>Tolerability Pharmacokinetics JS001 Combination With Axitinib Patients With Kidney Cancer Melanoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This phase Ib , open , mono-center , dose-escalation , tolerability pharmacokinetic study evaluate Recombinant Humanized Anti-PD-1 mAb Injection combination Axitinib patient advance kidney cancer melanoma fail routine systemic treatment.The study conduct 2 part : dose escalation cohort expansion . 18 24 patient enrol dose escalation part.This part analyze safety efficacy humanize anti-PD-1 antibody combination axitinib confirm dose-limiting toxicity ( DLT ) , maximum tolerate dose ( MTD ) recommend dose ( RD ) . After finish dose escalation part , enroll patient tumor type recommend dose group ensure group 10 patient . This part analyze safety efficacy humanize anti-PD-1 antibody .</detailed_description>
