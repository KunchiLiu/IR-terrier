	<criteria>Patients newly diagnose DIPG complete focal radiotherapy eligible . Patients disseminated disease eligible , MRI spine must perform disseminated disease suspect treat physician . Treatment must begin minimum 28 day later 42 day date completion radiotherapy . Prior Chemotherapy : No prior experimental chemotherapy allow . If subject receive chemotherapy radiation , subject need discuss study chair ( ) . The use temolzolomide allow standard pediatric dose radiation therapy . All therapy need discuss study chair . Prior Radiation : Patients must receive prior treatment focal radiotherapy part initial treatment DIPG last dose least 28 day prior later 42 day first CED treatment liposomalirinotecan . Age ≥ 3 &lt; 39 year age . Karnofsky ≥ 50 patient &gt; 16 year age Lansky ≥ 50 patient 16 year age young . Patients unable walk paralysis , wheelchair , consider ambulatory purpose assess performance score . Life expectancy great 12 week measure date completion radiotherapy . Corticosteroids : Patients receive dexamethasone must stable decrease dose least 1 week prior registration . Organ Function Requirements Adequate Bone Marrow Function Defined : Peripheral absolute neutrophil count ( ANC ) ≥1000/mm3 platelet count ≥ 100,000/mm3 ( transfusion independent , define receive platelet transfusion least 7 day prior enrollment ) normal coagulation define normal INR per institutional guideline . Adequate Renal Function Defined : Creatinine clearance radioisotope GFR ≥ 70mL/min/1.73 m2 A serum creatinine base age/gender follow : Age Maximum Serum Creatinine ( mg/dL ) Male Female 3 &lt; 6 year 0.8 0.8 6 &lt; 10 year 1 1 10 &lt; 13 year 1.2 1.2 13 &lt; 16 year 1.5 1.4 ≥ 16 year 1.7 1.4 Adequate Liver Function Defined : Bilirubin ( sum conjugate + unconjugated ) less equal 1.5 x upper limit normal ( ULN ) age SGPT ( ALT ) less equal 110 U/L . Serum albumin ≥ 2 g/dL . Adequate Neurologic Function Defined : Patients seizure disorder may enrol nonenzyme induce anticonvulsant well control . The effect irinotecan liposome injection develop human fetus unknown . For reason woman childbearing potential men must agree use adequate contraception ( hormonal barrier method birth control ; abstinence ) prior study entry , duration study participation 4 month completion irinotecan liposome injection administration . Should woman become pregnant suspect pregnant partner participate study , inform treat physician immediately . Ability understand willingness sign write informed consent document . Patients prior experimental chemotherapy . Patients receive investigational agent . History allergic reaction attribute compound similar chemical biologic composition irinotecan , topotecan , gadolinium , lipid . Uncontrolled intercurrent illness include , limited , ongoing active infection , symptomatic congestive heart failure , unstable angina pectoris , cardiac arrhythmia , psychiatric illness/social situation would limit compliance study requirement . Female patient childbearing potential must pregnant breastfeeding . Female patient childbearing potential must negative serum urine pregnancy test within 7 day registration . Patients inability return followup visit obtain followup study require assess toxicity therapy . Patients MRI clinical evidence uncontrolled tumor mass effect exclude ; assessment mass effect make study chair study neurosurgeon prior plan CED treatment . Leptomeningeal subarachnoid disseminate disease . Patients evidence hemorrhage ( besides expect patient underwent biopsy ) . These subject discuss study chair . Patients evidence cystic change great 1 cm diameter exclude . These subject discuss study chair . Patients must enzymeinducing anticonvulsant drug might interact cytochrome P450 enzyme system . If previously EIAED , patient must least 10 day prior CED infusion .</criteria>
