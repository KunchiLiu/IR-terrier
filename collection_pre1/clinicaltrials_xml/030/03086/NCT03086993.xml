	<brief_summary>This study evaluate two group patient intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma . Each group receive induction treatment Cisplatin Gemcitabine per SOC 4 treatment cycle . Following induction treatment patient randomize ( 1:1 ) , 2 arm treatment . One group ( 50 % ) receive high dose chemotherapy deliver specifically liver , group ( 50 % ) continue treatment Cisplatin Gemcitabine . Patient group get repeat cycle treatment cancer advance . All patient follow death . This study compare overall survival ( OS ) patient intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The study consist 4 phase : screening , induction , randomization follow-up phase . Screening phase : Screening assessment conduct within 28 day prior initiation Induction Phase treatment determine patient 's overall eligibility . These assessment include medical history ; physical examination ; Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group ( ECOG ) performance status ( PS ) ; 12 lead electrocardiogram ( ECG ) ; echocardiogram ( ECHO ) ; vital sign ; laboratory assessment ; radiologic assessment disease status ; evaluation vasculature compatibility Percutaneous Hepatic Perfusion ( PHP ) . Induction phase : The initial 12 week study , patient receive 4 cycle cisplatin/gemcitabine . Each cycle comprise cisplatin dose 25 mg per square meter body-surface area ( BSA ) , follow gemcitabine dose 1000 mg per square meter BSA ; dose occur Days 1 8 cycle . At completion 3 cycle ( week 8 ( +1 week ) ) cisplatin/gemcitabine , image scan perform per standard care determine patient progress treatment continue receive cisplatin/gemcitabine induction therapy one cycle ( 4th cycle - prior randomization ) . At completion 4 cycle ( week 12 ( +1 week ) ) cisplatin/gemcitabine , patient undergo whole-body imaging determine status disease . Patients progressive disease ( PD ) discontinue study treatment , receive treatment determine principal investigator ( PI ) . They continue follow death end study . Patients least stable disease ( SD ) image induction phase 4 cycle cisplatin/gemcitabine ( week 12 ( + 1 week ) ) go next phase study ( Randomized Treatment Phase ) . Randomization phase : Patients least stable disease via image end Induction Phase randomize 1:1 ratio Melphalan/HDS treatment continue cisplatin/gemcitabine cycle previously describe Induction Phase , progressive disease ( PD ) unacceptable toxicity observe . Patients randomize treatment Melphalan/HDS ( dose 3.0 mg/kg Ideal Body Weight [ IBW ] ) must undergo first treatment within 14 day follow whole body image performed end Induction Phase . For Melphalan/HDS treatment , patient receive 6 treatment . Each treatment cycle consist 6 week acceptable delay another 2 week next planned treatment allow additional recovery , need . After Melphalan/HDS treatment , absence disease progression , patient undergo re-induction CisGem . Tumor response assess treatment arm every 8 week ( + 1 week ) PD . The assessment scan review Independent Review Committee ( IRC ) . At time PD observe , patient remove study treatment ; treatment discretion investigator . Melphalan/HDS treatment also discontinue event recovery require 8 week last treatment . An end-of-treatment visit conduct approximately 6 8 week follow final dose study treatment . Ongoing adverse event ( AEs ) end-of-treatment visit follow severity return common terminology criterion adverse event ( CTCAE ) Grade &lt; 1 . Follow-up phase : In event disease progress end-of-treatment visit , disease assessment scan continue every 8 week ( + 1 week ) PD document . Patients contact phone every 6 month survival status first two year follow completion study treatment , yearly thereafter death , withdrawal inform consent become lose follow-up , whichever occur first . Patients monitor two year follow completion study treatment development myelodysplasia secondary leukemia .</detailed_description>
