	<brief_title>Proof-of-Concept Superiority Trial Fosravuconazole Versus Itraconazole Eumycetoma Sudan</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Eumycetoma fungal disease cause Madurella mycetomatis . The disease chronic , granulomatous inflammatory . It usually involve subcutaneous tissue lead mass sinuses fungal grain discharge . It probably introduce post trauma e.g . thorn prick . It associate major morbidity disabling , disfigure highly stigmatize . In advanced case may fatal . Eumycetoma prevalent know mycetoma belt . Current treatment modality eumycetoma disappoint . The response characterize low cure rate , high amputation rate , high drop follow high recurrence rate . The available drug treatment eumycetoma expensive , potentially toxic require long treatment period 12 month . By time mass well encapsulate remove surgically . Despite prolonged medical treatment , causative organism commonly find still viable cultured surgical specimen . The objective study determine comparative efficacy , safety , tolerability Fosravuconazole versus itraconazole first-line treatment subject eumycetoma cause Madurella mycetomatis . The primary end-point complete cure 12 month treatment evidence clinical assessment show absence mycetoma mass closure sinuses absent discharge , normal ultrasonic examination lesion , presence fibrosis associate negative fungal culture surgical biopsy former mycetoma site . The secondary endpoint outcome 3-month 's time point base criterion 12 month and/or treatment-related adverse event 3- 12-month visit . The study also monitor plasma drug level ravuconazole itraconazole include logistic model clinical laboratory parameter predict outcome . In addition , immunological study do describe develop change immune response treatment . Lastly , strain collect culture typed assessment antifungal resistance . This study single-center , comparative , randomize , double-blind , parallel-group , active-controlled , clinical superiority trial subject eumycetoma require surgery . There three arm study : The first arm Fosravuconazole 300 mg weekly second arm Fosravuconazole 200 mg weekly . Both arm evaluate 3 month . At time-point , one study arm drop accord drop-the-loser design , base efficacy toxicity . The control arm standard treatment use itraconazole 400mg daily . Patients receive treatment one year . An interim analysis plan data accumulate sample size 28 3 month end point . This study do Mycetoma Research Centre , Sudan ethic regulatory approval receive . The study plan recruit 138 subject end trial . The main inclusion criterion subject provide consent , age 18 year primary moderate eumycetoma ( size 2-10 cm ) cause Polymerase Chain Reaction ( PCR ) confirm Madurella mycetomatis . Females child bearing age require stringent contraception . The main exclusion criterion eumycetoma &gt; 10 cm , previous treatment , significant concomitant illness preclude evaluation treatment condition treat drug know interact azoles . The study expect new safer efficacious eumycetoma treatment .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>4.1 . Inclusion criterion Subjects must meet follow inclusion criterion eligible enrollment study : 1 . Subjects eumycetoma cause Madurella mycetomatis confirm PCR . 2 . Eumycetoma lesion ≥ 2 cm &lt; 10 cm diameter 3 . Single eumycetoma lesion present foot lower limb 4 . Age ≥18 year 5 . Able comply protocol procedure available followup 6 . Written inform consent subject 7 . Female specific inclusion criterion Negative pregnancy test If female child bear potential , use adequate contraception period trial 2 month complete study treatment 4.2 . Exclusion criteria The presence follow exclude subject study enrolment : 1 . Previous surgical medical treatment eumycetoma include previous antifungal treatment 2 . Presence locoregional lymphatic extension , osteomyelitis , bone involvement base radiology pre coexist condition would preclude evaluation eumycetoma . 3 . Pregnancy lactation screening , intent become pregnant 4 . Concomitant severe disease may compromise subject followup evaluation ( psychiatric condition , chronic hepatitis , neutropenia , HIV/AIDS , diabetes mellitus , adrenocortical insufficiency example ) 5 . Contraindication use itraconazole include congestive heart failure , ventricular dysfunction , ventricular arrhythmia , negative inotropic state . For comprehensive list contraindication contraindicate concomitant medication refer package insert itraconazole ( Sporanox® ) 6 . Contraindication use fosravuconazole 7 . Preexisting liver disease , transaminase level &gt; 2 x laboratory 's Upper Limit Normal ( ULN ) , elevate level alkaline phosphatase bilirubin 8 . Receiving likely require drug either substrate CYP3A4 and/or metabolize CYP3A4 ( cisapride , oral midazolam , nisoldipine , felodipine , pimozide , quinidine , dofetilide , triazolam , methadone , levacetylmethadol [ levomethadyl ] contraindicate ) 9 . Corrected QT Fridericia 's formula ( QTcF ) &gt; 450 msec ECG known take prior entry 10 . Subjects Familial Short QT syndrome ( correct QT interval ) QTc prolongation 11 . History hypersensitivity azole antifungal drug . 12 . Participation clinical trial within sixmonth period .</criteria>
