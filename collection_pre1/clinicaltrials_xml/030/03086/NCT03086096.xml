	<brief_title>CIRSE Registry LifePearl Microspheres</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>CIREL capture broad spectrum real clinical data delivery transcatheter arterial chemoembolisation ( TACE ) use LifePearl Microspheres load Irinotecan ( LP-IRI ) observe clinical outcome . The aim improve understand LifePearl microspheres administer part standard treatment colorectal adenocarcinoma liver metastases Europe . Ultimately , collection real-life data intend provide evidence-base conclusion draw optimise treatment protocol consequently therapy outcome TACE perform LifePearl Microspheres . The CIREL registry prospective multicentre observational ( non-interventional ) study . In order meet objective collect real-life data , subject receive TACE LifePearl Microspheres load Irinotecan fulfil inclusion criterion participate centre ask participate . Patients ask participate registry treat LifePearl Microspheres load Irinotecan part treatment determine treat clinician . In way , participation registry influence way patient treat accord treat clinician , influence quality treatment . In order measure change quality life enrol patient different moment time treatment LifePearl microspheres , CIREL incorporate EORTC QLQ-C30 questionnaire . The quality life questionnaire suggest offer patient follow three point time : - Immediately ( max . 1 week ) treatment LP-IRI - 2-3 week completion full treatment LP-IRI - 3 month completion full treatment LP-IRI Filling quality-of-life questionnaire entirely voluntary patient . The patient offer fill questionnaire his/her mother tongue . The patient choice fill questionnaire either hard copy online via electronic data capture system . The CIREL registry include central image analysis perform Fédération Francophone de Cancérologie Digestive ( FFCD ) . The aim analyis detect possible association RECIST ( v1.1 ) criterion observe outcomes , reduce bias provide second reading raise data quality . The registry aim enrol 500 patient . The registry stop enrolment three year enrolment first patient , unless decide differently Steering Committee . Patients follow one year enrolment last patient .</detailed_description>
