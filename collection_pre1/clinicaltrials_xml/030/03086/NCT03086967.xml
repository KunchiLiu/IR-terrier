	<brief_summary>The Foley catheter safe , effective method cervical ripening . Limited data exists indicate ideal time placement optimal cervical ripen prior induction . The propose study randomize control trial determine shorten placement 12 6 hour foley catheter decrease time start induction delivery . The prediction shorten foley bulb placement result short induction time , increase patient satisfaction decrease length stay labor delivery secondary decrease medical cost .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Cervical Ripening With Double-lumen Balloon Catheter Six Versus Twelve Hours</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Objective : To determine whether double-lumen balloon catheter require twelve hour cervical canal achieve maximal cervical dilation . It hypothesis maximum cervical dilation benefit double lumen foley catheter achieve within initial six hour placement . Study Design : Overview : All eligible patient singleton pregnancy 37 week gestational age great present clinically/ medically indicate induction unfavorable cervical exam invite participate.. As per ACOG guideline , induction perform prior 39 week medically indicate . Medical indication induction prior 39 week include limited preeclampsia , oligohydramnios growth restriction . Upon admission Labor Delivery , woman assess eligibility obstetric physician . A digital cervical examination perform Bishop score assign . Patients Bishop score â‰¤ 6 thought benefit cervical ripening agent participant randomize base parity point . Type Study : This study prospective , randomized clinical control trial human subject . Eligibility : Inclusion Criteria : 1 . Intrauterine pregnancy 37 week gestational age great determine best obstetrical date criterion 2 . Singleton gestation 3 . Vertex presentation 4 . Clinically adequate pelvis 5 . Bishop Score less equal 6 6 . 16 year old NC state law provide emancipation minor , Chapter 7B-Article 35 . Exclusion Criteria : 1 . Any maternal fetal contraindication vaginal delivery 2 . Known uterine anomaly 3 . Multifetal gestation 4 . Estimated fetal weight 4500 gm great 5 . Ruptured membrane Materials Methods : A qualified obstetric provider provide eligible woman detail study , include study objective method . Consent obtain witnessed patient elect participate . Enrollment randomization study occur . Patients randomize two group use computer generate random number . The randomization stratify base parity ( i.e. , woman prior vaginal delivery 20 week gestation v. woman ) . A foley bulb place qualified obstetric provider . Foley bulb insert without speculum technique without use stylet . In accordance standard care , sterile saline place intrauterine vaginal balloon tolerate patient maximum 80 cc balloon . The use concomitant low dose pitocin foley bulb discretion admit obstetric team . If patient 's foley bulb spontaneously expel within maximum allotted time , manually remove six twelve hour . At time manual removal expulsion foley balloon , patient 's cervix check experienced obstetric provider . As per usual protocol , additional cervical ripen labor induction proceed per manage obstetric team . Independent Variables : Data collection include independent variable maternal age , parity , BMI , race ( Caucasian , African American , Hispanic , Asian , ) , Bishop Score , use magnesium epidural use . Data collection independent fetal variable include gestational age estimate fetal weight . Outcome Variables : The primary outcome time foley bulb placement time delivery . Secondary outcome include time foley bulb placement extrusion rate cesarean section . Additional comparison variable include : neonatal weight , APGAR score intrapartum postpartum infection rate .</detailed_description>
