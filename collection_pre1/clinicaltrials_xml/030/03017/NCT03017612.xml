	<brief_summary>The objective study evaluate safety effectiveness Raindrop Near Vision Inlay implant bilateral pseudophakes presbyopia improvement near intermediate vision . The ReVision Optics corneal inlay 2.0-mm , 30-micron inlay make hydrogel material , implant lasik flap . Subjects must require reading add +1.50 D +2.50 D. Subjects must preoperative manifest refraction spherical equivalent -0.50 +1.00 D 0.75 D refractive cylinder . The Raindrop Near Vision Inlay implant non-dominant eye .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Clinical Trial Evaluate Safety Effectiveness Raindrop Near Vision Inlay Pseudophakic Subjects</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Presbyopia natural outcome pseudophakic subject monofocal toric intraocular lens . Treatment pseudophakic presbyopia generally consist reading glass , contact lens , monovision LASIK , allow patient see near object . All option suffer limitation patient perspective . For example , read glass easily lose conveniently available . Multifocal contact lenses suffer visual symptom instability due potential rotation movement contact lenses surface cornea . And , successful monovision generally limited patient history successful use contact lenses monovision , even eye , monovision associate substantial decrease stereo acuity contrast sensitivity . ReVision Optics develop Raindrop Near Vision Inlay correction near intermediate vision . The inlay refractive index human cornea . The inlay place non-dominant eye , center pupil corneal flap ( LASIK ) make . The Raindrop Near Vision Inlay expect provide low induction visual symptom improvement near intermediate vision emmetropic subject presbyopia . This technology may also demonstrate potential clinical utility bilateral pseudophakic subject .</detailed_description>
