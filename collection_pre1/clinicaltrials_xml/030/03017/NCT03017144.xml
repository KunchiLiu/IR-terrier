	<detailed_description>Background Cardiac arrest time-critical emergency situation , treat cardiopulmonary resuscitation ( CPR ) . The action resuscitation lead international guideline ( Nolan et al 2010 ) . Because relatively rare nature cardiac arrest many ward clinic , regular resuscitation training necessary . During cardiopulmonary resuscitation sudden medical crisis situation , addition medical knowledge technical skill ( TS ) , also non-technical skill ( NTS ) need ( Castelao et al 2011 , Fletcher et al 2002 , Helmreich et al 1999 , Gaba et al 1998 ) . NTS behavioural element ought improve team performance . However , importance NTS demonstrate simulated setting , real life . Objective , purpose , hypothesis The aim study evaluate technical especially non-technical skill resuscitation team real-life resuscitation situation . Findings study may help recognize possible weakness issue could improve training . The hypothesis technical skill probably high level , improvement point non-technical skill ought know good . Investigators also hypothesis good non-technical performance relate good technical performance . Design Methods Turku University Central Hospital lie Southwestern part Finland , provide medical service 865 000 inhabitant . The target group study resuscitation team adult ICU Turku University Central Hospital . This team consist ICU doctor ( commonly anaesthesiologist specialized intensive care ) , two ICU nurse , one medical technician . These people treat approximately 90 cardiac arrest per year , group also get alarm ( like shortness breath , unconscious patient acute situation ) . This ICU resuscitation team take care resuscitation call new part Turku University Hospital , old part hospital take care either resuscitation team pediatric ICU prehospital emergency medical service system . The data 30 video-recorded real-life resuscitation situation treat resuscitation team Turku University Hospital collect overall NTS TS score measure use validated assessment tool . The correlation TS NTS analyze statistical method . The resuscitation team use routinely defibrillator ( Leardal HeartStart MRx ) Q-CPR technology , data gather Q-CPR device analyze . In addition , record resuscitation situation , every member resuscitation team call phone . During call team member ask tell example , go well resuscitation , could do well . Based answer , inductive analysis make . Ethics The study protocol approve Ethics Committee Turku University . All patient suffer sudden cardiac arrest Turku University new hospital building area consider eligible study regardless initial rhythm presume aetiology . Written information consent patient need , study direct resuscitation team performance . The patient identify phase study .</detailed_description>
