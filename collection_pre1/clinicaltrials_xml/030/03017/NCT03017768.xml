	<detailed_description>1 . INTRODUCTION Gastro-esophageal reflux disease ( GERD ) , define presence symptom lesion attribute reflux gastric content esophagus , increasingly prevalent condition Western society . Typical reflux symptom heartburn regurgitation , GERD manifest variety esophageal extra-esophageal ( atypical ) symptom ( e.g . chronic cough ) . In human , pain multimodal experience compose sensory , physiological psychological aspect . In order mimic clinical situation , experimental model base multimodal test regimen different receptor central nervous system mechanism activate . Advances esophageal sensory stimulation establish typical atypical symptom may arise acid reflux , also reflux event less acidic pH ( pH 4-7 ) . In GERD patient persist symptom spite proton pump inhibitor ( PPI ) treatment ( refractory GERD ) , ongoing weakly acidic reflux well establish main underlying factor . The basis symptom generation weakly-acidic reflux event remain elucidated , acid sensitivity pH range 4-7 , mechanical distention ( enhanced air refluxate ) , sensitivity chemical factor ( e.g . bile ) esophageal hypersensitivity physiological level reflux propose . The investigator speculate visceral hypersensitivity play important role esophageal symptom perception . This suggest reflux parameter usual within physiological number PPI therapy . Also , previous study demonstrate refractory GERD patient PPI therapy increase visceral hypersensitivity thermal , chemical mechanical esophageal stimulation compare healthy subject . Serotonin 5-hydroxytryptamine ( 5-HT ) major neurotransmitter predominantly find central nervous system gastro-intestinal ( GI ) tract ( mucosal enterochromaffin cell ) . 5-HT derive tryptophan play pivotal role regulation GI secretion , motility long associate emotion regulation psychological problem depression , anxiety phobia . Acute tryptophan depletion ( ATD ) , temporarily reduce availability essential amino acid tryptophan ( TRP ) , decrease 5-HT synthesis validate technique acutely low central peripheral 5-HT concentration . This accomplished administration amino acid mixture lack TRP . ATD widely use psychiatric research investigate role central 5-HT affective disorder research demonstrate ATD also affect GI physiology delay gastric empty enhance visceral pain perception rectal balloon distention . Furthermore , ATD show alter gastric postprandial motor function distension-induced nausea . These finding establish involvement 5-HT control gastric accommodation sensitivity . 2 . RATIONALE AND OBJECTIVES Multiple study show 5-HT important player brain-gut axis , exact role currently clear . It previously show acute administration citalopram , selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor ( SSRI ) , significantly lower chemical mechanical sensitivity hypersensitive healthy volunteer . Buspirone , partial 5-HT1A-receptor agonist , able modify esophageal motility . The aim current study investigate effect acute tryptophan depletion ( ATD ) esophageal sensitivity group healthy volunteer evaluate role symptom perception . 3 . GENERAL DESCRIPTION OF THE STUDY All participant receive sign inform consent initiation study . Esophageal sensitivity test multimodal stimulation two session ( placebo amino acid solution ATD ) , interval least one week . 4 . MATERIALS AND METHODS Studies perform use multimodal esophageal stimulation probe allow thermal , mechanical , electrical chemical stimulation esophagus . During stimulation , subject instruct record perception symptom use electronic Visual Analogue Scale ( VAS ) system . This device allow subject scale perception pain scale 0 10 . First perception ( VAS=1 ) , pain perception threshold ( VAS=5 ) pain tolerance threshold ( VAS=7 ) record . All type esophageal stimulation immediately terminate pain tolerance threshold reach . At time pain tolerance threshold reach ( VAS=7 ) , subject ask draw refer pain area , identify location referral area pain . Thermal stimulation perform re-circulating saline solution ( NaCl 0.09 % ) , heated water bath , balloon mount probe . Stimulation temperature steadily increase increase flow rate water bath balloon . Flow rate control computer operate pump . The volume balloon keep constant 5ml avoid mechanical stimulation esophagus . A temperature sensor present balloon continuously monitor stimulation temperature , display online computer display throughout study . Mechanical stimulation perform distention balloon mount probe . The flow saline ( NaCl 0.09 % ) balloon , induce distention , regulate computer control pump . The volume balloon display online computer screen throughout stimulation . Mechanical stimulation perform water 37°C , avoid thermal stimulation esophagus . Mechanical stimulation precede preconditioning period balloon distend pain perception threshold ( VAS=5 ) reach . This preconditioning period use precondition esophageal tissue allow subject get use feel mechanical distention . Electrical stimulation perform 2 stimulation electrode mount proximal balloon . Electrical block pulse give use standard electrical stimulator . Single burst pulse give duration 1ms 200Hz.The amplitude pulse steadily increase , step 0.5mA interval 15 second . For safety , maximum intensity limit 50 mA . ECG monitoring perform safety measure electrical stimulation esophagus . Chemical stimulation perform distal esophagus infuse acidic solution ( HCl 0.1N ) esophagus . Infusion rate control peristaltic infusion pump flow rate 2ml/min . The stimulation last maximum 30 minute . Acute tryptophan depletion The effect ATD esophageal sensitivity study . The amino acid mixture prepare accord protocol previously use investigator . All substrates commercially available isotopic chemical purity minimal 99 % . The identity product confirm use gas chromatography - mass spectrometry ( GC-MS , GC-column : AT5-MS 30m x 0.25 mm iternal diameter ; 0.25µm film ( Grace ) ) . The amino acid mixture consist 15 amino acid , ( 4.1g L-alanine , 2.4g glycine , 2.4g L-histidine , 6.0g L-isoleucine , 10.1g L-leucine , 6.7g L-lysine , 4.3g L-phenylalanine , 9.2g L-proline , 5.2g L-serine , 4.3g L-threonine , 5.2g L-tyrosine , 6.7g L-valine , 3.7g L-argine , 2.0g L-cysteine , 3.0g L-methionine 3.0g L-trypyophan ) . The TRP-deficient amino acid mixture consist 15 amino acid lack tryptophan . The amino acid mixture administer via nasogastric probe avoid nausea due unpleasant taste smell mixture . During placebo session , control amino acid mixture use , contain amino acid enrich TRP order prevent decrease TRP level . Over time , participant receive placebo ATD first session random sequence . In second session , subject receive product he/she n't receive first time . Because amino acid mixture influence level 5-HT HV first exert Mini International Neuropsychiatric Interview ( dutch , version 5.0.0 , DSM-IV ) recruitment volunteer evaluate psychiatric condition . STUDY OUTLINE After overnight fast subject come endoscopy unit UZ Gasthuisberg , study perform . Two session schedule every subject : one placebo one ATD session , least one week interval session . Sessions run single-blind way , order placebo ATD randomize . Since maximal TRP depletion obtain approximately 5 hour intake amino acid mixture , amino acid administer nasogastric infusion 5 hour prior actual start esophageal stimulation . During time administration amino acid mixture actual start esophageal stimulation , subject ask watch standardized movie neutral emotional content . Five hour administration amino acid mixture , multimodal stimulation probe position mouth . After probe position esophagus ( 10 cm low esophageal sphincter ) , fix chin subject remain semi-recumbent position entire study period . Before start stimulation , adaptation period 15 minute subject , get use feeling probe provide instruction correct use VAS meter . VAS score monitor type stimulation . All stimulation immediately stop moment subject reach pain tolerance threshold ( VAS=7 ) except electrical stimulation , stop stimulation reach VAS 5 , safety reason .</detailed_description>
