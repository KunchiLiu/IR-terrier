	<brief_title>Safety Tolerability Sodium Thiosulfate Patients With ACS Undergoing PCI Via Radial Approach .</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Despite recent advance treatment , acute myocardial infarction ( AMI ) frequently result permanent myocardial injury impose increase risk adverse cardiac remodelling , diminish cardiac function development heart failure . Decreased cardiac function PPCI associate impaired prognosis . Although PPCI tremendous benefit AMI , ischemia also reperfusion consider cause myocardial injury cardiomyocyte death.This phenomenon refer `` ischemia reperfusion injury '' literature cause sudden restoration blood flow accompany intracellular pH change calcium overload , cardiomyocyte hypercontracture , myocardial inflammation , oxidative stress generation mitochondrial permeability transition pore opening . Reducing ischemia reperfusion injury expect decrease infarct size , decrease adverse cardiac remodelling improve cardiac function well clinical outcome . Hydrogen sulfide ( H2S ) third endogenous gaseous transmitter next carbon monoxide ( CO ) nitric oxide ( NO ) involve physiological mediator several body organ tissue process . H2S synthesize endogenously enzymatic non-enzymatic pathway . A non-enzymatic pathway reductive reaction thiosulfate , pyruvate act hydrogen donor . Thiosulfate act intermediate sulfur metabolism cysteine know metabolite H2S way also able produce H2S , especially hypoxic condition . H2S show protect myocardium ischemia reperfusion injury various experimental animal model ischemic heart disease ; e.g . reduces infarct size apoptosis attenuate cardiac function . Inhibition leukocyte endothelial cell interaction , neutralization reactive oxygen specie ( ROS ) reduction apoptotic signalling suggest additional mechanism underlie cardioprotective effect H2S setting . STS , H2S donor , use human since 1933 treatment cyanide intoxication use since eighty treatment vascular calcification end-stage renal disease . It also use prevent toxicity cisplatin treatment . More recently , study show STS delay progression coronary artery calcification haemodialysis patient . The mechanism action disease think base potential antioxidant property STS . In case intravenous STS use different dos 5 75 g per day . Side effect STS include hypotension , nausea vomiting , gastrointestinal disturbance , hypernatraemia 5 % hemodialysis patient metabolic acidosis occur . Most side effect mild manageable . STS administration never test clinical setting ACS . Cardiac catheterization via radial approach increasingly used femoral approach few vascular complication , minimal risk nerve injury virtually postprocedural bed rest . During radial approach combination vasodilating , blood pressure lower anticoagulant drug give patient ( Verapamil , nitroglycerin , heparin ) , `` radialis-cocktail '' . These drug could potentially interact STS data regard safety STS patient ACS treat PCI via radial approach need test STS phase II trial . The SAFE ACS phase 1/2 , open-label , dose-escalation study test hypothesis STS , top standard medical treatment , safely administer patient present ACS well-tolerated . We use `` 3+3 design '' fix dose endpoint 30 gram STS 2 gift 15 gram , base standard dose 25 gram use indication . Additionally test effect STS treatment oxidative stress STS infusion laboratory analysis various oxidative stress marker .</detailed_description>
