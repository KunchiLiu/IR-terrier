	<brief_title>Swimming Pool Environment Impact Human Respiratory Health</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Objectives : 1 . In relation human exposure 1.1 . To assess level certain disinfection by-product ( DBPs ) blood urine ( biomarkers exposure ) ; 1.2 . To assess swim induced change biomarkers genotoxicity , specifically micronuclei ( MN ) exfoliate urothelial cell buccal cell DNA damage peripheral blood lymphocyte , urine mutagenicity exfoliate urothelial ; 1.3 . To assess effect swim pool exposure oxidative stress lung damage swim pool user ; 1.4 . To assess impact DBPs , include volatile DBPs airway function , inflammation reactivity ; 1.5 . To assess impact swim skin transepidermal water loss dermal condition . 2 . In relation swim pool environment 2.1 . To assess water air quality analysis several chemical ( DBPs ) , physicochemical microbiological parameter associate short-term variation level ( hourly daily ) ; 2.2 . To assess microbiological contamination highly used surface ; 2.3 . To assess mutagenicity indoor chlorinate brominated swimming pool water . Methods Study set Chlorinated brominate public indoor municipal swimming pool North Portugal . Study design This study follow two distinct approach : 1 . A cross-sectional analysis ass swim pool physicochemical microbiological characteristic association parameter measure indicator water air quality , contamination surface health parameter assess recreational user , swim teacher pool attendant . 2 . An uncontrolled , study assess acute chronic environmental exposure effect respiratory biomarkers competitive swimmer : 1 . Assessment acute change : regular competitive swimmer ask swim 40 minute single , indoor , 50 m-long chlorinate swim pool . Before swimming , battery measurement assess evaluate respiratory health biomarkers . 2 . Assessment chronic change : regular na√Øf competitive swimmer follow mean period 90 day . A battery measurements biological sample collect baseline evaluation 90 day , order evaluate long-term change respiratory health biomarkers . Recruitment data collection procedures 1 . Cross-sectional study . The cross-sectional analysis perform fifty municipal indoor swimming pool North Portugal voluntary basis . The administrative board swim pool approach research team present study 's purpose procedures obtain consent perform study . Upon acceptance , recreational user , swim coaches/teachers pool attendant contact invited participate . All subject receive write description study ( appendix I-a ) inform consent form ( appendix II-a ) . Those provide informed consent sign subject legal tutor ( minor ) include study . Recreational swimmer , swim teacher pool attendant ask complete self-administered standardize home questionnaire comprise sociodemographic health-related information , major focus respiratory health . Participants also ask provide information food consumption , physical activity level psychological well-being . Subjects return complete questionnaire swim pool facility . A medical examination also perform trained health professional include anthropometric measurement , blood pressure evaluation , urine sample collection , skin prick testing , exhale breath condensate collection , lung function evaluation spirometry bronchodilation , period conveniently schedule participate subject . The assessment swimming pool chemical ( DBPs others ) , physicochemical microbiological characteristic include sampling water , air eventually select surface , include : pool edge , stair start block , floor ( pool bathhouse ) , wall ( concrete glass pool bathhouse ) highly touched surface bathhouse bench . We measure different chemical , physicochemical microbiological parameter multiple location within pool structure order characterize exposure spatial temporal distribution within specific swim pool also different swimming pool study . 2 . Uncontrolled , study . A single , indoor , 50-meter-long chlorinate swim pool Porto , Portugal , select study . The administrative board approach research team present study 's purpose procedures obtain consent perform study . Upon acceptance , competitive swimming team ask participate study . All subject receive write description study ( appendix I-b ) inform consent form ( appendix II-b ) . Competitive swimmer 12 year age old provide inform consent sign subject legal tutor ( minor ) include uncontrolled study ass acute chronic respiratory symptom regular training session . This assessment execute follow two approach : 1 . Assessment acute change : period conveniently schedule swimmer coach , medical examination perform order ass baseline respiratory biomarkers competitive swimmer . This examination include assessment exhale breath condensate lung function evaluation . The biological measurement perform single regular training session interviewer-administered questionnaire apply . 2 . Assessment chronic change : Competitive swimmer also follow 90-day period order evaluate long-term change respiratory cancer biomarkers . The baseline evaluation consist assessment biological measurement , namely anthropometric measurement , blood pressure evaluation , sample collection ( i.e . blood urine sample buccal swab ) , skin prick testing , pupillometry , capsaicin challenge , exhale breath condensate collection , lung function evaluation ( namely , spirometry bronchodilation , impulse oscillometry , methacholine challenge fractional concentration orally exhale nitric oxide ) transepidermal water loss assessment . Participants also ask provide information sociodemographic characteristic , personal family history disease , use medication , frequency self-reported respiratory , ocular cutaneous symptom , data health-related behavior , namely tobacco use , physical activity level food consumption , interviewer-administered questionnaire . A full examination perform baseline follow-up assessment ( 90 day ) . This evaluation perform trained health professional room inside swim pool facility separate swim pool area , period conveniently schedule swimmer coach . Due possibility experience transient symptom , participant ask visit research department order perform methacholine challenge . Participants reimburse travel expense .</detailed_description>
