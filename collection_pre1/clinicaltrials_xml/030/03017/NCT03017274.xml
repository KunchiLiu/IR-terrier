	<brief_summary>Recently report consistent percentage general population consider suffer problem cause wheat and/or gluten ingestion , even though CD wheat allergy . This clinical condition name Non-Celiac Gluten Sensitivity ' ( NCGS ) . In previous paper investigator suggest term 'Non-Celiac Wheat Sensitivity ' ( NCWS ) , since know component wheat cause symptom NCGS patient , investigator also show patient high frequency coexistent multiple food hypersensitivity . The clinical picture NCWS characterize combined gastrointestinal ( bloat , abdominal pain , diarrhea and/or constipation , nausea , epigastric pain , gastroesophageal reflux , aphthous stomatitis ) extra-intestinal and/or systemic manifestation ( headache , depression , anxiety , 'foggy mind , ' tiredness , dermatitis skin rash , fibromyalgia-like joint/muscle pain , leg arm numbness , anemia ) . Nowadays data available abdominal ultrasonographic feature NCWS patient . Therefore , aim present study evaluate abdominal ultrasonographic feature NCWS patient comparison patient affect celiac disease .</brief_summary>

The researcher demonstrate patient affected seronegative celiac disease presence dilate bowel loop thicken small bowel wall sensitivity 83 % negative predictive value 95 % CD diagnosis . Considering presence one two sign , abdominal US sensitivity increase 92 % negative predictive value 98 % . Nowadays data available abdominal ultrasonographic feature NCWS patient . Therefore , aim present study evaluate abdominal ultrasonographic feature NCWS patient comparison patient affect celiac disease .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>To diagnose NCWS recently propose criterion adopt . All patient meet follow criterion : negative serum antitransglutaminase ( antitTG ) antiendomysium ( EmA ) immunoglobulin ( Ig ) A IgG antibodies absence intestinal villous atrophy negative IgEmediated immuneallergy test wheat ( skin prick test and/or serum specific IgE detection ) resolution IBS symptoms standard elimination diet , exclude wheat , cow 's milk , egg , tomato , chocolate , selfreported food ( ) causing symptom symptom reappearance doubleblind placebocontrolled ( DBPC ) wheat challenge . As investigator previously describe study , DBPC cow 's milk protein challenge `` open '' food challenge perform . To diagnose CD standard criterion adopt . All patient meet follow criterion : positive serum antitransglutaminase ( antitTG ) antiendomysium ( EmA ) immunoglobulin ( Ig ) A IgG antibodies presence intestinal villous atrophy . NCWS diagnosis exclude patient : positive EmA culture medium duodenal biopsy , also case normal villi/crypts ratio duodenal mucosa selfexclusion wheat diet refusal reintroduce enter study previously diagnose gastrointestinal disorder nervous system disease and/or major psychiatric disorder physical impairment limit physical activity .</criteria>
