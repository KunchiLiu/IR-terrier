	<brief_summary>The investigator hypothesize relationship vivo kinematic abnormality patient-rated outcome scapholunate interosseous ligament injury ( SLIL ) The secondary null hypothesis : There kinematic difference subject unilateral , symptomatic , full thickness scapholunate ligament tear comparison contralateral wrist without scapholunate ligament injury . The investigator aim answer question : - What baseline validate outcomes subject SLIL injury ? - What baseline physical measure ( range motion , Jamar Dynamometry ) ?</brief_summary>
