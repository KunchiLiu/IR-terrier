	<brief_summary>Omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acid ( w-3-PUFA ) may potential role enhance postoperative balance host immunity reduce incidence postoperative atrial fibrillation ( POAF ) . CHO drink 2h induction anesthesia may reduce necessity vasoactive drug preoperatively . aim study investigate effect two nutrient patient undergo CABG cardiopulmonary bypass ( CPB ) morbidity ICU , mainly POFA . This double-blind control randomized trial .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The author include patient sexes medical diagnose chronic coronary heart disease eligible elective CABG age range 18 80 year . All patient sign write informed consent form . We exclude insulin-dependent diabetic , hepatic renal disorder , thrombocytopenia , important dyslipidemia ( triglyceride 3-fold high normal standard ) , gastro-esophageal reflux , acute coronary syndrome , allergy fish oil , severe malnutrition . We also exclude patient underwent off-pump CABG , combine heart procedure , reoperations , receive blood transfusion last 3 month . Patients randomize use random number software available www.graphpad.com . They allocate four group : group CHO ( patient receive 8h fast solid 2h fast 200mL drink contain water plus 12.5 % maltodextrin ( 25g ) infusion intraoperative w-3-PUFA ) ; Control group ( preoperative fast solid 8h allow drink 200 mL water 2h anesthesia ; infusion intraoperative w-3-PUFA ) ; group CHO+w3 ( patient receive 8h fast solid 2h fast 200mL drink contain water plus 12.5 % maltodextrin ( 25g ) , intravenous intraoperative dose w-3-PUFA ( 0.2 mcg/kg ) 4h ) ; group w3 ( preoperative fast solid allow drink 200 mL water 2h anesthesia , intravenous intraoperative dose w-3-PUFA ( 0.2 mcg/kg ) 4h ) . Only dietitian hospital know randomization chart inform ward nurse give patient one two preoperative drink send surgical theater . . She also inform anesthesiologist patient would receive intraoperative w-3-PUFA . The surgeon assistant team know group belong patient . A team cardiologists intensivists also blind study design randomization collect data . Endpoints The primary endpoint incidence POAF need inotropic vasoactive drug ( dobutamine and/or noradrenalin ) wean CPB ( intraoperative period ) ICU ( postoperative period ) . As secondary endpoint investigator look perioperative morbidity , hospital mortality length ICU stay total postoperative stay .</detailed_description>
