	<brief_title>Yield Rate Procurement Histologic Core With Endoscopic Ultrasound-guided Fine Needle Biopsy With 20-gauge Ultrasound Biopsy Needles Solid Pancreatic Masses : Pilot Study</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma fourth cause death Western world . Surgery remain treatment offering advantage term overall survival ( 5-year survival range , 15-25 % ) , unfortunately 10-20 % patient present resectable disease time diagnosis . Regarding diagnosis pancreatic cancer , proper tool high diagnostic yield important . The investigator investigate technical feasibility diagnostic yield recent-developed new 20-gauge Procore needle EUS-guided fine needle biopsy pancreatic solid lesion . The investigator apply 20-gauge procore needle EUS-guided fine needle biopsy diagnosis pancreatic solid mass . A total 30 patient enrolled present pilot study .</detailed_description>
