	<brief_summary>This phase I trial study side effect genetically modify T cell decitabine treat patient ovarian , primary peritoneal , fallopian tube cancer come back respond previous treatment . White blood cell call T cell collect via process call leukapheresis , genetically modify recognize attack tumor cell , give back patient . Decitabine may induce increase amount target protein NY-ESO-1 available surface tumor cell . Giving genetically modify T cell decitabine may kill tumor cell .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To determine safety tolerability autologous NY-ESO-1 redirect T cell therapy combination decitabine low-dose IL-2 patient treatment refractory recurrent epithelial ovarian , primary peritoneal fallopian tube carcinoma . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . To evaluate persistence genetically modify cell peripheral blood , tumor site . II . To evaluate post treatment phenotype functionality genetically modify T cell isolated peripheral blood tumor site . III . To assess change immunoscore , regulatory T cell ( Tregs ) , myeloid cell subset , antigen spread peripheral blood tumor site . IV . To determine effect treatment tumor determine immune relate Response Evaluation Criteria Solid Tumors ( irRECIST ) progression free survival . TERTIARY OBJECTIVES : I . To assess influence demographic disease molecular characteristic treatment outcomes complete response ( CR ) overall survival ( OS ) . OUTLINE : COURSE 1 : Patients receive decitabine IV daily 1 hour day 1-3 , cyclophosphamide IV 2 hour day 5 6 , genetically engineer NY-ESO-1-specific T lymphocytes IV intraperitoneally ( IP ) day 9 . Patients also receive aldesleukin subcutaneously ( SC ) twice daily ( BID ) day 10-23 . COURSE 2 : Patients receive decitabine IV daily 1 hour day 31-33 , genetically engineer NY-ESO-1-specific T lymphocytes IV IP day 37 , aldesleukin SC BID day 38-51 . After completion study treatment , patient follow monthly 3-9 month , every 6 month 4 year , annually 15 year .</detailed_description>
