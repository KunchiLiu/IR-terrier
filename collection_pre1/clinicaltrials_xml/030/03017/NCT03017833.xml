	<brief_title>Study TAK-228 ( MLN0128 ) Combination With Metformin Patients With Advanced Cancers</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Study Groups : If find eligible take part study , assign dose level TAK-228 metformin base join study . Up 6 dose level TAK-228 metformin test . Up 6 participant enrol dose level . The first group participant receive low dose level . Each new group receive high dos group , intolerable side effect see . This continue high tolerable dose combination TAK-228 metformin find . This call dose escalation . After high tolerable dos find , additional 14 participant enrol receive metformin TAK-228 high tolerable dos . This call dose expansion . Study Drug Administration : Cycle 1 42 day Cycles 2 beyond 28 day . You take TAK-228 metformin mouth every day time day full cup water ( 8 ounce ) empty stomach . You eat drink anything 2 hour 1 hour TAK-228 dose . You take home except day study visit . Depending dose , may take metformin 1-3 time every day . Your study doctor tell often take drug . During Cycle 1 , take metformin first 2 week . You take TAK-228 metformin Day 15 Cycle 1 . This call titration period . Length Study Participation : You may continue take study drug long doctor think best interest . You longer able take study drug disease get bad , intolerable side effect occur , unable follow study direction . Your participation study complete follow-up visit . Study Visits : At every study visit , ask health , drug take , side effect . You must fast least 8 hour visit . On Day 1 Cycle 1 : - You physical exam . - Blood ( 3 teaspoon ) urine draw routine test . Part blood sample use check glucose level . - You EKG take metformin . - If become pregnant , urine collect pregnancy test . If test positive , blood ( 1 teaspoon ) drawn confirm pregnant . On Day 8 , 22 , 29 , 36 Cycle 1 : - You physical exam . - Blood ( 2-3 teaspoon ) draw routine test . On Day 15 Cycle 1 : - You physical exam . - Blood ( 3 teaspoon ) draw routine test test diabetes . - Urine collect routine test . - You EKG take TAK-228 . On Day 1 Cycle 2 : - You physical exam . - Blood ( 3 teaspoon ) urine draw routine test . - You EKG . On Day 15 Cycle 2 : - You physical exam . - Blood ( 3 teaspoon ) urine draw routine test . On Day 1 Cycles 3 Beyond : - You physical exam . - Blood ( 3 teaspoon ) urine draw routine test . Part blood sample use test diabetes every 3 cycle . - You EKG every cycle . About every 8 week start Day 28 Cycle 2 , x-ray , CT , MRI , and/or PET scan . If study doctor think need , perform often . If study doctor think need , blood ( 1 teaspoon ) drawn measure tumor marker . At-Home Glucose Monitoring : You ask monitor glucose level home . The study staff give glucose monitor ( call glucometer ) teach use . You bring glucometer study visit study staff collect result test . End-of-Study Visit : Within 30 day last dose study drug : - You physical exam . - Blood ( 3 teaspoon ) draw routine test , check glucose level , test diabetes . - Urine collect routine test . - You EKG . - You x-ray , CT , MRI , and/or PET scan . - You continue monitor glucose level . - If study doctor think need , blood ( 1 teaspoon ) drawn measure tumor marker . If side effect end-of-study visit doctor think need , continue come clinic tests/procedures repeat side effect go away . This investigational study . TAK-228 FDA approve commercially available . TAK-228 currently use research purpose . Metformin FDA approve commercially available treatment diabetes mellitus . The combination drug treat advance cancer consider investigational . The study doctor explain study drug design work . Up 50 participant take part study . All enrol MD Anderson .</detailed_description>
