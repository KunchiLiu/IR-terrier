	<brief_summary>The PHITT trial over-arching study patient Hepatoblastoma ( HB ) Hepatocellular Carcinoma ( HCC ) . This trial use risk-adapted approach treatment child diagnose HB . Children HCC include separate cohort .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Paediatric Hepatic International Tumour Trial</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The trial evaluate whether reduce treatment low risk HB patient maintain excellent event free survival ( EFS ) decrease acute long-term toxicity . Intensification therapy use novel agent evaluate high risk group . The trial also compare three different regimen intermediate risk HB . Patients HCC divide group base whether tumour resectable unresectable and/or metastatic . Evaluation biology HB HCC , use identification/validation novel already report prognostic biomarkers well toxicity biomarkers key strand trial , patient risk group register . The trial also design optimise collection clinically annotate biologic specimen establish world 's large repository blood tissue sample paediatric patient HB HCC . The trial include 4 randomised comparison address therapeutic question . For low risk HB patient , outcome total 4 cycle treatment inferior receive total 6 cycle treatment . For intermediate risk patient , 3 regimen compare outcome toxicity . For high risk patient , 2 post induction regimen compare outcome . For resected HCC patient , addition GEMOX PLADO regimen compare . In addition follow assess : - To validate new global risk stratification , define Children 's Hepatic Tumours International Collaboration ( CHIC ) - To evaluate clinically relevant factor , include follow : - Provide comprehensive highly-validated panel diagnostic prognostic biomarkers - Determine paediatric HCC biologically different entity adult HCC - Develop genomic and/or biomarker analysis predict child may increase risk develop toxicity chemotherapy . - To establish collection clinically pathologically-annotated biological sample . - Evaluate surgical planning tool impact decision make process POST-TEXT III IV HB</detailed_description>
