	<brief_summary>Cervical nodal metastasis certain prognostic factor oral cancer . Appropriate management neck therefore paramount importance treatment oral cancer . However , still controversy treatment early maxillofacial malignancy . Currently , investigator accurate uniform treatment standard , include National Comprehensive Cancer Network ( NCCN ) recommend surgery radiotherapy option . Clinical evaluation indicate lymph node-negative patient eventually 25 % -35 % cervical node metastasis . Therefore , majority patient true node-negative , preventive cervical lymph node dissection obviously over-treatment , low quality life . Radiotherapy avoid surgery .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Objective : To evaluate effect radiotherapy neck early oral cancer poor pathologic factor . This randomize , prospective , open , multicenter study . Intervention : Patients receive primary tumor resection follow radiotherapy . Control : Patients receive primary tumor resection selective neck dissection . Primary : 2 year neck control rate Secondary : Disease-free survival ( 1 , 2 , 3 , 5 year ) Overall survival ( 3 , 5 year ) Quality life Endpoint definition : 1 year , 2 year , 3 year , 5 year disease-free survival define : patient proportion date surgery completion 1 year , 2 year , 3 year , 5 year find clear evidence recurrence metastasis . 3 year , 5 year overall survival define : proportion patient survive begin study third fifth year total enrollment .</detailed_description>
