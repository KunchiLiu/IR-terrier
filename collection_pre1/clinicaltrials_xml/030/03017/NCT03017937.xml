	<brief_summary>Clinical trial suggest device effective mitigating change brain structure function athlete population . The purpose current study measure response jugular vein various pressure apply generic compression device across various age gender . The relative jugular vein response measure use ultrasound .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The Device promise provide novel mechanism reduce prevent likelihood TBI , may use conjunction protective equipment . TBI lead cause death individual age 45 . The cost TBI U.S. estimate anywhere $ 50 $ 150 billion , annually . Concussion female high school soccer player note occur rate 4.5 concussion per 10,000 athletic exposure ( Comstock , Currie et al . 2015 ) . The investigator propose Slosh Theory explain difference offer mechanistic approach could help shed light way alleviate TBI burden society . Note Slosh Theory teach hydrodynamics ( fluid move within move container ) contribute , even main etiology , energy absorption cranial content mitigation SLOSH ( increase compensatory reserve volume ) may mitigate TBI . Significant morbidity , mortality , related cost cause traumatic brain injury ( TBI ) . A simple , effective , lightweight device worn athletes war fighter field , design mitigate TBI result blast trauma concussive event , would save life , huge cost currently experience life-treatment surviving victim . An externally-worn medical device ( Device ) apply mild jugular vein compression accord principle Queckenstedt Maneuver , develop Q30 Sports Science , LLC ( Q30 ) . Preliminary research suggest Device potential reduce likelihood TBI . The currently develop collar ( Smith 2009 , Smith Fisher 2011 , Smith Fisher 2011 , Smith 2012 ) approve study human ( IRB 2013-2240 ) result indicate safety use high demand maximal exertion activity . Regarding safety , externally worn collar meticulously design mimic body 's omohyoid muscle action upon jugular vein provide similar pressure volume increase surpass yawn mere act lie . Initial safety test early clinical trial indicate collar application safe efficacious prevent brain microstructure neurophysiological change response head impact .</detailed_description>
