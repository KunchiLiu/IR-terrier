	<brief_summary>Proximal humerus fracture ( break top part upper arm bone ) common old people poorer bone quality . Often patient undergo surgery fracture : bone fragment may acceptable enough position able heal naturally , patient may well enough medically undergo operation . These patient need wear sling immobilise injured shoulder , however muscle start weaken quickly unable use . This research project look whether strength-training opposite/uninjured limb , know `` cross education '' , effect preserve function injured/fractured limb . Participants randomise two group use minimisation , say group balance number term exact pattern fracture gender . One group receive traditional rehabilitation exercise treatment physiotherapist injured limb ; group receive addition also undergo strength-training exercise programme uninjured limb . Only qualified physiotherapist experience treat patient cohort involve . Sessions physiotherapy department last 30 minute comprise : patient review , exercise progression , advice giving/question answer ; home exercise programmes expect complete 2-3 time daily last 30 minute ; number session agree participant treat physiotherapist treat end agree , acceptable level function achieve . The Oxford Shoulder Score patient-reported outcome measure complete participant 6 12 week European Quality Life ( EuroQoL ) -5D-5L 12 week commencement treatment .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Cross-education Proximal Humerus Fracture Rehabilitation</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This study investigate use cross education ( ie . strength-training uninjured limb ) part recovery return function skeletally mature , adult patient measure Oxford Shoulder Score proximal humerus fracture answer question : use strength-training programme non-injured limb affect return function adult patient proximal humerus fracture ? Proximal humerus fracture ( break top part upper arm bone ) common , accounting 4-6 % fracture old population almost one-fifth fracture sustain fall stand height patient osteoporosis . These fracture functionally impair upper limb impact overall quality life . Some study show number previously fit independent patient may return independent activity follow proximal humerus fracture may even increase risk sustain subsequent fracture hip/neck femur . If new rehabilitation approach help improve level function achieve morbidity quality life patient could potentially improve . The age population United Kingdom mean number patient sustain fracture increase increase cost National Health Service risk morbidity/mortality/disability/poor health-related quality life . Treatment need address range movement ( ROM ) muscle strength well restoration function access community quickly possible . Effective , timely cost-efficient management patient must find . Patients proximal humerus fracture generally undergo period wear sling immobilise limb/stop move it- especially manage without operation . Different orthopaedic physiotherapy team across UK use different period immobilisation , start rehabilitation different time injury use different rehabilitation method . Only randomise control trial ( RCTs ) exist look start physiotherapy exactly physiotherapy . Studies need develop treatment rehabilitation protocols deliver best cost-effective patient care possible . Wearing sling/immobilisation limb little one week cause significant muscle wastage result loss strength loss function . Studies show 60 % reduction strength 5-6 week immobilisation . This early decline strength could due few nerve signal send brain inactive muscle . It suggest could prevent strength-training uninjured limb , know `` cross-education '' . The exact mechanism work still unknown think use cross-education could help maintain message send brain minimise change muscle facilitate quicker recovery . The body work reciprocally many way , example swing opposite arm ( step leg ) whilst walk . Many study already do show improvement/maintenance strength immobilise limb strength-training opposite limb study look uninjured patient low limb injury . Research use principle cross-education upper limb injury need applied practice routinely patient . The patient ask question Specialist Physiotherapist Doctor fracture clinic appointment see whether eligible take part study . If eligible provide write information sheet clinician explain study answer question may . Patients receive phone call primary researcher 24-48 hour provide study information answer question may gauge interest participation trial . If keen involve primary researcher arrange come Physiotherapy department sign write consent form . At appointment ( take place clinical office within department ) primary researcher use computer programme ( call Minim ) allocate one two study group . If allocated experimental group primary researcher teach strengthen exercise uninjured limb , arrange first follow physiotherapy appointment within next 2-3 week . Patients allocate control group ( standard rehabilitation ) book first physiotherapy appointment sign consent form . The patient also ask complete questionnaire current level function/pain/etc.- complete patient suffer particular injury regardless participation study . All participant ongoing physiotherapy treatment many appointment deem necessary agreement treat physiotherapist return require level function . Those experimental group receive strength-training regime uninjured limb addition usual rehabilitation injure limb . Those control group receive usual rehabilitation injure limb . All participant require complete questionnaire 6 12 week initial questionnaire complete ( case patient receive physiotherapy Trust ) .</detailed_description>
