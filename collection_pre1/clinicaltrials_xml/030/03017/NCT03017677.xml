	<brief_title>Mucopolysaccharidosis ( MPS ) Screening High-Risk Population With Previous Surgical Repair Presence Inguinal and/or Umbilical Hernia Combined With Pediatric ENT Surgery Bronchoscopy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Mucopolysaccharidoses ( MPS ) group inherit lysosomal storage disorder . In individual MPS disorder , deficiency malfunction specific lysosomal enzyme lead abnormal accumulation certain complex carbohydrate ( mucopolysaccharide glycosaminoglycans ) artery , skeleton , eye , joint , ear , skin , and/or teeth . These accumulation may also find respiratory system , liver , spleen , central nervous system , blood , bone marrow . This accumulation eventually cause progressive damage cell , tissue , various organ system body . Due extreme variability clinical presentation well wide range disease spectrum , insufficient MPS disease awareness Taiwan , result delay diagnosis even miss diagnosis clinical symptom thus patient often received inappropriate treatment . In order address current issue delay diagnosis among MPS patient , critical develop MPS screen algorithm high risk patient Taiwan .</detailed_description>
