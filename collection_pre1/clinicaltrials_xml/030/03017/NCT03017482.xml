	<brief_summary>The purpose project track initiation first year clinical use newly FDA approve 670G close loop insulin delivery system patient requested system . Our goal evaluate clinical approach start newly approve system . Since investigator follow patient already decide start 670G , investigator assign specific intervention subject study ; thus Observational study .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Clinical Startup 670G Closed Loop Insulin Delivery System</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>3.1 Initial Procedures After review patient 's interest eligibility , investigator obtain informed consent assent appropriate . The investigator start clinical process start insulin infusion pump . This typically involve attend pre-pump class ( patient naïve insulin pump therapy ) start process obtain insurance coverage 670G system . The investigator plan track insurance approval process , typically number call fax require , well result - approve v approve . 3.2 Pump Run-in ( patient new insulin infusion pump ) For patient insulin pump naïve investigator start 670G insulin pump without glucose sensor activation per exist clinical protocol . This may occur group visit . 3.3 Initial Visit During initial visit , follow procedure perform : - A clinically obtain HbA1c assessment , typically do via fingerstick DCA2000 ( equivalent NGSP-certified point-of-care laboratory base measurement within 2 week prior enrollment acceptable ) - Collection medical history information include - Demographics ( date birth , gender , race ethnicity ) , diabetes history , medical history , concomitant medication - Collect data diabetes device ( eg meter , sensor , pump ) - Brief clinical physical exam include vital sign skin assessment - CareLink account creation share access already do At visit , patient teach insert use system glucose sensor . 3.3.1 Initial Week 670G System During follow week , system ( pump sensor active ) active PLGS . 3.4 System Start Visit After initial PLGS week , patient teach , perhaps group , close loop system system activate . ( Note : multiple day system data require use pump sensor prior 670G system capable deliver additional insulin hyperglycemia . Therefore , stage start-up function system requirement . ) 3.5 Weekly CareLink Download Calls For next four week , patient/family upload data CareLink system data review member clinical team . Adjustments system setting suggest family clinically appropriate . 3.6 Routine 3 , 6 , 9 12 Month Clinical visit At routine clinical visit investigator obtain interval medical history , physical examination , collect review diabetes management data diabetes device eye towards improve glycemic control . The investigator collect adverse event information regard severe hypoglycemia diabetic ketoacidosis . Patients advise suggest change pump setting</detailed_description>
