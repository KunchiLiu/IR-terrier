	<brief_summary>D²EFT randomise , open-label study HIV-1 infect patient fail first-line antiretroviral therapy ( ART ) . The study compare novel regimen second-line ART ( dolutegravir darunavir pharmaco-enhanced ritonavir ) WHO recommend regimen 2NRTIs plus ritonavir-boosted PI ( Standard Care ( SOC ) ) . 610 participant 10 predominantly low-middle income country follow 96 week primary endpoint week 48 . The design base hypothesis new regimen non-inferior SOC term virologic control easy take , economically viable afford simplification treatment program .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Consenting participant screen within 45 day randomly allocate receive either dolutegravir darunavir/ritonavir SOC regimen . Participants see four week randomisation ( week 0 ) visit week 24 , 48 96 . Consenting participant storage sample collect cryopreserved week 0 , 48 &amp; 96 visit . This repository use future central baseline resistance testing , pharmacogenomic testing ( separate consent require ) inherent value later study HIV pathogenesis . A 1-time PK sample collect week four future test participant fail therapy 24 week plasma sample store future genotypic resistance test . A number secondary outcomes consider order compare performance two study treatment regimen . Secondary analysis focus virological , immunological , safety , antiretroviral treatment change medication adherence . A comparison cost estimate cost-effectiveness randomised comparison critical component study . ART cost assess across study arm . Health-care utilisation self-reported used estimate cost . Safety data , viral load quality life data also analyse . The open label nature study allow routine care undertake use objective endpoint limit potential bias . The study well define integrate clinical data collection patient management system show effective wide range clinical setting . The choice NRTIs SoC regimen base clinical judgement may guide resistance test locally available . The NRTIs provide via study . A 3 year supply DTG DRV/r donate available participant study . Provision DTG DRV/r via study mandate composition post-study ART regimen . At end 96 week ( completion protocol ) composition regimen clinician 's decision , possibly influence anticipate study result .</detailed_description>
