	<brief_summary>The purpose study monitor change brain structure function pre-training post-training , population tactical team member wear Device compare similar population wear device . Secondly , purpose determine protection device relative amount magnitude sustain head impact .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Novel Protection Against Potential Brain , Hearing Vision Injury During Blast Wave Exposure</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This study investigate effectiveness device tactical team member expose blast wave tactical training . Subjects participate study randomly assign one two group : 1 ) Device wear tactical training 2 ) Non-device wear tactical training . The helmet participant outfit accelerometer measure magnitude every concussive blast wave sustain subject . Effectiveness device determine via difference brain MRI EEG , vision hearing test prior follow standardize breach diversionary device scenario training .</detailed_description>
