	<detailed_description>Introduction : In course ageing , physical ability decline consequently increase risk fall fall incidence . Notwithstanding , fact cause fall multifactorial , loss lower-extremity muscle strength , power balance seem prominent intrinsic ( i.e. , person-related ) fall risk factor older adult . Several systematic review meta-analyses highlight positive effect resistance balance training apply single mean , measure leg muscle strength , power balance old adult . Recently , show simultaneously execute balance resistance training , namely resistance training uneven surface eligible , effective safe alternative training program mitigate intrinsic fall risk factor older adult . Based several investigation , safely assume exercise conduct unstable device activate small muscle stabilise function big muscle group . This facilitate torque power transfer low upper extremeties possibly responsible similar effect compare stable resistance training despite low load . However , unknown resistance training target adductor abductor muscle induces similar result compare resistance training conduct uneven surface . Moreover , physical activity proven affect cognitive measure positively , especially executive function . It yet determine extent different kind resistance training affect executive function . Methods/Design : This study three-arm , 10-week RCT 10-week no-contact follow-up . Participants randomly allocate ( 1:1 ) either : 1 ) machine-based stable resistance training ( M-SRT ) ; 2 ) free-weight unstable resistance training ( F-URT ) ; 3 ) machine-based adductor abductor resistance training . The design reporting study follow CONSORT ( Consolidated Standards Reporting Trials ) 2010 Statement parallel group randomise trial . Setting Participants recruited community around Kassel , Germany . Screening visit , measurement session , intervention hold Insitute Sports Sports Science / University Kassel , Germany . Recruitment strategy : Recruitment carry place 1 ) advertisement local newspaper , 2 ) public information meeting local town hall 3 ) word mouth . Interested individual contact study coordinator phone , provide brief description study . If response suggest study eligibility interested individual invite attend formal in-person screen visit . Participants : Older adult eligible : 1 ) age 65 80 year old 2 ) able walk independently 10m . An priori power analysis use G*Power 3.1 assume type I error .05 type II error .10 ( 90 % statistical power , correlation among group : .5 , nonsphericity correction : 1 ) compute determine appropriate sample size detect medium ( .50 ≤ ≤ .79 ) interaction effect . The calculation base study assess effect core strength training use unstable device old adult . The analysis reveal requirement 54 participant ( 18 per group ) obtain medium `` time x group '' interaction effect . Considering likelihood dropout , least 83 participant go recruited compensate possible dropout rate ~20 % . Interventions : All intervention group train ten week , twice per week non-consecutive day 60 minute . The 10-week intervention period consist one week introductory phase three major train block last three week . Training intensity progressively individually increase 10-week training program modulate load set group level instability F-URT . After week one ( 50 % ) , four ( 60 % ) , seven ( 70 % ) training load ( weight ) increase follow one repetition maximum ( 1-RM ) test major exercise . M-SRT followes 'traditional ' machine-based stable resistance training program , include squat smith-machine leg press . F-URT conduct squat front lunge unstable device . M-ART us adductor abductor strength training machine . All three intervention group conduct resistance training program consist two main exercise , preparation cool-down phase . Participants perform ten minute low-intensity step stair-walker brief warm-up begin training session , follow resistance exercise walk treadmill cool-down . Training unstable surface condition , especially additional weight , implies certain degree accident risk . Due factor , instability exercise observe instructor secure additional aid like box . Training supervise skilled instructor time . For first two week participant instructor ratio 5:1 , thereafter 10:1 . Outcome assessment : Outcomes measure baseline , 10 week ( intervention endpoint ) 20 week ( study endpoint ) . Measurement session conduct one day . Baseline data : Baseline measurement obtain prior randomisation . In addition measurement describe , follow also collect : demographic general health characteristic ; medical history medication ; anthropometrics rate fall / near fall .</detailed_description>
