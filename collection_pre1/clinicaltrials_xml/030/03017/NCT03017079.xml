	<brief_summary>Malnutrition underfeeding major challenge care critically ill patient . Continuous feed think well tolerate patient limited absorptive gut surface area gastrointestinal dysfunction , associate tube clog require patient attach infusion pump significant period time . Intermittent infusion resemble physiological feeding process , allow great patient mobility might reach goal enteral calorie earlier , latter consider effectively decrease length stay ( LOS ) -in-hospital mortality . However , also previous study find intermittent infusion complication , diarrhea , regurgitation continuous . Some study find efficient way prevent aspiration reflux increase enteral nutrient solution viscosity improve bolus intermittent feeding intolerance . The primary goal study whether receive semi-solidification nutrient could increase percent prescribed calorie receive improve feed intolerance , secondary goal observe effect semi-solid nutrient LOS ICU in-hospital , lung infection , 30-days mortality glycemic variability ( GV ) .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A More Physiological Feeding Process ICU : Intermittent Infusion With Semi-solidification Nutrients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Enteral nutrition ( EN ) therapy essential part critically ill patientsï¼Œand administer continuous intermittent , consensus adopt . Continuous feed think well tolerate patient limited absorptive gut surface area gastrointestinal dysfunction , associate tube clog require patient attach infusion pump significant period time . Intermittent infusion resemble physiological feeding process , allow great patient mobility might reach goal enteral calorie earlier , latter consider effectively decrease LOS-in-hospital mortality . However , also previous study find intermittent infusion complication , diarrhea , regurgitation continuous . Recently , study find efficient way prevent aspiration reflux increase enteral nutrient solution viscosity improve bolus intermittent feeding intolerance . In dementia Parkinson 's patient , one study show high-viscosity liquid meal could decrease incidence aspiration , compare thin liquid , study viscosity nutrition little sample size small . In study , primary goal study whether receive semi-solidification nutrient could increase percent prescribed calorie receive improve feed intolerance , secondary goal observe effect semi-solid nutrient LOS ICU in-hospital , lung infection , 30-days mortality glycemic variability ( GV ) .</detailed_description>
