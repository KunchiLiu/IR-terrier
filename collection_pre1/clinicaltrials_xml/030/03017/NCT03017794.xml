	<brief_summary>This pilot study test hypothesis great increase serum chromogranin A ( CgA ) definitive radiotherapy ( RT ) without androgen deprivation therapy ( ADT ) associate high risk prostate cancer recurrence RT . Serum CgA level measure start RT and/or start neoadjuvant ADT patient undergo definitive RT without ADT . CgA also measure various pre-defined post-RT time point . The study analyze following : 1 . Change CgA level various pre-defined post-RT time point baseline , 2 . Correlation extent post-therapy CgA change Gleason score malignancy , 3 . Correlation extent post-therapy CgA change treatment outcome .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Evaluation Neuroendocrine Differentiation Potential Mechanism Tumor Recurrence Following Radiotherapy Prostate Carcinoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Neuroendocrine differentiation ( NED ) prostate cancer well-recognized phenotypic change prostate cancer cell transdifferentiate neuroendocrine-like ( NE-like ) cell . Accumulated evidence suggest prevalence NE-like cell associated disease progression poor prognosis . NED induce therapeutic agent . Such therapeutic agent include RT ADT . RT-induced NED represent novel pathway prostate cancer cell survive radiotherapy contribute treatment failure tumor recurrence . Chromogranin A serum biomarker NED correlate well CgA-positive stain biopsy specimen . It report elevated serum CgA associate poor therapeutic response , androgen-independent growth , biochemical recurrence . The study test whether extent serum CgA increase RT +/- ADT , reflect radiation-induced NED , correlate risk prostate cancer recurrence follow RT Gleason score prostate carcinoma .</detailed_description>
