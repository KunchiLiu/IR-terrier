	<brief_summary>The phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase ( PI3K ) -v-akt murine thymoma viral oncogene homolog ( AKT ) -mammalian target rapamycin ( mTOR ) signal pathway one frequently aberrantly regulate pathway human tumor . TAS-117 highly potent selective oral allosteric AKT inhibitor . It high affinity AKT1 , 2 , 3 show potent anti-proliferative activity multiple tumor cell line vivo . Therefore , propose conduct phase II trial TAS-117 , potent selective AKT inhibitor , patient advance solid tumor PI3K/AKT genetic aberrancy NGS focus panel part K-BASKET trial .</brief_summary>
