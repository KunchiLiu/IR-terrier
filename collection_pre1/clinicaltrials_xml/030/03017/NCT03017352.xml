	<brief_summary>Patients type 1 diabetes ( T1D ) depend insulin therapy substitution lack endocrine insulin production due autoimmune destruction beta-cells pancreatic inslets . Insulin therapy base long lasting basal insulin control fast plasma glucose , short lasting mealtime insulin postprandial plasma glucose . The long term efficacy treatment measure glycated haemoglobin A1c ( HbA1c ) &lt; 7.0 % treatment goal . Intensive insulin therapy associate side effect hypoglycaemia , weight gain , unwanted exaggerated excursion PPG . This may ultimately affect treatment compliance . The abovementioned problem associate insulin treatment T1D also see insulin-treated patient type 2 diabetes ( T2D ) . However , T2D combination insulin glucagon-like peptide-1 ( GLP-1 ) receptor agonist ( RA ) proven effective reduce weight gain insulin dose insulin-treated patient T2D without exacerbate risk hypoglycaemia . Exenatid short last GLP-1RA approve treatment T2D , investigator intend evaluate randomize , control trial add-on therapy standard insulin therapy patient T1D . The investigator hypothesise add-on exenatide insulin therapy patient T1D reduce insulin requirement , glycaemic excursion body weight improve glycaemic control without increase risk hypoglycaemia .</brief_summary>
