	<detailed_description>Two dose level test : Recombinant Anti-EGFr Antibody Low-dose level patient receive initial dose 100 mg/m2 4 week later 250 mg/m2 weekly maintenance disease progression unacceptable toxicity death withdraw inform consent.High-dose level patient receive cetuximab initial dose 400 mg/m2 4 week later load 400 mg/m2 250 mg/m2 weekly maintenance disease progression unacceptable toxicity death withdraw inform consent . Dose limit toxicity ( DLT ) define : grade 4 3-time grade 3 cutaneous toxicity , successive 3-time infusion suspension due grade 3 cutaneous toxicity , ≥grade 3 adverse reaction acute pneumonia , interstitial pneumonia , lung disease . Cohorts 3 patient receive single dose low-dose group Recombinant Anti-EGFr Antibody . If ratio dose limit toxicity ( DLT ) single dose third , high-dose group treated.After high-dose ( initial dose 400 mg/m2 , iv. , 2 h ) , safety observe blood sample take single dose pharmacokinetic analysis.After 4-week continuous administration ( load dose 400 mg/m2 , iv. , 2 h ; maintenance dose 250 mg/m2 , iv , 1 h , q1w ) disease progression , unacceptable toxicity reaction , death revocation inform consent.As blood concentration reach steady state , blood sample collect steady-state pharmacokinetic analysis , 1 week.After completion steady-state pharmacokinetics , patient receive chemotherapy , safety ( include immunogenicity ) curative effect observe .</detailed_description>
