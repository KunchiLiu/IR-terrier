	<detailed_description>Articular involvement frequent extra-intestinal manifestation inflammatory bowel disease ( IBD ) , frequently follow course independent course intestinal involvement , diagnosis mainly rely clinical evidence image data , laboratory assessment rarely useful . More detail , IBD-related arthropathy one group inflammatory arthritides , know seronegative spondyloarthropathies , also include idiopathic ankylose spondylitis , reactive arthritis , psoriatic arthritis , undifferentiated seronegative spondyloarthropathies , classify basis peripheral arthritis ( asymmetrical , predominantly low extremity ) and/or inflammatory spinal involvement IBD patient use well-known criterion European Spondyloarthropathy Study Group . IBD-related spondyloarthropathy mainly characterise axial involvement ( include inflammatory back pain , isolate sacroiliitis ankylose spondylitis ) may also associate peripheral symptom ( i.e peripheral arthritis , dactylitis enthesopathy , Achilles tendinitis , plantar fasciitis , chest wall pain ) . In particular , inflammatory back pain ( IBP ) characterise insidious onset , improve exercise rest , associate morning stiffness . It may also present pain second half night and/or alternate buttock pain . Up , several criterion set propose define IBP . Firstly , Calin criterion set developed 1977 since widely use define IBP . The Calin criterion set entry criterion base standardized question . Studies conduct various population confirm high sensitivity Calin criterion , show much low specificity report original study . Berlin criterion IBP derive control study , include patient ankylose spondylitis mechanical low back pain , chronic low back pain . Berlin criterion applicable patient chronic low back pain ( &gt; 3 month ) age young &lt; 50 year old . This criterion set yield sensitivity 70 % specificity 81 % least two four follow criterion meet : morning stiffness &gt; 30-min duration , improvement back pain exercise rest , awaken back pain second half night , alternate buttock pain . Assessment Spondyloarthritis International Society ( ASAS ) recently publish new criterion classification IBP . These base expert judgment rheumatologist `` gold standard '' diagnose IBP patient chronic back pain unknown origin . These new candidate IBP criterion administer interview clinician include domains `` improvement exercise , '' `` nocturnal pain , '' `` age onset &lt; 40 year , '' `` improvement rest . '' They validate distinct cohort patient present rheumatologist new-onset back pain show sensitivity 79.6 % specificity 72.4 % . Celiac disease ( CD ) autoimmune systemic disease among clinical manifestation frequent symptom common rheumatologic disease , musculoskeletal pain , asthenia , cognitive fatigue . Recently , report consistent percentage general population consider suffer problem cause wheat and/or gluten ingestion , even though CD wheat allergy . This clinical condition name Non-Celiac Gluten Sensitivity ' ( NCGS ) . In previous paper investigator suggest term 'Non-Celiac Wheat Sensitivity ' ( NCWS ) , since know component wheat cause symptom NCGS patient , investigator also show patient high frequency coexistent multiple food hypersensitivity . The clinical picture NCWS characterize combined gastrointestinal ( bloat , abdominal pain , diarrhea and/or constipation , nausea , epigastric pain , gastroesophageal reflux , aphthous stomatitis ) extra-intestinal systemic manifestation ( headache , depression , anxiety , 'foggy mind , ' tiredness , dermatitis skin rash , fibromyalgia-like joint/muscle pain , leg arm numbness , anemia ) . NCWS lack specific diagnostic test , diagnosis essentially exclusion . Many patient affected CD NCWS complain IBP-like symptom , significantly affect patient ' quality life generally improve , together clinical manifestation disease , gluten-free diet ( GFD ) . Therefore , aim present study investigate 1 ) effect GFD IBP patient , randomly assign receive standard therapy IBP standard therapy IBP plus GFD , period least one year , 2 ) prevalence IBP CD NCWS patient .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>To diagnose IBP standard Berlin Criteria adopt . IBP define least 2 positive response among four item : morning stiffness &gt; 30 min duration improvement back pain exercise rest awaken back pain second half night alternate buttock pain . To diagnose CD standard criterion adopt . All patient meet follow criterion : positive serum antitransglutaminase ( antitTG ) antiendomysium ( EmA ) immunoglobulin ( Ig ) A IgG antibodies presence intestinal villous atrophy . To diagnose NCWS recently propose criterion adopt . All patient meet follow criterion : negative serum antitransglutaminase ( antitTG ) antiendomysium ( EmA ) immunoglobulin ( Ig ) A IgG antibodies absence intestinal villous atrophy negative IgEmediated immuneallergy test wheat ( skin prick test and/or serum specific IgE detection ) resolution IBS symptoms standard elimination diet , exclude wheat , cow 's milk , egg , tomato , chocolate , selfreported food ( ) causing symptom symptom reappearance doubleblind placebocontrolled ( DBPC ) wheat challenge . As investigator previously describe study , DBPC cow 's milk protein challenge `` open '' food challenge perform . Exclusion criterion NCWS diagnosis : positive EmA culture medium duodenal biopsy , also case normal villi/crypts ratio duodenal mucosa selfexclusion wheat diet refusal reintroduce enter study previously diagnose gastrointestinal disorder previously diagnose rheumatic disease nervous system disease and/or major psychiatric disorder physical impairment limit physical activity .</criteria>
