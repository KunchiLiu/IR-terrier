	<brief_summary>Prostate Cancer Survivorship 360ยบ collaboration-based initiative involve prostate cancer ( PC ) survivorship researchers/clinicians three Canadian prostate center goal identify track unmet supportive care need patient localized PC respond need survivorship care . The current randomize control trail ( RCT ) focus development evaluation facilitate electronic Prostate Cancer Survivorship Care Plan ( PC-SCP ) . The aim project : 1 ) develop appropriate tailor SCP transition care delivery process ; 2 ) conduct RCT evaluate whether personalized PC SCP intervention effective usual care ( UC ) patient activation ( primary outcome ) access service , self-Management support , satisfaction information , HRQoL cancer worry ( secondary outcome ) . Data multi-site prospective database- Prostate Cancer Survivorship Information System ( PC360-IS ) use electronically populate survivorship care plan . Overall , proposal represent initial step uniting country share programmatic resource , data , expertise , enthusiasm transform survivorship care men PC family .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>A Phase III RCT evaluate superiority Survivorship Care Plan ( SCP ) intervention ( SCP-Int ) compare usual care ( UC ) primary curative prostate cancer ( PC ) treatment . Each three site designate clinical study lead ( AM , LG , ST ) , high referral volume study lead ' patient enter PC360-IS database interfaced PC-SCP system consolidate patient detail generate personalize SCPs . Research ethic approval obtain site . The trial register clinicaltrials.gov report use CONSORT recommendation trial . The study population inclusion criterion follow : Histologically confirm localize ( T1-T3N0M0 ) PC ; age diagnosis &gt; 18 year ; treat curative intent ; treatment receive &gt; 1 month &lt; 6 month ; disease-free define absence somatic disease activity parameter per oncologist/urologist ; consent participate PC360-IS database . Exclusion Criteria : Patients receive treatment follow active surveillance ; inability complete study questionnaire . Eligible patient randomly assign either intervention arm control arm . A biostatistician randomly assign participant ensure study RA participant unaware treatment ( SCP-int ) /control group ( UC ) . Consenting patient register study randomize receive either SCP-Int UC . Patients SCP-Int arm schedule SCP-Int appointment day patient 's first ( second ) follow-up appointment . Eligible patient send study information letter sign patient 's urologist/ oncologist one month end primary treatment . The RA contact patient explain study . If agreeable , patient send consent form , two stamp envelope , baseline questionnaire complete prior schedule follow-up appointment . The patient ask mail back sign consent form complete questionnaire envelope provide . Participants much time need decide participant would like participate study prior sign consent form . The Research Analyst obtain consent . Planned trial intervention : SCP-Int : Patients SCP-Int arm ask attend one-time appointment train oncology nurse ( study nurse ) . To avoid additional travel related cost patient , appointment schedule day patient 's follow-up appointment . The SCP-Int comprised two component : 30-minute nurse-led face-to-face intervention provision tailor PC-specific SCP ( PC-SCP ) . The intervention develop base establish person-centred nursing framework tailor approach customize intervention individual focus provision self-management education support promote access coordination post-treatment care include appropriate referral relevant program service ( include TrueNTH solution ) . The content PC-SCP provide structure appointment . Persistent effect concern identify prompt development tailor management plan ( i.e . patient education , referral program service ) capture within PC-SCP . Relevant patient education TrueNTH material link electronically . The appointment focus empower PC survivor actively self-manage persistent treatment effect decrease patient ' risk late effect provide effective health information , support , self-management support . Nurses integrate number `` active behaviour change ingredient '' include integration motivational interviewing technique effective increase healthy behaviour . Usual Care ( UC ) : Patients UC arm receive care accord usual practice . This usually involve brief office visit ( approximately 5-10 minute ) pertinent history physical examination relate surgical/radiation recovery , review pathology general instruction regard next step follow-up . In addition , patient UC arm able access supportive care program service available hospital accord usual practice . Currently , SCPs dedicate transition appointment provide part standard care . Allocation trial group : Patients allocate either SCP-Int UC Department Biostatistics Princess Margaret use computer-generated randomization process ( random block know statistician ) . The research coordinator telephone Biostatistics staff , involve recruitment , obtain subject 's assignment . Eligible patient site approach target number participant reach ( decision make stop recruitment ) . Data collection : Data collect analyzed accord outline project aim . Based CONSORT criterion , screen log enable data collection eligible non-recruited patient reason non-recruitment record know . All data enter secure , password protect database within UHN server . A separate database use participant track prevent re-approaching patient unnecessarily , ensure patient receive questionnaire package accord study timeline . Proposed primary secondary outcome measure : The outcome measure choose base recent consensus recommendation evaluation SCPs . Patients assessed baseline ( T0 ) , 6 ( T1 ) , 12 ( T2 ) month post-treatment . This questionnaire package estimate take 45 minute complete . Primary Outcome : Patient activation measure use Patient Activation Measure ( PAM-13 ) , 13-items measure assess knowledge , skill , belief , confidence manage health health care . Patient activation strongly relate broad range health-related outcome . The primary outcome overall score 13 item collect T2 . Secondary Outcomes : ) Supportive care service utilization : use Health Social Services Utilization Inventory ( HSSUI ) modify use cancer population . Service type group five category : Health Professionals , Institutional/Hospital Programs ; Nursing Homemaker Support Programs ; Other Community Social Support Program/Resources ( include True NTH solution ) ; Programs/Resources . ; b ) Self-Management Support assess use Health Education Impact Questionnaire ( heiQ ) , design evaluate outcome patient education self-management intervention people chronic condition ; c ) Satisfaction Information measure 25-item European Organisation Research Treatment Cancer Quality Life INFO25 module evaluate satisfaction information receive cancer patient ; ) Quality Life measure use Expanded Prostate Cancer Index Composite ( EPIC ) assess PC-specific quality life , e ) Cancer Worry measure use Assessment Survivors Concerns ( ASC ) measure assess fear recurrence health cancer survivor . Proposed sample size justification : Our sample size calculation base 85 % power alpha-level 0.05 , standard deviation 16 difference group 8 point primary outcome ( half standard deviation difference ) . Given specification , require sample size 146 patient ( 73 patient per arm ) . Assuming attrition 20 % , 180 patient recruit ( 90 patient per arm ) . Based previous study , expect enroll 70 % eligible patient . The number potentially eligible patient participate site estimate vary 15-30 patient per month . Based estimate anticipated participation rate , anticipate recruit 20 patient per month total recruitment complete within 9 month . We anticipate least 80 % complete 12-month post-treatment follow-up . We use multiple strategy promote retention prevent attrition . Reasons participant attrition document . Proposed analysis : Analyses perform adhere intention treat principle . Descriptive statistic use summarize baseline demographic clinical characteristic participant group . Recruitment bias possible differential attrition assess calculate standardized difference two arm . The overall PAM-13 score 12 month adjust baseline score compare two arm use t-test data appear normal Mann-Whitney test otherwise . A p-value &lt; =0.05 deem significant . Secondary analysis score time point conduct utilizing mixed effect model account intra-patient intra-centre dependency due repeat measure within patient multi-centre design . The residual inspect data transform necessary . Due multiple test secondary analysis Hochberg-Benjamini approach use ensure type I error rate exceed 0.05 . Cost-utility analysis : The analysis also include trial-based cost utility analysis . The health utility measure use PORPUS-U EQ-5D instrument use provide patient-specific group-mean estimate quality-adjusted survival ( Quality Adjusted Life Years ) . Costs payer perspective societal perspective gather use HSSUI estimate intervention cost . Inverse probability weight use adjust induce dependent censoring . A net benefit regression approach employ explore predictor cost-effectiveness .</detailed_description>
