	<brief_summary>The goal prospective , non‐randomized , multicenter clinical trial determine whether robotic‐assisted total knee arthroplasty perform TSolution One® System safe effective use alternative conventional manual technique . Clinical radiographic outcome robotic‐assisted total knee arthroplasty perform TSolution One® System collect preoperatively , intraoperatively , postoperatively follow‐up period 3 month . These outcome compare one report literature conventional manual technique .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>TSolution One® Total Knee Arthroplasty</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This clinical investigation conduct prospective , non‐randomized , multicenter study . The primary objective study demonstrate TSolution One® System safe use alternative manual planning sawing/cutting technique base rate intra-operative postoperative TKA complication follow-up period 3 month , compare rate rate report literature . The secondary objective study demonstrate TSolution One® System effective use alternative conventional manual technique compare rate malalignment mechanical axis great 3° rate report literature ( i.e . 32 % ) ; summarize distribution improvement patient ' self-reported assessment postoperative function quality-of-life baseline 3 month . Additionally , preoperative planning alignment goal ( i.e . Knee V‐V Alignment ; Hip‐Knee Angle Coronal Plane ; Femoral Joint Line Alignment Angle ; Tibial Joint Line Alignment Angle ; Tibial Slope Angle ) compare post‐operative alignment . Investigators recruit subject patient practice require unilateral total knee arthroplasty . Patients screen identify eligible candidate base inclusion exclusion criterion . A total one hundred fifteen ( 115 ) patient enrol study across participate site . All patient sign inform consent form prior participate study . Prior undergoing investigational procedure , patient complete baseline survey function quality life ( Knee Society Score survey SF‐12 Health Survey ) baseline radiograph CT scan knee . Each patient undergo robotic‐assisted total knee arthroplasty TSolution One® System . The investigator evaluate intra‐ postoperative complication . Postoperative radiograph CT scan use measure limb alignment use standardized radiographic evaluation protocol . Each patient complete postoperative Knee Society Score survey SF‐12 Health Survey assess functional outcome quality‐of‐life follow investigational procedure .</detailed_description>
