	<brief_summary>CAR-T therapy therefore propose recently use cancer treatment . It hail promising remission rate early stage clinical trial acute lymphoblastic leukemia . However , CAR-T therapy seldom use autoimmune disease . Researchers use treatment multiple sclerosis ( MS , autoimmune disease central nervous system ) . SLE kind autoimmune diseases involve multiple system , organ present variety autoantibody . In conventional treatment option , SLE could treat chemotherapy drug hormone drug . But chemotherapy hormone drug could barely cure SLE . And , chimeric antigen receptor modify T cell infusion maybe effective treatment solve problem . The investigator use 2nd CAR- T optimize hinge transmembrane domain treat patient SLE . The purpose study assess safety efficacy 2nd CAR-T cell treatment SLE .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Study CD19 Redirected Autologous T Cells CD19 Positive Systemic Lupus Erythematosus ( SLE )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This study conduct assess anti-CD19-CAR-T cell safety efficacy treat patient systemic lupus erythematosus（SLE）.The investigator construct 2nd CAR , use CD19 target , use 4-1BB co-stimulator , optimize spatial conformation suitable hinge transmembrane domain sequence . The infusion dose ( 1-10 ) E6 CAR positive T cells/kg , specific cell number depend situation individual CAR-T cell preparation .</detailed_description>
