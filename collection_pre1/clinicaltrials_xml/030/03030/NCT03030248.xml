	<brief_summary>There good evidence randomize C. difficile NAAT ( + ) , toxin ( - ) patient non-treatment represent ethically tolerable risk-benefit , even cancer patient hematopoetic stem cell transplant ( HSCT ) recipient . Actually , detection free toxin stool standard care diagnosis C. difficile infection ( CDI ) 1983 2010 . Since , NAAT become standard diagnostic test 60 % US hospital ( National Healthcare Safety Network , unpublished data ) . However , grow evidence symptomatic patient NAAT ( + ) , toxin ( - ) outcomes similar patient NAAT ( - ) , toxin ( - ) ; outcome include 30-day mortality , ICU admission , hospital readmission trigger C. difficile . Furthermore , United Kingdom successfully use similar two step diagnostic algorithm confirmatory toxin EIA since 2012 . The adverse health consequence result antibiotic overtreatment NAAT ( + ) , toxin ( - ) patient may particularly important transplant recipient . The usual treatment prescribe CDI Froedtert Memorial Lutheran Hospital oral vancomycin . While drug excellent activity C. difficile commonly suppress growth non-detection , eradicate carriage use result mark prolonged disruption lower intestinal microbiota . Meanwhile , degree low intestinal microbiota disruption time HSCT engraftment demonstrate independent predictor ( control marker underlie disease ) overall transplant-related 3-year mortality.14 In addition , recent finding suggest bone marrow suppressive effect antibiotic , case potentially unnecessary oral vancomycin ( appreciably absorb ) , may solely mediate via microbiota disruption . All data support notion antibiotic treatment NAAT ( + ) , toxin ( - ) C. difficile patient might significant negative repercussion without clear clinical benefit .</brief_summary>
