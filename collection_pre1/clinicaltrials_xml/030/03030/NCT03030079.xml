	<brief_summary>The goal pilot study ass effectiveness electrical stimulation therapy option treatment chronic phantom limb pain upper-limb amputee . This therapy previously use sport joint injury market relaxation muscle spasm , re-education muscle action , prevention disuse atrophy , increase local blood circulation , maintain increase range motion . The investigator would like explore idea physically exercise muscle residual limb increase blood flow site amputation promotion motor contraction use electrical stimulation decrease chronic phantom limb pain .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Electrical Stimulus Therapy Chronic Phantom Limb Pain</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>There large number people live amputation due mainly cardiovascular disease , diabetes , trauma ; evidence show 80 % amputee experience phantom limb pain ( PLP ) . PLP classify cramping , burning , shoot , stab pain miss limb follow amputation . Current treatment include pharmacological drug , anesthesia , additional surgery , mirror therapy , transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation ( TENS ) others . TENS , usually implement , use effectively reduce pain multiple spot body , show little effect reduce phantom limb pain especially long term even vary frequency intensity electrical stimulation . These current treatment invasive , costly , show offer immediate relief . Using electrical stimulator high intensity proven reduce pain increase heal numerous sport joint relate injury . Anecdotally , investigator learn similar treatment protocol apply person phantom limb pain mitigate pain . The goal pilot study ass effectiveness high intensity electrical stimulation management PLP also acquire data inform investigator appropriate study design power future formal clinical trial . To accomplish investigator utilize ACP Omnistim FX2 Pro electrical stimulator , provide u ACP- Accelerated Care Plus Corporation , physically exercise muscle residual limb hence increase local blood flow explore 's potential treatment PLP short long term . The self-identified subject hook ACP electrical stimulator use surface electrode pass current skin first low intensity 5 minute allow subject adjust tingle sensation . The current gradually increase level sufficient elicit non-painful motor contraction 15 minute . Using numerical pain scale short answer question characteristic pain investigator track short term long term change pain .</detailed_description>
