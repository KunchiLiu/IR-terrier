	<brief_summary>The international literature emphasize vast benefit effective implementation evidence base nursing recommendation improve patient care process enhance health outcome . The key role nurse prevention , treatment care incontinence highlight . Studies show UI neglect nurse care problem Austria e.g . regard diagnosis nursing intervention . Nursing recommendation may enhance frequency diagnosis , use nursing intervention well decrease frequency daily UI nursing home resident . Beside little known nursing recommendation implementation regard urinary incontinence nursing home setting , especially Austrian context . The aim study measure effectiveness implementation evidence base nursing recommendation regard UI Austrian nursing home .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>P-INC : Project Incontinence- Effectiveness Nursing Recommendations</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The aim study measure effectiveness implementation evidence base nursing recommendation regard UI Austrian nursing home , include three research question : 1 . What statistical difference frequency document categorisation UI ( UI diagnosis ) intervention group ( implementation nursing recommendation ) compare control group ( standard care ) ? 2 . What statistical difference amount use nursing intervention intervention group compare control group ? 3 . What statistical difference frequency daily UI nursing home resident intervention group compare control group ? 5 . Methods 5.1 . Design A three-month cluster-randomized trial conduct nursing home Styria Carinthia . 5.2 . Setting All nursing home Styria Carinthia capacity ≥ 50 bed register national database [ 15 ] invite participate mean information flyer email . With regard practicability invitation start nurse home high number bed . 5.3 . Sample Currently 176 nursing home Styria Carinthia capacity ≥ 50 bed register national database total 15208 nursing home resident . Through experience former project low response rate expect . We assume response rate 2 % nursing home level , amount 3 participate nursing home 259 resident . Nursing home want participate voluntarily contact via telephone start large inclusion criterion . Inclusion criterion nurse home resident live nursing home date baseline measurement female assume stay whole duration study ( 3 month ) . Written informed consent participate resident legal representative require . The nursing intervention make woman , focus sample woman . In Austrian nursing home 70 % women.Which mean total 181 female nursing home resident ask participation . We know former study 90 % nursing home resident able willing participate research study , amount expect total 163 participant 3 remain nursing home . We assume 10 % resident drop study period . Therefore 147 female resident 3 nursing home basis calculation . These 3 nursing home randomly assign ( eg . via `` Randomizer '' ) intervention group control group . An Intra Class Coefficient ( ICC ) 0.05 assumed literature . With `` Sample Size Calculator '' develop Campbell et al . ( 2004 ) detectable difference fix sample size calculate . With expect cluster size 49 nursing home resident 3 cluster power 80 % significance level 0.05 expect minimum decrease frequency daily UI 90 % 55 % . 6.0 Ethical consideration This study conduct line declaration Helsinki `` Good scientific practice '' Medical University Graz . Nursing home withdraw participation without state reason via telephone email . Informed consent obtain participate resident . Residents withdraw anytime study without state reason . The questionnaire base routine nursing care intervention data regard UI . Therefore risk side effect participate resident expect . Nursing home control group receive nursing recommendation three month study period . In study data collect . Therefore names resident trace . 7.0 Data collection include instrument Baseline measurement : The baseline measurement conduct gather data resident level ( Table 1 ) . Table 1 : Collected baseline data include time Collected data Collection time Purpose - Participation Baseline - Age Baseline Comparing resident - Diagnosis Dementia Baseline Comparing resident - Care dependency Baseline/6weeks/month Comparing resident - Continence status Baseline/6weeks/month Comparing resident The questionnaire resident 's level base questionnaire `` Pflegequalitätserhebung 2.0 '' , Austrian questionnaire `` International Prevalence Measurement Care Problems '' research project . The Institute Nursing Science Medical University Graz member research project . Questions concern continence status include presence , use catheter , star point , frequency , diagnosis urinary incontinence use nursing intervention management urinary incontinence . The German version Care Dependency Scale ( CDS ) use measure degree care dependency reference different need mobility continence , low score refer high level care dependency . The CDS sum score resident range completely care dependent ( 15-24 point ) , great extent care dependent ( 25-44 point ) , partially care dependent ( 45-59 point ) , limited extent care independent ( 60-69 point ) almost care independent ( 70-75 point ) . Outcome measurement Table 2 show collect outcome data , collection time purpose . Again Austrian version standardize test `` International Prevalence Measurement Care Problems '' use collect data key outcome , i.e . UI frequency diagnosis . Table 2 : Collected outcome data include time purpose Collection time Purpose Frequency UI Baseline/6 weeks/3 month Intervention effect Diagnosis UI Baseline/6 weeks/3 month Intervention effect Use nursing intervention Baseline/6 weeks/3 month Intervention effect 8.0 Data analysis Data analysis via SPSS ( Version 23 high ) perform consultation Institute Medical Informatics , Statistics Documentation Medical University Graz , Austria , use descriptive statistic mixed model analysis . According Sedgwick ( 2015 ) Shah ( 2011 ) analysis conduct follow `` per protocol '' well `` intention treat '' analysis . The `` per protocol '' analysis show effectiveness study condition `` intention treat '' show effect nursing recommendation real life nursing practice .</detailed_description>
