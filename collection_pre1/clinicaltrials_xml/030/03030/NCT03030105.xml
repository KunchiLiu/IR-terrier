	<brief_title>Study Evaluate Effects BPN14770 Scopolamine-induced Cognitive Impairment Healthy Volunteers</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>A total 38 subject enrol study . The study duration 12 week 6 week single-dose Treatment Visits . The study consist Screening Visit ( 28 day prior first study drug administration ) , six inpatient Treatment Visits ( Periods 1 6 ) , Follow-Up/Early Termination Visit ( 7-10 day last dose study medication ) . An additional study visit may necessary complete require cognitive test familiarization complete Screening Visit . Each Treatment Visit occur approximately one week apart , allow 6 8 day washout period . Subjects randomize 1 6 treatment sequence base computer-generated randomization schedule . Subjects receive 6 treatment specify treatment sequence accord 6 × 6 Williams Latin square design . The following treatment administer : A. Scopolamine placebo + BPN14770 placebo + donepezil placebo B. Scopolamine 0.5 mg + BPN14770 placebo + donepezil placebo C. Scopolamine 0.5 mg + BPN14770 10 mg + donepezil placebo D. Scopolamine 0.5 mg + BPN14770 50 mg + donepezil placebo E. Scopolamine 0.5 mg + donepezil 10 mg +BPN14770 placebo F. Scopolamine 0.5 mg + BPN14770 50 mg + donepezil 10 mg During Treatment Visits ( Periods 1 6 ) , subject admit Clinical Research Unit ( CRU ) day prior study drug administration ( Day -1 ) discharge day study drug administration ( Day 2 ) . On morning study drug administration ( Day 1 ) , subject give study drug ( BPN14770 , donepezil , placebo ) 240mL room temperature water 2 hour prior scopolamine scopolamine placebo sc injection . The timing study drug administration refer t-2 ( Hour -2 ) . Breakfast available approximately 30 minute follow morning drug administration . Two hour study drug administration , scopolamine scopolamine placebo sc injection administer . The time scopolamine scopolamine placebo sc injection administer referred t0 ( Hour 0 ) . Cognitive testing perform 30 minute prior treatment scopolamine injection hour 1 , 2 , 3 , 4 , 6 post-scopolamine injection . PK sample collect treatment period confirm study drug present . Safety assessment throughout study include physical exam , ECGs , vital sign , chemistry , hematology , urinalysis .</detailed_description>
