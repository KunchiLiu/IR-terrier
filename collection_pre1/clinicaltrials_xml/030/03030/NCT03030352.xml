	<brief_title>Promoting Children 's Mental Health : The Effects Parenting Program</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Raising child fundamental yet challenge task . While parent highly invest child 's development , also vast influence . Indeed , among environmental factor , widely accept predictor child mental health parent quality . Research show optimal parenting compose three key dimension : structure , autonomy support , affiliation ( vs. permissiveness , psychological control , rejection ) . For parent , provide three key `` nutriment '' necessarily natural easy . Indeed , challenge ( 1 ) require child adopt socially desirable behavior ( 2 ) without thwart need self-determination , ( 3 ) preserve positive parent-child relationship . In addition , available parenting resource ( e.g. , diverse parent book ) sometimes contradictory , abstract , rarely tap three important parent dimension . Providing general population concrete complete parent education essential help parent important yet challenging role . The goal propose research evaluate parent program ( i.e. , How-to program ) address three key dimension optimal parenting . This program congruent basic developmental research knowledge decade motivation research devote autonomy support self-determination theory . The objective How-to parent program 1 ) improve optimal parenting style , 2 ) foster child mental health ( i.e . decrease child ' internal external problem , increase child ' well-being ) . The investigator expect parent assign experimental group show improvement parent time , whereas parent control group show improvement ( i.e. , stable decline parent quality ) . The investigator also expect child parent experimental group experience improvement mental health , whereas child whose parent wait list show improvement time ( i.e. , stable deteriorate mental health well-being ) . The research team recruit participant conduct study four school per year , four year . The How-to parenting program offer parent grade school child ( 5 12 year old ) . Grade school recruit Montreal school board . Only one parent per family may participate study . If parent one child grade school , ask identify one close 9 year age answer questionnaires `` target '' child . The seven-week parenting program offer experimental group ( one per school ) spring ( Years 1 4 ) . Each 4 experimental group pair wait list control group school . Parents control group offer program follow year ( Years 2 5 ) . In total , 256 parent different family ( mother father ) recruit participate school ( 16 parent [ 8 experimental group + 8 control group ] 4 school , 4 year ) . This sample size chosen achieve adequate power , keep study feasible give participation rate . The How-to program highlight importance structure teach parent provide . Parents learn communicate expectation , give feedback , follow logical consequence use problem solve recurrent problem . In addition , program perfectly capture mean autonomy-supportive . Moreover , style help child feel well rule . These new skill empower parent exert authority confidence , importantly , without guilt . Parents apt provide structure effectively consistently . With How-to Parenting program , parent learn listen respond child way help child feel love accepted . The How-to parenting program consist seven 2 Â½-hour weekly session . It manual-based program participant exercise booklet contain parent skill exercise . Groups lead 2 group leader form 6 10 parent . The format program optimizes learn ( 1 ) link group content parent ' need , ( 2 ) facilitate awareness perspective taking activity , ( 3 ) offering concrete parenting skill , ( 4 ) modeling skill provide practice predictable non-judgmental environment , ( 5 ) emphasize importance implement skill home long term behavioral change , ( 6 ) offering tool ( i.e. , exercise booklet , skill summary ) facilitate information retention . All parent child complete questionnaire randomization ( baseline ) , seven-week program ( post-test ) , 6-month 1-year follow ups ass change time . Data also collect targeted child 's teacher . These teacher report collect school , assessment point . At follow ups , teacher report provide participate child 's new teacher ( i.e. , October April 2nd school year ) . All measure ( except control variable ) include four assessment time allow change measurement . The investigator adopt intent-to-treat approach , approach increase external internal validity . Parenting style measure review select best reflect recent conceptualization three key parent dimension least overlap . Affiliation ( Parental Bonding Instrument ) , structure ( Parenting Scale ) , attitude toward autonomy ( How-to Parenting Skill Scale ; Parental Autonomy Support Scale ( P-PASS ) ) assess parent child . Child mental health assess use multi-source approach ( parent , teacher child report ) . Parents rate child 's internalized externalized psychological problem ( Child Behavior Checklist ; CBCL ) . Teachers ask evaluate child 's classroom social problem ( Teacher-Child Rating Scale ; TCRS ) . The problem subscales TCRS ass internalize ( I- ) externalized- ( E- ) problem . Teachers also complete competency subscales TCRS , evaluate socio-emotional competency ( i.e. , frustration tolerance , task orientation social skill ) . In present data , baseline , post-test , 6-month 1-year follow measure nest within parent , nest within parent group . To evaluate change time , four assessment point ( baseline , post-test , 6-month follow , 12-month follow ) treat repeated measure use piecewise growth hierarchical linear modelling ( HLM ) . These analysis choose model change subsequent time point , allow rate change differ across time . HLM model recommend intervention study order capture rate change intervention period follow period . The effect parent program evidence significant interaction rate change experimental condition . These interaction reveal optimal parenting component ( H1 ) child mental health indicator ( H2 ) increase time participant experimental condition , participant control group . By include three dimension optimal , authoritative parenting , How-to program stand contrast majority exist parent training program . In general , intervention target child already show behavioral problem consider risk focus behavior management strategy plan ignore reinforcement . Results recent meta-analysis provide support adoption program encompass three essential dimension optimal parenting . Indeed , result show program ' component predictive large effect pertain autonomy support , affiliation structure . Though formal evaluation How-to program make , one early study suggest associate well familial climate parenting practice . This proposal first step toward implement evaluate parent program tailor promotion child 's mental health . By improve parenting , ameliorate child 's life-course trajectory , thereby reduce mental health problem associate cost . By offer parent group , research project include significant knowledge transfer component directly impact parent enrol program . Dissemination finding make school , give school principal , teacher parent easy-to-read summary result . If present randomize control trial follow replication trial successful , wide dissemination/evaluation trial implement , make program widely available parent .</detailed_description>
