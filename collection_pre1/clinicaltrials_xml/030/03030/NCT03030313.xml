	<brief_title>Respiration Rate Monitoring COPD Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The research question whether monitor respiration rate variability helpful management COPD patient conjunction separately self-reported symptom score use COPD Co-PILOT application . Current technique ( patient 's self-reported symptom ) limit sensitivity specificity regard predict decompensation . Measurement respiration parameter variability parameter may detect worsen COPD . Changes respiration pattern may occur sufficiently far advance decompensation ( e.g . &gt; 5 day prior patient symptom ) would allow opportunity early intervention medical assessment current therapeutic approach . The specific primary aim include evaluation correlation respiration rate parameter indicator healthcare utilization include drug change , office ER visit , hospitalization , clinical intervention . Secondary aim include evaluation ( ) sensitivity specificity respiration rate monitoring result predict COPD worsen require medical intervention , ( ii ) sensitivity specificity respiration rate monitoring result conjunction COPD Co-PILOT score component predict COPD worsen require medical intervention , correlation respiration rate parameter episode duration define number day COPD Co-PILOT Score &gt; 1 resolution ( COPD Co-PILOT Score &lt; 1 7 consecutive day ) .</detailed_description>
