	<brief_summary>Background : Gastric cancer cancer stomach . Hereditary one pass parent child . Researchers want gather data hereditary gastric cancer . They want learn change cause body gene involve . Objective : -To gather data hereditary gastric cancer . Eligibility : - People least 2 year old personal family history hereditary gastric cancer . - People least 2 year old gene change lead cancer lesion may hereditary . Design : - Participants screen separate protocol . - Participants : - Physical exam - Medical history - Blood test - Scans - Photos skin lesion finding - Gynecology consultation woman - Cheek swab ( participant ) - For participant , relative ask join study . - Some participant ask allow study get store tissue sample relatives die . - Some sample send outside lab . All personal data protect . Samples destroy study end . - Participants get result genetic test . - Participants come NIH clinic may give cheek swab genetic test do . - Some participant contact test .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Background : - An estimate 1-3 % gastric cancer case occur within familial background part inherit cancer syndrome - Hereditary Diffuse Gastric Cancer ( HDGC ) frequent form familial gastric cancer link germline mutation CDH1 gene - Gastric Adenocarcinoma Proximal Polyposis Stomach ( GAPPS ) recently describe autosomal dominant syndrome characterize fundic gland polyposis antral spar - Other syndrome predispose gastric cancer include Li-Fraumeni syndrome , Lynch syndrome , Peutz-Jeghers syndrome , familial adenomatous polyposis syndrome others Objectives : - Characterize natural clinical history hereditary gastric cancer syndromes Eligibility : - Individuals , family member , fulfill clinical criterion hereditary gastric cancer syndrome irrespective previous genetic test treatment Design : - These rare family recruit genetically confirm diagnosis study natural history hereditary gastric cancer - Genetic testing offer gain appreciation effect mutation relative activity various germline somatic mutation . - We determine relationship mutation disease phenotype .</detailed_description>
