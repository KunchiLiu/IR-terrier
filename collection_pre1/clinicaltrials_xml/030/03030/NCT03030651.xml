	<detailed_description>Sample size calculate use Sample Size Calculator ( SSC ) Windows base software package ( 93 ) follow assumption : detect increase exclusive breastfeed 6 month 52 % 72 % ( 44 ) , 95 % Confidence Intervals 80 % power , assume intra-cluster correlation coefficient 0â€¢1 Ugandan study ( 94 ) cluster size ten , calculate need thirty six cluster . Adding 20 % sample size loss follow-up , final sample size 432 pregnant woman ( 216 intervention , 216 control ) . Standard operate procedure prepare use data collection . Data enter Epi-data version 3.1 analyze use STATA version 12.0 . Frequency distribution run identify outlier . In relation trial hypothesis , intervention group compare routine education use intention treat analysis . For outcome , proportion woman initiate BF timely exclusively breastfed baby 72 hour 6 month compare use odds ratio derive use logistic regression intervention control group . In analysis , adjustment make cluster zone level since randomization do cluster level rather individual level . Generalized linear model use calculate prevalence ratio ( PR ) categorical anthropometric outcome . In longitudinal analysis , correlated nature data repeat measurement take account adjust repeat measurement individual well above-mentioned design effect result cluster randomization . A linear mixed effect regression model use longitudinal analysis z-scores cluster random effect repeat measurement child account first order autocorrelation structure . Least Squares Means ( LSM ) report 3 , 6 month , correspond schedule data collection visit .</detailed_description>
