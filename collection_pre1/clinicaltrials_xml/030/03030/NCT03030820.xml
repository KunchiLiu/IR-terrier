	<detailed_description>This prospective study cirrhotics healthy control compare oral microbiota , endotoxemia systemic inflammation baseline 10 30 day clinically indicate systematic oral cleansing intervention well 3-month 6 month hospitalization post-cleaning . The investigator recruit cirrhotic subject age- match healthy control hepatology clinic . Subjects inform regard study give investigator write informed consent . After informed consent evaluation eligibility , subject ask complete oral health questionnaire sample collection recruitment visit . Patients scheduled dental exam separate screen visit 7 day recruitment visit Dental Clinics . At time patient undergo cognitive test consist validated cognitive battery PHES ( psychometric hepatic encephalopathy score ) EncephalApp stroop . During dental exam do screen visit , subject undergo comprehensive oral evaluation include dental xrays ( need ) part study , periodontal examination ( determination pocket depth , clinical attachment level , bleed probing , plaque index ) record caries oral soft tissue lesion . Dental clean part study protocol intend fully treat patient 's periodontal dental disease . Therefore follow-up dental visit schedule dental clinic completion dental cleaning . The patient qualify study informed finding dental professional subsequently patient need make arrangement dental treatment need . Based oral health status , subject assign two group healthy ( healthy mild gingivitis ) periodontally diseased ( mild moderate chronic periodontitis ) . The study include four group subject ( Group 1 : control without periodontitis; Group 2 : control periodontitis , Group 3 : cirrhotics without periodontitis; Group 4 : cirrhosis periodontitis ) Subjects schedule dental cleaning could occur 1 2 visit determine screen exam . Before initiation oral therapy , plaque gingival crevicular sample collect microbiota . The subject periodontitis group receive deep dental cleaning ( scale root plan ) oral hygiene instruction per clinical indication . The periodontally healthy subject receive mild dental cleaning ( prophylaxis ) oral hygiene instruction clinically indicate . Subjects follow day 10 day 30 point stool , saliva blood sample similar analysis collect . There dental examination initial assessment treatment . We repeat cognitive test day 30 use alternate form cognitive test . The investigator also follow 6 month post-cleaning hospitalization use active chart review follow-up</detailed_description>
