	<detailed_description>Systemic lupus erythematosus ( SLE ) cause major organ damage shortens lifespan relatively young person . Early diagnosis treatment essential improve outcome SLE patient . However , evidenced-based approach early treatment intervention appropriate target population intervention available . We propose individual positivity antinuclear antibody ( ANAs ) also exhibit feature use classify SLE , high risk progress full systemic form disease . These individual , significant level ANA 1 2 additional item lupus classification criterion , consider incomplete lupus erythematosus ( ILE ) . We propose treat ILE patient hydroxychloroquine ( HCQ ) `` Study Anti-Malarials Incomplete Lupus Erythematosus '' SMILE trial . The primary objective determine whether HCQ treatment prevent acquisition additional clinical immunologic feature define SLE . The major secondary objective determine whether HCQ treatment : ( 1 ) lessen lupus disease activity measure standard scoring index ; ( 2 ) improve patient report outcome ( 3 ) prevents accumulation immunologic abnormality include autoantibody cytokine ( 4 ) acceptable toxicity profile . The specific aim proposal : 1 . To carry double-blind , placebo-controlled , multicenter , randomize trial HCQ vs. placebo patient ILE . The study test hypothesis early use HCQ modify disease feature accumulation abnormality lead classification SLE significantly slow . 2 . To determine effect HCQ disease activity patient-reported outcome patient ILE . 3 . To characterize immunologic profile HCQ ILE-treated patient . Autoantibodies , cytokine chemokines measure multiplex array develop insight underlie mechanism . 4 . To quantitatively assess incidence ophthalmologic toxicity HCQ-treated ILE patient . All enrol patient standardized ophthalmologic examination study treatment . Recommendations use monitor patient population develop . The SMILE trial determine whether HCQ give ILE patient , provide insight appropriate target population , propose candidate biomarkers guide treatment decision . While part Precision Medicine InitiativeÂ® , SMILE consistent goal . It first step towards test feasibility disease prevention study SLE accumulate biological sample repository available lupus research community in-depth mechanistic study .</detailed_description>

The subject diagnose another autoimmune disorder , autoimmune thyroid condition . 3 . The subject fibromyalgia , base clinical history exam . 4 . The subject previously currently treat oral antimalarial agent include hydroxychloroquine , chloroquine , quinacrine . 5 . The subject currently treat immunosuppressive , immune modifying , cytotoxic medication list Section 7.2 . 6 . Use investigational agent within precede 12 month . 7 .

Concomitant malignancy history malignancy exception adequately treat basal squamous cell carcinoma skin , carcinoma situ cervix . 11 . The subject significant finding ophthalmological examination , opinion examine Ophthalmologist , prevent safe use hydroxychloroquine . 12 . The subject contraindication treatment hydroxychloroquine include preexist ocular disease , hepatic impairment , psoriasis , porphyria , allergy drug class . 13 . Comorbidities require systemic corticosteroid therapy great 10 mg prednisone per day , equivalent , change corticosteroid dose within 3 month prior Visit 1 . 14 . Starting , stop , change dose counter prescription nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drug ( NSAIDs ) three month prior Visit 1 . 15 . Pregnant , breastfeeding , unwilling practice birth control participation study . 16 . Presence condition abnormality opinion Investigator would compromise safety patient quality data . 17 . Inability comply study visit schedule procedure .</criteria>
