	<detailed_description>The coronary artery system 3 component different function : conductive epicardial coronary artery , arteriole , capillary . When one system fail , myocardial ischemia occur . Therefore , presence epicardial coronary artery stenosis necessarily prerequisite ischemic heart disease ( IHD ) . Although establish microvascular disease independent macrovascular disease , clinical study consistently show presence microvascular disease independent predictor poor clinical outcome , especially patient acute myocardial infarction ( MI ) . The pressure-derived fractional flow reserve ( FFR ) index become standard invasive method evaluate functional significance epicardial coronary artery stenosis , clinical outcome FFR-guided percutaneous coronary intervention ( PCI ) proven well angiography-guided PCI medical treatment . Although FFR-guided PCI report improve patient outcome FFR regard gold-standard invasive method assess functional significance coronary artery stenosis , still room improvement diagnosis treatment patient high FFR . In FAME II study , 14.6 % registry arm ( FFR &gt; 0.80 deferral PCI ) experience persistent angina , 9.0 % patient clinical event 2-year follow-up period . Therefore , microvascular assessment use coronary flow reserve ( CFR ) index microcirculatory resistance ( IMR ) provide additional diagnostic prognostic insight IHD patient , especially high FFR . Recently , Lee et al . ( JACC 2016 ) investigate clinical outcome among patient high-FFR deferred revascularization , accord physiologic classification use CFR IMR . Lee et al . firstly present 7.0 % patient high FFR high IMR low CFR regard overt microvascular disease . Although proportion patient high FFR overt microvascular disease small , Group D poor clinical outcome follow-up . The presence overt microvascular disease independent prognostic factor patient high FFR . In addition , presence overt microvascular disease additive prognostic value aside clinical risk factor , significantly improve discriminant function prediction model . These result suggest invasive physiologic assessment microvascular disease combine CFR IMR help identify patient high risk future cardiovascular event among high FFR . Previous study show presence microvascular disease associate high risk cardiovascular event cardiac death , MI , revascularization patient without flow-limiting epicardial stenosis . Several mechanism propose association microvascular disease poor clinical outcome . In addition myocardial ischemia , microvascular disease report associated endothelial dysfunction inflammatory activity precede intimal thickening , lipid deposition macrovascular system , coronary vasomotor dysfunction . In study Dhawan et al. , coronary microvascular dysfunction patient non-obstructive coronary artery disease associate high serum high-sensitivity C-reactive protein high frequency thin-cap fibroatheroma . In Lee et al . 's study , high clinical event rate patient overt microvascular disease result cardiac death revascularization rate higher group . These result imply presence overt microvascular disease induce accentuate atherosclerotic progression subsequent clinical event include cardiac death ischemia-driven repeat revascularization . Therefore , IMaging Physiologic Predictors Atherosclerotic Progression Deferred Lesions Contemporary Medical Treatment base Fractional Flow Reserve-guided Strategy ( IMPACT-FFR registry ) design compare risk atherosclerotic plaque progression subsequent clinical event deferred lesion without microvascular disease , define physiological classification also explore independent predictor atherosclerotic lesion progression defer lesion base fractional flow reserve-guided strategy treat contemporary medical treatment .</detailed_description>
