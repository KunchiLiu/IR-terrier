	<brief_summary>This phase I trial study side effect best dose pembrolizumab recombinant interleukin-12 treating patient solid tumor . Monoclonal antibody , pembrolizumab , may interfere ability tumor cell grow spread . Recombinant interleukin-12 may kill tumor cell block blood flow tumor stimulate white blood cell kill tumor cell . Giving pembrolizumab recombinant interleukin-12 may work well treat patient solid tumor .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . Establish maximum tolerate dose ( MTD ) recommend phase II dose ( RP2D ) recombinant human interleukin ( rhIL ) -12 combination pembrolizumab . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . To observe record anti-tumor activity . II . Evaluate safety regimen continuously monitor adverse event document utilizing Common Terminology Criteria Adverse Events ( CTCAE ) version ( v ) .4 . III . Evaluate overall response rate ( Response Evaluation Criteria Solid Tumors [ RECIST ] v.1.1 ) progression free survival patient enrol study . IV . Measure CD8+ T cell infiltration immunohistochemistry tumor biopsy obtain baseline , one week rIL12 2 cycle pembrolizumab-IL12 . V. Conduct exploratory translational laboratory correlative study utilize bank biospecimens ( tumor blood ) obtain baseline therapy . OUTLINE : This dose-escalation study recombinant interleukin-12 . Patients receive pembrolizumab intravenously ( IV ) 30 minute day 1 . Beginning 1 week start course 1 , patient receive recombinant interleukin-12 subcutaneously ( SC ) day 2 5 . Patients receive recombinant interleukin-12 SC day 2 5 week 1 2 . Courses repeat every 3 week absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . After completion study treatment , patient follow 3 year .</detailed_description>
