	<brief_summary>The goal research develop measurement tool simulation technology characterize predict individual response corneal treatment advance understanding corneal ectasia risk factor . Patients either 1 ) keratoconus evaluate corneal crosslinking 2 ) refractive error evaluate refractive surgery procedure LASIK eye image assess mechanical property computational simulation perform predict response treatment . One aim study test hypothesis computational model predict cornea 's shape change within clinically acceptable limit error .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The mechanical condition cornea important elusive property eye characterize . Weakness cornea think one primary cause corneal ectasia , major cause visual impairment worldwide . Corneal weakness also important identify refractive surgery candidate since surgery often involve tissue removal could lead corneal instability certain predisposed patient . In study , subject undergo image optical coherence tomography ( OCT ) -based system characterize corneal biomechanical property . In addition , computational representation eye build image intervention simulate compare actual treatment outcome . No investigational procedure study-specific intervention image involve .</detailed_description>
