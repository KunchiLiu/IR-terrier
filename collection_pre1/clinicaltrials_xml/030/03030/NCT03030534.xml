Participants compliance intervention measure 6 week 12 week 2 . Participants satisfaction intervention measure 6 week 12 week 3 . Retention rate measure 6 week 12 week Inclusion criterion - All staff university select study centre - Own smartphone take software application ( experimental group ) Target population The target number participant pilot-testing phase 185 Exclusion criterion Unwilling participate study - unable use smartphone What possible benefit risk participate ? We hope study afford participant benefit practice health promote lifestyle effectively thereby help him/her prevent non-communicable disease ( NCDs ) . In case participant diagnose NCDs , participate study provide individual relevant information make him/her live quality life . During study health assessment reveals deviation normal , individual refer school sickbay appropriate treatment principal researcher still follow him/her . The risk anticipate study demand participant meticulous adhere health promotion activity , beneficial long participant .</detailed_description>
