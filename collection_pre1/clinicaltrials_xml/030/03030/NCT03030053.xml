	<brief_title>The Effects Flavonoid Supplementation Cognition Neural Mechanisms Healthy Older Adults</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>There recently increase interest potential flavonoid , plant derive compound find food fruit vegetable , improve cognitive function . Research suggest flavonoid improve memory learning , possibly result anti-inflammatory neuroprotective effect , example increase cerebral blood flow ( CBF ) , protect vulnerable neuron , stimulate neuronal function growth . The propose research involve parallel design chronic dietary supplementation trial use flavonoid-supplement match control contain flavonoid , investigate long-term change cognitive performance . To understand neural mechanism behind potential change cognitive performance , rest cerebral blood flow ( CBF ) , blood-oxygen level dependent ( BOLD ) response two sensitive test cognitive performance , structural brain change measure group healthy elderly adult ( N=70 , age range 60-75 year ) use magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) . Additionally , peripheral vascular health measure use flow mediate dilatation ( FMD ) , bioavailability flavonoid monomer metabolite determine analysis plasma urine sample . Biomarkers blood associate vascular health neural functioning well marker interest relation possible mechanisms action flavonoid also measure . All endpoint acquire 24-week chronic supplementation either high flavonoid supplementation control product , consume addition participant ' normal diet . Measures also take follow 12-week post-intervention washout period order investigate whether beneficial effect sustain follow cessation supplementation .</detailed_description>
