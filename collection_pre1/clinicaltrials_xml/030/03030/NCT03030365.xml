	<brief_title>Orientation AD Patients : PET-MR Study</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>As population age progressively contribute global burden dementia , Alzheimer 's disease ( AD ) gain recognition health-and social-care priority . Evidence converge recently publish work well preliminary result , propose orientation sensitive marker preclinical AD-related neurodegeneration . Our behavioral result show simple orientation test surpass currently use neuropsychological test classification patient along AD spectrum . A subsequential fMRI study reveal orientation task preferentially recruit brain region identify susceptible early AD-related cortical atrophy , include posterior cingulate cortex , parietooccipital sulcus hippocampus bilaterally , well significantly overlap default mode network ( DMN ) - set interconnected brain region independently recognize highly perturbed AD . In attempt support role orientation AD propose use co-registration several modality neuroimaging patient AD , mild cognitive impairment ( MCI ) healthy control ( HC ) : resting-state fMRI , task-fMRI , structural MRI co-registered PET . 1 . Resting-state functional magnetic resonance ( fMRI ) image detect temporally synchronous , spatially distribute , spontaneous low frequency blood-oxygen level-dependent signal fluctuation task-free setting , cluster maps functional large-scale neural network . A major network reveal rest default DMN . DMN include posterior cingulate ( PCC ) , inferior parietal ( IPL ) , lateral ( LTC ) medial temporal ( MTL ) , medial prefrontal cortical region ( MPFC ) , know involved self-referential process include introspection , memory retrieval , daydream orientation . 2 . Task fMRI - use module recently demonstrate fMRI activation generate orientation task person , space time domain activate PCC , IPL , MPFC MTL hub DMN . This task apply patient AD . 3 . Structural MRI - decrease hippocampus volume early imaging finding follow cortical atrophy AD progress . 4 . PET - FDG-PET ( glucose metabolism ) know show temporo-parietal hypometabolism AD . Considered finding alongside ongoing research dynamic anatomical functional AD associate brain dysfunction , propose thorough , best knowledge , never attempt study aim link marker AD pathology ( cortical atrophy , decrease functional connectivity , cerebral glucose metabolism ) disruption specific cognitive faculty , particularly orientation space , time person domain .</detailed_description>
