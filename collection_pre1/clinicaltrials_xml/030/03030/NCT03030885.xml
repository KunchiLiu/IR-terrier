	<criteria>Males , age ≥18 year . Subjects must histologically cytologically confirm adenocarcinoma prostate Subjects must castration resistant evidence progressive prostate cancer despite castrate level testosterone ( ≤ 50 ng/dL ) accord PCWG3 criterion Subjects must metastatic disease detectable either bone scan cross sectional imaging CT MRI per PCWG3 guideline Subjects must progressive disease study entry define 1 follow 3 criterion occur subject androgen deprivation therapy : PSA progression define minimum two rise PSA level interval ≥1 week determination . Subjects receive antiandrogen part primary hormonal therapy must demonstrate progression withdrawal . The PSA value screen ≥ 2 μg/L ( 2 ng/mL ) . Soft tissue disease progression define RECIST 1.1 Bone disease progression define PCWG3 two new lesion bone scan . Note : For subject enrol basis soft tissue bone progression , baseline scan must show progression relative comparison scan perform prior therapy . If comparison scan available , baseline scan report must reference previous scan document progression Subjects receive combined androgen blockade firstline hormonal therapy antiandrogen must show PSA progression discontinue antiandrogen ≥ 6 week prior study treatment . No washout need abiraterone enzalutamide discontinue . First generation antiandrogens bicalutamide must withdraw give firstline therapy . ECOG Performance status 01 . Adequate organ reserve evidence : 1. neutrophil count ≥ 1500 μL 2. platelet count ≥ 100,000/μL 3. hemoglobin ≥ 9.5 g/dL 4. total bilirubin level ≤1.5 x ULN 5 . AST ALT ≤2.5 x ULN 6. serum amylase ≤ ULN 7. lipase ≤ ULN 8. serum creatinine ≤1.5 x ULN calculate creatinine clearance ≥ 60 mL/min ( Cockroft Gault equation ) 9. clearance 99mTc MAG3 within 1.5 x ULN evidence obstruction scan . Serum albumin &gt; 3.0 g/dL Subjects must receive , ineligible receive , refuse least one cytotoxic chemotherapy enzalutamide abiraterone enzalutamide abiraterone . Subjects must agree use medically acceptable method birth control ( e.g. , spermicide conjunction barrier condom ) sexual abstinence duration study , include 30 day last dose study drug . Sperm donation prohibit study 30 day last dose study drug . Female partner must use hormonal barrier contraception unless postmenopausal abstinent . Life expectancy ≥ 6 month Subject predominant histologically cytologically confirm neuroendocrine prostate cancer ( mixed histology permissible , positivity serum CgA CEA ) . Subject receive investigational therapeutic agent prostate cancer within 4 week prior administration 131IMIP1095 . Subject recover effect major surgery prior initial treatment Subject receive treatment systemic therapeutic radioisotope ( 89Sr , 223Ra dichloride , 153Smlexidronam ) receive prior external beam radiation therapy ( EBRT ) head and/or neck . Subject currently renal dialysis Subject start treatment denosumab &lt; 1 month prior study entry . Subjects allow bisphosphonates denosumab provide stable dose ≥ 4 week administration study drug Subject use chronic systemic steroid great equivalent 10 mg prednisone/prednisolone per day 2 week precede study entry ; replacement dose steroid , topical , inhalational , nasal ophthalmic steroid permit . Diagnosis invasive malignancy within precede 3 year prior screen &gt; 30 % likelihood relapse within next 3 year , except nonmelanoma skin cancer nonmuscle invasive urothelial cancer Any serious illness medical condition social circumstance might interfere subject 's participation trial interfere interpretation result , include , limited : 1. uncontrolled infection 2 . NYHA Class III Class IV heart failure 3. unstable angina 4. myocardial infarction within 6 month prior study entry 5. uncontrolled hypertension ( systolic BP &gt; 160 mmHg despite 2 antihypertensive medication ) 6 . COPD require hospital admission year prior study entry 7. diabetes mellitus require hospital admission year prior study entry 8. chronic liver disease 9. hypothyroidism ( TSH level &gt; 3.0 mIU/L ) 10. substance abuse Unable unwilling follow posttherapy radiation protection procedure</criteria>
