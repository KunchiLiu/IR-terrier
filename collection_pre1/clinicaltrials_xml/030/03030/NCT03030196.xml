	<detailed_description>INTRODUCTION Infertility serious problem estimate affect 7-26 % couple globally ( 1 ; 2 ) . Approximately 9 % newborn conceive assisted reproductive technique 2013 Denmark ( Danish Fertility Society ) . Impaired semen quality causal contribute factor almost 50 % case infertility ( 3 ; 4 ) . Today , exist treatment improve semen quality infertile men . Instead , vast majority infertile couple treat assisted reproductive technique ( ART ) independently aetiology ( maternal/paternal ) cause infertility ( 3 ; 5-8 ) . The treatment choice range mild intrauterine insemination ( IUI ) invasive vitro fertilization ( IVF ) intracytoplasmic sperm injection ( ICSI ) . ART successful 70 % couple . However , ART expensive associate maternal side effect due invasive methodology need hormonal treatment , often several month ( 9-11 ) . Infertility also financial burden society due cost ART maintain acceptable annual birth rate . Fertility potential determine semen quality establish already fetus ( 12 ) . In case testes n't develop normally , reduce semen quality adulthood result result impair Sertoli cell function . Up today barely investigate whether intervention adulthood improve semen quality . Our recent study use human testis Vitamin D receptor knock-out mouse reveal vitamin D regulate bone factor RANKL express testis ( 13 ; 14 ) . This novel finding , RANKL know affect bone homeostasis extend influence immune system , inflammation lactation ( 15 ; 16 ) . In skeleton RANKL express osteoblast bind specific receptor RANK osteoclasts induce osteoclastogenesis bone resorption ( 17 ) . This activation control osteoprotegerin ( OPG ) , bind ligand domain RANKL thus inhibit RANK activation osteoclastogenesis , ultimately reduce bone resorption ( 18 ) . This knowledge utilize development OPG-analogue drug , recombinant human monoclonal IGg2 antibody Denosumab ( Prolia Amgen ) , inhibit RANKL thereby bone resorption indicate use osteoporosis bone metastasis ( 19 ; 20 ) . Prolia several clinical study show safe approve treatment osteoporosis men woman ( 21-24 ) . AIM OF STUDY To determine significance systemic RANKL inhibition male reproduction investigate whether Denosumab ( Prolia ) increase semen quality particularly identify group men benefit treatment . DESIGN Single center , prospective randomize double blinded* clinical control intervention . Patients method : 95 infertile men , otherwise healthy , recruit among men refer investigation infertility outpatient clinic Dpt . Growth Reproduction , Rigshopitalet . Neither choose participate , decline , affect outpatient clinic treatment . The 95 participant randomly allocate receive either - Denosumab s.c. injection 60 mg x1 , - Placebo , Sodium Chloride s.c. injection x 1 All participant deliver semen sample , blood sample DXA-scan perform intervention . All receive supplement Vitamin D calcium avoid hypocalcaemia , know , temporary side effect Denosumab . *double blinded study require placebo active substance identical . Placebo obtain Amgen able receive purchase placebo . Instead study double blind patient , medical doctor participate data-handling analysis - one nurse give medicine unblinded . She know whether injects active substance placebo . Inclusion criterion - Men &gt; 18 year age refer due infertility need investigation - Sperm concentration ≥ 0,05 mio./ml . - Sperm concentration &lt; 15 mio./ml - &lt; 40 % motile spermatozoer ( ABC ) - &lt; 4 % morphologically normal sperm ( strict criterion ) Exclusion criterion - Men chronic disease ( diabetes mellitus , thyroid disease , endocrine disease require treatment , malignant disease diseases know affected by- interfere vitamin D supplement ( granulomatous disease sarcoidosis , tuberculosis , wegener , vasculitis well inflammatory bowel disease e.g . chron 's disease ulcerative colitis etc. ) . - Men active previous malignant disease - Any case indication testis biopsy , - Total calcium &lt; 2.14 mmol/l - 25-OH Vitamin D &lt; 25 nmol/L - Poor dental status dental implant - Men obstructive oligospermia vasectomize - Serum Inhibin B &lt; 30 pg/ml - Abnormal karyotype - Patients practice excessive exercise SAMPLE SIZE CALCULATION AND STATISTICS With test level 5 % ( level significance ) , power 80 % 40 men group able detect change total number motile sperm 75 % , change sperm concentration ( indexed baseline value ) 25 % . We expect include total 95 men , take account possibility dropouts . This correspond dropout rate 10 % , case rate lower , chance detect significant difference 80 % . Since expect 50 % infertile men outpatient clinic , meet inclusion criterion 50 % consent participation , anticipate screen 380 men total . BIOSTATISTICAL ANALYSIS All analyse perform accord Good Clinical Practice guideline primary analysis intention-to-treat population , include patient underwent randomization receive first dose medicine day 1 . We analyze data 2 way . The primary analysis proceed accord randomize group assignment . The secondary analysis base stratify men accord subgroup analyse relation predefined primary secondary endpoint . The primary end point protocol change sperm production evaluate : total motile spermatozoon ( 106 ) , total progressive motile spermatozoon ( 106 ) , total spermatozoon ( 106 ) sperm concentration ( 106/ml ) . Due low sample size large intraindividual variation sperm production primary endpoint also evaluate normalization mean average level prior intervention . Based first intervention estimate 60 % men benefit treatment study design determine whether serum OPG , RANKL phosphate use identify men benefit treatment . The use specify endpoint useful determine efficacy . Multiple secondary endpoint exist initial investigation focus : Sperm DFI , morphology , motility , semen volume , pregnancy rate , Inhibin B , vitamin D calcium homeostasis . Subjects terminate participation visit 80 day visit day 160 include data analysis day 80 . Men deliver one semen sample miss data visit still include analysis . Men fever 3 month prior semen analysis consider potential confounder . Those value carry forward analysis . A significance level 5 % use . For primary analysis Bonferroni-Holm p-value correction calculate additionally . For secondary analysis multiple test correction use . Instead result discuss view multiple testing situation . 1 . Analyses placebo versus active substance : The first step compare change primary outcome across two group . This analysis show significant difference group . For endpoint measured baseline day 80 160 , pair t-tests use ass whether significant difference group determine whether mean change within group differs significantly zero . In case , data transform necessary meet model assumption . Afterwards , analysis conduct use multiple regression relevant confounders season , BMI , smoking , age , duration abstinence , time ejaculation motility assessment , fever etc . see change result . For outcomes measure compare t-test parametric test day 1 , day 80 day 160 , group compare use non-parametric test Wilcoxon Mann-Whitney test . For Binary outcome data compare two group mean conditional logistic-regression analysis adjustment relevant confounders ( define significantly p &lt; 0.05 associate ) . For outcomes measure repeatedly , entail comparing estimate slope , rate change , outcome group . Mixed model allow correlation repeat observation baseline-day 1-day 80- day 160 man suitably incorporate parameter estimation . Sperm production variable normalize baseline level avoid huge interindividual variation sperm count sperm concentration 2 . Subgroup analysis essential study expect around 60 % men benefit treatment Denosumab . Analyses stratification subgroup therefore use identify marker select men benefit treatment Subjects group accord serum OPG and/or RANKL , RANKL/OPG ratio , DNA-fragmentation-Index prior start intervention . Afterwards potential predictor treatment response test BMI , S-calcium , s-phosphate , BMD , semen quality , Inhibin b , FSH day 80 day 160 . For Serum OPG stratification could two group separate instance 3 pg/ml three group , &lt; 3 , 3-4 4pg/ml . Likewise RANKL RANKL/OPG ratio DNA-fragmentation-Index stratification could also two group separate e.g . DFI 40 % . The subgroup analyse accordance normal clinical practice stratification appropriate group accord clinical highest/lowest group . SCREENING AND TIME COURSE The study initiate January 2017 end last person include late January 2021 . OUTCOME MEASUREMENTS Endpoints : Primary endpoint • Change semen production ( total motile spermatozoon , progressive motile spermatozoon , sperm count , sperm concentration ) Secondary endpoint - Change semen quality ( -motility , -morphology , semen volume ) - Change DNA fragmentation ( DFI ) rate sperm - Change serum Inhibin-B - Change serum level reproductive hormone ( FSH , LH , AMH , testosterone , estradiol SHBG ) - Change bone mineral density evaluate DXA . - Change serum level inactive vitamin D , 1,25 ( OH ) 2D3 , 25-OHD3 , 24,25 ( OH ) 2D3 , PTH , alkaline phosphatase , ionized calcium , phosphate , FGF23 , Klotho , osteocalcin , matrix gla , osteopontin , calcitonin , pnp , procollagen III , OPG , RANKL , Sclerostin well bone marker . - Change choice assist reproductive assistance technique well conceived pregnancy - Change spontaneous conception rate - Change live birth rate - Change number spermatozoon express RANKL - Change semen pH , HCO3- , calcium , zink , phosphate , RANKL , RANK , OPG , FGF23 , Klotho , osteocalcin , osteopontin . VDB , 24,25OH2 - Difference infection rate two group SETTING , SCIENTIFIC PLAN AND RECRUITMENT Participants include among men refer Department Growth Reproduction ( dept . GR ) , Rigshospitalet ( RH ) evaluation male infertility This prospective , double blind , two-arm randomize controlled trial . Group intervention : Each man receive Denosumab 60 mg x 1 sc day 1 Group receive placebo : Will follow chain event , although Denosumab replace saline All men offer vitamin D calcium supplementation start prior initiation treatment start Denosumab placebo : vitamin D 15 microgram calcium 400 mg daily . PARTICIPANTS Screening ~500 infertile men perform . The investigator assume ~300 men exclude ~100 men wish participate . Thus , 95 men include study half randomize active treatment . The investigator expect small drop ( &lt; 5 ) high motivation adverse effect . ANALYSIS AND INTERVENTION Reproductive hormone semen analyze dept . GR , Rigshospitalet . ETHICS AND SIDE EFFECTS All patient full-filled investigation , invite study . They inform potential adverse effect , leave trial point without consequence .
