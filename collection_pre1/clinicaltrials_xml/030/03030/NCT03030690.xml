	<brief_title>A Clinical Assessment Glass Carbomer Cement</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Glass Carbomer monomer free ; carbomised nano-glass restorative cement develop traditional glass ionomer cement ( GIC ) contain nano-sized powder particle hydroxyapatite fluorapatite . These material claim improved mechanical property well bond dentin , addition continue fluoride release . The study randomize controlled clinical trial teeth randomly assign one three restoration group . Following medical dental history , bilateral bitewing radiograph take patient assess presence proximal lesion . Suitable teeth randomly assign one restoration group . A single operator use local anesthesia rubber dam isolation prepare standardized Class II cavity place designate restoration accord manufacturer 's instruction . The quality 3 type restoration clinically evaluate baseline every six month color match , marginal discoloration , anatomic form , marginal adaptation , secondary caries use criterion describe `` Cvar Ryge '' ( 2005 ) . The evaluation perform 2 calibrated examiner . Following placement restoration , bitewing radiograph take evaluate restoration repeat every six month detection recurrent caries .</detailed_description>
