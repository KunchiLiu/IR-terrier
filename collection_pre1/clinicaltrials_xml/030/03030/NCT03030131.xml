	<brief_summary>Lung cancer still lead cause cancer related-deaths worldwide , overall all-stage 5-year survival approximately 17 % . The primary treatment early stage ( I-IIIA ) NSCLC curative surgery . Although patient treat curative surgery well prognosis , 5-year survival patient treat surgery alone remain low , range 67 % ( stage IA ) 23 % ( stage IIIA ) . Several randomized trial compare postoperative chemotherapy versus chemotherapy show significant overall survival benefit postoperative chemotherapy completely resect patient NSCLC stage II IIIA . Likewise randomized trial demonstrate preoperative chemotherapy improve survival recently analyse also base individual patient data 15 randomized trial show significant benefit preoperative chemotherapy survival survival improvement 5 % 5 year . Then , neoadjuvant chemotherapy also become accept many country . Targeting PD-1 receptor ligand PD-L1 , inhibit engagement attractive therapeutic option early stage NSCLC , may reactivate host immune response enable longterm tumor control .</brief_summary>
