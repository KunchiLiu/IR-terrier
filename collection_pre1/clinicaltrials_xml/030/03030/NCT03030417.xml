	<brief_summary>Background : The new drug LMP744 damage DNA . This cause cell death . Researchers want see treat certain kind cancer . They want understand drug work affect body . Objective : To test safety LMP744 find dose drug safely give human . Eligibility : Adults least 18 year old metastatic solid tumor lymphoma , progressed treatment . Design : Participants screen : - Vital sign take - Blood urine test - Heart test - Scans ultrasound Some participant tumor sample take 2 time . A small piece tumor remove small needle . A scan ultrasound guide process . The study do 28-day cycle . Each cycle , participant get study drug vein 60 minute day 5 day . For day 1 cycle 1 , participant admit clinic blood urine take several time . At begin cycle , participant clinic visit repeat screen test . They also twice middle cycle 1 middle cycle 2 . After participant stop take study drug , follow 30 day . They may give blood sample . They contact phone see .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Indenoisoquinoline LMP744 Adults With Relapsed Solid Tumors Lymphomas</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Background : - Indenoisoquinolines non-camptothecin inhibitor topoisomerase 1 ( top1 ) withimproved characteristic predecessor . Indenoisoquinolines well chemical stability , produce stable DNA-top1 cleavage complex , exhibit preference unique DNA cleavage site , compare camptothecin counterpart . - They demonstrate activity camptothecin-resistant cell line produce DNA-protein crosslinks , resistant reversal . They also show less resistance cell overexpressing ATP-binding cassette ( ABC ) transporter , ABCG2 , multidrug resistance ( MDR-1 ) . Primary Objectives : -To establish safety , tolerability maximum tolerate dose ( MTD ) LMP744 ( NSC 706744 ) administer intravenously ( IV ) daily 5 day ( QD x 5 ) schedule patient refractory solid tumor lymphomas . Secondary Objectives : - Characterize pharmacokinetic ( PK ) profile LMP744 . - Evaluate effect LMP744 marker DNA damage ( &gt; =H2AX , pNbs1 , pATR , ERCC1 , RAD51 ) epithelial-mesenchymal transition ( EMT ) circulate tumor cell ( CTCs ) pre- post- treatment tumor biopsies patient expansion cohort . - Assess preliminary antitumor activity LMP744 . Eligibility : -Adult patient must histologically document , relapse solid tumor metastatic unresectable , lymphoma progress FDA-approved therapy , therapy associate overall survival benefit , standard care therapy exist . Study Design : - Cycle 1 subsequent cycle : Patients receive LMP744 administer IV QD 1 hour day 1 5 follow 23 day without drug ( 28-day cycle ) . - PK PD sample collect . Tumor biopsies optional escalation phase mandatory expansion phase mandatory expansion phase .</detailed_description>

They must chemotherapy , biologic therapy , definitive radiotherapy within 4 week ( 6 week nitrosoureas mitomycin C ) 5 halflives , whichever short , prior enter study . Palliativeintent radiotherapy ( 30 Gy less ) must complete least 2 week prior start treatment , may lesion include measurable disease . Patients must great equal 2 week since investigational agent administer part Phase 0 study ( subtherapeutic dose drug administer ) PI discretion , recover grade 1 baseline toxicity . 9 . Patients receive bisphosphonates cancer undergo androgen deprivation therapy prostate cancer eligible therapy . 10 . Prior therapy topoisomerase I inhibitors allow . 11 . HIVpositive patient eligible provide follow criterion meet : CD4 count &gt; 350/mm3 , undetectable viral load , receive prophylaxis antibiotic . 12 . The effect LMP744 develop human fetus unknown . For reason , woman childbearing potential men must agree use adequate contraception ( hormonal barrier method birth control ; abstinence ) prior study entry duration study participation . Should woman become pregnant suspect pregnant partner participate study , inform treat physician immediately . Women men treat enrolled protocol must also agree use adequate contraception prior study , duration study participation , 4 month completion LMP744 administration . 13 . Ability understand willingness sign write informed consent document . 14 . Willingness provide blood new tumor biopsy sample research purpose expansion phase study . EXCLUSION CRITERIA : 1 . Patients receive investigational agent . 2 . Patients clinically significant illness would compromise participation study , include , limited active uncontrolled infection , immune deficiency , Hepatitis B , Hepatitis C , uncontrolled diabetes , uncontrolled hypertension , symptomatic congestive heart failure , unstable angina pectoris , myocardial infarction within past 6 month , uncontrolled cardiac arrhythmia , psychiatric illness/social situation would limit compliance study requirement . 3 . Patients know brain metastasis carcinomatous meningitis exclude clinical trial , exception patient whose brain metastatic disease status remain stable great equal 1 month treatment brain metastasis . Patients antiseizure medication steroid therapy may enrol discretion Principal Investigator . 4 . Pregnant woman exclude study LMP744 agent potential teratogenic abortifacient effect . Because unknown potential risk adverse event nurse infant secondary treatment mother LMP744 , breastfeed discontinue mother treat .
