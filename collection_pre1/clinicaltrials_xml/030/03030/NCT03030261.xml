	<brief_summary>Based need improve outcome post second autologous stem cell transplant ( ASCT ) multiple myeloma ( MM ) benefit see maintenance treatment follow initial ASCT , natural next step evaluate maintenance/continuation therapy follow second ASCT . Pomalidomide active MM cell refractory bortezomib lenalidomide , make ideal choice continuation therapy follow second ASCT . Adding elotuzumab may increase efficacy also durability responses essential improve outcome follow second ASCT .</brief_summary>
