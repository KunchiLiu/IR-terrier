	<brief_title>Biofeedback Asthma Comorbid With Anxiety Depression</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Introduction Previous publish research laboratory demonstrate clinically significant effect heart rate variability biofeedback asthma clinical condition . In NIH-supported trial complete , however , investigator find , among unmedicated patient mild moderate asthma , effect great placebo find literature . Significant effect find reduce anxiety depression , even among population select neither clinical anxiety depression . There considerable evidence literature negative affect common asthma , may interact asthma . Anxiety often accompany hyperventilation , asthma , hyperventilation exacerbate asthma , increase exposure air colder drier lung ( body temperature 100 % humidity ) . Indeed asthma symptom affect quality life associate hyperventilation , may partially stimulate anxiety , partially increase airway resistance , increase respiratory drive . Thus asthma process increase anxiety ( symptom associate hyperventilation ) , anxiety exacerbate asthma ( hyperventilation ) . Additionally , autonomic hyperreactivity , common anxiety , may produce parasympathetic hyperreactivity may cause bronchoconstriction . There considerable evidence heart rate variability ( HRVB ) biofeedback ameliorate anxiety , asthma , combine effect may prove particularly beneficial people comorbid condition . The investigator therefore propose pilot study test effect HRVB asthma population clinically anxious . Another consistent effect HRVB ameliorate depression . There good physiological rationale use HRVB treat negative affect depression , stem anatomical evidence connection site HRVB effect baroreflex ( mediate nucleus tractus solitarius ) brain center involve negative emotion , particularly insula amygdala . Depression also highly prevalent among asthma patient , depressed patient often poor health care behavior , may worsen asthma condition . Depressive symptom also associate bronchoconstriction asthma . Anxiety depression frequently comorbid , overlap symptom , many anxiety patient expect also show sign clinical depression . Also , possible HRVB may improve make asthma medication available lung , deep breathing . Therefore asthma medication restrict study , medication intake monitor one outcome measure . Similarly medication anxiety depression also control , daily intake change medication monitor . Additionally patient level asthma severity study , long continue symptomatic . It possible , previous study , restrict inclusion patient mild asthma may contribute floor effect obscure biofeedback effect . In study investigator use HRVB protocol use previous study . The control group wait list control , give post-assessment three month , give treatment protocol , crossover design . Study Duration : 6 month Subject Recruitment Selection : Twenty patient recruit study , 10 treatment group 10 control group . Subjects recruit medium advertisement , physician referral , letter ( approve Institutional Review Board ) send physician asthma patient invite participate study . At physician ' request , study personnel may assist office prepare mailing . The investigator also work large behavioral healthcare organization , University Behavioral Healthcare ( UBHC ) , also provide primary care patient treat . UBHC provide list patient diagnose include asthma one anxiety disorder . The investigator contact patient 's physician therapist , ask provider give recruitment brochure patient , invite patient call study . Methods The study take place course six month . Screening run-in . At first session , patient first consent . Then give interview determine medical psychiatric history , give Asthma Control Test Beck Anxiety Inventory . They also give peak flow meter , train take reliable measure , instruct complete daily diary . Patients unable follow procedure follow session ( 1-2 week later , first psychophysiological test session , describe ) screen . Patients administer Asthma Quality Life questionnaire standardize situation , Asthma Control Test , Beck Depression Inventory Beck Anxiety Inventory . The Marlowe-Crowne Social Desirability Scale also administer pretest session , test know predict correlation symptom self report psychophysiological indicator , well stress-related asthma symptomatology . First three month treatment phase : Treatment control procedure take place first three month , The three month treatment consist 5 biweekly treatment session , 2 measurement session ( third session patient control group receive treatment ) . In control condition , patient ask send daily questionnaire ( give reminder call ) every two week ) . They provide stamp addressed envelope . The treatment session hour long measurement session 2 hour long . Second three-month treatment phase : Following post-test psychophysiological test session , subject control condition give three month treatment , , patient initially assign Treatment group receive procedure control group subject initial phase . Home practice : Subjects ask paced breathing resonance frequency ( approximately 6 breaths/min ) 20 min twice daily first session treatment . Subjects find procedure difficult lent biofeedback machine home practice . Psychophysiological test session Psychophysiological test session take place first treatment session ( wait list period ) , last treatment session ( wait list period ) phase study . Thus three test session give . Questionnaires : In second third test session , questionnaire give screen session readministered . A pulmonary function test perform use standard spirometry ( Three force expiratory maneuver maximal vital capacity ) . We affix sensor measure heart rate ( wrist ) , respiration ( strain gauge around waist ) , finger pulse volume ( plethysmograph attach middle finger nondominant hand ) , palmar skin conductance ( electrode paste forefinger thenar eminence nondominant hand ) . Exhaled carbon dioxide collect nasal cannula measure hyperventilation symptom , target HRVB , common asthma . After sensor attach , 5-min baseline period take place patient 'plain vanilla task ' ( look series color rectangle , count number particular color ) , follow 5 minute HRV biofeedback uninstructed relaxation ( control group ) , follow another baseline . After 5-min period , perform 3 minute test use force oscillation pneumograph , follow spirometry ( standard 3-puff procedure ) . This instrument involve play sound wave mouth , measure sound bounce back lung . Because canulas sometimes mildly uncomfortable , 5-min baseline biofeedback ( relaxation ) period give twice , measure end tidal carbon dioxide ( CO2 ) without . Testing session perform 6-hour albuterol withhold . If patient experience exacerbation asthma symptom , patient instruct take medication usual , session reschedule . Pulmonary function measure ( impulse oscillometry spirometry ) take use Jaeger 'IOS ( Impulse Oscillometry System ) Masterscreen ' unit 5-min assessment period . Other psychophysiological measure take use J &amp; J Engineering C2+ , output electrocardiogram ( EKG ) data 1000 samples/sec later analysis use program call 'WinCPRS ' . Daily measure Patients ask provide daily symptom diary twice daily peak flow reading ( morning upon arise even prior retire ) Randomization A stratified randomization protocol use , three criterion : gender , age ( old young 40 , age HRV tend abruptly decrease ) , asthma control ( percent expect basis normative data amount air exhale first second forced expiratory maneuver maximal vital capacity ( FEV1 ) . Statistical treatment A mixed model repeat measure analysis do measure Treatment between-groups measure Session ( Task physiological measure three task physiological test session ) .</detailed_description>
