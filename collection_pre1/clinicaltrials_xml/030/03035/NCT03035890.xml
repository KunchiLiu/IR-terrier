	<brief_summary>This study include additional use radiation therapy combination immunotherapy order determine whether radiation may improve response non-small cell lung cancer immunotherapy monitor side effect .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Hypofractionated Radiation Therapy Improve Immunotherapy Response Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Preclinical data suggest radiation therapy may uniquely suit combine immune checkpoint inhibitor , since radiation disrupt tumor 's physical barrier T-cell infiltration augment antigen presentation , thus serve `` situ personalized vaccine '' activate immune system potentially enhance systemic response . The rationale study determine safety efficacy combine immune checkpoint inhibitor radiation therapy metastatic non-small cell lung cancer patient .</detailed_description>
