	<brief_summary>Most preterm baby require supplemental oxygen variable period time , several week month birth . The aim oxygen therapy achieve adequate oxygen supply tissue without cause oxygen toxicity oxidative stress . The current routine monitoring relies oxygen saturation pulse oximetry without identify underlie pathology , lung parenchyma pulmonary vascular disease contribute pathophysiology variable degree . Steroids usage prevention Bronchopulmonary dysplasia also show adverse neurodevelopmental outcome . Available data conflict inconclusive ; clinician must use clinical judgment balance adverse effect Bronchopulmonary dysplasia potential adverse effect treatment individual patient . Very low birth weight infant remain mechanical ventilation 1 2 week age high risk develop Bronchopulmonary dysplasia . When consider corticosteroid therapy infant , clinician might conclude risk short course glucocorticoid therapy prevent Bronchopulmonary dysplasia warrant .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Study Justify Steroid Use Preterm Neonates Prevent Bronchopulmonary Dysplasia</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This prospective study . 30 Preterm infant admit neonatal intensive care unit Maadi , Ghamra military hospital , Ain Shams University hospital , prospectively enrol within 24 hour birth . Daily evaluation oxygen histogram measurement cumulative time oxygen saturation 80 % , ( risk hypoxemia potential tissue hypoxia ) , arterial oxygen saturation Sao2 95 % ( potential risk hyperoxia increase oxidative stress ) . Evaluation window weekly basis long infant oxygen support apply oxygen tolerance test . The treat clinical team blind result Oxygen tolerance test .</detailed_description>
