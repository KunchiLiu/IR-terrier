	<brief_summary>In study patient resectable basal cell carcinoma ( BCC ) usually undergo surgery without prior anticancer treatment treat antitumor medication . But since BCC mainly localize clearly visible region body , e.g . face , also need reduce scar consequence surgery accomplish neoadjuvant therapy . The used medication - vismodegib - display controllable adverse event show good efficacy reduction BCC lesion . It expect neoadjuvant set lead minor surgical intervention thus minimise surgical risk scar patient .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Neoadjuvant Vismodegib Patients With Large and/or Recurrent Resectable Basal Cell Carcinoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Patients resectable BCC receive neoadjuvant vismodegib therapy time period 12 week applies routine use vismodegib . This period choose within time side effect acceptable response expect . Tumor examination perform monthly expeditiously identify patient progressive disease . This do non-invasive imaging technique thus objective study test diagnostic suitability non-invasive methodology evaluation response status patient . Patients clinical trial treat effective medication approve therapy metastatic locally advanced BCC time show effective neoadjuvant set The dose approve advanced BCC disease use , therefore expect side effect predictable . Furthermore hint literature efficacy use medication may decrease patient resectable BCC . Since study patient less sick treatment vismodegib approve , surgery would therapy accord guideline . Thus risk vismodegib treatment judge great surgical risk BCC operate directly without prior reduction tumor lesion . A benefit great majority patient small lesion result minor scar well cosmetically outcome surgery .</detailed_description>
