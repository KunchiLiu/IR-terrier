	<brief_title>Studying Safety &amp; Efficacy Axiostat® Dressing Acute Hemorrhage Due Trauma-Comparative Study</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Abstract : Accidents trauma comprise leading cause death disability throughout world . In develop country India , emergency trauma care still infancy , account almost 10 % death every year . Lack adequate pre-hospital care uncontrolled bleeding wound site state prominent reason death . In study , novel chitosan-based haemostatic dressing ( Axiostat® , Axio Biosolutions , India ) investigate initial hemorrhage control device pre-hospital scenario . The study conduct help 35 Emergency Medical Technicians ( EMTs ) . A total 133 patient scalp wound injury identify study , 104 patient meet selection criterion include study . The selected patient randomly assign two group , test group consist 47 subject receive Axiostat® treatment ; whereas , 57 subject control group treat conventional cotton-gauze dressing . All subject need suture subject include study bring open scalp wound . The Axiostat® show superior efficacy control bleed comparison cotton gauze . The average time haemostasis cotton gauze dress 18.56 ± 5.04 minute ; Axiostat® haemostasis achieve less 5 minute ( 4.68 ± 1.04 min ) . On analyze study , evident Axiostat® dressing enables early haemostasis prevents much blood loss wound become clean removal dress later wound suture compare normal cotton gauze . These finding demonstrate potential Axiostat® first-line intervention control acute hemorrhage pre-hospital scenario .</detailed_description>

Patient and/or patient 's legal representative and/or impartial witness inform nature study agree provision provide write informed consent approve IEC MIMS , Kerala , India . Patients bleed wound scalp due injury . The wound must bleed time baseline assessment . The targeted wound size cover single available size study device per instruction use . The exclusion criterion study involve prior diagnosis disease medical condition affect ability blood clot ( e.g. , hemophilia ) . A nonsurvivable injury per investigator ' discretion . Patients opinion investigator may complete study reason , e.g . Patients require immediate suturing . Grossly infected wound may reasonably expect require multiple debridement procedure prior clearance bacteria nonviable tissue wound , case old wound . Patient currently participate investigational drug device study yet complete primary endpoint interfere procedure assessment trial . Patients Surgical/iatrogenic wound . Patients major head injury , spinal injury , neck injury , abdominal injury , deep wound injury , fracture , hemorrhagic shock , foreign material inside wound like stab injury .</criteria>
