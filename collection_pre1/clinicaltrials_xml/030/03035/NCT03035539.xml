	<detailed_description>Atrial fibrillation ( AF ) frequent cardiac arrhythmia cause increase morbidity , mortality socioeconomic cost . Research conduct recent year suggest various pharmacological therapy life style change may affect structural remodelling , thereby prevent incidence AF ( primary prophylaxis ) progression disease ( secondary prophylaxis ) . These therapy , know upstream therapy , include ace inhibitors/angiotensin II inhibitor , statin , intake n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acid moderate physical exercise . Furthermore , important part treatment alleviate patient ' symptom , reduce risk thromboembolic complication teach patient live chronic paroxysmal disease . Today , well-established pharmacological therapy available , sparse knowledge effect non-pharmacological therapy , patient obtain information disease , learn cope symptom , relate uncertainty experience next symptom-producing attack AF . Cardiac rehabilitation collective term aftercare patient chronic heart failure . Cardiac rehabilitation cross-functional approach participation physician , nurse , dietician smoke cessation instructor perform supervision cardiac specialist . Cardiac rehabilitation include : individually design treatment plan , offer patient information education , support smoking cessation , support diet change , psychosocial support , optimisation medical treatment risk factor control , advice physical exercise maintenance target . There strong evidence rehabilitation beneficial effect quality life , also morbidity mortality heart diseases AF . Currently , patient diagnosis AF offer rehabilitation programme , sparse knowledge effect rehabilitation patient ' quality life morbidity . It therefore vital importance develop implement rehabilitation programme aim improve quality life patient AF , possibly , prevent admission development AF . All participant examine exercise ECG ass maximum physical capacity ( estimate oxygen uptake ) , Six-minute-walk test Five-repetition-sit-to-stand test inclusion 3 6 month . At inclusion end study participant complete QOL questionnaire , AF-QOL-18 AFEQT , questionnaire lifestyle , heart symptom , risk factor , medical treatment sickness absence , , visit GP due AFLI hospital admission . The resource consumption individual participant regularly record . Instructors physiotherapists record total time consumption ( preparation confrontation time ) well patient ' total time consumption ( transportation time education/exercise . Furthermore , travel expense relation rehabilitation record . In addition patient complete questionnaire lifestyle ( Euroqol eq-5d ) inclusion 1 , 3 , 6 twelve month , respectively , use cost-benefit analysis . Data visit GP collect Danish Health Insurance Registry end study .</detailed_description>
