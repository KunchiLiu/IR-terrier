	<brief_summary>Sensitivity specificity current screen method congenital cataract neonates poor . This result delay diagnosis management decrease visual prognosis follow cataract surgery . It also result many false positive resultant unnecessary healthcare cost specialist paediatric ophthalmology service . The investigator develop new digital technique improve accuracy screen congenital cataract study compare new test current test performed .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Choroidal Reflectance Camera Detection Congenital Cataracts</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>All baby bear United Kingdom undergo eye screen birth 6-8 week enable early diagnosis management congenital cataract , treatable potentially blind condition affect 1 2000 newborn . The current technique involve assessment `` red reflex '' - orange/red glow pupil see ophthalmoscopy ( flash photography ) due reflectance light back eye . In reality , test technically difficult pupil constricts light examination , particularly baby Asian Afro-Caribbean ancestry , red-reflex dim due effect ocular pigmentation . As result le 50 % congenital cataract currently identify screening . Early visual experience require good visual development delay surgical management cataract result sub-optimal visual development visual impairment . The neonatal congenital cataract screen test perform range healthcare professional include nurse , midwife doctor . The investigator develop new digital camera image system base modify mobile phone improve detection choroidal reflectance , improve pick rate cataract congenital eye malformation allow documentation examination telemedicine digital image . The investigator predict facilitate screening improve early detection management congenital cataract worldwide .</detailed_description>
