	<brief_title>Morbidity Open Versus Minimally Invasive Esophagectomy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Esophageal resection still associate considerable morbidity mortality . Standardized preoperative effort could increase outcome patient . While early report medical pioneer focus particularly safety feasibility , recent study show implementation minimally invasive esophagectomy ( MIE ) widely accept . Since first report MIE , different technique adjustment discuss . A recent publication large prospective trial Phase II show safety total minimally invasive approach ( video assist thoracoscopic surgery ( VATS ) laparoscopy ) . Surgical technique however still subject debate level evidence remain still low . Proving feasibility warrant paradigm shift , experience important factor safety patient benefit . The aim study evaluate morbidity mortality open esophagectomy ( OE ) versus hybrid-MIE randomized control setting . Prior surgery patient randomize either minimally invasive surgery group ( laparoscopic gastric tube formation thoracotomy ) open surgery group ( open gastric tube formation open laparotomy approach ) .
