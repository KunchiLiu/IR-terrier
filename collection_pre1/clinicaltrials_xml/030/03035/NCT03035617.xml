	<brief_title>Study Evaluate Reduction Pain After Laparoscopic Hernia Repair With Mesh Soaked Bupivacaine Solution</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>INTRODUCTION : Laparoscopic approach uncomplicated ventral hernia repair compare open repair advantage less post operative pain , less rate wound infection , , early recovery , shorten hospital stay less overall cost treatment , , . Patient satisfaction laparoscopic procedure well compare open repair . Recurrence rate also know less laparoscopic repair compare open repair . Despite , laparoscopic approach utilized quarter patient ventral hernia develop country , . Early post-operative pain discomfort laparoscopic repair remain concern patient require hospital stay parenteral narcotic analgesic . Intensity pain similar regardless method fixation mesh . This quite often prove hindrance early ambulation , enhance patient discomfort prevents early discharge hospital . Early post-operative pain think secondary dissection area mesh application . Local application anesthetic agent area potentially overcome problem make procedure feasible ambulatory care operation . Local anesthetic infiltration wound site various procedure know effective reduce immediate post-operative pain , . In case laparoscopic ventral hernia repair , deliver local anesthetic site mesh application achieve soak mesh local anesthetic solution application . Bupivacaine long act local anesthetic . Results study use class drug intra-peritonealy type surgery analgesic purpose show safe intra-operative use . To date evidence regard impact soak mesh bupivacaine solution application case laparoscopic ventral hernia repair . These patient require post operative intravenous analgesic agent deal early post operative pain . If turns effective intervention , improve patient satisfaction early discharge hospital . This also potentially reduce cost care . OBJECTIVE : Primary Objective : To evaluate impact impregnate mesh .5 % bupivacaine solution compare normal saline solution post-operative pain laparoscopic ventral hernia repair . Secondary Objective : To evaluate impact impregnate mesh .5 % bupivacaine solution compare saline solution length hospital stay laparoscopic ventral hernia repair . Study Question : Does impregnate mesh solution .5 % bupivacaine application laparoscopic ventral hernia repair result significant reduction post-operative pain ? Null Hypothesis : Post-operative pain Impregnating mesh application laparoscopic ventral hernia repair 20 ml 0.5 % bupivacaine solution either compare post-operative pain impregnate mesh 20ml 0.9 % saline solution . Alternate Hypothesis : Post-operative pain Impregnating mesh application laparoscopic ventral hernia repair 20ml 0.5 % bupivacaine solution less compare post-operative pain impregnate mesh 20ml 0.9 % saline solution . Population : Target Population : Patients un-complicated ventral abdominal wall hernia plan undergo laparoscopic repair . Study Population : Patients uncomplicated ventral abdominal wall hernia present general surgery clinic Aga Khan University Hospital ( AKUH ) Karachi plan laparoscopic hernia repair . Study Sample : Patients uncomplicated ventral abdominal wall hernia present general surgery clinic AKUH Karachi plan undergo laparoscopic repair meet eligibility criterion inclusion trial . Randomization Technique : Block randomization do . Blocks size 10 participant make . In block randomization do use computer generate random number . Allocations block write card enclose envelops . For block envelops shuffle numbered sequence . All envelops prepare sealed start trial clinical trial unit . Trial monitoring do clinical trial unit . Emergency break code do physician case demand treatment patient . SAMPLE SIZE : Sample size calculate use World Health Organization ( WHO ) software sample size calculation . Muyosoms F et al 2013 report pain laparoscopic ventral hernia repair various mesh fixation technique visual analogue scale range 0-10 . They report pain fixation tacker 4.4 +/- 2.3 four hour . It hypothesize bupivacaine soakage mesh reduce pain least third compare soakage saline . A minimum 44 patient require group keep level significance 5 % power study 90 % . Anticipating 10 % loss follow , plan include 50 patient group . SETTINGS : Study conduct General Surgery Section Aga Khan University Hospital , Karachi . Patients evaluate clinic time presentation regard eligibility participate study . Written inform consent take clinic . A copy consent form hand patient . Clinical Trial Unit inform schedule date time operation . Allocation do staff clinical trial unit keep undisclosed investigator , patient outcome assessor . Clinical Trial Unit provide solution soak mesh cod form accord treatment arm allocation . After operation first assessment pain do six hour post-operatively use VAS . Second assessment do twenty four hour end operation . This assessment do directly patient admit hospital do telephone patient discharge home . RECRUITMENT DURATION : It expect complete recruitment require sample size one half year start trial . Operative Procedure : Laparoscopic ventral hernia repair perform general anesthesia . Laparoscopic approach repair ventral hernia institution involve trans-abdominal approach three laparoscopic port insert one side abdomen . Dual mesh apply anterior abdominal wall reduce hernia content . Mesh soak saline insertion peritoneal cavity ease handling . Mesh apply use metallic tack . Trial Monitoring : Bupivacaine long act local anesthetic drug . Though minimum toxic dose bupivacaine intra-peritoneal use define , analgesic effect intra-peritoneal use especially laparoscopic cholecystectomy assess several interventional study . Intra-peritoneal use 50ml .25 % , , 20ml .5 % solution show drug relate adverse reaction . Known serious adverse reaction bupivacaine use local anesthetic due high serum concentration use , commonly see accidental administration directly blood vessel . These report effect central nervous system like seizure convulsion cardiac effect like arrhythmias heart block . These adverse reaction note 1:1000 case . Time onset adverse effect range second one hour . These adverse effect monitor one hour surgery operating room recovery room . In case adverse effect encounter , management do accord standard resuscitation protocol institution . Any adverse effect report Ethical Review Committee early encounter maximum seven day event . FOLLOW UP : Pain assessment do use visual analogue scale ( VAS ) . This validate score measure level pain . It range zero ten . Score 0 mean pain score ten mean bad pain one ever . Score assess 6 24 hour procedure . ANALYSIS PLAN : Intention treat analysis do . Quantitative variable include VAS score report mean +/- standard deviation median +/- interquartile range . Qualitative variable report percentage . Univariable linear regression do assess linear association VAS score predictor variable include use bupivacaine . Multiple variable linear regression analysis do evaluate true effect intervention , adjust time assessment amount analgesia use . P value le 0.2 consider Univariate level predictor variable include multiple variable linear regression analysis . Possible effect modifier like pre-operative pain amount dissection analyze report present . Interim Analysis : One interim analysis conduct mid trial . At time interim analysis , criterion stop trial define p value le 0.025 outcome interest less .05 adverse event like side effect bupivacaine power 80 % . Linear Regression analysis do adjust confounders effect modifier . Data Management : Data collect preform printed questionnaire . Each questionnaire information data operation medical record number identifier . Questionnaires anonymized identifiable information store . Hard copy keep lock key research office Department Surgery . Data enter statistical software SPSS version 19 . SPSS file password protect . Data store till 15 year completion study . ETHICAL CONSIDERATIONS : Approval take Ethical Review Committee . Informed consent take participant . Cost bupivacaine provide study fund .</detailed_description>
