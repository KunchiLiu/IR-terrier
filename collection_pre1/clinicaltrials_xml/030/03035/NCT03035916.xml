	<brief_summary>This study evaluate effect transversus abdominis plane ( TAP ) block combine general anesthesia perioperative stress response patient undergoing radical gastrectomy . One third participant receive TAP block combine general anesthesia , another one third participant receive epidural anesthesia combine general anesthesia , rest receive general anesthesia .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Transversus Abdominis Plane Block Stress Response</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Clinically , combine epidural general anaesthesia may confer many advantage patient undergo major thoracic , abdominal orthopaedic surgery . Epidural anaesthesia attenuate sympathetic hyperactivity stress response , maintain bowel peristalsis , spare use opioids , facilitate postoperative feeding physiotherapy . However , establish epidural anesthesia without risk contraindication , include refusal patient , technical failure , unintentional dural puncture , waist back pain local anaesthetic toxicity . When neurologic complication occur , result morbidity mortality considerable . Transversus abdominis plane ( TAP ) block , another new regional anesthesia technique , introduce abdominal wall block capable provide effective analgesia , reduce opioid consumption , lessen opioid-related side effect . In addition , TAP block , somewhat pre-emptive analgesia approach , way pain intervention noxious stimulation report potent attenuate stress response . Although analgesia efficiency TAP block widely study , effectiveness suppress stress response little comparison classic epidural block general anesthesia . Unlike epidural anaesthesia , TAP block easy administer low incidence side-effects.The investigator hypothesize TAP block reduces stress response surgery similar extent epidural anaesthesia combine standard general anaesthesia abdominal surgery .</detailed_description>
