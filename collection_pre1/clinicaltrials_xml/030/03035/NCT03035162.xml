	<brief_title>Dual-hemisphere Transcranial Direct Current Stimulation Lower Limb Motor Functions After Stroke</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Stroke lead cause adult motor disability . The recovery motor function stroke often incomplete , despite classical rehabilitation technique . In begin 21th century , transcranial direct current stimulation ( tDCS ) introduce non-invasive tool reversibly modulate brain excitability human device sends constant low direct current ( DC ) deliver area interest electrode . These finding open way therapeutic use brain stimulation stroke . Based polarity-specific effect , anodal tDCS increase cortical excitability cathodal tDCS decrease cortical excitability . To change cortical excitability , tDCS differs brain stimulation technique transcranial magnetic stimulation ( TMS ) cause action potential cortical neuron , rather induce shifts neuronal rest membrane potential . This consider induce less risk seizure . Given advantage non-invasiveness , painlessness , safety , possible after-effects , tDCS rapidly become therapeutic adjuvant neurorehabilitation especially stroke patient motor deficit . A number study healthy subject stroke patient report tDCS-induced excitability change related increase performance motor task motor skill learn , mainly upper limb function Recenty , dual-hemisphere tDCS , excite one hemisphere use anodal stimulation inhibits cathodal stimulation describe healthy subject great enhance hand motor learning compare uni-hemisphere tDCS . The corresponding tDCS-induced change report image study involve interhemispheric interaction . An increase excitability unaffected hemisphere abnormally high interhemispheric inhibition ( IHI ) drive intact lesioned hemisphere widely report unilateral stroke . Dual-tDCS recent use rehabilitation aim reduce inhibition exert unaffected hemisphere affect hemisphere restore normal balance IHI . Dual-tDCS combine train simultaneous occupational/physical therapy report improve motor skill learn function paretic upper limb chronic stroke patient . Lower-limb function commonly disorder stoke , however , less study focus effect tDCS lower limb function . A single session anodal tDCS lower limb M1 report acutely enhance effect motor practice paretic ankle , force production paretic knee extensor , postural stability chronic stroke patient . However , little known effect dual-tDCS low limb stroke patient . Only one recent study show improvement walk speed immediately single session dual-tDCS alone sub-acute stroke patient .</detailed_description>
