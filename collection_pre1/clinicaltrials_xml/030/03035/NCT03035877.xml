	<brief_summary>This study 's purpose examine effectiveness promise intervention emerge adult ( EAs ) alcohol drug ( AOD ) abuse justice involvement achieve ultimate outcome reduce criminal activity . The study also examine effect intermediate outcome follow : 1 ) reduce AOD use ; 2 ) great gainful activity ( increase educational success , employment housing stability ; decrease antisocial peer involvement relationship conflict ) ; 3 ) great improvement self-regulation ( self-efficacy , goal directedness responsibility take ) .

	<brief_title>Multisystemic Therapy-Emerging Adults ( MST-EA ) Substance Abuse</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Prevalence alcohol drug ( AOD ) abuse criminal activity high emerge adulthood compare developmental period , cause extraordinary cost society . Emerging Adults ( EAs ; age 17-21 ) AOD abuse great incarceration rate EAs without AOD abuse , AOD-abusing offender significantly recidivism , severe offending , incarceration offender . Such serious behavior interferes successful transition adulthood area school completion , employment housing . Thus , strong public health need effective treatment reduce AOD abuse justice involvement EAs . Surprisingly , intervention establish efficacy reduce criminal activity among EAs , without AOD abuse . Among young adolescent , comprehensive cause antisocial behavior address effective intervention ( e.g. , Multisystemic Therapy [ MST ] ; Treatment Foster Care Oregon [ TFCO ] ) , present investigative team develop evaluate well-defined age-tailored intervention EAs criminal behavior . The developed intervention adaptation MST integrate skill coach component TFCO , well-established effective juvenile justice intervention . Initial MST-EA research focus justice-involved young adult mental health problem , high-risk subpopulation offender , AOD abuse quickly become primary problem MST-EA team treat . As single-source intervention , MST-EA target EA correlate criminal activity AOD abuse , include gainful EA activity ( positive relationship , school , work , housing ) reduce AOD abuseâ€”in part target proximal mechanism poor self-regulation . In successfully complete community-based open trial , safety , feasibility , preliminary efficacy intervention establish . The propose study evaluate effectiveness MST-EA reduce justice involvement AOD abuse . EAs ( n = 240 ) AOD abuse justice involvement ( recent arrest release justice facility ) randomize receive MST-EA Enhanced Treatment Usual ( E-TAU ) . Assessments complete month 0 , 2 , 4 , 6 , 8 , 12 , 16 , confirmation outcome data use collateral report official record . Aims evaluate effect time MST-EA reduce AOD abuse criminal activity , well evaluate effect MST-EA key proximal target treatment ( self-regulation ) intermediate outcome treatment ( gainful activity ) . A final aim study investigate direct effect treatment criminal activity mediate effect self-regulation , AOD abuse , gainful activity . In specific age group , complete absence AOD abuse recidivism reduction treatment demonstrate effectiveness . The ultimate effect propose research would decrease AOD abuse justice involvement high-risk population , well improve outcome significant societal impact ( e.g. , reduce homelessness unemployment ) .</detailed_description>
