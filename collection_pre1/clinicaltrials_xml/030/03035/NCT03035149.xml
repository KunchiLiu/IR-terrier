	<brief_summary>Dyspnea common complaint obese patient . The mechanism behind dyspnea effect weight loss dyspnea completely understood . The objective study examine relationship exercise parameter dyspnea obesity ass effect weight loss . The investigator compare pulmonary function , exercise performance dyspnea 34 patient abdominal obesity metabolic syndrome ( MS ) 34 age sex-matched control . The study also assess within-group change physiology symptom subset patient follow participation weight management program . Because obesity heterogeneous condition , variable genetic association , co-morbidities distribution adipose tissue , study focus patient abdominal obesity meet diagnostic criterion metabolic syndrome .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The study two part : first , investigator compare dyspnea , pulmonary function exercise measurement obese patient control subject normal weight ; , investigator assess effect medical weight loss obese group parameter . Baseline dyspnea assess use baseline dyspnea index.The effect weight loss dyspnea assess use transitional dyspnea index . The main physiologic measurement interest inspiratory capacity ( L , measure rest exercise ) .</detailed_description>
