	<brief_summary>This phase I/II trial study best dose side effect dendritic cell therapy , cryosurgery pembrolizumab treat patient non-Hodgkin lymphoma . Vaccines , dendritic cell therapy make person 's tumor cell white blood cell may help body build effective immune response kill tumor cell . Cryosurgery kill cancer cell freeze . Monoclonal antibody , pembrolizumab , may interfere ability tumor cell grow spread . Giving dendritic cell therapy , cryosurgery pembrolizumab may work good treat non-Hodgkin lymphoma .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . Evaluate optimal dose schedule , safety tolerability measure incidence significant toxicity combination therapy anti-PD-1 monoclonal antibody , cryoablation , intra-tumor injection autologous dendritic cell cryoablated tumor . ( Phase I ) II . Test efficacy ( overall response rate ) combination therapy anti-PD-1 monoclonal antibody , cryoablation , intra-tumor injection autologous dendritic cell vaccine . ( Phase II ) SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . Evaluate feasibility combination immunotherapy . ( Phase I ) II . Evaluate patient quality life . ( Phase I ) III . Evaluate partial response ( PR ) complete response ( CR ) rate combination immunotherapy . ( Phase II ) IV . Evaluate progression free survival , treatment free survival , duration response , disease-free rate 2 year , overall survival combination immunotherapy . ( Phase II ) V. Evaluate safety combination immunotherapy . ( Phase II ) TERTIARY OBJECTIVES : I. Assess effect combination immunotherapy patient ' immune status anti-tumor immune response . II . Assess potential association PD-1/PD-L1/PD-L2 expression tumor blood clinical efficacy . III . Assess potential association tumor antigen mutation antigen-specific immune response clinical efficacy . IV . Evaluate patient quality life . OUTLINE : This phase I , dose-escalation study follow phase II study . Patients receive pembrolizumab intravenously ( IV ) day 1 . Treatment repeat every 21 day 18 course absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . Patients also receive dendritic cell therapy intratumorally ( IT ) day 2 , 8 , 15 course 2 3 , day 2 course 4 5 . Patients undergo cryosurgery day 2 course 2 receive pneumococcal 13-valent conjugate vaccine injection day 2 course 2-5 . Treatment repeat every 21 day 5 course absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . After completion study treatment , patient follow every 4 month second year post-treatment , every 6 month 2 year .</detailed_description>
