	<brief_title>Neoadjuvant Listeria Daratumumab Prostate Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Study Drug Administration : If find eligible take part study , receive daratumumab vein 1 hour 1 time week Weeks 1- 4 . Length Study : You may receive 4 dos daratumumab . You longer able take study drug disease get bad , intolerable side effect occur , unable follow study direction . Your participation study Week 18 visit . Study Visits : Daratumumab treatment interfere blood type test need blood transfusion give . For reason , test find blood type perform receive daratumumab . You carry blood type card . During Weeks 1 4 : - You physical exam - Blood ( 2 tablespoon ) draw routine blood typing . During Weeks 2 3 : - You physical exam . - Blood ( 2 tablespoon ) draw routine test blood type testing . During Week 6 ( week surgery ) : - You physical exam - Blood ( 2 tablespoon ) draw routine test , include measurement PSA testosterone level . Part sample also use blood type test . - You surgery remove prostate . You sign separate consent form explain procedure risk detail . During Week 12 , blood ( 2 tablespoon ) draw routine test , include measurement PSA testosterone level . Follow-Up : At Week 18 , come clinic ask side effect . This investigational study . Daratumumab FDA approve commercially available treat multiple myeloma ( MM ) . It consider investigational use daratumumab patient prostate cancer . The study doctor explain study drug design work . Up 15 participant take part study . All enrol MD Anderson .</detailed_description>
