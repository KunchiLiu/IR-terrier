	<brief_summary>In pilot study , investigator determine response natriuretic peptide ( NP ) hormone system dose intravenous dexamethasone ( steroid medication ) . The goal propose project generate preliminary data use develop power calculation , inform cutoff range , inform time NP response large subsequent study aim develop diagnostic test `` NP deficiency , '' important implication cardiometabolic risk . The investigator propose pilot study 10 healthy lean individual . Aim : To determine range distribution time course natriuretic peptide ( NP ) responses single dose dexamethasone IV 4 mg healthy lean individual . Hypothesis : Determination NP response ( range time course change NP level ) dexamethasone 10 healthy individual inform time course frequency blood sample definitive prospective study design understand diagnostic values/cutoffs diagnostic test , well enable investigator perform sample size calculation definitive prospective study .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The cardiac natriuretic peptide ( NP ) system may protect development cardiometabolic risk . The classical action natriuretic peptide include natriuresis , vasodilation , inhibition renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system ( RAAS ) , support key role hormone blood pressure regulation . There accumulate biological evidence NPs wide range favorable metabolic effect well , include reduce fat accumulation , activation brown fat , improve glucose tolerance . These result suggest NPs may help protect cardiometabolic risk . Despite propensity hypertension hypervolemia , obese individual reduce NP levels.1,2 Low NP level may reflect `` deficiency '' obese person , oppose appropriate response cardiovascular stimulus . Such deficiency could deleterious impact cardiometabolic risk , create `` vicious cycle '' obese individual increase susceptibility fat accumulation glucose intolerance via impaired NP production . As state , NP hormone may protect cardiometabolic risk . Large epidemiologic study show rest NP level low certain group individual . However , difficult say certain whether low resting level NPs reflect true `` deficiency , '' low NP level may biologically appropriate certain situation ( e.g . individual volume deplete ) . At time , test diagnose `` NP deficiency . '' Studies animal suggest glucocorticoid potently stimulate NP production . There limited study human show glucocorticoid stimulate NP production ; however , NP response specifically dexamethasone , glucocorticoid show animal data potently stimulate NP production , define human . Moreover , range normal response glucocorticoid healthy individual well-defined . Understanding range normal response important first step develop diagnostic tool detect NP deficiency . The investigator propose pilot study characterize NP response ( range NP level , time course response ) dexamethasone healthy control . This data use develop power calculation inform cutoff range future study aim develop diagnostic test `` NP deficiency . '' Developing test diagnose NP deficiency could potentially important clinical implication understand cardiometabolic risk .</detailed_description>
