	<brief_summary>This Phase I study open label multiple ascend dose evaluation safety PK oxfendazole give orally daily healthy adult men nonpregnant woman age 18-45 follow single dose cross trial evaluate safety pharmacokinetics single dose oxfendazole give follow 8 hour fast follow high fat meal . The study duration approximately 12 month subject participation last approximately 6 week . In first phase study , 8 24 subject enrol ; dose group comprise 8 volunteer . To enhance safety , one sentinel subject dose five day monitor 7 day time first dose predefined adverse event . If predefined safety event , second sentinel subject enrol follow total 7 day . If predefined safety signal identify either two sentinel subject , remain subject group enrol . After eight subject complete 10 day follow period , safety review electronic data perform . If none predefined safety event occur DMID approve enrollment second dose group monitor total 7 day predefined adverse event prior enrol remain subject group . After 10 day follow period complete group 2 , safety review complete predefined event occur two sequential subject enrol third dose group monitor total 7 day predefined safety event prior enrol remain subject group . In second phase study evaluate effect food drug absorption , 12 subject enrol single dose cross study half subject initially receive single dose oxfendazole follow 8 hour fast half receive single dose oxfendazole follow high fat meal . Subjects cross receive single dose follow high fat breakfast fasting period . All subject receive dose oxfendazole follow fasting period meal . The primary objective : 1 ) To assess safety oxfendazole administer daily five day ; 2 ) To assess safety oxfendazole administer single dose without food .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>This Phase I study open label multiple ascend dose evaluation safety PK oxfendazole ( 3 , 7.5 , 15 mg/kg ) give orally daily healthy adult men nonpregnant woman age 18-45 follow single dose cross trial evaluate safety pharmacokinetics single dose oxfendazole ( 3 mg/kg ) give follow 8 hour fast follow high fat meal . The study duration approximately 12 month subject participation last approximately 6 week . In first phase Phase I study , 8 24 subject enrol ; dose group comprise eight volunteer . . To enhance safety , one sentinel subject dose five day monitor 7 day time first dose predefined adverse event . If predefined safety event , second sentinel subject enrol follow total 7 day . If predefined safety signal identify either two sentinel subject , remain subject group enrol . After eight subject complete 10 day follow period , electronic safety review electronic data perform . If none predefined safety event occur DMID approve enrollment second dose group ( 7.5 mg/kg oxfendazole daily x 5 day ) monitor total 7 day predefined adverse event prior enrol remain subject group . After 10 day follow period complete group 2 , electronic safety review complete predefined event occur two sequential subject ( one time 7 day subject ) enrol third dose group ( 15 mg/kg oxfendazole daily x 5 day ) monitor total 7 day predefined safety event prior enrol remain subject group . In second phase study evaluate effect food drug absorption , 12 subject enrol single dose cross study half subject initially receive single dose 3 mg/kg oxfendazole follow 8 hour fast half receive single dose 3 mg/kg oxfendazole follow high fat meal . Subjects cross receive single dose follow high fat breakfast fasting period ( water permit ) . All subject receive dose oxfendazole follow fasting period meal . The primary objective : 1 ) To assess safety oxfendazole administer daily five day ; 2 ) To assess safety oxfendazole administer single dose without food . The secondary objective : 1 ) To define multi-dose kinetics oxfendazole ; 2 ) To determine effect food kinetics oxfendazole .</detailed_description>
