	<detailed_description>BACKGROUND : Each year , approximately 1.6 million people diagnosed cancer relative 5-year survival rate across cancer type approach 70 % . As 2014 , almost 15 million Americans live history cancer . Cancer survivor face variety health care need , include surveillance recurrence , treatment long-term late effect cancer treatment , general primary preventive care , management comorbidities , encouragement healthy lifestyle behavior , attention psychosocial issue . In 2005 , Institute Medicine ( IOM ) report 'From Cancer Patient Cancer Survivor : Lost Transition ' highlighted challenge cancer survivor face transition acute treatment ( Hewitt , M. , Greenfield , S. , &amp; Stovall , E. , 2005 ) . The completion acute cancer treatment critical juncture patient need good support communication ensure optimal health quality life outcomes transition long-term survivorship . Cancer survivor face substantial deficiency quality care receive , include underuse recommend care overuse service recommend routine follow-up . The 2005 IOM report call patient complete acute treatment provide survivorship care plan ( SCP ) summarize treatment receive outline future healthcare priority order facilitate effective management health care survivor oncology primary care provider . STUDY PROCEDURES : The primary aim trial ass whether difference among three SCP model vary level resource intensity patient ' receipt recommend health service month follow completion acute treatment . We conduct randomize controlled trial ( RCT ) measure whether provision SCP survivor PCP associate survivor ' receipt cancer follow-up care outline SCP ( primary outcome ) . Avoidance non-recommended care , receipt recommend primary preventive care , patient-reported outcome measure serve secondary endpoint . Participants RCT treat breast , prostate , colorectal cancer . This RCT conduct four oncology clinic two medical system . We enroll survivor Stage I-III breast , prostate , colorectal cancer complete treatment transition long-term survivorship , use stratify randomization assign participant one three study condition ( Arms A , B C ) . This study focus specifically period follow completion acute treatment ( e.g. , surgery , radiation , chemotherapy ) ; patient receive long-term adjuvant endocrine/antibody therapy also eligible . The propose trial conduct Johns Hopkins Medical Institution ( JHMI ) Peninsula Regional Medical Center ( PRMC ) . JHMI large , academic medical center urban set distinct treatment program base disease site . At JHMI , recruit Breast Cancer Program , Genitourinary Cancer Program ( prostate cancer ) , Gastrointestinal Cancer Program ( colorectal cancer ) . These program operate across discipline ( e.g. , medical , radiation , surgical oncology ) separately , enable evaluation 3 separate clinical setting within JHMI . In addition , trial include PRMC Richard A. Henson Cancer Institute , community cancer program locate rural area Maryland 's eastern shore . At PRMC single general oncology practice . The four program differ extent survivorship care plan already part routine care . As yet , none clinic study consistent format delivery SCP universally completion acute treatment . Our study design ( cancer type , clinical system SCP model ) intend enable development real-world best practice implementation SCPs ass whether consistent vary across wide range clinical context survivor characteristic . Each participant follow 18 month , number visit dependent randomization arm ( describe ) . We abstract 18 month follow-up data enrol patient medical record , well patient report health service use ; data collect month 6 , 12 , 18 . We obtain abstract medical record guide information summary document ( see Health Services Use Summary include supplemental study document ) patient use provide tracking tool provider see , test undergone , etc . ( see Tip Sheet supplemental study document ) . Patient-reported outcome collect baseline , 6 , 12 , 18 month primarily via REDCap form , telephone in-person data collection back-up need .</detailed_description>
