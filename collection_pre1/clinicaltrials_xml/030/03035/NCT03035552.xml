	<detailed_description>Randomized controlled trial Improve Oral Feeding Outcomes Infants Complex Congenital heart disease use Pacifier Activated Device-Training Mother 's Voice Specific Aims Infants complex congenital heart disease ( CCHD ) high rate delay impaired oral feeding skill , associate neurodevelopmental problem worse motor language outcomes early childhood . The acquisition efficient suck strength pattern essential promote later optimal oral feeding . Therefore , ineffective non-nutritive suck ( NNS ) , one early feeding milestone , result later maladaptive oral motor skill even oro-sensory aversion . Evidence-based intervention lack CCHD infant hospitalize Cardiothoracic Intensive Care Unit ( CTICU ) improve early oral feeding pattern promote acquisition later developmental milestone . NNS training ( oppose simply offer pacifier ) safely improve oral feed strength rate high-risk population , preterm infant , even suffer severe neural insult . This type training use operant condition positive stimulus reinforce learn establishment functional pathway low high order neural network . Furthermore , NNS training associate acquisition essential developmental milestone first year . The investigator propose follow hypothesis : Intensive NNS-contingent training use reinforcement mother 's voice improve oral feeding outcome infant CCHD . They hypothesize establishment optimal NNS first 6 month improve feed developmental outcome one year age . To test hypothesis , investigator propose randomize controlled trial ( RCT ) CCHD infant hospitalize surgical repair . Because propose intervention demonstrate positive effect high-risk infant , study use wait-list design : CCHD infant receive intervention surgery receive , entire cohort eventually benefit intervention . The intervention utilize Pacifier Activated Music Player ( PAM ) sensor detect change suck pressure pattern , speaker contingently deliver mother 's voice , infant 0-6 month CTICU . Quantitative oral feeding metric intervention , well , immediately discharge use measure efficacy . Secondly , assess impact NNS training developmental milestone acquisition , standardize feeding neurodevelopmental assessment trial infant 12 month age Follow-Up clinic also conduct . Randomization account difference CCHD diagnose know impact outcome . The study design control type surgical procedure proxy severity illness exposure anesthesia variable associate neurodevelopment maternal education prematurity . Aim 1 A : Compare oral feeding skill measure suck strength , rate burst pattern CCHD infant vs. without NNS train use PAM/mother 's voice prior surgery , RCT design . Aim 1 B : Correlate improvement oral feed skill NNS train PAM/mother 's voice entire study cohort high score standardize feed questionnaire 1 month discharge . Aim 2 : Demonstrate improvement oral feed skill CTICU correlate good neurodevelopmental outcome measure standardized score Bayley Scales Infant Toddler Development ( BSID III ) 12 month . This study hold significant public health relevance validates inexpensive , parent-centered rehabilitative strategy infant high-risk impaired oral feeding skill , device approach easily adapt many level CCHD care potential improve longer-term neurodevelopment .</detailed_description>
