	<brief_summary>The estimate annual cost dementia Canada $ 15 billion , project cumulative economic burden $ 800 billion 2038 . Effective prevention dementia population level need include lifestyle factor promote high level physical activity . Physical inactivity modifiable risk factor Alzheimer disease ( AD ) cognitive decline , mechanisms physical activity exert protective effect brain remain unknown . Motivated need develop strategy prevent treat AD relate dementia ( ADRD ) , investigator ' overall research goal discover age brain develop ADRD . To achieve goal investigator adopt translational physiology approach ( i.e. , study physiology molecule/cell population ) investigate exercise improve cognitive performance , underlie mechanism exercise prevent and/or slow age-related decline brain health cognition . This approach allow investigator determine physiological function relate ADRD , important implication health . The investigator ' prior work demonstrate significant relationship fitness , vascular regulation cognition old adult free overt disease . These finding implication vascular cognitive impairment ADRD , hypoperfusion dysregulation cerebral blood flow think important pathophysiological factor . The investigator ' central hypothesis regular aerobic exercise mitigate age-related decrease vascular function cerebrovascular reserve , turn benefit cognition . Work investigator others provide necessary data justify randomize controlled trial evaluate role exercise prevention ADRD . The investigator well equip undertake trial ; investigator dedicate institutional support necessary expertise vascular regulation , cognition , age , neuroimaging genetics . The overall objective proposal test exercise intervention secondary prevention ADRD adults 50 80 year old increase risk ADRD ( memory impairment symptom without dementia ) . The rationale trial urgent need dementia prevention : exercise intervention , harness translational physiology framework , hold promise . The investigator conduct trial determine effect aerobic exercise development age-associated cognitive decline dementia . The exercise intervention design input Alberta Health Services , universal healthcare provider Albertans , intervention readily adopt clinical practice trial successful . The trial address three specific aim . SPECIFIC AIM 1 : Determine independent effect exercise cognitive performance previously inactive old adult increase risk ADRD . The investigator hypothesize participant randomize six-month aerobic exercise intervention perform well cognitive test , compare control participant randomize stretching-toning exercise group . SPECIFIC AIM 2 : Determine underlie biological mechanism influence cognitive performance exercise training . The investigator hypothesize exercise improve cognition due change molecular/cellular ( biomarkers ) , vascular ( cerebral blood flow , cerebrovascular reserve ) , anatomical functional ( neuroimaging ) , behavioural ( sleep quality ) level . Further , investigator hypothesize ADRD-specific genetic risk score , reflective target genetic variant , moderate exercise-related cognitive brain outcome . SPECIFIC AIM 3 : Determine extent change cognition , rest cerebral blood flow cerebrovascular reserve persist 12 month participant complete 6-month exercise training intervention . The investigator hypothesize effect improve aerobic fitness maintain time function persistent lifestyle change behavioural support program . This trial provide evidence need make clinical recommendation exercise program adult risk ADRD , goal prevent dementia . Given investigator ' extensive stakeholder input , intervention easily translate jurisdiction . This research mechanisms effect exercise identify patient subgroup likely benefit , surrogate outcome marker use future trial refine intervention dose/duration , new therapeutic target future intervention .</brief_summary>
