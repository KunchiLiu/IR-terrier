	<brief_title>Efficacy Safety Vedolizumab Intravenous ( IV ) Treatment Primary Sclerosing Cholangitis Subjects With Underlying Inflammatory Bowel Disease</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The drug test study call vedolizumab . Vedolizumab test treat people non-end-stage primary sclerosing cholangitis ( PSC ) underlie inflammatory bowel disease ( IBD ) . This study look change fibrosis stag people take vedolizumab . The study enroll approximately 258 patient . Participants randomly assign ( chance , like flip coin ) one three treatment group ratio 1:1:1—which remain undisclosed patient study doctor study ( unless urgent medical need ) : - Vedolizumab 300 mg every 4 week ( Q4W ) - Vedolizumab 300 mg every 8 week ( Q8W ) - Placebo ( dummy inactive pill ) - tablet look like study drug active ingredient All participant administer vedolizumab placebo via intravenous infusion This multi-center trial conduct worldwide . The overall time participate study 124 week . Participants make multiple visit clinic contact telephone 6 month last dose study drug follow-up assessment .</detailed_description>
