	<brief_summary>Traumatic brain ( TBI ) injury major cause morbidity mortality worldwide especially population 40 year age significant socioeconomic impact . TBI result head impact object acceleration/deceleration force produce vigorous movement brain within skull , resultant mechanical force potentially damage neurones blood vessel cause irreversible , primary brain injury . Primary injury lead activation cellular molecular response lead disruption blood-brain barrier cause brain swell . As intracranial space expandable ( i.e . fix ) , swell lead increase intracranial pressure ( ICP ) compromise blood supply rest brain lead secondary brain injury . As unable reverse primary injury , current protocol use supportive measure control ICP ensure optimal blood supply brain attempt minimize secondary injury . Our understanding factor involve initiation propagation brain swell TBI grow role neuroinflammatory cytokine process increasingly recognize . In preclinical model TBI , specific inflammatory cytokine term substance P ( SP ) find associate blood-brain barrier disruption development brain oedema immediate phase follow injury . The aim study examine role SP genesis cerebral oedema elevation ICP thus secondary injury follow human TBI . This would achieve block SP function SP receptor antagonist Fosaprepitant ( IVEMENDÂ® , Merck ) first 24 hour follow TBI continuously measure ICP assess evolvement TBI use magnetic resonance imaging .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>All severe traumatic brain injury patient admit Cambridge University Hospital 's Neurosciences Critical Care Unit require insertion triple bolt multimodal neuromonitoring ( intracranial pressure-ICP , microdialysis-MD brain tissue oxygen partial pressure-PbtO2 ) screen participation study . Eligible patient initial MRI scan first 24 hour injury . Following , within 24 hour injury , IVAMEND ( intravenous formulation NK-1 antagonist fosaprepitant ) administer dose 300 mg , intravenously 1 hour . Patients follow MRI scan 24 hour follow IVAMEND administration . Continuous ICP PbtO2 monitoring well hourly microdialysis sample start immediately follow insertion monitor least 6 hour continue least 12 hour IVAMEND administration . ICP continue monitor continuously 5 day follow administration IVAMEND . Microdialysis sample collect period 6 hour 12 hour administration Fosaprepitant store consequently use measure concentration Substance P , nitric oxide ( NO ) inflammatory cytokine .</detailed_description>
