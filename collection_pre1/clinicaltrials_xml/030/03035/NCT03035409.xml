	<brief_title>Effects Anamorelin Cancer-Related-Fatigue</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Baseline Tests : If screening procedure pregnancy test ( applicable ) participant find eligible take part study , participant ask : - Participant physical exam . - Blood ( 1 teaspoon ) drawn cytokine test . Cytokines protein may affect immune system . - Participant complete 8 questionnaire participant 's symptom , emotional physical health , level fatigue , appetite , regular exercise habit . It take 40 minute complete questionnaire . - Participant meet exercise specialist discus participant 's current strength fitness level . - Participant complete 6-minute walk test participant time participant walk 100-foot loop many time participant . - Participant complete chair-stand test participant sit chair stand sit many time participant 30 second . - Participant participant 's rest energy expenditure ( REE ) measure see much oxygen participant use rest . To measure participant 's REE , participant hold device call calorimeter breathe mouthpiece 5 minute . - Participant participant 's body mass index ( BMI ) measure participant stand scale hold device 20 second . - Participant taught resistance exercise complete home . Study Drug Administration : Participant take anamorelin mouth 1 time day 6 week . Participant take anamorelin 1 cup ( 8 ounce ) water fast ( nothing eat drink except water ) overnight least 1 hour participant 's first meal day . Physical Activities : Participant ask complete resistance exercise walk program home 6 week also take anamorelin . Participant give accelerometer wear exercise 5 day study visit . An accelerometer small device measure participant 's physical activity . Participant clip accelerometer participant 's waistband belt . For resistance exercise , participant use color-coded tube 3 level resistance : light , moderate , hard . Participant begin 1 set 10-12 repetition light resistance progress 2 set 12 repetition participant get strong . Once participant master resistance level , participant move resistance participant 's strength endurance increase . Participant begin next level resistance 2 set 12 repetition . Participant complete exercise 3 day week least 48 hour session . For walk program , participant ask walk least 5 day per week . The study staff recommend long walk many time walk day . Participant wear pedometer time participant study . A pedometer device show number step participant take . Participant receive instruction use pedometer . Participant also receive diary record number step participant take day . Participant bring diary study visit . Length Study : Participant receive anamorelin perform physical activity 6 week . If participant doctor think participant 's best interest , participant may continue take study drug additional 6 week repeat study visit procedure . Participant longer able take study drug perform physical activity part study disease get bad , intolerable side effect occur , participant unable follow study direction . Participation study follow-up period . Study Visits : One ( 1 ) time week , participant call ask participant 's physical activity progress participant . These call last 10-15 minute time . On Days 8 , 15 , 21 , 29 , 36 , 43 , participant complete 8 questionnaire participant complete baseline . On Days 15 , 29 , 43 participant complete questionnaire symptom participant may . This questionnaire take 5 minute complete time . On Day 15 , participant meet exercise specialist discus participant 's physical activity progress . On Day 21 , participant meet dietitian nutrition counseling . If participant difficulty taste food , participant give zinc oxide amino acid take every day 4 week help increase participant 's appetite . On Days 29 43 , blood ( 1 tablespoon ) drawn routine cytokine testing , check participant 's liver function fast blood glucose level . On Day 43 : - Participant physical exam . - Participant complete physical performance test participant baseline . - Participant complete 2 questionnaire participant 's regular exercise habit participant 's symptoms treatment . It take 10 minute complete questionnaire . - Participant participant 's REE BMI measure . Follow-Up Period : About 4 week Day 43 visit , participant call member study staff ask participant 's health . This call last 10 minute . This investigational study . Anamorelin FDA approve commercially available . Its use combination physical activity investigational . The study doctor explain study drug design work . Up 38 participant enrol study . All take part MD Anderson .</detailed_description>
