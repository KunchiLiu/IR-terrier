	<detailed_description>Metabolic acidosis recovers wide range diseases - chronic kidney disease , nephrolithiasis , others - oral alkalinization could useful . Oral alkalinization could perform bicarbonate contain alkaline-based water drug therapy citrate . This therapeutic intervention say increase extracellular volume lead rise blood pressure , especially due amount daily sodium load . No prospective data publish clinical routine , study effect extracellular volume blood pressure control . Here , investigator propose follow patient oral alkalinization indicate : blood pressure , body weight , clinical evaluation extracellular compartment perform begin follow-up participant . Initial record data : age , gender , prescription ( indication , kind alkali therapy , volume duration ) , body weight , body length , clinical appreciation extracellular compartment , blood pressure , comorbidities , drug therapy , blood urine composition . The recorded follow-up : adherence treatment , body weight , body length , clinical appreciation extracellular compartment , blood pressure , adverse event , blood urine composition . The principal criterion evaluation variation extracellular compartment .</detailed_description>
