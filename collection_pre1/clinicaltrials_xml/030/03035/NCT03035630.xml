	<detailed_description>OUTLINE : This multi-center trial . Eligible subject randomize stratify one two arm : FIRST-LINE INVESTIGATIONAL TREATMENT ARM A : - Avelumab 10mg/kg intravenously ( IV ) Day 1 ( D1 ) Day 15 ( D15 ) every 28 day cycle document disease progression per Immune-related Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors ( irRECIST ) 1.1 SECOND-LINE INVESTIGATIONAL TREATMENT ARM A : - Following completion inter-line washout period minimum 2 week maximum 60 day ( discretion treat investigator ) subject receive : - Sunitinib 50 mg mouth ( po ) daily D1 D14 every 21 day cycle document disease progression per Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors ( RECIST ) 1.1 OR - Discontinue treatment FIRST-LINE INVESTIGATIONAL TREATMENT ARM B : - Sunitinib 50 mg po daily D1 D14 every 21 day cycle document disease progression per RECIST 1.1 SECOND-LINE INVESTIGATIONAL TREATMENT ARM B : - Following completion inter-line washout period minimum 2 week maximum 60 day ( discretion treat investigator ) subject receive : - Avelumab 10mg/kg IV D1 D15 every 28 day cycle document disease progression per irRECIST 1.1 OR - Discontinue treatment NOTE : Subjects experience disease progression end first-line treatment remove first-line treatment due toxicity personal decision , may also either receive second-line therapy monitor inter-line period progression ( may longer 60 day ) per discretion treat investigator . Radiological disease evaluation assessment complete every 12 week . To demonstrate adequate organ function , screen lab must obtain within 14 day prior registration : Hematological : - Absolute Neutrophil Count ( ANC ) ≥ 1.5 K/mm3 - Hemoglobin ( Hgb ) ≥ 9 g/dL - Platelets ≥ 100 K/ mm3 Renal : - Calculated creatinine clearance Cockcroft-Gault formula ≥ 40 ml/min Hepatic : - Bilirubin ≤ 1.5 × upper limit normal ( ULN ) - Aspartate aminotransferase ( AST ) ≤ 2.5 × ULN - Alanine aminotransferase ( ALT ) ≤ 2.5 × ULN Miscellaneous : - Urine/serum pregnancy test - Negative</detailed_description>
