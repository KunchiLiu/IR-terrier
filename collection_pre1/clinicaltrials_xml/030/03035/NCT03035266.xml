	<brief_title>The Effect Blood Flow Restriction Training Muscle Atrophy Following Knee Surgery</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The aim compare strength , patient report outcome , functional outcome post-operative therapy without adjunctive BFR training . To accomplish task investigator compare difference thigh girth two group patient first 6 week 12 week well 6 month follow meniscus articular cartilage repair require 6 week non-weight bearing limited weight bear status brace 0˚ degree extension . In addition , isokinetic test quadriceps hamstring perform 12 week 6 month post-operatively . For 10 subject KACH , cross-sectional area ( CSA ) quadriceps hamstrings group obtain baseline , 12 week , 6 month post-operative utilizing magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) . Lower extremity girth measurement knee surgery perform good excellent intra- inter-rater reliability . Quadriceps strength measure isokinetic testing related performance measure jump . Limb circumference measurement , limb CSA measurement , isokinetic strength test commonly utilized BFR study outcome measures.One group receive BFR 12 week addition standard post-operative rehabilitation group receive standard post-operative rehabilitation without BFR .</detailed_description>
