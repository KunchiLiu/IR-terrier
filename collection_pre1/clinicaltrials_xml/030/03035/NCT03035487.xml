	<brief_summary>The investigational protocol describe small case series design compare three image modality use visualize prostate cancer . The three modality test : transrectal micro-ultrasound , conventional resolution transrectal ultrasound ( LR-TRUS ) ( implement ExactVu , multi-frequency novel micro-ultrasound system investigation ) , multi-parametric MRI ( mpMRI ) . These modality use guide systematic ( standard , random , extended sextant ) plus image-guided targeted prostate biopsy among men know cancer indication prostate biopsy . In case mpMRI , biopsy perform micro-ultrasound guidance radiology report use target .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>This trial enroll nine men indication prostate biopsy . The primary objective study provide guidance clinician use ExactVu system appearance suspicious focus , difference appearance foci LR-TRUS , mpMRI transrectal micro-ultrasound image . The study conduct base hypothesis series same-subject comparison clearly demonstrate difference appearance modality . Procedures study : - obtain informed consent subject - image subject use mpMRI accord PI-RADS v2 protocol , obtain radiologist 's report - perform biopsy procedure use micro-ultrasound ( may conduct separate subject visit ) - prepare biopsy specimens pathology - record procedure detail case report form , include pathology mpMRI report The primary endpoint standardize description use keywords biopsy sample region . These description record blinded reading procedure avoid add procedure time use compare appearance modality . Secondary endpoint pathological result biopsy sample ( Gleason Score percentage cancer sample ) , risk score identify imaging . Both value per-sample , 12 systematic sample per subject plus additional targeted sample warrant standard care .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>1 . All men â‰¥ 40 year age &lt; 80 year age history prostate cancer indication prostate biopsy offer inclusion study . Typical indication biopsy include abnormal PSA ( prostate specific antigen ) and/or abnormal DRE ( digital rectal exam ) and/or history prostate cancer . 2 . PSA &lt; 50 3 . Clinical stage &lt; cT2c Patients exclude included investigation follow true : 1 . Men undergo TRUSguided prostate biopsy OR anesthesia 2 . Men know prostate volume ( prior imaging ) &gt; 60cc 3 . Men anorectal abnormality prevent TRUSguided prostate biopsy 4 . Men unable provide inform consent 5 . Men contraindication MRI gadolinium chelate contrast</criteria>
