	<detailed_description>The macula human retina ( structure responsible high acuity vision essential reading , drive recognize face ) color intense yellow due deposition two carotenoid compound , lutein zeaxanthin . These xanthophyll carotenoid derive exclusively diet , hypothesized protect macula light-induced oxidative damage virtue light-screening antioxidant property . Epidemiological study show high dietary intake blood level lutein zeaxanthin associate low rate vision loss due age-related macular degeneration ( AMD ) . It interest correlate carotenoid level eye skin tissue blood level carotenoid compound .</detailed_description>
