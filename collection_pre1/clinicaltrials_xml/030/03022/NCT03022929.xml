	<brief_summary>Inappropriate antibiotic use major public health concern . Excessive exposure antibiotic result emergence spread drug-resistant bacteria , potentially avoidable adverse drug reaction , increase healthcare utilization cost . As antibiotic prescribing emergency department urgent care center remain unchecked , national professional organization include Infectious Diseases Society America ( IDSA ) Society Healthcare Epidemiology ( SHEA ) , Executive Order President United States , recommend expansion antimicrobial stewardship ambulatory care setting . The goal antimicrobial stewardship effectively promote judicious antibiotic use healthcare setting , yet stewardship program achieve potential term either reach effectiveness . Reach limit implementation mostly inpatient setting ; time , recent critical experiment behavioral science suggest effectiveness exist stewardship program could greatly augment inclusion behavioral nudge , benchmarked audit feedback , peer-to-peer comparison .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Multifaceted Intervention Improve Prescribing Acute Respiratory Infection Adults Children Emergency Department Urgent Care Settings</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>In propose acute care project , investigator compare package consist education provider use exist material CDC 's GetSmart campaign adapt acute care set lead physician champion site ( adapt intervention ) , intensive intervention incorporates adapt GetSmart material enhance individualized audit feedback , peer comparison , behavioral nudge ( enhance intervention ) . The comparative effectiveness enhance intervention evaluate multicenter cluster randomize trial nest within quasi-experimental study acute care stewardship . The investigator ' hypothesis intervention reduce inappropriate antibiotic prescribing antibiotic nonresponsive acute respiratory infection ( ARIs ) emergency department urgent care center , enhance one effective . The investigator use interrupted time series study design measure impact intervention baseline period usual care well seasonally-adjusted historical control . The cluster randomize design two type acute care stewardship intervention allow measurement difference- in-differences antibiotic prescribing rate acute bronchitis , acute bronchiolitis , viral pharyngitis , influenza , nonspecific URI . Translation proven behavioral technique new innovative approach improve prescribe decision . This project expand stewardship new set use innovative effective approach include adaptation behavioral technique ED urgent care setting . The investigator also establish research group network develop novel tool , measure outcome antimicrobial stewardship , disseminate research finding acute care setting-specific toolkits .</detailed_description>
