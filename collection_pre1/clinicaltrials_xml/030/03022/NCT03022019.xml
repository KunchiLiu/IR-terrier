	<brief_summary>Rationale : Autologous epidermal cell suspension graft effective method surgical treatment vitiligo , suitable treat large area good cosmetic result . The RenovaCell Autologous Cell Harvesting Device ( Avita Medical Europe Limited , Cambridge , UK ) ( previous name : ReCell ) device , compare form autologous epidermal cell suspension grafting , easy use show similar result . Efficacy safety ReCell device proven segmental vitiligo piebaldism . However , efficacy non-segmental vitiligo yet confirm randomize control trial . The investigator hypothesize graft use ReNovaCell device combination standard care also effective stable non-segmental vitiligo effective standard care alone . Objective : Primary : ass efficacy safety ReNovaCell grafting combine 311 nm UVB therapy topical anti-inflammatory therapy treatment stable non-segmental vitiligo . Secondary : ass , satisfaction , cosmetic acceptability , noticeability persistence repigmentation ReNovaCell transplantation . Study design : Prospective , observer-blinded , randomise , within subject , control , study . Study population : 20 patient ≥ 18 year stable non-segmental vitiligo receive standard care ( 311 nm UVB therapy topical anti-inflammatory therapy ) least 6 month Netherlands Institute Pigment Disorders ( NIPD ) Academic Medical Centre , University Amsterdam . Intervention : In patient already receive standard care ( 311 nm UVB therapy + topical anti-inflammatory therapy ) 2 comparable depigmented region randomise receive ReNovaCell graft graft . Standard care give accord standard treatment protocol institute . Main study parameters/endpoints : Primary outcome : Objective assessment degree repigmentation three six month ReNovaCell graft digital image analysis system . To assess pigmentation , contour pigmentation copy transparent sheet , three six month treatment , sheet scan digital image analysis use compute affect surface . By compare pre- post-treatment picture , relative surface show repigmentation express percentage select treat patch compute . Secondary outcome : - Patient Reported Outcomes : satisfaction , cosmetic acceptability , noticeability - General patient assess outcome per treatment region scale 0-3 ( poor , moderate , good excellent ) . - Visual assessment percentage repigmentation blind observer color match normal skin - Visual assessment side effect per treatment region ( hyperpigmentation , hypopigmentation scar scale 0-3 ) blind investigator . - A small amount suspension include patient redundant lesional punchgrafts patient use flow cytometric analysis cellular composition graft cell suspension , expression analysis melanin synthesis-related gene . These data correlate clinical data . Nature extent burden risk associate participation , benefit group relatedness : As study involve large depigmented lesion , large treat regular surgical treatment ( punch grafting ) , patient miss regular treatment . The time investment patient approximately 20 minute punchgrafting session , 75 minute cell suspension graft session 15 minute three follow-up visit . Two five visit part standard care UVB follow-up regimen therefore additional due study . Infection graft area donor site may occur rare ; risk mild textural change donor site moderate . Hyperpigmentation treat area occur often , although improves time case . In case improvement depigmentation , patient may receive another treatment ( contralateral ) untreated side .</brief_summary>
