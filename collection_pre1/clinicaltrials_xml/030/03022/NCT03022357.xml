	<detailed_description>Idiopathic Parkinson 's characterized loss midbrain dopaminergic neuron preferentially affect nigrosomes par compacta substantia nigra ( SNpc ) . At time clinical diagnosis , estimate 50-70 % neuron SNpc lose . Non-invasive image cell loss nigrosomes contain SNpc dopaminergic neuron would clinically desirable accurate diagnosis clinically uncertain case parkinsonism , especially early stage Parkinson 's . Investigators recently discover high resolution susceptibility weight MRI 7T 3T demonstrates iron related signal loss NS1 Parkinson 's . These study prove feasibility potential vivo nigrosome MRI new diagnostic tool Parkinson 's . Further support confidence novel diagnostic concept come similar observation research group . Project goal To establish whether nigrosome MRI alternative DatScanTM diagnosis early Parkinson 's patient diagnostic uncertainty . To establish whether nigrosomal iron predict severity Parkinson 's . As secondary aim investigator study nigrosomal iron load determine susceptometry correlate disease severity ( MDS-UPDRS ) . TRIAL / STUDY OBJECTIVES AND PURPOSE PURPOSE - To establish whether nigrosome MRI alternative DatScan diagnosis early Parkinson 's - To establish whether nigrosomal iron predict severity Parkinson 's . PRIMARY OBJECTIVE Validation NS1 MRI qualitative diagnostic marker early Parkinson 's • To investigate whether presence absence swallow tail nigrosome MRI 3T accurate DatScan least 80 % sensitive 80 % specific predict final clinical diagnosis Parkinson 's vs. movement disorder patient indeterminate atypical parkinsonian feature . Hypothesis 1 : That swallow tail sign accurate marker early Parkinson 's SECONDARY OBJECTIVES Biomarker discovery base quantitative nigrosome iron marker Parkinson 's • To investigate whether diagnostic performance nigrosome MRI improve quantitative assessment nigrosomal iron combination neuromelanin metric . Hypothesis 2 : That nigrosomal iron metric improve detection early Parkinson 's • To assess well disease severity predict iron content nigrosome combination iron content size neuromelanin-rich nigra volume . Hypothesis 3 : That nigrosomal iron metric closely associate severity early Parkinson 's The investigator recruit 145 patient diagnostic uncertainty Parkinson 's Disease . These patient undergo MRI DATscans clinically examine . They followed-up ( clinical examination ) 12 month , identify confirm Parkinson 's Disease , order compare sensitivity specificity nigrosome1 detect MRI DATScan , potentially allow non-invasive much less expensive mean diagnose Parkinson 's Disease .</detailed_description>
