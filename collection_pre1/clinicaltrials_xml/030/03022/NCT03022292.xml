	<brief_summary>A study investigate ability OCTA image technology identify analyze untreated type 1 , 2 , 3 neovascular membrane lesion treatment naive patient exudative macular degeneration , well investigate ability OCTA image technology evaluate treatment outcome Intravitreal Aflibercept Injection neovascular lesion associate macular degeneration . This study utilize new , FDA approve , non-standard care technology ( OCT-Angiography Optovue ) image evaluate treatment outcome use standard care Intravitreal Aflibercept Injections approve use patient diagnose neovascular AMD naive previous Anti-VEGF therapy .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>The IAI-OCTA Study ; Study OCT-Angiography Analysis Efficacy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Prospective study neovascular AMD subject type 1 , 2 , 3 neovascularization treat prior anti-VEGF therapy . Subjects schedule intravitreal aflibercept injection ( IAI ) baseline , week 4 , week 8 , week 16 , week 24 , week 36 , week 48 . Additional injection administer remain visit need basis per PI discretion base presence intraretinal subretinal fluid OCT , heme visualized examination , reduction BCVA 5 ETDRS letter , evidence either increased area , density , activity brush border neovascularization OCT angiography . There minimum 21 day subsequent injection . Each subject therefore receive minimum 7 injection maximum 13 injection throughout study period . No injection give exit visit , week 52 . OCT angiography spectral domain OCT imaging perform baseline every 4 week thereafter The procedure standard care neovascular AMD subject . As part study , subject also undergo image eye OCTA visit . This standard Care research . The procedure perform research OCT-A . The injection procedure SOC base physician discretion clinical need . The investigator modify dosage amount frequency . A subgroup willing subject undergo OCT angiography every 2 week first 12 week . Indocyanine green angiography perform baseline subject establish baseline subject population characteristic . Fluorescein angiography perform baseline , week 12 , week 52 efficacy monitoring . Detailed OCT angiography analysis perform identify anatomical morphological biomarkers growth progression disease activity . In addition qualitative structural morphological analysis , detailed quantitative OCT angiography analysis neovascular lesion use automate manual capillary density map area calculation perform visit determine detail microvascular response neovascular complex IAI therapy .</detailed_description>

Subject willing able comply clinic visit studyrelated procedure . 5 . Subject able provide sign informed consent . 6 . Subject able understand complete studyrelated questionnaire . 7 . The subject currently involve clinical study . 8 . Best Corrected Visual Acuity ( BCVA ) ETDRS Snellen equivalent 20/400 good 20/32 bad . 9 . Sufficiently clear medium ( cornea , anterior chamber , lens , vitreous ) OCT , FA fundus photography ( FP ) . 10 . Intraocular pressure ( IOP ) 25mmHg less study eye , without use ocular hypotensive agent . 11 . Prior focal corticosteroid treatment allow , long study eye involve . However prior ( within 90 day Day 0 ) current systemic corticosteroid therapy ( oral intravenous corticosteroid treatment ) permit . 1 . Any prior treatment neovascular AMD eye propose enrollment include previous antivascular endothelial factor ( antiVEGF ) therapy , photodynamic therapy ( PDT ) , radiation therapy , corticosteroid treatment , surgical treatment CNV , thermal laser treatment , prior intravitreal treatment neovascular AMD ( except mineral vitamin ) . 2 . Known serious allergy aflibercept , fluorescein dye , Indocyanine Green ( ICG ) , shellfish , drug pupillary dilation , topical anesthetic , sterilize solution ( e.g . Betadine Solution ) . 3 .
