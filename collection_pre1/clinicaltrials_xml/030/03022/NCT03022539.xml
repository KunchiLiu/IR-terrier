	<brief_summary>Radiotherapy ( combine chemotherapy ) commonly use curative treatment pelvic tumour , cervical , vulvar anal cancer . In patient , cure rate high may associate significant treatment-related toxicity , especially dermatologic , gastrointestinal , genitourinary hematologic toxicity . Accurate treatment plan dose delivery essential radiotherapy order effective term local tumour control reduce radiation-induced side effect . However , accuracy challenge tumour organ motion fraction fraction ( interfraction movement ) . At present , radiotherapy treatment planning typically perform one planning-CT scan perform start treatment . However , interfraction set variation organ motion lead difference calculate dose distribution planning-CT radiation dose actually receive tumour normal organ ( actual give dose ) . Current photon radiotherapy pelvic area relatively insensitive change margin CTV PTV ensure adequate dose coverage tumour area . Despite new technique photon therapy , like intensity modulate radiotherapy ( IMRT ) , critical organ still receive substantial amount dose lead clinically relevant acute late side effect . With proton beam therapy , amount radiation dose organ risk significantly reduce . For proton beam therapy ( PBT ) however , knowledge tumour organ motion important . The major potential advantage PBT tumours pelvic area term prevention radiation-induced side effect challenge difference bladder volume , rectal fill air gap especially small bowel , sigmoid rectum . Setup error organ motion cause geometric displacement tumour normal tissue , deteriorates dose gradient target volume normal tissue . Furthermore , result change tissue density beam path , alter position Bragg peak , turn lead distort dose distribution , usually manifest significant local and/or dosage . In study , investigator want evaluate impact inter intrafractional tumour organ motion photon proton radiotherapy treatment plan order create robust intensity modulate photon- and/or proton treatment plan ( IMRT , IMPT ) final aim lower treatment related toxicity . Objective : To explore extent inter- intrafraction anatomical change tumour surround normal tissue , throughout full course treatment , subsequently assess impact change nominal plan dose . This information require design robust treatment plan ( photon and/or proton ) ensure optimal local tumour control reduce toxicity . Study design : Pilot-study ( 40 patient ) . Study population : Patients cervical , vulvar anal cancer , plan radiotherapy ( without chemotherapy ) curative intent . Intervention ( applicable ) : Not applicable . Main study parameters/endpoints : Robustness parameter ( homogeneity index ; coverage clinical target volume ) , dose organ risk ( OARs ) , small bowel , rectum , bladder bone marrow . Nature extent burden risk associate participation , benefit group relatedness : During radiotherapy treatment course , patient undergo weekly repeat plan CT scan without contrast agent order evaluate impact intra inter-fraction tumour organ motion . The additional radiation dose 5 extra CT 's relatively low ( 5 x 8 mSv , plus 1 x 22 mSv 4D CT scan ) relation therapeutic radiation dose ( 50.4-85 Gy ) . The risk therefore negligible burden low .</brief_summary>
