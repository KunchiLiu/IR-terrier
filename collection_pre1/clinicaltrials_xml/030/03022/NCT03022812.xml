	<brief_summary>Neck pain fourth among common condition worldwide associate long period live disability . Annually , 30 000 people Sweden undergo whiplash trauma ( WAD ) , half individual develop chronic problem high cost individual society . Evidence chronic WAD treatment scarce , although neck-specific training physiotherapy clinic ( 2 time week 3 month ) demonstrate good result . A efficient , flexible rehabilitation reduce wait time low cost need , ideally replace lengthy on-site treatment series health care provider . Internet-based care prove viable alternative personal care meeting variety disease intervention , study lack Internet-based intervention individual chronic neck problem . The purpose study investigate A ) neck-specific training deliver Internet-based care differs B ) long series treatment physiotherapy clinic regarding , e.g. , work ability , sick-leave disability . This prospective , randomize study involve 140 participant . Measurement do baseline , 3 month ( end treatment ) , 15 month ( 12 month end treatment study ) include rating work ability , sick-leave , work presenteeism , disability , pain , health , satisfaction care , quality life , cost-effectiveness . The study result may contribute development effective rehabilitation , flexible equal care , short wait time , increase availability lower cost health care society . The program implement broad scale neck pain patient .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Neck-specific Exercise Chronic Whiplash</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The purpose study investigate effect neck-specific exercise people chronic WAD ( risk sick-leave ) differs base distribution via Internet-based care combination three visit ( + first examination visit due Swedish law ) physiotherapist compare long series ( 2 times/week 3 month , i.e. , 24 time + first visit ) exercise physiotherapy clinic . Outcomes instance work ability , sick-leave , physical psychological disability , pain , quality life , satisfaction treatment , cost effectiveness . Further objective ) describe level work ability , work presenteeism , sick leave ; b ) determine factor relate good work ability ; c ) identify factor predictive favourable outcome regard work ability , disability , pain ; ) describe participant perceive Internet-based rehabilitation . Hypothesis : Internet-based support combine ( three ) physiotherapist visit equivalent effect longer exercise period ( 24 time ) physiotherapist clinic yield low economic cost society . Design This experimental , longitudinal , prospective , multicentre randomize control trial ( RCT ) two treatment arm . Treatment previously show effective ( neck-specific exercise guide physiotherapist perform physiotherapist clinic ) current population constitutes control treatment new Internet-based neck-specific exercise treatment . A total 140 people expect include , 70 group ( sample size estimate statistician ) . Independent physiotherapist primary care clinical practice distribute treatment . The project manager test leader . Recruitment randomization Interested patient contact research team ( experienced physiotherapist ) , small survey fill potential participant , project team member perform telephone interview , ask medical history , perform physical examination ensure criterion study participation met . If study criterion meet write oral informed consent patient , patient fill questionnaire ( baseline data ) undergo physical measurement neck-related function . Baseline measurement must complete inclusion . The patient randomize computerized randomization list ( block randomization conduct statistician , stratification gender ) one two group 3 month treatment neck-specific exercise : A ) exercise physiotherapy clinic 2 times/week 3 month ; B ) Internet-based support exercise combination four visit physiotherapist . The test leader blind group allocation . The randomization perform independent researcher otherwise involved test treatment . The researcher send opaque envelope contain name contact detail patient information randomization group treat physiotherapist , call patient new clinical examination ( law ) treatment start . Due nature study neither participant treat therapist blind , however test do blinded test leader . Data collection form questionnaires test physical neck-related function occur baseline ( randomization ) 3 month ( treatment end ) 15 month ( 12 month completion intervention project ) . The treat physiotherapist receive oral write information day practical training . The treat physiotherapist also able consult project manager time necessary . An exercise diary maintain patient group , number care contact record physiotherapist . Seventy people per group , i.e. , total 140 participant chronic WAD grade 2 3 , recruit . Intervention Group A , neck-specific exercise physiotherapy clinic : Participants get explanation justification exercise . They undergo 12-week training program physiotherapist 2 times/week . Exercises choose clear write frame exercise , although dosage individually adapt . The training include exercise activate deep neck muscle , continue endurance training neck shoulder muscle . The exercise individually adjust accord individual 's physical condition progressively increase severity dose . Exercise-related pain provocation accept . The individual may also carry home exercise . At end treatment period , patient encourage continue practice . Group B , neck-specific exercise Internet support : Participants receive information training program group A total four visit ( first examination visit additional three visit ) physiotherapist . When exercise introduce , repeat , control do patient understood conduct exercise . The exercise take place , help Internet support outside health care system , probably mostly home . Photos video exercise , information , answer frequently ask question available Internet ( web-based system design project leader University ) . Patients contact physiotherapist necessary , normally expect answer within 3 day . Any important harm unintended effect group collect test leader . Sample size Sample size calculation study regard group difference calculate statistician ( non-inferiority trial , assumption treatment B bad A ) , power calculate software `` G-POWER '' base primary outcome measurement WAI NDI . Regarding WAI , consider important participant improve poor moderate work ability , i.e. , average 6 increment scale 7-47 ( also classify four group : poor , moderate , good , excellent ) . With significance level 5 % power 80 % , seven people classification group require . To get seven people `` poor group '' require 60 people total . To detect clinically relevant improvement NDI 7 % , 47 participant per group need basis 80 % power significance level 5 % . This value base standard deviation ( SD 13.4 ) NDI previous study neck-specific exercise individual chronic WAD grade 2 3 . To ensure enough people group drop-outs , prediction analysis , possibility subgroup analysis ( e.g. , WAD grade 2 3 men woman ) , recommendation statistician include 70 people/group . Ethical consideration The study approve regional ethical review board ( Link√∂ping Dnr 2016 / 135-31 ) . A previous clinical study relate three different exercise intervention long-term problem whiplash injury demonstrate good efficacy neck-specific exercise perform primary health care . Current treatment accord best scientific evidence , exercise use present study use daily clinical practice decade rehabilitation various form neck pain . Participants include thorough clinical examination sign inform ( oral write information ) consent . The exercise adjust individually . A risk muscle soreness present , otherwise negative side effect expect . Login require fill Internet-based survey gain access Internet-based exercise program . People long-term problem often low access assessment treatment acute condition often prioritize health care system . Both group present study get active care expect increase work ability . The benefit deem great , commercial interest . The result present group level , connection individual person make . All data anonymous subject official health secret act . Statistical analysis Analyses do parametric non-parametric statistic , depend type data analysis group time . Analyses primarily make intention-to-treat basis secondary per protocol analysis . When suitable linear mixed model analysis use . For prediction analysis , multivariate analysis perform . For calculation cost-effectiveness , quality-adjusted life-years incremental cost-effective ratio calculate . Sub-group analysis regard gender , WAD grade , neurology , headache , dizziness compliance may do . Ultrasound registration , electromyopgraphy , Magnetic Resonance Imaging kinesthesia may do sub-group participant investigate neck muscle structure function . Interviews may perform sub group individual investigate experience function study participation .</detailed_description>
