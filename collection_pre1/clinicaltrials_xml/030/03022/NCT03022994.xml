	<brief_summary>Recently report consistent percentage general population consider suffer problem cause wheat and/or gluten ingestion , even though CD wheat allergy . This clinical condition name Non-Celiac Gluten Sensitivity ' ( NCGS ) . In previous paper investigator suggest term 'Non-Celiac Wheat Sensitivity ' ( NCWS ) , since know component wheat cause symptom NCGS patient , investigator also show patient high frequency coexistent multiple food hypersensitivity . Nowadays data available histological characteristic duodenal rectal biopsy NCWS patient . The researcher demonstrate significant eosinophils infiltration duodenal colon mucosa , significant infiltration CD45+/CD3-CD14- cell rectal mucosa NCWS patient upon wheat challenge , thus configure diffuse gastrointestinal `` inflammatory/immunologic '' pattern . The aims present study : 1 ) investigate histological characteristic duodenal rectal biopsy NCWS irritable bowel syndrome ( IBS ) patient , 2 ) evaluate site ( i.e . duodenal rectal ) show `` inflammatory/allergic '' feature useful NCWS histological diagnosis .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Recently report consistent percentage general population consider suffer problem cause wheat and/or gluten ingestion , even though CD wheat allergy . This clinical condition name Non-Celiac Gluten Sensitivity ' ( NCGS ) . In previous paper investigator suggest term 'Non-Celiac Wheat Sensitivity ' ( NCWS ) , since know component wheat cause symptom NCGS patient , investigator also show patient high frequency coexistent multiple food hypersensitivity . The clinical picture NCWS characterize combined gastrointestinal ( bloat , abdominal pain , diarrhea and/or constipation , nausea , epigastric pain , gastroesophageal reflux , aphthous stomatitis ) extra-intestinal and/or systemic manifestation ( headache , depression , anxiety , 'foggy mind , ' tiredness , dermatitis skin rash , fibromyalgia-like joint/muscle pain , leg arm numbness , anemia ) . Nowadays data available histological characteristic duodenal rectal biopsy NCWS patient . The researcher demonstrate significant eosinophils infiltration duodenal colon mucosa , significant infiltration CD45+/CD3-CD14- cell rectal mucosa NCWS patient upon wheat challenge , thus configure diffuse gastrointestinal `` inflammatory/immunologic '' pattern . As regard rectal lymphocyte , analysis cytokine production demonstrate dominant spontaneous interferon ( IFN ) -γ production cell , identify innate lymphoid cell belong group 1 ( ILC1 ) population , express T-bet produce IFN-γ , compatible innate immunity involvement NCWS pathogenesis . Therefore , aim present study : 1 ) investigate histological characteristic difference duodenal rectal biopsy NCWS IBS patient , 2 ) search `` inflammatory/allergic '' feature ( i.e . eosinophils and/or lymphocyte infiltration ) useful NCWS histological diagnosis .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>To diagnose NCWS recently propose criterion adopt . All patient meet follow criterion : negative serum antitransglutaminase ( antitTG ) antiendomysium ( EmA ) immunoglobulin ( Ig ) A IgG antibodies absence intestinal villous atrophy negative IgEmediated immuneallergy test wheat ( skin prick test and/or serum specific IgE detection ) resolution IBS symptoms standard elimination diet , exclude wheat , cow 's milk , egg , tomato , chocolate , selfreported food ( ) causing symptom symptom reappearance doubleblind placebocontrolled ( DBPC ) wheat challenge . As investigator previously describe study , DBPC cow 's milk protein challenge `` open '' food challenge perform . To diagnose IBS standard Rome II ( retrospective patient ) Rome III ( prospective patient ) Criteria adopt . None subject improved elimination diet without wheat , cow 's milk , egg , tomato , chocolate . NCWS diagnosis exclude : positive EmA culture medium duodenal biopsy , also case normal villi/crypts ratio duodenal mucosa selfexclusion wheat diet refusal reintroduce enter study previously diagnose gastrointestinal disorder previously diagnose gynaecological disorder nervous system disease and/or major psychiatric disorder physical impairment limit physical activity .</criteria>
