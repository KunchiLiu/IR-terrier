	<brief_summary>Cochlear implant ( CIs ) medical device widely use person severe profound hearing loss . After six month one-year period follow implantation , adult typically reach optimal fitting parameter , lead stabilize hearing performance CI . At stage , usually enter routine clinical after-care program , involve regular appointmentsattheir CI center . Such visit aim identify complication , medical ( abnormal cutaneous heal evolution ) and/or device relate , well declinein performance ( possibly relate former ) . In France , HAS ( French Health Authority ) recommend CI user tobe see around threetimes year second third year implantation , annually . While schedule appointment remain dependent center ' practice , kind consensus minimal content long-term follow-up session : medical consultation , CI external part check , free field aid tonal audiometry , fit adjustment necessary , speech understanding assessment . Our center ( CRIC ) one big French CI implant center approve HAS , provide after-care le 750 CI user , whomhave enter long-term follow-up period . For , attend follow-up appointment may need several hour , require take half-day work , entail travel expense . Some patient may also associate disability make difficultto reach center.Moreover , although cohort patient increase year , number train professional clinical care infrastructures evolve proportionally . As consequence , need reduce number routine visit , allow scope complex case andto efficiently identify issue . Remote consultation seem address point list . However , appear little doneto develop remote after-care cochlear implant recipient . Published study mainly focus fit aspect . The development telemedicine become one key priority French government past year , feasible thanks development high speed connection ( ADSL , mobile internet , high definition transmission ) . Promoting telemedicine several goal , main one extend health care service underserved patient remote location ; also allow medical unit free upand reserve infrastructure professional patient request critical care . Of course , telemedicine also mean save cost . The objectif protocole evaluate feasibility telemedicine apply adult cochlear implant user ' follow-up comparing data medical consultation speech therapy assessment , carry CRIC service videoconferencing patient home , use computer equipment communicate CRIC .</brief_summary>
