	<brief_title>Acute Chronic Protective Effects Peri-interventional Administration Levosimendan ST Elevation Myocardial Infarctions</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>An acute ST-elevation myocardial infarction ( STEMI ) severe disease trigger adverse remodeling , serve progressive heart failure case fatality rate 50 % 5 year . The opening occlude vessel first important therapy , reperfusion improve function well long-term survival . At time , experimental clinical study show , however , reperfusion self-reinforced damage myocardium . An additional Intervention trigger phase could reduce acute damage , long-term protective effect . Both effect could approach Calcium-Sensitizer Levosimendan animal model . So far , clear effect remodel survive demonstrate myocardial infarction clinic . This could mainly due delayed application relation reperfusion selection suitable method presentation effect myocardial structure function . In proposed project investigator want ass whether approach post-conditioning Levosimendan patient acute STEMI safe reproducible , use positive influence outcome respect myocardial damage , cardiac leave ventricular remodeling , myocardial function , occurrence cardiac event quality life .</detailed_description>
