	<brief_title>T-cell And General Immune Response Seasonal Influenza Vaccine ( SLVP018 ) Year 4 , 2012</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The investigator plan study immune response different influenza vaccine much broadly deeply across different age group different vaccine modality probe influence genetics response use monozygotic dizygotic twin . The investigator plan compare various immunological response , identify age-specific biomarkers cluster marker , quantify frequency influenza-specific T-cells pre- post-vaccination , determine effective breadth T-cell repertoire influenza vaccine within individual function age degree genetically determine . Twin group B randomly assign receive single dose inactivated vaccine , either trivalent inactivated influenza vaccine ( TIV ) intranasal live , attenuated influenza vaccine ( LAIV ) . Twin Groups C-E receive single administration TIV . Group F , elderly participant , randomly assign receive single dose inactivated vaccine , either usual dose high-dose TIV . Blood sample conduct assay describe take pre-immunization , Days 7-10 28 post-immunization . Groups A , C E enrol year five year annual study .</detailed_description>
