	<detailed_description>Background : Brace treatment effective non-surgical method treatment AIS . The goal brace stop curve progression high risk period adolescent growth spurt . A spinal brace hard plastic shell pressure pad instal inside liner provide mechanical support curvature spine . It big commitment adolescent wear brace physically restrictive , uncomfortable draw unwanted attention . Therefore , important make brace treatment effective possible get patient buy-in compromise lifestyle wear brace . Patients ' belief treatment outcome also factor attain compliance . Study Objective : This randomized clinical study investigate effectiveness brace treatment maximize combine ultrasound image assistance brace design smart brace automatically maintain corrective brace pressure optimum level whole treatment period . Methodology : Subject Selection : One hundred twenty-eight brace candidate AIS recruit next 5 year . During scoliosis clinic , attend orthopaedic surgeon identifies potential candidate . He ask potential patient he/she interested speaking research coordinator research project he/she eligible . The inclusion criterion patient 1 ) age 10 - 16 year , 2 ) diagnosis AIS , 3 ) require full-time brace wear , 4 ) Cobb angle 20° - 40° , 5 ) Risser sign ≤3 6 ) premenarchal le 1 year postmenarchal . Subjects randomly select 1 2 group : ) An ultrasound assist design brace brace monitor , b ) An ultrasound assist design brace smart brace device . Figure 1 show flow chart study . Each subject 50 % chance one group . An extra 15 minute need group brace fit clinic install brace monitor smart brace device . An extra 30 minute add casting . Participants monitor brace treatment finish . Detailed description : The brace monitor small electronic device embed inside brace . It low power system operate 3.3 V 2 milliampere ( mA ) ( average ) . It able store 12 month data battery last 9 month . It record much time tightly subject wear brace . The brace monitor look exactly standard brace . The subject wo n't feel different n't need anything beyond . We replace monitor new one every standard follow clinic . A smart brace device small electronic device . It small air bag embed major pad area cover stretchable leather . It record much time tightly brace worn . The air bag inflate contact pressure brace body lower expect . The air bag deflate contact pressure brace body high expect . This automatic pressure adjustment activate daytime individualize base patient 's sleep pattern . The system also activate breathe motion detect ( mean brace wear ) . The smart brace monitor able store 6 month data require recharge every day 30 minute . The smart brace monitor low power system ( operate 4.2 V 150 mA max ) . It on-off switch pressure enable-disable regulation switch safety function . Switching enable-disable regulation make smart brace device become standard brace monitor . Turing on-off switch disable function brace become standard brace . We replace monitor new one every standard follow clinic . The ultrasound assist design require get 4 ultrasound image : normal standing , normal supine , bend leave supine bending right supine . Each scan take approximately 1 minute . These 4 scan provide spine flexibility information . After , subject ask stand wooden positioning frame pressure pad allow move 3-dimensionally . Multiple adjustable brace pad apply patient ' body accord orthotist suggestion . An ultrasound scan perform pad apply . The orthotist use ultrasound image decide pad optimum location apply proper pressure . If orthotist satisfied correction , he/ use setup build brace . Otherwise , he/she adjust position orientation pad repeat ultrasound scan .</detailed_description>
