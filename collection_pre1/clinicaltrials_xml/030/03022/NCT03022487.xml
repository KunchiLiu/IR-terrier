	<brief_summary>This prospective open label single blind multi-centre observational study involve study group patient already undergo implantable cardioverter-defibrillator ( ICD ) ( include Cardiac resynchronisation therapy device ( CRT-D ) ) implant . A standard 30-minute electrophysiological ( EP ) cardiac stimulation protocol perform end ICD implant baseline . This EP test perform whilst measure 12-lead ECG correlate event rate establish effectiveness predict arrhythmia risk . The minimum follow period 18 month maximum 3 year , long study fund . This study randomise study patient receive EP study perform baseline . A minimum 440 patient recruited document event data standard clinical ICD follow interval - equate maximum 6 visit . Blinding maintain core lab ECG analysis perform nominated researcher detail patient health status .</brief_summary>
