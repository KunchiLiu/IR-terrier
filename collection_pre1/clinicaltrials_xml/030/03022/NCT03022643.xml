	<detailed_description>The overall goal study gather preliminary data , focus behavioral rhythm patient chronic pain well relationship behavioral rhythm pain-related clinical symptom . Additionally , study provide preliminary data feasibility , acceptability , treatment effect repurposing interpersonal social rhythm therapy ( IPSRT ) along light therapy patient chronic pain exhibit significant rhythm dysregulation , sleep disturbance , mood symptom . The deliverable end project include 1 ) preliminary evidence concern prevalence behavioral rhythm disturbance patient chronic pain ; 2 ) association behavioral rhythm disruption symptom cluster pain-sleep-fatigue-mood ; 3 ) feasibility acceptability prototype IPSRT repurposed chronic pain patient along bright light therapy . The specific aim propose study follow : Aim 1 : To evaluate regularity social behavioral rhythm ( SBR ) , disruption circadian activity rhythm ( CAR ) , relationship SBR CAR clinical symptom pain-sleep-fatigue-mood chronic pain patient compare healthy control . Hypothesis 1 : Patients chronic pain show high degree SBR CAR disruption compare control . Hypothesis 2 : Patients increasingly dysregulated SBR attenuate CAR exhibit worse clinical symptom . Hypothesis 3 : SBR associate CAR patient chronic pain control . Aim 2 : To assess feasibility acceptance interpersonal social rhythm therapy repurposed chronic pain patient population along bright light therapy provide patient exhibit SBR disruption significant sleep mood symptom . Hypothesis 1 : The IPSRT well tolerate accepted patient Hypothesis 2 : Descriptive data suggest improvement SBR , CAR , pain-related symptom function .</detailed_description>
