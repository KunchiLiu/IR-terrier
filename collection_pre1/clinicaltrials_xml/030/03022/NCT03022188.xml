	<detailed_description>With increase use high-resolution conventional imaging , pancreatic incidentalomas diagnose frequently . In two recent surgical series , neuroendocrine tumor ( NETs ) carcinoma account 10-15 % pancreatic incidentalomas , majority ( 75-90 % case ) well differentiate . The factor affect behaviour pancreatic NETs differentiation , histological grade , stag , size intratumoral microvascular density . In updated World Health Organization ( WHO ) classification , grade system base tumor differentiation , rate proliferation Ki-67 index . The management pancreatic NETs depend tumor stage presence hormonal syndrome . By definition , incidentally discover pancreatic NETs ( PNETs ) unassociated hormonal syndrome ( nonfunctioning ) detect patient undergo diagnostic evaluation unrelated condition . The therapeutic approach hormonally functional tumor , large tumor ( &gt; 2 cm ) local , vascular lymph node invasion , highly suggestive malignancy , presence metastasis , well admit : surgery indicate discuss . However , attitude less consensual small ( ≤ 2 cm ) non-functioning ( NF ) non-metastatic lesion . There paucity literature report pancreatic neuroendocrine incidentalomas characteristic . However , give increase incidence , emerge problem require change treatment guideline . In English , American French recommendation , systematic surgical resection lymphadenectomy currently recommend medically fit patient . The follow-up ( FU ) possible tumor &lt; 2 cm ( T1 ) locate pancreatic head enucleation feasible . This therapeutic approach two limitation : 1 ) significant incidence tumor , widespread use routine imaging , improve technology multi detector CT scan , fortuitous discovery small pancreatic incidentalomas become common . 2 ) Pancreatic surgery carry significant postoperative morbidity even high-volume tertiary center even parenchyma-preserving resection . This may result many pancreatic resection tumor unknown natural history . On hand , follow-up may factor considerable anxiety , carry risk , actually difficult ass , let tumor grow two monitoring control , possible evolution irreversible metastatic stage disease . As result , investigator unceasingly face dilemma : manage asymptomatic patient small incidentally detect , potentially benign NETs ? Several recently publish retrospective study discuss `` non- surgical '' management small NF incidentally detect pancreatic NETs ( IPNETs ) highlight necessity develop guideline management patient . A strict correlation tumor size malignancy tumor demonstrate single-center retrospective Italian study Bettini col. , include patient NF PNETs underwent curative ( R0 ) resection 18 year . In group 51 patient small size T ( 2 cm less ) , incidentally discover , majority lesion benign , author conclude follow-up propose patient incidentally discover NF PNETs ≤ 2 cm . However despite small size asymptomatic character tumor , rate malignancy NF IPNETs ≤ 2 cm estimate 24 % ( 18 % 6 % case , uncertain behaviour carcinoma present ) .
