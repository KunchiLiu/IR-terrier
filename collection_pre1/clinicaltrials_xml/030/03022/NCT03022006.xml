	<brief_summary>The number hemodialysis patient chronic renal failure Japan exceed 0.3 million show increase trend . The rate infection hepatitis C virus ( HCV ) high hemodialysis patient , reveal prognosis poorer HCV-infected hemodialysis patient compare uninfected patient ; therefore , aggressive therapeutic intervention required.Investigator previously report efficacy safety NS5A inhibitor ; daclatasvir HCV protease inhibitor ; asunaprevir combination therapy Japanese dialysis patient genotype 1 HCV infection . However , duration treatment 24 week , quite longer current standard 12 week therapy . elbasvir/grazoprevir combination therapy oral anti-HCV 12 week therapy without use IFN/ribavirin , good therapeutic effect report Japanese phase II study . Of note drug metabolize mainly liver thus used patient chronic renal failure . Recently , David Roth et al report efficacy safety elbasvir/grazoprevir combination therapy patient hepatitis C virus genotype 1 infection stage 4-5 chronic kidney disease . In report , reveal elbasvir/grazoprevir combination therapy could achieve SVR rate 99 % modify full analysis set . However , adequate clinical investigation perform Japan , thus far concern therapeutic effect safety elbasvir/grazoprevir combination therapy Japanese hemodialysis patient .</brief_summary>
