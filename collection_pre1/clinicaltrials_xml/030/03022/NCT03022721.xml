	<detailed_description>The prospective observational study entitle `` Heidelberg Study Diabetes Complications '' design show diabetes accord current medical definition exist . Without question , autoimmune disease destroy beta cell pancreas , lead absolute insulin deficiency consecutively elevate blood glucose level . This disease define diabetes mellitus type 1 . Insulin treatment absolutely necessary state , since absolute insulin deficiency lead lipolysis consecutive ketoacidosis eventually death . On hand , type 2 diabetes generally define relative insulin deficiency consecutively elevate blood glucose level . This disease often mention context metabolic syndrome , additionally comprise obesity , arterial hypertension , dyslipidemia , cardiovascular disease . Therefore , name `` diabetes mellitus '' share two disease , mean `` sweet flow '' , therefore describe symptom . Multiple interventional study aim avoid reduce development late diabetic complication ( nephropathy , neuropathy , retinopathy , microangiopathy ) . This true type 1 type 2 diabetes . Up day , study able demonstrate treatment normalization blood glucose level reduces even reverse development complication . Moreover , several type 2 diabetic patient develop typical diabetic complication definitive manifestation actual disease . Therefore , hypothesize late diabetic complication stand primary context blood glucose control , associate metabolic disorder . One aspect reactive metabolite ( glyoxal , methylglyoxal , 3-DG ) , form glycolysis lipolysis context energy production cell . These metabolite detoxify lactate certain enzyme . In case detoxification compromise , production metabolite elevate , call advanced glycation endproducts ( AGEs ) form . Moreover , within process energy production , reactive oxygen specie ( ROS ) oxydative stress pronounce , direct influence cellular metabolism . This interaction lead inflammation DNA damage . Survival cell dependent defense mechanism , seem genetically determine , cellular age play role well ( cellular senescence ) . With advanced ageing , cell lose defense mechanism permanent metabolic attack . Therefore , follow hypothesis arise : 1 . Diabetes mellitus type 2 independent disease , late complication metabolic imbalance 2 . Typical `` late diabetic complication '' base insufficient blood glucose lower therapy , basis metabolic imbalance , therefore affect every patient , even without manifest `` diabetes mellitus type 2 '' 3 . Diabetes mellitus type 1 autoimmundisease consecutive absolute insulin deficiency , however manifestation late diabetic complication base metabolic dysbalance ( overlap type 2 ) . In order investigate hypothesis , study participant profoundly examine yearly concern glycemic metabolic state clinical finding relate micro- macrovascular diabetic complication , Moreover , reactive metabolite like AGEs , ROS , methylglyoxal , DNA damage well parameter associate cellular senescence examine . We also collect information concerning quality life , well-being , depression , neuropathic pain . This first study kind include non-diabetics , pre-diabetics , diabetic possibility study difference common ground regard cellular metabolism . Moreover , best knowledge , precise clinical characterization peripheral nerve function pre-diabetics , although patient already complain neuropathic symptom . In addition , natural clinical course diabetic , also pre-diabetics observe long period time . Finally , change surrogate marker natural course pre-diabetes observe first time , onset type 1 type 2 diabetes register immediately , patient directly compare healthy control .</detailed_description>
