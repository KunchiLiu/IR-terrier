	<brief_summary>Recently report consistent percentage general population consider suffer problem cause wheat and/or gluten ingestion , even though CD wheat allergy . This clinical condition name Non-Celiac Gluten Sensitivity ' ( NCGS ) . In previous paper investigator suggest term 'Non-Celiac Wheat Sensitivity ' ( NCWS ) , since know component wheat cause symptom NCGS patient , investigator also show patient high frequency coexistent multiple food hypersensitivity . The clinical picture NCWS characterize combined gastrointestinal ( bloat , abdominal pain , diarrhea and/or constipation , nausea , epigastric pain , gastroesophageal reflux , aphthous stomatitis ) extra-intestinal and/or systemic manifestation ( headache , depression , anxiety , 'foggy mind , ' tiredness , dermatitis skin rash , fibromyalgia-like joint/muscle pain , leg arm numbness , anemia ) . Nowadays data available characteristic 'rheumatologic ' symptom NCWS patient . Therefore , aim present study : 1 ) investigate prevalence fibromyalgia-like joint/muscle pain NCWS patient , 2 ) search possible ultrasonographic alteration ( i.e . synovitis ) hand foot joint NCWS patient , 3 ) evaluate modification fibromyalgia-like joint/muscle pain NCWS patient gluten free diet period almost 6 month .</brief_summary>

This clinical condition name Non-Celiac Gluten Sensitivity ' ( NCGS ) . In previous paper investigator suggest term 'Non-Celiac Wheat Sensitivity ' ( NCWS ) , since know component wheat cause symptom NCGS patient , investigator also show patient high frequency coexistent multiple food hypersensitivity . CD immunological disorder whose best-known manifestation gastrointestinal symptom . However , early joint manifestation common frequently overlooked feature disease . Similarly , clinical picture NCWS characterize combined gastrointestinal ( bloat , abdominal pain , diarrhea and/or constipation , nausea , epigastric pain , gastroesophageal reflux , aphthous stomatitis ) extra-intestinal and/or systemic manifestation ( headache , depression , anxiety , 'foggy mind , ' tiredness , dermatitis skin rash , fibromyalgia-like joint/muscle pain , leg arm numbness , anemia ) .
