This double-blind , placebo control , ascend dose , multi-cohort trial . A total ninety-six healthy volunteer enrol 12 cohort . The study conduct two phase : single ascend dose ( SAD ) phase , follow multiple ascend dose ( MAD ) phase . In SAD , participant receive one dose SPR741 placebo . In MAD , participant receive multiple dos SPR741 placebo 14 consecutive day . In part , sequential cohort expose increase dos SPR741 .</detailed_description>
