	<brief_summary>The demand magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) pediatric patient increase due use medical diagnosis surveillance . Pediatric patient often require general anesthesia ( GA ) MRI due need prolonged immobility scan process obtain high quality image . Two widely use anesthetic technique pediatric MRIs volatile-based anesthesia use sevoflurane total intravenous anesthesia ( TIVA ) use propofol . Concerns raise regard potential neurotoxic effect anesthetic develop brain . Within animal literature , emerge evidence suggest sevoflurane propofol may cause inflammation , impact brain cell survival connection , thereby contribute possible cognitive dysfunction . However , give challenge extrapolate animal data human , relatively limited human cohort study examine long-term effect anesthesia exposure , inadequate information available make informed clinical decision regard choice optimal anesthetic agent MRI child . Therefore , study uniquely examine mechanism two widely use anesthetic short long-term impact developmental outcomes healthy child .</brief_summary>
