	<brief_title>Improving Value Care Patients With Severe Stasis Dermatitis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>SPECIFIC AIMS 2.1.1 Understand unmet need stasis dermatitis care patient provider perspective . PHASE 1 : Patients Access problem : Severe stasis dermatitis multifactorial condition mimic `` bilateral cellulitis '' . However , true bilateral cellulitis exceedingly rare case , misdiagnosis . The diagnosis cellulitis base primarily clinical appearance , share many feature severe stasis dermatitis . Objective measure diagnosis cellulitis rarely helpful , low sensitivity specificity rate fever , leukocytosis , tachycardia , blood culture , image study . Admissions cellulitis `` bilateral cellulitis '' United States frequent , represent nearly 4 % emergency admission 2010 , hospital stay average 5-7 day . Among factor highly associate increase length hospital stay patient , top four include chronic edema , use diuretic , elderly age , live alone2 . These patient likely severe low extremity swelling , complicate stasis dermatitis , difficulty manage chronic health condition . In recent study 145 patient admitted cellulitis , find 28 % incorrectly diagnose low limb cellulitis , venous stasis dermatitis common diagnosis mistake cellulitis 37 % case . This costly patient , provider , hospital , healthcare system . In outpatient inpatient setting , internist frequently prescribe diuretic reduce low extremity edema without award problem comprehensive evaluation underlying cause . This chronic condition require ongoing treatment , many form , must address primary cause . Gradient compression effective mean achieve relief , long-term management form treatment require breadth knowledge behalf provider patient . For provider example , multi-layer bandage must use acute phase reshape reduce size limb , appropriate stock compression grade length must choose , patient potential caregiver educate don doff stocking , application aid , appropriate hosiery care , skin care , use emollient , limb massage , exercise . Additionally , require stocking cover many insurance plan . Many patient non-adherent patient family member home health aide assist , patient understand importance stocking treatment patient disease . Providers may knowledge contact get patient assistance situation . As result , edema get bad , patient admit readmitted hospital relapse `` bilateral cellulitis '' low extremity . Phase 1 study approve University Hospitals Institutional Review Board January 2016 protocol investigator interview 27 inpatient ( 28 admission ) use structure survey . The result interview inform development tool kit improve care patient . The tool kit consist patient brochure , list stocking service available local medical supply house , order set include patient education include Expectation Management Medical Information ( EMMI ) module compression stocking , video patient story , train University Hospitals Home care aide motivational interview support adherence regular use gradient compression . PHASE 2 : Focus Groups Using in-depth interview inpatient select use criterion Phase 1 independent focus group provider , Principal Investigator obtain feedback refine item toolkit implement January 2017 . The focus group conduct assistance Clinical Translational Science Collaborative ( CTSC ) Behavioral Measurement Resource Center . The in-depth interview conduct either patient home inpatient . The interview may record Part 1 . The recording data download REDCap . There focus group comprise provider . This focus group explore perception provider unmet need remain patient . With information , investigator design educational material help align resource timely fashion avoid admission possible . The order set include guidance obtain consultation well specific order reduction low extremity edema monitor side effect compression . 2.1.2 Design education patient provider cue additional care need . PHASE 3 : Tools &amp; Education Access problem : Patients often admit hospital `` bilateral cellulitis '' despite fact patient true skin infection . A research study publish 2015 demonstrate 75 % inpatient dermatology consultation 'cellulitis '' result diagnosis `` pseudocellulitis '' . Our data phase 1 confirms 75 % patient admit low extremity cellulitis University Hospitals fact cellulitis , although 90 % receive antibiotic mean length stay 8.3 day . Patients provider may even aware misdiagnosis , stasis dermatitis improve leg elevation alone hospital stay . As result , care giver erroneously give intravenous antibiotic credit condition 's resolution . When recurs , history `` recurrent cellulitis '' add patient 's chart , cycle repeat . Providers may also struggle lack objective measure use diagnosis cellulitis severity , depend primarily clinical appearance . Unnecessary admission test expensive many way . For patient admitted hospital , standard treatment cellulitis IV antibiotic week . Prolonged bed rest hospital potent antibiotic problematic , especially old patient . It put risk impaired mobility , deep venous thrombosis , nosocomial infection , particularly Clostridium difficile , monetarily costly party involve . Alternative diagnosis need consider . Allergic contact dermatitis , know complicate stasis dermatitis , one possibility . Patients easily develop contact allergy component topical steroid topical antibiotic prescribe attempt treat dry , crack , fissure skin outpatient basis . However , many inpatient facility access regular dermatological consultation , local dermatologist may appropriate patch test experience patch test identify contact allergen set stasis dermatitis . Patient education material toolkit help patient know contact edema progress , patient home , go hospital , well information financial home care assistance relate manage chronic condition . Provider education material assist provider make correct diagnosis , order appropriate testing , understand consider admission , especially case `` bilateral cellulitis '' , involve specialty provider , align assistance patient . The goal help provider patient feel stuck attempt help patient manage chronic condition , especially patient already multiple admission . Measure value service identify step 1 2 . Investigators track number patient admission antibiotic `` bilateral cellulitis '' length stay two different time point : ( 1 ) ( 2 ) provider education ( e.g . clinical decision support electronic health record , contact information guide train home health aide ) . Investigators also track number readmission length stay patient two time point : ( 1 ) ( 2 ) patient education material implement ( e.g . educational brochure , information guide community medical supply house , improved access e.g increase use patch test inpatient ) . Investigators stratify patient see wound care center patch test compare patient , help good understand value service .</detailed_description>
