Twin gestation also increase risk low birth weight infant . Goldenberg et al demonstrated 1996 cervical length le 25 mm 24 week gestation twin pregnancy best predictor preterm birth &lt; 32 week , &lt; 35 week , &lt; 37 week . In 1999 , Souka et al report twin pregnancy cervical length le 15 mm 23 week gestation , preterm birth rate &lt; 32 week approximately 66 % . A Cochrane Review 2014 conclude place cerclage associate significant difference regard perinatal death neonatal morbidity , analysis form cerclage multiple gestation ( physical examination-indicated , history-indicated , ultrasound-indicated ) . It also state `` ultrasound-indicated cerclage appear associate increase risk composite adverse neonatal outcome , include respiratory distress syndrome , low low birthweight , give evidence consistent subgroup effect , observe result likely attributed chance . '' In 2015 retrospective cohort study twin pregnancy asymptomatic short cervix , Amanda Roman et al demonstrate similar result Cochrane Review patient CL &lt; 25 mm . However , show trend towards prolong pregnancy , decrease spontaneous PTB &lt; 34 week , few NICU admission subset patient CL &lt; 15 mm receive cerclage compare control . In February 2016 , Goya et al investigated role pessary woman twin gestation short cervix diagnose via ultrasound . A significant reduction rate preterm birth prior 34 week find pessary group ( 16.2 % vs 39.4 % ) , significant difference neonatal morbidity mortality . Chart review collect information document data collection sheet , include medical OB history , current pregnancy course , treatment short cervix information hospitalization include labor delivery , postpartum course neonatal birth information . The investigator analyse compare group woman use short cervix diagnosis , management decision outcomes antepartum period , labor , delivery post partum course possible sign symptom risk Pre Term Birth outcomes infant .</detailed_description>
