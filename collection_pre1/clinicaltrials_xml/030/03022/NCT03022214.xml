	<brief_summary>Since 1948 , health define `` state complete physical , mental social well-being , merely absence disease infirmity '' . However , grow school think suggest health represent ability adaptable flexible response daily stressor . It propose instead , view health `` towards ability adapt self-manage face social , physical emotional challenge '' , term `` resilience '' . The theory `` resilience '' relate health body 's capacity manage daily stressor ( physical activity oxidative fluctuation ) challenge homeostasis , return homeostasis result several physiological stress response . Although all-encompassing model , effect pathogens stress factor also relevant , study centre physiological aspect theory , focus disruption exercise .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The Nrf-2 pathway major cellular defence oxidative electrophilic stress . Briefly , follow dissociation Keap1 ( scaffold protein bind Nrf2 Cul3 ubiquitin ligase proteasome degradation ) , Nrf-2 accumulate nucleus activates antioxidant response element ( ARE ) promoter region many antioxidant gene , include catalase , glutathione peroxidase ( GPX ) , superoxide dismutase ( SOD ) . As , attractive target dietary pharmacological intervention aim increase resilience oxidative stress . Most diet-derived bioactive Nrf-2 inducer contain Michael acceptor group ( α , β-unsaturated carbonyl moiety ) . Curcumin , example , contain two Michael acceptor group know activator Nrf-2 . An additional bioactive Michael accepter group trans-cinnamaldehyde ( CA ) ( component find stem bark Cinnamomum cassia ) , , like curcumin , Nrf-2 activator dose-dependent manner . Therefore , purpose study assess effect bioactive Nrf-2 inducer , base presence α , β-unsaturated carbonyl moiety , resilience marker antioxidant enzyme activity marker oxidative stress , TBARS , exercise challenge . The hypothesis specific plant bioactive increase production antioxidant enzyme activity baseline , thereby decrease level TBARS upon exercise challenge . Ultimately , use novel resilience marker signature could significantly improve ability prove efficacy pro-oxidant dietary bioactive improve lifelong health , well target low resilience way make best use limit healthcare resource . The intervention supplement consist mix dietary bioactive α , β-unsaturated carbonyl moiety ( provide individual capsule ) , efficacy beneficially affect platelet activity , without H2O2 ( Hydrogen Peroxide ) challenge , recently establish : sulforaphane ( SUL ) , green tea extract ( epigallocatechin gallate ) ( EGCG ) cinnamaldehyde ( Cin ) . It intend use mix dietary bioactive propose human intervention study , different compound could affect multiple pathway therefore , broad efficacy . In addition , bioavailability compound may influence presence compound , suggest literature ( effect piperine EGCG bioavailability ) . Bioavailability data compound extracted literature use , alongside practical consideration , decide dose strategy . The desired composition supplement mix set follow : - SUL : ~ 14mg - EGCG : ~ 400mg - CIN : ~ 15mg These daily intake sufficient achieve micromolar quantity blood plasma 1 6 hour ingestion , perhaps longer . . Suitable food ingredient use study achieve intake source reputable supplier . These ingredient use give desired intake follow : - EnduraCell broccoli sprout powder ( added myrosinase ) : 1.5g ( sufficient provide ~ 45mg glucoraphanin , precursor SUL , release approximately ~14mg SUL ) . - Bulk Powders Green tea extract : ~ 900mg ( contain approximately 400mg EGCG ) . - Bulk Powders Cinnamon Bark Extract : 0.75g ( contain ~15 - 20mg Cin ) . Due envisage difficulty palatability , ingredient mix encapsulate . While one ingredient ( green tea extract ) available pre-encapsulated supplier , prefer obtain ingredient free powder , encapsulate size 00 capsule Science Sport . This avoid difficulty placebo blinding , capsule give similar appearance . Tests indicate daily dos cinnamon bark extract green tea extract represent 2 capsule , contain 375mg ( cinnamon bark extract ) 450mg ( green tea extract ) , daily dose broccoli sprout powder represent 6 capsule contain 250mg . Placebo capsule prepare use food grade microcrystalline cellulose . Microbial test carried supplement . For presentation volunteer , daily capsule divide two serving , one serving take morning breakfast , one serving take evening dinner . Each serve contain 5 capsule , follow : - EnduraCell broccoli sprout powder : 3 capsule - Bulk Powders Green tea extract : 1 capsule - Bulk Powders Cinnamon Bark Extract : 1 capsule One serving placebo intervention contains : • Placebo ( microcrystalline cellulose ) : 5 capsule Volunteers take 5 serving prior exercise challenge test follow : Day -2 : two serving ( one morning one evening ) Day -1 : two serving ( one morning one evening ) Day 0 : one serving ( one morning first meal ) Each serve capsule individually bag labelled unique identifier . Volunteers instruct take serve capsule twice per day , small volume water . They ask record unique identifier capsule serve consumption , along time consume . Compliance monitor via daily supplement log , well measure plasma SUL metabolites . Volunteers encourage minimise , far possible , high intake product rich sulforaphane ( cruciferous vegetable Brussels sprout , broccoli , cabbage , cauliflower , bok choy , kale , collard , broccoli sprout , chinese broccoli , broccoli raab , kohlrabi , mustard , turnip , radish , rocket ) , epigallocatechin gallate ( green tea ) cinnamaldehyde ( cinnamon ) , 2.5 day prior challenge test day .</detailed_description>
