	<brief_summary>Participant ask take part study glioblastoma anaplastic astrocytoma ( AA ) relapse ( come back ) treatment study doctor think best interest receive chemotherapy disease . Additionally , study doctor think may participant 's best interest also surgical procedure call laser interstitial thermal therapy ( LITT ) . LITT minimally invasive ( use small incision ) surgery method use laser destroy tumor cell . For procedure , study doctor use NeuroBlate system perform LITT combination MRIs software model focus laser affect brain cell . The goal clinical research study learn NeuroBlate system combination lomustine help control glioblastoma anaplastic astrocytoma ( AA ) return treatment . The safety combination also study .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Study Laser Interstitial Thermal Therapy ( LITT ) Recurrent Glioblastoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Study Drug/Procedure Administration : If participant find eligible take part study , schedule LITT procedure . An MRI perform day procedure produce image participant 's brain direct study doctor area treat . The LITT procedure perform next day . Participant sign separate consent form LITT procedure explain procedure risk detail . Participant receive standard care hospitalization surgery . Participant MRI within 48 hour procedure check status disease . Participant 14 - 35 day recovery LITT procedure . Participant take lomustine period . After recovery period , participant take lomustine mouth Day 1 every 42-day cycle . Participant take lomustine mouth empty stomach bed ( 2 hour 1 hour food ) . Length Treatment : Participant take lomustine 6 cycle . Participant longer able take study drug disease get bad , intolerable side effect , unable follow study direction . Participation study follow-up . Study Visits : On day LITT procedure : - Participant physical exam , include neurological exam . - Participant MRI scan help surgeon perform LITT . - Blood ( 2 teaspoon ) draw biomarker testing . Biomarkers find blood tissue may relate participant 's reaction study drug . - Tumor tissue collect confirm diagnosis biomarker test LITT procedure . Within 2 day LITT procedure , participant MRI . About 14 day LITT procedure : - Participant physical exam , include neurological exam . - Blood ( 2 teaspoon ) draw routine test . If participant become pregnant , also include pregnancy test . - Participant complete questionnaire quality life . - Participant MRI . When participant begin receive lomustine , study visit 42-day cycle . On Day 1 cycle : - Participant physical exam , include neurological exam . - Blood ( 2 teaspoon ) draw routine test . If participant become pregnant , also include pregnancy test . - Participant complete questionnaire quality life . - You MRI . On Days 15 29 cycle , blood ( 2 teaspoon ) draw routine test . At time study , extra test may perform doctor think need . The study doctor tell participant extra test . End-of-Study Visit : About 6 week stop study drug : - Participant physical neurological exam . - Participant complete questionnaire quality life . - Participant MRI scan . Follow-Up : Every 3 month participant 's last dose study drug , study staff call ask feeling . This call take 5-10 minute . If participant stop study drug reason disease get bad , visit clinic every 3 month unless disease get bad . At visit : - Participant physical exam , include neurological exam . - Participant complete questionnaire quality life . - Participant MRI . This investigational study . The NeuroBlate system FDA approve commercially available different type brain surgery . Lomustine FDA approve commercially available treatment brain tumor . LITT use NeuroBlate System combination lomustine treatment glioblastoma investigational . The study doctor describe study drug procedure design work . Up 37 participant enrol study . All take part MD Anderson .</detailed_description>
