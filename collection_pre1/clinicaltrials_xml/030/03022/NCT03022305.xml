	<detailed_description>Current literature show relationship hip joint flexibility shoulder range motion torque production athletes general population . It well establish limited hip joint internal rotation adduction , specifically baseball player , result limit trunk rotation pitch phase throwing . Due restrict rotation range hip joint , athletes try compensate diminish rotational momentum trunk produce excessive external rotation shoulder joint cock phase throw . Such compensation result laxity overstress shoulder joint structure . In long term , increase laxity joint affect normal muscle mechanic result decrease torque production shoulder joint . The investigator hypothesize neuromuscular realignment pelvis bone effective improve range motion torque production shoulder joint traditional exercise improve hip internal rotation adduction range motion . Group assignment : An equal number male female subject randomly assign one three group : Group one standard treatment improve hip range motion . Group two receive new neuromuscular approach improve pelvic alignment . Group three receive treatment . Participants examiner blind subject ' group assignment . Researchers inform subject randomly assign group exercise program one two timeframes : immediately initial assessment one-week waiting period . Subjects control group wait one week , ask test one time make sure subject 's physical condition change . At time , subject informed participation control group give option go treatment program choice . The neuromuscular treatment also offer subject standard group conclusion data collection period . Testing procedure : In pretest session , examiner , use standard goniometer , measure participant 's hip flexion , extension , adduction , abduction , internal rotation , external rotation passive range motion seat position . Then examiner assess participant 's pelvic alignment use Ober test Thomas test . Shoulder range motion also assess use standard goniometry procedure seat position . Shoulder torque production assess use Biodex isokinetic dynamometer . The following parameter assess use standard physical therapy technique : Hip Joint Assessment Hip range motion assessment Hip Flexion Hip Extension Hip abduction Hip adduction Hip internal rotation Hip external rotation Ober test : [ While low extremity still neutral transverse plane , examiner allow leg slowly lower full adduction . The test consider positive knee joint reach examination table . This test conduct side . ] Thomas test : [ While hold flexed knee chest , participant slowly lie back supine position examination table opposite leg hang freely edge table . The test consider positive free hang leg raise table subject lie supine position . This test conduct low extremity . ] Shoulder Joint Assessment Shoulder range motion assessment Shoulder Flexion Shoulder Extension Shoulder Abduction Shoulder Internal Rotation Shoulder External Rotation Assessment shoulder torque production : [ Assessed Biodex isokinetic dynamometer . ] Treatment procedure : Treatment procedure group one : Subjects standard treatment group perform 10 repetition active hip internal rotation , external rotation , abduction , adduction , flexion extension exercise daily , supervision treat therapist . Treatment neuromuscular train group two : Subjects group perform neuromuscular treatment pelvic alignment , suggest Postural Restoration Institute , day treat therapist supervision one week . Subject flex hip knee joint 90Â° rest foot wall standard 4 - 6 '' ball place subject 's knee . At position , subject instruct squeeze ball knee perform isometric hamstring muscle contraction ( statically pull foot downward without press wall ) . At point , subject instruct perform gentle posterior pelvic tilt avoid abdominal muscle contraction . While maintain position , subject instruct take deep breath nose slowly blow balloon . The subject instruct pause 3 second press tongue roof mouth prevent airflow balloon . After 4th breath , subject pinch neck balloon remove mouth . Then subject relax take foot wall . This exercise repeat daily one week ( Monday Friday ) . Following neuromuscular training exercise , patient perform coordinate hip internal external rotation exercise side lying . The treatment group act control group . Both standard treatment group offer free neuromuscular treatment conclusion posttest data collection .</detailed_description>
