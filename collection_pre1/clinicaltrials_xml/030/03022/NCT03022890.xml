	<brief_title>Study Yoga vs. Health Education Chronic Pain Persons Receiving Opioid Agonist Therapy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Chronic pain significant problem people receive opioid agonist therapy ( OAT ) opioid dependence - i.e. , buprenorphine/ naloxone ( BUP ) methadone maintenance treatment ( MMT ) . At least half patient receive BUP MMT report chronic pain . In population , chronic pain associate pain-related disability , psychiatric problem , physical problem , increase likelihood misuse opioids illicit drug , often lead provider terminate treatment . Several issue complicate pharmacologic pain treatment OAT patient , include opioid-induced hyperalgesia , increase tolerance opioids , illicit drug use , use benzodiazepine alcohol , patient ' fear medication addiction . Further , provider may insufficient education regard pain management OAT patient , difficulty resolve seem inconsistency pain management approach addiction management approach . There study non-pharmacologic treatment approach pain OAT patient . Cognitive-behavioral therapy may efficacious treat pain across range chronic pain condition , study CBT pain relief amongst substance abuser rare . Hatha yoga may beneficial adjunctive approach treat chronic pain , decrease pain-related disability , prevent opioid misuse OAT . Hatha yoga involve breath control ( pranayama ) , physical posture ( asana ) , meditation ( dhyana ) . Yoga include benefit relaxation training , physical activity , mindfulness training single unified practice . Further , yoga non-pharmacologic approach pain , therefore avoids many problem surround pharmacologic treatment chronic pain people receive OAT . Yoga promising approach treatment chronic pain people enrol OAT : 1 ) yoga evidence support ability reduce pain-related disability pain severity population ; 2 ) plausible cognitive/affective behavioral mechanism yoga may reduce chronic pain , decrease pain-related disability , reduce opioid misuse ; 3 ) yoga increasingly popular available ; 4 ) yoga complement type pain substance use treatment ; 5 ) yoga student may like focus improve overall health well-being rather `` fix '' problem . Thus , investigator propose conduct treatment development research would prepare u study whether yoga ( vs. health education control group ) might efficacious adjunctive treatment pain people enrol OAT opioid use disorder . The specific aim : To conduct pilot randomize clinical trial ( n = 40 ) hatha yoga vs. health education group ( attention control ) person chronic pain take methadone maintenance therapy ( MMT ) bupreonorphine ( BUP ) opioid use disorder maintenance treatment . Participants enrol active intervention 3 month , follow 6 month afterwards . Investigators ' aim : 1 . To assess feasibility acceptability yoga class health education control group . Investigators assess credibility assign intervention expectancy improvement group baseline , program satisfaction follow program participation , participant adherence ( class attendance rate amount home practice correspond assign study arm ) , instructor fidelity manual . Investigators conduct structure interview follow program participation understand specific aspect program consider attractive , useful , useful ; solicit suggestion improvement well . 2 . To assess safety , investigator track adverse event structure fashion . Investigators expect see serious adverse event definitely probably relate study participation . 3 . To assess feasibility research procedure , investigator benchmarks recruitment rate , retention study assessment , reliability instructor fidelity measure . Investigators use information collect participant interview well feedback yoga health education instructor expert addiction , chronic pain , yoga make modification intervention research procedure intend improve acceptability , feasibility , safety whenever possible . This project provide investigator material , experience , pilot data need next stage line research , namely , fully power randomized clinical trial . Hatha yoga potential decrease pain-related disability , pain severity , opioid misuse population people difficult-to-treat chronic pain .</detailed_description>
