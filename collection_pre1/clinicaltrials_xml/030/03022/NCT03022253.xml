	<detailed_description>Study Background : Preterm baby unique group patient Newborn Intensive Care Unit . Patent ductus arteriosus ( PDA ) common complication relate gestational age preterm birth . In infant bear less 32 week gestation , frequency PDA report 50 % 80 % . Physiologic ductus arteriosus closure occur first 3 day birth . The persistence PDA beyond first postnatal day life , however , frequently associate multiple severe complication , predominantly immature infant It currently believe ductus arteriosus ( DA ) closure involve two-step process . The first , 'provisional ' closure accomplish smooth muscle cell contraction ductus arteriosus ( DA ) constriction . Subsequently , proliferation cell within former DA lumen lead anatomical remodel DA permit permanent closure . Recently association absolute platelet count closure ductus arteriosus focus research . Various prospective retrospective study conduct . In 2015 systematic review meta-analysis Sorina et al show significant positive association PDA thrombocytopenia . Hence investigator plan randomize control trial look effect platelet transfusion closure rate ductus arteriosus . Research question : Do liberal platelet transfusion criterion achieve early PDA closure rate standard restrictive platelet transfusion criterion among thrombocytopenic preterm neonate ( &lt; 35 week gestation ) hemodynamically significant PDA presenting within first 14 day life ? Objectives : Primary objective : To determine whether liberal platelet transfusion criterion achieve early PDA closure rate within 120 hour compare standard restrictive platelet transfusion criterion among thrombocytopenic preterm neonate ( &lt; 35 week gestation ) hemodynamically significant PDA presenting within first 14 day life . Secondary objective : 1 . To determine time period platelet transfusion closure PDA . 2 . To compare 2 group : 1 . Proportion PDA open 24 hour last dose course medication 2 . Proportion PDA echocardiographically hemodynamically significant 24 hour last dose course medication 3 . Proportion PDA echocardiographically hemodynamically significant 120 hour randomization 4 . Cumulative volume platelet concentrate receive within 120 hour randomization 5 . Any kind clinical bleed within 120 hour randomization 6 . New onset Intraventricular hemorrhage ( IVH ) grade within 120 hour randomization 7 . New onset IVH grade 3,4 within 120 hour randomization 8 . Mortality within 120 hour randomization 9 . Mortality anytime hospital stay 10 . Duration hospital stay 11 . Reopening rate PDA initially close within 120 hour randomization Study Design : This randomize , open-label , controlled trial . Place study Newborn unit Department Pediatrics Post Graduate Institute Medical Education Research ( PGIMER ) , Chandigarh , India Study period : - Subject recruitment data collection : January 2016 December 2016 ( 12 month ) - Data analysis : January 2017 March 2017 ( 3 month ) - Writing dissertation : April 2017 June 2017 ( 3 month ) Screening criterion ( must fulfil ) : The investigator screen inborn outborn neonate ( admit Neonatal intensive care unit ( NICU ) Neonatal nursery ( NNN ) follow : 1 . Gestational age 346/7 week 2 . PDA detect first time le 14 day postnatal age Infants meet screen criterion undergo echocardiogram conduct 1st investigator platelet count include fulfill follow inclusion criterion mention . Procedure platelet count : The investigator draw 0.5 ml blood Ethylene diamine tetraacetic acid ( EDTA ) Container immediately send analysis emergency lab Room No . 24 situate Advanced Trauma Centre PGIMER Chandigarh . A technician measure platelet count use automate blood cell coulter ( Sysmex KX-21 Coulter ) situate lab . One co-investigators ( N.V. ) ensure facility platelet count available round-the-clock within turnaround time 2 hour subject enrol trial , also ensure quality control procedure . Procedure echocardiography : The first investigator ( JK ) perform echocardiogram SonoSite MicroMaxx Portable Ultrasound Machine . Extremely low birth neonate ( ELBW ) neonate screen first 48 hour per unit policy , rest undergo echocardiography clinical sign PDA . Before perform echocardiogram , first investigator use website-generated unique , random code number patient identifier . The first investigator take backup echocardiogram immediately external hard drive video file name website-generated random code number . One co-investigators ( VS SS ) review code numbered echocardiogram . VS SS mask identity clinical detail patient . The key code number maintain JK Sourabh Dutta ( SD ) . The echocardiographic diagnosis PDA VS SS consider gold standard . The following information record echocardiogram : 1 . Whether ductus arteriosus patent close . 2 . If patent , Transductal diameter , Ductal velocity , Antegrade leave PA diastolic flow , Left Atrium/Aorta ( LA/Ao ) ratio , E/A , Isovolumic relaxation time ( IVRT ) , Absent reverse diastolic blood flow pattern descend thoracic aorta . Patient information inform consent : The 1st investigator ( J.K. ) approach parent subject meet eligibility criterion possible enrollment study . The first investigator provide detailed information sheet also give verbal explanation study . The first investigator enroll neonates obtain write informed consent one parent . Baseline data : The investigator record baseline maternal neonatal data . Medical treatment PDA : As subject recruit trial hemodynamically significant PDA , medically treat . Details give intervention head . Some subject may recruit another ongoing RCT initial month trial . The RCT compare paracetamol ibuprofen blind fashion amongst subject hemodynamically significant PDA closure PDA . For subject , trial drug regime follow . The index trial affect co-recruited ongoing RCT . If particular dose medication give contraindication ( adverse effect adverse clinical condition ) arise course treatment , dose deferred safe administer dose . The duration medical treatment take total duration inclusive defer dose/s . Randomization : The investigator allocate patient accord stratified , block randomise design . The investigator stratify patient follow stratum : ) platelet count &lt; 50,000 per microliter b ) platelet count 50,000-100,000 per microliter . The Chief guide Sourabh Dutta ( S.D . ) generate randomisation sequence construct randomly vary , permute , even-numbered block stratum . The chief guide conceal block size end study . Each stratum independent randomisation sequence . After 1st investigator identifies stratum , S.D . randomly allocate subject intervention control group . The investigator ensure concealment allocation use serially number opaque seal envelope bear slip paper allocation group . Allocation group : Intervention group : The investigator transfuse platelet concentrate maintain platelet count 1 , 00,000 per microliter ( detail give Arms Intervention ) The investigator aggressively monitor platelet count intervention group , depend upon stratum subject enrol . In stratum baseline platelet count le 50,000 per microliter , little chance platelet count rise 100,000 per microliter single platelet concentrate transfusion . In stratum , two back back platelet concentrate ( 20 ml/kg ) transfuse without perform platelet count 2 test transfusion . In stratum baseline platelet count 50,000 100,000 per microliter , platelet count perform single transfusion . In stratum , platelet count repeat window period 2 hour end platelet transfusion . The investigator attempt club platelet count another blood sample clinical indication possible . The investigator attempt get post-transfusion platelet count within turnaround time 2 hour . If subject platelet count le 100,000 per microliter , investigator repeat platelet transfusion , , subject maximum volume 40 ml/kg/day platelet concentrate 24-hour period ( defined 8 AM 8 AM next day ) . The investigator temporarily stop transfuse platelet concentrate investigator get value 100,000 per microliter . In addition platelet count perform post-transfusion , investigator also perform platelet count follow indication : ( ) Clinical bleeds ( ii ) A routine platelet count every 24 hour PDA close criterion 120 hour post randomization meet . The platelet count clinical bleeds routine platelet count repeat case platelet count post-transfusion already available within window period 4 hour prior . Control group : ( detail give Arms Intervention ) In control group , investigator perform platelet count per standard unit practice . A platelet count repeat whenever subject next sample clinical indication longer routine sample even morning . A platelet transfusion repeat platelet count fall less 20,000 per microliter criterion meet . In group , platelet concentrate transfuse accord platelet count prior transfusion . In baby platelet count &lt; 50000 , 50-75000 75-1 , 00 , 00 per microliter investigator transfuse @ 20 , 15 10 ml/kg/transfusion respectively maximum 40 ml/kg/day . The investigator administer injection furosemide 0.5 mg/kg slow IV injection midway transfusion treat team clinically feel patient likely develop congestive cardiac failure pulmonary edema . Study endpoint : Subjects follow study early among 1 . Withdrawal consent 2 . Discharge hospital 3 . Death</detailed_description>
