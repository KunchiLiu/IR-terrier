	<brief_summary>This first human , single-center , randomize , placebo-controlled , double blind , sequential group Phase 1 study healthy subject conduct evaluate safety , tolerability , Pharmacokinetics ( PK ) , Pharmacodynamics ( PD ) follow escalation single multiple dos KM-819 . The study consist 2 part . In Part A , 5 cohort young adult male subject , 1 single dose cohort elderly male post menopausal female subject receive escalate single dos KM-819 . The food effect investigate one single dose cohort young adult male subject , crossed-over fed condition . Once dose level select crossed-over fed condition elderly subject , protocol amend specify dose level . In Part B , 4 cohort healthy young adult male subject 1 multiple dose cohort elderly male post menopausal female subject receive escalate multiple dos KM-819 . Part B conduct completion cohort young adult male subject Part A . Dose escalation next level determine use safety , tolerability , PK data previous cohort . Part A , Single Ascending Dose ( SAD ) Up 40 healthy young adult male subject 8 healthy elderly male post menopausal female subject enrol randomized receive either KM-819 placebo . Each 5 dose escalation cohort consist 8 healthy young adult male subject ; 6 subject receive 10 , 30 , 100 , 200 , 400 mg KM-819 2 subject receive placebo . In single dose cohort , dose subject sentinel , i.e. , 2 subject dose first day ( 1 subject receive active treatment 1 subject receive placebo ) remain 6 subject dose least 24 hour first 2 subject . Cohorts dose sequentially escalate dos . One cohorts crossed-over fed condition ass effect food decide Investigator Sponsor study completion 2nd dose cohort ( 30 mg ) . Eight elderly male post-menopausal female subject enrol additional cohort ; 6 subject receive KM-819 dose level exceed high dose test young adult male cohort 2 subject receive placebo . Part A consists Screening period 28 day , 3 day Confinement period subject hospitalize study activity . Subjects require return outpatient visit Day 4 , 7 Follow Visit Day 14 . The cohort crossed-over fed condition undergo procedure Outpatient Visit Day 4 . Subjects confine 3 day second time , require return outpatient Visit 5 ( Day 4 ) , Visit 6 ( Day 7 ) , Follow Visit 7 ( Day 14 ) . Part B , Multiple Ascending Dose ( MAD ) Up 32 healthy young adult male subject 8 healthy elderly male post menopausal female subject enrol randomized receive either KM-819 placebo . Each 4 dose escalation cohort consist 8 healthy young adult male subject ; 6 subject receive 30 , 100 , 200 , 400 mg KM-819 day ( QD ) 7 day 2 subject receive placebo . Cohorts dose sequentially escalate dos . Eight elderly male post-menopausal female subject enrol additional cohort ; 6 subject receive KM-819 dose level exceed high dose test young adult male cohort 2 subject receive placebo .</brief_summary>
