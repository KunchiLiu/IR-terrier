	<brief_title>An Investigator Initiated Open Label Study Evaluating Efficacy Tolerability Oral Apremilast Treatment Nail Psoriasis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Psoriasis vulgaris common inflammatory condition skin result scaly red itchy plaque . In addition affect skin , psoriasis also cause disease finger toe nail . Nail psoriasis chronic disease present follow clinical finding : splinter hemorrhage , leukonychia , red spot lunula , nail pitting , nail plate crumbling , hyperkeratosis , and/or nail plate separation nail bed . The characteristic nail finding associate nail psoriasis nail pitting , onycholysis rim erythema , oil spot . Special interest pay identify particular nail finding patient , however potential nail psoriasis symptom assess patient study . Due highly visible nature disease fingernail , nail psoriasis often result substantial deleterious effect patient 's quality life . Patients also significant pain disability due nail psoriasis . Psoriasis patient nail involvement know severe psoriasis disease diminish quality life compare psoriasis patient without nail disease . Patients nail psoriasis often also psoriatic arthritis , untreated psoriatic arthritis know lead joint destruction potentially severe morbidity . Nail psoriasis report incidence 80 90 % ( Jiaravuthiasan , et al ) . Because nail psoriasis cause substantial disease burden patient , critical safe effective treatment find specific type psoriasis . Unfortunately , nail psoriasis often difficult treat . Apremilast orally available small molecule inhibitor phosphodiesterase 4 ( PDE4 ) FDA approve treatment psoriasis psoriatic arthritis . PDE4 one main phosphdyesterases express immune cell , inhibition apremilast think increase cyclic adenosine monophosphate thereby decrease inflammatory response . Specifically , apremilast believed regulate pro-inflammatory cytokine include TNF-Î± , IL-23 , IL-17 , others . Apremilast show promising result treat psoriatic arthritis nail disease ; however data need regard effect nail psoriasis ( Kavanaugh , et al ) . We hypothesize apremilast prove highly effective treat nail psoriasis . We propose conduct open label clinical trial investigate efficacy tolerability apremilast treat nail psoriasis , follow package insert guideline treat patient apremilast .</detailed_description>
