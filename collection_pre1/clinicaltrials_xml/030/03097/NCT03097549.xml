	<brief_title>Mobile App-treatment Mixed Urgency Urinary Incontinence Women</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Urinary incontinence affect one fourth adult woman ( 1 ) . It may reduce quality life cost society high . The common type woman stress urinary incontinence ( SUI ) , i.e . leakage coughing , sneeze jumping . Urgency urinary incontinence ( UUI ) mix urinary incontinence ( MUI ) , combination stress urgency UI , together add nearly half case UI woman ( 1 ) . Many woman seek care , sometimes due embarrassment ( 2 ) . The recommend first line treatment three type UI woman pelvic floor muscle training ( PFMT ) life style advice , lead improvement cure two third patient ( 3,4 ) . In addition , bladder training might effective UUI MUI ( 3,4 ) . Bladder train combination PFMT lead improvement cure one sixth woman MUI ( 3 ) . Previous research also suggest psychological treatment could value woman UUI MUI ( 5 ) . The investigator previously demonstrate efficacy mobile app Tät® treatment SUI ( 6 ) . Apps potential improve symptom many chronic condition self-management intervention ( 7 ) . The investigator develop mobile app Tät®II woman UUI MUI aim determine mobile app effective self-treatment . Women consecutively recruit via website www.tät.nu ( www.econtinence.se ) . The woman answer online screening questionnaire automate response initial screening eligibility criterion . Informed consent bladder diary send ordinary post administrator study . After , woman answer web questionnaire include score instrument finally telephone interview conduct urotherapist doctor . The purpose telephone interview confirm clinical diagnosis UUI MUI , ascertain alarm symptom motivate examination ordinary health care make sure woman well inform study procedure . After telephone interview decide whether woman eligible participation . If eligible , interviewer send e-mail study coordinator mark `` Randomization '' . The order e-mails arrive incoming mail box tat2.am @ umu.se decide order randomization . An independent administrator generate allocation sequence prepare 130 numbered opaque seal envelope ( assignment equally distribute two study group ) . The study coordinator consecutively open one envelope participant ( order arrive mailbox ) mark number envelope coordinator list participant . The coordinator assign e-mail participant , instruction download apps . If assign treatment app group , unique code activate participant , enable participant activate complete app Tät®II include individual advice regard self-care recommend exercise base result questionnaire bladder diary . Two week randomization , activation status app control activate , participant receive e-mail ask whether experienced technical problem app . In case technical problem , get instruction e-mail telephone . After another week , new review activation status do app still activate - participant contact via telephone . Adverse event All participant encourage report adverse event may occur study either e-mail telephone . This information include e-mail get allocation treatment app information app group . Questions adverse event also include follow-up questionnaire 14 week randomization , study coordinator send group web-based questionnaire follow-up question score instrument bladder diary . The bladder diary send back post . Non-responders remind twice e-mail ( 2 4 week ) telephone ( 6 week ) . The participant information app group receive unique activate code get access complete app individual advice follow-up . The participant original information app group followed-up another 14 week follow-up questionnaire bladder diary time frame reminder . The result second follow-up original information app group compare result first follow-up serve quality control original study . This design allow u study long-term follow result later . Quality Assurance plan The study monitor accord Good Clinical Practice principle study research nurse Agneta Lindberg local Clinical Research Centre Region Jämtland Härjedalen ascertain proper procedure conduction , record report data . The monitor review study record , observe protocol procedure randomization process , ensure write informed consent correctly obtain . The first five participants-and one ten randomly select monitor- 100 % monitor state monitor plan . All study participant review informed consent procedure . According Medical Devices Directives ( Meddevs 2.7/3 ) report monitor adverse event serious adverse event necessary CE-marked ( Conformité Européenne ) device use study within intend use cover CE-marking . The app Tät®II use within intend use cover CE-marking ( Medical Product Agency , Sweden . Dnr:6.6.1-2016-97327 , PID ( Product identify number ) 149104 ) . Data Dictionary , see primary secondary outcome Plan miss data The questionnaire web-based every question , technically possible , mandatory . However , reason miss value , replace value correspond `` change '' , i.e . miss value follow-up replace participant´s baseline value miss value baseline replace follow-up value . A miss answer PGI-I follow-up assume `` unchanged '' . All data check out-of-range result , treat miss value . Sample size calculation Based result previous smartphone study finding Albers-Heitner et al , improvement ICIQ UI SF 2.5 point treatment app group 0.9 point information app group assume . To detect difference 80 % power , 2-side test significance 0.05 , sample size 49 need group . With expect drop-out rate 20 % , approximately 60 participant need group . The investigator therefore aim recruit 120 woman age 18 old via website www.tät.nu . Statistical plan Intention-to-treat analysis perform outcome measure . Baseline The two group compare baseline use Student´s t-test continuous variable , Pearson Chi-Square test categorical variable , Mann-Whitney U-test ordinal variable . Baseline data compare age , BMI , educational level , medication primary secondary outcome measure baseline . Primary outcome The primary outcome difference group mean ICIQ UI SF score follow-up linear mixed model analysis incorporate baseline data use . Secondary outcome Comparison group : For evaluate difference group mean ICIQ LUTS qol score follow-up , linear mixed model analysis incorporate baseline data use . For evaluate difference group regard change median Incontinence Episode Frequency baseline follow-up , Mann-Whitney U-test use . To evaluate difference group mean ICIQ-OAB score follow-up , linear mixed model analysis use incorporate baseline data . To evaluate difference group mean score non-validated Incontinence Catastrophizing Scale ( ICS ) follow-up , linear mixed model analysis use incorporate baseline data . For evaluate difference group regard change usage incontinence aid baseline follow-up , Mann-Whitney U-test use . The difference group regard PGI-I , question improvement use follow-up , analyse use Mann-Whitney U-test . Patient satisfaction . The proportion participant intend seek help first-line treatment analyse , item analyse treatment app group comparison do . Comparison within group : For comparison within group regard score ICIQ LUTS qol , pair t-test used . For comparison within group regard IEF , Wilcoxon signed-rank test use . For comparison within group regard score ICS , pair t-test use For comparison within group regard score ICIQ-OAB , pair t-test used . For comparison within group regard incontinence aid usage , Wilcoxon signed-rank test use .</detailed_description>
