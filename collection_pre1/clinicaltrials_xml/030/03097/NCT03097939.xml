	<brief_summary>The purpose study test hypothesis combine Immuno-Oncology ( IO ) strategy would see efficacy virally driven cancer like Nasopharyngeal Carcinoma ( NPC ) . Hence , combination study nivolumab ipilimumab Epstein-Barr virus ( EBV ) driven nasopharyngeal carcinoma .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Phase 2 Trial Ipilimumab Nivolumab Nasopharyngeal Carcinoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Nasopharyngeal carcinoma ( NPC ) endemic Southern China South-east Asia . Due peculiar chemosensitive nature disease low investment drug development Asia , paucity new therapy disease . While response rate repeat line chemotherapy average around 30 % , duration disease control remain dismal hence unmet need develop new therapy disease . These response rate fairly similar current monotherapy use anti-PD1 agent group . Of specific interest , combine IO strategy appear add significantly response rate select tumor melanoma , small cell lung cancer , Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor ( EGFR ) mutant lung cancer . It hypothesize combined IO strategy would similar good response virally driven cancer like NPC . Hence single arm study explore activity combination nivolumab ipilimumab EBV driven nasopharyngeal carcinoma ( NPC ) . The primary endpoint best overall response rate . Secondary endpoint examine clinical benefit rate 18 week , toxicity combination , immunological correlate .</detailed_description>

WOCBP use adequate method avoid pregnancy 23 week ( 30 day plus time require nivolumab/ipilimumab undergo five halflives ) last dose investigational drug Women childbearing potential must negative serum urine pregnancy test ( minimum sensitivity 25 IU/L equivalent unit HCG ) within 24 hour prior start nivolumab/ipilimumab Women must breastfeed Men sexually active WOCBP must use contraceptive method failure rate le 1 % per year . Men receive nivolumab/ipilimumab sexually active WOCBP instruct adhere contraception period 31 week last dose investigational product . Women childbearing potential ( ie , postmenopausal surgically sterile well azoospermic men require contraception Ability understand willingness sign write informed consent document . Any surgery must 28 day start study drug surgical wound must completely heal Patients chemotherapy radiotherapy within 4 week ( 6 week nitrosoureas mitomycin C ) prior enter study recover adverse event due agent administer 4 week earlier . Patients receive investigational agent . Patients exclude active brain metastasis leptomeningeal metastasis . Subjects brain metastasis eligible metastasis treat magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) evidence progression [ low minimum 4 week ] treatment complete within 28 day prior first dose IO administration . There must also requirement immunosuppressive dos systemic corticosteroid ( &gt; 10 mg/day prednisone equivalent ) least 2 week prior study drug administration . Patients exclude positive test hepatitis B virus surface antigen ( HBV sAg ) hepatitis C virus ribonucleic acid ( HCV antibody ) indicate acute chronic infection . History allergic reaction attribute compound similar chemical biologic composition nivolumab ipilimumab .

Pregnant woman exclude study ipilimumab potential teratogenic abortifacient effect . Because unknown potential risk adverse event nurse infant secondary treatment mother nivolumab ipilimumab , breastfeed discontinue mother treated nivolumab ipilimumab . Patients exclude known history test positive human immunodeficiency virus ( HIV ) know acquired immunodeficiency syndrome ( AIDS ) Patients exclude active , know suspected autoimmune disease . Subjects permit enroll vitiligo , type I diabetes mellitus , residual hypothyroidism due autoimmune condition require hormone replacement , psoriasis require systemic treatment , condition expect recur absence external trigger Patients exclude condition require systemic treatment either corticosteroid ( &gt; 10 mg daily prednisone equivalent ) immunosuppressive medication within 14 day study drug administration .
