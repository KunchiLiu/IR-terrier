	<brief_summary>This phase II trial study baseline safety efficacy NEPA ( Netupitant/Palonosetron ) prevention chemotherapy induce nausea vomit patient receive BEAM ( carmustine , etoposide , cytarabine , melphalan ) conditioning regimen prior Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation ( HSCT ) . Both netupitant palonosetron hydrochloride anti-nausea anti-emetic agent . NEPA recently approve combination antiemetic , contain fix dos netupitant ( neurokinin 1 ( NK1 ) receptor antagonist ) palonosetron ( 5-hydroxytryptamine 3 ( 5HT3 ) receptor antagonist ) . Having pharmacologically distinct mechanism , combine NEPA offer synergistic reduction potential elimination CINV</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Phase II Study Netupitant/Palonosetron ( NEPA ) Prevention Chemotherapy Induced Nausea Vomiting Before HSCT</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To assess efficacy NEPA prevent nausea vomit highly emetogenic ( BEAM ) condition regimen hematopoietic stem cell transplantation ( HSCT ) . The efficacy measure Complete Response ( CR ) define emesis rescue therapy hour 0-240 ( 6 day chemotherapy 4 day post chemotherapy ) . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : II . To differentiate response NEPA different phase chemotherapy-induced nausea . Specifically , CR assess hour 0-144 ( Acute phase ) hour 145-240 ( delayed phase ) , Complete Protection ( CP ) define CR plus nausea assessed hour 0-144 , 145-240 , whole period . OUTLINE : This regimen 6-day therapy course high dose ( highly emetogenic ) chemotherapy day 1 6 low risk chemotherapy acute emesis day 2 5 . Our plan dose NEPA day 1 , 3 , 6 cover complete course therapy continue monitor 4 day assess control delay CINV well acute . Treatment administer inpatient basis . Patients receive NEPA 300 mg/0.5 mg PO administer 60 minute prior chemotherapy Day 1 , Day 3. Day 6 . Dexamethasone 12 mg PO give 1 hour prior chemotherapy Day 1 8 mg PO give additional day condition chemotherapy ( Days 2 6 ) . Dexamethasone give day chemotherapy receive . BEAM HSCT chemotherapy condition regimen : Carmustine 300 mg/m2 IV Day 1 , Etoposide 200 mg/m2/day IV day 2 5 , Cytarabine 400 mg.m2/day IV day 2 5 Melphalan 140 mg/m2 IV day 6 MAINTENANCE : Patients monitor 4 day completion therapy ass control delay CINV well acute . Patients follow 14 day receive last dose NEPA potential adverse event .</detailed_description>

Also patient require take antipsychotic , appetite stimulant , medication antiemetic effect exclude medication replace therapeutic equivalent Female subject pregnant , positive serum Human Chorionic Gonadotropin ( hCG ) , lactate intend breast feed child . Pregnant woman exclude study hematopoietic stem cell transplant conditioning regimens include BEAM regimen potential teratogenic abortifacient effect . NEPA Pregnancy Class C. Because unknown potential risk adverse event nurse infant secondary treatment mother NEPA , breastfeed discontinue mother treated NEPA . These potential risk may also apply agent use study HIVpositive subject combination antiretroviral therapy ineligible potential pharmacokinetic interaction NEPA . In addition , subject increase risk lethal infection treat marrowsuppressive therapy . Appropriate study undertaken subject receive combination antiretroviral therapy indicate Subjects take neurokinin antagonist within 14 day prior begin BEAM regimen Subjects serum creatinine &gt; 2 x upper limit normal ( ULN ) Subjects severe renal failure End stage renal disease ( estimate GFR ( glomerular filtration rate ) &lt; 30 mL/Min ) estimate CockcroftGault formula Subjects severe hepatic insufficiency ( Child Pugh score &gt; 9 ) Subjects drink &gt; 5 alcoholic drink daily last year Subjects concurrent illness require systemic corticosteroid use plan dexamethasone conditioning therapy .
