	<brief_summary>Objectives To investigate impact tele-supervised prehabilitation functional capacity frail colon cancer patient undergoing colorectal resection evaluate effect prehabilitation muscle strength endurance , quality life ( QoL ) , executive function , fatigue inflammatory metabolic parameter . Methods A randomize control trial conduct . Patients randomise either prehabilitation group ( PREHAB ) control group . Prehabilitation group participate 4-week telerehabilitation surgery control group receive usual care World Health Organization recommendation physical activity health surgery . Program exercise consist three moderate-intensity aerobic resistance session per week . Subjects assessment baseline , pre-intervention 8 week surgery . The primary outcome functional capacity measure use 6-min walk test . The secondary outcome : physical measurement , QoL , level physical activity , executive function , fatigue , body composition , blood test , energy expenditure .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Objectives Primary objective : To assess 4-week tele-supervised prehabilitation effective improve post-operative cardio-respiratory fitness frail colon cancer patient . Secondary objective : To examine 4-week preoperative tele-supervised prehabilitation beneficial effect muscle strength endurance , quality life , executive function , fatigue , inflammatory parameter metabolic disruption pre-surgery . Background In Belgium , colon cancer third common cancer men second common woman second cause cancer death . Surgery currently primary treatment stage I III . Studies show patient poor preoperative physical fitness less able cope adverse effect surgery hospitalization result increase risk mortality , postoperative complication functional recovery time . Moreover , approximately 60 % colon cancer patient older 70 year diagnosis 50 % old cancer patient frailty pre-frailty . Frailty state vulnerability decrease functional reserve , impairment dysregulation several physiological system , reduce capacity recover physiological homeostasis stress . Nowadays , frail definition clearly define . One widely accept definition use Fried criterion include assessment weight loss , physical exhaustion , physical activity level , grip strength walk speed . Preoperative frail colon cancer patient significantly high risk adverse postoperative outcome include institutionalization , length stay , morbidity mortality . It seem relevant intervene preoperative period improve patient 's functional capacity surgery , via physical training overcome stress surgery improve postoperative recovery . This process call `` prehabilitation '' . Structured supervise program show effective feasible . However , time , resource expensive care often barrier patient . Thereby , home-based tele-supervising rehabilitation would attractive therapeutic option offer distinct advantage regard . To date , study study effect tele-supervised prehabilitation `` frail '' patient . Study design A single-blind , randomize , control trial conduct . Participants randomize either prehabilitation group control group . An assessor blind group allocation collect outcomes measure participant . Study sample To eligible study participant need meet follow criterion : diagnosis colon cancer require surgery ; 65 year age ; able read , write understand French ; Frailty phenotype criterion ≥ 3 . Frailty assess use component Frailty Phenotype , first develop Fried et al. , consist five criterion : weight loss , exhaustion , low physical activity , slowness , weakness . Participants exclude physical impairment would seriously impair physical mobility ; surgery emergency ; neuropsychiatric disease . Intervention Participants allocate prehabilitation group undertake telerehabilitation program start 4 week surgery participant control group receive usual care World Health Organization recommendation physical activity health surgery . The telerehabilitation program combine aerobic resistance training three session per week . Each 60-min session begin end five-minute warm-up/cool . The warm-up follow 25 minute aerobic training . Aerobic exercise include brisk walking , jogging , cycling , swim accord patient 's preference . The intensity exercise set 60 à 75 % maximum heart rate ( maximal heart rate=220 - age ) . And 12 16 Borg 's Rating Perceived Exertion Scale . Each participant wear heart monitor . The aerobic training follow resistance exercise perform eight exercise target major muscle group ( abdominal , hamstring , quadriceps , triceps , gluteus maximus , paraspinal muscle shoulder muscle ) . Intensity must 12 16 Borg 's Rating Perceived Exertion Scale . A physiotherapist provide detailed information program . The patient receive brochure description picture exercise video include resistance program record website . The researcher conduct weekly telephone call participant . The aim call solve problem carry training session discuss possible adverse event . Moreover , researcher give message support encouragement improve adherence program . Outcome measure Outcome measure assess three time point : baseline ( T0 ) , one day schedule date surgery ( T1 ) 8 week surgery ( T2 ) . Primary outcome cardiorespiratory fitness 6min walk test ) . Secondary outcome muscle strength endurance ( isokinetic dynamometer 1-min sit-to-stand-test ) , quality life ( EQ-5D-3L questionnaire ) ; level physical activity ( International Physical Activity Questionnaire Short Form ) ; fatigue ( Functional Assessment Cancer Therapy : Fatigue ) ; executive function ( Trail Making test fluency verbal test ) ; blood test ( neutrophil lymphocyte ratio , C reactive protein , fast glucose , fast insulin cholesterol measure bioelectrical impedance analysis ) ; energy expenditure ( Sensewear® armband ) .</detailed_description>
