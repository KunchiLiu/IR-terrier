	<brief_summary>Hypothesis : The hypothesis study physiotherapeutic re-education pre-activation transverse abdominal muscle decrease pain intensity patient chronic non-specific low-back pain least 30 % effective conventional treatment . Aims : principal aim determine effectiveness physiotherapeutic re-education program base pre-activation transverse abdominal muscle pain intensity adult patient diagnose chronic non-specific low-back pain compare conventional treatment primary care set . The secondary aim study assess effect physiotherapeutic re-education program base pre-activation transverse abdominal muscle : ( 1 ) disability limitation development activity daily live associate LBP , ( 2 ) transverse abdominal muscle muscle contraction , ( 3 ) ass whether resistance training parameter apply old adult valid young adult ( 4 ) determine whether training protocol use cervical spine could extrapolate lumbar spine .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>This study parallel randomize controlled trial . Participants 18-65 year old , diagnose chronic nonspecific low-back pain , sign informed consent , include study . Participants exclude diagnosed cognitive impairment , presence `` Red Flag '' identify , woman pregnancy postpartum less three month participant difficulty understand and/or speak Spanish Catalan . Based upon result systematic review effectiveness physical therapy base treatment low back pain , reduction 15 point pain intensity assess Visual Analogue Scale consider sample size calculation . Therefore , accept alfa risk 0.05 , beta risk le 0.2 assume 15 % withdrawal sample size 108 participant estimate study . Participants recruit Primary Care Centers city Lleida ( Catalonia , Spain ) . They first contact telephone suitability participant assess trough brief interview . After participant selection via telephone , meet inclusion criterion invite personal interview researcher order solve doubt read sign write informed consent . To ensure participant understand study , simply ask general study information ( i.e . objective , treatment control condition , etc. ) . The included participant assign either experimental control group use simple randomization method . The allocation conceal , physiotherapist make assessment ( pre- post-treatment follows-up ) participants researcher manage result data . Participants experimental group receive individualize physiotherapeutic re-education program base pre-activation transverse abdominal muscle . The intervention last 4-weeks consist two weekly session 30-35 minute . Each session divide two main part ( 1 ) warm-up ( 2 ) re-education pre-activation transverse abdominal muscle . 1. . Warm-up ( 5 minute ) : lumbopelvic dissociation exercise , increase difficulty week . 2. . Re-education pre-activation transverse abdominal muscle ( 25-30 minute ) First session : participant learn contract appropriately transverse abdominal muscle basic easy exercise . In order facilitate contraction , one physiotherapist monitor lumbopelvic motion placing Pressure Biofeedback Unit participant ' lumbar spine . The author calculate 75 % one-rep max ( 1RM ) second participant maintain 75 % 1RM contraction . This allow establish individualize time carry exercise follow session . Following session : 16 re-educational exercise design . In session , participant perform four different exercise , increase week difficulty degree load . The participant perform exercise base 75 % 1RM calculation , complete 3 series 9 repetition , hold repetition maximum 6 second . It pause 4 sec . exercise pause 60 second series . The 75 % 1RM calculated session . Participants control group follow conventional treatment prescribe general practitioner primary care . Participants group assess pre- post-treatment follow-up 3 , 6 12 month . All statistical analysis carry use statistical program 'PASW 20 ' . An intention treat analysis perform . Expected outcome : author expect patient experimental group achieve great ( 1 ) reduction pain intensity , ( 2 ) improvement disability associate CLBP , ( 3 ) improvement development activity daily live , ( 4 ) contraction transvers abdominal muscle , compare patient control group .</detailed_description>
