	<brief_title>MRI Spectroscopy Neuropsychological Functioning Phenylketonuria</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Despite newborn screen early initiation treatment , many adolescent adult PKU experience degree neuropsychological dysfunction mood disturbance . Blood phenylalanine ( Phe ) level low level tyrosine ( Tyr ) partially explain individual PKU difficulties others . In study , investigator use new approach involve magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) magnetic resonance spectroscopy ( MRS ) measure brain Phe ( brain chemical ) order determine relationship brain biomarkers neuropsychological function mood . Previously , brain Phe Tyr could reliably measure MRS method , especially concentration likely find individual treat PKU . This project use improve method measure brain Phe Tyr . The investigator use two-dimensional shift correlate magnetic resonance spectroscopy ( COSY ) . COSY non-invasive method allow quantitative measurement Phe , Tyr amino acid brain . This project potential close one important gap knowledge PKU , namely define PKU affect brain . The aim study examine brain Phe Tyr individual PKU age-matched healthy comparison group , 2 ) determine association Phe Tyr distinct brain region measure neuropsychological function mood . Participants PKU receive 2 MRI scan spectroscopy comparison group receive 1 MRI scan spectroscopy fast condition . All participant provide blood specimen blood amino acid determination receive neuropsychological testing . The investigator develop statistical model apply future study enhance understanding PKU . This pilot study important provide evidence usefulness COSY . COSY potential explain individual difference PKU , identify specific cognitive function mood disturbance relate high brain Phe low brain Tyr , offer additional marker endpoint evaluate new treatment clinical trial .</detailed_description>
