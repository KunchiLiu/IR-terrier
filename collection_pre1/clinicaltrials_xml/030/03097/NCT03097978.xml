	<brief_summary>Targeted Muscle Reinnervation increase control signal available commercial arm system . A new type control , pattern recognition , develop form allows use commercially available arm system . The goal project home trial , people TMR try new control new arm find well currently available . Home trial also allow u see needs do make invention work even well .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Subjects participate return RIC several time ( approximately 6-8 time ) undergo necessary training test . Each visit last 2-5 day . The study include use three different prosthesis control system home approximately 6 week . The order system randomize . The first visit allow u cast subject 's residual limb socket measure gel liner make embedded electrode contact prior next return . The socket interface fit optimal comfort suspension sleeve and/or strap , fasters , etc best hold prosthesis securely residual limb activity require . Unless change need due change limb volume , socket use phase study . During initial subsequent visit , subject may practice various control method use virtual reality system . EMG data virtual `` game '' use practice control provide quantitative data use assess various control method mathematically , without prosthesis . Each phase study ( 4 phase ) , include preliminary training test RIC last 1-5 day , follow approximately 6 week at-home use system . After time subject return RIC 2-3 day test . They train pre-tested use next control visit later date . These system include commercially available myoelectric prosthesis standard control , commercially available device advance control ( call pattern recognition ) , commercially available device pattern recognition new electrode configuration . Photographs video recording make participation research study . These picture video recording essential proper data analysis . During at-home use period subject go daily business use test prosthesis ask document experience prosthesis via weekly phone communication study staff . Dates/times coordinate normal business hour At end at-home use period subject return RIC 3-5 day , ask complete questionnaire prosthesis work , undergo non-invasive test see well control use prosthesis .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>A upper limb amputation transhumeral shoulderdisarticulation level Successful TMR surgery Previous success operate myoelectric prosthesis use surface EMG signal reinnervated muscle ( necessarily current prosthesis usage , although current prosthesis user may likely use trial prosthesis ) . Significant new injury would prevent use prosthesis : The ability consistently wear prosthesis perform activity daily live specific performance task necessary evaluate relative benefit intervention . Cognitive impairment sufficient adversely affect understand compliance study requirement , ability communicate experience , ability give inform consent : The ability understand comply requirement study essential order study generate useable , reliable data . The ability obtain relevant user feedback questionnaire informal discussion add significant value study . Of note , TMR patient date normal cognitive function aware new brain injury would preclude participation Significant co morbidity : Any medical issue injury would preclude completion study , use prosthesis , would otherwise prevent acquisition useable data researcher .</criteria>
