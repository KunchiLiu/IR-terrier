	<brief_summary>This clinical trial evaluate use peritumoral injection near-infrared dye indocyanine green identify lung lesion sentinel lymph node . The primary purpose determine use ICG inject via navigational bronchoscopy , CT-guided transthoracic allow u identify first lymph node drain tumor , thus would likely site metastatic disease , remove analysis improve ability detect tumor node remove additional site potentially contain tumor cell . Using intraoperative imaging technique , aim improve identification lung nodule resection intraoperative identification sentinel lymph nodes event lymphadenectomy perform .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Patients enrol study undergo peritumoral injection near-infrared dye indocyanine green around lung lesion within adjacent segmental bronchus time surgery . ICG injection carry via navigational bronchoscopy , CT-guided trans-thoracic ICG injection ( dependent lesion location ) ICG image sentinel lymph node undertaken use NIR-enabled camera . - This study design primarily determine safety feasibility intra-operative localization thoracic lesion follow ICG injection , second , include assessment predictive value sentinel lymph node relative disease status great lymphadenectomy specimen well disease recurrence rate . - We use dose approximately 100 time low previously approve injection blood . After minute , surgeon look lymph node near-infrared fluorescence remove fluorescent non-fluorescent lymph node near tumor , standard lung surgery . - The `` filtered '' near-infrared light cause indocyanine green dye fluoresce surgeon identify lymph node likely contain tumor cell . If lymph node find group node usually remove , use near-infrared light look near tumor sentinel lymph node guide surgeon sentinel node remove study . The surgeon continue operation remove tumor . The lymph node process special analysis tailor finding metastasis sentinel lymph node . - As standard care , patient monitor evidence recurrence surgeon . Recurrences record .</detailed_description>
