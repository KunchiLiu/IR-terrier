	<detailed_description>Myocardial infarction common , morbid mortal disease . This study examine clinical effect treatment well molecular mechanism . Evaluating patient emergency department ( ED ) daily occurrence every practicing emergency physician country . Every year approximately 4.5 million visit ED chest pain 1.5 million hospitalization acute coronary syndrome ( ACS ) .2 Despite prevalence , ACS difficult diagnosis evaluate manage ; involve take thorough history perform physical well perform electrocardiogram ( ECG ) biomarker analysis . The pathogenesis unstable angina non-ST segment elevation myocardial infarction ( NSTEMI ) involve occlusive narrow coronary artery , usually atherosclerotic plaque . The downstream effect inadequate oxygen delivery myocardium , result cell death . Ischemic condition protective mechanism brief episodes ischemia protect heart ischemia-reperfusion injury . There two type ischemic conditioning commonly refer literature : pre-conditioning post-conditioning . In example pre-operative coronary artery bypass graft ( CABG ) patient may experience degree ischemia peri-operatively , ischemic conditioning perform surgery prevent limit myocardial injury . In example patient ongoing STEMI go interventional cardiology suite percutaneous intervention , post-ischemic conditioning therapy may prevent limit myocardial injury . A `` remote '' qualifier specifies therapy implement induce ischemia location heart . The investigator propose leverage novel technique metabolomics well study mechanism behind ischemic post-conditioning . This study pair clinical human data molecular data . It novel theoretical concept field investigator believe methodology basis future research . The investigator utilize metabolomics tool gain mechanistic insight potential mechanism action behind ischemic conditioning . Metabolomics burgeon field molecular biology study metabolome , catalogue material product every biochemical reaction body occur point time . As , metabolome ever change reflect body , respond , , much 2,500 know human metabolite . Because large amount data available technique , proper analysis require use proprietary statistical software account effect random chance data . The particular innovation methodology compare study date pair biological well clinical data analysis . This mean even investigator find difference troponin level treatment control group , investigator data investigate next able detect biological response remote post-ischemic conditioning induces . If particular therapy develop , least investigator know appropriate mechanism work perhaps could target pharmaceutical future . Finally , investigator detect difference , serve argument potential ischemic post-conditioning NSTEMI population .</detailed_description>
