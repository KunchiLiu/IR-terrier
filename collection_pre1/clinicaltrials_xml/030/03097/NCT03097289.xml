	<brief_title>In Vivo Recovery Survival Study Platelets Collected Trima Accel System Stored InterSol Solution</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Platelets suspend platelet additive solution ( PAS ) collect transfuse Europe 20 year . These PAS solution outside United States ( US ) tie apheresis device ; however US , PAS solution traditionally link corresponding apheresis device . Currently US , two solution approve Food Drug Administration ( FDA ) PAS replacement 65 % plasma platelet component . Isoplate Solution approve use Trima AccelÂ® Automated Blood Collection System ( Trima Accel System ) InterSol Solution approve use Amicus Separator System . Terumo BCT pursue FDA clearance InterSol combination Trima Accel system order provide blood center option use InterSol well Isoplate Solution collect platelet store PAS . This prospective , open-label , multicenter , control study . Up 40 healthy adult subject enrol study ensure 24 evaluable subject across two Investigational Sites . Evaluable defined subject complete recovery survival procedure neither subject product meeting Clinical Investigation Plan ( CIP ) analysis exclusion criterion . The additional platelet donor account screen failure , incomplete procedure CIP exclusion . Two ( 2 ) set platelet collect subject : 1 . A Test unit - A hyperconcentrated platelet product collect Trima Accel system dilute final ratio 65 % InterSol/35 % plasma addition InterSol directly platelet bag Trima Accel system collection . 2 . A Control sample - Fresh platelet prepared whole blood sample drawn subject Study Day 5 accordance standard procedure . Eligible donor sign informed consent enrol . SUBJECT PROCEDURES Screening perform within 5 day apheresis procedure combine Apheresis visit . The following evaluation perform : 1 . Informed consent obtain prior initiate study specific procedures 2 . Eligibility confirm 3 . Demographics ( age , gender , race , ethnic origin ) , height , weight 4 . Record medical history per AABB criterion healthy donor Apheresis Visit The following procedure perform : 1 . Eligibility confirm 2 . Finger stick hemoglobin 3 . Apheresis procedure Apheresis procedure run accord instruction precaution describe commercially available Trima Accel Operator 's Manual . The Investigator designee perform venipuncture , monitor subject collection , assess provide intervention adverse effect , remove needle , dress puncture site monitor subject recovery . The following information document : 1 . Trima procedure detail 2 . Adverse event ( AEs ) 3 . Medications treat adverse event 4 . Device deficiency Infusion Day Visit Five ( 5 ) day study subject complete apheresis procedure collect Test platelet , return donation fresh Control platelet , reinfusion radiolabeled Test Control platelets , post-infusion sampling . The following procedure conduct : 1 . Confirm eligibility 2 . Conduct pregnancy test woman childbearing potential ( serum urine ) 3. Review adverse event since previous visit 4 . Collect whole blood sample production Control platelets 5 . Radiolabel Test Control platelets prepare infusion 6 . Infuse radiolabeled combined Test Control platelets subject 's vein 7 . Collect 5-10 mL blood sample pre- post-infusion test use opposite arm infusion The following documented : 1 . Vital sign ( blood pressure , heart rate , temperature ) 2 . Adverse event 3 . Medications treat adverse event The subject return study site daily ( except weekend ) Study Day 6 Study Day 12 . A total 5 blood sample require collected 7 day period order subject 's data evaluable . The subject also return study site final visit Study Day 16 . At visit blood sample collect test . The following documented : 1 . Adverse event 2 . Medications treat adverse event</detailed_description>
	<criteria>1 . Age 18 year old 2 . Normal health status per AABB criterion healthy donor 3 . Able commit study schedule 4 . Meets inclusion criterion define Blood Center apheresis platelet PAS collection Trima Accel system . These criterion base FDA Regulations AABB standard . Note : Participants defer volunteer community donation travel restriction , piercings , tattoo may participate study , product transfuse 5 . Participants childbearing potential ( either male female ) must agree use effective method contraception course study 6 . Female childbearing potential must willing take pregnancy test prior infusion radiolabeled platelet 7 . Has give write informed consent 1 . Previously receive radiation therapy 2 . Has diagnose platelet disorder ( ie , platelet dysfunction ) 3 . Already participate 4 research study involve radioisotope within contemporaneous calendaryear 4 . Pregnant nursing female 5 . Participation currently , within last 12 month , another investigational trial would potentially interfere analysis investigation 6 . History known hypersensitivity indium chromium 7 . Treatment aspirin aspirin contain medication within 7 day apheresis treatment nonsteroidal anti inflammatory drug ( NSAID ) , antiplatelet agent drug affect platelet viability within 3 day apheresis ( eg , ibuprofen NSAIDs )</criteria>
