	<detailed_description>Background Postoperative ileus frequently occur surgical complication . It define temporary inhibition propulsive bowel activity manifest abdominal distention , nausea vomit diet intolerance . It may lead prolonged hospital stay , hospital-acquired infection complication may require additional treatment ( analgesia , intravenous fluid administration , electrolyte replacement , nasogastric tube decompression etc . ) result increase medical cost . Surgeons continually try find way shorten postoperative ileus . The mean diverse include advance diet tolerate , avoid use nasogastric tube , early ambulation , occasional use gastrograffin alvimopan ( selective μ-receptor opioid antagonist ) use minimally invasive surgery ( laparoscopic colectomy ) rather laparotomy . Asao et al show chew gum laparoscopic colectomy lead early return bowel function shorten hospital stay , probably via cephalic-vagal reflex increase production gastrointestinal hormone associate bowel motility . However , , strategy drug consistently effective accelerate bowel recovery abdominal surgery . Coffee popular beverage know influence central nervous system cardiovascular system . Although coffee stimulate intestinal function healthy volunteer , mechanism coffee stimulate intestinal motility still unknown . The cholinergic anti-inflammatory pathway ( CAIP ) propose key mechanism brain , vagus nerve , modulate immune system spleen . Vagal stimulation nicotine show reduce intestinal inflammation improve postoperative ileus . It known caffeine stimulate vagal activity . An average cup caffeinated coffee contains 50-150 milligram caffeine , depend type , concentration amount coffee consume . The gastrointestinal system stimulate substantial caloric intake , acidity , osmolality , volume load . The caloric content coffee negligible ( approximately 1 kcal/ 100 mL ) . It pH vary 5 6 ( less acidic beverage similar effect bowel motility ) . Brewed filtered coffee hypotonic ( water serf control drink previous study ) . Therefore , seem gastrointestinal effect coffee probably attribute physicochemical property biochemical activity one several many active compound coffee . In study conducted 1990 , 29 % healthy volunteer claim coffee induced desire defecate . The effect caffeinated coffee recto-sigmoid motor activity investigate manometry . The activity accelerate four minute intake either regular decaffeinate coffee . However , water comparable effect recto-sigmoid motility . Caffeine , stomach , act upon gastric myenteric submucous nerve induce gastric emptying . The influx digestive metabolite small intestine may stimulate gastrocolic reflex possible mechanism behind caffeine cause need defecate shortly consumption . The ultimate result reflex mediate caffeine increase anal sphincter contraction power less neural input require induce contraction ( decreased sensory threshold ) . Rao et al . perform ambulatory manometry insert catheter rectum mid transverse colon . They investigate effect 240 mL regular coffee , 240 mL decaffeinate coffee , 240 mL water 1000 kcal meal colonic activity . Regular coffee , decaffeinated coffee calorie-rich meal induce colonic contraction water . Moreover , regular coffee induce colonic contraction great intensity compare caloric-rich meal , 60 % strong water 23 % strong decaffeinated coffee . A randomized control trial performed 2012 University Heidelberg among patient laparoscopic colectomy , studied effect coffee duration postoperative ileus . The study show time first bowel movement significantly short group ( 40 patient ) receive 3 caffeinated coffee cup per day compare group ( 40 patient ) receive water . No significant side effect observe active treatment group . Dulskas.A et al . conduct randomize control study 2015 evaluate whether consumption 100 mL coffee effective reduce postoperative ileus . The study show coffee consumption colectomy safe decaffeinate coffee associate short time bowel movement tolerance solid food time ﬁrst ﬂatus ; caffeinated coffee impact duration postoperative ileus . In study carry far , none could explain mechanism coffee stimulate intestinal motility determinant agent action still discussion : either caffeine another component coffee , chlorogenic acid melanoidins . Aim The purpose study evaluate whether use caffeine post-operative period significantly reduce duration postoperative ileus , therefore , improve recovery shorten hospital stay . The study hypothesis post-operative use caffeine reduce time recovery GI function ( i.e . reduce post-operative ileus ) least 15 hour thus reduce hospital length stay least 15 hour patient undergo elective colorectal operation . Methods This single-centered , prospective , randomize control , double blind trial . 50 patient due undergo large bowel resection via laparotomy laparoscopy enrol . Patients randomize ( 1:1 ) receive caffeine ( study group ) receive placebo ( control group ) . Randomization occur via online program ( www.randomizer.org ) assign participant experimental condition . Patients study group give 100 milligram caffeine citrate orally dilute 50 milliliter apple flavored water patient control group give 50 milliliter apple flavor water . Administration caffeine placebo occur three time per day start morning postoperative day 1 surgery passage flatus per rectum occur first time maximal period time 7 day , whichever come earlier . Sample size calculate 50 patient ( 25 pt group ) require order 1-sided α level 0.05 power 0.80 detect difference 15 hour duration postoperative ileus ( standard deviation 21 hour ) , support prior study . Any difference 15 hour group statistically significant . Caffeine water supply surgical floor per participate patient pharmacy coordination one co-investigators un-blinded . At floor caffeine water dilute apple flavored water supply pharmacy , prior dose . The investigator ( aside single un-blinded co-investigator ) primary team doctor nurse blinded patient 's assignment . Postoperative care patient administration caffeine placebo . Patients instructed avoid consuming product contain caffeine ( e.g . coffee , tea , chocolate , cola etc . ) first passage flatus . No restriction food beverage consumption impose usually patient undergo kind surgery . The patient hospitalize surveillance monitoring primary team study period . They instruct keep mind note endpoint ( time first flatus , time first bowel movement , time tolerate solid diet ) report primary team study investigator routine round . The criterion hospital discharge include stable vital sign febrile morbidity ≥24 hour , passage stool , toleration regular diet absence complication . Safety Endpoints - Any adverse event deem possibly , probably definitely related treatment caffeine : arrhythmia , muscle crumps/tremor , restlessness , irritability , headache , dizziness , tachycardia , allergic reaction ( rare ) severe manifestation attribute caffeine side effect . - Any major adverse event result surgery might interfere caffeine might lead meaningless endpoint data : organ failure , anastomotic leakage , intraabdominal abscess invasive re-intervention ( Clavien-Dindo classification surgical complication &gt; 3 ) . Patients Patients schedule laparoscopy open elective colon resection ( right left hemicolectomy , sigmoid resection , anterior resection , segmental colectomy ) , oncologic inflammatory indication , willing participate study inform verbally member study team aim , risk , alternative therapy , right course trial . The investigator emphasize study participation voluntary patient withdraw time study . Patients include fulfill inclusion criterion none exclusion criterion list within protocol write informed consent obtain . Enrolment period study 18 month Statistical analysis Pearson r correlation coefficient use examine relationship two Quantitative variable . T test use compare Quantitative variable two category Qualitative variable . ANOVA test use compare Quantitative variable three category Qualitative variable . Chi- square test use examine relationship two Qualitative variable . The variable find significantly related dependent variable monothetic analysis ( one-factor-at-a-time method ) insert multivariate analysis ANCOVA . Risks risk management Most population consumes high dos caffeine ( average coffee consumption 9-11 kg per person per year ) without even notice . The side effect list previously describe consume dosage much high 3 X 100 mg/day . The safety caffeine consumption elective colorectal surgery demonstrate numerous clinical study detail . In study , patient suffer medical condition require treatment drug might interfere caffeine exclude . Therefore , consumption caffeine cumulative dose 300 mg/day cause side effect . Despite , patient hospitalize supervision monitor primary team study investigator . Documentation vital sign , physical examination , medical consultant support assessment serious adverse event conduct . Any unexpected adverse event treat efficiently quickly without extra cost patient .</detailed_description>
