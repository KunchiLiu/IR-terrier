	<brief_title>Study TAK-228 In Patients With Previously Treated Metastatic Renal Cell Carcinoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This research study Phase II clinical trial . Phase II clinical trial test safety effectiveness investigational intervention learn whether intervention work treat specific disease . `` Investigational '' mean intervention study . The FDA ( U.S. Food Drug Administration ) approve TAK-228 treatment disease investigate treatment advance solid tumor , blood disorder , inflammatory disease . TAK-228 work inhibit interfere cellular function involve cell growth survival . TAK-228 specifically target type protein make chemical trigger cell growth , include cancer cell growth . This protein may also cause cell produce protein trigger development new blood vessel . Cancers need new blood vessel order grow . In types cancer , type protein ( mTOR ) switch , make cancer cell grow produce new blood vessel . mTOR blocker ( inhibitor ) new type cancer growth blocker stop growth type cancer . Researchers hope learn participant previously treat mRCC respond treatment TAK-228 . Other goal study include assess type side effect associate TAK-228 whether relationship certain genetic mutation ( change DNA ) participant response drug .</detailed_description>
