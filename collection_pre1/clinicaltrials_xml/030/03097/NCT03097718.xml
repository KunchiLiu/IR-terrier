	<detailed_description>Low back pain highly prevalent health condition , report lifetime prevalence 84 % worldwide . Currently , induce disability health condition , depression , diabetes , chronic obstructive pulmonary disease musculoskeletal disorder . Approximately 85 % low back pain complaint non-specific , mean pain attribute recognizable specific pathology infection vertebral fracture . While many patient low back pain recover within month , large number patient report recurrence within one year . Current treatment intervention often remain unsuccessful , highlight current lack knowledge underlie mechanism non-specific low back pain . Postural control deficit identify key factor development recurrence non-specific low back pain . To achieve optimal postural control , central nervous system need process , integrate weigh proprioceptive signal different body region ( e.g . ankle muscle low back muscle ) vestibular visual input . Several study show patient non-specific low back pain decreased ability optimally weigh proprioceptive signal stand , lead reduced postural robustness compare pain-free individual . More specifically , patient low back pain dominantly rely proprioceptive signal ankle muscle able up-weigh proprioceptive signal low back muscle need . This might due impaired central process proprioceptive signal . However , study investigate central proprioceptive processing patient recurrent non-specific low back pain . Therefore , project aim elucidate whether patient recurrent non-specific low back pain show altered brain activation pattern process proprioceptive signal ankle muscle low back muscle compare healthy control , apply local muscle vibration functional magnetic resonance imaging ( fMRI ) .</detailed_description>
