	<brief_summary>RATIONALE : Placing tumor antigen chimeric receptor create laboratory patient autologous donor-derived T cell may make body build immune response kill cancer cell . PURPOSE : This clinical trial study genetically engineer lymphocyte therapy treat patient B-cell leukemia lymphoma relapse ( stem cell transplantation intensive chemotherapy ) refractory chemotherapy .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . Determine safety feasibility chimeric antigen receptor T cell transduce anti-CD19/CD20 vector ( refer tanCART-19/20 cell ) . II . Determine duration vivo survival tanCART-19/20 cell . RT-PCR ( reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction ) analysis whole blood use detect quantify survival tanCART-19/20 TCR ( T-cell receptor ) zeta : CD137 TCR zeta cell time . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . For patient detectable disease , measure anti-tumor response due tanCART-19/20 cell infusion . II . To determine CD137 transgene superior TCR zeta transgene measure relative engraftment level tanCART-19/20 TCR zeta : CD137 TCR zeta cell time . III . Estimate relative traffic tanCART-19/20 cell tumor bone marrow lymph node . IV . For patient store accessible tumor cell ( patient active chronic lymphocytic leukemia ( CLL ) , acute lymphocytic leukemia ( ALL ) , etc ) determine tumor cell kill tanCART-19/20 cell vitro . V. Determine cellular humoral host immunity develop murine anti-CD19/20 , assess correlation loss detectable tanCART-19/20 ( loss engraftment ) . VI . Determine relative subset tanCART-19/20 T cell ( Tcm , Tem , Treg ) . OUTLINE : Patients assign 1 group accord order enrollment . Patients receive anti-CD19/20-CAR ( couple CD137 CD3 zeta signal domain ) vector-transduced autologous T cell day 0,1 , 2 absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . After completion study treatment , patient follow intensively 6 month , every 3 month 2 year , annually thereafter 13 year .</detailed_description>
