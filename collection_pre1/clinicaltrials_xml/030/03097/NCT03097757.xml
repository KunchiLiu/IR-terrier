	<brief_summary>The primary objective study assess utility ultrasound guidance close reduction pediatric forearm fracture pediatric emergency department . The investigator compare post-reduction radiologic outcome experimental group ( ultrasound guide closed forearm fracture reduction ) control group ( standard care blind closed forearm fracture reduction ) determine difference number adequate reduction group . Secondary objective include compare provider satisfaction reduction procedure , number patient require repeat reduction , time reduction , number patient require operative repair reduction , reduction procedure comparison post-reduction ultrasound x-ray interpretation .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Trial Ultrasound Guidance Reduction Pediatric Forearm Fractures</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This prospective randomized , control , single blind study take place Children 's Hospital Montefiore ( CHAM ) Pediatric Emergency Department ( PED ) . Patients present PED , confirm forearm fracture require close reduction PED meet inclusion/exclusion criterion eligible study . The decision perform close reduction procedure PED make consult orthopedic surgeon perform procedure . All eligible patient ' pain reassess manage necessary per standard care The eligible patient parent/guardian approach treat physician consulting orthopedic resident write consent . Written assent obtain minor older 7 year age . After enrollment study , patient randomize either experimental group ( ultrasound guide fracture reduction ) control group ( standard care forearm fracture reduction without real-time imaging ) . Allocation patient intervention control arm accomplish computer-generated permuted block randomization scheme . Consulting orthopedic resident train perform musculoskeletal sonography study consider study-trained physician . All patient undergo procedural sedation and/or pain management close reduction per standard care PED . The medication use sedation and/or pain determine treat PEM physician . Study patient randomize ultrasound guide group undergo point-of-care ultrasound , perform study train physician use Sonosite Edge ultrasound machine L38 linear 10-5 MHz transducer probe . Prior reduction procedure patient randomize experimental group , ultrasound image fracture site obtain maximum degree displacement measure . Both longitudinal transverse view injure area obtain . The trained physician perform real-time ultrasound image need closed reduction procedure . Once orthopedic resident determines he/she obtain optimal alignment prior casting , post-reduction ultrasound image obtain angle displacement measure . All ultrasound perform prior reduction record , image obtain include video clip ultrasound well save still picture best image suspect fracture site . The study-trained physician perform ultrasound record his/her finding data collection form immediately procedure prior review plain radiograph . While experience majority reduction procedure perform PED do without use real time imaging , orthopedic surgery resident employ use c-arm ( fluoroscopy ) and/or portable x-ray machine reduction procedure . At his/her discretion , orthopedic resident may use either modality ultrasound control group per standard care PED . The use modality record . After reduction procedure ultrasound group prior review post reduction x-ray , orthopedic resident complete brief questionnaire . Patients group undergo post-reduction x-ray . Based degree displacement x-ray , orthopedic surgeon determine whether patient need repeat reduction , per routine standard care . If repeat reduction require , treat physician choose use ultrasound his/her disgression . The angle displacement measure post-reduction x-ray orthopedic surgeon . Additionally , angle displacement measure post-reduction ultrasound measure compare angle displacement post-reduction x-ray . An expert sonographer review case ultrasound x-ray result correlate .</detailed_description>
