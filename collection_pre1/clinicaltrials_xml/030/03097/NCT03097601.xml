	<detailed_description>Metastatic renal cell carcinoma ( mRCC ) highly angiogenic tumor mutation pVHL gene lead over-expression VEGF . Therefore , mRCC represent paradigm use anti-angiogenic treatment target VEGF/VEGFR pathway . Despite increase time progression treatment , administer alone , curative ineluctable progression especially reference treatment sunitinib multi kinase inhibitor VEGF , PDGF , CSF1 receptors c-kit , FLT3 . At progression sunitinib treatment , patient receive mTOR inhibitor responsible , least , HIF1A mRNA translation , third line sorafenib inhibits VEGFR2 , 3 PDGFR , c-KIT B-RAF . The access different line treatment finally prolong survival situation satisfactory . New way think new therapeutic target necessary `` chronisize '' pathology even cure . The current therapeutic practises base statement treatment must destroy blood vessel asphyxiate tumor endothelial cell normal cell adapt selection pressure exert treatment . These statement arewrong since tumor cell aberrantly express receptor target anti-angiogenic drug lead cell adaptation tumor recurrence . Another unexpected aspect associate use anti-angiogenesis treatment diversity patients'response . Some patient right away refractory die rapidly , majority patient transient response progress percentages responder long period . By target normal endothelial cell tumor neo-vascularization , response homogenous . 3 conclusion follow observation : 1- The need identify predictive marker efficacy ; 2-The identification druggable target participate progression anti-angiogenic treatment ; 3- These target independent VEGF/VEGFR axis . The result highlight ELR+CXCL cytokine , pro-inflammatory pro-angiogenic cytokine prognosis marker survival mRCC patient relevant therapeutic target experimental tumor mice . As VEGF/VEGFR , cytokine produce tumor , endothelial inflammatory cell . Their receptor ( CXCR1 , 2 ) express physiologically immune endothelial cell aberrantly tumor cell generate time autocrine proliferation loop , chronic angiogenesis inflammation . Therefore , CXCL/CXCR1,2 axis constitutes independent axis cancer development propagation . However , current standard care administer anti-angiogenic therapy first line treatment . Hence , relevance CXCL cytokine predictive marker sunitinib efficacy , mechanism link production CXCL cytokine mRCC response treatment ? . Deciphering molecular mechanism associate production cytokine tumor cell cell microenvironment represent interesting intellectual challenge relevant way improve current treatment target , progression current standard care , pathways VEGF/VEGFR axis . This project aim improvement current clinical practises mRCC . Numerous effort give determination prognosis marker different tumor include mRCC . However , clinical practises , physician interested predictive marker success/failure treatment biological prognosis marker time indicative classical clinical parameter ( TNM example ) . The recent experiment highlight relevant cytokine ( ELR+CXCL ) participate aggressiveness mRCC . Indeed , intra-tumor amount ELR+CXCL cytokine CXCL7 potent prognosis marker survival independent clinical parameter . Therefore indicative poor prognosis patient priori good prognosis accord TNM Fuhrman grade ( consideration nuclear nucleolus size ) . We also demonstrate prognosis value two ELR+CXCL cytokine CXCL1 , CXCL5 CXCL8 . Both independent clinical parameter . However , role predictive marker resistance anti-angiogenic drug , current standard care , still unknown . For medical point view , rapid identification responder no-responders first importance . It avoid undesired toxic event unresponsive patient rapid adaptation treatment consider different line therapy currently available mRCC patient . The determination threshold value relevant cytokine need threshold must determine independent cohort patient well reliability . Such test invasive patient simple possible order introduce clinical practises low price reimburse social security . It compatible propose measure ELR+CXCL level blood sample classical ELISA test . Deciphering mechanisms origin de novo synthesis redundant pro-angiogenic/pro-inflammatory cytokine selection pressure treatment target VEGF/VEGFR pathway intellectually challenge may identify unknown parameter implicate Darwinian adaptation tumor cell among heterogeneous environment . The main objective : - Research help understanding biological mechanism clinical observation ( Bed Bench ) transfer knowledge clinic laboratory ( bed bench ) . - Research help prognosis . - Research help therapeutic decision treatment monitoring .</detailed_description>
