	<brief_summary>This propose trial design answer follow question : First , biliary reflux distal esophagus present OLGB increase procedure ? Second , perform OLGB without anti-reflux suture make difference ( biliary ) reflux exposure distal esophagus ? To answer question investigator plan perform randomize , control trial involve two group . Group A undergo OLGB without anti-reflux suture consist 50 patient . Group B receive OLGB anti-reflux suture also consist 50 patient . Gastroscopic evaluation inflammation reflux perform one year operation utilize multilevel intraluminal impedance pH-monitoring ( MII-pH ) intragastric Bilitec 2000™ . Furthermore , study blind patient . Long-term weight loss , resolution comorbidities incidence surgical complication serve secondary endpoint . Follow-ups perform 3 , 6 , 12 month postoperatively assess primary secondary goal .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Omega Loop Gastric Bypass With And Without Anti-Reflux Sutures</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Obesity , especially comorbidities , unarguably become number one threat human health modern world . Western lifestyle lead increase prevalence thus high mortality ( i.e . due cardiovascular disease ) . The positive effect gastric bypass surgery excess weight loss comorbidity resolution well-known . In contrast standard laparoscopic Roux-en-Y Gastric Bypass ( RYGB ) , new method , laparoscopic Omega Loop Gastric Bypass ( OLGB ) , emerge past year . It believe simple method involve one anastomosis ( instead two ) therefore potentially reduce morbidity mortality whilst maintain comparable excess weight loss . However , since new type gastric bypass similar former Billroth II resection ( BII ) , carcinoma risk concern . The OLGB different BII resection many way . For instance , involve create approximately 10 cm long narrow gastric pouch could prevent suspected underlying pathogenetic mechanism : biliary reflux gastric tube subsequently esophagus . Biliary reflux suspect stimulate squamous esophageal cell Barrett 's epithelial cell produce inflammatory mediator therefore cause oxidative stress , DNA damage apoptosis might lead adenocarcinoma . Worldwide , currently two different way perform OLGB : without anti-reflux suture , involve sew biliopancreatic limb staple line pouch use V-Loc ( non-absorbable ) move upwards far easily possible without create tension . This propose trial design answer follow question : First , biliary reflux distal esophagus present OLGB increase procedure ? Second , perform OLGB without anti-reflux suture make difference ( biliary ) reflux exposure distal esophagus ?</detailed_description>
