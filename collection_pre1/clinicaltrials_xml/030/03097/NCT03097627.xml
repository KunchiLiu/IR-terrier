	<brief_summary>This clinical trial evaluate intravenous administration indocyanine green ( ICG ) method intra-thoracic lesion localization . The primary purpose determine intravenous ICG allow u identify intra-thoracic lesion .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Intravenous Indocyanine Green Localization Intra-thoracic Lesions</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>- This study design determine safety feasibility intra-operative localization thoracic lesion follow intravenous injection indocyanine green ( ICG ) , determine intravenous ICG lead intra-operative detection intra-thoracic lesion metastatic lymph node readily identifiable conventional diagnostic imaging modality , determine intravenous ICG improve surgical resection . - At time surgery , indocyanine dye inject intravenously . The investigator use dose 0.5 mg/kg administer prior VATS . - The `` filtered '' near-infrared light cause indocyanine green dye fluoresce surgeon identify lesion likely contain tumor cells.The surgeon also look lymph node see metastatic disease find location use technique . The lymph node process look metastasis .</detailed_description>
