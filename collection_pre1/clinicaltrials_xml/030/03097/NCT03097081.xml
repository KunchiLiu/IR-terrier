	<brief_summary>Rationale : There evidence current literature regard additional value orthosis surgically treat thoracolumbar spine fracture . Objective : To assess whether orthosis provide additional pain relief compare orthosis posteriorly fixate thoracolumbar spine fracture . Primary outcome difference pain six week post-operatively . Secondary objective pain moment , pain medication use , pain related disability , quality life , long-term kyphosis , possible complication , hospital stay , return work subjective feeling benefit disadvantage orthosis . Study design : Randomized control intervention study , non-inferiority trial . Study population : Dutch speaking patient present VU university medical centre , 18 - 65 year old traumatic thoracolumbar spine fracture Th7 - L4 surgically treat posterior fixation . Intervention : One group receive standard care wear orthosis surgery 12 week , use vertical position . The intervention group wear orthosis surgery . Main study parameters/endpoints : Main study outcome difference pain note NRS-score six week , ≥ 2 ( SD 2,5 ) change correspond clinically significant change pain score . Nature extent burden risk associate participation , benefit group relatedness : The current guideline postoperative care regard dorsal stabilization spine fracture recommend use post-operative orthosis . While patient generally receive orthosis 12 week , individual surgeon 's believe sometimes give reason deviate guideline . This founded literature increasingly question use orthoses conservative treatment spine fracture . With fracture operatively stabilize , orthosis mainly provide support gesture thereby potentially result pain relief confidence patient . On hand patient hard time wean orthosis report discomfort due device prefer use . With subject randomize use orthosis orthosis additional risk . This part hypothesize difference postoperative pain might lower risk complication related orthosis .</brief_summary>
