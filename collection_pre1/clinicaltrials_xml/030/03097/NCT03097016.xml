	<brief_title>A Study Assess Pharmacokinetics CC-122 Subjects With Mild , Moderate , Severe Renal Impairment</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This multi-center , open-label , single-dose study ass PK single oral dose 3 mg CC-122 subject mild , moderate , severe renal impairment compare sex , age ( ± 15 year ) , weight ( ± 20 % ) match control subject normal renal function . Estimated renal function purpose group assignment determine screen . Matched control subject normal renal function , define use Cockcroft-Gault ( C G ) equation , estimate creatinine clearance ( CLcr ) ≥ 90 mL/min . Subjects impaired renal function classify stage renal impairment ( mild , moderate , severe ) use estimate glomerular filtration rate ( eGFR ) , calculate Modification Diet Renal Disease ( MDRD ) equation . Each group enroll least 2 subject sex During course study , subject participate Screening period ( Days - 21 -2 ) , Treatment Period ( include baseline visit ) , follow-up telephone call Days 11 18 . Subjects screen eligibility . Eligible subject return clinical site Day 1 baseline assessment , domicile clinical site Day 1 Day 4 . PK sample collect 72 hour post dose . Safety monitor throughout study . The study conduct compliance International Council Harmonisation ( ICH ) Technical Requirements Registration Pharmaceuticals Human Use/Good Clinical Practice ( GCP ) applicable regulatory requirement .</detailed_description>
