	<brief_title>Self-expanding Nitinol Stents High vs. Low Chronic Outward Force De-novo Femoropopliteal Occlusive Arterial Lesions</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Self-expanding nitinol stent must oversized least minimal amount ensure contact vessel wall prevent migration . Once stent deploy exerts continuous force upon vascular wall , term chronic outward force ( COF ) . Data COF neointimal hyperplasia human currently lack . Some animal study , though , find markedly increase neointimal hyperplasia stent high oversizing thus high COF . The objective BIOFLEX-COF trial investigate difference formation intimal hyperplasia one two year implantation nitinol-stents high vs. low COF de-novo femoropopliteal occlusive lesion patient symptomatic peripheral arterial disease . The BIOFLEX-COF trial prospective , randomize control trial . 80 subject enrol randomly assign either high COF group ( LifeStent Vascular Stent ) low COF group ( Pulsar ) . Diameter implant stent measure every two millimetre along stent axis DICOM image respective completion angiography use image processing software . The scheduled time recruitment 2 year . There two follow-up evaluation 12 24 month . Primary endpoint amount in-stent neointima one year , assess contrast-enhanced CT angiography ( CTA ) . Secondary objective amount in-stent neointima two year , device- procedure-related adverse event target lesion revascularisation ( TLR ) rate . In control examination stent diameter true lumen diameter measure DICOM image every two millimetre along stent axis quantify relative amount in-stent restenosis . The present study challenge compare two different self-expanding nitinol-stents head-to-head . To optimize power study , clinical TLR binary re-stenosis Colour flow Doppler Ultrasound drop primary endpoint . Instead amount neointima inside stent access CTA select outcome parameter . The study differs similar previous trial generous inclusion criterion . This do effort perform trial patient sample closely represent real-world patient specialise endovascular centre .</detailed_description>
