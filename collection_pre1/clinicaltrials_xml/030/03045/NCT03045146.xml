	<brief_title>FRench Acute Cerebral Multimodal Imaging Select Patient MEchanical Thrombectomy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Emergent cerebral artery recanalization thrombectomy within 6 hour symptom onset n standard care acute hemispheric infarction document proximal internal carotid artery and/middle cerebral artery occlusion . The success vessel revascularization mostly related emergent reperfusion ischemic penumbra . Multimodal brain image identify amount salvageable penumbra . The indirect comparison recently publish randomized trial suggest despite common baseline clinical characteristic , ( vessel site occlusion , delay type treatment ) , success thrombectomy high study enrol exclusively patient exhibit significant amount penumbra define target mismatch ( TMM ) CTP MRI comparison enrol patient base non contrast CT scan without specific image criterion . As prevalence TMM systematically evaluate trial , TMM definition differs accord study prospective estimation impact prevalence TMM baseline image assess blindly clinical outcome , currently demonstration mechanical thrombectomy limit subgroup patient base image criterion . With background , aim investigate prospective cohort patient treat thrombectomy accord current recommendation , relationship prevalence TMM pretreatment brain image rate clinical recovery thrombectomy . MR DWI , perfusion CTP map process RAPID software usual push back PACS anonymized saved remote software leave investigator blind time treatment decision . We hope learn whether MR CTP help define image profile select subgroup patient benefit thrombectomy .</detailed_description>
