The study contribute novel insight inform design future intervention target persistence behavior change use center chronic disease group . The study intervention use WTH web-based platform support AYA KT SB navigate daily treatment burden . This achieved via bi-directional text messaging , include send reminder positive feedback WTH messaging picture medication catheter hand time treatment participant .
