	<criteria>Provided write informed consent prior study related procedure . Subjects document diagnosis acromegaly . Subjects active acromegaly confirm mean serum concentration GH 2 hour &gt; 2.5 µg/L screen analysed central laboratory . Subjects pituitary surgery must &gt; 8 week postsurgery . 18 75 year age . Negative pregnancy test ( female subject ) . Female either nonchildbearing potential pregnant screening agrees use highly effective contraception whole duration study . Nonchildbearing potential define postmenopausal least 1 year , woman document infertility ( natural acquire ) . Male subject must agree , partner risk become pregnant , use medically accept , effective method contraception ( i.e . condom ) duration treatment period study . The subject receive longacting Somatostatin Analogues ( SSA ) within 12 week prior screen ( e.g.octreotide long act release ( LAR ) , lanreotide Autogel , pasireotide LAR ) . The subject receive shortacting SSA within 1 week ( e.g . octreotide SC ) prior screen . The subject receive dopamine agonist within 6 week ( e.g. , bromocriptine cabergoline ) prior screen . The subject receive GH antagonist within 12 week prior screen ( e.g. , pegvisomant ) . The subject undergone radiotherapy pituitary gland time prior study entry . It anticipate subject undergo pituitary surgery radiation pituitary gland study , require additional medical therapy acromegaly ( include SSA , pegvisomant , dopamine agonist ) study . If subject history postural hypotension evidence postural hypotension screening ( &gt; = 20 mm Hg decrease Systolic blood pressure ( SBP ) , &gt; = 10 mm Hg decrease diastolic blood pressure , &gt; =30 bpm increase pulse rate , stand 2 minute rest supine position least 10 min ) . Subject poorly control diabetes mellitus ( presence ketoacidosis glycosylated hemoglobin level &gt; 10 % ) . Subject diabetes treat insulin le 6 week prior study entry , unstable insulin dose 6 week prior study entry HbA1c &gt; 10 % . Subject take betablockers ( inhibit compensatory increase HR hypotensive episode ) . Subject treated hypertension opinion investigator antihypertensive medication put increase risk postural hypotension . Subject hypotensive screening define systolic &lt; 90 mmHg and/or diastolic &lt; 60 mmHg . Subject clinically significant hepatic abnormality and/or alanine aminotransferase ( ALT ) and/or aspartate aminotransferase ( AST ) ≥2 x ULN and/or alkaline phosphatase ( AP ) ≥2 x ULN and/or total bilirubin ≥1.5 x ULN gammaglutamyl transferase ( GGT ) ≥2.5 x ULN Screening period ( local laboratory result ) . Subject compression optic chiasm cause visualfield defect . Subject receive oestrogencontaining Hormone Replacement Therapy ( HRT ) . Subject clinically significant pancreatic abnormality and/or amylase and/or lipase ≥2 x ULN Screening period ( local laboratory result ) . Any significant renal abnormality , include confirm proteinuria and/or creatinine ≥1.5x ULN screen assess local laboratory .</criteria>
