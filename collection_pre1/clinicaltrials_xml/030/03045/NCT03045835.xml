	<brief_title>Baska ® Mask Versus Endotracheal Tube Ambulatory Laparoscopic Surgery</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Patient 's satisfaction smooth process crucial ambulatory care surgery . Conduct Anaesthesia include choice airway device play important role . Endotracheal intubation long regard technique choice airway management laparoscopic surgery . However , currently emerge interest laryngeal mask substitute endotracheal tube laparoscopic surgery especially ambulatory care set . The increased abdominal pressure secondary gas insufflation Laparoscopic surgery demand good supraglottic airway device feature good seal , aspiration prevention effective ventilation . Few study evaluate performance Baska® Mask various type surgery obtain high `` first-attempt '' success rate , easy insertion good oropharyngeal leak pressure 30cmH2O low complication sorethroat , dysphonia dysphagia . However , study regard comparison Baska® mask endotracheal tube carry . Therefore , investigator would like evaluate novel device comparison endotracheal tube laparoscopic surgery centre . This prospective randomized control study University Malaya Medical Centre compare Baska® mask conventional laryngoscope-guided endotracheal intubation laparoscopic surgery daycare basis . The investigator would like study efficacy device term : time effective airway insertion , efficacy airway seal , post-operation device complication .</detailed_description>
