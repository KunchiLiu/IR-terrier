	<brief_title>Corneal Confocal Microscopy Patients With Type 1 Diabetes</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Rationale : Poorly control diabetes mellitus associate microvascular complication , include peripheral neuropathy . Peripheral neuropathy associate diabetes painful condition . Its diagnosis hamper painful long nerve conduction study fail diagnose small nerve neuropathy . It important study method noninvasive method early detection , sensitive specific diagnose early neuropathy propose novel study detect cornea eye . Aims : - Estimate corneal small nerve fiber damage young T1DM subject ( corneal fiber density , nerve branch density , fiber length ) compare result healthy control use corneal confocal microscopy ( CCM ) . - Estimate corneal nerve fiber damage subject diabetes , peripheral neuropathy subject diabetes without peripheral neuropathy , diagnose skin biopsy nerve conduction study - Obtain much need normative value CCM adolescent intraepidermal nerve fiber density skin biopsy subject type 1 diabetes . - As secondary outcome measure , compare serum biomarkers include leptin , TNF alpha , fibrinogen patient diabetes neuropathy Vs. without neuropathy . Hypothesis : 1 . Subjects T1DM reduce corneal nerve fiber density , corneal nerve branch density , fiber length Corneal Confocal Microscopy compare control finding pronounce neuropathy . 2 . There correlation abnormal corneal parameter biomarkers . Adolescents neuropathy diagnose via nerve conduction study lowest nerve fiber density distal leg correlate nerve conduction study . Study Design : Cross sectional study design , interventional Inclusion : Subjects diabetes : 18-30 year ( cohort 1 ) , adolescent age 13-17 year ( cohort 2 ) . Type 1 Diabetes diagnose via standard ADA criterion Matched Controls : Match age gender Hemoglobin A1c &lt; 6.5 % Exclusion : For subject : Contact lens wearer Diseases could damage cornea , diabetes . Neurologic disease Psychiatric disease Amputation Foot ulcer Pain neuropathic origin . Presence Lupus , Sjogren 's syndrome Celiac disease Hyperlipidemia require lipid-lowering medication Peripheral vascular disease Neuropathy due anything besides diabetes Presence medical condition may affect nerve conduction ( e.g. , radiculopathy ) . For healthy control Family history Type 1 Diabetes The study monitor Institutional Review Board Albert Einstein College Medicine Screening : The investigator recruit 15 subject 18-30 , proceed 35 13-17 year old subject T1DM , addition recruit match control . Subjects find via flyer place around hospital via recruitment clinic ophthalmology , neurology , pediatric adult diabetes clinic Children 's Hospital Montefiore Bronx , NY . In addition , investigator advertise subject local JDRF chapter . Healthy control recruited Craigslist also Montefiore pediatric clinic . At time screening , subject consent Dr. Lisa Underland . The consent obtain clinical research center exam room door close , study explain subject give opportunity ask question . Information obtain via discussion patient also review medical record ( follow Montefiore ) regard current diabetes control ( HgBA1c ) , lipid status , duration disease , comorbidities , incidence retinopathy ( available ) , previous history diabetes control . Study Visit : The investigator initially recruit adult subject first , assess safety prior inclusion pediatric subject . Subjects present Ophthalmology clinic Montefiore eye exam . They undergo examination via Corneal Confocal microscopy Dr. Lisa Underland , train Dr. Kang . The procedure take less 15 minute , include use numbing drop prior procedure . The CCM device disposable cap use change patient . Images review assessed ophthalmologist , person review image subject . This procedure standard care time indication . In addition , subject receive evaluation neurologist ass neuropathy via physical examination question use Utah Early Neuropathy Scale Michigan Neuropathy screen instrument [ 21 ] . Nerve conduction study obtain , skin biopsy portion perform subject T1DM . The 3mm skin punch biopsy take distal leg IENFD determine accord EFNS guideline [ 9 ] . These procedure standard evaluation patient suspect neuropathy , standard evaluation patient Type 1 Diabetes . Blood obtain biomarkers Leptin , TNF alpha , Fibrinogen . Data Specimen Collection Storage Data collect diabetes control management via chart review time screen . Paper chart store locked drawer division pediatric endocrinology diabetes , electronic file hold password protect computer . Subjects identify unique study ID rather name data , also biological specimen . Biological specimen store freezer -70 degree . Data Safety Monitoring An independent data safety monitoring committee ( DSMB ) oversee project conduct interim monitoring accumulate data research activity assure continue safety participant , relevance study question , appropriateness study , accumulate data . The DSMB meeting review pediatric endocrinology research protocols require several year . The monitoring entity consist doctor expertise relevant field study , statistic research design include Dr. Steven Choi , pediatric cardiologist Montefiore , Dr. Rita Louard , adult endocrinologist Montefiore , Dr. Chhavi Agarwal , private practice pediatric endocrinologist . The committee meet prior initiation protocol review plan assure data accuracy protocol compliance evaluate protocol expertise personnel perform research procedure . Adverse event protocol deviation report annually DSMB meet serious adverse event serious protocol deviation report within 48 hour occurrence . DSMB minute sign continuation form submit IRB yearly progress report need serious adverse event deviation . The committee meet annually assess protocol compliance well prior initiation protocol review safety information case serious adverse event . Research would suspend case serious adverse event due study activity severely harm subject determine DSMB . Adverse event grade use severity scale consistent common terminology criterion adverse event . Safety information collect start finish study visit procedure study personnel need evaluation physician perform deemed appropriate . Information collect include severity adverse event , study intervention relationship , action take , outcome , expect serious . This document source document adverse event log .</detailed_description>
