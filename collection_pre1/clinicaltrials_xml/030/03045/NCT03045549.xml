	<brief_summary>The study design evaluate effectiveness novel kinematic biofeedback system - SWORD Phoenix- rehabilitation total hip replacement . SWORD Phoenix allow patient perform independent rehabilitation session home , remote monitoring clinical team . The investigator hypothesise clinical outcome home-based rehabilitation program least similar outcome traditional home-based rehabilitation face-to-face session . This randomise controlled trial active comparator . Patients enrol allocated pre-operatively 2 group : intervention group control group . Both group perform 8 week rehabilitation start day 7 surgery . The intervention group perform daily rehabilitation session home use SWORD Phoenix , remote monitor physical therapist . The control group perform 1h rehabilitation session 3 time week , home , give physical therapist . Outcomes measured week 4 8 . The primary outcome performance Timed-up-and-Go ( TUG ) test patient comparison pre-operative score . Secondary outcome measure term : ) range motion hip joint ( flexion/extension/abduction/adduction/internal external rotation ) ; b ) Hip Osteoarthritis Outcome Score ; c ) quality life , measure SF-36 scale .</brief_summary>
