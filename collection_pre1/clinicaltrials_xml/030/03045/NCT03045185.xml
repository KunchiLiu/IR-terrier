	<brief_summary>Aim : The aim prospective study evaluate treatment outcome regenerative endodontic technique ( RET ) management traumatise non-vital immature teeth child . Methodology : This study aim recruit 25-30 healthy child traumatise non-vital immature upper incisor treat bi-antibiotic regenerative endodontic technique . Patients review clinically 3m,6m,9m,12m,2y , 3 year radiographically 3m,9m , 2y , 3 year . One operator undertake treatment , clinical review standardise radiographic exposure . Radiographic analysis carry two calibrate experienced clinician . Standardised photograph take 3m,12m,2y , 3 year crown colour change assess use standardise validated methodology .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Aims pilot study : Primary : - Study clinical radiographic success Regenerative Endodontic Technique regeneration/revascularisation immature permanent teeth necrotic root canal system follow traumatic injury . - Study qualitative quantitative increase root dimension , follow RET , evaluate continued root development thicken dentinal wall . Secondary : Evaluate effect treatment colour change treat tooth compare healthy contralateral tooth . Hypothesis : Through repopulation root canal space vital tissue , Regenerative Endodontic Technique would promote continued root development and/or thicken dentinal wall , thereby improve long-term prognosis non vital immature traumatise teeth . Methodology : Design pilot study : This prospective interventional study . Participants : This study aim recruit 25-30 patient . This estimation base discussion statistician estimation number child refer LDI non-vital immature anterior teeth follow trauma , might eligible participation study . Ethical approval seek Integrated Research Application System ( IRAS ) . Patients refer Paediatric Dentistry Department Leeds Dental Institute ( LDI ) assess clinician suitability inclusion study base follow inclusion exclusion criterion . Intervention : At RET clinic inform consent obtain , treatment carry two visit last 45 minute . During visit , patient receive following treatment : First Treatment Visit : - Preoperative photograph take principal investigator use Fujifilm ( Tokyo , Japan ) , Finepix S3 Pro camera 105-mm Micro Nikon ( Tokyo , Japan ) f2.8 lens sigma ring flash , EM-140DG . - The tooth isolate use dry dam ( Directa , Upplands Visby , Sweden ) . - The tooth access pulp extirpate . The root canal system irrigate copious chemical disinfectant ( 0.5 % sodium hypochlorite ) 15 minute . - The canal negotiate minimal filing prevent weaken exist dentinal wall . - The canal dried use paper point . - In ante-room , two antibiotic , Ciprofloxacin Metronidazole , mixed sterile water . - The mixture two antibiotic carry root canal special applicator entire root canal fill antibiotic . - The root canal hermetically seal glass ionomer cement prevent coronal leakage contamination root canal oral microorganism . The patient discharge appointment make two week later . Second Treatment Visit : - Local analgesia administer tooth isolated re-accessed described . - The antibiotic mixture flush root canal irrigation normal saline . Following root canal thoroughly dry paper point . - This followed insertion sterile 23-gauge needle length 2 mm beyond work length past confines root canal periapical tissue intentionally induce bleed root canal . The bleeding allow fill root canal . - Once root canal fill blood , cotton pledget place pulp chamber clot allow form root canal . - Once clot form pulp chamber coronal part thoroughly clean remove remnant blood , could cause discolouration future . - The access cavity hermetically seal three layer material prevent coronal leakage contamination ; Portland cement , follow glass ionomer composite resin . - Patients review 3 , 6 9 month . Review visit outcomes The patient review 3 , 6 , 9 , 12 month , 2 year 3 year . The following outcome assess : Clinical : The follow assess : - Presence normal physiologic tooth mobility . - Tenderness percussion . - Free pain discomfort . - No evidence labial swell signify continue presence infection . Radiographic : Standardised periapical radiograph take start treatment , treatment 3 month , 9 month , 2 year 3 year . Trained independent examiner : Two train independent examiner evaluate radiograph . All radiographs randomly show examiner independently ask score test parameter . Image analysis : Continuous root development , change dentinal root thickness apical foramen width quantify . Pulp Sensibility Tests : At recall pulp sensibility response evaluate use thermal test ( Ethyl Chloride ) Electric Pulp test ( EPT ) . Photographs : Standardised intra-oral photograph take start treatment , 9-month , 2 year , 3 year follow-up visit . Favourable post treatment crown colour comparison pre operative photograph contralateral tooth assess use MathWorks software describe study Day et al . 2011 .</detailed_description>
