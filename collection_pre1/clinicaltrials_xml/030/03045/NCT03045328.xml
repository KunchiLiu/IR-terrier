	<brief_title>Venetoclax Ibrutinib Patients With Relapsed/Refractory CLL SLL</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To evaluate safety pharmacokinetics orally administer venetoclax combine ibrutinib patient chronic lymphocytic leukemia/small lymphocytic lymphoma ( CLL/SLL ) previously treat least one agent naive ibrutinib venetoclax . ( Escalation Phase ) II . To confirm safety determine feasibility preliminary efficacy venetoclax combine ibrutinib relapsed/refractory CLL/SLL patient . ( Expansion Phase ) SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . To determine duration response relapse refractory CLL/SLL patient previously treat either venetoclax ibrutinib . II . To determine time-to-progression relapsed refractory CLL/SLL patient previously treat either venetoclax ibrutinib . III . To determine progression-free survival relapse refractory CLL/SLL patient previously treat either venetoclax ibrutinib . IV . To determine overall survival relapse refractory CLL/SLL patient previously treat either venetoclax ibrutinib . V. To determine minimal residual disease status bone marrow aspirate flow cytometry relapse refractory CLL/SLL patient previously treat either venetoclax ibrutinib . TERTIARY OBJECTIVES : I . To determine time next treatment . II . To perform tumor profile baseline relapse peripheral blood mononuclear cell ( PBMC ) bone marrow sample use whole exome whole genome sequence ribonucleic acid-sequencing ( RNA-seq ) identify potential mechanism resistance . III . To evaluate pharmacokinetics ibrutinib venetoclax administer combination . OUTLINE : This phase I , dose-escalation study venetoclax follow phase II study . Patients receive ibrutinib orally ( PO ) daily ( QD ) begin week 1 day 1 . Treatment ibrutinib continue absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . Patients also receive venetoclax PO QD begin week 9 day 1 . Treatment venetoclax continue week 61 day 7 absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . After completion study treatment , patient follow every 3 month 3 year .</detailed_description>
