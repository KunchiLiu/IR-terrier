	<brief_title>Mirvetuximab Soravtansine ( IMG853 ) Folate Receptor Alpha-expressing TNBC</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The folate receptor alpha protein important tumor growth over-expressed tumor cell . The word `` over-expressed '' situation mean many copy protein surface cell compare healthy , normal cell , help tumor continue grow size . Mirvetuximab soravtansine act target folate receptor tumor cell . In animal model , mirvetuximab soravtansine highly effective decrease tumor size . This suggest mirvetuximab soravtansine may help shrink stop growth folate receptor alpha positive breast cancer study . In study investigator look folate receptor alpha expression change follow 2 dos neoadjuvant mirvetuximab soravtansine . The investigator also look evaluate safety regimen , measure change tumor size , associate folate receptor alpha expression change tumor size , describe change Ki-67 percent apoptotic cell population .</detailed_description>
