	<brief_summary>Lichen sclerosus ( LS ) skin condition external genitals ( vulva ) woman . LS cause vulvar itching , pain , burn . In addition , LS cause scar vulva may cause significant sexual dysfunction pain . Lastly , 4-6 % woman LS develop vulvar cancer . The current `` gold standard '' treatment lichen sclerosus potent steroid cream . When use correctly , steroid cream help decrease symptom itch burn prevent vulvar scar . In addition , proper treatment revers underlie inflammation LS , may lower risk get cancer . While useful , steroid cream may serious side effect include thin skin , fungal infection , lower immune system . Platelet-rich plasma ( PRP ) platelet concentrate help speed tissue healing , without serious side effect , wide range medical condition diabetic foot ulcer , muscle injury , tendon injury , variety cosmetic procedure . The PRP work high level protein help wind healing . It also apparent majority publish study PRP therapy minimal risk scar tissue formation significant bad side effect . Recently , exploratory study twelve subject use PRP study treatment lichen sclerosus . While study show good success , study limit small size lack placebo ( drug study treatment contains active ingredient ) control .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Platelet Rich Plasma ( PRP ) Vulvar Lichen Sclerosus</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This randomize single-blind placebo control trial evaluate efficacy safety autologous Platelet-rich Plasma ( PRP ) treatment vulvar lichen sclerosus . Thirty patient diagnosis biopsy proven active vulvar lichen sclerosus recruit one center . This study consist two-week screening period 12-week treatment period . At begin screen period , 4 millimeter punch skin biopsy sample collect patient confirm diagnosis active lichen sclerosus rule diagnosis lichen planus , psoriasis , candidiasis , vulvar intraepithelial neoplasia . In addition , vulvoscopy perform screening visit 12-week treatment period rule vulvar carcinoma . All eligible patient randomize receive either placebo ( saline injection ) ( 10 subject ) two separate treatment PRP separate 6 week ( 20 subject ) . Each treatment would consist injection 5 ml autologous platelet-rich plasma ( PRP ) inject subdermally intra-dermally , infiltrate area vulva affect active lichen sclerosus . A repeat biopsy perform adjacent original biopsy site 12 week visit . The preparation autologous PRP follow : 60 cc whole blood remove via venopuncture . Preparation PRP do use proprietary , FDA approve , centrifuge us laser close sterile system identify isolate platelet rich fraction 60ml whole blood . [ MagellanÂ® Autologous Platelet Separator System . Arteriocyte Medical Systems . Hopkinton , MA USA ] . The PRP collect blackened syringe neither Dr. Goldstein ( physician administer PRP ) patient know receive PRP placebo . After isolation PRP , calcium chloride ( 0.7ml ) add 5 ml PRP isolate activate thrombin cascade , thereby cause degranulation platelet , release growth factor cytokine , start transformation PRP platelet rich fibrin matrix ( PRFM ) . The primary efficacy variable perform blinded dermatopathologist evaluate inflammatory infiltration biopsy specimen obtain screen period Week 14 visit ( 1 4 scale ) . A secondary endpoint change baseline `` Clinical Scoring System Vulvar Lichen Sclerosus '' ( CSS ) validate instrument assessment investigator 's impression severity disease patient 's impression severity disease . All adverse event record , include serious adverse event . A physical examination perform visit .</detailed_description>
