	<brief_summary>Previous study animal model show clearly lipid homeostasis influence oocyte meiosis resumption . However Liver X Receptors pathway never investigate human ovocyte</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>LXR Oocyte Meiosis Resumption</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>In mice deficient Liver X Receptor ( LXR ) gene , oocyte unable resume meiosis . Oxysterols molecules derive cholesterol synthesis pathway . They ligands liver X receptor ( LXRs ) . In human , LXR signal pathway never investigate process . The Investigator propose analyse granulosa cell surround ovocyte expression LXR , target gene enzymes involved oxysterols synthesis . These granulosa cell normally retrieve destroyed 18 hour sperm insemination oocyte In Vitro Fertilization program . The oocyte meiosis resumption consider positive ( Granulosa cell positive , GC+ ) zygote observe 18 hour sperm insemination negative ( Granulosa cell negative , GC- ) none zygote appear . Moreover investigator analyse quality embryo development 5 day zygote form ( normal process In Vitro Fertilization ) . The population granulosa cell ( GC+ GC- ) compare . The measurement Liver X Receptor gene enzymes involved oxysterols pathway xill perform Reverse Transcription-Polymerase Chain Reaction . The accumulation lipid granulosa cell measure oil red staining . By sudy investigator probably find new biological marker resumption meiosis woman enrol In Vitro Fertilization programm . Moreover , data help good understand physiopathology oocyte meiosis failure .</detailed_description>
