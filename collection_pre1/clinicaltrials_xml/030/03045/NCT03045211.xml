	<brief_summary>When postural imbalance gait difficulty emerge subject Parkinson disease , patient typically refer number physical therapy session . However , critical gap clinical practice patient complete therapy session . To fill gap , study team develop stand table tabletop system encourage weight shift upright standing ( `` dynamic standing table '' ) , therefore may unique mean increase daily physical activity integrate system routine desktop activity daily live . The purpose study determine whether post-physical therapy in-home physical activity program use dynamic stand table ( adjunct post-physical therapy standard care—weekly physical activity group session ) effective sustain mobility benefit physical therapy individual Parkinson disease .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Post-Physical Therapy Extension In-Home Dynamic Standing Table Use Parkinson Disease</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Axial motor dysfunction Parkinson disease ( PD ) least responsive dopaminergic therapy incline many patient towards sedentary lifestyle . This place PD patient increase risk negative consequence physical inactivity . When PD patient develop postural imbalance gait difficulty , include fall , generally refer physical therapy optimal management . Although patient benefit physical therapy , critical gap clinical practice next physical therapy session . Clinical experience show patient return sedentary lifestyle indicate urgent need post-physical therapy in-home physical activity program PD postural imbalance gait difficulty preserve mobility function . Recent advance physical activity research tout non-exercise physical activity approach promote healthy lifestyle modification . Non-exercise physical activity activity daily live , like cleaning , shopping , standing , intentional exercise . For PD patient postural imbalance gait difficulty , normal upright stand weight-shifting ( step ) long period time may ideal form non-exercise physical activity . It activate low extremity muscle encourage postural activity . To promote type non-exercise physical activity , study team develop sit-stand desk system enhances upright stand activity weight-shifting movement . The `` dynamic standing table '' tabletop oscillate horizontal plane , cue user make periodic side-to-side body weight shift adjustment . Dynamic stand would represent minimal level physical activity compare sitting , pervasive PD subject postural imbalance gait difficulty . Use dynamic stand table easily incorporate routine desktop activity , computer use , reading , watch TV may promote physical activity . Preliminary data show patient moderate PD complete session least 3 hour without significant difficulty may motor cognitive benefit use table . The purpose study determine whether post-physical therapy in-home physical activity program use dynamic stand table ( adjunct post-physical therapy standard care—weekly physical activity group session ) effective sustain mobility benefit physical therapy compare post-physical activity standard care alone individual Parkinson disease postural imbalance gait difficulty . The study team test exploratory hypothesis post-physical therapy gain mobility function PD patient postural imbalance gait difficulty preserve well in-home dynamic standing table use compare control group . The incremental addition dynamic table use expect effectively reduce post-physical therapy sedentary behavior compare standard care alone .</detailed_description>
