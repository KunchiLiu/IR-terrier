	<brief_summary>Introduction . Despite advantage associate use remifentanil total intravenous anesthesia ( TIVA ) , observed frequent difficulty control postoperative pain due risk develop hyperalgesia acute tolerance associate administration opioid . There evidence NMDA receptor involve development change . Methadone opioid exhibit analgesic potency similar morphine NMDA antagonist activity long duration action additional feature . The objective study evaluate quality recovery ( QoR40 ) patient undergo TIVA laparoscopic cholecystectomy receive morphine methadone control postoperative pain . Methods . Patients age 18 65 year , physical status ASA I II , submit total venous anesthesia ( propofol remifentanil ) laparoscopic cholecystectomy eligible participate prospective randomize clinical study evaluate . After induction anesthesia , patient receive solution contain 0.1 mg.kg-1 morphine ( MF group ) 0.1 mg.kg-1 methadone ( MT group ) . Data presence pain , nausea , vomit , tremor , drowsiness , presence SpO2 &lt; 92 % , even O2 face mask ( 5 L.min-1 ) length stay record PACU . The pain evaluate every 15 minute verbal numerical scale ( ENV ) 0 10 . E.v . morphine 0.1 mg.kg-1 ( MF group ) methadone 0.1 mg.kg-1 ( MT group ) administer every 15 minute obtain score 3 . After discharge PACU , patient receive intravenous ketoprofen every 12 hour dipyrone every 6 hour . For case patient considers analgesic regimen insufficient , tramadol ( 100 mg ) administer intravenously 8-hour interval . The consumption analgesic , intensity pain , occurrence nausea , vomit complication ward record . The application questionnaire ( QoR40 ) perform ward morning surgery medical student .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>QUALITY OF RECOVERY AFTER INTRAOPERATIVE MORPHINE OR METHADONE</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>We hypothesize methadone treatment would beneficially affect patient-perceived quality recovery laparoscopic cholecystectomy total intravenous anesthesia . The primary outcome assess use Quality Recovery Questionnaire ( QoR-40 ) , 40-item quality recovery score system , postoperative day ( POD ) 1 . In addition , effect opioids early clinical recovery variable , time eye opening , occurrence nausea vomiting , pain score , use analgesic , length PACU stay , determine . Methods . This randomised trial approve Research Ethics Committee School Medical Health Sciences , Pontifical Catholic University São Paulo . Study sequence No premedication apply patient . Patients´ preoperative data include age , gender , physical status , BMI collect . Subjects randomize use computer-generated ( www.random.org ) table random number 2 group : MT ( methadone 0.1 mg.kg-1 ) MF ( morphine 0.1 mg.kg-1 ) . Group assignments seal sequentially numbered opaque envelope open patient inclusion study . All care provider , researcher , patient blind group assignment . Two study 10-mL syrinx prepare anesthesiologist independent study . Syringe 1 use intraoperative phase syringe 2 rescue postoperative pain . Methadone 0.1 mg.kg-1 ( make 10 mL normal saline ) morphine 0.1 mg.kg-1 ( make 10 mL normal saline ) drawn syringe offer anesthesia provider opaque envelope open . Anesthetic Surgical Management After arrival operating room , standard ASA monitor apply . Lidocaine ( 30 mg ) administer intravenously immediately venoclysis . After anesthesia induction , capnographic monitoring add . Anesthesia induce remifentanil 0.5 µg.kg-1.min-1 three minute follow propofol 2.0 mg. kg-1 . Rocuronium 0.6 mg.kg-1 administer facilitate tracheal intubation . Anesthetic maintenance achieve continuous infusion remifentanil 0.3 µg.kg-1.min-1 propofol 4 6 mg. kg-1 . h-1 . Ventilation control mechanically maintain end-tidal carbon dioxide concentration 30-40 mmHg use 50 % oxygen-air gas mixture . Immediately induction anesthesia , patient receive intravenously : MT group - Methadone 0.1 mg/kg MF group - morphine 0.1 mg/kg . Patients exhibit reduction systolic arterial pressure ( SAP ) great 30 % heart rate ( HR ) reduction less 50 bpm give ephedrine ( 10 mg ) atropine ( 0.5 mg ) , respectively . Normal saline use fluid replacement therapy rate 500 ml throughout first 30 minute , , , 2 ml/kg/h end surgical procedure . All participant receive dexamethasone ( 8 mg ) ketoprofen ( 100 mg ) onset surgery ondansetron ( 4 mg ) dipyrone ( 1 g ) . Residual neuromuscular blockade antagonize atropine ( 0.01 mg/ kg ) neostigmine ( 0.015 mg/kg ) . Extubation perform awaken . The time elapsed discontinuation anesthetic eye opening register . When stable vital sign respiration confirm , patient transfer post-anesthesia care unit ( PACU ) . Early recovery time include time eye opening ( time discontinuation anaesthetic eye open ) time Aldrete score ≥ 9 . Data relate occurrence pain , nausea vomit PACU record . Pain assess rest ask subject cough , every 15 minute use 0-10 numeric pain rating scale ( NRS ) , zero meant pain 10 bad imaginable pain . When stable vital sign respiration confirm , patient transfer post-anesthesia care unit ( PACU ) . Early recovery time include time eye opening ( time discontinuation anaesthetic eye open ) time Aldrete score ≥ 9 . Data relate occurrence pain , nausea vomit PACU record . Pain assess rest ask subject cough , every 15 minute use 0-10 numeric pain rating scale ( NRS ) , zero meant pain 10 bad imaginable pain . One two mL solution previously prepare ( Syringe 2 ) administer intravenously every 15 minute maintain pain score 3 ( 1 mg pain score &lt; 7 2 mg ≥7 ) . Following discharge PACU ( minimum stay 60 minute Aldrete score ≥ 9 ) , participant receive ketoprofen ( 100 mg ) every 12 hour dipyrone ( 30 mg.kg-1 , maximum 1 g ) every six hour intravenously . Whenever patient judge analgesia insufficient , tramadol ( 100 mg ) administer intravenously eight-hour minimum interval . Postoperative nausea vomiting ( PONV ) treat ondansetron ( 4 mg ) intravenously . An investigator blind group assignment collect postoperative outcome data 24 hour surgical procedure . Subjects rate high score pain ( NRS ) hospital ward stay . Tramadol consumption number nausea vomit episode also record . These finding confirm ward nursing staff . All subject stay hospital least 24 hour . Data Collection The baseline QoR-40 questionnaire provide subject informed consent obtain preoperative hold area 24 hour surgery blind investigator . The QoR-40 questionnaire assess five dimension recovery ( physical comfort - 12 item ; emotional state - 7 item ; physical independence - 5 item ; physiological support - 7 item ; pain - 7 item ) . Each item rat five-point Likert scale : none time , time , usually , time , time . The total score QoR-40 range 40 ( poor quality recovery ) 200 ( best quality recovery ) . The primary outcome interest QoR-40 score , however follow data also record : age , gender , physical status , BMI , length PACU stay . Statistical Analysis The sample size calculate consider 90 % power detect 10-point difference QoR-40 , indicate need include 31 participant group . Taking possible loss consideration , final sample include 70 patient .</detailed_description>
