	<brief_summary>Myelodysplastic syndrome ( MDS ) widely recognize clonal hematopoietic stem cell disorder . Decitabine approve treatment subtypes myelodysplastic syndrome ( MDS ) . However , use decitabine often limit severe toxicity represent myelosuppression even relatively low dos . In lower-risk patient ( include IPSS low int-1 risk group ) , treatment mainly aim improve cytopenia , especially anemia . However , although several drug may improve anemia , sometimes durably , low risk MDS eventually require red blood cell ( RBC ) transfusion disease course . Long term RBC transfusion lead iron overload mainly due increase reticulo-endothelial iron recycling.Cardiac , liver endocrine ( diabetes mellitus ) dysfunction due iron overload often leading fatal outcome report heavily transfuse low risk MDS patient . To date , optimal regimen decitabine treatment well establish . In study , perform prospective analysis explore decitabine schedule treatment low risk myelodysplastic syndrome patient transfusion dependent .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Efficacy Safety Ultra Small Dose Decitabine Lower Risk MDS Patients With Transfusion Dependent</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The investigator undertake single-center , single-arm study 50 low risk myelodysplastic syndrome patient transfusion dependent Shandong University Qilu Hospital . All participant select receive ultra small dose decitabine treatment ( give intravenously dose 3.5mg/m2 , qd x 5d , every four week one cycle ) . A routine blood examination perform twice every week . Bone marrow ( BM ) examine routine aspirate smear G-banding analysis every 1-2 treatment course evaluate responses.Adverse event also record throughout study .</detailed_description>
