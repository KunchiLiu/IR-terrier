	<brief_title>The Association Hormones Peptides With Nutritional Consequences Children With Feeding Difficulty .</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The investigation plan prospectively evaluate plasma concentration endocrine parameter child feed difficulty . The studied child arrange dietary record , clinical survey laboratory study inpatient outpatient department clinical evaluation follow-up . The duration evaluation follow-up 3 month . The healthy child control group also assign dietary record , clinical survey laboratory study exclusion feed difficulty malnutrition feed nutritional assessment ( survey study patient demonstrate follow section `` clinical survey '' ) . The healthy child need follow-up assessment 12 week . The diagnosis feed difficulty base `` IMFeD '' program . The categorization feed difficulty IMFeD tool originally develop Dr. Chatoor Dr. Kerzner ( Clinical investigation feed difficulty young child : practical approach , Clinical Pediatrics , 2009 ) . The 7-day dietary record assessment daily calorie evaluate dietician research assistant . Nutritional assessment include 7-day dietary record , assessment daily calorie , body weight ( BW ) , body height ( BH ) , weight age z-score , height age z-score , BMI , BMI age z-score , weight height index , weight-for-height z-score , severity malnutrition , nutritional serum marker ( hemoglobin , lymphocyte count , pre-albumin , albumin , ferritin , zinc ) . Growth standard height , weight , BMI base World Health Organization ( WHO ) population use obtain z-scores measurement , accord age gender . The severity malnutrition determine weight-for-height . The laboratory study perform baseline 12 week . Venous blood collect Serum separation tube keep 4 °C 1 centrifuge , serum store -80 °C . All measurement perform assay without extraction . Concentrations serum ghrelin , leptin , adiponectin , NPY , orexin A , IGF-1 , IGFBP-1 , IGFBP-3 CRH determine use enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay ( ELISA ) kit . All assay perform accord manufacturer ' instruction .</detailed_description>
