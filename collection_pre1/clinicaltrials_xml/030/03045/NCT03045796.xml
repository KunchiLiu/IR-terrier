	<brief_summary>Previous research show many patient kidney failure undergo chronic hemodialysis ( HD ) low venous oxygen concentration , may decrease dialysis treatment . This may due variety factor include anemia , compromise pulmonary function , chronic fluid volume overload . Previous study show low venous oxygen concentration may increase risk cardiovascular event , cognitive deficit , mortality HD patient . The purpose study identify patient hypoxemia HD treatment characterize extent implication hypoxemia . Specifically , investigator aim examine relationship central venous oxygen concentration hemodynamic change dialysis treatment . The investigator evaluate relationship cardiac output measure Task Force Monitor central venous oxygen saturation measure Crit-Line Monitor Wrist0x2 HD patient . Data study provide insight potential mechanism responsible side effect associate dialysis treatment , drop blood pressure cognitive dysfunction .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Following initial recruitment , individual willing participate sign inform consent document provide medical history form complete . In addition , investigator ask participant sign HIPAA authorization form order look medical record monthly blood work ( blood chemistry ) , anthropometric data ( height weight ) , interdialytic weight gain ( weight gain since last treatment ) history , current medication . Testing DURING study protocol day : Testing perform three consecutive dialysis day one-week period ( Monday/ Wednesday/Friday Tuesday/Thursday/Saturday ) . If data collection period miss reason , alternative data collection day schedule . All three study visit identical respect study procedure perform : 1 . Hemodynamics : The hemodynamic response dialysis obtain use Task Force Monitor ( TFM ) . The TFM connect subject prior start HD session . The TFM non-invasive device use thoracic bioimpedance collect variety data related cardiovascular function , include : Heart Rate Variability : Beat-to-beat heart rate ( HR ) record use Task Force Monitor . The ECG collect online sample rate 1,000 Hz , real time , store computer ( Dell , Austin , TX ) . Heart rate variability interval successive heart rate derive ECG signal . Beat-to-Beat Blood Pressure : Beat-to-beat peripheral BP derive via finger plethysmography ( Task Force Monitor ) . A finger cuff place around non-dialyzing index middle finger . These cuff measure change blood pressure successive beat continuously . Cardiac Output : Cardiac output stroke volume collect task force monitor . An electrode place around chest measure change impedance continuously . Blood Pressure : Blood pressure measure start every 10 minute throughout session use automate cuff connect TFM . The cuff place non-dialyzing arm patient . The continuous non-invasive arterial pressure ( CNAP ) technology TFM machine also perform continuously 10 minute segment every hour end HD treatment ( i.e . minute 0 10 , 60 70 , 120 130 , 180 190 ) . The TFM measure hemodynamic value continuously throughout entire HD session . 2 . Relative Blood Volume Hematocrit : The Critline regular part dialysis treatment Champaign Urbana clinic . The Critline non-invasively measure hematocrit , relative blood volume , oxygen saturation real time . A trained staff member Champaign Urbana Dialysis Clinic add disposable blood chamber dialysis machine . As blood travel chamber hematocrit oxygen saturation measure absorbance scatter light . The hematocrit value use estimate blood volume relative start dialysis session . 3 . The Wrist0x2 connect prior HD session measurement record continuously throughout entire HD session . 4 . Clinic Factors : The investigator gather information collect clinic include : participant weight gain since previous treatment , volume fluid remove treatment , composition dialysate use treatment , rate flow blood dialysate hemodialysis machine treatment . 5 . Lab Values : The investigator also obtain result monthly blood chemistry run patient 's blood sample clinic month prior participant enrollment . These value include limited information serum albumin , phosphorus , calcium . After completion HD treatment , patient disconnect TFM Wrist0x2 .</detailed_description>
