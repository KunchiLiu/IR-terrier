	<detailed_description>Hemiplegic shoulder pain common complication . Several factor associate hemiplegic shoulder pain include rotator cuff injury , bicipital tendonitis , impingement , spasticity , limited external rotation shoulder joint , adhesive capsulitis , shoulder subluxation , shoulder hand syndrome , brachial/axillary neuropathy . Flaccidity positive association soft tissue injury tendon injury shoulder . In preliminary study , base sonography result , find possibility get tendon injury inflammation affect shoulder joint high group patient bad motor function rehabilitation hospital . In study , one hundred acute stroke patient hemipelgia enrol . And participant would separate 2 group : control group ( Brunnstrom stage IV-VI ) experimental group ( Brunnstrom stage I-III ) . Clinical characteristic physical finding record admission date . During process , investigator use high frequency ( 5-12 MHz ) musculoskeletal ultrasound evaluate tendon around bilateral shoulder joint admission date 2 week later . In first year stroke , half patient 2 group perform position train passive range motion affect shoulder either hospitalization discharge . Then , investigator execute physical examination use high frequency ultrasound evaluate tendon around bilateral shoulder joint participant twice 6 month 12 month . Then , investigator discuss incidence shoulder tendon injury receive rehabilitation program accord ultra-sonographic finding .</detailed_description>
