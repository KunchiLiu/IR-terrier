	<brief_summary>Invasive coronary angiography currently consider gold standard assessment coronary artery disease although method limitation . Most importantly invasive angiography depicts coronary anatomy without determine physiological significance i.e likelihood stenosis impedes oxygen delivery heart muscle . Fractional flow reserve ( FFR ) catheterization technique assess physiological significance coronary artery lesion invasive coronary angiography . Coronary compute tomographic angiography ( CCTA ) noninvasive image test become alternative route diagnosis patient suspect coronary artery disease . Computational fluid dynamic combine anatomical model base CCTA scan allow determination coronary flow pressure , emerge promising diagnostic modality call CT-FFR . In Project New Mathematical algorithm develop computation CT-FFR . The main objective study determine diagnostic accuracy CT-FFR value obtain new method compare invasive coronary angiography fractional flow reserve state-of-the-art dobutamin stress echocardiography .</brief_summary>
