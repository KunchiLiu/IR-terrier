	<brief_summary>It would valuable evaluate whether gadoxetic acid-enhanced liver MRI would provide additional value characterize atypical small ( 1~2cm ) hepatic nodule CT reduce necessity biopsy patient high risk HCC . Therefore , purpose study evaluate add value gadoxetic acid-enhanced MRI diagnosis HCC patient small ( 10-19mm ) atypical hepatic nodule CT .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Added Value Gadoxetic Acid-enhanced Liver MRI</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>In term confirmative diagnosis , HCC unique compare malignant tumor , diagnose noninvasively base characteristic imaging feature , , arterial hyperenhancement ( washin ) hypoenhancement ( washout ) portal delayed phase contrast-enhanced compute tomography ( CT ) magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) use extracellular contrast medium ( ECCM ) . According Liver Imaging Reporting Data System ( LI-RADS ) , hypointensity isointensity hepatobiliary phase ( HBP ) gadoxetic acid-enhanced MRI suggestive malignancy benignity , respectively , feature uniquely provide hepatocyte-specific contrast agent . However , feature include diagnostic criterion non-specificity , indeed , gadoxetic acid-enhanced MRI yet include AASLD EASL guideline diagnostic modality . If gadoxetic acid-enhanced MRI would provide good performance diagnose HCC CT , gadoxetic acid-enhanced MRI consider next step biopsy small and/or atypical nodule avoid potential diagnostic pitfall morbidity , currently depend physician ' decision . Thus , would valuable evaluate whether gadoxetic acid-enhanced liver MRI would provide additional value characterize atypical small ( 1~2cm ) hepatic nodule CT reduce necessity biopsy patient high risk HCC . Therefore , purpose study evaluate add value gadoxetic acid-enhanced MRI diagnosis HCC patient small ( 10-19mm ) atypical hepatic nodule CT .</detailed_description>
