	<brief_title>Objective Assessment Physical Activity During Chemotherapy Breast Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Over 3.1 million woman currently live diagnosis breast cancer United States ( US ) , represent 41 % female cancer survivor US1 . The increase breast cancer survival rate necessitate shift cancer care toward develop intervention empower patient improve quality-of-life , perhaps prognosis , treatment . Among woman diagnose early-stage ( I II ) breast cancer , around 40 % receive chemotherapy . Among woman diagnose late-stage ( III IV ) , around 75 % receive chemotherapy.1 Adjuvant chemotherapy associate many side effect , include fatigue , nausea , disturbed sleep , decreased activity , weight gain.2-5 Women receive chemotherapy gain average 2.5 6.2 kg therapy.6 Weight gain increase risk breast cancer recurrence mortality , well cardiovascular disease , diabetes , second primary cancers.7 Physical activity alleviate reduces short long term treatment side effect chemotherapy , include weight gain , restore physical function breast cancer patients.6,8,9Additionally , randomize control trial breast cancer patient show add exercise chemotherapy program improve breast cancer outcomes.10 Although many benefit engage physical activity cancer treatment , activity level typically decline throughout treatment.2 Existing research rely self-reported activity level , poor measure low-intensity activity capture periodic snap shot activity levels.2,11,12This study provide objective physical activity data across entirety patient 's chemotherapy treatment . This depth data provide new perspective pattern activity level help identify critical time intervene prevent physical activity decline .</detailed_description>
