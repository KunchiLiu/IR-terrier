	<brief_summary>This study first administration GSK2292767 human . The study evaluate safety , tolerability , pharmacokinetics ( PK ) pharmacodynamics ( PD ) single repeat inhaled dos GSK2292767 healthy smoker . This study intend provide sufficient confidence safety molecule preliminary information target engagement allow progression repeat dose proof mechanism study . This two part , single site , randomize , double-blind ( sponsor open ) , placebo control study . Part A consist two 3-period interlock cohort evaluate safety , tolerability pharmacokinetics ascend single dos GSK2292767 administer dry powder inhalation . Part B plan follow Part A progression base acceptable safety , tolerability pharmacokinetic profile . Subjects receive repeat dos GSK2292767 daily 14 day Part B .</brief_summary>
