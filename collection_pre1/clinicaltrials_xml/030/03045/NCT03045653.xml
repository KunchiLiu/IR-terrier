	<brief_summary>Background : Endocrine therapy effective safe treatment hormone receptor positive breast cancer . Unfortunately , endocrine treatment resistance occur urgent need treatment alternative . Laboratory research clinical case report indicate hormone receptor-high express breast cancer patient may potentially benefit high-dose Tamoxifen therapy , provide new option treatment strategy . Aim : To explore efficacy safety high-dose Tamoxifen advance hormone receptor-high express endocrine therapy resist breast cancer . Methods : Eligible patient treat tamoxifen 100 mg/d . Blood tumor sample obtain patient . Primary endpoint : clinical benefit rate 16 week ( CBR )</brief_summary>
