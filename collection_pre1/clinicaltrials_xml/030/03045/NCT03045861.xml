	<brief_summary>GSK2838232 novel HIV-1 maturation inhibitor ( MI ) develop treatment HIV-1 infection combination antiretroviral therapy ( ART ) . This study 10-day monotherapy , open-label , adaptive , dose ranging , repeat-dose study . This study conduct two Parts ( Part A Part B ) consist single daily dos GSK2838232 Cobicistat Day 1 Day 10 . This proof concept open-label study aim characterize acute antiviral activity , pharmacokinetics ( PK ) , relationship PK antiviral activity , safety GSK2838232/cobi administer across range dose 10 day HIV-1 infected patient . A cohort 10 subject study Part I follow interim ( go/no-go ) analysis Part A data . On completion interim analysis part A data , cohorts 8 subject study Part B parallel design two cohort ( depend upon data obtain Part A ) . Approximately 34 HIV-1 infect treatment-naive subject enrol study . Subjects part screen visit within 30 day prior first dose follow-up visit 7-14 day last dose . Maximum duration study participation approximately 6 Weeks .</brief_summary>
