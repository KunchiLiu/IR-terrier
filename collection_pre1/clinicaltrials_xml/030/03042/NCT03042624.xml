	<brief_title>Efficacy Fermented Rice Flour Treatment Atopic Dermatitis : Randomized , Double-blind Controlled Trial</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Atopic dermatitis ( AD ) , itchy eczema chronic relapsing course , common clinical manifestation atopy first year life . On basis available knowledge , AD produce alteration skin barrier trigger inflammatory reaction . Such reaction characterize early phase abundance Th2 cytokine ( IL-4 , IL-5 ) eosinophils late phase predominance Th1 cytokine ( IL-2 , IL-12 IFN-gamma ) . Emollients , possibly supplement ceramides , represent first step treatment AD . Corticosteroids effective topical drug . The use topical immune-modulators ( tacrolimus pimecrolimus ) offer alternative steroid therapy long-term treatment . Severe case require systemic therapy steroid cyclosporine phototherapy narrowband ultraviolet ( UVB ) psoralen-ultraviolet A ( PUVA ) phototherapy . The use probiotic treatment AD attract much interest recent year available data conclusive . Probiotic-like effect obtain inactivated bacteria isolate bacterial component extensive definition probiotic propose bacterial cell bacterial component beneficial impact health well-being guest . Using repeated-measure cohort design , investigator recently show administration fermented-rice flour obtain Lactobacillus paracasei CBA L74 associate decrease SCORAD ( score atopic dermatitis ) child AD . SCORAD commonly employ indicator AD activity minimal clinically important difference know , make suitable metric clinical trial . The fermented rice flour , obtain Lactobacillus paracasei CBA L74 ( Heinz Italia SpA , Latina , Italy ) , contain live bacteria . Lactobacillus paracasei CBA L74 belong list microorganism qualify presumption safety compile European Food Safety Authority ( EFSA ) , test absence antibiotic resistance gene accordance EFSA , genetically characterize repetitive extragenic palindromic polymerase chain reaction . Pre-clinical study show anti-inflammatory effect matrix ferment Lactobacillus paracasei CBA-L74 term production IL-10 reduction IL-12 response bacterial stimulation . Such pre-clinical data obtain dendritic cell , intestinal biopsy murine model . The present randomize , double-blind , control trial aim test whether ferment rice flour obtain Lactobacillus paracasei CBA L74 effective reduce SCORAD child moderate severe AD use placebo comparator .</detailed_description>
