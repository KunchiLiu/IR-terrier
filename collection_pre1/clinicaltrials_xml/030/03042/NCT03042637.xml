	<brief_summary>The management steroid-resistant nephrotic syndrome ( SRNS ) remain persistent problem investigator part wide array pathogenic mechanism contribute disorder well lack adequately power , control trial . While glucocorticoid remain primary therapy many form protein uric glomerular disease , prolong use associate significant morbidity include steroid induce diabetes , metabolic bone disease , excessive weight gain .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Safety Efficacy Combination Acthar Gel Tacrolimus Treatment Steroid Resistant Nephrotic Syndrome</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Multiple agent investigated treatment patient SRNS , consensus constitutes optimal therapy . Previous study examine efficacy combine intravenous cyclophosphamide corticosteroid show complete partial response rate 40 % 60 % . More recently , calcineurin inhibitor ( CNI ) become effective second line therapy similar response rate 50 % -70 % . However , treatment regiment limit risk infection well development CNI-induced nephrotoxicity progressive renal disease . Acthar gel porcine pituitary preparation compose ACTH proopiomelanocortin peptide currently approve treatment idiopathic nephrotic syndrome . Previous study , well current study , show ACTHar gel effectively reduce proteinuria idiopathic membranous glomerulonephritis form glomerulopathy include focal segmental glomerulosclerosis ( FSGS ) advance diabetic nephropathy . While mechanism unknown , previous study show melanocortin 1-receptors express glomerular podocytes activation receptor pathway could involve protein lower effect ACTHar gel . Incubation culture podocytes ACTH lead activation MCR-1 receptor subsequent stimulation protein kinase A ( PKA ) G-protein-dependent pathway . The downstream phosphorylation stabilization Rho GTPases , synaptopodin cell-cytoskeletal associated protein may stabilize podocyte function density .</detailed_description>
