	<brief_summary>Immunotherapy include class medication call checkpoint inhibitor , relatively new medication therapy many type cancer metastatic , mean spread part body.Immune therapy medication may give safely radiation treatment , rare case may even make radiotherapy effective . When radiation therapy give `` palliative '' set give treat pain/discomfort necessarily shrink get rid tumour . Palliative radiotherapy may give many reason , common example include painful bone liver tumour , brain metastasis , symptom chest tumour feeling breathless , cough , bleed . Palliative radiotherapy usually give small amount less frequently type radiation therapy . Because checkpoint inhibitor relatively new huge amount evidence look patient respond treatment combine , patient immune therapy may make radiation therapy even effective . This study look way patient start immune therapy recommend palliative radiotherapy , respond combination two treatment . The purpose study describe treatment outcome patient cancer spread manage combination immune therapy medication radiotherapy . This research do limited information outcome combine immune therapy radiotherapy treatment patient 's perspective , also term patient may better response combine treatment . In particular , study aim describe combine treatment affect cancer area radiotherapy give , also outside part body receive radiotherapy ( call `` abscopal '' effect ) .</brief_summary>
