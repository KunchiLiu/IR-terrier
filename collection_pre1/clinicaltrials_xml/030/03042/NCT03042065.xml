	<detailed_description>Asthma chronic ( long-term ) lung disease inflame narrows airway . Asthma cause recur period wheeze ( whistle sound breathe ) , chest tightness , shortness breath , cough . The coughing often occur night early morning . Sometimes asthma symptom mild go away minimal treatment asthma medicine . Other time , symptom continue get bad . When symptom get intense and/or symptom occur , call asthma attack . Asthma attack also call flare-ups exacerbation . International Study Asthma Allergies Childhood ( ISAAC ) find 14 % world 's child likely asthmatic symptom last year , crucially , prevalence childhood asthma varies widely country , center within country study . These conclusion result ISAAC 's groundbreaking survey representative sample 798,685 child age 13-14 year 233 center 97 country . ( ISAAC also study young age group child ( 6-7 year ) finding generally similar old child ) . These adolescent ask whether experienced wheeze precede 12 month . Prevalence recent wheeze vary widely . The high prevalence ( &gt; 20 % ) generally observe Latin America English-speaking country Australasia , Europe North America well South Africa . The low prevalence ( &lt; 5 % ) observe Indian subcontinent , Asia-Pacific , Eastern Mediterranean , Northern Eastern Europe . In Africa , 10-20 % prevalence mostly observe . The majority child asthma stable disease , minority experience exacerbation need hospitalization emergency room visit . In old child , recent advance treatment seem reduce chronic morbidity well number acute exacerbation . In infant young child , goal may difficult achieve , give heterogeneity obstructive lung disease age group . Viral wheeze common clinical scenario young child , identification proper treatment subject potential development asthma future exacerbation still unresolved challenge . Even severe asthma exacerbation relatively common , mortality asthma child rare decline . In United Kingdom mortality rate child 0-14 year less one per 100.000 child per year . In contrast , vast increase economic cost associate asthma . However , main economic burden childhood asthma link indirect cost , long-term follow medication , hospitalization . Acute severe asthma represent one common medical emergency situation serious clinical presentation asthma . Asthma typically characterize presence severe respiratory distress due asthma episode require use bronchodilator , oxygen corticosteroid . Asthma attack severe even life threaten . Features acute severe attack include ; Peak expiratory flow ( PEF ) 33-50 % best ( use % predicted recent best unknown ) , tachycardia tachypnea . Life threaten attack include pulse oxymetry &lt; 92 % , Silent chest , cyanosis , feeble respiratory effort , Arrhythmia hypotension Exhaustion , alter consciousness . A severe asthma exacerbation usually present clinically dyspnea rest ; interfere conversation peak expiratory flow rate ( PEFR ) &lt; 40 % , usually require hospitalization . Acute severe asthma one common medical emergency situation childhood , physicians care acutely ill child regularly face condition . The cornerstones management acute asthma child rapid administration oxygen , inhalation bronchodilator systemic corticosteroid . Inhaled bronchodilator may include selective b2-agonists , adrenaline anticholinergic . Additional treatment select case may involve intravenous administration theophylline , b2-agonists magnesium sulphate . Both non-invasive invasive ventilation may option medical treatment fail prevent respiratory failure . It important relevant treatment algorithm exist , applicable level treatment chain reflect local consideration circumstance . Despite recent progress treatment chronic asthma childhood , acute exacerbation continue occur . Physicians work within field pediatric emergency medicine therefore continue expose clinical scenario . The cornerstone acute asthma management childhood remain rapid onset oxygen treatment , inhalation bronchodilator systemic corticosteroid . Short-acting bronchodilator provide immediate relief asthma symptom effect last four six hour . The commonly use short-acting bronchodilator asthma albuterol . These medication work quickly , help control symptom severe asthma attack . The dos well way delivery important reach best bronchodilator effect . The amount product effectively reach bronchus relatively small 0.1 % 11 % , respectively use lung simulator . Despite high variation amount product delivery patient narrow limit dose benefice side effect , aerosolize route remain preferred one even severe case .</detailed_description>
