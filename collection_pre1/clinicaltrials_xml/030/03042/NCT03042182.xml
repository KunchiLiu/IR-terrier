	<brief_summary>Cholangiocarcinoma ( CCA ) malignant neoplasm originate epithelial cell line intra- extrahepatic biliary duct . It second-most common liver cancer , hepatocellular carcinoma ( HCC ) . About 6,000 people United States develop bile duct cancer year . One-year survival le 25 % effective safe systemic treatment currently available . Last year completion open-label phase 2 trial ( NCT02256514 ) hepcortespenlisimut-L ( V5 ) report , show two-third Mongolian patient advance HCC favorable clinical response , include complete remission overall survival 90 % 1 year . So far patient CCA treat V5 , appear response rate somewhat inferior patient HCC since two ( hemochromatosis ) six patient die within 6 month . In one patient improve clinically , improvement correlate decrease CA19-9 tumor marker , marker profile information available regard CCA patient . As V5 tablet make pooled blood patient HCC , theory , useful patient CCA . The goal project manufacture immunotherapeutic formulation make pooled heat- chemically-inactivated blood donor CCA initiate pilot open-label trial 20 cholangiocarcinoma patient . This clinical trial conduct collaboration National Cancer Center .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Upon obtain regulatory ethical approval Phase II single-arm study initiate NCC involve 20 patient confirm CCA diagnosis . The trial short , last 2 month , sufficient gauge safety efficacy . Only patient higher normal level CA19-9 tumor marker enrol , serve surrogate marker manner alpha fetoprotein ( AFP ) use predictor clinical response HCC patient . Additional primary endpoint overall survival change tumor burden , secondary endpoint liver function test change quality life .</detailed_description>
