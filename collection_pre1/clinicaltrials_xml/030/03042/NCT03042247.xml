	<brief_summary>According recent guideline , total-body image technique indispensable element stag post-treatment re-evaluation patient lymphoma . Fluorodeoxyglucose-positron emission tomography/computed tomography ( FDG-PET/CT ) gold-standard assessment disease patient . The use alternative method , without radiation , whole-body magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) , could valid alternative ; would result advantage , consider young age majority patient diagnosis need undergo serial assessment . The recent introduction combine PET total body MRI ( PET/MRI ) offer possibility integrate morphological information high resolution MRI metabolic activity PET , uptake FDG , accurate definition extent disease patient lymphoma .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Prospective Comparison Between FDG-PET/MR FDG-PET/CT Classical Hodgkin Lymphoma DLBC Non-Hodgkin Lymphoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>All patient diagnose classical Hodgkin lymphoma diffuse large B-cell non-Hodgkin lymphoma meet inclusion criterion enrol study . They undergo FDG-PET/CT define stag therapeutic strategy . PET/MRI scan perform immediately upon completion PET/contrast-enhanced CT study FDG tracer inject PET/CT exam PET/MRI acquisition practice use residual activity tracer . All patient provide inform consent order participate study . The combined assessment FDG-PET/CT FDG-PET/MRI perform diagnosis staging , interim evaluation early assessment treatment response 2 cycle chemotherapy finally post-chemotherapy re-staging . The enrollment period 24 month total 50 patient . Patients enrol study follow diagnostic/therapeutic program Hematology Department Federico II University Naples , FDG-PET/CT FDG-PET/MRI examination carry IRCSS SDN Naples . The acquired image evaluate panel experienced radiologist nuclear physician IRCSS SDN Naples simultaneously Hôpital Henri Mondor ( Hôpitaux Universitaires Henri Mondor ) Créteil . The result obtain examination MRI modify way clinical therapeutic choice plan chemotherapy patient , receive additional radiation . This prospective pilot study conduct approval Ethics Committee ; patient sign appropriate inform consent .</detailed_description>
