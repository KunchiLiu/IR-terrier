	<brief_title>Phase I Dose-escalation Study Fractionated 177Lu-PSMA-617 Progressive Metastatic CRPC</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Phase I dose escalation study 177Lu-PSMA-617 use dose fractionation regimen perform patient documented progressive metastatic CRPC . The cumulative 177Lu dose [ 100 mCi ( 3.7 GBq ) - 600 mCi ( 22.2 GBq ) ] escalate 6 different dose level ( 3 + 3 study design ) . Additional 10 subject enrol MTD dose level ass safety tolerability obtain preliminary assessment efficacy . The study enroll adult males 18 year age older document progressive metastatic CRPC . The primary objective : - To determine dose limit toxicity ( DLT ) fractionate dose 177Lu-PSMA-617 - To determine maximal tolerate recommend phase II dose 177Lu-PSMA-617 2-week dose-fractionation regimen Subjects receive follow study intervention : 1 . 177Lu-PSMA-617 [ 50mCi ( 1.85GBq ) - 300mCi ( 11.1GBq ) ] intravenous X2 dos , 2 week apart ( Visit 1 2 ) 2 . 68Ga-PSMA-HBED-CC [ 5 ±2mCi 185 ±74MBq ] intravenous screen 12 week standard image Subjects study screen end study ( day 85 ) . The treatment phase comprise 8 visit 12 week . Patients follow death survival assessment . Patients remove study unacceptable adverse event follow resolution stabilization adverse event . All test procedure perform study routine standard care except : 68Ga-PSMA-HBED-CC PET/CT scan , administration investigational agent 177Lu-PSMA-617 , research blood sample ( CTCs research , cell-free DNA sample ) , PSMA test archive tissue .</detailed_description>
