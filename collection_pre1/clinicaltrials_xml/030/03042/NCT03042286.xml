	<brief_summary>To find pharmacokinetic genetic risk factor involve muscular side effect ( myalgia ) associate statin therapy . To learn good way identify risk factor associate muscle side effect statin therapy . To perform laboratory analysis identify factor predict future outcome . The genetic material , combination medical information blood test , available researcher study genetic factor contribute myalgia cause patient population statin medication . Patients statin select study . This study recruit 1500 subject National heart Centre Singapore period 2.5 year . Participation full study include donation genetic material . However , subject option blood subject genetic analysis still participate study . In case , blood sample analyze statin drug content .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Objective characterize relationship genetic polymorphism inter-individual variability plasma statin metabolite concentration ( ) quantify contribution towards clinically significant statin induced muscle ADR phenotypes myopathy and/or myalgia Singapore population . Methodology : This research involve study two different kind muscle ADRs commonly associate statin therapy , namely myalgia myopathy . The study myalgia include recruitment sample collection ( blood ) 3000 subject outpatient clinic NUH NHC , either simvastatin atorvastatin . To identify genetic variant associate alter stain exposure , investigator perform analysis drug metabolite level plasma , follow genetic analysis DNA blood sample recruit subject . A subgroup 30 subject ( 15 NUH 15 NHC ) large cohort use study intra-subject variability statin drug metabolite exposure . The genetic association analysis genotype statin blood measurement do use liner regression analysis . To test hypothesis relate pharmacokinetic variant associate myalgia myopathy , investigator perform case-control association analysis use logistic regression examine frequency genetic variant patient clinically identify ADRs compare control subject without ADRs . A separate cohort 200 subject recruit myopathy study NUH outpatient clinic follow subject identification IRB approve medical record review patient were/are statin drug/dose . Blood sample collect patient subject genetic analysis identify genetic variant associate symptomatic phenotype . Potential Benefits risk : The potential benefit study include , identify strong risk factor statin induced muscle symptom myalgia/myopathy inform clinical practice minimizing/ manage severity statin associate muscle symptom , identify patient population increase risk statin induce myalgia and/or myopathy . This information might ultimately inform treatment decision include drug selection dose improve prediction treatment response heterogeneous population . The possible risk study associate blood-taking . Obtaining blood cause pain , bleeding , bruising , swell site needle stick . Fainting sometimes occur infection rarely occur .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>For myopathy cohort : 1 . Subjects are/were statin drug dose 2 . Subjects reported/ diagnose myopathy =10X normal CK level 3 . Myopathy subject statin induce For myalgia cohort : 1 . Subjects either Simvastatin Atorvastatin 2 . If subject experience muscle symptom without CK elevation ( myalgia ) , statin induce 3 . Compliance five consecutive statin dose prior sample collection For myalgia subgroup ( n=30 ) intraindividual variability assessment : 1 . Subjects either Simvastatin Atorvastatin 2 . If subject experience muscle symptom without CK elevation ( myalgia ) , statin induce 3 . Subjects willing provide two blood sample 3 separate visit 4 . Compliance five consecutive statin dose prior sample collection 1 . Unable unwilling give write informed consent 2 . Subjects pregnant breast feeding</criteria>
