	<brief_summary>At present , combined modality treatment preoperative neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy ( NCRT ) follow radical surgery become standard care locally advance mid/low rectal cancer , prove substantially improve local control disease , whereas able improve long-term survival . According present clinical practice guideline , patient cT3-4N0M0 cTanyN1-2M0 mid/low rectal cancer recommend undergo preoperative long-term radiotherapy concurrent 5FU base chemotherapy , follow radical resection tumor . After surgery , adjuvant chemotherapy ( ACT ) recommend patient without consider postoperative pathological result . Recently , however , author propose different strategy combine modality therapy apply different patient accord risk relapse , instead use uniform NCRT strategy . In research , basis investigator 's previous clinical practice research , investigator plan stratify patient cT3-4N0M0 cTanyN1-2M0 mid/low rectal cancer several subgroup accord tumor stage risk relapse . Different therapeutic strategy apply different group , aim improve overall therapeutic effect , well reduce treatment adverse effect . This research consist four trial .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Multicenter , Prospective , RCTï¼šInvestigation Combined Modality Therapy Locally Advanced Mid/Low Rectal Cancer .</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Trial A : A multicenter , prospective , randomized trial compare neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy ( NCRT ) follow radical surgery surgery alone cT3a-bN0-1aM0 mid rectal cancer . Research object : Patients locally advanced rectal cancer , clinically stag T3a-bN0-1aM0 rectal MRI and/or endorectal ultrasonography ( ERUS ) , tumor locate 6-12 cm anal verge . After give fully inform consent , prospective participant randomly divide two group , receive follow two treatment modality . Group A1 : radical surgery + adjuvant chemotherapy ( ACT ) Group A2 : NCRT + radical surgery + ACT Trial B : A multicenter , prospective , randomized trial compare combine versus single-agent chemotherapy concurrent radiotherapy cT4NanyM0 cTanyN2M0 rectal cancer . Research object : Patients locally advanced rectal cancer , clinically stag cT4NanyM0 cTanyN2M0 rectal MRI and/or ERUS , patient risk factor tumor relapse . After give fully inform consent , prospective participant randomly divide two group , receive follow two treatment modality . Group A1 : NCRT combine chemotherapy ( Capox regimen ) + radical surgery + ACT Group A2 : NCRT single-agent chemotherapy ( Capecitabine ) + radical surgery + ACT Trial C : A multicenter , prospective , randomized trial compare transanal ndoscopic microsurgery ( TEM ) excision versus radical resection rectal cancer stag clinical complete response ( cCR ) NCRT . Research object : Patients locally advanced rectal cancer , clinically stag cCR NCRT . After give fully inform consent , prospective participant randomly divide two group , receive follow two treatment modality . Group A1 : TEM excision + ACT Group A2 : radical surgery + ACT Trial D : A prospective , observational study determine value circulate tumor DNA ( ctDNA ) predict therapeutic effect NCRT locally advance rectal cancer patient ' long-term prognosis . Research object : Patients locally advance mid/low rectal cancer ( cT3-4N0M0 cTanyN+M0 ) undergo NCRT . After give fully inform consent , prospective participant undergo classical 'NCRT + radical surgery + ACT ' comprehensive treatment . Serial analysis ctDNA perform specific time point include pre-NCRT , post-NCRT , postoperative week 1 , post-ACT , postoperative year 1 , 2 , 3 . The next-generation sequencing surgical specimen perform well . Participants observe examined entire course treatment follow-up period . The pathological result surgical specimen 3 year disease free survival ( 3y-DFS ) main end-points .</detailed_description>
