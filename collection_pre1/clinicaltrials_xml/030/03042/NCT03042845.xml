	<detailed_description>From entrance first diagnostic catheter sheath completion diagnostic coronary angiography measurement endpoint study . In case failure complete coronary angiogram catheter study crossover catheter study take place except case severe spasm , catheter choice discretion operator . In case failure study 's catheter , next catheter 's selection operator 's discretion . Patients include study , process adhoc PCI , monitor baseline creatinine creatinine value day 2 3 coronary angiography . In angiography film conduct offline analysis two experience operator score opacification grade coronary ostium contact catheter use .
