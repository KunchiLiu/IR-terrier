	<brief_summary>Due late onset symptom , gastric cancer frequently diagnose advanced stage therefore incurable situation . Standard treatment patient palliative chemotherapy , combine 2 3 drug ( Wagner et al ) However chemotherapy efficacy remain insufficient , expose patient severe toxicity . Taking account low complication rate gastric surgery today , chemotherapy alone therefore may sufficient stage IV gastric cancer patient . The purpose palliative gastrectomy relieve symptom associate cancer , prevent subsequent tumour complication likely occur , improve quality life . In addition reduce tumour burden , may associate prolonged survival time . This study design multicentre trial . Patients diagnosis primary stage IV gastric adenocarcinoma willing participate trial randomize surgical ( gastric resection peri-operative chemotherapy ) control ( chemotherapy ) group . Primary objective overall survival secondary objective quality life , progression free survival , surgical related postoperative morbidity mortality , chemotherapy related toxicity , overall duration hospitalization number interventional palliative procedure</brief_summary>
