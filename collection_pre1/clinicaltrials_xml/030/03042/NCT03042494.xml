	<brief_summary>In recent year , importance gut microbiota human health demonstrate . In adulthood , microbial profile relatively stable , yet transiently altered factor diet antibiotic treatment . Such change may beneficial , gut microbiota show differ normal versus disease state include inflammatory bowel disease , obesity , type 2 diabetes fatty liver disease . Given relationship , intense interest design intervention positively influence gut microbial profile . Prebiotics non-digestible , fermentable oligo- polysaccharide alter colonic environment favour health-promoting bacterial specie , bifidobacteria selectively ferment prebiotics . Given ability prebiotics beneficially alter microbial profile , need identify dose requirement positively modulate gut microbiota . This study test effect two dos prebiotic gut microbiota taxonomy diversity .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Effect Prebiotic Intake Gut Microbiota Healthy Adults</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The primary objective determine effect 4 week intake moderate dose ( 7 g/d ) low dose ( 2.5-3 g/d ) prebiotic gut microbiota profile healthy adult compare non-prebiotic contain control . The primary outcome change microbial composition ( measure via 16S rRNA sequence ) . The secondary outcome change gastrointestinal ( GI ) tolerance ( measure via questionnaire ) ; change fecal short chain fatty acid ; change quality life . This study consist two separate trial 12 week duration . Each trial perform double-blind , randomize , placebo-controlled crossover manner 4 week intervention period follow 4 week wash-out period final 4 week cross .</detailed_description>
