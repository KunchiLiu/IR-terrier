	<detailed_description>This study conduct 2 part : prospective retrospective . The prospective study evaluate use Xpert MTB/RIF . The study conduct three large tertiary care hospital : King Chulalongkorn Memorial Hospital , Rajavithi Hospital Bamrasnaradura Infectious Diseases Institute . Only pulmonologists infectious disease physician extensive experience TB participate study . Patients suspect PTB enrol study . Expectorated sputum collect transferred central laboratory , Chulalongkorn Research Center ( CRC ) Laboratory , King Chulalongkorn Memorial Hospital . Each sample divide two part ; one part Xpert MTB/RIF ( Cepheid ) another part mycobacterial culture . Drug susceptibility test streptomycin , isoniazid , rifampicin ethambutol perform rapid qualitative procedure ( BACTEC™ MGIT™ 960 SIRE Kit ) semi-automated system ( BACTEC™ MGIT™ 960 System ) . Discordant result MGIT Xpert retested rpoB gene sequence system . All PTB patient promptly treat anti-TB drug regimen WHO 's recommendation . All patient HIV test do CD4 cell count obtain HIV-infected patient . Antiretroviral treatment prophylaxis opportunistic infection prescribe standard treatment guideline patient HIV/TB co-infection . The patient follow completion TB treatment change diagnosis . The WHO definition cure , complete treatment , dead , default treatment failure use define outcome treatment . The author , therefore , evaluate utility Xpert MTB/RIF Thailand , prior nation-wide implementation . In summary , real-life cohort study use Xpert MTB/RIF early diagnosis PTB rifampicin resistance high TB burden country outside African region . The result may beneficial guiding policy maker , especially National Tuberculosis Programme ( NTP ) control TB transmission , country move towards universal use Xpert MTB/RIF . The retrospective study assess urine LAM test evaluate non-HIV-infected immunocompromised Asians disseminate TB non-disseminated TB ( TB locate one organ ) poor sensitivity specificity detect pulmonary TB patient without HIV infection . On account , author evaluate applicability efficacy TB diagnosis use urine confirm cultured TB case various immune response condition , HIV-infected , non-HIV-infected non-HIV-infected immunocompromised patient . The author find sensitivity urine LAM HIV-infected non-HIV-infected patient similar previous report . This confirmed urine LAM use alone screen TB . However , use conjunction culture AFB smear test patient co-infected HIV low CD4 count . The urine LAM test especially helpful case smear negative probable-TB patient . For reason , urine LAM test attractive invasive , sample need easily collect type disseminate patient without HIV . Aside , urine LAM test use severely ill patient , regardless HIV infection , difficult physically collect sputum paucibacillary sample . The PPV 80 % infected HIV 100 % non-HIV-infected patient . For physician , PPV useful sensitivity specificity assay answer question likely patient positive result urine LAM test TB . A high PPV accurately guide physician confidentially prescribe TB medication crucial , especially among co-infected patient severely ill. For reason , urine LAM test seem great point-of-care test easily incorporate AFB smear culture test Asian population . Furthermore , study demonstrate positive urine LAM test result significantly associate death , especially HIV infection . This association much strong patient low CD4 count . The finding study suggest possible use urine LAM test AFB smear culture resource-limited country diagnose TB advance HIV non-HIV-infected patient TB . This promising diagnostic tool increase yield TB diagnosis predict mortality rate TB infection , particularly advanced HIV patient .</detailed_description>
