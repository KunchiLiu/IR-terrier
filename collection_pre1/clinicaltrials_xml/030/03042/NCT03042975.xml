	<brief_summary>The contribution genetic risk factor development focal dystonias evident . However , understand variation causative gene expression lead variation brain abnormality different phenotype dystonia ( e.g. , familial , sporadic ) remain limited . The research program investigator set determine relationship brain change genetic risk factor spasmodic dysphonia ( laryngeal dystonia ) . The researcher use novel approach combine image genetics , next-generation DNA sequencing , clinico-behavioral neurotesting . The use cross-disciplinary approach tool discovery mediate neural mechanism bridge gap DNA sequence pathophysiology dystonia hold promise understanding mechanistic aspect brain function affect risk gene variant , use reliably discovery associate gene neural integrity marker disorder . The expected outcome study may lead good clinical management disorder , include improve detection , accurate diagnosis , assessment risk develop spasmodic dysphonia family member .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Spasmodic dysphonia ( SD ) isolate focal laryngeal dystonia characterize selective impairment voluntary voice control speech production . Despite well-characterized clinical feature SD , cause pathophysiology remain unclear . Consequently , absence objective biomarkers SD lead diagnostic inaccuracy , lack understanding neural molecular target SD pathophysiology hinders development novel therapeutic opportunity SD patient . The objective application identify imaging genetic biomarkers SD development manifestation . The central hypothesis functional structural brain abnormality , shape , part , underlie causative genetic factor , exhibit disorder-characteristic feature , use diagnostic predictive SD biomarkers . The rationale propose study identification SD neural genetic biomarkers would direct clinical impact establish enhance criterion accurate differential diagnosis , screen potential person at-risk , evaluation mechanism-based novel pharmacological and/or surgical therapy patient . Using comprehensive approach multi-modal neuroimaging , machine learning algorithm , next-generation DNA sequencing , central hypothesis test pursue three specific aim : ( 1 ) Identify validate SD phenotype- genotype-specific neural marker ; ( 2 ) Establish endophenotypic marker SD development ; ( 3 ) Identify SD gene ( ) association neural marker SD susceptibility . This research innovative , use cross-disciplinary approach tool discovery mediate neural mechanism bridge gap DNA sequence SD pathophysiology . The propose research significant expect advance expand understand mechanistic aspect brain alteration , identify neural marker discover SD gene mutation . Ultimately , result study expect establish new knowledge , critical enhancement SD clinical management identification novel approach new treatment option patient .</detailed_description>

Patients symptomatic present due treatment botulinum toxin injection laryngeal muscle . The duration positive effect botulinum toxin vary patient patient last average 34 month . Prior enter study , patient evaluate ensure fully symptomatic least 3 month post last injection . To avoid possibility confound effect drug act upon central nervous system , study participant question prescribed overthecounter medication part initial intake screening . Those patient receive medication ( ) affect central nervous system exclude study . The patient ask whether undergone head neck surgery , particularly brain surgery laryngeal surgery , thyroplasty , laryngeal denervation , selective laryngeal adductor denervationrennervation . Because brain laryngeal surgery may potentially lead brain structure function reorganization , patient history brain and/or laryngeal surgery might exclude study . Subjects extensive tattoos head neck , ferromagnetic object body ( e.g. , implanted stimulators , surgical clip , prosthesis , artificial heart valve , etc . ) remove purpose imaging study participation .</criteria>
