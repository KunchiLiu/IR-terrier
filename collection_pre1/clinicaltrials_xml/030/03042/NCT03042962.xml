	<brief_summary>Task-specific focal dystonias characterize selective activation dystonic movement performance highly learn motor task , write play musical instrument . To date , limited knowledge distinct neural abnormality lead development task-specificity focal dystonias , affect similar muscle group result different clinical manifestation , writer 's cramp vs. pianist 's dystonia spasmodic dysphonia vs. singer 's dystonia . Our goal dissect pathophysiological mechanism underlie phenomenon task specificity isolate focal dystonias use multi-level brain network analysis conjunction neuropathological examination postmortem brain tissue patient dystonia . Rather view disorder interest curiosity , understand biology task-specific activation motor program central understand dystonia .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Task-specific primary focal dystonias ( tsPFDs ) characterize selective activation dystonic movement performance highly learn motor task , write , play musical instrument , speaking , sing . Despite recent advance describe clinical feature dystonia , fundamental gap understand neural abnormality underlie development tsPFDs , affect muscle result different clinical manifestation writer 's cramp vs. pianist 's dystonia spasmodic dysphonia vs. singer 's dystonia . Continued existence gap important problem render u unable differentiate primary secondary brain change contribute tsPFD pathophysiology develop novel treatment option target disorder-specific brain alteration . The objective application identify brain mechanism underlie phenomenon task specificity two representative group patient writer 's cramp vs. musician 's hand dystonia spasmodic dysphonia vs. singer 's laryngeal dystonia use novel approach combine clinico-behavioral examination , brain network analysis quantitative neuropathology postmortem brain tissue . Our central hypothesis tsPFD characterize distinct brain abnormality , selectively affect focal segment brain network responsible performance respective motor task . The rationale propose research identification tsPFD-specific brain change associate neuropathology clarify neural mechanism ( primary vs. secondary ) contribute clinical manifestation disorder thus explain phenomenon task-specificity PFDs . The obtained result expect provide strong scientific base next series study direct towards identification validation novel pharmacological and/or surgical therapy patient . The researcher pursue follow two specific aim : ( 1 ) determine distinct feature brain functional network abnormality underlie task-specificity different tsPFDs , ( 2 ) establish structural correlate functional neuroimaging abnormality tsPFDs . The propose research significant expect establish scientific evidence tsPFD network disorder abnormality follow distinct pattern different tsPFDs certain abnormality show structure-function correlation associate underlying neuropathology . By converge result multimodal cross-disciplinary study coherent pathophysiologically meaningful picture , researcher well position identify primary vs. secondary change tsPFDs establish scientific framework development diagnostic biomarkers novel treatment option disorder .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Patients clinically document focal dystonia ( include spasmodic dysphonia , singer 's dystonia , writer 's cramp , musician 's focal hand dystonia ) Healthy control healthy volunteer negative history neurological , laryngeal psychiatric problem Age 21 80 year . Native English speaker . Righthandedness ( base Edinburgh Handedness Inventory ) . Subjects incapable give informed consent . Pregnant breastfeed woman time longer pregnant breastfeeding . All woman childbearing potential urine pregnancy test perform , must negative participation image study . Subjects past present medical history ( ) neurological problem , stroke , movement disorder ( dystonia patient group ) , brain tumor , traumatic brain injury loss consciousness , ataxia , myopathy , myasthenia gravis , demyelinate disease , alcoholism , drug dependence ; ( b ) psychiatric problem , schizophrenia , major and/or bipolar depression , obsessivecompulsive disorder ; ( c ) laryngeal problem , vocal fold paralysis , paresis , vocal fold nodule polyp , carcinoma , chronic laryngitis . Patients symptomatic due treatment botulinum toxin injection laryngeal muscle . The duration positive effect botulinum toxin vary patient patient last average 34 month . All patient evaluate ensure fully symptomatic prior enter study . Patients forms dystonia . Patients hereditary form dystonia ( e.g. , DYT1 , DYT6 , GNAL ) . If ARSG gene identify MD LD patient , use nuisance covariate imaging analysis . Patients dystonia symptom rest order avoid potential confound dystonic spasm occur scan . To avoid possibility confound effect drug act upon central nervous system , study participant question prescribed overthecounter medication part initial intake screening . Those patient receive medication ( ) affect central nervous system exclude study . The patient ask whether undergone head , neck , hand surgery , result change regional anatomy innervation . Because brain , hand laryngeal surgery may potentially lead brain structure function reorganization , patient history brain , hand and/or laryngeal surgery exclude study . Subjects tattoo , ferromagnetic object body ( e.g. , implanted stimulators , surgical clip , prosthesis , artificial heart valve , etc . ) remove purpose study participation .</criteria>
