Nonclinical study demonstrate Kevetrin induces apoptosis activation wild type p53 induces apoptosis mutant p53 cell degradation oncogenic mutant p53 . In Phase 2 study , two different short-term treatment regimens Kevetrin evaluate safety , tolerability , change biomarkers/objective tumor response , evaluate pharmacokinetics Kevetrin administer subject platinum-resistant/refractory ovarian cancer .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Phase 2 Study Kevetrin Subjects With Ovarian Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This open label , dose-escalation trial study safety , biomarker change ( include modulation p53 ) , objective tumor response change , pharmacokinetics follow administration two different treatment regimen Kevetrin 3-week period subject platinum-resistant/refractory ovarian cancer . Following 3 week Kevetrin dosing , subject follow 3 week completion Kevetrin treatment . Standard care treatment , medically appropriate per local guideline , outside study protocol commence collection post-Kevetrin treatment biomarker sample ( collect Day 21±1 day ) . The patient population recruit study include ovarian cancer patient platinum resistant/refractory disease , define disease progression/relapse within 6 month follow last administered dose platinum therapy ( resistant ) , lack response disease progression receive recent platinum base therapy ( refractory ) , respectively . Patients may may additional treatment ( e.g. , Doxil ) prior entry study . A total approximately 10 study participant plan enrol two cohort approximately 5 subject per cohort , enrollment sequential , dose-escalating fashion . Investigators subject aware treatment cohort recruiting . Cohort detail plan dos : Cohort 1 ( n=5 ) Kevetrin Cycle - Kevetrin 250 mg/m2 IV per dose every day ( q.o.d . ) / 3 dos per week ( 750 mg/m2 per week ) , 3 week ( single cycle ; total 9 dos ) ; Follow-up 3 week Kevetrin treatment end Cohort 2 ( n=5 ) Kevetrin Cycle - Kevetrin 350 mg/m2 IV per dose every day ( q.o.d . ) / 3 dos per week ( 1050 mg/m2 per week ) , 3 week ( single cycle ; total 9 dos ) ; Follow-up 3 week Kevetrin treatment end Cohorts 1 2 conduct sequential fashion , safety data cohort 1 evaluated independent Data Monitoring Committee ( DMC ) . The DMC make appropriate recommendation base available safety data regard intent progress high dose cohort 2 .</detailed_description>
