	<detailed_description>Background : Acromegaly slowly progressive disease cause growth hormone ( GH ) excess . The estimated prevalence disease 40 cases/1000000 population 3-4 new cases/1000000 population per year . Most patient classic manifestation due acral soft tissue change , include thicken calvarium , increase size frontal sinus , enlargement nose , prognathism , widely space teeth . The hands foot large , thicken bulky . Acromegaly also associate many comorbidities include cardiovascular complication ( acromegalic cardiomyopathy arterial hypertension ) , respiratory complication ( sleep apnea ) , metabolic complication ( impaired glucose tolerance , diabetes mellitus ) , joint bone complication ( carpal-tunnel syndrome , osteoarthritis ) .3 The outcome growth hormone level suppression transsphenoidal surgery far well microadenomas ( 80-90 % ) macroadenomas ( le 50 % ) . Furthermore , high growth hormone level diagnosis relate poor prognosis . An early detection acromegaly early intervention desirable . However , due slowly progression disease , time symptom onset diagnosis 5.2 5.9 year4 . Current method diagnose patient acromegaly check serum GH insulin-like growth factor 1 ( IGF-1 ) . However , test growth hormone IGF-1 currently unavailable hospital Taiwan expensive . We want find well screen tool acromegaly less expensive high efficacy . Due specific facial appearance acromegaly , study recognize acromegaly computer program1,2,3 . They try develop computer program separate facial photograph patient acromegaly normal subject . The accuracy could reach 71.9 % 86 % . Due enlarge hand increase soft tissue patient acromegaly , also want compare difference face , hand foot morphology face , hand foot X ray acromegaly patient normal population . We hope set computer model early detect acromegaly patient Chinese people .</detailed_description>
