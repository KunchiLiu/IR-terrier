	<brief_summary>Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome ( ARDS ) cause lungs fail due collection fluid lung ( pulmonary oedema ) . ARDS common severely ill patient Intensive Care Units associate high mortality high morbidity survive . There large economic burden direct healthcare cost , also indirectly due impact carer patient patient inability return full time employment . There little evidence effective drug ( pharmacological ) treatment ARDS . There increase information mesenchymal stem cell ( MSCs ) might important treating ARDS . REALIST investigate single infusion MSCs help treatment ARDS . The first step first determine dose MSCs safe divide patient suffer ARDS two group , one get MSCs harmless dummy ( placebo ) infusion , follow determine lung function improve . If effective may lead research determine MSCs effective patient ARDS . This project also provide new information mechanism development ARDS leading , potentially , new treatment</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The role MSCs novel treatment ARDS . Mesenchymal Stem Cells ( MSCs ) mononuclear cell population potential differentiate multiple lineage , bone , cartilage adipocyte cell particular . Cell-based therapy term `` next pillar Medicine '' . MSCs constitute innovative approach substantial therapeutic promise ARDS . MSCs possess several favorable biological characteristic , include convenient isolation , ease expansion culture maintain genetic stability , minimal immunogenicity feasibility allogenic transplantation . MSCs reduce inflammation enhance bacterial clearance rodent murine bacterial pneumonia , augment repair animal human lung . Large animal study also replicate beneficial effect . Bone marrow derive ( BM ) hMSCs decrease acute lung injury ( ALI ) , without produce organ toxicity , endotoxin injured pig . Two randomise small phase 1 study plastic adherent MSCs patient ARDS take place . In Japan , investigator use adipose-derived plastic adherent cell small cohort ( n=12 ) patient ARDS randomize 1:1 MSCs placebo : showing cell safe well-tolerated patient group , associate reduce plasma level alveolar epithelial cell injury marker SP-D . In US Matthay complete phase 1 START trial , use dose escalation study plastic adherent bone marrow derive MSCs , patient moderate severe ARDS . START show marrow derive MSCs similar dos propose study safe well-tolerated , ( n=9 ) , trend reduce lung injury group treat high ( 10x106cells/kg ) compare low dos , 1-5x106cells/kg . Research hypothesis : In adult patient moderate severe ARDS , human umbilical cord derive CD362 +ve MSCs , ( Cyndacel-C cell ) safe improve important surrogate clinical outcome . Trial design : The phase 1 trial open label dose escalation pilot study cohorts subject moderate severe ARDS receive increase dos single infusion Cyndacel-C 3+3 design . Initially 3 cohort 3 subjects/cohort . Planned dose 3 cohort pending absence safety concern 1 x 106 cells/kg , 5 x 106 cells/kg , 10 x 106 cells/kg . After 7 day follow-up study subject phase 1 study available TMG review data propose cell dose phase 2 trial . This recommendation submit DSMB approval prior initiate phase 2 trial . For planning purpose , phase 2 trial design use 10 x 106 cells/kg , dose assume maximal tolerate dose . The phase 2 trial randomize , double-blind , allocation conceal placebo-controlled study use 10x106 cell/kg dose Cyndacel-C maximal tolerable dose determine DSMB patient moderate severe ARDS . Primary objective : To assess safety single intravenous infusion Cyndacel-C cell patient ARDS . Secondary objective : In patient moderate severe ARDS determine effect single intravenous infusion Cyndacel-C cell : 1 . Physiological index respiratory dysfunction reflect severity ARDS , measure oxygenation index ( OI ) , respiratory compliance , P/F ratio 2 . Sequential organ failure assessment ( SOFA ) score 3 . Alveolar systemic marker inflammatory response 4 . Alveolar systemic marker cell specific injury Population : Patients prospectively screen daily . All patient ARDS enter screen log . If patient recruit reason record . A fully anonymised minimal dataset record patient ( age , gender , APACHE II score , worst P/F ratio time assessment , reason non-enrolment vital status ) . APACHE II score vital status collect use anonymised linkage ICNARC database define CMP number ( equivalent ) . This allow comparison identify study population representative overall cohort patient .

For continuously distribute outcome , difference group test use independent sample t-tests analysis covariance transformation variable normality appropriate , non-parametric equivalent . Chi-square test ( Fisher 's Exact test ) use categorical variable . A p value 0.05 consider significant . A single final analysis plan end phase 2 trial . A detailed statistical analysis plan write statistical analysis commences . All power calculation methodology data analysis confirm TBC , Senior Biostatiscian , Northern Ireland Clinical Trials Unit ( NICTU ) . Missing data : Every effort make minimise miss baseline outcome data trial . The level pattern miss data baseline variable outcomes establish form appropriate table likely cause miss data investigate . This information use determine whether level type miss data potential introduce bias analysis result propose statistical method , substantially reduce precision estimate related treatment effect . If necessary , issue deal use multiple imputation Bayesian method miss data appropriate . Sample size : The phase 1 trial recruit 9-18 participant . Although primary focus phase 2 trial safety , , however , power detect difference physiological outcome . The primary efficacy outcome measure difference OI Cyndacel-C placebo treat group day 7 . Based data recently complete clinical trial ARDS , mean ( standard deviation ; SD ) OI day 7 patient ARDS 62 ( 51 ) cmH2O/kPa . To allow 2:1 recruitment ( Cyndacel-C v placebo ) sample size 63 subject ( 42 Cyndacel-C , 21 placebo ) 80 % power two-tailed significance level 0.05 detect clinically significant difference 39 cmH2O/kPa OI group . In previous phase 2 study similar size intervention demonstrate change OI similar magnitude confirm treatment effect size achieve . Although withdrawals loss follow-up anticipate allow sample size calculation . In previous UK multicentre study critically ill &lt; 3 % withdraw consent lose follow-up . Therefore , conservative drop-out rate 5 % estimate study require total 66 patient ( 44 patient Cyndacel-C 22 placebo group ) .</detailed_description>
