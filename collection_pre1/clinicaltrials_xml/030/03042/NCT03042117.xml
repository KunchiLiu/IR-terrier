	<brief_summary>Cardiovascular disease one leading cause death United States world . Many intervention relate prevention emphasize risk factor devastate disease discover . Periodontal disease know close association cardiovascular disease , role risk factor still well understood . Inflammation drive force disease , create potential bridge two . Specifically , periodontal disease cause inflammatory reaction body , may predispose even directly contribute atheroma formation coronary artery . In study , investigator study link inflammatory state body search correlation level coronary artery disease periodontal disease . Inflammatory marker high-sensitivity C-reactive protein ( hs-CRP ) , erythrocyte sedimentation rate ( ESR ) , immunoglobulin G ( IgG ) level patient 's blood analyze correlated clinical attachment loss measure via pocket depth measurement , distance gingival margin base pocket . A definitive link disease process allow preventive measure take earlier prevent lifelong disease .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Dental probe use probe depth gum recession subject without history cardiac event . Venous blood sample also collect subject measurement sedimentation rate , myeloperoxidase , IgG level . Statistical analysis do , attempt identify difference gum recession depth and/or serum inflammatory marker among without prior cardiac event .</detailed_description>
