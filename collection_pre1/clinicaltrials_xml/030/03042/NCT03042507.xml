	<brief_summary>Analysis data recently complete NIH Child Comprehensive Behavioral Intervention Tics ( CBIT ) study find manualized behavioral treatment approach strongly superior psychoeducation/supportive therapy reduce tic severity 9-16 year-old youth TS Chronic Tic Disorders . Buoyed success NIH study , research group seek extend disseminate CBIT treatment systematic adaptation CBIT protocol use across broad range age treatment setting . The goal project develop downward extension CBIT therapist guide parent workbook use 4-8 year old child chronic tic . The revised CBIT-JR manual/workbook pilot test five child three study site ( UCLA , UWM , Weill Cornell ) order provide initial data regard treatment feasibility acceptability well ability implement new intervention , along relevant quality control procedure , consistently across site . These pilot data use seek R01 support large control multisite trial examine efficacy CBIT-JR . Although arguably complex single-site design , opt multsite study order : 1 ) take advantage establish productive collaborative relationship collective expertise childhood tic disorder psychosocial treatment development across three site , 2 ) collect propose feasibility data much short period time otherwise possible , note 3 ) demonstrate cross-site portability treatment - necessary obtain subsequent funding larger-scale efficacy trial .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The overall aim propose project develop obtain preliminary feasibility acceptability data family-based behavioral intervention reduce tic severity negative impact TS-related symptom young child ( age 4-8 ) chronic tic Tourette syndrome . This intervention entail use targeted psychoeducation tic related condition functional analytic protocol design identify correct environmental influence think exacerbate and/or maintain child tic expression . Although similar family-based component use recently complete CBITS trial old child , independent body literature support efficacy functional analysis ameliorate variety behaviorally biologically-driven behavior . The investigator work early child interventionist adapt current family-based protocol young child . The new manual feasibility test anticipation large externally-funded trial develop evaluate efficacy intervention . More specifically , study aim : 1 . Adapt current CBIT Manual use family 4-8 year old child chronic tic disorder . Our revision inform meeting study PI 's Dr. Mary O'Connor , early childhood interventionist UCLA review current family-intervention treatment protocol target related psychopathology young child . 2 .
