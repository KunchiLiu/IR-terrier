	<detailed_description>This phase 1b study investigational drug selinexor combination doxorubicin patient locally advance metastatic soft tissue sarcoma . Patients screen eligibility within 28 day start study drug . In addition standard test procedure , research tumor tissue ( archival fresh biopsy ) collect collection pharmacodynamics . Participants also ask agree optional biopsy 6 cycle cancer respond disease progression . Eligible participant receive study drug 21 day cycle . Selinexor give mouth doxorubicin give vein , week , 6 cycle . Participants restaged every 2 cycle . If participant respond treatment 6 cycle , may able continue selinexor alone maintenance treatment progression unacceptable toxicity . While receive study drug , many screen test repeat . Additional test procedure include blood sample collection pharmacokinetics pharmacodynamics . When participant stop study drug permanently reason , end treatment visit , 28-day follow-up , long term follow every 90 day occur .</detailed_description>
