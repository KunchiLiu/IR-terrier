	<brief_title>Sargramostim Myeloid Dendritic Cell Deficiency</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The overall objective project study ability sargramostim enhance mDC level function , include subsequent stimulation T cell response , various human subject demonstrate myeloid dendritic cell ( mDC ) T cell deficiency . Single center nonrandomized trial interrupted time series design involve measure blood sample three separate population administration sargramostim . The objective determine safety dose response sargramostim administration healthy participant patient chronic kidney disease ( CKD ) kidney transplant . Additionally determine whether reversal mDC/T cell deficiency sargramostim result augment T cell response three group .</detailed_description>
