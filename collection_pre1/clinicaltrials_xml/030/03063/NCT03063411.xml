	<brief_title>Testing Whether Short Training Program Designed Improve Cognitive Skills Improves 4-year-olds ' Maths Skills</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Children 's academic success across range domain related executive function skills - specifically ability maintain update information ( work memory ) suppress inappropriate response ( inhibitory control ) . These skill undergo significant development preschool year . Notably , preschool executive function skill strongly predict school readiness , well concurrent later academic achievement mathematics . The aim project test intervention specifically design improve preschooler ' executive function - crucially , achievement gap set . The study carry , follow CONSORT ( 2010 ) guideline , typically develop preschooler ( age approximately 4 year age ) . The study include child socioeconomically advantage disadvantaged family . Children randomly assign either executive function train group active control group . A nominated person external project conduct random allocation process . The random allocation do nursery ensure roughly even number group nursery . Children group complete computerized task last 15-20 minute week four week . The investigator compare trained child active control group closely match training term activity . To check improvement , investigator measure cognitive math skill baseline ( one week training ) ; one week post-training ; three month post-training ; one year post-training . These assessment conduct tester blind child 's group .</detailed_description>
