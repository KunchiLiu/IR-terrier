	<brief_title>The Effect Acute Lysine Administration α-aminoadipic Acid ( Sub-study )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The significance diabetes relate co-morbidities considerable health concern US worldwide clearly support high incidence ( estimate 9.3 % US population ) , mortality burden ( 7th lead cause death US ) , rise cost ( $ 245 billion/year ) . Strategies identify individual high diabetic risk , modulate disease process individual onset overt disease , would significant impact reduce mortality , morbidity healthcare cost . For approach successful , early marker disease predict at-risk individual onset dysregulated glycemic control require , well discover novel pathway therapeutic targeting . The purpose study investigate novel biomarker , α-aminoadipic acid ( 2-AAA ) , may influence risk diabetes . 2-AAA identified novel predictor diabetes development human , identify at-risk individual detectable glucose abnormality . 2-AAA naturally occur metabolite body , know adverse effect normal physiological level . 2-AAA generate body breakdown lysine . Lysine one twenty essential amino acid , mean essential human function , body manufacture . Thus , acquire dietary source ( meat , egg , soybean legume ) , recommend daily intake 30 mg/kg/day . Amino acid building block proteins , allow cell , organ body maintain structure function . The investigator interest whether 2-AAA increase body consumption lysine . The investigator ' specific aim determine whether acute lysine administration lead increase plasma 2-AAA human . Catabolism lysine lead generation 2-AAA . In study , investigator determine whether single dose 13C isotope label lysine lead increase plasma 2-AAA present blood urine human . In sub-study , investigator ask 2 lean , healthy subject ( preferably individual participate previous study visit ) drink beverage contain C-13 labeled lysine investigator measure level 2-AAA blood plasma urine baseline ( ingestion ) serially post-ingestion . The amount lysine subject give equivalent find 5 oz . serve beef . This sub-study allow u establish understand relationship lysine 2-AAA healthy subject , inform future study study effect 2-AAA diabetes risk .</detailed_description>
