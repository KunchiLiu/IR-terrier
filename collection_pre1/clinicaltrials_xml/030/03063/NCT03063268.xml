In response NIH RFA-OD-15-002 , study address research use clinical record data , include issue appropriate content duration inform consent patient preference research use clinical information . This study design electronic consent application intend improve patient ' satisfaction understand consent research use EHR data . The electronic application provide interactive functionality create virtual , patient-centered discussion patient research use EHR data . Also , correct potential misconception increase informedness , application present trust-enhancing message highlight fact research regulation , researcher training , data protection . This study ( Specific Aim 2 link study protocol ) compare effectiveness interactive , trust-enhanced consent application interactive consent standard consent ( interactivity , trust- enhancement ) use randomize trial three consent 600 adult network family medicine practice .

This first phase project ( IRB # :201500678 ) innovative create virtual , patient-centered discussion research use EHR data . Moreover , project produce consent application clinician researcher use phase ( Phase two ) trial ethically sound practical tool consent patient , clinical setting , research involve EHRs . Overall , study improve understand best give patient information research use health record data . With understanding , study develop new computer application patient use doctor ' office .

	<brief_title>An Interactive Patient-Centered Consent Research Using Medical Records</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This study ( Specific Aim 2 link study protocol ) compare effectiveness interactive , trust-enhanced consent application interactive consent standard consent ( interactivity , trust- enhancement ) use randomize trial three consent 600 adult network family medicine practice . Primary outcome satisfaction consent decision understand consent content . Conceptually , hypothesize effectiveness study 's new consent application rely two construct , interactivity trust . Many study identify importance trust researcher come people 's willingness participate research . Moreover , trust source information critical participant ' evaluation risk information . And , risk information important element research consent process . Thus , highlight relevant message participant outset research consent process . It expect message coerce participant dramatically alter participant ' general trust researcher . More importantly , empirically assessment expectation ensure application delivers ethically appropriate consent experience . However , expect present key fact research data protection , researcher training , research regulation increase likelihood participant willing learn research use medical record . In turn , increase participant ' understanding help make informed decision . In absence trust-related message , expect many participant simply disengage detail consent information thus make less informed decision participate . Next , investigator ' use interactivity support research effectiveness communication interactively deliver detail , empower audience , allow self - discovery process . Indeed , interactive , person-to-person consent process standard approach clinical trial . Therefore , new consent application , interface allow participant interactively explore detail important personal understanding research use EHRs relevant personal information need satisfaction consent decision . Without interactive information exploration , essentially dynamically tailored personal information need , participant likely overwhelmed volume information present unable obtain information want . Under circumstance , participant ' overall understanding consent information likely decrease , likely make less satisfactory decision . There two specific hypothesis : ( 1 ) compare standard consent , interactive consent lead increase decisional satisfaction understanding consent ; ( 2 ) compare interactive consent , interactive , trust-enhanced consent lead increase decisional satisfaction understanding consent .</detailed_description>
