	<brief_summary>This phase II trial study well pembrolizumab interferon gamma-1b work treat patient stage IB-IVB mycosis fungoides sezary syndrome come back respond previous treatment . Monoclonal antibody , pembrolizumab , may interfere ability cancer cell grow spread . Interferon gamma-1b may boost immune system activity . Giving pembrolizumab interferon gamma-1b together may work well treat patient stage IB-IVB mycosis fungoides sezary syndrome .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Pembrolizumab Interferon Gamma-1b Treating Patients With Stage IB-IVB Relapsed Refractory Mycosis Fungoides Sezary Syndrome</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To assess overall response rate ( ORR ) pembrolizumab ( MK-3475 ) interferon gamma-1b ( IFN-G ) ( Actimmune ) combination immunotherapy subject previously treat mycosis fungoides ( MF ) sezary syndrome ( SS ) . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . To explore safety/tolerability clinical activity pembrolizumab ( MK-3475 ) IFN-G ( Actimmune ) subject previously treat MF SS respect safety tolerability . II . To explore safety/tolerability clinical activity pembrolizumab ( MK-3475 ) IFN-G ( Actimmune ) subject previously treat MF SS respect time response ( TTR ) . III . To explore safety/tolerability clinical activity pembrolizumab ( MK-3475 ) IFN-G ( Actimmune ) subject previously treat MF SS respect duration response ( DOR ) . IV . To explore safety/tolerability clinical activity pembrolizumab ( MK-3475 ) IFN-G ( Actimmune ) subject previously treat MF SS respect progression-free survival ( PFS ) . V. To explore safety/tolerability clinical activity pembrolizumab ( MK-3475 ) IFN-G ( Actimmune ) subject previously treat MF SS respect event-free survival ( EFS ) . TERTIARY OBJECTIVES : I . To investigate relationship follow putative biomarkers combination immunotherapy pembrolizumab ( MK-3475 ) IFN-gamma ( Actimmune ) clinical outcome ( measure safety/tolerability ORR , DOR , PFS , EFS ) subject previously treat MF/SS , include tumor/microenvironment ( PD-1/PD-L1/PD-L2 expression , cytotoxic T lymphocyte [ CTL ] , regulatory T cell [ Treg ] , macrophage , dendritic cell [ DC ] ; nanostring gene expression profile ) , systemic immune response ( flow cytometry , mass cytometry [ CyTOF ] , Luminex multiplexed cytokine profile ) , molecular/genomic immune correlate ( exome sequencing , high throughput sequence [ HTS ] T cell receptor [ TCR ] ) . OUTLINE : Patients receive pembrolizumab intravenously ( IV ) 30 minute day 1 . Courses repeat every 3 week 2 year absence disease progression unexpected toxicity . Patients also receive interferon gamma-1b subcutaneously ( SC ) 3 time per week 12 week , follow 3 week 3 week schedule 2 year absence disease progression unexpected toxicity . After completion study treatment , patient follow 30 day every 12 week .</detailed_description>
