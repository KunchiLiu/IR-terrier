	<detailed_description>Background rationale study : Type 1 Diabetes , Hypoglycaemia , IAH Islet Transplantation Type 1 diabetes cause autoimmune destruction beta cell within islet pancreas . Those Type 1 diabetes dependent daily insulin replacement survival despite major advance treatment ( 3 ) , life-expectancy reduce significantly due metabolic crisis increase risk major atherosclerotic vascular event ( 4 ) . All complication chronic high glucose prevent tight glycaemic control ( 5 ) , however , counter-balanced high risk severe hypoglycaemia lead reduce ability perceive onset hypoglycaemia , disable confusion collapse without warn , term Impaired A Awareness Hypoglycaemia ( AIH ) . IAH affect 25 % people establish Type 1 diabetes every year ( 10-15 million people world-wide ) ( 6 , 7 ) . Approximately 30,000 people Scotland Type 1 diabetes prevalence increase ( 8 ) . Those recurrent hypoglycaemia severe IAH , often experience fluctuation blood glucose may eligible islet transplantation ( 5 ) . Islets transplant high number via portal vein radiological guidance liver glucocorticoid free immunosuppression ( `` Edmonton protocol '' ) . Two transplant usually necessary regain insulin secretion allow adequate control glucose concentration restore awareness hypoglycaemia . UK Islet Transplant Consortium ( UKITC ) , Scottish National Islet Programme anthropometric change post islet transplantation Our transplant programme one seven UKITC ; site include Newcastle , Oxford , London ( Kings , Royal Free ) , Manchester Bristol . The primary goal UK reduce frequency restore awareness hypoglycaemia . Referred patient assess depth multidisciplinary team pre-transplant , time transplant serially post-transplant . In UK April 2008-September 2013 96 transplant 76 recipient . Graft survival &gt; 88 % , define stimulate c-peptide &gt; 100pmol/L ( 90 min follow Fortisip meal ) , significant decrease frequency hypoglycaemia : pre- vs. post-transplant , median ( interquartile range ) : 21 ( 7-79 ) vs. 0 ( 0-1 ) episodes hypoglycaemia per annum significant reduction HbA1c insulin dose ( p &lt; 0.01 ) ( 9 ) . Body weight 1 year UKITC cohort significantly diminish ; pre-transplant : mean ( ±SEM ) 66.3 ( ±1.2 ) vs. 62.3 ( ±1.1 ) kg ( p=0.001 ) . In common many programme ( 10 ) peak function see 3 month follow first transplant often insulin independence variable degree attrition function may see follow many patient insulin 1 year follow transplant , although much reduce dose versus pre-transplant . In Scotland perform 47 transplant 29 recipient . Those patient Type 1 diabetes normal renal function assess previously ( ≥3 &lt; 30 month ) post-transplant ( n=14 ; 6 male , 8 female ; age ( range : 30-57 year ) ; function graft . Following islet transplantation observe significant reduction body weight , pre versus post-transplant : median ( interquartile range ) 70.9 ( 64.9-82.5 ) vs. 66.0 ( 59.8-79.9 ) kg , p=0.01 ; BMI : 26.2 ( 24.4-28.6 ) vs. 24.5 ( 22.2-26.1 ) kg/m2 , p=0.01 ; % fat mass : 30.0 ( 21.2-35.2 ) vs. 24.1 ( 18.4-31.2 ) % , p=0.004 ; waist circumference : 85.5 ( 77-89.7 ) vs. 77.5 ( 73.5-88.3 ) cm , p=0.01 . Total calorific intake assess via 7 day dietary history different pre- versus post-transplant 1700 ( 1581-1842 ) vs. 1528 ( 1319-1708 ) kcal , ( p=0.09 ) , although frequency hypoglycaemia ( 10 ( 6-18 ) v 1 ( 0-3 ) ) episode per week calorific intake hypoglycaemia reduce . Concurrently HbA1c improve p &lt; 0.001 ( 11 ) . Consistent observation , significant reduction body weight &gt; 4kg ( 10 , 12 ) , waist circumference body fat mass , latter measure use bioelectrical impedence , within year islet transplantation , previously report , despite significant change caloric intake post-transplant ( 12 ) . In latter study 30 subject assessment complete 12 subject insulin time last data collection . Insulin use reduce 10 fold glycaemic control improve . Regression analyse adjust confound variable include exogenous insulin dose glucagon-like peptide-1 agonist use , confirm association weight loss islet transplantation . Of note cohort islet transplant recipient , measurement energy expenditure make patient include islet transplant follow kidney transplant variety immunosuppressant agent may affect energy balance . More recently group publish retrospective study islet transplant recipient find decrease BMI cohort 33 recipient 3 year post-transplant versus pre-transplant ( 13 ) . Dietetic habit caloric intake activity , assess open end questionnaire , significantly alter pre- versus post-transplant . We hypothesise component energy expenditure increase follow islet transplantation secondary diminish ratio systemic portal insulin concentration . The energy expenditure component may modulate way include REE PPT . Our propose study aim prospectively assess energy intake food choice use `` gold standard '' serial 7 day weigh food diary ( 14 , 15 ) ass multiple component energy expenditure pre- post-islet transplantation versus subject commence insulin pump therapy relatively high ratio systemic portal insulin concentration along control subject normal glucose tolerance . Maintenance body weight relationship energy intake energy expenditure Bodyweight reflect balance food intake energy expenditure . Total energy expenditure may separate three main component : REE , PPT physical activity . REE may define energy expenditure rest fast state measure thermoneutral environment . PPT diet induce thermogenesis increase metabolic rate REE ; PPT demonstrate variability people REE ( 16 , 17 ) . It energy generate follow food ingestion obligatory component reflect energy require digest , absorb , interconvert store fuel facultative component sympathetic nervous system major role ( 17 ) . The increment energy expenditure may account part cost glucose storage glycogen often measure cost glucose storage much high increment `` obligatory component '' term `` facultative thermogenesis '' ( 18 ) . This facultative component compromise 50 % thermic effect food large inter individual variation may present ( 19 , 20 ) . With sedentary lifestyle , REE constitute 75 80 % , PPT 10 15 % physical activity 10 15 % total daily energy expenditure . Modulators energy expenditure The lean body mass , thyroid status protein turnover subject determines REE ( 21 ) . We others show PPT negatively related insulin sensitivity group risk Type 2 diabetes ( 22 ) . PPT may affect beta-adrenergic blockade drug ( 23 , 24 ) . Insulin , know vasodilator , may also affect energy expenditure ( 25 ) . Intraportally transplanted islet may become revascularised tributary portal vein hepatic artery ( 26 ) perhaps tributaries hepatic artery ( 27 ) . It untested PPT increase consequence islet transplantation secondary increase insulin concentration portal splanchnic circulation ( 28 ) . There much progress induction agent immunosuppression therapy use last 10 year improve insulin independence rate ( 29 ) . Our centre use monoclonal antibody alemtuzumab induction ( 30 ) maintenance immunosuppression calcineurin inhibitor tacrolimus mycophenolate . Liver transplant patient tacrolimus diminished REE , suggest inhibition mitochondrial respiration ( 31 ) although liver transplantation hepatic denervation occur autonomic nerve dysfunction may also decrease energy expenditure ( 32 , 33 ) . It unlikely therefore immunosuppressive therapy increase energy expenditure although may certainly negative effect appetite energy intake ( 34 ) . Hepatic fatty acid oxidation . Free Fatty Acids ( FFA ) oxidise within mitochondrion present within whole body large concentration liver , muscle heart . Most methodology measure whole body fatty acid oxidation rate distinguish source . Hepatic fat oxidation may alter follow islet transplantation may influence hepatic insulin sensitivity . It know whether hepatic fat oxidation increase follow islet transplantation may explain weight loss . Assessment mitochondrial fatty acid oxidation liver : The assessment hepatic mitochondrial function hamper invasive complex technique , general lack specificity . Recently , breath test use stable carbon isotope propose safe , non-invasive non-radioactive method ass mitochondrial oxidative capacity . Sodium13C-octanoate employed substrate use assess hepatic mitochondrial oxidative function , particularly , β-oxidative pathway . Sodium octanoate medium chain fatty acid , metabolise mitochondrial β-oxidation , produce acetyl Coenzyme A ( acetyl Co-A ) . Acetyl Co-A enters Krebs cycle undergo oxidation lead production CO2 measure breath test ( 35a ) . The purpose proposal understand mechanism weight loss fat mass observe . No study examine energy expenditure prospectively detailed way cohort pre- post-islet transplant insulin pump therapy recipient . Detailed plan investigation : Hypothesis : Islet transplantation associate increase energy expenditure consequence reduction ratio systemic portal insulin concentration . The aims ass : 1 . Anthropometric measure : body weight , waist circumference , skin fold thickness , body composition use air displacement plethysmography ( Bod Pod ) . 2 . Total energy intake , include excess energy intake require treatment hypoglycaemia , use 7 day weigh food diary , The Fear Hypoglycaemia Survey , Gold Clarke Score . 3 . The activity component energy expenditure use accelerometry . 4 . REE PPT ( use meal tolerance test ) total metabolic rate ( TMR ) use doubly labelled water . 5 . Hepatic fat oxidation use Sodium 13C octanoate . 6 . Liver fat , abdominal subcutaneous visceral fat use MRS MRI . In islet transplant recipient insulin pump patient MRS liver MRI liver fat ; abdominal subcutaneous visceral fat ; glycaemic lability ; frequency hypoglycaemia assess use continuous glucose monitoring system ( CGMS ) ; awareness hypoglycaemia assess subjectively Gold Score Clarke Scores ( 35 ) , mixed meal tolerance test continue per UKITC protocol , include pre-transplantation . In glucose tolerant control do except MR image study , Fear Hypoglycaemia Survey ( 36 ) , Gold Clarke score CGMS . STUDY DESIGN In islet transplant programme recipient assess pre-transplant 1 , 3 , 6 , 12 month post-transplant 6 monthly . The investigation transplant insulin pump subject , base around timeline . Specifically , anticipate peak islet function 3 month . We aim recruit 3 group participant : Type I diabetes wait list islet transplantation , Type I diabetes wait list insulin pump therapy , control diabetes ( glucose tolerant ) . The study contain 3 part describe . The participant expect complete 3 part time point . The 3 part complete 5 separate time point total 13 visit : The follow visit patient type 1 diabetes : Pre- intervention 1,3 , 6 12 month post intervention . - Pre-intervention 3 study visit 4 week period - Month 1 post intervention 2 visit 2 week - Months 3 post invention 3 visit 4 week period - Month 6 post intervention 2 visit 2 week - 12 month post intervention 3 visit 4 week Patients diabetes normally 1 routine clinic visit time point describe part normal follow-up post-intervention . The visit surplus usual follow-up follow intervention , apart first month post-intervention would followed-up weekly . Glucose-tolerant control one set examination carry involve 3 visit 4 week . Pre-intervention , 3 &amp; 12 month Part 1 : Blood test ( FBC , LFTS , U &amp; Es , Coagulation Screen , Lipid Profile , Thyroid function , HbA1c , Glucose , post-transplant Tacrolimus level ) approx 18ml ( 3 ½ teaspoon ) . This part routine follow-up islet transplant patient . Anthropometry -body weight , waist , calf arm circumference , skin fold thickness ( include bicep , tricep , scapula , illiac crest calf ) , body composition use air displacement plethysmography ( BODPOD ) . These examination study specific part routine follow-up . A continuous glucose monitoring ( CGMS ) device accelerometer also fit measure energy expenditure seven day . The participant give food diary set weigh scale record food intake seven day period ( include excess calorie require treatment hypoglycaemia ) home . CGMS frequently use follow-up patient diabetes . Glucose tolerant control CGMS fit complete follow survey . The participant complete `` The Fear Hypoglycaemia Survey '' . This questionnaire ask how/whether modify behaviour order avoid hypoglycaemia frequently worry hypoglycaemia different circumstance . The participant also ask degree impaired awareness hypoglycaemia use specific score system ( Gold Clarke Score ) . Subjects within islet transplant cohort pump therapy cohort ask go clinical research image centre magnetic resonance scan do abdomen include liver abdominal fat . Part 2 ( week 2 ) : The participant invite back week later assess rest energy expenditure ( REE ) . At visit equipment week 1 return . The participant weigh arrival cannula insert arm . Blood sample glucose , insulin c-peptide take ( 15mls ) . The participant give `` mixed meal '' form `` Fortisip concentrate '' taste like milk shake . Their energy expenditure mixed meal measure two hour device call indirect calorimeter open hood ventilation device measure amount oxygen breathe amount carbon dioxide breathe . The energy expend meal call post-prandial thermogenesis ( PPT ) represent calorie burnt meal . Simultaneously blood sample take every 30 minute three hour measure insulin , c-peptide glucose level ( 150 ml ) . This gold standard test assess islet function . `` Doubly-labelled Water '' study carry proportion participant . The participant give `` doubly labelled water '' drink second visit , urine sample collect prior drinking water instruct collect urine sample home day 1 , 5 , 10 14 following , research nurse call regularly time period . The sample store freezer zip lock bag contain plastic tub tight-fitting lid . Part 3 ( week 4 ) : The participant invite back two week part 2 study specific visit . The urine sample collect . Hepatic Mitochondrial study carry involves participant drink solution contain Sodium 13C Octanoate fatty acid find food . They ask blow bag intermittently period two hour ( 0 , 10 , 15 , 20 , 25 , 30 , 40 , 60 , 90 120 min ) order measure liver handle fatty acid whether `` burn '' quickly slowly . 1 month 6 month post intervention Only blood test , anthropometry , accelerometer , weigh food diary CGMS carry .
