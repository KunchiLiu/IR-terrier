	<brief_summary>The primary objective pilot study evaluate safety low dose Entolimod normal , healthy , non-patient normal . This clinical trial 40 normal human compare single dose 4 ug Td ( 2 ug TT 2 ug diphtheria toxoid + 3000 ug alum without entolimod . Subjects randomize : Td alone ( n=15 ) Td+ entolimod ( n=25 ) . The investigator expect Td + entolimod double anti-TT anti-diphtheria AB level Td alone .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>This single-blind ( participant blind ) , pilot study therapeutic diagnostic intent limited drug exposure . The study conduct Baylor College Medicine Michael E Debakey VA Medical Center normal , healthy , non-drug use male volunteer receive Td vaccination past 5 year . The purpose study evaluate safety surrogate efficacy low dose entolimod normal , healthy , non-patient subject compare anti-tetanus ( TT ) antibody level patient get entolimod v entolimod combine tetanus-diphtheria ( Td ) vaccine . Subjects randomly assign one two arm 3:5 ratio ( every 8 subject , 3 randomly assign control group 5 treatment group ) receive single dose : Arm 1 : Td ( 4 ug ) ( n=15 ) , Arm 2 : Td ( 4 ug ) + Entolimod ( 1 ug ) ( n=25 ) We propose give normal dose Td give routinely human ( i.e . TT 2μg diphtheria toxoid 2 ug ) total protein dose 4 ug . The propose dose entolimod 1 ug 30-40 time lesser previously give safely human . We expect Td + entolimod double anti-tetanus toxoid antibody ( anti-TT AB ) anti-diphtheria AB level Td alone . We predict low dosing entolimod ( 1μg ) produce difference adverse effect give Td vaccine alone adverse event different typical report Physicians ' Desk Reference Td vaccine human . For purpose trial , study population age cut-off 40 year age . The reason cut-off body produce high antibody level response vaccine young age group compare old group . Further , study restrict male safety measure woman child-bearing age expose entolimod , give woman childbearing potential . We consider strategy adequate human safety several reason relate risk new combination exist vaccine new adjuvant . First , propose Td-Entolimod start dose usual approve clinical dose Td ( 4 μg contain 2 ug TT + 2 ug diphtheria toxoid ) . Second , propose dose adjuvant entolimod ( 1 μg ) support animal toxicology study human safety/PK/PD study cross-referenced IND 100480 . The result safety study , give human 30 μg animal 100μg , strongly support entolimod 1μg safe human dose . The adjuvant aluminum phosphate , contain within standard Td vaccine human . Third , support safety come recent recommendation boost pregnant woman Td pregnancy regardless whether recently receive Td shot . This recommendation acceptable enough safety ACIP recommend pregnant woman , support study 's single dosing Td even less 5 year interval would relatively low risk . Fourth , FDA approve conjugate vaccine use TT contain 8 10 time great dos TT plan dose . Fifth , randomization 25 subject Td-Entolimod combination vaccine , provide sufficient number subject detect common adverse event fever local site reaction one human subject vaccinate group compare Td alone control group . Local injection site systemic inflammatory change also monitor planned clinical study trial later TT conjugate anti-addiction vaccine . The close monitoring objective subjective drug effect direct observation , blood work ( CBC Comprehensive Metabolic Panel ) , weekly telephone check-in 6 week period point vaccination close-out visit monitor potential adverse reaction , close-out physical allow objective evaluation effect vaccine normal subject . 6-weeks post-vaccination , analyze level anti-TT AB anti-diphtheria AB compare study arm compare baseline AB level determine immune potentiating capability entolimod . In addition expect difference adverse event ( AE ) give Td alone compare AE list Physicians ' Desk Reference Td normal , also expect AB level 6 week post vaccination ratio 6-week baseline AB level Td+entolimod ( n=25 ) least double level Td alone ( n=15 ) .</detailed_description>
