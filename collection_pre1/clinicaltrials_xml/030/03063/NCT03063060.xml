	<brief_title>The Impact Vitamin D Deficiency Hypocalcaemia Following Total Thyroidectomy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Background Post-operative hypocalcaemia follow total thyroidectomy well-known complication become major area research . Many factor assume increase incidence post-thyroidectomy hypocalcaemia , impact vitamin D deficiency remain uncertain . Vitamin D deficiency know one common medical condition world.. Serum calcium mainly regulate parathyroid hormone ( PTH ) vitamin D , therefore demonstration correlation preoperative vitamin D level occurrence post thyroidectomy hypocalcaemia may reveal easily correctable factor . Recently , study investigate whether preoperative vitamin D level effect post thyroidectomy hypocalcaemia . Some show patient vitamin D deficiency likely develop postoperative hypocalcaemia . In addition significant decrease postoperative hypocalcemia show patient receive supplementation vitamin D regardless vitamin D status , others find relationship preoperative vitamin D concentration postoperative hypocalcaemia . Since result far inconclusive , goal study significantly determine relation two factor . This study first deal issue patient underwent total thyroidectomy perform surgeon surgical technique . Study objective 1 . To identify correlation pre-operative vitamin D deficiency occurrence hypocalcaemia follow total thyroidectomy . 2 . To determine wether correction vitamin D level prior surgery able prevent post surgery hypocalcaemia . Study design A retrospective evaluation study patient underwent total thyroidectomy head neck unit Otorhinolaryngology department institution January 2013 October 2016 . A total number 60 patient underwent total thyroidectomy available vitamin D level surgery , well pre post-operative PTH calcium level . Pre-operative vitamin D PTH level check within maximum one month duration surgery . All patient operate surgeon -Dr. Galit Avior- , surgical technique . Methods : The study involve access patient file admission report . In addition investigator would like able call patient order ask whether Vitamin D deficiency correct surgery , If correct exactly .</detailed_description>
