	<brief_summary>Liver cancer include primary hepatocellular carcinoma ( HCC ) metastatic liver cancer one common malignancy world . Over 10000 new case per year diagnose Taiwan . Despite many treatment option , prognosis HCC remain dismal . More 8000 people die cancer every year Taiwan . A majority ( 70 % 85 % ) patient present advance unresectable disease . In contrast , small liver cancer cure appreciable frequency . Five-year disease-free survival exceed 50 % report surgical resection , inoperable patient vascular invasion extrahepatic spread . Radiofrequency ablation ( RFA ) recommend alternative curative therapy . However , main drawback RFA limitation tumor size location . The tumor large 5 cm diameter locate adjacent vessel , could ablate completely sometimes . Microwave ablation ( MWA ) ablate tumor high temperature RFA , suppose diminish adjacent vessel .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Microwave Ablation Treatment Malignant Liver Tumors Closed Intrahepatic Vessels</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Several pre-clinical study already demonstrate microwave ablation ( MWA ) safe effective treatment live cancer . The system ( Emprint Microwave Ablation system ) 2.45 GHz microwave generator investigator use approve safe European Union ( EU ) 2009 receive Food Drug Administration ( FDA ) approval 2014 . However , still experience use MWA tumor ablation Taiwan . In study , perform MWA 40 inoperable patient liver cancer adjacent vessel suitable receive radiofrequency ablation ( RFA ) hospital . The investigator evaluate potential side effect ablate effect tumor abdominal compute tomography ( CT ) magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) , investigator also follow-up patient 1 year evaluate overall survival local recurrence rate . The investigator appraisal clinical feasibility advantage system study .</detailed_description>
