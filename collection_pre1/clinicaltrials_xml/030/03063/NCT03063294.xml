	<brief_summary>The Coordination Toolkit Coaching ( CTAC ) project aim disseminate strategy coordination care high-risk Veterans via online toolkit , evaluate benefit add distance-coaching strategy assist site deploy toolkit 's tool . The project 's focus care coordination across outpatient setting . This multi-site project provide : 1 ) An online toolkit support well care coordination vulnerable patient visit primary care , 2 ) Random assignment participate clinic either toolkit combine toolkit/distance coaching strategy , 3 ) A quality improvement approach `` plan-do-study-act '' cycle improvement , design support clinic locally initiated effort . The project recruit clinic goal improve Veteran experience care ( measure survey call Hassles Scale ) , communication coordination primary care provider specialist , use acute care service .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Background : High-risk Veterans defined individual increase risk poor clinical outcome higher use unplanned health service relative non-high-risk counterpart . These Veterans typically multiple chronic health problem vulnerable gap care due impaired physical , psychological , and/or social functioning . Despite effort integrate care VA 's Patient Aligned Care Teams ( PACT ) primary care , deficit care coordination persist . In VA , high-risk Veterans manage primary care rather specialty service . PACT expect improve care coordination create care manager role PACT teamlet nurse . However , significant challenge implement care manager role intend . Many care coordination challenge involve `` medical neighborhood '' outside PACT . To improve quality care coordination outpatient care also develop good method spread innovation , Coordination Toolkit Coaching project fund VA 's Quality Enhancement Research Initiative ( QUERI ) develop pilot online toolkit distance-based coaching process , compare effectiveness toolkit alone combination toolkit plus distance coaching improve VA patient ' experience care , communication coordination primary care provider specialist , utilization acute care service . Both toolkit combine toolkit/coaching strategy use individually VA quality improvement initiative , strategy compare individually alternative , however , investigator ' knowledge , strategy formally compare head-to-head . Additional Outcome Information : The project 's primary outcome measure patient experience , Health System Hassles Scale . This 16-item scale ask patient question whether medication refill time , whether give information refer specialist , whether poor communication different doctor clinic , whether disagreement doctor patient 's diagnosis best treatment patient . Sample Size Calculations : The sample size calculation study base simple presumption difference-in-differences analysis ( across two time point ) comparison two implementation strategy . The primary outcome Health System Hassles Scale . The investigator assume 12 clinic study ( 6 per study group ) , view cluster order evaluate sample size . Since number patient per cluster may vary , investigator assume coefficient variation cluster size 0.9 . With effect size 0.3 standard deviation ( consider small medium effect size Cohen 's terminology ) difference-in-difference analysis intra-cluster correlation 0.023 ( base preliminary evaluation prior data ) , 80 % power two-sided 5 % significance level , 149 patient per clinic need total 1788 patient ( evenly divide two group ) . Statistical Analysis Plan : The primary endpoint Health System Hassles Scale compare two implementation group ( toolkit combine toolkit/coaching ) use difference-in-differences ( two time point : baseline 12 month ) analysis adjust cluster clinic . This analysis perform initially general linear model use time point difference dependent variable study group independent variable , clinic cluster variable ( , thus , use appropriately choose variance-covariance matrix ) . A adjustment model may incorporate appropriate covariates include patient-level factor , gender , age , use non-VA care .</detailed_description>
