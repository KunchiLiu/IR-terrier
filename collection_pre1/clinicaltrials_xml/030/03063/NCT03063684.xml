	<brief_summary>The study examine effect fractional/pixel CO2 laser treatment vaginal atrophy vulvar lichen sclerosus mean histological immuno-histochemical characterization epithelial layer marker tissue age . The tissue characterization perform biopsy vaginal vulvar tissue three different point time : prior treatment , two week third last treatment , one year last treatment .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Fractional / Pixel CO2 Laser Treatment Vulvar Atrophy Lichen Sclerosus</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Many study publish recently describe use fractional/pixel CO2 laser treatment various disorder vulva vagina , atrophy due estrogen deficiency , urinary stress incontinence , skin disease ( lichen sclerosus ) . The result study investigate technology relation vaginal atrophy urinary stress incontinence show improvement symptom series 3 treatment . The proposed effect fractional CO2 laser base study perform non-genital tissue [ Daffon , Capon ] , demonstrate change connective tissue proliferation fibroblast , well formation collagen elastic fiber . The suggested explanation base theory heat shock protein involve process arise due thermal tissue damage , turn activate tissue cytokine , growth factor fibroblast . These theory prove vulvar vaginal tissue , except demonstration histologic morphologic change irradiate tissue [ Salvatore , Menopause 2015 ] , cellular mechanism action nature process mediate change uro-genital tissue yet examine . The technology know fractional CO2 use many year dermatology plastic surgery . In method , laser beam split pass lens 81 dot ( 9 x 9 pixel ) onto approximately 1 cm2 . The laser beam penetrate tissue cause minimal evaporation around spot fractionate beams release heat desire tissue depth . The method energy transfer tissue tiny dot lead creation various thermal effect focus beam , around focus , area heat foci . Following tissue irradiation , different process occur : epithelial cell proliferation thicken epithelial layer , migration proliferation endothelial cell , creation neo-vasculature lamina propria , creation collagen elastic fiber , accumulation glycogen cell [ Salvatore , Menopause 2015 ] . The result process improved tissue elasticity plasticity well regeneration epidermis layer . Previous study demonstrate effect treatment atrophic vagina identical long-term local estrogen treatment , improve cytological index , improve lubrication , alteration vaginal flora , reduce acidity level `` estrogenic '' level ( approx . pH 4 -4.5 ) [ Salvatore , Menopause , 2015 ; Perino ; Gasper ; Salvatore , Climacteric , 2015 ] . Considering multitude recently publish article present impressive clinical result , investigator decide examine effect treatment fractional CO2 laser vaginal vulvar tissue cellular level two condition : vaginal atrophy due estrogen deficiency lichen sclerosus . These two condition choose due magnitude recent publication deal clinical histological improvement two pathological condition follow laser treatment . Understanding cytological process enable foundation knowledge basic mechanism action , propose method improve current therapeutic protocol . It also enable observation duration treatment effect , assessment whether change associate undesired event , increase risk malignant tissue transformation . Patients The investigator intend recruit 10 woman group ( 10 woman atrophy 10 lichen sclerosus ) . Considering availability efficient safe medical treatment , woman diagnose lichen sclerosus vaginal atrophy treat medical preparation satisfaction . Therefore , investigator recruit follow type patient trial : woman low compliance medical treatment , woman develop intolerance treatment ( chronic candida vulvovaginitis long-term estrogen treatment , hypersensitivity reaction steroid ointment estrogen preparation , drug allergy ) woman partial response treatment , satisfactory therapeutic alternative . The study include 6 appointment : T0-recruitment : ascertain eligibility , sign inform consent form , complete questionnaire include epidemiologic clinical detail , gynecological examination , cytological smear ( maturation index ) , determination acidity level vaginal secretion ( pH ) , determination vaginal health index score [ Bachmann ] . A punch biopsy take mid-third vagina ( vaginal atrophy ) vulva ( lichen sclerosus ) . T1-Visit 2 ( 2-4 week recruitment ) The treatment protocol include series three laser treatment , 4-6 week apart . The first laser treatment perform Visit 2 . In vagina , treatment perform special vaginal transducer enable 360° treatment ; irradiation vagina perform adjacent `` square '' along entire vaginal circumference , turn handle slowly withdraw transducer vaginal canal . The duration treatment 5-7 minute . The vaginal treatment associate pain . The treatment introitus perform transducer enable treatment around 360° name FemiLift . The treatment perform fractional micro-ablative CO2 laser system manufacture Alma Laser accordance accept protocol ( laser mode : pulse , energy : 40-80 mj/pulse ) . For lichen sclerosus , handgrip FemiLift transducer use , transmit `` pixel print '' directly 90° angle . Since vulvar skin pain sensitive , treated prior laser application , EMLA anesthetic cream . The duration treatment 3-7 minute perform device energy level 20-60 mj/pulse . During Visit 3 ( T2 ) Visit 4 ( T3 ) , identical treatment describe perform . In framework study , follow-up procedure perform : 1 . Biopsy - three biopsy take lateral mid-third vagina : prior treatment ( T0 ) , two week third final treatment ( T4 ) one year completion treatment series ( T5 ) . The biopsy punch biopsy 5 mm diameter . The biopsy perform local anesthesia 2 % lidocaine . 2 . In course follow-up examination ( T 0 - 5 ) , follow perform ( In vaginal atrophy ) : - Gynecological examination speculum - Smear take mid-third vagina cotton tip applicator , use cytological smear determine acidity level vaginal secretion . - The vaginal health index score determine , include evaluation 5 parameter : elasticity , pH , integrity epithelium , moisture fluid volume . Each parameter score scale 1 5 , total score lower 15 , vagina consider atrophic [ Bachmann ] . - The patient request grade symptom ( dryness , itching , burning , discomfort , dyspareunia , dysuria ) VAS ( visual analog scale ) `` disturb '' `` disturb '' limit . - The patient request grade extent satisfaction treatment result ( satisfied . satisfied , sure , satisfied , unsatisfied ) . - The patient request report side effect . In lichen sclerosus patient : - External examination vulva photograph result follow-up . The biopsy send Institute Pathology Hadassah Hospital , follow examination perform : 1 . Routine hematoxylin-eosin staining . 2 . Immunohistochemistry stain P16 protein . 3 . Immunohistochemistry stain KI-67 protein . 4 . Immunohistochemistry stain p63 protein , \ . 5 . Staining alpha beta estrogen receptor progesterone receptor .</detailed_description>
