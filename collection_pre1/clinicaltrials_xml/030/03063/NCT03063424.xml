	<brief_summary>The diagnosis exercise-induced bronchospasm ( EIB ) difficult . The metacholine challenge test enough specific diagnosis EIB . The exercise challenge test cycle ergometer often use diagnose condition . This test high specificity , enough sensibility ventilation achieve test often big enough induce bronchospasm , especially trained athlete . Eucapnic voluntary hyperventilation ( EVH ) recommend test Olympic National committee establish diagnosis EIB , study compare sensibility specificity cycle ergometer challenge test isocapnic hyperventilation establish population asthmatic . The investigator assume sensitivity specificity EVH high cycle ergometer diagnosis EIB population asthmatic symptoms suggestive bronchospasm exertion . In population asthmatic exercise symptom , sensitivity specificity EVH exercise challenge cycle ergometer diagnosis EIB ?</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Inclusion Criteria group `` exerciseinduced bronchospasm '' : The subject must diagnosis asthma accord 2010 Canadian Thoracic Society consensus criterion since one year . The subject average expiratory volume per second ( FEV1 ) ≥ 80 % predict value ( post bronchodilatation ) time initial visit . The subject must positive methacholine test first visit study demonstrate presence bronchial hyperreactivity . The subject must asthma control defined 2010 Canadian Thoracic Society consensus , obvious exception limitation related physical activity . The subject must questionnaire significant symptom exerciseinduced bronchospasm 6 month . Inclusion Criteria group `` healthy '' : The subject positive history eczema , urticaria allergic rhinitis life . The subject FEV1 ≥ 80 % predict value FEV1 / FVC ( Forced vital capacity ) ratio ≥70 % time initial visit . The subject negative methacholine test first visit study . The subject exhibit symptom consider clinically compatible EIB diagnosis . Pregnant breastfeed woman . The subject suffer clinically significant concomitant disease may compromise course study . The subject take per o intravenously steroids 8 week prior study . The subject experience significant symptom respiratory tract infection ( viral bacterial ) 8 week prior study . The subject must participate another study month precede date enrollment study . The subject smoke within last 6 month . Exclusion criterion study : The subject n't show 3 visit n't complete require exams . The subject develop respiratory tract infection , acute exacerbation asthma condition compromise participation require examination . The subject pretest FEV1 le 80 % .</criteria>
