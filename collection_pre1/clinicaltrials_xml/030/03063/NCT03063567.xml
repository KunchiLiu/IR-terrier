	<brief_summary>Obstructive sleep apnea ( OSA ) prevalent disease , one associate significant negative impact long-term survival . There convince evidence treatment OSA improve outcome patient cardiovascular disease , improve blood pressure blood glucose control , improve overall metabolic syndrome . Treatment usually continuous positive airway pressure ( CPAP ) . However , many patient face problem CPAP interface , affect compliance response treatment . Proper mask fit important decrease air leak increase comfort , thus lead good compliance . Currently , choice interface depend mainly experience sleep disorder unit ( SDU ) technician . Unsuitable choice interface affect response treatment also increase medical cost interface need replace well fitting one . It thus important develop selection criterion objectively guide SDU technician choose suitable interface . The objective study study facial profile patient look predictive index use objectively guide choice appropriate interface . Frontal side profile photograph patient take facial measurement record . Patients give one monthly trial 3 interface ( nasal mask , oronasal mask , nasal cushion ) randomise order . The patient ' subjective perception interface assess patient nominate prefer interface end trial . The amount leak hour adherence type interface also analyse . A multinomial logistic regression analysis do look facial measurement predict interface patient satisfy . Hypothesis That measurement facial structure clinical feature able predict best-fit CPAP interface patient . Study Objective - To determine anthropometric facial measurement clinical factor important achieve good interface fit patient - To derive prediction rule equation able accurately predict interface patient prescribe</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>This clinical research prospective crossover trial frontal side facial profile photograph patient take facial measurement record include height width face nose . Body Mass Index ( BMI ) , Apnea Hypopnea Index ( AHI ) Epworth Sleepiness Score ( ESS ) record . Baseline symptom mouth breathe nasal congestion also assess . Patients undergo quick 5minute trial interface CPAP set 6cm H2O give feedback prefer interface satisfaction interface ( Visual analogue scale ) end quick trial . Patients give one month trial 3 interface ( nasal mask , oronasal mask , nasal cushion ) randomise order . For purpose standardisation avoid confounders , humidification auto-titrating CPAP ( autoPAP ) mode ventilation use patient . The brand interface CPAP device use also standardise . This standardised CPAP treatment provide free charge patient duration study ( 3 month ) . The patient ' subjective perception interface assess visual analogue scale assess level satisfaction . Patients nominate prefer interface end trial . The amount leak hour adherence CPAP type interface also analyse download data CPAP device . A multinomial logistic regression analysis do look facial measurement factor predict interface patient satisfy .</detailed_description>
