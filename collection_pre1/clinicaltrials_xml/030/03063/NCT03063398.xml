	<detailed_description>This study propose comprehensive prospective assessment exocrine pancreatic insufficiency ( EPI ) , nutritional status , quality life ( QOL ) early re-feeding phase , 3 month , 12 month follow AP attack . A blood sample collect measurement nutritional marker fecal sample elastase-1 , data regard demographic , etiology , history previous pancreatitis episode , hospital course ( imaging finding , intervention , length stay , intensive care admission , severity base Revised Atlanta Classification ) obtain medical record hospital discharge . Subsequently , subject prospectively follow 3 month 1 year hospital discharge . In follow-up , he/she ask answer questionnaire focusing symptom exocrine pancreatic insufficiency quality life . Furthermore , blood stool sample collect 3 12-month follow measurement nutritional marker fecal elastase-1 level . Based available literature data , hypothesize significant fraction AP patient develop EPI may persist 1 year discharge , result nutritional deficiency impair QOL . This study help clarify incidence , natural history duration EPI , well identify subgroup patient high risk EPI AP . It serve basis design future randomize control trial pancreatic enzyme replacement follow AP . This novel proposal investigator extensive experience well-established record AP research internationally know pancreas center excellence . The methodological strength proposal lie prospective nature , 1-year follow serial assessment EPI , nutritional status QOL , detail phenotypical characterization AP patient cohort . Primary endpoint - Measure incidence exocrine pancreatic insufficiency 12 month attack AP . Secondary endpoint - Identify subgroups patient risk EPI 12 month attack AP base severity classification , etiology , demographic . - Measure incidence transient ( present 3 12 month ) persistent ( present 3 12 month AP ) exocrine pancreatic insufficiency follow AP attack . - Measure incidence nutritional deficiency , impaired quality life 3 12 month attack AP . - Assess whether EPI associate nutritional deficiency impair quality life 3 12 month AP attack .</detailed_description>
