	<brief_summary>The UK high incidence mesothelioma . The incidence rise 497 % since late 1970 's increase worldwide due continue mining use asbestos . For patient mesothelioma relapse take pemetrexed cisplatin , currently standard treatment , make urgent unmet need . Recent trial area find effective treatment improve overall survival . Following debate House Lords , national survey assess research priority mesothelioma find 'exploiting potential immunotherapy ' top priority . This trial design response survey . It use immunotherapy agent nivolumab block program cell death 1 ( PD-1 ) receptor activate T-cells ( type white blood cell form part immune system ) . Early research find dependency mesothelioma PD-1 checkpoint . By attach PD-1 , nivolumab block action ( checkpoint inhibition ) , prevent turn T-cell , therefore allow immune system work . PD-1 checkpoint inhibition revolutionise treatment melanoma hop effective mesothelioma . This trial randomise , double blind placebo control trial patient mesothelioma third relapse follow platinum base chemotherapy treatment . Patients randomise 2:1 ratio ( nivolumab : placebo ) . 336 patient recruit 25 UK centre four-year period last patient minimum 6 month follow . All patient treatment 12 month unless progress withdrawal prior . Clinic visit occur every 12 week , mirror standard care . Data follow progression obtain NHS Information Centre .</brief_summary>
