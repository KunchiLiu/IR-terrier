	<brief_title>Peripheral Internal Jugular Vein ( 'Peripheral IJ ' ) Access Patients Identified Difficult Intravenous Access</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This randomize control trial compare peripheral IJ standard care difficult access patient . 1 . Patients identified nurse difficult IV access . This determine base past history immediate experience . In word , nurse caring patient , s/he might notice patient look difficult vein IV may ask patient 'Are hard stick ? ' . On hand , nurse may fail number attempt place IV . In case , patient determine difficult access nurse option contact research assistant continue current attempt . 2 . Nurse contact research assistant . 3 . Research assistant ( RA ) determine patient care MD appropriate experience place peripheral IJ ( attend , second third year ED resident ) . 4 . RA consent patient , discuss possible continuation IV IJ catheter insertion . If patient agrees , he/she enrol study . 5 . Patient randomize . 6 . Time clock start RA nurse study member ( attend physician , second third year resident ) start procedure ( IV IJ ) . 7 . RA monitor procedure progress stop time clock access confirm study member nurse . 8 . RA survey patient regard pain procedure satisfaction . 9 . Patient chart query completion ED visit hospitalization complication . Chart query two week evaluate return visit complication . Catheters place attend physician resident ( 2nd 3rd year ) experience place ultrasound guide internal jugular central venous catheter . Because procedure identical first step place IJ Central Venous Catheter , special training need procedure . A video create view place catheter show specific standardization individual . Attempts place peripheral IJ limit two . If successful two attempt , patient return 'standard care ' treatment team decide direction ultrasound guided peripheral IV central venous line .</detailed_description>
