	<detailed_description>Metabolomics , simultaneous quantification concentration hundred thousand metabolites simultaneously biological matrix , versatile analytical technique capable accelerate biomarker-based discovery nutritional science . Recently , metabolomics apply sample collect feed study ( 1 ) epidemiologic study ( 2 ) identify dozen novel potential dietary biomarkers . Several large prospective cohort study , many collaborate metabolomics consortium lead National Cancer Institute , recently apply metabolomics bank sample . This make nutrition-related biomarkers suddenly available ten thousand participant follow-up disease endpoint , enable truly large-scale nutritional biomarkers disease study .</detailed_description>
