	<detailed_description>Introduction : Upper extremity function stroke impaired characterized abnormal , stereotypical uncoordinated movement pattern . Decreased neural drive damage corticospinal system cause decreased agonist motor unit fire , spasticity , impaired motor coordination . A comprehensive understanding way brain control regulate limb-movements , spinal cord , may enhance advanced rehabilitation technique . Current concept motor control suggest brain-cortex modulates synchronize activation discrete number functional unit within brainstem spinal cord . These neural functional unit i.e . muscle synergy , linearly combine facilitate production diverse limb-movements . This control mechanism may large extent explain way CNS reduce dimensionality vast number degree freedom embed CNS discrete number muscle synergy . Therefore , execution movement may require linearly combine synergy regulate intensity activation along time domain . The existence control mechanism attract attention clinician scientist use property enhance motor recovery stroke . Therefore , study emerge investigate cortical damage impact synchronization synergy , also whether change internal structure synergy . Despite numerous study domain , lack consensus regard stroke impact control mechanism , extent correlation level impairment synergy structure . The study objective compare synergy structure MAP hand-reaching movement multiple direction post-stroke individual healthy individual , correlate property motor impairment post-stroke individual . Methods : Participants : Twelve healthy volunteer ( control group ) 20 post-stroke individual ( study group ) participate study . Inclusion criterion study group individual , age 20 , sustain unilateral cerebral stroke , hemiparesis . Exclusion criterion trial sensory aphasia , unilateral neglect presence neurological disease Parkinson 's disease Alzheimer 's disease . Equipment : The Hand-reaching Spatial Device ( HRSD ) adjustable , simple tool allow standardization hand point movement 9 different direction different participant . It compose two vertical rod attach three semi-circular shelf . Each shelf contain three movable point pin adjust left rightward accommodate variable arm length participant . The low shelf locate 10 cm table , middle locate 35 cm table high 55 cm table . For participant HRSD locate maximum hand reach distance front test shoulder . The side pin locate 45-degree angle shoulder joint side . The arrangement target HRSD design cover majority hand-reaching movement . Surface EMGs record ( Trigno 8 , Delsys , Boston , MA ) 8 muscle shoulder girdle arm : trapezius ( TRS ) ; deltoid anterior ( AD ) , medial ( MD ) , posterior fiber ( PD ) ; pectoralis major ( PECT ) ; infraspinatus ( IS ) ; biceps ( BI ) ; triceps ( TRI ) . Electrodes place accordance guideline Surface Electromyography Non-Invasive Assessment Muscles-European Community Project ( SENIAM ) [ 34 ] . Maximum voluntary contraction ( MVCs ) perform prior data collection verify correct electrode placement normalization . One-minute rest period follow MVC limit possibility fatigue . EMG signal band-pass filter ( 20-450 Hz ) , sampled 2000 Hz . Protocol : The MVC measure standard muscle test [ 35 ] . Then participant sit front table forearm rest comfortable position . The HRSD locate mention . Participants request point target 5 time accord voice prompt activate EMG software every 10 second , 45 point movement . The order point target constant participant . Data analysis EMG preprocessing Data analysis perform use Matlab ( The MathWorks , Inc. ) . EMGs demean , follow RMS calculation use overlap window 50 sample ( 25 millisecond around timepoint ) . Mean baseline EMGs trial subtract averaged data sequence reaching movement . Hence , EMG data trial , vector whose dimension 8 ( number muscle record ) , correspond active force generation beyond residual baseline muscle activity . The EMG data normalize accordance Maximal Isometric Contraction ( MVC ) muscle . The NMF algorithm originally use Lee Seung ( 1999 2001 ) , apply identify muscle synergy activation weight . An EMG pattern record hand-reaching movement model linear combination set N muscle synergy , specify relative level activation across 8 muscle , activate time-varying activation coefficient : V^ ( M×T ) ≈W^ ( M×N ) ∙H^ ( N×T ) ( 4 ) Where V EMG data set matrix M number muscle ( 8 muscle ) , T number time sample , W synergy matrix H coefficient matrix . W m×n matrix n synergy , number muscle , H n×t matrix synergy activation coefficient . Thus , column W represent weight muscle single synergy , row H represent much corresponding synergy activate used generate force . In model , possible muscle belong one synergy thus EMG single muscle might attribute simultaneous sequential activation several muscle synergy . In order determine optimal number synergy whole group , EMG data target concatenate participant . Then EMG 's whole sample concatenate apply NMF . The optimal number synergy ( ) define number synergy capture high total variance data , suggest additional synergy capture small residual amount variation attributable noise . This procedure allow u estimate optimal number synergy whole sample execute reach movement space regardless direction movement . The NMF algorithm require number synergy extract specified application algorithm . Therefore , data set , VAF calculate change number synergy 1 7 . The VAF calculate use equation : VAF ( H ) =100 % × ( 1- ( | ( |V-WH| ) |_2^2 ) / ( | ( |V| ) |_2^2 ) ) ( 6 ) Where V original matrix , W H derive , factorized matrix . Generalization movement direction The aim stage analysis establish whether set discrete number synergy exist control reach movement space . Therefore , investigated movement certain direction could account movement direction . The EMG data movement direction pool separately across 8 muscle concatenate whole sample . In way derive set synergy would account variance different subject , would also specific direction alone . The NMF apply separately movement direction accord equation : V_i≈W_i∙H_i ( 7 ) target number , correspond specific movement direction space . In stage analysis V_i ( EMG matrix ) give input target , i∈ [ 1,9 ] , matrix W_i , H_i update iteratively . The study procedure include reach 9 different target direction space , allow u investigate single set synergy could account movement direction . This do use cross-validation technique V_i matrices W_j matrix apply modified version NMF algorithm , follow correspond VAF calculation change number synergy ( ) 3 5 , 1 7 base result NMF participant target , detailed result section . In modified version algorithm , V_i W_j ( synergy matrix ) give input . Only H_ ( , j ) coefficient matrix target , updated output . The cross validation process modify NMF carry combination data matrix V_i ( target ) synergy matrix W_j ( target j ) , result 9×9 matrix H_ji . For every , j∈ [ 1,9 ] , factorize V_i W_j H_ji≈V_i . The reference set muscle synergy choose calculate VAF 9×9 factorization : VAF ( H_ij ) =100 % × ( 1- ( | ( |V_i-W_j H_ij | ) |_2^2 ) / ( | ( |V_i | ) |_2^2 ) ) ( 8 ) assume consistent high value VAF ( H_ij ) specific V_i may indicate synergy obtain movement direction may accurately explain movement direction . Thus , predefined number synergy ( ) 9×9 matrix receive cell represent accountability give synergy ( row ) specify direction ( column ) . Each row result matrix represent overall `` performance '' appropriate set synergy , row high average VAF chosen next stage analysis . Direction modulation muscle synergy Once set synergy ( W_j ) chosen , set activation coefficient every target ( H_ij , i∈ [ 9,1 ] ) , determined synergy dominant direction . For number synergy , mean activation coefficient every synergy every direction calculate . Setting number synergy 4 , example , result 9 vector ( one movement direction ) 4 value , represent 4 synergy . Then , average amplitude synergy across direction movement , movement different direction across synergy , measure .</detailed_description>
