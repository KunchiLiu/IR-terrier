	<brief_summary>The purpose study assess peak FEV1 two dos QVM149 compare fixed-dose combination salmeterol/fluticasone ( 50/500μg b.i.d . ) characterize respective 24 hour bronchodilator effect profile patient asthma . Data study complement lung function data obtain pivotal QVM149 phase 3 program assess bronchodilatory effect QVM149 multiple time-points entire dose interval 24 hour .</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Key Inclusion criterion Male female adult patient ≥ 18 year old ≤ 75 year . Patients document physician diagnosis asthma period least 12 month prior Visit 1 ( Screening ) . Patients use ICS LABA combination asthma least 1 year stable medium high dose ICS least 1 month prior Visit 1 ( Screening ) . Prebronchodilator FEV1 &lt; 80 % predict normal value screen Visit 1 ( spirometry repeat baseline prior randomization ) .
