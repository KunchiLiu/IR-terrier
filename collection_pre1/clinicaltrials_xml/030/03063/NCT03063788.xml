	<detailed_description>This study aim develop method accurately image size location HIV persistence HIV-infected individual . The project aim combine broadly neutralizing anti-HIV antibody 3BNC117 Copper-64 radio isotope use clinical trial . The clinical trial three different stage . The first stage recruit two HIV uninfected individual determine safety 3 mg/kg 3BNC117 combine Copper-64 MRI/PET scan 1 , 24 48 hour post infusion . The second stage examine distribution MRI/PET 3BNC117-Copper-64 combination four HIV-infected individual viremia receive antiretroviral therapy . The final stage perform intervention aviremic people HIV receive antiretroviral therapy .</detailed_description>
