	<brief_summary>Evidence support effectiveness ongoing opioid therapy treatment chronic non-malignant pain lacking . In fact , data suggest patient outcome improve taper opioid analgesic . To well understand role opioid therapy play experience pain , study measure pain sensitivity opioid dependent patient course 3 month follow standardized opioid taper . By isolate effect opioid taper patient without pain , preliminary evidence effect size use guide clinician treat patient chronic pain .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>The Effects Opioid Taper Opioid-Induced Hyperalgesia</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Chronic pain impact daily life fully one-third Americans age 45 , prevalence expect increase population age . In well-intended industry-driven effort provide relief chronic pain sufferer , prescription opioids increase dramatically since turn century , currently estimate 5 8 million Americans use opioids daily basis chronic pain management . Yet , prescription opioid therapy chronic pain evidence-based intervention . In fact , evaluation data accumulate , become clear outcome often poorer patient opioid therapy , improvement appreciate tapered medication . In midst `` epidemic prescription drug abuse '' critical opioid prescription practice evidence-based deliver `` best possible manner maximize effectiveness minimizes harm '' . A theorized explanation poorer outcome ( functionality , quality life ) patient opioid therapy phenomenon opioid-induced hyperalgesia ( OIH ) . Well-demonstrated animal infer patient , ongoing opioid use result increase sensitivity experimental pain , , case chronic pain patient , believe interfere ( preclude ) desire pain relief outcome . However , causal relationship opioid discontinuation OIH receive little empirical attention , clear degree opioid taper improves pain response outcomes , . Evidence support prescription opioids make pain experience bad chronic pain patient would support sea change current practice chronic opioid therapy . Studying direct effect opioid taper pain response chronic pain patient challenge ; complicate reemergence pain , variable compliance taper concomitant increase use non-opioid pain medication , control examination pain response follow opioid detoxification immediately tenable patient population . Thus , fund proof-of concept trial identify characterize direct effect opioid detoxification experimental pain response opioid-dependent patient without chronic pain establish , fact , notable effect size discern . If support , finding provide foundation upon predict efficacy patient complicate picture chronic pain . Specifically , well-characterized sample men woman seek addiction treatment residential setting , experimental pain response serially describe course three month follow standard observe opioid ( buprenorphine ) taper , compare match control patient initiate buprenorphine maintenance therapy . Pain response measure two valid reliable experimental pain induction technique commonly use measure OIH ( cold-pressor , quantitative sensory test ) , subject-level predictor response identify .</detailed_description>
