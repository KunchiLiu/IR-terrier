	<brief_summary>Retinitis Pigmentosa ( RP ) devastate eye disease present know treatment option alter rate vision loss . In series study animal model , effect expose cone periphery retina large excess oxygen result progressive oxidative damage cone photoreceptors cone cell death . Compared control patient , RP show significant reduction reduce oxidized glutathione ratio ( GSH/GSSG ) aqueous humor significant increase protein carbonyl content . This demonstration oxidative stress oxidative damage eye patient RP , suggest oxidative damage-induced cone cell death animal model RP may translate human RP support hypothesis ( 1 ) potent antioxidant promote cone survival function patient RP ( 2 ) aqueous GSH/GSSG ratio carbonyl content protein provide useful biomarkers disease activity patient population . Orally administer N-Acetylcysteine ( NAC ) find particularly effective antioxidant promotes prolong cone survival maintenance cone function mouse model RP . There good rationale test effect NAC patient RP . The first step test different dose regimen identify low dose able restore aqueous GSH/GSSG ratio reduce carbonyl adduct aqueous protein . In patient Idiopathic Pulmonary Fibrosis , polymorphism within TOLLIP gene find influence outcome NAC-treated patient . The product TOLLIP gene , toll-interacting protein , inhibitory adaptor protein downstream toll-like receptor , mediator innate adaptive immunity . The identification influence TOLLIP polymorphism effect NAC Idiopathic Pulmonary Fibrosis provide rationale collect DNA genotyping single nucleotide polymorphism ( SNPs ) current trial . In addition candidate gene genetic analysis , patient RNA collect banked future transcriptome analysis . The rationale identify gene expression change modify disease progression RP . There substantial variability rate progression among patient RP . A patient lose vision early life sibling mutation maintain vision advance age . This suggest modifier gene major impact cone survival . This study test hypothesis level expression gene product contribute antioxidant defense system may influence cone cell death hence rate loss visual field . It also possible gene expression difference may contribute difference response NAC . For reason collect RNA sample patient allow next generation sequence future understand transcriptome background study intervention perform .</brief_summary>
