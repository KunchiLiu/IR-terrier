	<brief_title>Afimoxifene Reducing Risk Breast Cancer Women With Mammographically Dense Breast</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To estimate compare percent change mammographic breast density ( use Cumulus software ) baseline month 12 woman apply 4mg afimoxifene ( 4-hydroxytamoxifen [ 4-OHT ] ) gel per breast versus placebo . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . To compare Cumulus versus ( vs. ) Volpara breast density measurement method estimate percent change mammographic breast density baseline month 12 woman apply 4mg 4-OHT gel per breast vs. placebo . II . To compare percentage woman underwent change Breast Imaging Reporting Data System ( BIRADS ) category , compare pre-and post- treatment measurement , recipient active agent versus placebo . III . To estimate percentage woman &gt; = 10 % absolute decrease quantitative mammographic density percentage baseline 12 month , compare treat group 4mg per breast 4-OHT gel placebo . IV . To describe symptom assess breast cancer prevention trial ( BCPT ) eight symptom scale ( BESS ) questionnaire laboratory toxicity assessment ( factor VIII [ F VIII ] , Von Willebrand [ vWB ] factor , sex hormone-binding globulin [ SHBG ] , lipid profile ) . V. To evaluate serum measurement 4-OHT related metabolite level factor relate tamoxifen exposure , insulin-like growth factor ( IGF ) pathway member , C-reactive protein ( CRP ) , estradiol . VI . To evaluate tissue biomarkers ( among woman undergo optional pre- post-treatment biopsy ) : terminal duct lobular unit ( TDLU ) involution ; collagen structural change ; SETER/PR index : estrogen related transcription , Ki-67 , COX-2 , p16 , CD68 . VII . To examine whether reduction mammographic density see 1 year 4-OHT vs. placebo gel application persist 24 month , one year gel application stop . OUTLINE : Patients randomize 1 2 arm . ARM A : Patients apply placebo gel topically breast daily ( QD ) 52 week . ARM B : Patients apply afimoxifene gel topically breast QD 52 week . After completion study treatment , patient follow 24 month .</detailed_description>
