	<brief_summary>This Endoscopic Ultrasound guide Biliary Drainage ( EUS-BD ) vs. Endoscopic Retrograde Cholangiopancreatography ( ERCP-TP ) trial ( BILPAL ) randomize control multicenter trial provide evidence whether traditional ERCP biliary drainage perform patient obstruction bile duct due unresectable pancreatic head periampullary tumor .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Obstructive jaundice common symptom patient periampullary cancer cancer pancreatic head . For patient unresectable tumor , palliation malignant obstructive traditionally achieve use endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography ( ERCP ) transpapillary ( TP ) stent placement . Data show ERCP equivalent surgery regard relief jaundice . Self-expandable metal stent ( SEMS ) offer prolonged palliation compare large-bore ( 10Fr ) plastic stent . However , believe gastric outlet obstruction occur commonly patient receive SEMS palliation MOJ . In addition , ERCP associate adverse event include pancreatitis , post-sphincterotomy bleeding , perforation . More recently endoscopic ultrasound ( EUS ) -guided biliary drainage describe biliary drainage patient malignant distal bile duct obstruction . Thus far used rescue approach traditional ERCP-guided transpapillary biliary drainage ERCP fail . TP failure occur result duodenal obstruction , fail cannulation , fail wire access across stricture . Potential advantage EUS-guided biliary drainage include avoidance pancreatitis post-sphincterotomy bleeding . Additionally , may result low frequency gastric outlet obstruction since stent encroach upon tumor . To compare potential advantage EUS-guided biliary drainage investigator conduct multicenter , randomize trial compare EUS-guided drainage traditional ERCP . This EUS-BD vs. ERCP-TP-trial ( BILPAL ) randomize control multicenter trial provide evidence whether traditional ERCP biliary drainage perform patient obstruction bile duct due unresectable pancreatic head periampullary tumor . This study enroll 120 subject ; 60 subject arm . Trial duration 1 year involve 5-7 visit .</detailed_description>
