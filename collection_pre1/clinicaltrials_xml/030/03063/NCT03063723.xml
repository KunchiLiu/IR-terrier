	<brief_summary>Recently , surprisingly unexpectedly increase aggressiveness high rate HCC recurrence ( 28 % ( 16/58 ) 29 % ( 17/59 ) , respectively ) report patient clear HCV DAAs achieve complete response resection local ablation within 6 month therapy . The author hypothesize rapid eradication HCV control liver inflammation would impact anti-tumoral immune control , turn might contribute neoplastic cell proliferation . Conversely , three independent prospective French cohort fail reveal increase risk HCC recurrence DAAs treatment CHC patient receive curative cancer treatments.Although impact DAAs treatment rate HCC occurrence recurrence still remain unclear , would important pay attention immunological change CHC patient treat DAAs.Up , little known immunological change chronic hepatitis C ( CHC ) patient treat direct-acting antiviral agent ( DAAs ) , try explore effect antiviral treatment CHC patient DAAs frequency monocyte , NK cell cytokine promote activation .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>15 treatment-naive CHC patient 10 healthy control recruit . Patients examine DAAs therapy ( 0w ) week 4 ( 4w ) week 12 ( 12w ) therapy . The percentage monocyte , NK cell peripheral blood analyze flow cytometry . Serum cytokines IL-12 , IL-18 , CXCL10 , CXCL11 , sCD14 sCD163 measure enzyme link immunosorbent assay .</detailed_description>
