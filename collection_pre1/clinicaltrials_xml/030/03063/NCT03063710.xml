	<brief_title>Olaparib Expanded Access Program BRCA Mutated Platinum Sensitive Relapsed High Grade Epithelial Ovarian Cancer Patients Japan</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Primary Objective : To provide expanded access olaparib tablet use maintenance monotherapy BRCA mutate platinum sensitive relapse ( PSR ) high grade epithelial ovarian cancer patient complete partial response follow platinum base chemotherapy . Secondary Objective : Safety Objective : To collect individual safety data olaparib maintenance monotherapy BRCA mutate PSR high grade epithelial ovarian cancer patient complete partial response follow platinum base chemotherapy . When number enrol patient enough ( &lt; 5 patient ) , listing safety data prepare . On hand , number sufficient ( &gt; =5 patient ) , summary safety data prepare use descriptive statistic . Target subject population Patients PSR high-grade epithelial ovarian cancer BRCA mutation ( include patient primary peritoneal / fallopian tube cancer ) . At enrollment , patient complete partial response follow completion ( minimum 4 treatment cycle ) platinum-based chemotherapy . Patients must complete least 2 previous line platinum-based therapy ( e.g. , carboplatin cisplatin ) entry study must consider platinum sensitive penultimate platinum-based chemotherapy . Platinum sensitive study define disease progression great 6 month completion ( last dose ) penultimate platinum chemotherapy . Patients must receive bevacizumab chemotherapy course immediately prior entry . Cytoreductive surgery prior end last chemotherapy regimen allow long completed end chemotherapy regimen . Patients know BRCA mutation/s germline ( i.e. , blood ) tumour specimen , prior provision inform consent enter study base result . The result must make available AstraZeneca . Patients BRCA mutation identify enter study provide test undertaken appropriately accredited laboratory . Duration treatment Patients may continue receive study treatment disease progression assess investigator accord local standard clinical practice discontinuation criterion meet . Investigational product , dosage mode administration Olaparib available film-coated tablet contain 150 mg 100 mg olaparib . Patients administer study treatment orally dose 300 mg twice daily . The plan dose 300 mg twice daily make two x 150 mg tablet twice daily 100 mg tablet use manage dose reduction . Statistical method Approximately 10 patient allow enter expanded access program . No formal analysis perform data obtain . However safety data summarise tabulated regulatory purpose , number enrol patient sufficient ( &gt; = 5 patient ) . On hand , number patient small ( &lt; 5 patient ) , listing safety data prepare . If number enrol patient sufficient , data summary prepare base Safety Analysis Set , consist patient receive least one dose olaparib least one post baseline safety assessment .</detailed_description>
