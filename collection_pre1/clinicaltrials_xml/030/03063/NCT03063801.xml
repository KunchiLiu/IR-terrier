	<brief_summary>Surgeries heart disease adulthood happen two specific context : - either asymptomatic anomaly , possibly couple onset symptom later life tardily diagnose surgically manage - either malformation treat childhood require new intervention adulthood . In recent year , number adult patient congenital heart disease steadily increase . Advances diagnostic technique surgical treatment enable many child reach adulthood . The number patient higher number child congenital heart disease . The number patient surgery adulthood also increase . Congenital cardiopathy numerous , range simpler pathology inter-auricular inter-ventricular communication , much complex pathology situation univentricular heart . The surgical treatment congenital heart disease classify three group : initial palliative surgery , initial curative surgery iterative surgery . Palliative surgery aim improve clinical tolerance patient condition pathology prevent complication . The curative surgery restore physiological circulation , iterative surgery treat complication degeneration appear curative surgery . Patients undergoing cardiac surgery frequently receive blood product transfusion preoperative , intraoperative , postoperative period . Several observational study show cardiac surgery , transfusion blood derivative associate increase post-operative morbidity mortality . The objective study analyze predictive factor transfusion congenital patient operate adulthood Brugmann University Hospital , depend type surgery apply ( palliative , curative iterative ) . The secondary objective ass whether difference predictive factor identify non-congenital patient undergo cardiac surgery , could potentially alter transfusion approach congenital patient .</brief_summary>
