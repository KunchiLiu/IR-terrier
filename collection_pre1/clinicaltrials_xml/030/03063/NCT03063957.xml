	<detailed_description>Microscopic colitis ( MC ) chronic relapse disease colon , characterize watery non-bloody diarrhea , usually normal colonoscopic finding , typical histology finding . It frequently accompany abdominal pain , nocturnal diarrhea , mild weight loss . The incidence MC increase significantly recent year 2010 study report U.S. incidence MC 19.7 per 100,000 person-years . MC comprise two major histological subtypes : collagenous colitis ( CC ) , characterize distinctive thickened band subepithelial collagen ( &gt; 10-20um ) , lymphocytic colitis ( LC ) , increase number intraepithelial lymphocyte ( &gt; 20 lymphocyte per 100 epithelial cell ) . Although exact etiology MC remain largely unknown , observational study suggest association autoimmune disorder ( e.g . celiac disease , thyroid disorder ) , cigarette smoking status , medication non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug ( NSAIDS ) , proton pump inhibitor ( PPIs ) , selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor ( SSRI ) , statins . In addition environmental factor , recently study indicate genetics specific infectious organism may also play role development disease . A recent study reveal seasonal incidence pattern lymphocytic colitis , suggest potential link infectious allergic component . Further , one study demonstrate association collagenous colitis persistent colonic C. difficile infection . Additionally , familial occurrence MC report , suggest genetic predisposition , role specific genetic factor describe . Finally , recent study demonstrate association MC various autoimmune disorder include celiac disease , autoimmune thyroid disease , Sj√∂ren 's syndrome , indicate MC may part broader spectrum autoimmune disorder . Despite finding , study investigate role genetic , infectious , immunological factor development progression MC . Budesonide treatment MC appear effective randomize control trial , remission rate 80 % . However , recurrence clinical symptom follow withdrawal treatment uncommon . Thus , investigation molecular mechanism underlie MC need order obtain targeted sustainable treatment . Analysis clinical specimen obtain colonoscopy individual affect MC course treatment offer promise method improve understand MC . Profiling genetic molecular characteristic change gut flora , colonic mucosal immune profile , genetic factor course treatment would provide powerful insight role factor pathophysiology disease may ultimately lead good treatment . Additionally , identification disease biomarkers aid develop disease monitoring surveillance strategy . Here , propose establish cohort individual suspect microscopic colitis undergo diagnostic colonoscopy Massachusetts General Hospital ( MGH ) identify genetic molecular characteristic associate progression disease . This study elaborate finding medical record review patient microscopic colitis treat MGH 2002 2014 . In addition medical record , genetic molecular characteristic colonic sample examine determine influence treatment response outcome .</detailed_description>
