	<detailed_description>Introduction : Stroke cause complex adult disability , 30-50 % survivor experience limited independence daily activity . Annually Scotland around 14 000 new stroke event approximately 80,000 survivor live stroke relate disability.This number increase 2035 demographic change lead 26 % increase people age 65 year development acute stroke care lead improve stroke survival rate . Consequently , cumulative cost UK economy stroke , currently estimate £8.9 billion , increase proportionately . Poor upper limb ( UL ) recovery major cause post-stroke disability few 15 % survivor regain full function 6 month . Activities find difficult stroke survivor include dress , bath feed good UL hand function require . Limited UL function characterise muscle weakness , muscle stiffness spasticity alter sensation lead loss movement co-ordination functional task . UL impairment also important predictor quality life six month stroke onset . It therefore vital quality life independent function stroke effective strategy improve arm recovery find . Background : Despite problem poor UL recovery , cost-effective rehabilitation intervention available . Intensive repetitive functional task-specific practice effective improve UL recovery , particularly unaffected UL constrain force practice affect UL . However effect depend six hour per day intensive physiotherapy guide practice , combine constraint mitt additional 8 hour per day . Such intensive supervision although effective , unfeasible many healthcare setting , survivor therapist express reluctance participate demanding treatment . It therefore essential develop effective , resource efficient way provide survivor therapeutic correction movement task practice , less therapy supervision . This vital rehabilitation therapy available within stroke unit UK typically less one hour per day . Dynamic lycra orthoses ( DLO ) may provide inexpensive ( £200 per unit ) potentially effective adjunct UL rehabilitation stroke . The orthoses correct limb position movement provide sensory feedback , therapist would normally . They make measure fabric lycra compression garment individually tailor correct UL movement position . They provide correction finger , wrist elbow movement whilst still allow functional movement . The orthoses wear therapy throughout day practise perform functional task . Theoretically , viscoelastic property DLO create biomechanical force joint stability functional positioning muscle weakness problematic . The DLO may also stretch stiff spastic muscle limit functional UL use . Finally , pressure exert garment muscle skin may stimulate sensory awareness sensory feedback thereby improve neurophysiological control movement . Because DLO wear long period time , may optimise effect task practice formal therapy also self-directed task practice , without need direct therapy supervision . Indeed , grow body evidence show DLO wear reduces spasticity improve UL movement function child neurological impairment . Rationale Study : Although discussion local stroke rehabilitation therapist suggest DLO use practice , evidence effectiveness UL outcomes follow stroke limit . Literature search conduct investigator identify one single case study show improved dexterity , dress write survivor longstanding stroke wear garment 12 hour daily 6 week . A second crossover trial survivor ( n=16 ) 3 36 week stroke onset show good wrist rest posture , passive range movement reduction wrist finger muscle spasticity 3 hour wear DLO . These study small low quality suggest evaluation potential effectiveness intervention UL impairment activity limitation outcomes adjunct UL rehabilitation stroke warrant . Objectives 1 . To assess feasibility conduct effectiveness trial DLO rehabilitation . 2 . To assess potential effectiveness DLO intervention provide adjunct rehabilitation : UL sensory motor impairment , UL activity limitation , activity daily live quality life compare receive usual rehabilitation order select primary outcome measure establish sample size full scale effectiveness trial . Research Questions 1 . What proportion stroke survivor agree participation randomisation DLO study ? 2 . What proportion participant consent participate trial fully complete intervention outcome follow-up assessment ? 3 . What magnitude direction difference upper limb impairment activity stroke survivor use UL DLO intervention adjunct rehabilitation , compare receive standard rehabilitation ? 4 . Is evidence effect orthosis likely persist eight week follow-up ? 5 . Are indications response DLO likely differ participant depend initial UL impairment severity stroke type ( lesion location , stroke classification ischaemic haemorrhagic ) ? Design : A randomised control feasibility trial collect data provide estimate direction magnitude effect range clinical outcome variable determine appropriate primary outcome sample size definitive trial . particular importance assess survivor may benefit , accord severity UL impairment . Procedure : 51 stroke survivor consecutively admit Ninewells Hospital PRI associate rehabilitation hospital . Potentially eligible patient initially identify nursing , rehabilitation staff stroke research nurse 2 4 week admission either select acute stroke unit , patient medically stable . The nursing rehabilitation staff provide invitation letter sign care team explain information sheet patient study , invitation participate . The study researcher approach patient indicated interest participation . Patients agree discussion nurse therapy staff consider screened inclusion , approach study researcher 24 hour give information . The study explain detail write informed consent obtain screen inclusion criterion study participation . Cognitive ability formally assess use Montreal Cognitive Assessment , communication assess use NIH Stroke Scale , scale use team previous stroke study . Upper limb activity limitation assess use Action Research Arm Test ( ARAT ) . The ARAT determine upper limb severity ( mild , moderate , severe ) purposive sampling purpose ensure equal severity sub-groups phase . Other screen information ( confirmation stroke type , previous stroke , ability participate rehabilitation , premorbid arm impairment , shoulder pain sensitivity lycra information comorbidities ) obtain medical record , staff patient recode proforma format CRF . Written inform consent medical record review also undertaken time recruitment . Randomisation : Investigators randomly allocate participant within severity sub-group control group intervention group 2:1 basis . This lead 33 participant ( 11 severity sub-group ) receive lycra orthosis 18 ( 6 severity sub-group ) act control participant . After baseline assessment , give side hemiplegia may determine participant characteristic , stratification undertaken accord side hemiplegia use secure , conceal web-based computerise randomisation system provide Tayside Clinical Trials Unit . Intervention Group : Participants assess measure DLO study Occupational Therapist ( OT ) train DLO fitting . All participant receive sleeve orthosis , encompass finger , wrist elbow , tailor requirement assessed OT , inform participant performance baseline measure . The OT liaise manufacturer order , fit arrange adjustment orthosis ensure fit . Participants ask wear DLO eight hour per day maximum 8 week wake hour . The orthosis remove wash bathing , otherwise participant wear DLO participation usual therapy direct therapist , daily activity . Post Stroke upper limb oedema identify factor early recovery . Participants intervention group , report oedema prevents garment wear per protocol , provide oedema glove wear night information oedema management per normal care . The study research therapists review DLO wear 4 week full wear . In order reflect normal practice , issue arise time researcher advise participant key health professional contact . The treatment group also receive usual care rehabilitation general advice leaflet look arm Control Group : The control group receive usual care rehabilitation general advice leaflet look arm . Both group continue receive usual occupational physiotherapy . Healthcare Professionals : Regular therapist nurse record time DLO application type duration usual therapy use simple proforma log . Outcome assessment undertaken blind assessor baseline , eight week intervention follow-up eight week . The exploratory RCT allow estimation effect size variability facilitate sample size calculation later definitive RCT test effectiveness . The sample size 51 accepted adequate feasibility study type .</detailed_description>
