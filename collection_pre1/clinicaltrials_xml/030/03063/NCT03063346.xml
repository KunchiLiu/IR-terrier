	<brief_summary>Overtraining real problem ( semi- ) professional athlete . Overtraining often cause body ' lack ability recover training . In addition , high intensity train reactive oxygen specie form 20 fold compare rest value . This cause increased muscle tissue damage intense exercise , slow recovery . Improving recovery may increase athlete 's ability reach high training volume result establish high performance plateau . It known hydrolyzed protein positive effect muscle protein synthesis due fast absorption rate . Therefore , hypothesize know protein hydrolysate may positive effect strength recovery .</brief_summary>
