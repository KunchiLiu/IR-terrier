	<detailed_description>Diabetic foot ulcer constitute increase health problem Denmark concurrent age population increase diabetes prevalence . Diabetic foot ulcer belong serious costly complication . Several study find size depth wound one major etiologic factor delay heal . Wound measurement important monitoring heal process wound evaluate effect treatment . Three-dimensional method measure wound size make possible evaluate process wound heal respect dimension . The investigator develop 3D camera , able measure wound size ( 2D area , 3D area , perimeter volume ) ass wound characteristic . The aim study evaluate intra- inter-rater variability wound measurement use 3D camera compare standard measurement method ( 2D image method gel injection ) . Forty-eight patient wound various size measure four clinician . Each wound measure twice 3D camera , 2D image method gel injection wound cavity two clinician .</detailed_description>
