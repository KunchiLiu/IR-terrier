	<brief_summary>Despite modern hearing aid cochlear implant , speech comprehension telephone conversation challenge hearing-impaired patient . On one hand , conventional telephone transmit limit spectrum acoustic signal compare normal conversation . On hand , lip read phone call generally possible . As result , speech comprehension telephone conversation reduce . In previous study , author demonstrate improved speech comprehension hearing-impaired patient use voice-over internet protocol ( VoIP ) telephony ( Skype ) compare conventional telephony . New bluetooth-enabled hearing aid allow direct transmission telephone signal hearing device . As direct transmission expect improve signal-to-noise ratio , speech comprehension test patient bluetooth-enabled hearing aid 4 different scenario : 1. conventional telephony without bluetooth device 2. conventional telephony bluetooth device 3 . VoIP telephony without bluetooth device 4 . VoIP telephony bluetooth device</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Speech comprehension hearing impaired individual limit telephone conversation due limit acoustic spectrum transmit conventional analogue telephone , background noise , interference hear aid absent possibility lip-reading . This provide impact quality life well speech comprehension reduces exclusion social interaction well potential professional occupation . Furthermore , elderly population impair hear function associate high risk dementia , mortality rate dependency daily activity . Mantokoudis et al . recently demonstrate large acoustic spectrum internet telephony ( Voice Internet Protocol [ VoIP ] ) result superior speech comprehension individual hear aid compare conventional telephone . Low signal quality internet telephony significantly attenuate speech understanding . Another study reveal internet telephony combine webcam improves speech comprehension additional lip reading possible . New bluetooth audio streaming device allow pair smart phone device support bluetooth technology computer direct rout audio signal hearing aid . Current state research show significant benefit hear impaired individual use technology telephone conversation . The speech comprehension subjective satisfaction improve due good sound quality accuracy less noise interference . However , speech comprehension new bluetooth device investigate combination internet telephony ( VoIP ) remain unclear whether hear impaired individual could benefit possibility . This study investigate , whether bluetooth audio streaming device pair hear aids/implants combine internet telephony improve speech comprehension hearing impaired individual . VoIP conventional telephone speech comprehension compare without wireless bluetooth phone clip ( Cochlear Wireless Phone Clip , Cochlear Ltd. , 1 University Avenue , Macquarie University , New South Wales 2109 , Australia ) . The phone clip capable directly connect bluetooth-enabled device transmit audio signal directly sound processor hearing implant . A microphone phone clip enable record transmit user 's spoken word mobile phone therefore hands-free use possible . Bluetooth connection well-established wireless technology transmit 2.4 gigahertz distance approximately seven meter . The wireless technology bluetooth Wireless Local Area Network ( WLAN ) device . According Swiss federal health office electromagnetic radiation bluetooth device intend use propose study fulfil requirement European Committee Electrotechnical Standardization ( CENELEC ) . Several previous study demonstrate significantly increased conventional telephone speech perception Cochlear Wireless Phone Clip without device . On hand , speech perception hearing impaired people use internet telephony improve compare conventional telephony . However , speech perception use phone clip connection internet telephony study date remain unknown . The purpose propose study quantify VoIP vs. conventional telephone speech comprehension individual without application bluetooth phone clip . Potentially good speech comprehension due application phone clip could alleviate handicap communication individual hear aid . As consequence social life contact affected individual worsen mental state dependency everyday life could ameliorate use simple device . The goal study measure speech comprehension individual hear aid use bluetooth pair phone clip VoIP telephony . To quantify potential benefit , speech comprehension test without phone clip VoIP conventional telephony individual . Speech comprehension quantify signal/noise ratio HSM- sentence test ( Hochmair , Schulz , Moser ) Upon agreement participate , patient invite audiological department Inselspital Bern . After remain question clarify , patient sign write informed consent . The investigation take approximately two hour take place sound-proof hearing test chamber audiological department . Four different speech comprehension scenario test : 1 . Conventional telephony without bluetooth device 2 . Conventional telephony bluetooth device 3 . VoIP telephony without bluetooth device 4 . VoIP telephony bluetooth device To evaluate speech comprehension , HSM ( Hochmair-Schulz-Moser ) sentence test use . This test mainly apply evaluate speech comprehension patient cochlear implant consist 30 list include 20 short sentence . After initial presentation exercise sentence without background noise , additional noise add speech signal kept constant volume level . The percentage speech comprehension determine quantity correctly understood sentence certain signal-to-noise ratio ( S/N Ratio ) . In study S/N Ratio 10dB , signal 70dB noise 60dB , analyse . For representativeness speech comprehension result , participant use hearing aid daily use volume setting . The phone clip program 1:1 transmission telephone conversation ambient noise . At end , patient evaluate subjective perception speech sound quality mean Mean Opinion Score ( MOS ) .</detailed_description>
