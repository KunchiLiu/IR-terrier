	<brief_summary>The World Health Organization , U.S. Centers Disease Control Prevention , Association Medical Microbiology Infectious Diseases ( AMMI ) Canada , Health Canada declare antimicrobial resistance global threat health , base rapidly increase resistance rate decline new drug development . Up 30-50 % antibiotic use inappropriate , excessive duration treatment great contributor inappropriate use . Shorter duration treatment ( â‰¤7 day ) show meta-analyses effective longer antibiotic treatment range mild moderate infection . A landmark trial critically ill patient ventilator-associated pneumonia show mortality relapse rate non-inferior patient receive 8 v 15 day treatment . Similar randomize trial evidence lack treatment patient bloodstream infection , affect 15 % critically ill patient , estimate 50,000 Canadians per year .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Bloodstream infection common serious problem , affect 15 % critically ill patient , increase length hospital stay 2-3 week , add $ 25,000-40,000 excess hospital cost , triple risk death . At time , antibiotic overuse also common serious problem , 30-50 % antibiotic use unnecessary inappropriate , result avoidable drug side effect kidney failure , Clostridium difficile infection , increased cost , spiral antibiotic resistance rate . The great contributor antibiotic overuse excessive duration treatment . Extensive research demonstrate short duration antibiotic treatment ( less equal 7 day ) effective long duration treatment variety infectious disease , question directly study set bloodstream infection . Our team 's systematic review medical literature , national survey Canadian infectious disease critical care physician , multicentre retrospective study BALANCE pilot RCT , support need randomize control trial compare shorter ( 7 day ) versus longer ( 14 day ) antibiotic therapy bloodstream infection . Prior perform main trial , complete pilot trial establish feasibility research design , optimize definitive trial . By define duration treatment bloodstream infection , research program help maximize clinical cure individual patient , minimize risk drug side effect , C. difficile , antibiotic resistance . Since intervention would require new technology , would reduce ( rather increase ) health care cost , would offer immediate benefit patient healthcare system . The BALANCE RCT randomize critically ill patient bloodstream infection 7 versus 14 day adequate antibiotic treatment ; antibiotic drug , dos , route interval leave discretion treat team . Although placebo control feasible , prolonged allocation concealment day 7 use mitigate selection bias . The primary analysis ass whether 7 day associate non-inferior 90 day survival compare 14 day treatment . Patients vanguard BALANCE pilot RCT include BALANCE main RCT , participate Canadian site continue enrol patient ( ultimately 20-25 Canadian site include ) . BALANCE international collaborator New Zealand , Australia , Saudi Arabia , United States , France Germany work towards inclusion site , facilitate target sample size recruitment within 5 year .</detailed_description>
