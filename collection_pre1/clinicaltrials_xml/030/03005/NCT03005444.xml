	<brief_summary>Liver cirrhosis traditionally see state hypocoagulability protect thrombosis . However , recent study completely change paradigm . Patients liver cirrhosis impair hepatic synthesis procoagulation factor also anticoagulation factor , associate increase procoagulant factor factor VIII von Willebrand factor determines elevate thrombin generation , ultimately , hypercoagulability state . Several consequence hypercoagulability expect , portal vein thrombosis venous thromboembolism . In addition potential direct deleterious consequence development portal vein thrombosis , recent data show close relationship activation coagulation faster progression liver fibrosis . Bacterial translocation common problem play important role pathogenesis complication patient decompensated cirrhosis , include infection well hepatic encephalopathy hepatorenal syndrome . To date , several biomarkers BT propose , include bacterial DNA , soluble CD14 , lipopolysaccharides endotoxin , lipopolysaccharide-binding protein , calprotectin procalcitonin . Besides , endotoxemia activation TNFa-pathway may also consider key component pathogenesis aggravation portal hypertension complication . Anticoagulation therapy beneficial effect survival patient idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis . Besides , pilot study show use anticoagulant warfarin 8 week improve liver elasticity determine Fibroscan® ( Dhar A , et al . J Hepatology 2012 . Abstract ) . An ongoing study warfarin prevention fibrosis due recurrent hepatitis C also contribute understand role haemostatic system fibrosis ( http : //www.controledtrials.com/IRSCTN12504151 ) . On hand , recent prospective study group 70 patient liver cirrhosis ( Child B C stag 10 point ) randomize receive enoxaparin year ( n = 34 ) v intervention ( n = 36 ) show anticoagulant treatment enoxaparin safe effective , significantly reduce risk PVT development liver decompensation , markedly improve overall survival . This study provide exciting preliminary data regard potential use prophylactic anticoagulation improve clinical outcome cirrhosis , beyond prevention portal vein thrombosis . This study suggest effect partly due direct effect reduce BT level proinflammatory cytokine . However , study include patient , double blind , placebo group . Therefore , despite spectacular result , use prophylactic anticoagulant therapy become routine practice patient cirrhosis study need assess potential usefulness anticoagulation improve prognosis liver cirrhosis . Transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt ( TIPS ) routinely use treat complication portal hypertension , variceal bleed refractory ascites . TIPS effective method prevent rebleeding , however , burden increase risk hepatic encephalopathy deterioration liver function patient advanced cirrhosis . Notably , TIPS relieve portal pressure also redirect portal blood flow shunt directly systemic circulation cause systemic hemodynamic change . Given preliminary data suggest beneficial effect prophylactic anticoagulation LMWH cirrhotic patient , multicenter randomize control study attempt demonstrate effect long term LMWH therapy TIPS survival cirrhotic patient variceal bleeding .</brief_summary>
