	<brief_summary>The purpose study see effect skip breakfast versus consume breakfast cognitive performance hormone responsible glucose homeostasis lean obese adolescent male . The subject test ability maintain attention give several task call continuous temporal expectancy task ( CTET ) electrophysiological signal use electroencephalogram ( EEG ) monitor . These two study group randomize one two order : ( A , B ) ( B , A ) A = breakfast intervention B = breakfast . There washout period 7 day study visit .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Eating unhealthy food exercise regularly contribute obesity child . Other unhealthy behavior , skip meal also lead obesity . Breakfast known important meal day , yet many people skip breakfast . Skipping breakfast cause imbalance hormone control blood glucose . Skipping breakfast affect well insulin work lower blood glucose later meal time . The impact breakfast glucose homeostasis different lunch dinner . This become evident group researcher study effect skip breakfast hormone responses subsequent isocaloric lunch dinner adult Type 2 diabetes . The study show Type 2 diabetic , skip breakfast lead increase post-prandial hyperglycemia decrease glucagon-like peptide-1 ( GLP-1 ) release , impair insulin response hyperglycemia . Plasma free fatty acid ( FFA ) level find significantly high lunch dinner breakfast omit . It show acute elevation FFA induce hepatic insulin resistance increase hepatic glucose production patient Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus non-diabetic control . Impaired insulin secretion predispose condition obesity , disease . Skipping breakfast also negative effect child 's ability keep focus attention . The CTET tool use directly measure attention use EEG highly sensitive measure neural processing .</detailed_description>
