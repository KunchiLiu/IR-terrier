	<brief_summary>Hyperglycaemia Pregnancy Gestational Diabetes Mellitus ( GDM ) one common obstetric medical condition undetected cause significant adverse outcome mother offspring . Diagnosis typically make 24-28 week pregnancy use oral glucose tolerance test ( OGTT ) . Therefore , damage might already happen prior detection . Although universal screen recommend many guideline , uniformly follow across world , partly doubt cost-effectiveness . Only selective screening follow base presence least one high risk factor ( age , BMI , previous history , etc ) . This strategy miss 50 % GDM . In addition , data exists India Kenya . In low middle-income country ( LMICs ) , majority live rural setting , major limitation difficulty conduct OGTT , require prompt access laboratory facility . Combining clinical easily analysable biochemical marker ( composite risk score ) could improve prediction proven , could help prevent onset GDM . Fasting glucose level ( non-diabetes level ) early pregnancy could predict future GDM . HbA1c early pregnancy well marker do point-of-care require patient fast state . The overall objective propose project develop composite risk score predict GDM early pregnancy use combination easily identifiable risk factor age , BMI , family history Type 2 Diabetes along HbA1c Indians Kenyans . The project recruit pregnant woman early pregnancy South India ( n=3400 ) Western Kenya ( n=4000 ) . Contribution individual risk factor well composite risk score risk develop GDM assess . Detailed health economic analysis enable policy maker make inform decision base local data .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>High glucose level Pregnancy Gestational Diabetes Mellitus ( GDM ) one common medical condition pregnancy . When undetected , cause significant harm pregnant woman offspring . GDM affect 5-25 % pregnant woman . It depend population boundary drawn normal abnormal glucose level . Certain ethnic minority group consider high-risk develop GDM , include Indians . It estimate &gt; 15 % pregnancy affect GDM India . The immediate risk untreated GDM high rate pre-eclampsia , high caesarean section rate psychological effect anxiety depression . Women develop GDM 7-8 time higher life-time risk type 2 diabetes ( T2D ) . Similarly , immediate risk child big small , shoulder damage labour , low glucose level jaundice birth , difficulty breathe rare case stillbirth . In long term , risk obesity T2D also high . The diagnosis GDM usually make 24-28 week pregnancy use glucose drink test call oral glucose tolerance test ( OGTT ) . Although treatment improve outcome , damage may already do detection GDM . Therefore , screen detect high glucose level pregnancy seem beneficial . However , harm well benefit screen programme . Therefore balance achieve identifying woman whose blood glucose level high enough cause harm glucose level would cause harm . Currently , recommend pregnant woman screen GDM belong high-risk ethnic population . However , conduct OGTT India challenging , test require pregnant woman present laboratory facility fast state . In many country , woman select OGTT base presence least one high risk factor higher body weight , old age family history T2D . However , selection method miss 50 % woman may develop GDM . The aim study develop risk score early pregnancy base combination risk factor collect easily along simple finger prick average blood glucose test ( call HbA1c ) . The efficiency different level combine risk score test risk develop GDM later part pregnancy . Cost effectiveness analysis also conduct identify risk level screen recommend India . An accurate score safely exclude woman low risk develop GDM significant benefit pregnant woman . They safely reassure . Avoiding need OGTT significant time cost benefit . In contrast , score identifies high-risk , healthy eat appropriate life style advice reduce risk develop GDM later pregnancy .</detailed_description>
