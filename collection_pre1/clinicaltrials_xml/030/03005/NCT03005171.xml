	<brief_title>Perioperative Epidural Versus Intravenous Local Anesthetic Infusion Open Upper Abdominal Surgery</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Postoperative pain one commonest problem encounter anaesthesiologists , especially open abdominal surgery , post-operative pain would cause restrictive respiratory dysfunction , associate poor postoperative outcome . Despite fact epidural block provide superior analgesia ; often ideal option frequently cause hypotension may require excessive intravenous fluid administration , particularly deleterious bowel surgery . Other complication include epidural hematoma high failure rate . Furthermore epidural analgesia may contraindicate patient e.g . patient certain anti-platelet therapy patient refuse technique . Other modality control postoperative pain use e.g . intravenous analgesic continuous wound infiltration , none proven effective epidural block . Whether perioperative lidocaine infusion effective epidural block reduce post-operative pain , study 's concern . Some research study efficacy lidocaine infusion control neuropathic well acute postoperative pain encouraging result . Lidocaine infusion find reduce postoperative pain , opioid consumption length hospital stay . Although risks neurological cardiac toxicity exist , substantiated trial . Lidocaine describe analgesic , anti-hyperalgesic effects6 , well anti-inflammatory property . It also accelerate return post-operative gastrointestinal function , particular importance major abdominal surgery . Opposite opioids , increase incidence nausea vomiting , lidocaine decrease incidence .</detailed_description>
