	<brief_summary>Because genetic traditional commonality underlie cause atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease ( CVD ) cancer , hypothesize patient atherosclerotic CVD may high incidence cancer compare non-atherosclerotic CVD . To address hypothesis , investigate longitudinal clinical outcome total 32,095 consecutive patient CVD enrol Sakakibara Health Integrative Profile ( SHIP ) cohort study launch 2006 purpose improve healthy life expectancy patient CVD institute .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>The Sakakibara Health Integrative Profile Cohort Study</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The SHIP cohort study launch 2006 purpose improve healthy life expectancy patient cardiovascular disease ( CVD ) admit Sakakibara Heart Institute . The study use continuous surveillance system track subsequent incident CVD and/or non-CVD include cancer , via direct contact outpatient department , hospital record , mail questionnaire least year . Organ sit cancer also identify whenever possible . The study sort diagnosis CVD nine category , namely coronary artery disease , aortic disease , peripheral artery disease , myocardial disease , unclassified any-cause heart failure , valvular heart disease , arrhythmia , congenital CVD , others . For example , patient couple disease , plural category . Cerebrovascular disease include category 'others ' mixed cause diseases embolic stroke , lacunar infarction , cardio-embolic stroke , hemorrhagic stroke , etc . Atherosclerotic CVD define presence one follow three disease : coronary artery disease , aortic disease peripheral artery disease . With regard detail coronary artery disease , acute coronary syndrome , previous myocardial infarction stable ischemic heart disease . Aortic disease consist acute aortic syndrome aortic aneurysm . Non-atherosclerotic CVD define CVD except atherosclerotic congenital CVD . The SHIP cohort study also handle define lifestyle relate disease confirm diagnosis one presence hypertension , dyslipidemia , diabetes mellitus chronic kidney disease accordance universal criterion . A history tobacco smoking also identify . Among total 36,151 patient CVD enrol SHIP cohort study June 2006 July 2014 , exclude 245 patient already diagnose cancer time enrollment SHIP cohort study , 3,811 patient congenital CVD include Marfan syndrome . Thus , analyze total 32,095 consecutive patient acquire CVD present study.Our study conduct two step assess incidence cancer patient acquire CVD . The first step consist comparison atherosclerotic CVD non-atherosclerotic CVD regard incidence cancer . The second step determine association singular presence versus plural presence atherosclerotic CVD incidence cancer .</detailed_description>
