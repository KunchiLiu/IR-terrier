	<brief_title>ML29255 Neoadjuvant Vemurafenib Cobimetinib Melanoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Vemurafenib cobimetinib FDA-approved drug treat advance melanoma mutate ( change ) form cell protein call BRAF ( BRAF V600 mutation ) . The purpose study determine vemurafenib cobimetinib safely give patient type melanoma shrink surgery . This research do patient melanoma spread lymph node high chance melanoma recurrence even lymph node removal surgery , currently approve medicine use patient BRAF V600 mutant melanoma lymph node removal surgery . Vemurafenib cobimetinib combination approve United States Food Drug Administration ( FDA ) patient advanced melanoma . In trial , vemurafenib cobimetinib combination consider experimental since safety combination prior lymph node surgery study . Before participant begin study : The participant need follow exam , test procedure find eligibility met . - A skin exam - An eye exam - An electrocardiogram ( ECG ) test track electricity heart - An echocardiogram ( test use sound wave create picture heart ) MUGA scan ( test use radioactive material call tracer show heart chamber ) test evaluate function heart - A blood test - A biopsy lymph node If exams test list show individual take part study , chooses take part , participant take study drug 8weeks . He/she take vemurafenib 240mg 4tablets twice daily 56days cobimetinib 20mg 3 tablet daily day 1-21 29-49 . While take pill , follow extra exam test need . - Four extra blood sample draw . One blood sample drawn immediately first dose vemurafenib trametinib pill . Then blood sample draw 2 week , 4weeks , 8weeks start pill . - A biopsy lymph node perform 2weeks start pill . - Skin exams perform immediately first dose , 2weeks , 4weeks , 8weeks start pill . - Eye exam perform 4weeks , 8weeks start pill . - An ECG perform 2weeks , 4weeks , 8weeks start pill . - An echocardiogram MUGA scan perform 4weeks start pill . - A CT scan perform 8weeks start pill . Once participant finish 8weeks study drug , undergo surgery within week . After surgery , individual need follow extra exam . • A skin exam A blood sample take study first study visit , two week visit eight week visit . Tissue core biopsy take study first study visit two week visit . This sample require order individual take part study research sample important part study . The research biopsy do similar way biopsy do diagnosis . Neither participant participant 's health care plan/insurance carrier bill collection blood tissue sample use study . The result make available participant participation trial .</detailed_description>

Women nonchildbearing potential may include without serum pregnancy test either surgically sterile postmenopausal ≥ 1 year . Fertile men woman must use effective method contraception treatment least 6 month completion treatment direct physician . Effective method contraception define result low failure rate ( i.e. , less 1 % per year ) use consistently correctly ( example implant , injectables , combine oral contraception intrauterine device ) . At discretion Investigator , acceptable method contraception may include total abstinence case lifestyle patient ensures compliance . ( Periodic abstinence [ e.g. , calendar , ovulation , symptothermal , postovulation method ] withdrawal acceptable method contraception . ) Willing able undergo biopsy research purpose Willing able sign inform consent Had prior radiotherapy lymph node basin Prior treatment BRAF inhibitor MEK inhibitor Active infection Pregnant , lactate breast feed woman Concomitant malignancy previous malignancy within last 5 year , exception adequately treat basal squamous cell carcinoma skin carcinoma situ cervix . History malabsorption condition would interfere absorption vemurafenib cobimetinib Any underlying medical psychiatric condition , opinion Investigator make administration vemurafenib cobimetinib hazardous Unwillingness inability comply study followup procedure . The following foods/supplements prohibit least 7 day prior initiation study treatment : St. John 's wort hyperforin ( potent cytochrome P450 CYP3A4 enzyme inducer ) Grapefruit juice ( potent cytochrome P450 CYP3A4 enzyme inhibitor )</criteria>
