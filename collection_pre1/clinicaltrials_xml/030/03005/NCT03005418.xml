	<detailed_description>This prospective , multicenter , single arm , non-randomized phase 2 study 20 adult patient limb-threatening damage superficial femoral popliteal artery require surgical repair . Subjects implant Humacyte Human Acellular Vessel ( HAV ) interposition vessel bypass use standard vascular surgical technique . There control arm . The active study duration study participant 12 month HAV implantation HAV failure/ removal/ death earlier . Additional follow 6 month interval 36 month involve capture information assessment perform `` standard care '' routine clinic visit telephone follow patient his/her physician . There study specific visit procedure 12 month . The total expected duration clinical study 24 month ( 12 month enrollment 12 month study specific visit ) plus 2 year additional follow routine clinical visit via telephone contact subject and/or physician designate continue long term care subject .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>1 . Patients low limb vascular trauma threaten viability leg require reconstruction superficial femoral popliteal artery 2 . Preoperative ultrasound angiography CT angiography clinical examination indicate damage superficial femoral artery ( SFA ) popliteal artery require reconstruction interposition bypass vessel AND require bypass length â‰¤ 38cm 3 . Proximal anastomosis expect common femoral artery inguinal ligament superficial femoral artery popliteal artery 4 . Distal anastomosis expect SFA , popliteal artery tibioperoneal trunk 5 . Autologous vein graft either feasible judgment treat surgeon ( e.g . lack availability suitable conduit , presence severe venous insufficiency ) desirable urgency revascularization 6 . Aged 18 85 year old , inclusive 7 . Able communicate meaningfully investigative staff able comply study procedure . If patient unconscious information reliable witness indicate patient would normally able understand comply study procedures 8 . Patient legal representative able , willing competent give inform consent 9 . Life expectancy least 1 year 1 . Limb high risk amputation despite vascular reconstruction e.g. , crush injury 2 . Life threaten head , chest , abdominal injury make survival unlikely 3 . Distal anastomosis plan tibial pedal artery 4 . Pregnant woman 5 . Known medical condition would preclude long term dual antiplatelet therapy resolution acute injuries 6 . Any condition judgment investigator would preclude adequate evaluation safety efficacy Humacyte Human Acellular Vessel ( HAV ) 7 . Previous enrollment study 8 .
