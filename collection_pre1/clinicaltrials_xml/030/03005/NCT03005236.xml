Although kidney transplantation remain optimal RRT choice , clear old adult differential risk versus benefit profile kidney transplantation compare young adult . No age-adapted immunosuppression old adult show improve kidney allograft outcomes recent sub-analyses clinical trial data hint improved outcome old kidney transplant patient receive Envarsus versus standard twice-daily tacrolimus formulation .

	<detailed_description>The proportion elderly patient end-stage kidney disease undergoing renal replacement therapy ( RRT ) steadily increase . National registry data consistently show trend towards increase median age patient start dialysis await kidney transplantation deceased-donor waiting list ( www.renalreg.org ) . For example , United Kingdom , national audit data UK Renal Registry demonstrate median age incident patient commence RRT 64.5 year ( www.renalreg.org ) . Among prevalent RRT population , percentage patient age great 70 year increase 19.2 % ( 2000 ) 25.0 % ( 2013 ) last registry report ( www.renalreg.org ) . Focusing data UK Transplant Registry , 28 % transplant recipient receive deceased-donor kidney allograft last year age 60 ( 7 % age 70 ) , 32 % active kidney transplant wait list age 60 ( 9 % age 70 ) ( http : //www.odt.nhs.uk/uk-transplant-registry/ ) . With chronic kidney disease increasingly recognize public health epidemic , long-term prospect increasingly elderly component end-stage kidney disease population . Kidney transplantation gold standard method RRT due superior mortality , quality life cost effectiveness versus dialysis . It therefore concern transplantation infrequent RRT choice older adult number old adult age 70 list kidney transplant &lt; 10 % . The Renal Association state ; `` age contra-indication transplantation age relate co-morbidity important limiting factor '' , clearly risk versus benefit ratio remain unclear clinician mortality risk high old versus young kidney transplant recipient . However , improved mortality observe kidney transplantation versus wait-listed dialysis patient across age group , specifically among old adult age 70 US study , therefore Investigators consider kidney transplantation increase large cohort . The risk immunosuppression-related complication increase age therefore age-adapted immunosuppression consider balance efficacy versus complication . However , target age-adapted immunosuppression clinical trial conduct kidney transplantation remain major gap literature . Sub-analyses recently publish work show clinically relevant advantage Envarsus versus twice-daily tacrolimus prevention treatment failure 2-years among patient age 65 ( age ≥65 yr ; -25.89 % ( -45.11 % , 0.36 % ) , p=0.067 ) ( Rostaing et al , AJKD 2016 ; Budde et al , AJT 2014 ) . However , small number render effect borderline statistical significance As one large grow demographic , imperative design target clinical trial ascertain Envarsus clinical benefit beyond twice-daily tacrolimus old kidney transplant recipient . Before possible , investigator must investigate two thing preparation definitive study ; 1 ) investigator must confirm reproducibility trend among old kidney transplant recipient separate cohort determine effect size power calculation , 2 ) identify possible mechanistic , biological and/or pharmacogenomic rationale understand effect . This feasibility study first contemporary randomise control trial kidney transplantation look modify age-adapted immunosuppression protocol specifically old adult , attempt determine whether result recreate probed great detail . As one topical question field transplantation , result feasibility study would advise merit undertake definitive study would almost certainly one eagerly awaited study global transplant clinician .</detailed_description>
