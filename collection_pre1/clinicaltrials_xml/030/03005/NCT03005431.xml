	<brief_title>Parents Newly Diagnosed Preschool Children With Autism Spectrum Disorder :</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Statement Research Problem/Purpose/Objectives Autism Spectrum Disorder ( ASD ) neurological disorder cause complex developmental difficulty within first three year life . Preschool child diagnose ASD typically pervasive deficit social interaction communication , occurrence repetitive restrictive behaviour . Parenting preschool child characteristic , couple devastating impact child receive diagnosis ASD , create high level parental anxiety , stress , depression , general mental health difficulty . Given seriousness child 's diagnosis compromise parent family functioning , family refer formalized treatment program provide support child parent . However , recent rise Autism prevalence rate Manitoba parent wait year receive formalized government fund treatment service child family . This delay formalize service critically important consequence child , family , society . To bridge gap service , parent could afford opportunity participate cost efficient self-directed online training support program specific parent Manitoba . Given consistent evidence support effectiveness parent train involvement child enter formalized treatment program , potential effectiveness parent train support wait formalized treatment program also consider . Research efficacy effectiveness on-line self-directed Autism parent training program extremely limited . Additionally , lack knowledge regard appropriate content , timing , duration training program parent newly diagnose child ASD conflict evidence interactional effect parent training level parent stress time period . The primary purpose study address train support requirement parent preschool child newly diagnose ASD , develop evaluate effectiveness self-directed on-line ASD parent train support program . The secondary purpose assess interactional effect , self-directed on-line ASD parent train support program , parent stress , parent child outcome . It predict parent receive on-line training support increase parent knowledge skill , reduce level stress , create well engagement communication outcome child , comparison parent receive train support . Methods : The experimental study use randomize , mask , waitlist control design compare intervention treatment group waitlist control group . After meet criteria consent requirement participation study , family participate pre-measures . Families randomize either treatment group waitlist control group . After pre measure treatment group parent receive access on-line self-directed training support program 4-month period . After time period group re-assessed Parent Child outcome measure Waitlist Group give access on-line self-directed training support program . Procedure . After family assess eligible study , sign consent form participate study , give appointment time attend nursery set pre-measures . One parent ask engage free play child similar would home ( use standardize set toy ) . The parent video record play child ten-minute period , ask answer three questionnaire . This procedure occur baseline ( Time 1 , within 2 month diagnosis ) , treatment period ( Time 2 , least four month baseline measure ) . After base-line measure , family randomly assign treatment group , waitlist group , use random number table pre-arranged opaque envelope system . Treatment group parent give access participate on-line self-directed parent train support intervention Time 1 Time 2 , waitlist group parent give access intervention Time 2 . Parents give code access on-line resource ensure anonymity participant . The code also allow principle investigator track parent access on-line training support complete on-line training . When treatment group parent complete on-line training ( least four-month period elapse since baseline measure ) parent child invite back nursery setting Time 2 measurement . Additionally , four-month period match waitlist group parent child invite back original setting Time 2 measurement , give access on-line training support . Families sign consent form drop , also give access on-line training support , time . The personnel use administer , score input data questionnaire , observational measure , mask participant 's group assignment time measure . All data contain code specific participant identifier . All digital video recording , questionnaire , observation sheet , participant code sheet keep locked cabinet office main investigator password protect secured government server . Inter-observer agreement use observation measure parent 's intervention techniques child 's measure engagement communication . For observational measure , personnel train primary investigator . Inter-observer agreement use training procedure personnel meet exceed 80 % agreement measure two consecutive observation trial . Additionally , observation data collect , random sample 20 % data measure score two personnel , inter-observer agreement report . The independent variable on-line self-directed parent train support program . Each on-line module contain multi-media presentation ( write material , graphic , video 's ) , link additional material find internet , summaries key information , small quiz help parent focus important material accompany parent workbook . In addition , parent direct Module 2 on-line parent support information share forum exclusive parent train program . Through on-line forum parent access professional autism specialist parent involve study , able ask question , answer question , provide comment , discus issue , general receive support give support others . Four specific hypothesis test statistical significance . The first hypothesis : Parents treatment group significantly high Family Support , Knowledge Intervention Techniques score , significantly low Stress score Time 2 , compare control group . This hypothesis test individually measure use Analysis Covariance design ( ANCOVA ) test difference group adjust initial difference . The second hypothesis : Children parent treatment group significantly high score Engagement Communication Time 2 compare child parent control group . This hypothesis test individually measure use Analysis Covariance design ( ANCOVA ) test difference group adjust initial difference . The third hypothesis : Parent 's perceive level stress moderate treatment effect Parent outcomes measure Knowledge Intervention Techniques Time 2 . Specifically , hypothesize negative ( inverse ) correlation Parent stress score Time 1 Parent Knowledge Intervention Technique score time 2 ( high parent 's stress score Time 1 , low parent 's Knowledge Intervention Technique score Time 2 ) . Additionally , hypothesize negative ( inverse ) correlation parent 's change stress score Time 1 Time 2 parent 's Knowledge Intervention Technique score Time 2 ( parent perceive level stress decrease Time 1 Time 2 parent 's Knowledge Intervention Technique score increase Time 2 ) . Correlations conduct use Pearson 's product-moment ( r ) calculation . The fourth hypothesis : Parent 's perceive level stress moderate treatment effect Child outcomes measure Engagement Communication Time 2 . Specifically , hypothesize negative ( inverse ) correlation Parent stress score Time 1 Child Engagement Communication score time 2 ( high parent 's stress score Time 1 , low Child Engagement Communication score Time 2 ) . Additionally , hypothesize negative ( inverse ) correlation parent 's change stress score Time 1 Time 2 Child 's Engagement Communication score Time 2 ( parent perceive level stress decrease Time 1 Time 2 Child 's Engagement Communication score increase Time 2 ) . Correlations conduct use Pearson 's product-moment ( r ) calculation . Process Seeking Consent Initial screen patient meet criterion do Developmental Pediatricians Child Development Clinic . When patient SSCY Centre counsel Pediatrician , Pediatrician provide family meet inclusion criterion study advertisement contain PIs contact information . Parents phone Principal Investigator find participation study give option meeting Principal Investigator office SSCY Centre home , place choosing . The Principal Investigator explain study consent form time . Parents tell need decide immediately option review study documentation consent form others , convenience . They also give phone number call question .</detailed_description>
