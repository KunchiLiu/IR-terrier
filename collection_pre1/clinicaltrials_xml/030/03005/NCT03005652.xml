	<brief_summary>The European Commission Horizon 2020 programme fund SCD-WELL trial investigate efficacy mindfulness-based training reduce anxiety individual Subjective Cognitive Decline ( SCD ) , comparison active comparison condition . It increasingly recognize neuropathological process start year onset clinical Alzheimer 's disease ( AD ) . Hence , grow urgency target individual earliest stage intervention neurodegeneration still limit . Individuals clinically judge SCD , define subjectively experienced cognitive decline normal performance cognitive test , increase risk future cognitive decline AD . These individual SCD currently establish treatment option . Symptoms anxiety high prevalence population , evidence recent longitudinal research link anxiety significantly accelerate cognitive decline risk individual . Effectively reduce anxiety population may therefore relieve participant burdensome symptom , may also slow cognitive decline delay prevent onset AD . The investigator choose study efficacy mindfulness-based intervention reduce anxiety population type intervention show reduce anxiety number population , include old adult . Further , accumulate evidence indicate intensive mindfulness train effectively down-regulates number adverse psychological biological risk factor AD , stress , depression , insomnia , feeling loneliness social exclusion , cardiovascular risk factor . These finding relevant AD approximately third AD case worldwide might attributable potentially modifiable risk factor . In spite increase use mindfulness-based intervention treat clinical symptom , trial often suffer lack adequate comparison condition lack follow know whether initial benefit maintain . SCD-WELL include active comparison condition 16-week follow assessment end intervention . SCD-WELL non-CTIMP European multicentre , observer-blinded , randomize , control , superiority trial two parallel group , compare anxiety additional behavioural biological outcome amongst people SCD receive mindfulness-based training receive health education comparison intervention . Outcomes measured baseline , post-intervention 16 week end intervention . 160 older-adult patient diagnose SCD recruit study memory clinic four site Europe : London , UK ; Cologne , Germany ; Barcelona , Spain ; Lyon , France seek help due concern memory . Participants recruit two wave maximum two-year period provide participant information sheet , ask consider participation .
