	<brief_title>The Effect Fermented Papaya Preparation Patients With Chronic Kidney Disease Under Dialysis Receiving Intravenous Iron</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Background rationale Patients chronic kidney disease ( CKD ) hemodialysis often suffer anemia . The anemia primarily cause insufficient production fail kidney erythroid stimulate hormone - erythropoietin ( Epo ) . Oxidative stress may another reason anemia . Oxidative stress RBCs patient may cause : 1 . Passage blood plastic tube dialysis procedure . We show oxidative stress RBCs follow passage blood similar tube leukopheresis procedure ( 1 ) . Other group report similar effect hemodialysis . 2 . Iron overload - In order maximize effect Epo , treatment supplement IV injection iron . This iron may accumulate cause iron overload hemodialyzed patient . Under normal condition , iron transport blood enters cell follow bind plasma protein transferrin . However , iron content plasma exceed bind capacity transferrin , non-transferrin-bound iron ( NTBI ) appear . This iron enter cell via alternative pathway , accumulate cytosol , participate chemical reaction ( Haber-Weiss , Fenton ) generate reactive oxygen specie ( ROS ) . Excess ROS overcome protective cellular anti-oxidant mechanism become cytotoxic . In erythroid system , excess ROS cause accelerate apoptosis ( program cell death ) precursor cell bone marrow short survival mature RBCs circulation , result chronic anemia . Excess iron ROS may also damage cell lead malfunction vital organ , heart liver ( 2,3 ) . FPP report bind neutralize ( scavenge ) ROS ( 4 ) well free iron ( chelate ) ( 5 ) . Both activity ameliorate oxidative stress . Treatment FPP various disease associate oxidative stress , administer orally ( 3 gr . X 3 time day ) , show significantly ameliorate symptom underlie disease ( 6-18 ) . FPP long track-record safe human consumption ( 19-20 ) . It use many year food-supplement thousand people around world without report side effect . Research goal To study effect ferment papaya preparation ( FPP ) patient chronic kidney disease ( CKD ) dialysis , receive intravenous iron . General Protocol : This single-arm , open-label , single-center study 20 patient upon dialysis receive IV iron supplementation . All participant treat FPP 3 month . Bi-weekly , blood sample draw patient monitor assessment safety efficacy . Detailed Protocol Twenty patient , treat Hadassah Medical center , Jerusalem , screen recruit accord clinical criterion . inclusion criterion : Age 18-70 . Any primary kidney disease result ESRD . Hemodynamically stable status . PTH 2-9 time upper normal limit . Patients receive ESA may include . 3 . Exclusion criterion : Any evidence acute bleeding . Hg level le 8 g/dL Patients know allergy Papaya 3 . Patients treat orally FPP ( 3 gr . X 3 time day ) 3 month . 4 . Blood sample obtain patient prior ( every 2 week ) treatment . 5 . Samples analyze : Blood chemistry Potassium , Albumin Phosphorous ( every 2 week ) . Anemia : Complete blood count , include RBC number index , well hemoglobin content . Oxidative stress : ( monthly ) Reactive oxygen specie Reduced glutathione Membrane lipid peroxidation External phosphatidylserine Iron overload : ( monthly ) Serum ferritin Serum transferin . Labile plasma iron Serum hepcidin Intracellular labile iron pool Safety measure : Adverse event : Frequency , severity , seriousness , time onset , duration , relatedness study product .</detailed_description>
