	<brief_title>Identifying Stress Urinary Incontinence Women With Pelvic Organ Prolapse</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Pelvic organ prolapse ( POP ) descent pelvic organ vagina . It see 11 % female population age 80 year old often treat surgery . For patient pelvic organ prolapse complaint de novo stress urinary incontinence ( SUI ) , potential , occult SUI prolapse surgery well-documented . This new onset incontinence range 6-60 % time therefore , patient undergo surgery POP risk need subsequent procedure SUI identify prior pelvic reconstruction . Pre-operative evaluation SUI include history physical exam . The physical exam may include empty supine stress test ESST , stand cough stress test ( CST ) , pyridium pad test , urodynamics ( UDS ) . Prior study perform determine test best identify SUI . One systemic review find UDS 92 % sensitive identifying SUI . When compare UDS cough stress test weigh pyridium pad test , cough stress test find 90 % sensitive pyridium pad test 60 % sensitive . The pyridium pad test 68 % sensitive pad test find positive orange color stain note pad . The various way test perform also evaluate . For example , statistical difference outcome CST ; whether complete supine stand independent bladder volume . In regard pyridium pad test , several study compare 1 hour 24 hour pyridium pad test vary result efficacy . Furthermore , study do compare pad weight color , even asymptomatic woman positive pyridium pad test suggest test le specific identifying SUI . A secondary analysis look different reduction method effect predictability post-operative SUI UDS . Reduction pelvic organ prolapse speculum sensitive identify post-operative SUI 53 % . However , paucity evidence pre-operative test best identify SUI patient pelvic organ prolapse . In prospective study , aim determine test sensitive pre-operatively identify SUI occult SUI patient treat prolapse . The hypothesis state difference sensitivity UDS , pyridium pad test cough stress test , UDS sensitive gold standard identify SUI patient pelvic organ prolapse .</detailed_description>
