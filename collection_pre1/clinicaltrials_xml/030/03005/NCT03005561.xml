	<detailed_description>In last 50 year use growth hormone ( rhGH , somatropin ) become commonly treat problem GH deficiency , chronic renal failure Turner syndrome Prader-Willi . Giving hormone childhood adolescence design accelerate growth close gap average population reach final height normal , minimizing risk cost . Noncompliance treatment GH common ; Other estimate one third one half patient comply provision require . This may result linear growth depreciation , unnecessary diagnostic test , unnecessary change dosage treatment high cost . GH therapy non-yielding satisfactory result , recommend first consider noncompliance turn look cause . Many study devote locate factor make difficult adhere chronic disease child , include condition require treatment GH . Pain primary cause difficulty . Despite pain seem fairly simple phenomenon , actually complex . Untreated pain manifest prominently course immediate distress child parent , deep effect ; It seem pain receive treatment early stag child 's life adversely affect central nervous system development . This assumption support various study . Pain force shape behavior ; In recent decade , many resource devote research development way deal pain aspect . In order implement information collect , appropriate intervention medium find ; In study intend use method playback . Playback define improvisation theater facilitator ask audience share moment , feeling story daily life , group actor improvise story front stage kind `` play-back '' . Unlike hobby sport singing , method allows unload tension also communication collaboration . It reminiscent psychodrama , unlike , consider therapeutic tool . Assumption : Intervention two playback meeting year uncover difficulty engage way deal pain . That reduce difficulty cause GH injection improve compliance treatment . Study Population : 1 . This pilot study total 200 participant treat GH therapy . 2 . Intervention group - 100 participant participate Play Back meeting . 3 . Control group - 100 participant similar demographic participate play back meeting . Patients divide randomly group . The following data collected- - Height ( SDS ) - Growth rate ( SDS ) - IGF-1 ( SDS ) - sample take first visit ( time 0 last visit six month later ) . - Accountability - empty ampoule growth hormone ( collect visit No . 3 - After three month last visit , six month ) . Inclusion criterion : 1 . Patients diagnose growth hormone deficiency 2 . Patients treat growth hormone least two year . 3 . The patient parent sign inform consent mother tongue . 4 . Patients speaker reader Hebrew . 5 . Age range : Boys 7 year 12 year , Girls 7 year 11 year . Exclusion criterion : 1 . Patients receive growth hormone reason . 2 . Patients comorbidities ( celiac disease , hypothyroidism ) . 3 . Children begin sign puberty ( Tanner 2 high ) . 4 . Patients complete growth , close epiphysis . The information collect study type encoder . The list link subject code give keep ISF , accessible study team . The questionnaire participant identify personal code give participant store dedicate research folder Endocrinology diabetes Soroka Medical Center . The intervention protocol : Visit no.1 : 1 . Parents patient sign ICF . 2 . Patients randomize . 3 . Height Weight measure . 4 . Patient / parent answer questionnaires regard compliance GH treatment , difficulty way deal pain - patient age 8 , parent complete questionnaire . 5 . IGF-1 blood sample collect . 6 . Patients parent guide bring empty ampoule next study visit also last visit . 7 . Patients randomized intervention group meet Play Back team first session . Visit no.2 : This visit take place one month first visit . Patients randomized intervention group meet Play Back team first session . The meeting divide 2 age group : first 7-9 year old participant , second one 10-12 year old participant . Visit no.3 : This visit take place 3 month first visit . Patients randomized intervention group meet Play Back team second session . Visit no.4 : This visit take place 6 month first visit . 1 . Height Weight measure . 2 . IGF-1 blood sample collect . 3 . Patient / parent answer questionnaires regard compliance GH treatment , difficulty way deal pain - patient age 8 , parent complete questionnaire . 4 . Drug accountability . System analysis processing result Descriptive statistic quantitative variable ( age ) distribute normally show average Â± SD . Quantitative variable show normal distribution ( number day hospitalization ) present median value quarterly domain . Categorical variable ( gender ) proportion . Univariate analyze Comparison different variable group carry accord follow rule : Quantitative variable ( age ) distribute normally compare use test independent sample . Variables show normal distribution number day hospitalization two group compare use Mann-Whitney test . Categorical variable sex , compare use chi-squared test . Analysis correlation different variable use Pearson Spearman correlation base distribution type data . Weight height data IGFI compare subgroup accord change HtSDS since start growth hormone therapy baseline . A multivariate model Checking compliance level logistic regression model construct multivariate dependent variable high responsiveness low responsiveness dichotomous variable ( patient 80 % response variable receive 1 ( less 80 % ) receive value 0 ) . Independent variable different risk factor pass initial data analysis phase . All statistical test significance level alpha = 0.05 two-sided unless state otherwise . All pv value shall round two decimal place . Data analysis perform Microsoft SPSS version 22 .</detailed_description>
