	<brief_title>The Effects Exercise Training Community-dwelling Elderly With Sleep Disturbances With Follow-up</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This project conduct three year : In first year , investigator explore correlation sleep parameter , dietary behavior body composition community-dwelling elder . Two hundred elder recruit receive actigraph accelerometer recording , sleep quality questionnaire , bio-electrical impedance analysis , heart rate variability analysis , cognitive depression evaluation . Secondly , study evaluate efficacy possible mechanisms 24-week exercise training sleep disturbance patient . Sixty patient sleep disturbance elder randomize exercise group control group . Participants exercise group receive aerobic resistance exercise 3 time per week 24 week . The control receive sleep hygiene education consultation . All measurement perform described . Finally , 260 elder participate study receive 12-month follow-up assessment explore longitudinal impact sleep disturbance cardiorespiratory function , body composition metabolic function , long-term effect exercise training sleep disturbance patient .
