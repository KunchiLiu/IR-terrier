	<brief_title>Durvalumab Tremelimumab Treating Patients With Microsatellite Stable Metastatic Colorectal Cancer Liver</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . Establish safety durvalumab tremelimumab follow radioembolization selective internal radiation ( SIR ) -Spheres patient microsatellite stable ( MSS ) metastatic colorectal cancer liver . II . Determine hepatic response rate SIR-Spheres follow durvalumab tremelimumab patient MSS metastatic colorectal cancer liver . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . Estimate progression free survival ( PFS ) overall survival ( OS ) overall treated population . II . Describe overall response rate treat population . III . Describe extra-hepatic response treat population ( abscopal response ) . TERTIARY OBJECTIVES : I . Describe intra-tumor immune alteration follow SIR-Spheres , follow durvalumab plus tremelimumab comparison baseline serial hepatic metastasis biopsy . II . Describe immune alteration blood follow SIR-Spheres follow durvalumab plus tremelimumab . OUTLINE : Patients receive durvalumab intravenously ( IV ) 60 minute tremelimumab IV 60 minute day 1 . Treatment repeat every 4 week 4 course absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . Beginning week 17 , patient receive durvalumab IV 60 minute day 1 . Treatment repeat every 4 week 9 course absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . After completion study treatment , patient follow periodically .</detailed_description>
