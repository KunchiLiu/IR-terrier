	<brief_summary>The propose study design phase II open-label , control , randomize , multicenter , dose-escalation study safety , tolerability , efficacy single multiple application StrataGraft skin tissue alternative autografting promote heal excised full-thickness complex skin defect result acute traumatic skin loss . The propose study population include patient 49 % Total Body Surface Area ( TBSA ) complex skin defect include full-thickness component . The study design focus evaluation safety tolerability prolong exposure increase amount single multiple application StrataGraft skin tissue , also assess potential StrataGraft tissue promote heal full-thickness component complex skin defect alternative donor site harvest autografting . Targeted enrollment study 20 subject complex skin defect due acute traumatic skin loss require surgical excision autografting . Subjects sequentially enrol two cohort increase treatment area receive StrataGraft skin tissue .</brief_summary>
