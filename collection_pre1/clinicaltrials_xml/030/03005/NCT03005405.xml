	<brief_summary>This protocol aim assess cost-efficacy applicability treatment lesion moderate caries use sealant alternative restoration occlusal surface deciduous teeth . Initially , non-inferiority study design order verify sealing could non-inferior restoration . In case , could preferable since less invasive . Therefore , cost put forward analysis consider even reintervention follow-up ( cost-efficacy analysis ) . Finally , acceptability could another differential point treatment .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>This study aim evaluate cost-efficacy applicability treatment lesion moderate caries use sealant alternative restoration occlusal surface deciduous teeth . 96 child age 3-6 year select . Children must least one occlusal surface classify score 3 4 International Caries Detection Assessment System ( ICDAS ) . Children randomly allocate accord treatment : glass ionomer sealant restoration glass ionomer . After treatment , teeth assess clinically 6 , 12 , 18 24 month train blind examiner regard treatment receive . The need reintervention initially treat , either failure require repeating procedure progression caries lesion consider primary outcome . The secondary outcome chil 's acceptability treatment .</detailed_description>
