	<brief_title>Image Based Brachytherapy Locally Advanced Cervical Cancers - Randomized Controlled Trial</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The standard treatment locally advanced cervical cancer radio-chemotherapy include external beam radiotherapy ( EBRT ) , brachytherapy ( BT ) concomitant chemotherapy weekly Cisplatin . While image base conformal EBRT routinely use , prescription reporting BT still base specific dose point conventional radiography base surrogates tumour ( Manchester point A prescription point ) normal tissue [ International commission Radiation Units Measurements ( ICRU ) Bladder Rectum point ] . This conventional radiography base planning adopt universally ease deliver safe dos reasonably good local control rate ( stage IIB - 85 % ; Stage IIIB - 65 % ) acceptable acute late toxicity ( &lt; /=10 % grade III/IV ) . Thus , several decade conventional radiography base prescription standard care universally . But conventional radiography base surrogate prove rough estimate always correlate 3 dimensional ( 3D ) anatomy neither tumour normal tissue actual dos deliver outcomes term control rate toxicity respectively . Several study publish demonstrate limitation criticize point base treatment . In 2006 , work group Groupe Européen de Curiethérapie- European Society Therapeutic Radiology Oncology ( GEC-ESTRO ) publish recommendation contour tumour target organ risk ( OAR ) well dose volume parameter report image guide BT definitive radiotherapy locally advanced cervical cancer . These recommendation mainly derive retrospective single institution experience Magnetic Resonance ( MR ) image base Intracavitary Brachytherapy ( ICBT ) . The major advantage technique possibility conform dose give BT regard volume ( 3D ) tumour critical normal tissue ( bladder , rectum , sigmoid mainly ) . Thus , repetitive imaging perform BT treatment possible adapt dose give per anatomy individual patient take account position OAR also tumour regression often obtain precede EBRT chemotherapy . Clinical Outcome data Vienna , Paris Mumbai show potential improved local control rate acceptable toxicity far . Prospectively treat 100 patient image base brachytherapy Vienna Group show improved local control rate across stage decrease toxicity comparison historical series patient treat Conventional Radiography base BT [ 13-19 ] . Also , phase II multicentre intercontinental study use MR Image Based Brachytherapy ( EMBRACE : European study MRI-guided Brachytherapy Locally Advanced Cervical Cancer ) implement test various centre across world include Tata Memorial Hospital , Mumbai . Over 600 patient recruit study far . Based experience collect far , image base BT approach expect major impact clinical outcome II B III B ( increase local control rate 10-20 % ) concomitant decrease rate late normal tissue toxicity ( &lt; 5 % Grade ¾ ) , compare historical result point base conventional treatment prescription [ 20 ] . EMBRACE study MRI guide brachytherapy ( BT ) locally advanced cervical cancer . Today point-based two-dimensional BT often use definitive radiotherapy cervical cancer . However , MRI guide Image Based brachytherapy increasingly use several centre , result report far promise . The major advantage technique possibility conform dose give BT regard volume ( 3D ) time ( 4D ) . Thus , repetitive imaging perform BT implant possible adapt dose give BT anatomy individual patient take account position organ risk also tumour regression often obtain precede external beam radiotherapy chemotherapy . Based experience collect far , image base BT approach significantly improve dose-volume histogram ( DVH ) parameter improve dose deliver seem major impact clinical outcome concomitant decrease rate local failure morbidity . Preliminary result ongoing study include RETRO EMBRACE ( 600 patient - retrospective multicentric analysis ) EMBRACE ( 1000 patient recruit far prospectively multicentric ) also suggest excellent local control rate &amp; minimal clinical significant toxicity . Hypothesis : The clinical outcome radical radiation therapy include Conventional radiography base brachytherapy International Federation Gynecology Obstetrics ( FIGO ) Stage IIB IIIB report historical series 75 % 55 % local control rate grade ¾ rectal / bladder toxicity 10-15 % . With addition concomitant cisplatin chemotherapy additional local control benefit 5-10 % potentially increase late toxicity ( substantial evidence toxicity report far ) . With MR Image Based Brachytherapy approach , mono-institutional series phase II multicentric international study , result report far show improvement local control rate 96 % 86 % IIB IIIB respectively late toxicity &lt; 5 % report far . We propose randomize control study test follow hypothesis : With use MR Image Based Brachytherapy ( Study Arm ) locally advanced cervical cancer ( Stratified Stage IIB IIIB ) , absolute increase local control rate 10 % reduction late rectal bladder toxicity 5 % - 10 % compare Conventional radiography base ICBT . Thus , demonstrate absolute local control benefit 10 % Stages IIB ( 85 % 95 % ) Stage IIIB ( 65 % 75 % ) total 1050 patient ( 350 patient Stage IIB 650 patient stage IIB respectively ) accrue .</detailed_description>
