	<brief_title>Detection Circulating Tumor Tells The Guidance Neoadjuvant Chemotherapy Esophageal Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Background Esophageal carcinoma common digestive system tumor , number death rank No . 4 malignant tumor . Surgery preferred method treatment esophageal cancer , local recurrence rate high 40 % 60 % , 5-year overall survival 30 % . Most esophageal cancer find middle late stage , lose chance operation . Esophageal squamous cell carcinoma stage Ⅱ , III common China . The esophageal cancer stage longer localized lesion , cancer transfer organ body blood transmission , lead tumor metastasis , main cause patient ' death . The tumor cell invade surround tissue primary tumor cell enter blood lymphatic system , thus circulate tumor cell ( CTC ) form transported distal tissue , effuse , adapt new microenvironment finally forming metastasis process seeding , proliferation colonization . In recent year , liquid pathology , CTCs use several study tumor , include auxiliary diagnosis , recurrence metastasis detection , prognosis , individualized treatment , medical screening , development new targeted cancer therapy drug , search new target cancer therapy , explore mechanism drug resistance , etc . Recently , controversy surgical treatment esophageal carcinoma concentrate neoadjuvant therapy perioperative period . Neoadjuvant therapy widely study recent year . Compared postoperative radiochemotherapy , preoperative chemotherapy less toxic well tolerate . Pure radiotherapy could work local tumor , yet without lethal effect towards micrometastases CTCs . Studies show neoadjuvant radiotherapy improve resection rate , could prolong patient 's survival ; advantage neoadjuvant chemotherapy include : 1. low tumor stage , reduce tumor volume , increase resection rate ; 2. control treat tiny metastasis , reduce recurrence rate ; 3. chemotherapeutic drug reach tumor issue sufficient amount , undamaged blood supply system ; 4. assess chemosensitivity drug body guide postoperative treatment . NCCN guideline 2015 recommend patient esophageal squamous cell carcinoma T1b , N + T2-T4a , N0-N + may consider preoperative neoadjuvant therapy , support literature ( David Cunningham 2006 , Marc Ychou 2011 P. van Hagen , 2013 ) include patient pathology type adenocarcinoma . The esophageal cancer treatment guideline Japan 2015 adopt opinion NCCN Guidelines , recommend neoadjuvant chemotherapy radical surgery standard treatment stage II III esophageal cancer patient base result randomize controlled clinical trial JCOG9907 . However , guideline also point role neoadjuvant chemotherapy resectable T1-3N0-1M0 cancer remain unclear accord result meta-analysis . But least present study , compare direct surgery group , patient receive neoadjuvant therapy show inferior effect aspects radical surgery , postoperative complication , disease-free survival overall survival . The effect necessity neoadjuvant chemotherapy esophageal squamous cell carcinoma patient stage Ⅱ , Ⅲ , influence disease-free survival still lack authoritative evidence-based medical support , clinical urgency need solve . Research objectives Choose detection peripheral venous blood CTCs disease-free survival main index , compare treatment effect patient , receive neoadjuvant therapy , surgery receive directly surgery , postoperative chemotherapy esophageal squamous cell carcinoma stage Ⅱ , III mean evidence-based medicine ; Define indication neoadjuvant chemotherapy treatment esophageal squamous cell carcinoma stage Ⅱ , III ; Draft solution evaluate treatment effect neoadjuvant chemotherapy esophageal cancer stage Ⅱ , III , indication neoadjuvant chemotherapy test peripheral venous blood CTCs join Chinese clinical guideline . Main research content : Design dual-center ( Second Hospital Shandong University Shandong Cancer Hospital Affiliated Shandong University ) prospective clinical contrast trial select preoperative patient esophageal squamous cell carcinoma clinical stage Ⅱ , III . Complete work patient screen , informed consent , preoperative preparation , surgery , neoadjuvant chemotherapy follow-up visit guide Standardized treatment program . Detect CTCs extract peripheral venous blood time day initial treatment ( neoadjuvant chemotherapy surgery ) , one week surgery follow-up visit 3 month , 6 month , 1 year , 2years surgery . The main evaluation index study change CTCs peripheral blood survival period disease-free patient , secondary evaluation index include surgery effect , pathology , recurrence rate patient , long-term survival well prognostic indicator . Assess guidance CTCs detection towards neoadjuvant chemotherapy treatment esophageal squamous carcinoma stage Ⅱ , III .</detailed_description>
