	<brief_title>Brown Seaweed Extract Glycemic Control Body Weight</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Diets produce low glucose insulin response may reduce diabetes cardiovascular risk . They may also facilitate weight control promote satiety , insulin sensitivity optimal insulin secretion meal . Food ingredient may indeed reduce postprandial glucose insulin response inhibition α-amylase α-glucosidase activity may slow absorption carbohydrate . InSea2® unique combination polyphenolic extract brown algae ( Ascophyllum nodosum Fucus vesiculosus ) show inhibit action α-amylase α-glucosidase . Preliminary data healthy men woman demonstrate reduce effect plasma insulin single intake InSea2® consume high-carbohydrate meal . The main objective evaluate effect daily dietary supplement 500 mg ( 2 capsule ) brown algae extract powder ( InSea2® ) blood glucose measure 2 hour oral glucose tolerance test ( OGTT ) overweight insulin-resistant men woman . The secondary objective assess contribution daily consumption supplement ( InSea2® ) weight loss associate daily caloric restriction 500 kcal due individualize nutritional intervention . More specifically , investigator aim evaluate effect supplementation combine weight loss marker glucose metabolism ( fast plasma glucose , glucose insulin response OGTT , insulin sensitivity measurement parameter insulin secretion OGTT ) , lipid profile , blood pressure metabolic syndrome criterion . The investigator expect InSea2® lower high level blood glucose insulin observe 2 hour meal overweight insulin-resistant human subject .</detailed_description>
