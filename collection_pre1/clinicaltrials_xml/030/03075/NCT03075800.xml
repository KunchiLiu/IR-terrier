	<detailed_description>Despite significant advance pharmacological treatment , many individual severe mental illness ( SMI ) schizophrenia bipolar disorder continue experience significant impairment crucial life area employment , housing , social functioning , daily living skill . In addition , many individual significant level psychotic , mood , negative symptom , prone frequent relapse re-hospitalizations . Psychosocial treatment need improve illness management function beyond limited effect medication . However , relatively psychosocial evidence-based practice ( EBPs ) exist people SMI small percentage people could benefit treatment actually receive . At federal level , implementation dissemination EBPs people SMI major policy priority research objective . Assertive Community Treatment ( ACT ) Overview . ACT one five psychosocial treatment people SMI designate EBP SAMHSA . Since inception , ACT grown single , experimental research treatment program essential element within service continuum public mental health system people SMI . ACT program typically serve consumer severe symptoms great disability support need ( e.g. , high rate homelessness hospitalization ) , difficult engage retain standard outpatient program . Research ACT extensive , 25 RCTs . Literature review consistently conclude ACT effective standard community mental health service demonstrate effectiveness reduce psychiatric hospitalization , improve community tenure , retention treatment , high consumer family satisfaction service . However , ACT less effective improve symptom management , social functioning , functional outcome , need adapt well facilitate recovery . ACT cost-effective compare standard case management widely disseminate 300 ACT program least 41 state . Illness Management Recovery ( IMR ) Overview . The Illness Management Recovery ( IMR ) program well-suited enhance outcome area less effectively address ACT : symptom management community function . IMR also one five psychosocial EBPs identify SAMHSA adult SMI . IMR program widely implement across U.S. country , researcher conduct number open clinical trial quasi-experimental study . Recently , three RCTs conduct , support effectiveness group-based IMR implement outpatient mental health clinic support housing . These study show significant positive outcome IMR , include symptom reduction , improve functioning , increase knowledge mental illness , progress toward personal recovery goal . Although positive result support effectiveness IMR , several gap limitation apparent grow area practice research . First , although IMR implement clinically symptomatic consumer , inpatient residential setting , control research IMR focus outpatient setting , involve consumer tend less symptomatic high function typically serve ACT team . Second , provide IMR outpatient clinic restrict ability clinician teach consumer skill natural community venue , could improve acquisition new skill relate functional gain . Third , research IMR mainly limit group modality , hence , little known effect IMR provide individual group format . Integrating IMR ACT . Several characteristic ACT suggest excellent platform integrate implement IMR program . By design , ACT program serve people great need tend drop standard outpatient program ; thus , integrate IMR ACT potential improve illness self-management consumer need . The individualized assertive outreach nature ACT service also allow IMR deliver individual group modality , vivo practice ACT empower consumer learn practice IMR skills natural setting . Finally , ACT principle work family natural support facilitate involvement support help consumer well manage SMI achieve recovery goal . IMR also serve important potential service partner ACT . ACT criticize recovery-oriented . The integration IMR may enhance grow recovery philosophy ACT team provide specific approach promote illness self-management recovery integrate routine service . IMR also improve limited effectiveness ACT team reduce symptom improve social independent functioning . We also speculate ( plan test subsequent , large R01 research program ) provide IMR accelerate graduation consumer ACT , thereby increase number slot available new consumer need scarce resource , enhance cost-effectiveness . Thus , integration ACT IMR potential significantly benefit consumer SMI , increase efficiency ACT model . Despite potential benefit , substantial challenge integrate IMR ACT team . IMR develop use primarily traditional treatment setting , mobile community treatment approach ( e.g . ACT ) . In practice , many ACT clinician find time devote respond daily crisis acute case management need ; ACT staff member often difficulty make time learning implement learning-based recovery-oriented intervention . Most critically , standardize guideline implement IMR within ACT , make integration two EBPs even challenge . A ACT team , however , foreseen promise integrate IMR ACT . Using nonequivalent group design , Garfinkle Storch find ACT consumer IMR treatment show number positive outcome compare ACT consumer without IMR service 11 month , include low hospitalization rate , improve retention housing competitive employment , work toward personal recovery goal . Salyers colleague conduct small single group , pre-post pilot study evaluate feasibility use peer specialist train IMR ACT team , find consumer receive IMR improve significantly measure recovery , trend toward increase knowledge mental illness , consumer staff satisfaction IMR service . In second study , Salyers colleague randomly assign two four ACT team IMR training service ( use peer mental health specialist staff IMR service delivery ) . They report two-year period , ACT+IMR team achieve moderate fidelity IMR , rate penetration low , 25 % consumer exposure IMR . However , secondary analysis find ACT consumer receive IMR show significant reduction hospitalization incarceration , improvement illness self-management . The lack well develop guideline implement IMR undoubtedly limit effectiveness program Salyers ' project . Fortunately , lesson learn study , well SAMHSA EBP study IMR present project team 's practice research experience ACT IMR , suggest number adaptation IMR successfully integrate ACT service . We plan develop implement follow promising strategy integrate two EBPs project : ( 1 ) develop adapt manual , training resource , fidelity scale specific implement IMR within ACT , ( 2 ) provide intensive initial follow-up booster clinician training , ( 3 ) provide regularly schedule clinical supervision IMR within ACT team , addition regularly schedule outside consultation IMR+ACT expert project startup , ( 4 ) create organizational culture support champion integration IMR within ACT , ( 5 ) cross-train ACT staff support consumer 's participation IMR , ( 6 ) create several specific , strategic adaptation ACT team operation protocol facilitate practice IMR within daily ACT service activity . We expect implementation strategy result integrated IMR+ACT program yield positive outcome consumer mental health service delivery system .</detailed_description>
