The control group ( n≤19 ) receive normal hospital food without enrichment dietary counseling discharge . In group follow data obtain : record protein intake , anthropometric measurement ( weight , height , body composition estimate bioimpedance ) , functional ability ( De Morton Mobility Index ( DEMMI ) Barthels ADL-index ) , hand grip strength , sarkopenic status ( SARC-F ) , quality life ( EQ-5D-3L ) , length stay ( LOS ) readmission ( within 30 day discharge ) .

Assessments perform baseline , day discharge 4 week discharge ( follow ) . The primary outcome change protein intake Baseline 4 week discharge . The hypothesis serve individually select protein enrich snack/dish morning bedtime hospitalization result higher protein intake hospitalization experience combine dietary counseling discharge , result higher protein intake 28 day discharge . Further , hypothesize increase protein intake affect functional level , hand grip strength , sarcopenic status quality life geriatric patient lead short LOS few readmission frequency .</brief_summary>
