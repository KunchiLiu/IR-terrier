	<brief_title>Central Mechanisms Chronic Pain Fatigue Subtitle : Functional Imaging Brain Spinal Cord</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Chronic fatigue ( ME/CFS ) fibromyalgia syndrome ( FM ) chronic musculoskeletal pain disorder predominantly afflict woman . Frequently associate insomnia , cognitive abnormality , fatigue may lead early disability . No consistent soft tissue abnormality identify far patient . The cause disorder unknown , highly effective treatment available current method diagnosis imprecise unreliable . The Investigators previously use quantitative sensory test improve upon diagnose disorder supplement current procedure manipulating define pressure point hand note presence absence pain . The quantitative method evaluation involve repetitive application brief , non-injurious thermal/mechanical stimulation normally produce moderate degree temporal summation sensation intensity . The patient normal control subject verbally rate magnitude late sensation elicit stimulus , use numerical scale . Chronic pain patient result , least partially , exaggerated activation central N-methyl-D-aspartate ( NMDA ) receptor result enhance input unmyelinated peripheral afferent nerve fiber supply deep tissue . Temporal summation second pain lead central sensitization subsequent sign hyperalgesia allodynia . Functional brain image ME/CFS FM patient , propose study , use document rating repetitive experimental stimulus result pain augmentation . Successful completion study provide new method evaluation chronic pain/fatigue mechanism response therapy .</detailed_description>
