	<brief_summary>Glioblastoma ( GB ) common form brain cancer adult . Despite current treatment option include surgery , radiotherapy chemotherapy , overall survival poor . Therefore , treatment option explore increase interest possibility use ketogenic diet ( KD ) , alongside current treatment option . The KD high fat , low carbohydrate diet . This encourage body use fat ( broken ketone ) primary energy source , instead carbohydrate ( broken glucose , type sugar ) . KDs consider use patient GB type cancer think use glucose main energy supply , short supply diet . Animal study show KDs may make GB responsive radiotherapy chemotherapy could improve survival slow cancer 's growth . However , clinical study need human assess possible benefit . This trial see patient randomly assign one two type KDs ; modify ketogenic diet ( MKD ) medium chain triglyceride ketogenic diet ( MCT ) . Both diet follow high fat , low carbohydrate principle , MCT diet require patient take fat supplement drink instead food . Patients follow diet 12 week initially . The trial look enroll newly diagnose GB patient , The Walton Centre NHS Foundation Trust 12 month period . The aim trial investigate protocol feasibility patient impact compare two KDs NHS setting , view inform future phase III clinical trial .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Ketogenic Diets Adjuvant Therapy Glioblastoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>A prospective , non-blinded , randomize , pilot study undertaken patient glioblastoma ( GB ) . Patients randomize modified ketogenic diet ( MKD ) medium chain triglyceride ketogenic diet ( MCT ) 12 week period ( primary completion ) . If patient wish remain diet , offer dietetic support total 12 month ( secondary completion ) . The trial open Walton Centre Foundation Trust patient newly diagnose GB , undergone surgical resection go onto receive adjuvant chemoradiotherapy . Patients refer via neuro-oncology multi-disciplinary meeting neurosurgical clinic , post histology . The diet offer alongside standard care , commence post surgical resection ( histology confirm ) prior commence chemoradiotherapy . Both diet high fat low carbohydrate , contain different type amount fat . The MKD 80 % fat ( predominately long chain fatty acid ) 5 % carbohydrate , whilst MCT diet 75 % fat ( 30 % medium chain fatty acid ) 10 % carbohydrate . A permuted block randomization method adopt , use 'sealedenvelope ' randomization system . This set administer statistician , involved recruiting patient . Patients receive regular input trial dietitian . This include clinical consultation baseline , dietary initiation , week 6 , week 12 every 3 month thereafter telephone consultation week 1 , 3 9 . Patients receive dietary ketone monitoring education . Assessments monitor undertaken consultation include anthropometry , biochemistry , compliance , tolerance , acceptability , quality life ketosis . Informed consent obtain prior enrollment patient may withdraw time .</detailed_description>
