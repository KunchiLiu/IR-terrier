	<brief_summary>The outcome prior clinical evaluation study device , include successfully treat 99 % ( 84/85 ) intend target vessel 96 % ( 27/28 ) limb patency observe one year , demonstrate potential benefit device . When contrasted open repair 's significant complication rate branch fenestrated device 's significant anatomic logistic limitation , potential risk propose novel graft outweigh potential benefit widen anatomic availability improve patency rate . Given potential benefit , investigator feel justified expose target patient population potential risk . The non-clinical testing perform Medtronic clinical result report Sanford Health show adequate safety device support early feasibility study . The investigator would like perform early feasibility study define control protocol collect prospective preliminary safety device functionality data . The investigator believe early feasibility study appropriate novel approach . The limited sample size allow adequate patient data collect control protocol without expose large patient population risk associate novel device design .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Visceral Manifold Study Repair TAAA</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This study prospective , single-center , non-randomized , single-arm study evaluate therapeutic benefit TAAA Debranching Stent Graft System . A total 15 patient enrol study . - 10 subject total treat primary study arm - 5 subject total treat expanded selection arm The duration Investigation anticipate follow : - Time Complete Enrollment : 24 month - Subject Follow-up Time : 5 year last subject enrollment - Total Duration Time : 7 year The primary objective clinical investigation `` Visceral Manifold Study repair thoracoabdominal aortic aneurysm '' ass use TAAA Debranching Stent Graft System repair thoracoabdominal aortic aneurysm patient appropriate anatomy . The primary intent study assess safety acutely ( i.e . freedom major adverse event ( MAE ) 30 day ) preliminary effectiveness ( i.e. , treatment success technical success ) device acutely ( i.e. , proportion treatment group subject achieve maintain treatment success one year ) . Additionally , study assess technical success treatment success follow-up interval .</detailed_description>
