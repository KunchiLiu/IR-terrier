	<brief_summary>This retrospective external validation study novel in-vitro diagnostic ( IVD ) assay include review medical chart 4500 pediatric patient ImmunoXpert™ test take part routine workup acute febrile illness . The investigated assay require measurement three host-related , blood-based , protein bio-markers integrate use formula single score . Based score , patient classify one three category : ( ) bacterial ( ii ) viral ( iii ) marginal equivocal immune response ( inconclusive non-infectious ) . statistical analysis perform compare ImmunoXpert™ accuracy current practice lab test ( e.g . WBC , CRP , PCT ) clinical suspicion time requisition . Enrolled patient manage accord current standard care per standard institutional procedure .</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Patients age 3 month 18 year admit due acute febrile illness , ImmunoDx test take part workup . The febrile illness also fulfill follow criterion : The patient peak temperature ≥38°C ( AND ) Symptoms initiate ≤ 7 day sample ( AND ) A retrospective diagnosis bacterial viral mixed infection anonymously determine panel three independent senior pediatrician . The noninfectious disease control group include : A retrospective diagnosis noninfectious disease anonymously determine panel three independent senior pediatrician physician . Patients noninfectious disease ( ImmunoDx test wrongly take ) Samples patient one follow criterion exclude study : Another infection episode last 3 week sample Congenital immune deficiency ( CID ) A proven suspect HIV1 , HBV , HCV infection Active hematological malignancy Current treatment immunesuppressive immunemodulating therapy include without limitation : Use high dose steroid &gt; 1 mg/kg/day prednisone equivalent last two week Monoclonal antibody administration Intravenous immunoglobulin ( IVIG ) Other illness affect life expectancy and/or quality life</criteria>
