	<brief_title>Comparision Retinal Surgery Three-dimensional Heads-up Display Standard Operating Microscope</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Prospective , cross-sectional , observational study . Patient undergo vitreoretinal surgery variety indication include , limited , epiretinal membrane ( ERM ) , macular hole , vitreous opacity , vitreous hemorrhage , aphakia , dislocate displaced intraocular crystalline lens , rhegmatogenous retinal detachment , tractional retinal detachment . In prospective , single-center , unmasked cross-sectional , observational case series , minimum 100 consecutive eye undergo 23- , 25- , 27-gauge 3-port par plana vitrectomy ( PPV ) Constellation Vision System ( Alcon Laboratories , HÃ¼nenberg , Switzerland ) use either NGENUITY 3D HUD surgery platform standard operate microscope ( OPMI Lumera 700 surgical microscope ReSight ( Carl Zeiss AG , Gena , Germany ) , 1:1 randomization . Surgical gauge dictate operating surgeon preference . Informed consent obtain patient enrolled accordance Declaration Helsinki applicable HIPPA regulation . All surgery digitally record ( routinely do educational purpose ) video data store password-protected , encrypted external hard-disk drive . These drive store secure , lock cabinet Research Department Retina Service use . All surgery perform 2 surgeon ( AH JH ) . Those randomized 3D HUD surgery undergo PPV 3D high dynamic range camera ( ICM5 ) , specialized image processing software ( Version 9.5.4 ; TrueWare , Santa Barbara , CA ) , 46 '' high-definition ( 1980x1024 pixel ) liquid crystal display ( GD-463D10 , Yokohama , Japan ) . During surgery 3D HUD , surgeon wear passive 3-D polarized glass position approximately 1.5 display . Iris aperture image gain standardize unchanged case perform 3D HUD . Enrolled patient monitor post-operative day 1 , week 1 , month 1 , month 3 measure visual acuity , undergo optical coherence tomography ( OCT ) clinically indicate , examination document anterior segment dilate funduscopic examination finding . Patients undergoing epiretinal membrane ( ERM ) internal limit membrane ( ILM ) removal either macular pucker macular hole repair subject disease-specific surgical protocol examine potential difference macular surgery 3D HUD traditional microscope visualization . These patient undergo 25-gauge 3-port PPV 1:1 randomization either visualization 3D HUD standard operate microscope . Indocyanine green ( ICG ) vital dye ( ** % solution ) inject 0.1 cc aliquot stain ILM infusion cannula clamp 60 second allow dye stain ILM . Endoillumination level initially set 1 % increase 1 % interval operate surgeon note enough illumination proceed ERM/ILM peeling . ILM peel performed boundary retinal vascular arcade duration membrane peeling document . If operating surgeon request increase endoilluminaton power membrane peeling , increase value record . The number macular hemorrhage contusion induce direct forcep trauma well iatrogenic retinal break sustain membrane peeling also record . Data Collection Demographic data , diagnosis , clinical presentation , history record patient initial examination do course routine care . Data element include age , race , date birth , date evaluation , medical record number , chief complaint , past ocular history , past medical history , visual acuity , anterior segment exam finding ( i.e . ocular surface disease , lens status , etc . ) , funduscopic exam , preoperative imaging testing ( OCT , FAF , Fundus Photography ) . Intraoperative endoillumination level record . Recorded surgical video file follow-up status compile patient various metric record include total operative time , time ILM/ERM peeling , number ICG aliquot require visualize ILM , intraoperative complication . Baseline follow data also include visual acuity , anterior segment funduscopic examination , OCT data applicable . Other data collect include subjective physician survey use two visualization system , include quality visualization 10-point scale , perceive subjective difficulty vitreoretinal visualization , overall ergonomic comfort 10-point scale . Human Subjects Informed Consent The tenet Declaration Helsinki follow write informed consent obtain time patient enrollment . Patients also provide lay explanation study goal protocol . The decision enroll study entirely elective patient reimburse participation . The PHI privacy subject maintain strict adherence HIPPA Wills Eye Institute policy . The aforementioned data store prospectively patient enrol . All data upon collection cod de-identified . Codes create consecutive patient via random number generator . All data store computer store ecrypted hard drive within ecrypted password protect Microsoft Excel file accessible member study team . De-identified data link medical record number date birth . No patient identifier record</detailed_description>
