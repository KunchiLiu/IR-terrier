	<brief_title>A Phase II Study SGI-110 Philadelphia-Negative Myeloproliferative Neoplasms</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The active metabolite SGI-110 ( 2'-deoxy-5-azacytidylyl- ( 3'→5 ' ) -2'-deoxyguanosine sodium salt ) , dinucleotide , decitabine , FDA-approved agent treatment myelodysplastic syndrome . SGI-110 resistant modification cytidine deaminase , common pathway decitabine metabolism deactivation [ 1 ] . The molecular weight SGI-110 decitabine 580 Da 228 Da , respectively . Therefore , molar equivalent dose 1 mg decitabine approximately 2.5 mg SGI-110 . SGI-110 's activity demonstrate preclinical pharmacodynamic assay use demonstrate decitabine 's efficacy e.g. , re-expression p15 , p16 , MLH1 induction fetal hemoglobin , vivo . In xenograft study , SGI-110 demonstrate promising preclinical activity hematologic solid tumor . In vitro evidence suggest SGI-110 longer half-life decitabine presence cytidine deaminase . These promising observation suggest SGI-110 may improve pharmaceutical property biological activity could extend decitabine 's current clinical utility . SGI-110 show well tolerated mouse decitabine effective vivo induce p16 expression , reduce DNA methylation p16 promoter region , retard EJ6 human bladder cancer tumor growth athymic mouse [ 2 ] . SGI-110 develop subcutaneous administration . SGI-110 pharmacologically active vitro vivo variety tumor cell murine xenograft model administer subcutaneously . Treatment well tolerate via subcutaneous route murine xenograft . When administer subcutaneously non-human primate , SGI-110 release decitabine slowly compare specie , possibly prolong effect long period . SGI-110 develop non-aqueous formulation ensure formulation stability . SGI-110 studied first-in-human , single-agent study ( SGI-110-01 ) .5 This study Phase 1/2 , dose escalation , multicenter study two subcutaneous regimen SGI-110 subject intermediate high-risk myelodysplastic syndrome ( MDS ) acute myeloid leukemia ( AML ) . This study two part , Dose Escalation Segment Dose Expansion Segment . The study evaluate biological activity , preliminary safety , efficacy SGI-110 two dose schedule intermediate high risk MDS relapse refractory AML subject , Dose Expansion Segment evaluate safety efficacy recommend dose . The study base 3 + 3 design within regimen . Eligible subject randomize receive 1 2 dose regimen SGI-110 follow start dos : Regimen 1 : 3 mg/m2/day subcutaneously Days 1-5 28-day course , Regimen 2 : 6 mg/m2 subcutaneously Weekly x 3 Days 1 , 8 , 15 28-day course . The minimum dose achieve maximal biological activity biologically effective dose ( BED ) daily regimen reach 60 mg/m2 daily Days 1-5 . Study disease : MPN Philadelphia chromosome negative Myeloproliferative Neoplasms ( PHN-MPN ) comprise group myeloid neoplasms vary clinical , morphologic laboratory feature wide range survival . According 2008 World Health Organization ( WHO ) classification , MDS/MPN overlap syndrome include chronic myelomonocytic leukemia ( CMML ) , atypical chronic myeloid leukemia ( aCML ) , juvenile myelomonocytic leukemia ( JMML ) myelodysplastic/myeloproliferative neoplasm unclassifiable ( MDS/MPN-U ) . In recent retrospective study MD Anderson Cancer Center , median survival patient diagnosis MDS/MPN unclassifiable 12.4 month [ 3 ] .There effective therapy PHN-MPN represent unmet medical need . The MDS/MPN overlap syndromes present wide range hematological clinical manifestation individual patient may exhibit combination feature characteristic MDS MPN . For example , transfusion-dependent anemia generally present , hematological laboratory abnormality range leukopenia leukocytosis thrombocytopenia thrombocytosis . Unlike MDS , significant splenomegaly often present patient PHN-MPN . Also , patient may constellation constitutional finding , include fatigue , weight loss , anorexia , night sweat unpleasant symptom lead generally poor quality life . Thus , improve overall survival critical goal therapy , effective therapy group patient include also agent demonstrate improve many disease-related clinical issue possible . Overall Study Design This single arm , open-label study SGI-110 patient MPN . SGI-110 administer subcutaneously dose 60 mg/m2 day 1-5 , repeat every 28 day . Toxicity evaluate use NCI Common Terminology Criteria Adverse Events Active Version 4 . The frequency toxicity per organ system tabulate use descriptive statistic . All patient receive amount study drug evaluable toxicity . Screening pre-treatment criterion Screening Procedures Screening procedure test perform within 14 day treatment administration exception inform consent , bone marrow biopsy may perform within 28 day first dose study drug . - Provision write informed consent . The ICF must sign dated subject collection sample performance study-specific evaluation . - Complete medical history , include demographic ( date birth , sex , race ) . A disease history , include date initial diagnosis list prior treatment responses treatment , also record . Concurrent medical sign symptom must document establish baseline condition . - Record concomitant medication . - Record study-procedure relate AEs time informed consent treatment-emergent AEs start study drug administration ( Course 1 , Day 1 ) 30 day last dose study drug . - Investigator 's confirmation eligibility . Perform necessary procedure evaluation document subject meet eligibility criterion . - Complete physical exam include weight examination - Vital sign include rest systolic/diastolic blood pressure , rest heart rate , rest respiration rate , body temperature pulse oximetry . Assess subject rest sit position least three minute . - ECOG performance status . - 12-lead ECG ( rhythm , atrial rate , ventricular rate , PR interval , QRS duration , QT/QTc ( QtcF ) , morphology overall interpretation ) . - Height . - Sample collection clinical laboratory test ( hematology , chemistry urinalysis ) . - Serum urine pregnancy test : female subject child-bearing potential . Results must negative subject eligible enrollment study . Agent Administration • SGI-110 administer dose level 60 mg/m2 SC daily Days 1-5 28-day cycle . However , treatment delay allow per section 6.3.1 SGI-110 administer SC injection preferably abdominal area . The total amount ( mg ) SGI-110 administer determine base body surface area ( BSA ) . In calculate BSA , actual height weight use . There adjustments `` ideal '' body weight . The institutional standard calculate BSA acceptable . Dose adjustment make +/- 10 % weight change begin cycle The site ( ) SGI-110 SC injection capture dose CRF . Investigators prohibit supply SGI-110 subject properly enrol study physician scientist except designate sub-investigators Food Drug Administration ( FDA ) Form 1572 . The investigator must ensure subject receive SGI-110 personnel fully understand procedure administer study treatment . Duration Therapy Duration therapy depend individual response , evidence disease progression tolerance . In absence treatment delay due adverse event , treatment may continue one follow criterion applies : - Disease progression acute leukemia unless , opinion principal investigator , subject experience clinical benefit SGI-110 despite laboratory evidence progression acute leukemia . - Intercurrent illness prevents administration treatment , - Unacceptable adverse event ( ) - Participant demonstrate inability unwillingness comply medication regimen and/or documentation requirement - Participant decide withdraw study - General specific change participant 's condition render participant unacceptable treatment opinion treat investigator . Duration Follow Up Participants follow monthly six month removal study death , whichever occur first . Participants remove study unacceptable adverse event follow resolution stabilization adverse event . Post-study case report form capture information include subsequent treatment , response subsequent therapy , survival . Anticipated Toxicities Adverse Event List ( ) SGI-110 The common AEs suspect investigator Study SGI-110-01 related drug observe date MDS/AML population : injection site pain , fatigue , nausea , thrombocytopenia , anemia diarrhea . Based mechanism action drug active form decitabine , myelosuppression ( neutropenia , thrombocytopenia , anemia ) relate consequence infection ( e.g . pneumonia ) , sepsis , bleed likely risk drug . Mucositis also report . Pain burn injection site report related dose volume injection well speed injection . Care must take avoid intradermal injection . Ice pack apply prior injection SGI-110 drug inject slowly , 30-60 second . If injection site event report subsequent injection despite slow injection use ice pack , pre-treatment topical systemic analgesic consider .</detailed_description>
