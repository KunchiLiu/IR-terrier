	<brief_title>Homeostatic Non-homeostatic Processing Food Cues Anorexia Nervosa</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Anorexia nervosa ( AN ) eat disorder high morbidity lifetime mortality . This eat disorder mainly characterize restrict food intake despite severely low body weight . Given pronounce self-starvation AN , investigation homeostatic food processing , interaction reward system great scientific interest . Previous research AN patient almost exclusively focused cortical , non-homeostatic ( e.g. , reward relate ) food processing . Therefore , primary aim present study investigate metabolic gut-brain signal focus responsivity hypothalamus ( i.e. , core region homeostatic control ) mesocorticolimbic reward system . A secondary aim study interaction mesocorticolimbic reward system homeostatic ( i.e. , hypothalamus ) system . Metabolic gut-brain signaling assess apply single-blind , randomize , crossover design intragastric infusion glucose water . This approach allow study gut-brain signal hypothalamus reward system control sensory aspect food intake ( sight , smell , taste ) AN patient healthy control . Furthermore , measure cognitive strategy control desire visual food cue ( top-down control ) affect mesocorticolimbic hypothalamic system AN patient differently healthy control . The interaction hypothalamus mesocorticolimbic reward system investigate use effective connectivity analysis . Functional magnetic resonance image high spatial resolution optimize protocol investigation hypothalamus mesocorticolimbic reward system use study first time homeostatic non-homeostatic food cue process AN patient .</detailed_description>
