	<brief_summary>This research study study pair immunotherapy possible treatment malignant pleural mesothelioma . The drug involve study : - Durvalumab - Tremelimumab</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Phase 2 Study Durvalumab Combination With Tremelimumab Malignant Pleural Mesothelioma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This research study Phase II clinical trial . Phase II clinical trial test safety effectiveness investigational drug learn whether drug work treat specific disease . `` Investigational '' mean drug study . The FDA ( U.S. Food Drug Administration ) approve durvalumab tremelimumab treatment disease . In research study , investigator study study drug help cancer compare usual approach treat malignant pleural mesothelioma . Durvalumab drug block protein often produce cancer cell surround cell suppress immune cell attack cancer cell . Tremelimumab block receptor immune cell normally suppress immune attack . These two study drug use alone mesothelioma combination yet test mesothelioma . These two drug use cancer melanoma effective use either drug alone .</detailed_description>

( Bone metastases consider measurable . ) Prior radiation site measurable disease make participant ineligible unless lesion demonstrate grow completion radiation therapy . Participants must willing able undergo biopsy start study ontreatment biopsy safe feasible . Participants must least 28 day major surgery . ECOG performance status 0 1 . Subjects must adequate hematologic , renal , organ marrow function Age 18 year old Female subject childbearing potential sexually active non sterilize male partner must agree use least one highly effective method contraception time screen must agree continue use precaution 180 day last dose investigational product . Male partner female subject must also agree use male condom plus spermicide throughout period . Cessation birth control point discuss responsible physician . Not engage sexual activity total duration trial drug washout period acceptable practice ; however , occasional abstinence , rhythm method , withdrawal method acceptable method contraception . Female patient refrain breastfeed throughout period . Females childbearing potential define surgically sterile ( i.e. , bilateral tubal ligation , bilateral oophorectomy , complete hysterectomy ) postmenopausal ( define great equal 12 month menses without alternative medical cause ) Nonsterilized male subject sexually active female partner childbearing potential must use male condom plus spermicide screen 180 day last dose investigational product .

Ability understand willingness sign write informed consent document Subject willing able comply protocol duration study include undergoing treatment schedule visit examination include follow Previous treatment immune checkpoint inhibitor , CTLA4 , PD1 , PDL1 , include prior treatment either durvalumab tremelimumab Known central nervous system metastasis . Patients know brain metastasis , spinal cord compression , carcinomatous meningitis , leptomeningeal disease may enrol treat , longer take corticosteroid , stable image least 3 week Subjects currently receive systemic corticosteroid 10 mg per day 14 day ; subject receive systemic immunosuppressive drug 14 day . Exceptions include : inhaled , intranasal , ophthalmic , topical corticosteroid , local corticosteroid injection ( e.g. , intraarticular injection ) , subject require corticosteroid premedication hypersensitivity reaction ( e.g . CT scan premedication ) Subjects medical condition require chronic use systemic corticosteroid . Exceptions include : inhaled , intranasal , ophthalmic , topical corticosteroid , local corticosteroid injection ( e.g. , intraarticular injection ) , subject require corticosteroid premedication hypersensitivity reaction ( e.g . CT scan premedication ) Active prior document autoimmune disease within past 2 year , include limited systemic lupus erythematosus , sarcoidosis syndrome , Wegener 's granulmatosis . NOTE : Subjects vitiligo , Grave 's disease , psoriasis require systemic treatment within past 2 year exclude . Active prior document inflammatory bowel disease ( e.g. , Crohn 's disease , ulcerative colitis , celiac disease , diverticulitis ) , chronic , serious gastrointestinal condition associate diarrhea . NOTE : Subjects know diverticulosis permit enroll . History interstitial lung disease pneumonitis require steroid administration . History primary immunodeficiency History allogeneic organ transplant History hypersensitivity tremelimumab , durvalumab , excipient Known history active tuberculosis Receipt live attenuate vaccination within 30 day prior study entry within 30 day receive durvalumab tremelimumab Participants history second primary malignancy . Exceptions include : patient history malignancy treat curatively recur within 5 year prior study entry ; resect basal squamous cell carcinoma skin , completely resect carcinoma situ type . Participants chemotherapy , biologic therapy , investigational therapy within 21 day ( include bevizumab ) radiotherapy within 7 day prior enter study recover adverse event due agent administer Any history prior immunerelated adverse event ( irAE ) least great grade 3 receive previous immunotherapy agent . Participants receive investigational agent . Uncontrolled intercurrent illness include , limited : Ongoing active infection Gastritis Symptomatic congestive heart failure Severe hypertension ( define BP least great than160/100 screening period despite optimal medical management ) Unstable angina pectoris Cardiac arrhythmia Active bleeding diatheses Active peptic ulcer disease Psychiatric illness/social situation would limit compliance study requirement Mean QT interval correct heart rate ( QTc ) â‰¥470 m calculate 3 electrocardiogram ( ECGs ) use Fredericia 's Correction Known past present medical history HIVpositive Subjects know acute chronic hepatitis B hepatitis C. Pregnant woman exclude study tremelimumab durvalumab unknown effect develop fetus . Because unknown potential risk adverse event nurse infant secondary treatment mother tremelimumab durvalumab , breastfeed woman also exclude . Female subject child bear potential must negative serum pregnancy test obtain prior trial registration . Subjects involve plan and/or conduct study ( applies AstraZeneca staff and/or staff study site ) . Subjects undergone pneumonectomy due know potential pulmonary toxicity heighten risk complication .</criteria>
