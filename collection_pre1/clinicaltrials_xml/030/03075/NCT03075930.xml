	<brief_summary>This single centre prospective data registry . In study atrial conduction characteristic extend surface Electrocardiograms ( esECG ) , biomarkers genetic analysis perform ablation , discharge 3 month catheter ablation atrial fibrillation ( AF ) compare routine clinical follow-up data . The objective registry establish data registry patient undergoing ablation AF . Supplementary routine clinical diagnostic esECG analysis biomarkers perform compare clinical outcome data .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Electro anatomical remodelling atrium due age structural heart disease lead AF turn lead cardiac electrical structural remodelling . In case advance remodelling restoration sinus rhythm ( SR ) become difficult result catheter ablation disappointing . Furthermore , valid parameter predict diagnose recurrence AF SR successful ablation , repeat long-term electrocardiogram ( ECG ) recording perform detect asymptomatic AF episodes particular . Thus , rationale establish systematic review patient data registry : - Self-termination AF lead slight , persistent AF lead advanced cardiac remodelling , show altered atrial conduction property - Early recognition therapy AF improve outcome , thus clinical parameter predict diagnose recurrence AF SR desirable Ablation AF predominantely perform use standard endocardial transvenous technique pulmonary vein isolation ( PVI ) radiofrequency cryoballoon ablation . For medical reason specific ablation technique like additional ablation line epicardial approach discretion treat cardiologist . The esECG measure signal averaged routine 12-lead ECG 3-5 supplementary lead ablation , discharge 3 month ablation . 2 tubes EDTA plasma take supplementary routine venous puncture admission analyse biomarkers common gene variant . During 5 year every participant receive esECG ablation , discharge three month ablation . Routine follow-up data participant include 12 month follow-up . Patients include would also undergo procedure without participation study . Risks ( complication procedure ) associate procedure participation registry . The supplementary diagnostics perform registry comprehensible clinical routine ECG diagnostics . Extra ( study-related ) investigation consist esECG ( signal average surface ECG 3-5 supplementary lead baseline ablation ) , discharge , 3 month ablation , possibly also body surface potential map ( BSPM ) . These always plan together routine follow-up , extra visit necessary . The esECG BSPM compare regular ECGs , additional discomfort might number lead . Furthermore 2 tube EDTA plasma blood take supplementary routine admission venous puncture biomarker common gene variant analysis . Quality assurance plan : All data store 2 independent database . In first database personal contact information store decent patient ID number ascend order . In database medical information store without personal data patient . The database algorithm prevent mesentery rudimentary check data integrity consistency . List provide repeated parameter variable explain relevant . Standard operate procedure provide relevant step patient inclusion , measurement data entry . Because registry character sample size calculation provide yet . But first year inclusion data analysis provide information expect sample size . To date calculate period patient inclusion 5 year . Data inconsistency could avoid due registry character study mark respective way . Statistical analysis perform first year patient include logistic regression analysis determine discriminative power record ECG clinical outcome recurrence AF .</detailed_description>
