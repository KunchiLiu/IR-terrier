	<brief_summary>This study examine factor may drive relationship vascular disease Alzheimer 's Disease large , longitudinal , multi-ethnic community-based cohort study old adult northern Manhattan , New York . In past research , investigator demonstrate accumulation brain vascular disease associate risk development AD . The study extend research examine brain vascular disease AD interact . In pilot study , investigator obtain PET scan measure amyloid ( one protein pathological marker AD ) participant ongoing community-based study age dementia ( WHICAP ) . The study include subject already enrol parent project already evaluate baseline PET scan . The study plan obtain 20 amyloid PET scan 5-year interval cohort participant establish baseline . The investigator also conduct transcranial Doppler study measure blood flow participant amyloid PET scan . The potential benefit society considerable study reveal new information risk factor contribution AD .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Alzheimer 's disease ( AD ) one devastate international public health epidemic . There currently effective disease-modifying preventative strategy . Current pathogenic model emphasize single pathway disease pathogenesis , underestimate contribution small vessel cerebrovascular disease , manifest primarily white matter hyperintensities ( WMH ) T2-weighted magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) . Understanding factor drive relationship vascular disease AD remain elusive ; vascular factor may independent source dysfunction contribute additively clinical expression , may interact mechanistically AD pathology , and/or may relate share association third set factor . These issue particularly relevant among ethnic/racial minority , much great risk clinical AD , severe cerebrovascular disease , appear similar level AD pathology compare Whites . The propose research examine factor large , longitudinal , multi-ethnic community-based cohort study old adult northern Manhattan , New York . The investigator demonstrate accumulation WMH , particularly parietal lobe , predicts incident AD , associate presence cerebral microbleeds , indicator cerebral amyloid angiopathy . The investigator extend research examine mechanistic interaction cerebrovascular disease AD . The preliminary data suggest individual evidence fibrillar amyloidosis increase parietal lobe WMH hemodynamic marker autoregulatory dysfunction associate WMH amyloid deposition , turn interact promote clinical expression AD . These finding buffer new data establish WMH core feature autosomal dominant form AD . In pilot study , investigator propose obtain longitudinal MRI amyloid positron emission tomography ( PET ) data participant WHICAP .</detailed_description>
