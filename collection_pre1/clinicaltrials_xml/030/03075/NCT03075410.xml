	<brief_summary>GSK3036656 develop GSK treatment tuberculosis ( TB ) . This FTIH study GSK3036656 evaluate safety , tolerability PK single ascend repeat oral dos GSK3036656 healthy adult subject . The result study intend use identify appropriate well-tolerated dos GSK3036656 use study . A food effect assessment also undertaken investigate influence food PK GSK3036656 . The study conduct two part : Part A ( single dose ) Part B ( repeat dose ) . Up two cohort include Part A . 9 healthy adult subject include cohort . Each cohort participate 4 treatment ( dose ) period include food effect treatment period . During treatment period , GSK3036656 administer 6 subject placebo administer 3 subject . The start dose Part A 5 milligram ( mg ) , maximum dose 1500 mg . The two cohort Part A dose sequentially ( i.e. , dose Cohort 2 start dose Cohort 1 complete ) . Initially , 14 day wash period individual subject dose level . Study progression Part B Part A base acceptable safety , tolerability PK profile Part A . Part B comprise 4 cohort ( Cohorts 3 , 4 , 5 , 6 ) contain 10 ( 8 active : 2 placebo ) healthy adult subject examine safety , tolerability PK repeat daily dose GSK3036656 period 14 day . Appropriate dos dose regimen Part B select base available safety , tolerability PK data Part A and/or precede repeat dose cohort Part B . Dividing total daily dose 2 3 small dos may do Part A Part B . Up 18 subject enrol Part A 40 subject enrol Part B . The total duration study subject recruit Part A Part B approximately 12 week 8 week , respectively .</brief_summary>
