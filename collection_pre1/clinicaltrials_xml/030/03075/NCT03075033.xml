	<brief_summary>Background : Conventional intubation trachea consequent prone position anaesthetized patient cervical spine instability may result secondary neurological injury . Historically , flexible fiber-optics use chief choice patient present cervical spine instability surgery either normal , predict difficult airway , even unanticipated difficult airway . Recently , rigid optical stylet show promise assist difficult intubation . Purpose : The aim present study compare efficacy Shikani optical stylet ( SOS ) flexible fiberscope awake intubation patient cervical spine instability . Methods : Sixty adult patient neurosurgical diagnosis cervical instability risk secondary cervical injury , plan awake intubation self-positioning prone , register study randomly categorize two equal group ( thirty patient ) , fiberoptic group SOS group , assessment cough gag intubation , time intubation , number attempt successful intubation , haemodynamic parameter , careful examination oropharynx determine lip mucosal trauma , eventually motor function ability move arm legs assessed tracheal intubation position prone .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Aim work : The aim study compare efficacy shikani optical stylet flexible fiberoptic bronchoscope awake intubation patient cervical spine instability . Patients Methods : This prospective , randomized study approve local ethical committee Alexandria main university hospital . Written inform consent obtain participant . Sixty patient age 18-65 year American Society Anaesthesiologists physical status I-III neurosurgical diagnosis cervical instability risk secondary cervical injury , schedule awake intubation self-positioning prone elective neurological intervention , enrol study . Patients increase risk pulmonary aspiration , requirement rapid sequence induction associate head injury preclude adequate clinical neurological examination exclude study . All patient receive rigid neck collar . Data collect patient include demographic data , level cervical spine pathology neurological status . An assistant n't concern within study get numbered opaque pre-sealed envelope contain randomise group allocation every patient join study . Patients randomly assign either fiberoptic group ( 30 ) Shikani group ( 30 ) utilize sealed-envelope technique . Anaesthetists concern within study expertise device assure consume device difficult airway situation . Routin pre-anaesthetic assessment perform , addition standard airway assessment , record presence oro-pharyngeal injury surgery . Non-invasive monitoring use intubation comprise pulse oximetry , blood pressure electrocardiography . Before start topical anaesthesia , patient give atropine 0.4 mg anti sialagogue agent , midazolam 2 mg increment fentanyl 25mic intravenously till patient calm sedate control airway . Topical anaesthesia oral cavity perform lidocaine 10 % spray . Anesthesia larynx vocal cord , vocal cord upper trachea encounter superior laryngeal nerve block use 4 ml 2 % lidocaine ( 2 ml side ) , lateral end thyrohyoid membrane beneath great cornu hyoid bone recurrent laryngeal nerve block ( Trans-tracheal injection ) use 20-gauge plastic catheter , 4ml 2 % lidocaine cricothyroid membrane end inspiration . Tracheal intubation execute either flexible fiberoptic bronchoscope Shikani optical stylet , accord randomise allocation . The shikani optical stylet bent bend Mackintosh laryngoscope blade , lubricate endotracheal tube mount . The tube settle stylet 'adjustable tube stop ' tip stylet project beyond end tube . The anaesthetist hold elevate mandible use left hand , patient ask protrude tongue applicable stylet introduce right side mouth advance tip hypopharynx . Then , direct vision tip insert vocal cords.The 'tube stop ' release tube unmounted trachea ; stylet remove . Once tracheal intubation accomplish , confirmation position endotracheal tube capnography chest auscultation . The patient ask move prone position bolster , case plan posterior approach cervical spine . The anaesthesia provider guard head tube move neurological examination repeat . Once position settle , presence end tidal carbon dioxide confirm general anaesthesia set .</detailed_description>
