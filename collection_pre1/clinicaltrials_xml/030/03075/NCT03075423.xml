	<detailed_description>SUNNIFORECAST ( Sunitinib vs. Nivolumab + Ipilimumab First line treatment Of REnal cell CAncer non-clear cell SubTypes ) Phase II , randomize , open-label investigator initiate trial ( IIT ) Nivolumab ( BMS-936558 ) combine Ipilimumab v Sunitinib monotherapy subject previously untreated advanced ( unresectable metastatic ) non-clear cell renal cell carcinoma ( nccRCC ) . In Phase I set , Nivolumab combine Ipilimumab demonstrate substantially great clinical activity , measure objective response rate ( ORR ) , either agent alone metastatic RCC ( mRCC ) . Given durability response associated immunotherapy , Nivolumab combine Ipilimumab hypothesize lead great clinical benefit , measure overall survival ( OS ) rate 12 month primary endpoint OS 6 month 18 month , progression-free survival ( PFS ) , overall survival ( OS ) overall response rate ( ORR ) secondary endpoint compare Sunitinib , widely use standard-of-care agent patient population . This study allow direct comparison OS rate 12 month arm .</detailed_description>
