	<brief_summary>The purpose quality improvement study measure effectiveness surveillance use optimized statistical process control ( SPC ) methods feedback rate surgical site infection ( SSI ) compare traditional surveillance feedback . The primary objective determine hospital cluster randomize receive feedback optimize SPC surveillance method collectively low rate SSI compare hospital cluster randomize receive feedback traditional surveillance method . Secondary objective 1 ) estimate compare number signal identify use optimize SPC method traditional surveillance method ; 2 ) estimate compare time effort require investigate signal generate use optimized SPC method traditional surveillance method ; 3 ) estimate number proportion false-positive signal identify use optimized SPC method traditional surveillance method . The Early 2RIS study prospective , multicenter cluster randomize control trial use step wedge design . The active component quality improvement study perform 29 DICON hospital three year , March 2017 February 2020 . Clusters randomize intervention receive feedback increase rate SSI identify optimize SPC method . This intervention expect decrease subsequent rate SSIs closing feedback loop SSI outcomes . Participating study hospital member DICON , network 43 community hospital North Carolina , South Carolina , Georgia , Florida , Virginia provide community hospital access consultative service infection prevention expert , data analysis benchmarking , educational material design faculty Duke . This study consider part routine quality improvement measure part previously establish agreement DICON community hospital . Data flow communication outline detail approve protocol determine exempt research DUHS IRB . Briefly , exist clinical data extract participate hospital ' electronic medical record discrete file accord DICON specification . Then de-identification process remove direct patient identifier limit dataset . The majority data collection occur method already develop utilized study hospital . In brief , hospital routinely submit limited datasets DICON Surgical Surveillance Database , include follow variable : hospital , type procedure , patient identifier , date procedure , age , sex , surgeon identifier , start/stop time , ASA score , wound class , risk index , SSI ( Yes/No ) , date infection , type SSI , location diagnosis organism . No identifiable patient surgeon data transmit DICON Surgical Database . Data definition data collection method standardize across DICON hospital . Following signal adjudication , additional data collect REDCap database document action rationale .</brief_summary>

	<criteria>All patient undergo one 13 target procedure 29 DICON study hospital eligible inclusion . The 13 targeted procedure include coronary artery bypass graft , cardiac valve replacement , colon surgery , herniorrhapy , knee arthroplasty , hip arthroplasty , Cesarean section , abdominal hysterectomy , vaginal hysterectomy , spinal fusion , laminectomy , carotid endarterectomy , peripheral venous bypass . These procedure select frequently perform community hospital and/or associate particularly adverse outcome complicate SSI . Eligible procedure categorize procedure type hospital use ICD9 code publish NHSN , per routine DICON activity . Six cluster construct procedure ensure surgeon perform similar type procedure group together limit potential bias . These cluster label Spine , GI , OB/GYN , Ortho , Vascular , Cardiac . These cluster unit randomization analysis . DICON hospital submit letter support participate study exclude . Patients undergo one 13 procedure type 29 study hospital exclude analysis .</criteria>
