	<brief_summary>Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease ( COPD ) substantial economic human cost . To minimize cost high quality guideline develop . However , development guideline alone rarely result change practice . One method integrate guideline professional practice use clinical pathway ( CPWs ) . The investigator work local stakeholder develop CPWs COPD aim improve quality care guideline adherence reduce healthcare utilization . The CPWs utilize several step include : standardizing diagnostic training , implement unifying common component chronic disease care , coordinate provision education recondition program , ensure disease specific care utilizes delivers evidence-informed practice . In addition , investigator work identify evidence-informed strategy implementation CPWs . Efforts underway tailor implementation strategy local context . The investigator conduct three-year quantitative health service research project use interrupted time series ( ITS ) design form multiple baseline approach control group . The CPW implement two Saskatchewan health region ( experimental group ) two health region act control ( control group ) . The experimental control group contain one urban one rural health region . This project expect improve quality life reduce healthcare utilization . The project also provide evidence effect CPWs urban rural setting . If pathway find effective investigator work stakeholder implement similar CPWs remain health region province .</brief_summary>
