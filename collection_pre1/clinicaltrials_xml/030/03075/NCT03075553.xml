	<brief_title>Nivolumab Treating Patients With Relapsed Refractory Peripheral T-cell Lymphoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To assess clinical benefit nivolumab T-cell lymphoma , measure objective response rate ( ORR ) within 12 cycle accord Lugano Classification Response Criteria ( 2014 ) . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . To assess safety tolerability regimen patient population . II . To assess progression-free survival ( PFS ) . III . To assess duration response ( DOR ) . IV . To assess overall survival ( OS ) . TERTIARY OBJECTIVES : I . To evaluate T-cell/cytokine profile peripheral blood - peripheral blood specimen use assess T-cell activation cytokine regulation measure treatment effect . II . To evaluate intratumoral biomarkers- intratumoral cell population distribution , genetic variability , mutational burden T-cell activation evaluate identify potential biomarkers correlate response therapy . III . To assess potential association PD-L1/PD-1/PD-L2 expression tumor T-cells and/or PD-L1 soluble level plasma clinical efficacy PD-1 blockade . OUTLINE : Patients receive nivolumab intravenously ( IV ) 60 minute day 1 . Treatment repeat every 14 day 8 course absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . Patients achieve stable disease , complete response , partial response receive nivolumab IV 60 minute day 1 course 9 . Treatment repeat every 28 day 24 course absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . After completion study treatment , patient follow 35 day , 100-120 day , 230-250 day , 330-390 day .</detailed_description>
