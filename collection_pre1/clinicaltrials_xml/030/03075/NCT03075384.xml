	<brief_title>Treatment Unilateral Complicated Zygomatic Complex Fractures Using Computer-Assisted Navigation System</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>In prospective randomize controlled trial , twenty patient unilateral complicate zygomatic fracture divide experimental control group . Patients experimental group treat open reduction internal fixation assistance surgical navigation technology , patient control group without . Preoperative postoperative CT data obtain measure surgical landmark discrepancy 2 group . The Chi-square Test t-test conduct test whether significant difference accuracy two group . Evaluating effect fixation data clinical symptom . Twenty patient unilateral complicate zygomatic-complex fracture receive operation . All patient heal function facial contour improve obviously . Postoperative clinical symptom significantly different two group ( P &gt; 0.05 ) . Compared control group , discrepancy surgical landmark measure software Geomagic studio 11 , Brainlabiplan CMF 3.0 significantly low experimental group ( P &lt; 0.05 ) . Software measurement show symmetry zygomatic area effect fixation experimental group satisfactory control group .</detailed_description>
