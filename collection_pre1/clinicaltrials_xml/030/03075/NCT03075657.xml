	<brief_title>Study add-on Ramelteon Therapy Sleep Circadian Rhythm Disruption Patients With Schizophrenia</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Schizophrenia mental dysfunction think , perception behaviour attribute complex dynamically interact perturbation multiple neurochemical system . Along cardinal feature schizophrenia , sleep disorder disturb circadian rhythm commonly encounter among patient . Markedly decreased sleep efficiency , delay sleep onset frequent awakening common observation . Endogenous melatonin dependable biomarker circadian rhythmicity , already find nocturnal rise endogenous melatonin blunt lead circadian dysrhythmia schizophrenia . The antipsychotic prescribed condition though cause improvement cardinal symptom disease significant effect melatonin level . The blunted peak night time melatonin secretion restore even decrease even several month therapy antipsychotic . In clinical scenario , add-on therapy sedative/ hypnotic along antipsychotic mandate prescription . Previous study reveal add-on therapy benzodiazepine worsen already exist derangement circadian rhythm decrease secretion nocturnal melatonin . A long term add therapy benzodiazepine patient antipsychotic find increase risk death . Addition melatonin pharmacotherapy schizophrenia elevate mood daytime function addition improve sleep schizophrenia patient . Melatonin , apart hypnotic circadian rhythm restore compound , also possess neuroprotective , anti-neuroinflammatory antioxidant property . The rate limit step melatonin biosynthetic pathway alkylation serotonin N- acetyl serotonin , catalyze enzyme AANAT ( aryl-alkylamine- N-acetyl-transferase ) . Study AANAT enzyme modulation achieve normal rhythmical secretion melatonin also potential target resynchronising circadian rhythm . Ramelteon melatonin receptor agonist approve treatment insomnia USFDA . It exert action act MT1 MT2 receptor suprachiasmatic nucleus . The long term safety ramelteon evaluate several worker find significant adverse effect like abuse liability , rebound insomnia cognitive impairment . In contrast melatonin , show higher-binding affinity MT1 MT2 receptor , lipophilic long half-life ( t1/2 melatonin 20-50 min whereas ramelteon 1-2.6 hr active melabolite M-II 2-5 hr ) . In addition , ramelteon already evaluate potential adjunctive treatment learn memory deficit schizophrenia . The sleep circadian rhythm disorder schizophrenia far give less importance researcher limit study target modulate melatonin pathway . Therefore , propose study plan evaluate effect add-on ramelteon sleep pattern/quality circadian rhythm disruption patient schizophrenia .</detailed_description>
