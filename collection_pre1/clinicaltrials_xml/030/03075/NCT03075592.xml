	<brief_title>Post-ERCP Pancreatitis Severity Indication ( PEPSI ) Study</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Endoscopic Retrograde Cholangiopancreaticography ( ERCP ) important diagnostic therapeutic tool management pancreatic biliary disease . However , carry 10 % risk develop acute pancreatitis , 10 % severe . Current model predict severity acute pancreatitis incomplete unable prognosticate early course disease base biomarkers late immune response . Recent finding suggest polymorphisms gene cod MCP-1 ( Monocyte Chemotactic Protein-1 ) play important role early immune response lead either mild versus severe acute pancreatitis various etiology . This study plan directly address problem post-ERCP pancreatitis gauge various factor involve development genetic variability immune response isolate pancreatic insult . In addition , hope study marker early immune response injury develop risk-assessment model .</detailed_description>
