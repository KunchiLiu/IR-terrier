	<brief_title>Enhancing At-risk Latina Women 's Use Genetic Counseling Hereditary Breast Ovarian Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Breast cancer diagnose cancer Latinas lead cause cancer death . Compared non-Latina Whites , Latinas diagnose young advanced breast cancer . They also second high prevalence BRCA1 BRCA2 gene mutation , significantly increase lifetime risk develop hereditary breast ovarian cancer ( HBOC ) . The US Preventive Services Task Force recommend referral genetic cancer risk assessment ( genetic counseling risk assessment appropriate ; GCRA ) woman high risk carry mutation . GCRA inform treatment survivor risk management decision unaffected woman . Latinas low GCRA use Whites . Explanations Latinas ' suboptimal GCRA participation include environmental ( e.g . access ) psychosocial factor ( e.g . low knowledge , emotion ) . There numerous intervention promote GCRA use White population mere handful intervention target Latinas mostly consist Mexicans Puerto Ricans . Empirical evidence successful strategy improve GCRA uptake lacking , especially grow population Central/South American immigrant , group nuanced different barrier ( e.g . social isolation ) . Our preliminary data suggest improve access necessarily translate high GCRA uptake . Our data also highlight provider ' challenge communicate GCRA risk information give dearth genetic material Spanish Spanish-speaking genetic counselor . Media-based tool use educate Latinas GCRA need . This study fill gap . To effective , risk HBOC communication intervention anchor within need cultural value audience . This individual process risk information context `` mental model '' - one 's intuitive belief base personal experience share cultural knowledge . Mental model influence interpretation new information . Often incongruence lay expert mental risk model lead miscommunication uninformed decision-making . For example , among Latinas , word `` test '' lead misconception genetic testing would repeat akin screening test like mammography . Understanding Latinas ' mental model facilitate target risk communication identify knowledge gap reduce misconception . Interventions address knowledge and/or belief may enhance uptake , risk information evoke emotional reaction often strong predictor behavior cognitive factor . Anticipated negative emotion GCRA associate low uptake . Latinas report ambivalence towards GCRA may impact decision . As intervention focus knowledge and/or access , study make considerable shift field address mental model target emotion . This experienced multidisciplinary team conduct risk communication intervention design target mental model , emotion , cultural value . Guided Theory Planned Behavior Social Cognitive Theory , investigator conduct two-phased mixed method study . In Phase I investigators interview key informant ( n=10 ) at-risk Latinas ( n=20 ) describe mental model psychosocial factor . These data inform risk-benefit message evaluate focus group ( n=20 ) use develop YouTube-based intervention , deliver via Latina actor trust medical personality . In Phase II investigator pilot intervention at-risk Latinas ( n=40 ) . Participants complete baseline survey , watch 15-minute video , complete follow-up assessment , refer patient navigator resource . The primary outcome intention use GCRA . GCRA uptake assess 3-months . Specific aim : Aim 1 . Describe portray Latinas ' GCRA mental model ( e.g . risk benefit perception ) . Aim 2 . Using data Aim 1 , develop content risk-benefit communication message at-risk Latinas incorporate Spanish-language YouTube video . Aim 3 . Evaluate acceptability pre- post-intervention difference primary outcome ( intention use GCRA ) intermediate outcome ( e.g . attitude ) . We also explore post-intervention GCRA uptake secondary outcome . H.2.1 . The intervention result significant increase intention use GCRA , H.2.2 . improvement intermediate outcome : knowledge , attitude , self-efficacy , emotional ambivalence . H.2.3 . After intervention , 30 % Latinas participate GCRA 3-months post-intervention . H.2.4 . The majority ( â‰¥75 % ) satisfy intervention . This study meet Healthy People 2020 goal enhance GCRA at-risk population , national priority increase diversity genetics research participation incorporate emotion cancer research . Findings inform new strategy behavioral intervention target Latinas large trial .</detailed_description>
