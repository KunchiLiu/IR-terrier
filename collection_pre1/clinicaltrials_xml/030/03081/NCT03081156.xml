	<brief_title>The Effect BEVESPI AEROSPHERE ® Therapy Exercise Tolerance COPD</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Patients chronic obstructive pulmonary disease ( COPD ) obstruction expiratory airflow , mark breathlessness , high dyspnea score , reduce exercise tolerance relative age gender match non-smoking control ( Casaburi , 2009 ; Casaburi et al. , 2014 ; Puente-Maestu et al. , 2016 ) . A prominent mechanism exercise intolerance think dynamic hyperinflation exercise ( increase end-expiratory lung volume ) contribute sensation breathlessness , ultimately result early cessation exercise . A co-maladaptive mechanism exercise limitation COPD relate wasted excessive ventilation work intensity increase dead space ventilation relative total ventilation ( increased VD/VT ) . This requirement additional ventilation limit exercise capacity contributes dynamic hyperinflation ventilatory limitation ( O'Donnell et al. , 2004 ) . Treatment individual bronchodilator , include short act beta agonist ( SABA ) , long act beta agonist ( LABA ) , short act muscarinic antagonist ( SAMA ) long act muscarinic antagonist ( LAMA ) effective partially reverse expiratory airflow obstruction rest exercise result reduced dynamic hyperinflation . Because beta-agonists anticholinergic broncho-dilate synergistically , often use combination product ( SABA+SAMA LABA/LAMA ) . The optimal sustained bronchodilation effect COPD appear achieve fix dose , long act combination medication ( LABA/LAMA ) . ( Bateman et al. , 2014 ; Casaburi , 2009 ; Casaburi et al. , 2014 ; Cope et al. , 2013 ; Huisman et al. , 2015 ) . As dynamic hyperinflation appear also limit factor exercise tolerance , LABA/LAMA preparation improve airflow exercise , appear likely use fixed-dose combination bronchodilator , BEVESPI AEROSPHERE ® ( Glycopyrrolate/Formeterol ) increase exercise tolerance reduce hyperinflation COPD patient . We hypothesize exercise tolerance constant work rate , high intensity cardiopulmonary exercise test increase BEVESPI AEROSPHERE ® ( Glycopyrrolate/Formeterol ) , increase exercise tolerance mediate combination : 1. reduced dynamic hyperinflation , 2. decrease dead space ventilation ( VD/VT ) exercise . Primary objective : To determine magnitude exercise time improvement ( second ) BEVESPI AEROSPHERE ® ( Glycopyrrolate/Formeterol ) relative placebo high intensity , constant work rate exercise COPD patient . Secondary objective : To determine VD/VT reliably assess constant work rate exercise use transcutaneous CO2 measurement ( tcpCO2 ) , , BEVESPI AEROSPHERE ® ( Glycopyrrolate/Formeterol ) result reduction VD/VT relative placebo isotime high intensity constant work rate exercise COPD patient . Tertiary objective : To determine computerized assessment spontaneous expiratory flow-volume loop exercise provide additional information dynamic hyperinflation effect BEVESPI AEROSPHERE ® ( Glycopyrrolate/Formeterol ) high intensity , constant work rate exercise COPD patient .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>1 . All patient must clinical diagnosis chronic obstructive pulmonary disease ( COPD ) must meet following criterion : 1 . Stable state disease exacerbation ( antibiotic , oral steroid , ER visit , hospitalization COPD ) within previous 4 week ; 2 . At visit 1 Spirometric Values must demonstrate postbronchodilator FEV1 35 % 80 % predict normal postbronchodilator FEV1/FVC &lt; 70 % . [ The rationale low limit exclude patient unlikely tolerate withholding long acting bronchodilator . The rationale upper limit exclude patient unlikely limited exercise tolerance hyperinflation air trap . ] 2 . Male female patient , 40 80 year ( inclusive ) age . 3 . Patients must current exsmokers smoke history 10 packyears . 4 . Patients must able perform technically acceptable pulmonary function test symptomlimited cardiopulmonary cycle ergometry test . 5 . Patients must able inhale medication acceptable manner meter dose inhaler use study . 1 . Patients significant disease COPD ; significant disease define disease , opinion investigator , may ( ) put patient risk participation study , ( ii ) influence result study , ( iii ) cause concern regard patient 's ability participate study . 2 . Patients document personal history childhood asthma , clinical presentation consistent asthma , family history asthma . For patient allergic rhinitis , atopy , prior allergy treatment , medical record obtain verify patient asthma . The final determination possibility overlap condition [ AsthmaCOPD Overlap Syndrome , ( Postma Rabe , 2015 ) ] , thus , appropriateness entry study , principal investigator 's decision . 3 . Patients follow condition : 1 . A history myocardial infarction within 1 year screen visit . 2 . Unstable lifethreatening cardiac arrhythmia . 3 . Hospitalized heart failure within past year . 4 . Known active tuberculosis . 5 . A malignancy patient undergone resection , radiation therapy chemotherapy within past 6 month ( patient treat local skin tumor allow ) . 6 . A history lifethreatening COPD exacerbation require intubation . 7 . A history cystic fibrosis . 8 . Clinically significant active bronchiectasis . 9 . A history alcohol drug abuse within past year . 10 . Any contraindication exercise test outline ( see contraindication exercise ) . 11 . Patients undergone thoracotomy pulmonary resection past year . 4 . Patients treat oral corticosteroid medication unstable dos ( i.e. , less six week stable dose ) dose excess equivalent 10 mg prednisone per day 20 mg every day . 5 . Patients regularly use daytime oxygen therapy 6 hour per day investigator 's opinion unable abstain use oxygen therapy clinic visit exercise test . 6 . Patients desaturate SpO2 &lt; 80 % screen incremental exercise testing . 7 . Patients complete pulmonary rehabilitation program six week prior screen visit patient currently pulmonary rehabilitation program . 8 . Patients limitation exercise performance result factor fatigue exertional dyspnea , arthritis leg , angina pectoris claudication morbid obesity . 9 .
