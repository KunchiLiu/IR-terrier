	<brief_summary>This single-arm , phase 1/2a study formulate paclitaxel subject low-grade , noninvasive papillary carcinoma ( stage Ta ) bladder . Part 1 study enroll 6 subject ( 3 per cohort ) low-grade , stage Ta transitional cell carcinoma ( TCC ) bladder receive escalating dos paclitaxel formulate TSD-001 every 2 week 6 treatment Dose Limiting Toxicity ( Maximum Deliverable Dose ) observe ( Maximum Tolerated Dose establish ) . Part 2 study enroll additional 10 subject low-grade , stage Ta ( multifocal ) TCC bladder receive weekly TSD-001 6 week high nontoxic dose ( i.e. , MTD ) establish part 1 study .</brief_summary>
