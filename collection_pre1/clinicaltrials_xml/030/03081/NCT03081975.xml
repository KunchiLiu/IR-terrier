	<brief_title>NBI Does Not Increase ADR Compared HD White Light Colonoscopy Screening Surveillance Colonoscopies</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Background : Despite recent advance endoscopic technology adenoma miss rate still 20 % contributes occurrence interval cancer . Therefore , improve imaging modality introduce increase adenoma detection rate ( ADR ) screen surveillance colonoscopy . Recently , narrow band imaging ( NBI ; Exera II series , Olympus Corporation ) significantly well high definition white light colonoscopy ( WLC ) detection patient colorectal polyp , colorectal adenomas1 . However , Olympus ' current Exera III series characterize good illumination bowel lumen may associate high ADR high definition WLC . Methods : Investigators perform prospective evaluation patient refer Department Interdisciplinary Endoscopy Jena University Hospital screen surveillance colonoscopy January November 2015 daily clinical practice . Colonoscopy perform use HD-WLC HD-NBI upon withdrawal colonoscope ( Exera III series , Olympus Corporation ) .</detailed_description>
