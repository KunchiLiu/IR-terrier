	<brief_summary>Total knee arthroplasty frequent surgery France . It currently represent 70,000 intervention per year . The total knee prosthesis also call tri-compartmental allows articulation femur tibia also femur patella . The patella belong extensor system . It articulate femoral trochlea slide . It important biomechanical role quadriceps strength addition allow flexion-extension movement . In case resurfacing , joint face patella cut ; A convex polyethylene implant seal cement use studs face . In case non-resurfacing , surgeon leaf place cartilage patella direct contact femoral prosthetic trochlea . Both method advantage disadvantage . For implant , recommend resurface patella implant tolerant native patella . Other implant design well adapted preservation patellar cartilage . There currently evidence one method superior new generation implant know `` patellar friendly '' . It seem necessary compare method term long-term postsurgery result .</brief_summary>
