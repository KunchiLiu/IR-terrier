	<brief_title>Transphyseal Vs. Physeal Sparing ACL Reconstruction Skeletally Immature Patients : Risk Subsequent Lower Extremity Growth Deformity</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Background &amp; Significance : In adult population , vast majority ACL reconstruction perform drill femoral tibial bone tunnel . Because patient achieve physeal closure time surgery , risk angular growth deformity create tibial femoral tunnel . However , pediatric patient open tibial femoral physes , concern drilling across physes use standard tunnel may cause physeal injury resultant angular deformity . Other surgical technique describe allow graft place without drilling tunnel across tibial femoral physes debate regard whether `` physeal sparing '' technique effective transphyseal tunnel position . Drilling tunnels epiphysis avoid physis common `` physeal sparing '' technique . It debate whether technique could also cause growth disturbance . Given increase number pediatric ACL injury 95 % patient age 12 less open physes 94 % patient age 14 great close physes , topic significant interest . Similar study conduct either small underpowered included old adolescent patient . At Duke Sports Sciences Institute , sizable population patient age 16 less undergone ACL reconstruction transphyseal epiphyseal technique . This provide unique opportunity analyze compare two group respect clinical outcome incidence growth disturbance angular deformity Design &amp; Procedures : The investigator conduct review medical record five provider single site institution determine subject population . Specifically , investigator look patient ACL reconstruction age 6-16 January 1 , 2005 December 31 , 2016 . The investigator confirm medical record pre-operative radiograph growth plat open time surgery . Only subject open physeal enrol study place 3 cohort : Ages le 12 , 12-13 , 14 - 16 . Subjects contact phone member team ask return Duke Sports Sciences Institute participate study . Upon arrival clinic , subject consent study undergo full physical exam - specifically target gait range motion , well Lachman , Anterior Drawer Pivot Shift maneuver assess stability functionality graft . In addition , complete questionnaire design elicit patient satisfaction level activity/sports participation initial recovery period . Bilateral hip ankle radiograph take subject . These radiograph analyze assess angular deformity surgical non-surgical leg . In addition , baseline knee x-rays review determination skeletal maturity time injury/surgery . Data organize accord patient underwent transphyseal reconstruction patient underwent physeal spar reconstruction separate corresponding age group . Comparisons make two surgical technique base follow criterion : - Patient satisfaction return function - Graft stability - Angular deformity - Skeletal maturity time surgery Study Interventions : Subjects undergo physical examination ( gait , inspection , range motion instability test ) completion outcome tool survey ( IKDC score/PediIKDC , VAS , Marx , ACL-RSIsurvey ) . Subjects undergo bilateral hip ankle radiographic image assess growth deformity . Subjects also ask give permission review medical record imaging pertinent knee knee surgery . Data Analysis &amp; Statistical Considerations : Patient 's data collect database program , index initially medical record number . After case collection , case number apply medical record number strip data . The code link medical record number case number keep locked file access limit primary investigator . Contingency analysis use Fisher exact test use compare distribution normal/nearly normal exam finding three cohort Descriptive statistic ( mean , standard deviation range ) report score Scores compare three cohort use ANOVA post-hoc analysis use Tukey 's correction multiple comparison Privacy , Data Storage &amp; Confidentiality : The primary investigator collect data computerize database use commercially available database program . During collection , data index patient 's medical record number . After data collection , case number assign data medical record number ( identify data collect ) strip database . The code link medical record number case number keep locked file access limit primary investigator . When study complete code link medical record number case number destroy . During data collection review , protect health information available primary investigator reuse disclosed person entity , except require law , authorize oversight research study .</detailed_description>
