	<detailed_description>Patients advance hepatocellular carcinoma progress sorafenib , tolerate sorafenib refuse drug enrol . Patients receive galunisertib monotherapy 150mg PO BID day 1-14 cycle 1 ( one cycle = 28 day ) . During two week rest period , patient receive SBRT dose 18Gy single malignant lesion follow continuation intermittent galunisertib monotherapy ( Days 1-14 28 day cycle ) either progression disease unacceptable toxicity occur .</detailed_description>
