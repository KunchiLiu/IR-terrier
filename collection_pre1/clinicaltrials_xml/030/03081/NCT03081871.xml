	<detailed_description>Cardiovascular disease ( CVD ) cause 2,200 death Americans every day one death every 39 second . There evidence death prevent good risk factor management , however , many risk factor remain uncontrolled . The Patient-Centered Medical Home ( Medical Home ) include self-management , personalized health record team-based care , propose strategy reduce gap care delivery . Several Cochrane review meta-analyses find evidence add pharmacist primary care team improve risk factor control physician adherence guideline . Managed care organization find centralize cardiovascular risk service ( CVRS ) manage pharmacist reduce mortality . A gap literature know whether comprehensive CVRS model would implement typical office practice un-integrated setting . Simultaneously , systematic review mobile health ( mHealth ) trial include disease management apps find trial incorporate communication pharmacist lack evidence major gap mHealth literature . The objective application develop test mobile app enable , pharmacist manage CVRS disseminate implement evidence-based guideline practice . In addition develop app patient design partner , conduct multi-center individually randomize study nest within ongoing NIH trial medical office large geographic , racial ethnic diversity . We randomize 100 patient primary care office mHealth CVRS ( mobile app + web site + pharmacist ) CVRS ( web site + pharmacist ) 55 racial/ethnic minority . Our central hypothesis mHealth CVRS design patient partner implement significantly improve patient engagement , lead improve CVD guideline adherence use Get The Guidelines Guideline Advantage metric . The rationale propose study novel mHealth model improve secondary prevention CVD pharmacist assistance lead broad adoption health system throughout US . Our primary Aim : examine feasibility mHealth technology disseminate evidence-based risk reduction guideline prospective randomize control trial among diverse primary care office . We postulate system engagement ( primary hypothesis ) adherence guideline secondary prevention CVD ( secondary hypothesis ) significantly great patient randomize mHealth intervention compare control group . This study expect produce follow outcome : unique mobile app feature complement standard CVRS , increase engagement CVRS increase achievement guideline-concordant therapy .</detailed_description>
