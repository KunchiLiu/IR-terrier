	<brief_title>A Study Evaluate Efficacy Safety X0002 Spray Subjects With Osteoarthritis Knee</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Every subject pre-screening interview phone method find subject may meet inclusion/exclusion criterion . After Screening Period , subject Kellgren-Lawrence Radiographic Grade 1 , 2 , 3 randomly assign 1 2 treatment group 2:1 ratio active : placebo ( ie , 2 subject active treatment 1 subject placebo ) stratify base K-L grade 1 , 2 , 3 , bilateral unilateral knee OA , gender , BMI ( 30≤vs. &gt; 30 ) , age ( 65≤vs. &gt; 65 ) . Before first screen visit , pre-Screening Telephone Call email interview , Screening Period least 14 day 3 week consist two visit assessment eligibility include radiographic evaluation target knee joint space , screen visit week 2 , 4 , 8 , 12 visit show Study Flow Chart Double-blind Period , open label period start Week 12 visit . All subject treat active drug placebo complete 12-week double-blind study enter Open-label study treat active drug , X0002 . Subjects require sign Informed Consent participation study . Each subject enter open label phase receive X0002 study treatment 40 week start Week 12 visit . Qualified site personnel contact subject 1 week ( Week 13 ) Week 12 visit check adverse event ( AEs ) . Subjects return site 22 , 32 , 42 , 52 week start treatment efficacy safety assessment . The Week 12 visit EOS visit double-bind treatment period Week 52 visit EOS visit study . On final day dose administration Week 12 Week 52 visit , radiographs 3D qMRI perform assess change target knee joint space cartilage ( morphometry ) , sub-chondral bone , osteophyte volume , 3-D bone shape , bone marrow lesion ( BML ) size , synovitis , effusion , meniscus morphology , cartilage morphology attrition . For subject bilateral knee pain , knee treat , symptomatic knee ( ie , painful knee measure WOMAC® 3.1 pain subscale score Screening ) designate target knee efficacy analysis . For subject unilateral knee pain , symptomatic ( target ) knee treat . Subjects take nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug ( NSAIDs ) analgesic may enroll trial , discontinue analgesic therapy duration study , start least 14 day prior administration first dose study medication ( ie , analgesic washout period Day 1 ) . Subjects allowed take rescue medication ( six 325 mg tablet [ total 1950 mg ] acetaminophen per day ; provide Sponsor ) residual knee body pain start first screen visit screen treatment period except 24 hour prior screen visit 2 , Baseline ( Day 1 ) , Week 2 , Week 4 , Week 8 , Week 12 , Week 22 , Week 32 , Week 42 , Week 52 ( EOS ) . Subjects record follow information Daily Diary Screening Period : amount knee pain target knee walk precede 24 hour ( use 100 mm visual analog scale [ VAS ] ) , time number spray administration study medication ( start first screen visit ) , time subject wash his/her knee and/or take shower , number tablet rescue medication take day time take , reason take rescue medication ( eg , target knee pain , contralateral knee pain , headache , low back pain ) , use Curél Itch Defense Lotion , concomitant medication take day , AEs occur day . The study treatment may cause dry and/or itchy skin ; therefore , Curél Itch Defense Lotion ( available pharmacy ) apply treat affected area record diary . The VAS version WOMAC use Primary Secondary Efficacy Endpoints . Efficacy endpoint assess Screening visit , Day 1 , Week 2 , Week 4 , Week 8 , Week 12 , Week 22 , Week 32 , Week 42 , Week 52 ( EOS ) visit . Safety assessment perform visit include assessment AEs , vital sign ( blood pressure , pulse rate , oral temperature ) , clinical laboratory , physical examination , skin irritation , electrocardiogram ( ECGs ) indicate study flow chart .</detailed_description>
