	<brief_summary>In clinical trial investigator observe impact regional anesthesia addition general anesthesia expression substance P patient unilateral oropharynx carcinoma undergo bilateral Neck Dissection . The investigator perform unilateral regional cervical plexus block tumor side sham blockade contralateral side . The tissue tumor side contralateral side analyse immunohistology , measure expression Substance P .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Several investigation show anesthetic procedure , especially perioperative regional anesthesia , benefit patient undergoing tumor surgery.The perioperative regional anesthesia might reduce immunological response therefore low risk tumor relapse . Factors might play role tumor relapse various , prospective randomise trial necessary investigate underlying mechanism . In retrospective analysis Merquiol et al . show cervical epidural anesthesia associate extend tumorfree timeline larynx hypopharynx carcinoma . Supporting result could see study Munoz et al . perform regional anaesthesia breast cancer patient . Taking fact consideration investigator believe perform regional aneasthesia could reduce relapse larynx carcinoma . The relapse carcinoma believe link substance P neurokinin 1 ( NK-1 ) receptor . It accept additional regional anesthesia could reduce impact substance P gain normal immune response perioperative set reduce rate tumor relapse .</detailed_description>
