	<brief_summary>Recurrent spontaneous abortion ( RSA ) repeat implantation failure ( RIF ) IVF-ET severely affect IVF live birth rate patient 's health.The specific etiology contains chromosomal abnormality , reproductive anatomical abnormality , endocrine disorder , reproductive system infection , autoimmune environmental factor . However still 50 % 60 % RSA n't clear cause , call unexplained recurrent spontaneous abortion ( URSA ) , mainly relate immune factors.Among various treatment , lymphocytes active immunotherapy common treatment method , clinical efficacy widely recognize although action mechanism clear far .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Preliminary Study About Recurrent Spontaneous Abortion Repeated Implantation Failure IVF-ET Patients Treated Active Immunotherapy With Small Amount Lymphocytes</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The main mechanism active immunotherapy include upregulating Th2-type cytokine , downregulating Th1-type cytokine , make Th1 / Th2 shift Th2 , induce maternal serum IL-6 sIL6R , PIBF , EGF ; induce expression Fas / Fasl lymphocyte surface ; increase proportion CD8 + cell , Th2-type cell CD + CD25 + Treg cell , decrease activity CD56 + CD16 + NK cell on.The purpose study observe treatment effect active immunotherapy RSA RIF patient . What 's , use flow cytometry , quantitative real-time PCR ( qPCR ) method characterize Th1/Th2 Th17/Treg cell population immunotherapy , ecpecting find exact molecule mechanism immunotherapy paternal third party lymphocyte .</detailed_description>
