	<brief_summary>This study patient high risk metastatic prostate cancer ( cancer spread outside prostate ) go radical prostatectomy . The Anti-1-amino-3- [ 18F ] fluorocyclobutyl-1-carboxylic acid ( FACBC Fluciclovine ) positron emission tomography ( PET ) scan new image approach promise result show progression cancer . The goal study determine FACBC PET image detect metastatic disease patient high risk prostate cancer negative conventional cross-sectional imaging compute tomography ( CT ) and/or magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) , well bone scan and/or sodium fluoride PET . FACBC PET imaging may help detect metastatic prostate cancer patient newly diagnose high risk primary prostate cancer potentially improve stag cancer . Additionally , researcher compare FACBC uptake prostate uptake FACBC detect metastasis . They also analyze compare prostate tissue , serum urine parameter link high rate FACBC positivity .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Validation FACBC Detection Metastasis Among High-risk Prostate Cancer Patients With Presumed Localized Disease</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Approximately 50-80 % patient consider high-risk treated definitive radical prostatectomy experience recurrent disease , often undetected extra-prostatic metastatic disease prior treatment . There increase evidence perform radical prostatectomy patient high-risk disease locally advanced disease feasible potential benefit term local control , overall survival , quality life . Thus , improve imaging approach early detection occult metastatic prostate cancer time presentation could inform direct treatment approach would significantly improve patient outcome , include use extend lymphadenectomy well postoperative radiation therapy planning . Amino acid transport up-regulated prostate cancer . Anti-1-amino-3- [ 18F ] fluorocyclobutyl-1-carboxylic acid ( FACBC ) synthetic amino acid analog positron emission tomography ( PET ) radiotracer demonstrate promising result stag restaging prostate carcinoma , high positive predictive value ( PPV ) identification extraprostatic malignancy . Most prior study FACBC post-primary treatment recurrence , propose trial first comprehensive study evaluate FACBC PET detect occult metastatic disease initial diagnosis patient negative equivocal conventional imaging , objective develop effective primary treatment plan . The goal study determine FACBC PET detect significant occult metastatic disease patient high risk primary prostate carcinoma negative equivocal conventional imaging CT and/or MRI bone scan . Participants single scan prior surgery study . Participants follow , medical record review , 10 year additional procedure relate study perform .</detailed_description>
