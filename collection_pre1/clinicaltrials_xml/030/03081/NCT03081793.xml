	<brief_title>Estimation Average Beat-to-beat Heart Rate With Novel Wrist-worn PPG Device Surgery Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The primary use photoplethysmography ( PPG ) measurement clinical setting usually determination blood oxygen saturation level patient . The device often report also average pulse rate subject . If subject low blood perfusion hand suffers acute atrial fibrillation , determination pulse rate challenge therefore reading provide current technology unreliable . Optical heart rate monitor ( OHR ) recently become popular sport wellness application performance healthy subject normal blood perfusion extremity well study document good accuracy show healthy subject . The performance wrist-worn OHR monitor hospital patient , however , extensively study . The aim study test novel wrist-worn photoplethysmographic ( PPG ) device surgery patient study feasibility detect heart rate beat beat heart rate patient normal sinus rhythm arrhythmia , atrial fibrillation ( AF ) .</detailed_description>
