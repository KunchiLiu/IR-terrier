Schools randomly assign 3 study condition : 1 ) MFG-delivered train family peer ; 2 ) MFG-delivered community health worker ; , 3 ) Comparison : mental health school support material ( book , uniform ) . Data collect baseline , 8 16 week , 6 month follow-up ( 10 month baseline ) . More specifically objectives study : Primary objective 1 . To examine short- long-term outcome associate MFG . Hypothesis : Children treatment group ( MFG ) improve significantly compare treatment ( usual care ) group . 2 . To examine systematic variation delivery evidence-based MFG program impact outcomes child behavioral difficulty caregiver country context . Hypothesis : Children participate MFG family display significantly reduce conduct difficulty increase functioning time compare involved comparison condition . We expect parent peer - compare community health worker - evidence significantly success engage family attend MFG session , thus , child MFG-parent peer deliver condition evidence great improvement relative two study condition . Secondary objective 3 . To compare uptake implementation MFGs train exist family peer community outreach health worker . Hypothesis : Given level training community outreach health worker receive prior study part regular professional training , evidence high fidelity initially , yet train ongoing supervision , expect difference decrease time . 4 . To examine multi-level ( state/government , NGOs , family , school , community ) influence uptake , implementation , effectiveness sustainability EBPs address serious child disruptive behavioral challenge .</detailed_description>
