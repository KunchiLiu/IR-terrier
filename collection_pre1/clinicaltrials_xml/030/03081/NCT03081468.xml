	<brief_summary>In current , clinical ophthalmology , range specialise test allows comprehensive evaluation ocular health . These test typically evolve many year ensure clinical validity . For example , assessment visual acuity traditionally measure Snellen letter chart distance six metre ( 20 foot ) , lead phrase `` 20/20 vision '' . Despite , limitation Snellen test well establish sophisticated test available ( e.g. , logMAR test use ETDRS ( Early Treatment Diabetic Retinopathy Study ) chart ) . Many diagnostic test undergo similar cycle refinement , often extended time period . Therefore , incumbent new device undergo detailed evaluation validity ( measurement agree test ) repeatability ( variability measurement obtain short time period , operator condition ) . Binocular OCT extend application OCT device beyond simple , cross- sectional imaging diverse array diagnostic test . The binocular design also remove need additional personnel perform test ( i.e. , device self-operated automated manner ) , allow novel test perform possible monocular imaging . In particular , binocular OCT device potential perform automate , quantitative pupillary measurement - entirely novel application image modality . This study assess validity repeatability pupil measurement use binocular OCT .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>The PUPIL Study - Automated , Quantitative Pupil Assessment Using Binocular OCT</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Binocular OCT potential allow objective , quantitative measurement pupillary reflex , perform fast , safe , automated manner . Importantly , binocular OCT pupillometry perform alongside binocular retinal OCT image single test session , automate manner ( image retina use OCT common ophthalmic imaging procedure worldwide - 2011 , estimate 20 million retinal OCT image obtain , sum ophthalmic imaging procedure combine ) . Assessment pupillary reflex essential component comprehensive ocular examination . In patient visual loss , example , detection RAPD often indicate presence serious ophthalmic disease , optic neuropathy severe retinal disease . As , RAPD test essential screen test assessment patient less serious condition cataract . RAPD test commonly perform use swing flashlight method ( SFM ) . A positive SFM test suggest presence asymmetric damage involve afferent limb pupillary light reflex pathway . The SFM qualitative test , rely upon visualise pupillary constriction immediate delay pupillary dilation ; either response observe , RAPD believe present . The SFM require trained examiner many potential source error may confound result , include anisocoria , off-axis pupil illumination , unequal retinal bleaching . Pupil abnormality may subtle easily miss use SFM . Automated pupilometers allow examiner precisely objectively quantify pupillary response light measure parameter minimum maximum pupil diameter , amplitude constriction , latency constriction , velocity constriction , duration maximum constriction . Dedicated pupillometry device commercially available show highly sensitive specific RAPD detection e.g . RAPDx ; Konan Medical USA , Inc. , Irvine , CA . These device also capable detect presence subtle RAPD , typically find use SFM , diseases glaucoma . Unfortunately , automate pupilometers Konan RAPDx system widely use clinical practice . This largely expensive device , limited single purpose . A binocular OCT system could perform automated pupillometry retinal OCT imaging would thus great clinical utility .</detailed_description>
