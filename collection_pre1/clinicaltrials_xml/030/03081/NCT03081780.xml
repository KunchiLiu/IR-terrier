	<brief_summary>This Phase I open-label dose escalation study single infusion FATE-NK100 short course subcutaneous interleukin-2 ( IL-2 ) administer lymphodepleting chemotherapy ( CY/FLU ) subject refractory relapse acute myelogenous leukemia ( AML ) . FATE-NK100 natural killer ( NK ) cell product enrich NK cell `` adaptive '' , human cytomegalovirus ( CMV ) -induced , phenotype . The NK cell product comprise peripheral blood ( PB ) leukocytes source related donor ( HLA-haploidentical well fully HLA-matched ) seropositive cytomegalovirus ( CMV+ ) , enrich adaptive NK cell depletion CD3+ ( T-lymphocytes ) CD19+ ( B-lymphocytes ) cell follow ex-vivo culture expansion .</brief_summary>
