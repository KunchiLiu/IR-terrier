	<brief_summary>Infection HIV ( virus cause AIDS ) lead problem brain function , memory , concentration , judgment , speed control hand leg . Neurologists call condition HIV-associated neurocognitive disorder ( HAND ) . This research do see insulin take nose spray ( intranasal insulin ) help people HIV problem memory brain function , HAND . Participants give either insulin placebo . A placebo inactive substance look like study drug , contain study drug . For research study , placebo clear , saline-based liquid spray look like insulin spray insulin . Participants tell whether receive insulin placebo study . All participant take intranasal spray twice day , 30 minute meal . Participants use specialized intranasal drug administration device . The total daily dose insulin 40 IU split 20 IU morning 20 IU evening . Participants take intranasal spray 24 week . The researcher record symptom side effect study . Procedures include neurocognitive test memory brain function , two lumbar puncture ( `` spinal tap '' ) , two MRI brain scan , several blood draw , clinical assessment .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>HIV-associated neurocognitive disorder ( HAND ) characterize disable cognitive , behavioral , motor dysfunction occur individual HIV even take combination antiretroviral therapy ( ART ) . The mechanisms residual impairment fully understood , appear involve poor penetrance ART drug central nervous system ( CNS ) result brain sanctuary inadequately suppress HIV infection associate sustained inflammation . Adjunctive therapy target neuroprotective agent critically need treatment HAND . Insulin involve multiple CNS function include food intake , metabolism , learn , memory . Insulin neuroprotective property demonstrate cell culture experiment vivo model , provide strong evidence use therapeutic agent treat HAND . Insulin modify therapy ( IMT ) include intranasal insulin administer novel nasal drug delivery device . IMT may play important role neuronal plasticity survival protect hippocampal neuron oxidative stress apoptotic cell death induced glutamate neurotoxicity . Previous study support propose early phase trial IMT novel therapeutic agent HAND . This double-blinded placebo-controlled clinical trial evaluate safety intranasal insulin daily dose 40 IU provide initial data assess safety efficacy . The protocol measure safety incidence frequency adverse event . Clinical effect IMT 24-week trial period measure change neurocognitive functional testing result , well several novel radiological cerebrospinal fluid ( CSF ) surrogate marker . Outcomes study could important implication design future study IMT neuroprotective compound HAND .</detailed_description>
