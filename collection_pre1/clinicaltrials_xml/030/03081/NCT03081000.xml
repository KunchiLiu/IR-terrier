	<brief_summary>Aims : - Primary : To identify incidence intra-operative post-operative hypothermia Secondary : To identify factor contribute peri-operative hypothermia . To identify current anaesthetic practice peri-operative temperature monitoring , use active/warming measure anaesthetists various hospital . To increase awareness problem IPH guideline available .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Perioperative Hypothermia : A Multi-center Study Incidence , Risk Factors Preventive Measures .</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Inadvertent peri-operative hypothermia ( IPH ) affect patient across age , occur 50 % unwarmed surgical patient . It carry significant morbidity mortality include increase risk myocardial infarction , bleeding , surgical site infection , increase shiver patient discomfort , well increased length hospital stay . Guidelines publish UK National Institute Clinical Excellence ( NICE ) well American Society Anaesthesiologists . However , compliance guideline poor , local guideline develop yet . A one month audit conduct KKH Department Paediatric Anaesthesia 2014 collect data incidence perioperative hypothermia patient undergo general anaesthesia variety surgery . This preliminary audit demonstrate 33.7 % incidence hypothermia PACU among 164 patient . The investigator wish carry comprehensive audit find incidence IPH adult paediatric surgical patient , identify risk factor assess current practice prevent IPH across various healthcare institution . The study aim find incidence IPH , identify risk factor involve find current preventive measure various local hospital ; already place , bring awareness problem improve patient outcomes . This cross-sectional observational study , aim recruit 4000 patient age , across 5 institution course 6 month . Patients receive current standard care , per anaesthetist charge , regard temperature monitoring , use passive/active warming strategy . The method temperature monitoring , warm heat conservation technique would record patient 's temperature would measure recovery area post-operatively recovery nurse . In addition , patient demographic , surgical time , anaesthetic time , surgical procedure method anaesthetic , total fluid give , also record prospectively-designed data collection form .</detailed_description>
