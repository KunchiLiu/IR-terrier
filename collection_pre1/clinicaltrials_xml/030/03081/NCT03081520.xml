	<brief_summary>The aim study examine acute affective response series exercise session different intensity young healthy adult . The study randomize control trial three different group ( A : moderate continuous training ( MIT ) , B : high-intensity aerobe interval training ( HAIT ) , C : high-intensity sprint interval training ( HIIT ) ) . Healthy adult age 18-40 year ( n=30 ) invite participate . Each participant perform VO2max test follow five session randomize type training . The session complete within two week . The participant complete questionnaire regard exercise motivation ( Behavioral Regulation Exercise Questionnaire ) , mood ( Positive Negative Affect Scale , Profile Mood States , Visual Analogue scale , Self-assessment Manikin Rating Scale ) perceive exhaustion ( Borg Ratings Perceived Exertion scale ) . In addition , blood lactate heart rate obtain session .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Physical activity consider one important health relate aspect 21st century . In Norway , large epidemiological study show 30 % adult population meet physical activity recommendation 150 minute per week moderate-to-vigorous intensity physical activity . Also , study show large dropout rate lifestyle intervention , approximately 50 % drop physical activity intervention within 6 month start . One explanation dropout performance exercise vigorous intensity . Very vigorous intensity physical activity experience unpleasant . According dual-mode theory positive affective response low-to-moderate intensity physical activity , whereas vigorous intensity physical activity trigger negative affective response lead reduce motivation exercise . Unfortunately , many study perform affective response exercise use one session . The study examine change affective response series exercise use vigorous intensity anaerobic threshold , therefore unknown whether similar affective response occur vigorous intensity aerobe exercise . The aim study examine acute affective response series exercise session different intensity young healthy adult . To examine , randomize control clinical trial three different group ( moderate intensity training ( MIT ) , high-intensity aerobic interval training ( HAIT ) high-intensity sprint interval training ( HIIT ) ) conduct . A power calculation show need recruitment 30 participant . The sample consist healthy young adult . All participant perform one VO2max test , five session intensity randomize . All six session ( test + exercise session ) conduct within two week .</detailed_description>
