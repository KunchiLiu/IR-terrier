	<brief_summary>Patients eligible study type blood cancer call T-cell leukemia lymphoma ( lymph gland cancer ) . The body different way fight infection disease . No one way seem perfect fight cancer . This research study combine two different way fight disease , antibodies T cell , hop work together . Antibodies type protein protect body bacterial disease . T cell , also call T lymphocyte , special infection-fighting blood cell kill cell include tumor cell . Both antibody T cell use treat patient cancer ; show promise , strong enough cure patient . T lymphocytes kill tumor cell normally enough kill tumor cell . Some researcher take T cell person 's blood , grown laboratory give back person . The antibody use study call anti-CD5 . It first come mouse develop immunity human leukemia . This antibody stick T-cell leukemia lymphoma cell substance outside cell call CD5 . CD5 antibody use treat people T-cell leukemia lymphoma . For study , anti-CD5 change instead float free blood join T cell . When antibody join T cell way call chimeric receptor . In laboratory , investigator also find T cell work well protein stimulate T cell also add , one call CD28 . Adding CD28 make cell grow well last long body , thus give cell well chance kill leukemia lymphoma cell . In study investigator go attach CD5 chimeric receptor CD28 add patient 's T cell . The investigator test long cell last . These CD5 chimeric receptor T cell CD28 investigational product approve Food Drug Administration .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>To make T cell investigator take patient 's blood stimulate growth factor make T cell grow . To get CD5 antibody CD28 attach surface T cell , investigator insert antibody gene T cell . This do virus call retrovirus make study carry antibody gene T cell . This virus also help investigator find T cell patient 's blood inject . Because patient receive cell new gene patient follow total 15 year see long term side effect gene transfer . When patient enrol study , assign dose CD5 chimeric receptor-T cell . Several study suggest infuse T cell need room able proliferate ( grow ) accomplish function may happen many T cell circulation . Because , patient receive two chemotherapy medication prior receive CD5 chimeric receptor-T cell . One medication call cyclophosphamide fludarabine . The patient receive 3 daily dos drug , end least one day patient receive chimeric receptor-T cell . These drug decrease number patient 's T cell CD5 chimeric receptor T cell infuse also help decrease number cell may interfere chimeric receptor-T cell work well . Although expect effect patient 's tumor dose patient receive , drug part many regimen use treat leukemia lymphoma . The patient give injection cell vein IV assign dose . The injection take 1 10 minute . Before patient receives injection , may give dose Benadryl Tylenol . The treatment give Center Cell Gene Therapy Texas Children 's Hospital Houston Methodist Hospital . The patient follow clinic injection 3 hour , patient remain locally least 3 week infusion . If patient experience side effect , may hospitalize evaluation management . If 4-6 week evaluation period infusion , patient achieve complete response ( measure bone marrow radiology scan ) , patient 's primary oncology doctor may decide patient proceed bone marrow transplant , time patient remove treatment portion study . If 4-6 week evaluation period infusion , patient seem experience benefit ( confirmed radiological and/or bone marrow study , physical exam and/or symptom ) achieve complete response ( therefore suitable proceed bone marrow transplant ) , patient may able receive three additional dos T cell patient wish , patient experience serious side effect cell . These additional infusion would least 4-6 week apart dose level patient receive first time lower dose . The patient may receive cyclophosphamide fludarabine additional dos T cell . Before treated , patient receive series standard medical test : Physical exam History ; Blood test measure blood cell , kidney liver function ; Pregnancy test female patient child bear potential ; Measurements patient 's tumor scan and/or bone marrow study The patient also receive standard medical test get infusion : Physical exam History ; Blood test measure blood cell , kidney liver function ; Measurements patient 's tumor scan and/or bone marrow study 6 week infusion To learn way CD5 chimeric receptor-T cell work long last body , extra blood drawn . The total amount day 10 teaspoon ( 50 mL ) 3 mL per 2.2 pound body weight child . This volume consider safe may decrease patient anemic . This blood may draw central line patient one . Blood take chemotherapy drug , several hour T cell infusion , 1 week , 2 week , 3 week ( optional ) , 4 week , 6 week 8 week ( optional ) infusion , 3 month , 6 month , 9 month , 1 year , every 6 month 4 year , yearly total 15 year .</detailed_description>
