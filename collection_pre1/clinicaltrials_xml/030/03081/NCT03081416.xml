	<brief_title>`` THINK Trial : Treatment Headache With IntraNasal Ketamine : A Randomized Controlled Trial Evaluating Efficacy Intranasal Ketamine Versus Standard Therapy Management Primary Headache Syndromes Emergency Department ''</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This randomize , single-blind , placebo control trial evaluate efficacy sub-dissociative dose ketamine versus standard care therapy acute headache management patient present emergency department headache chief compliant . Standard care include 25 mg diphenhydramine ( DIP ) IV , 10 mg metoclopramide ( MET ) IV , +/- 15-30 mg ketorolac +/- 10 mg dexamethasone ( DEX ) IV discretion treat provider . This study approve Brooke Army Medical Center ( BAMC ) institutional review board clinicaltrials.gov registration pending . A convenience sample patient 18 65 year age chief complaint headache consider enrollment . Potential subject present SAMMC ED chief complaint headache . Attempts engage subject earlier ED Course ( EDC ) make . This mitigate interruption subject 's EDC , possible withdrawal control group , lack subject interest study . The triage nurse inform PI AI patient present ED chief complaint headache . Patients meet inclusion criterion provide brochure briefing study . If willing participate , member research team obtain write consent . Patient screening , enrollment , patient consent , data collection perform PI AI . Each AI complete training regard study detail , inclusion/exclusion criterion , atomization , intranasal delivery , ketamine pharmacokinetics conduct PI . Once patient consent team member obtain study packet , patient assign study identification number . The study packet contain required form , survey , Wand documentation form . The study personnel write patient 's standard order sheet `` SDDK Protocol , Patent # __ , __kg '' All females child-bearing age hysterectomy tubal ligation receive pregnancy test . This standard test perform ED consider part routine practice . A pregnancy test females one test require patient undergoing clearance among labs applicable study . Baseline pain score determine use 100 mm visual analogue scale , describe patient `` pain '' 0 `` bad pain imaginable '' 100 . A patient determine eligible enrollment baseline VAS score 50 great report . A study investigator record patient 's body weight baseline vital sign . Additional demographic record include age , gender , comorbid medical condition headache classification . Once subject determine meet inclusion/exclusive criterion agree participate study sign consent form , patient randomize via permutated-block randomization ketamine standard care treatment group . An intravenous catheter initiate subject 1000 mL normal saline IV bag start patient per provider discretion.62 Once medication either treatment arm obtain ready administer PI AI document time zero . The standard care arm administer 10mg MET , 25 mg DIP +/- 15-30 mg KET +/- 10mg dexamethasone IV push . 10 mg MET add 1000 mL normal saline bag infuse bolus 1000 mL normal saline bag empty . In addition , standard care arm administer volume atomize intranasal normal saline calculate dose 0.75mg/kg ketamine . The Ketamine arm administer intranasal SDDK via atomizer base previous study regard intranasal ketamine administration ED initial dose 0.75 mg/kg.2 The treat nurse prepare SDDK use weight base dose table find study packet . The treat nurse give syringe SDDK AI/PI verification administration . Each patient also administer 0.5ml , 0.5-1ml 2.5ml normal saline bolus place DIP , +/- KET +/- DEX maximum three bolus . An additional 2ml normal saline bolus add 1000 mL normal saline bag place MET 1000 mL normal saline bag infuse bolus bag empty . Approximately 30 minute initial ketamine administration , study subject ask would like additional dose medication headache . If study subject request additional medication , patient receive single repeat dose 0.25mg/kg intranasal ketamine . This time choose empirically reasonable time frame clinic reassessment analgesic affect . 60 minute medication give , subject participation study conclude routine ED care resume . At time subject ask would like additional medication treatment headache . If would like additional medication , rescue analgesia may give discretion ED provider manage patient . Also , point treat provider feel analgesia inadequate either patient verbalization provider assessment , rescue medication may provide treat provider 's discretion . Study investigator record treatment arm pain score , vital sign , adverse effect 10 , 30 , 60 90 minute . Total hospital course time also document . Adverse effect record base Side Effects Rating Scale Dissociative Anesthetics ( SERDA ) include fatigue , dizziness , nausea , headache , feeling unreality , change hear , mood change , general discomfort hallucination . Although SERDA frequently report five point scale , patient grade adverse effect answer `` yes '' `` '' . An adverse effect consider serious result clinical symptom unable abated clinical intervention tincture time . At time discharge , final pain score record use 10 point numerical rating score ( NRS ) 0 mean 'no pain ' 10 meaning `` bad pain possible . '' Patients also ask believe get study drug standard care . A final ED encounter satisfaction score record use 10 point numerical rating score ( NRS ) 0 mean ' Very dissatisfied ' 1-0 meaning `` Very satisfied . '' Follow-up occur via telephone use script phone conversation ( included package ) 48-72 hour post-discharge . All subject query via script interview adverse effect use SERDA element whether patient continue perceive headache pain duration previous headache relief . Again , pain assess use 10 point NRS . Additional information collect via follow communication include , limited change medication , new diagnosis , unplanned visit admission . Subject ask contact information include phone number email address follow-up . Phone contact primary method contact . If , two phone call attempt , PI unsuccessful establish patient contact , script email sent request subject contact protocol staff complete survey . If patient unable contact lose follow-up medical record query additional contact phone number available . Veteran 's Affairs system search method exhaust without result . The protocol team attempt contact patient 5 day hospital discharge date . If patient contact time frame subject assume lose follow-up . The primary outcome change pain level document VAS study initiation discharge . Secondary outcome include treatment efficiency ( time pain relief ) , change pain score discharge follow side effect profile use SERDSA questionnaire . All research complete either PI AI available ED enroll consent patient .</detailed_description>
