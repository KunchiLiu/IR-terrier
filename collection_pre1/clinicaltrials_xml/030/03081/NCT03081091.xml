	<brief_title>Effects Acupuncture Pain Quality Life People Affected With Chronic Widespread Pain .</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Chronic Widespread Pain ( CWP ) define spinal pain last least three month involve right left side body , waist . CWP highly prevalent condition . According Clauw et al. , affect 10-12 % population , accord Bergman et al. , 10-11 % . More recent study show similar data . For part , Mas et al . ( 2008 ) find nationwide study prevalence fibromyalgia Spain 4.2 % woman 0.2 % men , mainly age range 40-49 year . All study perform country develop world , time , also analyse prevalence fibromyalgia ( FM ) among population . Currently , acupuncture successfully used China treatment many chronic disease . However , West , situation quite different : acupuncture little know commonly use , give thus rise mistrust misunderstanding . Nevertheless , recent year , study publish East West showing , one hand , intention traditional Chinese medicine examine technique , , importance recognition Western medical world start bestow upon Chinese medicine . METHODS/DESIGN Objectives This study seek meet follow objective : ass whether acupuncture bring decrease pain improvement quality life people suffer chronic widespread pain ; ass whether use acupuncture lead improved sleep quality . Hypothesis Acupuncture succeed reduce pain suffered people affect chronic widespread pain ( CWP ) improve quality life . Acupuncture improve pain different item impact quality life ( sleep quality performance daily activity ) . Design Clinical trial . Controlled triple-blind prospective study . 100 participant randomly distribute two group : intervention group ( A ) , receive individualized acupuncture treatment ; control group ( S ) , receive sham acupuncture use randomization 1:1 . Recruitment The participant study people 18 year old belonging different association people affect fibromyalgia area Terres de l'Ebre , particularly association town Deltebre , Amposta , Sant Carles de la RÃ¡pita Tortosa . Researchers come entity order present study public conference . Once requests participation receive case assessed basis inclusion exclusion criterion , participant inform whole research process personal interview . After , receive information sheet informed consent form , encourage read sign . Inclusion exclusion criterion Inclusion criterion - Meeting criterion set American College Rheumatology diagnosis chronic widespread pain . - Accepting sign inform consent participation study . - Being old 18 year . Exclusion criterion - Suffering malignant disease active rheumatologic disorder ( osteoporosis , rheumatoid arthritis , lupus erythematosus , etc. ) . - Suffering coxarthrosis severe gonarthrosis . - Having previously receive acupuncture treatment . Randomization People meet inclusion criterion , subsequently inform nature study sign informed consent , assign one group study . Randomization carry personnel one perform treatment basis list obtain software EPIDAT ( Xunta de Galicia ) , manner shall 50 people group : one treat acupuncture accord traditional technique improve pain , whereas act control group receive sham acupuncture . The researcher conduct treatment provide patient ' medical history together correspond allocation . Masking Participants blind intervention . They provide eye mask see needle use intervention . Moreover , type equipment use participant ( although guide tube insert needle necessary true acupuncture ) . Given fact person carry intervention different one assessing effect latter know group evaluate subject belong , well fact person responsible statistic third person ignores two group receive true acupuncture , triple-blind study . Intervention The study conduct accord STRICTA guideline , lay right way proceed carry scientific study field acupuncture . Patients take part trial receive total 5 session acupuncture ( true sham , depend group belong within study ) : 4 session ( one per week ) 5th session 15 day last one . Intervention group ( A ) The treatment perform personalized treatment criterion base use Yuan Luo point . In clinical practice , Yuan ( source ) point Luo ( connect ) point use jointly , link two associated meridian ( external-internal ) way , assess state meridian 's path , Yuan point combine Luo point couple meridian vice versa ; depend condition muscle fibres path want treat . Generally , use transfer energy one meridian vice versa , depend condition present patient . The needle use treatment single-use needle two different gauge size . One size use depend area treat physical condition patient . The needle gauge size use study follow : Dong Bang siliconized needle 0.25 mm x 40 mm Dong Bang siliconized needle 0.20 mm x 30 mm The therapist assess patient 's condition accord traditional Chinese medicine look relationship patient 's affected area paths acupuncture meridian . Subsequently , combination Yuan Luo point treat determined . This procedure follow every acupuncture session , way combination point use depend evolution symptom . Control group ( C ) Sham acupuncture : The course action patient group use sham acupuncture group receive real treatment : patient supine position , clean treated area , use eye mask treatment selection point follow previously describe Yuan Luo point ' criterion , base traditional Chinese medicine . The difference sham acupuncture lie way perform acupuncture technique . It follow validate technique sham acupuncture Park device , without needle penetration patient 's body . The Park device performance sham acupuncture consist two plastic tube , one sliding within , inside needle create device slide . The long tube attach circular base , adhesive surface stick skin device needle fall . Blunt end needle use technique thus needle get pass skin produce cutaneous stimulation similar conventional acupuncture needle . These needle supply kit contains Park sham acupuncture device register European Union CE 0120 . Study variables The main study variable pain quality life . Pain assess use Visual Analogue Scale ( VAS ) . The VAS consist 10 mm line endpoint 'no pain ' 'worst pain imaginable ' . The Fibromyalgia Impact Questionnaire ( FIQ ) use analyse quality life . The FIQ multidimensional questionnaire design specifically assess functional capacity fibromyalgia patient . It design self-administered patient . The value FIQ 0 100 , 0 best state health 100 bad . It take five minute complete FIQ . In study , Spanish version Revised Fibromyalgia Impact Questionnaire ( FIQR ) use , prove reliability good construct validity . The secondary variable sleep quality subjective perception participant regard effect treatment . The Medical Outcomes Study Sleep Scale ( MOS-SS ) use assess sleep quality . This specific questionnaire include 12 item assess data quantity quality sleep . Items ' response assign score use conventional scoring rule , high score indicate great severity sleep disturbance . The subjective perception participant regard effect treatment assess Patient Global Impression Improvement Scale ( PGI-I ) . The PGI-I consist single question patient ask classify relief obtain treatment follow accord seven-point scale 'very much well much bad ' . Only responses 'very much good ' 'much well ' associate successful treatment . All response option define treatment failure . These variable collect 8 week study , base individual interview patient session intervention complete . The interview patient conduct first session , physiotherapy clinical record create study test take first time . During next 3 week , one weekly session acupuncture take place , thus add 4 acupuncture session . Before fourth study session , test take . Then , another week rest intervention , 6th week study , new acupuncture intervention perform . One week without intervention follow eighth week study devote carry test order retrieve survey data . It important note , last week study , particular test conduct first time : one related patient 's impression improvement treatment ( PGI-I ) . The data collect researcher # 2 , blind specific intervention group subject belong . Calculation sample size Acupuncture consider effective pain management improvement accord VAS scale equal great 20 % . On basis previous study , calculate , order obtain alpha error 0.05 study power 80 % , sample 90 people require ( 45 per group ) . Since dropout 10 % foreseen , number extend 100 ( 50 per group ) . Statistical analysis Demographic basal variable define use different measure . For quantitative variable , follow use : mean , standard deviation confidence interval 95 % . In addition , case variable normal distribution , robust descriptive statistic foreseen calculation , median , interquartile range minimum maximum value . In case qualitative variable , frequency distribution drawn . In order ass potential change instrument scale use study time , contrast dependent variable use , namely ANOVA test repeat measure Friedman test , depend whether distribution variable normal . The Shapiro-Wilks test use normality test . On hand , difference exist among different moment instrument evaluate , ANOVA test repeat measure allow analysis whether difference different depend type intervention perform . Similarly , variable ass change main variable study create non-parametric contrast do order analyse whether change equal among two group . To finalise , multivariate model apply order verify whether intervention group improve parameter measure ( linear logistic regression depend dependent variable 's nature ) . Such model validate standard procedure . Processing data In order ensure proper collection processing data obtain , manage qualified staff university implement clinical research coordinator . Safety Participants study control time adverse effect complication , swell , pain , hematoma needle insertion area , discomfort , dizziness heart palpitation receive treatment . After every session start next one , question ask participant visual inspection carry order ass potential undesirable effect last intervention . Ethical principle The Clinical Research Ethics Committee ( CREC ) Hospital Universitario Sant Joan de Reus approve protocol approval reference number ( 15-07-30/7aclaproj1 ) . The patient ' data protect used purpose research .</detailed_description>
