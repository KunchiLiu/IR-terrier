	<brief_summary>The purpose study determine effect insulin suspension start exercise individual type 1 diabetes . A total 3 session require project . The first familiarization session require complete informed consent , anthropometric measurement ( height , weight , body fat percentage ) , questionnaire , test maximal aerobic fitness . The remain 2 session steady-state aerobic exercise well circuit exercise .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Suspending Basal Insulin Levels Exercise Adults With Type 1 Diabetes</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Written inform consent collect first day familiarization session individual wish participate . A researcher provide brief explanation continuous glucose monitor ( CGM ) work ( Medtronic Inc. , Canada ) first visit laboratory . They also describe CGM sensor insertion process occur participant wear one past . The participant clean sanitize area insert CGM superficially skin connect transmitter device sensor . The CGM wear total 7 day remove participant return researcher download . The sport armband also place left upper arm wear continuously 7 day . The principal student investigator ( PSI ) principal investigator ( PI ) provide participant information sport armband place skin immediately follow . This device simply sit surface skin , specific placement activation must apply PSI PI . Finally , exercise visit , Zephyr bioharness connect chest level around rib cage . This device sit top skin simply like elastic band around rib cage . The bioharness worn exercise visit disconnect end activity . Blood glucose level monitor frequently exercise use Contour Link glucometer ( Bayer , Canada ) . Participants use personal lancing device finger poke , investigator provide glucometer test strip . Each blood sugar check record data binder along carbohydrate intake , change basal rate pump setting , food intake . If blood glucose level reach 3.9 mmol/L less , participant ask stop activity immediately consume fast-acting carbohydrate ( i.e . Dextrose tablet ( Dex4 , USA ) ) . 15-minutes ingestion carbohydrate , blood glucose test allow individual return activity safely . On last day test , participant ask return CGM , sport armband , bioharness research team . The data later upload analyze . Patients undergo fitness assessment ( maximal aerobic capacity ) visit 1 perform 40-minutes continuous ( treadmill jog ) 40-minutes intermittent ( calisthenics ) high-intensity type exercise ( visit 2 3 ) . Upon entry laboratory , participant ask check blood glucose level use glucometer provide . The first exercise session consist 40-minute treadmill walk/jog ~40-50 % VO2max . The second exercise session include various aerobic anaerobic activity include push-ups , plank , jump jack , high knee , etc . Regular finger capillary blood sample collect every 10-minutes exercise . Once exercise session complete , participant ask remain laboratory 30-minutes additional blood glucose measurement ensure hypoglycemic episode occur post-exercise . Participants give contour link glucometer monitor glucose level throughout even night .</detailed_description>
