	<detailed_description>Objectives 1 . To identify whether rate/quality recovery affect deep neuromuscular block ( DNB ) reversal sugammadex versus light/moderate neuromuscular block reverse neostigmine couple desflurane sevoflurane patient undergo operative gynecological abdominal laparoscopic surgery least 1-hour duration . Hypothesis 1 . The technique deep neuromuscular block reversal sugammadex result improve quality recovery , include cognition , compare current standard care technique use light/moderate neuromuscular block reverse neostigmine patient undergo operative gynecological abdominal laparoscopic surgery least 1-hour duration . Background : Importance assessment quality recovery Recovery follow general anesthesia complex issue confound type surgery , inflammation , different anesthetic drug technique , patient co-morbidities , differ patient clinician perception constitutes good recovery . Recovery single entity rather cover many aspect domains physiological recovery , pain nausea , emotion mood , return normal life work activity , cognitive function . It entity difficult quantify , make difficult study systematic manner . For anesthesiologist , poor recovery often relay surgeon day week event , usually categorized adverse outcome . Research tool Aldrete QoR scale , focus early physiological recovery , immediate perioperative period . These recovery score sensitive enough measure rate recovery ( change time ) , design repeated measure . They also inadequate identify poor cognitive recovery . In 2007 , international group anesthesiologists neuropsychologists form advisory board create new quality recovery scale . The aim produce tool simple perform , sensitive enough detect change multiple domains recovery time . The initial validation experiment include 700 patient , work publish Anesthesiology . It call Postoperative Quality Recovery Scale ( PostopQRS ) . Six domains recovery identify : physiological , nociceptive ( pain nausea ) emotive ( anxiety depression ) , functional recovery ( return activity daily live ) , cognitive recovery , overall patient perspective domain include satisfaction . The scale complete prior surgery provide baseline value , repeat user-defined interval . From subsequent discriminant validation study , time point include early late measure 15 minute , 40 minute , 1 3 day , 3 month completion anesthesia ( typically define last surgical stimulation ) . Recovery broadly define return baseline value well , except cognitive domain tolerance factor include allow normal performance variability , patient allow perform little bad baseline still score recover . Because repeated test tend learn effect , cognitive domain use parallel form , small learn show . One important benefit PostopQRS scale enable recovery quantify measure . This make possible compare different intervention express purpose develop clinical intervention improve quality recovery . The PostopQRS offer tool provide recovery process examine . There tool existence provide comprehensive , sensitive assessment multiple aspect domains recovery , yet relatively simple perform . Validation study perform show good discriminative ability ( 5-8 ) . Ease use facilitate use web base data entry system ability use telephone conduct survey discharge form hospital . Telephone survey show equivalent face face interview use PostopQRS . Further , PostopQRS allow user drill identify recovery domain affect individual real time well group audit . Quality recovery operative laparoscopy The majority literature compare different operative technique outcome measure aim specific complication length stay . Few study include quality recovery quality life measure secondary endpoint . However , potential benefit relate use sugammadex , study primarily center around deep neuromuscular block ( DNB ) facilitate low intraabdominal inflation pressure . Most outcomes relate operative condition little data patient center outcome especially discharge . The inclusion sugammadex permit use DNB , comparative group ( moderate block ) reverse neostigmine . It show patient operate low intraabdominal pressure DNB , operative condition rat well patient DNB , though absolute frequent crossover . That , patient moderate block low pressure , equally patient DNB require high inflation pressure . The data patient center outcome show reduce pain nausea DNB , lack evidence benefit recovery outcomes . This paucity data stress review article editorial DNB associate modest effect improve operate condition little data identify recovery benefit . Sugammadex effective drug reduce deep neuromuscular blockade There clinical question sugammadex highly effective reverse neuromuscular blockade rocuronium vecuronium . This subject Cochrane review include 18 randomize trial , show sugammadex reverse blockade rocuronium vecuronium independent depth block , superiority neostigmine . This aspect sugammadex require study . This translate low incidence residual blockade PACU compare neostigmine reversal . The `` safety '' benefit use sugammadex proven , necessarily translate good outcome . Sugammadex , however , enable drug facilitate deep neuromuscular blockade , allow anesthesiologist continue block end surgery reliably reverse block . This possible neostigmine reversal , one must wait train four count least 2 twitch ( TOF ratio &gt; 0.7 ) safely reverse block neostigmine . Sugammadex single intervention The role sugammadex single intervention apply reverse neuromuscular block , block moderate TOF 0.7 achieve , outcome restrict reversal blockade . When sugammadex use tool facilitate deep muscular block , intervention principally DNB rather sugammadex . In randomized trial compare sugammadex neostigmine reversal DNB , extra time anesthesia continued neostigmine group confounder post-operative outcome . In study compare sugammadex vs. neostigmine reverse DNB , anesthetic time neostigmine group almost double sugammadex group ( 47 vs 95 min ) . This markedly increased anesthetic duration due time take TOF ratio exceed 0.9 facilitate safe extubation . It therefore possible examine issue deep neuromuscular block unbundle sugammadex anesthetic technique require . Outcomes confounders assess post-operative quality recovery There data assess impact anesthetic drug rather surgical technique different operation post-operative quality recovery . It likely different anesthetic drug may independently contribute change post-operative quality recovery , use deep neuromuscular block laparoscopic surgery . The two commonly use anesthetic drug propofol sevoflurane . Both relatively short act drug , wide variation offset , particularly prolonged anesthesia , patient factor morbid obesity . Desflurane volatile agent short acting , importantly highly predictable offset , independent patient factor obesity operation duration . In patient receive moderate neuromuscular block reversal neostigmine , use desflurane lead earlier response command return airway reflexed compare sevoflurane . The investigator research group currently conduct research different anesthetic technique . Previously , investigator study effect desflurane vs. propofol patient undergoing cardiac surgery , show less cognitive dysfunction one week surgery three month surgery desflurane . The investigator recently conclude publish pilot study investigate propofol sedation vs. desflurane general anesthesia supplement spinal anesthesia total hip replacement . The participant number small meaningful statistical analysis , trend towards improve recovery well cognitive recovery desflurane group ( absolute difference 15 % OR 2.3 ) . What interesting , though , early difference negligible , trend occur 1 month 3 month surgery . In study , investigator wish primarily investigate effect role DNB , reduce potential confounding different anesthetic technique , standardize anesthetic use short act anesthetic bundle , use desflurane couple short act opiate multimodal analgesia patient undergo operative gynecological abdominal laparoscopic surgery least 1-hour duration . Clinical significance Quality recovery emerge field within anesthesia great importance . Although large outcome study important anesthesia , change focus `` mortality morbidity study '' , quality recovery . The reason frequency mortality low result intervention reduce mortality event large number require demonstrate improvement surgery anesthesia mortality outcome . However early data PostopQRS well clinical report indicate quality recovery often poor many patient , yet identify treat anesthesiologist . There implication individual patient , practice anesthesia , community ( safe return work drive ) . If provide deep neuromuscular block lead improve quality outcome , essential use sugammadex reverse block . There may benefit ( cognitive recovery ) may worsen drug neostigmine avoidance neostigmine may mechanism improve recovery . The couple drug similar offset time may lead improved quality recovery .</detailed_description>
