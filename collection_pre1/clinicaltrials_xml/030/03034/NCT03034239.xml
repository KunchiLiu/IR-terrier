	<brief_summary>Purpose : study effect insect protein performance hypertrophy 8 week resistance training . Hypothesis : Insect protein supplementation enhances effect resistance training muscle mass muscle strength . Primary outcome : Muscle hypertrophy muscle strength Design : Two group healthy young men ( age : 18-30 year ) resistance training experience , structural resistance training perform last 12 month . Randomized control intervention study +/- insect protein ( placebo group ingest isocaloric carbohydrate ) . Both group perform 8 week progressive resistance training ( 4/week ) aim induce muscle hypertrophy .</brief_summary>
