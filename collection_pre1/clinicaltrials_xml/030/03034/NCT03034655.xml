	<brief_title>Reducing Rate Falls Older People Means Vestibular Rehabilitation ( ReFOVeRe Study )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Accidental fall , particularly elderly , one important socio-healthcare problem age western society . Many factor condition favour fall ; one old age , usually related decline sensorial function worsen balance Vestibular rehabilitation show effective improve balance reduce number fall old people . Previous study demonstrate exercise computerized dynamic posturography ( CDP ) effective vestibular rehabilitation strategy group age . But CDP expensive widespread . It would important minimize cost posturographic vestibular rehabilitation . This study compare vestibular rehabilitation two different posturographic device ( CDP mobile posturographic system vibrotactile stimulation ) , people 65 year . Additionally , try ass whether reduction number vestibular rehabilitation session ( five ) lead improvement balance reduce number fall similar obtain ten session .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Persons high risk fall shall meet least two follow requirement : Having fall least last 12 month . Using 15 second need support TUG test . Obtaining mean CDP SOT balance score &lt; 68 % . Having fall least CDP SOT . A score Mobile posturography gSBDT &gt; 60 % . Cognitive decline reduce cultural level prevents patient understanding assessment , vestibular rehabilitation exercise grant informed consent . Organic condition prevent stand two foot , necessary assessment balance performance VR exercise . Balance disorder cause condition age ( neurologic , vestibular , ... . ) . Current treatment drug potentially disturb balance .</criteria>
