	<brief_title>Modulation Steroid Immunosuppression Alveolar Efferocytosis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Treating chronic obstructive pulmonary disease ( COPD ) patient inhaled glucocorticosteroids convincingly show increase risk pneumonia , responsible mechanism undefined . Work laboratory suggest possible mechanism , relate increase number cell die apoptosis lung COPD , especially emphysema . Uptake apoptotic cell ( `` efferocytosis '' ) suppress ability alveolar macrophage ( AM ) fight infection . By markedly increase AM efferocytosis , glucocorticoid plus apoptotic cell cause great immune defect either stimulus alone . These defect include reduction kill Streptococcus pneumoniae human AM murine AM vitro , clearance viable pneumococcus lung mouse . This effect call glucocorticoid augment efferocytosis ( GCAE ) . MicroRNAs ( miRNAs ) 19-25 nucleotide-long non-coding RNAs coordinately target large number gene reduce protein product . Preliminary data imply defective AM function cause down-regulation specific miRNAs GCAE ( apoptotic cell alone glucocorticosteroids alone ) . The long-term goal project develop novel inhalational treatment base transient over-expression specifically decrease miRNAs , reverse defective AM immune function COPD patient take inhaled glucocorticoid present community-acquired pneumonia . This project use ex vivo investigation AM human volunteer ( never-smokers ; smoker normal spirometry ; COPD subject current former smoker ) , establish murine model pneumococcal pneumonia . Its immediate goal : ( ) confirm GCAE increase pneumococcal pneumonia risk severity , process , validate murine model test strategy reverse defect ; ( b ) define GCAE-induced AM defect functionally whole-transcriptome analysis , identify gene miRNAs uniquely regulate GCAE x pneumococcus interaction ; ( c ) validate optimize miRNA-over-expression reverse adverse effect GCAE AM defensive function . Successful completion project could lead precisely personalized therapy well outcomes COPD , currently third lead cause death USA</detailed_description>
