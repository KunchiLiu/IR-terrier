	<brief_summary>Acute pulmonary embolism ( APE ) common disease , involve significant morbidity mortality . The clinical presentation APE many face acceptable suspect disease patient present least one following : shortness breath , pleuritic chest pain , cough , sub-febrile fever hemoptysis . The relationship syncope APE entirely clear . Prandoni et al conduct systematic process exclusion / confirmation APE patient hospitalize first investigation syncope . In study APE diagnose 17 % patient . In 12.7 % patient alternative explanation syncope APE diagnose . Interestingly , 25 % patient manifestation pulmonary embolism apart syncope . According updated clinical guideline , APE routinely test etiology syncope systematically exclude . According new data present Prandoni et al , mean significant percentage patient hospitalize investigation syncope discharge suffer APE ( case probably event unprovoked pulmonary embolism ) without treatment anticoagulant , make particularly prone PE recurrence . Aim . To examine incidence pulmonary embolism ( Pulmonary Embolism , PE ) , VTE ( venous thromboembolism , VTE ) patient hospitalize first investigation syncope .</brief_summary>
