	<brief_summary>The morbidity associate low birth weight ( VLBW ) infant constitute major health problem significant emotional financial burden family nation . The key reduce burden early diagnosis . This research first step towards intervention cerebral growth long-term neurodevelopmental morbidity VLBW infant . The propose research design fabricate new technological innovation wearable soft-sensors , call flexi-mitts , measure force modulation joint angle hand ( wrist finger ) toddler . Building upon investigator ' ongoing work , plan engineer stretchable electronics safe , toddler-scaled flexi-mitts measure plan force modulation . Additionally , investigator plan parent/guardian wear glove determine relative contribution child adult child 's learning . In way adult assist learn walk , may assist learn play . The force data may analyze way child 's data . The investigator ' new flexi-mitt technology potential provide new diagnostic technology development clinical assessment norm . With additional trial technology large number young child , may possible clinician day care provider eventually make measurement plan force modulation play setting .</brief_summary>
