	<detailed_description>Purpose background Inhaled corticosteroid asthma phenotype Inhaled corticosteroid ( ICS ) cornerstone treatment asthma . ICS act locally airways several pathway limit inflammation , primarily reduction eosinophilic inflammation . In clinical practice however substantial part adult patient asthma eosinophilic inflammation airways despite reduce lung function increase contractility smooth muscle airways i.e. , airway hyperresponsiveness ( AHR ) . This group patient non-eosinophilic asthma ( NEA ) represent 50 % adult asthmatic even high occurrence among patient refer specialist . The effect ICS NEA debate despite lack eosinophilic inflammation , ICS show significantly reduce AHR patient NEA , suggest mechanistic pathway different reduction eosinophilic inflammation . Airway smooth muscle inhale corticosteroid Airway smooth muscle ( ASM ) abundant tissue type airway . It play crucial part pathogenesis asthma serve important target therapy especially β-adrenergic agent extent anti-muscarinic agent , counteract bronchoconstriction . However also ICS propose direct action ASM cell affect contractility reduction intracellular Ca2+ regulation membrane bound receptor well limit cellular proliferation secretory function . The bronchodilating effect β-adrenergic agent animal model show potentiated administration corticosteroid . Inhaled corticosteroid Na+ , K+ pump Both ICS systemically administer prednisone show increase Na+ , K+ pump activity leucocytes patient asthma rat human systemically administer corticosteroid increase amount Na+ , K+ pump striate muscle 20-40 % 30-60 % respectively . We recently demonstrate similar effect ICS therapeutically relevant daily dose 1600 μg budesonide , administer respiratory tract inhalation , increase amount Na+ , K+ pump striate muscle 17 % . 1.1.4 The Na+ , K+ pump airway smooth muscle The Na+ , K+ pump create inward Na+ current remove Na+ intracellular lumen cell . This may drive extrusion Ca2+ lumen ASM cell Na+ , Ca2+ exchanger lower intracellular Ca2+ concentration . Since Ca2+ play central role smooth muscle contraction , low intracellular concentration may protect bronchoconstriction well contrary might reinforce AHR . In vitro study demonstrate disturbance leucocyte Na+ , K+ pump activity increase intracellular Na+ patient hyperreactivity asthma . Likewise vitro study human bronchial muscle show increased AHR concentration intracellular Ca2+ well decrease β-adrenergic induced relaxation human bronchial muscle Na+ , K+ pump block . Bronchoconstriction airway remodel universal feature asthma especially bronchoconstriction extent relate propose disturbance Na+ , K+ pump activity positive effect ICS besides anti-inflammatory therefore suspect beneficial independent cellular pattern . However non-inflammatory effect might evident patient NEA since blur anti-inflammatory effect see patient EA . No study assess effect ICS ASM Na+ , K+ pump patient asthma . In present study investigator wish study difference Na+ , K+ pump content healthy versus asthmatic patient , whether reduction AHR observe asthmatic patient treat ICS attributable increase Na+ , K+ pump content ASM cell compare patient NEA versus EA . This result study two part : I . A comparison level Na+ , K+ pump ASM patient asthma v healthy subject . II . A description association change Na+ , K+ pump content ASM change AHR ICS patient asthma . Hypothesis Study part I : The amount ASM Na+ , K+ pump low adult patient asthma compare healthy subject . Study part II : The reduction airway hyperresponsiveness adult patient asthma treatment ICS related increase content Na+ , K+ pump ASM . We hypothesize association increase Na+ , K+ pump ASM change AHR ICS treatment strong NEA versus EA . Aim Study part I : To describe difference ASM content Na+ , K+ pump among healthy subject patient NEA EA respectively . Study part II : To describe correlation increase ASM content Na+ , K+ pump reduction airway hyperresponsiveness mannitol six week daily inhalation glucocorticoid , patient asthma . Perspectives Asthma common may difficult treat , especially non-eosinophilic phenotype . This study aim increase understand pathogenic mechanism asthma , unrelated inflammatory pathway . This may lead towards shift current paradigm asthma purely inflammatory condition , create novel understanding role ion transport regulation pathogenesis treatment asthma , ultimately reveal target novel treatment .</detailed_description>
