	<brief_title>Transcranial Direct Current Stimulation ( tDCS ) Post-Stroke Working Memory Deficits</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>After stroke , people often trouble remember something , solve problem , follow conversation . They also trouble concentrate , follow instruction , multitasking . These due stroke affect brain function call `` work memory '' . Working memory define ability hold think one 's mind second order remember task solve problem . People difficulty return normal life work memory problem . Currently , proven medical treatment work memory problem . Transcranial direct current stimulation ( tDCS ) painless , noninvasive brain stimulation technique show study improve work memory healthy subject . TDCS involve send weak electrical current head , thereby excite brain underneath . TDCS FDA-approved treatment condition , previous trial show may benefit movement language recovery stroke , well improve think ability . Studies show tDCS safe serious adverse event 10,000 subject study . This pilot study involve four visit Stony Brook University Hospital . The first baseline session subject perform outcome measure tDCS perform familiarization . The three session stimulation session subject undergo intervention 20 minute test tDCS effect outcome measure . The effect tDCS single session expect last hour . Subjects receive three different type stimulation . If study find short term benefit tDCS post-stroke work memory deficit , support full clinical trial multiple session tDCS give may provide long-term benefit .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Clinical diagnosis stroke radiographically proven ischemic hemorrhagic stroke ( MRI require ischemic stroke , CT sufficient hemorrhagic stroke ) . Subject report decline attention shortterm memory begin time stroke . Stroke occur least one month prior first stimulation session . Ability provide inform consent . Speak English ( require perform cognitive test ) Any brain disease affect cognition ( e.g. , multiple sclerosis , dementia ) . Active mental illness depression anxiety Large stroke involve cortex stimulation site ( use subject provide CT MRI ) . Currently take drug sodium and/or calcium channel blocker include amlodipine . This include seizure medication along nicardipine , nifedipine , nimodipine , verapamil diltiazem . Any history epilepsy . Subject report recent drug alcohol abuse within past year . Subject report pregnant breastfeeding . Moderate severe aphasia prevent subject communicate fully . Any pacemaker , intracranial electrode , implanted defibrillator , electrical implant .</criteria>
