	<brief_summary>A previous pilot study demonstrate commonly available glaucoma drop ( dorzolamide-timolol ) might decrease amount chronic swell patient wet age-related macular degeneration receive anti-vascular endothelial growth factor ( VEGF ) injection . This large study subject randomly assign receive glaucoma drop placebo ( artificial tear ) order confirm whether previous find valid . Subjects continue receive normally schedule anti-VEGF injection regular interval do prior enrollment . The addition regimen daily use eye drop ( dorzolamide-timolol artificial tear ) twice daily duration study . At end study , swell retina compare amount start drop see difference group use dorzolamide-timolol versus artificial tear .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Dorzolamide-timolol Combination With Anti-vascular Endothelial Growth Factor Injections Wet Age-related Macular Degeneration</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Intravitreal anti-vascular endothelial growth factor ( VEGF ) agent , include bevacizumab , ranibizumab , aflibercept , remain standard care treatment neovascular age-related macular degeneration ( AMD ) . Various treatment modality use agent propose , include monthly , pro nata , treat-and-extend regimen . Despite frequent consistent treatment anti-VEGF therapy , subset patient incomplete responder persistent exudation , include intraretinal edema , subretinal fluid ( SRF ) , and/or retinal pigment epithelial detachment ( PED ) spectral-domain optical coherence tomography ( SD-OCT ) . While clearance intravitreal anti-VEGF drug completely understand , study suggest outflow anterior chamber may play role . We hypothesize decrease aqueous production , outflow may also reduce could subsequently slow clearance intravitreal drug . In prior pilot study 10 eye 10 patient incomplete responder neovascular AMD , effect topical dorzolamide-timolol combination continue intravitreal anti-VEGF injection explore . Patients keep anti-VEGF drug well interval injection 2 visit enrollment course pilot study order minimize chance change note might result alter one variable . The mean central subfield thickness ( CST ) decrease 419.7 μm enrollment 334.1 μm final visit ( p=0.012 ) . Mean maximum subretinal fluid ( SRF ) height decrease 126.6 μm enrollment 56.5 μm final visit ( p=0.020 ) . This decrease mean CST SRF significant begin first visit initiation drop . Based initial pilot data , dorzolamide-timolol appear promising adjuvant treatment combination anti-VEGF injection incomplete anti-VEGF responder neovascular AMD . However , since control group pilot study , possible decrease exudation see result continue anti-VEGF therapy alone rather effect topical therapy . As result , randomize , placebo-controlled clinical trial well able assess efficacy dorzolamide-timolol setting .</detailed_description>
