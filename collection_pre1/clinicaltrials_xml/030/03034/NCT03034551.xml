	<brief_title>Mobile App With Patient Financial Incentives Adherence Heart Failure Medications &amp; Daily Self-Weighing</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Nonadherence cardiovascular medication daily weight monitor critical issue readmission hospital heart failure . Only 60 % patient adhere prescribe cardiovascular medication least 80 % day , 40 % monitor weight daily , despite own scale . Nationally , nonadherence contributes excessive HF readmission rate 50 % within 6 month , 24 % within 30 day discharge . To raise awareness accountability , Centers Medicare &amp; Medicaid Services ( CMS ) begin report rate 2009 , Affordable Care Act value-based contract payer establish financial penalty spur provider-based solution . Telehealth intervention ideal , low-cost , scalable method reduce readmission remotely enhance patient support . Telehealth intervention HF target medication compliance self-weighing demonstrated reduction readmission rate 80 % , yet widely adopt clinical practice due lack randomize , control study . We thus propose randomize , control study proprietary telehealth platform University Medical Center Princeton Plainsboro ( UMCPP ) enable remote support HF patient mobile app combine financial incentive motivate adherence medication self-weighing . Patients admit UMCPP primary admit discharge diagnosis heart failure reduce ejection fraction ( EF &lt; 40 % ) ( ICD-10 code I50.2_ ) invite participate study . Each patient intervention arm offer $ 150 incentive along Wellth app load smartphone . When user first log app , occur guidance healthcare provider train use , show large dollar amount earn enrol program - study $ 150 offer 90 day perfect adherence medication daily self-weighing use connect digital scale provide Wellth . Instructions also give state missed weight medication check-in result $ 2 deduction per day account pay monthly pay period . If 2 lb . great daily increase weight , 5 lb . weekly increase weight , detect patient , UMCPP physician nurse alert via automatic email text . A physician nurse call patient ass patient 's symptom ( i.e . increase shortness breath decrease exertional tolerance , medication dietary adherence ) . Once weight gain alert trigger , team continue receive additional data patient next 7 day see weight continue increase would trigger additional phone call patient physician notification . After call make patient , , clinical judgment physician nurse increase heart failure symptom , physician nurse suggest patient make appointment see doctor within next 48 hour . Benefits study intervention arm include good health , reduce risk readmission , concomitant reduction healthcare burden , well small tangible financial gain . Benefits society , assume widely applicable success , include reduction population-wide readmission rate due great health , reduction healthcare spending .</detailed_description>
