	<brief_summary>The B vitamin biotin widely available counter supplement , often advertise used promote health hair , skin nail . Commercially available counter biotin supplement contain dose range 10 mg/day ( ie 333 time higher recommend dietary allowance ) . The biotin molecule also sometimes used part lab technology measure hormone protein level blood . It possible high dos ingest biotin may interfere accurate hormone protein measurement use biotin related vitro measurement system . Such interference , present , could lead misdiagnosis . The study analyze laboratory level obtain streptavidin-biotin assay system ingest biotin currently available high dose supplement . The data compare measurement obtain prior one week stop biotin supplement .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Specimens collect venipuncture 3 time point , include baseline ( time 0 ) , one week biotin supplementation ( time 1 , day 7 ) , one week later ( time 2 , day 14 ) . The time 1 specimen draw approximately 2 hour last ingested dose biotin day 7 . Specimen collection include three 10 ml red top ( gel ) tube timepoint . Specimens separate isolation serum use routine method clinical chemistry laboratory . Serum store -80 degree C batch measurement describe Measurements Biotin level measure sample . Hormone measurement perform use specific commercially available streptavidin-biotin assay use different analyzer indicate . Immunoassay method , employ biotin-streptavidin methodology , use negative assay control .</detailed_description>
