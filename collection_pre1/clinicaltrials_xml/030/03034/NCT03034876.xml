	<detailed_description>Introduction : Acute kidney injury ( AKI ) complex disorder affect million child around world approximately 46 % critically ill individual develop acute kidney injury every year ( 1 , 2 ) . An annual incidence 3.3 cases/100,000 child along hospital mortality rate 25-50 % report developed country ( 3 ) This even high develop country , annual incidence 30-50 % ( 4 , 5 ) . Furthermore , acute kidney injury lead significant healthcare use , cost estimate 8 billion dollar ( 4 ) . An early diagnosis key prevent morbidity mortality relate AKI . The diagnosis AKI depend upon elevate serum creatinine level decrease urine output . Early detection AKI essential . The currently use creatinine clearance ( CrCl ) calculate Schwartz formula . The level serum creatinine poor marker early diagnosis . Because varies age , gender , hydration muscle mass metabolism . Creatinine never rise &gt; 50 % renal function lose , amount tubular secretion overestimate lower GFR , acute change GFR . During acute change GFR AKI , serum creatinine n't accurately depict kidney function steady state equilibrium achieve , may require several day . There biomarker , high sensitivity specificity , use tool early detection AKI , prevent burden mortality morbidity intensive care unit ( 6 , 7 ) . Neutrophil gelatinase-associated Lipocalcin ( NGAL ) recently identify one robust marker AKI ( 8 ) . Several publish report plasma NGA raise acute kidney injury rise serum creatinine ( 9 ) . A Study conduct Mishra et al , US show 2 hour sensitivity 70 % specificity 94 % NGAL predict AKI ( 10 ) . A developed country data show 84 % 79 % sensitivity , 96 % 90 % specificity NGAL predict AKI ( 2 , 11 ) , ( see Annexure 1 ) . However , scarce information available plasma NGAL early diagnostic marker Pakistan . Rationale : We know serum creatinine gold standard diagnosis AKI cheap test diagnose , rise 1 3 day injury . However , NGAL relatively costly test emerge biomarker identify AKI early stage , may future help u promptly institute reno-protective intervention like avoidance nephrotoxic exposure contrast agent , maintenance euvolemia perfusion pressure prevent kidney failing , decrease use expensive complicate renal supportive therapy like continuous renal replacement therapy ( CRRT ) well decrease morbidity mortality relate AKI . Objective : To determine diagnostic accuracy serum neutrophil gelatinase-associated Lipocalcin ( NGAL ) , detection acute kidney injury compare creatinine clearance gold standard , pediatric intensive care unit Aga khan university hospital Karachi . Methods : We conduct prospective observational study close multidisciplinary-cardiothoracic Pediatric Intensive Care Unit ( PICU ) Aga Khan University Hospital approval Ethical Review Committee . Operational Definition : Acute Kidney Injury ( AKI ) : AKI diagnose accord pediatric RIFLE criterion . Pediatric RIFLE criterion stratifies AKI eCrCl decrease 25 % first 48hours PICU . Shock : Shock define use vasoactive-inotropic support least 12 hour maintain hemodynamics acutely ill child PICU study . Neutrophil gelatinase-associated Lipocalcin ( NGAL ) : NGAL biomarker measure quantitatively rapid , non - competitive Fluorescence Immunoassay ( 12 ) . Level 150 mg/dl consider positive diagnosis AKI . Sample Size Calculation : If prevalence AKI child shock 46 % , sensitivity specificity plasma NGAL 0.9 0.79 respectively margin error 0.1 % , sample size 140 participant . Participants : - Inclusion Criteria : All child either gender age 1 month - 16 year require vasoactive-inotropic drug admission stay 48 hour PICU tertiary care unit Aga Khan University Hospital , Karachi . - Exclusion Criteria : All child chronic kidney disease previous history renal injury exclude Study Protocol : The participant fulfill inclusion exclusion criterion study enrol daily surveillance PICU . The informed consent obtain parent legal guardian . The amount blood 1/3rd tea spoon ( 1.5ml ) collect already exist central line without extra prick participant three different time interval 0 , 12 48 hour plasma-NGAL serum creatinine test PICU . Then sample sent main laboratory hospital . Blood test ( NGAL Serum Creatinine ) expense pay approve grant University Research Council . Serum NGAL measure quantitatively rapid , non - competitive Fluorescence Immunoassay ( 12 ) . The TriageÂ® NGAL test point - - care , fluorescence - base immunoassay use conjunction Triage Meter ( Biosite Inc . ) rapid quantitative measurement NGAL concentration . The serum creatinine measure Jafe 's method ADVIA 1800 Chemistry System ( Siemens Healthliners , Germany ) , creatinine clearance calculate modified Schwartz formula . ( 19 ) Data Collection : Data variable collect structured case report form include demographic variable ( age , gender , weight , height ) , clinical laboratory variable like admission diagnosis , comorbidities , severity illness score ( PRISM III score ) , use vasoactive drug , mechanical ventilation , urine output , fluid balance , serum creatinine plasma NGAL . The discharge status alive vs. expire , length mechanical ventilation hospitalization use renal supportive therapy like peritoneal dialysis also record case report form . Outcome : The primary outcome study evaluate level plasma NGAL child shock without AKI accord RIFLE criterion . Statistical Analysis : Data enter analyzed SPSS V20 ( SPSS Inc. Chicago , IL ) .Normally distribute continuous variable report mean standard deviation ( SD ) compare student 's test . Non-normally continuous distribute data report median interquartile range ( IQR ) compare Man Whitney test Kruskal Wallis test . The categorical data report proportion compare Fischer 's exact test Chi-square test . The association variable assess Spearman rank order correlation analysis . The diagnostic accuracy plasma NGAL predict AKI child shock define calculation Area Under Curve ( AUC ) Receiving Operating Characteristics ( ROC ) Curves . An AUC 0.5 good chance , whereas value 1.0 indicate perfect biomarker . A p-value &lt; 0.05 consider statistically significant . Ethical Consideration : All data variable store password protect computer strict confidentiality maintain .</detailed_description>
