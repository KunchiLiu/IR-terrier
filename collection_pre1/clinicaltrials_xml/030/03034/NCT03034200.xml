	<brief_summary>The purpose study learn new drug , ONC201 make tumor become small go away completely . Investigators also want learn ONC201 prevent new deposit cancer appear new place participant ( metastasis ) . A phase 2 study ONC201 PC-PG ( pheochromocytoma-paraganglioma ) neuroendocrine tumor determine whether inhibition DRD2 ( member dopamine receptor family ) safe neuroendocrine cancer include PC-PG . ONC201 investigational ( experimental ) agent favorable safety profile phase 1 early phase 2 clinical trial advance cancer . This study design choose see whether ONC201 associate reduction anti-hypertension medication , safety significant efficacy neuroendocrine tumor , especially PC-PG .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Phase 2 Study ONC201 Neuroendocrine Tumors</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Primary Objective To demonstrate objective response use MRI CT , positron emission tomography - computerize tomography ( PET-CT ) and/or PET-MRI imaging . The CT MRI image assess disease burden study entry compare week 6 3 month . Patients without progression 3 month continue treatment image 6 , 9 12 month study entry . Metabolic response compare study entry PET-CT PET-MRI scan 6 week , 3 month 12 month . Secondary Objectives Progression - free Survival : This calculate accord Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors ( RECIST ) Response Assessment Neuro-Oncology ( RANO ) /or development new disease Overall survival : Overall survival determine email telephone contact . PG-PG ( ) : determine efficacy ONC201 reduction dose anti-hypertensive medication . Study Design : Phase 2 open-label fix dose study Metastatic neuroendocrine tumor include PC-PG rare disease . This study design choose see whether ONC201 associate reduction anti-hypertension medication , safety significant efficacy neuroendocrine tumor , especially PC-PG . The recommended phase II dose flat every 3 week dose 625mg orally every 3 week use . The imaging study entry use subsequent time point ( CT MRI week 6 3 , 6 , 9 , 12 month ; PET-CT PET-MRI 6 week 3 month 12 month . Imaging modality choice influence quality prior scan subject ordered clinical comparison possible .</detailed_description>
