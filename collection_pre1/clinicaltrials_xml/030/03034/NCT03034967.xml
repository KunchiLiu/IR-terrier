	<brief_summary>Danirixin ( DNX ) selective CXC chemokine receptor ( CXCR2 ) antagonist develop potential anti-inflammatory agent treatment COPD . This Phase 2 , randomize , double-blind ( Sponsor Open ) study . The primary objective study evaluate clinical activity safety danirixin compare placebo participant COPD . Following baseline assessment collect 7 day period participant randomize ( 1:1:1:1:1:1 ) receive one five dose strength danirixin ( 5 milligram [ mg ] , 10 mg , 25 mg , 35 mg 50 mg ) placebo . Study treatment administer orally twice daily 24 week . Participants continue standard care inhale medication ( i.e . long acting bronchodilator without inhaled corticosteroid ) receive study treatment . Follow continue 28 day post last dose . Approximately 700 participant screen target 540 participant complete 24 week treatment key study assessment .</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Inclusion Criteria Participants must age 40 80 year age inclusive , time signing informed consent . Participants COPD ( post bronchodilator FEV1/FVC ratio &lt; 0.7 FEV1 % predict &gt; =40 % ) base American Thoracic Society ( ATS ) /European Respiratory Society ( ERS ) current guideline . Participants historical diagnosis asthma may include long current diagnosis COPD . History respiratory symptom include chronic cough , mucus hypersecretion , dyspnea day least previous 3 month prior screen . Participants document history COPD exacerbation ( ) 12 month prior study participation ( screen ) meeting least one follow criterion : &gt; =2 COPD exacerbation result prescription antibiotic and/or oral corticosteroid hospitalization extend observation hospital emergency room outpatient center ; 1 COPD exacerbation result prescription antibiotic and/or oral corticosteroid hospitalization extend observation hospital emergency room outpatient center plasma fibrinogen concentration screen &gt; =3 grams/liter ( 300 milligram/deciliter ) Current former smoker cigarette smoke history &gt; =10 pack year ( 1 pack year = 20 cigarette smoke per day 1 year equivalent ) . Current smoker define currently smoke cigarette ( i.e . smoke least one cigarette daily day month prior Visit 1 ) . Former smoker define stop smoke least 6 month prior Visit 1 . Participants must ability willingness use electronic diary ( log pad ) daily basis . Body weight &gt; =45 kilogram ( kg ) Male female : A male participant must agree use contraception treatment period least 60 hour last dose study treatment , correspond approximately 6 halflives ( time need eliminate teratogenic study treatment ) refrain donate sperm period ; A female participant eligible participate pregnant , breastfeeding , least one follow condition applies : Not woman childbearing potential ( WOCBP ) OR A WOCBP agree follow contraceptive guidance treatment period least 60 hour last dose study treatment . Capable give sign informed consent . Exclusion Criteria Diagnosis clinically relevant lung disease ( COPD ) , e.g . sarcoidosis , tuberculosis , pulmonary fibrosis , severe bronchiectasis lung cancer . Alpha1antitrypsin deficiency underlie cause COPD Pulse oximetry &lt; 88 % rest screening . Participants test breathe room air . However , participant live high altitude ( 5000 foot 1500 meter sea level ) receive supplemental oxygen include provide receive equivalent &lt; 4 liter per minute ( L/min ) screen pulse oximetry measure usual oxygen setting . Less 14 day elapse completion course antibiotic oral corticosteroid recent COPD exacerbation . A peripheral blood neutrophil count &lt; 1.5 x 10^9/L . Diagnosis pneumonia ( chest Xray CT confirm ) within 3 month prior screen . Chest xray ( posterioranterior lateral ) CT scan reveals evidence clinically significant abnormality believe due presence COPD ( historic result 1 year prior screening may use ) . For site Germany : If chest xray ( CT scan ) within 1 year prior screen available , approval conduct diagnostic chest xray need obtain Federal Office Radiation Protection ( BfS ) . History current evidence clinically significant medical condition uncontrolled permitted therapy . Significant define disease , opinion Investigator , would put safety participant risk study participation , would affect safety analysis analysis disease/condition worsen study . Current chronic history liver disease , know hepatic biliary abnormality ( exception Gilbert 's syndrome asymptomatic gallstone ) . Abnormal clinically significant 12lead ECG finding . The investigator determine clinical significance abnormal ECG find relation participant 's medical history exclude participant would undue risk participate study . An abnormal clinically significant finding would preclude participant enter study define 12lead tracing interpret , limited , follow : atrial fibrillation rapid ventricular rate &gt; 120 beat per minute ( bpm ) ; sustain nonsustained ventricular tachycardia ; second degree heart block Mobitz type II third degree heart block ( unless pacemaker defibrillator implant ) ; Corrected QT Interval use Fridericia formula ( QTcF ) &gt; =500 millisecond ( msec ) participant QRS &lt; 120 msec QTcF &gt; =530 msec participant QRS &gt; =120 msec . Previous lung surgery ( e.g . lobectomy , pneumonectomy ) lung volume reduction procedure . Current expect chronic use macrolide antibiotic study period prevention COPD exacerbation . Examples chronic use include , limited , daily two three time per week use least 3 month . Oral injectable CYP3A4 breast cancer resistance protein ( BRCP ) substrates narrow therapeutic index ( CYP3A4 substrates include , limited , alfenatil , cyclosporine , dihydroergotamine , ergotamine , fentanyl , pimozide , quinidine , sirolimus , tacrolimus , theophylline ; BRCP substrates include , limited , topotecan . ) The Investigator consult Medical Monitor necessary . Current expect use phosphodiesterase4 inhibitor ( e.g . roflumilast ) . Participants currently receive roflumilast may include able discontinue use 30 day prior screen completion follow visit . Participation previous clinical trial receive investigational product within following time period prior first dose day current study : 30 day , 5 half life , twice duration biological effect investigational product ( whichever longer ) . Participation previous clinical trial danirixin within 1 year prior first dose day current study Exposure four investigational product within 1 year prior first dose day current study . Alanine transferase ( ALT ) &gt; 2x upper limit normal ( ULN ) ; bilirubin &gt; 1.5xULN ( isolated bilirubin &gt; 1.5xULN acceptable bilirubin fractionate direct bilirubin &lt; 35 % ) . A positive test human immunodeficiency virus ( HIV ) antibody A positive prestudy hepatitis B surface antigen positive hepatitis C antibody result within 3 month prior screen . Pulmonary rehabilitation : Participants take part acute phase pulmonary rehabilitation program within 4 week prior screen participant plan enter acute phase pulmonary rehabilitation program study . Participants maintenance phase pulmonary rehabilitation program exclude . A history allergy hypersensitivity ingredient study treatment .
