	<detailed_description>Background : Difficult-to-treat hypertension characterize uncontrolled blood pressure despite 2 antihypertensive drug . In many case , abnormal renal Na volume handle plays central pathogenetic role . Arterial vasoconstriction renal function regulate renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system ( RAAS ) effector hormone angiotensin II aldosterone . Both control renal tubular function Na excretion specific cellular receptor . Blocking renin-angiotensin-system pharmacologically therefore standard approach treat hypertension . However , great clinical need improve classification hypertensive patient predict patient sensitivity different therapeutic strategy precisely new specific biomarkers . Ang fragment generate non-canonical enzymatic pathway Ang III co-exist Ang I Ang II plasma . Their profile could help reclassify hypertensive patient , example differentiate salt RAAS-related mechanism great predictive power plasma renin aldosterone alone . Furthermore , urinary exosomes small membrane vesicle ( &lt; 0.1 μm ) shed urine tubular epithelial cell . They contain tubular Na channel know target furosemide thiazide drug use treat volume overload hypertension increase tubular sodium excretion . Cellular Na channel concentration tubule regulate Ang II aldosterone . Urinary exosomal Na channel abundance may therefore provide valuable information tubular function otherwise rendered standard laboratory test . These biomarkers could improve classification patient difficult-to-control hypertension inform treatment decision . As prerequisite design future validation study , however , concentration interindividual variability still know patient group . Study aim : This study aim determine concentration interindividual variability urinary exosomal sodium channel plasma angiotensin ( candidate biomarkers ) patient difficult-to-treat arterial hypertension determine dependency sample condition , dietary salt intake , plasma renin aldosterone concentration . Candidate biomarker definition : - Plasma Ang peptide plan determination study Ang I II metabolites Ang 2-10 , 2-8 , 3-8 , 1-7 , 2-7 , 3-7 , 1-5 ( Ang peptide profile ) . - Urinary exosomal Na channel protein plan determination study Na+-Cl− cotransporter ( NCC ) , epithelial sodium channel subunits alpha , beta , gamma ( ENaC ) Na-K-Cl cotransporter type 2 ( NKCC 2 ) . Study type : This investigator initiate , monocentric observational pilot study 24 ambulatory patient difficult-to-treat hypertension meet inclusion criterion none exclusion criterion . Setting : The study perform outpatient hypertension clinic University clinic nephrology , hypertension clinical pharmacology , Inselspital , Bern University Hospital , Bern , Switzerland . Objectives : - The primary objective study determine concentration interindividual variability urinary exosomal Na channel plasma angiotensin peptide standardize clinical sampling condition patient difficult-to-treat hypertension . - The secondary objective study 1. determine association candidate biomarkers urinary Na excretion , plasma renin aldosterone concentration , aldosterone-to-renin ratio clinical visit 2 , 2. ass repeatability biomarker determination spontaneous ( visit 1 ) compare standardized clinical sampling condition ( visit 2 ) . Study plan procedure : The concentration candidate biomarkers determine blood spot urinary sample obtain first clinical visit ( visit 1 ) standardize laboratory condition second clinical visit ( visit 2 ) stop RAAS inhibitory drug , diuretic interfere drug appropriate period 5-31 day . Determinations candidate biomarkers make parallel clinical blood urine test perform routinely two visit . The routine laboratory determination visit 2 include supine stand plasma renin aldosterone measurement morning 1 h rest 1 hour walking . Furthermore , 24h urinary Na K excretion determine . Biological sample process accord standardized laboratory protocol . Plasma Ang peptide determine gas chromatography-mass spectrometry . Urinary exosomal protein determine Western-Blot use specific antibody . Clinical data routine laboratory result visit 1 2 obtained clinical patient file . Recruitment participant : Consecutive ongoing participant recruitment perform daily clinic practice investigator check referral potential eligibility . Duration individual study participation : Individual study participation begin study inclusion visit 1 end completion visit 2 .</detailed_description>
