	<brief_title>Self-reported Usage Patterns Opioid Analgesic Medications After Surgery</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Hypothesis : Prescription medication analgesia surgery frequently occur empiric rather individualized basis . The investigator hypothesize prescribe opioid medication analgesia discharge hospital / surgery center frequently take . Aims : ) The descriptive first aim study define self-reported usage pattern opioid analgesic medication home follow surgery . ii ) The descriptive second aim study define prevail mode storage and/or disposal opioid medication prescribe patient hospital discharge follow surgery . iii ) The analytical second aim study characterize patient take significant amount prescribe opioid medication . Background &amp; Exploratory Objective ( ) : Accidents ( unintentional injury ) 5th lead cause death among general population United States 2010 . Among person 1-44 year age accident represent lead cause death . And , within group , pharmaceutical # 1 course death . Of 22,134 medication associate deaths 2010 , 75.2 % include opioid analgesic . The trajectory development alarming : Deaths prescription opioid overdose triple recent year . Of special concern child especially vulnerable unintentional medication overdosing , account 71,224 annual emergency room visit reason 2004-2005 alone . In addition individual burden morbidity mortality , cost prescription opioid abuse society immense : The average health care cost patient abuse opioids 8 time high non-abusers . In United States alone , $ 55.7 billion spent sequela workplace healthcare cost . Accordingly , prescription drug overdosing coin `` An American Epidemic '' increase resource tackle rapidly grow public health problem make available national ( National Institutes Health , U.S. Food Drug Administration ) state level part Colorado Consortium Prescription Drug Abuse create Governor Hickenlooper 's effort National Governors Association . Additionally , prescription opioids follow surgery usually occur use `` one size fit approach '' , lead potentially many unused opioids likely utilized fashion unintended prescribe clinician . The goal propose study assess self-reported intake relative prescribed amount analgesic medication surgery . Better knowledge relationship permit design tool individualize analgesic pharmacotherapy hospital discharge . The goal reduce amount opioid prescription need improve non-opioid analgesia . These data inform future study design patient-centered opioid prescribing tool , base anticipated need . This likely decrease amount prescribed opioids available non-medical use . Future study aim standardize use provide improve analgesia upon discharge follow surgery .</detailed_description>
