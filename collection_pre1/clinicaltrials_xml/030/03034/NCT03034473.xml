	<brief_summary>The objective TransValid-KFO179/GRCSG-Trial-A validation potential biomarkers . These predictive ( Prediction probability response certain therapy ) / prognostic ( predict long-term outcome ) microarray-based gene expression signatures immunohistochemically evaluated biomarkers . The evaluation do within KFO179 ( www.kfo179.de ) - validation implement trial . Therefore tumor material patient undergoing standard radiochemotherapy analyze pretreatment biopsy residual tissue resection specimen surgery . This validation biomaterial asservation incorporate clinical routine participate center model treatment solid tumor . The obtained biomarkers predictive prognostic power use develop algorithm predict patient high risk local distant cancer recurrence .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The objective TransValid-KFO179/GRCSG-Trial-A validate predictive/prognostic microarray-based gene expression signatures single gene biomarkers ( include 5-Fluorouracil ( FU ) metabolism , apoptosis , Kirsten Rat Sarcoma ( KRAS ) , CpGCpG island methylation phenotype ( CIMP ) TGF-beta pathway ) , establish patient treated standard 5-FU base RCT GRCSG trial ( e.g . CAO/ARO/AIO-94- , CAO/ARO/AIO-04-phase III trial ) . This validation incorporate clinical routine participate center model treatment solid tumor . If KFO179 biomarkers predictive satisfactory level validation set , propose prediction algorithm stratify patient population `` high '' -risk `` low '' -risk population develop local distant cancer recurrence .</detailed_description>
