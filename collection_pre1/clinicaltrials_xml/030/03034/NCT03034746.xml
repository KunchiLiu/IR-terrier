	<brief_summary>Emerging literature suggest vascular factor might involve pathogenesis Alzheimer 's disease ( AD ) . Other recent study demonstrate positive effect physical activity cognitive behavioral disturbance patient AD . Therefore , postulate exercise enchantment cerebral circulation physiological mechanism link physical exercise reduction AD symptom . Consequently , program physical activity could consider one approach counteract dementia improve cerebrovascular health . However moment , clear progressive brain vascular dysfunction hypoperfusion , associate β-amyloid deposition , might reverse stabilized exercise intervention . The aim study ass , patient AD , influence physical exercise , compare cognitive stimulation , : - Cognitive function ; - Independence daily live behavioral symptom ; - Vascular function Finally , investigate physiological process basis motor parameter ' change , performance patient compare performance healthy young old subject . MAIN OBJECTIVE : Investigate , patient Mild Cognitive Impairment ( MCI ) AD , effect physical activity program , cognitive stimulation global cognitive function . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : Investigate effect two treatment : - cognitive motor performance , - independence activity daily live , - behavioral symptom , - peripheral vascular function .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>STUDY DESIGN : Randomised control , blind clinical trial . SUBJECTS : The study include 120 patient definite diagnosis MCI AD 30 young healthy subject 30 old healthy subject refer Research Unit associate Department . Patients regard suitable participate fulfil follow criterion : - Mini Mental State Examination ( MMSE ) ≥ 8 ; - Performance Oriented Mobility Assessment ≥ 19 ( POMA ) . Exclusion criterion : - presence concurrent neurological disease ; - presence orthopaedic disease involve low limb and/or interfere stand position and/or walking ; - presence severe auditory visual deficit correct ; - abuse alcohol drug ; - psychiatric disorder , - severe behavioral disorder ; - hearth respiratory disease interfere motor activity . The protocol approve local ethic committee number 2389 . All participant perform physiatric examination medical doctor Department Neurological Movement Sciences . Written inform consent obtain participant inclusion study . Participants meet inclusion criterion conduct clinical instrumental evaluation enrollment ( T0 ) 6 month ± 15 day first visit ( T1 ) . The assessment procedure also repeat 3 month ( T2 ) T1 . ASSESSMENT PROCEDURES Primary endpoint : - score obtain Mini Mental State Examination . Secondary endpoint : - score obtain cognitive battery . For MCI patient use : - Trial Making Test ( Reitan,1958 ) , - Rivermead Behavioral Memory Test ( Wilson , 1989 ) , - Tower London ( Shallice , 1982 ) , - Dual Task ( Della Sala et al. , 1997 ) , - Frontal Assessment Battery ( Iavarone A et al. , 2004 ) . For AD patient use : - Attention Matrix ( Spinnler et al. , 1987 ) , - Alzheimer 's Disease Assessment Scale ( Rosen WG et al. , 1984 ) , - Frontal Assessment Battery ( Iavarone A et al. , 2004 ) . - score obtain motor skill assessment compose : - 6-Minute Walking Test ( Ries JD et al. , 2009 ) , - gait analysis GAITRite® System ( Bilney B et al. , 2003 ) , - stabilometric assessment Stability Line ( Nashner LM Peters JF , 1990 ) , - score obtained test Instrumental Activity Daily Living ( Lawton MP Brody EM , 1969 ) , - score obtained test Neuropsychiatric Inventory ( Cummings JL et al. , 1994 ) , - peripheral vascular function measure doppler . To evaluate effectiveness motor treatment , compare cognitive treatment motor skill , cognitive skill , behavioral autonomy patient cognitive decline , patient evaluate motor , cognitive , behavioral autonomy scale , baseline , 6 month ( T1 ) , others 3 month ( T2 ) . A subgroup 50 % patient undergo instrumental procedure investigate effect treatment cerebral blood flow ( arterial spin label ) . TREATMENT PROCEDURES The participant recruit randomly assign , accord degree cognitive decline , one 3 group ( 7-8 subject ) : - Physical Activity group ( PA group ) : It perform program consist 15 min warm-up , 60 min aerobic resistance training , 15 min cool-down . - Cognitive treatment group ( CT group ) : The cognitive stimulation group receive rehabilitation program multimodal repetitive stimulation order exercise reinforce cognitive skill participant slow/prevent decline . In particular treatment focus reorient patient his/her-self , his/her history his/her environment , improve memory skill teach compensatory restitutive strategy , help patient discussion everyday life particular everyday problem The PA CT group homogeneous clinical demographic data , participant undergo 72 treatment group session , 60-minute/session , 3 days/week 6 consecutively month . Both type treatment balance different degree difficulty depend state disease severity . The control group ( CG ) receive treatment study evaluate clinical instrumental assessment .</detailed_description>
