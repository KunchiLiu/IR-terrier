	<brief_summary>Coronary artery disease ( CAD ) associate high mortality worldwide . Narrowing coronary artery cause acute myocardial infarction . Patient cardiac ischemia often treat percutaneous coronary intervention ( PCI ) coronary artery bypass grafting ( CABG ) . Following hospitalisation , patient offer attend classical rehabilitation program moderate exercise intensity . Current exercise program cardiac rehabilitation proven reduce cardiovascular risk factor 1 . Is possible improve exercise capacity risk profile even exercise program include vigorous training ? The program start one week cardiac incident ( AMI , PCI CABG ) take 12 week complete . Patients heart failure valvular disease exclude . First ventilatory threshold ( VT1 ) second ventilatory threshold ( VT2 ) determine cycloerometry . VT2 reflect aerobic-anaerobic transition therefore aerobic functional capacity2 . Exercise load reach VT2 use determine training load rehabilitation . The research goal investigate influence training intensity exercise capacity risk profile CAD patient .</brief_summary>
