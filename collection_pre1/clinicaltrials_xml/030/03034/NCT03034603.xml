	<brief_title>The Safety Efficacy Test Nutri-PEITC Jelly Head Neck Cancer Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Previously , Nutri-jelly , novel edible nutritious gel patient chew swallow difficulty , show effective improving quality life head neck cancer patient . Recently , Nutri-PEITC jelly recently develop addition Phenethyl Isothiocyanate ( PEITC ) , phytochemical compound chemopreventive action animal bear oral cancer . It intend functional food cancer survivor . The dose PEITC Nutri-jelly base safe effective dose determine animal study . Furthermore , Nutri-PEITC jelly proven safe healthy volunteer daily consumes consecutive month serious adverse event . The purpose study determine safety efficacy Nutri-jelly PEITC head neck cancer patient . independent variable : continuous Nutri -jelly PEITC intake dependent variable ( outcome ) : adverse effect , health-related quality life score , tumor response functional status</detailed_description>
