	<brief_title>Gentrix™ Versus Biological Prosthetic Mesh</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Biological prosthetic mesh product extensively use hernia repair . However , also limitation . Potential complication associate prosthetic mesh hernia repair include : adverse reaction mesh , mesh erosion , stricture formation , adhesion result bowel obstruction , enterocutaneous fistula , injury nearby organ , nerve blood vessel , infection , chronic pain hernia recurrence . Potential complication associate biological mesh include : adverse inflammatory response , laxity , eventration , recurrent herniation . This study two-arm , randomize , control trial compare separation component repair retrorectus Gentrix™ Surgical Matrix versus biological prosthetic mesh open ventral hernia repair .</detailed_description>
