	<brief_summary>We aim test efficacy new method determine individual insulin sensitivity ( IS ) base sensor-augmented-insulin pump ( SAP ) data order customize insulin carbohydrate ratio ( CR ) adolescents type 1 diabetes ( T1D ) . To date , individual insulin sensitivity ( IS ) could investigate intensive invasive research technique feasible perform outpatient set pediatric patient diabetes . Recently publish study demonstrate efficacy algorithm calculate patient specific insulin sensitivity customize CR adult patient T1D . The algorithm validate adult patient , however yet investigate pediatric population T1D . The aim study : 1. customize CR pediatric subject T1D use individualized insulin sensitivity index ( ISind ) improve post-prandial blood glucose control standard meal . 2. test , free living condition ( home ) , efficacy customize CR improve post-prandial glycemic control pediatric subject T1D . This approach would least two potential benefit pediatric patient T1D : 1 . To provide non-invasive tool individualize home insulin therapy ; 2 . To offer reliable instrument adjust meal bolus current hybrid close loop ( HCL ) system account inter-subject variability insulin action .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A New Wizard Insulin Sensitivity Estimation From SAP : Randomized Controlled Trial Adolescents With T1D</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>A new method ass insulin sensitivity ( IS ) propose investigated PI group University Padova . The new insulin sensitivity index , name `` SISP '' calculate data derive insulin pump continuous glucose monitoring ( CGM ) upload . The efficiency SISP test in-silico use University Virginia/Padova T1D simulator mimic single-meal scenario patient-specific optimized carbohydrate ratio ( CR ) ( increase decrease 20 % ) optimal CR . In simulation use optimal CR , calculate propose method , improve overall glycemic control . The simulator ( S2013 ) use purpose valdated approve FDA substitute preclinical trial insulin treatment , include closed-loop algorithm . It comprise data 100 in-silico patient represent biological variability generic real diabetic population . Thus , algorithm tune basis in-silico analysis safely implement real-life setting . The method estimate SISP optimize CR SAP data , could easily apply daily management patient T1D closed-loop context since several closed-loop algorithm , currently use clinical trial , base pre-programmed open-loop insulin therapy . Once individualized SISP calculate , use customize CR use in-silico test algorithm determine individualize CR ( CRIND ) . Consequently , CRIND test outpatient set safely , adjust run-to-run framework , use well describe approach self-learning , latter allow titration insulin therapy base CGM data use self-learning algorithm previously describe . - Phase 1 : `` Control period '' . This phase represent control frame-time , patient , enrol , use SAP without adjustment CR correction factor , accord parameter record screen visit . This phase aim record CGM data represent control period study . It last 3 week . - Phase 2 : `` Build-up period '' This phase aim obtain adequate amount data customize insulin pump parameter specific feature subject accord propose algorithm . It consist three standardized meal ( Figure 2 ) run-in phase . Subjects randomly assign two different pre-meal insulin CR group 1:1 ratio determine parameter use adjust IS algorithm pediatric patient T1D . The post-prandial blood glucose pattern pre-meal bolus CR , CR 20 % increase , CR 20 % decrease validated parameter necessary customize algorithm specific patient population T1D , therefore subject challenge two different CRs , depend randomization , collect sufficient data fine tune algorithm . Each subject go three meal study ; Group 1 . Meal 1 : CR 20 % increase ; Meal 2 : CR home ; Meal 3 : CR individualize Group 2 . Meal 1 : CR 20 % decrease ; Meal 2 : CR home ; Meal 3 : CR individualize - Before 1st meal subject randomly assign receive modify premeal bolus ( increase decrease 20 % , CR+/-20 % ) 1:1 ratio . This change home CR ( CRHOME ) allow u estimate accuracy error CRHOME calculate , accord describe algorithm ( ( 21 ) ) , optimize CR ( CRIND ) . This latter test group third meal home . - The three meal follow 7 day- run-in period necessary collect minimum amount CGM data run algorithm calculation use intervention phase . During period subject adopt CRIND obtained standard meal . - Phase 3 : `` Intervention period '' . This phase aim test efficacy CRIND mitigate post-prandial hyperglycemia home-based study , use periodical adjustment CR basal rate accord `` run-to-run '' approach . It consist self-learning algorithm method adjust insulin regimen ( basal rate CRIND ) base CGM post-meal blood glucose pattern pre-meal insulin bolus . Subjects use SAP tune accord individualized ISR2R CRR2R obtain run-in period , along individualized insulin basal rate ( BasalR2R ) . During run-to-run period subject receive weekly revise parameter base run-to-run algorithm accord data analysis past seven day . It last 3 week .</detailed_description>
