	<brief_title>A Phase I Clinical Study Evaluating Safety Efficacy MASCT-I Patients With Advanced Solid Tumors</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The multiple-antigen specific cell therapy develop Hengrui Yuanzheng optimize continuously upgraded first-generation MASCT technology MASCT-I . MASCT-I add PD1 antibody vitro cell culture process MASCT technology block PD1 receptor immunocytes , relieve brake immunocytes ' reinfusion interaction tumor cell enhance effectiveness immunocytes kill tumor cell . At present , development validation manufacturing process complete , urgently need conduct validation clinical effect . This study primarily assess safety anti-tumor effect MASCT-I technology provide basis II/III phase clinical trial . This single-center , phase I clinical study evaluate safety efficacy MASCT-I technology patient advance solid tumor preliminarily assess antitumor effectiveness MASCT-I alone combination chemotherapy drug . About 33-36 case adult patient advance solid tumor ( limited bladder cancer soft tissue sarcoma ) recruit . This study divide two stage : Stage I small sample safety observation stage `` 3+3 '' design include group A B . Group A represent group MASCT-I alone patient advance solid tumor various standard therapy fail clinical practice include ; Group B represent combination group MASCT-I plus chemotherapy drug group MASCT-I alone patient recurrent metastatic advance solid tumor achieve clinical benefit chemotherapy ( CR , PR , SD ) include . Stage II dose expansion stage observe safety anti-tumor effectiveness . The patient enrol stage II group B subject .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Major write inform consent Life expectancy≥ 6 month Scored 0 1 ECOG Results blood test biochemistry baseline meeting follow criterion : Hemoglobin≥85g/L , Leucocyte≥3.0×109/L , Absolute neutrophil count（ANC）≥1.5×109/L，Trombocyte≥70×109/L , ALT/AST ≤ 2.5×ULN ≤ 5×ULN patient hepatic metastasis , ALP≤2.5 time upper limit normal , Serum total bilirubin &lt; 1.5×ULN , Serum urea nitrogen creatinine ≤ 1.5×ULN , Serum albumin ≥30g/L The following criterion also meet patient Group A ; 1 . Patients suffer advanced ( unresectable ) recurrent solid tumor ( limited bladder cancer soft tissue sarcoma ) confirm histology cytology treat unsuccessfully various standard therapy . 2 . According RECIST1.1 criterion , must one measurable focus ; 3 . Time interval end antitumor measure study treatment least 1 month ; Patients enrol group B also meet following criterion : 1 . Bladder cancer : confirm histology cytology , advance recurrent metastatic . GP chemotherapy could realize clinical benefit . 2 . Soft tissue sarcoma : confirm histology cytology , advance recurrent metastatic.Clinical benefit could achieve MAID CAV/IE firstline chemotherapy predominant Doxorubicin . Note : Clinical benefit refer patient reach complete remission ( CR ) , partial remission ( PR ) stable disease ( SD ) treatment . Major Participation plan implementation study ( include employee HRYZ staff study center ) ; Enrollment another clinical study time , unless observational ( noninterventional ) clinical study ; Possibility receive systemic antitumor treatment study ; Being pregnant planning become pregnant ; Refusal provide blood sample ; Known allergy sodium citrate ; A medical history allogenic organ transplantation ( include bone marrow transplantation peripheral stem cell transplantation , exclude corneal transplantation ) ; Subjects present clinical symptom central nervous system metastasis ( encephaledema , need hormone intervention brain metastasis progression ) ; Subjects use immunosuppressant , systemic , absorbable local steroid therapy purpose immunosuppression ; Subjects previously receive MASCT cellular immunotherapy ; Active tuberculosis ; Any major operation ( defined investigator ) within 28 day administration first investigational treatment ; Active infection , include hepatitis B , hepatitis C human immunodeficiency virus ( HIV ) infection ; Presence peripheral nervous system disorder , history apparent metal disorder central nervous system disorder ; Severe hepatic ( e.g. , liver cirrhosis , etc . ) , renal , respiratory disease , noncommunicable disease uncontrolled diabetes , hypertension , etc . ; Other malignant tumor within last five year , exclude nonmelanoma skin cancer carcinoma situ .</criteria>
