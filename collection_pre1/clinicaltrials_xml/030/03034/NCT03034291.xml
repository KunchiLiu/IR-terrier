	<detailed_description>RATIONALE Metabolic syndrome ( MS ) clinical entity associate obesity , insulin resistance ( IR ) , hypertension , hypertriglyceridemia low HDL . This syndrome promote pathophysiological mechanism oxidative stress damage , endothelial inflammation , hypercoagulability , atheromatosis metabolic dysfunction . In Colombia , morbidity mortality chronic disease related MS , arterial hypertension type II diabetes mellitus ( DM2 ) represent high cost health system due direct attention diseases well frequent complication : acute myocardial infarction , cerebrovascular disease , peripheral neuropathy , retinopathy renal failure . In addition social cost due incapacity work , loss year useful life reduction quality life patient family . IR biologically precede development DM2 author propose one initial manifestation MS . It estimate 25 % individual IR develop DM2 within 3 5 year 50 % retain IR status . In global context , estimate 2010 approximately 344 million people age 20 79 , 7.9 % population , estimate reach 472 million 2030 , , 8.4 million adult population aggravation majority locate middle low income country . Despite relevance IR pathophysiology DM2 , since previous stage , public health policy aim conduct active search case event diagnosis make , alternative reverse prevent progression diabetes . Control IR demand intervention people 's lifestyle increase physical activity , reduce body weight change eat pattern , however , despite effectiveness measure , real impact low since involves drastic modification habit consumer life characterize modern Western society . Grassi et al demonstrate short-term ( 15-day ) clinical study consumption black chocolate , oppose white chocolate , reduces blood glucose modulates mean arterial flow hypertensive patient IR . A parallel , double-blind , prospective , double-blind , placebo-controlled clinical trial evaluate effect consumption 50 g chocolate 70 % cocoa solid provide least 430 mg Polyphenols 8 week reduction IR increase arterial reactivity non-diabetic individual central obesity IR . Likewise , expect infer effect food intervention modification total cardiometabolic risk participant . This research seek corroborate study group , visualize effect cocoa longer period time , sample Colombian population , characterize high degree mestizaje , effect may nuances different Reported European population . THEORETICAL FRAMEWORK The MS clinical entity define WHO 1998 , include several disorder predispose imbalance lipid metabolism . To establish diagnosis , three five condition must meet : 1 . Elevated serum triglyceride level ( great 150mg / dL ) , 2 . Low serum level high-density cholesterol ( HDL le 35 mg / dL men , less 39 mg / dL woman ) , 3 . Hypertension ( SBP great 140 mmHg / DBP great 90 mmHg ) treat antihypertensive drug . 4 . High glycemia level ( great 100mg / dL ) treat hypoglycemic drug . 5 . Obesity ( abdominal circumference great 90 cm men , great 80 cm woman / body mass index great 30 ) . The MS great impact morbidity mortality , evidence association increase cerebrovascular DM2 risk . Obesity Obesity risk factor development IR , DM2 MS , evaluation important total body fat also anatomical distribution adipose tissue , particular relevance visceral deposit contribution resistance insulin . Epidemiological evidence show increase cardiovascular risk DM2 individual MS ; addition , mortality non-cardiovascular cause increase 2.26-fold men 2.78-fold woman affect syndrome , regardless age , body mass index ( BMI ) , cholesterol level smoke . Studies related obesity chronic disease recommend use abdominal circumference indicator central obesity even people normal body mass index . Appropriate cutoff propose base study variability risk chronic disease adults ethnic group . For Colombia , WHO recommendations adopt , accord abdominal perimeter great 90 cm 80 cm woman compatible central obesity . Chocolate IR Several study indicate regular consumption fruit vegetable well red wine , tea chocolate may reduce risk cardiovascular disease due flavonoid present food . Cacao ( Theobroma cacao ) food originates Americas , contain 6 8 % polyphenols , include flavonoid monomeric form : catechin epicatechin , oligomeric form : procyanidins . There epidemiological evidence protective factor confer cocoa consumption Kuna indigenous community , development atherosclerotic disease , arterial hypertension type 2 diabetes mellitus . Grassi colleague demonstrate effect chocolate consumption increase sensitivity insulin hypertensive diabetic patient well normal individual . The mechanism involve process seem relate ability polyphenols increase bioavailability nitric oxide , reduce formation reactive specie oxide , also effect metabolism carbohydrates modulation pathway Signaling related insulin . IR define decreased sensitivity response metabolic action insulin . The concept IR first propose 1936 describe diabetic patient require high dos insulin . IR play important role pathophysiology DM2 strong association obesity , hypertension , coronary disease , dyslipidemia metabolic syndrome ; therefore , important tool quantify sensitivity resistance insulin human different aspect phenomenon study , epidemiology , pathophysiological mechanism , therapeutic outcome , natural history , among others . There different method measure insulin sensitivity / resistance , one direct ( hyperinsulinemic/euglycemic clamping ) rest calculate basal insulin glycaemia measurement . Up , clamp continue reference diagnostic method , indirect method QUICKI HOMA high correlation clamping , recently validation start epidemiological clinical study . Homeostasis Model Assesment ( HOMA ) Described since 1985 , model take account interaction glucose insulin predicts steady state glucose insulin concentration wide range possible combination IR beta cell function pancreas . HOMA assume feedback loop liver beta cell , mean insulin level depend pancreatic response beta cell glucose concentration . Therefore , deficient beta cell reflect decrease insulin stimulate glucose IR reflect decrease suppressive effect insulin hepatic production glucose . HOMA describe model insulin/glucose homeostasis series linear equation . The model predict , fast state , constant level glucose insulin give combination beta cell function insulin sensitivity . In practical term study use HOMA index measure IR mathematical formula express product fast glucose fasting insulin divide 22.5 constant normalization . Chocolate cardiometabolic risk The Kuna indigenous community live San Blas archipelago Panama low frequency cerebrocardiovascular disease DM2 . This epidemiological picture attribute habitual consumption large quantity cocoa-based beverage protective genetic factor . Cocoa food high content polyphenols one high concentration flavonoid , monomeric form catechin epicatequin oligomers procyanidins . Flavonoids general cocoa particular ability lower blood pressure , increase arterial blood flow , reduce oxidation low-density lipoprotein , reduce platelet aggregability , increase insulin sensitivity . It postulate action cacao involve several mechanism , include : 1 . Reduction inflammatory endothelial response involve genesis atheromatous plaque , reduce expression adhesion molecule necessary migration activation macrophages others Phagocytic cell source reactive oxygen specie well inflammatory cytokine necessary perpetuate endothelial injury . 2 . Antioxidant capacity protect low density lipoprotein peroxidation . 3 . Increased activity endothelial nitric oxide synthase responsible production nitric oxide necessary preserve reactivity arterial flow . 4 . Decrease platelet agreeability expense low expression adhesion molecule . And recently describe , increased insulin sensitivity . Principal objective To estimate change IR index ( HOMA-IR ) modification cardio metabolic risk non-diabetic individual IR control clinical trial , eight week chocolate consumption 70 % Cocoa solid . Secondary Objectives 1 . Buy effect chocolate consumption without cocoa solid 8 week basal post glucose load non-diabetic individual IR . 2 . Compare baseline insulinemia non-diabetic subject IR eight week consumption chocolate without cocoa solid . 3 . To evaluate effect consumption chocolate without cocoa solid modulation arterial flow non-diabetic people IR . 4 . To estimate effect chocolate consumption 70 % cocoa solid eight week modification cardio metabolic risk non-diabetic individual IR . 5 . Compare variation health-related quality life among people IR receive chocolate cocoa solid receive chocolate free cocoa solid end intervention .</detailed_description>
