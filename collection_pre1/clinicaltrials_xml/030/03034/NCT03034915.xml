	<brief_summary>COPD characterize airflow limitation , fully reversible , usually progressive accompany chronic cough , sputum production dyspnea , major cause disability anxiety associate disease . In addition , COPD associate poor health-related quality life ( HRQoL ) . Pharmacologic therapy use improve lung function , reduce symptom , reduce frequency severity exacerbation , also improve health status exercise tolerance . This multi-center , randomize , double blind , double dummy , 3-arm parallel group study compare umeclidinium/vilanterol ( 62.5/25 microgram [ mcg ] , daily ) , umeclidinium ( 62.5 mcg , daily ) , salmeterol ( 50 mg , twice daily ) male female subject COPD . The primary purpose study demonstrate improvement lung function subject treat UMEC/VI compare UMEC 24 week . Approximately 2424 subject randomize across 3 parallel arm 1:1:1 ratio . Subjects stratify base long-acting bronchodilator usage run-in period ( none , one 2 long-acting bronchodilator per day ) . Subjects receive either UMEC/VI inhalation powder ( 62.5/25 microgram [ mcg ] daily ) administer via ELLIPTA® dry powder inhaler ( DPI ) placebo twice daily via DISKUS® DPI ; UMEC ( 62.5 mcg daily ) administer via ELLIPTA DPI placebo twice daily via DISKUS DPI salmeterol ( 50 mcg twice daily [ BID ] ) administer via DISKUS DPI placebo daily via ELLIPTA DPI . The duration study 29 31 week include pre-screening period 2 week , run-in period 4 week , treatment period 24 week follow-up period 1 week .

A CAT score &gt; =10 Screening Visit 1 Current former cigarette smoker history cigarette smoke &gt; =10 packyears ( number pack year = [ number cigarette per day / 20 ] multiply number year smoke [ e.g. , 20 cigarette per day 10 year , 10 cigarette per day 20 year equal 10 packyears ] ) . Former smoker define stop smoke least 6 month prior Visit 1 . Pipe and/or cigar use use calculate packyear history . Male female subject eligible participate study . A female subject eligible participate pregnant ( confirm negative urine human chorionic gonadotrophin test ) , lactate , least one follow condition applies : nonreproductive potential define premenopausal female document tubal ligation document hysteroscopic tubal occlusion procedure followup confirmation bilateral tubal occlusion hysterectomy document bilateral oophorectomy . Postmenopausal define 12 month spontaneous amenorrhea . In questionable case , blood sample simultaneous follicle stimulate hormone estradiol level consistent menopause must test . Females hormone replacement therapy ( HRT ) whose menopausal status doubt require use one highly effective contraception method wish continue HRT study . Otherwise , must discontinue HRT allow confirmation postmenopausal status prior study enrolment . A female subject reproductive potential eligible participate pregnant agree follow one highly effective method avoid pregnancy female reproductive potential 30 day prior first dose study medication ( least five terminal halflives continue pharmacologic effect end , whichever long ) last dose study medication completion followup visit .
