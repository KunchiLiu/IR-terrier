	<brief_summary>This research study study immunotherapy without radiation therapy possible treatment adenoid cystic carcinoma . The immunotherapy involve study : - Pembrolizumab ( MK-3475 KEYTRUDA ) .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Pembrolizumab With Without Radiation Patients With Recurrent Metastatic Adenoid Cystic Carcinoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This research study Phase II clinical trial . Phase II clinical trial test safety effectiveness investigational agent learn whether work treat specific disease . `` Investigational '' mean drug study . Pembrolizumab ( MK-3475 KEYTRUDA ) humanize monoclonal antibody . An antibody common type protein make body response foreign substance ( particle typically find body bacteria virus ) . Antibodies attack foreign substance protect infection . Antibodies also produce laboratory use treat patient . Pembrolizumab design restore natural ability immune system recognize target cancer cell . The FDA recently grant approval pembrolizumab treatment patient recurrent metastatic head neck squamous cell carcinoma . Pembrolizumab approve treatment adenoid cystic carcinoma . This study test whether pembrolizumab without radiation useful patient adenoid cystic carcinoma . Radiation therapy may use treat ACC tumor spread part body recur surgery . Radiation therapy may affect immune system improve efficacy pembrolizumab</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Participants must histologically confirm adenoid cystic carcinoma evidence recurrent metastatic disease amenable potentially curative surgery radiotherapy . Participants must least two RECIST v1.1 measurable nonCNS base lesion . Palliative radiation must indicate least one lesion , lesion must candidate radiation dose 30 Gy radiation 5 fraction deem treat radiation oncologist . Documentation volume prescription isodose line collect . Reirradiation previously treat lesion allow . One lesion must location incorporate radiation field systemic response assess . However , inclusion patient 10 measurable lesion strongly discourage patient must life expectancy &gt; 6 month . Participants must agree undergo research biopsy , tumor safely accessible , baseline 2 cycle pembrolizumab . Participants exempt archival tumor tissue collect within 12 month study enrollment Principal Investigator deem appropriate/sufficient analysis protocol . Biopsy lesion outside potential radiation treatment field prefer maintain consistency across cohort . Participants must archival tissue primary tumor metastasis available correlative study . Either paraffin block twenty unstained slide acceptable . If twenty slide available , less amount may acceptable discussion Principal Investigator . Prior systemic therapy : At least 2 week must elapse since end prior chemotherapy , biological agent ( 4 week anticancer monoclonal antibody contain regimen ) investigational drug product , adequate recovery treatmentrelated toxicity NCI CTCAE Version 4.0 grade ≤1 ( tolerable grade 2 ) back baseline ( except alopecia neuropathy ) . Any number prior therapy recurrent/metastatic ACC allow , exception previous treatment PD1 pathway inhibitor . Prior radiation therapy : At least 3 week must elapse prior radiation therapy . The prior site radiotherapy must document reirradiation site allow protocol . Be ≥ 18 year age day sign informed consent . Have performance status 0 1 ECOG Performance Scale ( see Appendix A ) . Participants must documentation new progressive lesion radiologic image study perform within 12 month prior study enrollment ( progression disease interval allow ) and/or new/worsening disease relate symptom within 12 month prior study enrollment . This assessment perform treat investigator . Evidence progression RECIST criterion require . Demonstrate adequate organ function define Table 1 , screen lab perform within 10 day treatment initiation . Table 1 Adequate Organ Function Laboratory Values System Laboratory Value Hematological Absolute neutrophil count ( ANC ) ≥1,500 /mcL Platelets ≥100,000 / mcL Hemoglobin ≥9 g/dL ≥5.6 mmol/L without transfusion EPO dependency ( within 7 day assessment ) Renal Serum creatinine OR Measured calculate creatinine clearance ( GFR also use place creatinine CrCl ) ≤1.5 X upper limit normal ( ULN ) OR ≥60 mL/min subject creatinine level &gt; 1.5 X institutional ULN Hepatic Serum total bilirubin ≤ 1.5 X ULN OR Direct bilirubin ≤ ULN subject total bilirubin level &gt; 1.5 ULN AST ( SGOT ) ALT ( SGPT ) ≤ 2.5 X ULN OR ≤ 5 X ULN subject liver metastasis Albumin &gt; 2.5 mg/dL Coagulation International Normalized Ratio ( INR ) Prothrombin Time ( PT ) Activated Partial Thromboplastin Time ( aPTT ) ≤1.5 X ULN unless subject receive anticoagulant therapy long PT PTT within therapeutic range intend use anticoagulant ≤1.5 X ULN unless subject receive anticoagulant therapy long PT PTT within therapeutic range intend use anticoagulant Creatinine clearance calculate per institutional standard . Baseline tumor measurement must document test within 28 day study entry . Other nonlaboratory test must perform within 28 day study entry . Female subject childbearing potential negative urine serum pregnancy within 7 day prior receive first dose study medication . If urine test positive confirm negative , serum pregnancy test require . Female male subject childbearing potential must agree use adequate method contraception , outline section 5.6 , prior study entry , duration study participation , 4 month completion pembrolizumab administration . Contraception require start first dose study medication 120 day last dose study medication . Note : Abstinence acceptable usual lifestyle prefer contraception subject . Be willing able provide write informed consent trial . Metastatic disease impinge spinal cord threaten spinal cord compression . Patients previous treatment disease impinge cord either surgery radiotherapy clinical radiographic evidence response stability eligible . Surgical fixation bone lesion irradiate require indicated provide mechanical stability . Participant know active central nervous system ( CNS ) metastases and/or carcinomatous meningitis . Subjects previously treat brain metastasis may participate provide stable ( without evidence progression image least four week prior first dose trial treatment ) , evidence new enlarge brain metastasis , use steroid purpose treat brain metastasis induce edema least 7 day prior trial treatment . This exception include carcinomatous meningitis exclude regardless clinical stability , poor prognosis often develop progressive neurologic dysfunction would confound evaluation neurologic adverse event . Prior treatment PD1 PDL1 inhibitor Concurrent administration cancer specific therapy investigational agent course study allow . Has diagnosis immunodeficiency receive systemic steroid therapy form immunosuppressive therapy within 7 day prior first dose trial treatment . Has know history active TB ( Bacillus Tuberculosis ) History allergic reaction hypersensitivity pembrolizumab excipients . Uncontrolled intercurrent illness include limited ongoing active infection , symptomatic congestive heart failure , unstable angina pectoris , cardiac arrhythmia , psychiatric illness/social situation would limit compliance study requirement . Has know additional malignancy progress require active treatment . Exceptions include basal cell carcinoma skin squamous cell carcinoma skin undergone potentially curative therapy situ cervical cancer . Has know history , evidence active , noninfectious pneumonitis . Has active infection require systemic therapy . Has active autoimmune disease require systemic treatment past 2 year ( i.e . use disease modify agent , corticosteroid immunosuppressive drug ) . Replacement therapy ( e.g. , thyroxine , insulin , physiologic corticosteroid replacement therapy adrenal pituitary insufficiency , etc . ) consider form systemic treatment . Has history current evidence condition , therapy , laboratory abnormality might confound result trial , interfere subject 's participation full duration trial , best interest subject participate , opinion treat investigator . Subjects pregnant breastfeeding , expect conceive father child within project duration trial , start prescreening screen visit 120 day last dose trial treatment . Pregnant woman exclude study immunotherapy potential teratogenic abortifacient effect . Because unknown potential risk adverse event nurse infant secondary treatment mother immunotherapy , breastfeed discontinue mother treat protocol . Women could potentially become pregnant undergoing treatment protocol must willing use 2 method contraception . Has know history Human Immunodeficiency Virus ( HIV ) ( HIV 1/2 antibody ) . Has know active Hepatitis B ( e.g. , HBsAg reactive ) Hepatitis C ( e.g. , HCV RNA [ qualitative ] detect ) . Has receive live vaccine within 30 day plan start study therapy .</criteria>
