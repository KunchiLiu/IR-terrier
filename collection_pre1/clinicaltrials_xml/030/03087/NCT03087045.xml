	<brief_summary>The purpose investigation investigate behavioral manifestation listen effort . Quantifying listen effort base easy measure behavioral metric would allow good understand effort go process conversational speech . The investigator hypothesize behavior modification require improve signal noise ratio increasingly complex listen environment significantly deviate quiet listen environment . Further , investigator hypothesize directly contributes increase listen effort reduce ability accurately monitor content everyday conversation .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Behavioral Manifestations Listening Effort</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Listening Effort describe reflection cognitive resource necessary speech understanding . Measures broadly classify Subjective , Physiological Behavioral measure Listening Effort ( LE ) . Subjective measure LE involve listener rating answer questionnaire present auditory stimulus . Some example Subjective measure multidimensional speech , spatial quality ( SSQ ) scale Listening effort rating scale . However , measure suffer individual bias , example , one person might find take effort , another might . Physiological measure establish relationship change central and/or autonomic nervous system activity LE . Effect LE central nervous system activity include method use Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging ( fMRI ) compare process noise vocoded versus clear sentence stimulus use Electroencephalography ( EEG ) monitor memory/cognitive load . Some method measure effect Autonomic Nervous system Pupillometry Skin Conductance . Research find fluctuate pupil size may indicator mental task load and/or attention , stress memory . Furthermore , Pupillometric method use correlate change measure like pupil size listen task . There drawbacks use pupillometry measure LE- Absolute pupil size change pupil size present speech change accord age listener . For instance , Older adult find small absolute pupil size show lesser change pupil size move difficult easier listening condition . These drawback account normalize pupil size . Behavioral measure take account decline cognitive function prolong mental effort use auditory dual task paradigm primary task word recognition secondary task memory recall Visual Response time . Apart Dual task , participant also ask assign subjective rating base SSQ . Findings reveal 1 ) empirical evidence link repeat instance effortful listen subsequent cognitive failure 2 ) self- report measure show change behavioral measure . It suggest may indicate subjective ( self-report ) measure behavioral measure assess separate aspect fatigue . It may also due subjective measure individual bias . As mentioned , numerous study subjective , objective behavioral measure LE , yet , study actual behavior employ listener reduce listen effort . Further , researcher understand behavior influence ability listener monitor maintain conversational speech . Listeners must rely peripheral central auditory mechanism process speech . As auditory signal increase complexity , likewise increase auditory processing require understand speech . The effort auditory system must put forth process complex signal even great signal degrade imbedded compete signal background noise . This require increased exertion mental effort part listener , result reduction ability maintain focus increase fatigue . These issue amplify presence peripheral hearing disorder listener mechanisms require properly process even simple unchallenged auditory signal . Research demonstrate decrease word recognition accuracy decrease Signal Noise Ratio ( SNR ) demonstrate increase listen effort speech present increasingly negative SNRs . Numerous study report increase listen effort require individual hearing loss . The purpose investigation quantify listen effort base subjective , objective behavioral measure different Signal Noise Ratios ( SNR ) .</detailed_description>
