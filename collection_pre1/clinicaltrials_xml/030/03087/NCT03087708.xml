	<brief_title>Naloxegol Treating Patients With Stage IIIB-IV Non-small Cell Lung Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To determine feasibility safety long-term administration two dose peripheral opioid receptor antagonist patient advance non-small cell lung cancer ( NSCLC ) receive first-line pemetrexed-based chemotherapy . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . To explore whether patient randomize one two study drug arm less decline health-related quality life ( HRQoL ) patient randomize placebo . II . To estimate difference pain level opioid/non-opioid analgesic requirement patient receive naloxegol placebo . III . To estimate difference adverse peripheral effect opioids ( e.g . constipation , nausea/emesis , dry mouth urinary retention ) patient receive naloxegol placebo . IV . To explore whether signal naloxegol may associate long progression-free survival ( PFS ) overall survival ( OS ) . V. To evaluate difference discontinuation rate chemotherapy due adverse event ( AEs ) death attributable chemotherapy . TERTIARY OBJECTIVES : I . To examine MOR expression activation prognostic marker advance NSCLC , whether expression/activation use guide pain management . OUTLINE : Patients randomize 1 3 group . GROUP I ( LOWER DOSE NALOXEGOL ) : Patients receive low dose naloxegol orally ( PO ) daily ( QD ) placebo PO QD . Courses repeat every 3 week absence unacceptable toxicity . GROUP II ( HIGHER DOSE NALOXEGOL ) : Patients receive placebo PO QD high dose naloxegol PO QD . Courses repeat every 3 week absence unacceptable toxicity . GROUP III ( PLACEBO ) : Patients receive placebo PO QD . Courses repeat every 3 week absence unacceptable toxicity . After completion study treatment , patient follow every 3 month .</detailed_description>
