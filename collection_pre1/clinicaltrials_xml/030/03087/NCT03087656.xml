	<brief_summary>Endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography ( ERCP ) endoscopic procedure use treat bile duct stone , obstructive jaundice , biliary leak , variety condition . There active debate whether antibiotic give prophylactically ERCP outside high risk indication include primary sclerosing cholangitis . In part due lack appropriately power clinical trial adequate follow . The aim ass whether prophylactic antibiotic decrease rate post ERCP cholangitis define Revised Tokyo Criterion .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Antibiotics Decrease Post ERCP Cholangitis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES AND PURPOSE The aim determine whether brief course antibiotic follow therapeutic ERCP reduce post-ERCP cholangitis patient antibiotic already indicate . STUDY DESIGN The study prospective , randomized trial consist 452 patient schedule undergo therapeutic ERCP LAC+USC Medical Center standard indication . Patients undergo ERCP therapy bile duct problem include choledocholithiasis , malignant obstruction , jaundice , bile leak eligible . Those mandatory antibiotic requirement exclude . Patients randomly assign 1:1 ratio use computer generate randomization schedule allocation conceal . Patients randomize ERCP procedure , decompression duct achieve ( either obstruction clear stent place ) , ensure patient increase risk ( inability decompress duct stent clearance ) exclude study . Those randomized antibiotic arm receive intravenous antibiotic ( ceftriaxone 1gm ) immediately follow ERCP procedure take oral antibiotic ( levofloxacin 500mg ) daily 3 subsequent day . This regimen chosen closely reflect actual clinical practice center . Those antibiotic arm receive antibiotic . However , develop finding cholangitis infection treat antibiotic . Comprehensive data include procedure indication record . The primary outcome development post-ERCP cholangitis . Post-ERCP cholangitis define 2013 Tokyo Guidelines The secondary outcome include length hospital stay adverse event attributable antibiotic use allergic reaction diarrhea . All patient assess 1 , 3 , 7 day procedure in-person visit inpatient telephone call outpatient . Patients fever , pain , jaundice , sign adverse antibiotic outcome evaluate would do per standard clinical care . Randomization scheme . Patients randomly assign use computer generate randomization schedule conceal 1:1 allocation receive prophylactic course antibiotic antibiotic . ASSESSMENT OF EFFICACY AND SAFETY Side effects/Toxicities monitor . Major adverse outcome could associate antibiotic therapy record include unexpected allergy ( rash angioedema ) , adverse drug reaction ( diarrhea , nausea ) . Patients diarrhea test Clostridium difficile colitis . The overall rate antibiotic associate event estimate 0.5-2 % .2,13-15 CRITERIA FOR EVALUATION AND ENDPOINT DEFINITIONS The outcome status ( term rate cholangitis pancreatitis well antibiotic toxicity adverse event ) eligible patient report . All eligible patient begin treatment include analysis survival time-to-failure . Endpoint Definitions Primary outcome : The primary outcome development DEFINITE post-ERCP cholangitis &lt; 7 day . Post-ERCP cholangitis define 2013 Updated Tokyo Guidelines ( TG13 ) international standard.12 As patient study definition undergo therapeutic ERCP , criterion C fulfil . A ) Systemic Inflammation B ) Cholestasis C ) Imaging-biliary dilation and/or evidence etiology Secondary Outcome # 1 : We compare proportion mild , moderate , severe cholangitis two group base Tokyo Guidelines ( see ) 12 Secondary Outcome # 2 : `` Suspected cholangitis '' , define Tokyo guideline ( see table 1 ) within 7 day ERCP . Secondary Outcome # 3 : The requirement repeat procedure define ERCP , percutaneous drainage , surgery cholangitis within 7 day ERCP . Secondary Outcome # 4 : The length hospital stay ERCP . Secondary Outcome # 5 : The rate post-ERCP pancreatitis , define : new onset upper abdominal pain , amylase lipase ≥3 time upper limit normal , hospitalization ≥2 night follow ERCP . Secondary Outcome # 6 : The rate allergic reaction , serious adverse event , C. difficile colitis attributable antibiotic use . The time period outcome within 7 day ERCP . Inpatient telephone assessment do 1 , 3 , 7 day ERCP patient . Any patient suspect pancreatitis cholangitis advise return endoscopy area immediately physical examination well vitals sign laboratory assessment ( see telephone form ) . In case potentially evidence cholangitis pancreatitis , PI study team define whether clinical constellation suggestive cholangitis , pancreatitis process . STATISTICAL CONSIDERATIONS The goal randomize study determine whether prophylactic antibiotic course prevent cholangitis follow therapeutic ERCP . Review 200 patient LAC USC antibiotic course give revealed rate cholangitis 1 % . A meta-analysis randomized trial antibiotic prevent ERCP cholangitis suggest rate 5.8 % control ( antibiotic group ) large individual trial reporting rate 6 % .8 Pubished rate cholangitis without antibiotic approximately 6 % . Thus α=0.05 , β=0.8 assume attrition 5 % estimate sample size 452 ( 226 per group ) adequate detect statistically significant difference rate post-ERCP cholangitis ( assume difference 1 % versus 6 % ) within 7 day . Intent-to-treat analysis dichotomous outcome compare use Fischer 's exact test continuous outcome compare use Wilcoxan rank sum T test , depend distribution . Multivariate logistic regression use sensitivity analysis primary outcome imbalance baseline characteristic , well differential pattern miss data adherence group .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Patients age 18 90 year undergoing therapeutic ERCP standard , biliary indication include limited : suspect bile duct stone malignant benign biliary obstruction bile leak Patients incarcerated Patients competent give inform consent Patients periprocedural antibiotic mandatory . These include patient : primary sclerosing cholangitis , multiple biliary stricture , hilar tumor , neutropenia ( absolute neutrophil count &lt; 500 ) , immunosuppressive therapy . Patients diagnose cholangitis suspect another active infection require antibiotic ( infect fluid collection ) . Patients receive antibiotic within 7 day . Patient undergone ERCP within 30 day . Patients undergo multiple ERCP clinical indication eligible participate study one procedure . Patients prior biliary surgery . Patients bile duct decompression unsuccessful exclude patient increase risk cholangitis . Patients immediate procedural complication bowel perforation . Patients undergo ERCP diagnostic purpose exclude aim study role antibiotic undergoing therapeutic ERCP . Pregnant woman Patient allergy cephalosporins , fluoroquinolones , penicillin . Patients renal insufficiency ( creatinine clearance &lt; 80ml50ml/minute ) , dose modification necessary . Withdrawal Criteria : Patients withdraw consent withdrawn study .</criteria>
