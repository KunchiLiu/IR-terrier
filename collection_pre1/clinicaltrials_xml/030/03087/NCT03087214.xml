	<brief_summary>The epidemiology ecology malaria human include complex interaction human host mosquito vector . These interaction spatio-temporal nature heavily dependent transportation capability seasonal condition . Where infection acquire well understood Greater Mekong Subregion ( GMS ) , numerous vector , many different behaviour habitat . For example , many infection appear associate forest forest edge important mosquito vector region forest dweller ( Obsomer , Defourny , Coosemans 2007 ) . Interventions target house night-time ( e.g . mosquito net ) , limited success GMS , likely least infection acquire day outside home ( Dolan et al . 1993 ; Luxemburger et al . 1994 ) . While overall malaria incidence region appear decline , disease remain persistent small subregions , example along international border join Thailand Myanmar . It crucial elimination effort address persistent malaria region , likely require use novel spatially targeted approach . Increasingly , spatial data analysis use disease research ( Linard Tatem 2012 ; Pybus et al . 2016 ; Tatem et al . 2012 ) , however spatial analysis aggregate scale , use data provincial state level . More detailed study single geographic reference point per individual study , frequently home ( Mosha et al . 2014 ; Parker et al . 2015 ) . These study allow researcher investigate potential clustering case within house ( `` hotspot '' ) ( Bejon et al . 2014 ; Bousema et al . 2012 ; Mosha et al . 2014 ) . Even detailed study typically ignore space people spend time outside home may acquire infection : school ; place worship work ; forest camp temporary shelter . Given many malaria infection GMS acquire outside home , area usually map , information important developing strategy prevent transmission crucial achieve elimination . Researchers substantive area already begin map movement pattern study subject exposure variety environmental exposure outside home assess ( Matthews Yang 2013 ; Vazquez-Prokopec et al . 2010 ) . Early approach rely travel survey travel diary , bias unknown magnitude . Modern wearable global positioning satellite ( GPS ) instrument ( logger tracker ) geographic information science ( GIS ) enable detailed mapping quantification human movement pattern . Through analyse difference movement pattern human versus acquire infectious disease , may possible identify narrow set geographic space disease transmission occur . Public health intervention could target risk area . Most detailed study do economically developed setting urban environment . Infectious disease malaria remain persistent resource-poor , rural , remote area - region least likely study detailed approach ( Sachs Malaney 2002 ) .</brief_summary>
