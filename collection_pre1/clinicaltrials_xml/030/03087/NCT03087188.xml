	<brief_summary>There different therapy strategy patient suffer obstructive lung disease like chronic obstructive pulmonary disease ( COPD ) , asthma bronchial available . One strategies include inhalative drug , e.g . ß2-mimetics , anticholinergic drug , glucocorticoid , indicate often use different inhalation device . Dry powder inhalator , dosieraerosol use clinical routine . Further strategy treat obstructive lung disease innovative system like Respimat system liquid inhalation . However , success therapy depend correct application technique . In clinical routine high error rate observe . Consequently , initiative German league respiratory tract publish internet-based film sequence order demonstrate use inhalator correctly . These film available internet everyone watch often need order improve technique facilitate training . Therefore , study aim evaluate follow aspect : - amount wrong application ambulant hospitalize patient ( wrong term lack knowledge use inhalator incorrect utilization ) - amount correct application patient first use inhalator incorrectly improve technique watch film sequence - evaluation learning success within 2 week 2 month ( follow-up visit ambulance )</brief_summary>
