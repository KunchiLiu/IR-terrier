	<brief_summary>Cotrimoxazole preventive therapy ( CPT ) recommend prevention morbidity mortality due Pneumocystis pneumonia infection HIV positive patient low immunity . Common clinical practice start CPT patient CD4 count 200/µL , , conversely , stop CPT immunity restore antiretroviral treatment CD4 count 200/µL viral suppression document 3 month . However , late WHO guideline widely expand indication CPT advocate setting high prevalence malaria bacterial infection , patient HIV start CPT regardless CD4 count clinical stage . Furthermore , WHO recommend patient continue CPT indefinitely regardless evidence immune restoration ( The recommendation setting high prevalence malaria bacterial infection , high-income country ) . There limited scientific evidence recommend prolong CPT , study show associate modestly reduce morbidity due pneumonia , meningitis malaria , correspond reduction mortality . The impact large increase antibiotic use emergence antimicrobial resistance thoroughly consider . Our previous study Tanzania show multidrug-resistant bacteria frequently cause bloodstream infection resultant high case-fatality rate . As gene encode multiple antibiotic resistance trait transfer plasmid together resistance towards cotrimoxazole , prolong CPT likely favor selection carriage multidrug-resistant gut bacteria .

	<brief_title>Impact Cotrimoxazole Use Immunocompetent HIV Patients Carriage Antimicrobial Resistant Bacteria</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Background Bacterial infection account large proportion global morbidity mortality . While antimicrobial drug help save million consequence infection , emerge antimicrobial resistance threatens reverse gain . The HIV-epidemic render large population drastically susceptible bacterial infection , particularly Sub-Saharan Africa , HIV rampant health-systems deal consequence insufficient . Indiscriminate use antimicrobial think main driving force behind emerge resistance . The opportunistic infection Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia ( PJP ) major cause mortality among HIV-infected people low immunity . Continuous cotrimoxazole preventive therapy ( CPT ) prove reduce morbidity mortality PJP globally , well Africa burden HIV large [ Anglaret 1999 , Mermin 2004 ] . The impact large-scale antibiotic use emergence antimicrobial resistance Africa remain unclear . In recent literature review , Sibanda colleague [ Sibanda 2011 ] find two study specifically design answer question whether CPT induce resistance common bacterial pathogen [ Hamel 2008 , Gill 2008 ] , 15 study assess question sub-analyses study design purpose . The two targeted study assess resistance pneumococcus , one finding increase resistance clindamycin CPT group [ Gill 2008 ] , neither find difference resistance penicillin . While 15 study assess penicillin-resistance pneumococcus methicillin-resistance Staphylococcus aureus ( MRSA ) , two study evaluate effect Gram-negative bacteria [ Martin 1999 , Dar 2003 ] . Among , study San Francisco [ Martin 1999 ] show significantly high temporal increase 1988 1995 resistance cotrimoxazole , ampicillin , cefazolin gentamicin clinical isolates E. coli HIV-positives HIV-negatives . The study HIV-infected child pneumonia Cape Town [ Zar 2003 ] find association CPT resistance clinical isolates , include 26 isolates Klebsiella pneumonia , prevalent Gram-negative microbe study . In previous research Tanzania , find multi-drug resistance Gram-negative bacteria prevalent [ Blomberg 2004 , Blomberg 2005 ] problem major public health concern , invasive infection bacteria associate large increase mortality [ Blomberg 2005 , Blomberg 2007 ] . Our study find case-fatality rate ( &gt; 70 % ) approach pre-antibiotic era systemic bacterial infection multi-resistant Gram-negative bacteria harbor extended-spectrum beta-lactamase ( ESBL ) resistance . ESBLs enzymes render all-important antibiotic , penicillin cephalosporin , useless . We also confirm previous finding case-fatality rate bacterial sepsis high HIV-infected HIV-negative patient [ Blomberg 2007 ] . Most disturbingly , study confirm multidrug-resistant Gram-negative bacteria gene encode ESBL resistance transfer plasmid together resistance several antibiotic , include cotrimoxazole [ Tellevik 2007 ] . Thus , plausible widespread cotrimoxazole use could lead selection multidrug-resistant Gram-negative bacteria gut HIV-patients , consequently could contribute rapid spread harmful difficult-to-treat bacteria . In high-resource country , show CPT safely discontinue CD4 count increase beyond 200/uL [ Furrer 1999 ] . Recent study Sub-Saharan Africa indicate prolong CPT immune restoration CD4 count &gt; 200/µL antiretroviral treatment ( ART ) may beneficial associate reduced hospitalization malaria bacterial infection child . There , however , difference mortality among stop continue CPT [ Bwakura-Dangarembizi 2014 ] . In `` 2014 supplement WHO guideline use antiretroviral drug treat prevent HIV infection '' ( see URL-link reference ) , recommendation CPT use widely expand setting high prevalence malaria bacterial infection , recommend patient HIV start CPT regardless CD4 count clinical stage receive prolong CPT indefinitely time . Tanzanian national guideline recommend discontinue CPT patient stabilize CD4 count &gt; 350/µL , extensive recommendation European guideline , much less extensive WHO recommendations `` setting high prevalence malaria bacterial infection '' . Cotrimoxazole widely use number different indication , result , cotrimoxazole resistance general increase [ Zacharias 2002 ] . Given limit publish data important public health issue , design study address potential impact prolong CPT antimicrobial resistance development particular focus Gram-negative gut microbe , VRE ( vancomycin-resistant enterococci ) , nasal carriage MRSA . If study confirm mark increase carriage multidrug-resistant bacteria patient prolong CPT need consider develop new guideline . We also aim assess whether restoration immunity ART could way counteract threat antimicrobial resistance . This propose randomized clinical trial perform set ongoing Dar e Salaam - Bergen collaborative initiative include local investigator laboratory worker , along Norwegian investigator scientific experience clinical molecular study Tanzania . Problem statement/ research gap CPT standard care prevent PJP infection among HIV-infected patient CD4 count &lt; 200µL since early 1990s . The recent recommendation WHO give CPT indefinitely HIV-infected people resource-constrained setting , even initial good immunity ( CD4 count 350/µL ) whose immunity restore antiretroviral treatment , would lead massive increase cotrimoxazole consumption Sub-Saharan Africa , large burden HIV-infection . While recommendation base limited scientific data regard short-term morbidity , evidence improve survival potential harmful implication selection multidrug-resistant bacteria HIV-patients prolong CPT comprehensively study . Rationale study Continuing CPT indefinitely stable good immunity CD4 count &gt; 350/µL show reduce morbidity , mortality , person live HIV resource-constrained setting . Complying recommendation continuation CPT indefinitely patient restore immunity virological control would imply massively increased consumption cotrimoxazole HIV-endemic country . The risk increase carriage multidrug-resistant bacteria among HIV-patients prolong CPT comprehensively study , potentially grave implication public health , since systemic infection resistant bacteria difficult treat associate high mortality rate . The current study design ass whether prolonged CPT associate increased carriage multidrug-resistant bacteria . The result study may important implication development new guideline CPT use resource-constrained setting may help prevent emerge antibacterial resistance .</detailed_description>
