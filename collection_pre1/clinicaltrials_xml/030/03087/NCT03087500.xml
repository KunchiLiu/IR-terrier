	<brief_summary>The overall goal study evaluate biomarkers oxidative stress , mitochondrial function , DNA methylation ( epigenetics ) order determine extent biomarkers related cognitive , behavioral adaptive function Down Syndrome . The inter-relationship measurable biomarkers functional/cognitive ability move beyond genetics provide unprecedented new knowledge broader understand underlying pathophysiology abnormal gene expression induce trisomy 21 .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The Investigators preliminary evidence indicate people DS metabolic biomarkers associate oxidative stress ( GSH/GSSG ) reduce methylation capacity ( SAM/SAH ) well abnormal DNA methylation ( epigenetics ) . The investigative team hypothesize abnormal metabolic process contribute abnormality behavior development associate trisomy 21 ; connection never investigate . Confirming expand preliminary data would provide new understanding biological functional etiology behavioral developmental delay associate Trisomy 21 . Further , establish underlie relationship metabolic abnormality behavioral/cognitive function age spectrum provide strong support design future treatment individual DS aim improve behavior development . In addition , biomarkers may also prove predictive biomarkers risk develop ASD like behavior Alzheimer 's disease population . Finally , examine modulate role diet severity biological abnormality provide new information lifestyle guidance improve biomarkers potentially minimize medical co-morbidities associate trisomy 21 .</detailed_description>
