	<brief_title>Well-Being Medical Residents</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Background : The residency promote learn , improve development skill , competency , practice attitudes characteristic different medical specialty . Just health child reflect health future population , university residency likely reflect quality health system . Collapsed overloaded health system rely resident low-cost human resource . The residency program characterize supervise learn system promote progressive independence decision make clinical reasoning . This learning experience affect many factor like stress , sleep deprivation , poor learn environment , relocation issue , vertical structure , excess administrative task work overload among others . This characteristic learning/working environment individual direct impact safety , processing , learn decision-making capacity group effect safety quality patient 's care . Residents population high risk depression , burnout social isolation . The well-being resident key aspect training monitor security event , manage actively promote . While several strategy use measure degree work overload impact training resident , none seem holistic appropriate understand dimension complex phenomenon . The aim generate validate tool measure well-being resident consider multidimensional feature . Research Question : Is possible build valid instrument measure well-being resident medical residency program ? Instrument description : It plan develop paper multidimensional , self-administered , questionnaire , relative brief , considers important domain well-being . The main feature instrument show figure 2 ( domain , format , administration , score ) . The whole process generation validation instrument well-being measurement resident develop accord study protocol . All study participant give freely inform consent participate . The protocol inform consent evaluate approve independent research ethic committee start study . The protocol register argentinian public database research protocols clinicaltrials.gov . Development validation 1 . Well-being instrument development 1.1 . Conceptual framework development : The aim first meet construct simpler conceptual framework medical resident well-being consider literature review , thought , expertise experience participant . In group expert education , resident medical specialist develop group conceptual framework use Nominal Group Technique ( NGT ) . This technique solve method design provide member group equal voice resolution particular problem . A complete description original technique may find Van de Ven AH , Delbecq AL . The nominal group research instrument exploratory health study . Am J Public Health . 1972 ; 62 : 337-342 7 . 1.2 . Domain selection The domain select accord consensus group expert education , resident medical specialist consider conceptual framework define problem previous meeting . Potential domain include physical , mental , social , role/functional , fatigue/sleep , burnout , work environment , future potentiality , mistreat/abuse , learn experience/environment , self care , resilience . Previous instrument consider , conceptual framework , experience opinion participate expert , bibliography well-being resident decide main domain represent instrument . NGT use make grupal decision . 1.3 . Item selection access domain Each domain consist 5 10 item . Likert pseudo-Likert scale use 5 standard option neutral central value . All item affirmation statement obtain previous instrument measure similar construct , previous literature , experience consensus group integrate resident , specialist education , medical specialist . Initially , item group considers pertinent per domain include . For generation list item per domain , NGT use . For design item , previous instrument , conceptual framework , experience opinion participate expert , bibliography well-being resident consider . The list item per domain , reduce contain minimum 5 item maximum 10 item accord group discussion consensus . The NGT use define group order accord importance Each participant consensus group order item domain accord order importance . The item reduce accord redundancy , difficult translation language , awkward phrase , excessively idiomatic expression , difficulty understand less relative importance respect rest item . The select item refine . They phrase plain language avoid ambiguity . With single concept affirmation , short sentence . A 7th grade complete primary education ( accord argentinian education system ) level use . The use slang confusing word avoid . The time frame item increase measurement precision avoid ambiguity discuss . The item sort order keep general less personal item begin , private item end . The item refer time frame similar concept order proximity . The order item respect domain , design increase responsiveness , comprehension precision . The option always evenly arrange avoid error fill . 1.4 . Scale scoring structure design For scale item Likert pseudo-Likert scale , score 0 bad lack well-being , 4 best well-being option use . In case , high score assign response represent great well-being situation lower score lower well-being . The result questionnaire presented one score per domain global score . Each domain maximum score 100 minimum 0 , well global score . Each item assign weight score accord group consensus importance item domain . The score domain obtain add weighted score item within domain . Each domain assign weight score accord global importance domain whole construct decide group consensus . This weight assign domain use sum global score whole questionnaire . Once validation period instrument finish , scale apply large population resident use network like Sociedad Argentina de Medicina ( Argentinian Medicine Society ) . With result , average standard deviation obtain . This table use calculate z-score ( standard deviation unit ) accord sex age domain global score . 1.5 . Preliminary version pretest A preliminary version pretested group resident present , medical specialist specialist medical education . Clear instruction add header complete questionnaire solve case mistake answer . A final thank-you message add . 2 . Validation 2.1 . Content validity face validity : To evaluate face validity content validity final version questionnaire produce development phase use . Face validity evaluate ask different participant whether questionnaire seem valid represent construct well-being . Content validity evaluate instrument inspection discussion group expert resident describe last section development phase . The group discussion focus whether instrument incorporates appropriate component facet measurement construct intend represent . Each participant answer item include questionnaire essential represent construct resident well-being . 2.2 . Criterion validity Criterion validity evaluate assess concurrent validity predictive validity use sample resident . There appropriate gold standard evaluate concurrent validity I find instrument design validated represent construct well-being resident choose perspective . Two imperfect approximation use gold standard : correlation global score SF36 [ 20 ] tool access global quality life WRQoL scale . A sample resident complete three questionnaire ( SF36 , WRQoL well-being resident questionnaire ) . Pearson 's correlation coefficient use evaluate association global scale SF36 WRQoL . Even though two scale gold standard construct investigator expect highly correlate global scale new instrument . To evaluate predictive validity sample resident use access new questionnaire able predict occurrence future event : medical error , level stress depression , alcoholism , drug abuse , residence abandon . 2.3 . Construct validity The evaluation construct validity implies accumulation evidence questionnaire actually measure construct . To evaluate construct validity resident well-being questionnaire convergent discriminant validity evaluate ( Multitrait-Multimethod approach ) , test hypothesis association questionnaire scale different situation evaluate behaviour know group . With evaluation , investigator plan gather information performance questionnaire scale conceptual model hypothesize relationship . Convergent discriminant validity test measure sample resident simultaneously relate related scale well-being questionnaire . To access convergent validity , physical activity , depression , anxiety use . To access discriminant validity use socio-economical status use , SF36 subscales domain BMI . The Multitrait-Multimethod Approach use build matrix correlation different scale access domain global scale well-being questionnaire . Additionally expect see well-being relate specific rotation like clinical research , elective rotation compare night shift excess workload vacation period . The measurement instrument compare resident specific rotation .</detailed_description>
