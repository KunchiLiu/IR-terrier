Currently , surgical treatment minimally invasive technique consolidate preferred technique treatment condition . In technique metal bar insert retrosternal position , push sternum without necessity resect condral cartilage . Despite advantage obtain technique , without complication displacement bar one important . In order minimize problem develop new model stabilizer , well necessary instrument perform minimally invasive surgery . The aim study compare two surgical group , one making use new oblique stabilizer compare conventional perpendicular stabilizer determine one less displacement .

	<brief_title>Evaluation New Model Metallic Bar Stabilizer Use MIRPE</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Introduction Pectus excavatum ( PE ) present sunken sternum midline chest deformity uncommon , occur approximately 1/1000 . It commonly accept abnormal growth condral cartilage result displacement sternum . Most patient parent seek medical advice psychosocial concern , particularly relate cosmetic aspect consequent aversion sport public exposure . Physiological test often normal , cardiac index pulmonary function may affect . Surgical treatment pectus excavatum Nuss break paradigm PE surgery publication result use technique call minimally invasive . This technique involve lateral incision chest placement one two temporary steel bar , shape surgery , specifically patient . These bar place retrosternal position sternum elevate without need cartilage resection . This surgical technique , addition bar stabilizer , need set instrument use customization bar patient , three year , withdrawal bar end treatment . Another problem refer displacement metallic bar position sternum hold position place stabilizer , one lateral end bar . These stabilizer , perpendicular bar , function expand area contact chest wall order prevent move position . In order increase stability bar , prevent movement , various modification propose . The investigator believe modification introduce . If stabilizer metal bar oblique position relative bar ( rather perpendicular currently ) perpendicular rib , thus increase area contact chest wall , might bring stability . The investigator also propose new metal bar develop completely smooth , usual slot current model extremity bar . The reason try prevent bleed bar withdrawal 3 year use . Another propose amendment pressure screw incorporated stabilizer . Search object The object research development new model metallic bar stabilizer , well dedicated surgical instrument whose purpose perform minimally invasive repair PE . Social relevance One reason Public Health Brazil give coverage type surgical treatment patient PE high cost surgical equipment import . The development material country , propose project , high social relevance may represent saving avoid purchase import material possibility make available type surgical treatment patient serve public health . Site search The research perform Department Thoracic Surgery , Heart Institute ( InCor ) Hospital da Clinicas , Faculty Medicine , University SÃ£o Paulo .</detailed_description>
