	<brief_summary>Pediatric Multiple sclerosis ( MS ) chronic inflammatory disease define multiple episode demyelination central nervous system ( CNS ) separate time space specify adult explain acute disseminated encephalomyelitis ( ADEM ) . Several study indicate least 5 % MS patient pediatric population , prospective study perform Brazil . There particular characteristic Pediatric MS differs adult population focus interest last year . However , still lack high evidence data , specially concern treatment , age group . This observational non-interventional multicenter study pediatric MS patient participate subject characterize clinical , MRI immunological feature . In observational study , select 8 MS center Brazil recruit least 100 pediatric patient currently follow center idiopathic inflammatory CNS disorder 2-year study period . We collect retrospective prospective clinical MRI data determine proportion patient fulfill International Pediatric Multiple Sclerosis Study Group ( IPMSSG ) criteria MS,7 especially 10 year use McDonald 2010 criterion recommend routinely . Following inclusion study , subject follow least 2 year . All subject enrol study serum collect test autoantibody include anti-AQP4 anti-MOG use cell-based assay transfected cells.8 Pediatric patient positive test autoantibody analyze separately . Exploratory MRI sub-study In 10 patient recruited Hospital SÃ£o Lucas PUCRS , perform exploratory substudy advance MRI use q-space diffusion protocol 3-Tesla MRI ( GE Signa HDx 3.0T , General Electric , Milwaukee , WI , USA ) 8-channel head coil visualize remyelinating brain MS lesion . Normalized leptokurtic diffusion ( NLD ) data acquire use diffusion-weighted echo planar imaging . All MRI scan exploratory study perform Brain Institute Rio Grande Sul ( BraIns ) . Only patient previous brain demyelinating lesion include exploratory sub-study .</brief_summary>
