	<brief_summary>In neurosurgical anesthesia , propofol base total intravenous anesthesia ( TIVA ) frequently use due brain relaxation less effect electrophysiologic monitoring . Response propofol vary individual associate clinical factor include age weight , genetic polymorphism . Because importance rapid recovery neurosurgery long operation time emphasize recently , choice dose adjustment anesthetic determine accord clinical genetic factor . Recently , research genetic variation perform single nucleotide polymorphism ( SNP ) . The aim study find SNPs associate propofol recovery response genome-wide association study ( GWAS ) Korean adult population undergo propofol base TIVA clip unruptured cerebral aneurysm .</brief_summary>
