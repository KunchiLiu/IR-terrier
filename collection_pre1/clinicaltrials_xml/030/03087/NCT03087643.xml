	<brief_summary>With age , vascular function ( VF ) decline . Inactivity sedentary life style show contribute worsen VF . Furthermore , bed rest , condition commonly use management many chronic condition , prove lead even deleterious consequence , include VF decline . This study evaluate effect passive mobilization lower limbs VF bedridden oldest-old . Half participant undergo passive mobilization treatment addition standard therapy , half receive standard therapy . We hypothesize passive mobilization may improve nitric oxide ( NO ) -mediated endothelial function .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Normally , cardiovascular function decline age . Furthermore , cardiovascular function decline immobility , promote adverse effect postural hypotension , impaired cardiac function , thrombogenic event . Bed rest , condition normally use management many chronic pathology elderly people , lead significant functional decline , reduction physiologic reserve organ system , include cardiovascular decline . Fortunately , several study suggest intervention may counteract immobility-induced cardiovascular dysfunction ensure beneficial adaptation age population . For example , passive mobilization limb show improve cardiovascular function bedridden oldest-old . However , effect passive mobilization NO-mediated endothelial function study yet . Thus , main aim study determine whether passive mobilization effective strategy counteract endothelial dysfunction bedridden oldest-old . For purpose , bedridden individual recruit randomly assign two group : one group undergo passive mobilization treatment ( PM ) addition standard therapy , group ( CTRL ) undergo standard therapy . On basis preliminary data subgroup ten participant , sample eighteen individual allocate group reach statistical power &gt; 0.80 alpha &lt; 0.05 . The PM treatment include knee flexion-extension perform 30 minute , 2 time day , 5 day week 4 week . Before , 4-week treatment , 1 month end treatment NO-mediated endothelial function participant evaluate mean flow-mediated dilation passive limb movement test .</detailed_description>
