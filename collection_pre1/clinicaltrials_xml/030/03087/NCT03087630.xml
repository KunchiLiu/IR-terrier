	<brief_summary>This research examine theoretically inform web-based personalized feedback intervention reduce alcohol-related risky sexual behavior among young adult drinker . To accomplish objective study enrol national sample 1200 young adult age 18-20 process assess 3- , 6- , 9- , 12-months . The investigator evaluate overall efficacy intervention base Prototype Willingness Model compare underage young adult drinker randomly assign receive reason-based pathway intervention ( n=300 ) , social-based pathway intervention ( n=300 ) , integrate intervention base full Prototype Willingness Model ( pathway , n=300 ) attention control group ( n=300 ) . The investigator examine whether change component reason social pathway drink mediate intervention efficacy reduce alcohol-related risky sexual behavior . Past behavior college student status evaluate moderator intervention efficacy . The propose study significant innovative evaluate brief intervention among national sample young adult attend attend college , utilize social networking site participant recruitment , test efficacy intervention base individual integrated pathway Prototype Willingness Model .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Purpose This research design evaluate personalize feedback intervention alcohol-related risky sexual behavior longitudinal study underage young adult drinker age 18-20 . The intervention theoretically base Prototype Willingness Model ( PW Model ) . The Prototype Willingness Model assume two pathway risk behavior : one pathway reason one pathway socially base . Prior research show intervention consistent , base , component Prototype Willingness Model , efficacious reduce alcohol use risky sexual behavior . The investigator evaluate overall efficacy intervention base PW Model compare underage young adult drinker randomly assign receive reasoned-based pathway intervention ( n=300 ) , social-based pathway intervention ( n=300 ) , integrate intervention base full PW Model ( pathway ; n=300 ) attention control group ( n=300 ) . The investigator examine whether intervention efficacy reduce alcohol-related risky sexual behavior mediate reduction drink change component reason social pathway ( e.g. , change attitude , injunctive descriptive normative perception , behavioral intention , perceive vulnerability , prototype favorability , behavioral willingness ) . Past behavior college student status evaluate moderator intervention efficacy . The investigator also examine whether effect three intervention maintain across study follow-up period . Procedures This study consist two phase . Phase 1 consist one-time online survey purpose collect normative data use personalized feedback intervention Phase 2 . Phase 2 include online screening , baseline assessment , personalize feedback intervention , follow four follow-up assessment . Initial recruitment procedure Phase 1 2 follow protocol . In phase , young people view study advertisement choose log-on study website view brief information statement , upon provide consent , proceed brief online screen survey contain question regard basic demographic contact information question necessary determine eligibility , detailed . Those complete survey meet online eligibility tell participant contact phone within 3 business day research staff explain study determine eligibility ( e.g. , age verification ) . During 5 minute telephone screen , potential participant give information study age verify research staff . Previously report demographic ( age , DOB , etc . ) online screen survey cross check data consistency . Once investigator verify age screen criterion participant give option receive link via e-mail information study ( i.e. , information statement ) participate web-survey . Upon completion telephone screen , interested eligible participant email link one-time assessment ( Phase 1 ) baseline assessment ( Phase 2 ) , well unique PIN separate email . Each survey begin full information statement , participant indicate consent begin assessment . Those begin complete assessment contact via email telephone . If time participant indicate unwillingness continue , contact ensue . The Phase 1 one-time assessment 30-45-minute survey consist question focus alcohol-related risky sexual behavior injunctive descriptive normative perception regard alcohol-related risky sex behavior others . Participants complete assessment pay gift certificate , email within 2 week complete survey . For Phase 2 , 30-45-minute baseline survey consist question similar Phase 1 survey . Upon completion baseline assessment , participant randomize one four condition : reasoned-based pathway intervention ( n=300 ) , social-based pathway intervention ( n=300 ) , integrate intervention ( base pathway ; n=300 ) , attention control group ( n=300 ) . Participants randomize intervention condition receive web-based graphic personalize feedback imbedded interactive web-based assessment . The control condition receive attention control feedback . The feedback non-confrontational tone , seek increase motivation reduce alcohol-related risky sexual behavior , base information provide baseline assessment . Participants able view feedback online print view entire feedback , click request copy mail . All personalized feedback intervention tailor base sexual orientation appropriate . Follow-up assessment occur 3 , 6 , 9 , 12 month baseline follow protocol include measure . Participants email invitation link survey separate PIN email Participants pay gift certificate assessment complete , also eligible entry draw assessment . Gift certificate e-mailed participant within 2 week complete survey . Subjects Phase 1 Participants include approximately 1,000 young adult age 18-20 , live United States complete one-time online assessment . Phase 2 Participants include 1,200 young adult age 18-20 , live United States complete baseline survey .</detailed_description>
