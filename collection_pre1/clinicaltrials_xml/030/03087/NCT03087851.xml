	<detailed_description>Background : Denosumab antibody receptor-activator nuclear factor kappa-B ligand prevents recruitment differentiation osteoclast . Treatment decrease bone resorption fracture risk . After discontinuation , however , bone resorption increase bone mass gain 2 year therapy lose within 1 year . At present denosumab treatment consider life-long . Aim : To investigate infusion zoledronic acid prevent increase bone turnover bone loss patient previously treat denosumab difference infuse zoledronic acid six nine month last injection denosumab bone turnover increase . Methods : The study randomize , open label , interventional study 60 patient osteoporosis . Treatment zoledronic acid administrate six month ( 6-months group , n=20 ) nine month ( 9-months group , n=20 ) last injection denosumab bone turnover increase ( observation group , n=20 ) . The patient observation group 9-months group monitor monthly month baseline s-carboxy-terminal collagen crosslinks ( s-CTX ) , s-CTX increase 1.26ug/l ( 50 % normal range postmenopausal woman elderly men ) patient suffers vertebral hip fracture infusion zoledronic acid administer . Furthermore , DXA scan ( lumbar spine hip site ) perform 3 month observation group , BMD decrease 5 % site , infusion zoledronic acid administer . If s-CTX increase 1.26 ug/l second year another infusion zoledronic acid administer . Perspectives : Many patient reach osteopenic BMD level treatment denosumab , however treatment effect bone turnover BMD demonstrate reversible therefore important find denosumab treatment discontinue bone mass maintain measure . This study show bone mass maintain administrate zoledronic acid time first dose zoledronic acid last dose denosumab matter . If bone loss prevent zoledronic acid expense otherwise life-long denosumab treatment save long-term side effect denosumab ( atypical femur fracture osteonecrosis jaw ) prevent .</detailed_description>
