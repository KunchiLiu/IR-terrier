	<brief_title>Automatic Self Transcending Meditation ( ASTM ) Patients With Dry Eye Disease</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>BACKGROUND AND RATIONALE : Dry eye disease ( DED ) may degrade vision interfere daily activity include reading , drive , view computer screen . Further , DED associate decreased productivity , absenteeism work , depression , post-traumatic stress disorder ( PTSD ) , adverse impact patient 's quality life . A category meditation call Automatic Self Transcending Meditation ( ASTM ) may help depression , PTSD , may positive impact quality life participant diagnose DED . ASTM class meditation help quiet mind induces physiological mental relaxation whilst eye shut . It utilize specific sound value ( mantra ) draw attention inward permit mind experience restful alert state consciousness . We offer patient specific standardized form ASTM call Sahaj Samadhi Meditation . In study , shall measure HRQoL patient DED ASTM intervention arm . HRQoL essential measure quality life related health ; help physician identify hidden morbidity clinical care well improve patient-physician communication . However , majority current ophthalmic literature describe change clinical variable intervention whilst lack information HRQoL . The reason lack HRQoL data publish ophthalmic literature likely difficult cumbersome estimate . Additionally , unfortunate many clinician severely underestimate added value HRQoL measurement routine clinical practice . We think high necessity ass association HRQoL routinely measure clinical data . A primary purpose study assess ASTM confers beneficial effect HRQoL DED patient compare intervention arm . Additionally , assess change , , ASTM confer self-reported depression anxiety symptom secondary outcome measure . PRIMARY HYPOTHESIS : We hypothesize patient DED ASTM + TAU lead significant improvement HRQoL compare TAU alone baseline 24 week initial ASTM training . SECONDARY HYPOTHESES : We hypothesize patient DED 1 ) HRQoL associate regularly measure clinical variable 2 ) ASTM+TAU lead significant improvement depression anxiety symptom 24 week compare TAU alone 3 ) The beneficial effect ASTM study variable sustain 24 week post intervention . STUDY DESIGN : We plan conduct single-center , single blind longitudinal randomize controlled trial . Research participants 256 men woman ( 128 group ) . STUDY RECRUITMENT : Potential participant mild severe DED 18 - 75 year age screen - office practice Dr. Mather per inclusion exclusion criterion - Dr. Mather Ivey Eye Institute , London , ON . Letter information ( LOI ) give potential participant . An ophthalmic examination - offer routine care - potential participant ( i.e. , measure best-corrected Snellen visual acuity ( VA ) pinhole acuity ) conduct . QUESTIONNAIRE : Patients undergo standardize interview perform trained interviewer measure HRQoL use time trade-off method ( TTO ) potential participant ask couple question quality life 1 ) long expect live ? 2 ) many remain year life , , would willing trade return treatment permit current vision eye transform permanent perfect vision ( 20/20 ) bilaterally ? . During first office visit , also screen visit , interview , patient ask demographic question include age , gender , associate medical condition , concurrent ocular condition , ocular disease DED , previous ocular surgery , inflammation , intraoperative complication , preoperative ocular pathology , chronic pain , general disease could affect immune system , actual infection . In addition , patient ask co-morbidities , whether high blood pressure , diabetes , arthritis , heart condition , stroke , non-ocular medical condition . Further , follow self-rated scale administer first office visit : TTO , Visual Function Questionnaire ( VFQ-25 ) , Patient Health Questionnaire ( PHQ-9 ) , Generalized Anxiety Disorder ( GAD-7 ) , Canadian Dry Eye Assessment ( CDEA ) , Ocular Surface Disease Index ( OSDI ) , SPEED Dry Eye Questionnaire . RANDOMIZATION : Participants randomize either ASTM + TAU TAU alone equally ( 1:1 ) use computer generate randomization number available random.org . Concealment randomization ensure independent staff perform randomization use third-party web base provider ( http : //www.sealedenvelope.com/ ) . Computerized randomization occur clinic Dr. Mather , Ivey Eye Institute St. Joseph 's Hospital , London , Ontario . A telephone number available study concerns/queries . Pre-randomized information store use unique de-identifiers download secure database . It possible blind participant intervention status . Outcome assessor investigator blind treatment . It possible blind participant staff provide treatment intervention status . TREATMENT ARMS : 1 . Automatic Self-Transcending meditation ( ASTM ) : Following initial measurement ( common ASTM control group ) , participant ASTM group undergo ASTM training group 10 certified teacher supervision one study collaborator room St. Joseph 's Hospital Ivey Eye Institute , 268 Grosvenor Street , London , ON . This involve participate four , 90-120 minute session four consecutive day . This follow weekly 60 minute follow session 4 week , biweekly session week 5- 12 week monthly follow-up session 13-24 week . Participants require attend 75 % weekly , bi-weekly , monthly follow-up session . In addition , participant ask practice ASTM home 20 minute twice daily study period ( 24 week ) . Participants ask log practice frequency noteworthy observation log sheet provide . Further , follow self-rated scale administer trained rater fourth ASTM session ( week 0 ) well week 4 , 8 , 12 , 24 : TTO , VFQ-25 , PHQ-9 , GAD-7 , CDEA , OSDI , SPEED Dry Eye Questionnaire . CONTROL INTERVENTION : Participants randomize control arm ( Treatment Usual , TAU ) continue receive treatment usual include DED medication . They follow assessment study procedure list . The following self-rated scale administer trained rater week 0 , 4 , 8 , 12 , 24 : TTO , VFQ-25 , PHQ-9 , GAD-7 , CDEA , OSDI , SPEED Dry Eye Questionnaire . Following duration week 24 study participant TAU arm also offer opportunity learn ASTM . No study procedure apply information collect period . STUDY RECRUITMENT : We anticipate recruit participant rate least 2 participants/week period 128 week allow attainment sample size n=256 . There obligation participant take part study ; participation voluntary . VARIABLE SPECIFICATION : Dependent variable : A dependent variable create base HRQoL , interval scale variable take value 0.0 1.0 . Independent variable : Visual acuity better-seeing eye , patient ' demographic characteristic , include age , gender , associate medical condition independent variable . Patients ' demographic characteristic , include age , consider continuous variable . Gender categorize male female associate medical condition categorize `` current medical condition , '' include concurrent ocular condition , inflammation ; `` disease , '' include ocular disease DED , chronic pain , general disease could affect immune system , actual infection ; `` medical history , '' include previous ocular surgery , preoperative ocular pathology , intraoperative complication . Data Grouping : Based BCVA , study participant group visual acuity well see eye ( group 1 , 20/20 20/50 ; group 2 , 20/60 20/100 ; group 3 , 20/200 light perception ) . Better see use since correlation show utility score well see eye . These 3 group choose since group 1 represent legal drive vision Canada , group 2 represent moderate visual acuity loss , group 3 represent legal blindness . DATA ANALYSIS : As do many study , HRQoL calculate divide number year patient willing trade return improve quality life estimate number year remain life subtract 1.0 give : HRQoL ( U ) =1- ( number year patient willing trade return improve quality life ) / ( estimate number year remain life ) . Mean , standard deviation , 95 % confidence interval continuous variable utility value , calculate . For categorical variable , visual acuity better-seeing eye , gender , associate medical condition , proportion calculate . The chi-square test statistic independence use compare unwillingness trade time TTO . The unpaired , two-tailed Student t-test use evaluate effect visual acuity well eye four group gender mean time trade-off utility value . Non-response issue : Non-respondent patient ' characteristic compare respondent patient , ' appear statistically significantly different , result generalize sample population . Data analyze use STATA Software ( Version 15.0 ) . The unit analysis HRQoL . Univariate bivariate analysis perform independent variable dependent variable elicit impact factor pattern HRQoL without adjust effect variable . Models deem statistically significant associate significant F value ( p &lt; 0.01 ) explain 15 % variability dependent variable . Only independent variable statistically significantly associate HRQoL ( p &lt; 0.05 ) use model construction . Since dependent variable continuous , plan use non-linear regression model assess effect independent variable dependent variable , control confounders . Multicollinearity , high correlation independent variable , interaction effect evaluate model . VALIDATION ANALYSIS : Validation perform developed regression model . The collect data divide two portion : one portion , call `` main data , '' contain 80 % sample total collected utility value associate data ; portion , call `` test data , '' contain remain 20 % . Validation do use test data coefficient value main data calculate percentage correct case . Similar regression analysis describe performed vision score measure VFQ-25 , depression score PHQ-9 , anxiety score GAD-7 , CDEA score , OSDI score , SPEED score .</detailed_description>
