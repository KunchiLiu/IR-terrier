	<brief_summary>Breast cancer ( BC ) treatment lead numerous side effect affect person 's life year treatment end . Research show regular exercise limit many side effect . However , less 30 % BC survivor regularly exercise due many barrier include patient unaware benefit exercise , health professional face institutional , personal , patient-related barrier promote exercise , lack knowledge translation ( KT ) strategy within cancer institution focus accessible exercise intervention education physiotherapist . For project , pilot study need first step order ass process resource variable implementation large-scale intervention . The primary objective pilot trial ass feasibility conduct large trial evaluate effect novel KT intervention use exercise self-management versus usual care among BC survivor . The secondary objective determine preliminary estimate effect KT intervention exercise plus self-management ( SM ) program versus usual care ( ) level exercise knowledge behaviour , ( b ) health relate quality life ( c ) resource utilization , among BC survivor four month period .</brief_summary>
