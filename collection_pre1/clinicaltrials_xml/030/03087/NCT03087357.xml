	<detailed_description>Women &amp; Infants Hospital Rhode Island ( WIH ) serve Study Center Laboratory Site . Enrollment Sites secure local IRB approval , identify , consent enroll pregnant woman , ship plasma sample WIH collect outcome information . Eligible patient one two group : - The 'high risk ' ( HR ) group - 250 woman consider diagnostic testing , nearly follow positive cell free ( cf ) DNA screen test . At least one case Down syndrome detect every three woman enrol , addition occasional case T18 T13 . - The 'low risk ' ( LR ) group - 2,400 woman conventional cfDNA screen primary screen test ( i.e. , serum/ultrasound test ) , represent general pregnancy population . Their group risk Down syndrome 1:500 . This group 20 % woman age 35 older . ( Women whose conventional cfDNA screen positive would eligible second enrollment 'high risk ' group ) . Both group woman ask provide three full 10mL Streck tube blood ( two tube minimum ) , agree release limit clinical information , provide sign consent ( include FDA personnel review record ) consent Enrollment Site staff review report need information newborn/infant examination record , request . Identifiable patient information hold Enrollment Sites release Laboratory Study Center . Sample outcome information identify unique study code . Individual cfDNA test result return Enrollment Sites , provider , enrol woman . Enrollment Sites receive summary result study end . Enrollment Sites likely enroll either HR LR woman , although site may able enroll . Both setting genetic counselor , physician , research assistant medical staff available identify , inform , consent enroll woman , well collect ship sample obtain pregnancy outcome information . Staff designate participate VALUE Study qualify inform eligible woman study 's benefit harm , collect/document inform consent ( remain site ) . The Study Center may request confirmation consent , become necessary . Outcomes HR woman choose diagnostic test result karyotype ; decline diagnostic test newborn/infant information collect ( often newborn karyotype ) . In LR population , negative cfDNA test result accept ruling common autosomal trisomy , residual risk would low ( &lt; 1:20,000 &lt; 1:50,000 ) . For LR woman positive cfDNA test , result diagnostic test would request . If diagnostic test result unavailable , review newborn examination/karyotype require confirmation . Any conflict result clinical test VALUE Study result ( false positive / false negative ) would also require resolution may involve review newborn/infant record . The VALUE Study intend enroll approximately 2,400 LR woman many 8 LR Enrollment Sites associate general risk obstetrical care practice . The 2,400 target set : 1 ) provide reasonably confident estimate expect low false positive rate ( e.g. , 0.2 % ) 2 ) provide sufficient number exercise test platform 12 month time period . The target 2,400 large enough meet objective slightly large number euploid sample test original NGS HR cfDNA validation study ( 2011-2012 ) . The number trisomy detect LR group fewer 10.An estimate 2 % ( 48 ) LR woman failed/no call cfDNA test.. Sample handling : Plasma sample could test fresh store test assay system validate . Outcome information collect Enrollment Sites sample test , ensure blind laboratory outcome . Timeframe : Identification Enrollment Sites secure Investigational Review Board ( IRB ) approval take three month . Efforts related set-up qualification test laboratory expect take four six month study-specific software development . Active enrollment schedule 12 month . The intent run majority sample fresh , allow long-term assay variability study . Follow-up complete , part , within two month final testing ( except small proportion woman test positive diagnostic testing ) . These outcome confirm time delivery .</detailed_description>
