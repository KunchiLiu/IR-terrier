	<brief_title>Low Intensity Resistance Training With Vascular Occlusion Coronary Heart Disease Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Physical activity patient coronary heart disease improve health , quality life , reduces risk coronary event , morbidity mortality . Aerobic training preferred part cardiac rehabilitation well establish evidence-based guideline . On hand , resistance training first introduce part cardiac rehabilitation decade ago , due positive effect performance , quality life muscle hypertrophy strength . Despite positive effect resistance training , still lack evidence effect cardiovascular health . Furthermore , guideline still specify exact training volume , dose type resistance training patient coronary heart disease . In clinical practice , often difficult contraindicate use near-maximal load ( e.g. , early stage cardiac rehabilitation , sport injury , etc. ) . Muscle atrophy weakness often occur rapidly affected area due effect trauma ( disease ) inactivity . Consequently , train modality promote hypertrophy counteract atrophy without use heavy load special interest rehabilitation chronic disease high musculoskeletal force contraindicate . Occlusive strength training tourniquet cuff first use nearly twenty year ago . Studies show low to-moderate intensity ( 20-50 % 1RM ) resistance train vascular occlusion lead gain muscle strength volume comparable see conventional heavy resistance training . This effect suggest , ischemic strength training may useful method rehabilitation context . To conclude , aim study compare effect low intensity resistance training vascular occlusion vs. normal physical activity : 1. muscle hypertrophy , strength neuromuscular parameter ; 2. vascular function ; 3. blood parameter ( anabolic catabolic hormone , catecholamine , inflammation factor , parameter oxidative stress etc . )</detailed_description>
