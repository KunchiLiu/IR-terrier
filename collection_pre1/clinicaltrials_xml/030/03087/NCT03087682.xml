	<brief_summary>OCT establish way measure thickness Retinal Nerve Fiber Layer ( RNFL ) retina eye . The thickness RNFL always reflection number RNFs particular area retina . Each single RNF run long course start cell body retinal ganglion cell retina end thalamus brain relay visual information nerve cell thalamus . Along long course RNFs close anatomical relationship pituitary gland cross gland midway along course . Hence enlargement gland interfere RNFs .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Pituitary Gland Enlargement Was First Diagnosed Optical Coherence Tomography ( OCT )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The inferior chiasmal syndrome know cause pituitary gland enlightenment pituitary gland lie optic chiasma . The visual RNFs organize specific way along long course retina Lateral Geniculate Body ( LGB ) thalamus . Pituitary enlargement would compromise particular RNFs . It well know establish pituitary enlargement , properly treat time , would possibly cause bitemporal hemianopia due interference cross RNFs nasal half retina . In study pituitary enlargement suspect OCT finding patient still perfect peripheral visual field eye .</detailed_description>
