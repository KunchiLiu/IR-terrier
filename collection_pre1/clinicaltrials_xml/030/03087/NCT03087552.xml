	<brief_summary>The spreading transcatheter aortic valve implantation paradoxically increase spectrum indication balloon aortic valvuloplasty . Balloon aortic valvuloplasty currently use destination therapy patient exclude transcatheter aortic valve implantation , bridge transcatheter aortic valve implantation surgical aortic valve replacement , stratification tool select high-risk patient immediate candidate transcatheter aortic valve implantation . Moreover , recently show transcatheter aortic valve implantation without balloon aortic valvuloplasty encumber increase risk cerebral embolization . However , balloon aortic valvuloplasty complication rate comparable transcatheter aortic valve implantation , mainly related access site temporary pacemaker implantation . Thus , transradial mini-invasive approach rapid pace 0,035 inch leave ventricular support wire could extremely appeal .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Consecutive patient severe aortic stenosis indication aortic balloon valvuloplasty enrol . An ad hoc inform consent procedure obtain patient . This prospective observational study . The Investigators include patient aortic ballloon valvuloplasty attempt radial access without temporary pacemaker implantation . The aim register monitor effectiveness safety approach . Details regard management radial access pace 0.035 wire find reference report . The primary endpoint 30-day serious adverse event rate ( intraprocedural death , stroke , coronary dissection/occlusion , moderate-severe aortic regurgitation , hypotension require resuscitation intubation cardioversion , tamponade , permanent pacemaker , serious vascular complication require intervention ) . The safety endpoint absence intra- periprocedural major complication transradial balloon aortic valvuloplasty , namely balloon entrapment compartment syndrome require surgical intervention . The feasibility endpoint procedural success rate â‰¥90 % . The efficacy endpoint reduction mean invasive gradient &gt; 30 % . At baseline , Handgrip strength test perform angiography instrument arm perform begin end procedure . All patient prospectively followed-up least 30 day adverse event record . During 30-day follow-up visit two independent blind operator evaluate radial artery patency ultrasonography perform handgrip strength test arm patient . According previous study , cumulative occurrence 30-day serious adverse event transfemoral aortic balloon valvuloplasty temporary pacing around 20 % . The half complication attribute femoral access-site temporary pacemaker implantation . We speculate transradial mini-invasive balloon aortic valvuloplasty reduce . Accordingly , validate hypothesis , enroll 204 patient ( alpha 0.05 , power 80 % ) .</detailed_description>
