	<brief_title>APN401 Treating Patients With Recurrent Metastatic Pancreatic Cancer , Colorectal Cancer , Other Solid Tumors That Can Be Removed Surgery</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To determine toxicity establish safety multiple infusion small interfere ribonucleic acid ( siRNA ) -transfected peripheral blood mononuclear cell APN401 ( APN401 ) . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . To determine immunologic effect multiple infusion APN401 . II . To document clinical response survival . OUTLINE : Patients receive siRNA-transfected peripheral blood mononuclear cell APN401 intravenously ( IV ) 30 minute day 1 , 29 , 57 absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . After completion study treatment , patient follow 5 year .</detailed_description>
