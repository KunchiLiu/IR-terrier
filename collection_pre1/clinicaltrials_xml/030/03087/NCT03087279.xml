	<brief_summary>Background : Active learning design pair physical activity teach academic content . This show successful strategy increase physical activity improve academic performance . The exist design confound academic lesson physical activity . As result , impossible determine subsequent improvement academic performance due : ( 1 ) physical activity , ( 2 ) academic content active learning , ( 3 ) combination academic material taught physical activity . Methods / Design : The Texas I-CAN project 3-arm , cluster randomize control trial 28 elementary school assign either control , math intervention , spell intervention . As result , intervention condition serf unrelated content control arm trial , allow impact physical activity separate content . That , school perform active math lesson provide content control spell school spell outcomes . This also calculate direct observation attention behavior control follow period active learning . Discussion : This design unique ability separate impact physical activity , general , combination physical activity specific academic content . This , combination ability examine proximal distal outcome along measure time task much guide design future , school-based intervention .</brief_summary>
