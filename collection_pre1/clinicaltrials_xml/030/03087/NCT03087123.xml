	<brief_summary>Community base intervention acceptable community member participant receive intervention . A 'stepped-wedge ' 'multiple-baseline ' design allow participant receive intervention randomize participant condition define length baseline period . The primary aim pilot study gather data allow researcher estimate parameter , appropriate length baseline period allow power large study . A second key aim determine smartphone intervention deliver parent increase physical activity 6-10 year old inactive child .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Low level physical activity childhood relate obesity risk diabetes cardiovascular disease . This translational study attempt take intervention show effective highly control set implement community . We utilize form single case design ( i.e. , stepped-wedge multiple-baseline design ) , underused , though promising , alternative traditional , parallel-group randomize trial study participant act his/her control . Participants randomize baseline period vary length change study outcome causally attribute introduction intervention . In accordance , family randomize 2 , 4 , 6-week baseline period administer P-Mobile app base intervention . All family receive P-Mobile intervention follow baseline period . The P-Mobile intervention deliver parent via P-Mobile smartphone app ; consist 10 lesson design increase physical activity child . The parent also receive notification design prompt physical activity , motivate , remind parent lesson content . The intervention also utilize adaptive step goal approach , step goal modify base participant 's individual performance . The primary aim study : ( 1 ) To estimate several parameter , allow u redesign study single case design ( conduct simulation-based power calculation ) : ( ) average day-to-day variability daily step baseline period , ( b ) average autocorrelation daily step data , ( c ) average effect size 2 week , 4 week , 6 week introduction intervention . ( 2 ) To test feasibility P-Mobile app ( 3 ) To demonstrate ability recruit participant target neighborhood .</detailed_description>
