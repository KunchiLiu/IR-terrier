	<brief_summary>The purpose investigation ass community-based cohort late-night eater effect coincident food intake endogenous melatonin glycemic control , putative interaction effect melatonin receptor 1B ( MTNR1B ) genetic variation relationship . With result study , investigator expect advance understanding role endogenous melatonin glucose metabolism late night eater carrier MTNR1B risk allele , potential implication guideline mitigate risk type 2 diabetes late night eater carrier MTNR1B risk allele .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Late-night dinner eat associate increased risk type-2-diabetes . The underlie mechanism unclear . One explanatory hypothesis concurrence elevate circulate melatonin high glucose concentration ( characterize late-eating ) lead impaired glucose-tolerance . However , date , study test influence physiological melatonin concentration glucose tolerance . The discovery melatonin receptor MTNR1B diabetes risk gene provide evidence role physiological level melatonin glucose control . The aim current study test hypothesis concurrence meal timing elevate endogenous melatonin concentration result impair glucose control effect strong homozygous MTNR1B risk carrier non-carriers . To test glucose tolerance use identical mixed meal two dinner condition : ) delay dinner Late Eating ( LE ) : starting1 hour usual bed time , b ) advance dinner Early Eating ( EE ) : start 4 hour habitual bed time , randomize , cross-over study design . These finding could support clinical application screen single nucleotide polymorphism ( SNP ) possibility implement tailor cost-effective behavioral intervention prevent type 2 diabetes vulnerable population . These goal achieve specific approach : â€¢ Interventional ( randomize , cross-over controlled trial ) ( Aim 1 ) : To study potential interaction meal timing ( dinner ) genetic variant MTNR1B glucose tolerance .</detailed_description>
