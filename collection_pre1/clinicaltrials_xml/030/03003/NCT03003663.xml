	<brief_title>Interrupted Time-Series Study In-hospital Fall Reduction</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The purpose study determine effect Internet-of-Things bed fall solution use hospital set . The study evaluate SensableCare System reduce bed fall . The SensableCare System use three unit hospital . It turn one month control group turn next month intervention group , repeat sequence study conclude . To well inform data analysis , investigator collect baseline patient characteristic , fall risk score , unit fall rate every month . The SenableCare System : A pressure sensor pad place mattress surface bed sheet . The system let nurse know patient position bed time alert , room number alert generate , informs nurse patient assist . Using predictive algorithm , system also monitor patient position bed send specific , customized alert nurse want know patient begin stir bed , sit bed , attempt leave bed , already bed .

Nurses receive bed leave alert System detect patient attempt leave bed bed . Nurses may also choose receive alert patient stir still &gt; 20 minute and/or patient sit bed . Both nurse nurse aide responsible enrol patient receive alert directly smartphones via real-time push notification . The charge nurse nursing station also receive alert SensableCare app dashboard . Standard medical care : A standard bed fall alarm alarm use standard medical care . The three trial unit two bed fall alarm available high fall risk patient . Those consent study use standard bed fall alarm none . The standard bed fall alarm signal patient exit bed via audible alert . The nurse listen sound go room assist patient .</detailed_description>
