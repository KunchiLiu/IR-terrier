	<brief_summary>This pro- retrospective cohort study evaluate natural history outcome various treatment option patient fistula . At clinical visit parameter describe activity fistula , potential underlie Crohn 's disease , investigation well current treatment enter database . Selected patient also contact phone form structure interview . Data analyze determine treatment outcome , characterize natural history well risk factor complication treatment unfavorable disease course . The data obtain analyzed retrospectively patient visit clinic prior January 2017 .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Zurich Fistula Cohort Study</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Fistulizing disease remain frequent severe problem patient Crohn 's disease ( CD ) . Life-time prevalence fistula patient CD estimate 17 - 50 % [ 1-5 ] cumulative incidence 33 % 50 % 10 year 20 year disease duration , respectively . These number confirm population-based study [ 6 , 7 ] . Patients CD fistula decrease quality life . Reasons include perianal pain , discharge vagina , abdominal wall , perianal region urinary tract infection . Fistula frequently associate abscess formation [ 8 ] . Unfortunately , surgical medical treatment option fistula CD patient remain limited . Treatment tumor-necrosis factor ( TNF ) antibody infliximab remain best medical treatment option available : At least temporary fistula closure observe 55 % treat fistula ( compare 12 % placebo ) . However , treatment success frequently limit short time period 3 month [ 9 , 10 ] : 34 % fistula patient experience recurrent fistula despite therapy [ 6 ] successful treatment limit one third patient . For reason , 82 % fistula need surgical treatment . Surgical option include non-cutting seton , application fibrin glue `` fistula plug '' , ligation intersphincteric fistula tract ( LIFT ) reparative surgery include mucosal advancement flap . However , surgical therapy fistula patient complicate slow wound healing , recurrent disease additional problem [ 11 ] . Combined medical surgical treatment patient fistula CD significantly improve clinical outcome [ 12-15 ] . However , best combination clinical surgical method yet determine [ 16 ] . Open question include time seton removal outcomes various surgical procedure different patient group . At University Hospital Zurich ( USZ ) investigator recently start combined surgical gastroenterological clinic patient fistula . In new clinic patient see gastroenterologist surgeon investigator aim joint treatment decision . Due combination expertise improved access gastroenterological surgical resource investigator expect well treatment result patient improved satisfaction patient refer physician . With current study investigator want achieve follow objective : - Continuous monitoring quality medical surgical treatment - Determining outcome various fistula therapy calculate risk factor favorable unfavorable outcome - Understanding natural history perianal fistula calculate risk factor favorable unfavorable outcome . The investigator therefore propose pro- retrospective database contain data regard clinical history , patient symptom , examination , lab value well parameter . The database use quality management regard daily work USZ improve understand regard treatment option natural history fistula . The investigator expect significant benefit future patient analysis .</detailed_description>
