	<brief_summary>Stroke second common cause death worldwide predominant cause permanent disability among old people . The mouth become unhealthy place stroke , yeasts pathogenic bacteria multiply accelerated rate . Poor oral hygiene result increase dental plaque , gingival bleeding , harbour oral opportunistic pathogen . Dental plaque act reservoir pathogenic microorganism result additional oral health problem also cause life-threatening medical complication ; notably aspiration pneumonia and/or recurrent stroke . The first six month follow stroke particular vulnerable period survive . Removal dental plaque associate pathogenic microorganism challenge compromised state reduce manual dexterity weak state follow stroke . Powered ( electric ) toothbrushes assistance plaque removal frail elder . For resistant oral pathogen , anti-plaque/anti-microbial mouthrinses offer additional help control dental plaque thereby prevent harbour potentially life threaten oral pathogen . Over year Faculty Dentistry Stroke Rehabilitation Unit Department Medicine Hong Kong actively work together address problem oral health associate stroke ; specifically challenge safeguard life health stroke survivor vulnerable rehabilitation period . We propose involve stroke patient out-patient rehabilitation randomize clinical trial test effectiveness power tooth brush chlorhexidine anti-microbial mouthrinse reduce dental plaque accumulation oral pathogen ; affect general oral health status . We anticipate participant benefit oral health promotion initiative advantage long last . We expect demonstrate 'gold standard ' oral health preventive care , part stroke rehabilitation , reduce ( potential reduce ) serious medical complication stroke . If proven effective oral health preventive care regime ( relatively easy implement low cost ) could widely adopt stroke rehabilitation globally .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The study population clinical trial patient moderate severe stroke undergo stroke rehabilitation return regularly Day Rehabilitation Center ( out-patient basis ) Rehabilitation Unit Tung Wah Hospital ( TWH ) . The TWH Rehabilitation Unit , Sheung Wan , Hong Kong select study site serf major urban area Hong Kong . TWH medical teaching hospital , patient medical care standardize comprehensive set record compile stroke rehabilitation . Around 500 patient acute stroke admit annually Rehabilitation Unit . The majority patient stabilize ( 7 day ) Queen Mary Hospital , major teach hospital treat acute medical condition , prior admission Rehabilitation Unit . On admission Rehabilitation Unit , stroke patient undergoes comprehensive medical assessment include functional disability assessment use modify Barthel Index rehabilitation programme formulate . Following hospital discharge , patient require rehabilitation return regularly Day Rehabilitation Center out-patient basis . Stroke patient deem fit discharge Rehabilitation Unit invite participate study accordance inclusion &amp; exclusion criterion . The key outcome variable clinical trial dental plaque level ( key reservoir oral pathogen ) . In previous observational study conduct among stroke survivor , mean PI score 2.1 ( standard deviation [ SD ] =0.51 ) discharge 1.9 ( SD=0.56 ) 6 month , yield change score 0.21 ( SD=0.46 ) . On basis study , propose difference plaque change score least 0.3 baseline follow-up ( also group ) standard deviation set 0.46 , number study subject would require 38 per group , base 80 % power statistical significance level set 0.05 . Anticipating 20 % dropout rate course clinical trial , initial sample size treatment group propose 47 patient per group ( 94 subject total ) . Assessments clinical oral health status , presence oral opportunistic pathogen subjective oral health conduct baseline , 3 month 6 month . All assessment perform TWH Day Rehabilitation Center . Compliance also assess . Data store computer ( backed compact disc ) Faculty Dentistry , The University Hong Kong . Professor Colman McGrath ( Principle Investigator ) responsible safekeeping . All data keep analysis perform research manuscript accept publication . The data destroyed . The statistic software package SPSS 21 Windows ( SPSS Inc. , Chicago , USA ) STATA 13.0 Windows ( IBM ) use statistical test . Both per-protocol ( PP ) intention-to-treat ( ITT ) analyse employed primary secondary outcome . In bivariate analysis , within group comparison make clinical trial period . When outcome variable continuous follow normal distribution , pair test relate sample perform determine significant difference time . Student t-test independent sample perform compare mean outcome intervention group baseline follow-up review . When outcome variable continuous follow normal distribution detect normality test , Wilcoxon Signed Rank test ( non-parametric equivalence pair test related sample ) perform determine significant difference time . Mann Whitney U test ( non-parametric equivalence test independent sample ) employ compare difference rank outcome intervention group baseline follow-up . When outcome variable categorical , McNemar test perform identify change prevalence time Chi-square test employ compare variation prevalence intervention group baseline follow . Regression analyse employed address effect potential explanatory factor outcomes . When conduct regression analysis , method Last Observation Carried Forward ( LOCF ) employ deal miss outcome follow-up review . Linear regression adopt dependent variable continuous residual regression follow normal distribution . Negative binomial regression adopt continuous dependent variable over-dispersed count data . Logistic regression adopt dependent variable binary . Since effect intervention outcomes core interest , model fit adopt forward-wald method factor intervention fix model one explanatory factor add model time . Each time coefficient independent variable smallest significant p value ( significance level p &lt; 0.05 ) enter regression model . The model fit process repeat independent variable significant p value .</detailed_description>
