	<brief_summary>Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease ( COPD ) common , long term condition lung usually cause cigarette smoking . In addition daily symptom limitation activity , patient prone develop chest infection call 'exacerbations ' . Exacerbations big problem : unpleasant patient , sometimes severe enough cause hospital admission ( therefore health facility pressure ) death . Reducing impact exacerbation important . We previously show earlier treatment COPD exacerbation result faster recovery , reduce chance hospital admission . Helping patient detect exacerbation early therefore important . We also recently show monitoring heart rate oxygen saturation via finger probe may assist . However , measure variable patient awake mean affected thing , exercise anxiety . Our new idea measure heart rate oxygen level overnight , patient asleep , give best chance detect COPD exacerbation early study test . We randomly allocate 64 patient COPD recruit service London standard monitoring , overnight monitoring , six month first exacerbation , whichever sooner . We analyse whether overnight monitoring able detect exacerbation earlier , therefore could use help patient get treatment earlier . A subset participant also wear activity monitor overnight first two week , assess effect ( ) overnight awake period ( trip bathroom ) heart rate saturation recording .</brief_summary>
