	<detailed_description>This project compare effectiveness innovative community-based cognitive-behavioral Executive Functioning ( EF ) treatment , Unstuck On Target ( UOT ) current standard care , Contingency Behavioral Management ( CBM ) program typically underserved child ASD ADHD . Minimizing impact EF deficits pediatric disorder broad public health implication , provide opportunity improvement real-world , long-term outcome stakeholder tell u important : educational vocational success , functional independence improved Activities Daily Living skill , well physical health , reduce morbidity mortality . The health disparity project address poor outcome limit treatment choice associate child low-income family also ADHD ASD . The research question : 1 . Which work well low-income child ASD , UOT CBM ? Researchers test comparative effectiveness UOT CBM treatments low-income child ASD . Hypothesis 1 : UOT effective child ASD CBM treatment equal intensity improve cognitive problem-solving ( WASI Block Design ( BD ) ) , real-world executive functioning ( BRIEF Shift Plan/Org , class observation Transitions Follows Directions , Challenge Task Plan/org , Flexibility score ) , self-regulation ( BRIEF Emotional Control CBCL Affective Problems score ) , few non-routine medical visit ( service use ) equal CBM improve behavior cop skill ( classroom observation Negativity Participation score CBCL Aggression score ) 2 . Which work well low-income child ADHD , UOT CBM ? Researchers test comparative effectiveness UOT CBM low-income child ADHD , new patient population UOT . Hypothesis 2 : UOT effective child ADHD CBM treatment equal intensity improve executive functioning , cognitive problem-solving , equal CBM improve behavior cop skill . 3 . Are effect UOT CBM sustain 9-12 month treatment ? Researchers ass whether benefit ascribe intervention maintain year treatment complete . Hypothesis 3 : Improvements cognitive ability , EF , problem solve behavior regulation maintain year follow treatment UOT child , gain behavior cop skill see CBM fade treatment end . Patients ASD ADHD recruit study school system . Half receive UOT half receive CBM . Researchers recruit interest Title 1 school serve different diverse population . Recruitment occur several stage . Specifically , school district invite individual school participate trial sufficient number qualify child . Interested school contact family provide information study . Interested family initiate contact study staff , individual school enter study three patient whose family contact study staff . Children schedule cognitive/diagnostic evaluation . Recruitment continue target enrollment reach , remain interested family enrol school include . Subjects appropriate assent consent evaluate eligibility school randomly assign treatment condition . Cognitive problem-solving ability , flexibility , plan organize , self-regulation , behavior problem , cop skill , child 's use non-routine urgent medical care measure treatment multi-method , multi-informant format , include parent/teacher report , blind classroom observation blind direct child measure . Researchers choose measure great relevance functional outcome `` real world '' function . Rather define single outcome , researcher choose multiple outcome variable , anticipate differential impact treatment modality outcome domain . All measure observation gather pre- post-treatment time-points treatment year . Data analyze use Statistical Package Social Sciences ( SPSS ) v20 R. A comparison baseline characteristic perform treatment group assess randomization successful . The characteristic include demographic well direct child assessment behavioral scale . These comparison perform use standard statistical method , t-tests continuous variable ( exact ) chi-squares dichotomous variable . If characteristic unbalanced treatment , possible sample size , secondary analysis adjust characteristic . Analysis Specific Aim 1- Which work well low-income child ASD , UOT CBM ? To test comparative effectiveness UOT CBM treatment 50 low-income child ASD . RER analysis use determine effect treatment change score primary outcome . This analysis also uncover significant covariates , examine pairwise comparison . Effect size calculate compare effect size obtain previous trial UOT ASD child middle-income family . Finally , RCI calculate provide easy interpret guide family clinicians use make choice among treatment . Analysis Specific Aim 2- Which work well low income child ADHD , UOT CBM ? To test comparative effectiveness UOT CBM 100 low-income child ADHD , analyse proceed describe , except effect size child ADHD compare effect size obtain child ASD Specific Aim 1 . Analysis Specific Aim 3- Are effect UOT CBM sustain year treatment ? To assess whether treatment benefit maintain year treatment , RER analyse repeat additional time-point include patient multiple post test assessment .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>We recruit child refer teacher staff school concern flexibility ( rather respond advertisement ) , `` real world '' group child test effectiveness treatment . We participant symptoms ASD ADHD , receive combination mainstream special education support , qualify attend pullout group school . All school involve eligible Title 1 governmental support , indicate child primarily lowincome community , although require participant 's family meet income cutoff . The school system include : KIPP DC Charter school , Latin American Montessori Bilingual ( LAMB ) Charter Schools , Arlington County Public Schools , Fairfax County Public Schools . Potential participant evaluate individually include study achieve Full Scale IQ score &gt; 70 , verbal mental age &gt; 6 year old , meet DSMIVTR criterion either Pervasive Developmental Disorder ADHD . IQ verbal mental age measure Wechsler Abbreviated Scale Intelligence ( WASI ) Verbal , Performance Full Scale IQ score ( represent Standard Scores : mean=100 ; SD=15 ) . Higher score indicate good performance . To evaluate ASD , researchvalid clinical psychologist administer Autism Diagnostic Observation Schedule , Second Edition Module 3 ( ADOS2 ) , gold standard structure play/conversational interview elicits symptom ASD . It produce nonstandardized raw score ; high score indicate symptom . To include study , child must obtain ADOS diagnostic algorithm &gt; 'ASD ' threshold parent ask complete Social Communication Questionnaire ( SCQ ) . In order include full autism spectrum , criterion relatively inclusive . To confirm diagnosis ADHD , parent complete ADHD portion MINIKid ADHD interview train interviewer , child must meet DSMIV criterion Attention Disorder . We include child observable symptom one three setting . All child refer study teacher staff school observe symptom . Thus child either meet criterion MINIKid interview train clinician complete test observed symptom , , child include study . Subjects exclude study diagnosis bipolar disorder , schizophrenia , major depression currently prevent participate classroom activity . Students anxiety , mild depression , obsessivecompulsive disorder problem prevent participate majority classroom activity exclude . We determine excluded twostage process . First , subject screen comorbid symptom use Child Behavior Checklist ( CBCL ) . The CBCL 618 year old 118 item describe specific behavioral emotional problem . Parents rate child true item within past 6 month . One PIs , license psychologist active clinical practice , followup child 's teacher child score T score 75 six DSMoriented scale Attention Deficit/Hyperactivity Problems ( Affective Problems ; Anxiety Problems ; Somatic Problems ; Oppositional Defiant Problems ; Conduct Problems ) . We ask teacher target question determine degree identify symptom interfere child 's ability participate classroom activity treatment group `` Do feel child participate classroom activity ? If , ? Can listen follow write verbal instruction ? Can participate activity child give structure support ? '' Note use Achenbach Teacher Report Form instead CBCL aim qualify subject September , teacher may know child well enough answer question ( TRF ask teacher rate child 's behavior past two month ) . However , school program partner study use inclusion model , student mainstream classroom unlikely meet</criteria>
