	<brief_summary>Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease ( COPD ) common smoking-related lung disease . Patients COPD increase risk develop cardiovascular disease heart attack stroke . A simple measurement call arterial stiffness good assessment likely people cardiovascular disease , healthy population COPD . Aortic Pulse wave velocity ( aPWV ) measure arterial stiffness , Pulmonary Rehabilitation ( PR ) - 6 week supervise group exercise education class - effective intervention COPD reduce symptom , improve exercise performance prevent exacerbation . However , effect PR cardiovascular risk COPD controversial two small positive study suggest benefit one large study . Investigators recently show cardiovascular risk high COPD patient get infection ( exacerbation ) . PR effective intervention prevent COPD exacerbation . Logically , exercise component would expect reduce cardiovascular risk . Investigators want identify patient COPD get cardiovascular benefit PR programme others . Investigators propose measure aPWV PR . Investigators classify participant responder non-responders define presence absence significant improvement aPWV . Investigators collect demographic clinical information include daily physical activity level effective PR enable investigator identify characteristic patient , achieve cardiovascular risk reduction response PR COPD . This inform well design PR program people live COPD .</brief_summary>
