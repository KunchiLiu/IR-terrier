	<detailed_description>Conventional nasotracheal intubation technique ( `` Conventional Videolaryngoscopic Techniques , '' CVT ) know associated significant trauma patient 's naris endotracheal tube . The investigator propose alternative technique ( Nasotracheal intubation bougie place via subsequently remove nasal trumpet , NIB ) involve use Seldinger technique bougie place via nasal trumpet promise less traumatic patient endotracheal tube , also take less time perform high first-attempt success rate conventional method . The investigator propose randomize prospective interventional study compare new technique conventional technique see significant difference exists .</detailed_description>
