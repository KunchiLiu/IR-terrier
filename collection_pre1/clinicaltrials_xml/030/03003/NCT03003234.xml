	<brief_summary>Functional dyspepsia ( FD ) extremely common disorder gastrointestinal function . Recently , impair duodenal mucosal integrity report potential pathophysiological mechanism FD . However , factor control duodenal mucosal integrity remain unknown . In study , evaluate whether luminal bile salt content could play role impaired duodenal permeability FD . Duodenal biopsy obtain 25 healthy volunteer ( HV ) 25 FD patient . Biopsies mount Ussing chamber measure transepithelial resistance ( TEER ) paracellular permeability use fluorescein isothiocyanate dextran ( FITC-dx4 , MW 4kDa ) . Expression bile acid-sensing receptor ( TGR5 , VDR , PXR , FXR CAR ) duodenal biopsy measure western blot real time RT-PCR . Immunohistochemistry use evaluate eosinophil mastcell infiltration duodenal biopsy FD patient HV . Duodenal fluid aspirate collect fixed time point 1 hour fast state 1.5 hour liquid meal ( Nutridrink , 200ml ) . Concentration composition bile salt pool ( include glycocholic acid ( GC ) , taurocholic acid ( TC ) , glycochenodeoxycholic acid ( GCDC ) , taurochenodeoxycholic acid ( TCDC ) , glycodeoxycholic acid ( GDC ) , taurodeoxycholic acid ( TDC ) , glycoursodeoxycholic acid ( GUDC ) tauroursodeoxycholic acid ( TUDC ) ) aspirate evaluated liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry-selected ion monitoring analysis ( LC-MS/MS ) .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Association Between Luminal Bile Salt Content Duodenal Mucosal Integrity Functional Dyspepsia</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The Rome III criterion define functional dyspepsia ( FD ) presence symptom think originate gastroduodenal region , absence organic , systemic metabolic disease readily explain complaint . FD extremely common , affect 15-20 % population associate significantly decrease quality life substantial healthcare cost . The available treatment option FD limit effectiveness , reflect poorly understood pathogenesis . Studies indicate FD heterogeneous disorder , different pathophysiological mechanism underlie specific symptom pattern . Traditionally , gastric abnormality impair accommodation , delay empty hypersensitivity believe involved pathophysiology FD . More recent study suggest also number duodenal abnormality responsible generation symptom , like increase sensitivity duodenal acid , increased sensitivity duodenal lipid low-grade mucosal inflammation . The investigator recently show FD patient display impaired duodenal mucosal integrity . The trigger increase permeability unknown , possible increase exposure duodenal bile acid alter composition bile acid lead impairment intestinal barrier . This sustained enhancement paracellular permeability could facilitate constant passage luminal antigen mucosa lead local mucosal immune response manifest inflammation finally result generation dyspeptic symptom . The investigator hypothesize increased duodenal bile acid exposure change composition bile acid lead impaired duodenal mucosal integrity FD , allow luminal substance pass mucosa result immune response finally dyspeptic symptom generation . The general aim project assess FD patient display increase endogenous duodenal bile acid exposure different bile acid composition . In addition , test whether duodenal mucosal permeability FD patient endogenous duodenal bile acid exposure normal range alter bile acid composition high FD patient normal endogenous duodenal acid exposure composition . Participants expect department endoscopy UZ Gasthuisberg fast overnight . Before study , ask fill bundle questionnaire concern physical complaint , depression , anxiety ( disturbance ) , pain/disease , body/interoceptive awareness , trauma/abuse personality . Gastroduodenoscopy perform experienced endoscopist ( Jan Tack ) . Hereby , 12 duodenal biopsy ( 2 biopsy time ) ( Radial Jaw™3 needle ; outside diameter 2.2mm ; Boston Scientific , 302 Parkway , Global Park , Heredia , Costa Rica ) obtain . To measure vitro transepithelial resistance , 4 biopsy examine use adapt mini-Ussing chamber system . After equilibration , mucosal side tissue expose 4kDa FITC-dextran measure paracellular permeability . A sample take serosal side 2h 30min interval . The concentration fluorescein measure use fluorescence plate reader . Also , 2 biopsy use mRNA extraction subsequent cDNA synthesis . This cDNA use measure gene expression cell-to-cell adhesion proteins acid-sensing receptor mean real-time PCR . In addition , 2 biopsy prepare immunofluorescence immunohistochemistry 2 used western blot measure change distribution/expression cell-to-cell adhesion protein bile acid-sensitive receptor . Two biopsy obtain study ultrastructural alteration transmission electron microscopy . After recovery , catheter introduce second duodenum via nose position catheter check fluoroscopically . This catheter allow collection intestinal fluid mean syringe collect duodenal fluid aspirate characterization bile acid composition sample ( 8 ) . After 30 minute , participant give specified amount water ( 250 mL ) ( fast state ) another 30 minute later nutritional drink ( fed state ) . Intestinal fluid sample every 15 min period 1 h liquid meal intake 90 minute liquid meal intake . So , total collection period , 7 fraction feed state 4 fraction fast state obtain per participant time frame 2 hour half . The composition bile acid intestinal sample determine GC-MS-selected ion monitoring analysis .</detailed_description>
