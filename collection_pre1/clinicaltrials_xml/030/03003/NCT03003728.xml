	<brief_summary>This study evaluate ability Expanded Natural Killer ( ENK ) cell treat multiple myeloma administer part regimen consist Elotuzumab stem cell transplant . Natural killer cell special type white blood cell already present body ability kill myeloma cell . In study , natural killer cell collect treated laboratory activate 'expand ' number cell increase dose anti-myeloma activity cell transfuse back subject . Elotuzumab protein drug approve United States Food Drug Administration ( FDA ) patient previously treat multiple myeloma work activate natural killer cell already present body target protein call SLAMF7 present natural killer cell myeloma cell . The investigator hope administer Elotuzumab combination ENK cell enhance anti-myeloma activity ENK cell .</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Multiple myeloma patient complete induction chemotherapy peripheral blood stem cell collection ( PBSC ) preparation ASCT . Patients must highrisk disease define Gene Expression Profiling ( GEP ) 70 risk score ≥ 0.66 GEP 80 gene score ≥ 2.48 metaphase cytogenetic abnormality lactate dehydrogenase ( LDH ) ≥ 360 U/L ( Rule hemolysis , infection contact PI clarification doubt ) . Patients must fail prior treatment multiple myeloma ( MM ) include proteasome inhibitor immunomodulatory drug ( socalled 'double refractory ' ) . Patients receive prior salvage combination chemotherapy failure proteasome inhibitor immunomodulatory drug eligible ( frank relapse time enrollment require ) Zubrod ≤ 2 , unless solely due symptom MMrelated ( bone ) disease . Patients must platelet count ≥ 20,000/μL within 30 day enrollment , unless low level explain extensive bone marrow plasmacytosis extensive prior therapy . Patients must least 18 year age old 75 year age time registration . must preserve renal function define serum creatinine level ≤ 3 mg/dL within 30 day registration . Participants must ejection fraction echocardiogram ( ECHO ) multigated acquisition ( MUGA ) scan ≥ 40 % within 90 day prior registration . Patients must adequate pulmonary function study ≥ 50 % predict mechanical aspect diffusion capacity ( DLCO ) ≥ 50 % predict within 90 day prior registration . If patient unable complete pulmonary function test due MMrelated pain condition , exception may grant principal investigator document patient candidate highdose therapy . Patients must least 2x106 CD34+ cells/kg store transplant . In addition , 'backup ' available 2x106 CD34+ cells/kg2x106 CD34+ cells/kg Patients must sign Institutional Review Boardapproved inform consent HIPAA authorization form . Prior allotransplant . Prior autotransplantation permit provided patient still presently transplant candidate least 2 month pass since last autotransplant History poorlycontrolled hypertension , diabetes mellitus , serious medical illness psychiatric illness could potentially interfere completion treatment accord protocol could consider exclusion criterion deem PI . Patients must prior malignancy , except adequatelytreated basal cell squamous cell skin cancer , situ cervical cancer , cancer patient receive treatment one year prior enrollment . Other cancer acceptable patient 's life expectancy exceed three year determine PI . Pregnant nursing woman may participate .
