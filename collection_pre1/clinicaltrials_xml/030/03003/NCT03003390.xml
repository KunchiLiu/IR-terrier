	<brief_title>Catheter-Related Early Thromboprophylaxis With Enoxaparin ( CRETE ) Trial</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Critical illness presence central venous catheter ( CVC ) important risk factor deep venous thrombosis ( DVT ) child . Catheter-associated thrombosis ( CADVT ) highly prevalent associate poor outcome critically ill child . Yet , base underpowered pediatric trial , prophylaxis CADVT recommend child . The recommendation provide prophylaxis thrombosis critically ill adult apply child hemostatic system co-morbidities vastly differ age group . Pivotal trial urgently need determine whether prophylaxis prevent CADVT complication critically ill child . However , time extent reduction thrombin generation , biochemical goal prophylaxis , need prevent CADVT child unclear . The goal application explore efficacy early prophylaxis CADVT critically ill child . Aim 1 obtain preliminary evidence effect early prophylaxis incidence CADVT critically ill child . Based natural history CADVT , hypothesize among critically ill child , prophylaxis administer &lt; 24 hour catheter insertion decrease incidence ultrasound-diagnosed CADVT compare prophylaxis . In single arm phase 2a trial , child admit intensive care unit newly insert central venous catheter receive enoxaparin adjust accord anti-Xa activity . Enoxaparin become `` standard '' pediatric anticoagulant prophylaxis despite absence conclusive data . We use Bayesian approach determine whether trial warrant . Aim 2 evaluate effect anti-Xa activity-directed prophylactic strategy thrombin generation critically ill child . We hypothesize among critically ill child , enoxaparin dose accord anti-Xa activity reduces thrombin generation , measure endogenous thrombin potential . Endogenous thrombin potential best available measure thrombin generation . We measure endogenous thrombin potential anti-Xa activity multiple time point examine relationship child enrol phase 2a trial . The propose research challenge current paradigm prophylaxis CADVT child . High quality evidence need prevent CADVT complication vulnerable population .</detailed_description>
