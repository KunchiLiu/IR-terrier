	<brief_title>A Comparison Two Socket Sealing Collagen Matrices Extraction Socket Management</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>A prospective , randomize , multi-center , control clinical study intact extraction ( bony dehiscence &lt; 1/3 socket apico-coronal mesial-distal dimension ) delay implant placement . Study objective : compare extraction socket management effectiveness office economics frequently use wound dress ( control ) soft tissue augmentation matrix ( test ) 32-64 subject 18 -75 year age intact ( bony dehiscence , present , &lt; 1/3 socket dimension ) extraction intend dental implant replacement . Following screen subject undergo tooth extraction randomization either control test therapy . After treatment , subject follow 4- month , time implant placement . Primary outcome : soft tissue wound heal measure ( 1 ) gap closure ( 2 ) graft containment time point .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Subject indicate anterior tooth extraction ( premolar forward ) intend implant placement . Subjects essentially intact extraction socket bony dehiscence &lt; 1/3 depth socket mesialdistal width tooth socket Subjects read , understood sign institutional review board ( IRB ) approve Informed Consent Form ( ICF ) . Subjects must able willing follow study procedure instruction Subjects heal disorder ( i.e. , diabetes mellitus , cancer , HIV , bone metabolic disease ) could compromise wound heal and/ preclude implant surgery ; currently receive receive within two month prior study entry , systemic corticosteroid , immunosuppressive agent , radiation therapy , and/or chemotherapy could compromise wound heal preclude periodontal surgery . Subjects take intramuscular intravenous bisphosphonates . Subjects know allergy sensitivity collagen . Subjects acute , suppurative lesion pain , swell apical lesion &gt; 5mm exclude , though antibiotic prophylaxis may employ reduce infection provide possible subject reconsideration inclusion . Heavy smokers/tobacco user define smoke ≥ 10 cigarette ≥ 4 cigar ≥ 4 pipe per day . For nonheavy smoker , smoke ≥ 10 cigarette ≥ 4 cigar ≥ 4 pipe per day prohibit duration study . Female subject pregnant lactating , intend become pregnant study duration Subjects participate clinical study involve therapeutic intervention ( either medical dental ) .
