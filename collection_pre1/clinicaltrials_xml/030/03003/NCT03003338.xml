	<brief_summary>This 1:1 randomize double-blind Placebo-controlled moncenter Phase IV study investigate whether successful interferon-free treatment HCV-infection ombitasvir/paritaprevir/ritonavir ( OBV/PTV/r ) combination dasabuvir ( DSV ) improve patient ' attention ability compare placebo measure Att Test Sum Score change baseline week 12 . A total 30 patient non-cirrhotic genotype 1b HCV infection randomly assign receive 12 week verum follow 12 week Placebo ( arm A ) versus 12 week Placebo follow 12 week verum ( arm B ) .
