	<brief_title>Pembrolizumab + Imprime PGG Metastatic Non-small Cell Lung Cancer After Progression First-Line Chemotherapy : Big Ten Cancer Research Consortium BTCRC-LUN15-017</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OUTLINE : This multi-center study . The phase Ib dose escalation evaluate combination pembrolizumab Imprime PGG subject metastatic non-small cell lung cancer ( NSCLC ) progression first-line platinum-based chemotherapy . The phase II trial test whether addition Imprime PGG pembrolizumab increase median progression-free survival ( PFS ) second line therapy set NSCLC . PHASE Ib DOSE ESCALATION INVESTIGATIONAL TREATMENT : Cohort 1 consist 3-6 patient receive - Imprime PGG 2 mg/kg IV Days 1 , 8 , 15 - Pembrolizumab 200 mg IV Day 1 ( cycle = 21 day ) Cohort 2 consist 3-6 patient receive - Imprime PGG 4 mg/kg IV Days 1 , 8 , 15 - Pembrolizumab 200 mg IV Day 1 ( cycle = 21 day ) If none 3 subject experience dose limit toxicity ( DLT ) first cycle therapy , additional three subject enrol dose level 2 . If subject dose level 2 complete first cycle therapy without DLT , 3 subject enrol dose level 2 ensure 0-1 6 subject DLT . There escalation beyond dose level 2 . PHASE II INVESTIGATIONAL TREATMENT : Pembrolizumab give Day 1 21 day cycle Imprime PGG , RP2D dose Imprime PGG give Days 1 , 8 15 21 day cycle . Treatment continue 16 cycle , disease progression , unacceptable toxicity , subject refusal , subject death either progression disease , therapy , cause . Life expectancy : 6 month great The following baseline lab must complete within 28 day prior registration protocol therapy : Hepatic : - total bilirubin ≤ 1.5 × upper limit normal ( ULN ) OR direct bilirubin ≤ ULN subject total bilirubin level &gt; 1.5 x ULN ( except subject Gilbert 's Syndrome , total bilirubin &lt; 3.0 mg/dl ) - aspartate aminotransferase ( AST ) ≤ 2.5 × ULN ≤ 5 × ULN subject know hepatic metastasis - alanine aminotransferase ( ALT ) ≤ 2.5 × ULN ≤ 5 × ULN subject know hepatic metastasis Renal : - Serum creatinine ≤ 3 mg/dL OR - serum creatinine &gt; 3mg/dL , estimate glomerular filtration rate ( GFR ) ≥ 20 mL/min Hematopoietic : - hemoglobin ≥ 9 g/dL , subject require transfusion eligible start study - absolute neutrophil count ( ANC ) ≥ 1.5 × 10^9/L - platelet count ≥ 100 × 10^9/L Coagulation : - INR &lt; 1.5 × ULN OR - subject receive anticoagulant , subject must , investigator 's opinion , clinically stable evidence active bleeding receive anticoagulant therapy . The INR subject warfarin therapeutic range . Low molecular weight heparin ( LMWH ) allow .</detailed_description>
