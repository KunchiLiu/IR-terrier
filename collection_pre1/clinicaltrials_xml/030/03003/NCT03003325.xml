	<brief_summary>The Low-PV study multicenter , phase II , randomize trial aim ass whether addition Pegylated Proline-interferon-alpha-2b best therapeutic current strategy available base phlebotomy low dose acetylsalicylic acid ( ASA ) could improve efficacy treatment patient PV low risk thrombosis ( young 60 year without prior vascular event ) , term control recommend level hematocrit &lt; 45 % , period 12 month .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>The Benefit/Risk Profile AOP2014 Low-risk Patients With PV</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>It independent , investigator-generated , pragmatic trial include adult PV patient ( age 18-60 ) diagnose accord World Health Organization 2008 criterion within last 3 year inclusion , without history thrombosis young 60 year ( 'low risk ' patient ) . Eligible patient randomize treated best available therapy ( recommend risk class , standard arm ) base phlebotomy include administration low-dose ( 100 mg/daily ) acetylsalicylic acid ( ASA , contraindication ) OR Pegylated Proline-Interferon alpha-2b ( AOP2014 ) every 2 week addition recommend available regimen ( experimental arm ) , 12 month . The allocation patient study arm 1:1 stratification randomization perform accord age category ( &lt; 50 year old &gt; 50 year old ) time diagnosis ( naϊve non-naϊve ) . Naive patient define new case come observation , diagnose first time study entry never treat ; non-naive patient old case ( diagnosis old 3 year study entry ) undergo therapy phlebotomy and/or low dos ASA . Primary endpoint ( PEp ) define proportion ( % ) patient maintain median value hematocrit ( HCT ) 45 % 12 month treatment arm , without progression disease need extra-protocol cytoreductive drug ( responder patient ) . Secondary endpoint include evaluation hematological molecular response , histological remission safety profile protocol therapy . Before randomization patient undergo phlebotomy order reach HCT 45 % . After randomization , accord current common clinical practice regimen phlebotomy must select accordingly maintain recommended level HCT &lt; 45 % . Once normalization HCT achieve , blood count regular interval ( every 4 week ) establish frequency future phlebotomy . Sufficient blood recommend removed order maintain hematocrit 45 % . Supplemental iron therapy administer . All patient receive low-dose ASA ( 100 mg/daily ) recommend current guideline low-risk subject PV . Patients allocate experimental group receive addition pre-filled auto-injection pen subcutaneous auto-administration ( abdominal skin thigh ) 100 µg Pegylated Proline-Interferon alpha-2b ( AOP2014 ) every 14 day . Patient visit schedule every month ( 4 week ) 12 month assess perform reliable calculation primary end-point ( % patient median HCT level &lt; 45 % ) . At monthly visit pre-filled auto-injection pen deliver patient randomize experimental arm . Assuming expect drop-out rate 12 % , total sample size 150 patient ( 75 randomize group ) randomize reject null hypothesis proportion patient achieve primary endpoint 50 % favor alternative hypothesis proportion 75 % AOP2014 add phlebotomy based- therapy , power 80 % alpha error 0.05 ( two-tailed ) . The primary endpoint assessment perform completion first 12 month therapy subject enrol ( 'core study ' ) . A period 12 month expect completion enrolment / randomization phase . The 'core study ' take 12 month treatment per patient . Based result 'core study ' extension phase continue follow : 1 . After 12 month patient meet primary endpoint follow either conventional experimental therapy enter extension phase remain current regimen . 2. non-responders , meet primary endpoint 12 month conventional therapy switch experimental treatment . 3. non-responder , meet primary endpoint 12 month experimental therapy switch conventional treatment . This extension phase last another 12 month Last Visit Last Patient include ( LVLP ) core study ( match case 1 2 define ) . Based , overall length study expect cover period 36 month First Patient Included ( FPI ) .</detailed_description>
