	<brief_summary>This phase IB/II trial examine feasibility safety checkpoint blockade ( aPD1 without aCTLA4 ) neoadjuvant standard care ( SOC ) advance stage head neck squamous cell carcinoma ( HNSCC ) , patient population need improve clinical outcome tumor likely respond neoadjuvant aPD1 aCTLA4 . In addition , research protocol potential impact intratumoral hypoxia tumor infiltrate lymphocyte ( TIL ) abundance , differentiation effector function assess , potentially divergent effect T cell checkpoint blockade area hypoxia normoxia .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The phase Ib design 3 + 3 , primary objective feasibility toxicity . Of Note : endpoint must reach 6 patient cohort 1 2 , start next cohort . The phase II design single arm design primary endpoint efficacy . In phase Ib , two cohort use ( cohort 1 : nivolumab cohort 2 : nivolumab ipilimumab neoadjuvant surgery ) define neoadjuvant immunotherapy regimen take towards expansion cohort 3 . Thirty-two patient treat nivolumab ( 240 mg flat dose , week 1 week 3 , twice total ) single agent OR combination ipilimumab ( 1 mg/kg ) + nivolumab ( 240mg flat dose ) week 1 , nivolumab 240mg flat dose week 3 , neoadjuvant SOC ( surgery without adjuvant ( C ) RT ) .</detailed_description>

Performance Status ECOG 0 1 No immunosuppressive medication within 6 month prior study inclusion Screening laboratory value must meet following criterion : WBC ≥ 2.0x109/L , Neutrophils ≥ 1.5x109/L , Platelets ≥ 100 x109/L , Hemoglobin ≥ 5.5 mmol/L , Creatinine ≤ 1.5x ULN , AST ≤ 3 x ULN , ALT ≤ 3 x ULN , Total Bilirubin ≤1.5 X ULN ( except subject Gilbert Syndrome , total bilirubin &lt; 3.0 mg/dL ) No harddrug abuse . Women childbearing potential ( WOCBP ) must use appropriate method ( ) contraception . WOCBP use adequate method avoid pregnancy 23 week ( 30 day plus time require nivolumab undergo five halflives last dose investigational drug . Women childbearing potential must negative serum urine pregnancy test ( minimum sensitivity 25 IU/L equivalent unit HCG ) within 24 hour prior start nivolumab w/wo ipilimumab . Men sexually active WOCBP must use contraceptive method failure rate le 1 % per year Men receive nivolumab w/wo ipilimumab sexually active WOCBP instruct adhere contraception period 31 week last dose investigational product . Women childbearing potential ( i.e. , postmenopausal surgically sterile ) well azoospermic men require contraception . All subject must sign date write informed consent . Distant metastasis Active , know suspected autoimmune disease . Subjects permit enroll vitiligo , type I diabetes mellitus , residual hypothyroidism due autoimmune condition require hormone replacement , psoriasis require systemic treatment , condition expect recur absence external trigger . Patients exclude condition require systemic treatment either corticosteroid ( &gt; 10 mg daily prednisone equivalent ) immunosuppressive medication within 14 day study drug administration . Inhaled topical corticosteroid adrenal replacement dos &gt; 10 mg daily prednisone equivalent permit absence active autoimmune disease . Prior systemic treatment antiPD1 , antiPDL1 , antiPDL2 , antiCTLA4 antibody , antibody drug specifically target Tcell costimulation immune checkpoint pathway ; Patients exclude positive test hepatitis B virus surface antigen ( HBV sAg ) hepatitis C virus ribonucleic acid ( HCV antibody ) indicate acute chronic infection ; Patients exclude known history test positive human immunodeficiency virus ( HIV ) know acquired immunodeficiency syndrome ( AIDS ) ; Allergies Adverse Drug Reaction : history allergy study drug component , history severe hypersensitivity reaction monoclonal antibody . Underlying medical condition , Investigator 's opinion , make administration study drug hazardous obscure interpretation toxicity determination adverse event ; Concurrent medical condition require use immunosuppressive medication , immunosuppressive dos systemic absorbable topical corticosteroid ; Use investigational drug study drug administration 30 day 5 half time study inclusion ; Pregnant nursing . As potential hepatic toxicity nivolumab nivolumab/ipilimumab combination , drug predisposition hepatotoxicity use caution patient treat nivolumabcontaining regimen . In patient contraindication cisplatin chemotherapy , Cetuximab might use radiosensitizer radiotherapy adjuvant treatment deem necessary .</criteria>
