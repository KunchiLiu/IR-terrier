	<brief_title>Prevalence Pediatric Urolithiasis Kashgar Area Xinjiang China</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Background : Urolithiasis child painful costly disease may also detrimental long-term effect kidney function . Although urolithiasis rarely find pediatric population , several study indicate incidence inpatient hospitalization rate sharply increase . The incidence nephrolithiasis child age 18 year South Carolina 18.5 per 100,000 child 2007 , much high 7.9 per 100,000 1996 . Data Iceland reveal incidence 5.6 per 100,000 child age 0 18 year basis 26 new diagnosis renal stone 6-year period among national population approximately 78,000 child . The composition analysis stone child reveal calcium stone common one , account 72 % 88 % , uric acid stone account 2 % 3 % infective stone ( included ammonium acid urate magnesium ammonium phosphate ) rare . Kashgar area lie southwest Xinjiang province China , climate less annual rainfall , long hour sunshine , high temperature dry air . The population Kashgar area 4 million Uighur resident account 90 % .Pediatirc urolithiasis common disease Kashgar area . From August 2014 July 2016 , 708 pediatric patient urolithiasis treat department urology First People 's Hospital Kashgar area central hospital . The stone analysis pediatric patient infrared spectroscopy indicated ammonium acid urate account 66 % , magnesium ammonium phosphate account 2.5 % , uric acid account 11 % , calcium stone account 19 % ( data publish ) .This different previous study . So wonder urolithiasis maybe common disease among child Kashgar area , even south Xinjiang province . And maybe special reason pediatric urolithiasis formation area . Methods Study design participant : A cross-sectional survey carry among child age 0 14 year Kashgar area China . Before design study , conduct pre-survey village 418 child randomness cluster select Kashgar area . And ten child find urinary stone ultrasonography . So estimate prevalence pediatric urolithiasis ( p ) area 2.4 % ( 10/418 ) , α 0.05 , margin error le 0.5 % , 3599 child would need formula sample size caculation.Consider relative sampling error 10 % , predict 20 % refusal rate , least 4751 target child need study . Randomization : A two-stage clustered random sample method use select representative sample child across Kashgar area . The sample process initially stratify 12 region Kashgar area ( Kashi , Taxian , Shule , Zhepu , Yuepu , Bachu , Maigaiti , Yuecheng , Jiashi , Shufu , Shache , Yingjisha ) descend order Gross Domestic Product ( GDP ) 2014 . The first tier select two region simple random sample first six region last six region separately . Then select region stratify degree urbanization ( urban area v rural area ) , one community urban area one village rural area select randomization . At last four community urban area four village rural area select across Kashgar area . Children age 0 to14 year select community village target population . Data collection : The data include urinary tract ultrasonography ( UTU ) , standard questionnaire , urine examines blood specie . All examination free charge . All data collect investigator research group community clinic participant 's residential area . 1 . Appointment : After obtain population information local government , visit every family household accompany staff select community village , obtain pediatric information family , explain aim study , invite parent take kid participate study hold community village clinic . Also give notice include aim study , content , date , matter need attention survey parent . 2 . Inform consent form : When parent child come clinic , investigator explain detail consent form parent . If parent fully understand aim study agree let kid participant study , ask sign name date consent form . Also , investigator require sign name date page . 3 . Anthropometric index : Height ( cm ) weight ( kg ) measure use weighting-scale . Circumference head , chest , arm forearm measure tape . Subcutaneous fat thickness triceps , biceps , scapular region , abdominal wall measure subcutaneous fat meter . All value record first page questionnaire . 4 . Blood specimen collect analysis : All child invite collect vein blood analysis . The standard blood analysis protocol include complete blood count ( CBC ) , serum creatinine , urea , uric acid . Blood sample CBC analysis collect use tubes EDTA-K2 preservative frozen 4℃.Blood sample serum chemistry analysis collect use tube without preservative . All blood sample deliver First People 's Hospital Kashgar area analysis automate analyzer . All blood sample analyze 12 hour collection . Also , preserve blood sample child -80℃refrigerator analysis etiology include genetics . 5 . Questionnaire : All parent invite fill pre-designed standardize questionnaire face face interview Uygur staff . Information demographic data , feed pattern , lifestyle , information parent family , possible symptom urinary stone , co-morbidities kid , history medicine , family history record . Completeness accuracy questionnaire check site special quality controller . 6 . UTU : UTU conduct use model ultrasound machine 3.0-5.0 MHz frequency probe throughout study . We provide enough water drink participant require moderate bladder filling . Initially , participant lay prone position scan bilateral kidney upper ureter . Then participants turn supine position low ureter bladder scan . The position adjust necessary achieve successful scanning . Details abnormality record include stone size , number , location , depth hydronephrosis ( mm ) . The long axis stone millimeter ( mm ) use stone size . And also child find urinary abnormality ask undergo Non-enhanced helical CT scan two-mm slice First People 's Hospital Kashgar area . 7 . Urine sample child collect finish UTU . All urine sample analyze semi-automatic analyzer dry chemical method site . 8 . Dietary record case-control study : When one child find urinary stone , ask his/her parent make dietary record three consecutive day weight method . And also select four healthy child age gender ask parent make dietary record method . We provide weigh family . The table dietary record print Uygur . 9 . Quality control : The investigator involve study complete train program methodology data acquisition procedure . Each procedure manual detailed administration questionnaire , operation UTU , measurement anthropometric index , along collect handle blood specimen . The doctor machine ultrasound use whole study . All collect data register treated Epidata software ( version 3.1 ) . 10 . End point evaluation : Prevalence separately calculate participant subgroup accord age , sex , urban rural residence , BMI family history urinary stone , express unadjusted rate 95 % confidence interval ( CIs ) . Difference categorical variable compare use chi-square test . The association urinary stone relevant covariates calculate use binary logistic regression model .</detailed_description>
