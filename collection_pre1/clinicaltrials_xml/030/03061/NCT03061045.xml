	<detailed_description>Timely decompression post-hemorrhagic hydrocephalus ( PHH ) due intraventricular hemorrhage premature baby key reduce long-term cognitive motor disability . Exactly place ventricular shunt decompression alleviation increase intracranial pressure ( ICP ) remain dilemma neurosurgeon , guidance base change size ventricle necessarily reflective cerebral hemodynamics . There dire need novel diagnostic tool perform serial , bedside assessment cerebral perfusion . At time , intermittent shunting may need depend dynamic change brain perfusion , practical current diagnostic tool . While diagnostic technique require sedation transport ( i.e . magnetic resonance imaging ) , available bedside technique ( i.e . near infrared spectroscopy Doppler ultrasound ) limit soft tissue contrast , depth penetration , and/or ability quantify cerebral perfusion . Potential long-term effect sedation neonate also relatively unknown . In regard , contrast enhance ultrasound ( CEUS ) easily repeatable technique perform bedside less 5 minute provide dynamic cerebral perfusion quantification . The aim propose project therefore utilize CEUS technique detect cerebral perfusion change ventricular shunt neonatal case PHH . The specific hypothesis behind propose research impaired cerebral perfusion PHH correlate long-term cognitive motor disability . The hypothesis base follow evidence . First , substantial data animal study hydrocephalus demonstrate significant role impaired cerebral hemodynamics pathophysiology brain injury PHH . Second , animal study clearly show early treatment hydrocephalus reduces brain injury cognitive development . Third , preliminary study human infant validate aforementioned finding animal study . The expectation propose project validate statistically significant cerebral perfusion difference shunt neonate PHH , preliminary feasibility study prior conduct large scale , prospective clinical trial incorporate therapeutic intervention .</detailed_description>
