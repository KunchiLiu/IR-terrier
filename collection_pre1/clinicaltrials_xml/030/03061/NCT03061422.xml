	<brief_summary>36 eligible participant randomly divide three group ( n=12 ) accord test chewing gum ( A ) , ( A1 ) represent participant expose xylitol chewing gum , ( A2 ) represent participant expose bicarbonate xylitol chew gum ( A3 ) represent control group participant expose paraffin pellet chewing . The pH saliva evaluate accord time relation gum chewing ( T ) ( T0 ) represent pH chewing , ( T1 ) represent 5 minute gum chew fixed time day ( morning 10 11 ) . Direct benefit research human volunteer : It important high caries risk patient decrease caries susceptibility eventually decrease dental treatment subsequently treatment cost . Scientific value social benefit : This study benefit dentist main goal dentist prevent rather cure .
