	<detailed_description>Tumour evaluation use RECIST 1.1 conduct screening ( within 28 day prior first dose ) every 8 week relative date first dose , week 40 , every 16 week objective disease progression ( within window +/- 7 day schedule date ) . Study treatment continue objective disease progression ( unless criterion 3 treatment discontinuation meet ) . Patients may continue AZD2014 beyond progression ( accord RECIST 1.1 ) , discretion investigator clinically benefit treatment meet discontinuation criterion . If patient discontinues study treatment prior disease progression , continue assess use RECIST 1.1 disease progression follow survival .
