To provide preliminary data impact contralateral prophylactic mastectomy ( CPM ) -DA preparedness make CPM decision , decisional conflict , CPM knowledge , psychosocial factor , perceive risk cancer healthy/breast/metastatic disease , cancer recurrence/metastasis worry , cancer distress intention CPM . OUTLINE : PHASE I ( PROTOTYPE DEVELOPMENT AND TESTING ) : Patients attend interview ask question experience CPM , reason choose choose CPM , CPM satisfaction 60 minute . Patients receive access web-based CPM-DA attend interview 90 minute provide feedback module complete prototype evaluation . PHASE II ( CPM-DA FEASIBILITY TRIAL ) : Patients randomize 1 2 arm . ARM I : Patients undergo usual care available patient consider CPM receive information medical oncologist CPM . ARM II : Patients receive website address , secure username password , instruction use web-based CPM-DA . After completion study treatment , patient follow 2-4 week 6 month .</detailed_description>
