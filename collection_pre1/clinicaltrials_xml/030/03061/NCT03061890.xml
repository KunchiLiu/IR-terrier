	<brief_summary>The DINE study test hypothesis potentially avoidable NICU-based exposure contribute neuro-cognitive somatic impairment prevalent among NICU graduate . This hypothesis drawn document impact phthalate exposure early development term-born child , acknowledge presence toxic chemical NICU . Third trimester utero exposure phthalates link poor childhood performance cognition , motor function , attention , hyperactivity social behavior . Phthalate exposure also associate altered onset puberty asthma . The multi-site cohort approach clarify role NICU-based phthalate exposure high-prevalence clinical outcome .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Background : Each year United States , 300,000 preterm infant admit neonatal intensive care unit ( NICUs ) expose chemical-intensive hospital environment developmentally vulnerable period . Many life-saving supportive respiratory , nutritional , hematologic pharmaceutical therapy NICU expose preterm infant potentially harmful chemical life stage analogous third trimester gestation . The NIH-funded DINE study capitalize infrastructure , biorepositories , extensive clinical database four exist preterm cohort explore hypothesis early life exposure phthalates adversely impacts neurodevelopment , lung function , growth , adiposity , pubertal development childhood . The scientific premise DINE study early life exposure phthalates , class chemical plasticizer ubiquitous NICU , long-lasting harmful effect child health development , harmful effect magnify child bear preterm . This premise base strong evidence multisystem adverse health effect term-born child expose phthalates utero third trimester pregnancy early infancy . In preterm infant , however , rigorously obtain data health effect phthalates scant . Dermal , inhalational intravenous exposure phthalates widespread NICUs , preterm infant care sensitive `` third trimester '' developmental window . Moreover , premature infant experience high prevalence adverse health effect associate early life exposure phthalates term-born child , include altered neurodevelopment , poor pulmonary function , maladapted growth . A rigorous , well-designed , sufficiently power study NICU-based phthalate exposure long-term health outcome preterm infant potential change care practice , promote regulatory policy change lead mitigation phthalate exposure NICU . Significance : The propose research expect identify modifiable source developmental risk NICU patient inform improve hospital care long-term outcome . Moreover , finding could lead relatively inexpensive NICU intervention , use non-phthalate contain medical material , dose guideline elemental metal guidance parent staff infant stress-reduction , policy change ( e.g . regulation phthalates use medical device change trace metal content parenteral nutrition ) significant positive potential impact life-long morbidity common among NICU graduate . Information glean study highly-exposed , highly-vulnerable population may elucidate health impact early life exposure translate risk reduction general population .</detailed_description>
