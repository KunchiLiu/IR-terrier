	<brief_summary>The purpose study evaluate efficacy toxicity tandem HDCT/ASCT include high-dose 131I-metaiodobenzylguanidine ( MIBG ) treatment . In present study , single arm trial tandem HDCT/ASCT carry .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Tandem High Dose Chemotherapy With 131I-MIBG Treatment High Risk Neuroblastoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Although outcome high-risk neuroblastoma improve introduction HDCT/ASCT , outcome still unsatisfactory 30-40 % survival . We previously report result single arm prospective trial ( SMC NB-2004 study ) use tandem HDCT/auto-SCT high-risk neuroblastoma . In NB-2004 trial , total body irradiation ( TBI ) incorporate second transplantation . Survival rate encourage ; however , short- long-term toxicity associate tandem HDCT/auto-SCT , particularly TBI , also significant . For reason , design new prospective trial ( SMC NB-2009 study ) , TBI second HDCT/auto-SCT NB-2004 study substitute high-dose 131I-MIBG treatment order reduce short- long-term toxicity without jeopardize survival rate .</detailed_description>
