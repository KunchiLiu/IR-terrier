	<detailed_description>Introduction Patients end-stage renal disease ( ESDR ) regulate fluid balance , dependent dialysis fluid removal . Fluid removal dependent upon estimation dry weight . Dry weight define post-dialysis weight patient suffers ( often ) symptom hypotension . Today , clinical estimation dry weight base physical examination . This method inaccurate , many patient suffer consequence over- under-estimation dry weight . Overestimation lead hypertension , edema pulmonary congestion , cardiac hypertrophy failure . Underestimation result chronic dehydration , hypotension , dizziness , muscle spasm , gastrointestinal disturbance , tinnitus shock . Both over- underestimation diminish quality life . One method propose objective estimator hydration status sonographic measurement inferior vena cava diameter ( IVCD ) . Cheriex et al determine IVCD correlate right atrial filling , suggest IVCD 11.5 mm/m2 indicate hypervolemia , value less 8 mm/m2 indicate hypovolemia . Chang et al report randomized controlled trial examine quality life clinical outcome hemodialysis patient IVCD measure compare patient dry weight estimation base solely physical examination . They find less clinical mishap improve quality life intervention group , effect pronounce patient find hypovolemic . As report randomized intervention , conduct Asian participant , seek conduct similar study independent hemodialysis population . Objective Examination quality life consequence dry weight estimation ESRD patient receive dialysis sonographic IVCD measurement . Hypothesis We assume adjustment dry weight ESRD patient receive hemodialysis use sonographic IVCD measurement improve quality life . Methods Study design : single-blinded cross-over clinical trial Study population : ESRD patient receive chronic dialysis Hadassah Medical Center hemodialysis unit . Exclusion criterion : pregnant woman ; patient treat hemodialysis le 3 month ; significant tricuspid regurgitation ; severe heart failure ; patient inadequate sonographic window IVCD visualization . Quantitative outcome : Primary - rate symptomatic hypotensive event hemodialysis session ; secondary - ( 1 ) quality life , evaluate use SF-36 questionnaire ; ( 2 ) intradialysis clinical event : hypotensive episode , gastrointestinal complaint , muscle spasm , tinnitus , headache chest pain ; ( 3 ) rate emergent ( unplanned ) hemodialysis treatment ; ( 4 ) average 24 h ambulatory blood pressure sleep-related dipping . Experimental method : hemodialysis patient undergo monthly clinical evaluation primary nephrologist , include history , review peri-dialysis blood pressure , physical examination routine lab â€” basis monthly adjustment target dry weight . Measurement IVCD index perform twice participant , begin month 1 3 , prior monthly visit primary nephrologist . Measurement perform described Cheriex et al . The primary nephrologist notify IVCD index perform begin month 3 , request adjust target post-dialysis weight accordingly . Participants blind whether primary nephrologist notify measurement . Assessment quality life : self report patient use SF-36 medical outcome study short form health survey score system , end month 2 4 . Ambulatory blood pressure monitoring : perform use Ocsar 2 device ( SunTech ) end month 2 4 . Sample size analysis : calculation sample size guide primary outcome . We estimate 4 hypotensive episode occur across 14 monthly dialysis session , intervention reduce number episode 2 per 14 session . With difference 2 episode standard deviation 2 episode , alpha level 0.05 90 % power , 2-sided pair t-test sample size 13 paired assessment ( 13 patient ) ( WINPEPI ) . Assuming incomplete followup , intend recruit 20 participant .</detailed_description>
