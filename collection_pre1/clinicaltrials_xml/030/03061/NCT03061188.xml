	<brief_summary>The purpose research study determine high safest dose experimental drug veliparib combine nivolumab . We also study safely combination medication give advanced cancer lymphoma benefit receive therapy . Nivolumab currently approve certain cancer melanoma , lung cancer kidney cancer . Veliparib yet approve use United States , consider experimental . Veliparib inhibits ( block ) activity enzyme PARP . This block activity may prevent cancer cell repair resume grow . Nivolumab increase T cell immune system , allow immune system attack cancer . We think combination drug effective cancer .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Nivolumab Veliparib Treating Patients With Recurrent Refractory Stage IV Solid Tumors That Can Be Removed Surgery Lymphoma With Without Alterations DNA Repair Genes</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To identify maximum tolerate dose ( MTD ) combination treatment nivolumab veliparib patient advance refractory solid cancer lymphoma . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . To evaluate safety tolerability nivolumab veliparib patient advance refractory solid cancer lymphoma without mutation select DNA repair gene . II . To evaluate efficacy treatment nivolumab veliparib population objective response rate ( ORR , define partial response [ PR ] + complete response [ CR ] ) , clinical benefit rate ( CBR , define stable disease [ SD ] &gt; = 12 week , PR , + CR ) , progression free survival ( PFS , define time treatment initiation document disease progression ) use Response Evaluation Criteria Solid Tumors ( RECIST ) criterion version ( v ) 1.1 Lugano criterion . III . To evaluate efficacy treatment nivolumab veliparib population ORR , CBR , immune-related PFS ( irPFS ) use irRECIST criterion . IV . To evaluate overall survival ( OS ) population 3 year start treatment . V. To evaluate proportion patient alive progression free 24 week population . VI . To evaluate ORR nivolumab veliparib patient prior exposure single agent PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitor . TERTIARY OBJECTIVES : I . To evaluate follow predict response veliparib combination nivolumab : tissue PD-L1 protein expression , immune cell infiltration marker . II . To demonstrate pharmacodynamic effect veliparib nivolumab biomarkers include PD-L1 , TILs , T cell subpopulation , T cell receptor genotype . III . To explore pattern clonal change circulate cell free DNA assay . IV . To assess dynamic change immune genomic biomarkers blood may correlate response veliparib . OUTLINE : This dose-escalation study veliparib . Patients receive veliparib orally ( PO ) twice daily ( BID ) day 1 nivolumab intravenously ( IV ) 30 minute day 1 15 course 1-4 IV 60 minute day 1 subsequent course . Courses repeat every 28 day absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . After completion study treatment , patient follow 3 , 6 , 9 , 12 month every 6 month 3 year .</detailed_description>
