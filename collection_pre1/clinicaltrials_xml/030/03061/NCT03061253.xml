	<brief_summary>The large current uptake e-cigarettes ( 2.8 million U.K. user 2016 ; 26 ) , continuous involvement e-cigarettes ( potentially affect content well ) , uncertainty medium- longer-term effect , need promote smoke cessation mean reduce Cardiovascular disease , dictate research urgently need . Research explore impact e-cigarettes cardiovascular function/ health request European Parliament , British Medical Association , regulatory agency , clinician researcher , currently consensus within smoke cessation community potential impact e-cigarettes . With e-cigarettes successful replace traditional cigarette ( i.e . 42 % within month ) , study efficacy-focused , also explore physiological effect e-cigarettes , preliminary work field contrast limited , acute- longer-term timeframe . Furthermore , e-cigarettes simple nicotine-based product , general public , researcher government agency rely exist research explore effect nicotine cardio-vasculature ( e.g . coronary peripheral vasoconstriction , intravascular inflammation deregulation cardiac autonomic function well inhibition microcirculation ) . Thus , lack direct evidence - would clarify degree safety e-cigarettes user 's vascular system determine longer-term cardiovascular disease risk - increase need research field . Such study supply in-depth information service-users policy-makers , especially recently-initiated U.K. 's `` Medicines Healthcare Products Regulatory Agency '' validation e-cigarettes increase likelihood introduction smoke cessation clinic . This study bridge exist knowledge gap inform general public , scientific smoking cessation community respect physiological ( e.g . cardiovascular health ) participant ' experience nicotine-inclusive nicotine-free , e-cigarettes ( combined behavioural change support ) compare currently NHS-applied smoke cessation pathway combine Nicotine Replacement Therapy behavioural change support . This allow future research advance optimize pharmacological treatment tobacco nicotine dependence , take consideration study 's physiological Health Economics ' finding .</brief_summary>
