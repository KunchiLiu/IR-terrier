	<detailed_description>This study consist 3 study visit clinic ( medical screening visit , 2 LH-EEC visit ) least 9 day . Subjects need refrain put makeup near eye morning visit . At medical screen visit ( Visit 1 ) , subject undergo informed consent , fill Ocular Surface Disease Index ( OSDI ) questionnaire , provide medical/surgical/ocular/medication history demographic . A urine pregnancy test perform woman childbearing potential ( WOCBP ) . Prior baseline symptom sign collection , subject acclimatize clinic environment least 30 min . Baseline subject rating ocular symptom ( dryness , burning/stinging , tear , grittiness/sandiness , intermittent blurring , soreness/discomfort , sensitivity light [ photophobia ] ) eye together record use electronic Patient Data Acquisition Tablet ( ePDAT™ ) 0-4 scale 0.5 increment . To meet eligibility criterion , subject participate follow ophthalmic examination ( order specify ) : distance visual acuity ( VA ) , slit lamp examination ( SLE ) , undilated fundus examination , non-contact tonometry ( NCT ) follow least 30 min wait , baseline TFI ocular surface image assessment ( duplicate measurement least 30 min apart eye ) , Tear Break Up Time ( TBUT ) , corneal fluorescein staining ( CFS ) , conjunctival lissamine green staining ( CLGS ) , Schirmer 's Test without anesthetic , Meibomian Gland Dysfunction ( MGD ) test . Upon conclusion screening DES , eye fit bad DES inclusion criterion designate study eye . For NDE subject , best eye designate study eye . During Visit 2 3 , TFI measurement clinical study endpoint procedure ( i.e . TBUT , CFS , CLGS , Schirmer 's Test ) conduct study eye , however safety endpoint procedure ( i.e . VA , SLE , undilated fundus exam NCT ) still conduct eye individually throughout study . Subjects queried adverse event ( AEs ) visit . The clinic environment monitor relative humidity ( % RH ) temperature ( ºC ) visit . After least 2 day washout period , subject return clinic Visit 2 . Prior baseline symptom sign collection , subject acclimatize clinic environment least 30 min . Subjects query change health medication use since last visit . Baseline subject rating 7 subjective ocular symptom record use ePDAT™ . Baseline ophthalmic evaluation conduct ( order specify ) include VA , SLE follow least 30 min wait , TFI assessment ( single measurement ) , TBUT , CFS , CLGS Schirmer 's Test without anesthetic . Following Schirmer 's Test , subject wait least 60 min clinic time , baseline blink rate ( blink/min , triplicate ) measure . Subjects second TFI measurement enter LH-EEC . Subject symptom score staff assess blink rate assess eye together throughout study . Subjects enter LH-EEC ( &lt; 15 % relative humidity ( RH ) , temperature 22±5ºC , 5±3ft/s direct air flow velocity ) remain approximately 120 min . During time subject ask visually task digital screen ensure ocular surface expose airflow humidity level room . Environmental condition LH-EEC , include relative humidity ( % RH ) temperature ( ºC ) , monitor . Subject-assessed symptom assess 15 , 30 , 60 , 90 , 120 min ( +5 min ) , LH-EEC . Blink rate TFI tear film image assessment ( single measurement study eye ) assess qualified staff 35 , 65 , 95 min ( +15 min ) , prior LH-EEC exit . After procedure prior exit chamber , VA , TBUT , CFS , CLGS , Schirmer 's Test without topical anesthetic , perform . After LH-EEC exit , health check conduct . After least 7 day washout period , subject return clinic Visit 3 second LH-EEC visit . Subjects query change health medication use since last visit . Subjects enter LH-EEC ( &lt; 15 % relative humidity [ RH ] , temperature 22±5ºC , 5±3ft/s direct air flow velocity ) approximately 120 min . All procedure prior LH-EEC entry , LH-EEC exposure prior LH-EEC exit repeat Visit 2 . Following LH-EEC exit , subject health check study check procedure conduct include : VA , SLE , undilated fundus exam , NCT . Analysis Sets : The Safety set consist subject enrol study . The Modified Intent-to-Treat population ( MITT ) set consist subject enrol study enter LH-EEC provide least one post-baseline measurement . The Per-Protocol population ( PP ) set consist subject MITT population complete Visit 3 protocol violation may substantially affect result . Statistical Analysis : Data summarize respect baseline characteristic , efficacy variable safety variable . Summary statistic include number observation ( N ) , mean , standard deviation ( SD ) , median , minimum maximum value continuous variable frequency percentages categorical variable . Missing value replace imputed , i.e. , interpolation extrapolation apply miss value . Safety data list summarize group ( NDE , ADDE , LDDE ) . Any deviation ( ) plan statistical analysis describe fully justified Statistical Analysis Plan ( SAP ) and/or final clinical study report ( CSR ) appropriate . Demographic Baseline Characteristics : Demographic baseline characteristic subject participate study summarize study group ( NDE , ADDE , LDDE ) overall use descriptive statistic . Distributions baseline parameter among study group compare descriptively . No statistical inference perform . Safety Analysis : Safety evaluate via follow parameter : AEs , SLE , VA , NCT , Fundus examination AEs summarize severity causality . AEs summarize body system preferred term within study group ( NDE/ADDE/LDDE ) . Each AE count give subject . If AE occur subject multiple occasion , high severity maximum causality relationship assume . Serious AEs ( SAEs ) , , summarize body system , preferred term study group . All AEs list , along SAEs AEs lead discontinuation . NCT assessment perform Screening ( Visit 1 ) end study ( Visit 3 ) , measure Intra-Ocular Pressure ( IOP ) . The collect data ( average 3 reading eye ) list study group , subject visit . Summary statistic average 3 reading eye tabulate Study eye , Right Left eye . Study eye define SAP . VA assessment perform visit . Data list ADDE/ LDDE/NDE group , subject visit . Statistical Study Termination : If device relate SAE rate exceed 20 % specific group ( ADDE/LDDE/NDE ) study group halt report immediately send Sponsor . The Investigator Sponsor analyze report offer protocol update Institutional Review Board ( IRB ) rectify problem . If IRB approve update protocol , study continue base updated protocol . If IRB accept update protocol specific group study terminate . Analysis Endpoints : The analysis clinical endpoint carry use MITT PP population . All summary table provide study group ( NDE , ADDE , LDDE ) overall . The repeatability TFI evaluate summary TFI assessment Visit 2 Visit 3 . The sensitivity imager detect change ocular surface integrity evaluate summary baseline post baseline assessment score time point visit . The correlation clinical measurement DE correspond TFI measurement interest evaluate association two assessment . Descriptive statistic observe assessment score time point change post LH-EEC time point pre LH-EEC baseline score summarize . Individual data listing observe value present study group , visit time point .</detailed_description>
