	<brief_summary>Cognitive deficit prominent disable symptom schizophrenia . Evidence suggest schizophrenia involves alteration function neural system control brain chemical call GABA . The present project compare effect low-dose clonazepam ( sub-sedating dose ) placebo , effect GABA- modulate brain activity measure EEG , associate cognitive process people schizophrenia .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Clonazepam Effects Brain Oscillations Cognition Schizophrenia</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Schizophrenia common , disabling mental illness considerable public health impact . Cognitive dysfunction ( e.g attention , memory , etc . ) endure feature illness , strong predictor functional outcome , presently establish treatment . Therefore , advance treatment cognition schizophrenia likely alleviate significant health burden . Deficits executive control function , measurable task-switching paradigm , among important cognitive deficit schizophrenia , arise disturbance distribute neural network operate prefrontal cortex . An important phenomenon underpin cortical information processing oscillation brain activity measure intracranial electrical recording scalp EEG . These network cortical oscillatory signature also strongly modulate cortical interneurons use gamma-amino butyric acid ( GABA ) neurotransmitter . Post-mortem evidence suggest GABAergic neuron alter schizophrenia . Furthermore , study animal , use optogenetic manipulation restrict subset cortical GABA neuron , also suggest GABA neuron selectively modulate improve PFC-dependent cognition animal model schizophrenia . This include experiment involve administration sub-sedating dos clonazepam , representative FDA-approved medication benzodiazepine class . Therefore , neurochemical system represent novel set candidate treatment target implicate pathophysiology schizophrenia potential remediation associate cognitive dysfunction .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Subjects include adult ( 1855 year old ) currently meet criterion schizophrenia , schizophreniform disorder schizoaffective disorder DSMIV ( 295.X ) . Healthy control subject : 1855 year age . All subject exclude history substancerelated disorder ( DSMIV , cannabis abuse ) prior 6 month , repeat positive urine drug screen illicit substance . They also exclude clinicallyunstable , significant baseline emergent suicide risk ( Columbia Suicide Severity Risk Scale ) , estimate IQ &lt; 70 , EEG contraindication . Subjects must also major medical neurological illness , significant head trauma . Active pregnancy lactation also consider contraindication treatment clonazepam , criteria exclusion . Excluded medication : Prospective subject exclude currently treatment benzodiazepine , anticonvulsant , medication zolpidem baclofen , directly affect GABA neuron may associate change GABA system function . Known allergy/sensitivity hypersensitivity component study drug ( ) formulation , sensitivity/hypersensitivity clonazepam criterion exclusion . Healthy control must free diagnosis chronic recurrent Axis I ( certain Axis II ) psychiatric disorder exclude first degree relative psychotic disorder . Education , parental education , ethnicity , handedness , native language use exclusionary factor necessary maintain balance group .
