	<detailed_description>- Study set This study carry adult patient attend operative clinic The Faculty Oral Dental Medicine , Cairo University , Egypt . The procedure carry postgraduate student esraa abdel ghaffar ahmed ali [ B.D.S . 2012 Misr International University ] without assistant . - Eligibility criterion - Inclusion criterion Normal adult recruit study , volunteer participate experiment healthy look free medical history . Subjects age 18-35 year At least three sensitive teeth ( buccal /facial ) aspect recession , abrasion , erosion score &gt; 3 verbal rating scale , range 0-3= pain/mild pain , 4-6= moderate pain , 7- 10= severe pain . Subjects require available duration study , sign inform consent form -Exclusion criterion Subjects history allergy drug chemical use study . Any removable appliance ( RPD orthodontic retainer ) . Ongoing orthodontic treatment fix appliance . Presence large defective restoration , crack enamel caries hypersensitive tooth . Pregnancy lactate mother . Dental pathology cause pain similar dentin hypersensitivity . Patients systemic problem mental physical disability -Grouping participant : Participants test study least 3 sensitive sound teeth . Participants divide 3 group , accord type desensitizing agent ( D ) ; D1 treatment use 8 % arginine base toothpaste ( Colgate Pro-relief ) , D2 treatment use 8 % strontium acetate base toothpaste ( Sensodyne Rapid Action ) D3 control group use placebo ( gel without active ingredient ) . -Intervention : The procedure perform scale group D1 use 8 % arginine base toothpaste ( Colgate Pro-relief ) , group D2 use 8 % strontium acetate base toothpaste ( Sensodyne Rapid Action ) D3 control group use placebo . Treatment do baseline patient use toothpaste home twice per day use soft bristle tooth brush give dentifrice use modified stillmans method explained examiner . The choice follow brushing method make well establish efficiency clean sulcular area potential niche plaque accumulation . Dental plaque consider one possible cause dentin hypersensitivity . Additionally Modified Stillmans technique show increase gingival crevice fluid flow thus provide flush action . Patient recall 1 week , 2 week 3 month evaluation effect intervention reduction dentin hypersensitivity . The application procedure follow manufacturer 's instruction . -Testing procedure : Dentinal hypersensitivity measure use Visual Analogue Scale ( VAS ) record response calibrate short blast air syringe four time interval `` baseline , 1 week , 2 week 3 month '' -Randomization : Randomization do accord check list do dentist researcher include number participant divide 3 subgroup denote letter A , B C. -Sample size calculation : This study conduct evaluate effect 8 % arginine base toothpaste comparison 8 % strontium acetate base toothpaste dentin hypersensitivity reduction . Based previous study SHAH 2015 , mean dentine hypersensitivity 3.3+_ 0.6 Colgate paste 2.6 +_ 0.7 Sensodyne past . Using power 80 % 5 % significance level , 15 patient group sufficient . This number increase 17 patient compensate possible loss follow . The sample size calculate G power . -Recruitment Announcement resident outpatient clinic Conservative Dentistry- Faculty Oral Dental Medicine- Cairo University Egypt , screen adult patient diagnosis chief complain patient least three sensitive teeth enrol study , meet eligibility criterion . -Allocation 1. sequence generation Randomization do computer software www.random.org . The sequence generate 3 code ( A , B C ) . 2 . Allocation concealment arrangement A checklist design dentist researcher identify material specimen 3 . Implementation Allocation sequence generate Center Evidence Based Dentistry , Faculty Oral Dental Medicine - Cairo University . Participant enrollment do principle investigator - Blinding : It triple blind study participant , researcher data analysis blind . - Data collection method : There file participant include his/her ( informed consent , 4 time interval visual analogue scale , data include address , phone number ) information need follow . - Retention In order ensure participant come back sequence visit , patient ask telephone number address call visit . Explanation importance study explain patient importance keep appointment -Data management Explain patient importance study commitment appointment mandatory get best result study . All data document patient sheet . -Statistical Methods Data analyze use IBM SPSS advance statistic ( Statistical Package Social Sciences ) , version 21 ( SPSS Inc. , Chicago , IL ) . Numerical data describe mean standard deviation median range . Data explore normality use kolmogorov - Smirnov test Shapiro-Wilk test . Comparisons 3 group normally distribute numeric variable do use ANOVA non normally distribute numeric variable do Kruskal Wallis test . A p-value le equal 0.05 consider statistically significant . All test two tail . Categorical data describe number percentage comparison do chi square test fisher exact appropriate . -Data Monitoring This study monitor supervisor full access result take final decision terminate trial . -Harms No reported adverse effect intervention report . In case harm trial report , document treat . -Auditing Auditing study design do evidence base committee- Faculty Oral Dental Medicine- Cairo University . -Ethics dissemination Patient consent . Detailed check list include exact procedure intervention perform , number visit , importance study participant , well importance population , possible adverse effect accompany use intervention . -Research ethic approval This protocol template inform consent form review Ethics Committee scientific research , Faculty Oral Dental Medicine- Cairo University . -Protocol amendment Any modification protocol may impact conduction study , potential benefit patient may affect patient safety , include change study objective , study design , sample size , study procedure significant administrative aspect require formal amendment protocol . Such amendment agree upon council Conservative dentistry Department . -Consent assent Researcher discuss trial participant 's . They able discus thought researcher full explanation procedure simple word . A verbal assent take participate patient write consent sign patient . -Confidentiality All study relate information store securely . All participant '' information store lock file cabinet area limited access . Process administrative form identify coded ID [ identifier number ] maintain participant ' confidentiality . All record contain name personal identifier store separately study record identify code number . -Declaration interest Non-financial - Access data All principle investigator give access data set . All data set password protect . - Ancillary post-trial care Full mouth treatment offer participant addition post-operative care preventive measure end trial .</detailed_description>
