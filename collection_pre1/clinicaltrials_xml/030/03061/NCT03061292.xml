	<brief_summary>Implantation cardiac implantable electronic device generally carry use intermittent intravenous conscious sedation combine local anaesthesia . The main advantage technique avoid potential risk general anaesthesia . However , use Sedation - Local Anaesthesia technique without complication . Peri -procedural hypoxaemia hypotension well recognised complication technique . The pectoral nerve ( Pecs ) block novel technique block pectoral , intercostobrachial , third sixth intercostal , long thoracic nerve . PECS block target lateral median pectoral nerve interfascial plane pectoralis major minor muscle . A case report Fujiwara et al describe use technique provide good analgesia implantation procedure surgery . Pectoral nerve block along minimal sedation use safe technique local set well . Hence , propose randomize , single center , control trial patient undergoing cardiac implantable electronic device implantation local anaesthesia sedation without Pectoral Nerve Block .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Cardiac Implantable Electronic Device Implantation With Without Pectoral Nerve Block</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Intervention group : Pectoral nerve block perform anaesthetist ( blind ) cardiac catheterization laboratory use ultrasound guidance strict aseptic technique . Control group : A sham `` block '' perform anaesthetist cardiac catheterization laboratory use strict aseptic technique . Patients group monitor Cardiologist ( perform procedure ) Nurse monitoring room . A minimum period 15 minute allow follow block , prior device implantation procedure cardiologist . Numeric rating scale ( NRS ) use assessment pain . The assessment carry every 15 minute start procedure till end procedure ( 0 , 15 , 30 , 45 , 60 minute etc ) also specific time point . Numerical rating scale also assess patient experience pain point recovery room ( 0 , 15 , 30 need , 45 , 60 minute ) . Further post-operative pain score collect 4 hour 8 hour post-procedure .</detailed_description>
