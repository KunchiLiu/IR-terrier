	<detailed_description>Although surgical medical castration consider standard treatment hormone-naïve PC patient , patient extensive metastatic disease , include visceral bone involvement beyond axial skeleton , short survival . Based recent randomize trial ( CHAARTED , GETUG-AFU15 STAMPEDE ) , hormone-naïve men metastatic , high-volume PC offer docetaxel plus ADT . However , side effect standard 3-weekly 75 mg/m2 docetaxel substantial . In addition , prospective trial need determine whether early docetaxel chemotherapy combination ADT beneficial Korean men . Considering experience docetaxel , dose intensity 20 mg/m2/week ( equivalent 60 mg/m2 3-weekly 40 mg/m2 biweekly ) test prospective trial .</detailed_description>
