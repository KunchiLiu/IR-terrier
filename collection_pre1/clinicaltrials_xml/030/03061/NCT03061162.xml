	<brief_title>Pulsed Low Dose Rate Radiation Therapy Gastric Cancer Patients With Peritoneal Metastasis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This phase II trial study side effect response pulse low dose rate radiation therapy treat gastric cancer patient peritoneal metastasis . Radiation therapy use pulse low dose rate high energy X ray kill tumor cell make less side effect conventional 3-dimensional conformal radiation therapy . Palliative radiation therapy may help gastric cancer patient peritoneal metastasis live comfortably .</detailed_description>
