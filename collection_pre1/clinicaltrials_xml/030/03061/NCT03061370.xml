	<brief_summary>In line improvement oncologic outcome patient esophageal cancer , attritional impact curative treatment respect functional status health-related quality life ( HR-QL ) survivorship increasingly important focus . Functional recovery surgery esophageal cancer commonly confound anorexia early satiety , may reduce oral nutrient intake consequent malnutrition weight loss . One three disease-free patient fifteen percent body weight loss three year esophagectomy . The ESPEN Special Interest Group cachexia-anorexia chronic wasting disease define sarcopenia skeletal muscle index ( SMI ) ≤39 cm2/m2 woman ≤55cm2/m2 men , similar cut-off point validate upper gastrointestinal respiratory malignancy ( less 38.5 cm2/m2 woman 52.4 cm2/m2 men ) . The European Working Group Sarcopenia Older People ( EWGSOP ) additionally recommend assessment also include determination muscle function , example gait speed grip strength , possible . The presence sarcopenia associate increase treatment-associated morbidity , impaired HR-QL , reduce physical role functioning , increase pain score old adult . In addition , previous longitudinal study demonstrate decline HR-QL six year period old adult accelerate presence sarcopenia . As , sarcopenia may represent modifiable barrier recovery subsequent retention HR-QL functional status , may reinforce persistent illness identity , among patient follow potentially curative treatment esophageal cancer .</brief_summary>
