	<detailed_description>The altered balance proteinase tissue inhibitor ( TIMPS ) one pathogenetical mechanism aneurysmal connective tissue degeneration . The increase protease , collagenase elastase activity result indeed dramatic drop collagen elastin tissue serum level . Vessels wall strength decrease associate blood flow shear stress affect negatively wall integrity , cause aneurysmatic vessel degeneration . Matrix Metalloproteinases ( MMPs ) group proteolytic enzyme along specific non-specific inhibitor modulate extracellular matrix composition . So far , 25 MMPs discover , particular , one consider study : MMP-2 , MMP-9 , neutrophil gelatinase-associated lipocalin ( NGAL ) relate protein able control MMP-9 activity . Inflammation play central role pathogenetical pathway aneurysmatic developement . Recent study suggest interesting role miRNAs regulation mechanism inflammation . miRNAs short ribonucleic acid molecule usually compose 20 25 nucleotide regulate mRNA transcription protein translation target 3'-untranslated region ( 3'-UTR ) target gene . miRNAs involve various physiological response pathological process . Increasing evidence suggest miRNAs involve inflammatory response . In particular one focus study : miR-29b , miR-21 , miR-181a , miR-150 . Very often , patient aneurysmatic disease statin treatment . Some Statins ( Atorvastatin , Simvastatin Rosuvastatin ) pleiotropic effect may also play protective role condition progression aneurysmatic degeneration . The aim study analyse influence statin treatment aneurysmatic disease monitoring MMPs related molecule ( MMP-2 , MMP-9 NGAL ) , miRNAs ( evaluation perform aneurysmatic wall tissue circulate blood level ) . Patients affected central peripheral aneurysmatic disease recruit divide two group base dosage statin treatment : first group maximum statin daily dose ( Atorvastatin 80 mg , Simvastatin 40 mg , Rosuvastatin 40 mg ) , second group minimum statin daily dose . The latter define control group . Only patient fullfill criterion undergo surgical treatment recruit study order collect biological specimen aneurysmatic tissue . The investigation consist : - take preoperative blood sample evaluate MMPs circulating level - take aneurysmatic vessel wall histological sample intraoperative biopsy evaluate tissue MMPs miRNAs level . Previously , several study suggest role MMPs ( MMP-2 MMP-9 ) miRNAs regulation aneurysm developement , particular miR29b , miR-181a , miR-21 , miR-150 . The comparison MMPs Levels study group control group might highlight role MMPs level marker aneurysmatic disease progression , consequently allow patient 's stratification analyse risk aneurysmatic evolution growth .</detailed_description>
