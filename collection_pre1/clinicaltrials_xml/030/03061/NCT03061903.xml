	<brief_summary>High risk patient receive direct anterior approach total hip arthroplasty likely experience wind complication . The purpose study determine whether usage close incision negative pressure dressing decrease risk wound complication compare standard dressing . Patients decide participate study randomize one two dress prior surgery leave operating room one treating dressing . Patient monitor 90 day surgery wound complication picture wound take . The patient course treatment besides randomized one two dressing identical patient receive Direct Anterior Approach Total Hip Arthroplasty ( DAA THA ) . Primary outcome measure uneventful wound healing ( require intervention ) versus occurrence wound complication ( wound drainage , breakdown , necrosis , dehiscence , superficial deep infection ) require additional intervention . Intervention define attempt surgeon improve wound healing ( in-office debridement , topical ointment , aspiration , antibiotic therapy , return OR wound ) . Secondary outcome measure include duration wound heal delay , length hospital stay , number day antibiotic therapy , direct estimate indirect cost . Statistical analysis perform detect difference treatment group .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The goal study determine efficacy ciNPT prevention wound complication return operate room wound complication patient pre-determined risk factor affect wound heal . This prospective , randomize , control trial . Subjects randomly assign either ciNPT intervention group control group use computer-generated , randomized envelope equal number treatment arm . Both dressing apply sterile condition end DAA THA surgery , still operate room , remove 7 day . Patients randomize control group receive conformable , water resistant , silver-impregnated , antimicrobial hydrofiber dressing ( AQUACEL® Ag , Convatec ) currently standard care institution postoperative wound dress . This dressing leave place 7 day remove patient visit nurse home . Patients randomize study group receive incisional ciNPT device , currently use selectively high-risk patient institution ( Prevena™ , KCI ) . Both wound dressing FDA-approved device . Due obvious difference appearance two dressing , neither patient treat surgeon blind treatment arm . Wounds assess postoperatively regular interval wound heal achieve . This occur least 2 6 week surgery , standard interval current postoperative protocol . No additional office visit need patient control treatment arm . Photodocumentation wound occur two six week postoperatively .</detailed_description>
