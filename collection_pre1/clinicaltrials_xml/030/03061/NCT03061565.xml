	<brief_summary>Traumatic brain injury catastrophic event commonly require treatment intensive care unit . Management mainly supportive aim avoid hypoxia , hypotension , hypoglycaemia increase intracerebral pressure . Thus far effort find specific pharmacologic therapy disappoint . Recently demonstrate recombinant erythropoietin find decrease mortality six month injury without significantly improve functional neurological outcome ( GOSe ) . Whether survival benefit EPO sustain beyond 6 month unknown . In current study survival data collect centrally patient alive person responsible invited participate evaluation neurological function quality life . Factors associate time death well factor associate long term quality life determine statistical method .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Long Term Effects Erythropoietin Patients With Moderate Severe Traumatic Brain Injury</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Aim : In post hoc study RCT primary aim determine effect EPO compare placebo improve outcome , include survival , neurological function quality life two year conclusion EPO-TBI study ( two seven year moderate severe TBI occur individual patient ) . Design : A long term follow-up study prospective , multi-centre , double blind , phase III , randomise control trial . Methods : Survival status time follow-up trial execute obtained patient . Time injury vary 2 7 year depend patient enrol . This information obtain hospital note , national register office and/or national statistical bureau . Since trial international RCT , strategy may vary take account local circumstance . Local plan develop local principal investigator approve management committee . Data include - Survival status long term follow ( alive/dead ) - Time injury assessment ( day ) - If patient decease , time death time injury day Quality life assessment Patients ( proxy - generally close family member ) alive 2-7 year randomisation interview trained assessor . The contact person use primary trial contact primarily . Consent obtain conduction long term assessment . Assessors use standardized structure telephone questionnaire determine GOSE QOL . Neurological outcome define favourable ( GOSE 5 8 ; moderate disability good recovery ) unfavourable ( GOSE 1 4 ; death severe disability ) . Data include : - Time assessment - Time injury day - Follow-up GOSE - Follow-up EQ-5D - Follow-up SF-12</detailed_description>
