	<brief_title>Nivolumab Ipilimumab Treatment Prostate Cancer With Immunogenic Signature</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This single arm phase II trial design assess efficacy nivolumab + ipilimumab patient metastatic castrate resistant prostate cancer progress follow least 1 line therapy specify immunogenic signature . The immunogenic signature define presence least one following : - Mismatch repair deficiency IHC - Defective DNA repair detect targeted sequencing panel - High inflammatory infiltrate define multiplexed IHC criterion . Treatment consist : - Nivolumab 1 mg/kg + ipilimumab 3 mg/kg every three week maximum 4 dos - 6 week gap last combination dose - 480 mg flat dose nivolumab every 4 week one year , progression , unacceptable toxicity withdrawal consent . Patients must ongoing androgen deprivation maintain serum testosterone &lt; 1.73 nmol/L .</detailed_description>
