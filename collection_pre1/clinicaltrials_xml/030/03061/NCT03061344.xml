	<brief_summary>Study Objectives The current definitive treatment option urethral stricture disease include endoscopic urethrotomy know Direct Vision Internal Urethrotomy ( DVIU ) open reconstruction know urethroplasty ( 1-6 ) . The purpose study determine feasibility endoscopic-only repair urethral stricture bladder neck contracture use combination exist surgical technique internal urethrotomy ( bladder neck incision ) augment buccal mucosal graft .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Background Rationale There two definitive treatment option urethral stricture : DVIU open urethroplasty . DVIU endoscopic procedure consider minimally invasive , also high failure rate 60-92 % . The repeated DVIUs report even high failure rate . On hand , open urethroplasty , consider gold standard reconstruction , invasive , require incision perineum urethra , leave life-long scar , long term success rate 74-95 % . The detail DVIU open urethroplasty discuss . DVIU involve pass cystoscope urethra level stricture incise stricture longitudinally create wide passage level normal urethra proximal side . The hope cut scar level healthy underlying tissue process heal populate cut surface healthy urethral epithelium ( least stabilize scar open configuration ) . In case , scar recurs faster epithelization stricture recur DVIU within 7-8 month . Studies show strictures traditional repeat DVIU long require involved reconstruction stricture patient without prior instrumentation . Open urethroplasty urethral stricture bladder neck contracture usually involve longitudinal incision urethra ( outside ) augmentation incise part strip harvest Buccal Mucosal Graft ( BMG ) . The goal operation create wide urethral lumen patient able pas urine without obstruction . The first step procedure DVIU open reconstruction nearly : longitudinal incision scar portion urethra . The difference second part : covering defect buccal mucosal graft open urethroplasty v leave incision uncover exposed passage urine . Investigators study hereby propose combine minimally invasive technique DVIU technique augment incised stricture ( bladder neck contracture ) use buccal mucosal graft place endoscopically mean application liquid suspend graft . A similar , invasive technique report Seith et al 2012 perform 12 patient exception need small open perineal incision graft fixation . A purely endoscopic skin graft placement urethra report Naude 1998 53 patient 95 % success rate 2 year follow . While make actual incision , approach require percutaneous perineal needle placement graft delivery specialized device graft delivery graft fixation . The procedure propose current trial purely endoscopic buccal graft placement fixation augment fibrin glue . This type fibrin glue sealant readily available widely use General Surgery , Plastic Surgery Urology specifically urethral reconstruction ) . This allow significantly less invasive procedure , short procedure time , absence traditional perineal incision needle puncture , early return home ( day v 1-3 day ) , earlier catheter removal ( 5-7 day vs 21 day ) early return regular activity ( 1 week vs 6 week ) . Overall , aim improve outcome traditional endoscopic procedure eliminate morbidity open reconstruction add benefit earlier convalescence health care saving decrease surgical morbidity shorten hospital stay .</detailed_description>
