	<brief_summary>This study second phase research project call `` Smart Pain Assessment Tool base Internet-of-Things '' . During course project , smart pain assessment tool ( SPA ) detect assess pain employ behavioural physiologic indicator develop . We aim assess pain base change electromyographic ( EMG ) activity facial muscle , i.e . change facial expression simultaneously use physiologic sign heart rate , respiratory rate galvanic skin response adjuvant measure develop algorithm pain assessment critically ill patient .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The aim `` smart pain assessment tool base internet thing '' SPA-research project develop automatic versatile pain assessment tool algorithm detection assessment pain reliable objective way non-communicative patient . The final objective research project develop smart pain assessment tool detect ass pain employ behavioural physiologic indicator wide range users/patients infants elderly people unable communicate normally . The research project consist three clinical phase ( European Commision . Meddev 2.7/4/2010 ) . The clinical phase I research project focus develop pain assessment technique involuntary working-age healthy study subject . This current Clinical phase II include development research smart pain assessment tool elective ( non emergency ) postoperative surgical patient stay surgery recovery room .</detailed_description>
