	<brief_summary>Chlorhexidine potent chemotherapeutic agent mutans streptococci dental caries , however , incidence side effect teeth discoloration , stain restoration , undesirable taste , discoloration tongue , dryness burn sensation mouth discourage patient use mouth wash. Natural product prefer large proportion population report possess antimicrobial activity.These product recently show good alternative synthetic chemical substance caries prevention like Cinnamon Ginger . The aim study compare antimicrobial effect aqueous extract cinnamon 20 % ginger 20 % comparison chlorhexidine gluconate 0.2 % oral streptococcus mutans</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Cinnamon Ginger Comparison Chlorhexidine Gluconate 0.2 % Oral Streptococcus Mutans</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Sample Size Calculation The aim study compare antimicrobial effect aqueous extract cinnamon 20 % ginger 20 % comparison chlorhexidine gluconate 0.2 % oral streptococcus mutans . 2 way repeat measure analysis variance perform study effect different solution different time . Based previous paper , large effect size expect ( f=0.4 ) . minimum total sample size 18 patient ( 6 group ) sufficient power 85 % significance level 5 % . This number increase 21 compensate loss follow . The sample size calculate use G*Power program ( University Dusseldorf , Dusseldorf , Germany ) . Recruitment Patient recruit outpatient clinic conservative department explain benefit application intervention oral hygiene natural unlike chemical mouth rinse complication stain , burn sensation ; eligible patient recruit fulfill eligibility criterion . Randomization : Sequence generation : Randomization computer generate use ( www.randomization.com ) . Allocation concealment : Allocation rinse agent group do sealed black opaque envelope ensure complete concealment . Implementation : A third party perform allocation sequence assign participant rinse agent sequentially number opaque envelops . Blinding : The allocation group blind assess outcome , data collector , data analyst . The microbiologist blind label specimen non-identifying term . Data collection method : Baseline data collection : N.M collect baseline data chart compose medical , dental history clinical examination every patient fill . The report anonymous patient identify serial number ( first letter first last name date birth ) register . N.M write full detailed personal data patient separate sheet patient 's serial number contact patient , sheet see N.M. M.M . Outcome data collection : A microbiological technician ass viability count Mutans Streptococci patient saliva baseline 30 minute , one hour tow hour rinse . Patient retention : N.M. understand participant final result expect differ his/her oral hygiene . N.M. tell participant whole procedure take short time painless . Data management : Data entry carry N.M. revise M.M.. All data store computer encrypt use password . This do allow accurate data entry revision protect data incorrectly use . Data pack another storage device prevent lose . Statistical analysis : Data analyze use SPSS advanced statistic ( Statistical Package Social Sciences , version 21 ( SPSS Inc. Chicago . IL ) . Numerical data describe mean standard deviation median range . qualitative data describe number percentage . 2 way repeat measure analysis variance ( ANOVA ) perform . A p-value le equal 0.05 consider statistically significant . All test two tail . Data monitoring : H.H . monitor study . Her role monitor risk bias could do participant , operator assessor . Also monitor blind assessor patient safety , outstanding benefit harm . Harms : N.M. inform participant possible harm , present . Participants allow contact operator moment telephone . The data report N.M . Auditing : In present trial , audit do main co-supervisors ( H.H M.M ) assure quality research method intervention . Ethics dissemination Research ethic approval : Application form carry clinical trial , checklist informed consent Research Ethics Committee ( CREC ) Faculty Oral Dental Medicine , Cairo University retrieve fill , deliver ( CREC ) committee approval , do prevent ethical problem study harm participant . Protocol amendment : If new protocol use protocol amendment submit ; contain new copy new protocol brief explanation difference previous protocol . If change exist protocol affect safety subject , investigation scope scientific quality trial , amendment contain brief explanation change submit . If new author add accomplish study , amendment include investigator 's data qualification conduct investigation submit prevent ghost authorship . Consent assent : N.M. responsible admit signing informed consent enrollment day . Confidentiality : Name personal data participant appear protocol form maintain secure 10 year trial . This do protection participant ' privacy civil right . Declaration interest : There conflict interest , fund material supply party . Access data : Access final data allow operator N.M. main co-supervisors ( H.H . M.M . ) study involve assessment outcome . Ancillary post-trial care : Patients follow intervention harm material use . Dissemination policy : Full protocol publish online clinical trial website avoid repetition keep integrity research work . Thesis discuss front judgment committee . The study publish report result clinical trial .</detailed_description>
