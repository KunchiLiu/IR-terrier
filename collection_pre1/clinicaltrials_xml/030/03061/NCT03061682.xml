	<brief_summary>Age relate macular degeneration ( AMD ) lead cause vision loss patient older 55 year old . AMD present dry AMD wet AMD . In case AMD affect eye although many case 's asymmetrical far severity . Some patient require low vision aid continue daily life task . In past attempt make use low vision intraocular lens corrective glass without enough success . In addition telescopic prismatic lens also try . The difficulty lenses include low field vision , unsatisfactory magnification , complicate surgical technique high complication rate . Recently add lens design sulcus implantation pseudophakic AMD patient . The add lens double magnification central image dependent read distance anatomy eye . The lens acrylic hydrophobic design implantation sulcus either pseudophakic patient addition intraocular lens implant routine cataract surgery . The lens 13 mm wide 4 symmetric haptics . The lens 1.5 mm central part 10 diopter rest lens optical power . Our purpose study implantation lenses AMD patient improve read ability improve daily living .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Study design Prospective study implantation add lens AMD patient . The study approve Rabin medical center IRB . Patients examine best correct visual acuity prior surgery 6 meter read 40 15 cm . Improvement read ability 15 cm compare 40 cm predict potential vision improvement add lens . Before surgery patient full ophthalmological examination . Patients axial length keratometry examination use biometry . The lens implant surgery 2.2 mm clear cornea inject positioned sulcus . Patients follow 1 day , 1 week , 4 week , 4 6 month follow surgery . During follow patient undergo full ophthalmic exam well visual acuity distance near .</detailed_description>
