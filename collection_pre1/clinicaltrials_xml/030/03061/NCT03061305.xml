	<brief_summary>Many patient treat advanced cancer without knowledge underlie molecular feature might indicate FDA approved therapy potential eligibility biomarker-selected clinical trial . Strata Oncology initiate Strata Trial ( STR-001-001 ) primary goal understand proportion subject available clinical trial approve targeted therapy advance cancer assess feasibility use large-scale NGS screen program match subject eligibility assessment clinical trial and/or approve targeted therapy . The Strata Trial require additional procedure rather use surplus , leftover tumor specimen molecular profiling .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Profiling Biospecimens From Cancer Patients Screen Molecular Alterations Related Treatment Selection</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The Strata Trial precision oncology collaboration structure observational master screen protocol aim match patient genomically-guided therapeutic protocol and/or approve therapy . Subjects enrol Strata trial submit surplus , clinical formalin fix paraffin-embedded ( FFPE ) tumor specimens molecular profile test report provide back investigator . For subject identify molecular variant associate affiliated therapeutic protocol and/or approve targeted therapy , Strata report provide additional relevant information . All molecular profiling perform Strata Oncology CLIA-certified laboratory ( Ann Arbor , MI ) . The molecular profiling assay include target next generation sequencing ( NGS ) DNA RNA cover range actionable genomic variant , gene mutation ( e.g . EGFR BRAF ) , gene amplification ( e.g . ERBB2 ) gene fusion ( e.g . ALK ) . Subjects identify genetic alteration relevant trial target therapy follow treatment change three year time sign informed consent .</detailed_description>
	<criteria>Subjects must ≥ 18 year age . Subjects must histologically document solid tumor lymphoma . Subjects must measurable ( &gt; 10mm lesion ) metastatic disease ( i.e . Stage IV ) unresectable disease ( e.g . glioblastoma , Stage III pancreatic cancer ) Subjects must ECOG performance status ≤ 2 , see Appendix I . Subjects must adequate formalinfixed paraffinembedded tumor specimen genomic sequencing .</criteria>
