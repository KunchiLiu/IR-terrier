	<brief_title>Prospective Cohort Transitional Urology Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The care management pediatric patient congenital genitourinary anomaly transition adolescent later adult undergo period profound transformation . Due improvement surgical nonsurgical intervention , child diverse congenital disease affect genitourinary tract survive adulthood far high rate past . As example , 70-75 % child bear myelomeningocele consequent neurogenic bladder living past age twenty . These new expectation , especially area sexual function , fertility reproductive health , create previously unseen challenge health care provider attempt transition adolescent pediatric adult care . As patient population continue grow , transitional process urological care congenital anomaly progressively become topic vital importance . We plan advance adolescence clinical research care pioneer unique novel opportunity transitional care . This database help u : 1 . To develop revise ( necessary ) standard care treatment best practice patient transition adolescent congenital genitourinary malformation . 2 . To share evidence-based information physician across country , advance best practice secondary condition spina bifida , exstrophy , neurogenic bladder bowel , hydrocephalus . 3 . To implement benchmark improve care transitional urology clinic . 4 . Evaluate clinical cost-effectiveness care offer .</detailed_description>
