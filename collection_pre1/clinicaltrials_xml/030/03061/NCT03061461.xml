	<brief_summary>This study test hypothesis radial extracorporeal shock wave therapy ( rESWT ) perform Zoech ( JATROS Orthop 2009 ; ( 1 ) :46-47 ) effective safe treatment chronic soft tissue wound , statistically significantly effective sham-treatment chronic soft tissue wound .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Zoech ( 2009 ) treat feasibility study total n=18 patient affect 21 ulcer Stage IA IIA ( accord Armstrong colleague , Diabetes Care 1998 ; 21:855-859 ) repetitive radial extracorporeal shock wave therapy ( rESWT ) use Swiss DolorClast device ( Electro Medical Systems S.A. , Nyon , Switzerland ) . The wound observe 6 week . In nine case wound locate non-loaded area edge foot , appear previous toe amputation . In 12 case wound located sole , toe heel ; case average area wound 351 mm^2 ( 116 599 mm^2 ) . Local wound treatment consist regular debridement scalpel , follow disinfection sterile saline solution application wet treatment adequate stage wound . Depending amount secretion , depth ulcer heal stage , different bandage material use . Besides , rESWT apply interval depend size depth ulcer , twice week three six week , 1,000 impulse per cm^2 treatment session positive energy flux density ( EFD ) 0.1 mJ/mm^2 . To end ulcer cover sterile drape order avoid direct contact ultrasound jelly handpiece rESWT device ulcer . After disinfection sterile saline solution , bandage apply . The state ulcer document photographically regular interval size ulcer evaluate digital image analysis . Wounds evaluate first , second third week . Zoech ( 2009 ) note rESWT cause pain , neither local generalized infection observe throughout observation period . Sixteen 21 wound heal within mean period six week ( range : 3 9 week ) . In three case , sufficient granulation tissue form eight week average , allow wound cover gap tissue transplant . On average size ulcer reduce 67 % ( 20-100 % ) first week , 53 % ( 15-90 % ) second week 35 % ( 9-78 % ) third week compare baseline . These data indicate application repetitive rESWT use Swiss DolorClast low-effort effective complement standard therapy diabetic foot ulcer without sign infection ischemia . In study Zoech ( 2009 ) patient specifically satisfy good tolerability absence significant side effect . However , Zoech ( 2009 ) investigate control group . Accordingly , currently unknown whether rESWT perform Zoech ( 2009 ) effective sham-treatment chronic soft tissue wound . The present study design answer question .</detailed_description>
