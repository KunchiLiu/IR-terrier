	<brief_summary>INTRODUCTION Acute variceal bleeding ( AVB ) severe complication portal hypertension patient liver cirrhosis . The primary therapy include administration vasoactive drug , antibiotic endoscopic therapy ; preferably esophageal band ligation ( EBL ) and/or cyanoacrylate injection bleeding occur gastric varix . In context , idea ass `` Hemospray '' ( Cook Medical , Winston-Salem , NC ) initial therapy patient massive bleeding temporary `` bridge '' definitive treatment could institute . The data generate pilot study perform Erasme hospital , ULB TBRI , Cairo show add Hemospray early possible management step could increase bleed control rate 95 % 24 hour . OBJECTIVE The primary efficacy objective study ass efficacy Hemospray combination standard care ( SOC ) medical treatment compare efficacy SOC Control Arm patient acute variceal bleed cirrhotic patient . The primary safety objective study evaluate safety Hemospray use combination SOC compare SOC Control Arm . 1.1 . Secondary : - To evaluate effect time Hemospray treatment outcome bleed patient - To evaluate adverse effect therapeutic regimen ( SAEs clinically significant AEs ) .</brief_summary>
