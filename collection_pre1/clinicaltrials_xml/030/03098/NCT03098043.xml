	<brief_summary>In light widespread organ shortage , dynamic preservation mean Machine Perfusion ( MP ) propose strategy increase pool suitable graft liver transplantation . Reproducing physiological condition traditional Static Cold Storage ( SCS ) , MP may allow good preservation evaluation perhaps even resuscitation high risk graft . As consequence , unnecessary discard organ could avoid quality safety transplantation could improve well . Hypothermic MP ( HMP ) seem reduce ischemia-reperfusion injury . In fact , hypothermia slow metabolic rate oxygenation perfusate lead re-synthesis Adenosine TriPhosphate ( ATP ) , result restoration cellular energy . Four series use HMP clinical setting publish far . They report acceptable outcome transplantation human liver graft extend criterion Brain Dead Donors ( BDD ) Donation Circulatory Death ( DCD ) donor preserve HMP , thus prove feasibility safety . The efficacy HMP , instead , still investigation phase II randomize trial . This observational , prospective , monocentric study aim verify feasibility safety post-SCS Hypothermic Oxygenated PErfusion ( HOPE ) set liver transplant program . Extended criterion graft BDD graft DCD donor preserve post-SCS HOPE prior transplantation . The recipient graft followed-up least 1 year .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>This observational , prospective , monocentric study aim verify feasibility safety post-SCS HOPE set liver transplant program . 20 consecutive patient write informed consent enrol . They transplant graft extend criterion BDD DCD donor preserve post-SCS HOPE . The HOPE procedure perform operating room regular procurement , transport back-table preparation . University Wisconsin Machine Perfusion Solution ( UW-MPS ) use . Two pump provide dual pressure-controlled perfusion portal vein hepatic artery . Portal flow continuous adjust keep portal pressure 5 mmHg . Instead , arterial flow pulsatile regulate maintain arterial pressure 25 mmHg 30 mmHg . The perfusate oxygenate goal partial Pressure Oxygen ( PO2 ) 50-70 kilopascal . The perfusate temperature keep 4°C 12°C heat exchanger . pH , PO2 partial Pressure Carbon Dioxide ( PCO2 ) perfusate pump graft drain vena cava monitor . HOPE maintain 3 4 hour . Patients followed-up least 1 year accord schedule timetable . Data HOPE transplant procedure , donor recipient ' characteristic patient ' follow-up collect dedicated electronic Case Report Form ( eCRF ) accord Good Clinical Practice .</detailed_description>
