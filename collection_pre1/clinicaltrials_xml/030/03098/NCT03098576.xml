	<detailed_description>Targeted therapy study either label-use U.S. Food Drug Administration ( FDA ) approve drug clinical trial include investigational drug . Matched target therapy outcome compare outcome patient match treatment . In order find matched treatment , patient 's sample undergo test know `` gene chip algorithm . '' This do sample patient 's tumor analyze Cedars-Sinai Medical Center ( CSMC ) laboratory specialize molecular profiling . Molecular profiling process use study tumor 's genetic characteristic . DNA take tumor sample screen `` actionable gene . '' These gene call actionable mutation ( structural change ) gene FDA-approved match therapy eligible current clinical study .</detailed_description>
