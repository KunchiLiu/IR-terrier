	<brief_title>Low Tidal MEChanical Ventilation Against NO Ventilation During Cardiopulmonary Bypass Heart Surgery</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>BACKGROUND . Ventilator-acquired pneumonia ( VAP ) common postoperative complication account large part post-cardiac surgery morbidity mortality . Incidence VAP depend numerous factor , pulmonary collapsus atelectasis cardiopulmonary bypass , lower bronchial arterial blood flow systemic inflammation response syndrome cardiopulmonary bypass ( CPB ) . On one hand , CPB allow blood oxygenation cardiac surgery , regardless heartbeat oscillation , allow surgeon operate without disturbance . On hand , postoperative pulmonary complication appear frequent mechanical ventilation maintain CPB . Recent meta-analysis find oxygenation improvement wean CPB low-tidal-volume ( LTV ) ventilation maintain lung recruitment maneuver ( LRM ) , compare ventilation ( noV ) . Furthermore , maintain mechanical ventilation would reduce inflammation response tissue damage . The design study provide clinical hard endpoint respiratory complication , death length stay , hence , unquestionable standardize strategy lung protection CPB evidence time scientific recommendation whether mechanical ventilation maintain cardiac surgery , notably low-tidal volume ventilation ( LTV ) no-ventilation ( noV ) . The investigator aim prove superiority LTV noV strategy CPB cardiac surgery , order decrease postoperative respiratory complication . DESIGN . The MECANO trial single-center , double-blind , non-pharmacological , randomize control trial compare two mechanical ventilation strategy , LTV noV , cardiac surgery CPB . Population . All patient age 18 year eligible plan cardiac surgery CPB eligible . All patient provide write informed consent inclusion trial . Endpoints . Primary endpoint composite overall death , early respiratory failure define PaO2/FiO2 ratio &lt; 200 one-hour arrival ICU , heavy oxygenation support ( define patient require either non-invasive ventilation , mechanical ventilation high flow oxygen ) 2 day arrival ICU ventilator acquire pneumoniae define Center Disease Control . Secondary endpoint compose primary endpoint addition pneumothorax , CPB duration , volume postoperative bleeding , red blood cell transfusion , requirement revision surgery , length stay ICU hospital total hospitalization cost . Patients follow hospital discharge . Randomization . Patients randomized anesthesiologist arrive operating room , LTV noV arm , 1:1 ratio , use web software . Only anesthesiologist aware allocation arm order perform necessary ventilation strategy , however , physician outside operating room ( hence , study investigator ) aware treatment arm . Any deviation protocol record , reason deviation . Intervention . The noV group receive ventilation CPB . The LTV group receive 5 acts/minute tidal volume 3 mL/kg positive end-expiratory pressure 5 cmH2O . Lung recruitment maneuver perform group , end surgery , arrival ICU insufflation +30 cmH20 5 second . In ICU , ventilation strategy lung-protective : tidal volume=6 ml/kg ideal body weight , PEEP=5 cmH2O , FiO2 set obtain PaO2 200 250 mmHg , inspiration/expiration time ratio = 1:2 . Other therapeutic leave appreciation critical care medicine specialist . Data collection . All data record dedicated CRF . Preoperative data collect prior surgery ( age , height , weight , Euroscore 2 , smoke status , diabetes , peripheral arterial disease , pulmonary comorbidity , force expiratory volume one second , pulmonary infection past 30 day , creatininemia ) . Variables link surgery : type surgery , duration CPB , number red blood cell transfusion , number reason manual insufflation . Daily visit record temperature , PaO2 , FiO2 , ventilation mode , hemoglobinemia , leucocytemia , quantity bleeding endpoint list . Time event record well . Follow maintain hospital discharge . Statistical consideration Sample-size calculation base two-sided alpha error 0.05 80 % power . On basis respiratory insufficiency incidence cardiac surgery , investigator anticipate least 25 % patient present postoperative respiratory complication . A relative improvement incidence primary outcome 20 % 2 arm ( odd-ratio 0.8 favor LTV arm compare noV arm ) expect . The required sample size 720 patient per group , 1440 patient total . Accounting attrition ratio , 1500 patient include . Intermediary analysis perform . Data analysis . Patients analyze follow intention treat principle . Logistic regression perform statistical analysis . Relative risk 95 % confidence interval difference median 95 % confidence interval calculate appropriate . Two-sided significance test use throughout . The investigator infer subgroup effect interaction term treatment subgroup statistically significant P &lt; 0.05 .</detailed_description>
