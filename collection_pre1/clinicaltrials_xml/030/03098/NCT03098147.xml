	<brief_summary>Lower urinary tract symptom ( LUTS ) main symptom benign prostatic hyperplasia ( BPH ) , benign progressive disease advance overactive bladder ( OAB ) symptom . Moreover , LUTS OAB symptom badly influence patient ' especially elderly 's quality life . Therefore , appear urge carry research functional impairment bladder along advance BPH . Besides , management aim improve LUTS OAB symptoms come key one among management BPH . For long period , medication surgery sustain two common therapy BPH patient . Both patient urologist prefer pharmacotherapeutics surgery，which contributes rise number BPH patient companied OAB symptom store symptom complaint post-surgery . In fact , investigator usually find bladder impairment macroscopically BPH surgery : mild may trabeculation , bad cabin , severe may diverticula . Furthermore , 's uncommon patient long BPH history continually suffer dysuria surgery due detrusor muscle weakness . Consequently , investigator need catch moment investigator operate patient order harvest satisfy outcome . And perhaps moment ahead exist guideline suggest . Thus , understand influence BPH bladder function , investigator plan conduct prospective , case-control study recruit in-patients different degree obstruction . Our team wish clinical trail could provide valuable evidence u find relatively well operate time serial indication . For purpose improve quality life prolong life-span , investigator design study maximum operate outcome minimize bladder dysfunction .</brief_summary>
