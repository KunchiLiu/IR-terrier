	<brief_summary>Unwanted effect cardiovascular system one common cause safety related discontinuation drug . This study aim develop silico model human cardiovascular system use predict unwanted cardiovascular effect drug . This achieved drug administration study generate comprehensive pharmacokinetic pharmacodynamic data follow administration follow drug , know effect cardiovascular system . Half participant receive : Placebo , Salbutamol , Nicardipine , Dobutamine half receive Placebo , Phenylephrine , Verapamil , Phentolamine .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Study Pharmacokinetic Pharmacodynamic Responses Healthy Altered Human Cardiovascular Systems</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Safety integral part develop new medicine . Potential drug withdraw development stage process concern safety . In recent year , computer model recreate physiology increasingly adopt various aspect drug development , include safety , predict effect new drug . The accuracy predictive model however , dependent ability animal data ( model usually base ) 'translated ' human data . As animal identical human , difference specie need understood model accurate . Unwanted effect cardiovascular system one common cause safety related discontinuation drug . The present study focus generate high quality human cardiovascular data comparable exist animal data . This achieve collection detail pharmacokinetic pharmacodynamic data follow administration drug know affect cardiovascular system range mechanism . This first perform healthy participant extend pre-existing ( risk-factors ) cardiovascular disease . The aim understand difference specie study population use collect data help inform translational model build . Study Design : Single centre , single ( participant ) blind , within subject , drug administration study Drugs use study : 1 . Salbutamol - beta-2-adrenergic agonist 2 . Nicardipine - dihydropyridine calcium channel antagonist 3 . Dobutamine - beta-1-adrenergic agonist 4 . Phenylephrine - selective alpha-1-adrenergic agonist 5 . Verapamil - phenylalkylamine calcium channel antagonist 6 . Phentolamine - non-selective alpha adrenergic antagonist Study Population : The study take place three part ( A , B C ) , part represent population group interest . Part A ( 16 participant ) : Healthy individual identifiable cardiovascular risk factor recruit part study . The aim part enable collection physiological data drug administration 'normal ' cardiovascular system . Part B ( 8 participant ) : Part B involve recruitment participant may possess altered/challenged cardiovascular system . Participants recruit possess one follow factor : know diagnosis diabetes , know diagnosis hypertension , obesity ( BMI &gt; 30 ) , age &gt; 65 . The data collect provide information potential change baseline cardiovascular physiology may affect effect drug . Part C ( 8 participant ) : In order understand impact medicine cardiovascular physiology absence autonomic nervous system regulation , recruit participant dysfunction autonomic system Part C study . Maximum duration participation participant : 1x screening ( 1 hour duration ) , 4x study visit ( 8 hour duration ) minimum 72 hour gap visit . Maximum duration 4 month complete visit .</detailed_description>
