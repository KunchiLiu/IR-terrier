	<brief_summary>Physical activity delay all-cause mortality general population reduces risk cardiovascular disease ( CVD ) , stroke , type-2 diabetes type cancer ( Garber et al. , 2011 ) . These disease associate chronic inflammation , characterize activation inflammatory signal pathway abnormal production cytokine mediator ( Hotamisligil , 2006 ) . Observational study large population cohort consistently show association physical inactivity low-grade systemic inflammation interventional study reduction inflammatory marker follow exercise ( Beavers et al. , 2010 ) . Chronic inflammation also predominant feature treat human immunodeficiency virus ( HIV ) infection ( Lederman et al. , 2013 ; Deeks et al. , 2013 ) . Compared age-matched HIV-negative subject , person chronic HIV infection high risk develop non-acquired immune deficiency syndrome ( AIDS ) relate chronic disease ( Guaraldi et al. , 2011 ) , several study show association chronic inflammation high cardiovascular risk overall mortality ( Kuller et al. , 2008 , Duprez et al. , 2012 ) . Recently , investigator perform pilot study moderate physical activity enrol sedentary HIV infect subject treat combination antiretroviral treatment ( cART ) , consist brisk walking , without strength exercise . Overall , 12 week train cholesterol profile soluble cell inflammatory marker improve significantly . However , considerable individual variability exercise response , program physical activity need adjust individual basis effective . During recent year , use mobile technology implement health monitoring intervention , include exercise . We hypothesize use mobile application favour engagement exercise provide motivational input , therefore adherence , , consequence , improvement physical fitness .

	<detailed_description>STUDY DESIGN Multicentre , randomize , open-label , pilot study enrol HIV-infected subject , age ≥18 year , without cART , either sedentary already practice mild/moderate physical activity.+ Subjects satisfy inclusion exclusion criterion randomize 1:1 one follow arm : ) experimental group ( EG ) , participant train exercise program 16 week use smartphone application ; ii ) control group ( CG ) , participant train exercise program 16 week without smartphone application . You screen eligibility infectious disease specialist sport medicine specialist collection clinical treatment history , physical examination , routine blood screen , ECG rest submaximal cycle ergometer test . Eligible patient sign write informed consent followed-up screening , baseline ( start train program ) 16 week training , except profile mood state assess weekly Each study visit include : evaluation CDC stage , anthropometric assessment ( height , weight ) , systolic diastolic blood pressure , smoke status , assessment antiretroviral concomitant therapy routine laboratory test . Additional 30 mL peripheral blood withdrawn baseline end study ( week 16 ) store biobank investigation patient recruit San Raffaele Hospital . The demographic , clinical , physical fitness , quality life information accurately record study visit electronic Case Report Form ( eCRF ) . Randomization Randomization list computer-generated ( block size ten ) incorporate within electronic clinical report form ( eCRF ) study . Study participant , study nurse study physician aware allocation group allocation conceal laboratory staff . Discontinuation study You may withdraw consent time reason drop study discretion investigator he/she violate study plan administrative reason . You discontinue study : - withdraw consent - miss exercise session ≥ 2 consecutive week ( correspond 6 session ) . Any female patient become pregnant course study also immediately withdrawn study . Exercise program The exercise prescription schedule accord American College Sport Medicine guideline ( Garber et al. , 2011 ) . You perform 3 outdoor training session week 16 week , consist brisk walk run one hour . In group , participant assign volume intensity exercise . After baseline O2max examination , participant receive individual training program write exercise scientist ( MB , GP , ALT ) , design accord performance O2max examination . The exercise program divide two period . In first period ( week 1-4 ) subject train 60-70 % maximal heart rate improve aerobic metabolism capacity . Moreover , participant familiarize physical activity ( EG CG ) use mobile application ( EG ) direct coach supervision . In second period ( week 5-16 ) , participant train without direct coach supervision , follow individualized program design timeline . The EG participant receive automatic real-time feedback though application EG CG participant weekly feed-back trainer . During period exercise intensity , increase 70-80 % maximal heart rate . Training adherence Adherence program define proportion session attend 16-week training period calculate among participant complete study . Anthropometric Assessment The anthropometric assessment perform end program operator follow standardize technique describe Lohman ( 1981 ) . Anthropometric variable include body mass , stature , skinfold thickness dominant side . Stature body mass measure portable stadiometer scale near 0.5 cm 0.1 kg , respectively . Skinfolds take three time anatomic site use calliper ( Holtain Ltd , Crymych Uk ) near 0.2 mm . The average value obtain among three measure compute . Body density ( ) calculate use Jackson &amp; Pollock equation ( 1985 ) three skinfolds ( Female : triceps , suprailiac thigh ; Male : pectoral , abdominal thigh ) . The percentage fat mass finally derive : fat mass ( % ) = 495/ - 450 ( Siri et al. , 1961 ) . Physical Fitness Evaluation You instruct arrive laboratory rest fully hydrate state avoid strenuous exercise 24 h precede test session . In addition , avoid alcohol intake 48 h exercise test . All test carry well-ventilated laboratory temperature 20-22°C electromagnetically-braked cycle ergometer ( Monarc , Ergometric 893 , Finland ) . The protocol begin subject cycle 50 W 6 minute ; load increase 15 W minute volitional exhaustion . The peak value main cardiovascular , respiratory , metabolic parameter take high 30-s mean value attain subject 's volitional exhaustion . Oxygen consumption ( ) , carbon dioxide production ( ) , respiratory exchange ratio ( RER ) pulmonary ventilation ( ) measure breath-by-breath basis telemetric metabolimeter ( Quarkb2 , Cosmed , Rome , Italy ) . O2max assess accord criterion describe Taylor et al . Heart rate ( HR ) record whole test HR monitor ( Polar S810 , © Polar Electro 2011 , Kempele , Finland ) . The VT assess accord gas exchange method ( V-Slope ) .24 Briefly , break point v relationship detect consider VT. Then VT express percentage max . Rating Perceived Exertion The Borg 6-20 scale select rate perceive intensity exertion ( Borg , 1982 ) . A verbal-anchored scale show participant , immediately 30-min complete training session . Each subject familiarize use Borg 6-20 scale , include anchor procedure . Total Quality Recovery scale ( TQR ) Psychophysiological recovery process status check use Total Quality Recovery scale ( TQR ) ( Kenttä et al. , 1998 ) . Participants provide rating perceive quality recovery use scale 6 ( bad ) 20 ( best ) . A verbal-anchored scale show subject , morning training session . Each subject familiarize use TQR scale , include anchor procedure . Profile Mood State ( POMS ) The POMS questionnaire contain 32 item reflect individual 's mood five primary dimension ( i.e . depression , fatigue , vigour , tension anger ) . Subjects complete POMS individually week . The POMS data analyse specific dimension `` energy index '' calculate `` vigour-fatigue '' use monitor change energy balance . Quality life The SF-12 questionnaire derive Short-Form Health Survey ( 36-item ) . It patient-reported survey patient health ( Brazier et al. , 1992 ) . This questionnaire use evaluate participant 's perception QOL domains physical functioning , role limitation due physical health , emotional well-being , social function general health high score indicate great QOL . Nutrition The use daily food diary adopt assess nutritional habit participant ; diary fulfil least 3 day week ( 2 work day 1 day week-end ) patient request indicate name , amount cook method consume food seasoning ; beverage also include report . Diet quality diet variety index evaluate start food diary provide patient . Concomitant medication The use concomitant medications/therapies ( already ongoing might need prescribe study ) allow record . No specific restriction foreseen course study regard concomitant therapy vaccination . Laboratory analysis Blood examination include complete blood count ; standard biochemical exam fast total , high-density lipoprotein ( HDL ) low-density lipoprotein ( LDL ) cholesterol , triglyceride , glucose , insulin , glycated haemoglobin ( HbA1c ) ; cluster differentiation 4 ( CD4+ ) cluster differentiation 8 ( CD8+ ) T-cell count , HIV-1-RNA plasma level ( Abbott RealTime HIV-1 assay ) . The Homeostatic Model Assessment ( HOMA ) -I Veterans Aging Cohort Study Risk ( VACS ) index also calculate [ 15 ] . Inflammatory marker Soluble biomarkers measure cryopreserved plasma sample , drawn BL end program , commercially available enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay accord manufacturer ' recommendation . These include high-sensitivity C-reactive protein ( hsCRP , Catalog Number DCRP00 ) , interleukin-6 ( IL-6 , Catalog Number D6050 ) , D-dimer ( Asserachrom , Diagnostica Stago , Asnieres-Sur-Seine , France ) , interleukin-18 ( IL-18 ) ( Medical Biological Laboratories , Nagoya , Japan ) , myostatin ( Cusabio , China ) . Flow cytometry cell-activation marker measure cryopreserved peripheral blood mononuclear cell isolate Ficoll-Paque gradient EDTA-anticoagulated whole blood . After thaw PBS-washing , 3 x 105 cell stain use phycoerythrin ( PE ) -conjugated anti-HLA-DR , PE-cyanin red 5.1-conjugated anti-CD38 , Alexa Fluor 647-conjugated anti-CD3 , fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated anti-CD4 anti-CD8 ( BD-Biosciences , San Diego , CA ) . CD38+ HLA-DR+ cell gate CD3+/CD4+ CD3+/CD8+ cell 2-dimensional dot plot . Analyses perform FACSCalibur CellQuest software ( BD-Biosciences ) result report percentage CD3+/CD4+ CD3+/CD8+ T-cells express HLA-DR CD38 . For soluble inflammatory marker , sample analyse batch end study blindly respect group assignment . Sample size We estimate sample size 48 patient per group , total 96 subject would require order detect 30 % increase proportion subject improvement VO2max 16 week training , 40 % ( hypothesize control arm , i.e . use smartphone application ) 70 % ( hypothesize experimental arm , i.e . use smartphone application arm ) , 80 % power α 0.05 . As improvement VO2max directly correlate adherence training session , expect proportion experimental arm ( use smartphone application supervision ) might similar observe previous paper ( Bonato et al. , 2016 ) , report adherence exercise program supervision professional coach find 67 % . On contrary , absence training supervision ( control group ) expect low adherence , i.e . 40 % . As accrual number subject feasible , plan enrol 60 patient .</detailed_description>
