	<brief_title>Comparison Efficacy Safety Between Methylene Blue-mediated Photodynamic Therapy 5 % Amorolfine Nail Lacquer Toenail Onychomycosis Treatment</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>• Research Design Randomized , single-blind clinical trial • Research Methodology Target population - 42 Patients , age 18-90 year old , distal lateral subungual toenail onychomycosis diagnose clinically mycologically - Patients recruit Dermatology clinic , King Chulalongkorn Memorial Hospital - Exclusion criterion 1 . Those nail change skin disease associate systemic disease 2 . Those previously use anti-fungal medication within 3 month systemic 1 month topical therapy . - Methods 1 . Patients inform detail study include predict possible adverse event due treatment primary aid . 2 . They include stratify randomly poor prognostic factor , divide two group ( A : methylene blue-mediated photodynamic therapy ( MB-PDT ) B : 5 % Amorolfine Nail Lacquer block randomization size 4 6 . 3 . For 24 week , - Group A - The use PDT consist 6 treatment session interval 15 day session - Patient instruct apply 40 % urea cream occlusive dress 5 day prior PDT . - Group B - Patients detailed instruction regard use 5 % Amorolfine Nail Lacquer recommend protocol . - Total duration follow-up 18 month Evaluation tool - Nail photograph use dermoscope onychomycosis severity index ( OSI ) evaluation - Either Scrape nail clipping , positive prior treatment , perform microscopic study culture . - Safety assessed adverse event . - Patients ' satisfaction evaluate end treatment .</detailed_description>
