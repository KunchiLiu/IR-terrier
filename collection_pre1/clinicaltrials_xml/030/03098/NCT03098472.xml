	<brief_summary>Delirium syndrome acute brain dysfunction involve attention cognition affect half old hospitalize patient 50 % -75 % critically ill ICU patient , million patient worldwide experience acute threat health well every year . One-third half critical illness survivor struggle dementia-like disorder similar severity moderate-to-severe traumatic brain injury Alzheimer 's Disease , proven risk factor potentially modifiable delirium ICU . Despite frequency impact delirium ICU , little known regard biological mechanism lead form organ dysfunction critical illness . A widely hold hypothesis propose inflammation regulate cholinergic system , interaction play pivotal role whether delirium development set acute illness . Acetylcholinesterase ( AChE ) butyrylcholinesterase ( BuChE ) enzymes hydrolyze neurotransmitter acetylcholine . Changes activity enzymes , measure whole blood , reflect alter regulation circulate acetylcholine . AChE BuChE activity promise predictor delirium ( find low admission ) biomarkers delirium ( low serial measurement ) . Neither biomarkers , however , study ICU set delirium risk high . The current investigation , therefore first determine validity circulate AChE BuChE activity biomarkers delirium critical illness subsequent cognitive impairment discharge . This study measure whole blood AChE butyrylcholinesterase BuChE activity within framework ICU Delirium Cognitive Impairment Study Group 's ongoing clinical trial critically ill patient .</brief_summary>
