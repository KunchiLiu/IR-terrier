Aims : 1 ) To determine test characteristic UTDT diagnosis PEP 2 hour completion ERCP . 2 ) To identify describe patient baseline UTDT positivity , test offer limited utility . Specific Aims : Primary Aim 1.1 To determine test characteristic ( sensitivity specificity ) UTDT diagnosis PEP : Hypotheses : 1 . UTDT sensitive specific test diagnosis PEP patient undergo ERCP . 2 . At cutpoint negative test &lt; 50ug/L , UTDT accurate 2 hour post ERCP patient whose baseline test negative . Secondary AIM : 1.1 To identify describe patient baseline UTDT positivity . Hypothesis : 1 ) A subgroup patient demonstrate baseline positivity UTDT . Based previous study , subgroup likely include patient chronic inflammatory obstructive condition pancreatic duct ( pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma , obstructive chronic pancreatitis ) 1 This subgroup represent minority ( &lt; 6 % ) outpatients present ERCP . 1 Patients recruit pre-procedure area prior ERCP . Only patient would offer ERCP part previously outline care plan include study . Patients screen accord inclusion/exclusion criterion describe . Study Procedures Informed Consent : Eligible patient sign IRB-approved , write informed consent verify willingness participate study . Informed consent obtain day schedule ERCP . Consent study obtain one participate endoscopists and/or research assistant . Patients receive copy sign date informed consent document . Original informed consent document maintain on-file . A note may make subject 's medical record regard participation research study . Once consent enrolled trial , patient issue unique identifier purpose data entry . Pre-Procedure data sample collection : After obtain informed consent , patient ask health question prior ERCP ass quantify current prior alcohol use , current prior tobacco use , quantification narcotic use quantification non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug ( NSAID ) use . Narcotic NSAID use 7 day prior ERCP record . Pain score collect baseline post ERCP . Subjects show study pain scale ( appendix 1 ) ask pick number scale rate pain baseline 2-3 hour ( + - 15 minute time Scope ) post ERCP . Data collect indication ERCP , history acute pancreatitis , recurrent acute pancreatitis , chronic pancreatitis , history pancreatic surgery , presence peri-pancreatic fluid collection prior sphincterotomy . Prior imaging may review presence pancreatic mass and/or pancreatic duct obstruction . Baseline test may obtain prior undergoing ERCP include serum pancreatic enzyme ( amylase , lipase ) , serum liver enzyme , coagulation profile standard endoscopy unit . Available outpatient laboratory data within 48-72 hour ERCP review . Lack baseline lab criterion exclusion study . Patients baseline , pre-procedure positivity UTDT ( &gt; = 50ug/L ) undergo study procedure outline exception 2 hour UTDT level . Patients unable provide urine sample post ERCP testing still include final analysis baseline UTDT level . Subjects exclude due inability access ampulla ERCP also still Included final analysis baseline UTDT level . Intra-procedural Data Collection : Patients undergo ERCP intend . All clinical decision endoscopic intervention prior , ERCP perform discretion treat physician . Data duration procedure , placement pancreatic biliary duct stent , ERCP maneuver deploy cannulation ( e.g . needle knife ) , finding associate chronic pancreatitis ( e.g pancreatic duct stone ) , pancreatic duct leak , peri-procedural NSAIDs administration , amount intraoperative IV fluid immediate complication include perforation , bleeding , hemodynamic instability record . Immediate Postoperative Care , Data Sample collection : At institution , patient typically remain recovery area 2-3 hour completion ERCP . This time interval part relate two-phase recovery general anesthesia , standard sedation approach ERCP outpatient . Patients remain recovery ERCP least two hour post procedure observation period collection UTDT result . During time , urine sample UTDT test collect 2 -3 hour ( + - 15 minute time Scope ) ERCP study research technician . Patients , study investigator , ERCP care team , nurse staff blind result . The statistician blind urine trypsinogen-2 test statistical analysis . The decision admit/monitor patient leave discretion endoscopist / ERCP care team occur blind UTDT result . Data regarding symptom ( e.g . nausea/vomiting , abdominal pain score ) , narcotic administer pain symptom , duration recovery , volume IV fluid administer recovery decision admit discharge record . Patients receive risk assessment post-ERCP pancreatitis . This calculated tracked purpose study . Follow Up Data Collection : Patients hospitalize serum amylase lipase drawn ERCP procedure per standard clinical protocol timeline . Patients discharge home/other ERCP contact telephone and/or email 5 day ( + 4 day - 2 day ) 30 day ( + - 10 day ) ERCP study team member determine whether PEP occur manage outside institution . Patients ask ERCP procedure complication infection , bleeding , perforation death . This contact may make phone , email text message . Subjects ask preferred method contact study enrollment . Records confirm post ERCP pancreatitis request patient admit and/or initially manage outside institution PEP . Patients without hospitalization symptom attributable post ERCP pancreatitis classify developed PEP . Records pertain ERCP procedure complication also request . PEP define primary ERCP team . The ERCP team blind UTDT result determine PEP . Clinical data regard volume IV fluid administer 24 , 48 hour admission severity pancreatitis ( base Cotton criterion , Modified Marshall Score grade presence necrosis ) assess record patient admit PEP .</detailed_description>
