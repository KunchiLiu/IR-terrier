However , impact e-cigarette flavoring nicotine withdrawal symptom currently unknown . This behavioral pharmacology laboratory experiment ass whether sweet ( vs. non-sweet ) flavor e-cigarette solution reduce tobacco withdrawal symptom motivation smoke among 40 smoker interested try e-cigarettes ( first time ) follow 16-hours nicotine abstinence . At visit , participant complete standardize e-cigarette administration procedure , develop prior work , flavor manipulate double-blind , cross-over , counterbalance design . Following e-cigarette administration , participant complete : 1 ) self-report measure nicotine withdrawal symptom ; 2 ) physiological measurement 3 ) behavioral task measure participant ' ability resist desire resume smoke condition advantageous remain abstinent ( i.e. , monetary payment successive 5-min increment smoke delay ) . The study 's experimental design provide evidence causal effect e-cigarette flavoring putatively critical factor determine whether smoker continue e-cigarette use initial trial—the ability product suppress withdrawal motivation smoke period tobacco deprivation .</detailed_description>
