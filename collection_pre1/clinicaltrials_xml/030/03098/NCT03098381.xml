	<brief_summary>One religious duty healthy adult Muslims fast Ramadan , ninth month Islamic lunar calendar . In month , Ramadan observance fast ( food drink ) dawn dusk . Studies demonstrate daytime fasting may pose positive significant effect metabolic health . Thus , present study aim determine effect Ramadan fasting body composition , metabolic profile , serum leptin adiponectin level healthy men .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Alteration Body Composition Metabolic Profile During Ramadan Fasting Healthy Men</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Outcome measurement take ( baseline ) end Ramadan ( Ramadan fast ) body composition , metabolic profile ( fast plasma glucose , insulin , total cholesterol , HDL-c , LDL-c , triglyceride , HOMA-IR ) , serum leptin adiponectin , ratio leptin adiponectin 27 healthy men ( 19-31 year ) Muslim Bangkok , Thailand . Subjects Twenty-nine subject fulfil inclusion criterion include : age 19-40 year , Muslim men fast completely , know metabolic-related disease . Subjects diseases and/or intake medication dietary supplement , smoking , alcohol drinking exclude . After Ramadan fasting , 27 subject complete study . The study protocol approve Ethical Review Committee Research Involving Human Research Participants , Health Science Group , Chulalongkorn University , Bangkok , Thailand ( COA . 136/2558 ) .Written inform consent obtain subject prior enrol study . Subject 's anonymity preserve . Study design Research visit conduct Faculty Allied Health Sciences , Chulalongkorn University , Bangkok , Thailand ( earlier day Ramadan ) ( third week Ramadan ) collect outcome measurement include anthropometry , body composition , metabolic profile , serum leptin adiponectin level , ratio leptin adiponectin . The dietary intake 2 weekday one weekend day physical activity record week Ramadan food record booklet . Energy intake macronutrients composition include carbohydrate , protein fat analyse registered dietitian . Anthropometry body composition measurement Weight , Body Mass Index ( BMI ) , percent body fat measure baseline ( week-0 ) end Ramadan fasting period ( week-4 ) . Body weight , percent body fat mass assess use constant current source high frequency current ( 50kHz , 500μA ) -bioelectrical impedance analyzer ( BIA ) ( MC-980MA body composition analyzer , TANITA corporation , Tokyo , JAPAN ) . The subject request dress light attire bare foot . The 8 polar electrode position electric current supply electrode tip toe foot fingertip hand , voltage measure heel foot near side hand . Body Mass Index ( BMI ) calculate weight/height2 ( kilogram per square meter ) . Waist hip circumference measure use standard round tape point right iliac crest mid-axillary line minimal respiration ( waist ) horizontal plane level maximal extension buttock ( hip ) near 1.0 cm . Metabolic profile measurement Fasting blood sample take vein puncture period Ramadan fasting . Separated serum sample store - 80o C analysis perform . After withdrawal , blood sample collect determine metabolic profile include plasma glucose , total cholesterol , high density lipoprotein-cholesterol ( HDL-c ) , triglyceride ( TG ) enzymatic method serum insulin level analyze Chemiluminescence . Low density lipoprotein-cholesterol ( LDL-c ) estimate use Friedewald equation ( LDL-c = [ total cholesterol ] - [ HDL-c ] - [ TG ] /5 ) .22 Additionally , HOMA-IR measure fast serum insulin ( µIU/mL ) x fast plasma glucose ( mmol/L ) /22.5.23 Serum leptin adiponectin measurement Serum leptin adiponectin level assay laboratory Faculty Allied Health Sciences , Chulalongkorn University . Serum leptin measure use commercially `` Human Leptin Standard ABTS ELISA Development kit '' ( Peprotech , Inc. , Rocky Hill , NJ , USA , Cat . : 900-K90 ) wavelength 405nm correction set 650nm , serum adiponectin measure use `` Adiponectin ( human ) ELISA kit '' ( Enzo Life Sciences , Farmingdale , NY , USA , Cat . : ALX-850-377 ) wavelength 450nm correction set 630nm . Both serum leptin adiponectin measure enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay , carry accord manufacturer 's procedure . Statistical Analysis Data express frequency percentage descriptive ; mean ± standard error mean ( SEM ) , mean percentage change ( % change ) ± SEM continuous-normally distribute data ; median ( range ) continuous-non normally distribute data . Paired student t-test , two related sample ( Wilcoxon ) test employ comparison normally distribute non-normally distribute data , respectively . Differences consider statistically significant two-tailed probability value P le 0.05 . All analysis perform use SPSS , version 16.0 ( IBM , Chicago , IL , USA ) .</detailed_description>
