	<brief_summary>Clinical study CD19 CAR-T cell treatment blood lymphatic system tumor achieve unprecedented success . Because heterogeneity tumor , patient often carry CD19-negative tumor cell clone express alternative target antigen ( CD22 , CD20 CD123 ) . In order effectively eradicate tumor clone prevent recurrence , alternative tumor antigen besides CD19 consider CAR-T cell target . In tudy , autologous T cell genetically modify 4th generation anti-CD19 anti-CD22 CARs ( 4SCAR19/22 ) use lentiviral vector . For safety consideration , 4SCAR engineer inducible caspase 9 self-withdrawal genetic design allow rapid elimination infuse CAR-T cell . Interleukin-2 show boost immune response leukemia cell . The serum interleukin-6 level monitor return normal range day 28 CAR-T cell infusion , patient receive subcutaneous injection interleukin-2 , evaluate 24 month safety , efficacy persistence CAR T cell .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Interleukin-2 Following 4SCAR19/22 T Cells Targeting Refractory and/or Recurrent B Cell Malignancies</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Objectives : 1 . Primary Outcome Measures : 1 . Evaluate frequency severity adverse event , include , limited , cytokine release syndrome ( CRS ) [ Time Frame : From date dosing ( day 1 ) 50 week ] 2 . Evaluate grade 3 high toxicity rate patient ( toxicity possibly attribute 4SCAR19/22 T cell ) 3 . Evaluate safety effect administration 4SCAR19/22 T cell follow interleukin-2 treat pediatric patient relapse refractory B cell malignancy . 2 . Secondary : 1 . Evaluate Overall Complete Remission Rate ( ORR ) . 2 . Evaluate overall response rate include complete remission ( CR ) complete remission incomplete blood count recovery ( CRi ) . 3 . Evaluate duration remission ( DOR ) . 4 . To evaluate incidence treatment effect cytokine release syndrome ( CRS ) . 5 . To determine expansion functional persistence 4SCAR19/22 T cell peripheral blood patient correlation antitumor effect ; Design : 1 . In single-center , open-label , nonrandomized , control , prospective clinical trial , total 30 patient resistant refractory B cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia ( ALL ) non-hodgkin 's lymphoma ( NHL ) enrol . Patients ALL diagnose accord bone marrow morphology , immunophenotype , cytogenetic molecular examination . Patients NHL diagnose accord bone marrow morphology , biopsy pathology image examination . 2 . Peripheral blood mononuclear cell ( PBMC ) obtain apheresis , T cell activate modified express 4SCAR-CD19/22 gene . 3 . On Day -2 -7 , PBMC activate enriched T cell , follow 4SCAR-CD19/22 lentiviral transduction . The total culture time approximately 5-7 day . 4 . Patients receive lymphodepleting chemotherapy compose cyclophosphamide fludarabine prior cell infusion , 5 . Participants receive CAR-T cell total dose 0.5-5x10^6/kg . 6 . Participants receive regular subcutaneous injection interleukin-2 250,000iu/m^2 every day 2 week rest 2 week 6 month serum interleukin-6 level return normal range day 28 CAR-T cell infusion . 7 . Patients monitor toxicity include cytokine release syndrome , hematologic toxicity B-cell aplasia , response underlying malignancy CAR-T cell persistence blood , marrow cerebral spinal fluid ( CSF ) .</detailed_description>
