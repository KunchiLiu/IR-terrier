	<brief_summary>The study aim improve care obstetric population cesarean section improve total patient satisfaction improve post-surgical pain control use dexamethasone combination bilateral TAP block . The investigator utilize dose-escalation dexamethasone TAP block observe effect specific small dos . It hope investigator studied technique would become utilized routinely obstetric population follow cesarean section . The investigator hope show addition dexamethasone bilateral TAP block prolong duration block dose-dependent fashion . The investigator hope improve post-operative pain follow cesarean section , increase duration TAP block use dexamethasone , decrease overall pain score first 24-48 hour , decrease opioid requirement cesarean section . The primary endpoint estimation duration TAP block , assess within 48 hour surgery . Secondary endpoint include pain score PACU floor , average pain score , time first opioid administration , total opioid consumption first 48 hour , use PONV medication , overall patient satisfaction .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Preoperatively : informed consent obtain member study . The patient screen inclusion/exclusion criterion day procedure , participant randomize one three group . Intraoperatively : The anesthesia team involve care patient operate room provide routine anesthesia care cesarean section include neuraxial anesthesia intrathecal bupivacaine morphine . After completion procedure , patient receive bilateral TAP block procedure still OR . All block include 20mL 0.5 % ropivacaine , patient randomly assign specific dose dexamethasone 0mg ( give normal saline control ) , 2mg , 4mg . The resident attend physician supervise block investigator study , along resident perform block blind amount dexamethasone injectate . Postoperatively : The patient monitor PACU approximately 30-60 minute subsequently monitor inpatient floor . Pain score , time first opioid dose , total opioid requirement assess record . In PACU , record every 15-30 minute . On inpatient floor , record every 6 hour . Pain score , average pain score first 48 hour , total opioid consumption , time first opioid use , PONV medication requirement also record . These record review electronic medical record . Satisfaction score estimation TAP block duration assess record anesthesia personnel approximately 48 hour post-operatively ; subjective evaluation record 24-38 hour postoperatively . The patient ask estimate long felt block last . For satisfaction score , patient rate satisfaction subjectively scale 1-10 . Statistical Analysis : demographic clinical variable continuous measure express mean standard deviation ; categorical factor express proportion . For non-normal data , median inter quartile range display . The distribution continuous factor examine use Kolmogorov-Smirnov test . For data normally distribute , one-way ANOVA use compare group data . For data normally distribute , Kruskal-Wallis test use comparison . Chi-square Fisher 's exact test use analyze categorical data . For comparison , value p &lt; 0.05 consider statistically significant . Statistical analysis perform use SAS Windows , version 9.2 . One-way ANOVA ( Kruskal-Wallis test , appropriate ) use compare duration TAP block three group . Linear regression also use test relationship duration block dexamethasone dose , control relevant clinical demographic variable . One-way ANOVA ( Kruskal-Wallis test ) use compare group post-operative pain score , opioid requirement , patient satisfaction score . Statistical Power Sample Size Estimates : Approximately 69 subject ( 23 per group ) expect enrolled study . Given sample size assume average duration TAP block 18 hour control group , 22 hour 2 mg dexamethasone group , 24 hour 4 mg dexamethasone group , study approximately 80.9 % power detect difference block duration , assume common standard deviation 6 hour . If variability block time small 6 hour , study great power .</detailed_description>
