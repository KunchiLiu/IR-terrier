	<brief_summary>Parkinson 's disease ( PD ) neurodegenerative disease cause Lewy body deposition central peripheral nervous system . The main symptom include motor non motor symptom bradykinesia , rigidity , rest tremor , postural instability , autonomic dysfunction neuropsychiatric symptom . Moreover , PD symptoms occur daytime , also nighttime . The nighttime symptoms nocturnal symptom make patient disable well daytime symptom . The bradykinesia occur nighttime call nocturnal hypokinesia also make many serious consequence bedsore , fall aspiration death . In study , investigator aim study effect rotigotine transdermal patch compare placebo mainly aspect nocturnal hypokinesia .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Rotigotine Effect Nocturnal Hypokinesia Compares Placebo Control : A Quantitative Assessment Wearable Sensors</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The investigator recruit PD patient history nocturnal hypokinesia randomize run number ( blind ) 2 group include active placebo group . Baseline demographic , disease characteristic , nocturnal questionnaire wearable nocturnal sensor data collect drug titration . In active group , participant receive rotigotine transdermal patch titration 2 mg/day maximum dosage participant side effect 16 mg/ day every week . In placebo group , participant would get placebo patch titration active group . After participant get maintenance dosage , participant would get physical examination , nocturnal questionnaire wearable nocturnal sensor study .</detailed_description>
