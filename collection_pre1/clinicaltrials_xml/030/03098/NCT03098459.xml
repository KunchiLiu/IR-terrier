	<detailed_description>Cognitive skill crucial ability require manage money , maintain employment , live independently . Long-term cognitive impairment ( LTCI ) disable loss skill persist month year . LTCI frequently occur primary brain injury ( e.g. , traumatic brain injury , hypoxia ) , old LTCI research characterize primary brain injury use NIH Common Data Elements Imaging , contribution polytrauma , time-course critical illness , include secondary brain injury ( i.e. , delirium ) . In recent large study ICU patient without primary brain injury , 50 % patient LTCI nearly 50 % newly unemployed one-year post-discharge . In-hospital delirium major independent risk factor LTCI . Surprisingly , delirium-related LTCI similar LTCI see past study moderate traumatic brain injury . Thus , primary secondary brain injury associate LTCI , yet study together . There unmet need define independent risk primary brain injury delirium LTCI . The trauma ICU patient combine risk primary brain and/or multisystem injury , secondary brain injury , critical illness ; critically injured patient unique population address knowledge gap . Therefore , FIRST HYPOTHESIS delirium duration independent risk severity LTCI , control confounders co-morbidities , socioeconomic status , pre-injury employment , primary brain injury , polytrauma , critical illness . AIM 1 address hypothesis define independent risk primary secondary brain injury severity LTCI among 900 trauma ICU subject . But , LTCI 's real-world impact employment explain adjusted confounders social factor . Accordingly , SECOND HYPOTHESIS LTCI severity independent risk low level employment , adjust similar confounders . AIM 2 delineate independent risk LTCI severity employment among trauma ICU survivor . Lastly , LTCI pathogenesis may relate persistent inflammation . So , THIRD HYPOTHESIS hospital discharge biomarkers persistent inflammation independent risk LTCI severity , adjust similar confounders . AIM 3 explore mechanistic role plasma inflammatory biomarkers LTCI severity among trauma ICU survivor .</detailed_description>
