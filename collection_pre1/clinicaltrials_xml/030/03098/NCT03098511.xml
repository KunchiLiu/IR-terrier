	<brief_summary>For purpose organ donation neurological determination death ( NDD ) , death must declare use set standardized clinical criterion . When full clinical evaluation complete , additional neuroimaging ancillary testing require . The ideal ancillary test NDD would demonstrate cerebral blood flow , free false-positive false negative result , rapid , safe , readily available , non-invasive , inexpensive . No current ancillary test NDD meet criterion . Computed tomography ( CT ) perfusion characteristic ideal test NDD , evaluate routine clinical use NDD . The overarch goal project improve NDD process establish CT-perfusion ideal ancillary test . A large prospective Canadian multi-centre diagnostic cohort study conduct validate CT-perfusion neurological determination death . Specific objective : Primary objective : To determine diagnostic accuracy CT-perfusion compare complete clinical evaluation NDD . Secondary objective : 1 ) To confirm safety perform CT-perfusion critically ill patient suspect neurologically decease ; 2 ) To establish CT-perfusion inter-rater reliability NDD ; 3 ) To evaluate diagnostic accuracy CT-angiography compare complete clinical evaluation CT-perfusion NDD ; 4 ) To describe clearance commonly use sedative narcotic set NDD ; 5 ) investigate biological change ( inflammatory nanovesicles ) occur human brain die process .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>CT-Perfusion Neurological Diagnostic Evaluation</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The investigator conduct large prospective Canadian multi-centre diagnostic cohort study . The primary diagnostic test evaluate CT-perfusion . The reference standard complete clinical evaluation brainstem function . Comatose patient high risk neurological death exempt confound factor ( e.g . hypothermic patient , use long-acting sedative , etc . ) include . All patient undergo CT-perfusion head ( CT-angiography reconstruction ) follow complete NDD assessment . Both CT-perfusion clinical exam perform independent assessor blind others ' interpretation . The primary endpoint sensitivity specificity CT-perfusion confirm NDD . Safety endpoints CT-perfusion -related adverse event ( i.e . contrast-induced kidney injury , new hemodynamic instability undergo CT-perfusion ) . The true negative , true positive , false negative false positive CT-angiography obtain CT-perfusion source image compare reference standard well compare CT-Perfusion also report . The sensitivity specificity CT-angiography compare reference standard CT-perfusion along correspond 95 % confidence interval calculate . Individual patient population pharmacokinetics analgesics sedative determine . To well investigate impact residual circulate sedative narcotic level accuracy CT-Perfusion CT-Angiography , Receiver Operating Characteristics ( ROC ) curve vary level narcotic sedative threshold compute ROC area curve threshold plot . To assess immune phenotype , peripheral blood mononuclear cell activation evaluate flow cytometry cytokine multiplex analysis . Nanovesicles fraction isolate plasma ultracentrifugation antigenic content enzymatic activity . The plasma finally analyse ELISAs multiplex analysis determine level pro-inflammatory cytokine .</detailed_description>
