	<brief_summary>Context rationale : Antibody-mediated rejection lead cause long-term renal graft loss . It 's due production recipient antibody direct antigen ( belong HLA system ) present surface donor specific endothelial cell ( DSA ) , lead graft failure . The main difficulty manage humoral rejection delay diagnosis treatment slow evolution towards fibrosis . Positivity anti-HLA antibody main risk factor rejection way make diagnosis humoral rejection perform graft biopsy , invasive process . Endothelial microparticles ( MPE ) small membrane vesicle generate endothelial cell activation / apoptosis process . We test hypothesis endothelial microparticles early diagnostic biomarker humoral rejection renal transplantation allow detect `` subclinical '' stage . Primary secondary objective : The main objective study estimate performance MPE plasma concentration diagnosis humoral rejection renal transplant patient DSA . The secondary objective investigate mass spectrometry MPEs specific endothelium graft evaluate diagnostic performance relation non-specific MEPs Methodology : We conduct cross-sectional evaluation diagnostic method collection biological sample .

	<detailed_description>Context rationale : Antibody-mediated rejection lead cause long-term renal graft loss . It 's due production recipient antibody direct antigen ( belong HLA system ) present surface donor specific endothelial cell ( DSA ) , bind activate renal endothelium responsible inflammation lead fibrosis graft destruction . The main obstacle management humoral rejection delay diagnosis treatment slow evolution towards fibrosis . At begin process `` apparent '' dysfunction graft ( elevation serum creatinine / proteinuria ) inflammation renal parenchyma : refer `` subclinical '' humoral rejection . Graft dysfunction occur inflammation serious responsible irreversible lesion fibrosis . New sensitive detection technique anti-HLA antibody allow detect DSA well onset humoral rejection way make diagnosis humoral rejection perform graft biopsy , invasive process hemorrhagic risk repeat frequently . Endothelial microparticles ( MPE ) small membrane vesicle generate endothelial cell activation / apoptosis process . An increase level circulate blood appear today endothelial dysfunction many pathology . Their role humoral rejection , model endothelial dysfunction , never explore . We wish test hypothesis endothelial microparticles early diagnostic biomarker humoral rejection renal transplantation allow detect `` subclinical '' stage . Primary secondary objective : The main objective study estimate performance MPE plasma concentration diagnosis humoral rejection renal transplant patient DSA . The secondary objective investigate mass spectrometry MPEs specific endothelium graft evaluate diagnostic performance relation non-specific MEPs Methodology : We conduct cross-sectional evaluation diagnostic method collection biological sample . The gold standard diagnosis humoral rejection histological diagnosis graft biopsy . The new test study flow cytometric assay MPE concentration carry plasma take day graft biopsy . Feasibility : Among active list renal transplant patient attend Montpellier University Hospital , estimate include number subject require ( N = 250 ) 18 month . This work carry laboratory tool technique use , particular flow cytometry mass spectrometry , perfectly master realize dedicated technical platform Benefits / Outlook : At time shortage organ grow becomes real public health problem , become essential good control management humoral rejection , main cause long-term renal graft loss . One key step step find non-invasive early diagnostic biomarker detect humoral rejection `` subclinical '' stage order set adapt treatment quickly possible .</detailed_description>
