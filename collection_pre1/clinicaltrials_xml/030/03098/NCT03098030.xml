	<brief_summary>This 2-part , multicenter , open-label , randomize study dinutuximab irinotecan versus irinotecan alone subject relapse refractory small cell lung cancer ( SCLC ) . Part 1 study involves intrasubject dose escalation evaluate safety tolerability dinutuximab combination irinotecan . Part 2 study design determine whether dinutuximab plus irinotecan prolongs overall survival ( OS ) compare irinotecan alone . Subjects Part 2 randomized 2:2:1 fashion 1 3 treatment group : ( A ) irinotecan ; ( B ) dinutuximab plus irinotecan ; ( C ) topotecan . Randomization stratify duration response prior platinum therapy ( relapse-free period &lt; 3 month ≥3 month ) .</brief_summary>
