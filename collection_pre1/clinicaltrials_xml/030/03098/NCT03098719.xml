	<detailed_description>The World Health Organization recommend minimum 150 minute per week moderate activity minimum healthy daily routine . The average employee Austria work 5 day week cover distance place residence place work twice . This distance actively travel ( e.g. , bicycle ) passively ( e.g. , car ) . Due moderate physical activity ( intensity 4-6 METs , correspond 4-6 time rest energy conversion ) 15 minute one direction , active minimum requirement everyday activity would achieve active mobility workplace . Design : 2 : 1 randomize control trial ( intervention group : control group ) Activities : Motivation employee health care professional sample company ( Salzburger Landeskrankenanstalten AG , SALK ) use public transport well bicycle footpath way workplace . Intervention A : Change car bicycle least 50 % route , n = 20-25 Employees previously travel exclusively car living within radius â‰¤10 kilometer workplace motivate GVPs switch bicycle . In case appropriate proximity , employee travel entire path without motorized mobility . The great health benefit expect largely dispense motorize mobility work . In case bad weather , cold similar obstacle , public transport car use occasionally exceptionally . Intervention B : Exit public transport one station earlier enter one station later , n = 20-25 By extend path stop , actively pursue , health effect expect . In context intervention , availability time ticket provide incentive switch car public transport . In addition , employee motivate use next stop order extend active distance . Access rout also covered foot . Control group : Maintaining mobility n = 20-25 Method : Before intervention phase 1 year ( take account seasonal effect fluctuation ) , parameter relevant health collect . Finally , result initial examination compare final examination order examine effect healthy mobility workplace cardiovascular risk profile , everyday activity , physical performance , quality life , mobility behavior , body composition . The aim project generate data health effect healthy mobility .</detailed_description>
