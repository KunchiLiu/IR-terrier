	<brief_summary>The overall vision proposal demonstrate virtual reality base motor imagery training program improve brain computer interface ( BCI ) performance motor function quadriplegic subject . The ultimate goal increase independence subject spinal cord injury train safely control BCI assistive device enhance motor recovery .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Mirror Neuron Network Based Motor Imagery Training Improve Brain Computer Interface Performance Spinal Cord Injury Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Intend train subject motor imagery technique use advanced virtual reality base platform . Hypothesize enhance cortical signal necessary operate non-invasive EEG-based BCI . Specifically , design train paradigm activate `` mirror neuron '' associate performance movement , observation movement , motor imagery . Mirror neuron network ( MNN ) activation induces cortical plasticity , may therefore enhance cortical signal generate BCI use . Plan assess effect training paradigm cortical signal generate motor imagery , use EEG . Also , investigate neuropsychological factor play role subject 's ability generate vivid motor imagery . Eight subject spinal cord injury ( SCI ) recruit sub-acute phase ( 3-6 month follow injury ) . Four participant immediately undergo motor imagery training immersive virtual reality environment NASA . EEG assessment motor function test perform interval 3-4 week motor imagery training period ass improvement cortical signature generation motor recovery . The four participant undergo protocol 6 week delay , order ass effect train time injury cortical signature generation motor function recovery .</detailed_description>
