	<brief_summary>The goal study assess respiratory health Air France company 's employee work Marseilles Paris airport ( flight line administrative employee ) . This study promote Montpellier CHRU , Regional University Hospital Centre ( ANSM identification number 2011-A00646-35 ) . It allow voluntary employee involve . They answer lifestyle survey perform spirometry , exhale CO measurement sample exhale air condensate ( EAC ) . A metrological study particle emit aircraft engine find airport environment conduct elementary chemical composition analysis , well sieve analysis particle present EAC conduct .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Air traffic increase , raise concern local pollution adverse health effect people live vicinity large airport . However , high risk probably occupational exposure due proximity . Jet exhaust one main concern airport may health impact , particularly respiratory tract . Current study neither numerous enough strong enough prove kind association . Yet , people work airport , occupational exposure jet exhaust fact . In 1999 , effect occupational exposure aircraft fuel jet exhaust pulmonary function respiratory symptom Birmingham International Airport ( Birmingham , UK ) worker report . This work suggest link high occupational exposure aviation fuel jet exhaust excess respiratory tract symptom , consistent presence respiratory irritant . It cross-sectional survey use questionnaire fill participant . Respiratory immunological function assessment exhale carbon monoxide measurement conduct male full-time airport worker classify three group accord exposure level . The study present volunteer subject occupational medical appointment concern company . The information letter provide well informed consent form fill study . Once subject agree participate , self-surveys lifestyle habit fill EACand urine sampling take one consultation , addition exhale CO No measurement . This consultation also include spirometry test . The employee ' workstation data collect . Therefore , volunteer ' participation limit one single visit include non-invasive examination self-surveys . Method detail : - Survey : The survey break 2 part , total 94 item . The first part bear employee ' respiratory health condition , essentially ground validated EGEA survey . The rest focus employee ' lifestyle habit , professionally ( outdoor indoor work time , trade , type exposure , etc . ) personally ( geographical situation home , type town community , heat system , usual mode cooking , etc. ) . The survey anonymised answer automatically read datascan process . - Spirometry : This method allow non-invasive , simple repeatable assessment respiratory function . It indispensable clearly explain process patient . The patient sit back straight process . Once subject device ready , subject deeply breathes fill lung fully expire spirometer . Then subject breathes fully forcedly order obtain inspiratory curve . The spirometry result compare theoretical predict value determine base patient 's age , gender , size ethnic group . Consequently , accord subject 's breathe speed force intensity , measurement vital capacity ( VC ) force vital capacity ( FVC ) obtain . The curve allow variable deduce , maximum expiratory volume per second ( MEVS ) peak expiratory flow ( PEF ) , mean expiratory flow ( MEF 25-75 ) . - Exhaled CO measurement ( confound factor respiratory function , order reflect smoking status ) : employee blow device 's single-use cardboard mouthpiece deep inspiration follow fifteen-second apnea compute device . The measurement part per million ( ppm ) immediately display device quantify severity CO intoxication . This measurement simple repeatable . - Exhaled air condensate : EAC acquisition . In fact , RTube device well adapt non-invasion collection company ' site . It use accord recommendation American Thoracic Society EuropeanRespiratory Society . The R tube pre-treated first study ( intensive wash order abate background noise ) `` white '' R tubeswill collect study check method 's detection limit . Briefly , collection nose block last 15 minute subject breathes normally device . The mouth rinse water collection subject ask refrain drinking eat previous hour . This allow ca . 1.4 ml collect ( mean EACvolume collect first study 15-minute breathing time ) . - Metrology : recent subject , consensus far representative unit measurement employee exposure . Similarly , current device allow parameter obtain : quantitative data ( particle content/cm3 , sieve distribution , develop surface area alveolar fraction likely expose breathe apparatus ) qualitative data ( morphology , aggregation/agglomeration status , listof constitutive chemical element ) . These expert ' survey require implementation different equipment . The method base personal metrology , use portable individual system , well fix installation metrology , organise single sampling mean cane various measure instrument connect ( Condensation ParticleCounter , ElectrostaticLow Pressure Impactor , Scanning MobilityParticleSizer , FastMobilityParticleSizer , Nanometer Surface Area Monitor , Alveolar Sensor , Alveolar Inhalable Thoracic sensor ) .An independent counter ( Condensation ParticleCounter ) allow background evolution monitor . Membrane sensor ( Giliansampling pump membrane support ) also complement process . They use portable system , employee involve study . Finally , sample analyse mean SEM ( Scanning Electron Microscope ) , model 5500 Hitachi , associate energy-dispersive EDX system ( X analysis system - Noranmodel Thermocompany ) .</detailed_description>
