	<brief_summary>An immunotherapy study combine ipilimumab evofosfamide treatment patient confirm metastatic locally advanced prostate cancer , metastatic pancreatic cancer , melanoma human papillomavirus ( HPV ) negative squamous cell carcinoma head neck fail respond standard therapy , progress despite standard therapy , standard therapy offer potential increase survival .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Immunotherapy Study Evofosfamide Combination With Ipilimumab</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Tumor hypoxia lead poor effector T cell penetration immunosuppressive signal via myeloid-derived suppressor , myofibroblast regulatory T cell . Disruption hypoxic region within tumor microenvironment hypoxia-directed cytotoxic agent evofosfamide may enhance ability CTLA-4 checkpoint inhibitor ipilimumab reject otherwise resistant solid tumor . Additionally , induction immunogenic cell death tumor cell evofosfamide may enhance dendritic cell presentation tumor antigens lymphocytes drain lymph node , lead clonal expansion tumor-specific T cell , especially combination ipilimumab .</detailed_description>

Patients castrateresistant prostate cancer measurable evaluable disease . Patients evaluable disease must document evidence progressive disease define follow : 1 . Prostatespecific antigen ( PSA ) progression : minimum 2 rise value ( 3 measurement ) obtain minimum 7 day apart last result least &gt; /= 1.0 ng/mL ; 2 . New increase nonbone disease ( RECIST 1.1 criterion ) ; 3 . Positive bone scan 2 new lesion ( PCWG3 ) 6 . Adequate bone marrow function within 7 day define : 1 . White Blood Cell ( WBC ) ≥ 2500 cells/mm3 2 . Absolute neutrophil count ( ANC ) ≥ 1,500 cells/mm3cells 3 . Absolute lymphocyte count ( ALC ) &gt; 1000 cells/mm3 4 . Hemoglobin ≥ 9 g/dL 5 . Platelets ( PLT ) ≥ 75,000 cells/mm3 7 . Acceptable renal function within 7 day define serum creatinine ≤ 2.0 time institutional upper limit normal ( ULN ) calculate creatinine clearance ≥ 50 mL/min ( Cockcroft Gault formula ) . 8 . Acceptable liver function within 7 day day 1 therapy define : 1 . • Bilirubin ≤ 1.5 time institutional ULN ; apply patient diagnose Gilbert 's syndrome . 2 . • AST ( SGOT ) ALT ( SGPT ) ≤ 3 time institutional ULN ; liver metastases present , ≤ 5 time ULN allow . 9 .
