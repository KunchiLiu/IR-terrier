	<detailed_description>Amyloidosis multi-organ syndrome , usually present restrictive cardiomyopathy ( RCM ) . Transthyretin ( TTR ) amyloidosis subtype amyloidosis , subdivide familial type senile type . Its pathophysiology consist primarily abnormal precipitation transthyretin - protein normally act transporter thyroid hormone retinoids - tissue . TTR amyloidosis frequently involve heart , bring clinical pathophysiological picture RCM . Another presentation TTR Amyloidosis atrio-ventricular block bundle-branch block [ 1 ] . There evidence cardiac TTR amyloidosis , though infrequently diagnose lifetime , may represent widespread cause restrictive cardiomyopathy especially elderly . An autopsy study octogenarian suffer heart failure preserve leave ventricular ejection fraction ( HFpEF ) suggest 25 % TTR amyloid deposit myocardium , though negligible minority diagnose TTR amyloidosis lifetime [ 2-3 ] . HFpEF widespread diagnosis , represent considerable burden morbidity , usually harbours population patient poorly respond treatment . Most patient diagnosis HFpEF little explanation concern aetiology disease , especially respond conventional treatment . Most benefit symptomatic treatment alter course disease . Thus widespread diagnosis TTR amyloidosis could promise good management hard-to-treat patient population . Several medication limit progression TTR amyloidosis currently investigation . Until , golden standard diagnosis disease endomyocardial biopsy ( EMB ) may entail several adverse complication thus limit widespread diagnosis . Since amyloidosis multi-organ disease , extra-cardiac biopsy propose surrogate tissue diagnosis , though TTR amyloidosis sensitivity 50 % [ 4 ] . Recently several paper support evidence Tc99m-labeled pyrophosphate ( PYP ) bisphosphonates injected intravenously localize myocardial deposit TTR amyloid . It thus suggest Tc99m scintigraphy might highly sensitive specific diagnostic tool cardiac TTR amyloidosis [ 5-9 ] . It show almost source false positive Tc99m scintigraphy primary amyloidosis , different entity , bad prognosis , different treatment , although frequently involve heart well [ 10 ] . Primary amyloidosis diagnose mean demonstration monoclonal immunoglobulin peak serum immunoglobulin light chain serum urine [ 11 ] . Therefore , specificity Tc99m scan TTR amyloidosis bring extraordinary level , virtually negligible false positive rate , primary amyloidosis exclude prior referral Tc99m scan . The entity false positive uptake Tc99m myocardium observe acute myocardial infarction . Currently Tc99m-PYP scan utilise bone scan accord guideline order diagnose wide spectrum disease stress fracture metastatic bone disease . At present mentioned hypothesis TTR amyloidosis might widespread cause HFpEF establish clinical trial due fact accurate diagnosis TTR amyloidosis require invasive procedure possible adverse outcome extra-cardiac biopsy low diagnostic yield . Advent novel , possibly accurate , yet non-invasive diagnostic tool open new opportunity set study . The incidence familial type senile type TTR amyloidosis among patient diagnosis otherwise unexplained heart failure heart block evaluate study mean Tc99m scan use SPECT technology described . The hypothesis incidence TTR amyloidosis within population patient suffer HFpEF high demonstrate autopsy study , able establish diagnosis large cohort patient . This make new development research disease , treatment outcome drive trial , possible . Establishing diagnosis TTR amyloidosis patient HFpEF improve decision-making ability regard patient ' treatment , example prevent unnecessary invasive measure patient comorbidities demand measure , alternative diagnosis unrevealed .</detailed_description>
