	<brief_summary>The objective study evaluate impact antimicrobial ( antibiotic ) exposures microbiome healthy adult , specifically usual course antimicrobial use treat community acquire pneumonia ( CAP ) . Pneumonia lung infection , community-acquired pneumonia pneumonia develop outside healthcare facility ( i.e. , community ) . A microbiome community microorganism live particular location , gut mouth . Disruptions person 's microbiome may reduce his/her `` colonization resistance '' ( resistance colonization pathogenic microorganism ) make him/her susceptible multidrug resistant organism ( MDRO ) colonization infection . To study change microbiome , investigator recruit 20 healthy adult volunteer obtain fecal , salivary , skin , urine specimen multiple time point , , administration antimicrobial . Participants randomize one 4 antimicrobial regimen , FDA-approved treatment community-acquired pneumonia . Stool specimens analyzed via stool culture genetic sequencing , remain specimen freeze use create biospecimen repository future analysis . The rationale use healthy volunteer ( instead patient already prescribe antibiotic physician ) human microbiome complex affect variety medical condition medication . In addition , presence absence patient-specific factor mean people infection may prescribe specific course antibiotic investigator try study . Studying effect antibiotic healthy volunteer provide baseline data applicable population large .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Each year , antimicrobial resistance cause two million infection 23,000 death US alone , represent critical global public health issue . Some feared multidrug resistant organism ( MDROs ) include Clostridium difficile , carbapenem-resistant Enterobacteriaceae ( CRE ) , extend spectrum beta-lactamase produce Enterobacteriaceae ( ESBL ) , MDRO Acinetobacter , MDRO Pseudomonas aeruginosa ; antimicrobial effective MDROs , available antimicrobial often rate-limiting toxicity . The major risk factor MDRO colonization subsequent MDRO infection exposure antimicrobial . The use antimicrobial associate alter often less diverse composition fecal microbiome , expansion resistome . A `` healthy '' microbiome provide `` colonization resistance '' potentially pathogenic bacteria ; antimicrobial disrupt protective community , provide selective pressure favor MDRO colonization , persistence , transmission others . Methods proactively prevent MDRO colonization , rather reliance reactive approach problem , urgently need . Antimicrobial stewardship key component MDRO prevention effort ; however , method determine antimicrobial cause great degree microbiome disruption . A good understand exactly antimicrobial alter microbiome necessary optimally guide future MDRO prevention effort antimicrobial stewardship . The development microbiome disruption index ( MDIs ) would help characterize risk associate specific antimicrobial , use antimicrobial development , patient monitoring antimicrobial , facilitate infection prevention effort contain MDRO spread . Additionally , MDIs use alert microbiome disruption reach critical level MDRO colonization imminent . At point , intervention restore microbiome could implement . Community-acquired pneumonia ( CAP ) one lead cause death United States , estimate &gt; 900,000 case year adults age 65 older . Large amount antimicrobial use treat patient CAP disease relatively common . A good understanding effect CAP antimicrobial treatment microbiome could result improved treatment option patient CAP protect CAP patient colonization infection MDROs .</detailed_description>
