	<brief_summary>This implementation research aim accelerate effective high coverage Kangaroo Mother Care district Sonipat state Haryana , India . The project lead government Haryana . KMC unit set selected government private delivery facility . KMC initiated baby birth weight less 2000 gm facility ( either bear refer elsewhere ) continue home post discharge . These baby may either born facility refer facility . A linkage community health worker establish support mother continue KMC home .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Implementation Research Scaling Kangaroo Mother Care ( KMC )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Babies bear low birth weight increase risk mortality . The global burden low birth weight baby high 15 million neonate born preterm year . Complications preterm birth result one million death , comprise 35 % newborn mortality . The way forward achieve effective equitable implementation intervention evidence efficacy well establish . One efficacious intervention Kangaroo Mother Care ( KMC ) . KMC demonstrate promote physiologic stability , facilitate early breastfeeding , provide thermally supportive environment , reduce risk serious infection , reduce mortality hospitalize , stable preterm low birth weight infant . This practice also promote bond infant mother first hour day life . The `` Every Newborn Action Plan '' endorse launch World Health Assembly May 2014 include goal scale KMC 50 % baby weigh 2000 grams 2020 , 75 % baby 2025 . This implementation research aim promote KMC scale district Haryana . The step include formative research identify barrier facilitator ; design scalable model deliver KMC across facility-community continuum ; implementation evaluation model aim towards wider national state-level scale-up . Learning stage process apply refine improve KMC delivery model . This proposal aim develop , implement evaluate delivery model KMC . The study implement two phase : ) development delivery model ii ) implementation evaluation model . The performance model assess pre-defined success criterion 80 % high coverage effective KMC population level . KMC implement three level , pre-facility , facility post-facility .</detailed_description>
