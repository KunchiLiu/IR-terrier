	<detailed_description>Objective : The goal proposal conduct pilot study establish feasibility acceptability randomize comparative effectiveness clinical trial compare office-based buprenorphine vs. federally license methadone program treatment opioid dependent pregnant woman . Specific Aims : Aim 1 : Evaluate feasibility conduct randomize study compare office-based buprenorphine vs. federally license methadone program treatment OD pregnant woman . OD pregnant woman ( n=50 ) randomize ( 1:1 ) office-based buprenorphine vs. federally licensed methadone program . Feasibility assess measure proportion OD pregnant woman eligible , enroll , remain study ability monitor treatment program factor ( e.g . compliance treatment provider/facility visit , counsel session , prenatal care visit , social service involvement ) maternal treatment outcome treatment retention , illicit drug use HIV risk behavior . Aim 2 : Describe perspectives OD pregnant woman provider regard buprenorphine vs. methadone treatment opioid dependence pregnancy . Study acceptability assess conduct qualitative semi-structured interview three group : ( 1 ) pilot participant determine satisfaction assign treatment program identify mismatch treatment program service participant ' need ; ( 2 ) prenatal care opioid treatment provider identify way improve treatment process pregnancy suggest idea care coordination ; ( 3 ) OD pregnant woman ineligible choose participate pilot trial also ask participate interview gain broader perspective attitude perspective regard opioid treatment program pregnancy . Aim 3 : Identify barrier facilitator treatment retention postpartum period identify key functional outcome relevant reduction illicit drug use pregnancy . Illicit drug use relapse common immediate postpartum period stress associate motherhood great . Therefore , pilot participant follow 3 , 6 , 9 12 week postpartum identify barrier facilitator specific postpartum period may impact treatment retention . The relationship postpartum treatment retention maternal functional outcome also explore ( e.g . breastfeeding , postpartum depression , motherhood satisfaction , infant custody , employment , criminality ) . Background : The incidence opioid dependence pregnancy increase last decade 1.2 5.8 per 1,000 hospital birth per year . While methadone current , standard treatment opioid dependent ( OD ) pregnant woman , buprenorphine recently emerge alternative . In recent clinical trial ( MOTHER ) , buprenorphine associate superior neonatal outcome short duration treatment neonatal abstinence syndrome ( NAS ) compare methadone . However , buprenorphine also associate great study discontinuation ( 33 % vs. 18 % ) illicit opioid use ( 33 % vs. 23 % ) compare methadone . Treatment dropout often lead relapse resumption high-risk behavior , overshadow short-term improvement neonatal outcome . Therefore , next research question emerge effective treatment ( buprenorphine vs. methadone ) particular patient pregnancy ? In clinical setting , difference maternal characteristic , treatment program structure patient provider preference may surpass impact pharmacology maternal treatment outcome ( treatment retention , illicit drug use , HIV risk behavior ) . Buprenorphine dispense office-based setting variety provider less regulatory oversight methadone . Methadone dispense federally license facility often incorporate counsel support service treatment protocol . Successful office-based treatment relies share power responsibility , close patient-provider relationship careful attention psychosocial co-morbidities . Failure match patient problem severity difference treatment program structure may contribute adverse maternal outcome . Therefore , understand comparative effectiveness buprenorphine vs. methadone pregnancy , impact patient problem severity treatment program structure maternal ( vs. neonatal ) outcomes must compare . Significance : Findings project provide preliminary data support comparative effectiveness clinical trial design compare impact office-based buprenorphine vs. federally license methadone program maternal treatment postpartum functional outcome OD woman . The ultimate goal line research develop evidence-based clinical guideline guide provider decision-making regard effective treatment ( buprenorphine vs. methadone ) particular patient pregnancy .</detailed_description>
