	<brief_summary>Cholinergic deficiency brain related gait balance problem Parkinson disease ( PD ) . Recent clinical trial suggest beneficial role acetylcholinesterase inhibitor ( AchEI ) gait PD . In study , investigator plan study influence AchEI brain network gait balance PD . As gait problem prominent postural instability gait disturbance ( PIGD ) subtype , study focus patient PIGD phenotype .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Effect Acetylcholinesterase Inhibitors Gait Patients With Parkinson Disease</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PD patient PIGD subtype include . 1 . Assessment : - Overall feature PD assess Unified Parkinson Disease Rating Scale ( UPDRS ) . Non-motor feature include cognition assess standard scale . Gait balance assess gait analysis system , measure physiological parameter gait velocity , variability center pressure . Positron emission tomography use 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose ( FDG PET ) do brain activity related gait balance . - Clinical evaluation do baseline , 4th , 8th 12th week - Gait analysis FDG PET do baseline 12th week 2 . Drug dosage - For first 4 week , 5 mg/day - Then , 10 mg/day 8 week</detailed_description>
