	<detailed_description>Registry set procedure : The Swedish Intensive Care Registry ( SIR ) collect comprehensive dataset patient characteristic , intensive care procedure outcomes use detailed guideline . Continuous data collect raw data , validate locally transfer electronically registry central validation ( confirm within prespecified limit inconsistency illogical entry identify ) . If necessary , data return correction revalidation accept added master database . Study participant : Patients COPD principal diagnosis ICU stay include study cohort . When patient multiple admission study period due COPD last admission include . Patients exclude nursing workload score indicate active ventilation support first 24 hour information type support ( non-invasive invasive ventilation ) lacking . Participants miss vital status also exclude analysis . Patients group accord mode first-line ventilation support give initial 24 hour ICU . The Standard therapy group receive active ventilation support , NIV group receive non-invasive ventilation support , NIV + Invasive mechanical ventilation ( IMV ) group receive NIV follow intubation invasive ventilation support , IMV group intubate receive invasive ventilation support without precede NIV trial .</detailed_description>
