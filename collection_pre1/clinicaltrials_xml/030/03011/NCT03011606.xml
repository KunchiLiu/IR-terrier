	<brief_summary>The toxicity traditional prostate cancer therapy include radical surgery external beam radiation well know . This prompt move towards focal therapy cancerous part prostate treat . To date , study demonstrate promising outcome follow focal therapy majority men maintain urinary sexual function therapy . In small proportion men , disease recurs focal therapy . The optimal treatment men recurrent disease focal therapy yet define . Patients may undergo focal therapy recurrent disease , undergo radiation therapy , whole-gland therapy use minimally invasive approach High Intensity Focused Ultrasound ( HIFU ) cryotherapy . Alternatively patient may undergo radical surgery whole prostate remove . To date , side-effects toxicity treatment recurrent prostate cancer focal therapy formally study . Traditionally , side effect surgery radiation therapy perform patient already undergone previous prostate cancer treatment considerable high rate urinary incontinence erectile dysfunction . However , focal therapy leave significant area prostate untreated , investigator believe surgery focal prostate therapy associate much low incidence urinary sexual dysfunction . The aim RAFT study characterise side effect prostate cancer surgery men undergo prior focal ablation therapy . In addition , investigator wish perform number basic science study attempt good understand patient experience recurrent prostate cancer focal therapy .</brief_summary>
