	<brief_summary>The Investigators examine DC-STAMP serve early marker TNFi response PsA . Identification biomarker would permit rapid transition new agent , major treatment advance . TNFi effective therapy PsA , however , methotrexate frequently initiate early disease course base significantly low cost . Unfortunately , efficacy MTX support clinical trial 40 % patient respond TNFi therapy . Moreover , valid biomarkers predict MTX TNFi responses currently unavailable . This study may also provide first data comparative efficacy MTX TNFi use clinical , Power Doppler Ultrasound ( PDUS ) biomarker outcome .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>DC-STAMP : Regulators Osteoclastogenesis Response Marker PsA</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Psoriatic arthritis ( PsA ) , inflammatory joint disease associate psoriasis ( Ps ) , affect approximately 650,000 adult United States associate increased morbidity mortality . Bone damage develop half patient within first two year disease , often leave impaired function diminish quality life . The emergence anti-Tumor Necrosis Factor therapy ( TNFi ) dramatically improve clinical response slow bone cartilage degradation PsA patient , however , 50-60 % patient respond agent . To improve outcome , investigator must address two major gap : limited understand key event underlie pathologic bone destruction absence biomarkers predict biologic response identify early biologic responder facilitate optimization therapy . Bone damage mediate osteoclast arise monocyte precursor blood . Osteoclast Precursors ( OCPs ) dramatically increase PsA , compare control , particularly patient bone damage X-ray . The number circulate precursor cell drop rapidly follow treatment TNFi . OCPs may serve response biomarkers , cost , time high variability limit assay . Osteoclast precursor express Dendritic Cell-Specific Transmembrane Protein ( DC-STAMP ) , seven-pass transmembrane protein require fusion monocyte form osteoclast giant cell . Monocyte DC-STAMP level drop rapidly follow treatment TNFi . TNF receptor-associated factor 3 ( TRAF3 ) , inhibitor OC formation correlate extracellular TNF concentration , elevate OCPs PsA patient . These marker may predict TNFi treatment response . The goal study examine DC-STAMP Psoriatic Arthritis patient prior start standard care treatment biologic non-biologic DMARD . The investigator also examine PsA patient low disease activity TNFi PsA patient low disease activity methotrexate oral DMARDs serve control . Up 66 Psoriatic Arthritis patient consent studied protocol . Up 80 PsA subject may consent allow screen failure replace longitudinal subject withdraw . Up 20 PsA healthy subject may enrol assay development , test technique and/or ultra sound comparison . Unique individual count towards study number report , i.e . individual subject participate one aspect study count . 30 patient start standard care treatment biologic non-biologic DMARD take part longitudinal section study two patient ask blood draw one additional visit start therapy additional research assay . The investigator also ask total 36 patient participate cross-sectional part study . 18 patient stable DMARDS 18 patient stable biologic therapy compare cross-sectional part . This population Good Disease State disease control treatment need change . If longitudinal subject fit cross-sectional criterion wish participate , re-consented cross-sectional part study . The investigator may ask subject come back one additional blood draw assay development approximately week .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Ability provide write informed consent . Subjects either gender must least 18 year old . Subjects PsA fulfill CASPAR criterion . Longitudinal : Patients active PsA start biologic nonbiologic DMARD treatment ( Subjects start nonbiologic DMARDS blood drawn within first day start therapy ) . Additional Blood Draw : Positive DCSTAMP signal baseline CrossSectional : Patients stable DMARDS biologics 16 week . Healthy Subjects : Healthy control active systemic disorder inflammatory condition would confound result study . Unable donate blood poor venous access intolerance phlebotomy .</criteria>
