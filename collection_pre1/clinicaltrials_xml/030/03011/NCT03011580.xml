	<brief_summary>This Strategic Research Project translational proof-of-concept study determine whether vitamin D3 potential prevent recurrent tuberculosis ( TB ) , indicate enhanced resolution pulmonary inflammation detect use 18F-FDG PET-CT scanning . The extent pulmonary inflammation detectable PET-CT scanning validate biomarker previously show predict risk TB recurrence patient take anti-TB treatment . The investigator propose explore whether vitamin D3 enhance resolution PET-CT-detectable pulmonary inflammation , basis extensive preliminary data vitro study Phase 2b clinical trial investigator conduct , show high-dose vitamin D3 accelerate resolution peripheral blood inflammatory responses patient pulmonary TB . Forty vitamin D-deficient patient complete 6 month ' TB treatment , still residual pulmonary inflammation detectable PET-CT scanning , allocate receive either 8-week course high-dose oral vitamin D3 supplementation placebo study period . The extent pulmonary inflammation PET-CT scanning compare intervention vs. control group 8-week follow-up . If study show positive result , generate valuable proof-of-concept data could use support application conduct large phase 3 trial vitamin D supplementation prevent TB recurrence .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Study design justification : This exploratory study compare effect vitamin D supplementation placebo ( capsule active drug ) residual pulmonary inflammation detectable PET-CT scanning . If study demonstrate vitamin D supplementation dampen lung inflammation patient still inflammation end antibiotic treatment , provide basis big rigorous study . Half participant ask take capsule contain vitamin D ( immediate supplementation group ) half placebo ( delayed supplementation group ) duration 8 week , complete anti-tuberculosis treatment . There equal chance ( 1 2 ) participant give either study medication - allow two group fairly similar background characteristic difference inflammation 8 week would put vitamin D supplementation . The study adopt 'double-blind ' approach , mean neither participant researcher know study medication participant take duration study . This allow minimise influence know type study medication participant take might researcher ' participant ' behaviour study , behaviour might affect result study . This also one reason investigator choose use placebo study , rather compare participant take vitamin D take study medication . In addition , use placebo may encourage participant take study medication . It unlikely delay start vitamin D replacement participant delay supplementation arm would harmful , vitamin D deficiency unlikely associate acute medical problem , delay correction ( 8 week ) short relation likely duration deficiency precede study , likely longstanding ( e.g . year ) . Study procedure : - Attend three visit hospital complete course antibiotic pulmonary tuberculosis . Visit 2 may conduct via telephone post study medication ( registered mail courier ) - Take three capsule study medication ( 3,200 IU total 9,600 IU ) every day , use dispenser provide investigator - Give two blood sample : first =19 ml ( ~4 tsp ) , second =25 ml ( ~5 tsp ) - Give two cough sample - Have two chest PET-CT scan - Receive five telephone call , last five minute - Receive additional telephone call dos miss Potential participant give copy Patient Information Sheet ( PIS ) member usual care team schedule clinic appointment complete TB treatment ample time ( least 24 hour ) decide whether want take part study . Those take PIS ask complete contact slip provide contact detail authorise research team make contact chance read information; contact slip forward research team participant 's usual care team . Telephone call 1 - This feed back result test vitamin D status , calcium renal function perform part usual care . Potential participant find vitamin D deficient ( serum 25 [ OH ] D &lt; 50 nmol/L ) , normocalcaemic ( serum correct calcium &lt; 2.65 mmol/L ) eGFR &gt; 30 ml/min/1.73 m2 invite attend Visit 1 ( -2 week ) screen . Visit 1 - Potential participant attend Visit 1 ask give write informed consent participate study . A PET-CT scan perform Department Nuclear Medicine , Barts Health NHS Trust ( radiation exposure PET-CT scan 4.6 mSv ) . All woman childbearing age ask urine pregnancy test PET-CT scan ; scan proceed unless negative pregnancy test result obtain time . Blood sample ( volume 19 ml ) immunological test induced sputum sample also take visit . Participants ' GPs notify post involvement study stage , consent give . Telephone call 2 - This feed back result test PET-CT scan perform Visit 1 . Participants find significant residual PET-hot pulmonary inflammation scan ( SUVmax ≥3 g/ml ) invite attend Visit 2 ( 0 week ) . Visit 2 ( 0 week ) - At visit , eligible participant allocate oral vitamin D replacement therapy daily dose 9,600 IU Fultium-D3 ( cholecalciferol vitamin D3 ) 8 week immediate supplementation arm ( n=20 ) oral placebo 8 week delay supplementation arm ( n=20 ) . Fultium-D3 placebo identical appearance taste give dose three capsule daily ( Fultium-D3 capsule contain 3,200 IU vitamin D3 ) . Participants may also give CE-marked Sensemedic dispenser real-time adherence monitor show use . Participants advise symptom high blood calcium level ( nausea , vomit , thirst , pass excessive amount urine feel generally unwell ) ask contact designated member study team develop symptom blood test check high blood calcium level arrange urgently . Any new symptom report Visit 2 Visit 3 assess study doctor potential association study medication . Arrangements make visit telephone follow-up session . Visit 2 may conduct via telephone post study medication ( registered mail courier ) investigator 's discretion . Follow-up telephone call ( T3-5 miss dos ) - Follow-up telephone call make 1 week ( T3 ) , 3 week ( T4 ) 5 week ( T5 ) post-randomisation participant . A member study team telephone participant pre-arranged time check adherence study medication problem use Sensemedic dispenser . Telephone call also make participant non-adherence log Sensemedic system . Additional intermediate study face-to-face visit arrange necessary adherence issue identify . Visit 3 - PET-CT scan measurement whole blood ( volume 25 ml ) induce sputum inflammatory marker repeat Visit 3 ( +8 week ) . All woman childbearing age ask urine pregnancy test PET-CT scan ; scan proceed unless negative pregnancy test result obtain time . All radiological read-out assessed radiologist blind allocation , compare supplement vs. unsupplemented patient use analysis covariance adjust baseline value . All participant offer vitamin D supplementation 8-week follow-up assessment , prior discharge study . Participants'GPs inform post participation study end . All participant inform post end study whether receive vitamin D supplement placebo Visit 2 Visit 3 . Discontinuation study medication : Participants whose study medication discontinue remain follow-up long consent , data continue collect .</detailed_description>
