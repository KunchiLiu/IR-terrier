	<detailed_description>The BIOSTOP study prospective , open randomize , multicenter , parallel-group study compare clinical outcome discontinuing ( interventional group ) compare continue ( control group ) biologic treatment anti-TNF ulcerative colitis patient clinical remission . Adult male female patient establish diagnosis ulcerative colitis treat minimum one year anti-TNF maintenance therapy clinical remission last 3 month potential study patient . Eligible patient give informed write consent randomize 1:1 either discontinue anti-TNF treatment continue anti-TNF treatment another two year . Patients control group still clinical endoscopic remission two year continue anti-TNF treatment , switch discontinue anti-TNF treatment . End study/follow-up 4 year . In order identify primary endpoint ( occurrence disease relapse ) , study center phone number patient call case symptom suspect increased disease activity . If patient experience potential disease flare ( 6-point Mayo score &gt; 1 ) and/or 2 consecutive calprotectin test positive ( &gt; 200 mg/kg ) , unscheduled visit include recto sigmoidoscopy perform without delay document disease status .</detailed_description>
