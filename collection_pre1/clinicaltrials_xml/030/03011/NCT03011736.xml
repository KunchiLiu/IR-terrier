	<brief_summary>This clinical trial study omission intact parathyroid hormone test surgery treat patient primary hyperparathyroidism . Omission intact parathyroid hormone test parathyroid gland removal may help patient primary hyperparathyroidism decrease time anesthesia , decrease overall time cost surgery .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Omission Intact Parathyroid Hormone Testing During Surgery Treating Patients With Primary Hyperparathyroidism</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . Determine non-inferiority omission parathyroid hormone ( PTH ) patient meet biochemical radiological criterion compare current standard care ( i.e . use intraoperative parathyroid hormone test ) . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I. Cost-analysis determine saving omission intraoperative PTH testing . OUTLINE : Patients undergo standard minimally invasive parathyroidectomy without PTH test surgery . After completion study , patient follow 2 week .</detailed_description>
