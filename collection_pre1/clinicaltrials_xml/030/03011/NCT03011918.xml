	<brief_summary>Falls fall related injury consider one adverse event patient experience . Several assessment instrument assess mitigate risk fall developed . However , instrument address nutritional risk factor . Weight loss low hemoglobin level key component Malnutrition . Malnutrition hospital set significant concern may play role fall risk factor . The World Health Organization ( WHO ) maintain global anemia database . WHO identify iron deficiency anemia , base hemoglobin value alone common , wide-spread nutritional deficiency worldwide . Anemia present 30 % world population include industrialized nation . The consensus statement Academy Nutrition Dietetics / American Society Parenteral Enteral Nutrition simply define adult under-nutrition continuum inadequate intake along multitude factor . Weight loss occur multiple point along continuum . multiphase retrospective descriptive analysis hypothesizes degree weight loss degree Hgb decline may fall risk factor .</brief_summary>

Chart Review data weight loss decline Hemoglobin level collect 12 month , 6 month 3months 1 month prior first fall along recent value prior event . Additional data vitamin D level C-reactive Protein value collect 12 month , 6month , 1 month prior first fall Statistical Analysis use SAS version 9.1. two tail t-test perform evaluate difference HGB characteristic single frequent faller . One way ANOVA evaluate change Hgb , c-Reactive Protein , vitamin D value weight time collect . Two constellation faller emerge . Those without dementia . The two group appear different nutrition risk factor . All statistical analysis do use JMP Pro ( version 10.0.0 , SAS Institute , Inc , Cary , NC ) .
