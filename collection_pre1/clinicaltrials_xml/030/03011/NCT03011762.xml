	<detailed_description>I . BACKGROUND AND SIGNIFICANCE Obstructive sleep apnea ( OSA ) common disease carry significant risk cardiovascular disease , mortality , economic cost . Almost thirty year ago , initial population study find prevalence OSA five nine per cent adult population . Excess body weight risk factor development OSA , recent rise prevalence obesity lead revise estimate OSA prevalence , seventeen per cent adult population . OSA poorly recognize clinically ; currently 85 % apneics remain undiagnosed untreated . OSA derive fundamentally structural abnormality pharynx cause pharyngeal narrowing closure sleep produce recurrent apnea hypopnea . During wakefulness compensatory neuromuscular reflex protect pharynx collapse . These reflex lose sleep , leave collapsible human pharynx susceptible narrowing closure . Nasal continuous positive airway pressure ( CPAP ) , comprise air generator nose mask , standard therapy OSA . CPAP delivers positive pressure pharyngeal lumen , thereby dilate eliminate obstruction . While therapy highly efficacious , cumbersome effectiveness compromise relatively low adherence rate . Adherence depend method use initiate therapy severity OSA , high subject severe hypoxemia excessive daytime sleepiness . In current practice , CPAP adherence rate appear approximate fifty per cent . The currently available alternative CPAP oral appliance ( OA ) therapy . Oral appliance maintain patency airway sleep stabilize protrude mandible and/or tongue . The commonly use type OA custom-made mandibular repositioner ( MR ) protrude mandible . Mandibular protrusion paralyze subject dilate velopharynx oropharynx . In clinical practice , specialist dentist fabricate custom-fitted appliance cover upper low teeth . The appliance empirically adjust progressively protrude mandible therapeutic end-point reach . OA therapy well accept OSA subject nasal CPAP , self-reported adherence rate high . Unfortunately , OA therapy uniformly effective OSA . Reported effectiveness range 50 70 percent , recent study find 58 % percent success rate . In short , two therapy currently available treat OSA , shortcoming : 1 ) CPAP efficacious uniformly tolerated subject ; 2 ) OAT highly efficacious well tolerate CPAP . II . CURRENT STATUS OF MEDICAL PRACTICE Because uncertainty regard use OA therapy treat OSA , current practice North America focus primarily use nasal CPAP . Virtually subject find OSA receive trial nasal CPAP . If prove non-adherent therapy , may offer OA therapy . The American Academy Sleep Medicine recommend OA therapy CPAP alternative subject OSA mild moderate severity . However , lack valid test clinically select subject OSA favorable response OA therapy , reimbursement OA therapy usually provide apneics fail CPAP . The effectiveness OA therapy could improve screen OSA subject prospectively identify suitable therapy . Unfortunately , present time , method select favorable candidate OA therapy lacking . Moreover , even subject know favorable candidate , dentist currently way determine target therapeutic protrusive position . Studies passive pharynx indicate response pharynx mandibular protrusion 'dose dependent ' ; incremental mandibular protrusion produce correspond pharyngeal enlargement . However , clinical experience show excessive mandibular protrusion undesirable , produce side effect , , pain tooth movement lead discontinuation therapy . In case , over-protrusion worsen OSA . Current practice dentist progressively protrude mandible symptomatic response occur , reassess subject determine OSA resolve . Thus , prospective identification suitable candidate target protrusive position would greatly facilitate treatment OSA OA . Owing largely association excess body weight , obstructive sleep apnea ( OSA ) become arguably prevalent chronic non-communicable disease industrialized society , assume obesity classify disease . In addition impairing quality life , OSA conveys increase risk cardiovascular disease vehicular accident . Finally , majority apneics remain undiagnosed untreated . Thus , OSA hallmarks major public health problem , affect age group increase epidemic proportion . Unfortunately , current medical practice seem ill suit deal challenge pose OSA . Perhaps unsettling aspect present medical practice relate cumbersome , uninviting expensive method currently use diagnose treat disease . Common clinical experience indicate individual often resist undergo standard diagnostic test , overnight in-hospital polysomnogram , extensive attachment body surface , OSA present , continuous positive airway pressure ( CPAP ) administer latter half night . In word , public awareness sleep apnea increase also negative impression current test treatment . Any effective solution public health challenge pose sleep apnea consider need less cumbersome off-putting clinical method . In word , current approach OSA , i.e. , overnight polysomnogram plus CPAP , simply deal problem . While simpler , less expensive home monitoring appear gain acceptance sleep physician , CPAP continue virtually therapy offer patient , despite low adherence rat documented numerous study . The dominant alternative , present time , mandibular repositioner ( MR ) therapy , use custom fit dental appliance protrudes mandible sleep . Despite overwhelming patient preference OA CPAP , 5 % patient diagnose OSA receive therapy . The likely reason physician bias favor CPAP therapy benign highly efficacious . OA therapy , similarly benign , efficacious 50-70 % unselected case . Thus , clinician prefers prescribe reliable therapy , less concern low adherence rate . To summarize , current practice diagnosis treatment OSA North America emphasize expensive in-hospital test initiation therapy difficult many patient accept use regularly . III . NEW TECHNOLOGIES The propose research evaluate new technology could contribute ameliorate difficulty outline allow accurate selection patient OA therapy use test perform home . This home technology , turn , derive device Zephyr Sleep Technologies invent , develop brought market , call remotely control mandibular positioner ( RCMP ) . In order convenient less expensive method select favorable candidate OA therapy , Zephyr Sleep Technologies develop companion technology use home . Like RCMP , patient sleep motorize mandibular positioner place . However , position mandibular protruder control computer , rather sleep technician , make computer control mandibular positioner ( CCMP ) . As RCMP study , respiratory airflow oxygen saturation record , CCMP accurately detect apneas hypopnea real time . However , bioelectric signal necessary sleep stag record . The CCMP protrudes mandible apneas hypopnea detect . In addition , conduct proactive testing , move mandible evaluate effect airflow . Using types information , controller decide whether move mandible , direction , much . Finally , Zephyr Sleep Technologies develop analytical algorithm examines response move apnea hypopnea index ( AHI , sum apnea hypopneas per unit time ) mandibular protrusion make prediction therapeutic success OA . The CCMP use motorize mandibular protruder use MATRx product . The motor enclose housing attach upper low appliance . The movement linear actuator exerts force low jaw either protrude retrude . A series dental tray upper low teeth fabricate . This allow close fitting tray subject 's teeth minimum amount tray material occupies inner surface teeth . A highly flexible , thin wire connects motor mandibular protruder controller bedside table , turn , connect laptop computer . As well , input signal box bedside table connect two naris catheter position patient 's nose commercially available finger oximeter . The input signal box connect laptop two signal ( oxygen saturation airflow ) use computer algorithm decide move mandible . The MATRx controller receive command computer cause protrude retrude mandible small , defined step . The controller also wire output connection input box computer , continuously provide computer information regard position mandible . The limit excursion actuator set technician software , accord full retrusion full protrusion value note dentist . Thus , computer move mandible predefined limit CCMP study . The signal box also receive input signal microphone position sensor mount mandibular positioner well input force transducer inside positioner . IV . STUDY PROCEDURES Participants receive two night in-home cardio-pulmonary evaluation sleep use Snore Sat Recorder . The result provide baseline data . Prior in-home CCMP study , subject assess dental co-investigator ensure suitability trial use device . They fit upper low dental tray dental co-investigator . The dentist fill tray silicone impression material applies upper low teeth . The relative position upper low tray document numerical reading linear scale imprint slide strut low tray . The subject move mandible rest position , retruded position , protruded position . The scale read dentist position . The data collect provide research coordinator input device control range protrusion test device . The clinical coordinator visit subject home day first night test set computer equipment mandibular positioner . To attach subject 's dental tray , upper low tray clip actuator housing actuator piston fully retract . The maximum allowable protrusive position determine dentist enter computer prevent excessive protrusion mandible . The computer control movement linear actuator protrusive retrusive direction increment 0.2 mm keyboard computer . The position actuator connect input computer . Just prior start study , subject lie supine bed insert dental tray mouth tray rest position . The clinical coordinator also provide subject full instruction use device study . The subject instruct properly insert tray , connect mandibular positioner , mouth . The subject also learn apply finger oximeter probe , naris cannula . The subject taught start CCMP test , pause terminate end study . At bedtime , subject apply naris cannula probe , insert tray mouth initiate CCMP study appropriate command laptop . The subject fall asleep , apneas and/or hypopneas appear , computer protrude mandible rest position 0.2 mm step . Once respiratory disturbance eliminate ( absence apneas , hypopnea ) , proactive testing perform mandible protrude retruded 0.6 mm . If latter cause decrease peak inspiratory airflow former cause increase variable , mandible protrude 0.6 mm , . The following morning , subject awaken remove oral appliance , terminate CCMP program transmit night 's data server mouse click send button . The subject complete Device Satisfaction Questionnaire morning . The data first night titration retrieve automatically analyze judge efficaciousness mandibular protrusion eliminate pharyngeal obstruction identify effective target protrusive position require successful therapy . If predict success criterion meet , subject tentatively predict therapeutic failure , target 90 % full protrusion select . After analysis complete , clinical coordinator return subject 's home set target position second night CCMP study . During home visit prior second night study , clinical coordinator discus subject his/her experience first night , carefully inquire regard discomfort problem subject may experience . The coordinator set CCMP Refinement Verification program enters appropriate target distance . At bedtime subject prepares study first night . The CCMP algorithm move mandible target position hold entire night , move AHI ( i.e . AHI time target reach , initially measure least 2 hr ) remain 10 hr-1 , ±0.6 mm . Otherwise computer protrude mandible 0.2 mm step repeat test higher protrusive level . The following morning , subject awaken remove oral appliance , terminate CCMP program transmit night 's data Zephyr server mouse click send button . The subject complete Device Satisfaction Questionnaire . The computer calculate AHI full night . The result first second night titration study provide sleep physician review result refine prediction arrive final prediction therapeutic outcome target protrusive setting . The target protrusive position determine analysis combine titration study send dentist . For patient predicted success , minimum effective position provide . For patient predicted failure , scale read 70 percent maximum protrusion serve sham target value . The dentist blind whether CCMP test result `` positive '' `` negative '' . The subject refer dental co-investigator , fit custom oral appliance cost blind result CCMP study . Follow-up portable cardio-pulmonary monitoring perform two consecutive night oral appliance target protrusive distance . If AHI great 10 hr-1 , subject refer dental co-investigator mandibular protrusion . This adjustment perform minimum period 3 week . The subject retested therapy judge successful accord criterion outline . If AHI great 10hr-1 , maximum clinical protrusion mandible achieve , OA therapy consider failure .</detailed_description>
