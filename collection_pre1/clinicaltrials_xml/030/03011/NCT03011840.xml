	<detailed_description>INTRODUCTION : Patient Information one key determinant patient satisfaction . Adequate information disease condition , treatment plan , wait time 'what next ' affect patient ' overall satisfaction level . Good quality information reduce patient anxiety stress , also reduce unreasonable expectation misconception . Patient satisfaction always remain important commonly used indicator measure quality health care . In recent year gradual upward trend day care surgery across globe ; estimate 83 % surgery United States perform ambulatory basis . In India , 20 percent surgical procedure perform outpatient . It estimate 2020 , 75 percent surgical operation India carry ambulatory surgery center . The increase trend ambulatory surgery emerge advance anesthesia surgical technique . Patient information effective communication critical surgery especially one need General Anesthesia . Provision information one mainstay effective day surgery management . This need cover surgery , also happen day surgery . There several way provide information like write information , use video , telephone patient interview surgery . Verbal information alone inadequate must reinforce well‚Äêpresented print material . Tata Memorial Hospital premier tertiary level cancer hospital India . Around 140-150 patient undergo minor surgical procedure ( diagnostic therapeutic ) Minor OT complex every day . About 30-40 % surgery belong Head &amp; Neck region alone.About 40-50 % surgery do general anesthesia . At present communication patient busy outpatient department mainly verbal . Due time constrains , lack responsible attendant patient , important information respect day care procedure often effectively deliver . This lead patient follow instruction adequately respect starvation , medication take day procedure also carry essential document . This lead delay , reschedule case rarely postponement procedure . Does information leaflet provide effective way communication peri-procedure period ? Will help good information delivery hence reduce number avoidable postponement delay . And translate good patient satisfaction want study aim see . The study restrict patient undergo Head &amp; Neck procedures general anesthesia , form major bulk patient minor OT complex logistic reason start define group patient . AIMS AND OBJECTIVES : 1 . To reduce postponement case due lack information patient prior procedure . 2 . To compare satisfaction level patient , introduction information leaflet Primary end point : To reduce postponement case due lack information patient prior procedure . Secondary end point To compare satisfaction level patient , introduction information leaflet . Design study : Intervention MATERIAL AND METHODS After Institutional Review Board approval , adult patient meet inclusion criterion undergo surgery Minor operation theater 'OT ' complex 5 month period enrol study . The study do two part . In First half study- plan 2 month ( Jan - Feb ) , feedback form collect patient end minor 'OT ' procedure . All patient , meet inclusion criterion , end procedure prior discharge minor 'OT ' explain study shall give feedback form fill submit . Also number postponement reschedule case note . Postponement reschedule case define event patient call turn minor 'OT ' deferred amount time account starvation adequate , investigation bring , medication take prescribed.Any postponement view await opinion form senior consultant , special equipment investigation call view patient clinical condition anticipate Out Patient Department 'OPD ' surgical colleague , due lack OT time include . After initial collection feedback 2 month , patient information leaflet ( PIL ) hand patient planned procedure minor 'OT ' complex ( Second half study ) . This leaflet hand attend doctor Head neck 'OPD ' . The checklist pertain counsel Head neck 'OPD ' tick carry . The patient instruct read leaflet carefully carry leaflet day Minor OT procedure . In minor OT discharge checklist 'PIL ' would carry concerned include surgical , anesthesia nursing team . A period 1 month allow streamline use patient information leaflet . In subsequent 2 month , Apr- May , impact use 'PIL ' assess . Firstly note number postponement reschedule case . In addition patient meet inclusion criterion give feedback form . end procedure minor 'OT ' . For patient come minor 'OT ' without patient information leaflet- one would ascertain leaflet hand 'OPD ' bring minor OT leaflet hand . The number miss recorded.Patients get leaflet 'OPD ' exclude study . Sample size calculation : From investigator 's preliminary review postponement rate study center around 20 % . The investigator aim reduction postponement 50 % . Group sample size 199 group 1 199 group 2 achieve 80.007 % power detect difference group proportion -0.1000 . The proportion group 1 ( treatment group ) assume 0.2000 null hypothesis 0.1000 alternative hypothesis . The proportion group 2 ( control group ) 0.2000 . The test statistic use two-sided Z-Test pool variance . The significance level test 0.0500.Considering 20 % loss follow 'OPD ' minor 'OT ' , sample size need 480 patients.On average least 250 patient head neck patient undergo procedure general anesthesia , per month ( 12-15 patient /day x 20 work day ) . With due consideration inclusion criterion , two month recruitment period intervention adequate . MEASUREMENTS - No . case postpone introduction leaflet reason behind - Primary data collect patient satisfaction level procedure ( pre post 'PIL ' ) 5 point Likert scale ( Ranging poor = 0 Excellent = 4 ) - No patient receive patient information leaflet ' OPD ' - No patient receive Patient information leaflet get along minor OT STATISTICAL ANALYSIS All Data analyze use Statistical Analysis Software Package ( SPSS ) software . Likert score treat ordinal data . Proportions compare use chi square analysis . Additionally Multivariate logistic regression analysis use assess contribution possible covariates , include age sex patient knowledge patient satisfaction . For data P-value &lt; 0.05 consider statistical significant</detailed_description>
