	<detailed_description>Background : Transcatheter aortic valve implantation ( TAVI ) establish valuable treatment option patient severe symptomatic aortic stenosis increase risk surgical aortic valve replacement ( SAVR ) . The use TAVI rapidly expand worldwide indication TAVI widen low risk population view favorable outcome among high intermediate risk patient . Many novel device currently develop establish device undergo design reiteration address limitation , vascular access complication , paravalvular regurgitation , atrio-ventricular conductance disturbance . However , device comparison use randomized trial scarce particular new generation transcatheter valve . The Symetis ACURATE neo/TF , self-expandable transcatheter valve deliver via transfemoral access , gain Conformité Européenne ( CE ) mark September 2014 show favorable procedural short term result . The SCOPE I trial compare performance balloon-expandable Edwards SAPIEN 3 , widely use well-established transcatheter heart valve second generation , randomize fashion . Objectives : The primary objective comparison Symetis ACURATE neo/TF Edwards SAPIEN 3 transcatheter aortic bioprosthesis regard early safety clinical efficacy 30 day . Secondary objective involve comparison two device regard secondary clinical echocardiographic endpoint 30 day , 1 year 3 year . Methods : Sample Size : Based anticipated incidence proportion 22 % primary non-hierarchical composite endpoint 30 day treatment arm , non-inferiority margin 7.7 % , power 80 % , one-tailed significance level α = 0.05 , low attrition rate , total required sample size amount 730 patient . Design : Patients allocate Symetis ACURATE neo/TF Edwards SAPIEN 3 bioprosthesis 1:1 ratio mean randomly permute block randomisation stratify study center Society Thoracic Surgeons ' predict risk mortality score ( STS-PROM ) stratum ( &lt; 3 % , ≥ 3 &lt; 8 % , ≥ 8 % ) . Analysis : Estimates risk-differences two treatment arm regard primary endpoint pool predefined STS-PROM stratum mean Cochran-Mantel-Haenszel method Wald-type confidence limit calculate use Sato variance estimator . The non-inferiority assumption test one-sided significance level type I error rate ( α ) = 0.05 . The analysis primary composite endpoint conduct accord intention-to-treat ( ITT ) per protocol ( PP ) principle non-inferiority claim meet . In case non-inferiority establish , superiority analysis perform use two-tailed significance level type I error rate α = 0.05 . Further secondary analysis evaluate group difference relation demographic , clinical , procedural , functional imaging characteristic . Pre-specified subgroup analysis conduct use appropriate interaction test contrast category sex , STS-PROM score ( &lt; 3 % , ≥ 3 &lt; 8 % , ≥ 8 % ) , leave ventricular ejection fraction ( &lt; 50 % vs. ≥ 50 % ) , native aortic valve eccentricity index ( ≤ 0.25 vs. &gt; 0.25 ) .</detailed_description>
