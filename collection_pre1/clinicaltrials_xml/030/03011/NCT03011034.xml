	<brief_title>Study Separately Evaluate Activity Talacotuzumab ( JNJ-56022473 ) Daratumumab Transfusion-Dependent Participants With Low Intermediate-1 Risk Myelodysplastic Syndromes ( MDS ) Who Are Relapsed Refractory Erythropoiesis-Stimulating Agent ( ESA ) Treatment</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This multicenter , randomize ( study drug assign chance ) , open-label ( participant researcher aware treatment participant receive ) study evaluate safety efficacy talacotuzumab daratumumab . Approximately 60 participant ( 30 receive talacotuzumab 30 receive daratumumab ) enrol assign randomly 1:1 basis receive either talacotuzumab daratumumab . The study consist : Screening Phase 28 day participant eligibility review approve sponsor prior randomization , Treatment Phase extend first dose Cycle 1 Day 1 study drug discontinuation , Post-treatment Follow Phase begin participant discontinues talacotuzumab daratumumab . Study drug continue administer disease progression , lack response , unacceptable toxicity , withdrawal consent , study end . Safety monitor throughout study .</detailed_description>
