	<brief_summary>Iatrogenic infertility result cancer treatment profound effect long-term quality life survivor reproductive-age cancer . Oocyte cryopreservation prior cancer treatment associate improved quality life , potential ability reduce long-term decision-related regret cancer survivor . Though letrozole plus gonadotropin tamoxifen plus gonadotropin currently routinely use worldwide ovarian stimulation cycle fertility preservation patient estrogen-receptor-positive breast cancer , clear two might lead improve oocyte yield . Improved knowledge efficacy medication , regard oocyte yield , potential significantly improve quality life reproductive-age breast cancer survivor .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Fertility Preservation Using Tamoxifen Letrozole Estrogen Sensitive Tumors Trial</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Purpose : Our primary objective determine whether concomitant administration tamoxifen 20 mg oral gonadotropin ( tamoxifen-gonadotropin ) versus start dose letrozole 5 mg oral gonadotropin ( letrozole-gonadotropin ) result difference mature oocyte yield routine ovarian stimulation protocol fertility preservation Estrogen-Receptor-Positive ( ER+ ) breast cancer . Specific Aims : Each follow aim include primary comparison secondary comparison . Primary aim : The primary aim compare patient ER+ breast cancer treat letrozole-gonadotropin versus patient ER+ breast cancer treat tamoxifen-gonadotropin regard ovarian stimulation outcome . - Primary comparison : 1 ) To determine assigned stimulation regimen result difference mature ( meiosis II ) oocyte yield patient breast cancer undergo ovarian stimulation fertility preservation . - Secondary comparison : 1 . To compare estrogen , progesterone , androgen level ovarian stimulation cycle . 2 . To compare estrogen , letrozole , tamoxifen level follicular fluid . 3 . To compare duration stimulation ( day ) total gonadotropin dose ( international unit FSH ) . 4 . To assess embryo quality , applicable , day 3 day 5 embryo culture , measure developmental competence oocyte . - Experimental comparison : 1 . To compare clinical pregnancy rate cryopreserved tissue eventually utilized among patient assign stimulation regimen . This comparison label experimental remoteness outcome present study . Secondary Aim : We repeat comparison among patient ER+ breast cancer treat tamoxifen-gonadotropin versus prospectively-obtained reference group patient Estrogen-Receptor-Negative ( ER- ) breast cancer treat gonadotropin alone . We repeat comparison among patient ER+ breast cancer treat letrozole-gonadotropin versus patient ER- breast cancer treat gonadotropin alone . Experimental Design Methods : Study population : The target population reproductive-age woman recently diagnose ER+ breast cancer choose undergo oocyte embryo cryopreservation prior chemotherapy treatment . All eligible woman ask join study initial UCSF fertility preservation consult . Study participant recruit Reproductive Endocrinology Clinic University California , San Francisco Center Reproductive Health . A consecutive sample ER- disease also recruit type visit . They ask take part gonadotropin stimulation group , use secondary aim .</detailed_description>
