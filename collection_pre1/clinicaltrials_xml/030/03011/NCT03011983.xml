	<brief_title>Neural Injury Adolescents With Concussion</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Concussion highly prevalent condition adolescence , remain clinical diagnosis largely rely subjective patient report reliable objective biomarkers diagnosis . Traditional clinical brain imaging find useful concussion pathology generally visible conventional acute MRI CT . The propose study address gap concussion diagnosis management examine sensitivity magnetoencephalography ( MEG ) identify area brain injury detection abnormal neural activity ( slow ) adolescent concussion compare healthy control . Adolescents concussion complete neuroimaging ( MEG MRI ) neuropsychology assessment two time point within ten day 4 month post-injury . Healthy control complete neuroimaging neuropsychology assessment single time point .</detailed_description>
