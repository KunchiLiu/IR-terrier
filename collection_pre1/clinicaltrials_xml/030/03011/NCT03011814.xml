	<brief_summary>This phase I/II trial study best dose side effect durvalumab see well work without lenalidomide treat patient cutaneous peripheral T cell lymphoma come back respond treatment . Monoclonal antibody , durvalumab , may interfere ability cancer cell grow spread . Drugs use chemotherapy , lenalidomide , work different way stop growth cancer cell , either kill cell , stop dividing , stop spread . Giving durvalumab lenalidomide may work well treat patient cutaneous peripheral T cell lymphoma .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Durvalumab With Without Lenalidomide Treating Patients With Relapsed Refractory Cutaneous Peripheral T Cell Lymphoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To determine maximum tolerate dose ( recommended phase 2 dose , RP2D ) lenalidomide , give combination fixed-dose durvalumab . ( Phase 1 ) II . To assess safety tolerability lenalidomide/durvalumab regimen , accompany dose modification plan , evaluation toxicity include : type , frequency , severity , attribution , time course duration . ( Phase 1 ) III . To evaluate anti-tumor activity durvalumab ( MEDI4736 ) single agent therapy part combination therapy ( +lenalidomide ) ; activity assess overall response rate ( ORR ) . ( Phase 2 ) SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . To estimate assess response duration survival probability ( overall event-free ) . ( Phase 2 ) II . To summarize assess toxicity type , frequency , severity , attribution , time course duration . ( Phase 2 ) III . To assess clinically meaningful reduction pruritus ( CMRP ) patient CTCL ( critical quality life measure ) . ( Phase 2 ) TERTIARY OBJECTIVES : I . To identify malignant CD4+ T cell within skin microenvironment . II . To characterize spatial functional relationship malignant T cell immune cell , expression key immune checkpoint correlate response . III . To identify aberrantly express micro ( mi ) ribonucleic acid ( RNA ) involve cutaneous T-cell lymphoma ( CTCL ) messenger ( ) RNAs may predict response and/or treatment-related toxicity . IV . To evaluate whether identified miRNAs involve regulate key immune checkpoint . OUTLINE : This phase I , dose-escalation study lenalidomide follow phase II study . Patients randomize 1 2 arm , ARM I : Patients receive durvalumab intravenously ( IV ) 1 hour day 1 . Treatment repeat every 28 day 13 course absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . ARM II : Patients receive durvalumab IV 1 hour day 1 lenalidomide orally ( PO ) daily ( QD ) day 1-21 . Treatment repeat every 28 day 13 course absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . After completion study treatment , patient follow 12 month .</detailed_description>
