	<brief_summary>The aim randomize trial compare proportion patient achieve adequate bowel preparation 1-day split-dose 4-liter PEG-based bowel preparation regimen ( Golytely , Braintree Laboratory Inc , MA , USA ) vs. regimen give 2 consecutive day population identify high risk inadequate bowel preparation . 2 . Research Design : This study single-center prospective randomize study West Haven VAMC . 3 . Methodology : 1 . Primary endpoint : Adequate bowel preparation define Boston Bowel Preparation Scale ( BBPS ) score 2 3 ( scale 0-3 ) 3 colon segment ( leave , transverse , right ) . 2 . Secondary endpoint : Adenoma detection rate , polyp detection rate , sessile serrate polyp/adenoma detection rate , patient tolerability preparation use validated Mayo clinic bowel prep tolerability questionnaire , adverse event potentially relate bowel preparation Patients schedule routine outpatient colonoscopy eligible high risk poor bowel preparation ,</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Group 1 : One day split-dose Golytely 4L ( 2 liter evening procedure , 2 liter morning procedure ) Group 2 : Two day split-dose Golytely 4L ( begin 2 day procedure 2 liter even , 2 liter morning day procedure , 2 liter evening procedure , 2 liter morning procedure ) Patients instructed ingest 2-liter aliquot Golytely 2 hour . Diet : Both group instruct ingest low-residue diet begin 2 day procedure , ( attachment 2 ) last low-residual meal 4 pm day prior procedure , food day procedure . Clear liquid diet 4 pm day prior procedure clear liquid day procedure up-to 4 hour prior procedure . Education : Both group receive face face , pre-procedure education 1 week prior procedure . Patient come face-to-face education include study . Reminders : Both group receive telephone call 2 day prior procedure remind procedure remind take laxative preparation prescribe . Compliance : Patient receive educational handout bowel preparation colonoscopy . This practice standard patient receive colonoscopy institute . All Patients get copy low residual diet ask complete diet intake handout 2 day prior procedure . Patients request bring unused Golytely prep medication evaluate compliance . Tolerability : The tolerability bowel preparation assess use validate Mayo clinic bowel prep tolerability questionnaire . ( Attachment 3 ) On day procedure , member research team review patient 's diet previous 2 day , proportion bowel prep solution ingest , complication potentially relate preparation ( describe ) ; patient also complete Mayo tolerability questionnaire . Orthostatic vital sign check prior colonoscopy . Patient undergo colonoscopy endoscopist follow standard protocol WHVA MC . The bowel preparation score use BBPS polyp identify record remove standard fashion . Following discharge , patient receive telephone call within 2 day document post-procedure complication , include emergency room visit hospitalization .</detailed_description>
