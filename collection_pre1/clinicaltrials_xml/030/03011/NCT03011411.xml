	<brief_summary>Pragmatic study compare historical data usual collection tool medical administrative database ( local / national PMSI CRF / SNIIRAM ) . There 3 phase data collection : 1 . Collection hospitalization data local PMSI outpatient data CRF 2 . Collection hospitalization data national PMSI probabilistic match local national PMSI data 3 . Collection outpatient consumption data SNIIRAM match data national PMSI SNIIRAM .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Comparison Methods Collect Healthcare Consumption Data Patients Clinical Trials With Economic Evaluation</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>In study assess therapeutic intervention , economic evaluation require collection patient ' healthcare consumption . Two method primarily use accordance recommendation National Authority Health ( HAS ) : case report form ( CRF ) ambulatory care local hospital discharge database ( local PMSI ) - extract participate center - hospital care . However , conventional method limit . The first declarative mostly retrospective collection , often misinform unverifiable . The second provide high quality data far exhaustive concern hospitalization occur participate center , occur hospital . In France , medical administrative database SNIIRAM ( care reimburse statutory health insurance ) national PMSI ( hospital care ) `` gold standard '' collect consumer personal care . However , administrative difficulty associate access database prevent researcher extract routine care consumption data databases health economic study , despite fact unreliability conventional method objectify small number study literature . These study , conduct abroad seek compare declarative collection non-exhaustive medical administrative data . Moreover , compare number event collect implication economic evaluation use number , limit applicability result economic assessment . The main objective study evaluate performance usual collection tool compare gold standard ( medical administrative database ) estimate consumption inpatient outpatient care health economic evaluation . The secondary objective evaluate impact potential underestimation healthcare consumption estimate cost result economic assessment study variation calculate incremental cost-effectiveness ratio ( ICER ) conclusion evaluation . The COMERE population come study economic evaluation innovative therapeutic strategy conduct principal investigator 's research unity . These study include minimum collection hospital care consumption . This data collection must time start project . The procedure code study pathology alone allow investigator identify patient national PMSI probability great 0.9 . When add information available local PMSI , probability reach 0.99 . The principal investigator study agree use data study context research project . Overall , among study carry unit , 12 project fund Ministry Health 's program supporting fund expensive innovative technology ( STIC ) 1 national registry match study 's criterion retain . Of 13 study : 13 collect data hospital care consumption 8 collect data ambulatory care consumption . In total , study include 87 separate center 6,928 patient 2,661 ambulatory care collection . Their data completely anonymous .</detailed_description>
	<criteria>Among patient source population , patient include : Their initial hospital stay ( one innovative treatment strategy implement ) find local PMSI A probabilistic matching national PMSI possible probability equal 1 ( order compare data usual collection gold standard method ) . We exclude patient whose initial hospital stay find national PMSI linkable admission due cod error .</criteria>
