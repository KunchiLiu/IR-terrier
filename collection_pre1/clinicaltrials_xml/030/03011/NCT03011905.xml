	<brief_summary>Many patient strong pain brachial plexus block resolution operation distal radius fracture volar plate . This study investigate single dose dexamethasone addition standard pain regime effect postoperative pain . The primary endpoint difference high pain score first 24 hour surgery . The investigator also look pain score analgesic consumption first hour surgery different time 2 year surgery .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Rebound Pain After Operations Distal Radius Fractures With Volar Plate Brachial Plexus Block</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This double-blind randomized clinical study evaluate pain , analgesic consumption different measurement patient satisfaction operation distal radius fracture volar plate day-care surgery unit . All patient receive paracetamol etoricoxib oral premedication . Patients operate infraclavicular brachial plexus block ropivacaine 7,5 mg/ml . Patients intervention group receive single dose 16 mg dexamethasone operation . Patients control group receive NaCl iv . After surgery , iv oral rapid release oxycodone need hospital . After discharge ( 2-4 hour ) , etoricoxib 2 day , control release oxycodone , total 3 dos . Rapid release oxycodone need . Patients follow telephone interview different time surgery .</detailed_description>
