	<brief_summary>We hypothesize ACZ safely administer concomitantly TMZ patient malignant glioma regimen improve patient survival without increase toxicity unacceptable level . Information gather study contribute towards development future large phase II study tumor .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Phase I Study Safety Tolerability Acetazolamide With Temozolomide</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Malignant glioma diverse group tumor encompass WHO grade III WHO grade IV , glioblastoma ( GBM ) , tumor . Alkylating chemotherapy central management tumor temozolomide ( TMZ ) commonly use anti-glioma chemotherapeutic [ 1 ] . Standard treatment newly diagnose malignant glioma involve concomitant TMZ ionizing radiation ( IR ) . Despite routine use , many patient experience minimal benefit addition TMZ [ 2 ] . Given new chemotherapeutics approve GBM decade , identification strategy enhance efficacy TMZ important . In preliminary work , identify proto-oncogene , Bcl-3 , biomarker glioma predict response TMZ . In examine mechanism Bcl-3 promote resistance therapy , identify carbonic anhydrase II ( CAII ) unique factor Bcl-3-dependent induce TMZ . CAII potently inhibit oral CA inhibitor , acetazolamide ( ACZ , Diamox ) , FDA-approved agent use variety medical condition see patient glioma include epilepsy raise intracranial pressure . Importantly , use patient-derived GBM cell xenografts find ACZ sensitize GBM TMZ . Specifically , pre-clinical study show daily ACZ give combination TMZ extend 21 day TMZ initiation significantly prolong survival animal bear GBM xenograft compare TMZ alone . Primary Objective : To determine safety , tolerability adverse event profile add acetazolamide temozolomide patient newly diagnose malignant glioma . Secondary Objectives : 1 . To describe objective response rate ( ORR ) , progression free survival ( PFS ) overall survival ( OS ) . 2 . To determine feasibility accrual , adequacy eligibility criterion , define proportion patient enrol eligible case malignant glioma present weekly multidisciplinary Neuro-oncology tumor board University Chicago Medical Center . 3 . To evaluate Bcl-3 expression level within tumor preliminarily examine ability Bcl-3 predict response TMZ efficacy add ACZ .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Histologically proven , newly diagnose WHO grade III IV glioma . Patients eligible prior low grade glioma subsequent histological evidence diagnosis grade III IV tumor . Patients must receive TMZ part treatment regimen . Patients must ECOG performance status ≤1 Karnofsky performance ≥60 % ( see appendix A ) . Normal organ activity , include adequate bone marrow function define follow laboratory value : Absolute Neutrophil Count ( ANC ) ≥ 1.0 x 109/ L Platelets ≥ 80 x 109 / L Hemoglobin ≥ 8.0 g / dL Age ≥18 year . Because risk adverse event patient &lt; 18 year age , child exclude study , eligible future pediatric trial . Renal function ( creatinine level within normal institutional limit , creatinine clearance ≥ 60 mL/min/1.73 m2 patient creatinine level institutional normal ) . Liver function ( AST/ALT &lt; 2.5 X institutional upper limit normal , Total bilirubin ≤ 1.5 time ULN , INR within 1.5 time ULN ( receive anticoagulant therapy INR ≤ 3.0 allow concomitant increase PT aPTT ≤ 2.5 × control ) . Women childbearing potential must negative pregnancy test within 30 day registration . Patients must ability understand willingness sign write informed consent document . Prior invasive malignancy lowgrade glioma ( except nonmelanomatous skin cancer carcinoma situ cervix ) unless patient disease free therapy disease minimum 3 year . Active systemic infection require treatment , include HIV infection toxoplasmosis . Other severe acute chronic medical psychiatric condition , laboratory abnormality may increase risk associate study participation study drug administration . Systemic corticosteroid therapy , &gt; 2 mg dexamethasone daily ( equivalent ) study enrollment . Other severe acute chronic medical psychiatric condition , laboratory abnormality may increase risk associate study participation study drug administration may interfere interpretation study result judgment investigator would make patient inappropriate entry study . Pregnant woman exclude study , pregnancy confirm positive serum betahCG laboratory test . Breastfeeding discontinue .</criteria>
