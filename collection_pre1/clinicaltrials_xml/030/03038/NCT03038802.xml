	<brief_summary>This pilot study determine safety efficacy novel adjuvanted hepatitis B virus ( HBV ) vaccine formulate potential therapeutic vaccine chronic HBV infection . An ongoing human clinical trial HBV vaccine prophylactic setting confirm vaccine effective inducing seroconversion measure development Hepatitis B surface antibody ( HBsAb ) poor responder subject standard alum-adjuvanted HBV vaccine , provide promise new vaccine may also able induce HBV viral control and/or seroconversion chronically infected subject</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Randomised Controlled Phase 1 Study Vaccine Therapy Control Cure Chronic Hepatitis B Virus Infection</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Prophylactic immunisation HBsAg-based vaccine lead development HBsAg antibody provide protection HBV infection . Modern HBV vaccine base recombinant HBsAg produce expression yeast expression system . For infant whose mother HBsAg positive , first HBV vaccine dose give birth three dos administrate follow 12 month 2 , 4 6 12 month . Studies show HBV vaccine 90 95 % effective preventing child develop chronic infection yet infect . Since 1982 one billion dos HBV vaccine use worldwide . However number group poor response exist HBV vaccine include old adult ( age &gt; 40 ) patient immunodeficiency , diabetes renal impairment . A pilot clinical study demonstrate standard anti-HBV vaccination could reduce HBV replication 50 % chronic carrier . A multicentre trial , show efficacy limitation approach . This study include 118 treatment-naive patient , detectable serum HBV DNA use standard liquid hybridization study biopsy-proven chronic hepatitis pre-vaccination . Over 12-month period , give either five intradermal injection 20 Âµg pre S2 : S HBV vaccine ( GenHevac B.Pasteur-Merieux ) standard HBV vaccine ( Recombivax , MSD ) treatment . Three month first three vaccine injection , percentage serum HBV DNA negativity high vaccine group ( 15.5 % ) control group ( 2.7 % ) . After 1 year follow-up five vaccine injection , difference rate serum HBV DNA negativity , receive HBV vaccine significantly decrease HBV viral load 6 12 month compare control group . The rate HBe : anti-HBe seroconversion differ vaccinate unvaccinated group , early HBeAg negativity anti-HBe detection 6 month follow-up see vaccinated patient ( 8 15 % group B ( Recombivax . ) C ( GenHevac B . ) , respectively , compare 0 % control ) . Analysis vaccine-induced immune response 40 patient HBV chronic hepatitis vaccine trial show vaccination elicit T cell proliferative response 7 27 patient receive vaccine versus none unvaccinated control group . These specific response envelope antigen mediate CD4 T cell produce high level gamma interferon . The reduction serum HBV-DNA patient suggest induction CD4 T cell response could important control viremia vaccine therapy HBV chronic carrier . Experiments transgenic mouse constitutively express HBV liver model asymptomatic chronic HBV carrier show immunization overcome functional tolerance HBV induce specific antiviral immune response . The study vaccine test ability induce seroconversion HBV transgenic mouse model . The result confirm vaccine induce high titre anti-HBsAg antibody suppress HBV virus load liver . Importantly safety perspective evidence flare liver disease reflect elevation liver function test , see despite evidence vaccine suppress liver virus . The vaccinated mouse low level liver transaminase , consistent vaccine reduce virus-mediated damage liver . This study test hypothesis investigational vaccine boost HBV antibody T cell response chronically infected patient thereby improve HBV viral control opportunity seroconversion . As exploratory study , subject chronic HBV infection enrol whether current antiviral treatment . This allow comparison vaccine effect subject concomitant antiviral treatment , data use assist design future study . The study test hypothesis potent preS HBV vaccine include Advax adjuvant enhance humoral cellular immunity thereby help control chronic hepatitis B infection . The ultimate goal induce HBsAg seroconversion effect permanent clearance HBV minimum enable good immune control viral replication . This pilot study collect preliminary data safety efficacy vaccine approach chronically HBV infected individual , precursor large efficacy study future .</detailed_description>
