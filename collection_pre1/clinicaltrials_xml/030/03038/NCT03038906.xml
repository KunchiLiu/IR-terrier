	<brief_summary>The propose work determine effect neuromuscular blockade physical function recovery patient ARDS . The investigator conduct prospective ancillary study five PETAL clinical center evaluate neuromuscular structure function ROSE ( Reevaluation Systemic Early Neuromuscular Blockade ) patient critical illness , include in-person assessment 6 month hospital discharge . The investigator hypothesize patient randomize NMB increase ICU-acquired neuromuscular dysfunction critical illness .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The investigator assess dysfunction different way , appropriate patient ' stage critical illness anticipate recovery . During critical illness , investigator use nerve conduction study ( NCS ) ass nerve muscle function , identify presence early neuromyopathy ( primary outcome , Aim 1 ) . Additional early assessment include bedside ultrasound determine muscle mass echogenicity , index atrophy loss muscle architecture . Later acute hospitalization patient able participate testing , investigator use hand grip dynamometry ass muscle strength ( primary outcome , Aim 2 ) . Additional assessment time hand hold dynamometry determine proximal muscle strength , dual energy x-ray absorptiometry ( DEXA ) repeat ultrasound evaluate muscle mass , short physical performance battery ( SPPB ) ass activity . After hospital discharge—at 6 month ARDS—the investigator assess activity in-person use SPPB ( primary outcome , Aim 3 ) . Additional post-hospital assessment include detailed evaluation healthcare utilization , six minute walk test ( 6MWT ) determine endurance , repetition previous assessment muscle structure , function strength provide novel , detail information recovery process . Each aim test distinct hypothesis effect randomization NMB ICU-acquired neuromuscular dysfunction , investigate different time point aspects physical function , aim interdependent . For example , plausible direct toxicity NMB muscle lead early evidence neuromyopathy , manifest reduce muscle depolarization amplitude nerve stimulation . But NMB attenuate lung injury , strength may improve hospital discharge , despite early injury muscle .</detailed_description>
