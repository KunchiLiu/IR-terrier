	<detailed_description>Borderline resectable pancreatic cancer ( BRPC ) patient successfully underwent R0/R1 resection PDAs follow neoadjuvant chemotherapy , 1-3 month completion plan adjuvant chemotherapy enrol randomized 1:1 ratio two arm ( 56 per arm ) . Patients Arm A give anti-PD-L1 antibody , durvalumab , every 2 week maximum 26 dos radiographic evidence disease recurrence . Patients Arm B observe . Blood draw immune monitoring serum banking collect following time point : Arm A - Cycles 1 , 2 , 4 , 7 End Treatment ( EOT ) visit ; Arm B - Cycles 1 , 4 , 7 , End Treatment ( EOT ) visit</detailed_description>
