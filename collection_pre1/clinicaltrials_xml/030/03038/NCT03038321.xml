	<brief_summary>Compare different suppose clinical treatment side effect associate intravesical BCG levofloxacin ( quinolones ) vs solifenacin ( selective anti-muscarinic ) v lornoxicam ( NSAID )</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Solifenacin , Levofloxacin Lornoxicam , Which Is Ideal Management Intravesical Instillation BCG Side Effects ?</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>For urothelial carcinoma ( UC ) , account 90 % bladder cancer , 70 % bladder cancer patient present non‐muscle‐invasive disease . Approximately 40-80 % tumor recur within first year , 10-25 % progress muscle‐invasive disease . Intravesical treatment cytotoxic chemotherapy immunotherapy become mainstay follow transurethral resection ( TUR ) . Increasing knowledge BCG use allow effective management debilitate side effect . The majority patient still experience cystitis‐like symptom degree , include urinary frequency ( 71 % ) , cystitis ( 67 % ) , fever ( 25 % ) , hematuria ( 23 % ) . Oxybutynin increase fever , flu-like symptom , dry mouth constipation . However , study oxybutynin start night treatment cause element incomplete bladder empty allow increase BCG dwell time . We think effect reverse use anticholinergic 6 hour post BCG instillation Anti-inflammatory drug significantly reduce BCG-induced granulocyte activation impair BCG-induced lymphocyte cytotoxicity bladder tumor cell mice . The committee International Bladder Cancer Group ( IBCG ) recommend use anti-inflammatory agent ( NSAIDs ) treatment non-bacterial chemical cystitis systemic BCG side effect . Fluoroquinolone tuberculostatic property , show significantly prolong survival mouse BCG systemic infection affect antitumor efficacy BCG . ofloxacin significantly decrease 18.5 % incidence class II high moderate severe adverse event BCG . Because sparse publish study BCG side effect management , 2016 European Association Urology ( EAU ) guideline management option side effect associate intravesical BCG modify IBCG committee clinical practice without degree recommendation . So , study investigator try fill gap literature .</detailed_description>
