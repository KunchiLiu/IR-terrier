	<detailed_description>Obesity long recognize risk factor all-cause mortality morbidity , include development cardiovascular metabolic disease coronary artery disease , hypertension , insulin resistance , diabetes , dyslipidemia . Obesity recently formally define chronic disease characterize pathophysiological process result increase adipose tissue mass result increase morbidity mortality . Although health risk associate obesity clear , emerge appreciation obesity per se , define simple anthropometric measure waist circumference body mass index ( BMI ) , neither necessary sufficient promote cardiometabolic disease atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease ( ASCVD ) risk . As result , BMI alone insufficient marker risk may accurately identify individual elevate risk ASCVD . There press need accurately phenotype obesity identify individual elevate risk ASCVD may benefit intensive preventive therapeutic strategy</detailed_description>
