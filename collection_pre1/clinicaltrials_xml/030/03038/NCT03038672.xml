	<brief_title>Nivolumab With Without Varlilumab Treating Patients With Relapsed Refractory Aggressive B-cell Lymphomas</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To determine anti-malignant cell activity combination therapy varlilumab nivolumab compare nivolumab alone patient advance aggressive B-cell non-Hodgkin lymphoma ( NHL ) base revise Lugano classification response criterion . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . To assess safety tolerability profile treatment combination varlilumab nivolumab patient advance aggressive B-cell NHL . II . To evaluate duration response , progression-free survival overall survival . TERTIARY OBJECTIVES : I . To determine effect combination therapy varlilumab nivolumab immune system assess immunohistochemistry ( IHC ) , mass cytometry ( CyTOF ) change serum cytokine profile . OUTLINE : Patients randomize 1 2 group . GROUP I : Patients receive nivolumab intravenously ( IV ) 60 minute every 2 week 4 month every 4 week total 2 year absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . Patients may cross Group II time disease progression . GROUP II : Patients receive varlilumab IV 90 minute every 2 week 2 year absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . Patients also receive nivolumab IV 60 minute every 2 week 4 month every 4 week total 2 year absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . After completion study treatment , patient follow 100 day .</detailed_description>
