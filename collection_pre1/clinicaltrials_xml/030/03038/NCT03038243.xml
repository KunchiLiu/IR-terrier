	<brief_summary>This research study experimental ( investigational ) oral inactivated whole cell Shigella flexneri 2a kill vaccine ( Sf2aWC ) adjuvant call dmLT . Sf2aWC kill vaccine make prevent disease Shigella. , cause bloody , watery diarrhea . An adjuvant something added vaccine make work well . The purpose study see vaccine protect people Shigella infection without adjuvant call dmLT . About 72 healthy adult , age 18-45 , participate study . The study compare 2 different vaccination group 1 control group . Volunteers equal chance 3 group . Study procedures include : stool sample , blood sample document side effect . Participants involve study related procedure 6 month .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Safety , Immunogenicity Efficacy Study Inactivated Whole Cell Shigella Flexneri 2a Vaccine With Without dmLT Adults</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Despite public health burden Shigella spp . traveler , deploy soldier , significantly , young child develop world , licensed vaccine Shigella . The rationale use Shigella flexneri 2a whole cell kill vaccine ( Sf2aWC ) , expect especially well tolerated subject . This single site , 2a/2b , double-blind , randomize , placebo-controlled , study healthy adult subject . Approximately 72 subject enrol one three vaccination group : Sf2aWC 1011 Sf2aWC cell plus 10 Âµg dmLT ( Group 1 , n=24 ) , 1011 Sf2WC cell alone ( Group 2 , n=24 ) ; placebo ( Group 4 , n=24 ) . The placebo preparation bicarbonate buffer . After vaccination phase subject admit cohort day 84 inpatient facility 12 day undergo challenge approximately 1500 colony form unit ( CFU ) wild type S. flexneri 2a strain 2457T ( administer NaHCO3 buffer ) . After 5 day observation clinical endpoint ( early within 12 hour meet definition moderate-to-severe shigellosis define primary endpoint section ) , subject receive 5-day course orally administer ciprofloxacin . The primary objective study 1 ) evaluate , safety reactogenicity 3 oral sequential dos Sf2aWC without dmLT , 2 ) To measure protective efficacy 3 spaced dos high-dose Sf2aWC vaccine without dmLT moderate-to-severe shigellosis follow experimental oral challenge wild-type S. flexneri 2a 2457T</detailed_description>

Use medication affect immune function ( e.g. , corticosteroid others ) within 30 day precede first vaccination plan use active study period . 6 . Symptoms Traveler 's diarrhea associate travel country Shigella enteric infection endemic ( develop world ) within 1 year prior dose . 7 . History shigellosis Shigella vaccination challenge laboratory worker know exposure Shigella within last 6 month 8 . Prior receipt experimental Shigella vaccine live Shigella challenge within 3 year .</criteria>
