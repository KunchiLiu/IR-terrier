	<brief_summary>Atopic dermatitis , also call eczema , disease dry , scaly , itchy skin . Those atopic dermatitis may complications skin infection eczema herpeticum herpes simplex virus ( HSV ) infection . Symptoms eczema herpeticum include fever cluster itchy blister crust form sore . Although exposure HSV widespread , people clear virus subset individual atopic dermatitis develop eczema herpeticum . The purpose study determine individual atopic dermatitis high risk recurrent skin infection HSV . The study team compare people atopic dermatitis history recurrent eczema herpeticum , people atopic dermatitis without history eczema herpeticum , people without atopic dermatitis respond HSV .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Etiology Eczema Herpeticum ( EH )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This study use whole genome sequencing ( WGS ) technology identify genetic variant confer risk recurrent atopic dermatitis history eczema herpeticum ( ADEH+ ) , ≥3 eczema herpeticum ( EH ) episodes . A small subgroup individual atopic dermatitis ( AD ) suffer life-threatening disseminated herpes simplex virus ( HSV ) skin infection , term eczema herpeticum ( ADEH+ ) . The manifestation ADEH+ however simply consequence herpes simplex virus type 1 ( HSV-1 ) infection , since majority US population latently infect HSV-1 early age . Most importantly , bimodality recurrence eczema herpeticum ( EH ) episodes ; individual single episode subgroup ADEH+ individual 3 episode . This study aim conduct extreme trait investigation ADEH+ recurrent EH , ≥3 episodes , compare AD without history eczema herpeticum ( ADEH- ) , use whole genome sequencing .</detailed_description>
