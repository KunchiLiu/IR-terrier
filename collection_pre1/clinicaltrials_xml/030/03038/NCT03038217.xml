	<detailed_description>A prospective , observational study determine value circulate tumor DNA ( ctDNA ) predict therapeutic effect combine modality treatment colorectal cancer patient ' long-term prognosis . Research object : patient surgically resectable colorectal cancer . After give fully inform consent , prospective participant undergo classical combine modality treatment accord NCCN guideline . Serial analysis ctDNA perform specific time point include pre-treatment , ( post-NCRT NCRT patient ) , postoperative week 1 , post-ACT , postoperative year 1 , 2 , 3 . The next-generation sequencing surgical specimen perform well . Participants observe examined entire course treatment follow-up period . The 3 year disease free survival ( 3y-DFS ) primary end-point .</detailed_description>
