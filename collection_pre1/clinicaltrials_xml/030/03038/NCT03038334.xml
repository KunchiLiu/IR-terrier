	<brief_title>Magnesium Sulfate Improvement Cognition Patients With Alzheimer Disease</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Recent finding suggest magnesium may effective ameliorate symptom Alzheimer 's disease-like pathological progression reduce AÎ²-plaque , thus prevent synapse loss memory decline transgenic mouse . Common form include magnesium sulfate . As nutritional adjunct hyperalimentation , precise mechanism action magnesium uncertain . Predominant deficiency effect neurological , e.g. , muscle irritability , clonic twitching tremor . Hypocalcemia hypokalemia often follow low serum level magnesium . While large store magnesium present intracellularly bone adult , store often mobilize sufficiently maintain plasma level . Parenteral magnesium therapy repair plasma deficit cause deficiency symptom sign cease . To provide comprehensive clinical evaluation effect Magnesium sulfate AD patient , study design assess impact magnesium sulfate amyloid plaque generate valuable data clinical utility use diagnostic algorithm foundation development possible treatment .</detailed_description>
