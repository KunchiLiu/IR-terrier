	<brief_summary>While exact pathogenesis Intradialytic hypertension remain determined , several mechanism propose involve . The main factor determine arterial blood pressure peripheral vascular resistance cardiac output . The assumption increase blood pressure related increase peripheral vascular resistance dialysis session , due fluid removal fast reduction intravascular volume reduction . Using NICAS device ( Non-Invasive Cardiac System ) , hemodynamic profile patient intradialytic hypertension evaluate</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Hemodynamic Parameters Changes Course Hemodialysis Sessions Patients With Intradialytic Hypertension</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The number patient end stage renal disease ( ESRD ) grow worldwide nowadays hemodialysis ( HD ) treatment prevalent modality renal replacement therapy . Paradoxically increase BP immediately HD session observe patient . This phenomenon refer Intradialytic Hypertension ( IDH ) . The focus systolic BP increase ≥ 10 mmHg immediately hemodialysis result post-dialysis hypertension BP ≥130/80 mmHg . IDH affect 10-15 % hemodialysis patient . Patients IDH unfavorable outcome ; previous epidemiological data show IDH associate high cardiovascular morbidity mortality rate . From view hemodynamic profile , peripheral resistance cardiac output important factor contribute arterial blood pressure . The pathogenesis IDH likely multifactorial . Several mechanism propose involved pathogenesis phenomenon . Endothelial dysfunction , increased activity renin angiotensin aldosterone system ( RAAS ) activation sympathetic nervous system show involved increase blood pressure Hemodialysis group patient . None possible explanation inter-relationships study controlled experimental set actual physiological change hemodialysis intradialytic hypertensive patient still remain unexplored . The NICAS ( Non-Invasive Cardiac System ) device , use mainly noninvasive cardiac diagnostic purpose , substantially equivalent use hemodynamic evaluation tool , yet non-invasive provide on-line data regard hemodynamic status patient . Using device , hemodynamic change HD session IDH patient investigate . By use NICAS device , hemodynamics parameter change dialysis session measure . The parameter measure heart rate , stroke volume , cardiac index , cardiac power index total peripheral vascular resistance . During hemodialysis treatment several hemodynamic change may occur due intravascular volume reduction . Changes peripheral vascular resistance , cardiac output cardiac power index contribute hemodynamic stability dialysis session . By use non-invasive technique , NICAS device , hemodynamic change occur hemodialysis session evaluate . An increase blood pressure correlate increase peripheral vascular resistance and/or increase cardiac output , reflect adjustment fast change intravascular volume . Aim study The hemodynamic change occur dialysis session patient intradialytic hypertension use NICAS device evaluate . Methods This observational prospective study examines hemodynamic parameter immediately dialysis session . The hemodynamic data collect investigator study period . These parameter obtain start dialysis session , every hour dialysis session end .</detailed_description>
