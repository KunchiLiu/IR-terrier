ED patient randomise targeted non-targeted arm consenting participate . Eighty patient assign study arm . Participating patient issue electronic tablet invite follow instruction screen . Targeted arm patient invite complete questionnaire HIV risk factor , one risk factor present , informed HIV test indicated invited take free rapid HIV test . Non-targeted arm patient provide information HIV HIV test invited take free rapid HIV test without question regard risk factor .
