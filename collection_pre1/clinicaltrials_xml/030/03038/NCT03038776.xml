	<brief_summary>Recombinant H7 ( rH7 ) vaccine show poorly immunogenic previous human clinical trial . This study test approach improve immunogenicity H7 vaccine , namely use three dose regimen , use modify H7 HA sequence Tregitope remove ( rH7m ) , inclusion delta inulin adjuvant adjuvant vaccine</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Recombinant H7 Hemagglutinin Influenza Vaccine Trial</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Because antibody response experimental H7 vaccine low even high antigen dos , need find way enhance effectiveness H7 vaccine . Protein Sciences Corporation ( PSC ) produce FDA approve seasonal recombinant trivalent influenza vaccine consist influenza hemagglutinin protein ( HA ) full length uncleaved glycoprotein ( rHA0 ) produce use baculovirus expression vector culture insect cell grow serum-free medium ( FluBlokÂ® ) . The mechanism action FluBlok traditional inactivate seasonal influenza vaccine . PanBlok H7 pandemic influenza vaccine produce PSC way Flublok direct H7 rather seasonal influenza virus strain . The vaccine candidate consist full-length recombinant monovalent hemagglutinin ( rHA ) derive H7N9 virus , sterile solution intramuscular injection . PanBlok H7 rHA manufacture use production process previously use Panblok H1/2009pdm ( `` swine flu '' ) Panblok H5 pandemic vaccine , vaccine previously successfully trialled u clinical protocol , FLU005 FLU003 . In trial Panblok antigen combine Advax adjuvant formulation . In FLU005 trial Panblok H1N1/2009pdm vaccine , inclusion Advax adjuvant double seroconversion rate vaccine provide major antigen-sparing effect ( Gordon et al , 2012 ) . Whilst FLU003 trial ongoing , preliminary data show importance Advax adjuvant vaccine effectiveness . This provide strong rationale inclusion Advax adjuvant Panblok H7 vaccine . It also recently recognise least one reason low immunogenicity H7 vaccine human trial date H7 antigen virus contain T-cell regulatory epitope ( Tregitope ) HA stem region suppress immune response vaccine . It recently demonstrate humanised animal study undertake collaborator Japan remove Tregitope modify 3 amino acid H7 stem able significantly increase ability H7 vaccine induce antibody production human immune cell . This trial provide first opportunity confirm approach able enhance immunogenicity H7 human , confirm would represent major breakthough pandemic influenza vaccine design .</detailed_description>
