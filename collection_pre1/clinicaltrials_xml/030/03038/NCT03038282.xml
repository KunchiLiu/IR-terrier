	<detailed_description>Chromium essential nutrient require optimal insulin activity normal carbohydrate lipid metabolism . Beyond nutritional effect , dietary supplement chromium cause beneficial outcome several disease , particular diabetes-associated complication Alzheimer Disease . Common form include chromium chloride , chromium nicotinate , chromium picolinate . The argument chromium supplementation rely evidence case report resolution diabetic symptom refractory insulin via chromium add total parenteral nutrition , experiment animal deficient chromium exhibit impaired glucose metabolism . Chromium may influence glucose metabolism increase number insulin receptor bind insulin receptor . The US Food Drug Administration conclude , base recent study , chromium picolinate may reduce risk insulin resistance therefore may reduce risk type 2 diabetes . A number systematic review meta-analyses conducted determine effect chromium glycemic control , although large , quality trial limit . The majority study find effect measure outcome , study contribute positive observed effect . Variations preparation use trial study condition make generalization result difficult . In order provide comprehensive clinical evaluation effect Chromium AD patient , conduct double-blinded placebo-controlled trial subject AD .</detailed_description>
