	<detailed_description>Pre-dialysis chronic kidney disease ( CKD ) associate high risk harm relate medical care ( adverse safety event ) . These event may occur outside purview medical system , hence , under-recognized . Health information technology ( IT ) enhance detection event , coordinate care prevent adverse consequence . Study design : 6-month randomized trial coordinate care/home telehealth ( CCHT ) vs usual care CKD patient . Intervention : Veterans Administration ( VA ) CCHT guideline-based CKD DMP , augment laboratory monitoring , decision support VA Renal Inter-disciplinary Safety clinic ( RISC ) . Study population : Veterans Stage III-V CKD ( expect dialysis within 6 month ) , age â‰¥ 60 year old , diabetes ( n = 65 per arm ) . Study Site : Baltimore VA Medical Center ( BVAMC ) , VA Geriatrics Research , Education Clinical Center ( GRECC ) , RISC . Specific Aim 1 : Compare detection adverse safety event CKD patient assign CCHT v usual care . Specific Aim 2 : Compare frequency urgent health service use participant satisfaction CCHT v usual care group . Study Measurements : Vital sign clinical measurement ( daily BP , weight , finger stick glucose ) , laboratory value , patient- report safety event obtain per CCHT protocol v patient-reported safety event , laboratory value , assessment mid-study safety clinic visit usual care protocol . Emergency department ( ED ) visit , hospitalization , renal progression , incidence ESRD , death measure group along patient satisfaction . Outcomes : Aim 1 : Counts diverse set adverse safety event include hypoglycemia , hypotension , volume loss ( weight change ) , hyperkalemia , acute kidney injury ( AKI ) , patient-reported safety incident . Aim 2 : ED visit , hospitalization , adverse outcome include renal function loss , ESRD , death . Analytic plan : Adjusted rate event track Aim 1 2 express count per month compare CCHT v usual care group multivariate model indicate . Expected finding : CCHT increase detection adverse safety event reduce urgent health resource utilization adverse outcome . Public Health Relevance : Home telemonitoring CKD patient conjunction coordinate care decision support increase detection adverse safety event occur outside traditional health care system offer new opportunity reduce associate poor outcome platform allow ready dissemination across national health network .</detailed_description>
