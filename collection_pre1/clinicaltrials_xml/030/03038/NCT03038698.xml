	<detailed_description>Pulmonary function test widely use tool diagnosis , severity assessment , management , risk factor categorization follow-up individual chronic lung disease . Africa high burden infectious respiratory disease include tuberculosis human immunodeficiency virus-related lung disease.Coupled increase burden non-communicable respiratory disease ; include chronic obstructive pulmonary disease , emphysema , bronchiectasis asthma [ 1,2 ] . The management collide epidemic require correct diagnosis management order ensure adequate resource allocation avoidance unnecessary cost . A proviso use lung function test determination `` normal '' value ; determine age , gender , height ethnicity relevant population [ 3 ] . These `` normal ' value also take account normal lung function decline associate age process . It well recognise comparison individual patient ' result ethnically inappropriate population may lead -over diagnosis disease , inappropriate treatment result increase burden individual , family healthcare system [ 4-6 ] . There numerous publish reference equation , recently publish Global Lung Initiative multi-ethnic reference equation publish 2012 ( GLI2012 ) collate large spirometry data set individual age 2.5 95 year [ 7 ] . The innovation GLI2012 allow smooth transition data childhood adulthood use sophisticated statistical modelling . We previously collate data phase 1 study use GLI methodology publish African spirometry data 26 594 individual , find wide variation predict z-scores fitting African data GLI2012 , fairly good match black African male African-Americans [ 15 ] . This dataset skew due large number African male disproportionally large contribution data North Africa therefore require confirmation . We therefore propose conduct prospective well-designed study include representative sample adult child ( 4000 ) ; verify validity retrospective pilot data , South African population .</detailed_description>
