	<brief_summary>Preeclampsia ( PE ) one common type hypertensive disorder complicate pregnancy ( HDCP ) . It class clinical syndrome show relevant symptom , hypertension proteinuria 20 week pregnant main characteristic , may accompany fetal anomaly systemic multi-system organ damage . Several complication , eclamptic seizure , coma , intracranial hemorrhage ( ICH ) , cardiac failure , pneumonedema , hepatic failure , kidney failure , placental abruption disseminate intravascular coagulation ( DIC ) , may threat life mother well fetal . Thus , disease one core issue cause maternal perinatal death . Morbidity PE approximately 3 % 5 % . Morbidity significant difference different population . According data , 1995 2004 , HDCP morbidity four hospital Guangzhou 5.78 % , HDCP , mild preeclampsia severe preeclampsia account 72.22 % 27.78 % respectively . Meanwhile , HDCP morbidity decrease 9.4 % ( 1984 1989 ) 5.57 % ( 1989 1998 ) . In 1996 , American Congress Obstetricians Gynecologists ( ACOG ) give new classification HDCP base characteristic disease symptom , divide five group ; gestational hypertension , preeclampsia , eclampsia , chronic hypertension complicate preeclampsia chronic hypertension . The pathogenesis PE remain unclear far . The frequent sight PE cause multiple reaction number factor affect . Physiologically , mainly alter PE increase blood viscosity systemic vascular spasm cause hypoxic-ischemic multiple key organ , placenta , kidney , liver brain . The research theory include abnormal trophoblast invasion , immune response abnormal increase , genetic susceptibility , coagulation disorder thrombophilia , abnormal angiogenesis , endothelial cell damage , abnormal level carbonic oxide , increase oxygen radical , abnormal metabolism calcium ion , heterotrophia . However , number epidemiologic study analyze high risk factor PE provide significant medical evidence prevention , early diagnosis early treatment PE , little study focus susceptibility gene pathogenic genetic variation . Nowadays , numerous clinical phenotype consider exist , different phenotype give different inheritance epigenetics . Thus , group examine onset type characteristic PE retrospective cohort study discuss susceptibility gene pathogenic genetic variation exist PE patient , also find relativity clinical phenotype genotype . Moreover , study try reach effect PE patient ' health well child . Thus , predict health status PE patient child , prevent ( avoid delay ) patient late complication disease child .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>China Obstetrics Alliance Cohort Study</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>1 . All female staff work , examination delivery Third Affiliated Hospital Guangzhou Medical University Dec 1995 Dec 2016 cohort . Collect information ; include clinical examination medical examination , science subject work hospital . Collect perinatal data ; include obstetric information , past medical history , family history . Build database analyze relative factor . 2 . From subject , choose subject get PE experimental group . Pair age , gestational week , child 's gender healthy subject control group ratio 1:1 . The control group exclude subject ever get heart lung disease , diabetes , chronic nephrosis , immune disease hereditary disease . Store blood sample ( serum , blood plasma ) experimental group control group child . Compare differences functional parameter two group delivery , include blood pressure , blood glucose blood lipid . Moreover , compare function heart , liver kidney genetic material ( DNA RNA ) . 3 . Diagnostic standard PE refer People 's Medical Publishing House &lt; Obstetrics Gynecology &gt; 8th edition . Confirm diagnostic standard HDCP relative disease include PE make sure veracity uniformity diagnosis .</detailed_description>
