	<brief_summary>This hypothesis-generating pilot study . The intent model impact perioperative practice intestinal microbiome possibly associate condition final microbiome status ( e.g. , number resistance gene diversity associate perioperative practice preoperative microbiome status ) . Participants include individual surgery either receive donate kidney . To determine diversity change intestinal microbiota time , rectal swab collect surgery several time point surgery , last swab collect 30 day surgery . This pilot study obtain preliminary data support rationale design subsequent clinical trial . This study design understand intestinal microbiota diversity set renal transplant surgery clinical significance antibiotic use associate resistome ( collection antibiotic resistance gene precursor within sample ) .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Characterization Of Intestinal Microbiome Evolution After Kidney Transplant Donation Receipt</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The emergence multidrug resistant organism ( MDROs ) grow threat global public health associate high morbidity mortality general solid organ transplant population . Intestinal microbiota diversity provide functional spatial barrier bacterial fungal MDRO colonization , loss diversity associate increase MDRO colonization . Dysbiosis state loss microbiota diversity single antibiotic treatment course cause significant disruption microbiota diversity , even otherwise healthy individual . This disruption promote growth pathogenic multidrug-resistant bacteria fungi . Transplant patient , particular , increased risk colonization infection MDRO immunomodulatory therapy , healthcare exposure , increase antibiotic exposure surgical manipulation mucosa . Furthermore , chronic kidney disease dialysis therapy lead transplant show associated alteration intestinal periodontal microbiome . Understanding evolution disruption intestinal microbiome kidney transplant recipient healthy kidney transplant donor time transplant surgical prophylaxis give valuable insight avenue research possible intervention may mitigate risk MDRO colonization . This prospective , observational , non-interventional pilot study aim enroll 100 adult renal transplant recipient 100 adult renal transplant donor . Participants provide stool sample anal swab sample , complete dietary questionnaire . Participants may also choose take part two , optional sub-studies involve complete additional dietary assessment . The diversity change intestinal microbiota time assess screen visit , Post-Operative Day 2 ; Post-Discharge Day 15 Post-Discharge Day 30 . Participants follow way medical record review 24 week post-surgery . This study design understand intestinal microbiota diversity set renal transplant surgery clinical significance antibiotic use associate resistome ( collection antibiotic resistance gene precursor within sample ) . Information learn study use guide design future clinical trial .</detailed_description>
