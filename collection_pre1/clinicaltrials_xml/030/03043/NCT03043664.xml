	<brief_summary>This study patient non-resectable , recurrent , metastatic well moderately differentiate gastroenteropancreatic neuroendocrine tumor ( GEP-NETs ) . The study conduct two stage : 1 ) Safety Run-In 2 ) Expanded Cohort . 1 . Safety run-in : The first stage include safety run-in 6 patient treat pembrolizumab 200 mg intravenous ( IV ) every 3 week lanreotide depot 90mg subcutaneous ( SQ ) every 3 week . Up 6 patient Duke Cancer Institute accrue start dose level . If one less subject meet treatment-related discontinuation criterion ( specify protocol ) Cycle 1 , study proceed second stage , Expanded Cohort . 2 . Expanded Cohort : Patients treat pembrolizumab 200mg IV every 3 week lanreotide depot 90mg SQ every 3 week determine Safety Run-In Cohort .</brief_summary>
