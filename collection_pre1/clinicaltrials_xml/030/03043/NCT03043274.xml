	<brief_title>Cangrelor ST-Elevation Myocardial Infarction Decrease Infarct Size</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Cangrelor direct-acting reversible intravenously administer platelet inhibitor approve adjunct percutaneous intervention ( PCI ) reduce risk periprocedural myocardial infarction , repeat coronary revascularization , stent thrombosis . As quick onset action ( 2 minute ) compare traditional oral platelet inhibitor , cangrelor emerge important new option use patient undergo percutaneous intervention treat oral platelet inhibitor . Furthermore , multiple study demonstrate patient ST-elevation myocardial infarction ( STEMI ) undergo emergent PCI optimal platelet inhibition even administration load dose traditional oral platelet inhibitor . However , clinical significance complete platelet inhibition around time PCI fully understood . The primary objective characterize utility immediate platelet inhibition intravenous cangrelor patient present acute STEMI assess extent infarct size ( either enzymatically image ) . If finding favorable , may suggest immediate platelet inhibition important part care patient population .</detailed_description>
