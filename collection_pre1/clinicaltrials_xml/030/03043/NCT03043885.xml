	<brief_summary>Improved predictability quality bone heal tooth remove clinically relevant , , improve ability achieve successful implant placement edentulous site . Currently , variety graft material biologic agent utilized clinically improve bone heal provide sufficient dimension bone support dental implant . Platelet rich fibrin ( PRF ) one product use application . PRF concentrate blood product attain patient 's blood consist natural bioscaffold integrated growth factor capable sustained release . Once process , PRF implant back patient wound defect site encourage healing . The literature regard PRF currently dominate heterogeneous application PRF reparative regenerative therapy without consensus clinical efficacy appropriate application . In clinical study , PRF evaluate ascertain clinical efficacy improve bone formation alveolar dimensional stability tooth extraction . A classic bone graft material use purpose , freeze dry bone allograft ( FDBA ) , incorporate PRF compare directly PRF alone . It hypothesize natural scaffold incorporate growth factor PRF augment solubility resistance FDBA function ideal bioscaffold promote bone heal great extent compare PRF , FDBA , blood clot alone .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Ridge Preservation With Platelet Rich Fibrin Augmented With Freeze Dried Bone Allograft</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This randomize controlled clinical study evaluate efficacy four treatment modality ridge preservation extraction tooth preparation dental implant placement . After tooth extraction alveolar crest remodels heal reduction vertical horizontal dimension . The result reduced dimension heal alveolar crest may inadequate successfully place dental implant replace miss tooth . In attempt minimize reduction dimension provide mature healthy bone support dental implant , different ridge preservation technique ( treatment extraction socket ) utilize . Forty subject UCSF Dental School tooth extract replaced dental implant randomly assign four ridge preservation treatment group . After three month heal bone sample ridge preservation site collect implant placement bone remove osteotomy preparation implant . Samples evaluate extent quality bone heal via histomorphometric micro-CT analysis . Clinical measure alveolar ridge dimension take tooth extraction determine extent dimensional stability different treatment group . The four treatment modality ridge preservation include autologous platelet rich fibrin ( PRF ) , PRF+freeze dry bone allograft ( FDBA ) , FDBA , collagen barrier membrane . Subjects enrol study time socket treat time implant placement ( 3 month ) . The result study help elucidate extent quality bone heal use four different method ridge preservation preparation implant placement . Further , study advance knowledge PRF , autologous source blood product use dentoalveolar surgery prove in-vitro quality still require extensive clinical test demonstrate full clinical utility .</detailed_description>
