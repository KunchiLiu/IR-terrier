	<brief_title>Study Treat Major Depressive Disorder With New Medication</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Depressive disorder among disable medical condition worldwide currently available treatment fall short address large public health burden . Dysfunction within brain reward system emerge core feature depressive disorder , particular relate deficit motivation , interest , response pleasure ( e.g. , anhedonia : markedly diminish response pleasure ) . Evidences series preclinical study group highlight KCNQ subtype neuronal potassium ( K+ ) channel novel target treatment depressive disorder human pilot study show reduction anhedonia relate symptom , increase brain response reward ( measure functional magnetic resonance image [ fMRI ] ) follow treatment ezogabine . Building data , current project ass reward circuit activity follow treatment ezogabine depress patient current depressive disorder ( Major depressive disorder [ MDD ] , persistent depressive disorder , specify depressive disorder ) anhedonia ( define score ≥ 20 Snaith-Hamilton Pleasure Scale [ SHAPS ] ) , use fMRI investigate cortico-striatal circuit reward . This study represent first part R61/R33 National Institutes Health ( NIH ) found project . A clear increase reward circuit activation least one ezogabine treatment group compare placebo , give acceptable tolerability , constitute `` go '' project move next phase ( R33 ) , aim examine relationship treatment , reward circuit activity , behavioral clinical outcome large , confirmatory efficacy trial ezogabine depression anhedonia .</detailed_description>
