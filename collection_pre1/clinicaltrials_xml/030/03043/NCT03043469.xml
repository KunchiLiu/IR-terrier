	<brief_summary>Dysfunctional breathing ( DB ) respiratory condition characterise abnormal breathing pattern , among complaint , occur either absence pathophysiology ( primary DB ) , e.g . anxiety-related factor , secondary cardiopulmonary disease ( secondary DB ) , e.g . asthma . As consequence , patient may experience breathlessness present period increase ventilation erratic breathing , interspersed episode breath hold deep sigh . In addition respiratory symptom , DB also generate non- respiratory symptom ( e.g . dizziness increase heart rate ) . It estimate 1 10 people United Kingdom ( UK ) DB . However , DB remain poorly understood , standardised approach diagnosis assessment . The purpose study : Study 1 ) To identify physiological , functional psychological characteristic participant DB compare healthy participant . Firstly , symptom , lung function , respiratory gas analysis , exercise capacity , respiratory muscle function , respiratory motion , level physical activity , quality life anxiety &amp; depression score assess 20 participant primary DB , 20 secondary DB compare 20 healthy participant . Study 2 ) To develop assessment tool base physiological , functional psychological variable find different 3 group Study 1 . In order , 54 people DB ( primary secondary ) 27 people present breathlessness secondary restrictive lung disease assess . Analysis data determine whether variable use diagnostic tool capable distinguish DB restrictive lung disease characterise breathlessness . The recruitment period 1-2 year , individual participation 9 day ; 1-day site testing , plus 7-day home activity monitoring , 1 day return activity monitor ( happen whenever participant need return site ) .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>In research , aim : 1 ) characterise compare participant primary dysfunctional breathing ( DB ) , secondary DB healthy participant , 2 ) develop assessment identification tool population DB , 3 ) identify subgroups people DB base functional , physiological psychological characteristic . In order , Study 1 , comparison many different aspect ( describe ) three group 20 participant : primary DB , secondary DB healthy participant . With result comparison , possible know difference people DB relation healthy population , describe main characteristic . Based , Study 2 , possible select variable different group replicate test extra 54 participant DB ( primary secondary ) 27 breathlessness secondary restrictive lung disease ( DB exclude ) . The second stage suggest test use identify evaluate population , statistically identify subgroup people DB base characteristic . It important note inclusion healthy participant participant breathlessness secondary restrictive lung disease important research programme . Firstly , essential know main characteristic DB relation healthy population . Secondly , assessment tool able suggest probability negative diagnosis DB people DB , positive diagnosis . There standardised criterion available diagnose DB . However , experience chest physician Guy 's St Thomas ' Foundation Trust ( GSTFT ) identify probable DB , provide clinical diagnosis ( CD ) accord follow criterion : patient present symptom concordant severity underlie health condition ( case secondary DB ) , patient present symptom persist despite optimal disease management and/or objective marker deterioration/exacerbation ( case secondary DB ) , patient present symptom presence negative test organic cause/medically unexplained ( case primary DB ) , patient present symptom consider functional ( case primary DB ) . Ability comprehend and/or perform procedure research , well presence major orthopaedic , neurological cardiac condition check Leyla Osman Chest physicians via medical record possible participant approach receive information study . For example : health condition patient present impairment mental faculty and/or motor function ( inability cycle discomfort ) . Healthy participant contact via email list Brunel University London , via flyer place University 's Hospital 's website mural ( attach ) . Participants restrictive lung disease reach person via telephone call refer respiratory physiotherapy , via flyer place Hospital 's mural . Because plenty patient DB , already register Hospital 's system present DB ( assess chest physician ) call . New patient DB contact person via telephone call respiratory physiotherapist clinical team ( Leyla Osman ) . If contact research interested take part study , provide participant information sheet , opportunity ask question may check meet inclusion criterion . Before start assessment , ask sign inform consent . When sign inform consent , participant ask question : Please , tick box authorise researcher study access medical record Please , tick box aware General practitioner inform participation research Please , tick box would like receive report result test perform study ( within 30 day end assessment ) Please , tick box would like u contact future inform final result study Please , tick box participate study/ies moment . If yes , please mention this/these study/ies is/are contact person responsible The assessment perform Lais Silva Vidotto ( respiratory physiotherapist researcher ) Hospital/University period approximately 3 hour . Many assessment form part routine hospital investigation patient DB . Duration may vary depend individual need limitation , time give recover physical mental effort . Secondly , physical activity monitor give participant , return researcher next medical appointment Hospital/classes University ( class University case healthy participant ) . During 3-hour assessment opportunity rest whenever necessary snack refreshment provide interval ( caffeine-free ingredient ) . Assessments approximate duration follow : demographic information ( 10 minute ) , health-related quality life questionnaire ( SF-36 ) ( 5 minute ) , Hospital anxiety depression scale ( HADS ) ( 5 minute ) , Nijmegen questionnaire ( NQ ) ( 5 minute ) , Self-evaluation breathing questionnaire ( SEBQ ) ( 5 minute ) , Asthma Questionnaire ( asthmatic ) ( 5 minute ) , lung function test ( 30 minute ) , respiratory muscle function ( 30 minute , assessment respiratory movement ( MARM ) ( 10 minute ) , breath-hold test ( BHT ) ( 20 minute ) , slow-breathing task ( 15 minute ) sub-maximal exercise test ( 10 minute ) ( two last test participant wear small light-weight device monitor heart activity , breathe function blood pressure take 15 minute place together ) . Day 1 : Hospital assessment ( ~3 hour ) The test perform private room St Thomas ' Hospital Brunel University London . Participants advise stay 48 hour without practice exercise . Also , instruct take medicine normally use report name dose examiner . 1 . Patients ask medical history , date birth symptom . Also , participant ' weight height measure . 2 . Chest movement breathe : At stage , participant go stand still researcher place hand back chest order evaluate movement participant breathe . This go take 10 minute . 3 . Slow-breathing task : Participants instruct breathe slower ( 6-10 bpm ) minute ( 5-15 minute ) keep wear mask , heart rate monitor arterial blood pressure monitor task . 4 . Exercise test , breathe cardiovascular function : Light-weight device attach participant ' chest ( cardiac monitor ) , order evaluate heart function , face ( mask-gas analyser ) ass respiratory function , non-dominant arm ( arm finger ) , assess blood pressure . The device use assess blood pressure continuously measure pulse finger , calibrate arm cuff , discomfort participant . Those assessment perform participant rest five minute , cycle bicycle moderate resistance six minute , rest five minute . Just exercise test , third minute , , participant ask leg breathe discomfort mindful relation discomfort relate task . Approximate time task : 16 minute . 5 . Questionnaires : Participants ask fill questionnaire ask breathe quality life take 25 minute complete . Participants ask complete questionnaire opportunity ask question . 6 . Breath hold test : Participants ask hold breath long 3 time , rest 5 minute one , researcher use stopwatch order count time able . The whole task last approximately 20 minute . 7 . Lung respiratory muscle function assessment : Researchers use three device measure function participant ' lung respiratory muscle . They ask breathe several different way , wear nose clip , researcher record general breathing function . This go take one hour finish . At end assessment session , participant instruct use device measure level physical activity . Days 2-8 : Physical Activity Monitoring Participants ask wear two small activity monitor attach hip 7 consecutive day , keep routine normal possible . Participants use equipment least 8 hours/day awake , exclude water activity ( e.g . shower ) sleeping , write exact time put time take . Day 9 : Return activity monitor Participants recruit Brunel University London return physical activity monitor researcher next visit University ( class , meeting etc . ) ; recruit GSTFT return next hospital appointment . Although study require cross-sectional design , may take long period complete , since patient DB easily identify referred health professional receive specific diagnosis treatment . Considering difficulty find participant DB , justify fact establish way identify patient , research may take 1-2 year complete . However , It enable researcher look every single result rigorous quality data collect . In order , researcher wait assessment finish process plot data . Every time participant evaluate , result organise plotted within next day . It also enable data statistically analyse need .</detailed_description>
