	<brief_summary>HYPOTHESIS : Investigators hypothesize provision care household level community lady health worker effective ( recovery rate , burden SAM , cost effective , coverage ) health care provider facility level . OBJECTIVES 1 . To evaluate effectiveness ( rate recovery , burden &amp; coverage ) , SAM standard management child 06-59 month deliver household level first level health care provider ( Lady health worker ) compare standard CMAM program deliver health facility Govt./ACF staff . 2 . To evaluate cost effectiveness treatment SAM provide LHWs community level versus treatment deliver health facility Govt/ACF staff . STUDY DESIGN : Cluster randomize control trial SAMPLE SIZE &amp; RANDOMIZATION : Investigators take 6 % prevalence calculate sample size expect reduction 20 % . A sample size 3 cluster per group 150 individual per cluster need . STUDY METHODOLOGY Intervention ( Group A ) : LHWs identify treat case severe acute malnutrition ( SAM ) per study eligibility criterion ( MUAC &lt; 11.5 cm ) manage case SAM without complication home follow national CMAM guideline . Control ( Group B ) : LHWs identify SAM per CMAM guideline ( MUAC &lt; 11.5 cm ) refer case health facility ( ACF ) management counsel health worker facility .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>INTRODUCTION &amp; RATIONALE : There good evidence success CMAM program treat SAM emergency humanitarian crisis [ 1 ] , little regard cost effective mechanism deliver add value integrate treatment acute malnutrition treatment common childhood illness and/or extensive communitybased nutritional program . HYPOTHESIS : Provision SAM treatment household level community lady health worker effective ( recovery rate , survival , cost effectiveness , coverage ) treatment provide facility level . RESEARCH QUESTION : Will SAM treatment deliver LHW household level effective SAM treatment deliver facility level health center staff ? PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : To evaluate effectiveness ( rate recovery , relapse &amp; coverage ) , SAM treatment child 6-59 month deliver household level first level health care provider ( Lady health worker ) compare standard CMAM program deliver health facility Government ACF staff . To evaluate cost effectiveness treatment SAM provide LHWs community level versus treatment deliver health facility Government ACF staff . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : To evaluate characterization breast feed complementary feeding practice study arm . To identify main socio-economic characteristic household study arm . STUDY DESIGN : The study 2-armed cluster randomize control trial target child 60-59 month mother treatment prevention acute severe malnutrition child . Each cluster allocate intervention group A , control group B . Cost-effectiveness analysis : Cost effectiveness calculate reflect full range resource require service provider household . A societal perspective take data collect household cost incurred participation community facility base activity . The approach capture resource use regardless incurs , use cost analysis similar program . Costs calculate combination accounting record estimate derive `` ingredient '' approach , use unit cost quantity input . Institutional cost estimate via accounting record . Costs know incurred program reflect accounting record ( e.g . staff whose salary different budget , storage space plan original budget , etc . ) estimate identify cost discussion staff document review . This data supplement cost calculate via ingredient approach . Key informant interview hold key implementing staff estimate time allocation project activity , order perform activity base cost analysis . Coverage assessment : Coverage Assessments implement two area start study , six month study begin end study . SQUEAC methodology use . Coverage assessment particular interest order access population access treatment understand barrier access . These assessment carry trained ACF staff . MAIN STUDY OUTCOMES : The key indicator capture : 1 . Effectiveness - recovery rate ( proportion cure child among SAM enrol ) , supplement compliance rate , defaulter rate , relapse rate , Length stay , average weight gain , hospital admission , complication 2 . Coverage rate barrier access ( estimate use SQUEAC methodology ) 3 . Health &amp; Nutrition status child ( prevalence malnutrition etc . ) 4 . Cost-effectiveness 5 . Descriptive analysis ass distribution various factor within group , cluster-adjusted analysis compare SAM rate ( recovery , survival , relapse , default ) observe different arm . Kaplan Meier statistic use comparison post-treatment survival . SAMPLE SIZE &amp; RANDOMIZATION : Investigators calculate sample size basis SAM primary indicator ; Investigators take 6 % prevalence calculate sample size expect reduction 20 % . A sample size 3 cluster per group 150 individual per cluster achieve 98 % power detect difference 0.200 group mean standard deviation 0.500 intracluster correlation 0.00100 use Two-Sided T-test significance level 0.05000 . Definition cluster : A union council define CLUSTER trial , union council smallest administrative unit district usually population 25000 30000 , population 2500-3000 five child , Investigators consider national rate SAM Pakistan 6 % Investigators find 150 case SAM union council study period enough sample achieve objectives trial . One union council usually one health facility Basic health Unit ( BHU ) Rural Health Center . STUDY SITE : The study carry Dadu district , rural district Sindh province Pakistan . This district select due high global acute malnutrition ( GAM ) rate , affected emergency . Currently Sindh , SAM treatment deliver health facility level . BENEFICIARIES : Main target beneficiary would child 6- 59 month age fulfil case definition severe malnutrition mother . DELIVERY OF INTERVENTION : Intervention Arm ( A ) : Lady Health Workers operate field level study arm A trained start study . The training package deliver LHWs involve study regardless previous train training deliver Department Health ( officially agree ) , ACF &amp; AKU . All eligible child LHWÂ´s catchment area identify register LHWs part routine activity . In Pakistan national guideline , SAM treatment admission criterion MUAC &lt; 11.5 cm . Children 6- 59 month , MUAC le 11.5 cm meeting eligibility criterion enrol obtain consent provide treatment SAM home IYCF counsel follow till recovery . Children 60-59 month criterion stabilization care also refer LHW . The LHW visit fortnightly follow recruited child SAM receive RUTF catchment population . If child get severely ill complication LHW immediately refer child near health facility hospital base care . The LHW record MUAC measurement fortnightly follow visit weight height record data collector . Control Arm ( B ) : Lady Health Workers operate field level study arm B perform monthly home visit recruit register eligible child catchment area part routine activity . The LHW identify case SAM per national CMAM guideline MUAC measurement refer near health facility ACF staff provide treatment facility per standard CMAM guideline . DATA COLLECTION : Data collect independent team , LHWs . Data collection team consist 2 data collector team leader . Data collector team leader hire trained collect data study team.The team visit identify household data cross validate LHW activity . The study team collect information regard child SAM baseline survey study LHWs health facility staff . A trained community health worker visit household child SAM take inform consent recruit child study . Baseline Cross Sectional Survey : A cross sectional survey conduct household level arm Fortnightly follow-up visit : A fortnightly follow child carry community health worker recovery child may take 3-6 month first 3 month study , purpose follow collect information regarding , acceptability , compliance , concurrent morbidity record anthropometry ( weight &amp; MUAC ) . Monthly follow-up visit : Monthly follow ups do data collector capture information recovery , feed practice , child 's nutritional status morbidity &amp; mortality . These follow ups continue 6 month time recruitment . Complete anthropometry ( MUAC , Height Weight ) carry monthly follow ups . Household cost survey : Towards end intervention , household survey implement random sample program beneficiary study area collect information direct indirect cost incur participate program . This include information cost transportation , food medicine purchase , time spend access care .</detailed_description>
