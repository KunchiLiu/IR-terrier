	<brief_summary>A dose-ranging study test various dos Dexamethasone ( 2 , 4 &amp; 8 mg ) use adjuvant Local anesthetic drug ultrasound guide low volume Supraclavicular brachial plexus block find best balance valuable effect ( mainly duration analgesic Effect ) side-effects ( mainly increase random blood sugar level )</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Brachial plexus nerve block ( BPBs ) upper extremity surgery provide superior analgesia reduce opioid consumption . Supraclavicular block anesthetize brachial plexus compact form , thus provide complete reliable block upper extremity surgery . Ultrasound guide single injection ( SI ) triple injection ( TI ) techniques find provide degree surgical anesthesia 30 minute TI technique need time perform . Many study conduct examine effect perineural Dexamethasone local anesthetic adjuvant low volume peripheral nerve block find increase mean duration analgesia ( sensory block ) short , medium long act local anesthetic well duration motor blockade , reduction pain score rest intermediate ( 8-12 h ) late ( 24 h ) postoperative period movement time . At 24 postoperative hour , cumulative morphine consumption rate nausea vomit also reduce without report related serious adverse effect , also value concomitant intravenous use prolong duration analgesia regional block study promising result sometimes compare perineural route short-lived associated high increase blood glucose level . Dexamethasone 's mechanism action may result decreased nociceptive C-fibre activity via direct effect glucocorticoid receptor inhibitory effect potassium channel . ( 8 ) Other author suggest local vasoconstrictive effect , result reduced local anaesthetic absorption systemic anti-inflammatory effect follow vascular uptake drug . A debate exist whether perineural corticosteroid harmful , report neurotoxicity seem relate mainly preservative benzyl alcohol vehicle polyethylene glycol find preparation , also may relate presence insoluble steroid particulate matter injectate . Dexamethasone non-particulate find preservative-free formulation . In addition , significant long-term electrophysiological , behavioural histological effect corticosteroid identify rat sciatic nerve tissue even data suggest dexamethasone may actually neuroprotective . In reality , perineural corticosteroid injection without preservative widely use throughout world . Various dos Dexamethasone use local anaesthetic mixture regional block various study , include 4 , 5 , 8 10 mg . In recent review &amp; meta-analysis E. Albrecht colleague , sub-group analysis reveal association total dose perineural Dexamethasone mean increase duration analgesia show Dose-finding study need well define optimal balance dose , effect side-effects , particularly dose low 4 mg .</detailed_description>
