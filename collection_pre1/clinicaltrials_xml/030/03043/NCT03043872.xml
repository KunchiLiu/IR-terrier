	<brief_summary>This phase III , randomize , open-label , multicenter , global study determine efficacy safety combine durvalumab ± tremelimumab platinum base chemotherapy ( EP ) follow durvalumab ± tremelimumab maintenance therapy versus EP alone first-line treatment patient extensive-stage small-cell lung cancer .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Durvalumab+/- Tremelimumab Combination With Platinum Based Chemotherapy Untreated Extensive-Stage Small Cell Lung Cancer ( Caspian )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Primary objective study ass efficacy durvalumab + tremelimumab + EP treatment compare EP term overall survival progression-free survival . Appr . 795 patient randomize 1:1:1 ratio stratify manner accord plan platinum-based therapy Cycle 1 ( cisplatin carboplatin ) receive treatment durvalumab + tremelimumab + EP ( Arm 1 ) , durvalumab + EP ( Arm 2 ) , standard care- EP ( Arm 3 ) . Arm 1 Arm 2 patient receive treatment confirm disease progression Arm 3 patient receive 6 cycle EP prophylactic cranial irradiation clinically indicate , Investigators ' discretion.Patients discontinue treatment due toxicity symptomatic deterioration , clinical progression , commence subsequent anticancer therapy follow confirmed disease progression survival . Targeted population adult patient ( age ≥18 year ) histologically cytologically document extensive disease ( American Joint Committee Cancer Stage ( 7th edition ) IV SCLC [ T , N , M1 a/b ] ) , T3-4 due multiple lung nodule extensive tumor/nodal volume large encompass tolerable radiation plan . Patients must WHO/ECOG performance status 0 1 . Tumor assessment perform Screening baseline follow-up Week 6 ±1 week date randomization , Week 12 ±1 week date randomization , every 8 week ±1 week confirm objective disease progression . An independent data monitoring committee ( IDMC ) comprise independent expert convene confirm safety tolerability propose dose schedule durvalumab +/- tremelimumab combination platinum base chemotherapy two early stage enrolment .</detailed_description>
