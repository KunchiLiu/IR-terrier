	<brief_title>A Study Investigate Safety , Tolerability , Pharmacokinetics VS 105</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This first human , 3 part , single multiple ascend dose study healthy subject subject end stage renal disease ( ESRD ) require hemodialysis ( HD ) . A Safety Monitoring Committee ( SMC ) evaluate safety data dose cohort proceed subsequent cohort . The SMC also review data Part study proceed next scheduled Part . In Part 1 , single ascending dos ( SAD ) VS 105 administer approximately 5 dose cohort 8 healthy subject . In Part 2 , multiple ascending dos ( MAD ) VS 105 administer approximately 3 dose cohort 8 healthy subject . VS 105 dos MAD cohort Part 2 determine SMC base result Part 1 . In Part 3 , MAD VS 105 administer approximately 3 successive dose cohort include 4 subject ESRD require HD . VS 105 dos use Part 3 select SMC base review safety and/or pharmacokinetic ( PK ) result Part 1 Part 2 . Parts 1 &amp; 2 study ass safety , tolerability , PK ascend dos VS 105 determine dose range safe well tolerate healthy subject . Part 3 study ass safety , tolerability , PK various dos VS 105 subject ESRD require HD ( ie , HD subject ) , represent target population secondary hyperparathyroidism ( SHPT ) .</detailed_description>
