	<brief_title>Using Step Count Enhance Daily Physical Activity Pulmonary Hypertension</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Pulmonary hypertension ( PH ) rare progressive disorder shortness breath fatigue , especially exercise , common symptom , result reduce capacity perform daily activity impair quality life . Furthermore , reduce exercise capacity PH associate depression anxiety disorder . Recent literature reveal strong association sedentary time adverse cardiovascular outcome , development therapeutic strategy avoid event pivotal management PH , addition beneficial result modern medical treatment . Recently role exercise rehabilitation different respiratory cardiac condition evaluate literature , overtake concern raise past exercise could worsen condition thus progression kind disease , study do patient affect PH . International guideline pulmonary hypertension recommend avoid strenuous exercise lead distress symptom , encourage low level grade aerobic exercise , walking , tolerate . Nonetheless , little still know effect lifestyle change , amount physical activity patient practice . Pedometers use enhance daily physical activity improve , assess , prognosis relate outcome , healthy subject affect different pathological condition , particular cardiac respiratory disease . However , train model base step count target never evaluate PH , knowledge . Step count device recently experience surge popularity tool motivate monitoring physical activity general population , especially combine application smartphones , provide feedback , overview data record . Thus , seem reasonable explore opportunity develop step count base train model enhance daily exercise PH patient , non-invasive , patient friendly relatively inexpensive device .</detailed_description>
