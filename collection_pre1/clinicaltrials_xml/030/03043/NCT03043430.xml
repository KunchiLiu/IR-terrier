	<brief_title>Intranasal Ketamine Anxiolysis Pediatric Emergency Department Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The intranasal route drug delivery commonly use Emergency Departments ( ED ) pediatric patient . Multiple trial show safety administration intranasal ketamine , include study perform ED treat pain pediatric patient . The use ketamine anxiolysis directly study ; however , ketamine show anxiolytic effect low dos secondary outcome study . Midazolam establish effective medication provide analgesia anxiolysis . Investigators plan conduct randomize , double-blinded , control study Emergency Department . Pediatric patient present ED need minor procedure meet inclusion exclusion criterion consent , amenable , enrolled . Patients randomize one two arm intranasal treatment : ketamine 1.0 mg/kg ( K ) midazolam 0.3 mg/kg ( M ) . Patients track symptom improvement within Emergency Department . The primary outcome change anxiety initial measurement measurement 5 minute pre-procedure use Modified Yale Preoperative Anxiety Scale ( mYPAS ) .
