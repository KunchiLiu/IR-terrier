	<brief_summary>The purpose study confirm optimal dose potential toxicity oncolytic poliovirus ( PV ) immunotherapy PVSRIPO pediatric patient recurrent WHO grade III IV malignant glioma , evidence efficacy also seek . The primary objective confirm safety optimal dose PVSRIPO deliver intracerebrally convection-enhanced delivery ( CED ) child recurrent WHO Grade III malignant glioma ( anaplastic astrocytoma , anaplastic oligoastrocytoma , anaplastic oligodendroglioma , anaplastic pleomorphic xanthoastrocytoma ) WHO Grade IV malignant glioma ( glioblastoma , gliosarcoma ) . A secondary objective estimate overall survival ( OS ) population .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Phase 1b Study PVSRIPO Recurrent Malignant Glioma Children</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PVSRIPO deliver intratumorally CED use intracerebral catheter place within enhance portion tumor . The population group patient recurrent WHO grade III IV malignant glioma age 12 17 . After single dose PVSRIPO , subject return periodic visit monitor tumor status , adverse event , change blood immune profile . A maximum 12 pediatric patient treat PVSRIPO , carefully monitor safety least year treatment .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Patients must recurrent supratentorial WHO Grade III malignant glioma ( anaplastic astrocytoma , anaplastic oligoastrocytoma , anaplastic oligodendroglioma , anaplastic pleomorphic xanthoastrocytoma ) WHO Grade IV malignant glioma ( glioblastoma , gliosarcoma ) base image study measurable disease ( ≥ 1 cm ≤ 5.5 cm contrastenhancing tumor ) . The prior histopathology must consistent World Health Organization ( WHO ) Grade III IV malignant glioma confirm study pathologist , Roger McLendon , designee . There standard care treatment child Grade III/IV glioma . Patients must complete firstline treatment include surgical procedure minimum 54 Gray radiation prior participate trial . Due potential implication treatment develop CNS , patient must ≥ 12 year age &lt; 18 year age time entry study . The patient must Lansky Karnofsky Performance Score ( KPS ) ≥ 70 % time entry . Laboratory Studies : Platelet count ≥ 125,000 per microliter prior biopsy ( unsupported ) . Platelets ≥ 100,000 per microliter prior infusion ( unsupported ) ; Prothrombin Partial Thromboplastin Times ≤ 1.2 x upper limit normal ( ULN ) prior biopsy ; Positive serum antipoliovirus titer ≥ 1:8 prior biopsy ; Creatinine ≤ 1.2 x ULN prior biopsy ; Total bilirubin , SGOT , SGPT , alkaline phosphatase ≤ 2.5 x ULN prior biopsy ; Neutrophil count ≥ 1000 per microliter prior biopsy ( unsupported ) ; Hemoglobin ≥ 9 gm/dl prior biopsy ( transfuse ) . The patient must receive boost immunization trivalent inactivate IPOL™ ( SanofiPasteur ) ≥ 1 week prior administration study agent . At time biopsy , prior administration virus , presence recurrent tumor must confirm histopathological analysis . A sign informed consent form approve Duke University Institutional Review Board ( IRB ) require patient enrollment study . Parents must able read understand inform consent document must sign informed consent indicate aware investigational nature study . All child provide assent study . Able undergo brain MRI without contrast without require general anesthesia . Pregnant breastfeeding . Patients impend , lifethreatening cerebral herniation syndrome , base assessment study neurosurgeon . Patients active infection require treatment unexplained febrile illness ( Tmax &gt; 99.5°F ) . Patients know immunosuppressive disease know human immunodeficiency virus infection . Patients unstable severe intercurrent medical condition severe heart ( New York Heart Association Class 3 4 ) lung ( FEV1 &lt; 50 % ) disease , uncontrolled diabetes mellitus . Patients albumin allergy . Gadolinium allergy . A history neurological complication due past PV infection would imply previous virus replication CNS . Based animal study , previous exposure poliovirus administer intracerebrally reduce subsequent virus replication CNS . Patients recover toxic effect prior chemo and/or radiation therapy . Guidelines recovery period dependent upon specific therapeutic agent use : Patients le 12 week radiation therapy , unless progressive disease outside radiation field 2 consecutive scan disease progression histopathologic confirmation recurrent tumor . Patients receive chemotherapy bevacizumab ≤ 4 week [ except nitrosourea ( 6 week ) metronomic dosed chemotherapy daily etoposide cyclophosphamide ( 1 week ) ] prior start study drug unless patient recovered side effect therapy . Patients receive immunotherapy ≤ 4 week prior start study drug unless patient recovered side effect therapy . Patients neoplastic lesion brainstem , cerebellum , spinal cord , tumor extend cross corpus callosum , intraventricular tumor , pineal tumor , pituitary tumor , radiological evidence active ( grow ) multifocal disease , leptomeningeal disease , location discretion treat neurosurgeon . Patients diagnosis agammaglobulinemia , : Undetectable antitetanus toxoid IgG Known history agammaglobulinemia Patients dexamethasone receive &gt; 4 mg/day two week prior admission intracerebral delivery PVSRIPO . Patients worsen steroid myopathy ( history gradual progression bilateral proximal muscle weakness , atrophy proximal muscle group ) . Patients prior , unrelated malignancy require current active treatment exception cervical carcinoma situ adequately treat basal cell squamous cell carcinoma skin .</criteria>
