	<brief_title>Taste And Smell TEsting End Stage Renal Disease</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>People advance chronic kidney disease ( CKD ) risk malnutrition , associate significantly increase mortality . Impairments olfaction taste under-recognized under-addressed symptom affect population . Olfaction taste influence appetite nutritional status represent unique target study intervention . Small cross-sectional study show high prevalence olfactory ( 56 % ) taste disturbance ( 35 % ) among patient CKD compare general population , little known longitudinal change olfaction taste population . Additionally , lack understanding sensory disturbance commonly occur people CKD , although speculation uremia may contribute . This information gain study address gap knowledge study longitudinal change olfaction taste association concurrent future nutritional functional status . Additionally study attempt identify potentially modifiable risk factor associate olfactory taste impairment .</detailed_description>
