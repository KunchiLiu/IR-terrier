	<brief_summary>This research study examine ethnic/racial background , body composition ( % body fat ) , location body fat affect ability hormone insulin promote uptake blood sugar person 19 45 year age . When insulin ineffective promoting blood sugar uptake , condition term `` insulin resistance . '' Insulin resistance play major role development chronic metabolic disease ( type 2 diabetes , cardiovascular disease , cancer ) , many differ race . Previous study suggest insulin resistance high African-Americans ( AA ) vs. European-Americans ( EA ) . However , result study remain unclear due different test measure use insulin resistance well differences body fat individual . Results research study may help explain insulin resistance differs genetic background may guide development personalize treatment strategy implication several chronic metabolic disease ( e.g. , type 2 diabetes , cardiovascular disease , cancer ) .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Insulin resistance play major role etiology chronic metabolic disease , many differ race/ethnicity . Previous study use mainly indirect method suggest insulin sensitivity lower AA vs. EA . Our preliminary data use reference standard glucose clamp indicate lean individual , insulin sensitivity lower among AA , obese individual , insulin sensitivity high among AA . We hypothesize race/body mass index ( BMI ) interaction may explain part significantly low visceral hepatic fat accumulation AA . Conversely , base preliminary data , hypothesize inherently great oxidative stress impairs insulin sensitivity even AA , explain low insulin sensitivity lean AA vs. EA . We propose test hypothesis prospectively compare skeletal muscle hepatic insulin sensitivity healthy lean , overweight , obese AA EA use hyperinsulinemic isoglycemic glucose clamp . Analysis ancestral gene permit simultaneous assessment contribution ancestry main outcome .</detailed_description>
