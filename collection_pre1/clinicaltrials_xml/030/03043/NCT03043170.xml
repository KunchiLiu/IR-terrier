	<brief_summary>Background research Patients present Emergency Departments ( ED ) spectrum illness , many life- threatening .

What hope discover We expect discover : - Uscom variable predict 7-day survival ICU admission - Uscom variable improve detection classification shock - The LiPS definition improve . - The objective definition well doctor experience - Patients good experience satisfy care</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Diagnostic Investigation Prediction Shock</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Patients frequently present emergency department ( EDs ) critical illness injury . Shock life-threatening emergency , require urgent rapid assessment , diagnosis treatment , classify distributive-septic ( 62 % ) , distributive-non-septic ( 4 % ) , hypovolaemic ( 16 % ) , cardiogenic ( 16 % ) obstructive ( 2 % ) . Sepsis lead cause in-hospital death , approximately 80 % patient admit ED . In Chinese patient present ED Hong Kong previously derive validated simple , priori , pragmatic , quantitative method recognise classify shock - Li 's Practical Shock ( LiPS ) tool . This method validate ICU admission early mortality . However , derive single population single centre , require validation refine setting . Further , sub-classify patient beyond 'normal , cold warm shock ' , guide next step treatment , assessment periphery subjective . Evaluating true underlying patient haemodynamics cardiac output , cardiac power peripheral pressure give vital clue hide seriousness illness guide good management . Few EDs world ass haemodynamics . After evaluate haemodynamic protocol one centre Australia able reduce death rate septic shock 30 day 38 % 7 % . We would like evaluate whether would occur apply across EDs Wales . However , need strengthen understand haemodynamics , relevant protocol non-invasive device help u acquire information . There many unanswered question : - Do Uscom-derived haemodynamic variable measure ED predict patient high risk death , admission ICU , shock ? - Does refine LiPS definition well predict mortality ICU admission ? - Do advanced haemodynamic predictor and/or refine LiPS predict well experience physician presence classification patient shock , mortality ICU admission ? This study answer two main question : 1 . What probability patient shock ? 2 . What type shock patient ? We propose : 1 . To investigate whether advanced haemodynamic variable use USCOM predict 7-day mortality ICU admission . 2 . To investigate whether advanced haemodynamic variable use USCOM improve detection classification shock . 3 . To validate refine Li 's priori Pragmatic Shock ( LiPS ) method detect classify shock . 4 . To evaluate clinical experience shock . 5 . To inform feasibility future study After ethic institutional approval obtain conduct prospective , single-centre , cohort study 354 adult patient possible shock associate acute illness injury present Emergency Department University Hospital Wales , follow 7 day . 354 credible number confirm strategy work . Written consent obtain either patient relative wherever possible waiver consent apply patient , confusion , unconsciousness severe disability , may unable give consent . In case , consent first seek second doctor and/or nurse . Thereafter , consent obtain patient relative soon practically possible . The challenge discover strategy sensitivity &gt; 67 % specificity &gt; 72 % determine in-hospital mortality clinically deteriorate potentially shocked patient .</detailed_description>
