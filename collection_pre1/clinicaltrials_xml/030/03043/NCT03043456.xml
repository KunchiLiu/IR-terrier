	<detailed_description>The restoration masticatory function aesthetic important aim dentistry mainly patient present extensive tooth loss . The loss tooth elderly patient impair stomatognathic system also psychological status quality life.so important criterion 's success dentures patient 's expectation ability denture replace lose masticatory efficiency . The acrylic resin first used 1936 ; time best alternative vulcanized rubber . Where characterized superior characteristic become popular material use since . Nonetheless , problem polymerization shrinkage , weak flexural , low impact strength , low fatigue resistance . These often lead denture failure chew fall patient 's hand . In order enhance property PMMA , various effort take include addition metal wire plat , fiber , metal insert , modification chemical structure . In recent year , nylon polymer attract attention denture base material . Thermoplastic nylon like material polyamide introduce first use dentistry 1950 . The polyamide uniquely characterize high esthetic especially removable partial denture , retentive component recommend anteriorly material provide high elasticity make retentive component use material eliminate metallic clasp . Polyamides characterize low weight flexibility make patient satisfactory fortunately monomer remnant may affect patient health cause allergy . Thermoplastic polyamides almost porosity eliminate water sorption . The technique use fabrication injection mold technique dimension accurate pack mold technique . Valplast initially use 50 year ago use modern dentistry since mid-fifties . A variation nylon , far flexible strong poly methyl methacrylate resin , use many alternative partial denture . Valplast flexible denture use full set dentures especially case acrylic allergy represent 20 % population . Comparative Evaluation Impact Flexural Strength do four type Four Commercially Available Flexible Denture Base Materials . Valplast maximum impact strength , material use less undercut area long-term interim removable partial denture . A study do investigator evaluate surface roughness four thermoplastic ( polyamide : Valplast , Lucitone FRS , polyethylene terephthalate : EstheShot , polyester : EstheShot Bright ) two conventional acrylic ( Heat-polymerizing : Urban , Pour type auto-polymerizing : Pro-Cast DSP ) denture base use scratch test . The result show surface thermoplastic denture base resins easily damage compare polymethyl methacrylate cause discomfort patient also discoloration . Complete Dentures Made High Impact Flexible Resins evaluate . There statistically significant difference masticatory performance wet dry weight value hard food , statistically significant difference masticatory performance wet dry weight value soft food conventional flexible denture . Though masticatory efficiency performance find well patient 's denture make Polymethyl methacrylate ( PMMA ) , statistically significant number patient report flexible denture satisfy conventional denture . Another study do evaluate patient inflamatory response . patient receive acrylic complete denture associate significant high level proinflammatory salivary cytokine ( TNF-α IL-6 ) comparison correspond level thermoplastic polyamide complete denture patient . The high level pro-inflammatory salivary cytokine ( TNF-α IL-6 ) find saliva control group patient may link protective effect tissue inflammation cause release residual monomer . Adherence Candida albicans Flexible Denture Base Material study conclude C. albicans lesser opportunity adhere flexible denture acrylic resin denture base material .</detailed_description>
