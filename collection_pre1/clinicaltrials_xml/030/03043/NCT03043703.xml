	<brief_summary>Detecting mild form obstructive sleep apnea ( OSA ) easily efficiently might help identify improve care patient suffer wake reaction night . The AirSense 10 Her able detect respiratory effort relate arousal ( RERAs ) change flow air . The algorithm AirSense 10 compare score via polysomnography ( PSG ) . 129 patient shall observe sleep facility suboptimal Treatment ( i.e . low pressure ) positive airway pressure ( PAP ) therapy .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Sleep disorder breathe commonly assess calculate Apnea-Hypopnea-Index AHI Hypopnea-Index HI define frequent breathe breathe effort stop night . The severity sleep apnea ( SA ) determine number occur apneas hypopnea . Research sleep apnea woman - expand gender - show many patient suffer SA often detectable apnea hypopneas airway collapse partially , lead reduction airflow match criterion hypopnea , result wake reaction high effort breathe ( respiratory effort relate arousal ( RERA ) ) . Such milder form SA negative consequence severe SA daytime alertness , mood life ` quality might affect blood pressure cardiovascular system . Polysomnography ( PSG ) - connection measure esophageal pressure - use sleep laboratory Gold standard method document patient ` sleep behavior track air flow , respiratory effort , blood oxygen electrocardiac well electromyographic signal . This way comprehensive sleep pattern analysis create different form SA detect . However , method laborious cost-intensive , could save time cost event accurately score device , ensure quick reliable diagnosis also hard-to-detect mild SA . RERA event detect accurately via reduction air flow change flow pattern . The respiratory disturbance index ( RDI ) capture event calculate comprise AHI also RERAs via flow signal .</detailed_description>
