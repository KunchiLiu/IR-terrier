	<brief_summary>Background : Fish oil know beneficial health believe cardio-protective . Omega-3 fatty acid know fish oil available market . LCMUFA ( long-chain monounsaturated fatty acid ) also fish oil derive fish consumes diet rich omega-11 fatty acid . Researchers want study omega-11 fatty acid enrich fish oil understand effect cardiovascular health . Objective : To understand effect LCMUFA fish oil cardiovascular health . Eligibility : Healthy volunteer age 18 old history cardiovascular disease Design : Participants screen : Medical history Physical exam Fasting blood urine test Optional stool sample Questions diet , exercise , type medicine dietary supplement take 7-day food diary Cardio-Ankle Vascular Index ( CAVI ) : Blood pressure take arm legs . The heart monitor . After screen visit , participant take 4 gel capsule , 3 time day meal , 8 10 week . Participants 3 additional visit . All include repeat screen test . Visit 2 8 week screen visit . Participants stop take capsule 8 week visit . Visit 3 least 16 week start supplement . Participants take 4 capsule , 3 time day meal , 8 week visit . Visit 4 8 week start second supplement .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Effect Fish Oil Enriched In Omega-11 Fatty Acid On Lipoprotein Metabolism In Adults</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Serum cholesterol transport lipoprotein , VLDL , LDL HDL , vary relationship cardiovascular disease risk . LDL , example , proatherogenic , whereas HDL cardio-protective . Long-chain monounsaturated fatty acid ( LCMUFA ) , fatty acid 18 carbon length single double bound , show mouse decrease proatherogenic lipoprotein , LDL , reduce atherosclerosis . This study test hypothesis LCMUFA supplementation human favorably alter lipoprotein lipid profile regard cardiovascular disease risk . In addition , ass parameter related lipoprotein composition function , well biomarkers related coagulation inflammation , previously show affected supplementation omega-3 fatty acid . This clinical research project design pilot , randomize , double-blinded , crossover study investigate effect fish oil enrich LCMUFA lipoprotein metabolism . Subjects receive control fish oil enrich oleic acid , monounsaturated fatty acid ( C18:1 ) , fish oil supplement produce Saury fish ( rich LCMUFA ) approximately 8-10 week , wash period 8-10 week two arm study . The study consist 4 outpatient visit laboratory research sample CAVI test perform . A 7-day food diary , pill count , red cell membrane fatty acid level monitor assess compliance .</detailed_description>
