	<detailed_description>Airway obstruction , airflow resistance partial occlusion airways central sleep-breathing disorder , respiratory effort reduce stop , cause reduction airflow lead arousal sleep disturbance gas exchange sleep . The negative consequence manifest increase blood pressure , high workload heart daytime sleepiness . PAP ( positive airway pressure ) treat sleep-related breathing disorder . It apply pressure nose mouth keep airway collapse provide pressure support assist respiratory muscle . The efficacy therapy measure apnoea- hypopnoea-indices count total number apnoeic event night . To ensure efficacious efficient therapy , pressure adjust correctly patient need use PAP regularly . Telemonitoring information communication technology exchange sleep data provide clinical guidance distance . There defined spectrum technology . It comprise phone call , video support interaction program via internet . Some study point advantage telemonitoring keep compliance upright , increase usage hour also point economic advantage . However , conclusive data large trial telemonitoring long-term would show conclusive effect , side patient cost labour perspective provider healthcare sector . Still , uncertainty regard data safety , reimbursement connectivity different system . No long-term data PAP therapy telemonitoring effect compliance therapy outcomes available .</detailed_description>
