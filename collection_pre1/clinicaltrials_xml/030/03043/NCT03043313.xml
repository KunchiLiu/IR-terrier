	<criteria>Histologically and/or cytologically confirm radiographically measurable adenocarcinoma colon rectum metastatic and/or unresectable . Subjects must treat fluoropyrimidine ( e.g. , 5fluorouracil capecitabine ) , oxaliplatin , irinotecan , antiVEGF monoclonal antibody ( bevacizumab , ramucirumab , zivaflibercept ) , contraindication treatment . Molecular test result CLIAcertified laboratory confirm tumor tissue least one following : HER2 overexpression ( 3+ IHC ) . Note : HER2 2+ IHC eligible tumor amplify FISH . HER2 amplification situ hybridization assay ( FISH CISH signal ratio &gt; 2.0 gene copy number &gt; 6 ) . HER2 amplification CLIAcertified Next Generation Sequencing ( NGS ) sequence assay . RAS ( KRAS NRAS ) wildtype primary metastatic tumor tissue . At least one site disease measurable RECIST criterion define Section 11.0 previously irradiate ; patient previous radiation target lesion ( ) , must evidence progression since radiation . ECOG Performance Status ( PS ) 0 , 1 , 2 . ( Form available ACCRU web site http : //www.accru.org/accru/forms/NonProtocolSpecificForms/index.html ) Life expectancy great 3 month . Absolute neutrophil count ( ANC ) ≥1000/mm3 Platelet count ≥75,000/mm3 Hemoglobin &gt; 8.0 g/dL Total bilirubin ≤1.5 x upper limit normal ( ULN ) AST/ALT ≤ 2.5 X upper limit normal ( ULN ) ( ≤5 ULN liver metastasis present ) Calculated creatinine clearance must ≥50 ml/min use CockcroftGault formula International normalized ratio ( INR ) activate partial thromboplastin time ( aPTT ) ≤1.5 X ULN unless medication know alter INR and/or aPTT . Left ventricular ejection fraction ( LVEF ) ≥50 % assess echocardiogram ( ECHO ) multiplegated acquisition scan ( MUGA ) document within 4 week prior first dose study treatment Sexually active subject ( men woman ) must agree use medically accept barrier method contraception ( e.g. , male female condom ) course study 1 month last dose study drug ( ) , even oral contraceptive also use . Negative pregnancy test do ≤7 day prior registration woman childbearing potential . Women childbearing potential include woman experience menarche undergone successful surgical sterilization ( hysterectomy , bilateral tubal ligation , bilateral oophorectomy ) postmenopausal . Postmenopause define amenorrhea ≥12 consecutive month . Note : woman amenorrheic 12 month still consider childbearing potential amenorrhea possibly due prior chemotherapy , antiestrogens , ovarian suppression reversible treatment . Capable understand comply protocol requirement sign informed consent document . Willing return enrol institution followup ( Active Monitoring Phase study ) . Willing provide mandatory tissue and/or blood sample correlative research purpose . Radiation therapy , hormonal therapy , biologic therapy , experimental therapy , chemotherapy cancer ≤21 day prior registration . Prior antiHER2 target therapy . Uncontrolled intercurrent illness include , limited , ongoing active infection , symptomatic congestive heart failure , unstable angina pectoris , cardiac arrhythmia , psychiatric illness/social situation would limit compliance study requirement . Not recovered baseline CTCAE ≤ Grade 1 toxicity due prior therapy except alopecia neuropathy , must resolve ≤ Grade 2 ; congestive heart failure ( CHF ) , must ≤ Grade 1 severity time occurrence , must resolve completely . Clinically significant cardiac disease history ventricular arrhythmia require therapy , currently uncontrolled hypertension ( defined persistent systolic blood pressure &gt; 150 mm Hg and/or diastolic blood pressure &gt; 100 mm Hg antihypertensive medication ) , history symptomatic CHF . Any follow study involve investigational agent whose genotoxic , mutagenic teratogenic effect develop fetus newborn unknown : Pregnant woman Nursing woman Men woman childbearing potential unwilling employ adequate contraception Patient know CNS metastasis ( radiate resect lesion permit , provide lesion fully treat inactive , patient asymptomatic , steroid administer least 30 day ) Inability swallow pill significant gastrointestinal disease would preclude adequate oral absorption medication Use strong CYP3A4 inducer inhibitor , strong CYP2C8 inducer inhibitor within 3 elimination halflives inhibitor inducer prior first dose study treatment Major surgical procedure , open biopsy , significant traumatic injury ≤28 day prior study enrollment ( 56 day hepatectomy , open thoracotomy , major neurosurgery ) anticipation need major surgical procedure course study . Serious , nonhealing wound , ulcer , bone fracture History myocardial infarction , unstable angina , cardiac vascular stenting , angioplasty , cardiac surgery ≤6 month prior study enrollment Immunocompromised patient patient know HIV positive currently receive antiretroviral therapy . NOTE : Patients know HIV positive , without clinical evidence immunocompromised state , eligible trial . Acute chronic active hepatitis B C infection , serious chronic infection require ongoing treatment Known chronic liver disease , autoimmune hepatitis , sclerosing cholangitis Receiving investigational agent would consider treatment primary neoplasm Other active malignancy ≤2 year prior registration require systemic treatment . EXCEPTIONS : Nonmelanotic skin cancer carcinomainsitu cervix . Comorbid systemic illness severe concurrent disease , judgment investigator , would make patient inappropriate entry study interfere significantly proper assessment safety toxicity prescribe regimens Unable unwilling abide study protocol cooperate fully investigator designee .</criteria>
