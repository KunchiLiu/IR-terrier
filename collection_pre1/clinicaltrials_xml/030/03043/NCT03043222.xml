	<brief_title>Innovative Minimally Invasive Options Treatment Urinary Problems Related Prostate Enlargement ( BPH ) Men</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>As population age , grow need find way people live long satisfactory quality life ( QoL ) , even midst increase health problem . For age man , Health relate quality life ( HRQoL ) challenge two common issue : onset bothersome LUTS attributable benign prostatic hypertrophy ( BPH ) diminish ability maintain normal sexual activity function ; issue important men , yet often treatment former adverse effect latter . Current medical surgical treatment like TURP BPH offer symptomatic improvement LUTS may adversely affect patient 's QOL satisfaction . Peri-operative complication long recovery time , degradation sexual function iatrogenic incontinence may negatively affect patient 's QoL overall , result patient view treatment failure . Therefore evaluate treatment option BPH , treatment option important QOL measure satisfaction consider . Prostatic urethral lift ( PUL ) prostate artery embolization ( PAE ) represent two evolve technique contrast mechanisms action ( mechanical decompression v angiographic embolization ) . Multiple prospective retrospective study show PUL PAE yield relief low urinary tract symptom period several week . They display similar safety profile self-limiting pelvic discomfort characterize common minor adverse event . Both procedure minimally invasive potential carry local anesthesia outpatient set suitability patient cardiovascular comorbidities . Another important finding neither find cause degradation sexual function . Although increase number data series report PUL PAE alike , currently prospective clinical trial compare two technology . We aim prospectively evaluate compare HRQol outcomes PUL PAE . All endpoint evaluate use validated questionnaire laboratory value . Results study transferable clinical practice could great impact patient outcome men opt minimally invasive , sexual function spar treatment option symptom relief LUTS due BPH practice setting .</detailed_description>
