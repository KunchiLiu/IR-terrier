Research assistant , unaware study hypothesis participant randomization status , perform research assessment baseline 6 ( cognitive measure ) , 12 , 24 , 36 ( cognitive measure ) 52 week randomization . There also optional blood draw study entry , 12 , 52 week . The purpose blood draw well understand whether response psychotherapy treatment affect gene , inflammation , possible memory factor call BDNF ( brain-derived neurotrophic factor ) . Also , therapy session audiotaped ( patient consent ) Dr. Shermer ( clinician outside Weill Cornell Institute Geriatric Psychiatry ) evaluate randomly select session rate therapist ' adherence competence base PATH-MCI ST Adherence Scales The study partner provide information treatment subject participate treatment agree treatment subject .
