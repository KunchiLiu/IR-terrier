	<brief_summary>Quantitative radiographic image hold promise novel innovative strategy assess ventral hernia patient . Assessing abdominal wall change surround ventral hernia use shear wave velocity value measure ultrasound identify feature abdominal wall differ healthy volunteer subject schedule ventral hernia repair . Through use ultrasound include shear wave velocity measurement , abdominal wall 25 subject schedule ventral hernia repair compare 35 healthy volunteer . The ultrasound measurement elucidate ventral hernia affect abdominal wall elasticity effect surgical outcome .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>ARFI-SWV Ultrasound hold promise inexpensive , noninvasive , point-of-care diagnostic tool pre-operatively predict successful hernia repair . The investigator propose develop refine quantitative ultrasound protocol measure abdominal wall feature suitable predict successful closure midline fascia . ARFI-SWV ultrasound represent novel intrigue modality real time visualization characterization change biomechanical property diseased musculoskeletal tissue . In study , ARFI-SWV ultrasound hypothesize preoperatively measure stiffness lateral abdominal wall estimation mobility hernia repair . Preoperatively evaluate hernia severity ARFI-SWV ultrasound perform identify mechanical characteristic abdominal musculature predict success midline fascial re-approximation hernia patient . The study propose compare ultrasound image associate shear wave velocity measurement 35 healthy volunteer 25 subject undergoing surgical repair ventral hernia . Subjects ventral hernia undergo image early two week prior elective hernia repair postoperatively within six month follow repair standard followup visit . Statistical analysis determine significant difference abdominal wall stiffness , represent ultrasound shear wave velocity measurement , healthy subject subject ventral hernia . Further analysis determine statistically significant relationship abdominal wall stiffness subject ventral hernia surgical outcome .</detailed_description>
