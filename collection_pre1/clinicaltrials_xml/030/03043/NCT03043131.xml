	<detailed_description>REVIEW OF LITERATURE The ideal prime Cardiopulmonary Bypass ( CPB ) never fully establish . The development acid-base disorder routine case possible contribution prim fluid cause hospital question protocol . Plasma Lyte-A injection , pH 7.4 , sterile , nonpyrogenic isotonic solution , intravenous administration . Each 100mL contains 368mg Sodium acetate Trihydrate , ( C2H3NaO2.3H2O ) , 502 mg Sodium gluconate ( C6H11NaO7 ) , 526 mg sodium chloride , ( NaCl ) , 30 mg Magnesium chloride ( MgCl2.6H2O ) ,37 mg Potassium chloride , ( KCl ) . It contain anti microbial agent . pH adjust sodium hydroxide . Its pH 7.4 ( 6.5 8 ) . One litre ionic concentration 27mEq acetate , 23mEq gluconate , 5mEq potassium , 140mEq sodium , 3mEq magnesium , 98mEq chloride . The osmolarity 294mOsm/ml . Normal physiological osmolarity range 280 310mOsm/lit . Administration substantially hypertonic solution may cause vein damage . The calorie content 21 k.Cal/lit . 100ml Ringer 's lactate contain 320mg sodium lactate , 600mg sodium chloride , 40mg potassium chloride , 27mg calcium chloride . It equivalent sodium 130mEq , calcium 3mEq , potassium 4mEq , bicarbonate 28mEq chloride 109mEq . Hence value source water , electrolytes calorie . Infusion fluid contain physiological buffer base bicarbonate tend produce dilutional acidosis infusion solution dilutes ( reduces ) HCO3- concentration ( buffer base ) entire extracellular compartment , partial pressure CO2 ( buffer acid ) remain constant . Dilution may isovolemic ( normovolemic ) , i.e. , HCO3- lose along blood blood extracellular fluid volume restore normal solution free HCO3- , ECFV expand bicarbonate-free solution produce hypervolemia . A decrease arterial pH 7.20 observe dog model infusion 1,500mL 0.9 % NaCl solution 5 minute , effect observe dog infused volume solution contain 30mmol/L NaHCO3 . In summary , dilutional acidosis predictable define iatrogenic disruption bring bicarbonate dilution entire extracellular space may associate hyperchloremia hypochloremia depend whether dilution produce infusion hyperchloremic hypochloremic solution . Dilutional acidosis prevent use adequate concentration metabolizable anion replace HCO3-.The follow anion organic acid , acetate ( acetic acid ) , lactate ( lactic acid ) , gluconate ( gluconicacid ) , malate hydrogen malate ( malic acid ) , citrate ( citric acid ) may use metabolizable base . Consuming H+ ion oxygen process , anion metabolize intact liver ( mainly lactate ) muscle ( mainly acetate malate ) produce HCO3- . At pH 7.40 , carbonic acid ( H2CO3 ) H+ ion source body ( supply low concentration 1.2mmol/L , H2CO3 synthesize freely CO2 + H2O ) . HCO3- therefore release equimolar amount . For every mole acetate , gluconate , lactate oxidize , one mole bicarbonate produce , every mole malate citrate oxidize , 2 3 mole bicarbonate produce , respectively . The two latter metabolizable anion would thus produce excessively high , unphysiological bicarbonate concentration . If infusion fluid contain metabolizable anion concentration exceed lack bicarbonate , infusion-induced alkalosis likely consequence , call rebound alkalosis . Metabolic alkalosis always iatrogenic . The normal plasma acetate concentration low report range 0.06 0.2mmol/L . Patients undergo acetate hemodialysis plasma acetate level high 6.5mmol/L . Acetate Metabolism Any metabolic pathway must electro-neutral balance . Acetate ( base patient infuse ) therefore oxidized form acetic acid ( take H+ ) . Two mole O2 require per mole acetic acid . The chemical equation reaction sodium acetate oxygen : CH3-COONa + 2 O2 &lt; -- -- -- &gt; CO2 + H2O + NaHCO3 Two important conclusion draw equation : 1 . For every mole acetate oxidize , one mole bicarbonate produce ; expect effect acetate HCO3- replacement alkalization . 2 . For every two mole O2 consume , one mole CO2 produce . This surprising `` side '' effect respiratory quotient ( RQ ) acetate 0.5 . Compared glucose ( dextrose ) , RQ 1.0 , mean metabolism acetate cause half inhaled O2 exhale CO2 . Compared HCO3- , acetate practically effect Lactate Metabolism CH3-CH-COONa + 3 O2 &lt; -- -- - &gt; CO2 + 2H2O + 2NaOH CO2 +H2O &lt; -- -- - &gt; H2CO3 H2CO3 + NaOH &lt; -- -- &gt; NaHCO3+H2O Summary : Na lactate +3O2 &lt; -- -- - &gt; 2CO2+2 H2O+NaHCO3 At basal metabolic rate ( BMR ) , myocardium , muscle , brain , intestinal mucosa , red blood cell produce approximately 1mmol lactate/kg/h , half eliminate liver . At BMR , gluconeogenesis account approximately 20 % oxidation approximately 80 % lactate metabolism . When lactate supply exogenously , 70 % lactate use substrate gluconeogenesis . Intrahepatic gluconeogenesis cease pH fall 7.1 , base excess ( BE ) -15mmol/L . Incipient hepatic dysfunction ( increase bilirubin SGOT ) quickly result lactate concentration high 8mmol/L , associate high mortality . Compared acetate , lactate infusion characterize relatively slow onset alkalization , therefore , call `` delay HCO3- infusion '' . Peak lactate turnover report approximately 450mmol/h . As glucose level may increase quite significantly lactate administration , come surprise intra-operatively administer Ringer 's lactate may cause glucose concentration double diabetic . Plasma lactate similarly high predictive power base excess mortality patient various form shock include cardiac , hemorrhagic , septic shock . Subsequent mortality approximately 50 % plasma lactate ( blood lactate ) exceed 4 7mmol/L first 24 48 hour shock . An initial value 3mmol/L plasma lactate concentration predict 25 % mortality cardiac , hemorrhagic , septic shock patient . Many physician apparently aware use lactate-containing infusion fluid ( Ringer 's lactate ) blood product ( pack red cell ) diagnostic use lactate marker hypoxia mutually exclusive . Lilley A et al conduct survey analyze practice CPB circuit priming . The response rate 74 % . It find two unit UK use prime . The common reason fluid choice historical belief appear little perceived association prime acidosis bypass . The result reveal consensus UK preferential prime CPB , suggest effect aspect fully understood . Liskaser FJ et al study role pump prime etiology pathogenesis CPB acidosis report fluid lactate significantly limit increase serum lactate concentration post operative period . In study compare Ringer 's solution Plasma Lyte-A . He do prospective , double blind randomize trial , conduct tertiary health care centre 22 patient , undergo CPB coronary artery bypass surgery . He conclude CPB induce metabolic acidosis appear iatrogenic nature derive effect pump prime fluid acid-base balance . The extent acidosis duration varies accord type pump prime . Hayhoe M et al conduct study conclude patient receive pump prime rich chloride polygeline , metabolic acidosis CPB mainly due iatrogenic chloride concentration unmeasured strong anions.Sampling arterial blood four time interval : post-induction , CPB cool rewarming , skin closure . Measurement serum Na+ K+ , Mg++ , Ca++ , Cl- , bicarbonate , phosphate concentration , arterial blood gas , serum albumin , lactate , pyruvate concentration collection point . Analysis finding accord quantitative physicochemical principle , include calculation strong ion difference apparent , strong ion difference effective , strong ion gap ( SIG ) . All patient develop mild metabolic acidosis . The median serum standard bicarbonate concentration decrease 25.0mEq/l post-induction 22.3mEq/l cool 22.2mEq/l rewarming ( p &lt; 0.05 ) .The standard base excess decrease median 1.55mEq/l prior CPB , ±2.50mEq/l cooling , ±1.65mEq/l rewarming , ±0.85mEq/l skin closure ( p &lt; 0.001 ) . This mild metabolic acidosis occur despite decrease median serum lactate concentration 3.20mEq/l post-induction 1.83 , 1.80 , 1.58mEq/l three time point . The increase median serum chloride concentration 104.9mEq/l post induction to111.0,111.1 , and110.0mEq/l subsequent time point ( p &lt; 0.0001 ) main cause acidosis . There also significant increase SIG 3.8mEq/l cool rewarming ( p &lt; 0.0001 ) , suggest role unmeasured anion ( polygeline ) genesis acidosis . He conclude use quantitative biophysical method , demonstrate , patient receive pump prime rich chloride polygeline , metabolic acidosis CPB mostly due iatrogenic increase serum chloride concentration unmeasured strong anion ( SIG ) . Its development partially attenuate iatrogenic hypoalbuminaemia . Changes lactate concentration play role development metabolic acidosis patient . Himpe D et al conduct study add lactate prime fluid CPB conclude exogenous lactate attenuate CPB related acidosis . He conduct study twenty patient schedule coronary surgery study prospectively . All patient treat identically , except prime , either contain lactate lactate free . Just bypass come bypass , haemoglobin , glucose , plasma osmolality colloid osmotic pressure determine ; albumin , lactate , sodium , potassium , ionized calcium , magnesium , phosphate , arterial pH , pCO2 , bicarbonate , base excess measure use Stewart 's analysis . Metabolic acidosis resolve end bypass lactate prime . Although strong ion gap ( apparent minus effective strong ion difference ) increase significantly group , composition differ significantly group . The Stewart technique detect polyanionic gelatin weak acid component contribute unidentified anion fraction . Colloid osmotic pressure maintain group . He conclude exogenous lactate attenuates acidosis relate CPB . Weinberg LD et al conduct randomize blind study 50 adult patient undergo elective Coronary Artery Bypass Graft heart valve replacement . Both group receive prime solution 2000mL ; anion lactate chloride ( Hartmann 's ) , anion acetate , gluconate chloride ( Plasma Lyte-A ) .Blood collect immediately prior CPB ( BL ) , 2-minutes ( T2 ) , 5-minutes ( T5 ) , 10-minutes ( T10 ) , 30-minutes ( T30 ) , 60-minutes ( T60 ) CPB . Patient characteristic evenly match . On delivery pump prime group develop metabolic acidosis . Plasma Lyte-A , standard BE : 0.53mmol/L ( BL ) -3.03mmol/L ( T2 ) , P &lt; 0.001 ; Hartmann 's standard BE : 0.42mmol/L ( BL ) -2.20mmol/L ( T2 ) , P &lt; 0.001 . There surge Plasma Lyte-A group 's SIG - 1.39mEq/L ( BL ) 12.13mEq/L ( T2 ) , P &lt; 0.001 , remain elevate T60 ( 6.22mEq/L ) . The SIG Hartmann 's group increase 0.43mEq/L ( BL ) 2.00mEq/L ( T2 ) . The Hartmann 's group experience significant lactate surge 2 minute ( P &lt; 0.001 ) remain elevate T60 ; hyperlactatemia Plasma Lyte-A group . There significant hyperchloraemia Hartmann 's compare Plasma Lyte-A . He conclude mechanism acidosis Hartmann 's solution due combination iatrogenic hyperlactatemia hyperchloraemia . The mechanism Plasma Lyte-A production unmeasured anion ( likely acetate gluconate ) . Metabolic acidosis treat minimized widening strong ion difference ( alkalinize effect ) , maintain high sodium concentration ( use sodium bicarbonate ) , decrease chloride use intravenous fluid low chloride concentration compare Hartmann 's solution Plasma Lyte-A . Morgan TJ et al design bicarbonate base crystalloid base circuit balance physio-chemical principle strong ion difference 24mEq/l compare acid base effect Plasma-Lyte 148 multiple electrolyte replacement solution contain acetate gluconate ( total 50mEq/l ) . Twenty patient normal acid base status undergo elective cardiac study randomize 1:1 2 litre prime either bicarbonate base fluid Plasma-Lyte 148 . With trial fluid metabolic acid base status normal follow cardiopulmonary bypass initiation ( standard base excess 0.1 ( 1.3 ) mEq/l , mean , SD ) , whereas plasma Lyte - 148 produce slight metabolic acidosis ( standard base excess 2.2 ( 2.1 ) mEq/l , mean , SD ) . Estimated group difference baseline adjustment 3.6mEq/l ( 95 % confidence interval 2.1 5.1 p=0.0001 ) . By late bypass mean standard base excess group normal ( 0.8 ( 2.2 ) mEq/l Vs -0.8 ( 1.3 ) p=0.5 ) . Strong ion gap value unaltered trial fluid , Plasma Lyte - 148 increase significantly bypass initiation . ( 15.2 ( 2.5 ) mEq/l Vs 2.5 ( 1.5 ) mEq p &lt; 0.0001 ) remain elevate late bypass . ( 8.4 ( 3.4 ) mEq/l Vs5.8 ( 2.4 ) mEq/l p &lt; 0.05 ) . They conclude bicarbonate base crystalloid strong ion difference 24mEq/l balance cardiopulmonary bypass patient normal acid base status , whereas Plasma-Lyte 148 trigger surge unmeasured anion , persist throughout bypass . These likely acetate gluconate . Alston RP et al study effect change solution back Hartmann 's metabolic acidosis develop CPB patient undergo heart surgery . He take two group patient study . The first receive Ringer 's ( n = 63 ) second Hartmann 's solution ( n = 66 ) . Arterial blood sample take induction anaesthesia towards end CPB . Samples analyze blood gas analyzer . Results : Hydrogen ion concentration increase 38 ( 4 ) 41 ( 7 ) mmol/L Ringer 's group , decrease 38 ( 5 ) 36 ( 6 ) mmol L-1 Hartmann 's group . Changes PaCO2 ( 0.77 , p &lt; 0.001 ) volume fluid administer ( r = 0.23 , p &lt; 0.01 ) significant univariate correlate change hydrogen ion concentration , haemoglobin concentration ( r &lt; 0.01 , p = 0.97 ) . Analysis variance repeat measure find significant difference subject effect change hydrogen ion concentration CPB cause choice intravascular solution use ( p &lt; 0.001 ) PaCO2 ( p = 0.001 ) , result volume solution administer ( p &gt; 0.10 ) . He conclude change solution use prim intravascular volume replacement Ringer 's Hartmann 's associate reduction metabolic acidosis develop CPB . Murray DM et al conduct study define true incidence nature acidosis paediatric patient post cardiac surgery . In study Tissue acidosis occur overall 60 150 sample . This due raise unmeasured acid alone 44 60 ( 73.3 % ) , raise lactate alone six 60 ( 10 % ) , combination two ten 60 ( 16.6 % ) . Hyperchloremia occur 19 150 sample overall 12 25 ( 48 % ) sample immediately cardiopulmonary bypass . Measured base deficit show poor correlation true tissue acidosis ( p &lt; 0.001 ) bad discriminatory ability . They conclude metabolic acidosis occur frequently post cardiac surgery largely due raise unmeasured acid less commonly raise lactate . Hyperchloremia common , particularly cardiopulmonary bypass .
