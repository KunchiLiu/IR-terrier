Acceptable combination , recommend per National Comprehensive Cancer Network ( NCCN ) guideline , include cisplatin carboplatin combine either etoposide irinotecan ; As exception criterion , participant receive 3 cycle chemotherapy due toxicity eligible , ongoing PR CR 3rd cycle ; Participants receive &gt; 6 cycle platinumbased firstline chemotherapy eligible . Participants must initiate study treatment thoracic radiation therapy less equal 8 week ( 56 day ) last dose platinumbased first line chemotherapy . Whenever possible , formalinfixed , paraffinembedded ( FFPE ) tumor tissue block 10 unstained slide tumor sample ( archival recent ) biomarker evaluation make available submitted central lab correlative study . Participant reenrollment : This study permit reenrollment participant discontinue study due pretreatment failure ( i.e. , participant treat ) . If reenrolled , participant must reconsented . Men woman least 18 year age Women childbearing potential ( WOCBP ) must negative serum urine pregnancy test within 24 hour prior start thoracic radiation therapy Women must breastfeed . WOCBP must agree follow instruction method ( ) contraception duration treatment study drug ( ) plus 5 halflives study drug ( halflife 25 day ) plus 30 day ( duration ovulatory cycle ) total 5 month posttreatment completion . Males sexually active WOCBP must agree follow instruction method ( ) contraception duration treatment study drug ( ) plus 5 halflives study drug ( halflife 25 day ) plus 90 day ( duration sperm turnover ) total 7 month posttreatment completion . Additional criterion may apply Participants previous brain metastasis eligible provide treated asymptomatic require steroid anticonvulsant , stable disease screen tumor assessment . A 4 week disease stable interval confirm MRI CT brain contrast required treatment brain metastasis initiation thoracic radiation therapy . In addition , participant must either corticosteroids , stable decrease dose 10 mg daily prednisone ( equivalent ) . Have receive prior chest radiation Carcinomatous meningitis Pleural effusion control appropriate intervention All toxicity attribute prior anticancer therapy must resolve Grade 1 ( NCI CTCAE Version 4 ) baseline administration study drug ( ) : Patients toxicity attribute prior anticancer therapy either expect resolve and/or result longlasting sequela , neuropathy platinumbased therapy , expect interfere treatment study , fatigue , alopecia , grade 2 hematologic toxicity eligible . Women pregnant breastfeed Active , know , suspect autoimmune disease . Patients autoimmune paraneoplastic syndrome require concurrent immunosuppressive treatment exclude . Patients type I diabetes mellitus , hypothyroidism require hormone replacement , skin disorder ( vitiligo , psoriasis , alopecia ) require systemic treatment , condition expect recur absence external trigger permit enroll . A condition require systemic treatment either corticosteroid ( &gt; 10 mg daily prednisone equivalent ) immunosuppressive medication within 14 day randomization .
