	<detailed_description>The hypothesis sporadic simplex occurrence typically autosomal dominantly inherit disease instead cause mosaic mutation , specifically , mutation heart . This hypothesis mandate investigator sequence affect unaffected tissue , case , investigator construe peripheral blood DNA discard myocardium cardiac procedure . Eligible individual first undergo inform consent part study prior schedule myomectomy . The study participant also phlebotomy research sample . The NIH Intramural Sequencing Center ( NISC ) perform pair exome genome sequence first screen germline mutation know cardiomyopathy gene meet ACMG standard likely pathogenic pathogenic . Then , negative , investigator screen sequence variant present cardiac tissue absent blood DNA . Investigators also screen blood DNA secondary finding gene recommend annotation result return ACMG sequence variant deem clinically relevant gene set validate CLIA-certified laboratory result return participant .</detailed_description>
