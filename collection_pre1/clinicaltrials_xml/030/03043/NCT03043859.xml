	<brief_title>A Trial Evaluate Effectiveness Pure Prairie Living Program</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Overall Goal : To implement evaluate effectiveness lifestyle intervention ( LI ) tailor Albertans ' environment call Pure Prairie Living Program ( PPLP ) primary care network ( PCN ) setting . The PPLP delivers innovation concept ( base 4-A Framework ) , set ( PCNs ) nutrition evaluation tool ( Dietary Adherence - PDAQ ) . Background : In Canada , grow burden type 2 diabetes ( T2D ) . One four Canadians diabetes pre-diabetes number project 1 3 2020 . The associated economic burden estimate $ 16.9 billion 2020 . Adopting healthy lifestyle prevent also help effectively manage T2D . Several dietary LI recent decade target achieve healthy body weight , participation physical activity , healthy eat primary goal intervention trial delay progression disease minimize co-morbidities associate T2D . Although program achieve success improve health outcome delay risk co-morbidities , sustain long-term change participant completion intervention trial challenge . Many intervention attempt personalize treatment base individual 's preference circumstance few consider individual factor within broad framework health determinant include local food Availability , financially/physically Accessibility , culturally Acceptability nutritionally Adequacy ( 4A Framework ) . Failure achieve long-term adherence may influence social environmental health determinant . Further , Healthcare Professionals ( HCP ) designate primary responsibility educate patient prevent , treat manage chronic disease . However HCPs often lack training , skill , confidence , time require implement effective LI primary care delivery model often lack required structure organization LI . Few study consider health care system-level change require offer sustainable , high quality LI program . Hence achieve sustain adoption maintenance effect LI system level require careful planning ( consider barrier change , ongoing support personnel participant , adopt framework behaviour change , improve self-efficacy ) , implementation evaluation intervention . In Alberta , Primary Care Networks ( PCNs ) implement provide citizen access multi-disciplinary care team clinician , include dietitian . One goal PCNs increase emphasis health promotion , disease injury prevention , care patient complex problem chronic disease . Therefore , PCN set ideal implementation LI . The investigator use RE-AIM ( Reach , Effectiveness , Adoption , Implementation Maintenance ) framework plan evaluate PPLP . Previous Work Research Team : The investigate research team ( 1 ) create validated simple , practical instrument assess dietary adherence Canadian Diabetes Association ( CDA ) guideline call Perceived Dietary Adherence Questionnaire ( PDAQ ) . 2 ) create publish 4-week menu plan recipe book ( Pure Prairie Eating Plan , PPEP ) promote healthy eat general population diabetes ( www.pureprairie.ca ) . The menu provide 28 day suggestion meet recommendation Eating Well Canada 's Food Guide ( EWCFG ) CDA nutrition therapy guideline incorporate principle 4-A Framework ; 3 ) Pilot test menu plan/recipes 15 participant T2D observe 1.0 % reduction haemoglobin A1C ( HbA1c ) ( p &lt; 0.05 ) 3 month , along significant reduction weight increase PDAQ score ; 4 ) In research setting conduct single-arm phase 2 trial 73 volunteer participant T2D . HbA1c reduce 0.7 % ( p &lt; 0.05 ) . Improvements PDAQ score , serum lipid , blood pressure self-efficacy also observe . 5 ) Based successful phase 2 trial , investigator collaborate Southside PCN Edmonton pilot education program center around PPEP patient population . At system level ensure suitability program , PCN research personnel refine education program incorporate information resource PCN use exist program highlight key message education program develop phase 2 trial . The program call PPLP pilot 26 individual . At individual level , preliminary result 17 participant show significantly increase PDAQ score diabetes self-efficacy along weight loss . Specific Objectives : ( 1 ) To evaluate efficacy PPLP promote good nutrition choice ( recommend EWCFG CDA Nutrition Therapy Guidelines ) , improve diabetes self-efficacy , participation physical activity improve health outcome ( improve glucose control , lipid panel blood pressure ) ; ( 2 ) To describe perceived strength , limitation , effectiveness satisfaction PPLP HCP study participant . Methods : Study Design : This randomize , control trial ( RCT ) two arm [ intervention ( PPLP ) wait-listed control ( CON ) ] . Evaluation utilize RE-AIM Framework use mixed method . Study Sites : Study implement 3 PCNs Edmonton . Site personnel co-investigators research facilitate maximal buy-in integrate knowledge translation ( KT ) . Prior implementation study , research personnel offer support PCN team develop site specific PPLP protocol provide necessary training . Sample Size Recruitment : A convenience sample procedure employ recruit study participant advertisement poster participate PCNs . Investigators aim recruit total 180 participant , 60 participant site ( 30 participant RCT arm ) . Inclusion criterion : adult ( age 30-80 year ) T2D able read write English . Exclusion criterion : severe gastrointestinal issue diabetes complication require specialize diet type 1 diabetes . Procedure Objective 1 ) To evaluate efficacy PPLP : This intervention study span 6 month recruitment final participant visit . Details visit follow : 1 . Baseline Assessment ( Clinic Visit 1 ) : Weight height measure calculate body mass index ( BMI ) . Body composition assess use Bio-impedance analyser . Questionnaires assess demographic information , diabetes management , diabetes self-efficacy , dietary intake pattern ( PDAQ ) , quality life physical activity complete participant . Blood pressure ( BP ) assess blood sample Hb A1C lipid profile test . Physical activity quantitatively assess use pedometer 3 day . All data collect Registered nurse/Dietitian PCN . Patients randomize PPLP CON group receive usual care prior enrolment intervention . 2 . Implementation Intervention ( Clinic Visit 2-7 ) : PPLP participant attend participate 5 , biweekly nutrition physical activity education session ( ~ 90 min ) conduct PCNs ' facility facilitate PCN dietitian . Participants also take grocery store tour . 3 . 3 Month Assessment ( Visit 8 ) : All PPLP CON participant visit PCN , complete questionnaire , blood test measurement do Visit 1 . 4 . Follow-up : All participant contact via phone follow-up 2 occasion ( month ) answer question related nutrition physical activity . 5 . 6 Month Assessment ( Clinic Visit 9 ) : All PPLP CON participant return PCN final study visit , collect measure Visit 8 . Wait-list control offer PPLP ( Intervention , 3 month Assessment , Follow-up 6 Month Assessment ) . 6 . Chart review : Participant health care record access obtain information HgA1C lipid panel test do period study ( Baseline 6 month assessment ) . Data Entry Analysis : Changes ( pre post-intervention ) dietary adherence , diabetes self-efficacy , quality life , weight , BMI , Body composition , BP , HgA1C , high density lipoprotein ( HDL ) , low density lipoprotein ( LDL ) , triglyceride ( TG ) cholesterol assess compare within PPLP CON group . Patient feedback health/behaviour outcome provided end study . Objective 2 ) Qualitative study assess strength , limitation satisfaction approach : At 3 month clinic visit , participant PPLP group participate focus group discussion understand adoption information gain intervention evaluate barriers/facilitators adoption . The investigator also collect copy workbooks participant process evaluation , understand factor influence program retention , success meeting goal etc . The HCP participate one-on-one interview session period . Questions focus core RE-AIM domain . Responses help understand adoption program system level , implementation relative efficacy economic constraint , suggestion improvement maintenance PPLP . Potential Outcomes Impact Proposed Research : This study provide important information efficacy suitability PPLP PCN-based implementation manage T2D people Alberta . The investigator hypothesize PPLP participant improved nutrition physical activity-related knowledge skill manage T2D result good health . Results study inform success program individual system level . This used evidence justify scale spread LI PCNs program offer Alberta Health Services . Furthermore , PPLP base 4-A Framework adaptable , use PPLP template ; jurisdiction may support develop similar programming adapt local environment . The PI currently Scientific Director Diabetes , Obesity Nutrition Strategic Clinical Network Alberta Health Services ( AHS ) , part whose mission advance evidence-based intervention care . KT material , form write , oral e-briefs provide regularly PCN site AHS , provide early evidence outcomes RE-AIM domain . PCN personnel sit share experience learn ongoing e-meetings .
