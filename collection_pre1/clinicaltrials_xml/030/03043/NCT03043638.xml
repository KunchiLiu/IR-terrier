	<brief_summary>The aim study evaluate effectiveness platelet rich plasma ( PRP ) combine coronally advanced flap plus acellular dermal matrix application ( CAF+ADM ) treatment multiple adjacent gingival recession ( MAGRs ) . 12 patient 84 Miller Class I II recession defect participate . Sites randomly assign CAF+ADM+PRP CAF+ADM group . Gingival recession depth ( GRD ) , recession width ( GRW ) , width keratinize tissue ( WKT ) , creep attachment ( CRA ) , root coverage ( RC ) well plaque index , gingival index , probe depth ( PD ) , clinical attachment level ( CAL ) record baseline 3rd,6th 12th month postoperatively . The data analyze statistically .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Several method demonstrate treatment gingival recession defect use PRP . In 8-month randomized control trial , report significant difference PRP CTG treat group term root coverage Miller Class 1 II buccal recession defect . However , study contour texture soft tissue show valuable enhancement PRP group . The use PRP together ADM treatment MAGRs may alleviate need autogenous donor tissue . Shepherd et al . compare coronally position tunnel technique ADM application without PRP treatment single gingival recession defect report statistically significant root coverage difference group . Although numerous root coverage procedures treat condition , predictable coverage multiple adjacent gingival recession still remain challenge clinician . The aim randomize , control , clinical trial compare CAF plus ADM application together without PRP determine whether PRP provide advantage term gain coverage deep wide recession defect treatment MAGRs . In present study , use control blind split-mouth design , 14 patient multiple Miller Class I II adjacent recession defect ≥ 3mm deep bilateral operation site randomly operate either CAF+ADM+PRP CAF+ADM test control group respectively . Two patient fail return postoperative visit exit study . Finally12 patient adjacent Miller Class 1 II ( Miller ) recession defect ≥ 3mm deep non-molar teeth dental arch least two bilateral site , underwent root coverage surgery follow 12 month . The study sample consist 84 teeth associate total 12 patient ; seven patient show pair three teeth , four patient show pair four teeth , one patient show pair five teeth adjacent multiple recession deep buccal aspect tooth . The treated teeth 26 incisor , 24 canine 34 first premolar . Standardized radiograph take evaluate interproximal alveolar bone level . At baseline , 3 , 6 12 month surgery ; Miller classification recession defect ( Miller , 1985 ) , plaque index ( PI ) ( Silness Loe , 1964 ) , gingival index ( GI ) ( Loe , 1967 ) probe depth ( PD ) , clinical attachment level ( CAL ) , Probing depth ( PD ) , gingival margin ( GM ) , Gingival recession width ( GRW ) record . The pre-surgical evaluation include analysis patient 's tooth brushing technique habit . At teeth show gingival recession , coronally direct roll technique use soft toothbrush indicate minimize tooth brush trauma gingival margin . Pre-surgical therapy include scaling , root planning , polish general oral hygiene instruction . All surgical procedure perform Coronally Advanced Flap technique .</detailed_description>
