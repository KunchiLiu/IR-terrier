	<brief_summary>This study address question , sound propagate source chest chest wall ? Using sound record chest diagnostic technique advantage non-invasive non-radioactive , compare technique currently differentiate well different disease . Our aim improve ability differentiate different disease use sound record chest improve fundamental understanding mechanism sound propagate chest . Examples condition could diagnose use audible lung sound bronchomalacia , asthma , lung cancer , interstitial lung disease chronic obstructive pulmonary disease . The methodology study place sound source know location chest measure acoustic response chest wall microphone array . The sound source create play sound work channel bronchoscope locate anatomically use direct imaging . By place sound source inside chest able generate acoustic map chest test relative importance different propagation mechanism . This advance previous work , place sound source mouth . Subjects select study ask patient undergo bronchoscopy procedure whether would willing take part experiment addition standard procedure . Procedures take place Bronchoscopy Unit Addenbrooke 's hospital Cambridge . The Unit run regional speciality clinic severe chronic obstructive pulmonary disease , asthma , lung cancer , bronchomalacia interstitial lung disease nationally significant interventional bronchoscopy service . A subsidiary part study collect sound recording healthy volunteer patient common respiratory disease use microphone array . This create database lung sound quantify inter-subject variability . The study last approximately 18 month .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The study two part , A B . Both part observational study sound heard chest record acoustic array . In Part A , healthy volunteer patient Addenbrooke 's hospital sound chest record use microphone array . This do single session last approximately 15 minute . 25 healthy volunteer 25 patient include . In Part B , 50 patient undergoing bronchoscopy Addenbrooke 's hospital bronchoscopy extend 5-10 minute sound played catheter work channel bronchoscope record microphone array chest . Part B investigate 25 patient structurally 'normal ' heart ( example patient Chronic Cough ) ( Part B ( ) ) , 25 patient lung disease result 'abnormal ' lung structure ( Part B ( ii ) ) . The consultant bronchoscopist assign patient relevant group base information medical history CT scan . For Part B study exist CT scan inclusion criterion . CT scan carry specifically study .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Participant willing able give inform consent participation study . Male Female , age 18 year . Part A ( ) Healthy volunteer history smoking , recreational drug use respiratory disease . Part A ( ii ) Patient admit Addenbrooke 's pulmonary disease affect sound heard chest . Part B Patient admit Addenbrooke 's hospital bronchoscopy procedure . Part B Appropriate recent image available : chest CT within 3 month . Part B ( ) Lung structure deem 'normal ' pulmonary physician base CT scan medical history . Part B ( ) Lung structure deem 'abnormal ' pulmonary physician base CT scan medical history . Informed consent give . Subject 18 year old . Subject take part another study take part another study last 3 month . WHO performance status &gt; 2 . Subject pregnant . Part A ( ) History smoking , recreational drug use respiratory disease . Part A ( ii ) Condition judge effect breathe sound . Part B Risk associate prolong bronchoscopy procedure judge high medical professional . Part B Appropriate recent imaging ( chest CT within 3 month ) available .</criteria>
