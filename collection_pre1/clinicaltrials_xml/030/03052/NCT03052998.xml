	<detailed_description>Introduction Many study report association epilepsy , include nodding syndrome ( NS ) , onchocerciasis . A meta-analysis African population-based survey show variation epilepsy prevalence consistent onchocerciasis prevalence , epilepsy prevalence increase , average , 0.4 % 10 % increase onchocerciasis prevalence . NS epileptic disorder occur child onchocerciasis ( river blindness ) endemic region , initially observe South Sudan , Uganda Tanzania . NS occur previously health child , age mainly 5-18 year characterize head-nodding , atonic epileptic seizure . Individuals may also develop type seizure stunt growth . NS consider part spectrum onchocerciasis associate epileptic ( OAE ) disorder . We recently suggest epileptic disorder share etiological factor relate Onchocerca volvulus ( OV ) infection therefore consider Ivermectin , use treat Onchocerciasis , treatment option OAE . One dose Ivermectin eliminate microfilariae rapidly . A mathematical model predict microfilariaedermia would reduce half 24 h intake Ivermectin . Therefore , microfilariae load play important role cause OAE , may Ivermectin also rapid effect frequency seizure . Ivermectin treatment may decrease seizure frequency patient OAE In study Kabarole district Uganda 1992 , 34/91 ( 37 % ) patient report decrease either frequency severity seizures one dose Ivermectin ( 150 µg/kg ) . After treated Ivermectin , 13 ( 14 % ) individual seizures 3.7 month ( average ) . Seizures unchanged 51 ( 56 % ) , worsen 6 ( 7 % ) . In recent trial DRC , compare Moxidectin ( anti-OV experimental drug longer half-life Ivermectin ) Ivermectin , 6 ( 80 % ) 7 OV infest patient epilepsy become seizure free treatment Moxidectin Ivermectin ( randomization code break yet ) . In one person seizure frequency significantly reduce 18 month follow-up period . In person , microfilariae remain present skin snip , though low level onchocerciasis treatment . In subject become seizure free , skin snip become microfilaria free . To assess whether Ivermectin treatment may reduce frequency seizure lead seizure freedom , intend conduct short proof concept randomize clinical trial compare immediate Ivermectin treatment delayed ( 4 month ) Ivermectin treatment onchocerciasis infest person epilepsy . The primary outcome seizure freedom 4 month . Reducing burden epilepsy major impact quality life socio-economic status family affect member Africa . If able demonstrate effect Ivermectin frequency seizure , would extra argument Onchocerciasis cause epilepsy therefore increase effort eliminate onchocerciasis . Methods Study design This proof concept randomize treatment trial consist 2 treatment arm , immediate ( arm A ) delayed ( 4 month later ) Ivermectin treatment ( arm B ) . A computer-based , pre-planned age frequency seizure stratify randomization list use . The trial placebo-controlled costly expect greatly influence reporting seizure , primary outcome . Epilepsy patient arm additionally receive anti-epileptic drug ( AED ) follow local guideline epilepsy treatment DRC . Study investigator collect analyse data blind treatment . Study population , set enrollment . The trial take place select village Logo health zone onchocerciasis endemic region Ituri province DRC area far mass Ivermectin administration implement National onchocerciasis program plan start community direct distribution Ivermectin 2017 . Pilot study group area show prevalence estimate OAE approximately 5 % . Before start , village chief community health worker inform purpose specific study . When permission obtain medical team visit village set mobile clinic . Patients may fulfil eligibility criterion select examine screen visit inform consent obtain patient and/or caretaker local language ( Alur ) . If patient fulfils enrolment criterion he/she invite participate treatment trial . Detailed information trial give local language enrollment inform consent obtain . The study population consist epilepsy patient 5 year onchocerciasis without obvious risk factor epilepsy . Screening epilepsy patient OV infection After informed consent obtain , trial candidate epilepsy test presence antibody parasite antigen Ov16 Onchocerciasis IgG4 rapid test ( SD BIOLINE Onchocerciasis IgG4 rapid test , Alere , Standard Diagnostics , Inc. ; Yongin , Republic Korea ) . Moreover , skin snip take left right iliac crest Holtz corneoscleral punch ( 2mm ) . One sterilize punch use per subject . Each snip weigh analytical balance incubate 24 hour isotonic saline well flat-bottomed microtitre plate . The microfilariae emerge count use invert microscope . The number microfilaria well weight associate skin snip incubation record . The mean skin microfilarial ( mf ) density = mf count/weight snip across 4 skin snip calculate recorded mf/mg . Skin biopsy store 90 % ethanol test Ov in-house PCR method . Diagnosis Onchocerciasis infection make microfilaria detected skin snip and/or antibody parasite antigen Ov16 detect . To identify eligible epilepsy patient generalize tonic clonic seizure use 10-item Epilepsy Questionnaire previously use international epilepsy prevalence study . A person identify basis questionnaire possibly person epilepsy examine neurologist make accurate diagnosis accord definition propose International League Against Epilepsy ( ILAE ) . A case epilepsy define patient ( 1 ) least two time , unprovoked without fever , lose consciousness convulsion minimal time difference 24h two event ( 2 ) one unprovoked seizure probability future seizures similar general recurrence risk 2 unprovoked seizure . Detailed question among others age seizure onset , seizure frequency , family history seizure part baseline questionnaire . Blood sample test Taenia solium antibody antigen , absence point care test , result become available screening . Therefore test result part eligibility criterion . However , take account analyse result . Ivermectin treatment strategy Following recommendation 1 dose 150 µg/kg Ivermectin ( Mectizan® ) administer orally , treatment directly observe ( DOT ) . Ivermectin generally well tolerate . Common side effect ivermectin include fever , itching , skin rash , oedema , myalgia head ache . Anti-epileptic drug treatment strategy Both treatment arm receive anti-epileptic treatment accord standardize protocol . Treatment start phenobarbital 100 mg day may increase 150-200 mg per day 2 month insufficient seizure reduction ( le 50 % reduction seizure frequency ) . If contraindication use phenobarbital ( intellectual behavioural disorder ) persistent side effect , carbamazepine prescribe ( adults initial dose 100-200 mg per day , maintenance dose 400-1400 mg , child initial dose 5 mg/kg/day , maintenance dose 10-30 mg/kg day ) . In case side effect related carbamazepine start sodium valproate ( adults initial dose 400 mg/day , maintenance dose 400-2000 mg/day , child initial dose 15-20 mg/kg/day maintenance dose 15-30 mg/kg/day ) . In case carbamazepine sodium valproate prescribe initial dose patient increase low maintenance dose 2 week visit . In case dose-determined side effect dose reduction permit . Dose may increase 2 month visit insufficient seizure control ( le 50 % reduction seizure frequency ) . Individual treatment decision make team physician receive specific train epilepsy treatment consult team neurologist . Patient family inform follow regard epilepsy treatment ; - delay onset effect time course treatment ; - potential side-effects risk symptom ; seek help promptly distress ; - risk abrupt discontinuation/withdrawal symptom miss dos ; - need regular follow-up . Compliance Indirect ( pill count ) direct ( AED blood level ) method use check compliance AED treatment . Community volunteer train assist research team local health team follow trial participant compliance monitoring home participant . The centre visit week 2 schedule check side effect order minimize withdrawal AED treatment . Although non-compliant patient expect equally distribute among treatment arm randomization , therefore influence outcome , importance put effort minimize non-compliance . Community volunteer also train become community direct distributor Ivermectin completion trial . Endpoints Primary endpoint proportion patient achieve seizure freedom 4 month . Seizure freedom define seizure last month trial ( month 4 ) . Secondary endpoint proportion patient month 4 &gt; 50 % reduction seizure frequency compare report seizure frequency randomization , microfilarial load measure skin snip . The seizure frequency data collect start day 1 use `` seizure diary '' . Reduction seizures compare Ivermectin non-Ivermectin arm . Baseline follow-up procedure At baseline information collect seizure semiology , frequency , risk factor , treatment history Ivermectin treatment past . A full physical neurological examination perform together serological test skin snip examination . Weight height measurement carry participant body mass index calculate baseline follow-up visits.Trial participant instruct fill seizure calendar record intake AEDs . Two week randomization centre visit schedule assess potential side effect AED . Side effect record use structure questionnaire inquire know side effect phenobarbital , carbamazepine sodium valproate . To assess seizure frequency centre visit schedule 2 week , 1 , 2 , 3 4 month . To minimize loss follow-up use GPS coordinate locate study participant . During visit neurological physical examination repeat , adverse event evaluate count AED pill indirect measurement AED compliance . At 4th visit skin snip examination OV serology repeat . Additionally , AED blood level measure directly assess AED compliance . If participant able visit study centre , home visit perform monitor AED use seizure frequency . Data Analysis Sample size calculation It expect 4 month treatment AEDs ( phenobarbital , carbamazepine sodium valproate ) lead seizure freedom 50 % patient ( experience R Idro Uganda ) . In clinical trial perform Rethy ( Ituri ) compare safety parasitological efficacy Moxidectin v Ivermectin treatment person OV infection receive anti-epileptic treatment , 6 ( 80 % ) 7 trial participant epilepsy seizure free 4 month . Null hypothesis : The probability seizure freedom 4 month immediate Ivermectin treatment equal probability seizure freedom month delay Ivermectin treatment . If expect seizure freedom 4 month obtain 50 % participant phenobarbital alone additional Ivermectin treatment 80 % patient achieve seizure freedom 4 month , 104 subject ( 52 per group ) need achieve power 90 % reject null hypothesis 5 % significance level . Considering 5 % patient lose follow 110 patient enrolled trial . All comparative analysis base intention- to- treat principle : randomized patient include analysis accord result randomization . For primary endpoint , null hypothesis test compare observed proportion response arm A corresponding proportion arm B one side 5 % significance level use Cochran Mantel Haenszel test comparison two independent proportion . The Cochran Mantel Haenszel test perform control baseline frequency seizure . The test use secondary end point . Change v baseline skin micofilarial load month 4 analyzed mean T-test . Frequencies seizures compare participant without positive microfilaria skin snip month 4 . Patients lose follow regard non-responders . Similarly , patient AED regimen adapt increase number seizure consider non-responders . AED treatment change side effect possible interaction drug consider treatment failure .
