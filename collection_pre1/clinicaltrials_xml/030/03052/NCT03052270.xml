	<brief_title>Arabin Pessary Combine With Vaginal Progesterone Compare With Vaginal Progesterone Alone Prevent Preterm Delivery Singleton Pregnancies</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Preterm birth lead cause neonatal mortality disability survivor United States . Short cervical length measure transvaginal ultrasound strongly associate increase risk preterm birth . Vaginal progesterone propose management option reduce risk preterm birth asymptomatic woman singleton gestation without prior preterm birth short cervical length . Short cervix population define less equal 20 mm , measure 18 24 week . The American College Obstetrics Gynecology ( ACOG ) Society Maternal Fetal Medicine ( SMFM ) propose use vaginal progesterone either micronized progesterone capsule , 200mg daily , vaginal progesterone gel , 90 mg daily , asymptomatic woman carry singleton pregnancy incidental find short cervix . Cervical length usually measure time routine anatomical survey fetal 18 24 week gestation prevention preterm birth le 37 week . Furthermore , cervical pessary use prevention preterm birth many decade study promise result . More recently , Arabin pessary design sole purpose prevention preterm birth pregnant patient short cervix . It relatively noninvasive , operator-dependent easily place remove outpatient setting . The purpose study test hypothesis add use Arabin pessary woman identify short cervix undergo standard care treatment vaginal progesterone , decrease risk preterm birth . This prospective randomize trial use vaginal progesterone alone compare combination vaginal progesterone Arabin pessary prevention preterm delivery among woman incidentally find short cervical length . Patients diagnose short cervical length prior history preterm delivery routine mid-trimester screening enrol study randomize two group . One group give vaginal progesterone , current standard care United States . The second group receive Arabin cervical pessary , insert clinic time diagnosis , addition daily vaginal progesterone . Vaginal progesterone 200 mg 90 mg Crinone insert daily bedtime group , depend patient ' insurance coverage . The participant study follow high risk obstetric clinic per standard clinic surveillance . They receive standard prenatal care treatment warrant accord clinic condition . Hypothesis : The use Arabin pessary conjunction standard treatment vaginal progesterone effective reduce preterm delivery less 37 week woman identify short cervix mid trimester without risk factor . Primary Objective : 1 . To compare effectiveness combination vaginal progesterone Arabin pessary prevention preterm delivery prior 37 week compare vaginal progesterone alone . Secondary objective : 1 . Evaluate rate preterm delivery prior 28 , 32 , 34 week group . 2 . Evaluate need adjunctive intervention cervical cerclage , tocolysis , antibiotic Betamethasone group . 3 . To evaluate adverse maternal fetal outcome study group . 4 . Evaluate neonatal intensive care unit admission composite neonatal morbidity study group . 4.0 Eligibility Participants recruit investigator ' clinical practice diagnose short cervical length equal le 20 mm routine ultrasound screen cervical length mid-trimester anatomy scan 18-24 week UIC ultrasound unit . Those cervical length less equal 20 mm randomize ( 1:1 ) two arm : vaginal progesterone group combine vaginal progesterone Arabin cervical pessary group . Those cervical length 20 mm 25 mm follow 1 week repeat transvaginal sonogram , accord unit protocol randomize either group diagnose short cervical length 20 mm less prior 24 week gestation . 4.1 Inclusion Criteria 1 . Short cervical length equal le 20 mm 2 . Singleton pregnant woman 18 -24 week prior history preterm delivery . 3 . 18 year old time enrollment . 4 . Consent participate study 4.2 Exclusion Criteria 1 . Previous preterm delivery le 37 week 2 . Major fetal anomaly 3 . Multiple pregnancy 4 . Patient currently cervical cerclage in-situ treatment incompetence cervix . 5 . Regular uterine contraction significantly dilate cervical canal 6 . Age le 18 year 7 . Decline participate study 4.3 Excluded Vulnerable Populations Patients capacity give consent exclude study . Women age 18 enrol study . 5.0 Subject Enrollment 1 . All pregnant woman 18 year old diagnose short cervix mid-trimester routine screen cervical length counsel treatment option recruit study give consent . 2 . They recruit point diagnosis short cervical length UIC ultrasound unit high-risk obstetric clinic Women Health Center . 3 . They tell participation study voluntary already study opt stage desire . 4 . Both participant decline participate study treat equally accord clinical demand . Refusal participate study alter way access standard care need arise . 5 . All participant follow throughout pregnancy delivery . The study enrollment 18 - 24 week diagnose short cervical length . Final data participant gather delivery . 6 . Those cervical pessary device remove 37 complete week labor condition warrant interruption pregnancy . Vaginal progesterone continue 36 complete week , per standard care . 6.0 Study Design Procedures To review , standard prenatal clinical care UIC include cervical length ultrasound evaluation time routine anatomical fetal survey 18-24 week . When incidental finding shorten cervical length make , patient typically prescribed vaginal progesterone . They follow high-risk OB clinic every 2 week delivery . This randomized prospective study compare standard clinical care ( vaginal progesterone alone ) standard care plus Arabin pessary ( vaginal progesterone + Arabin cervical pessary ) prevention preterm delivery pregnant woman incidentally find significantly shorten cervix 18 24 week . 1 . This randomized prospective open-label study placebo control blind participant research team member . The study compare effectiveness vaginal progesterone versus combination vaginal progesterone Arabin cervical pessary prevention preterm delivery among patient incidental shorten cervical length . 2 . As part standard clinical care , pregnant patient usually cervical length measurement mid-trimester anatomy scan 18 24 week GE ultrasound Volusion 8 use vaginal probe . 1 . Those short cervix counsel offer opportunity participate study . 2 . All participant teach use vaginal progesterone daily prior bedtime . In addition , combination group cervical pessary place clinic right away within week request time brood diagnosis weigh option insert Arabin pessary . 3 . All participant follow high-risk obstetric clinic per standard prenatal care . Frequency follow visit individualize depend patient 's need comorbidities . Participants request bring remnant vaginal progesterone clinic ass compliance . 4 . Participants study continue prenatal care UIC high-risk obstetric clinic delivery . 5 . The study recruitment occur period 2 year start November 2016 October 2018 anticipate number study subject attain . 6 . There 10 % over-sampling cater drop study loss follow randomization , deliver another hospital . 7 . Participants access one investigator high- risk clinic nurse complaint related condition . 8 . Participants opt stage study want continue adverse effect . Studies involve use product This study use Arabin cervical pessary vaginal progesterone ( Endometrin 200 mg Crinone 90 mg gel ) . Arabin cervical pessary : This tissue tolerant non-allergic silicone ring plastic device cup-like shape use cervical insufficiency . It come various size classify accord size : The low large diameter ( 65 70 mm ) The height ( 17 , 21 , 25 30 mm ) The upper small diameter ( 32 35 mm ) The Arabin cervical pessary easily fold insert upper vaginal around cervix without pain . The majority patient receive device size 32 mm upper diameter , 21 mm height 65 mm low diameter . However , participant significantly funnel cervical canal receive device 35 mm upper diameter previous vaginal delivery receive device low diameter 70 mm . The length vaginal component cervix determine height Arabin pessary insert . Before application , participant screen treated cervical vaginal infection . All participant screen bacterial vaginosis , candida infection Trichomonas , positive test receive appropriate treatment , per standard care . The propose Arabin cervical pessary : Vaginal pessary , CE 0482 MED CERT , EN ISO 13485 . Center Research Development . Alfred-Herrhausen Str . 44 D 58455 Witten , Germany . Phone : +49 2 302 / 189214 . The device give every participant randomize pessary group free charge . Vaginal pessary use many year gynecology non-surgical treatment utero-vaginal prolapse stress urinary incontinence . Different type pessary base indication pelvic anatomical defect use . Some pessary use gynecology include : ring , ring support , Gehrung , Gellhorn , Shaatz , Donut , Cube inflatable . Vaginal pessary like Donut ring support use pregnancy management cervical insufficiency . However , pitfall use pessary easily expel due anatomical change vagina pregnancy make difficult fit well vagina . With introduction Arabin cervical pessary design allow wrap around cervix instead place vagina negate pitfall . Arabin cervical pessary use many year Europe prevention preterm delivery woman cervical incompetence . A Cochrane review Abdel -Aleem 2013 show Arabin cervical pessary beneficial effect reduce preterm birth woman short cervix , ( Abdel-Aleem et al 2013 , Liem S et al 2013 Ting YH et al 2012 ) . This non-invasive , operator-dependent silicone plastic insert vagina wrap around cervix thereby prevent shorten dilate . It easily place removed outpatient clinic require anesthesia . It need removed examination . Premature cervical shorten dilatation one important cause preterm birth . This device systemic adverse effect complaint report user slightly increase vaginal discharge . In another study systematic review efficacy Arabin cervical pessary , show majority patient ; &gt; 90 % express great satisfaction device recommend patient ( Sophie M et al 2013 ) . Endometrin Crinone vaginal progesterone ( Ferring Reproductive Health ) : Endometrin ( progesterone vaginal insert ) vaginal insert contain 100 mg micronized progesterone . Crinone vaginal gel ( 8 % ) 90 mg micronized progesterone . Progesterone natural hormone often used pregnancy various indication . One indication prevention preterm delivery woman short cervical length . It usually well tolerated except minor side effect allergic reaction component , itch , headache flushing . 7.0 Expected Risks/Benefits The expected risk include : 1 . If randomize pessary group , vaginal erosion pessary possible , extremely rare since device soft little pressure vaginal wall . This never observe side-effect patient investigator clinic use device year . Moreover , participant access one investigator 24 hour day 7 day week express complaint concern . In event participant feel discomfort pessary desire discontinue , participant require come clinic evaluation possible removal pessary . 2 . Allergic reaction component vaginal progesterone also extremely rare adverse event . The common sign allergic reaction itching . If occurs , participant come OB ER immediate evaluation come high risk OB clinic evaluate treated accordingly . As vaginal progesterone prescribe woman incidental finding shorten cervical length , risk great standard clinical care . 3 . There possibility increase vaginal discharge daily use vaginal progesterone also Arabin pessary . While also possibility infection , extremely rare . Participants counsel prior commencement possibility slightly increase vaginal discharge either intervention . 4 . There report unsuccessful placement Arabin pessary . A study do Belgium 2013 report successful placement Arabin pessary 82.2 % first attempt 90.4 % second attempt ( Cannie MM et al , Ultrasound Obstet Gynecol 2013 ; 42 : 426 - 433 ) . However , investigator experience use device UIC part investigator clinical care encourage . The investigator never encounter unsuccessful attempt place Arabin pessary . This may largely due introduction new version device 2015 softer , flexible . There also three different size device . If investigator encounter difficulty place device investigator first attempt , withdrawn investigator may place next small size device . If still successful , investigator place device direct visualization cervix use vaginal speculum allow another investigator attempt place device .</detailed_description>
