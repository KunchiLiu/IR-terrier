	<brief_summary>Crohn 's disease ( CD ) become common . One main feature disease weight loss malnutrition symptom tummy ache bloat . These problem strong negative effect patient ' quality life cause problem well understood . Enteroendocrine cell nutrient sensor bowel secrete special chemical ( call hormone ) control appetite movement gut . The investigator think control mechanism go wrong Crohn 's patient set research . Looking inside work gut always difficult time unpleasant patient , however recent development magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) allow investigator study working gut great detail without discomfort patient . Our main objective investigate difference small bowel motility CD patient active ileal disease healthy volunteer .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Background : Poor nutrition Crohn 's disease ( CD ) common poorly understood . Apart disease burden repeat surgery , reduction appetite might aetiological factor . Enteroendocrine cell ( EC ) intraluminal nutrient sensor . They play pivotal role orchestrate physiological function gastrointestinal tract . Sensing nutrient content lumen , secrete multiple peptide amine control gut secretory motor function . CD patient small bowel inflammation show increase expression EC peptide exaggerate postprandial response anorectic EC hormone . This associate symptom nausea anorexia , EC-peptide expression decrease normality remission . There longstanding interest effect CD gastric empty gastrointestinal motility . Recent technological advance allow u use magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) measure disease activity intestinal motility . Reduced intestinal motility recently show CD patient active terminal ileal disease . A significant negative correlation observe terminal ileal motility histological , biochemical radiological measure disease activity . Intestinal hypomotility may observe proximal unaffected segment small bowel well . An increase EC activity could potentially lead altered appetite symptom nausea delay gastric empty importantly delay small bowel transit . This mechanistic link describe present finding correlate patient symptom . This work potentially open new therapeutic pathway CD therapy . Optimisation study healthy volunteer ( HV ) urgently need . Aims &amp; Hypothesis : In intestinal inflammation due CD , observe up-regulation fasting postprandial EC peptide may correlate delayed whole gut transit specifically small bowel transit gastric emptying . Experimental protocol method : 15 Crohn 's patient 20 Healthy volunteer recruit . Standard MRI exclusion criterion apply . This study open-label design . The subject ask fast 2000 h. They ask fill questionnaire ensure adherence study day restriction . On day scan , allow small glass water wake . They undergo baseline fasting scan 0900 hour ( define = -45 min time point ) , together fast baseline blood sample . At 0925 hour , ask eat test meal within maximum time 20 min 0945 hour subject undergo first immediate postprandial scan ( define = 0 min ) . This follow data collection ( MRI , questionnaire data blood sample ) time point every 15 min first 60 min every 30 min 270 min . At time point , position subject , setup data collection take ~15min . After first 60 min , completion data collection time-point , volunteer keep sit upright quiet lounge next scanner . At time point , volunteer fill 100mm Visual Analogue Scale ( VAS ) symptom questionnaire score feeling fullness , bloating , distension , abdominal pain/discomfort nausea . The VAS anchor 'not ' 'extremely ' . Participants give meal end study . Participants give volume ( 750mls-1000mls ) contrast agent drink ( within 45 minute ) MRI scan ( time=30 minute ) undertake quantify disease activity . Participants give meal end study . This part research protocol . MRI scan carry supine either 1.5T 3.0 T Philips Achieva MRI scanner ( Philips Healthcare , Best , The Netherlands ) depend availability . Fasting post-prandial plasma test : On morning test , 10 ml fast blood sample drawn aprotonin/EDTA tube ( BD-361017 , BD Diagnostics , Oxford ) . Samples measure every 15 min 270 min . Samples centrifuge 4000 rpm 5 min store ice . Measurement plasma peptide : All EC peptide ( GLP-1 , PYY ) analyse ELISA technique ( Millipore , UK ) . Serum CCK measure RIA ( Euro Diagnostic Products , Sweden ) . Total EC plasma peptide response present per individual time point compositely area curve ( AUC ) .</detailed_description>
