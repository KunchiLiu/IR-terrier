	<detailed_description>The propose study single-center , observational prospective study conduct Pediatric Emergency Department , Geneva Children 's Hospital . This study begin January 2016 last one year . 53 patient plan enrol . Children receive oral tramadol pain killer emergency department , part routine care , inform current study . Patients willing participate include study sign inform consent ( respectively his/her parent legal guardian ) . A unique oral dose dextromethorphan ( 0.15 mg/kg ) give participant CYP2D6 phenotyping ( T0 ) . Two hour later , capillary whole blood sample 1 ) measure metabolic ratio dextrorphan/dextromethorphan ( MRDOR/DEM ) order determine CYP2D6 phenotype ( validated metric CYP2D6 phenotyping ) , 2 ) measure tramadol active metabolite O-desmethyltramadol ( M1 ) , 3 ) genotype CYP2D6 . Saliva sample also perform genotype CYP2D6 . Pupillometry perform administration tramadol , T0 1 twice per hour , throughout patient 's stay emergency department .</detailed_description>
