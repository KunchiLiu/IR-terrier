	<brief_title>Prospective Versus Retrospective Complications Radical Cystectomy Nephrectomy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Background : Today many different system classify co morbidity complication radical cystectomy nephrectomy . Regarding complication , Clavien Dindo classification System The National Surgical Quality Improvement Program ( NSQIP ) Charlson Comorbidity Index ( CCI ) Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group ( ECOG ) performance scale classifies comorbidity . At present time , system take parameter account , although high clinical relevance able figure significant important patient parameter influence outcome treatment modality . Such system development , cystectomy patient , study 's project group . This currently validate two large patient cohort respectively Herlev Hospital Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center , New York , USA . Virtually previous publication comorbidity complication cancer surgery , include aforementioned , base data retrospectively collect medical record . Even prospectively maintain database base predominantly data record write journal prospective , transfer retrospectively database . The problem data comorbidities complication collect registration method mind . Especially definition individual complication contain significant source error . In addition , minor complication require re-intervention re-operation , probably underreported . Involvement less complication discharge rarely report , unless lead readmission . This probably one cause uneven distribution report serious complication require re-operation compare surgical case series , number minor complication ( Clavien 1-2 ) highly variable . Even minor complication cause readmission , major impact patient 's quality life experience disease . In addition , small complication often preventable , knowledge cause context intervention . Patients undergo cystectomy , predominantly elderly patient large tobacco consumption high comorbidity . At time cystectomy associate high risk complication ( 75 % ) cancer surgery , follow nephrectomy patient ( 20 % ) . Kidney cancer , especially bladder cancer high- 1- 5-year survivalrate . The patient likely live many year complication potential impact quality life result . Since current knowledge previous publication comorbidity and/or complication cancer surgery often build retrospective collect data , highly relevant examine extent retrospectively collect data accurate comparing prospectively collect data . By conduct study , assess kind gathering give correct information complication radical cancer surgery previous publication revalidated ? Aim study The study examine difference comorbidity complication collect retrospectively medical record compare data collect prospectively . Hypothesis The prevalence register comorbidity minor complication patient undergone radical cystectomy nephrectomy , increase data collection focus prospective , compare retrospectively collect data . Design The study conduct single-blind randomized control trial , form study eliminate unknown confounders high validity . Patients include study randomize either control intervention ratio 1:1 . There two group patient : Patients admit radical cystectomy patient admit radical nephrectomy , due cancer . Study procedure In control group data comorbidity complication collect retrospectively medical record 90 day end treatment , base clearly define criterion comorbidity complication , severity ( Clavien gradation ) . In intervention group investigator must collect information comorbidity , preoperative , systematic review questionnaire cooperation patient . Details complication collect daily bedside , round , investigator . Additionally , patient receives questionnaire discharge . This must answer home . The investigator patient go questionnaire first visit ambulatory . A second identical questionnaire , stamp envelope , hand patient . In last two questionnaire patient must record contact family doctor , emergency physician , nurse hospital department . Furthermore , kind medicine , pain disability must describe . In intervention group define criterion use control group . Physicians involved management patient , blind group patient randomly assign , thus unaware whether patient intervention group control group . Subsequently intervention group retrospective collection data medical record make compare control group . This ensure randomization sufficient . Primary endpoint - Prevalence procedure relate complication ( Clavien score ) - During hospitalization postoperative discharge - Within first week discharge - Within second week discharge - Prevalence preoperative comorbidity Secondary Endpoints - Patient comorbidity : Acute myocardial infarction , angina pectoris , arrhythmia , previous cardiac surgery , venous disease , hypertension , hypercholesterolemia , abdominal aortic aneurysm , claudicatio , chronic obstructive pulmonary disease , peptic ulcer , alcohol abuse , liver disease , stroke , diabetes mellitus type I II , connective tissue disease , osteoporosis , kidney transplant , kidney failure , leukemia/lymphoma , previous malignant disease &amp; without metastasis . - Patient complication : antiemetic , antipyretic , antibiotic , diuretic , VAS ( Visual Analog Pain Scale ) score , newly start increase help home care , newly start visit home nurse , newly start physical therapy , blood transfusion - Is significant variation comorbidity collect questionnaire medical record , respectively . Statistics sample size The number patient study base following assumption : For cystectomy- nephrectomy patient complication retrospectively calculate , assume complication need intervention detect respectively 50 % 20 % . This accordance high indication major international survey retrospective register . Based previous experience , real number estimate respectively minimum 85 % 35 % . With alpha value 0,05 beta value 0,20 , give required number patient 66 cystectomy patient 90 nephrectomy patient , able demonstrate significant difference . Statistical analysis perform primarily non-parametric test use MedCalc Windows , version 15.8 later ( MedCalc Software , Ostend , Belgium ) . Data management Patients enrol sign informed consent . Patient data enter directly electronic CRF ( Clinical Registration Form ) secure server use REDCap , secure server base system security exceed demand guideline `` Persondataloven '' recommend Aarhus University . Data store accord regulation Danish Data Protections Agency . Perspectivation If study concludes project group classification system base valid data find kind data collection provide accurate picture patient relationship co-morbidities complication , future able give patient individualize treatment . This desirable patient therapist . In way study classification system able avoid patient live life post operative complication complicate treatment . This also able reduce use health care resource , us elsewhere . Ethical consideration The study conduct accordance protocol , applicable regulatory requirement ethical principle Declaration Helsinki adopt 18th World Medical Assembly Helsinki , Finland 1064 subsequent version . The patient informed consent include study , expose neither different surgery treatment would without participation study . The extra interview daily round attempt establish connection patient 's usual attendance stay hospital , avoid extra visit . There must calculate extra time spend connection participation trial . Studies show patient scientific study , feel receive good treatment . The study approve Data Inspectorate assessment ongoing Research Ethics Committee , approval mandatory start . Project feasibility The study perform internationally acknowledge research environment department urology , Aarhus University Hospital , Skejby . Baseline data collect approximately May 2017 follow-up data August 2017 . This mean data available time complete thesis paper publication . The research year student affiliate department . All necessary analysis method establish department , hardware software provide .</detailed_description>
