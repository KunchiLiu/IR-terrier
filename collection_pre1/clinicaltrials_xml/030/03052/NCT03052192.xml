	<brief_summary>In study , investigator investigate characterize acute medical patient order optimize patient course acute care department , especially regard polypharmacy undernourishment . In addition , investigator investigate underlying immunological mechanism chronic inflammation biological age population improve current knowledge possibility prevent chronic disease acute hospitalization .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Biological Aging , Medication , Malnutrition Inflammation Among Acutely Ill Healthy Elderly .</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Malnutrition : Malnutrition among elderly associate frailty , include loss weight , muscle mass , function quality life also increase number hospital admission . In study , investigator aim describe development risk factor malnutrition admission 4 week discharge , addition investigator wish characterize inflammatory state malnourish patient . Inappropriate polypharmacy : The broad variation among elderly health , number chronic disease , organ function , biological age function make prescription drug population complex task high risk inappropriate medication . 5-30 % non-elective admission cause inappropriate medication , many preventable . Therefore , investigator aim investigate feasibility pharmacist-geriatrician medication review acute care department effect MAI score . Chronic inflammation biological aging : Chronic inflammation biological age promote development age-related chronic disease . There large variation rate age individual , particular among elderly . This mean chronological age person often reflect true state aging , biological age . This challenge ability provide appropriate care predict response treatment intervention elderly patient . The underlying cause mechanisms biological age chronic inflammation well understood . There currently validate method measure biological age measure chronic inflammation use acute setting . Here , investigator aim test novel model chronic inflammation investigate role NLRP3 inflammasome , NFkB miRNAs biological age chronic inflammation . The study prospective 3 group study participant : one group include Acute Medical Department two healthy control group ( one young one old ) . The follow-up comprises two predefined examination readmission hospital . Furthermore , participant follow national registry .</detailed_description>
