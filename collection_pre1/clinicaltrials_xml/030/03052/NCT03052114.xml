	<brief_summary>The purpose study determine Electrical Impedance Tomography ( EIT ) produce reproducible accurate image people stroke head injury compare existing standard MRI , CT. Electrical Impedance Tomography relatively new medical imaging method , potential provide novel image brain function . It fast , portable , safe inexpensive , currently relatively poor spatial resolution . It produce image internal electrical impedance subject stroke head injury use ring ECG like electrode skin . EIT record take place early possible , usually within 24 hour admission . Following completion record , EIT image subsequently analyse compare image data accuracy .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Electrical Impedance Tomography ( EIT ) novel medical imaging method tomographic image rapidly produce use electrode place around body . The principal applicant 's group demonstrate EIT rapidly image functional brain activity stroke , epilepsy normal activity animal model develop instrumentation image reconstruction algorithm work well head-shaped tank . The principal aim research optimise ass accuracy Electrical Impedance Tomography ( EIT ) use scalp electrode image stroke/head injury human participant . EIT could provide unique new image modality could provide continuous monitoring bedside head injury diagnosis back ambulance GP surgery permit rapid deployment thrombolytic therapy . If successful , EIT would become standard imaging technique available ambulances A &amp; E department purpose . It would use case suspect stroke present except dedicate acute stroke centre . Imaging could undertake presentation paramedical staff ambulance , nurse radiographer A &amp; E . Images would report radiologist remotely could sanction administration thrombolytic agent physician , nurse paramedical staff . EIT would allow neuroimaging undertaken significantly early situation dedicate stroke centre available urgent CT available . This would benefit clinical staff could provide improved service patient , would enjoy improved outcome great access thrombolytic therapy . The record take place scalp electrodes patient sits comfortably chair lie bed . Recording take 10 minute 1 hour . In subject , EIT use image change brain hour follow head injury . In case , record take place hour day scalp electrode accord clinical situation . Stroke patient could also record study , similar change injure brain could also occur stroke . Following completion record , scalp electrode paste remove . Collected data analyse compare image data .</detailed_description>
