	<brief_title>Cochlear Implantation Adults With Asymmetric Hearing Loss Clinical Trial</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The study conduct multicenter , prospective , single-arm clinical trial , evaluate efficacy safety cochlear implantation patient asymmetric hearing loss . A repeated-measures analysis employ whereby patient act control . Participants recruit surgeon audiologists Otolaryngology department participate site . Participants evaluate multiple interval use variety test measure ( address sound localization , understand speech noise , understand speech quiet , quality life ) . Prior receive cochlear implant ( CI ) poor hear ear , participant evaluate follow : - Hearing aid ( HA ) good ear alone - HA poor ear alone - Bilateral HAs Participants previously use poor-ear hearing aid BiCROS hearing aid complete 1-2 week trial evaluate end trial . If performance well alternate therapy ( bilateral hearing aid BiCROS hear aid ) good ear alone performance participant prefers alternate therapy , participant continue study . Participants continue study evaluate several post-implant interval . Post-implant evaluation occur 3 , 6 , 9 , 12 month initial stimulation CI . Participants evaluate follow : - HA good ear alone - CI poor ear alone - HA CI together</detailed_description>
