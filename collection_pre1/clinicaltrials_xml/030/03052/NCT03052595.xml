	<detailed_description>Multiple sclerosis ( MS ) chronic inflammatory demyelinate disease central nervous system ( CNS ) one common neurological disease , often leading disability patient . The MS pathogenesis include vascular inflammatory component , however recently also role mitochondrial dysfunction hot topic neurodegeneration . Current project base previous project result , find sign insulin resistance ( IR ) hyperinsulinemia patient MS , seem relate chronic inflammation low physical activity . Therefore aim present project elucidate impact mitochondrial dysfunction pathogenesis impaired insulin action role neurodegenerative process . To test hypothesis ass mitochondrial function , endothelial function , change membrane protein function autonomic nervous system . Those parameter measure non-invasively sample blood , cerebrospinal fluid skeletal muscle . MS patient examine time diagnosis 12 month treatment , healthy subject use control . We expect elucidation insulin resistance cause role mitochondrial dysfunction pathogenesis disease . Potential outcome project could answer , pharmacological non-pharmacological intervention might lead improvement mitochondrial function therefore represent new approach prevent MS progression .</detailed_description>
