	<brief_summary>The benefit regular physical activity well-established . Furthermore , investigator previously show population patient implanted pacemaker , exercise 2 hour daily improve survival compare exercise less 2 hour daily . In study , aim f investigator determine whether offer subject pacemaker low level physical activity baseline counsel increase physical activity level effective measure implanted device well external pacemaker . The investigator seek enroll 30 patient 6-month 1:1 randomized interventional trial comparing level physical activity 2 group , receive physical activity counsel versus usual care . The activity level measure external pedometer accelerometer embed within pacemaker device .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The benefit habitual physical activity ( PA , activity least moderate intensity define ≥ 3 metabolic equivalent ( METs ) ) well-recognized . Emerging information large data set strongly suggest high level sedentary behavior , defined activity &lt; 1.5 METs ( equivalent amount energy expend seated activity computer work ) increase risk diabetes , cardiovascular disease , death , independent amount intensity PA . The increase risk sedentary behavior appear mediate least part reduce insulin sensitivity , impaired lipid metabolism , increase vascular inflammation , increase thrombotic tendency . The internal accelerometer embed Medtronic pacemaker register , store , report total number `` active time '' base threshold activity intensity level approximately 70 steps/min ( estimate &gt; 1.5 METs ) . This implanted accelerometer , combine regular follow-up require appropriate care make individual undergone Medtronic pacemaker implantation ideal population evaluate impact alter sedentary behavior mortality cardiovascular event . The hypothesis follow : 1. 12 week intervention increase moderate intensity physical activity deliver point care patient pacemaker result parallel increase active time measure pacemaker step count measure pedometer . 2. increase activity measure metric hypothesis 1 great usual care . Potential subject interested study screen visit determine whether meet inclusion exclusion criterion . Those qualify agree participate randomize either Physical Activity Counseling arm ( intervention arm ) Patient Usual Care arm ( control arm ) . Subjects interventional arm give pedometer physical activity counsel regular basis 3 month . Physical activity data external pedometer collect every 2 week via phone call . Accelerometry data implant pacemaker collect subject 's medical record pacemaker interrogation perform every 3 month part routine clinical care . After initial 3 month interventional phase complete , subject follow another 3 month collection pedometer well accelerometer data describe . Subjects control arm give pedometer week prior pacemaker interrogation . These subject call report number step walk day prior interrogation . Their accelerometry data capture routine clinical pacemaker interrogation . The primary outcome physical activity level group measure accelerometer time 0 , 3 month 6 month . The secondary outcome step count group measure pedometer time point .</detailed_description>
