	<brief_summary>Postpartum depression ( PPD ) major public health issue . Known `` thief steal motherhood '' since symptom obstruct mother 's capacity understand enjoy baby , PPD affect approximately 1 5 mom . Built via `` serve return '' interaction ( e.g . baby smile , mom smile back ) , sensitive responsive exchange foundation healthy child development diminish PPD , result interaction place child risk behavioural cognitive problem . Infants perceive PPD stressful ; stressor stimulate brain 's hypothalamic pituitary adrenal axis ( HPA ) trigger stress hormone ( cortisol ) release , , turn , negatively affect develop infant brain decrease brain volume . Infants ' critical period brain development vulnerable long-term effect cortisol , explain problematic developmental outcome observe child depressed mother . How investigators support depress mother infant ? Successfully treat PPD always benefit mother-child relationship ; however , research build successful pilot demonstrate nurse-guided video feedback improve mother-infant interaction context PPD . By improve interaction quality , depress mother may motivate engage play , turn , infant appear interested ready interact likely elicit positive , enjoyable experience mother . Building pilot , investigator trial effectiveness VID-KIDS ( Video-Feedback Interaction Guidance Improving Interactions Between Depressed Mothers Infants ) maternal-infant interaction infant cortisol pattern well infant development , maternal symptom depression anxiety , parent self-efficacy . If successful , future aim 1 ) integrate VID-KIDS exist service Calgary Public Health ; 2 ) commercialize VID-KIDS dissemination .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Video-Feedback Interaction Guidance Improving Interactions Between Depressed Mothers Their Infants ( `` VID-KIDS '' )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Background &amp; Rationale : Affecting ~19 % mother , postpartum depression ( PPD ) reduce maternal sensitivity positive responsiveness infant cue bid care attention . Infants perceive behaviour stressful stimulates hypothalamic pituitary adrenal axis , trigger cortisol release , persistently elevate level , inhibits neurogenesis critical period brain development . Elevated infant cortisol infant mother PPD may explain later poor child cognitive development hyperactivity anxiety problem adolescence . The negative developmental outcome poor quality interaction disrupt cortisol pattern underscore urgency intervene . Treating PPD successfully , consistently improve maternal-infant ( M-I ) interaction quality child 's development . Parent train promote sensitive , responsive interaction may help infant depressed mother develop optimally . Research Question &amp; Objectives : Conduct randomize control trial ( RCT ) depress mother infant age 2-6 month design alter negative M-I interaction child development associate PPD . Objective : examine effect intervention , VID-KIDS ( `` video-feedback intervention promote improve interaction mother kid '' ) , : 1 ) M-I interaction ; 2 ) infant cortisol pattern , infant development , maternal symptom PPD , anxiety , parent stress . Anticipate improve : 1 ) M-I interaction infant development , infant cortisol ; 2 ) symptom PPD , anxiety , parent stress , infant development . The investigator conduct cost-benefit analysis . An additional objective collect infant buccal cell future genetic/epigenetic analysis . Research suggest biological sensitivity , assess via genotyping specific genetic variant allele may confound effect intervention nature . Intervention may affect epigenome , particularly number nature methylated DNA site , treat infant differently untreated infant may link infant development . This portion study optional parents—they opt buccal cell collection . Methods : The study implement parallel group RCT compare resource referral program ( standard care ) mother PPD infant . After baseline assessment , follow 9-weeks , mother randomize intervention receive 3-video-feedback session home visit conduct 3-week interval . Mothers randomize control condition receive standard care . Both group assess baseline , immediately follow 9-week treatment/standard care interval ( post-test ) , 2-months later ( delay post-test ) . Both control intervention mother access standard care study period . Mothers ' use health service document . The investigator adhere CONSORT guideline . Intervention description . Video-feedback interventionists train Co-PI Tryphonopoulos use manualized curriculum 7-themed module offer 4-day workshop . Training module include : 1 ) Introduction Video-feedback ; 2 ) NCAST Keys Caregiving Program ; 3 ) Infant Engagement Disengagement Cues ( use NCAST 's BabyCues : A Child 's First Language Cards® ; 4 ) Video-feedback Intervention Protocol ; 5 ) Overview Behaviours Interest ; 6 ) Case Studies ; 7 ) Examples Strengths-Based Feedback . The intervention follow 8-step protocol : Ice-breaking . Interventionist initiate rapport participant . Overview Infant Engagement Disengagement Cues . Using NCAST 's BabyCues , interventionists review colour photo card illustrate explain behavioural cue commonly see infant , include potent subtle engage disengage cue . NCAST Teaching Activity . Using Nursing Child Assessment Teaching Scale ( NCATS ) protocols element , mother ask perform teaching task advance infant 's age level . Recording Interaction . Mothers infant observe video-recorded . Initial-Viewing . Specific feedback provide initial viewing . Mothers ask reflect point infant cue recognize . Interventionist document presence absence infant cue mother 's response late discussion . Second-Viewing . Interventionist mother co-view record interaction opportunity provide replay/slow review portion emphasize sensitivity responsiveness . Interventionist provide feedback : use praise reinforcing desire maternal behaviour ; information infant cue ; appraisal maternal response infant distress ; use cognitive growth foster language . Third-Viewing . The final viewing , integrate concept discuss previous screening , use positive reinforcement emphasize optimal aspect sensitivity , responsiveness constructive feedback suggest area growth . Post-viewing Debrief . Interventionist mother conclude video-feedback session discuss whatever interest mother . Mothers encourage make note infant ' engagement/disengagement cue responses non-verbal behaviour . Video feedback session last 60-90min . Subsequent session follow protocol ( new teaching activity ) build previous interaction guidance discussion .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Recruitment conduct Calgary Public Health 's immunization program . Public Health RNs routinely screen mother PPD infant ' vaccination clinic appointment use Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale ( EPDS ) 2 , 4 , 6 month age . EPDS score &gt; 12 indicative probable major depression postpartum onset make mother eligible study . Approximately 500 mother per year ( 40/month ) screen &gt; 12 EPDS . The investigator agree support parttime Calgary Public Health staff person review screening record contact potential participant determine willing contacted VIDKIDS Project Manager information study . If mother agree , VIDKIDS Project Manager contact mother explain study , assess eligibility , appropriate conduct inform consent procedure . If investigator able successfully invite 40 % mother , investigator project investigator able recruit least 16 participant per month , give u sample 2024 month . Since inception rate PPD great within first 12 week delivery , screen mother strategic interval particularly advantageous . Moreover , CoI McNeil Collaborator Philley ( Director Research Director Nursing , Calgary Public Health , respectively ) successful experience feasible approach . Eligibility base 1 ) cutoff great 12 ( indicate probable PPD ) Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale ( EPDS ) 20 ; 2 ) infant age 26 month baseline . Mothers exclude take antidepressant use intervention PPD ( i.e. , counsel , psychotherapy ) . However , mother receive parenting service ( e.g. , Circle Security program , infantparent psychotherapy ) exclude . None long meet Inclusion Criteria</criteria>
