	<brief_summary>The purpose study determine whether use robotic system improve precision therefore safety high precision step retinal surgery . Two common surgical scenario ( ERM/ILM peel sub retinal haemorrhage displacement surgery ) require high degree precision avoid damage retina choose trial . These step also select allow clearly definable outcome measure e.g . time take complete specific step operation . The main issue patient undergoing procedure regardless enrolment trial - difference study participant surgeon perform part operation assistance robot .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Robotic Retinal Dissection Device Trial</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This trial prospective interventional surgical case series pilot use robotic device retinal surgery . Specifically , investigator determine whether particular operation perform quickly safely robotic assistance . The PRECEYES Surgical System robotically assistive device develop PRECEYES Medical Robotics , Dutch-based research group Technische Universiteit Eindhoven . It design enhance surgical precision , specifically vitreoretinal eye surgery . The device provide accuracy beyond human capability &lt; 10Î¼m direction ( x , , z plane ) . The surgeon always control instrument manipulate motion controller . Patients undergo one two operation invite enroll study ( i.e . consent follow operation eligibility criterion study ) : ) undergo epiretinal inner limit membrane peel , ii ) undergo subretinal haemorrhage displacement surgery . The study involve surgeon perform specific surgical step operation , require high level precision , assistance robot . Efficiency , accuracy safety data collect . Eligible study participant recruit cohort patient attend outpatient clinic Oxford Eye Hospital require either ERM/ILM peel sub retinal haemorrhage displacement surgery . The expected duration frequency pre- post-operative follow identical standard NHS care particular operation i.e . additional study visit procedure require .</detailed_description>

Standard vitreoretinal operation deem necessary ophthalmologist , specifically : injection subretinal tissue plasminogen activator treatment sub retinal haemorrhage , peel epiretinal and/or inner limit membrane . 4 . Patients must deem fit surgery . 5 . In Investigator 's opinion , participant able willing comply trial requirement . 6 . Willing allow General Practitioner Consultant , notify participation trial ( require control arm ) .</criteria>
