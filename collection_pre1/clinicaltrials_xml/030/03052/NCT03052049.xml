	<detailed_description>This pilot study single center , open label , non-randomized feasibility study evaluate initial safety PAE treatment symptomatic bladder outlet obstruction . 50 adult male subject enrol study . If eligible patient undergo prostate artery embolization procedure Interventional Radiology department . An angiogram prostate artery do . Small bead call Bead Block microspheres inject prostate artery slow blood flow prostate hope provide relief minimal side effect complication , low urinary tract symptom cause BPH . After procedure patient follow 4 week , 12 week , 6 month , 12 month post procedure .</detailed_description>
