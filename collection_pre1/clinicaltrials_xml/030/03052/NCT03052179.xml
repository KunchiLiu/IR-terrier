	<brief_summary>Oral Lichen Planus ( OLP ) inflammatory disease mucosal skin unknown etiology . The prevalence rate England report 1-2.4 % . OLP contribute around 40 % visit 1,200 appointment 2014 Eastman Dental Hospital . Pain , discomfort , long-standing use medication , lesion recurrence adverse side effect therapy commonly associate OLP , eventually lead significant reduction patient quality life . In addition , also increase risk develop oral cancer patient OLP . The current gold standard treatment OLP corticosteroid , result adverse side effect include increase risk infection skin cancer , reduce systemic immune system , hepatotoxicity long-term usage . Alternatively , probiotic food supplement , VSL # 3 , show evidence able induce maintain remission Intestinal Bowel Disease ( IBD ) , adverse effect part bloating , report . Additionally , preliminary report show probiotic treatment Behcet 's disease Recurrent Aphthous Stomatitis ( RAS ) lesion result reduce number oral ulceration subjective relief oral discomfort . Investigator design clinical trial 30 participant allocate one two intervention , VSL # 3 placebo . Individuals biopsy-confirmed OLP experience painful symptom recruit single site research site ( Eastman Dental Hospital ( EDH ) ) . Either active VSL # 3 placebo , provide Ferring Pharmaceuticals Limited , consume twice day 30 day period . Questionnaires determine pain level , disease activity quality life complete study begin , day 15 , 30 30 day last supplement intake . In addition saliva blood sample take therapy begin , 30 day therapy , 30 day last supplement intake . The level pro-inflammatory cytokine oral microbiota investigate use sample .

	<brief_title>The Clinical Biological Effects Of The Use Of Probiotic VSL # 3 In Patients With Oral Lichen Planus</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Primary objective : â€¢ To investigate effect 30 day use supplement therapy probiotic VSL # 3 painful symptom OLP end therapy ( 30-days endpoint ) 30 day last dose ( 60-days endpoint ) . Secondary objective : 1 . To investigate effect 30 day use supplement therapy probiotic VSL # 3 OLP disease activity . 2 . To investigate effect 30 day use supplement therapy probiotic VSL # 3 quality life . 3 . To investigate acceptability intervention potential adverse effect . mechanistic study , whether : - The use VSL # 3 associate metagenomics change saliva . - The use VSL # 3 associate change serum expression profile pro-inflammatory cytokine . A randomized , double blind , placebo-controlled trial study individual OLP . Patients painful ulcerative biopsy-confirmed OLP attend Oral Medicine clinic UCLH ( University college London hospital ) Eastman Hospital meeting inclusion criterion study give information trial invite participate . 30 individual consent recruit randomise two group : group A ( 15 participant ) receive VSL # 3 group B ( 15 participant ) receive placebo . A centralised computer-generated randomization list provide independent third party use conceal allocation patient treatment . The list send drug manufacturer label VSL # 3 placebo relevant study participant code , come identical plain-packages ensure blinding ( neither participant investigator aware sachet content ) . The study statistician also blind allocation . Patients allow use best standard therapy study . To demonstrate research hypothesis , Investigators record oral painful symptom , disease activity , quality life participant , 15 30 day treatment start , 30 day ( day 60 ) last VSL # 3 supplement intake . 60 day + 15 day 21 month Single-site 30 participant Inclusion Criteria : 1 . Biopsy-proven diagnosis OLP per WHO histological criteria* evidence epithelial dysplasia malignancy . 2 . Presence painful oral symptom associate OLP , minimum severity pain 3 , 0-10 numeric pain rating scale screen confirm recruitment/start intervention . 3 . Age &gt; 18 year willing participate study . 4 . Receiving therapy receive best standard topical therapy ( typically topical corticosteroid immunosuppressant ) exclusion systemic corticosteroid systemic immunosuppressant . - I. R. H. Kramer , R. B.
