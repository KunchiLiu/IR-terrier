	<brief_summary>Irritable bowel syndrome ( IBS ) common gastrointestinal disease , affect 12 % US population 20 % population worldwide . This condition diagnose base specific symptom alter bowel habit abdominal pain , well exclusion select GI diseases . IBS cause constipation , diarrhea , abdominal cramping , bloating , also significantly affect quality life , overall functioning , work productivity . The cause IBS likely multifactorial , make difficult disease treat . However , patient often associate IBS symptom eat meal . Up 90 % IBS patient restrict diet prevent improve symptom , patient increasingly interested holistic approach disease management . At present , persuasive evidence dietary change treat IBS support diet low fermentable carbohydrate ( low FODMAP ( fermentable oligo , di , monosaccharide polyols ) diet ) . This diet , low certain carbohydrate , show improve IBS symptom ( particularly abdominal pain bloating ) , difficult follow quite restrictive . In addition , diet meant use maintenance diet ; patient undergo elimination phase follow reintroduction phase specific carbohydrate group monitor symptom . From result propose study , study team hop arrive modify , less -restrictive version low FODMAP diet equally effective , also create standard protocol patient use reintroduction phase . Patients non-constipated IBS recruit 12-week trial would help determine optimal way high FODMAP food introduce . After consent , patient would start low FODMAP diet 14 day , symptom improve , would invite continue study enter reintroduction period . During period , subject would introduce different group FODMAPs blind fashion remain otherwise low FODMAP diet monitor IBS symptom . At end study period , subject would inform FODMAPs sensitive would meet dietitian . At completion study , investigator would compile data determine FODMAPs mostly likely exacerbate IBS symptom , thus provide construct modify low FODMAP diet , `` low FODMAP-Light . '' It hop modify , less restrictive version low FODMAP diet would equally effective majority IBS patient .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Research Plan Design : Blinded FODMAP reintroduction study Duration study : 1 year Patient population : Eligible non-constipated IBS ( NC-IBS ) patient Visit 1 ( -2 week ) : After provide write informed consent , baseline descriptive data obtain include age , sex , race , pertinent medical history , prior IBS treatment , vital sign , weight , use concurrent medication supplement , duration symptom , baseline symptom . The investigator also collect blood , stool , colonoscopy sigmoidoscopy perform , mucosal biopsy , series separately fund translational study assess immune activation , permeability , microbiome . After visit , patient enter two-week screening period severity symptom assess ( see Table 1 ) . Eligible patient rate average daily abdominal pain/discomfort 4 high 11 point numerical rating scale ( NRS ) ( 0-no pain , 10-intolerable pain ) average daily stool consistency Bristol Stool Form Scale ( BSFS ) 3 high day BSFS 1 2 . Patients record symptom ( Table 1 ) daily use web-based survey instrument . Experience previous diet trial suggest approximately 50 % participant fulfill inclusion criterion screen period , term screen failure . Visit 2 ( week 0-2 ) : NC-IBS patient fulfill entry criterion invite participate remainder trial . Instruction experience research dietitian pertain low FODMAP diet administer participant open-label fashion 2 week . Patients continue record symptom daily ( Table 1 ) . Our previous work demonstrate abdominal pain bloat responsive symptom low FODMAP diet . As , primary measure study improvement abdominal pain improvement bloat key secondary endpoint . If subject experience ≥30 % reduction abdominal pain 2-week low FODMAP intervention compare baseline , invite participate blind , FODMAP reintroduction phase ( ) . If ≥30 % reduction obtain , period open-label low FODMAP diet extend additional 2 week ascertain symptom improve qualify continuation . Even reduction abdominal pain obtain , subject pay volunteer fee $ 50 time . Standard dietary compliance measure use counsel environment include prospectively record 3-day food diary open label period . Body weight course study also follow . Food diary analyze compliance via Nutrition Data System Research ( NDSR ) computer program , measure fructose , lactose , sucrose , pectin , sorbitol , add sugar . Blood stool sample collect translational study ( separately fund ) . Visit 3 ( week 2-12 ) : If ≥30 % reduction abdominal pain obtain low FODMAP diet , subject eligible continue study . For 3 day prior reintroduction individual FODMAPs , subject ingest 1-2 daily serving low FODMAP nutrition drink ( 170 calorie , Nestlé S.A. , Vevey , Switzerland ) validate low FODMAP content dietary supplement . Assuming participant experience flare symptom supplement , continue reintroduction phase , remain full FODMAP elimination diet . FODMAP reintroduction ( lactose , fructose , fructans , polyols , galactans ) achieve provide subject similar appear similar taste snack contain specific type supplemental FODMAPs prepare research dietician MCRU . The study team ask participant continue low FODMAP diet reintroduction phase , addition 1-2 supplemental low FODMAP drink per day convenience . The re-introduction FODMAP contain food conduct double-blind fashion subject investigator unaware type FODMAP reintroduce . The study dietitians remain un-blinded subject ' FODMAP treatment since responsible prepare provide FODMAP contain supplement subject . For first 7 day re-introduction phase , subject receive FODMAP contain food item ; treatment follow 7-day wash period subject receive similar food supplement contain target FODMAP . The daily dose fermentable carbohydrate contain study food supplement administer 2 dos ( moderate first 3 day higher amount later 4 day 7 day reintroduction period ) , content similar find typical American diet ( internal data healthy study subject , publish data18,20 ) . To determine optimal dosing , study team conduct careful systematic review interview experience dietician GIs determine optimal dose FODMAP challenge . The order specific FODMAP test randomized minimize chance order effect . Throughout study period , symptom data continue record daily basis ( Table 1 ) . If subject unable tolerate portion reintroduction phase , discontinue reintroduction specific FODMAP revert low FODMAP diet washout . Visit 4 : Final study visit ( 12 week ) . Subjects unblinded FODMAP component exacerbate symptom , . This information disseminate study participant dietitians immediately completion study period . The primary investigator remain blinded information analysis data . A three-day food diary obtain ensure ongoing compliance low FODMAP diet . Upon completion week 12 visit , patient pay additional volunteer fee $ 300 . Serum sample immune activation stool microbiome analysis collect Visit 2 3 analyzed funding alternate source . Body weight assess .</detailed_description>
