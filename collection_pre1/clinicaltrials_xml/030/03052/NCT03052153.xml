	<detailed_description>Lung transplantation surgery fraught multitude early well delay complication lead increased morbidity mortality . During lung transplant surgery , trans-esophageal echocardiography ( TEE ) routinely use identify cardiac anatomy measure blood flow pulmonary vein . This blood flow assess lung transplant . Blood flow small caliber vessel impact many variable result reduction blood circulate lung , although currently agreement acceptable level flow . This study look retrospective data lung transplant surgery undertaken institution since Jan 1st 2014 November 18th 2016 goal determine association exists level blood flow pulmonary vein incidence graft dysfunction post operatively .</detailed_description>
