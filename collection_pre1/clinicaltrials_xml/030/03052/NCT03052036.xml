If appropriate , coronary revascularisation percutaneous coronary intervention ( PCI ) commonly know coronary angioplasty coronary artery bypass grafting , sometimes call CABG ( surgical procedure blood vessel leg , arm chest use bypass narrowed section coronary artery ) carry . During trial , frailty score , cognition measure , co-morbidity index , questionnaire quality life , NHS personal social service utilization collect participant addition proxy quality life information collect participant 's carers . Investigators evaluate one two treatment group well live longer . Investigators also collect information quality life frailty measure 5 year period . The trial hop recruit 2300 patient approximately 30 centre across UK .</detailed_description>
