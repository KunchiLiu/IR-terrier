	<detailed_description>Specific aim : 1 . Identify readiness assessment criterion ( RAC ) essential determine rural county 's capacity support comprehensive mammography appropriate follow-up service . Through mixed-method analysis , use qualitative quantitative technique , define essential factor leadership , infrastructure local resource across five county initial BSPAN network . 2 . Using RAC ( define Aim 1 ) , determine five BSPAN1 county capacity manage sustain Outreach &amp; Health Promotion Delivery &amp; Navigation components program ( High Capacity ) , capacity manage sustain Outreach &amp; Health Promotion component ( Medium Capacity ) . We monitor performance two High Capacity one Medium Capacity counties increase program responsibility , adjust BSPAN support need , calibrate sensitivity RAC tool . 3 . Expand BSPAN 12 new rural underserved county accord RAC score evaluate county 's ability implement program component increase comprehensive mammography appropriate follow-up . Using RAC ( define Aim 1 ) , characterize capacity 12 new county implement component BSPAN program ( High , Medium , Low Capacity ) . We monitor process measure outcomes county regular interval . Results BSPAN2 demonstrate sustainable hub-and-spoke model service delivery capitalize local community strength care resident . This expansion enable 12 new county partner increase screen access , improve time diagnostic resolution , facilitate timely referral local treatment service , maintain service level original five county . BSPAN2 also produce assessment tool internet-based patient track application use disseminate hub-and-spoke model delivery mammography service rural community across country .</detailed_description>
