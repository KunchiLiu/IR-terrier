	<brief_title>Molecular Breast Imaging Screening Breast Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Keywords : molecular breast imaging , MBI , breast cancer , mammography , sonography 1 . Background : In breast cancer screening , sensitivity mammography 71-96 % , sensitivity decrease three follow group : ( 1 ) 50 year old ; ( 2 ) dense breast parenchyma ; ( 3 ) high risk breast cancer . The Health Welfare Ministry data recent 2 year show Taiwanese woman accept mammography screen ratio 36 % , represent many missed opportunity early detection . One reason reject mammography may discomfort cause compression . To solve mammography possible weakness , screen method come , molecular breast imaging ( MBI ) nuclear medicine . Radiotracer Tc-99m sestamibi find target breast tumor 20 year ago , approve FDA 1997 . However , application limit due suboptimal scan camera design . Ten year later , Mayo Clinics develop MBI technology , use small-sized semiconductor detector . Then become possible nuclear technologist patient 's breast tissue fit detector almost fashion mammography without heavy compression . 2 . Objective : The aim study evaluate recall rate diagnostic accuracy MBI , mammography breast echo , female population . 3 . Study design : Female patient refer Nuclear Medicine Department myocardial perfusion scan recruit study . It MBI myocardial perfusion scan share radiotracer . Then MBI become additional scanning . About 1800 female subject involve , mammography and/or breast sonography arrange within 6 month MBI . Participants encourage receive mammography every 2 year telephone survey . We hope study help u compare evaluate recall rate/diagnostic efficiency MBI , mammography breast sonography , determine best way breast cancer screening .</detailed_description>
