	<brief_summary>Pulmonary rehabilitation recognize core component management individual chronic obstructive respiratory disease , become first-line treatment besides drug therapy . However , current clinical evaluation system pulmonary rehabilitation , still lack simple , objective index , monitor time.Neural respiratory drive , important physiological index , closely related symptom severity disease . It may sensitive indicator evaluate effectiveness pulmonary rehabilitation . Surface EMGdi accurately evaluate neural respiratory drive , detection non-invasive , simple safety . In recent year , development signal detection analysis technology , EMG record stable , related research sample low , surface diaphragm EMG yet establishment standardization . Therefore , base previous work , project carry multicenter randomize control study , stable stage COPD patient include different way pulmonary rehabilitation training , comprehensive clinical assessment conduct training . Compared traditional evaluation method standard esophageal diaphragmatic electromyography , surface EMGdi detect change neural respiratory drive patient COPD , help explore application value surface EMGdi assessment chronic obstructive pulmonary disease pulmonary rehabilitation , provide basis promotion diaphragm optimization pulmonary rehabilitation program .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Surface EMGdi Evaluate Efficacy Pulmonary Rehabilitation Patients With COPD : Multi Center Prospective Study</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The patient COPD participate rehabilitation program 52 week . Participants propose study randomly program one four intervention group : 1 . Neither cycle training inspiratory muscle training . 2 . Cycle train program alone ( perform calibrate stationary cycle ergometer ) . 3 . Inspiratory muscle train alone ( perform threshold load device ) . 4 . Combined cycle train inspiratory muscle training ( perform calibrate stationary cycle ergometer threshold loading device ) .</detailed_description>
