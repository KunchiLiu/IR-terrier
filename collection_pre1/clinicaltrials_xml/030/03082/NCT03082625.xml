	<brief_title>Topical Magnesium Muscle Cramps Dialysis Patients .</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Study participant provide cramp diary record date , time , duration severity muscle cramp experience . Severity measure use Likert scale participant ask mark along 10 cm line severity pain experience muscle cramp ( range pain bad pain possible ) . The distance `` pain '' participant 's mark measure centimetre ( one decimal point ) provide precise value muscle cramp severity . Participants also ask record duration muscle cramp experience near minute . Patients ask record cramp diary nature unwanted skin change may experience participation study include first notice change duration affect . Serum magnesium , calcium potassium level measure record commencement study , end first stage study , end washout period end second stage study . Patients also ask describe restless leg symptom different period study - different usual , good , much good , bad , much bad . Participants see investigator enrolment study end run-in period , first treatment period second treatment period . In addition , participant ask fill Likert scale regard view effective believe treatment treatment period . 5.2 Study Plan During run-in period patient make change treatment muscle cramp . During treatment period patient ask apply five spray intervention placebo two site body commonly affected muscle cramp , twice daily . During two-week wash-out period spray apply .</detailed_description>
