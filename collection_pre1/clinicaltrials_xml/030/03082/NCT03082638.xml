	<brief_summary>The scientist work study want use blood sample identify component blood , protein , lipid breakdown product determine use diagnose Gulf War Illness ( GWI ) . An additional goal examine relationship change marker exposure symptom associate GWI . The Scientists also prepare RNA DNA blood sample genetic analysis certain protein know increase risk GWI . This information one factor include analysis result protein study .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Identification Gulf War Illness ( GWI ) Biomarkers</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Research study conduct last decade provide compel evidence Gulf War Illness ( GWI ) may cause exposure chemical , anti-nerve agent pyridostigmine bromide ( PB ) different type pesticide ( GW agent ) . These study also show brain structure involve process store memory , well brain pathway involve control pain fatigue , alter GW veteran condition . Even , nearly 25 year later , veteran GWI continue experience complex symptom illness remain difficult diagnose since current GWI diagnostic process limit use information self-reporting symptom . As , remain need develop minimally invasive blood base disease marker ( biomarker ) GWI . The goal current study identify novel biomarkers GWI assist physician provide objective diagnosis GWI appropriate clinical evaluation treatment provide GW veteran condition . Another key goal project identify biomarkers GW chemical exposure symptom profile care treatment tailor individually veteran GWI . Scientists work field GWI research continue provide strong evidence condition connect irregular response blood cell generally combat irritation injury body ( inflammation ) . Scientists also find GWI could also due damage mitochondrion , know powerhouse responsible generate energy breakdown sugar fat ( lipid ) . Scientists Roskamp Institute develop mouse model GWI order identify biomarkers brain damage neurobehavioral problem direct consequence chemical GW veteran expose 1991 GW . They identify might problem break fat brain expose mice even long subacute exposure GW agent . In particular , show change lipids belong cellular compartment ( peroxisomes ) perform task similar mitochondrion respect breakdown fat . The inflammatory process , mitochondrion peroxisomes display unique lipid class measure blood use mass spectrometry technology . These technology allow u detect measure elemental composition lipid . We plan use technology study lipid specific inflammation metabolic disturbance associate GWI order determine use biomarkers GWI . In collaboration Boston GWI consortium , test hypothesis early pilot work control GWI veterans support potential use lipid biomarkers GWI . The proposal expand pilot study determine lipid associate key disturbance GWI useful tool diagnose GWI . The proposal also try use lipid order identify subgroup GW veteran similar chemical exposure symptom pattern . This work also facilitate use blood sample GWI animal model help translational study link animal model work human study . This help fill gap two future study conduct use biomarkers determine treatment care design GWI succeed . Furthermore , identify biomarkers exposure symptom profile help deliver personalize care treatment veteran appropriately . The exist expertise collaboration Roskamp Institute Boston GWI consortium expedite successful translation endeavor appropriate biomarker tool make available clinician order assist diagnose GWI ensure appropriate medical plan develop care treatment veteran GWI .</detailed_description>
