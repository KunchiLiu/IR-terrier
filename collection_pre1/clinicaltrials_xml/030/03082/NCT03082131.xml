	<brief_title>Resistant Starch Wheat Improved Metabolic Health</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Resistant starch ( RS ) type dietary fiber provide fermentable carbohydrate ( FC ) low bowel yield positive effect postprandial glycemia weight management well digestive tract health . RS define portion starch resistant digestion amylase , allow reach distal intestine ferment resident intestinal microbiota . A limited number human study use RS high amylose corn demonstrate RS increase synthesis gut peptide improve glucose homeostasis insulin secretion . Based study , FDA recently approve follow health claim resistant starch derive corn ( RS2 ) : lower blood glucose , blood cholesterol , blood pressure ; increase mineral absorption ; improve laxation ; reduce energy intake . The purpose propose `` proof concept '' study show RS provide form wheat flour product similar beneficial effect . The investigator aim explore effect RS gut microbiota . The intestinal microbiome comprise one trillion bacterial cell comprise approximately one thousand specie perform diverse function range energy harvest , angiogenesis , immunomodulation , regulation mood behavior . Some major product bacterial metabolism include acetate , propionate , butyrate , major short chain fatty acid ( SCFA ) . These bioactive fermentation product associate improved glucose homeostasis , attribute , part , interaction receptors intestinal cell augment secretion glucagon-like peptide-1 ( GLP-1 ) , incretin hormone know stimulate insulin secretion . This study randomize , cross-over design consist two 1-week dietary intervention period well 2-week washout period . Subjects randomly assign receive either RS wheat first regular wheat first , cross opposite treatment follow 2-week washout period . Wheat product make RS wheat regular wheat provide volunteer instructed incorporate product usual diet 7 day . This study probe association gut microbiota profile , fermentation RS wheat , microbial-mediated alteration bile acid , glycemia . The investigator measure effect healthy , middle-aged human use interdisciplinary approach integrate nutrition , microbiology , intestinal physiology , analytical chemistry .</detailed_description>
