	<brief_summary>The objective study evaluate bioequivalence tablet formulation versus capsule formulation ASP8273 follow single dose fast condition subject non-small cell lung cancer ( NSCLC ) harbor epidermal growth factor receptor ( EGFR ) mutation . The study also evaluate safety tolerability tablet formulation single dose capsule formulation single multiple dose ASP8273 subject NSCLC harbor EGFR mutation .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Study ASP8273 Subjects With Non-small Cell Lung Cancer ( NSCLC ) Harboring Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor ( EGFR ) Mutations</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Study subject divide two phase : pharmacokinetic ( PK ) postpharmacokinetic phase . The pharmacokinetic phase follow randomize , 2 period , 2 sequence single dose crossover design . Each period 5 day duration . Within sequence , ASP8273 tablet ASP8273 capsule administer fasted condition . The postpharmacokinetic phase consist 1 cycle ( 28 day ) continuous daily dose post PK phase ASP8273 capsule . Dose modification allow necessary post PK phase follow step-wise dose reduction . Subject able re-escalate dose level reaction stable .</detailed_description>
