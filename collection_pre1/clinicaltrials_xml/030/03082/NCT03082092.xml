	<brief_summary>Osteoarthritis knee common important condition society . Despite various anesthetic method pain medication , pain operation still remain challenge . Steroids play role decrease inflammatory reaction stress response surgery . This study evaluate use additional steroid injection , top usual pain killer anesthesia , effect pain control recovery total knee replacement . 50 subject recruit , half randomize receive single dose steroid injection operation half receive placebo . All doctor , patient physiotherapist aware allocation . Apart steroid placebo injection , treatment ( eg : surgery , medication , rehabilitation protocol etc ) . Doctors physiotherapists assess subject 24 , 30 , 48 hour surgery upon discharge pain relief recovery . Any complication also document .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Pre-operative Intravenous Steroid Total Knee Replacement Pain Relief Recovery</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Osteoarthritis knee common important disease population . As joint replacement centre , around 600 total knee replacement perform Queen Elizabeth Hospital Buddhist Hospital per year . Despite multiple anesthetic method analgesic protocol , post-operative pain remain significant problem . Perioperative use steroid show reduce postoperative nausea vomit . In orthopaedic non-orthopaedic operation , single high dose pre-operative steroid also find effective reduce early postoperative pain . The hypothesis steroid help reduce post-operative inflammation surgical stress response . Inflammatory marker IL-6 C-reactive protein show significant reduction administration perioperative steroid . In Denmark randomized-controlled trial publish 2010 , author find single high-dose methylprednisolone significantly reduce post-operative pain upto 48 hour patient undergo unilateral primary total knee replacement . Another randomized-controlled trial conduct Korea 2013 also show significant pain control less opioid consumption 6-24 hour total knee replacement use dexamethasone . A group United States researcher demonstrate 3 dos perioperative low dose hydrocortisone could also reduce post-bilateral total knee replacement pain 24 hour significant great range motion randomized-controlled trial publish 2012 . However , data effect perioperative steroid use Chinese population receive total knee arthroplasty . Upon induction , intervention group receive 125mg methylprednisolone dilute 2.1ml diluent intravenously . The placebo group receive 2.1ml 0.9 % intravenous saline , transparent difference appearance methylprednisolone . All subject undergo total knee replacement use implant ( Zimmer NexGen LPS Flex ) surgeon . All operation do spinal anesthesia inject 1.8-2.5ml 0.5 % Bupivacaine L3/4 L4/5 disc space without fentanyl analgesic . Pre-operative , perioperative postoperative analgesic regimen standardise . Subjects assess 24 , 30 , 48 hour surgery upon discharge physiotherapist . During assessment , pain operate knee assess 100mm visual analogue scale patient perform different task , i.e . : rest , maximal knee flexion , straight knee raise 45 degree hip flexion , frame walk 5m . Range movement also document assessment . Time achieve independent frame walk length stay record term day . Analgesic consumption calculate reference total amount morphine administer patient-controlled analgesia first 48 hour total dosage rescue analgesia ( DF118 ) require . To assess severity inflammation , knee circumference ( measure superior border patella cm ) measure operation 48 hour operation . Biochemically , blood take C-reactive protein ( CRP ) day 1 surgery compare pre-operative CRP . Renal function blood sugar also closely monitored detect hypokalaemia hyperglycaemia . Subjects also ask rate sleep quality use 100mm visual analogue scale ( 0 = worst sleep , 100 = best sleep ) .</detailed_description>
