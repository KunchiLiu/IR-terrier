	<detailed_description>Severe acute pancreatitis ( SAP ) mortality 42 % . The outcome SAP relate development SIRS consecutive organ failure . Due lack causative therapy except removal bile duct stone , therapy predominantly symptomatic . Severity mortality associate early systemic inflammatory response syndrome ( SIRS ) septic complication later stage disease . With regard mark inflammatory response ( `` cytokine storm '' ) early phase SAP extracorporeal cytokine removal promise therapeutic approach . This prospective case control study investigate impact early extracorporeal cytokine adsorption CytoSorb® device haemodynamics ( primary endpoint ) several secondary outcome . Patients high probability SAP ( APACHE-II-score ≥10 ) eligible 7 day onset pain . The patient treat 48h two consecutive 24h session cytokine absorption CytoSorb®-device . All patient haemodynamic Monitoring transpulmonary thermodilution The primary endpoint define improvement vasopressor dependency index ≥20 % ( vasoactive drug use baseline , cardiac power index cardiac power index ( CPI ) use primary endpoint ) . The outcome analysis base comparison incidence primary endpoint 30 Intervention patient compare 60 matched control .</detailed_description>
