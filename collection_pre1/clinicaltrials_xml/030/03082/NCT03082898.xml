	<brief_summary>The propose study intend inform hypothesis ( 1 ) regular dose exoskeleton walk provide health benefit non-ambulatory poorly-ambulatory individual SCI , include decrease pain spasticity , improvement bowel bladder function , decrease body-mass index ( BMI ) , enhance well-being ; ( 2 ) regular dose exoskeleton walk facilitate neurological functional recovery individual SCI , particularly incomplete injury ; ( 3 ) level mobility enable low limb exoskeleton commensurate walking speed , distance , surface require community ambulation .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Mobility Therapeutic Benefits Resulting From Exoskeleton Use Clinical Setting ( SC140121 Study 1 )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Study Outline Study 1 , describe herein , assess three hypothesis , i.e. , health benefit , neurological recovery , mobility benefit , context regular dose exoskeleton walk clinical setting . These study conduct three study site , Vanderbilt University Medical Center Nashville TN , James A. Haley Veterans Hospital Tampa FL , Mayo Clinic Rochester MN . All study sit conduct identical study protocol . The study involve 24 non-ambulatory poorly-ambulatory individual incomplete complete SCI ( i.e. , 8 subject site ) . In study , `` poorly ambulatory '' define person functional independence measure ( FIM ) gait score 2 6 may able walk short distance without brace stability aid , may able walk assistance one person , whose primary mean mobility manual power-operated wheelchair . Of 24 individual , half individual motor-complete injury ( i.e. , American Spinal Injury Association Injury Scale , AIS , A B ) , half motor-incomplete injury ( i.e. , AIS C D ) . As describe subsequently Study Procedures section , study assess therapeutic functional effect exoskeleton walk 8-week period treatment , treatment consist 3 walking session per week , approximately 1.5 hour duration total 24 walking session . Therapeutic effect assess via number measurement record primarily study start , 4-week study midpoint , 8-week completion treatment , follow-up session , 8 week follow conclusion treatment . Among primary measurement use assess secondary health benefit dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry scan ( DXA ) ass bone mineral density ( BMD ) ; Modified Ashworth scale ( MAS ) rating Spinal Cord Injury Spasticity Evaluation Tool ( SCI-SET ) ass effect spasticity ; body mass ass BMI ; self-report questionnaire ass effect pain , spasticity , bowel bladder function , skin , well-being . Neurological effect non-ambulatory subject assess via neurological examination functional reach ( FR ) test . Neurological effect poorly-ambulatory subject additionally assess via Functional Independence Measure gait score ( FIM-G ) , Walking Index Spinal Cord Injury II ( WISCI-II ) , Ten Meter Walk Test ( 10MWT ) , Timed Up Go ( TUG ) test , measure subject wear exoskeleton . The level mobility provide exoskeleton motor-complete motor-incomplete injury assess use FIM-G , WISCI-II , 10MWT , Six-Minute Walk Test ( 6MWT ) , TUG test , Borg Rating Perceived Exertion ( BRPE ) , measure subject wear exoskeleton .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Age 18 year old . Size limb proportion capable fitting exoskeletal device : Height 1.55 ( 5 ft , 1 ) 1.92 ( 6 ft , 3 ) . Femur length 37.5 cm ( 15 ) 43.125 cm ( 17.25 ) . Body mass great 114 kg ( 250 lb ) . Nonambulatory poorlyambulatory . In study , `` nonambulatory '' define person walk , classify Functional Independence Measure ( FIM ) Gait score 1 ; `` poorly ambulatory '' define person FIM Gait 2 6 , may able walk short distance without brace stability aid , may able walk assistance one person , whose primary mean mobility manual poweroperated wheelchair . Sufficient upper extremity strength coordination balance use appropriate stability aid , roll walker forearm crutch , exoskeleton walking . Present SCI NLI C5 low , AIS A , B , C D ( per International Standard Neurological Classification SCI , ISNCSCI ) , nonambulatory poorly ambulatory . Chronic SCI : least 6 month postinjury , preferably postinjury 1 year . Sufficient bone health walk full weightbearing without undue risk fracture , determine subject 's personal medical doctor , approve site 's medical supervisor . Passive range motion ( PROM ) shoulder , trunk , upper extremity low extremity within functional limit safe gait use appropriate assistive device/stability aid . Skin intact interfacing robotic device . MAS spasticity score 3 less low extremity . Blood pressure heart rate within establish guideline locomotor training : At rest : systolic 150 mmHg less , diastolic 90 mmHg less , heart rate 105 bpm less . During exercise : systolic 180 mmHg less , diastolic 105 mmHg less , heart rate 145 bpm less . Ability tolerate upright stand position 20 min , passive active , without lightheaded headache . Sufficient responsiveness FES quadriceps , hamstring , tibialis anterior , gastrocnemius , define MMT response stimulation 3 great 5point MMT scale . Note specifically Study 2 , include Study 1 order economize study resource regard enrollment , training , assessment , previously discuss . Access wireless internet connection . Note require Study 3 , include Study 1 order economize study resource regard enrollment , train assessment , previously discuss . Heterotopic ossification , opinion site medical supervisor , would place subject undue risk fracture . Inability follow instruction . Colostomy bag . Women pregnant attempt become pregnant course study . Note pregnancy test require must negative woman prior enrol study , additionally require must negative every four week course study protocol . Any disease , concomitant injury , condition interferes performance interpretation protocol specify assessment . Insufficient availability complete study . Any issue , opinion investigator medical supervisor , make subject unsuitable study participation .</criteria>
