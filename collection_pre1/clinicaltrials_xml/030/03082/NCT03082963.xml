	<brief_summary>The overall goal project test feasibility perform real-time electrogram morphology recurrence ( EMR ) mapping patient persistent atrial fibrillation ( AF ) locate area high electrogram morphology recurrence rate . The Investigator believe EMR mapping integrated cardiac mapping use identify potential site ablation . Furthermore , study could help demonstrate efficacy technology 's ability terminate slow AF . The Investigator test technology ten subject undergoing second ablation procedure . The Investigator map AF utilize EMR indicate location stable activity ablate area . The Investigator believe study could produce acute AF termination AF cycle length slow . In addition test real-time electrogram morphology recurrence mapping , study would also like determine acute effect radiofrequency ablation area high recurrence rate determine long term freedom AF follow ablation area high recurrence rate .</brief_summary>
