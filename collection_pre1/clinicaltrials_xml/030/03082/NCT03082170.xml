Then participant fulfill SDQ questionnaire ( patient self- filling questionnaire ) participant assess quality swallow . Then investigator conduct swallow test - FEES test . During This test fiber optic fiber insert participant nose purpose observe pharyngeal laryngeal areas.The participant eat drink food different texture look swallow mechanism via optical fiber order identify swallow problem . forth step- Two laryngologists speech therapist go recorded swallowing test , fill two questionnaire : Swallowing performance status scale ( SPSS ) Penetration- aspiration scale ( PAS ) .
