	<brief_title>Movement-based Infant Intervention</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Rationale : Dosing pediatric physical therapy intervention current topic high interest field , researcher start investigate feasibility different approach provide early , intense intervention . Although approach laudable strongly theoretically base fundamental gap : currently unknown amount type leg movement experience necessary sufficient positive effect development infant neuromotor control . Intervention : The intervention promote movement experience 3 month sit onset infant risk developmental delay ( AR ) . The goal intervention increase amount type infant leg movement experience 1200 movement per hour awake time 1/3 single 2/3 bilateral leg movement . Objective : The first aim determine effectiveness intervention increase leg movement neurodevelopment infant AR versus cohort infant population receive standard care . The second aim determine association amount leg movement experience motor development rate . Study population : This study include 12 infant AR 3 month correct age sit onset 9 month correct age , whichever occur first . Study methodology : Single-arm , prospective intervention study . Study outcomes : The primary outcome leg movement rate 9 month correct age secondary outcome neurodevelopmental outcome ( good poor ) . Follow-up : Families contact every 4 month 9-24 month correct age update child 's medical developmental status . Statistics plan analysis . The investigator hypothesize infant study ( receive intervention ) high leg movement rate low risk poor neuromotor outcomes 9 month correct age exist observation-only sample infant population receive usual care . The investigator explore whether relationship amount movement rate motor development linear non-linear .</detailed_description>
