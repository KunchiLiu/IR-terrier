	<brief_summary>Exercise consider one three cornerstone type 2 diabetes ( T2D ) care programme ( together diet medication ) , yet majority individual T2D achieve minimum recommended level physical activity . Two key barrier exercise appear 'lack time ' high level perceive exertion fatigue . At Ulster University , recently demonstrate modified high-intensity interval training ( HIT ) intervention , consist 10-min low-intensity cycling intersperse two 20-s 'all-out ' sprint ( reduced-exertion HIT ; REHIT ) , effective improve insulin sensitivity sedentary men six week . Importantly , benefit observe despite low time commitment ( 10-min per session ) relatively low rating perceive exertion ( 'somewhat hard ' ) . As REHIT associate substantial muscle glycogen breakdown , hypothesise exercise mode may also acutely improve glycaemic control patient T2D . This study : 1 . Examine acute impact REHIT , compare no-exercise control , 24-hour glycaemic control dietary-controlled otherwise 'free-living ' condition use continuous glucose monitoring . 2 . Compare effect REHIT currently recommend level aerobic exercise previously recommend HIT model , show improve 24-hour glycaemic control T2D . 3 . Collect information individual 's perception exercise mode measure affect , motivation , perceive exertion , fatigue , enjoyment attentional focus .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>This study aim determine effect novel high-intensity interval exercise session ( REHIT ) blood glucose level typical 24 hour period . The effect REHIT compare another form high intensity interval exercise previously show beneficial T2D currently recommend moderate intensity aerobic exercise . Participants : 21 men ( age 18-60 ) type 2 diabetes recruit . Volunteers eligible take part diagnose type 2 diabetes clinician least 3 month prior study , exclusion criterion study . Potential volunteer check reason strenuous exercise may unsuitable . Participants inform experimental protocol , potential risk , verbally write provide write informed consent . The study conduct accordance Declaration Helsinki . Pre-Screening Baseline testing : Before examine effect exercise participant ask come lab 5 separate occasion , arrange accommodate individual schedule : 1 . First electrocardiography ( ECG ) test perform assess function participant heart rest exercise . This would conduct , monitor review trained cardiac physiologist involve attachment several small sticky pad ( wire attachment ) across chest measure electrical activity heart . This do firstly rest participant ask cycle stationary bike , exercise intensity slowly get hard harder ca n't go . 2 . Participants come come lab overnight fast collection fast venous blood sample . This sample collect trained phlebotomist use measure fast blood glucose HbA1c participant characterisation purpose . 3 . A cycling fitness test perform . For test participant ask cycle stationary bike , exercise intensity slowly get hard harder ca n't go . This test normally take long ~10 minute lab approximately 60 minute . We measure maximal amount oxygen participant use ( good indicator fitness ) ask breathe mouth-piece connect oxygen analyser . 4 . During fourth fifth visit participant give opportunity try exercise session use main study , order get 'feel ' ask . These session take less half hour . Main Experimental Trials : Participants complete four main experimental trial take place period 3 day . During trial measure effect different type exercise blood glucose level ~42-hour period ( 6pm DAY1 12pm DAY3 ) . Participants provide meal drinks period ask eat time day trial . Each trial separate least 5 day trial participant ask avoid strenuous tire physical activity 3 day . Over 3 day , duration trial , also ask participant wear small physical activity monitor . This device sophisticate form heart rate monitor also measure movement ( Actiheart™ ) give u detailed information participant physical activity level trial . This device connect skin either leave chest via two adhesive pad , easily detached/reattached away laboratory whenever necessary ( e.g. , bath shower ) . The Actiheart™ physical activity monitor small comfortable wear , interfere normal daily activity . Participants attend exercise laboratory ( Magee Campus , Derry/Londonderry ) 4pm 6pm DAY1 small glucose monitor fit . Participants return home give standardise even meal eaten 8pm . On DAY2 , ask participant return lab 7am ( overnight fast ) provide breakfast complete exercise session ~1 hour later ( i.e . 8:30 ) . During no-exercise trial participant remain seated rest exercise period . Participants remain lab ~45 minute allow research team monitor recovery also complete questionnaire relate fatigue/tiredness well enjoyment exercise . A short interview also conduct find participant think exercise session . From 09:30 onwards participant able return normal daily routine outside laboratory , provide meal , snack drink consume standard time 12pm DAY3 . Continuous Measurement Blood Glucose : Blood glucose level measure continuously trial fit small glucose monitor outside abdomen . This provide information body ( blood glucose ) respond meal consumed time period . This glucose monitor fit use automate insertion device short needle insert glucose sensor attach small recorder ( small needle immediately remove ) . The device waterproof additional dressing provide apply bath shower . Over 42-hour measurement period device need calibrate eight time use finger-prick blood sample handheld blood glucose meter . This order get accurate reading device . Two sample take laboratory , ask participant take handheld blood glucose meter home perform six finger-prick measurement . The procedure straightforward routinely perform type 2 diabetic . All participant show procedure obtain finger prick blood sample measure blood glucose way . Exercise Bouts : The effect three different type exercise blood glucose level compare : 1 ) High-intensity interval training ( HIT ) ; reduced-exertion high-intensity interval training ( REHIT ) ; 3 ) moderate intensity continuous exercise ( MICE ) . The HIT exercise consist ten , one-minute high-intensity interval one-minute low-intensity recovery . The REHIT session consist 10 minute easy cycling , two 20-second 'all-out ' sprint effort 3 6 minute . The moderate intensity aerobic exercise consist 30-minutes cycling moderate intensity . A fourth 'control ' condition participant exercise also perform . All exercise bout perform exercise laboratory Ulster University . During exercise session information collect perception exertion , fatigue enjoyment use standard questionnaire rating scale . Heart rate measure continuously exercise session .</detailed_description>
