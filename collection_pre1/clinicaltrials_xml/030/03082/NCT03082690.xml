	<brief_title>ImQuest ( IQP ) DuoGel Phase 1 Pharmacokinetic Study</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This phase 1 open label study safety , PK , PD single-dose 10 mL IQP-0528 rectal administration . Pharmacokinetics ( PK ) assess multiple compartment : plasma , rectal tissue , vaginal tissue , rectal fluid cervicovaginal fluid . The luminal distribution DuoGel rectum evaluate Single Photon Emission Computed Tomography/ X-ray Computed Tomography ( SPECT/CT ) . Pharmacodynamics ( PD ) assess ex vivo HIV explant challenge rectal vaginal tissue biopsy . After complete screen evaluation ( Visit 1 ) establish participant eligibility , 16 eligible participant enrol : 8 men 8 woman . A subsequent baseline visit ( Visit 2 ) safety assessment tissue ex vivo HIV explant challenge perform baseline comparison later post-drug evaluation . Participants receive single 10 mL rectal dose 99mTechnetium ( 99mTc ) -radiolabelled DuoGel ( Visit 3 ) , follow safety assessment PK PD sample three day ( Visits 3 , 4 , 5 ) . Finally , follow-up safety phone call perform week PK sampling biopsy collect .</detailed_description>
