Men ( include vasectomy ) , engage activity conception possible , eligible participate : Use barrier contraception ( male latex condom nonlatex condom NOT make natural [ animal ] membrane [ example , polyurethane ] ) investigational product least 28 day last dose investigational product . Participant judge good general health determine Principal Investigator base upon result medical history , laboratory profile physical examination perform screening . Prior treatment apremilast . Diagnosis erythrodermic psoriasis , generalize localized pustular psoriasis , medicationinduced medicationexacerbated psoriasis , new onset guttate psoriasis . Diagnosis active skin disease skin infection ( bacterial , fungal , viral ) may interfere evaluation psoriasis . Can avoid topical prescription medication psoriasis least 14 day prior baseline visit ( week 0 ) study , exception hydrocortisone 2.5 % face intertriginous area . Can avoid UVB phototherapy Excimer laser least 14 day prior Baseline ( Week 0 ) visit study . Can avoid psoralenUVA phototherapy least 30 day prior Baseline ( Week 0 ) visit study . Use systemic therapy treatment psoriasis , systemic therapy know improve psoriasis , study : Systemic therapy must discontinue least 30 day prior Baseline ( Week 0 ) visit except biologics . All biologics , except IL12/IL23 antagonist , must discontinue least 90 day prior Baseline ( Week 0 ) . Any IL12/IL23 antagonist ( e.g. , ustekinumab , briakinumab ) must discontinue least 180 day prior Baseline ( Week 0 ) . Investigational agent must discontinue least 30 day 5 halflives ( whichever longer ) prior Baseline ( Week 0 ) visit . Participant ≥ 300lbs Participant take require oral injectable corticosteroid study . Inhaled corticosteroid stable medical condition allow . Participant take medication interferes metabolism apremilast , include limited rifampin , phenobarbital , carbamazepine , phenytoin Poorly control medical condition , unstable ischemic heart disease , cerebrovascular accident myocardial infarction within prior 6 month , psychiatric disease require frequent hospitalization , condition , , opinion Investigator , would put participant risk participation study . Prior history suicide attempt time participant 's life time prior screen randomization , major psychiatric illness require hospitalization within last 3 year . Uncontrolled hypertension , measure systolic blood pressure &gt; 180 mmHg diastolic blood pressure &gt; 95 mmHg Participant infection risk factor severe infection , example Positive serology know history HIV , hepatitis B C , severe , recurrent , persistent infection ; Excessive immunosuppression factor associate , include human immunodeficiency virus infection ; Active tuberculosis ( TB ) disease ; Any significant infection require hospitalization intravenous ( IV ) antibiotics 30 day prior baseline ; Infection require treatment oral parenteral ( IV ) antibiotic within 14 day prior baseline ; Participant receive vaccination live viral agent within 30 day prior screen require live vaccination study participation include 30 day last dose study drug . Participant history hematological solid malignancy successfully treat basal cell carcinoma , nonmetastatic cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma cervical intraepithelial neoplasia carcinoma situ cervix evidence recurrence within previous 5 year . Female participant pregnant breastfeeding consider become pregnant study . Screening clinical laboratory analysis show follow abnormal result : White blood cell ( WBC ) count &lt; 3.0 x 109/L . ( Subject include WBC count &lt; 3.0 x 109/L absolute neutrophil count ( ANC ) &gt; 1000 cell / mm3 . ) WBC count &gt; 15 x 109/L ; Hemoglobin ( Hgb ) &lt; 9.0 x 109/L ; Platelet count &lt; 100 x 109/L ; Serum creatinine &gt; 1.5 mg/dL ; Serum aspartate transaminase alanine transaminase &gt; 2.0 upper limit normal Recent history substance abuse psychiatric illness could preclude compliance protocol . History substance abuse within 365 day screen visit . Alcohol use 14 drink per week within 14 day baseline visit If subject cholesterollowering medication ( e.g . statin ) , dose form medication must stable 90 day prior week 0 remain stable throughout duration study .</criteria>
