	<brief_title>Heavy Weight Versus Medium Weight Mesh Ventral Hernia Repair</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Approximately five million laparotomy perform annually United States upwards 25 % patient develop ventral hernia postoperatively . Despite prevalence ventral hernia , surgical approach procedure lack standardization . In fact , nearly 20 % -50 % patient undergoing ventral hernia repair ( VHR ) experience hernia recurrence . There several factor contribute ventral hernia recurrence . One use prosthetic reinforcement . Although previous study show use mesh VHR significantly decrease risk ventral hernia recurrence , guideline ideal prosthetic material remain unknown . In term synthetic mesh , proponent argue value medium weight material ( 40-60 g/m2 ) order combat risk postoperative deep surgical site infection minimize risk `` stiff abdomen '' chronic pain syndromes.3-5 On hand , however , proponent heavy weight material ( &gt; 80 g/m2 ) argue tensile strength lead long-term , durable hernia repair decrease risk hernia recurrence . To help determine mesh weight impact postoperative pain , propose registry base , randomized clinical trial ( RCT ) Americas Hernia Society Quality Collaborative ( AHSQC ) . The AHSQC multicenter , nationwide quality improvement effort mission improve value hernia care.6 Data collect prospectively routine care hernia patient quality improvement purpose . The information collect AHSQC offer natural repository information use research , addition quality improvement purpose . The investigator hypothesize patient undergo ventral hernia repair medium weight mesh significantly less pain patient undergo ventral hernia repair use heavy weight mesh one year operation . Both intended randomization arm study accept standard care practice use surgeon . Specific Aim # 1 : To determine use medium weight material lead decrease pain intensity one year follow ventral hernia repair . Specific Aim # 2 : To determine difference ventral hernia recurrence one year follow surgery . Specific Aim # 3 : To determine difference rate deep surgical site infection 30-days follow surgery two mesh type . Specific Aim # 4 : To determine difference quality life two group one year follow surgery .</detailed_description>
