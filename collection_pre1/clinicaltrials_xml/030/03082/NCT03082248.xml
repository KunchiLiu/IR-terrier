	<brief_summary>Low back pain common symptom , often affect adult population . Studies show past two decade , cost relate spinal surgery increase significantly , lead speculation would motivate phenomenon . Although expense physical therapy treatment less invasive surgical procedure remain relatively stable , amount spent complex spine surgery increase exponentially become procedure high cost healthcare . The criteria surgical indication uniform among surgeon therefore study second opinion spine surgery urgently need . The present study aim 1 ) quantify cost-effectiveness second opinion patient spinal surgery indication 2 ) evaluate effectiveness conservative surgical treatment degenerative disease lumbar spine 3 ) define objective criterion indication conservative surgical treatment use evidence-based medicine 4 ) evaluate prognosis biological marker follow-up patient lumbar affection 5 ) evaluate interobserver agreement physicians relation diagnosis treatment proposal patient disease lumbar spine 6 ) verify effectiveness patient operate , compare patient operate . A prospective cohort study conduct , patient indication surgical spinal treatment evaluate second opinion . First evaluation diagnosis indication patient treatment compare second opinion evaluation . All patient choose participate study follow year evaluation concern cost-effectiveness , pain , quality life , function blood biomarkers . The outcome compare use linear generalize mixed model descriptive analyzes study population program carry ; Statistical agreement observe first second opinion also patient acceptance rate treatment propose second indication , evaluate validity project approach . A five-year budget impact analysis also carry , take account population eligible treatment accord admission flow private outpatient setting .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Second Opinion Spinal Surgery Indications : Cost-Effectiveness Evaluation</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The present study could provide benefit aspect treatment approach involve patient low back pain : entire medical community present good information actual surgical indication patient low back pain ; health insurer general , spend investment really effective area , especially patient , receive appropriate treatment condition . 190 patient indication surgical treatment enrol clinical trial advise receive second opinion Hospital Israelita Albert Einstein ( HIAE ) . Both assessment ( orthopedic physician ) compare , consensus reach diagnostic hypothesis treatment , patient refer conservative surgical treatment . Any disagreement resolve committee spine surgeon ( four orthopedist four neurosurgeon 15 year experience ) . When treatment choose first medical care ( two consultation orthopedic surgeon ) conservative treatment , patient refer consultation rehabilitation center . When surgical treatment indicate , patient refer one eight surgeon spinal committee . All patient freedom choice decide participate study guide second opinion service perform recommend treatment first hospital treat . Sample size : For calculation sample size estimate , consider data present study van der Roer et al . ( 2006 ) , mean score obtain EuroQol ( EQ ) instrument pre-treatment patient 0.70 chronic patient , standard deviation 0.19 . Assuming correlation measurement obtain two main moment comparison ( baseline 10 week treatment ) order 0.5 minimally relevant difference two moment 0.07 , estimate 90 patient consider conservative treatment group . Assuming patient use second opinion service 55 % perform surgical procedure service , estimate 100 patient include group . Sample size estimate perform statistical package STATA version 10.0 , consider 90 % power 5 % level significance .</detailed_description>
