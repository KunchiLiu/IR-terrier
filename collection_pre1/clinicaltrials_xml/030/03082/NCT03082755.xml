	<brief_summary>Nighttime agitation person Alzheimer 's disease cause patient suffering , distress caregiver , often result prescription harmful antipsychotic . Effective treatment lack limited knowledge etiology nighttime agitation . The investigator propose clinical trial well elucidate whether sleep disorder , restless legs syndrome , may mechanism nighttime agitation , treatment gabapentin enacarbil ( HorizantÂ® ) reduce nighttime agitation , improve sleep , reduce restless legs syndrome behavior , reduces antipsychotic medication .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Nighttime agitation sleep disturbance person dementia ( PWD ) cause patient suffering , may accelerate cognitive decline , lead burdened caregiver , costly manage . Pharmacological intervention primarily antipsychotic hypnotic . Effectiveness unconvincing , drug associate fall , stroke , death . There lack tailor , effective , sustainable treatment nighttime agitation sleep disturbance PWD . The investigator approach problem innovative , unlike pharmacological intervention past , tailor intervention treatable condition , restless legs syndrome ( RLS ) , may cause nighttime agitation sleep disturbance . In previous research , investigator show 24 % PWD undiagnosed sleep disorder , RLS ; RLS associate nighttime agitation sleep disturbance PWD ; investigator develop validated RLS diagnostic outcome measure suitable PWD . In order investigator ' work significantly impact standard clinical practice , evidence need whether RLS behavior cause nighttime agitation , treat RLS behavior reduce stops nighttime agitation improve sleep PWD . The investigator choose gabapentin enacarbil ( GEn ) , RLS treatment research FDA approve RLS favorable safety profile . The investigator propose 8-week , double-blind placebo-controlled randomized clinical trial GEn versus placebo 136 nursing home resident nighttime agitation , sleep disturbance , RLS . The specific aim pilot study : 1 ) Determine effect GEn , compare placebo , nighttime agitation ( primary endpoint ) PWD RLS . The investigator hypothesize compare placebo control group , treatment group few nighttime agitation behavior . 2 ) Describe safety profile GEn compare placebo population . 3 ) Estimate effect size GEn compare placebo nighttime sleep RLS behavior . The investigator hypothesize compare placebo control group , treatment group well nighttime sleep few RLS behavior . 4 ) Explore whether frequency RLS behavior causal mechanism nighttime agitation . The investigator hypothesize frequency RLS behavior mediate effect GEn nighttime agitation behavior . The result study future definitive trial potential radically shift drastically improve standard clinical practice assessment treatment three highly prevalent , often comorbid condition PWD : RLS , nighttime agitation , sleep disturbance . For scientist , result may provide insight mechanism nighttime agitation sleep disturbance PWD inform future research . For PWD , finding may result less nighttime agitation discomfort RLS , improve nighttime sleep , improve sleep may enhance daytime cognitive functioning quality life . Application find home setting may result few nursing home admission PWD le caregiver burden PWD ( caregiver ) get sleep .</detailed_description>
