	<brief_summary>AUGMENT-HF II study evaluate efficacy safety Algisyl device . The purpose study investigate Algisyl employed method leave ventricular augmentation restoration patient dilate cardiomyopathy . Algisyl inject myocardium direct visualization surgical procedure . Structural abnormality heart know play central role HF , clinical evidence support strong causal relationship cardiac chamber dilation heart failure . Because dilation , contractile dysfunction , appear responsible severity disease , mitigation prevention deleterious structural abnormality leave ventricle appear important therapeutic target patient life threaten illness . Hence , therapy specifically reduce LV wall stress , target LV dilatation LV remodeling may offer important new alternative treatment heart failure . Algisyl investigate base evidence suggest ability implant reduce wall stress , reshape LV chamber reduce LV chamber size well prevent progressive ventricular dilation remodel associate HF . The physiologic response progressive exercise use direct measure ventilation gas exchange via cardiopulmonary exercise test important diagnostic tool management patient HF , quantify response therapy , reliable prognostic utility predict outcomes patient HF . Numerous study establish strong association peak VO2 mortality morbidity risk HF . Peak VO2 conceptually consider overall global marker cardiopulmonary health reflection degree impairment ventricular function ( heart 's pumping capacity ) , oxygen delivery oxygen utilization . Hence , employ change peak VO2 primary endpoint clinical study provide strong objective measure interpret independent blinded fashion , evaluate result therapeutic intervention provide equally strong assessment prognostic implication patient study . This clinical evaluation intend provide confirmatory evidence effectiveness safety device Algisyl patient advance heart failure .</brief_summary>

	<criteria>1 . The patient must able willing give write informed consent 2 . The patient adult ( age ≥ 18 year ≤ 79 year ) males female 3 . The patient must stable , evidencebased therapy heart failure Evidencebased therapy heart failure define ACEinhibitor ( ACEI ) , and/or angiotensin II receptor blocker ( ARB ) patient stable dos 1 month prior enrollment , tolerate , beta blocker ( carvedilol , metoprolol succinate , Nebivolol bisoprolol ) 3 month prior enrollment , tolerate . Recent uptitration beta blocker acceptable patient stable dose 1 month prior enrollment . Stable define 100 % increase 50 % decrease dose . Contraindications intolerance therapy document . In intolerant ACEI ARB , combination therapy hydralazine oral nitrate consider . Therapeutic equivalence ACEI substitution allow within enrollment stability timeline . Aldosterone inhibitor therapy add NYHA Class III IV symptom occur standard therapy . If aldosterone inhibitor therapy administer NYHA Class II patient , must initiate optimized prior enrollment . Eplerenone require dosage stability 1 month prior enrollment . Diuretics use necessary keep patient euvolemic . All heart failure therapeutic dosage document Case Report Forms . 4 . The patient must cardiac resynchronization therapy ( CRT ) clinically indicate , implant ≥3 month prior randomization . * Note : In patient receive CRT CRTD therapy investigator anticipate initiate therapy within 6 month randomization 5 . The patient must implant cardiodefibrillator ( ICD ) clinically indicate , implant least 30 day prior randomization . *Note : If patient clinical indication ICD refuse ICD , refusal ICD therapy must document medical record patient may enrol documentation . 6 . The patient leave ventricular ejection fraction equal le 35 % via echocardiography , cardiac catheterization , radionuclide scan , magnetic resonance imaging ( measure within last 30 day ) 7 . The patient leave ventricular end diastolic dimension index body surface area ( LVEDDi ) great equal 30 mm/m2 ( LVEDD/BSA ) LVEDD great equal 85 mm ( measure within last 30 day ) 8 . Patients must symptomatic heart failure Peak VO2 9.0 15.0 ml/min/kg ( perform use treadmill ) . Patients must perform two CPX test ( within 30 day randomization perform least 20 hour apart ) differ 15 % observed value Peak VO2 mean value 9.0 15.0 ml/min/kg two test . All CPX test perform study must Peak Respiratory Exchange Ratio ( RER ) least 1.0 accept valid test . 9 . Patient 's surgical risk must consider reasonable evaluation surgical risk include review coronary leave ventricular angiography . Surgical risk assessment include consideration risk present prior surgical procedure prior midsternotomy surgical procedure . *Note : investigator observe standard clinical practice management antithrombotic therapy patient undergoing surgical procedure accordance American College Chest Physicians Guidelines : Perioperative management antithrombotic therapy : Antithrombotic Therapy Prevention Thrombosis , 9th edition 10 . If female , patient must ( ) postmenopausal , ( b ) surgically sterile , ( c ) use adequate birth control negative serum pregnancy test within 7 day prior administration study device 1 .

Patients present restrictive cardiomyopathy due amyloidosis , sarcoidosis , hemochromatosis 4 . Patient history constrictive pericarditis 5 . Patients Q wave myocardial infarction ( MI ) within last 30 day 6 . Patients recent history stroke ( within 60 day prior surgical procedure ) 7 . A left ventricular ( LV ) wall thickness LV freewall , midventricular level , le 8 mm ( screen echocardiography must confirm minimum wall thickness 8 mm ) 8 . Patients estimate glomerular filtration rate ( GFR ) &lt; 30 mL/min/1.73 m2 9 . Clinically significant liver enzyme abnormality , i.e. , AST ( SGOT ) ALT ( SGPT ) 2.5 time upper limit normal 10 .
