	<detailed_description>Substantial evidence indicate prevalence cigarette smoking among person live HIV/AIDS ( PLWHA ) far high prevalence general US population . Moreover , strong association smoke numerous adverse AIDS- non-AIDS-related outcome detail . Thus , efficacious smoke cessation program target PLWHA need . Despite need , relatively smoke cessation intervention trial PLWHA conduct , publish result trial overly positive . The currently available literature indicate HIV+ smoker appear motivate quit , evidence high enrollment rate . Also , appear intensive intervention result significantly high quit rate ( vs. minimal intervention ) short term intermediate follow-up . However , smoke relapse rate high , treatment effect well sustain . This study seek address treatment need evaluate feasibility preliminary efficacy smartphone-delivered automate video-assisted smoking treatment ( AVAST ) . Participants ( n=20 ) randomize one two treatment condition : 1 ) Standard Treatment ( ST ; n=10 ) Automated Treatment ( AT ; n=10 ) . In ST condition , research staff provide participant in- person brief advice quit enroll proactive telephone counsel program smoking cessation . This ST approach mirror Ask Advise Connect ( AAC ) approach team previously develop implement numerous clinic setting . ST evaluate AT , fully automate AVAST approach . In AT condition , smoker provide in-person brief advice quit enrol fully automate interactive smartphone-based treatment program comprises interactive text messaging , image audio/video clip . Participants treatment condition provide nicotine replacement therapy ( NRT ) form transdermal patch . The goal pilot project establish preliminary efficacy feasibility AT . Data collect pilot use support submission NIH R01 application , determine AT perform bad resource intensive ST approach . If lack inferiority establish large project , AT approach readily scalable ; easily implement community-based clinic organization ; offer efficient way allocate limit public health resource tobacco control intervention .</detailed_description>
