	<brief_summary>Chronic kidney disease renal injury progressive irreversible loss kidney function advance stage call chronic renal failure . Although hemodialysis replace kidney function , patient suffer alteration characterize `` uremic syndrome '' typically express : motor neuropathy and/ autonomic neuropathy , cardiac musculoskeletal myopathy , peripheral vascular change , among others . Thereby , adoption physical exercise encourage . However , know ability exercise subject hemodialysis low present weakness peripheral muscular system , include inspiratory muscle . The aim study assess effect inspiratory muscle training ( IMT ) ventilatory muscle strength functional capacity patient chronic kidney disease hemodialysis . For follow assessment perform intervention : six-minute walk test functional capacity ; Kidney Disease Quality Life - Short Form questionnaire quality life ; flow-mediated dilatation endothelial function ; sit-to-stand test proximal strength low limb . The subject randomize two group , IMTG ( inspiratory muscle train group ) CG ( control group ) . The first receive IMT , five week , three time week , hemodialysis session patient orient realize three day home . The control group evaluate re-evaluated . Expected result end protocol IMT : increase inspiratory muscle strength ; long distance cover six-minute walk test ; improve quality life ; increase muscle strength low limb ; improve endothelial function .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The research develop hemodialysis unit Santa Clara hospital Santa Casa de Misericórdia de Porto Alegre . After selection patient eligibility criterion randomize IMTG control group . First patient evaluate , subsequently patient IMTG train six time per week ( three time hemodialysis unit three time home ) five week use linear pressure load device ( POWERbreathe Plus Light Resistance @ , England ) . The session take place first hour dialysis training protocol consist five series 10 repetition , serie two-minute interval accord patient´s feedback , use Borg modify scale . The overload adjust weekly , begin 50 % maximum inspiratory pressure increase 70 % along protocol period . At end follow-up , group evaluate order compare .</detailed_description>
