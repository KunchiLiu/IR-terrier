	<brief_summary>Newborn infant neonatal intensive care nursery experience multiple , painful tissue damaging procedure daily . Preterm especially extremely low birth weight critically ill newborn admit Neonatal Intensive Care Unit ( NICU ) undergo repeat skin-breaking procedure necessary survival . Sucrose accept clinical standard nonpharmacological intervention manage acute procedural pain infant . However role extremely low birth weight infant still need address . The exact dose concentration oral sucrose still clear . When Medline search carry evaluate role two different concentration ( 12 % vs 24 % ) oral sucrose reduce pain extremely low birth weight baby , limit data available . Cochrane Systemic Review also indicate specific attention efficacy safety sucrose administration extremely low birth weight preterm infant need investigate . More , work aspect identify Indian subcontinent . Hence , current study plan aim study effect 12 % 24 % oral sucrose extremely low birth weight infant initiation venipuncture also study side effect associate concentration . This preliminary work topic , result would therefore need interpreted caution . However , finding study design work provide suitable platform future well powered study population .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Sucrose Reduce Pain During Initiation Venipuncture Extremely Low Birth Weight Babies</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Research Question • Is 0.2 ml 12 % oral sucrose inferior 0.2 ml 24 % oral sucrose reduce pain initiation venepuncture extremely low birth weight infant ? Research Hypothesis • 0.2 ml 12 % oral sucrose inferior 0.2 ml 24 % oral sucrose reduce pain initiation venepuncture extremely low birth weight infant . Aims Objective 1 . To study effect 0.2ml 12 % &amp; 24 % oral sucrose reduce pain initiation venipuncture Extremely Low Birth Weight ( ELBW ) infant . 2 . To study side effect associate administration drug . Participant : The study conduct neonatal unit Kalawati Saran Children 's Hospital Lady Hardinge Medical College , New Delhi . All patient admit neonatal unit satisfy inclusion criterion exclusion criterion enrol study . Inclusion criterion : - All extremely low birth weight baby ( &lt; 1000gm ) regardless gestational age admit NICU . - Within first 48 hr post natal life - Parental consent Exclusion criterion : - Neonates require ventilatory support . - Neonates neurological impairment ( HIE , seizures ) - Receiving opiate born mother receive opiate - Newborns receive muscle relaxant , sedative , analgesic - Major congenital anomaly - 5 min Apgar le 7 - Neonates undergo surgery - Birth trauma ( especially precipitate delivery ) - Instrumental delivery Intervention 24 % sucrose prepare mix 2.4gm sucrose 10ml distilled water 12 % sucrose prepare mix 1.2 gm sucrose 10 ml distilled water . Out solution 1ml measure 1 ml syringe pack cover serially numbered opaque seal envelope . The composition packet decide senior consultant department pharmacology access randomization sequence &amp; uninvolved study . Fresh solution prepare daily unused solution discard end day replace identically numbered solution laboratory . All study solution store refrigerator 2-8°C use . The patient enrol study inform write consent obtain either parent / care giver . At initiation venepuncture 2 min prior procedure 0.2 ml solution mark patient serial administer prefilled syringe patient anterior aspect tongue avoid spillage , personnel carry procedure . The mentioned personnel blind content solution . The procedure involve put first cannula vein dorsum right hand . Gentle steady pressure apply thumb make choose vein prominent remain finger hand help stabilize hand.A 24 gauge needle insert vein asepsis 2 min neonate give allocated oral solution.The needle insert vein obtain steady blood flow.The procedure divide three phase . The pre-procedure phase begin record short needle insertion . The intra-procedure phase needle insertion needle removal post-procedure phase needle removal end record last upto 4 min . Video record do video camera focus face patient . Neonates monitor use non invasive vital sign monitor monitor heart rate .The second video camera focus non invasive vital sign monitor.Video record start oral sucrose administration continue till 4 min skin puncture.All stage needle insertion indicate camera person perform procedure . All video recording evaluate independently consultant unit , uninvolved study blind study methodology . NFCS ( Neonatal facial cod system ) use evaluate pain.The entire process involve single attempt venepuncture initiation ensure rigorously entire study . Sample size calculation As preliminary trial population ELBW neonates compare 12 % vs 24 % sucrose convenience sample 30 &amp; 30 limb take . Randomization : Sequence Generation : Block randomization use computer generate random sequence use block size six . Allocation Concealment : This do pharmacy pack 12 % sucrose 24 % sucrose identical container opaque seal envelope sequentially label accord randomization code available consultant Department Pharmacology unrelated study . Implementation : Randomization sequence generate senior consultant Department Pharmacology , unrelated study . The participant enrol study candidate accord serial number candidate blind randomization code . Blinding : The participant , research candidate well investigator assess painful response blind group assignment .Randomization code allocation sequence break data analysis finish . Statistical Methods : The data analyze use Strata ( version 11.2 ) . Descriptive statistic ( Mean , SD ) , Median ( Range ) calculate . For comparison Means different group unpaired student 's test use . For analysis categorical data chi-square test use . Continuous data also analyze use non-parametric Ranksum ( Mann-Whitney ) test . Statistical significance assume P value &lt; 0.05 .</detailed_description>
