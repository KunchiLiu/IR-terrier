	<brief_summary>This prospective , multi-center , open-label , non-randomized , multi-arm phase II trial evaluate efficacy combination therapy pembrolizumab cetuximab patient recurrent/metastatic HNSCC . There four patient cohort , include PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitor-naïve , cetuximab-naïve arm ( Cohort 1 ) , PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitor-refractory , cetuximab-naïve arm ( Cohort 2 ) , PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitor-refractory , cetuximab-refractory arm ( Cohort 3 ) , cutaneous HNSCC arm ( Cohort 4 ) . A total 83 patient ( 33 Cohort 1 , 25 Cohort 2 , 15 Cohort 3 , 10 Cohort 4 ) eligible enroll . Patients enrol 4 site : UC San Diego Moores Cancer Center , UC Los Angeles Jonsson Comprehensive Cancer Center , University Michigan Comprehensive Cancer Center , University Washington Siteman Cancer Center .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Pembrolizumab Combined With Cetuximab Treatment Recurrent/Metastatic Head &amp; Neck Squamous Cell Carcinoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Primary Objectives : To determine clinical efficacy pembrolizumab combine cetuximab patient R/M HNSCC . 1 . Cohort 1 ( PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitor-naïve , cetuximab-naïve ) : clinical efficacy define overall response rate . 2 . Cohort 2 ( PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitor-refractory , cetuximab-naïve ) : clinical efficacy define overall response rate . 3 . Cohort 3 ( PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitor-refractory , cetuximab-refractory ) : clinical efficacy define overall response rate . 4 . Cohort 4 ( cutaneous HNSCC ) : clinical efficacy define overall response rate . Secondary Objectives : 1 . To determine 12 month progression-free survival probability . 2 . To determine overall survival . 3 . To determine duration response . 4 . To assess safety tolerability pembrolizumab combine cetuximab . 5 . To evaluate correlation molecular marker disease outcome .</detailed_description>

Additional Inclusion Criterion Cohort 1 ( PD1/PDL1 Inhibitornaïve , Cetuximabnaïve ) Cohort 2 ( PD1/PDL1 Inhibitorrefractory , Cetuximabnaïve ) : 1 . Cetuximabnaïve patient may receive cetuximab therapy recurrent/metastatic setting ( treatment curative set permit ) Additional Inclusion Criterion Cohorts 2 3 ( PD1/PDL1 Inhibitorrefractory ) : 1 . PD1/PDL1 inhibitorrefractory patient must document disease progression prior response antiPD1/PDL1 therapy ( response define stable disease , partial complete response ) Additional Inclusion Criterion Cohort 4 ( Cutaneous HNSCC ) : 1 . Cutaneous HNSCC must amenable local treatment modality , include surgery and/or radiation . Patients meet exclusion criterion baseline exclude study participation . 1 . Patient salivary gland primary . 2 . Patient currently receive receive another investigational agent within 4 week prior Day 1 study . 3 . Patient receive chemotherapy radiotherapy within 4 week prior Day 1 study . Prior palliative radiotherapy metastatic lesion ( ) permit , provide least one measurable lesion radiate . 4 . Patient receive prior anticancer monoclonal antibody ( mAb ) within 4 week prior study Day 1 recover ( i.e. , ≤ Grade 1 baseline ) adverse event due previously administer agent . 5 . Patient major surgery insufficient recovery surgicalrelated trauma wound heal within 14 day Study Day 1 . 6 . Patient prior Grade ≥ 3 immunerelated adverse event ( irAE ) receive previous immunotherapy agent , unresolved irAE &gt; Grade 1 . 7 . Patient prior Grade 4 infusion reaction cetuximab . 8 . Patient known additional malignancy progress require active treatment . Exceptions include basal cell carcinoma skin squamous cell carcinoma skin undergone potentially curative therapy situ cervical cancer . 9 . Patient know active central nervous system ( CNS ) metastases and/or carcinomatous meningitis . Note : Patients previously treat brain metastasis may participate provide stable ( without evidence progression image least four week prior first dose trial treatment neurologic symptom return baseline ) , evidence new enlarge brain metastasis , use steroid least 7 day prior trial treatment . This exception include carcinomatous meningitis exclude regardless clinical stability . 10 . Patient active autoimmune disease require systemic treatment past 2 year ( i.e . use disease modify agent , corticosteroid immunosuppressive drug ) . Notes : Patients vitiligo , Grave 's disease , psoriasis require systemic treatment within past 2 year exclude . Replacement therapy ( e.g. , thyroxine , insulin , physiologic corticosteroid replacement therapy adrenal pituitary insufficiency , etc . ) consider form systemic treatment . 11 . Patient diagnosis immunodeficiency receive systemic steroid therapy ( &gt; 10mg prednisone daily , steroid equivalent ) form immunosuppressive therapy within 7 day prior first dose pembrolizumab . 12 .
