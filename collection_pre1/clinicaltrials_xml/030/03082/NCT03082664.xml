	<detailed_description>Once consent obtain patient , envelope contain study allocation retrieve Pyxis . - Non-wound vac patient undergo wound closure subcutaneous fat closure Vicryl case practicable ( extremely thin patient , may possible ) , follow subcuticular skin closure also use Vicryl . A compression dress apply . This dress usually remove clinician follow day . - Wound vac ( PICO ) patient undergo wound closure subcutaneous fat closure Vicryl case practicable ( extremely thin patient , may possible ) , follow subcuticular skin closure also use Vicryl . The wound vac system apply closed incision . This vac dress remove day hospital discharge replace second bandage wind vacuum re-activated . The patient remove bandage discard POD # 7 . This per manufacturer 's guideline length use . - If patient fails wound vac therapy- ie wound separate require traditional wound care ( pack , wet dry dressing , etc ) , PICO system longer use part care . It would unrealistic try standardize entire operative approach ( closure uterus , closure fascia ) different provider work hospital may choose participate approach specify deviate much usual technique . Different provider may typically use different kind suture ( make different material , different size ) staple close subcutaneous fat skin . However , study patient subcutaneous fat skin close manner ( Vicryl suture ) . To participate trial patient agree closure material . For study standard closure suture choose evidence suggest low rate wound complication suture compare staple . The wound re-assessed 2 week 6 week post-op follow visit . The patient assess physician post-operative clinic visit . The physician/investigator ask patient postoperative complication since surgery ask detail complication answer yes question . The investigator also obtain permission call participant patient satisfaction questionnaire 1 week post-op , possibly 2 6 week present post op/partum appointment questionnaire could obtain visit .</detailed_description>
