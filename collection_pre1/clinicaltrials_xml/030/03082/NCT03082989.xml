	<detailed_description>Fractional flow reserve ( FFR ) validate reliable surrogate inducible ischemia , support use invasive procedure functional assessment coronary lesion . Landmark randomize trial demonstrate deferral nonsignificant lesion base FFR safe , also FFR-guided revascularization associate well clinical outcome 2 year , compare standard angiography . In spite overwhelming evidence potential clinical economic benefit strong guideline recommendation , adoption FFR real-world perceive vary significantly . Reasons disparity several , operator still rely angiographic eye-balling decide functional significance coronary lesion need revascularization . Italy European country minor penetration FFR compare number percutaneous coronary intervention . Accordingly , Società Italiana di Cardiologia Invasiva ( SICI-GISE ) conceive promoted prospective nationwide study describe pattern use FFR unselected real-world population ass reason , clinical decision making , drive operator use FFR .</detailed_description>
