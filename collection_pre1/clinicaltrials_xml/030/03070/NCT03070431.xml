	<brief_title>High-precision Radiotherapy Motor Deficits Due Metastatic Spinal Cord Compression</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This multinational , multicenter study ( single arm ) supplement comparison historical , propensity score match control group ( superiority study ) . A total 44 patient ( 40 patient + 10 % potential drop-outs ) receive modern high-precision radiotherapy ( RT ) treatment metastases vertebral body plan take part clinical study . The historical control group treat 5x4 Gy conventional RT 2001 2016 consist 500 patient The primary aim study investigate local progression-free survival ( LPFS ) metastatic spinal cord compression ( MSCC ) 5x5 Gray ( Gy ) high-precision RT demonstrate regimen result significantly well 6-month LPFS conventional RT 5x4 Gy . For high-precision RT volumetric modulate arc therapy ( VMAT ) , stereotactic body radiotherapy ( SBRT ) allow treatment patient involvement one vertebra , require constraint meet . LPFS define freedom progression motor deficit RT freedom in-field recurrence MSCC ( i.e . freedom motor deficit due recurrence MSCC previously irradiate part spine ) follow RT . The LPFS rate assess 6 month end RT . In patient treated RT alone MSCC , conventional RT 10x3 Gy 2 week result similar motor function significantly well LPFS conventional RT 5x4 Gy 1 week . Since patient MSCC often significantly impair , RT regimen overall treatment time 1 week would preferable result similar LPFS 10x3 Gy 2 week . This may achieve 5x5 Gy 1 week , since equivalent dose 2 Gy fraction ( EQD2 ) respect tumor cell kill 5x5 Gy 10x3 Gy similar . The tolerance dose spinal cord , 5x5 Gy safely administer high-precision RT VMAT ( SBRT ) . Therefore , present study investigate LPFS high-precision RT 5x5 Gy 1 week . To demonstrate superiority patient study compare historical control group receive conventional RT 5x4 Gy 1 week . If superiority regard LPFS show high-precision RT 5x5 Gy , patient MSCC would benefit regimen , since achieve high LPFS rate RT regimen last 1 week ( 5x5 Gy ) instead 2 week ( 10x3 Gy ) . This study aim make significant contribution appropriate RT schedule patient MSCC . In accordance previous study assess local control MSCC , follow patient characteristic record allow adequate comparison historical , propensity-score match control group : - Age ( 2 group , depend median age ) - Gender - Type primary tumor ( breast cancer vs. prostate cancer vs. myeloma/lymphoma vs. lung cancer vs. tumor ) - Interval tumor diagnosis MSCC ( ≤15 month vs. &gt; 15 month ) - Number involve vertebra ( 1-2 vs. ≥3 ) - Other bone metastasis time RT ( vs. yes ) - Visceral metastasis time RT ( vs. yes ) - Time develop motor deficit prior RT ( 1-7 day vs. 8-14 day vs. &gt; 14 day ) - Ambulatory status prior RT ( vs. yes ) - Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group ( ECOG ) performance score ( 1-2 vs. 3-4 ) Study arm : 5x5 Gy high-precision RT 1 week Historical control : 5x4 Gy conventional RT 1 week Follow-up directly 1 , 3 6 month follow RT RT administer high-precision RT 25.0 Gy 1 week , i.e . 5.0 Gy per fraction 5 day per week ( represent EQD2 43.8 Gy radiation myelopathy ) . An EQD2 45 Gy estimate associate risk radiation-related myelopathy 0.03 % therefore consider safe . The clinical target volume ( CTV ) include vertebral soft tissue tumor see plan compute tomography diagnostic MR-imaging , spinal canal , width involve vertebra , half vertebra vertebra involve MSCC . The planning target volume ( PTV ) include CTV plus 0.8 cm cover 95 % -isodose . The maximum relative dose allow spinal cord 101.5 % prescribe dose ( represent EQD2 44.9 Gy radiation myelopathy ) . This maximum dose estimate associate risk radiation-related &lt; 0.03 % , therefore , also consider safe . Both EQD2 prescribe dose ( 41.7 Gy ) EQD2 maximum dose ( 43.8 Gy ) well tolerance dose bone . In accordance Quantitative Analyses Normal Tissue Effects Clinic ( QUANTEC ) data , mean dos EQD2 esophagus , heart lung must &lt; 34 Gy , &lt; 26 Gy ≤7 Gy , respectively . Taking account radiation regimen five fraction , correspond mean dos per fraction 4.5 Gy , 3.8 Gy 1.54 Gy , respectively . MSCC may affect single multiple spinal site . All site need treat high-precision RT follow dose prescription constraint give . It recommend patient receive concomitant treatment dexamethasone period radiotherapy indicate . Quality assurance plan : Monitoring : The Centre Clinical Trials Lübeck conduct clinical on-site monitoring German site accord Good Clinical Practice write standard operating procedure ( SOPs ) ensure patient ' right safety well reliability trial result . The frequency monitor visit per site define depend recruitment rate quality data . Patient Registration : The patient assign 2 code number , number contribute center plus patient identification number start 001 chronologically ongoing . Coordination supervision inclusion patient perform Department Radiation Oncology University Lübeck , Germany . Sample size calculation : The primary goal study assess high-precision RT 5x5 Gy 1 week respect 6-month LPFS demonstrate rate superior conventional RT 5x4 Gy respect LPFS MSCC ( hypothesis ) . With respect tumor cell kill , EQD2 5x5 Gy similar EQD2 10x3 Gy ( 31.3 Gy vs. 32.5 Gy ) high EQD2 5x4 Gy ( 23.3 Gy ) . In previous prospective non-randomized study , 6-month LPFS rate 86 % longer-course RT 67 % short-course RT , respectively ( p=0.034 ) . In study , 95 117 patient ( 81 % ) longer-course RT group receive 10x3 Gy , 91 114 patient ( 80 % ) short-course RT group receive 5x4 Gy . Thus , assume - present study - conventional RT 5x4 Gy fact result 6-month LPFS rate 67 % , increase roughly 20 percentage point consider clinically minimal relevant even appear realistic apply high-precision RT 5x5 Gy . The sample size chosen obtain prospective data interpret allow comparison historical data : - A sample size least 40 eligible patient need estimate probability LPFS 6 month adequate precision , base follow assumption : - 6-month LPFS assume 87 % - 6-month LPFS estimate precision plus/minus 20 percentage point express half length associate two-sided confidence interval confidence coefficient 95 % . - The power -i.e . probability obtain precision , least 80 % - Confidence limit use approach sample size . Assuming roughly 10 % enrolled patient eligible efficacy analysis due early lost-to-follow-up due premature discontinuation high-precision RT , total 44 patient enrol prospective part trial . - The aim confirmatory study compare prospectively collect data historical , propensity-score match cohort collect time data analysis . Assuming simplicity conservative power calculation comparison could conduct simple Pearson-Chi-Square test use two-sided significance level 5 % ( 10 % ) , power 79 % ( 86 % ) reach , 40 patient treat high-precision RT roughly 400 patient historical control group qualify Propensity-Score adjust comparison assume expect 6-month LPFS 87 % 67 % , respectively . Taking account sophisticated propensity-score adjust statistical analysis increase statistical power , power treatment arm comparison reach 40 eligible patient prospective part study assume least 80 % . Primary endpoint : The primary endpoint ( LPFS MSCC ) evaluate base sample size calculation . The evaluation perform patient , available assessment primary endpoint receive least 80 % plan RT dose . Due open nature study , blind data review necessary . The safety population include patient receive least 1 fraction high-precision RT . LPFS define freedom progression motor deficit RT freedom in-field recurrence MSCC ( i.e . freedom motor deficit due recurrence MSCC previously irradiate part spine ) follow RT . Deterioration motor deficit RT count LPFS 0 month . Freedom in-field recurrence follow RT reference last day RT . LPFS rate calculate potential prognostic factor use Kaplan-Meier method . Differences Kaplan-Meier curve calculate log-rank test ( univariate analysis ) . Factors achieve significance ( p &lt; 0.05 ) show trend ( p &lt; 0.06 ) univariate analysis additionally include multivariate analysis ( Cox proportional hazard model ) . Secondary endpoint : The comparison high-precision RT group conventional RT group respect effect motor function sensory function ( improvement , progression , deterioration ) evaluate ordered logit model adjust propensity score , data impact RT motor sensory function ordinal ( -1 = deterioration , 0 = progression , 1 = improvement ) . An improvement deterioration motor function define change least 1 point 5-point scale . Post-RT ambulatory sphincter dysfunction rate compare group Chi-square test stratify propensity score . Effect RT motor function , post-RT ambulatory rate , sensory function sphincter dysfunction evaluate directly RT 1 , 3 6 month follow RT patient alive available assessment . P-values &lt; 0.05 consider significant . Overall survival ( OS ) count last day RT . OS rate calculate Kaplan-Meier-method . Differences Kaplan-Meier curve analyze log-rank test . Again , p-values &lt; 0.05 consider significant . Factors achieve significance show trend ( p &lt; 0.06 ) univariate analysis include multivariate analysis ( Cox proportional hazard model ) .
