	<brief_title>A Study Plitidepsin Patients With Relapsed Refractory Angioimmunoblastic T-cell Lymphoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Prospective , multicenter , phase II clinical trial determine efficacy plitidepsin patient relapsed/refractory ( R/R ) AITL . The primary endpoint overall response rate ( ORR ) accord Lugano classification response criterion per independent review . Medical specialist ( radiologist hematologist ) directly involve care patient AITL ( participate trial investigator ) review efficacy data ( include radiological assessment , bone marrow biopsy ) assign best response date objective response progression/censoring accord independent evaluation . Central pathological review patient 's original diagnosis report ( ) require inclusion . Two futility analysis primary endpoint ( ORR accord Lugano classification criterion per Independent Review Committee ( IRC ) ) plan around six month approximately 25 % 50 % eligible patient ( i.e. , 15 30 patient respectively AITL confirm central pathological review ) treat . Two less responder 15 patient seven less responder 30 patient , accord boundary sample size assumption , mean alternative hypothesis could reject , thus recruitment might stop time first second futility analysis , respectively . Otherwise , accrual continue 60 patient AITL confirm central pathological review . This decision take time Independent Data Monitoring Committee ( IDMC ) . The IDMC , include specialist peripheral T-cell lymphoma ( PTCL ) support medical statistician , review data provide Investigators , IRC efficacy assessment safety information advise whether study continue . Recruitment continue review period . If 19 responder 60 patient , efficacy plitidepsin consider clinically relevant AITL patient . Central pathological review conduct experienced pathologist appoint Sponsor available investigative site consultation AITL diagnosis confirmation . Central pathological review require ( ) local histopathology report prior patient treatment , ( b ) tumor sample futility analysis end study . The central laboratory pathologist responsible ( ) approve patient inclusion basis investigative site pathology report provide screening , ( b ) analyze tumor biopsy ( initial diagnosis and/or relapse ) confirm AITL diagnosis , ( c ) analyze blood sample identify plasma biomarkers extract DNA . Tumor sample ( initial diagnosis relapse ) require central review confirm AITL diagnosis approve inclusion . Archived tissue sample representative tumor must send central review biomarker analysis . If diagnosis biopsy available ( patient diagnose another site , example ) , recent representative biopsy ( relapse and/or progression ) use . Submitting , however , strongly recommend .
