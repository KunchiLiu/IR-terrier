	<brief_summary>The purpose study provide expand access ASP2215 subject FLT3-mutated relapse refractory AML FLT3-mutated AML composite complete remission ( CRc ) ( complete remission [ CR ] , complete remission incomplete hematologic recovery [ CRi ] , complete remission incomplete platelet recovery [ CRp ] ) MRD without access comparable alternative therapy .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Expanded Access Study Gilteritinib ( ASP2215 ) Patients With FMS-like Tyrosine Kinase 3 ( FLT3 ) Mutated Relapsed Refractory Acute Myeloid Leukemia ( AML ) FLT3-Mutated AML Complete Remission ( CR ) With Minimal Residual Disease ( MRD )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This treatment protocol conduct phase 3 ASP2215 study ongoing FLT3-mutated AML subject . Subjects enter screen period 2 week prior start treatment . Subjects administer treatment 28-day cycle . Subjects complete visit cycle 1 day 1 , 4 , 8 , 15 ; cycle 2 day 1 , 15 , day 1 cycle thereafter discontinue study . Subjects provide study medication investigator determines subject long receive clinical benefit . An end treatment visit perform within 7 day last dose investigational product ( ASP2215 ) , prior initiation another anticancer therapy , whichever occur early , follow 30-day follow-up .</detailed_description>
