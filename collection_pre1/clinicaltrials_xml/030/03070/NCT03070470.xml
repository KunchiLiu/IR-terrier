	<brief_summary>This study ass whether exposure response analysis electrocardiographic QTc J-Tpeakc interval Phase 1 clinical pharmacology study use confirm drug predominantly block potassium channel encode human ether-à-go-go-related gene ( hERG ) approximately equipotent late sodium and/or calcium block ( `` balance ion channel '' drug ) cause J-Tpeakc prolongation drug predominantly block hERG without late sodium L-type calcium current block ( `` predominant hERG '' drug ) cause QTc prolongation .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>This study ass whether exposure response analysis electrocardiographic QTc J-Tpeakc interval Phase 1 clinical pharmacology study use confirm `` balanced ion channel '' drug cause J-Tpeakc prolongation `` predominant hERG '' drug cause QTc prolongation . This clinical study consist 2 part : 50-subject parallel part ( Part 1 ) 10-subject crossover part ( Part 2 ) . Up 74 healthy subject enrol ( include 14 potential replacement subject ) . Part 1 double-blind , randomize , placebo-controlled , 1 period parallel design assess effect 4 market drug 1 placebo QTc J-Tpeakc interval 50 healthy subject . A parallel design similar single multiple ascend dose ( SAD/MAD ) Phase 1 study use result study drug administer 10 subject , placebo 10 subject , 1 period 3 consecutive day achieve low high drug exposure . Part 2 double-blind , randomize , 2-period crossover design assess effect hERG block ( dofetilide ) versus calcium block ( diltiazem ) QTc J-Tpeakc interval 10 healthy subject Days 1 , 2 , 3 ( Period 1 ) Days 8 , 9 , 10 ( Period 2 ) .</detailed_description>
