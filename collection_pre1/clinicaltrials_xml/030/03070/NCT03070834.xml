	<detailed_description>The risk venous thromboembolism ( VTE ) high trauma patient , secondary tissue injury , venous status immobilization , thrombophilia . As , early initiation VTE prophylaxis essential population . The compete risks life threaten hemorrhage VTE need consider carefully . Potential approach VTE prophylaxis include pharmacologic mean , mechanical device . For patient unable receive pharmacologic VTE prophylaxis , retrievable inferior vena cava filter ( rIVCFs ) may place low molecular weight heparin ( LMWH ) initiate . The need mechanical VTE prophylaxis patient unable receive pharmacologic therapy underscored Geerts colleague ' prospective study trauma patient receive anticoagulation . In study , 58 % 349 trauma patient sustain deep venous thromboses ( DVT ) . [ Geerts et a. , 1994 ] Furthermore , confirm clinically suspect pulmonary embolus ( PE ) identify additional 5 % patient . Importantly , study exclude patient die first 5 day admission . However , high risk VTE occur first 4 day admission many advocate early insertion rIVCF [ Owings et al . 1997 , O'Malley et al . 1990 , Carlin et al . 2002 , Haut et al . 2014 ] . Coincidentally , VTE prophylaxis often withheld pending repeat neurologic image / surgical intervention . Current guideline use rIVCFs contradictory . The Eastern Association Surgery Trauma 's ( EAST ) practice management guideline suggest use rIVCFs advisable `` very-high-risk trauma patient '' . Such patient define receive anticoagulation increase bleed risk sustain injury prevent mobilization : ) severe close head injury ( GCS &lt; 8 ) ii ) incomplete spinal cord injury paraplegia quadriplegia iii ) complex pelvic fracture associate long bone fracture iv ) multiple long bone fracture [ Rogers et al 2002 ] . Contrasting , American College Chest Physicians sate 2012 Guideline , role rIVCFs primary VTE prevention . [ Gould et al . 2012 ] Reflecting lack consensus guideline , practice variability among major trauma centre . In American base survey study 131 Trauma Directors , LMWH prefer method VTE prophylaxis half ( 51 % ) responder , follow intermittent pneumatic compression device ( IPCD , 42 % ) , Foot pump ( 8 % ) Low Dose Heparin ( LDH , 7 % ) rIVCFs ( 1 % ) . In patient contraindication pharmacologic prophylaxis , favour approach VTE Prophylaxis IPCD ( 80 % ) follow rIVCF ( 16 % ) foot pump ( 9 % ) . [ Knudson et al . 2004 ] More work need improve understand optimal role rIVCFs , particularly consider recent advance , physician experience rIVCF technology . One cite concern use rIVCF trauma patient low report retrieval rate range 21-35 % patient . [ Kirilcuk et al . 2005 , Antevil et al . 2006 , Karmy-Jones et al. , 2007 ] The need VTE prophylaxis trauma patient usually temporary , long term filter use associate increase VTE risk , demonstrate PREPIC-1 trial 8-year follow study examine use permanent IVCF non-trauma patient DVT PE prevention [ Decousus et al . 1998 , PREPIC Study Group , 2005 ] . Of note , trial examine role rIVCF patient secondary prophylaxis risk patient know VTE disease . The low retrieval rate rIVCFs report Unites States problem Canadian Lead Trauma Centre . We recently demonstrate 97 % retrieval rate trauma patient survive discharge . [ Leeper et al . 2015 ] We advocate trial early rIVCF use follow prompt removal medical prophylaxis safe . There paucity data regard use rIVCFs Canadian setting , group currently survey Canadian trauma director improve understand current practice . Despite current deficiency evidence , many Level 1 North American Trauma centre use rIVCF primary VTE prophylaxis risk trauma patient , per EAST guideline . In recent meta-analysis Haut et al . review 8 study , identify reduction PE incidence rIVCF use , conclude study require . [ Haut et al . 2014 ] The investigator propose feasibility study determine whether center insert rIVCFs at-risk trauma patient expeditiously enough cause meaningful reduction time leave unprotected PE .</detailed_description>
