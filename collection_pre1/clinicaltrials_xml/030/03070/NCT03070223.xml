	<brief_summary>Aging HIV may relate early development frailty ( weakness ) disability , include difficulty test strength walk speed . Few treatment show prevent slow impairment people without HIV . Some study suggest class drug call statin ( example , pitavastatin ) might helpful slow frailty disability . This might happen decrease fat within muscle decrease inflammation marker ( substance blood determine body react infection irritation ) blood . Other study show statin increase risk muscle ache pain . This substudy do determine impact drug pitavastatin muscle .</brief_summary>
