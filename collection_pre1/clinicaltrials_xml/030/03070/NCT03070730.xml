	<brief_summary>The purpose study test hypothesis patient non-neuropathic POTS different responsiveness patient neuropathic POTS direct alpha-1 adrenoreceptor agonist therapy ( droxidopa ) non-selective beta-adrenoreceptor antagonist therapy ( atenolol ) . The specific goal protocol investigate effect atenolol droxidopa cardiovascular autonomic function cardiovagal control , sympathetic nerve activity , sympathetic vascular transduction , systemic hemodynamic response orthostatic stress quality life neuropathic non-neuropathic patient postural tachycardia syndrome ( POTS ) . Standardized test use assess cardiovagal control function , sympathetic nerve activity , sympathetic vascular transduction , systemic hemodynamic response head-up tilt test standardize questionnaire assess quality life patient POTS . The cardiovagal , sympathetic hemodynamic measurement perform drug administration . To control effect medication placebo use separate test visit . The order drug placebo randomize .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The pathophysiological basis postural tachycardia syndrome ( POTS ) well elucidate . The widely recognize primary cause POTS `` restrict '' `` selective '' peripheral neuropathy - neuropathic POTS . Several line evidence point restrict peripheral neuropathy , specifically sympathetic denervation lower hemibody , cause POTS . These include venous denervation , impaired distal sudomotor dysfunction , low norepinephrine spillover legs arm . However , POTS patient peripheral neuropathy . Proposed pathogenic etiology non-neuropathic POTS include deconditioning , low-grade inflammation oxidative stress . Neuropathic POTS present 33 % patient non-neuropathic POTS present 67 % patient . The frequent neuropathic feature neuropathic POTS group decrease sweat output measure quantitative sudomotor axon reflex test . Headache gastrointestinal symptom ( abdominal pain , bloating , nausea constipation ) also prevalent neuropathic non-neuropathic POTS group , suggest global difference two population . In relation ambiguous pathophysiological basis , definitive treatment POTS . There report improvement hemodynamic measure symptom orthostatic tolerance pharmacologic agent include intravenous saline , intravenous phenylephrine , midodrine , octreotide , erythropoietin , pyridostigmine , betablockade . The therapy however frequently disappointing . Furthermore , report long-term study medication treat POTS report effect intervention fatigue quality life . The widely use agent treat POTS , alpha-adrenoreceptor agonist midodrine , beta blocker , paradoxically agonistic antagonistic effect autonomic nervous system . Responses drug inconsistent delineate predictor response POTS patient . The comparison therapeutic intervention protocol base rationale alpha-adrenoreceptor agonist think effective neuropathic POTS - disorder characterize compensatory increase sympathetic outflow sympatholysis may counterproductive , beta-adrenoreceptor antagonist think effective non-neuropathic POTS - disorder could characterize increased central sympathetic outflow due impair sympathetic inhibition . This protocol use droxidopa , convert direct adrenoreceptor agonist , norepinephrine . The protocol also use beta-adrenoreceptor antagonist , non-selective atenolol . This randomized , double-blind , placebo-controlled , cross-over experimental study three trial arm , accord two medication ( droxidopa atenolol ) placebo . The trial perform Center Autonomic Peripheral Nerve Disorders Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center . The study consist 10 visit : - screen visit , - test day define drug sensitivity - classification day - autonomic test visit - follow-up visit Screening visit ( Visit 1 ) include - Consenting procedure - Review medical history - Review current medication , prescription counter - Physical neurological examination - Measure height , weight , temperature vital sign - 12-lead ECG - Baseline autonomic test - Blood lab - Serum pregnancy test woman childbearing potential - Patients able take PO medication Drug Sensitivity Visit ( Visit 2 3 ) On first visit , patient receive one 100 mg droxidopa second visit patient receive one 300 mg test dose droxidopa define response drug . The drug administration precede followed heart rate blood pressure measurement side effect monitoring . The two consecutive visit make within period 3 day . The goal sensitivity visit determine patient sign denervation supersensitivity response droxidopa . The patient consider denervation supersensitivity systolic blood pressure great 180 mmHg diastolic blood pressure great 110 mmHg 3 minute stand 5 minute sit patient unable tolerate side effect believe related drug . Patient classification visit ( Visit 4 ) include - Quantitative Direct Indirect test Sudomotor Function ( QDIRT ) - Quantitative Sudomotor Axon Reflex Testing ( QSART ) - Quantitative Sensory Testing ( QST ) - Punch skin biopsy - Questionnaires ( Chronic Fatigue Screening Form , Fatigue Severity Scale , Chalder Fatigue Questionnaire , etc. , see Questionnaires section ) Autonomic Evaluation Visits ( Visit 5 , 7 9 ) include - Urine pregnancy test woman child-bearing potential - Setup instrumentation - Blood draw hormone catecholamine ( Visit 5 ) - Microneurography procedure - Drug/placebo administration - Deep breathing test - Paced breathing test - Modified Oxford test - Sympathetic transduction - Static exercise - Tilt table test Primary outcome measure autonomic evaluation visit maximum postural tachycardia secondary outcome measure autonomic evaluation visit blood pressure , heart rate , vascular resistance , muscle sympathetic nerve activity . Follow-up test visit ( Visit 6 , 8 10 ) include - Medical history - Physical examination - Vital sign - EKG - Blood pressure measurement - Tilt table test Primary outcome measure follow-up test visit fatigue score Chalder Fatigue questionnaire secondary outcome measure follow-up test visit score physical function subscale SF-36 questionnaire , 7 item patient global impression change , Hospital Anxiety Depression Scales , Checklist Individual Strength ( CIS ) , Multidimensional Fatigue Inventory ( MFI ) , Fatigue Severity Scale , EuroQOL , HADS anxiety score . The Orthostatic Intolerance Questionnaire - unique validate questionnaire use assess orthostatic intolerance symptom quality life-related orthostatic intolerance .</detailed_description>
