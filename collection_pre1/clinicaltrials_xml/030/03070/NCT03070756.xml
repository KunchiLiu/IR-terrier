	<brief_summary>This study implement extend ( post mark ) examination efficacy proactive auto-CPAP algorithm , base forced oscillation technique ( FOT ) sample patient predominantly obstructive sleep apnea . The auto-CPAP algorithm examine study implement medical device prisma20A prismaLAB ( LÃ¶wenstein Medical Technology ) .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Extended Evaluation Efficacy Proactive FOT-based Auto-CPAP Algorithm</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Patients diagnose obstructive sleep apnea comply inclusion criterion study inform possibility participation . Following informed write consent , participant undergo PSG-diagnostic night accord clinical routine , follow auto-CPAP treatment night prismaLINE device ( prismaLAB prisma20A ) . The device setting apply treatment night define study protocol ( see intervention ) . Following auto-CPAP treatment night , study participation complete . Any following treatment patient care administer accord clinical routine . Primary secondary outcome measure sleep stage respiratory event index evaluate diagnostic night auto-CPAP treatment night . The enrollment consist two phase . During phase 1 ( train phase ) 10 participant enrol complete study protocol . Phase 1 serf train phase establish common standard data quality acquisition . Data training phase include statistical analysis . Following train phase efficacy auto-CPAP algorithm evaluate sample 54 participant .</detailed_description>
