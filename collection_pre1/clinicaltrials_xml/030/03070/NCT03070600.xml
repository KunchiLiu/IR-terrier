	<brief_summary>In region 15-20 % HIV prevalence , estimate 20 % HIV-uninfected woman could HIV exposure pregnancy . In theoretical scenario perfect PrEP coverage , woman risk receive PrEP woman HIV risk receive PrEP ( Figure 4 ) . With mandatory PrEP give woman ( similar approach use malaria prophylaxis ) , woman risk would cover many woman risk receive unnecessary PrEP . Our premise target PrEP model may closer perfect coverage universal offer/self-select model . Implementing target PrEP strategy include facilitation partner test self-tests could add HIV prevention benefit increase partner HIV diagnosis treatment similar initiation PrEP among pregnant woman . By implement strategy measure uptake , process , HIV incidence , inform best health system model PrEP delivery pregnancy .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Women live region high HIV prevalence high risk HIV acquisition pregnancy postpartum infrequently use condom , know partner 's HIV status , biologic change change partner 's sexual partnership increase susceptibility . Oral pre-exposure antiretroviral prophylaxis ( PrEP ) may attractive strategy HIV prevention pregnancy/postpartum ; however , important ensure PrEP reach woman risk acquire HIV pregnancy avoid unnecessary PrEP use pregnancy . Clinicians woman use PrEP pregnancy ; qualitative study , woman , health worker policy-makers support use PrEP pregnancy advocate model PrEP delivery ensure woman risk receive PrEP minimize unnecessary PrEP use woman risk . Targeting PrEP woman great risk HIV may maximize benefit , minimize potential risk , optimize cost-effectiveness . This cluster-randomized clinical trial ( RCT ) 20 Maternal Child Health ( MCH ) clinic western Kenya ( 10 clinic per arm , 200 woman per clinic , 4000 woman overall ) , compare 2 model PrEP delivery pregnancy . Clinics offer universal availability PrEP ( woman self-select whether use ) target offer PrEP ( i.e. , offer woman identify high risk standardize risk assessment partner self-testing , woman identify high-risk select whether use ) . Leveraging pre-existing MCH clinic visit schedule enable programmatically relevant assessment PrEP uptake , use , HIV incidence . The outcome study model PrEP delivery pregnancy optimize effectiveness , safety , cost-effectiveness . Our team expertise maternal-child HIV ( John-Stewart , Kinuthia ) , PrEP clinical trial implementation science ( Baeten , Richardson ) , partner self-testing ( Thirumurthy ) , economics qualitative research ( Barnabas , O'Malley ) . AIM 1a . In cluster-RCT , compare universal PrEP ( offer ; woman self-select PrEP ) target PrEP ( limit offer woman identify high risk standardize risk assessment partner self-testing ) outcomes reflect balance PrEP effectiveness avoid unnecessary PrEP exposure woman low risk HIV : HIV incidence 9 month postpartum among woman ( include receive PrEP ) proportion woman expose PrEP . AIM 1b . To compare trial arm proportion woman 'appropriately ' PrEP ( risk factor ) , PrEP adherence ( drug level ) duration , partner know HIV status , partner ART ; infant outcome ( growth , birth outcome , HIV status ) . AIM 2 . To estimate incremental cost-effectiveness target PrEP compare universal PrEP woman pregnancy postpartum , per HIV infection disability-adjusted life-year ( DALY ) avert . AIM 3 . To qualitatively assess barrier facilitator uptake , adherence , acceptability , feasibility universal target PrEP model organizational , provider , individual woman level .</detailed_description>
