	<brief_title>Safety Efficacy IMCgp100 Versus Investigator Choice Advanced Uveal Melanoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This Phase II study design evaluate safety efficacy IMCgp100 compare Investigator 's Choice ( dacarbazine , ipilimumab pembrolizumab ) HLA-A*0201 positive adult patient advance UM treat first line set prior systemic liver-directed chemo- , radio- immune-therapy administer advanced setting ( prior surgical resection liver metastases adjuvant systemic therapy acceptable ) . Comparison IMCgp100 efficacy result Phase II study make concurrently randomize arm ( Investigator 's Choice ) primary endpoint overall survival ( OS ) secondary efficacy endpoint progression-free survival ( PFS ) , objective response rate ( ORR ) , duration response ( DOR ) , disease control rate ( DCR ) .</detailed_description>
