If FM approach successful , impact diabetes disease burden well diabetes-associated health care cost could significant .

	<brief_title>Diabetes : Functional Medicine Approach vs. Usual Care</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This prospective , randomize , control , open-label clinical trial 1:1 randomization patient diabetes insulin less 5 year receive either Functional Medicine care addition usual care continue usual care deliver endocrinologist . The total number patient plan enrollment 90 , 45 arm . Patient recruitment begin Cleveland Clinic main campus Endocrinology clinic may later include Endocrinology practice Cleveland Clinic Health System sit . Following voluntary informed consent , study subject complete screening/baseline visit . After visit , patient randomize continue usual care deliver endocrinologists FM plus usual care . Once randomization occurs , patient continue remain care endocrinologist usual physician . If randomize FM plus usual care group , subject receive additional care functional medicine physician . A stratified randomization procedure use allocate patient two group accord stratum : Total Daily Insulin dose &lt; = 50 unit vs. &gt; 50 unit . All subject : In addition usual care provide endocrinologist , study visit occur screening/baseline , 6 month , 12 month 24 month . Lab data/Biometrics ( record within 1 month time frame ) obtain time . Quality life instrument ( Diabetes Distress Scale , SPADE , PHQ-9 MSQ ; Appendices D , E , F G ) also administer . At baseline , 12 month visit , 24 month visit , Body Fat Analysis Bioelectrical impedance analysis ( BIA ) perform . There also 10 cc blood collect plasma serum sample well 10 cc urine approximately 1 gram stool bio repository patient agree provide sample . Usual care subject : Subjects randomize usual care arm receive nutritional education session . FM plus usual care subject : Subjects randomize FM plus usual care arm evaluate use functional medicine approach diabetes outline Functional Medicine Diagnostic Treatment Approach Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus Cardio-Metabolic Syndrome . Subjects randomized FM plus usual care arm also receive nutrition therapy dietary supplement . These prescribe monitor Functional Medicine study visit . An estimated total 50ml blood collect subject arm study designate visit . In addition , subject may ask provide urine stool sample . Functional Medicine lab use part determine supplement recommend .</detailed_description>
