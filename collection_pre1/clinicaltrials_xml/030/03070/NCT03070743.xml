	<detailed_description>Basilar invagination ( BI ) refer skull base direction cervical spine , mainly odontoid process foramen magnum major change congenital cranial vertebral junction malformation . Different trauma inflammatory lesion , exist horizontal also vertical direction dislocation atlas axis，At present satisfactory widely accept operation method . At present , main treatment strategy adopt skull traction patient preoperative intraoperative make vertebra X-ray observation . If skull traction restore atlanto-axial dislocation , This case belong restorable atlanto-axial dislocation . If skull traction restore dislocation , non-restorable atlanto-axial dislocation . For restorable type , posterior occipital cervical internal fixation fusion perform . For non restorable case , main theory various ligament scar form anterior arch atlas odontoid process lead cause longitudinal traction , transoral anterior atlanto-axial joint lysis need first , adopt posterior occipital-cervical internal fixation interbody fusion atlanto-axial dislocation restore . Because anterior trans-oral atlanto-axial joint lysis weakness difficult high risk , limit popularization treatment atlanto-axial dislocation . Currently several spinal surgery center ability carry . Another problem treatment strategy function posterior operation confine occipital-cervical fixation situ consider try adopt posterior open reduction , mainly due current clinical application occipital cervical posterior fixation system lack pressure reduction effect . Abumi propose posterior operation incision , atlanto-axial restore intraoperative technique 1999 , design first compression screw restore function operation . But n't widely use intraoperative reposition internal fixation instrument design reasonable restore technique lot deficiency In 2006 Wangchao report another posterior atlanto-axial dislocation reduction technology . The restore direction technology reasonable Abumi 's , occipital titanium plate adopt kind restore technique still evolve occipital-cervical internal fixation system design Abumi , mechanical property restore level atlanto-axial dislocation . atlanto-axial dislocation cause Basilar invagination still need adopt restore skull traction . And many case also need perform anterior transoral atlanto-axial joint lysis order achieve expect reduction effect . Wangchao adopt occipital-cervical internal fixation system Abumi technique perform pressure reduction atlanto-axial dislocation . This technology reasonable press direction . Using occipital-cervical internal fixation system Abumi technique n't function Distraction reduction . Therefore vertical dislocation atlanto-axial Still need restore skull traction , patient need anterior transoral atlanto-axial joint lysis restore traction . In 2010 member project group report atlanto-axial dislocation restore simple posterior screw internal fixation technique achieve effect . The investigator restore vertical dislocation atlanto-axial effectively apply distraction force occipital screw axis pedicle screw . For Basilar Invagination ( BI ) complicate Atlanto-axial dislocation ( AAD ) , rate Atlanto-axial reduction100 % reach 65 % . But due use internal fixation system ordinary occipital cervical internal fixation system （Summit system，DePuy Co ) lack function pressure reduction , therefore effect level reduction atlanto-axial dislocation poor . In case induct atlanto-axial joint rearward open angle increase , odontoid fall backwards aggregately , medulla spinal cord angle narrow further.Furthermore , Part reason atlanto occipital complex malformation patient fail achieve 100 % reduction atlanto-axial lateral deformity seriously , utual locking , difficulty restore technology . The technology divide intraoperative reduction process two operating . First , restore level dislocation atlanto-axial pressure , restore vertical dislocation atlanto-axial distraction . The investigator design compression occipital plate ( COP ) own function compression distraction reduction order make convenient intraoperative technical operation . The investigation report Patent Bureau indicate design type titanium plate creative novel . The clinical application technique achieve initial success treatment basilar invagination complicate atlanto-axial dislocation patient . This technology far reasonable posterior reduction technology treatment basilar invagination complicate atlanto-axial dislocation mechanic mechanism . Although compression distraction reduction technology obvious advantage analyze mechanical property angle application pressurize occipital titanium plate , application technology safely effective cure basilar invagination atlanto-axial dislocation patient , improve neurological function , still need prospective clinical study .</detailed_description>
