	<brief_title>What 's Happen Under Calcification Process Pseudoxanthoma Elasticum</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Pseudoxanthoma elasticum ( PXE ; OMIM 264800 ) , autosomal recessive metabolic disorder characterize fragmentation progressive calcification elastic fiber ( elastorrhexis ) connective tissue skin , Bruch 's membrane retina vascular system . PXE cause mutation ABCC6 ( ATP-binding cassette subfamily C member 6 ) gene , locate short arm chromosome 16 , encode transmembrane ATP bind anion transporter normally express liver kidney . The pathophysiology PXE , particularly mechanism ectopic mineralization , remain largely unknown . PXE currently intractable disease , associate considerable morbidity occasional mortality due cardiovascular complication . The major symptom disease characterize unaesthetic skin fold , central blindness cardiovascular complication early severe peripheral arterial disease ( PAD ) complication young age normal population . Unfortunately , histological study limit availability arterial tissue patient show calcium deposition medium layer large ( i.e . aorta , carotids femoral ) medium size vessel ( i.e . radial ankle artery ) ( ref ) . However , underlie pathophysiology arterial calcification PXE remain incompletely define , currently effective medical treatment capable alter course . No longitudinal study perform explain calcification process PXE . As PXE systemic metabolic disease , low grade inflammation could trigger deregulate inflammation resolution process result calcification . Thus , alternative technique therefore required investigate pathogenesis progression condition . Positron emission tomography ( PET ) combine compute tomography ( CT ) noninvasive imaging technique allow identification quantification specific biochemical process within small anatomic structure , vascular wall . Furthermore , 2 common PET tracer target calcification inflammation , believe play key role development disease . 18F Flurodeoxyglucose ( 18F-FDG ) glucose analogue take cell glucose transport proteins enters glycolytic metabolic pathway . After initial hexokinase step , 18F-FDG-6-phosphate metabolize becomes trap within cell high metabolic requirement , macrophage . PET image use 18F-FDG become establish mean quantify vascular inflammation aorta carotid artery , correlate plaque macrophage burden symptomatic status . 18F-Sodium fluoride ( 18FNaF ) alternative PET tracer directly incorporate expose bone crystal ( hydroxyapatite ) via exchange mechanism hydroxyl group . It therefore think detect area novel calcification region calcium remodel use clinically detection primary osteoblastic tumor bone metastasis . More recently , study describe 18F-NaF uptake marker calcification within atherosclerotic plaque . More recently , calcify process examine 4 PXE patient use 18NaF PET/CT show femoral artery , increase arterial wall 18NaF signal level similar cortical bone . However , mechanism responsible increase osteoblastic activity lead arterial wall calcification PXE remain unknown . In study , investigate 18F-NaF 18F-FDG uptake arterial wall skin patient PXE 3 major aim : : 1 . Does low grade inflammation vascular wall skin exist PXE patient specificity site might exist ? 2 . Does low grade inflammation vascular wall skin quantify 18F-FDG preceed molecular calcification process quantify 18F-NaF ? 3 . Does low grade inflammation bone turn correlate conversely calcium score ?</detailed_description>
