	<brief_summary>A clinical decision support rule/tool classification TIA/mimic enable rapid detection ACVS hyper-acute setting develop . Also development multi-protein test use mass spectrometry ( MS ) . This test provide TIA result within hour two fraction price neuroimaging . With guidance provide test disposal , physician inform patient whether go home safely whether need test . The right patient receive right treatment , reduce unwarranted imaging risk cost , reduce burden stroke . The Heart Stroke Foundation work ensure physician , ally healthcare provider , public stakeholder aware outcomes clinical impact project . Further , work do establish mechanism develop strong phenotype TIA include medical imaging ( MRI ) , cardiac monitoring , cognitive assessment , surveillance health outcome extend period time .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>SpecTRA ; A Study Validation Protein Biomarkers Transient Ischemic Attack</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Patients fulfill inclusion none exclusion criterion give informed consent enrol Validation study . At enrollment , patient receive stroke nurse assessment Emergency Department ( ED ) clinical information document ACVS Assessment Form/SpecTRA Case Report Form . Patients provide 6 mL blood draw purple-top EDTA tube process proteomic analysis . These blood draw may may occur standard-of-care blood draw ED stroke unit . Clinical order include medical imaging ( MRI +/- CT/CTA ) , cardiac monitoring ( 24hr +/- extended event monitoring ) . Patients refer attend ED physician stroke clinic neurological consultation within 48 hour - 7 day , whereby diagnosis ( ) possible ACVS ; ( ii ) definite ACVS ( iii ) mimic make . At stroke clinic cognitive screen test administer either part usual clinical care treat physician , nurse , study coordinator . A re- assessment repeat 90 day phone . MRI review initially clinical interpretation neurological consultation evidence brain ischemia ( DWI+ ) later neuro-radiologists definitive diagnosis study purpose . Final adjudication TIA aetiology do non-blinded principal investigator site base diagnostic result plus 90-day 2-year outcome .</detailed_description>
