	<brief_title>Stereotactic Radiotherapy Combined With Chemotherapy Not Treatment Oligometastases HNSCC</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Patients cancer aerodigestive tract metastasis limited evolution pauci-metastatic disease . In case , systemic therapy standard attitude . However , patient often receive chemotherapy history response rate relatively low . The median survival 7 11 month secondary effect degradation quality life . It palliative treatment . Data systemic treatment context micro-metastatic disease limit . In contrast , stereotactic irradiation pauci-metastatic context lead well local control rate may sustainedly reduce progression metastatic disease . Stereotactic radiotherapy increase use clinical practice limit metastatic stage ( oligo metastatic 1-3 synchronized metastasis ) . Radiotherapy indication major advantage similar efficacy compare ablative treatment .</detailed_description>
