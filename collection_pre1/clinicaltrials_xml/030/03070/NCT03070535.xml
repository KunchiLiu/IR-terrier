	<brief_summary>This study involve collection cognitive biomarker response HIGH LOW meal healthy old adult without APOE E4 genotype . Subjects eat meal overnight fast , follow cognitive testing , spinal fluid blood collection . The HIGH meal meal high saturate fat high glycemic index food vs. LOW meal low saturate fat low glycemic index food .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>APOE Genotype Diet Influences Alzheimer 's Biomarkers</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The purpose study examine risk gene Alzheimer 's disease APOE epsilon 4 ( E4 ) influence acute cognitive response different type meal . The rationale study know diet high saturate fat high glycemic index food ( HIGH diet ) risk factor Alzheimer 's disease ( AD ) . However find paradoxically Western style HIGH diet acutely improve cognition APOE E4 carrier , worsen cognition E4 non-carriers . This experiment examine mechanism underlie differential response E4 carriers non-carriers . We enroll old adult dementia , half E4 carriers half non-carriers . Both group contain equal number men woman . These individual undergo two experiment eat either high low fat meal , meal undergo several test . The outcome measure include blood measure metabolic marker , cognitive test know sensitive change even single meal , spinal fluid measure Alzheimer 's biomarkers beta-amyloid , well spinal fluid level lipid , glucose insulin . This study allow u test whether high low fat meal acutely affect cognitive Alzheimer 's biomarkers , change depend APOE genotype gender . It hope work contribute broad understanding risk diet AD , help u understand prevent treat devastate neurological disease .</detailed_description>
