	<detailed_description>This multicenter , multinational , randomize , 3-arm , double-blind , phase II clinical study 2400mg Mesalamine , 1200mg Mesalamine placebo LS patient 2-year treatment . 540 tumor free carrier know genetic mutation major MMR gene ( include patient polyps endoscopically remove ) randomize 1:1:1 ( 180 ) receive 2400mg Mesalamine , 1200mg Mesalamine placebo . Patients identify local national registry collaboration site . Tumor free patient , assessed white light high resolution colonoscopy , randomize study . A serum stool sample take identify Mesalamine compliance potential biomarkers . Biopsies normal tissue ascend colon rectum take first last colonoscopy . The aim study investigate effect regular treatment Mesalamine occurrence colonic neoplasia , tumor multiplicity ( number detect adenomas/carcinomas ) tumor progression LS patient . A 50 % reduction occurrence neoplasia Mesalamine-treated patient expect . Tumor multiplicity tumor progression ( severity neoplastic lesion ) investigate .</detailed_description>
