	<brief_title>Preoperative Loading With Carbohydrates Lung Cancer Surgery</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Fasting 6-12hours elective surgery still standard care many departements , include departement Oslo University Hospital . Surgery trauma trigger catabolic stress response high emission hormone immune activation . These activation affect brain , heart , muscle liver . The metabolic change may addition influence development pain , tissue damage , ileus , tachycardia hemodynamic disturbance . Preoperative fast show increase surgical stress impact catabolic process secondarily may lead insulin resistance hyperglycemia non-diabetic patient . Insulin resistance hyperglycaemia know increase incidence postoperative infection . Previous study also show prolonged fasting increase incidence gastrointestinal problem . A 12 hour fast surgery show delayed recovery . Studies show patient undergo lung cancer surgery suffer multiple symptom experience discomfort postoperative phase . Symptoms include dyspnea , fatigue , pain , weakness , cough , dry mouth , nervousness , difficulty sleeping , stomach-/intestinal-problems lack appetite . Carbohydrate-rich supplement show positive effect perioperative symptom measure , knowledge currently investigate lung cancer surgery . Therefore , need explore possible advantage preoperative oral carbohydrate loading lung cancer surgery . The primary aim study investigate whether preoperative carbohydrate load PreOp® provide less postoperative discomfort early postoperative phase measure Quality Recovery-40 ( QoR-40 ) , validate widely use measure quality recovery . The secondary aim investigate preoperative loading carbohydrate affect incidence postoperative complication stomach-/intestinal problem heart rhythm disorder , addition contribute faster mobilization reduce hospital length stay . This study may provide important data regard lung cancer patient perioperative symptom , complication well-being use carbohydrate-rich supplement intervention standard care . In study , intervention group give 800ml oral carbohydrate supplement , PreOp® , night surgery 400ml supplement , PreOp® , 2-4 hour prior surgery . The control group fast 24h , night surgery , accordance departements standard care . Both group , interventional control group , follow department 's perioperative course regard anesthetic surgical procedure .</detailed_description>
