	<brief_summary>This randomized phase II/III trial study docetaxel , antiandrogen therapy , radiation therapy see well work compare antiandrogen therapy radiation therapy alone treat patient prostate cancer remove surgery . Androgen cause growth prostate cell . Antihormone therapy may lessen amount androgen make body . Radiation therapy use high energy x-ray kill tumor cell shrink tumor . Drugs use chemotherapy , docetaxel , work different way stop growth tumor cell , either kill cell , stop dividing , stop spread . Giving antiandrogen therapy radiation therapy without docetaxel surgery may kill remain tumor cell .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Antiandrogen Therapy Radiation Therapy With Without Docetaxel Treating Patients With Prostate Cancer That Has Been Removed Surgery</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To assess benefit docetaxel measure improvement freedom progression ( phase II ) subsequently metastasis free survival ( phase III ) give combination radiation androgen deprivation treatment high risk prostate cancer post-radical prostatectomy . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . To assess overall survival . II . To assess local time progression . III . To assess undetectable prostate-specific antigen ( PSA ) non-castrate testosterone 2.5 year post treatment . IV . To assess utility genomic profiling make adjuvant therapy decision post-prostatectomy . V. To assess toxicity docetaxel post-operative setting combine radiation androgen deprivation therapy . VI . To assess treatment response genomically define sub-groups prostate cancer patient . OUTLINE : Patients randomize 1 2 arm . ARM I : Patients receive androgen deprivation therapy comprise leuprolide acetate , goserelin acetate , bicalutamide , flutamide , nilutamide 6 month . Beginning 8 week start androgen deprivation therapy , patient receive external beam radiation therapy ( EBRT ) 7.5 week . ARM II : Patients receive androgen deprivation therapy EBRT Arm I . Within 4-6 week completion radiation therapy , patient receive docetaxel intravenously ( IV ) day 1 every 21 day 6 course absence disease progression unexpected toxicity . After completion study treatment , patient follow every 3 month 2 year , every 6 month 3 year , yearly .</detailed_description>
