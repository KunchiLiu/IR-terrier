	<brief_summary>Key research question This project address follow key research question : What short long term effect child family outcome universal intervention deliver Health Visitor address newbornÂ´s behavior share observation parent ( NBO ) ? The aim enhance parent 's sensitivity infant ' unique capacity thereby create early parental understand individual infant 's strength well need . Hypothesis concern main outcome Universal Health Visiting facilitation early relationship building introduce NBO intervention group new family will- compare control group new family receive health visitor support usual : - Improve sensitive responsive parenting infant 's behavior , need feed comfort , rise understanding parental influence infant ' self-regulatory capacity - Increase parental confidence reduce experience stress symptom depression among new mother father - Improve infant 's self-regulatory capacity regard sleep , cry , feed engage social interaction , cooperative - Enhance sensitive early parent/infant relationship - Improve exclusive breastfeeding duration delay introduction solid food Method The project form community base randomized trial . The complexity community base intervention research existence two target group , case : 1 ) primary study population new parent receive supportive intervention 2 ) secondary study population Health Visitors deliver supportive intervention . The complication catch effect universal approach address variety outcome capture aspect development infant , mother father interaction . Recruitment randomization Four medium-sized municipality join trial . To avoid side-effects district Health Visitors participate municipality regard cluster . Because difference size social status inhabitant district alias cluster , cluster stratify randomize intervention comparison group . The randomization procedure computer base conducted independent person involve study . Study population The primary study population form new family , mother father infant/s . Substantiated operate community base universal intervention side effect seek measure effect natural population exclusion criterion except parent infant affiliate special treatment elsewhere . In study population new parent subgroup : First time parent represent around 40 % , around 6 % give premature birth , 2 % twin birth , 10-14 % mother 7-8 % father suffer birth depression postnatal period , 7-20 % cultural background Danish depend geographical area . A random sample 100 mother receive intervention draw video record middle project period specify characteristic criterion regard first-time- , depressed- give premature birth . Afterwards match group 100 mother select comparison group . Data data-collection Data collect two source : ( 1 ) self-reported data new parent collect via questionnaire ; ( 2 ) observational data video recording , Infant CARE-Index . Questionnaire data deliver collect though internet base system . Participating mother father receive separate questionnaire 1-2 week postpartum ( baseline data ) , 3 month postpartum , 9 month follow-up , 18 month follow-up . Videos record 3 month post-partum ( correct age premature infant ) 3 minute unstructured time together ; ( Infant CARE Index ) . All data link via Danish Personal Register ( CPR ) identifier . To minimize bias introduce data collection , data collect way time intervention comparison group . Data Analysis Intention treat analysis use detect effect community base intervention motivation participation may vary primary secondary study population .
