	<brief_title>Exercise Intervention Among Men With Prostate Cancer Initiating Androgen Deprivation Therapy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Androgen deprivation therapy ( ADT ) key treatment prostate cancer . While therapy improve prostate cancer outcome , ADT also variety short- long-term adverse effect , include increase body weight , loss lean muscle mass , reduction quality life , increase risk cardiovascular disease . Studies show among men prostate cancer , physical activity associate improved outcome , include reduce risk mortality , prostate cancer cause . Our hypothesis physical activity improve physical emotional side effect associate ADT . Physical activity , brisk walk moderate strength training , offer lifestyle factor may improve side effect , low-cost easy . The investigator conduct study evaluate impact feasibility 12-week moderate-intensity aerobic strength training exercise intervention , include virtual component . The intervention include brisk walk moderate strength training , involve home-based exercise , in-person session oncology-trained exercise physiologist , optional group training session , weekly training goal . Participants access personalize web-based platform call Postwire , include videos training session , allow participant easily communicate study staff study participant .</detailed_description>
