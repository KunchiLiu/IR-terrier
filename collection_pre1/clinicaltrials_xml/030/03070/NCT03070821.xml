	<brief_summary>The project aim investigate patient Alzheimer 's disease prodromal state ( early state disease ) compare healthy subject whether neurofeedback train functional MRI ( fMRI ) improve cognitive ability . It interest voluntary modulation brain activation real-time ( rt ) fMRI novel method affect cognitive ability , well functional structural measure brain . Over course study subject learn real-world footpath . During neurofeedback training subject ask recall footpath simultaneously try modulate brain activation base feedback . Feedback give parahippocampal gyrus - region brain associate episodic visuo-spatial memory , know affect early Alzheimer 's disease pathology . Before train cognitive ability assess use neuropsychological test mainly measure numerous domain memory . The investigator hypothesise train lead improvement train cognitive domain , also induce change brain structure function .</brief_summary>
