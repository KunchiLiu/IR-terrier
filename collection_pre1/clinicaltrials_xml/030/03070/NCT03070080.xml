	<brief_summary>Fluid administration surgery essential part postoperative care maintain patient ' fluid biochemical balance . Abdominal surgical procedure associate dehydration preoperative fasting , bowel preparation , intra- postoperative fluid electrolyte loss . So , perioperative fluid management topic much debate year intensify especially past several year .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Restrictive Versus Conservative Fluid Therapy Colorectal Surgery</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The controversy include type fluid , time administration volume administrate . Following much discussion ongoing controversy colloid versus crystalloids ideal composition various intravenous solution , main focus recently volume fluid . Fluid therapy strategy develop implemented clinical practice several decade . The data suggest aggressive liberal intraoperative fluid resuscitation harmful open abdominal operation , whereas restrictive fluid protocol well outcome , include few postoperative complication shorter discharge time . However , restrictive fluid regimen several limitation . Overly restricted inadequate fluid administration may lead insufficient intravascular volume , tissue hypoperfusion , cellular oxygenation impairment potential organ dysfunction , prolonged recovery bowel function , impair tissue oxygenation , might ultimately impair wound heal include heal anastomosis . Recently , pleth-variability index ( PVI ) derive respiratory variation peripheral perfusion index ( PI ) suggest effective dynamic indicator fluid responsiveness . Different invasive dynamic index , PVI provide clinician numerical value obtain non-invasively . PVI calculate [ ( PI max - PI min ) /PI max ] X 100 , PI max PI min represent maximal minimal value , respectively , plethysmographic perfusion index ( PI ) one respiratory cycle . PI ratio pulsatile non-pulsatile infrared light absorption pulse oximeter , physiologically equivalent amplitude plethysmographic waveform . A PVI value &gt; 13 % volume expansion discriminate fluid responder non responder 81 % sensitivity 100 % specificity .</detailed_description>
