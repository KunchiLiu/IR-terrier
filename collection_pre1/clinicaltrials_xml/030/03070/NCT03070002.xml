	<brief_summary>The purpose study look amount cancer cell blood participant treat denosumab . The purpose look long take cancer get bad participant treat denosumab . Circulating tumor cell ( CTCs ) blood patient metastatic breast cancer ( MBC ) associate short survival CTCs absent , especially patient whose cancer spread bone . In study , want see denosumab ( study drug ) decrease number CTCs measure patient MBC cancer spread bone . We also plan get blood participant study research marker interest .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Denosumab Treating Patients With ER and/or PR Positive , HER2 Negative Metastatic Breast Cancer With Bone Metastases Detectable Circulating Tumor Cells</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To assess effect denosumab Her2/neu negative ER+ and/or PR+ metastatic breast cancer patient partial response ( PR ) stable disease ( SD ) start systemic therapy bone metastases &gt; = 5 circulate tumor cell ( CTCs ) measure fraction patient reduction CTCs 3 cycle denosumab . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . To assess effect denosumab CTCs enumeration consider continuous variable ( percent change baseline ) population . II . To evaluate median progression-free survival ( m-PFS ) . TERTIARY OBJECTIVES : I. CTC enumeration enrichment . II . To assess effect CTC profile characterization stem cell phenotype ( CTC-EMT ) . III . To evaluate type progressive disease ( new site versus [ vs. ] progression lesion previous site ) . IV . To analyze expression RANKL . OUTLINE : Patients receive denosumab subcutaneously ( SC ) day 1 . Treatment repeat every 28 day 3 course absence disease progression , unexpected toxicity , patient withdrawal death . After completion study treatment , patient follow every 12 week 2 year .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Patients must histologically cytologically confirm ER and/or PR positive , HER2/neu negative metastatic breast cancer ; enrol line therapy without investigational agent stable disease partial response ( determine clinically ) current systemic treatment ; patient must also pathologic OR radiographic evidence bone metastases &gt; = 5 CTCs ; ( Note : pathology report use physician determine diagnosis , use determine patient eligibility ; ER PR status available time registration ) Patients may either measurable nonmeasurable within 30 day registration ; ( lesion treat radiation therapy must use target lesion ) ; ( Note : per Response Evaluation Criteria Solid Tumors [ RECIST ] criterion version [ v. ] 1.1 , measurable disease define least one lesion accurately measure least one dimension ; nonmeasurable disease define lesion , include small lesion [ long diameter &lt; 10 mm pathological lymph node P10 &lt; 15 mm short axis ] well truly nonmeasurable lesion ; lesion consider truly nonmeasurable include : leptomeningeal disease , ascites , pleural pericardial effusion , inflammatory breast disease , lymphangitic involvement skin lung , abdominal masses/abdominal organomegaly identify physical exam measurable reproducible image technique ) Patients may enrol line standard treatment ( without investigational agent ) ; start date current treatment least two 2 week prior registration ; ( Note : patient continue receive plan active treatment chemotherapy endocrine therapy [ standard care ] initiate denosumab recommend dose protocol ) Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group ( ECOG ) performance status 02 Leukocytes &gt; = 3,000/mcL ( without growth factor ) Platelets &gt; = 100,000/mcL ( without transfusion ) Hemoglobin &gt; = 8 ( without transfusion ) Aspartate aminotransferase ( AST ) alanine aminotransferase ( ALT ) ( serum glutamicoxaloacetic transaminase [ SGOT ] serum glutamate pyruvate transaminase [ SGPT ] ) = &lt; 2.5 time institutional upper limit normal ( patient liver metastasis = &lt; 5 time upper limit normal [ ULN ] allow ) Bilirubin = &lt; 1.5 ULN ( patient liver metastasis = &lt; 5 time ULN allow ) Serum creatinine = &lt; 1.5 ULN Creatinine clearance &gt; = 60 mL/min/1.73 m^2 patient creatinine level institutional normal ( creatinine clearance calculate per institutional standard ) Patients must serum calcium &gt; = 2.0 mmol/L ( 8.0 mg/dL ) albuminadjusted serum calcium = &lt; 2.9 mmol/L ( 11.5 mg/dL ) within 30 day registration ; ( Note : patient undergo treatment hypocalcemia serum calcium value screen &gt; 8.0 mg/dl , patient eligible study ) Females childbearing potential ( FOCBP ) males partner must agree use two acceptable method effective contraception , study entry , duration study participation , 5 month follow completion therapy ; subject surgically sterile ( e.g. , history bilateral tubal ligation , hysterectomy ) whose sexual partner sterile ( e.g. , history vasectomy ) require use additional contraceptive measure ; female patient become pregnant suspect pregnant participating study , inform treat physician immediately ; likewise , male patient impregnates female partner , inform treat physician immediately ; NOTE : FOCBP woman ( regardless sexual orientation , undergone tubal ligation , remain celibate choice ) meet follow criterion : Has undergone hysterectomy bilateral oophorectomy Has menses time precede 12 consecutive month ( therefore naturally postmenopausal &gt; 12 month ) FOCBP must negative serum OR urine pregnancy test = &lt; 7 day prior registration Ability understand willingness sign write informed consent Health Insurance Portability Accountability Act ( HIPAA ) consent document prior registration Willingness ability subject comply study requirement Patients may receive investigational agent ; 2 week washout period investigational agent require registration Patients clinically symptomatic brain metastasis require treatment brain metastasis within 4 week registration ( stable sequela acceptable treatment complete ; lesion use target lesion ) Patients history allergic reaction attribute compound similar chemical biologic composition denosumab eligible ( i.e . class drug ) ( Note : prior bisphosphonates allow ; patient could receive bisphosphonates bisphosphonatenaive ; patient previously bisphosphonates enrolled study , long washout period 2 week prior registration ) Patients corticosteroids immunosuppressant 's eligible ; 2 week washout period require registration Patients know additional malignancy progress require active treatment eligible ; patient prior diagnosis cancer &lt; 3 year since last treatment also eligible ; NOTE : exception include basal cell carcinoma skin squamous cell carcinoma skin undergone potentially curative therapy situ cervical cancer Patients uncontrolled intercurrent illness include , limited following , eligible : Hypertension ( defined 160/90 mmHg 3 consecutive reading 25 min apart ) control medication Symptomatic congestive heart failure Unstable angina pectoris Psychiatric illness/social situation would limit compliance study requirement Any illness condition treat investigator feel would interfere study compliance would compromise patient 's safety study endpoint Subject pregnant breast feeding , plan become pregnant within 5 month end treatment Known human immunodeficiency virus ( HIV ) positive patient combination antiretroviral therapy ; ( potential pharmacokinetic interaction denosumab ) No know prior history current evidence osteonecrosis/osteomyelitis jaw No know prior history current evidence untreated local gum oral infection No known/planned active dental jaw condition require oral surgery , include tooth extraction No known nonhealed dental/oral surgery , include tooth extraction Patients plan invasive dental procedure course study</criteria>
