	<detailed_description>Background Complications diabetes represent main concern modern diabetes therapy , become priority characterize pathophysiological mechanism complication ensure development novel rational therapeutic strategy . Although prolonged exposure tissue hyperglycemia primary causative factor chronic diabetes complication , recently become increasingly evident hypoxia also play important role diabetes complication . A low tissue concentration oxygen diabetes consequence several mechanism ( e.g. , deficient blood supply secondarily micro- macro-vascular disease , poor local oxygen diffusion secondarily local edema result increase oxygen consumption ) . Adaptive response cell hypoxia mediate Hypoxia-Inducible Factor 1 ( HIF ) , heterodimeric transcription factor , compose two subunit ( alfa beta subunit ) constitutively express mammalian cell . In normoxia , HIF-1α continually degrade ubiquitin-proteasome system consequence oxygen-dependent hydroxylation two key proline residue catalyze group enzymes call prolyl-hydroxylases ( PHDs ) . Under hypoxia degradation pathway suppress HIF-1α stabilize , translocate nucleus induces 800 gene involve angiogenesis , glycolytic energy metabolism , cell proliferation survival enable cell adapt reduce oxygen availability . HIF-1 central expression several angiogenic growth factor ( ex . Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor ( VEGF ) , erythropoietin ( EPO ) , stromal cell-derived factor-1α ( SDF-1α ) endothelial progenitor cell ( EPC ) recruitment . Recently , propose microRNAs ( ex . mir210 ) also mediate part HIF-1 function . PHDs control HIF 1 α stability function Fe 2+ and/or O2 -dependent enzymes activity could inhibit deplete iron . Deferoxamine ( DFO ) , iron chelator induces therefore HIF-1α accumulation hypoxia-response gene normoxia vitro vivo able restore repress adaptative reaction hypoxia different animal model diabetes . DFO clinical use decade treat excessive iron deposition secondary different pathology ( thalassemia , myelosclerosis etc ) use pharmacological tool induce HIF dependent response . In last decade several piece evidence gather , point diabetes defective cellular response hypoxia . An impaired hypoxia response present tissue develop complication animal model diabetes patient diabetes consequence defective HIF signaling . It direct effect hyperglycemia directly repress HIF stability function multiple level . The recently describe impaired reaction hypoxia diabetes potentially important consequence acute hypoxic challenge acute heart infarction , stroke , limb ischemia ( know bad prognosis diabetes ) also subtle regulation cardiovascular respiratory system consequence autonomic neuropathy potential severe prognostic effect late cardiovascular event . Different study address cardiovascular response intermittent hypoxia ( IH ) compare normoxia exposure patient diabetes . In order establish appropriateness cardiovascular reaction hypoxia diabetes cardiorespiratory angiogenetic response towards IH patient diabetes compare match non- diabetic control subject recently investigate ( HYKRAND ethical approval number 2015/1182-31/4 ) . The preliminary result ( publish ) show several defect acute delay reaction patient diabetes compare control . The baroreflex sensitivity ( BRS ) marker cardiovascular risk survival prognosis cardiovascular event decrease patient diabetes IH compare non-diabetic subject . Both Endothelial Precursors Cells ( EPC ) number level main stimulator Stromal derive factor ( SDF-1α ) decrease response IH diabetic compare non- diabetic subject confirm bad capacity repair ischemic lesion diabetes . The project propose investigate potential DFO ( know improve HIF dependent hypoxic signal ) reverse impaired cardiorespiratory angiogenetic response diabetic patient . Research design . It blind randomize cross-over study investigate efficacy DFO ( 50mg/kg ) v isotonic saline give i.v intermittent hypoxia ( IH ) improve cardiorespiratory angiogenetic response patient diabetes . IH consist five hypoxic period ( 13 % O2 inspire fraction oxygen ) last 6 min , five normoxic interval duration ( use HYKRAND study ) 30 patient type 1 diabetes without clinical sign complication . The study perform 4 day minimum 2 month separation 2 admission ensure sufficient wash-out restore iron deposit . Methods Study design This randomize , double blind study conduct patient diabetes type 1 without chronic complication . Patients randomize ( block randomization ) ( httpps : //www.sealedenvelope.com/ simple-randomiser/v1/lists ) ( A ) Desferal ( DFO ) treatment ( B ) isotonic saline treatment . Both patient personnel blind patient 's treatment group . Subjects advise abstain caffeinated beverage 12 h alcohol 36h prior test Day 1 : Baseline blood sample collect morning afterwards patient receive Desferal ( 50 mg/kg ) / Saline infusion s.c 6hs . During last hour infusion subject expose intermittent hypoxia ( IH ) . Blood sample cardiovascular respiratory ( CR ) measurement perform ( detail ) immediately several time point IH . Day 2 : Blood sample collect morning . IH exposure consist five hypoxic period ( 13 % O2 inspire fraction oxygen ) last 6 min , five normoxic interval duration ( totally 1 hour ) . Day 1 : blood pressure , heart rate arterial oxygen saturation continuously measure . In case decrease oxygen saturation 80 % occurrence symptom , hypoxia discontinue oxygen level reach least 80 % . A technician regulates control breathe period supervision medical doctor way intervention could observe patient . Thereafter , three measurement session perform : immediately ( t2 ) , 3 h ( t3 ) , 6 h ( t4 ) . After t2 , patient obtain individual meal accord diet requirement . Cardiovascular respiratory test . Assessment baroreflex sensitivity . All patient test supine position silent room comfortable temperature . Before participant connect rebreathing circuit mouthpiece antibacterial filter , spontaneous breathing room air rest perform 4 min order obtain baseline data . During condition , continuous measurement oxygen saturation ( SaO2 ) pulse oximeter end-tidal CO2 ( CO2-et ) use capnograph connect mouthpiece perform . Recordings electrocardiogram perform chest lead , continuous noninvasive blood pressure record use cuff method . Two belt ( position around chest abdomen ) monitor respiratory movement chest . A pneumotachograph connect differential pressure transducer insert series expiratory component rebreathing system measure airway flow . The baroreflex sensitivity ( BRS ) measure spontaneous breathe measurement session . Since previous study document good performance one method others , average seven different method : positive negative sequence , a-coefficient low- high-frequency band average , transfer function technique , ratio SDs R-R interval systolic blood pressure variability calculate . Besides BRS , SD R-R interval ( SDNN ) apply determine global index heart rate variability . This selection do base fact normal distribution pronounce variable compare index variability ( e.g. , variance ) . Hypoxic ventilatory response ( HVR ) hypercapnic ventilatory response ( HCVR ) evaluate determine respiratory system activity . Cardiovascular autonomic function determine perform four test accord recent guideline : deep-breathing , 30:15 ratio , Valsalva maneuver systolic blood pressure response stand . Cardiovascular autonomic neuropathy define `` presence two abnormal test '' . The baroreflex sensitivity ( BRS ) evaluate ( t1 ) , immediately ( t2 ) , 3 h ( t3 ) , 6 h ( t4 ) IH . The angiogenetic potential evaluate endpoint 24 H ( Day N3 ) measure serum relevant cytokine gene target HIF-1 ( i.e . Vascular endothelial growth factor ( AVEGFA ) , stromal cell-derived factor 1a ( SDF-1a ) , erythropoietin etc. ) . The direct response HIF signaling evaluate serum level mir210 exclusively regulate HIF . The EPC response evaluate time point Fluorescence-activated Cell Sorting ( FACS ) analysis number Hematopoietic progenitor cell antigen ( CD34+ ) / CD133 antigen/Kinase insert domain receptor ( KDR + )</detailed_description>
