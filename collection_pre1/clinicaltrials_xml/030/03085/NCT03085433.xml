	<detailed_description>More 70 million couple worldwide infertile 40 million actively seek infertility care . In year 2013 , total 160,521 assisted reproductive technology ( ART ) procedures perform United States ( Sunderam et al , 2015 ) . Isolation motile morphologically normal sperm integral part assist reproduction . Traditional sperm processing assist reproduction involve centrifugation `` swim '' technique employ density gradient isolate motile sperm . This technique involve several step centrifugation ( 200-1800g ) colloidal silica particle . In process , sperm material form distinct band . It think procedure allow elimination abnormal/immotile sperm well debris , thereby isolate motile human sperm . Nevertheless , centrifugation process show induce DNA damage produce reactive oxygen specie ( Malvezzi et al , 2014 ; Wang Assist Reprod Genet , 2014 ) , thereby potentially compromise sperm quality subsequent laboratory outcome fertilization rate embryo quality . Increased sperm DNA damage associate poor outcome assist reproduction , include low fertilization rate , impaired embryo progression , decreased pregnancy rate ( Virro et al , 2004 ; Benchaib et al 2007 ; Simon et al 2014 ) . The detail density gradient centrifugation process regulate FDA . In contrast , microfluidic-based sperm sort capability selectively isolate highly motile , morphologically normal sperm high DNA integrity unprocessed semen sample ( Shirota et al 2016 ; Asghar et al , 2014 ; Tasoglu et al 2013 ) . Microfluidic technology isolate healthy sperm laminar flow , create gradient channel . The microfluidic chip plan study randomized clinical trial utilizes space-constrained microfluidic sort select highly motile morphologically normal sperm flow chemical-free design . Unlike standard density gradient centrifugation , manipulation sperm require process . Raw semen introduce inflow motile morphologically normal sperm able swim chip outflow collect use . In semen sample healthy male volunteer split standard processing via centrifugation swim-up procedure compare microfluidic sperm sorting , significantly high percent motility lower rate sperm DNA fragmentation detect microfluidic sperm sampling ( Shirota et al 2016 ) . The microfluidic sperm sort technique thus proven efficient reliable mean sperm preparation compare centrifugation swim-up procedure . While microfluidic chip use clinically Mexico , Turkey , South Africa , Italy , Greece , Switzerland result 5,000 live birth , use clinical practice rigorously study . We aim compare traditional preparation microfluidic sperm sort assist reproductive technology outcome include oocyte fertilization embryo quality subject history poor embryo quality elect undergo repeat vitro fertilization cycle infertility .</detailed_description>
