	<brief_summary>This study design test hypothesis among infant bear less 30 week , weigh less 1500 g delivery , receive initial respiratory support non-invasively invasive respiratory support meeting extubation criterion first 72 h life , few neonate manage Seattle -- PAP require endotracheal intubation conventional mechanical ventilation ( CMV ) neonates manage birth bubble nasal continuous positive airway pressure ( Bn-CPAP ) use Fischer- &amp; Paykel ( FP ) device . Neonates nasal continuous positive airway pressure ( CPAP ) delivery room stabilize mechanical ventilation initial form respiratory support meet criterion extubation within 72 h birth eligible randomization study . The primary endpoint study cumulative incidence respiratory failure require intubation occur patient randomization 36 week post menstrual age ( PMA ) discharge , whichever come first . Presently , literature support age group typically exhibit intubation rate 50 % , consistent data Nationwide Children 's Hospital/Ohio State University ( NCH/OSU ) Neonatal Intensive Care Unit ( NICU ) .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Study Evaluate Efficacy Seattle-PAP Respiratory Support Premature Infants</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Parents / Mothers impend pre-term delivery &lt; 30 week gestation approach informed consent participate . If consent give prior delivery , upon delivery neonate may randomly assign either Fisher &amp; Paykel CPAP ( conventional approach ) Seattle -- PAP ( experimental approach ) . First 72 hour life : 1 ) Neonates able breathe spontaneously less 40 % oxygen initial resuscitative effort would normally place CPAP randomly assign one two treatment group use sealed card generate variable block randomization scheme . 2 ) Neonates require increase support initial resuscitation ( intubation , &gt; 40 % oxygen CPAP ) initially randomize . However , within first 72 hour life , infant meet NCH criterion extubation , randomization CPAP delivery method perform . 3 ) Neonates bear &lt; 30 week gestation intubate birth unable wean ventilator support remove study . 72 Hours - 32 Weeks Life : 1 ) Neonates first period ( First 72 Hours Life , ) remain CPAP continue randomly assign CPAP methodology . 2 ) Neonates first period , fail stabilization CPAP require intubation , able extubated CPAP place back assign CPAP method . 3 ) Attempts make wean back assign CPAP method neonate &gt; 72 hour old require intubation beyond period reason . 4 ) If unable wean back CPAP prior 32 week age , patient remove study . CPAP Failure ( Sub-Group 1 ) : For neonate initially assign CPAP delivery room ( sub-group 1 ) , respiratory failure secondary hyaline membrane disease recognize common occurrence . If patient assign group , regardless CPAP methodology , require fraction inspire oxygen ( FiO2 ) great 0.40 CPAP 6 cm water ( H2O ) , deem require intubation adequate oxygenation , consider failure CPAP stabilization . These patient , however , may remain study becomes clinically feasible return back assign CPAP method prior 72 hour life . If unable do , remove study . CPAP Failure ( Sub-Group 2 ) : Any neonate require FiO2 great 0.40 CPAP 6 cm H2O intubation beyond first 72 hour life also consider CPAP failure . Like assign sub-group 1 , patient may remain study becomes clinically feasible return back assign CPAP method prior 32 week life . If unable do , remove study . All patient remove study outline due unforeseen circumstance monitor discharge change ventilation ventilation requirement status . Routine care , include clinical exam procedure ( echocardiography , ultrasound , eye exam , x -- ray ) would consider standard care patient perform medical discretion assign care provider . No change type CPAP device use ( applicable ) necessary routine practice . Transfers NCH : [ From Outside Hospital ] - Neonates bear outside institution meet inclusion criterion ( &lt; 30 week GA , able spontaneously breathe 72 hour life initially place CPAP fail , &lt; 32 week age ) whose parent reach obtain consent consider inclusion research study . [ Transfers Ohio State University ( OSU ) Hospital ] - It recognize many neonate bear OSU require transport NCH medical care . Having fulfil inclusion criterion OSU , transport NCH result removal study . Cardiopulmonary Monitoring : All neonate monitor NICU use pulse oximetry part normal practice . Many potential subject study also monitor blood test arterial catheter , latter normally intend long term use . Pressure Monitoring : A stand-alone Data Acquisition Recording Instrument ( DARCI ) measure pressure ( i.e. , positive airway pressure [ PAW ] ) attach ventilation circuit . The DARCI unit equip standard International Organization Standardization ( ISO ) 19054 pole mount fitting attach back . A medical grade plug-in transformer provide electrical power ( 120 volt alternate current ( AC ) 5 volt direct current ( DC ) ) . An internal battery on-board non-volatile memory provide continuous data processing storage event power interruption loss . A start button green light emit diode ( LED ) stop button red LED provide operational interface user setup change ventilation circuit . Initial program download recorded pressure data accomplish use laptop personal computer ( PC ) interface application software instal .</detailed_description>
