	<brief_summary>Conventional management diabetic ulcer associate slow healing , high cost repeat trip clinic . Stem cell contain fat graft differentiate pro-healing cell release growth factor evidence suggest benefit wound heal . Platelet-rich-plasma ( PRP ) , autologous blood-product , demonstrate pro-healing property release pro-healing factor regulate angiogenesis . When used combination evidence additional wound heal benefit . The aim investigate rate wound heal diabetic ulcer treat conventional dressing , fat graft alone fat+PRP combination . The secondary aim understand mechanism heal process , health relate quality life patient satisfaction cost implication . The study single-blinded randomise control trial 30 patient three parallel treatment arm . Each patient follow 12 week rate degree wound healing assess . Wound biopsies take Day 0 , week 1 week 4 undergo subsequent histological analysis evaluate mechanism heal . The study expect last two year recruitment first patient conduct Royal Free Hospital UCL Division Surgery Interventional Science . The combination fat+PRP may provide diabetic patient option single treatment improve healing , short followup reduce cost burden . Validation mechanism heal histological analysis confirm clinical finding help guide future research .</brief_summary>
