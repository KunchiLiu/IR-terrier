	<brief_title>A Study Evaluate Safety Efficacy Relugolix Men With Advanced Prostate Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This study international phase 3 randomize , open-label , parallel group efficacy safety study evaluate oral daily relugolix 120 mg patient androgen-sensitive advanced prostate cancer require least 1 year ( 48 week ) continuous androgen deprivation therapy . Relugolix 120 mg orally daily leuprolide acetate depot suspension , 22.5 mg ( 11.25 mg Asian country ) , every 3-months ( 3-M ) subcutaneous intramuscular injection administer patient prostate cancer require androgen deprivation therapy . Approximately 1125 patient enrol study . The study include Screening Period , Treatment Period 48 week , Follow-up Period . Additionally , unscheduled follow-up visit ( ) may arrange patient study-related safety concern need . Eligible patient include evidence biochemical relapse ( rise PSA ) follow local primary intervention curative intent , newly diagnose metastatic disease ( exclude metastasis brain ) , and/or advanced localized disease . Following successful completion Screening period study participant randomize 2:1 oral relugolix 120 mg daily leuprolide acetate 22.5 mg ( 11.25 mg Asian country ) 3-M depot subcutaneous intramuscular injection attend visit monthly ( ie , every 4 week ) serum testosterone PSA assess . Safety assess throughout study monitor adverse event , vital sign , physical examination , clinical laboratory test , 12-lead electrocardiogram .</detailed_description>
