	<detailed_description>This research study Phase II clinical trial . Phase II clinical trial test safety effectiveness investigational treatment learn whether treatment work treat specific disease . `` Investigational '' mean treatment study . MK-3475 humanize monoclonal antibody . An antibody common type protein make body response foreign substance ( particle typically find body bacteria virus ) . Antibodies attack foreign substance protect infection . Antibodies also produce laboratory use treat patient . MK-3475 design restore natural ability immune system recognize target cancer cell . The FDA recently grant approval MK-3475 treatment patient recurrent metastatic head neck squamous cell carcinoma ( HNSCC ) . This study test whether use radiation combination MK-3475 make drug work well participant might otherwise unlikely benefit drug respond either drug give without radiation another similar drug .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Pathologically confirm squamous cell carcinoma head neck evidence metastatic disease consider incurable local therapy . Patients without pathologic cytologic evidence metastatic disease unequivocal evidence metastasis physical examination radiologic evaluation . Patients must evidence radiologic clinical disease progression previous treatment systemic PD1 direct therapy , stable disease prior PD1 therapy ( least 6 dos ) and/or deem derive clinical benefit PD1 direct treatment . Patients must least 3 measurable nonCNS base lesion previously irradiate . Palliative radiation must potentially indicate least one lesion . Patients must agree undergo research biopsy , tumor accessible , baseline ( mandatory ) end cycle 2 pembrolizumab ( optional ) . . Prior systemic therapy : Patients must least 2 week prior chemotherapy , biological agent , immunotherapy investigational drug product , adequate recovery toxicity . For investigational agent , minimum time prior therapy 5 halflives longer 2 week duration . Prior radiation therapy : Patients must least 2 week prior radiation therapy Concurrent administration cancer specific therapy course study allow . Only patient 18 year older eligible . There upper age limit patient must able medically tolerate regimen . Adverse event data currently unavailable use immune checkpoint blockade participant &lt; 18 year age , thus child exclude study . ECOG performance status &lt; =1 ( see Appendix A ) . Ability understand willingness sign write informed consent document Female subject childbearing potential must negative serum pregnancy test screening . Female male subject childbearing potential must agree use adequate method contraception outline section 5.7.1 . Contraception require prior study entry duration study participation 4 month completion pembrolizumab administration . Note : Abstinence acceptable usual lifestyle prefer contraception subject . Participants must normal organ marrow function define : leukocyte ≥3,000/mcl absolute neutrophil count ≥1,500/mcL platelets ≥100,000/mcL hemoglobin &gt; = 9 g/dl total bilirubin ≤1.5 × institutional upper limit normal ( ULN ) AST ( SGOT ) /ALT ( SGPT ) ≤2.5 × institutional ULN AST ( SGOT ) /ALT ( SGPT ) For patient document liver metastasis , ≤ 5 × institutional ULN creatinine ≤1.5 ×within normal institutional ULN OR creatinine clearance ≥60 mL/min/1.73 m2 participant creatinine level institutional ULN . International normalized ratio ( INR ) Prothrombin Time ( PT ) &lt; 1.5 time upper limit normal unless subject receive anticoagulant therapy , long PT PTT within therapeutic range intend use anticoagulant . Activated Partial Thromboplastin Time ( aPTT ) &lt; 1.5 time upper limit normal unless subject receive anticoagulant therapy , long PT PTT within therapeutic range intend use anticoagulant . Laboratory test require eligibility must complete within 14 day prior study entry . Baseline tumor measurement must document test within 28 day study entry . Other nonlaboratory test must perform within 28 day study entry . Metastatic disease impinge spinal cord threaten spinal cord compression . Surgical fixation bone lesion irradiate require indicated provide mechanical stability . Known brain metastasis untreated , symptomatic , require therapy control symptom . Participants previously diagnose brain metastasis eligible complete treatment least 2 week prior trial therapy initiation , neurologically stable , recover acute effect radiotherapy surgery . Any corticosteroid use brain metastasis must discontinue without subsequent appearance symptom ≥2 week initiate protocol therapy . Treatment brain metastasis may include surgery , whole brain radiotherapy , radiosurgery , combination deem appropriate treating physician . Participants receive investigational agent . History allergic reaction attribute compound similar chemical biologic composition pembrolizumab previous toxicity attribute pembrolizumab PD1 direct therapy lead drug discontinuation . Uncontrolled intercurrent illness include limited ongoing active infection , symptomatic congestive heart failure , unstable angina pectoris , cardiac arrhythmia , psychiatric illness/social situation would limit compliance study requirement . Clinically significant electrocardiogram ( ECG ) abnormality , include mark Baseline prolong QT/QTc ( [ QT interval/corrected QT interval ] , e.g. , repeat demonstration QTc interval &gt; 500 m ) . Pregnant woman exclude study immunotherapy potential teratogenic abortifacient effect . Because unknown potential risk adverse event nurse infant secondary treatment mother immunotherapy , breastfeed discontinue mother treat protocol . Individuals history different malignancy ineligible except follow circumstance : diseasefree least 2 year deem investigator low risk recurrence malignancy ; diagnose treated cervical cancer situ basal cell squamous cell carcinoma skin . HIVpositive individual combination antiretroviral therapy ineligible potential interaction immunotherapy medication . Has history ( noninfectious ) pneumonitis require steroid , evidence interstitial lung disease active , non infectious pneumonitis . Active , suspect prior document autoimmune disease require systemic treatment last 2 year immune modify agent ( e.g . replacement therapy thyroxine , insulin physiologic corticosteroid exclusion criterion ) . The subject know positive HepBsAg , HCV RNA . Lack availability follow assessment . The investigator 's belief subject medically unfit receive pembrolizumab unsuitable reason . Has receive live vaccine within 30 day plan start study therapy</criteria>
