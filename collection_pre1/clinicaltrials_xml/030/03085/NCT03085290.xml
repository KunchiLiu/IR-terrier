	<brief_summary>Serum eye drop ( SEDs ) use treat patient extreme dry eye corneal defect . Serum use severe ophthalmic case conventional eye drop ( artificial tear ) insufficient effect . The use SEDs dry eye patient usually rapid effect . Most patient claim effect instantaneous , symptom improve within 48 hour . There evidence suggest substance serum may help heal epithelial defect , epidermal growth factor , fibroblast growth factor , fibronectin , and/or vitamin A . However , precise serum factor responsible alleviate patient 's complaint currently know . Commonly , autologous SEDs use , replace allogeneic SEDs prepare donor serum . Allogeneic SED derive healthy voluntary , non-remunerated male donor blood group AB . The use allogeneic SED could provide blood bank control quality , safe product large quantity quickly available patient . No double-blind randomized trial know exist detect difference result effect allogeneic SED autologous SED . This pilot study intend obtain insight ability autologous allogeneic SEDs improve patient dry eye sensation . Our hypothesis autologous SEDs ( 1:1 dilution saline ) result improvement patient dry eye sensation , allogeneic SEDs ( 1:1 dilution saline ) .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Serum eye drop ( SEDs ) use treat patient dry eye disease , like corneal defect . SEDs use ophthalmic case conventional eye drop insufficient effect . The use SEDs dry eye patient usually rapid effect . Most patient claim effect instantaneous symptom improve 48 hour [ 1 ] . There evidence suggest serum may enhance corneal epithelial healing [ 2 ] . Some biologically active substance think contribute positive effect , like epidermal growth factor , fibroblast growth factor , fibronectin , vitamin A. Autologous SEDs use internationally regular basis , allogeneic SEDs become increasingly popular . In Netherlands , autologous SEDs use . Obtaining autologous SED organizational burden . Patient-related problem old age , travel , travel low vision sometimes immobility due disease . Sometimes venipuncture impossible due poor access . Medical condition inability donate large amount whole blood due previous cerebrovascular accident cardiovascular disease , anemia , use certain medication may prevent collection blood SEDs . Patients affect hematological disease , bacterial , viral fungal infection also unsuitable production autologous SEDs . In 2.3 % donor prepare autologous SEDs , systemic infection detect [ 3 ] . In UK , use autologous SED restrict largely due cost [ 4 ] . Logistically , problem take time well joint effort several department hospital prepare SEDs , cause considerable waiting time patient . Further , use allogeneic drop allow immediate access SEDs case time limited prevent corneal scar , ulcer , infiltrates even transplant , epithelial defect low vision due epithelial surface disease . Allogeneic SEDs derive healthy donor produce blood bank facility . Blood bank experience equipped produce blood product good manufacturing practice ( GMP ) environment . They perform quality control , able produce large quantity quickly available . For study , donor blood group AB select ensure ABO compatibility . Donors select male never blood transfusion minimize anti-HLA titer . No prospective double blind randomized cross-over trial know exist detect difference result effect allogeneic SED autologous SED ocular surface disease . This pilot study intend obtain insight ability autologous allogeneic SEDs improve patient dry eye sensation . Our hypothesis autologous SEDs ( 1:1 dilution saline ) result improvement patient dry eye sensation , allogeneic SEDs ( 1:1 dilution saline ) .</detailed_description>
