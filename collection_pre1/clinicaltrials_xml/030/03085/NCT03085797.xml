	<brief_summary>Nasal polyp ( NP ) long know chronic inflammatory disease nasal mucosa . This disease characterize presence polyp upper nasal cavity , originate within ostiomeatal complex . The presence polyp cause long-term symptom prominent nasal obstruction , post-nasal drip , loss smell , discharge . Mepolizumab ( SB240563 ) Immunoglobulin G 1 [ IgG1 ] , kappa humanize monoclonal antibody ( mAB ) block human interleukin-5 ( hIL-5 ) bind interleukin-5 ( IL-5 ) receptor complex express eosinophil cell surface thus inhibit signal . Neutralization IL-5 mepolizumab show reduce blood , sputum tissue eosinophils hence assume treatment option number eosinophilic diseases include NP . The aim randomize , double-blind , parallel group , phase 3 ( PhIII ) study assess clinical efficacy safety 100 milligram ( mg ) subcutaneous ( SC ) mepolizumab add maintenance treatment adult severe bilateral NP . The study include 4-week run period follow randomization 52-week treatment period . Participants receive mepolizumab 100 mg placebo SC investigator delegate via pre-filled safety syringe every 4 week 52 week . Throughout entire study period ( run + treatment period + follow ) , participant receive standard care ( SoC ) NP consist daily mometasone furorate ( MF ) nasal spray , require , saline nasal douching , occasional short course high dose oral corticosteroid ( OCS ) and/or antibiotic . The treatment period consist thirteen , 4-weekly dos mepolizumab placebo . In addition , first 200 randomized participant follow every month 6 month Visit 15 ( 7 month post last dose ) order assess maintenance response validate physiological model derive previous Phase 2 study . Approximately 400 participant randomize ( 200 participant per treatment arm ) study . Total duration study 76 week first 200 randomized participant 52 week remainder participant participate 6 month treatment follow .</brief_summary>
