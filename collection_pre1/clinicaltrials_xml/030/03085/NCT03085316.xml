	<brief_summary>Standard treatment option patient diagnose BVFP include tracheostomy , cordotomy , arytenoidectomy , suture tie-back . These standard treatment option may result permanent damage vocal fold , therefore affect patient 's ability speak compromise airway protection swallow . Additionally , routine procedure provide sufficient airway permit significant aerobic activity . The goal conduct early feasibility study investigate use device laryngeal pacemaker treat BVFP .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Laryngeal Pacing Study</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The recurrent laryngeal nerve ( RLN ) carry motor fiber innervate abductor ( PCA , opener ) muscle adductor ( closer ) muscle vocal fold . Damage nerve compromise function arrest vocal fold near-closed position . In case BVFP , voice tends functional airway embarrassment often severe enough warrant tracheostomy relieve inspiratory stridor dyspnea . If spontaneous recovery nerve injury occur within one year , likely patient chronically paralyze . In instance , long-term tracheostomy could consider . Unfortunately , permanent tracheostomy know complication tracheal stenosis , chronic infection , psycho-social impairment . For reason , laryngeal surgery offer enlarge airway restore breathe mouth . These procedure , arytenoidectomy cordotomy , portion larynx surgically resect enlarge airway , also inherent complication . Although represent standard care , adversely affect voice may compromise airway protection swallow . Further , provide sufficient airway permit significant aerobic activity . The limitation associate current therapy prompt investigation physiologic , dynamic approach rehabilitation : reanimation paralyze PCA muscle functional electrical stimulation ( FES ) . Stimulation would apply PCA muscle inspiratory phase respiration open vocal fold . During noninspiratory phase , stimulation would cease vocal fold would passively relax midline allow normal voice production airway protection swallow . Based research investigator conduct , investigator expect patient would benefit bilateral pace implantation neurostimulator restore normal ventilation , without negatively affect patient 's voice swallow ability . The investigator collect data study show procedure effective mean surgical approach implantation device insertion anchor electrode lead . Incidence complication intraoperatively postoperatively also collect assess . Any complication address accord current standard practice supervision operate surgeon . The device produce airway allow patient breathe without tracheostomy tube place . Patients monitor adverse event manage accordingly .</detailed_description>
