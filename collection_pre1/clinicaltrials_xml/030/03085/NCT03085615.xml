	<brief_summary>The FEDOX trial prospective randomize clinical trial explore oxidative stress mechanism harm explain negative outcome find feed trial achieve caloric exposure commensurate nationally recommend guideline . Due impact energy metabolism , also explore low T3 syndrome 's relationship mechanism . Finally , explore circadian pattern diurnal/nocturnal TSH fluctuation potential biomarker indicate mechanism harm subside . This 7-day prospective randomize clinical trial design address follow specific aim ( SA ) ICU patient ( n=40 ) recently diagnose acute respiratory distress syndrome . SA1 ) Determine whether provision enteral nutrition ( EN ) 100 % level Nationally Recommended Guidelines NRG ( 25-30 kcals/kg , 100 % NRG ) early critical illness increase reactive oxygen specie ( ROS ) production compare EN 40 % NRG level ( 10-12 kcals/kg , 40 % NRG ) . Subjects fast overnight randomize receive either 100 % NRG 40 % NRG 7 day . Plasma F2-isoprostanes measure daily compare group repeat measure analysis . SA2 ) Determine EN 100 % NRG interrupt critical illness induce low T3 syndrome subsequently increase ROS production compare 40 % NRG . Serum thyroid parameter ( T3 , T4 , rT3 , TSH ) measure daily compare group . Mediation analysis use determine proportion effect nutrition group F2-isoprostane production explain thyroid parameter . SA3 ) Determine return diurnal/noctural fluctuation TSH associate decreased nutrition-induced ROS production . Plasma TSH measure twice per day 0300 1800hrs determine TSH fluctuation . The interaction effect TSH fluctuation nutrition group F2-isoprostane production assess repeated measure analysis . This study provide vital mechanistic insight impact feed oxidative stress first week critical illness , represent important first step determine safe timing dosage nutrition support , set foundation future large clinical trial topic .</brief_summary>
