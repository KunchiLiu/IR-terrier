	<brief_title>The Impact Diabetes REvascularization</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Peripheral artery disease condition define marked accumulation atherosclerotic plaque distal aorta reduces low limb arterial perfusion . Blood flow reduction may inadequate exercise limb cause ischemic muscle pain , call intermitted claudication , , severe case , reduction may inadequate basal metabolism cause pain rest , ulceration , gangrene . The presence symptom rest tissue necrosis medical urgency represent state critical limb ischemia ( CLI ) risk amputation , absence revascularization , high . The age population increase prevalence diabetes mellitus ensure population continue grow foreseeable future . The impact diabetes , however , limited PAD incidence . Diabetic patient represent particularly vulnerable subset PAD patient four-fold risk CLI compare non-diabetic patient . Indeed , previous study CLI , half patient diabetes . As result , combination diabetes PAD account half non-traumatic amputation United States . Diabetic patient often present foot ulceration first manifestation PAD challenge anatomy revascularization . Failed vascular reconstruction , endovascular surgical , often result additional tissue loss transtibial amputation . Despite challenge , mechanisms restenosis impact diabetes well explored type revascularization patient CLI . The BEST-CLI trial multi-center , randomize , comparative effectiveness trial compare open surgical bypass therapy endovascular therapy CLI patient composite clinical endpoint denote Major Adverse Limb Event free survival ( MALE-free survival ) . However , BEST-CLI trial study mechanism revascularization may fail . This proposal extend novel clinical work BEST-CLI trial study mechanisms bypass vein graft stent failure . The investigator adjudicate mode revascularization ( vein graft stent ) central core laboratory , measure systemic marker diabetic dysmetabolism include inflammation , insulin resistance , adverse adipokine expression , poor nutrition , renal dysfunction , begin study association factor graft failure . Indeed , trial conduct date either coronary peripheral revascularization determine mechanism revascularization failure , impact diabetes , relationship conduit patency clinical outcome . Therefore , trial represent unique opportunity investigate mechanism diabetes affect surgical endovascular revascularization procedure .</detailed_description>
