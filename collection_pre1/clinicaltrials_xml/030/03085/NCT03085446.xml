	<brief_summary>Insomnia chronic mental health condition characterize difficulty initiate maintain sleep prevalence 50 % Israeli adult age 65 . It associate increased risk chronic illness ( e.g. , cardiovascular disease ) , poor mental health ( e.g. , anxiety depression ) , functional limitation , cognitive decline . Available pharmacological behavioral treatment focus reduce nighttime hyper-arousal offer limited success , appear `` one size fit '' treatment late life insomnia . Mounting evidence suggests sleep relate metabolic status , however , study association sleep dietary pattern surprisingly scarce . The ability gut microbiota communicate brain emerge excite concept health disease provide rationale present project . Findings demonstrate gut microbiota modulates mental capacity brain plasticity cognitive function old adult , well stress relate mental illness . The composition intestinal microbiota old people ( &gt; 65 year ) differs core microbiota diversity level young adult . With age , gut population beneficial microbe show marked decline . As diet show markedly promote microbiota biodiversity , hypothesize diet-induced change microbiota may provide novel approach treatment mental health . Although insomnia strongly link mental health ( e.g. , depression anxiety ) , well cognitive motor performance , effect diet-induced microbiota alteration , base individual microbiota composition , late life insomnia currently unknown . The propose project first investigate association gut microbiota sleep , assess potential six-months personalize , diet-induced microbiota alteration intervention ( PDM ) , aim improve insomnia older adult . We also look cognitive , motor mental health factor possible mediator relationship . Specifically , test association microbiota composition sleep quality , cross-sectionally longitudinally , i.e. , follow PDM intervention ; evaluate impact PDM change cognitive , motor mental health function ; identify mediate role change cognitive , motor mental functioning effect PDM intervention sleep quality . Findings expect improve quality life old adult enhance sleep , functional status , mental health overall wellbeing .</brief_summary>
