	<brief_summary>Writer 's cramp ( WC ) form focal dystonia , movement disorder characterize sustained intermittent muscle contraction cause abnormal , often repetitive movement , posture , . It typically manifest writing , make handwrite impossible severe case . Treatment difficult , one effective well-tolerated treatment consist local muscle injection botulinum toxin . Although clinical improvement seem related focal muscle chemodenervation , central plasticity change may occur . The main aim study characterize quantify change intrinsic hand muscle cortical representation rest isometric contraction finger muscle treatment botulinum toxin change sensorimotor integration patient writer 's cramp .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Sensorimotor Mapping Patients With Writer 's Cramp</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Fifteen WC patient enrol study . A newly develop neuronavigated robotized Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation ( TMS ) mapping approach use . It generate linear mediolateral excitability profile two intrinsic hand muscle base mean Motor Evoked Potentials ( MEPs ) amplitude stimulation site . Changes excitability profile reflect spatial reorganization cortical motor output map hand muscle . To measure afferent inhibition , map procedure repeat brief peripheral electrical stimulation prior TMS pulse . These Short Afferent Inhibition ( SAI ) profile reflect influence primary sensory cortex motor cortex . Finally , stimulation grid translate primary somatosensory cortex pair pulse TMS paradigm apply digital nerve stimulation . It generate afferent signal processing profile base subjective perception index finger little finger . Participants test botulinum toxin injection three different time point injection ( 7 day , 1 month 3 month ) . Botulinum toxin injection perform use ultrasound guide together electromyography/nerve stimulation clinical affect hand muscle . Muscle selection injection base clinical criterion postural deviation hand finger responsible muscle force . The dose choose accord publish clinical recommendation concern start dose WC clinical examination , usually 5 10 unit Xeomin® flexor extensor hand/forearm muscle . To precisely assess treatment efficacy , Writer 's Cramp Rating Scale ( WCRS ) well computer-based hand write analysis standard sensorimotor test hand function ( Nine Holes Peg Test , tap test tactile spatial acuity task ) perform injection follow session .</detailed_description>
