	<brief_summary>Feeding intolerance common problem preterm infant due immature digestive system . This intolerance extend time full enteral feeding thereby also prolongs time parenteral nutrition ( PN ) . Prolonged time full enteral feeding may predispose infant high risk growth retardation , infection organ dysfunction ( e.g . liver , brain ) . Mother 's milk ( MM ) consider optimal nutrition preterm infant superior infant formula ( include preterm formula , PF ) stimulate gut maturation , feed tolerance , resistance necrotizing enterocolitis ( NEC ) late-onset sepsis ( LOS ) , long-term neurodevelopmental outcome . However , MM often absent , available sufficient amount , first day week preterm delivery . Human donor milk ( DM ) probably well supplement MM PF , DM available hospital . To supplement insufficient MM early neonatal period hospital setting access donor milk , suggest bovine colostrum ( BC ) may use instead PF preterm infant early life . BC , first milk cow birth , rich source protein bioactive component , include lactoferrin , lysozyme , lactoperoxidase , immunoglobulin , various growth factor , IGF-I -II , EGFs , TGF-β . BC repeatedly show improve gut maturation NEC/LOS resistance well-established piglet model preterm infant . We suggest randomize , control trial investigate effect BC vs. PF , supplement MM first 2 week , time full enteral feed preterm infant .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The Precolos-RCT multicenter , two-arm , unblinded , randomize , control trial . Infants randomized intervention group receive BC control group receive PF . In detail , MM always first priority , available . When MM available , available amount fulfill need , infant BC group receive BC control infant receive PF , supplementary diet . Feeding initiate within 24-48 h birth follow pre-defined nutritional guideline . BC intervention exceed postnatal day 14 . After intervention period , participant group receive standard feeding available MM without supplemental preterm infant formula . Infants follow discharge home reach postconceptional age 37 week , whichever come first ( discharge home/37 wks ) . In general , parenteral enteral nutrition give accord follow description : Parenteral enteral nutrition give accord target daily fluid , energy , protein level suggest ESPGHAN CSPEN . Enteral nutrition give accord feed guideline PN use ensure targeted protein , energy , lipid intake enteral feeding insufficient provide fluid nutrition . Participating hospital try best assist mother express colostrum milk give mother 's colostrum first feed . Enteral feed give soon possible within 24h life randomization infant BW &gt; 750g . For infant BW ≤ 750 g , first feed give within 24 h mother 's colostrum available . Otherwise , first feed wait day 2 mother express colostrum . Mother 's colostrum MM give much available , available insufficient amount , BC PF use intervention period supplement lacking volume . Infants receive initial feeding volume 5-10 ml/kg/d volume increase 5-20 ml/kg/d 150-160 ml/kg/d depend BW . The advance rate feeding follow suggest pace also adjust accord tolerability infant . If feeding intolerance occurs , feed flat rate withhold accord predefined criterion 'parenteral enteral nutrition SOP ' . If infant tolerate , feed increase faster . Since total protein intake within 4-4.5 g/kg/d accord ESPGHAN guideline25 , maximal daily volume BC calculate base available volume MM protein level MM BC . The protein supply MM calculate assume protein content 1.5 g/100 mL27 ( first 14 day ) protein supply colostrum 8 g/100 mL ( may adjust change accord product specification batch use difference big 5 % ) . At end intervention period , enteral feed intervention group gradually transfer standard feeding ( MM supplemental PF need ) . Participants control group keep receive standard feed intervention period . However , participant reach term hospital stay , PF may change term formula accord local guideline . The participate hospital use four type PF similar nutrient composition remain throughout study . Although intervention group , infant receive supplemental BC instead PF intervention period , possibility PF BC simultaneously use supplemental diet . For example , participant intervention group tolerate high EN volume available volume MM plus maximum daily volume BC ( due max protein limitation ) , PF need give fulfill total EN volume . Importantly , volume milk diet need adjust accord maximal protein intake 4-4.5 g/kg/d . When BC intake reach maximal volume due protein limitation fluid requirement still need fulfilled PN , PN give amino acid level 0.5 g/kg/d （other nutrient provide accordingly）and BC volume reduce 6.25 ml/kg/d . A detailed guideline parenteral enteral nutrition describe SOP : 'Parenteral enteral nutrition SOP ' .</detailed_description>
