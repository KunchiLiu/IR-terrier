	<brief_summary>The study Phase 2 Study establish safety efficacy drug call Ivacaftor ( VX-770 ) patient chronic obstructive pulmonary disease ( COPD ) , chronic bronchitis , acquire CFTR dysfunction detect sweat chloride analysis . The design pilot , randomize ( 3:1 , active : placebo ) , double-blind , placebo-controlled study . Approximately 40 subject COPD randomize .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>The Topic Trial - Study Determine Safety Efficacy Ivacaftor</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Like CF , COPD characterize small airway mucus obstruction associate accelerated loss lung function mortality . Preliminary data indicate cigarette smoke exert deleterious effect airway epithelial function include reduction CFTR activity , enhance mucus expression , pronounce reduction mucociliary transport ( MCT ) . Preliminary data also indicate approximately 50 % patient COPD reduce CFTR activity , detect upper airway , low airway sweat gland . Furthermore , CFTR dysfunction independently associate chronic bronchitis , persist despite smoke cessation , reverse CFTR potentiator ivacaftor ( VX-770 ) vitro activate wild-type CFTR , result robust increase MCT . Combined unprecedented clinical improvement via augmented mucociliary clearance CF patient responsive CFTR mutation treat ivacaftor , data indicate CFTR represent viable therapeutic target address mucus stasis large subset COPD patient ( potentially represent 4 million patient U.S. alone ) . This project investigate hypothesis ivacaftor augment CFTR activity individual COPD exhibit chronic bronchitis , result meaningful improvement epithelial function respiratory health . The investigator ' initial pilot study patient COPD chronic bronchitis demonstrate ivacaftor safe , demonstrate stable pharmacokinetics , exhibit trend towards efficacy measure PROs sweat chloride . The current trial test safety , pharmacokinetics , pharmacodynamics ivacaftor large number COPD patient chronic bronchitis longer treatment period , evaluate potential CFTR potentiator therapy address acquire CFTR dysfunction population set stage large longer-term trial future . Based IND already place Rowe laboratory , IRB familiar propose study , experience clinical investigation team expertise endpoint propose , well characterize COPD population prioritize presence chronic bronchitis , CFTR dysfunction , absence congenital CFTR mutation , investigator poise deliver trial . Enrollment plan single center , The University Alabama Birmingham . Patients randomize 3:1 active drug ( n=30 ) placebo ( 10 ) achieve enrollment goal . A sufficient number subject screen randomize 50 subject achieve 40 complete subject receive either ivacaftor 150 mg BID ( n=30 ) placebo ( n=10 ) 84 day . Ivacaftor match placebo orally administer capsule accord follow guideline : Between study visit Day 1 study visit Day 84 , subject take 1 dose study drug day morning , begin time 08:00 h ( 8:00 AM ) 12:00 h ( 12:00 PM ) . Whenever possible , subject take study drug time day . On study visit day PK sample collect ( study visit Days 1 , 28 , 56 , 84 ) , study drug take subject he/she study site For visit Day 1 visit , subject instruct bring remain study drug material site ; study drug dispense visit . Ivacaftor prepare dispense unblinded pharmacist . Subjects instruct continue standard COPD medication regimen .</detailed_description>
