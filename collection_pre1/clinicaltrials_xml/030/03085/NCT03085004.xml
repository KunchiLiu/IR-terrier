	<brief_summary>The purpose study evaluate efficacy chemotherapeutic pancreatic cyst ablation use ethanol lavage follow infusion single agent chemotherapeutic agent ( paclitaxel ) compare alcohol free , saline lavage follow infusion multi-agent chemotherapeutic cocktail ( paclitaxel + gemcitabine ) ablation pancreatic cystic neoplasm use endoscopic ultrasound fine needle infusion ( EUS-FNI ) agent delivery . The ultimate purpose o safe effective EUS-FNI , method eliminate pre cancerous cyst prevent significant percentage pancreatic cancer .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>CHARM II : Chemotherapy Ablation Resolution Mucinous Pancreatic Cysts</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Pancreatic cystic lesion increasingly encounter typically discover incidentally cross-sectional imaging , occur approximately 2 % American adult 37 % prevalence individual 80 . Most thesis cyst mucinous ( neoplastic ) origin represent precursor lesion pancreatic adenocarcinoma Discovering pancreatic cyst typically present treatment dilemma , option include either indefinite radiographic surveillance MR ( magnetic resonance ) CT image surgical resection , significant limitation . Surveillance carry significant economic possible psychological burden wait sign malignancy develop , well radiation exposure compute tomography . On hand , surgical resection possess significant risk serious adverse event ( 20 % -40 % ) mortality ( 1-2 % ) . This clinical dilemma delineate press need develop effective , minimally invasive , approach elimination premalignant pancreatic cyst , among , endoscopic ultrasound guide fine needle infusion ( EUS-FNI ) emerge innovative promising approach . Between November 2011 December 30 2015 , investigator interventional endoscopy , surgical oncology , hematology oncology pathology Penn State Hershey Medical Center conduct CHARM clinical trial . This prospective , randomize , double-blind , single-center study N 46 patient require 80 % power prove non-inferiority . Final result CHARM I : Patients treat include 23 female 16 male majority lesion locate body head pancreas . Both alcohol alcohol-free group record 47 % rate complete ablation six month increase 64 % group 1 year completion . With one patient complication alcohol arm ( 6 % ) complication free alcohol arm . The overall objective CHARM II verify significant finding CHARM I multi-center trial request national investigator field . We hypothesize cyst infusion chemotherapeutic cocktail follow normal saline lavage result cyst ablation rate significantly differ achieve single chemotherapeutic infusion follow ethanol lavage . Furthermore , hypothesize removal alcohol decrease adverse event rate associate pancreatic cyst ablation . In order retest confirm hypothesis , propose multi-center , prospective , randomized double-blind , control study evaluate pancreatic cyst resolution rate without ethanol lavage . This investigator-initiated , prospective , randomize , double-blinded , multi-center study evaluate ethanol lavage chemotherapy ablation mucinous indeterminate pancreatic cyst malignant potential . Patients randomize one follow treatment group 1:1 ratio : Control Group : Cysts lavaged 3 minute 98 % EtOH ( ethanol ) infuse 3mg/ml paclitaxel . Study Group : Cysts lavaged 3 minute normal saline infuse admixture 3mg/ml paclitaxel 19mg/ml gemcitabine . At 3 month post ablation , patient undergo follow-up EUS examination manner initial EUS exam . During exam , complete pancreaticobiliary evaluation conduct diameter previously treat cystic tumor measure x dimension assess 3 month response . Any cyst still &gt; 15mm amendable repeat ablation undergo second EUS-guided chemoablation treatment use lavage ablation agent patient randomize initially . At 12 month initial ablation , patient see GI clinic undergo either MRI-MRCP ( magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography ) enhance CT scan full pancreaticobiliary evaluation ass end-point treatment response .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Adults subject aged 1890 Patients previouslydetected pancreatic cyst ( ) 2 cm 5 cm diameter , include indeterminate cyst . Ability give write informed consent . Capable safely undergo endoscopy deep sedation general anesthesia . Pancreatic cyst &lt; 2 cm &gt; 5cm Lesions consistent benign cyst clinical radiographic evaluation ( i.e . consistent pseudocyst serous cystadenoma ) . Known suspected pancreatic cancer pathologic lymphadenopathy . The following high risk feature : main pancreatic duct dilation &gt; 6mm , epithelial type mural nodule , pathologically thick wall/septation ( &gt; 2mm ) , high grade dysplasia cytology , cystic lesion pancreatic head associate sign CBD ( common bile duct ) obstruction , solid mass component within associate cyst . Septated cyst &gt; 4 compartment . ERCP confirm pancreatitis within last 3 month . Baseline lab value time consent : white blood cell ( K/uL ) &gt; 14 &lt; 2 , hematocrit &lt; 30 , platelet ( K/uL ) &lt; 30,000 , nonpharmacologic INR ( international normalize ratio ) &gt; 1.7 , abnormal CA199 ( unit/ml ) , lipase ( U/L ) &gt; 2 time upper limit normal , Creatinine ( mg/dl ) &gt; 3.0 unless stable renal replacement therapy , ALT ( U/L ) &gt; 500 , total bilirubin ( mg/dl ) &gt; 2.5 . Any preexisting discover medical condition would , discretion investigator , interfere completion and/or participation exist protocol . This would include severe preexist medical condition would preclude reasonable 5 year life expectancy ( neutralize patient 's benefit ablating premalignant type pancreatic cyst ) . Pregnancy , breastfeed incarcerate individual .</criteria>
