	<brief_title>Intravitreal Aflibercept Injection Radiation Retinopathy Trial</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Approximately 30 eye randomize ( 1:1 ratio ) either Group 1 Group 2 . Slit lamp exam Indirect ophthalmoscopy perform every study visit , retinopathy level assess , See Appendix II grade scale . SD-OCT perform visit . Fluorescein angiogram perform screen , week 26 week 52 . All image study standard care discretion investigator . This trial compare result 2 group , different treatment interval , assess safety intravitreal Aflibercept injection ( IAI ) treatment radiation retinopathy . Patients group follow total 52 week . Group 1 : 15 Patients receive load dose 3 IAI . They receive 2 mg IAI screening/baseline , week 4 , week 8 , week 12 . A follow-up visit occur week 12 . If extension criterion meet , patient extend 2 week . The patient continue follow per treat extend protocol describe . Group 2 : Patients receive load dose . They receive 2 mg IAI screening/baseline follow visit week 4 . At week 4 , extension criterion meet , patient extend 2 week . The patient continue follow per treat extend protocol describe . Treat &amp; Extend Protocol Patients extend long meet follow criterion - - Absence retinal fluid ( resolution intraretinal subretinal fluid SD-OCT ; Small intraretinal cyst distort foveal contour SD-OCT acceptable consider `` dry '' . ) AND - Less 5 ETDRS letter loss previous visit due new persistent retinal edema . IAI render every visit ( treatment week 26 mandatory visit administer base treat extend status ) , early 4 day target date later 4 day target date . Each extension 2 week duration beyond initial 4-week interval . If extension criterion meet follow-up visit , treatment interval reduce 2 week . Follow interval continue reduce 2 week extension criterion meet 4-week interval reach . All patient mandatory study visit Week 52 ( final study visit ) . No study treatment administer week 50 study termination visit . If patient receives treatment week 48 , return 4 week last clinic visit final study visit ( instead week 52 ) .</detailed_description>
