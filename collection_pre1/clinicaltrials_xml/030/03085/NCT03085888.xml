	<detailed_description>Detection early stage cancer may possible analysis circulate cell-free nucleic acid ( cfNAs ) shed blood tumor . GRAIL use high-intensity sequencing ( base broad genomic coverage deep sequencing ) cfNAs , combine machine learning , develop blood test detect cancer early . The purpose prospective , multi-center , observational cohort study train validate assay early detection breast cancer . The study collect blood sample participant within 28 day screen mammogram . For participant receive cancer diagnosis study , tissue sample collect .</detailed_description>
