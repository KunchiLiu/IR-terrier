	<brief_summary>Primary Objectives Dose escalation phase : • To estimate maximum tolerate dose SGI-110 give prior durvalumab tremelimumab , determine rate DLT Dose expansion phase : • To estimate rate treatment related adverse event combination therapy SGI-110 ( MTD ) , durvalumab , tremelimumab order guide phase 2 trial design Secondary Objectives Both phase : - To measure change expression level predict neoantigens epigenetic therapy SGI-110 perform WES RT-PCR tumor biopsy - To estimate overall response rate ( ORR ) , median duration response ( mDOR ) , median progression-free survival ( mPFS ) , median overall survival ( mOS ) treatment</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>SGI-110 Plus Durvalumab/Tremelimumab SCLC</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>SCLC account approximately 15 % new case lung cancer , estimate 33,000 case expect diagnosed United States 2016.1 Compared NSCLC , SCLC typically rapid double time , high growth fraction , earlier development distant metastasis . Patients limited stage ( LS ) disease treat curative intent use definitive , concurrent chemotherapy thoracic radiotherapy . For patient extensive stage ( ES ) disease , systemic chemotherapy prolong survival case , however long-term survival rare 2,3 . Despite activity several agent SCLC , etoposide plus platinum ( i.e . cisplatin ) doublet regimen remain standard care first-line set high activity compare chemotherapy regimen , well ease combine radiation . Initial response rate may high 70-90 % LS-SCLC 50-70 % ES-SCLC.4 However , disease typically recur rapidly reflected median survival rate 9 11 month ES-SCLC 2-year survival rate le 5 % . This study 3 + 3 design use assess safety SGI-110 give prior flat dos durvalumab ( 1500 mg ) tremelimumab ( 75 mg ) . The start dose SGI-110 30 mg/m2 ( dose level 0 ) target dose predict safe effective 45 mg/m2 ( dose level 1 ) . These dos choose base safety efficacy data phase 1 clinical trial solid tumor , describe . Patients enrol give dose level evaluate safety ( adverse event monitor ) efficacy . There mandatory pre- on-treatment tumor biopsy perform alternate fashion cycle 1 day 8 +/- 2 day cycle 2 day 8 +/- 2 day . The DLT observation period last 4 week ( 28 day ) end C2D1 . Delayed serious immune-mediated adverse event also monitor consider dose limit toxicity .</detailed_description>
