	<brief_summary>This open-label , single-arm , multi-center , phase 2 Study evaluate SHR-1210 ( anti-PD-1 antibody ) second-line therapy adult Chinese patient advance metastatic non-small cell lung cancer fail progressed prior first-line systemic treatment . Enrolled subject assign 4 cohort basis PD-L1 expression tumor cell ( &lt; 1 % , ≥1 % -25 % , ≥25 % -50 % , ≥50 % ) treat standard SHR-1210 dose ( 200mg ) , Q2W , document progressive disease ( PD ) occur . Subjects return clinic every two week . Radiographic disease assessment perform every 6 week . The primary study hypothesis treatment SHR-1210 improve Objective Response Rate compare standard care ( SOC ) , matter much PD-L1 expression tumor .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>In similar clinical trial , anti-PD-1 anti-PD-L1 antibody produce durable response approximately 20 % unselected patient advance non-small-cell lung cancer . Developing reliable , validated biomarkers identify patient increase probability response antibody remain challenge . Because PD-1 pathway may key mechanism immune escape subgroup patient non-small-cell lung cancer , PD-L1 expression tumor inflammatory cell candidate biomarker . However , PD-L1 expression formally validate biomarker contemporaneously collect tumor tissue . Additionally purpose study assess correlation expression PD-L1 tumor response treatment SHR-1210 non-small cell lung cancer .</detailed_description>
