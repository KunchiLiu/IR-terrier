	<brief_summary>Intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasm ( IPMN ) potential develop malignant disease vary severity . Decision make make therapeutic intervention simple . Endoscopic equipment enter pancreatic duct provide much need additional information cystic condition . Visual inspection , direct visual guide biopsy target cytology flush fluid pancreatic duct may helpful decision make process treat condition . We study whether SpyGlass pancreatoscopy bring accuracy diagnostic process concern IPMNs provide additional information help make decision therapeutical intervention . We also document complication related procedure follow week procedure .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Evaluating Suspected Intraductal Papillary Mucinous Neoplasms ( IPMN ) With SpyGlass Pancreatoscopy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>In part retrospective , part prospective single-center study look patient undergone SpyGlass pancreatoscopy Helsinki University Hospital recent year , recruit patient continuously obtain significant amount study subject . We investigate radiological finding diagnose SpyGlass procedure , ERCP ( endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography ) perform , also brush cytology . During SpyGlass procedure collect direct visual guide biopsy suspect IPMN area flush liquid use pancreatic duct . We compare diagnosis give collect sample one patient base examination SpyGlass pancreatoscopy . Our SpyGlass pancreatoscopy technique different compare previous study . With equipment able provide pancreatoscopy patient , previously endoscopic stenting procedure affect pancreatic duct . We also collect analyze flush fluid malignant cell , n't do . With new mean hope get accurate result .</detailed_description>
