	<detailed_description>There exist physiological limitation expiratory flow physical property bronchial tree ( flexible bronchial wall complex architecture subject variation pressure volume ) . For give lung , give state , pulmonary volume correspond Maximum Expiratory Flow ( MEF ) . In healthy subject , bronchial smooth muscle basal tonicity negligible . If tonicity increase , generally lead reduction MEF . If decrease , MEF rather tend increase , healthy individual inhibition contraction bronchial smooth muscle inhalation bronchodilatator lead reduction MEF : call `` paradoxical effect '' . When reduction exist , appear occurs low pulmonary volume ( approximately 50 % volume le 25 % CV ) . Under circumstance , seem basal tonicity bronchial smooth muscle would fight expiratory collapse bronchus , would happen especially distal bronchus , low pulmonary volume forceful expiration . The existence phenomenon would favour `` stiffen '' role bronchial smooth muscle . The bronchial smooth muscle would harmful cell cause asthma attack . Primary end-point : The aim study evaluate occurrence increase Expiratory Flow Limitation ( EFL ) Negative Expiratory Pressure ( NEP ) bronchodilation certain healthy men breathe low pulmonary volume ( apply chest wall strapping ) . Secondary end-point : The secondary objective - evaluate effect fall tonicity bronchial smooth muscle ( normal constrain pulmonary volume ) follow criteria/variables : - closing volume : would expect increase . - modification force flow-volume loop ; would expect reduction MEF low lung volume . - modification Pulmonary Function Test ( PFT ) ; would expect absence significant difference certain pulmonary volume ( Vital Capacity - VC , Total Lung Capacity -TLC , … ) , perhaps reduction Inspiratory Capacity ( IC ) , increase airway resistances high frequency oscillation - Validation digital model expiration Florens-Filoche : towards tool assistance interpretation PFT . During various experimental session , record certain `` number '' variable necessary `` feed '' final model Florens-Filoche , : - Oesophageal Pressure , Mouth Pressure : continuously . Static oesophageal pressure : - Residual Volume -RV , TLC , VC - flow pulmonary volume continuously . This study attempt develop tool assist interpretation PFT : - early disease detection ( bronchial smooth muscle ) , - well follow-up obstructive pathology , response treatment , - simplification diagnosis asthma , - automation interpretation… Study Design : The study include 3 visit , follow : Visit 0 : Anthropometric characteristic Medical screen eligibility criterion Chest X-ray ECG Blood pressure Pulse oximetry , heart rate PFT Visit 1 : The first visit ( V1 ) last 3h 30 minute roughly consist : - PFT : spirometry , maximal flow-volume loop ( MFVL ) , sit position . - Closing Volume airway resistances sit position . - Insertion small oesophageal catheter continuous monitoring oesophageal pressure measurement static pressure volume - Thoraco-abdominal ( chest wall ) strap - Measures slow VC MFVL lie position - NEP lie position - Removal thoraco-abdominal ( chest wall ) strap - Test Bronchodilatation ( combine Salbutamol 200μg Ipratropium bromure 80μg ; 2 inhalation ) : wait 30 min - Thoraco-abdominal ( chest wall ) strap - NEP - Measures slow VC MFVL lie position - Removal thoraco-abdominal ( chest wall ) strap - Measures slow VC MFVL sit position - Removal small oesophageal catheter - Closing Volume airway resistances sit position Each measurement repeat least 3 time , least 2 reproducible measurement obtain . Visit 2 : The second meeting ( V2 ) propose participant present reduction MEF time V1 protocol . It consist Methacholine Challenge Test . The duration test approximately 1 hour . Number Subjects include : 65 healthy subject 35y necessary find l 6 subject present `` paradoxal effect '' . Duration study : two year</detailed_description>
