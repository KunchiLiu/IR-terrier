	<brief_summary>The overall goal project determine effect anti-cancer chemotherapy reflex control blood pressure vascular function . Recent data demonstrate cardiovascular disease-related mortality 2nd cause morbidity mortality 7-year cancer survivor treat chemotherapy . This anti-cancer treatment-mediated cardiotoxicity progressive process begin molecular level , progress myocardial injury leave ventricular dysfunction , cumulate heart failure cardiovascular disease-related mortality . In parallel cardiac-specific change , chemotherapy also show increase risk vascular-related abnormality . However , impact adjuvant treatment function structure peripheral vascular system remain poorly understood . With normal age , two important vascular adaptation artery , strongly contribute increase risk vascular-related general cardiovascular disease , increase large artery stiffness dysfunction vascular endothelium . Therefore , overall goal project determine effect anthracycline-based chemotherapy large small artery function structure . The central hypothesis type cancer therapy result negative vascular consequence determine non-invasive evaluation spontaneous blood pressure control , carotid artery stiffness , vascular endothelium-dependent vasodilation . This observational study design increase understand vascular change occur follow anti-cancer chemotherapy provide insight new method decrease cardiovascular disease risk treat cancer .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Cancer remain one leading cause death modern society . Breast cancer prevalent type cancer society , due increase rate detection couple advanced therapy , ≈230,000 people newly diagnose year breast cancer , approximately 90 % expect live beyond 5 year . Despite trend improve cancer-related morality , cancer survivor significantly increase risk cardiovascular disease ( CVD ) morbidity mortality . As , approximately $ 800 million spend annually provide cardiovascular care female cancer survivor alone . In recent study , Daher et al . ( 2012 ) report Framingham Risk Score 8.4 10-year risk general CVD 7.6 % men woman cancer survivor older 30 yr . More importantly , also determine mean vascular age cancer survivor 8 year great chronological age , suggest sub-clinical manifestation CVD may present within vasculature cancer survivor . The definition scientific study cardiotoxicity , date , primarily focus solely myocardial injury relate adjuvant cancer therapy National Cancer Institute define `` toxicity affect heart '' ( http : //www.cancer.gov/dictionary/ ) . However , cancer survivor also risk vascular-related abnormality . Despite risk , impact adjuvant treatment function structure peripheral vascular system still poorly understood . With normal age , two important vascular adaptation artery , strongly contribute increase risk vascular-related general CVD , increase large artery stiffness dysfunction vascular endothelium [ 15 , 16 ] . In subject receive anthracycline chemotherapy , Chaosuwannaki et al . ( 2010 ) , Miza-Stec et al . ( 2013 ) , Draft et al . ( 2013 ) independently demonstrate significant increase aortic stiffness 4-6 mo follow treatment . Likewise , carotid intima-media thickness show increase within 6 mo treatment chemotherapy . This critical give arterial stiffness intima-media thickness independently associate increase risk cardiovascular disease . In addition , carotid artery stiffness key determinant sympathetic baroreflex sensitivity old men woman . This information suggest decrease baroreflex sensitivity may occur follow chemotherapy treatment , important give primary mechanism autonomic nervous system regulate arterial blood pressure low baroreflex sensitivity associate cardiovascular morbidity mortality . Specific Aim 1 address question . The vascular endothelium first physiological barrier encounter intravenously administer chemotherapy . Unfortunately , effect adjuvant therapy endothelial function primarily study childhood cancer survivor follow single treatment session . Chow et al . ( 2006 ) observe decreased brachial artery flow-mediated dilation ( FMD ) , measurement endothelial-dependent dilation , ≈20 mo follow anthracycline-based chemotherapy . Similarly , Vaughn et . ( 2008 ) demonstrate decreased FMD long-term survivor testicular cancer . In addition , several report demonstrate decrease arterial reactivity various biological vasodilator ( e.g. , sodium nitroprusside , acetylcholine ) follow acute chemotherapy radiation . In contrast study , Jones et al . ( 2007 ) report difference FMD breast cancer patient ≈20 mo post-treatment compare healthy control . Increasing understanding effect chemotherapy endothelial function essential , especially since initial step development cardiovascular disease . Recently , skin microcirculation use model circulation evaluate change vascular health variety diseases include hypertension , renal disease , diabetes , atherosclerosis , coronary artery disease , heart failure . This work facilitate , part , easy accessibility high responsiveness biological vasodilator . Given paucity information endothelial health cancer patient undergo anthracycline chemotherapy evaluation skin microcirculation provide non-invasive useful method increase understanding cardiotoxicity . Specific Aim 2 address problem . Specific Aim 1 : Evaluate change spontaneous blood pressure control arterial stiffness patient treat anthracycline-based chemotherapy . Hypothesis 1a : Spontaneous baroreflex sensitivity significantly decrease cancer patient cancer survivor treat anthracycline-based chemotherapy . Hypothesis 1b : Changes baroreflex control blood pressure relate increase carotid artery stiffness cardiac change leave ventricular ejection time . Specific Aim 2 : Evaluate change macrovascular microvascular vascular function . Hypothesis 2a : Treatment anthracycline-based chemotherapy significantly decrease endothelium-dependent vasodilation large brachial artery small microvascular capillary skin . Hypothesis 2b : Changes vascular function associate molecular marker endothelial function oxidative stress .</detailed_description>
