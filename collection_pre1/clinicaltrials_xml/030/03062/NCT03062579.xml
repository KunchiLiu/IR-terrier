	<brief_summary>Neuromyelitis Optica Spectrum Disorder ( NMOSD ) severe inflammatory disease central nervous system characterize relapse optic neuritis longitudinal extensive transverse myelitis . The specific autoantibody aquaporin 4 ( AQP4-ab ) suggest contribute pathogenesis disease . Peripheral blood plasma cell major source AQP4-ab . Previous study observe increase IL-6 level serum cerebrospinal fluid patient NMOSD , particularly relapse . Exogenous interleukin ( IL ) -6 promotes survival plasma cell production AQP4-ab vitro . And blockade IL-6 receptor signal anti-IL-6 receptor antibody reduce survival plasma cell vitro . Tocilizumab ( ACTEMRA® ) , humanize monoclonal antibody IL-6 receptor , show beneficial clinical effect patient NMOSD concomitant immunosuppressive medication administer . However , long-lasting biological effect precede immunotherapy rituximab might overlap subsequent tocilizumab therapy . To reduce side effect concomitant treatment large extent verify beneficial effect tocilizumab , evaluate safety efficacy tocilizumab monotherapy patient NMOSD .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Longitudinal Study ACTEMRA® ( Tocilizumab ) Monotherapy Highly Active NMOSD</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The purpose study determine drug tocilizumab monotherapy contribute reduce average relapse rate ( ARR ) improve neurological disability NMOSD patient , still experienced relapse common immunosuppressive medication include rituximab use . The primary ( important ) objective study determine : Whether bortezomib reduces relapse frequency patient relapse NMO . The number attack one year treatment period compare number attack occur prior initiation tocilizumab treatment . The secondary objective determine : The safety profile tocilizumab patient NMO whether tocilizumab improve walk , visual function quality life measure variety establish disability scale .</detailed_description>
