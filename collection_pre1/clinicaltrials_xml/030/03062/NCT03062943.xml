	<brief_title>A Study Nintedanib LymphAngioleioMyomatosis ( LAM )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>There high unmet medical need efficacious safe treatment LAM , halt lung function decline , improve patient-reported outcome , reduce size angiomyolipomas ultimately decrease mortality . Guidelines recommend participation research trial possible . To date , therapeutic option include mTOR inhibitor sirolimus everolimus . Among , sirolimus , approve FDA base clinical trial show stabilization lung function express FEV1 12 month treatment period . Thus stabilization lung function appear require continuous exposure drug . Sirolimus associate increased frequency adverse event like mucositis , gastrointestinal event , hypercholesterolemia , acneiform rash , swell low extremity . Nintedanib show dose-dependently inhibit PDGFR phosphorylation subsequent signal via protein kinase B ( Akt ) extracellular signal-regulated kinase ( ERK ) 1/2 lung tissue mouse . Akt ERK 2 phosphorylate tuberin result inactivation hamartin-tuberin complex consequent activation mTOR . It demonstrate platelet-derived growth factor β receptor ( PDGFRβ ) present active human murine TSC lesion . Thus , inhibition PDGFR may effective LAM . Moreover , inhibition VEGF , PDGF FGF signal pathway reduces tumor angiogenesis lung . As angiogenesis lymphangiogenesis mechanism involve dissemination LAM cell , potential inhibition angiogenesis nintedanib may contribute prevent disease progression LAM . Therefore , non-randomized , efficacy , safety , tolerability trial nintedanib sporadic TSC-associated LAM propose . The objective trial ass efficacy favorable benefit-risk ratio nintedanib treatment LAM dose 150 mg bid .</detailed_description>
