	<brief_summary>The purpose study evaluate long-term visual outcome cataract surgery use large-scale comprehensive database high myopic cataract age-related cataract patient . The investigator investigate various genetic environmental factor may contribute pathogenesis high myopic cataract .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Shanghai High Myopia Study</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>High myopic cataract ( HMC ) become major high-risky type cataract China , account nearly 30 % cataract recent year . Compared age-related cataract , HMC characterize earlier onset , severe lens opacity , high incidence vitreoretinopathy postoperative complication compare age-related cataract ( ARC ) . The main purpose study evaluate long-term visual outcome cataract surgery use large-scale comprehensive database high myopic cataract , compare age-matched ARC patient . On hand , due lack research pathogenesis HMC , difficult investigator precisely evaluate risk prognosis , improve prevention treatment . The previous study investigator major large-sample analysis clinical feature relate gene HMC . After preliminary screening , eight gene select investigation : 1 ) gene relate pathogenesis HMC : CRYAA/ GSTP1/ TXNRD2 ; 2 ) gene relate vitreoretinopathy : MCP1/ VEGFA/ CFH ; 3 ) gene relate postoperative complication : TGFB2/ CERS2 . In present study , order establish risk model HMC aspect precision medicine , investigator prepare set comprehensive clinical database sequence select gene ( include exon , promoter , 5 ' UTR 3 ' UTR sequence ) large scale , intensively investigate site function single nucleotide polymorphism ( SNP ) correlate clinical feature HMC . The research aim evaluate long-term visual outcome cataract surgery use large-scale comprehensive database high myopic cataract , thoroughly illustrate influence HMC-related gene prognosis elucidate pathogenesis HMC , promotion disease prevention prognosis well .</detailed_description>
