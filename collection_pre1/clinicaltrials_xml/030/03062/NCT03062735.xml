	<brief_title>Efficacy Inspiratory Muscle Training Elite Swimmers</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Only study assess impact Inspiratory Muscle Training ( IMT ) swim performance unclear inconsistent result . This study aim evaluate effect 12-week IMT program swimming performance , airway dysfunction perceive breathlessness among elite swimmer . Participants recruit elite competitive Futebol Clube Porto swim team . After consent , individual randomly allocate IMT Sham-IMT group . A pressure threshold device use perform inspiratory training . The IMT group perform 30 inspiratory effort , 5 time week , twice day , pressure threshold load equivalent 50 % maximal inspiratory pressure ( MIP ) . Sham-IMT group follow similar protocol , except inspiratory effort make 15 % MIP . Measures lung function , swim performance , airway dysfunction , inspiratory muscle strength perceive breathlessness assess begin 4 week interval end study period . All outcome measure assess investigator involve intervention process . Data express mean ± standard deviation ( SD ) respective 95 % confidence interval . The significance level 5 % ( p˂0.05 ) .</detailed_description>
