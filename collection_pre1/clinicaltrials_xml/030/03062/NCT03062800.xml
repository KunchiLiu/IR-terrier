	<brief_summary>The study innovative strategy warrant treatment advance non-squamous NSCLC epidermal growth factor receptor wild-type unknown mutation status outcomes remain unsatisfactory patient . Maintenance treatment first-line chemotherapy interest strategy largely investigate last year . This study evaluate efficacy toxicity thalidomide combination chemotherapy maintenance treatment patient advance non-squamous NSCLC .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Lung cancer common cancer lead cause cancer mortality world . Every year , one million people die lung cancer worldwide . NSCLC account 85 % lung cancer diagnosis continue remain major therapeutic challenge . Chemotherapeutic agent treatment advance NSCLC reach plateau effectiveness administer classic modality . In first-line treatment advance non-squamous NSCLC epidermal growth factor receptor wild-type , cisplatin plus pemetrexed consider best chemotherapeutic regimen . Recently , PARAMOUNT trial demonstrate continuation maintenance pemetrexed improve progression-free survival overall survival induction therapy cisplatin plus pemetrexed advanced non-squamous NSCLC epidermal growth factor receptor wild-type . Bevacizumab , pure humanize anti-VEGF monoclonal antibody ( mAb ) improve outcomes chemotherapy alone combine chemotherapy first-line therapy advance non-squamous NSCLC . A randomized phase Ⅲ trial name Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group E4559 demonstrate concurrent bevacizumab chemotherapy follow maintenance bevacizumab previously untreated patient advance non-squamous NSCLC associate increase overall survival . In China , cost continuation maintenance pemetrexed bevacizumab high current economic environment . Thalidomide much cheap pemetrexed bevacizumab , show activity numerous malignancy . Although exact anti-tumor mechanism unknown , thalidomide exhibit immuno-modulating anti-angiogenic effect . Based potentially synergistic mechanism action , thalidomide potential enhance activity conventional chemotherapy . Results previously publish small study thalidomide give concurrently conventional chemotherapy continue maintenance therapy suggest thalidomide might effective treatment patient small cell lung cancer NSCLC . Study evaluation efficacy toxicity thalidomide combination chemotherapy maintenance treatment patient advance non-squamous NSCLC epidermal growth factor receptor wild-type necessary .</detailed_description>
