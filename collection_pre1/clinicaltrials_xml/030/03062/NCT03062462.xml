	<brief_title>Low-dose Ticagrelor Double Standard-dose Clopidogrel Platelet Aggregation Clopidogrel Resistance 's Patients With Coronary Heart Disease</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Dual Antiplatelet Therapy ( DAPT ) aspirin P2Y12 receptor inhibitor remain cornerstone secondary prevention coronary artery disease ( CAD ) . Clopidogrel one commonly use antithrombotic agent inhibits platelet P2Y ( 12 ) adenosine diphosphate ( ADP ) receptor . With widespread use clopidogrel , resistance clopidogrel attract increase attention , emerge new challenge adversely affect patient clinical risk outcome . Clopidogrel resistance mean blood platelet show little response clopidogrel . Recent study find clopidogrel resistance rate 11 % ~ 44 % . Clopidogrel resistance common patient loss-of-function CYP2C19 genotype , closely associate increase risk serious cardiovascular event , include ischemic event , myocardial infarction , stent thrombosis , revascularization . This seriously affect prognosis patient , bring difficulty clinical treatment . Ticagrelor oral , reversibly-binding , direct-acting P2Y12 receptor antagonist use clinically prevention atherothrombotic event patient acute coronary syndrome ( ACS ) . Guideline recommendation use dual antiplatelet therapy formulate ticagrelor 90 mg twice daily plus aspirin preference clopidogrel 75mg daily plus aspirin ACS patient . Recent study find ticagrelor 90mg twice day orally could significantly reduce occurrence clopidogrel resistance adverse cardiovascular event . The previous study report half-dose ticagrelor similar inhibitory effect platelet aggregation standard-dose ticagrelor , significantly strong clopidogrel group . But still clear effect low-dose ticagrelor platelet function patient clopidogrel resistance coronary heart disease . Therefore , perform randomize , single-blind clinical trial observe effect low-dose ticagrelor double standard-dose clopidogrel platelet aggregation cardiovascular prognosis clopidogrel resistance 's patient coronary heart disease .</detailed_description>
