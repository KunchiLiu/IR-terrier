	<detailed_description>Type 2 diabetes ( T2D ) one great health challenge worldwide . The disease strongly associate obesity , develop via pre-diabetic condition , insulin resistance low-grade inflammation play important role , T2D , failure pancreatic beta-cell compensate insulin resistance cause hyperglycemia . According recent estimate , 350 million people worldwide suffer diabetes . The disease typically lead many year reduce quality life due side complication cardiovascular disease ( CVD ) , blindness , kidney failure amputation . T2D estimate 4th lead cause death Western world 5-10 year reduce life expectancy . It generally agree healthy diet increase physical activity effective preventing T2D , also may help achieve good control T2D reduce risk CVD . There , however , general agreement healthy diet constitutes . During last decade , several cell surface receptor respond free fatty acid ( FFA ) discover . These free fatty acid receptor ( FFARs ) belong superfamily G protein-coupled 7-transmembrane receptor ( GPRs ) , implicate metabolic process , energy expenditure inflammation . Consequently , several receptor attract interest potential target treatment metabolic inflammatory disease , include obesity T2D . FFAR1 ( GPR40 ) , activate long-chain FFA , highly express pancreatic β-cells increase glucose-stimulated insulin secretion ( GSIS ) [ 4 ] . There evidence FFAR1 also express intestinal enteroendocrine cell , promote secretion incretin hormones GLP-1 GIP . GLP-1 highly interesting treatment obesity T2D ability increase GSIS , enhance β-cell growth , increase insulin sensitivity , reduce gastric motility , increase satiety cause loss weight . The published phase II clinical trial selective FFAR1 agonist TAK-875 demonstrate high efficacy reduce plasma glucose without increase incidence hypoglycemia , cause considerable interest receptor new target treatment T2D . FFAR4 ( GPR120 ) , activate unsaturated long-chain FFA , express gastrointestinal system , adipose tissue , β-cells , report promote GLP-1 secretion intestinal cell , counteract inflammation increase insulin sensitivity adipose tissue . Notably , dysfunctional FFAR4 recently connect development obesity mouse human . This considerably increase interest receptor target obesity metabolic disease . This supported indication unsaturated FFA revert diet-induced hypothalamic inflammation FFAR4 , thereby reduce body weight diet-induced obese ( DIO ) mouse . These FFARs thus express different tissue body potentially affect metabolic inflammatory condition T2D obesity . These function combine abundance fatty acid food suggest FFARs consider nutrient sense regulator metabolism . Roux-en-Y gastric bypass ( RYGB ) surgery , often use treat severe obesity , frequently result immediate beneficial effect glucose metabolism T2D , often complete remission . These effect part independent weight loss , may explain significant increase GLP-1 level immediately surgery . Thus , appear effect depend purely delivery nutrient pancreatic juice directly low part ileum . Normally , FFA rapidly absorb upper part gastrointestinal tract . It therefore possible RYGB effect partly due enteroendocrine stimulation FFAR1 perhaps FFAR4 direct nutrient delivery , FFA release low intestine . A hypothesis investigate PhD project delivery specific naturally occur polyunsaturated FFA proven high efficacy FFAR1 FFAR4 directly low intestine mimic beneficial effect observe RYGB less expense few adverse effect . Delivery high load unabsorbed FFA distal small intestine achieve taking advantage enteric coat dissolve pH &gt; 6.0 , observe lumen distal jejunum , ileum colon , independent colonic flora . This enteric coating technology well establish deliver drug ileum colon . The potential positive effect principle recently report small cohort patient T2D . Thus , delivery small amount lauric acid ( C12 fatty acid ) distal gut use enteric-coated pellet stimulate GLP-1 secretion lower postprandial glucose level response meal . No chronic effect test study . Although suggested author , increase release GLP-1 could involve direct stimulation FFAR1 and/or FFAR4 lauric acid distal gut . As part FFARMED project support Danish Council Strategic Research , screen 36 relevant FFA ability act FFAR1 FFAR4 agonists vitro carry identify potent naturally occur dual FFAR1/FFAR4 agonist clinical study . Of , polyunsaturated fatty acid ( PUFA ) , pinolenic acid show significantly high efficacy others , therefore select study . To support choice , effect pinolenic acid test use small dose ( 100 mg/kg ) give 30 min prior oral glucose tolerance test ( OGTT ) mouse . Convincingly , purify pinolenic acid significantly improve glucose tolerance reduce AUC-glucose , peak-glucose level compare control ( corn oil ) . The efficacy similar obtain pharmaceutical selective FFAR1 agonist ( TUG-905 ) . Pinolenic acid fatty acid contain Siberian Pine nut , Korean Pine nut seed pine . The high percentage pinolenic acid ( ~20 % ) find Siberian Pine nut oil produce . Korean Pine nut oil give hydrolyze FFA , TG , report increase secretion GLP-1 decrease appetite overweight female . This support result , indicate purified pinolenic acid improve glucose metabolism mouse . Hypotheses As described , expression FFAR1 FFAR4 intestinal enteroendocrine cell , pancreatic beta-cells adipose tissue link 1 ) increase secretion GLP-1 hence incretin-mediated increase GSIS suppression glucagon secretion , 2 ) direct positive effect GSIS , 3 ) reduce inflammation , 4 ) improve insulin sensitivity 5 ) increase energy expenditure . Based finding , perform number clinical trial use pinolenic acid derive Siberian pine nut naturally occur dual FFAR1/FFAR4 agonist . We hypothesize ingestion small amount pinolenic acid give enteric-coated pellet dissolve low intestine 1 ) increase meal-related GLP-1 secretion stimulate FFAR1/FFAR4 enteroendocrine cell cause improved GSIS increase satiety , 2 ) enhance GSIS directly stimulate FFAR1 ( perhaps FFAR4 ) beta-cells , 3 ) attenuate low-grade inflammation see insulin resistant condition obesity T2D stimulate FFAR4 adipocytes . Aims To test hypothesis , aim project investigate : 1 . The effect enteric coat pellet pinolenic acid ( hydrolyzed pine nut oil ) placebo ( corn oil ) tolerability , safety level glycemia four pilot study healthy individual . 2 . The acute effect pinolenic acid meal-induced change I ) circulate level glucose , insulin , GLP-1 , GIP glucagon , II ) plasma lipid inflammatory marker , III ) appetite rating , IV ) substrate metabolism patient T2D lean healthy non-diabetic obese individual . 3 . The chronic effect pinolenic acid give 3 time daily 8 week I ) incretin effect , II ) GSIS , III ) body composition , IV ) lipids inflammatory marker V ) substrate metabolism VI ) marker insulin resistance inflammation tissue biopsy ( muscle adipose tissue ) patient T2D non-diabetic obese individual . This registration cover second four plan pilot study investigate difference effect pine nut oil hydrolyze pine nut oil insulin , glucose incretin hormone administer acutely combination oral glucose tolerance test .</detailed_description>
