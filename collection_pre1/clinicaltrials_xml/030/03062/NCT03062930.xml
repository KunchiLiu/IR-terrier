	<brief_summary>Stroke survivor severe contralesional paresis often substantial control coordination deficit non-paretic arm . Because arm must serve primary controller , deficit functionally devastate . The investigator hypothesize combination severe paresis ( Upper Extremity Fugl-Meyer Score â‰¤35 ) persistent motor deficit non-paretic arm limit functional independence chronic stroke survivor . The investigator predict remediation , focus non-paretic arm improve functional independence . The investigator propose randomize study design two tract , two period four assessment . The investigator envision study first step establish basis rehabilitation approach focus remediation BOTH arm , constitute substantial change current remediation protocol focus contralesional arm .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The investigator previously elaborate hemisphere specific motor deficit non-paretic arm chronic stroke survivor unilateral hemisphere damage . The investigator show deficit associate substantial limitation performance activity daily live ( ADL ) , effect exacerbate contralesional paresis due force reliance non-paretic arm . The investigator hypothesize combination low moderate severe paresis ( Fugl-Meyer Score &lt; 35 ) persistent motor deficit non-paretic arm limit functional independence chronic stroke survivor . The investigator predict intense remediation focus improve speed , coordination , accuracy non-paretic arm improve functional independence , well improve paretic arm function due increase participation daily activity . Unfortunately , usual standard care rehabilitation survivor low-moderate severe paresis tend focus task train essential ADL activity , rather intensive remediation . Previous research show non-paretic arm deficit depend hemisphere damage stroke , leave hemisphere damage ( LHD ) impair trajectory feature , include speed smoothness , right hemisphere damage ( RHD ) impair ability bring arm rest accurate stable position . The investigator design train program address motor component improve speed dexterity non-paretic arm . The investigator propose randomize study design two tract , two period four assessment . Participants first complete 2 baseline assessment , space 3 week apart . Following completion second assessment , participant randomly assign one two track : Track 1 receive three week arm training , follow 3 week comparison condition . Participants assign track 2 receive three week comparison condition , follow 3 week arm training . Then , participant complete end-of-period assessment , follow-up assessment retention , 3 week completion two period . Pilot result indicate non-paretic arm training produce substantial improvement motor performance functional independence well reduce paretic arm impairment . This essential first-step develop rehabilitation protocol focus remediate arm severely impaired stroke survivor .</detailed_description>
