	<brief_summary>Physician mainly use RECIST progression-free survival ( PFS ) NCI CTCAE safety guide evaluate treatment efficiency . In contrast Health Related Quality Life ( HRQOL ) assessment often restrict clinical trial . It could particular interest evaluate HRQOL daily clinical practice order adequately choose manage first line therapy , especially since HRQOL diagnosis show prognostic factor overall survival advance metastatic renal cell carcinoma ( mRCC ) . A systematic collection daily clinical practice HRQoL data use standardized questionnaire could strengthen management symptom : improve symptom control , improve patient-clinician communication , satisfaction care well-being patient fine overall survival . The objective QUANARIE Study assess feasibility HRQOL assessment daily clinical practice patient mRCC treat tyrosine kinase inhibitor ( TKI ) use electronic patient report outcome ( PRO ) . Indeed , goal make HRQoL data accessible exploitable real time clinician , help medical professional optimize practice adopt holistic personalize approach base patient report outcomet .</brief_summary>
