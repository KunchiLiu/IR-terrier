	<brief_summary>Benign prostatic hyperplasia ( BPH ) refer proliferation smooth muscle epithelial cell prostate gland . The enlarged gland potential result low urinary tract symptom ( LUTS ) secondary either bladder outlet obstruction increase muscle tone resistance , . For decade transurethral resection prostate ( TURP ) gold standard treatment symptomatic BPH refractory nonoperative management . This surgical intervention aim reduce size prostate gland . However , past fifteen year , many alternative therapy introduce include laser enucleation prostate ( LEP ) . LEP numerous advantage include decreased blood loss length hospital stay well increase effectiveness safety large prostate gland size ( &gt; 80g ) .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Laser Enucleation Prostate ( LEP ) Versus Transurethral Resection Prostate ( TURP )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The purpose study compare effectiveness TURP LEP use ProTouch laser technology . While TURP historically gold standard , LEP become widespread arguably safer effective therapy patient . TURP still widely perform traditional therapy decade data support efficacy , despite high volume blood loss risk TUR syndrome . In comparison , data demonstrate Holmium Laser Enucleation Prostate similar efficacy may longer operative time . The ProTouch laser comparable Holmium laser additionally provide improved hemostasis tissue vaporization . There little data compare LEP ProTouch laser TURP . This study directly compare efficacy two treatment method enrol eligible subject compare outcome .</detailed_description>
