	<detailed_description>The investigator recently introduce new approach frozen-thawed policy euploid blastocysts routinely perform . This single centre retrospective study patient undergo PGS cycle . The aim study assess result obtain PGS programme implementation new biopsy timing transfer policy . Results obtain PGS cycle blastocyst biopsy frozen-thawed embryo transfer analyse comparison cycle cleavage stage biopsy fresh blastocyst transfer .</detailed_description>
