	<brief_summary>The purpose study assess safety , acute long term effectiveness , standard RF ablation procedure use Ablation Index VISITAG™ software combination Thermocool SmartTouch® ( ST ) SmartTouch Surroundflow® ( STSF ) catheter . Furthermore , role Ablation Index VISITAG™ workflow create contiguous ablation line assess . The study prospective , non-randomized , post-market clinical evaluation . Up 330 patient include study . All patient qualify base study specific requirement invited participate . The total duration study estimate 24 month ( 12 month enrollment period 12 month follow ) . The clinical investigation population include subject undergoing RF ablation treatment drug resistant symptomatic paroxysmal AF . Prior enrollment clinical investigation , subject must meet inclusion/exclusion criterion suitable candidate enrollment clinical investigation opinion investigator . Subjects must fail least one antiarrhythmic drug ( AAD ) ( Type I III , include β-blocker ) evidence recurrent intolerant AAD .</brief_summary>
