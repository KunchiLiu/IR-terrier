	<detailed_description>Purpose : The objective study enhance form nonpharmacological treatment delusion schizophrenia use neuromodulation , confirm effect use electroencephalogram ( EEG ) behavioural measure ( Whitman et al. , press ; Whitman , Minz &amp; Woodward , 2013 ) . Specifically , transcranial alternate current stimulation ( tACS ) use improve outcome participation metacognitive training ( MCT ) treatment psychosis . MCT group-based program develop directly current cognitive neuropsychiatry research finding schizophrenia psychosis . MCT share knowledge gain research lab help individual experience psychosis become aware think pattern involve illness . The main purpose metacognitive training help people change think pattern cause delusion , thereby avoid relapse illness reduce impact delusion ( Moritz et al. , 2014 ) . tACS non-invasive brain stimulation technique weak electrical current apply head order change likelihood neural firing region cortex stimulation electrode ( Antal &amp; Paulus , 2013 ) . Hypothesis : Neuromodulation enhance benefit non-pharmacological treatment program , MCT , reduction severity delusion schizophrenia . Justification : It clear help individual schizophrenia become aware think pattern underlie delusion provide effective tool counter thinking pattern ( Moritz et al. , 2013 ; Mortiz et al. , 2014 ) . The MCT program treatment delusion involve experience situation everyday interpretation reality must question . Empirical study meta-analyses indicate MCT effective , even three year completion treatment ( relative active control condition treatment usual ( TAU ) ) . Despite success , treatment schizophrenia consider highly effective , always room improvement effect size . Neuromodulation provide improvement bias pathological brain functioning towards healthy state prior MCT , enhance openness question everyday interpretation reality , enhance effect MCT treatment delusion . tACS almost entirely non-invasive purely modulatory , change likelihood neural fire region cortex stimulation electrode . It possible modulate different frequency oscillation , accordance healthy brain function interpret reality . The propose research involve application oscillation-targeted neuromodulation protocol bias brain functioning towards state promotes question everyday interpretation reality , thereby reduce severity delusion , enhance response train program treatment delusion schizophrenia raise insight think pattern lead delusional thought . The investigator plan document brain change induce neuromodulation use performance EEG measure take decision make task involves interpretation reality , performance correlate severity delusion . This task involve judge likelihood evidence match hypothesis , show judge likelihood increase patient strongly delusional . The investigator show task state ( i.e. , evidence-hypothesis match ) elicit increase alpha power task positive network , decrease beta power default-mode network ( Whitman et al. , press ) . This suggest maximize power alpha band task-positive network bias brain towards healthier state weigh evidence test hypotheses reality , confirm EEG behavioral measure take aforementioned decision make task , heighten response MCT , correspond decrease severity delusion . Research Design : Neuromodulation involve tACS target increase power alpha band dorsomedial prefrontal region , expect also decrease power beta band ventro-medial region . This confirm EEG recording source estimation ( Whitman et al. , press ; Whitman , Minz &amp; Woodward , 2013 ) . MCT four week program eight one-hour session . TAU four week waitlist control group . Sham neuromodulation involve application random pattern low-grade current brain region neuromodulation condition ( Antal &amp; Paulus , 2013 ) . Severity delusion measure Psychotic Symptom Rating Scales psychosis ( PSYRATS ) ( Haddock et al. , 1999 ) . The behavioral measure interest rating match evidence hypothesis , decrease delusion decrease . Statistical Analysis : Between-groups ( neuromodulation/MCT vs. sham/MCT v neuromodulation/TAU ) analyse variance ( ANOVA ) carry change score compute behavioral measure severity delusion , pre- post MCT TAU , hypothesis decrease severity delusion great neuromodulation/MCT condition relative sham/MCT neuromodulation/TAU condition .</detailed_description>
