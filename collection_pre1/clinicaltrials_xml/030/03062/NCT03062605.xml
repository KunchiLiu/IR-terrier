	<brief_summary>The purpose study determine effect two-step mouth rinse procedure reduce germ ( mutans Streptococci ) cause tooth decay . We hope two-step mouth rinse ( 0.3 % NaOCl follow 10 % Povidone Iodine ) decrease tooth cause germ well one-step mouth rinse ( 10 % Povidone Iodine ) . The mouth rinse treatment group do begin study initial saliva sample take , detailed examination teeth gum . It hypothesize treatment group receive NaOCl Povidone iodine significantly low microbial count control group ( Povidone iodine ) NaOCl disrupt microbial biofilm make Povidone iodine effective decreasing microbe biofilm . Microbial count make Salivary sample take participant baseline , one week , one month , two month three month . The sample test two commercial method determine microbial count . The CariScreen Test rapid bioluminescence assay quantitates total number organisms present . The CRT test require culture medium specific two germ ( S. mutans Lactobacillus ) strongly associate tooth decay . The result CRT Test read three day incubation .</brief_summary>
