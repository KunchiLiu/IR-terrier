	<brief_summary>Congenital myasthenia LEMS potentially lethal disorder , , even careful management , significantly impede participation normal daily function . Currently approve therapy little impact promote normal quality life activity patient . The goal systematically examine effect 3,4-DAP natural course disease gain additional experience titrate 3,4-DAP available therapy maximize clinical function development patient population . The specific aim study evaluate use 3,4 Diaminopyridine ( DAP ) select patient proven genetic serum antibody test Congenital Myasthenic Syndrome ( CMS ) Lambert-Eaton Myasthenic Syndrome ( LEMS ) . We evaluate patient CMS LEMS , prescribe 3,4 DAP , clinically evaluate response .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Treatment Use 3,4 Diaminopyridine Congenital Myasthenia Lambert-Eaton Syndrome</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The subject population consist select patient proven genetic testing , muscle biopsy antibody test CMS LEMS . Consideration entry clinical study require referral treat pediatrician neurologist . Dr. Maselli examine patient deem appropriate neurophysiologic examination University California , Davis Medical Center . In vitro neuromuscular recording anconeus muscle biopsy material ( well standard light electron morphologic analysis ) documentation genetic mutation associate congenital myasthenia require patient confirm diagnosis CMS . If participant decides volunteer , diagnosis Congenital Myasthenic Syndrome ( CMS ) Lambert-Eaton Myasthenic Syndrome ( LEMS ) establish , participant may need undergo muscle biopsy blood sample DNA test . The investigator also obtain blood test participant start treatment annually participant start treatment . Participants electrocardiograph ( EKG ) start treatment , every 2 year . All study participant return clinic year ( often neurologist feel necessary ) follow-up care . Participants blood test annual visit . Participants receive treatment study drug approve FDA use patient CMS LEMS , investigator stop study drug ( n't work participant unsafe take ) , study end reason ( i.e . safety concern discover , etc . ) , whichever come first . Participants allow stay medication myasthenia add medication treat condition , necessary . If participant unclear history episode resemble seizure determine investigator , drive operate heavy machinery first 6 month study . Participants may participate study pregnant breastfeed woman childbearing potential plan become pregnant study . It unclear 3,4 DAP effect unborn fetus . Therefore , woman childbearing potential pregnancy test prior start study drug periodically throughout study , need . Participants think may become pregnant study tell study doctor immediately .</detailed_description>
