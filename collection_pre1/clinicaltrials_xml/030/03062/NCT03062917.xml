	<brief_summary>This study compare novel method NS BS standard technique nasophayngeal aspiration ( NPA ) routine ETT suction . We shall assess sample diagnosis RSV , viral load immune response airways baby RSV infection . We shall also assess genetics baby include study , see may vulnerable RSV infection .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Nasal Bronchial Absorption Sampling RSV Bronchiolitis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>In conjunction specialist medical device manufacturing company ( Hunt Developments ( Midhurst , West Sussex ) produce novel nasosorption bronchosorption kit CE marking . Both nasosorption bronchosorption method use synthetic absorptive matrix ( SAM ) strip : look feel like blot paper , place onto mucosal surface . These comfortable use use frequent interval extend period time . This non-invasive technique ideal infant child , possible obtain neat mucosal line fluid ( MLF ) even normal healthy nose . The eluate contain cytokine chemokines high detectable level multiplex immunoassay . We would like use SAMs take MLF sample nasal bronchial mucosal surface see novel technique overcome problem current sample method . We plan use absorption technique measure RSV viral load . We also aim look immune response term anti-viral interferon response ( IFN-γ , IFN-λ , IFN-α2a , IP10 , ITAC ) . In therapeutic study future , may possible document level drug ( pharmacokinetics ) nasal MLF .</detailed_description>
