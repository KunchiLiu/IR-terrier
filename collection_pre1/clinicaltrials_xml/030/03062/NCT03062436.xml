	<brief_summary>Patients chronic myeloid leukemia ( CML ) conventionally put life long therapy tyrosine kinase inhibitor drug ( Imatinib mesylate India ) . Patients achieve deep molecular response sustain least three year , take drug therapy . Thereafter close monitoring require monitor disease relapse . In case evidence disease recurrence highly sensitive molecular assay , drug therapy restart . The study aim identify proportion patient keep drug therapy state sustain molecular remission .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>To Study Impact Stopping Therapy Patients CML With Molecular Remission</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>While large number study stop TKI therapy similar patient exist Europe USA , study do Indian south Asian population . Almost study do previously note relapsed patient , show disease recurrence stop TKI therapy , remission state regain TKI therapy restart .</detailed_description>
