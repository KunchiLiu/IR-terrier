	<brief_summary>With rise prevalence allergic diseases subsequent risk develop immune-related disorder , primary prevention allergy become major priority . It generally acknowledge breastfeed one main pillar allergy prevention . Infant formula base hydrolysed protein develop used infant increase risk develop allergy case mother unable chooses breastfeed infant . The effect hydrolyse formula allergy prevention examine many study , conclude currently sufficient evidence support hydrolyse protein intact protein allergy risk reduction . Moreover , several clinical trial support suggestion supplementation pre and/or probiotic reduction eczema development , recognize international authority . The present study ( MAESTRO ) investigate preventive effect hypoallergenic concept combine several nutritional approach related preventive strategy : partially hydrolyse protein formula supplement prebiotics probiotic . The aim present study investigate efficacy , growth safety concept compare standard ( intact protein ) infant formula development allergic manifestation age 12 month infant increase risk develop allergy .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description />
	<criteria>1 . Healthy term infant ( gestational age ≥ 37 ≤ 42 week ) high risk develop allergy base family history allergy ( *1 ) . 2 . Infants age ≤ 16 week ( max . 16 week + 0 day ) , preferably soon possible birth . 3 . Infants birth weight within normal range gestational age sex ( 10th 90th percentile accord local applicable growth chart ) . 4 . Infants start formula feeding within 16 week age ( infants mother choose breastfeed mother completely/partially cease breastfeed subject 's age 16 week ) OR Infants exclusively breastfed whose mother intention exclusively breastfeed least infant 16 week age ( *2 ) . 5 . Written inform consent one parent ( accord local law ) and/or legal guardian . 1 ) Family history allergy define least one firstdegree relative ( parent full sibling ) : 1 ) selfreported historically doctor confirm allergic disease ( allergic rhinitis , asthma , food allergy , allergic eczema ) ; 2 ) selfreported historically nondoctor confirm allergic disease ( allergic rhinitis , asthma , food allergy , allergic eczema ) combination positive skin prick test . 2 ) Subjects whose mother intent switch formula feeding subject 's age 16 week end still exclusively breastfeed , include breastfed reference group . The way around , subject whose mother intent exclusively breastfeed least 16 week , end decide switch formula earlier , include randomised group . All subject meet in/exclusion criterion . 1 . Consumption amount infant formula base intact protein randomisation . 2 . Consumption amount infant formula add probiotic and/or probiotic supplement randomisation . 3 . Existing allergic manifestation ( e.g . allergic skin disorder , food allergy ) randomisation accord investigator 's clinical assessment . 4 . Severe congenital abnormality could influence subject ' growth ( e.g . cystic fibrosis , bronchopulmonary dysplasia , tracheomalacia , tracheoesophageal fistula , major congenital heart disease , condition accord investigator 's clinical judgement ) . 5 . Severe neonatal illness ( e.g . respiratory distress syndrome , severe sepsis intraventricular hemorrhage , severe neonatal jaundice , necrotizing enterocolitis , persistent pulmonary hypertension newborn , condition require use intravenous antibiotic ) . 6 . Known underlying disease predispose infection ( e.g . HIV , viral hepatitis B , C , autoimmune diabetes , immune deficiency ) . 7 . Severe renal failure hepatic failure accord investigator 's clinical judgement . 8 . Incapability parent comply study protocol investigator 's uncertainty willingness ability subject comply protocol requirement . 9 . Participation study involve investigational market product concomitantly within two week prior screen visit .</criteria>
