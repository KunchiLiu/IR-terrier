	<brief_summary>It universally accept best nutrition new-born infant breast milk . Breast milk provide complete set nutrient support growth development child early life , include component beneficial effect gut health body 's ability defend infectious organism invader ( immune system ) .However , may occur mother unable breastfeed child , choose breastfeed . In case , infant formula inspire breast milk best alternative . Research do optimize milk formula infant . One formula contain 'partially hydrolyze ' protein instead intact protein , mean protein formula break small piece . These small piece protein make milk suitable consumption infant risk develop cow 's milk allergy . These type partially hydrolyze protein formulas market several year , particular child family risk allergy . So far , safety relate issue report . It also know weight gain infant receive partially hydrolyze proteins general appropriate accord World Health Organisation growth standard . The main purpose TENUTO study demonstrate infant receive specific partially hydrolyze protein infant formula first 4 month life similar weight gain compare infant receive standard infant formula intact protein . A group infants receive breast milk also include comparison .</brief_summary>
