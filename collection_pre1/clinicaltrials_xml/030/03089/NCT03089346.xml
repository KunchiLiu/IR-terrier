Currently , compute tomography ( CT ) method reference evaluate quantify bronchial thickness remain unable differentiate bronchial inflammation remodelling radiation-based technique . Magnetic Resonance Imaging ( MRI ) Ultrashort Echo Time ( UTE ) pulse sequence promise non-ionizing alternative lung imaging .

	<brief_title>Assessment Bronchial Thickness Using MRI Asthma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Asthma major public health problem , pathologically characterize bronchial remodel lead thicken bronchial wall . Computed tomography ( CT ) method reference quantify bronchial thickness involve ionize radiation , thus limit possibility frequent long-term follow-up . Magnetic Resonance Imaging ( MRI ) non-ionizing 3D imaging technique . However , lung MRI technically challenge currently use routine practice . Indeed , low proton density susceptibility effect lead low signal intensity derive lung parenchyma . Recently , pulse sequence Ultrashort Echo Time ( UTE ) implement use half radio-frequency excitation radial projection reconstruction . These UTE sequence make theoretically possible retrieve signal lung parenchyma . We aim use 3D T1-weighted UTE pulse sequence 1.5T magnet ( Avanto dot , Siemens ) asthma order ass bronchial thickness . Thirty patient asthma include 10 patient severe asthma enrol study . All participant benefit CT MRI . Our strategy consist quantify bronchial thickness use MRI CT patient , test correlation MRI CT measurement assess reproducibility bronchial thickness assessment use MRI . Our objective demonstrate MRI-UTE pulse sequence 1.5T accurate reproducible evaluate quantify bronchial thickness .</detailed_description>
