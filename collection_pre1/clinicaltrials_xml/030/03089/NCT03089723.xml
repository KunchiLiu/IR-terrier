	<brief_summary>Although common problem , hand osteoarthritis ( HOA ) less studied knee hip . In age group 71-100 year , prevalence symptomatic HOA reach 26 % woman 13 % men . These patient lose hand strength difficulty day-to-day manual activity . The main joint involve proximal distal interphalangeals carpometacarpal joint thumb . In educational Project PARQVE , prevalence HOA 23.7 % inclusion program , 47.4 % one year , loss grip strength . There controversy effect viscosupplementation treatment rhizarthritis consider pain . However , strength important function parameter must evaluate function quality life maintenance . Concerned importance maintain strength function program ( PARQVE ) , add specific exercise tom improve hand strength range motion . Trying optimize treatment confront question effect joint wash , call placebo comparative study corticosteroid and/or hyaluronic acid injection , work patient wash physiological saline solution group , empty , receive 1mL hyaluronic acid mannitol . PURPOSE : To compare isolated lavage lavage follow injection hyaluronic acid mannitol carpometacarpal osteoarthritis joint thumb . METHODS : Forty joint patient multiple osteoarthritis ( rhizoarthritis , include ) comorbidities ( two : overweight obesity , hyperglycemia , dyslipidemia , hyperuricemia , hypertension ) allocate two group : Lavage ( LS ) Lavage Injection Hilauronic acid ( LO ) . Both group undergo joint lavage saline solution . The LO group receive 20 mg / mL hilauronic acid injection 5mg mannitol . Both group guide clinical treatment osteoarthritis metabolic syndrome give daily exercise hand . They evaluate quick DASH questionnaire , measure palmar , lateral pulp-pulp grip strength , addition measure ROM VAS pain moment immediately prior procedure , one , three six month articular procedure .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Patients multiple osteoarthritis ( include carpometacarpal joint thumb , stag I III - Eaton et al . ) treatment Institute Orthopedics Traumatology fo Clinics Hospital - University SÃ£o Paulo ( IOT-HC-FMUSP ) invite participate study . All patient oblige participate two-day education course OA . During program instruct OA , metabolic syndrome , comorbidities importance diet , daily exercise ( include specific exercise hand ) . After inclusion , 40 joint randomize one two treatment option , i.e. , Lavage saline solution final injection 1mL saline solution , lavage saline solution follow injection 20mg hyaluronic acid mannitol ( 5mg ) . After procedure patient receive naproxen 500mg twice daily 5 day . Patients instructed exercise least 180 minutes/week possible daily exercise hand ( 5 10 minute daily ) . Patients instruct write exercise well daily medication intake ( co-morbidities pain ) . All patient submit pain ( VAS ) , range motion ( ROM ) functional ( palmar grip strength lateral pulp-pulp pinch strength ) evaluation immediately prior procedure 1 , 3 6 month joint . As assessment pain , range motion strength compare measurement limb inclusion , hand involve patient consider case . The `` n '' calculate obtain statistical power 80 % level significance 5 % . To , consider mean standard deviation pulp-pulp pinch ( primary outcome ) find previous study prevalence hand OA individual knee osteoarthritis submit educational program . A sample size use detect variation 1 point two-tailed pulp-pulp pinch . The sample size calculate group 16 . Considering also possible fault abandon 20 % patient , value 20 patient per group obtain .</detailed_description>
