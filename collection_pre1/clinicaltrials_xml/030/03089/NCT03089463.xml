	<brief_title>Foot Assessment People With Diabetes : A Quantitative Diagnostic Approach</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The purpose research observational cohort study investigate applicability use biomechanical assessment predict ulceration incidence patient diabetic neuropathic foot . The propose study lead development stratification high-risk patient subcategories indicate vulnerability tissue mechanical trauma , deem leading cause ulceration people diabetic neuropathy . As stand , current system use evaluate risk diabetic foot rely global parameter duration diabetes glycated hemoglobin predict likelihood risk diabetic foot ulceration . As ulceration happen result repeat mechanical trauma foot n't heal quickly enough due complication diabetes , important include mechanical measurement predict ulceration incident diabetic neuropathic patient . Despite , currently use risk stratification system include biomechanics introduce biomechanics potentially possible predict ulceration risk use local measurement . The primary objective employ measure neuropathy , micro/macro-perfusion , biomechanics foot mainly tissue stiffness plantar pressure determine vulnerability foot mechanical trauma ulceration . From data collect propose prognostic risk stratification system develop base range parameter collect identify high risk ulceration incident . Those classed high risk sub-stratified increase accuracy system predict ulceration . This allow patient-specific approach take prevention ulcer provide adequate information predict ulceration incident . This used determine likelihood ulcer forming . Furthermore , possibility identify ulceration site investigate .</detailed_description>
