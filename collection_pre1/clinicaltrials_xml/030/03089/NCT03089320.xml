	<detailed_description>HIV-positive patient unhealthy alcohol use often motivate decrease alcohol consumption rarely receive treatment drinking . To address challenge , plan provide treatment HIV clinic , highlight patient impact alcohol medical condition , use Contingency Management ( CM ) step care design adjust treatment patient response . CM evidence base therapy promote abstinence substance use , include alcohol . Since CM study unhealthy alcohol use HIV-infected patient include step care strategy provide Addiction Psychiatrist Management ( APM ) ( alcohol pharmacotherapies indicate ) Motivational Enhancement Therapy ( MET ) patient achieve abstinence CM .

The goal Financial Incentives , Randomization Stepped Treatment ( FIRST ) Trial compare onsite CM plus step care versus treatment usual ( TAU ) randomize clinical trial HIV-positive patient unhealthy alcohol use seven HIV clinic . CM patient receive onsite CM counseling session financial reward contingent abstinence demonstrate breathalyzer PEth . Rewards also award address medical condition impact alcohol achieve alcohol treatment goal . After three month , patient step APM MET PEth result indicate attained abstinence . This randomized clinical trial test hypothesis CM plus step care lead great abstinence , decrease alcohol consumption improve HIV biomarkers measure VACS Index .</detailed_description>
