	<brief_summary>Breast cancer lead cause cancer among Canadian woman nearly 26,000 new case diagnose year . Fortunately , advancement diagnostic tool curative treatment significantly improve overall survival . However , development cardiac toxicity ( include asymptomatic symptomatic heart failure ) associate use anthracycline contain chemotherapy target therapy include trastuzumab limit improvement survival woman breast cancer . Cardiac toxicity life threaten complication lead reduced physical functioning quality life . The increase risk associate share risk factor among cancer heart failure direct influence cancer therapy cardiovascular system . Cardiac rehabilitation ( CR ) ( include exercise training education/counselling ) show improve health outcome , reduce heart failure relate hospitalization modestly improve mortality among individual non-treatment related heart failure may benefit woman breast cancer treatment related cardiac toxicity ( BC-CT ) . Therefore , single centre , randomize control trial aim determine participation exercise base CR program improve cardiorespiratory fitness , cardiovascular function/structure health , quality life among woman BC-CT .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Efficacy Cardio-Oncology Rehabilitation Exercise Women With Breast Cancer Treatment Related Cardiotoxicity</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Study Design : A single centre , two-arm , parallel group standard care control superiority trial balance ( 1:1 ) block randomization conduct Toronto Rehabilitation institute , Toronto Canada . A total 38 woman ( 19 participant per study arm ) BC-CT present Cardiology Clinics Toronto Canada enrol . After baseline assessment , eligible participant randomize one two arm include exercise rehabilitation program control group ( exercise training intervention ) . Patient Population : Women BC-CT ( define decrease leave ventricular ejection fraction &gt; 10 percentage point , value &lt; 53 % 2D-echocardiography diagnosis heart failure ) undergoing therapy anthracyclines and/or trastuzumab . Procedures : The follow measurement collect begin follow 12 week intervention . Participants also expect attend one weekly exercise session Toronto Rehabilitation institute week , expect complete additional exercise training session home community week . Day 1 : All participant undergo baseline assessment Toronto Rehabilitation Institute include cardiopulmonary exercise test ass VO2peak . Resting exercise haemodynamic outcome , VO2peak achieve , symptom , reason test termination also collect . Standard measure conduct intake process include height , weight , body fat percent , waist circumference also collect . The participant provide blood requisition form return first week class . The questionnaire physical activity pattern ( Godin Leisure Physical Activity Questionnaire ) , quality life , health history questionnaire , well activity track device also administer research coordinator upon initial visit . Day 2 : All cardiac assessment conduct separate day test Toronto General Hospital skilled clinical cardiac sonographer . Day3 : The vascular assessment complete University Toronto.Trained research staff familiar echocardiography analysis complete offline analyse vascular assessment . Throughout program : Information regard adherence exercise program also collect research coordinator week via exercise training diary activity track device participant . Reasons miss session also assess . Lastly , completion rate program collect via patient chart upon completion final cardiopulmonary exercise test . Intervention : The exercise rehabilitation program consist one weekly supervise 90-minute session consist aerobic resistance exercise addition education/counselling total 12 week . Each participant ask complete four additional aerobic training session one two resistance training session home community week . Case manager include nurse , physiotherapist register kinesiologists responsible supervise class . The participant initial aerobic exercise prescription base outcomes baseline cardiopulmonary exercise test . The first week class include initial exercise trial determine exercise prescription base cardiopulmonary exercise test appropriate individual ( i.e. , similar heart rate response exercise , participant complete exercise prescription potential symptom might report ) . Participants engage over-ground walking , treadmill walk stationary biking depend limitation individual , participant preference availability equipment complete exercise home . The goal progress patient 60 minute aerobic exercise , five time per week , intensity equivalent 60 % 80 % VO2peak , equivalent intensity ventilatory threshold . Exercise duration increase every one two week ( equivalent 10 % current exercise prescription duration ) , maximum intensity 80 % VO2peak . The exercise prescription progress base feedback patient , exercise heart rate rating perceive exertion . Participants able monitor exercise prescription use heart rate achieve cardiopulmonary exercise test correspond 60 % 80 % VO2peak rating perceive exertion corresponds 11 15 Borg scale . Patients required keep detailed record exercise session , note distance walked/biked , duration , rest peak heart rate , rating perceive exertion aerobic training session . Resistance training introduce 4th week program . The resistance exercise program consist ten exercise target major muscle group . Participants begin 10 repetition weight equivalent 60 70 % individual 1 repetition maximum . The weight require achieve exercise intensity determine 4th week class use modify 1 repetition maximum assessment . The resistance training progress every 1 2 week increase number repetition 12 15 respectively . Once participant complete 15 repetition , instruct reduce repetition back 10 add additional set . The progression use participant complete 3 set 15 repetition . Resistance training record include amount weight lift , number repetition complete , set perform rating perceive exertion exercise . Education Component : Each week participant attend 30-minute education session follow completion exercise training . The education component program consist topic design help participant achieve optimal self-management condition foster lifestyle behavior change . The education session deliver consistent current education program Toronto Rehabilitation Institute . Topics address educational session include , limited , benefit physical activity , goal setting , healthy eating , deal stress coping , management toxic effect treatment breast cancer . Qualified staff include kinesiologists , physiotherapist , dietitian psychologist deliver education session . Control Group ( No Exercise Intervention ) : Participants randomize control group undergo baseline follow assessment 12 week . They contact study staff duration study period . They also ask continue regular physical activity routine medically manage per standard care Cardiologist Oncologists . All participant also complete Godin Leisure Time Physical Activity Questionnaire determine potential increase physical activity exercise control group , may account change outcome measure . All participant group also ask wear activity-tracking device , include step counter ( PiezoRxÂ® ) one week follow intervention ( 12 week ) objectively quantify daily physical activity . After program completion control group participant provide opportunity enroll exercise-rehabilitation program order opportunity benefit program . Timeline Trial : The target trial demonstrate superiority . The trial last total 12 week . All outcome ( primary secondary ) measure baseline follow intervention . Randomization : Randomization occur central site , Toronto Rehabilitation Institute , use computer generate randomization schedule allocation ratio 1:1 . Blinding : The participant blind intervention arm . Assessors outcome data analysis blind intervention arm . Analytical Plan : The principal analysis primary outcome employ intention-to-treat analysis include randomize participant randomly assign group . The primary secondary analysis include continuous variable baseline difference two group analyze use one way-analysis variance . Continuous variable outcome value two time period analyze use repeat measure analysis covariance , baseline value treat covariates . A multiple regression model also use compare study arm relative change physiological mediator ( e.g . cardiac function vascular endothelial function ) aerobic train change VO2peak relationship . These analysis conduct determine whether physiological variable mediate effect exercise training VO2peak . Finally , two separate regression model use address change VO2peak affect change quality life use two separate measure ( model A model B ) follow completion program . Significance : Outcomes investigation provide insight potential therapeutic intervention improve adverse event associate treatment breast cancer .</detailed_description>
