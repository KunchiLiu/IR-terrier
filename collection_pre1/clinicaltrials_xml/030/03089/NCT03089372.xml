	<brief_title>Effect Repeating Low Intensity Extracorporeal Shock Wave Treatment ( LI-ESWT ) Erectile Dysfunction ( ED )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This extension , 2 parallel arm , clinical trial previous study patient PDE5I users/responders randomize receive either one two shockwave treatment session per week total 6 week , without treatment interval . After complete 6-month follow first trial , ED patient screen , order identify IIEF ED domain still abnormal ( &lt; 26 ) . Afterwards , 2 group first study follow 2 different treatment protocol ( vs twice per week ) . All patient receive 6 treatment session Aries , energy level . First treatment session take place day 0-28 day 6-month follow . All patient agree sign new Informed Consent Form . Therefore , patient take 6 session week ( Group A previous trial ) switch take 6 session twice week 3 week , already treat 12 session twice week ( Group B previous trial ) treat 6 session week . Study visit duration Baseline - Visit : basic work-up take place , include medical sexual history , well lab test , indicate medical history . The IIEF-ED domain measure , well Sexual Encounter Profile ( SEP ) last 4-week period least 4 attempt intercourse ( without PDE5i use ) . The study criterion check patient eligible ( IIEF-ED domain &lt; 26 ) , receive first repetitive treatment , either day 6-month follow previous study within maximum 4 week . Treatment Visits : In treatment visit , patient receive active LI-ESWT treatment , accord study protocol . Group A receive treatment twice per week three week Group B receive treatment per week six week . Interval 2 treatment 7+2days Group B 3+1 day Group A . Adverse event change concomitant medication record . PDE5i intake prohibit throughout treatment period.At visit 6 penile ultrasonography conduct order check potential adverse event related treatment . Follow-up visit 1 - 3 ( 4 , 12 24 week post treatment ) : SEP diary return IIEF-ED domain complete 4 week prior aforementioned timepoints , PDE5i intake allow . The document visit ( protocol compliance , adverse event ) complete . At week 12 , triplex ultrasonography perform standard protocol .</detailed_description>
