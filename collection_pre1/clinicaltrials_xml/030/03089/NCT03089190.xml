	<detailed_description>For standardization , participant ask avoid excessive alcohol consumption ( 1 unit alcohol 8 pm night test day ) intense physical activity 48 hour prior test day . Also , ask consume standardized meal home later 8 pm night test day . This meal prepare deliver department . Furthermore , participant must arrive study facility morning overnight fast ( 10 pm ) use non strenuous mean transportation . Over course study ( screen ( visit 1 ) completion last test day ( visit 5 ) ) , participant allow change body weight ( ±3 kg ) , diet physical activity level ( judged sub-investigator ) . The participant weigh ask compliance additional standardization initiate test day . Possible in-compliance standardization judge sub-investigator whether result reschedule visit record protocol deviation . Participants arrive study facility morning . Compliance standardization control along registration possible adverse event use concomitant medication . During test day , participant settle together participant , separate individual table . During meal , participant settle individual feeding cubicle , see instructed talk . Visual analogue scale ( VAS ' ) complete measurement fast subjective appetite level . The test product ( capsule ) provide prior standardized fix breakfast , prior standardize fix mid-morning snack prior ad libitum meal .
