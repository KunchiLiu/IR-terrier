	<brief_summary>There considerable evidence general anaesthetic modulate brain development animal study . The impact great long duration exposure young animal . There great controversy whether animal data relevant human clinical scenario . The change see preclinical study great GABA agonists NMDA antagonist volatile anaesthetic ( eg sevoflurane ) , propofol , midazolam , ketamine , nitrous oxide . There less evidence effect opioid ( remifentanil ) alpha 2 agonist ( dexmedetomidine ) . Some , , human cohort study show association exposure anaesthesia infancy early childhood later change cognitive test , school performance risk develop neurodevelopmental disorder . The evidence weak due possible confounding . A recent well design cohort study ( PANDA study ) compare young child hernia repair sibling find evidence difference range detailed neuropsychological test . In study child expose two hour anaesthesia . The trial ( GAS trial ) compare child hernia repair regional general anesthesia find evidence difference neurodevelopment test two year age . The GAS PANDA study confirm animal data short exposure unlikely cause neurodevelopmental impact . The impact long exposure still unknown . In human strongest evidence association surgery poor neurodevelopmental outcome infant major surgery . However , also group confound likely . The aim study see new combination anaesthetic drug result well long-term developmental outcome current standard care child surgery last least 2..5 hour . Children randomise receive either low dose sevoflurane/remifentanil/dexmedetomidine standard dose sevoflurane anaesthetic . They receive neurodevelopmental assessment 3 year age ass global cognitive function .</brief_summary>
