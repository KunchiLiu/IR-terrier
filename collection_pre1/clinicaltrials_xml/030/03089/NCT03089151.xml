	<brief_summary>An interdisciplinary team extensive garden study experience conduct pilot randomize control clinical trial see whether garden reduce risk factor disease like cancer heart disease . The pilot trial provide preliminary data association human microbiome , diet , physical activity , social interaction outcome weight status key inflammatory biomarkers .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The pilot study lead development future , large randomize control clinical trial , fulfil follow aim : Pilot Aim 1 : Demonstrate feasibility recruitment ability perform study procedure . Pilot Aim 2 : Demonstrate ability measure accurately chronic disease risk factor diet , physical activity , weight gain , microbiome characteristic inflammatory biomarkers . Pilot Aim 3 : Provide preliminary result efficacy garden preventive intervention , estimate detailed power analysis propose subsequent large trial . Aim 3a : Demonstrate compare non-gardeners , gardener 1 ) great intake fruit vegetable ; 2 ) well Healthy Eating Index ( HEI ) ; 3 ) low Diet Inflammatory Index ( DII ) ; 4 ) reduce sedentary time increase moderate-to-vigorous physical activity ( MVPA ) ; reduce age-associated weight gain . Aim 3b : For gardener non-gardeners , sample garden soil , gut , skin , oral microbiome six time point April September characterize compare bacterial load , pathogenic taxon , taxonomic diversity , relative dominance , indicator taxon , metabolomic result . Aim 3c : Demonstrate gardening reduces inflammatory biomarkers link heart disease cancer , include CRP , IL1b , IL4 , IL6 , IL10 , TNFa , effect gardening mediate diet , weight gain , physical activity characteristic microbiome .</detailed_description>
