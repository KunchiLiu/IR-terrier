	<brief_summary>Different subtypes serrate lesion recently describe . Among , sessile serrate polyp/adenoma ( SSP/A ) traditional serrate adenoma ( TSA ) could malignant potential serrate pathway CIMP . These lesion , potential source interval cancer , also consider colorectal cancer ( CRC ) population-based screen program . It believe new describe pathway could responsible 30 % CRC . Unlike traditional adenoma , serrate lesion difficult diagnose particular endoscopic appearance still unclear histological criterion . Furthermore , specific molecular change , , could evolve CRC faster adenoma . The real prevalence serrate lesion specific risk develop new synchronous/metachronous lesion , even malignancy , remain unknown . For reason , n't know patient could constitute different CRC-risk group specific recommendation need follow-up . This prospective longitudinal study develop within framework CRC-screening program Valencian Community ( Spain ) . We expect include total 700 individual follow 10 year . In study , collect epidemiologic variable relate patient , variable related polyp , mutational ( BRAF , KRAS , MSI ) , CpG-island methylation status serrate lesion . Strict endoscopic histological criterion apply diagnosis serrate lesion . All lesion detect index colonoscopy follow-up evaluate . The purpose study correlate epidemiologic data , histological characteristic molecular profile serrate lesion finding follow-up , order define stratify group accord risk develop new lesion CRC future .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>BACKGROUND Colorectal cancer ( CRC ) , frequency consequence , relevant public health problem lead implementation population screen program many country . The purpose program reduce incidence mortality CRC early diagnosis disease , so-called pre-symptomatic phase . That , identify remove precursor lesion , essentially colon adenoma . However , increase evidence program fully effective prevent CRC . Cancers appear next scheduled endoscopic control , call interval cancer ( IC ) , occur 2.5 / 1000 patient / year observation , cumulative probability develop CRC within first 5 year adenoma removal could 2 % . Recent study suggest cause 50 % ICs failure detect premalignant lesion colon , either due poor colon preparation , technical deficiency performance colonoscopy characteristic lesion make barely visible . A possible origin ICs could serrate polyp ( SP ) . This actually single lesion , heterogeneous group lesion , different conventional adenoma , characterize serration crypt histology . Serrated lesion , especially subgroup , macroscopic feature make particularly difficult detect conventional colonoscopy : indistinct border , cloud-like appearance , often cover mucous cap interruption underlie mucosal vascular pattern . But true diagnosis serrate lesion make morphological criterion microscopic examination sample obtain biopsy . Although lesion show feature initially identify hyperplastic polyp ( HP ) , last decade three subtypes serrate lesion different clinical implication describe [ HP , sessile serrate polyp/adenoma ( SSA/P ) traditional serrate adenoma ( TSA ) ] . However , histological criterion yet fully clarify , confusion term use . Therefore , agreement among pathologist generally poor . As consequence , many serrate lesion misdiagnosed incorrectly classify . This clinical relevance since malignant capacity . Both SSA/P TSA evolve CRC so-called serrate pathway cytosine-phosphate-guanosine ( CpG ) island methylator phenotype ( CIMP ) , could responsible 30 % CRC . In pathway , aberrant hypermethylation genome produce , lead transcriptional silence inhibition expression gene promoter region ( epigenetic modification ) . CRCs arise SP homogeneous may different molecular histological characteristic depend whether origin mutation precursor lesion occur BRAF Kirsten rat sarcoma ( KRAS ) gene , lead development SSA/P TSA . And depend mutL homolog 1 ( MLH1 ) gene methylation produce thereafter , unstable ( MSI ) stable ( MSS ) CRC develop . The presence high CIMP rate also depend initial mutation . Therefore , serrate lesion could originate MSI/CIMP-H CRC ( 11 % ) , MSS/CIMP-H CCR ( 4 % ) MSS/CIMP-L CRC ( 15 % ) . It think ICs may directly relate SP share morphological molecular characteristic . The evolution SSP/SSA invasive carcinoma describe occur eight month . This theoretical risk develop advanced premalignant lesion IC clinical significance clearly show clinical practice data prevalence serrate lesion limit also lack longitudinal follow-up study patient serrate lesion . The prevalence describe variable range 0.6 % 13 % , depend study , data even scarcer fecal occult blood test ( FOBT ) -based screen population . The presence serrate lesion ( HP ) associate development advance synchronous adenoma colon , also advance metachronous lesion follow-up . This situation could place patient special risk group . Patients large SP may similar risk develop future CRC patient advance adenomas . Most Scientific Societies recommend endoscopic follow-up serrated lesion , evidence weak specific interval propose base expert recommendation . In summary , still many unresolved question serrate polyps importance CRC screening program . Their prevalence CRC screen population fully clarify lack prospective trial difficulty diagnosis histological classification . Their malignant potential clarify either uncertainty prevalence dysplasia serrate lesion , lack well-designed longitudinal study detection metachronic lesion . The current criterion classify lesion seem weak define CRC risk specific patient , thus propose follow-up interval base strong scientific evidence . A thorough study serrate lesion relate molecular histological characteristic lesion find colonoscopic follow-up could establish new molecular classification aim design patient-oriented follow-up strategy . HYPOTHESIS The correlation epidemiological data patient , histological characteristic molecular alteration SP colon , along finding endoscopic follow-up , would allow identify stratified group patient accord risk develop advanced lesion CRC future . OBJECTIVE - To deepen knowledge histology genetic alteration SP thereby try establish molecular classification may serve basis new endoscopic follow-up guideline . These recommendation would reliable adjusted patient 's individual risk profile . - To establish prevalence serrated lesion , especially SSP/SSA SSP dysplasia , FOBT positive CRC screen population .</detailed_description>
