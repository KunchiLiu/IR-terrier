	<brief_title>Low Intensity Extracorporeal Shock Wave Treatment Erectile Dysfunction : Standardisation Treatment Protocol</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This randomize , 4 parallel arm , clinical trial 18-month recruitment period . All patient PDE5I users/responders . After 1 month wash-out period , ED patient screen , order randomize 88 men vasculogenic ED , International Index Erectile Function ED ( IIEF-ED ) domain score 6-25 abnormal penile triplex-based hemodynamic parameter ( peak flow velocity &lt; 35cm/sec ) last 6 month . Additionally , ask complete SEP diary . Patients randomize receive shockwave treatment ( 12 session subject ) , either twice week ( total 6 week ) three time week ( total 4 week ) energy level 4 7 , without treatment interval . Study visit duration Visit 1 ( day 0 ) : basic work-up take place , include medical sexual history , well necessary lab test , need . One month wash-out period follow . During period , subject ask avoid drug relate ED ( PDE5i ) least 2-4 attempt intercourse . Furthermore , patient undergo triplex ultrasonography , unless already do last 6 months.Also penile dimension flaccid erect state measure . Visit 2 ( day 28 + 3 day ) : patient complete IIEF-ED domain randomize one four parallel study group , use online program . Groups A C receive treatment twice per week , energy level 4 7 respectively . Groups B D receive treatment three time per week , energy level 4 7 respectively . PDE5i use prohibit throughout study . Treatment Visits : There 12 active treatment visit 4 Groups . Patients receive LI-ESWT , accord study protocol . Interval 2 treatment 3+1 day Groups A C ( twice/week ) whereas 1+1 day Groups B D ( three times/week ) . At visit 6 12 penile ultrasonography conduct order check potential adverse event related treatment . Follow-up visit 1 - 3 ( 4 , 12 24 week post treatment ) : Patients complete IIEF-ED questionnaire return complete SEP diary last 4 week prior every visit . Visit data also record ( protocol compliance , adverse event ) . At Week 12 , triplex perform standard protocol . For Week 4 + 3 day visit window , whereas week 12 24 + 2 week visit window .</detailed_description>
