	<brief_summary>Hemodynamic measurement obtain pulmonary artery catheterization essential diagnosis classification pulmonary hypertension . Traditionally , right heart catheterization ( RHC ) do supine position . Cardiac output know change significantly base position , due effect gravity venous return . There systematic investigation postural effect pulmonary arterial pressure effect diagnosis pulmonary hypertension . It intent study difference measurement obtain RHC patient supine , seat , stand .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Postural Changes During Right Heart Catheterization</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The investigator also plan prospective study patient refer pulmonary artery catheterization UNC cardiac catheterization lab evaluation know suspected pulmonary hypertension . The purpose portion study evaluate degree digital reading pulmonary artery pressure ( PAP ) pulmonary capillary wedge pressure ( PCWP ) impact diagnosis classification pulmonary hypertension specifically patient evaluate pulmonary hypertension test supine , sit stand position . The investigator identify 60 patient refer right heart catheterization evaluate know suspected pulmonary hypertension . Patients right heart catheterization perform clinician planning perform procedure pulmonary hypertension specialist Division Pulmonary Critical Care Medicine Division Cardiology . After informed consent obtain , subject prepped draped per protocol UNC Cath lab . Their internal jugular vein visualize ultrasound accessed pulmonary artery catheter use standard procedure also use fluoroscopy ensure correct placement catheter . Once pressure measurement obtain cardiac chamber pulmonary artery , catheter secure place tegaderm allow mobilization patient . The patient ask sit side cath table pressure transducer re-calibrated level patient 's right atrium . Repeat measurement obtain pulmonary artery PCWP position . After , patient ask stand pressure transducer re-calibrated estimate level right atrium ; new measurement obtain stand position . Each position maintain 5 minute measurement take . The supine position measurement use clinical decision making purpose per usual . The investigator collect measurement least 10 cardiac cycle use mean end-expiratory value ensure precision . Once measurement obtain , patient ask return supine position . The tegaderm release catheter remove sustained expiration maneuver per standard protocol . No sedation administer patient . No contact do study subject purpose research trial .</detailed_description>
