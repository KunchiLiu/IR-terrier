	<brief_summary>Amputation injury fingertip common age . For decade know conservatively treat fingertip regenerate skin soft tissue form functionally cosmetically excellent new fingertip . Unfortunately , little known mechanism control ability , human , confine fingertip . Even less known bacteria regularly colonize wound without noticeable negative impact regeneration heal . Medical evidence fingertip regeneration human largely limited retrospective study case report . This study first randomize controlled trial conservative treatment fingertip amputation child adult . When manage without surgery , self-adhesive polyurethane film dressing commonly use establish wet chamber around injury . This provide best condition tissue regeneration inhibit formation scar tissue time . Unfortunately dress offer mechanical protection , stick wet skin leak malodorous wound fluid . The investigator therefore develop silicone finger cap deal problem offer mechanically protect , wet chamber around injury optimal regeneration condition . This finger cap also offer puncturable reservoir excess wound fluid , route routinely analyze diagnostic research purpose . This randomize controlled trial first time test acceptance , safety efficacy novel medical device comparison conventional self-adhesive film dressing gather information clinical course outcome conservatively treat fingertip amputation injury . Based sample size calculation primary outcome , 22 patient old 2 year enrol within 24 hour suffer injury distal distal interphalangeal joint comprise layer skin substance defect primarily adapt without shorten finger plastic surgery . Participants randomly assign start treatment first two week either conventional film dress novel silicone finger cap . They change modality another two week patient guardian decide , would want film dress finger cap rest treatment .</brief_summary>
