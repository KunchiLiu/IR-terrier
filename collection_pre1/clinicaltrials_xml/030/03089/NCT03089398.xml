	<brief_summary>The purpose study learn treatment option well patient multi-vessel coronary artery disease ( blockages one vessel supply blood heart muscle ) . The treatment option study compare : ( 1 ) Hybrid Coronary Revascularization [ HCR ] ( combination surgery catheter procedure open clog heart artery ) ( 2 ) Percutaneous Coronary Intervention [ PCI ] ( catheter procedure alone open clog heart artery ) . There new `` experimental '' procedure test study : HCR PCI well-established procedure regularly perform patient coronary artery disease . The study propose use rigorous scientific method result high level certainty procedure best patient coronary artery disease .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The increase prevalence coronary artery disease ( CAD ) , advance coronary artery bypass grafting ( CABG ) , percutaneous coronary intervention ( PCI ) , concomitant medical therapy , cost revascularization result rise interest regard appropriate indication alternative coronary revascularization . Hybrid coronary revascularization intend combination CABG PCI . The HCR strategy combine graft leave anterior descend artery ( LAD ) coronary artery use leave internal mammary artery ( LIMA ) PCI non-LAD coronary stenosis . Essentially , stent substitute saphenous vein graft ( SVG ) non-LAD lesion , surgical LIMA LAD bypass perform , ideally limited access , minimally traumatic approach . Unfortunately , publish data date HCR must consider limited hypothesis generate . Clinicians , payer , patient interested specific benefit revascularization alternative . HCR scientifically validate approach would major healthcare impact . The ability deliver new therapy CAD provide durability , without obligatory trauma prolong recovery time characteristic conventional CABG would major advance field cardiovascular medicine . The NHLBI-funded Hybrid Observational Study demonstrate equipoise exists two coronary revascularization paradigm ; however , rigorously design randomized clinical trial need provide sufficient evidence guide clinical decision make important patient population . This trial prospective , multi-center randomized comparative effectiveness trial HCR compare multi-vessel PCI patient multi-vessel CAD involve LAD LM territory . The trial design `` large , simple '' trial , baseline , procedure-related short-term outcome data collection extract exist registry data ( Society Thoracic Surgeons [ STS ] Data Registry National Clinical Data Registry [ NCDR ] Cath/PCI databases ) . The overall objective trial evaluate effectiveness safety Hybrid Coronary Revascularization ( HCR ) compare multi-vessel PCI drug-eluting stent ( DES ) patient multi-vessel coronary artery disease involve Left Main and/or Left Anterior Descending artery . The primary objective trial determine whether hybrid coronary revascularization associate reduction Major Adverse Cardiac Cerebrovascular Events [ MACCE ] compare PCI DES . The secondary objective determine impact HCR compare PCI health status quality life .</detailed_description>
