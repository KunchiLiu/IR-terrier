	<brief_summary>To compare physiologic benefit rejuvenate RBCs ( rejRBCs ) standard RBCs ( PRBCs ) , investigator emulate critical condition safely maximize stress cardiovascular system , elective , feasible volunteer study . VO2max measure anemic , post-donation , pre-transfusion state , also transfuse 18-day-old , autologous blood randomize standard storage standard storage rejuvenation . The investigator hypothesize transfusion standard PRBCs less effective increase oxygen delivery ( measure VO2max ) compare transfusion rejRBCs</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>VISIT A ( Day 0 - Screening ) Written informed consent obtain subject respond IRB-approved advertisement/flyer fulfill eligibility requirement . The following video help explain study : vimeo.com/167291799 . Individuals respond IRB approve advertisement/flyer ( uploaded eIRB ) give information study ask read IRB approve consent form . An investigator designee obtain write informed consent individual participating study , adequate explanation method , objective , potential hazard study . The investigator designee also explain subject completely free refuse enter study free withdraw time . A copy sign consent form give subject . After subject provide write informed consent , ask answer several question 2 write questionnaire ( uploaded eIRB ) order confirm eligible donate blood . These question similar routinely ask people prior blood donation . These focus upon keep risk blood donation low possible level . VISIT B ( Day 2 - Blood donation ) Rex Blood Services ( RBS ) , Raleigh , NC , register licensed US FDA accredit American Association Blood Banks ( AABB ) manufacture RBCs blood product . Two unit blood withdrawn subject accord standard double , AS-3 , apheresis unit , mark autologous donation , purchase Duke Transfusion Services , arrange medical director RBS ( Tim Carter , MD ) . RBC handle storage meet FDA AABB standard ; unit store Duke Transfusion Services c/o Dr. Poisson . VISIT C ( Day 16 - `` Anemic '' VO2 max ) Three minute rest baseline measure record start exercise . The subject begin pedal cycle ergometer cadence 75 rpm . Resistance manually set accord standardize , progressive protocol . A rating perceive exertion ( RPE ) obtain end exercise stage . Vital sign record every 3 minute , ECG monitor continuous . Exercise terminate subject reach volitional fatigue . VO2max report high oxygen consumption average two 30-second period , typically occur last stage progressive maximal exercise test . Maximum heart rate heart rate near VO2max . To minimize variability VO2max testing procedure , 2 facilitator ( engineer/technician research nurse/coach ) present every test . VISIT D ( Day 18 `` Anemic '' VO2max - Transfusion ( Tx ) `` post-Tx '' VO2max ) Duke Transfusion Services randomize subject receive 2 unit standard PRBCs rejRBCs 120 minute use standard infusion pump . All unit wash equalize transfusion volume ; rejuvenation include mandatory wash step . Vital sign monitor record every 15 minute . After 2-hour rest light snack , exercise test repeat . Laboratory testing : The p50 measure one blood unit transfuse subject exercise test . Radial arterial access obtain serial cardiac output monitoring ( LiDCO Pulse Contour Analysis , LiDCO Products , London , UK ) , arterial blood gas analysis lactate measurement transfusion , exercise testing . Subjects blood collect hemoglobin level . After visit , subject ' participation study complete .</detailed_description>
