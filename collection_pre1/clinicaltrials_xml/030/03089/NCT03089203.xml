	<brief_title>CART-PSMA-TGFβRDN Cells Castrate-Resistant Prostate Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This Phase I study evaluate safety feasibility lentivirally transduce PSMA-TGFβRDN autologous CAR T cell administer without cyclophosphamide 3+3 dose escalation design . Cohort 1 subject ( N=3 6 ) receive single dose 1-3 x 107/m2 lentivirally transduced CART-PSMA-TGFβRDN cell day 0 without condition chemotherapeutic regimen . If number manufacture CAR T cell meet pre-specified minimum infuse dose 1 x 107/m2 cell , dose administer , subject replace study . If 1 DLT/3 subject occur , study enroll additional 3 subject dose level . If 0 DLT/3 subject 1 DLT/6 subject occur , study advance Cohort 2 . If 2 DLT/3 subject occur dose 1-3 x 107/m2 cell , enrollment Cohort stop dose de-escalated 10-fold 1-3 x 106 cells/m2 ( Cohort -1 ) . In situation , 6 subject enrol Cohort -1 . Cohort 2 subject ( N=3 6 ) receive single dose 1-3 x 108/m2 lentivirally transduced CART-PSMA-TGFβRDN cell day 0 without condition chemotherapeutic regimen . If number manufacture CAR T cell meet protocol-specified minimum 1 x 108/m2 cell , meet minimum dose requirement least 1 x 107/m2 cell , subject may receive dose include DLT assessment Cohort 2 . This subject would replace DLT assessment . If , however , number manufacture CAR T cell meet pre-specified minimum infuse dose outline Cohort 1 , dose administer , subject replace study . If 1 DLT/3 subject occur , study enroll additional 3 subject dose level . If 0 DLT/3 subject 1 DLT/6 subject occur , study advance Cohort 3 . If 2 DLT/3 subject occur , study stop declare maximum tolerate dose ( MTD ) . Cohorts 1 2 serve identify MTD CART-PSMA-TGFβRDN cell . The maximum tolerate dose defined high dose 0/3 1/6 DLTs occur . Cohort 3 subject ( N=3 6 ) receive single infusion MTD lentivirally transduce CART-PSMA-TGFβRDN cell day 0 , follow single dose 1.0 gram/m2 cyclophosphamide administer 4 day prior CAR T cell ( day -3 ± 1 day ) . If 0 DLT /3 subject occur , study enroll additional 3 patient confirm tolerability . If 1 DLT/3 subject occur , study enroll additional 3 subject dose level . If two initial three subject experience DLT , three additional patient accrue dose reduction lymphodepleting chemotherapy 500 mg/m2 administer 4 day prior CAR T cell ( day -3 ± 1 day ) . The DLT observation period 28 day . The high dose level 0/3 1/6 DLTs observe give cohort define MTD . Adverse event report begin Day 0 ( Cohorts 1 2 ) Day -3 ±1 day ( Cohort 3 ) continue 2 year infusion subject begin alternative cancer-related treatment , whichever come first . While study , subject continually reassess evidence acute cumulative toxicity .</detailed_description>
