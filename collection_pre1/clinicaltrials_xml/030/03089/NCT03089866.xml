	<brief_summary>The main goal study allow anesthesiologist make inform decision anesthetic requirement person prior start anesthesia . The preliminary data collect study support large investigation aim gain well understanding anesthetic susceptibility general elderly population appear great risk Postoperative Cognitive Dysfunction ( POCD ) POCD short-term decline cognitive function ( especially memory executive function ) may last day week surgery . In rare case , disorder may persist several month major surgery . POCD distinct emergence delirium . It occur commonly old patient pre-existing cognitive impairment . POCD common adult patient age hospital discharge major non-cardiac surgery , elderly ( age 60 year old ) significant risk long-term cognitive problem . The body 's inflammatory response surgery likely play important role , least elderly patient . We also postulate relative 'anesthetic overdose ' may significant risk factor . Hence , able make well judgment dose need individual extremely important .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Effect Sedation Cognitive Performance Elderly</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Central nervous system ( CNS ) function affect sedation anesthesia . This evident desire clinical effect sedative anesthetic drug . Recent evidence suggest disruption CNS function may prolong result unwanted cognitive effect predispose individual . We know considerable pharmacokinetic ( onset , distribution elimination ) pharmacokinetic variability neurotropic drug even person within certain age weight group . What know , predict quantify individual 's susceptibility sedation anesthesia , importantly , potential cognitive susceptibility individual 's brain drug . Auditory functional imaging well validated task . It apply short ( 5 minute ) test . We know ( preliminary data ) size brain activation area change sedation . We postulate change reflect disruption neuronal integration brain change may objective measure cognitive effect sedation individual . As supportive data R-01 grant application propose enroll 20 elderly subject public advertisement quantify effect sedation midazolam auditory activation ( auditory fMRI ) cognitive performance ( mini Mental State exam complex reaction time ) .</detailed_description>
