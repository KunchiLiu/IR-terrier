	<brief_summary>Traumatic lesion lead cause admission emergency center ( 39 % ) , isolate non-surgical low limb trauma foreground . Two recent meta-analyzes suggest value Low Molecular Weight Heparins ( LMWH ) would reduce symptomatic Thromboembolism Events ( TE ) patient low limb trauma . However , many recent study conclude need stratify TE risk accord patient nature trauma obtain individualized therapeutic decision . The retrospectively establish L-TRIP ( cast ) score allow stratification risk without take account type trauma . The TIP score ( Trauma , Immobilization Patient ) establish consensus international expert via Delphi method . We suggest application TIP score rationalize indication thromboprophylaxis patient isolated non-surgical trauma lower limb reduce rate anticoagulation prescription without increase risk symptomatic thromboembolic complication direct benefit patient medico-economic society .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Assessment Impact TIP Score Thromboprophylaxis Patients With Non-surgical Lower Leg Trauma .</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>All patient admit Emergency Departments nonsurgical isolate low limb trauma necessitate rigid semi-rigid immobilization , assess possible participation . After physician obtain no-opposition patient , fill questionnaire . This questionnaire include treatment chosen physician , type trauma , type immobilization choose , patient 's thromboembolic risk factor order calculate TIP L-TRIP ( cast ) score retrospectively . Phone follow-up occur within 3 month gather clinical event data ( sign VTE , bleed event ) .</detailed_description>
