	<detailed_description>The use videolarygoscopy ( VL ) first choice tracheal intubation versus direct laryngoscopy ( DL ) matter debate . These two method compare several study . First attempt intubation success glottic visualization VL versus DL pediatric emergency medicine provider simulate patient evaluate conclude VL associate great first-attempt success intubation pediatric emergency physician adult simulator . The ease view glottis direct vision conventional laryngoscopy quality indirectly view monitor laryngoscopy Macintosh videolaryngoscope compare multicenter study . The result VL lead well viewing condition rare case may result bad viewing condition . The study evaluate efficacy safety VL compare DL decrease time attempt require increase success rate endotracheal intubation neonate conclude insufficient evidence recommend refute use VL endotracheal intubation neonate . Diverse videolaryngoscopes also compare patient undergo tracheal intubation elective surgery : GlideScope Ranger ( GlideScope , Bothell , WA ) , V-MAC Storz Berci DCI ( Karl Storz , Tuttlingen , Germany ) , McGrath ( McGrath series 5 , Aircraft medical , Edinburgh , UK ) test whether feasible intubate trachea patient indirect videolaryngoscopy without use stylet . The author conclude trachea large proportion patient normal airway intubate successfully certain VL blade without use stylet , although three study VL 's clearly differ outcome . The Storz VL displace soft tissue fashion classic Macintosh scope , afford room tracheal tube insertion limit need stylet use compare two scope . Although VL 's offer several advantage , include good visualization glottic entrance intubation condition , good laryngeal view guarantee easy successful tracheal tube insertion . Three different videolarygoscope device compare direct laringoscopy obese patient undergo bariatric surgery : Video Mac GlideScope require few intubation attempt DL Video Mac provide short intubation time improved glottis view compare DL . A recent metanalysis state videolaryngoscopes may reduce number failed intubation , particularly among patient present difficult airway . They improve glottic view may reduce laryngeal/airway trauma . However currently , evidence indicates use VLS reduces number intubation attempt incidence hypoxia respiratory complication , evidence indicates use VL 's affect time require intubation . DM accept risk factor difficult intubation . The aim study compare VL DL adult diabetic patient require tracheal intubation anesthesia , term first-attempt intubation success , glottic view quality adverse outcomes related tracheal intubation . METHODS After obtain ethical approval write informed patient consent , consecutive patient diabetes mellitus ( DM ) require elective intubation anesthesia randomly allocate either videolaryngoscopy ( McGRATH MAC videolaryngoscope ) ( Group VL ) direct larngoscopy ( Macintosh laryngoscope ) ( Group DL ) . Age , gender , body mass index , American Society Anesthesiologists ( ASA ) physiologic classification , duration DM record . The patient evaluate difficult airway predictor follow parameter record : Malampati class , thyromental distance , sternomental distance , mandibulohyoid distance , interincisor distance , neck circumference , ability upper lip overbite lower lip overbite , presence limit neck extension . Fentanyl-propofol-rocuronium used anesthesia induction . After subsequent positive-pressure ventilation use face mask oxygen-air-sevoflurane mixture 3 min , trachea intubate accord group allocation use either DL VL . During intubation , follow data document : intubation time , number intubation attempt , use extra tool facilitate intubation , conversion another laryngoscopy method quality view glottis assess accord Cormack Lehane score system . Adverse event related tracheal intubation also evaluate : desaturation ( SPO2 &lt; 90 ) , hypercabia ( ETCO2 &gt; 35 ) , hypertension ( mean arterial pressure &gt; 20 % baseline value ) , tachycardia ( heart rate &gt; 20 % baseline value ) , new onset arrhythmia , laryngospasm , bronchospasm , airway trauma sore throat PACU ) . The primary outcome measure first-attempt intubation success ; secondary outcome measure glottic view guality , conversion another laryngoscopy method adverse outcomes related tracheal intubation .</detailed_description>
