	<brief_summary>Background : The risk ureteric injury time pelvic reconstructive surgery high 3 % American College Obstetricians Gynecologists state intraoperative cystoscopy do procedure . Intravenous indigo carmine routinely give surgery colour urine bright blue allow assessment ureteric integrity . In 2014 , indigo carmine longer available worldwide since , surgeon search suitable alternative . Vitamin B water soluble vitamin colour urine bright yellow give immediately surgery help ureteric visualization . Alternatively , 5 % dextrose water ( D5W ) use instillation fluid cystoscopy allow urine jet visualization due difference fluid viscosity . Both agent show good instillation normal saline affordable accessible Canada . Objective : To identify agent superior intraoperative ureteric visualization time cystoscopy determine difference detection rate ureteric jet use either preoperative oral vitamin B intraoperative cystoscopic distension D5W . Methods : This study three-site ( Mount Sinai Hospital , Sunnybrook Health Sciences Centre , St. Michael 's Hospital ) , double-blinded , randomize control trial whereby female patient undergo pelvic reconstructive surgery randomize receive either preoperative vitamin B intraoperative D5W cystoscopic instillation fluid . Parameters measure surgery include whether ureteric jet see , time visualization ureter , colour jet , surgeon satisfaction . Patients also see one week surgery ass urinary tract infection . Sample size calculation base previous study demonstrate need 125 patient per study arm . Anticipated Clinical Significance : The finding study relevant surgeon perform intraoperative cystoscopy ureteric visualization require . The investigator believe outcome study help make cystoscopy shorter efficient surgeon often feel pressure time constraint within operating room set . In turn , decrease time cystoscopy may reduce operate time benefit patient hospital .</brief_summary>
