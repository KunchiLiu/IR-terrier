	<brief_summary>Since strategy apply intensive care medicine , include low tidal volume ventilation , fluid resuscitation , use antibiotic , restrictive transfusion strategy bundle ventilator therapy , incidence Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome ( ARDS ) decrease recent year . However , mortality severe ARDS still high 45 % . Few medication indicate effective working development ARDS . Different disease , ARDS difficult prevent later stage like domino effect . The medication intervention use ARDS develop , include ulinastatin . The investigator hypothesize key point failure medication therapy delay time medication intervention . If give preventive strategy , ulinastatin , incidence severity ARDS might decrease . Therefore randomize controlled trial test hypothesis preventive effect ulinastatin ARDS . This multi-center , randomize , double blind , placebo control study .</brief_summary>

If give preventive strategy , ulinastatin , incidence severity ARDS might decrease . Ulinastatin urinary trypsin inhibitor ( UTI ) inhibit various inflammatory protease widely use China , Japan , Korea treatment patient inflammatory disorder , postoperative organ protection , shock , pancreatitis . Therefore randomize controlled trial test hypothesis preventive effect ulinastatin ARDS . This multi-center , randomize , double blind , placebo control study .</detailed_description>
