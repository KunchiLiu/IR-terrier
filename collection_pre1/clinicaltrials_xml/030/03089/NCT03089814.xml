	<brief_summary>Changes tissue microcirculation ischemic conditioning ( 4 cycle 5-min ischemia 5-min reperfusion ) well document . In previous study , difference change microcirculation , recovery slope occlusion slope , healthy subject cardiac surgery patient . Moreover , occlusion slope , reflect local tissue oxygen consumption ischemic period , anticipated decrease repeat ischemia-reperfusion cycle protect effect , however well-conducted study . The purpose study evaluate change microcirculation measure tissue oxygen saturation ischemic conditioning healthy volunteer cardiac surgery patient .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Changes Tissue Microcirculation During Ischemic Conditioning : Pilot Study</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Subjects male healthy volunteer ( age 20-45 ) schedule receive cardiac surgery ( age 20-80 ) undergo ischemic conditioning , consist 4 cycle 5-min ischemia pressure 200 mmHg upper extremity follow 5-min reperfusion pressure . During ischemic conditioning , change tissue microcirculation ( baseline tissue saturation , occlusion slope ischemia , recovery slope reperfusion ) observe use tissue oxygen saturation sensor attach thenar muscle hand . For cardiac surgery patient , study conduct anesthesia induction surgery day exclude potential effect anesthetic .</detailed_description>
