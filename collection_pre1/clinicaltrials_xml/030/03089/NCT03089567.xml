	<brief_title>Comparison Salivary Levels Streptococcus Mutans Pediatric Patients With Early Childhood Caries After Application Silver Diamine Fluoride 5 % Sodium Fluoride Varnish</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Dental caries common chronic disease child ( Benjamin , 2010 ) . Studies suggest positive correlation bacterial titer Streptococcus mutans dental caries ( Pannu et . al. , 2013 ) . National survey suggest child 2 5 year old 27.90 % primary teeth caries . This number near double 51.17 % child 6 11 year old ( United States , National Health Nutrition Examination Survey , 1999-2004 ) . The American Academy Pediatric Dentistry discuss prevalence , particular find caries young child , call early childhood caries ( ECC ) , define `` presence 1 decayed ( noncavitated cavitated lesion ) , miss ( due caries ) , fill tooth surface primary tooth child 71 month age young '' severe early childhood caries ( S-ECC ) , define sign smooth surface caries child young three year age ( AAPD , 2008 ) . Oral health disparity also vary race , ethnicity socioeconomic status . Among child age 3-5 year old , prevalence dental caries significantly high non-Hispanic black individual , 19 % , compare non-Hispanic white individual , 11 % . Furthermore , prevalence dental caries nearly twice high Hispanic individual , 26 % , compare non-Hispanic white individual ( Dye et . al. , 2012 ) . The use fluoride dentistry play significant role reduce prevalence severity dental caries . Water fluoridation consider one ten great achievement public health twentieth century ( CDC , 1999 ) . Sodium Fluoride ( SF ) varnish become mainstay many pediatric dental practice . Despite intend use desensitize agent , fluoride varnish use routinely inhibit demineralization enamel , promote remineralization enamel , arrest early enamel carious lesion ( Chu et . al , 2008 , CDC 2001 ) . Fluoride also interfere cariogenic bacteria 's ability metabolize carbohydrate , reduce acid production , ability adhere tooth surface , possibly reduce ability initiate decay ( CDC , 2001 ) . The ability fluoride , namely SF varnish effect bacterial count S. mutans describe limited extent literature . Chandak describe fluoride varnish 's ability reduce S. mutans count dental plaque , suggest another way fluoride aid reduction dental caries ( Chandak et . al. , 2016 ) . However , study support SF varnish abilities significantly reduce plaque S. mutans count ( Sajjan , et . al. , 2013 ) . Other study attempt examine effect fluoride varnish ' ability effect S. mutans adherence biofilm formation . In study Chau et . al , describe reduction S. mutans adhesion subsequent biofilm accumulation presence number commercially available SF varnish ( Chau et . al , 2014 ) . Similar fluoride compound , antimicrobial effect silver contain compound use dentistry nearly century . The mechanism behind compound ' antibacterial effect derive bioactive silver ion 's ability disrupt irreversibly damage vital bacterial enzyme system ( Lansdown 2006 ) . Despite use internationally since early twentieth century , silver contain compound fall favor time . More recently , silver diamine fluoride ( SDF ) , currently approve FDA treatment dentinal hypersensitivity , show posse caries arrest property . The clinical application SDF seemly vast . Average operating room ( OR ) wait time vary provider range day month depend factor provider 's availability resource , patient 's symptomatology , medical history , extent treatment . The patient population serve Yale-New Haven Hospital Pediatric Dental Center diverse demographically medically . Due demand need comprehensive dental treatment general anesthesia , average OR wait time 4 6 month . Indications OR treatment include medically complex patient , uncooperative pre-cooperative behavior profile , patient extensive multi-quadrant decay pattern , patient meet selection criterion sedation modality . SDF 's ability arrest dental decay allow patient lengthy wait list await treatment OR avoid caries progress significantly . SDF solution caries ; however useful tool stem progression decay child await surgical intervention general anesthesia . In light SDF 's ability arrest dental caries , question ability impact etiology caries initiation , namely effect salivary S. mutans count oral cavity . Few study investigate SDF 's ability alter bacterial count oral environment child . The application SDF human dentin block result development fewer colony form unit number cariogenic bacteria , include S. mutans , compare control group ( Mei , 2013 ) . Similar result describe study examine effect silver fluoride S. mutans biofilm formation ( Knight et . al. , 2009 ) . The impact effect would profound could change caries management prevention pediatric population ( Duangthip , Chu et . al . 2016 ) . The increased interest popularity SDF potential change manner dental caries treat pediatric population . Applications prevent invasive costly need general anesthesia , advance behavior management technique , possibly prevent progression decay avoid loss teeth ( Chu , 2000 ) . Furthermore , potential ability SDF affect bacterial composition oral environment , possibly reduce initiation caries excite potential ground break public health achievement . Hypothesis Application SDF carious teeth show high decrease salivary bacterial count S. mutans form baseline 2-6 year old patient ECC compare S. mutans level sodium fluoride varnish application treatment Preliminary Research Design Patient selection : Healthy 2-6 year old patient ECC await comprehensive dental treatment general anesthesia Inclusion criterion : ASA I without prior history dental restoration Exclusion criterion : Patient : special healthcare need , xerostomia , complicate medical history ( ASA II-VI ) Experimental Groups : - 30 Patients receive 38 % SDF application - 30 Patients receive 5 % NaF varnish application - 30 Patient Control group receive treatment Salivary collection : Salivary sample collect SalivaBio Children 's Swab . A baseline S. mutans level obtain quantified use Saliva-Check Mutans ( GC America ) . All carious teeth receive rubber cup paste dental prophylaxis follow either topical application 38 % SDF , 5 % NaF varnish topical treatment . Follow : Further measurement S. mutans level obtain 1 , 3 , 6 month initial SDF , NaF varnish application treatment , without dental prophylaxis . Following salivary sample collection , re-application SDF NaF varnish apply appropriate patient group , treatment provide control group .</detailed_description>
