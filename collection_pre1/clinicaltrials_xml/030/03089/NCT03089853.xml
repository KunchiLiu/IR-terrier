	<brief_summary>This prospective randomized control study test hypothesis neuromuscular electrical stimulation ( NMES ) remote pulmonary rehabilitation home offer via smart technology , call Smart TeleHealth , result reduction systemic inflammation , via reduction skeletal muscle tissue inflammation , thereby improve functional capacity , thus , reduces rate readmission follow hospitalization acute exacerbation Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease ( COPD ) . This study enroll 40 participant UAB , 30 get Smart Telehealth NMES , 10 get usual care .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The overall hypothesis proposal neuromuscular electrical stimulation ( NMES ) remote pulmonary rehabilitation home offer via smart technology result reduction systemic inflammation , via reduction skeletal muscle tissue inflammation , thereby improve functional capacity , thus , reduces rate readmission follow hospitalization acute exacerbation Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease ( COPD . ) We propose follow specific aim : Aim 1 : To determine NMES remote tele pulmonary rehabilitation intervention reduce 30-day cause readmission patient hospitalize acute exacerbation COPD . Skeletal muscle dysfunction associate number hospital admission , duration hospital stay total number exacerbation . We others show apply NMES result significant improvement quadriceps muscle strength . It plausible target skeletal muscle dysfunction result improve respiratory outcome . Based preliminary result compare exercise intervention historic data , hypothesize combination early in-hospital home NMES home pulmonary rehabilitation use smart technology prevent hospital readmission follow acute exacerbation COPD . Aim 2 : To evaluate effect NMES remote tele pulmonary rehabilitation intervention muscle strength , dyspnea respiratory quality life COPD post hospital discharge . Skeletal muscle dysfunction contribute morbidity associate acute exacerbation , result long duration hospital stay short time readmission , associate frequent exacerbation . We hypothesize prevent deconditioning , improve muscle bioenergetics positively affect muscle strength , NMES home pulmonary rehabilitation improve respiratory quality life , dyspnea functional capacity . We compare outcome measure respiratory morbidity baseline 12 week . Aim 3 : To evaluate effect NMES remote tele pulmonary rehabilitation intervention systemic muscle inflammation . Acute exacerbation COPD associate sustained systemic inflammation mechanism may perpetuation inflammation skeletal muscle reservoir . We previously show old patient COPD susceptible muscle inflammation . Based preliminary result show significant benefit , hypothesize reduce readmission rate direct effect lower muscle inflammation . We hypothesize inflammation arise lung perpetuate pro-inflammatory signal skeletal muscle sustain systemic inflammation , reduce combination early NMES exercise therapy home reduce skeletal muscle production pro-inflammatory cytokine . We perform quadriceps muscle biopsy baseline 4 week demonstrate reduction pro-inflammatory signal skeletal muscle 4 week intervention arm anticipate reduction associate reduction systemic inflammation .</detailed_description>
