	<detailed_description>Objectives : Primary Objective Explore association intensity C11-AMT PET baseline , measure mean standardized uptake value ( SUVmax lesion ) , total tumor metabolic volume , measurement intra-tumoral inter-lesional heterogeneity ) , objective response rate ( ORR ) 12 week ( define via RECIST1.1 ) pembrolizumab patient treatment-naïve metastatic melanoma . Secondary Objectives Estimate ORR ( Complete Response + Partial Response ) RECIST 1.1 12 week pembrolizumab patient treatment-naïve metastatic melanoma . Estimate progression-free survival ( PFS ) patient metastatic melanoma treat pembrolizumab front-line therapy . Explore association SUVmax , PET parameter ( e.g . total tumor metabolic volume , measurement intra-tumoral inter-lesional heterogeneity ) , use C11-AMT PET co-registered CT contrast 18F-FDG-PET baseline . Explore association SUVmax , PET parameter ( e.g . total tumor metabolic volume , measurement intra-tumoral inter-lesional heterogeneity ) , C11-AMT PET image baseline expression component IDO pathway detect immunohistochemistry ( IHC ) immunofluorescence LAT1 , IDO , TPH1 , lymphocyte subtypes ( CD4 , CD8 , FoxP3 , MDSC ) , PD-1/PD-L1 , immune checkpoint pathway ( LAG3 , GITR , TIM3 ) freshly acquire tumor specimens prior treatment pembrolizumab . Assess metabolic change week 12 follow treatment pembrolizumab use baseline week 12 18F-FDG PET . Outline : Screening : Whole body FDG PET/CT scan IV contrast perform least 24 hour C11-AMT PET scanning , per standard care . C11-AMT PET perform least 24 hour pembrolizumab treatment least 24 hour FDG PET/CT scan . After screen enrollment , treatment consist follow : Pembrolizumab 200mg IV flat dose administer 30 minute Day 1 ; Pembrolizumab dosing repeat every 3 week progression subject withdrawal reason . At end treatment : Whole body FDG PET/CT scan IV contrast . Projected Accrual : Up 25 subject receive prior therapy recent diagnosis distant melanoma .</detailed_description>
