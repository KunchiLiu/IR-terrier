	<brief_summary>Osteogenesis Imperfecta ( OI ) rare disorder cause bone break easily . People OI may break bone little trauma , dentinogenesis imperfecta ( DI ) , , adult year , hear loss . OI range severe mild . The current standard-of-care severe type OI involve use IV medication ( bisphosphonates ) surgery put rod bone strengthen . These therapy , although often life-saving , new little know long-term effect bone body system . Transforming growth factor beta ( TGF-β ) protein important bone formation . Fresolimumab antibody silence TGF-β . In study mice OI , show silence TGF-β lead high bone mass , quality strength . The purpose study determine fresolimumab safe treatment OI .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Osteogenesis Imperfecta ( OI ) rare disorder cause bone break easily . People OI may break bone little trauma , dentinogenesis imperfecta ( DI ) , , adult year , hear loss . It see gender race . OI range severe mild . Individuals severe type OI may die birth . People severe OI survive may bow arm leg , short stature unable walk . People mild form OI may break bone occasionally normal height lifespan . Breaks occur bone , common arm leg . The current standard-of-care severe type OI involve use IV medication ( bisphosphonates ) surgery put rod bone strengthen . These therapy , although often life-saving , new little know long-term effect bone body system . TGF-β protein important bone formation . Studies show increased TGF-β activity lead low bone mass strength increase fracture . Fresolimumab antibody silence TGF-β . In study mice OI , show silence TGF-β lead high bone mass , quality strength .</detailed_description>
