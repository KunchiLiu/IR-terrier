	<brief_summary>This preliminary clinical trial aim evaluate performance low-dose CT colonoscopy ( CTC ) computer aid detection ( CAD ) polyps detection compare optical colonoscopy ( OC ) , explore possible clinical routine integrate use CT colonoscopy optical colonoscopy OC colorectal cancer screening .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Colorectal Polyps Screening With Low-dose CT Colonoscopy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>CT colonoscopy ( CTC ) , also refer virtual colonoscopy ( VC ) , utilizes computer virtual-reality technique navigate inside three-dimensional patient-specific colon model reconstruct abdominal CT image , look colonic lesion , full bowel preparation colon inflation need perform CTC examination . The clinical trial consist two major part : 1 . Comparative study performance CTC OC : 50 subject recruit part write consent . With full bowel preparation , volunteer receive CT scan first inflate colon , OC follow day , necessary pathological analysis thereafter . The performance CTC base high-resolution CT data , include number polyp detect , size , position , etc , validate OC pair comparison . 2 . Integrate use low-dose CTC OC colorectal cancer screening : After validation CTC performance , part , another 50 subject recruit explore integrated use CTC OC possible efficient workflow colorectal cancer screen . In part , combination normal dose low-dose scan protocol employ ( e.g. , normal dose supine , low-dose prone ) , low-dose CTC base low-dose CT scan protocol artifact reduction technique introduce reduce radiation risk screening .</detailed_description>
