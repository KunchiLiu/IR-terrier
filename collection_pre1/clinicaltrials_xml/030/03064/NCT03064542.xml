	<brief_summary>To determine thyroid status regulate relationship brown adipose tissue ( BAT ) volume/activity , white adipose tissue ( WAT ) partition basal metabolic rate ( BMR ) hyperthyroid patient transition euthyroidism via antithyroid drug . To compare euthyroid outcome ( BAT , WAT , BMR , body composition , body weight insulin resistance ) achieve hypothalamus-pituitary-thyroid ( HPT ) set point vs. normal range plasma free thyroxine 4 ( FT4 ) throxine stimulate hormone ( TSH ) .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Study Visit 1 meant confirm participant 's hyperthyroidism due Graves ' disease via blood test call TSH receptor autoantibody ( TRAb ) . This standard test doctor routinely order part clinical practice diagnose cause participant 's hyperthyroidism part research procedure . If TRAb blood test do participant refer endocrinology clinic TTSH , investigator review result decide repeat test need . If participant confirm blood test Graves ' disease type hyperthyroidism , participant eligible take part study . However , approximately 2 teaspoon ( ~ 10 mL ) blood take baseline thyroid function test prior initiation anti-thyroid drug . Pre-menopausal woman also undergo urine pregnancy test exclude pregnancy prior participation study entry . Once participant consent participate study , participant randomize receive either carbimazole ( CMZ ) thiamazole ( TMZ ) dose accord set point-based strategy ( SPT ) strategy move participant 's thyroid function test away set point ( ASP ) still keep participant 's thyroid hormone level within normal range . Randomization mean assign participant one two group chance , like toss coin roll dice . This study also double-blind study , mean apart research coordinator , neither participant investigator know two treatment arm participant assign . Up maximum three investigator designate antithyroid drug ( ATD ) dose prescriber , investigator charge decide ATD dose require base late FT4 , FT3 TSH blood test result though investigator know test result belong . After decide appropriate ATD dose , investigator inform research coordinator turn feedback doctor in-charge alter prescribe dose ATD accordingly . On Study Visit 2 , participant ask come Clinical Nutrition Research Centre ( CNRC ) Centre Translational Medicine National University Singapore morning 0800 h overnight fast 8-10 hour . An intravenous indwelling cannula insert arm vein fast blood sample take . At first , 30 mL blood take ( 6 teaspoon ) 10 mL test thyroid function 10 mL test liver kidney function remain 10mL fast glucose , insulin lipid . The liver kidney function test do part safety lab test do Visit 2 . An additional 20 mL blood ( 4 teaspoon ) ( baseline ) take analysis marker fat metabolism protein profile reflective brown fat activity . A urine ( baseline ) sample also collect . Participants undergo anthropometry ( ie . measure body weight , height , waist hip circumference ) , non-invasive percentage fat estimation use bioelectrical impedence analysis ( BIA ) body composition evaluation use dual energy X-ray absorptiometry ( DXA ) allow quantification fat , lean bone mass . Participants undergo metabolic rate measurement whole body calorimeter couple infrared thermography ( IRT ) use thermal camera mount tripod stand focus participant 's neck area collar bone whole body room calorimeter next 45 minute . Participants next serve 8 gel capsule ( = 12 mg ) capsinoids swallow plain water . Capsinoids non-pungent , non-spicy form spice call capsaicin find chilli pepper . These substance take orally show able effectively stimulate BAT body . Use capsinoids stimulate BAT essentially safe capsinoids naturally occur plant derive substance Capsicum annuum generally recognise safe human consumption . The US FDA approve capsinoids 'Generally Recognised Safe ' ( GRAS ) status allow take food ingredient . Metabolic rate measurement IRT whole body calorimeter continue next 120 min capsinoids ingest . At end period capsinoids stimulation , another sample blood ( 20 mL ~ 4 teaspoon ) draw intravenous cannula insert arm vein earlier analysis marker fat metabolism protein profile reflective brown fat activity . Another urine sample also collect . After least 48 hour later allow washout capsinoids participant 's body 1 week , participant ask return Study Visit 3 CNRC . Participants prescribed propranolol ( PPL ) 20mg endocrinologist Tan Tock Seng Hospital ( TTSH ) instruct bring along participant take 20mg propranolol upon arrival . This drug call beta-blocker typically use treat excessive palpitation finger tremor hyperthyroidism . Propranolol dose 20mg-40mg daily thrice daily part parcel standard management hyperthyroidism Graves ' disease control tremor , anxiety , palpitation also reduce activation FT4 FT3 . At dos , propranolol show safe efficacious long contraindication bronchial asthma , decompensated cardiac failure allergy propranolol . In study , low dose propranolol 20mg use Visit 3 Visit 6 prior infrared thermography indirect calorimetry suppress BAT activity safe . The reason use propranolol suppress BAT activity detect difference metabolic rate heat signature thermograms IRT compare capsinoids stimulation . After participant take 20mg propranolol , participant undergo metabolic rate measurement whole body calorimeter IRT 120 minute . Participants proceed Clinical Imaging Research Centre ( CIRC ) also locate building basement magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) abdominal white fat , magnetic resonance spectroscopy ( MRS ) liver fat fat fraction MRI scan BAT . On Study Visit 4 , participant need come Clinical Imaging Research Centre ( CIRC ) morning overnight fast 8-10 hour fat fraction MRI scan BAT repeat last procedure Study Visit 3 . Study Visits 2 , 3 4 do within interval exceed 2 week . After , participant require go endocrinology clinic TTSH control hyperthyroidism via ATD dose accord set point target ( SPT ) away set point ( ASP ) strategy decide randomization . This may take 6 month attain stable thyroid hormone level ( FT4 , FT3 , TSH ) satisfy SPT ASP endpoint . You follow monthly TTSH endocrinologist ATD dose adjust double-blinded fashion till thyroid function test stable accord either SPT ASP endpoint . When happen , participant continue remain part research , Study Visits 5 , 6 , 7 . With exception liver kidney function test do Visit 2 , remain study visit exactly Study Visits 2 , 3 4 respectively .</detailed_description>
