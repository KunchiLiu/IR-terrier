	<detailed_description>Intraoperative goal-directed fluid therapy ( GDFT ) propose improve outcome patient undergo major surgery . In GDFT algorithm , employment fluid bolus play crucial role . Dynamic fluid responsiveness parameter , stroke volume ( SV ) response stroke volume variation ( SVV ) , precise fluid indicator specifically determine patient volume status helpful clinician determine appropriate time fluid bolus . During GDFT , fluid commonly administer maximize perfusion maintain patient blood volume plateau portion Frank-Starling curve keep patient low SV response ( i.e. , SV increase &lt; 10 % maintain 20 minute ) . However , maximization necessarily imply optimization ; role fluid maximization perfusion GDFT remain controversial.Moreover , importance intraoperative GDFT thoracic surgery rarely explore , intraoperative GDFTs conduct abdominal surgery . Acute lung injury ( ALI ) follow thoracic surgery remain major source morbidity mortality lung resection . Despite advancement surgical technique perioperative management , incidence postoperative ALI remain remarkable . Risk factor evident , include preoperative pulmonary function , type surgical procedure , intraoperative fluid management , one-lung ventilation , ventilator setting . Fluid management thoracic surgery challenging . Evidence show association excessive fluid administration development acute lung injury . Therefore , fluid restriction may benefit patient undergo thoracic surgery . By contrast , restrictive fluid management incurs risk hypovolemic state impair tissue perfusion may result organ dysfunction particular postoperative acute kidney injury . Accordingly , maintenance perfusion maximize fluid protocol may favorable . However , debate yet investigated.In study , two fluid strategy guide SV response , namely maximization nonmaximization protocol , intraoperative GDFT patient undergo thoracic surgery require one-lung ventilation . Clinical outcome perioperative change serum biomarkers oxidative injury compare two group primary secondary outcome respectively .</detailed_description>
