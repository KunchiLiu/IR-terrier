	<brief_summary>This study compare change cardiovascular , hemodynamic metabolic variable hypertensive patient receive aerobic physical training intensity determine protocol double non-exhaustive effort ( DENE ) patient receive routine outpatient care 12 week Entry study . 63 men woman participate study allocate intervention group ( n = 42 ) control group ( n = 21 ) .The follow perform : Cardiopulmonary exercise test ( TECP ) evaluation peak oxygen consumption ( VO2peak ) , oxygen pulse double product ; DENE protocol determination intensity training . It obtain record interval consecutive heart beat ( iRR ) evaluate autonomic modulation heart rate . Body mass index , waist circumference ( AC ) , hip circumference ( CQ ) Waist / hip ratio ( WHR ) measure .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The study design compare change cardiovascular , hemodynamic metabolic variable hypertensive patient receive aerobic physical training intensity determine DENE protocol patient receive routine ambulatory care 12 week enter study . Sixty-three hypertensive men woman , divide intervention group ( GI ) ( n=42 ) control group ( n = 21 ) participate study . All procedure perform trained researcher qualify staff evaluation intervention perform specialty medical outpatient clinic . After agree participate study , collect sociodemographic clinical data , body mass index ( BMI ) , waist circumference ( WC ) waist / hip ratio ( WHR ) . The participant submit cardiopulmonary exercise test ( TECP ) , evaluate peak oxygen consumption ( VO2peak ) , oxygen pulse double product . Between one seven day TECP , consecutive heart rate interval ( iRR ) record evaluation autonomic heart rate modulation use Polar model RS800CX ( Polar Electro Co.Ltda Kempele , Finland ) . . The DENE protocol determine intensity training apply GI determine training intensity treadmill . Intervention participant underwent supervise aerobic physical training pre-determined intensity , consist three weekly session , last one hour , period 12 week . Control participants receive routine care outpatient clinic period . At end 12 week , measure , record iRR interval , oxygen pulse , double product , BMI , waist circumference ( AC ) , hip circumference ( QC ) waist / hip ratio ( WHR ) obtain . All subject previously inform procedure Signed free informed consent form . The project approve Commission Research Committee Institution number 086.096 / 14 .</detailed_description>
