	<brief_summary>Objective : aim study identify risk factor associate development pyogenic liver abscess ( PLA ) adult liver recipient ( ALR ) describe experience Hospital Italiano de Buenos Aires ( HIBA ) diagnosis therapeutic management patient . Background : adult liver recipient differ general population PLA exhibit : reconstruct biliary anatomy , recurrent hospitalization , regular performance status subject immunosuppression . However , scientific evidence regard PLA develop transplanted organ still scarce management disease continue base experience non-transplanted patient . Methods : 1996 2016 , 879 adult patient underwent liver transplantation ( LT ) institution . Patients develop PLA LT ( case ) control match accord time transplant abscess 1 5 relation . The investigator perform logistic regression model establish PLA risk factor consider cluster match case control . Independent risk factor identify use multivariate regression analysis .</brief_summary>
