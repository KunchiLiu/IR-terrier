	<brief_summary>The primary aim study establish possible patient undergone major body surgery complete home base exercise training program complete assessment require measure physical cognitive function . If investigator establish feasible complete train test 's research follow use method determine whether possible improve physical function old patient undergo major abdominal surgery period follow surgery use simple exercise regimen carry home . By target physical function way investigator hope determine method improve frailty well . In turn may also positive impact health service provision .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>The Assessment Feasibility Home Based Exercise Programme Older Patient Following Major Surgery</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Frailty geriatric syndrome describe lack physiological reserve . It independent risk factor morbidity , mortality increase length hospital stay . Five criterion use describe Frailty : weight loss , exhaustion , diminish hand-grip strength , slow walk speed , low physical activity . Sarcopenia , loss skeletal muscle mass strength , key component criterion Frailty . By assess Frailty , vulnerable patient recognise early additional measure implement . Interventions ameliorate severity individual 's Frailty currently focus much attention positively impact patient physical cognitive function well-being . In turn positive impact health service provision reduce hospital length stay , morbidity mortality . The exercise programme use study incorporate High-Intensity Functional Exercise ( HIFE ) programme old individual develop Umea University Sweden exercise incorporate Help Aged Preventing Falls Programme . The exercise design perform home additional aid . The participant require begin programme discharge hospital undertake exercise three time per week . They receive instruction , help support prior discharge throughout 6 month exercise period . The participant require complete exercise diary monitor compliance programme determine feasibility home base exercise programme intervention measure . The outcome measure physical function assess Handgrip strength Step Box test plus questionnaire assess daily activity , Sarcopenia assess use Handgrip test measure muscle strength quantification muscle mass muscle ultrasound ( USS ) imaging . Cognitive function assess use validate questionnaire online cognitive test . Frailty Reported Edmonton Frail Scale . Experimental design method : Potential participant identify local multidisciplinary team ( MDT ) meeting . These hold weekly patient undergo major cavity intra-abdominal surgery discuss relevant MDT surgical speciality . Those patient meet eligibility criterion note usual care team make initial approach patient regard study . 30 participant recruit study allocate randomly either exercise intervention arm control arm study . Participants involve study approximately 8 month depend upon recruit study pre-operatively . The post-operative exercise programme run 6 month . All aspect screen process part standard NHS pre-operative assessment include National Health Service ( NHS ) blood test , ECG , clinical examination medical questionnaire . Participants ask attend five testing session , one pre-operatively four postoperatively . These session wherever possible timed plan clinic appointment schedule part standard NHS care provide surgical speciality . The first session shall occur time pre-operative assessment require participant complete assessment ( detail ) . The second session occur three day postoperatively whilst participant inpatient , physical assessment handgrip strength test shall complete . The remain three session occur 6 week , 3 month 6 month post-operatively assessment shall complete . At session blood test monitor Haemoglobin level inflammatory marker shall collect , part standard NHS care . Assessment physical function Sarcopenia : Handgrip test : Three reading ( maximal isometric contraction hand use Takei hand dynamometer ) hand record average three reading calculate . Step Box test : Participants complete three set step box step . The first set involve 10 step slow pace , second set , 20 step normal walk pace final set , 20 step fast . The height step dependent upon height participant . The time complete set heart rate stepping recovery period record . The recovery period 5 minute time take heart rate return within 5 bpm rest heart rate . Ultrasound vastus lateralis : Ultrasound image take vastus lateralis point 2/3 along axis great trochanter femur knee joint-line . At point sagittal image capture delineate anterior posterior border muscle . Muscle depth , bulk muscle pennation angle calculate . Assessment Frailty : Reported Edmonton Frail Scale : This validate frailty score system . Assessment Cognition : The Montreal Cognitive Assessment ( MoCA ) questionnaire validate cognitive screening tool screen mild moderate cognitive impairment . Computerised Cognitive test battery : This involve two computerised test , Simon test Symbol Substitution test . Questionnaires : The follow validated questionnaire use ; The Duke Activity Status Index ( DASI ) ass activity daily live , EQ5D evaluate health status , International Physical Activity - Short Form ( IPAC-SF ) questionnaire assess physical activity . Depression shall also screen use Geriatric Depression Scale ( GDS ) . Assessment Feasibility : The feasibility intervention determine interview , exercise diary 's feedback questionnaire . Removal participant study : Patients withdraw study wish withdraw consent loose capacity consent . Further develop post-operative complication cardio-vascular system , cerebrovascular system complication operative wound site . Also discontinue exercise programme either temporarily permanently . Sample size calculation : This feasibility study , current data estimate sample size .</detailed_description>
