	<detailed_description>The link chronic inflammatory bowel disease arthritis well establish . IBD associate 3 pattern arthritis ( 1 ) , one spondylarthropathy ( 2 ) . spondylarthropathies uncommon , 3-6 % patient IBD affect , radiologic sacroileitis evident 18 % patient . SpA associate IBD differs idiopathic ankylose spondylitis prevalence HLA-B27 , although high ( 20-40 % ) , significantly low typical AS , prevalence characteristically 90 % . Both inflammatory bowel disease spondylarthropathies show familial clustering may coexist . Idiopathic ankolysing spondylitis ankolysing spondylitis usually occur without overt sign intestinal inflammation . However , ileocolonoscopy study show high prevalence ( 30-44 % ) asymptomatic inflammation terminal ileum . The nature inflammation highly characteristic Crohn 's disease . Among spondyloarthropathies patient subclinical inflammation , 6 % report eventually develop clinically apparent inflammatory bowel disease . A recent review endoscopy-based study detect Crohn 's disease frequently , 18-48 % patient spondyloarthropathies 5-11 % ankolysing spondylitis.. However , conventional endoscopic radiological technique limit capacity investigate entire small bowel , could easily miss significant mucosal lesion due Crohn 's disease . Capsule endoscopy show superior conventional diagnostic technique investigation suspect Crohn 's disease . The primary objective study demonstrate safe , non-invasive technique reveal unidentified small bowel lesion asymptomatic subject spondylarthropathies ankolysing spondylitis reliably ileo-colonoscopy biopsy . Clinical implication : Spondylarthropathies , ankolysing spondylitis inflammatory bowel disease clinically , genetically pathologically link . Anti-tumor necrosis factor agent , include Adalimumab , Etanercept Infliximab , efficacious cost-effective treating spondylarthropathies ankolysing spondylitis . Since anti-TNF molecule highly effective Crohn 's disease spondylarthropathies related arthropathy , present study ideally would lead change general therapeutic practice , lead wider use molecule wide scope therapeutic success .</detailed_description>
