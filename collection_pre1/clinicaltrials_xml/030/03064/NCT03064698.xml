	<brief_summary>In uncomplicated pregnancy , uterine spiral artery undergo series structural change result low resistance uterine artery pregnancy progress . In many pregnancy complicate preeclampsia , growth restriction placental related complication , describe change occur . In pregnancy high risk placental complication , doppler measurement Uterine artery flow show reliable predictor complication . Postpartum reversal vascular change see normal pregnancy . It unclear full reversal change complicate pregnancy abnormal flow pregnancy . The investigator hypothesize Doppler uterine artery measurement complicate pregnancy show abnormality compare doppler measurement follow uncomplicated pregnancy .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Uterine Artery Doppler Changes</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The postpartum reversal pregnancy-related change uterine artery ( UA ) flow well document . While long-term vascular change note woman prior preeclampsia ( PE ) , dose- dependent manner , long-term change UA vascular resistance follow PE analyze . Moreover , regardless whether experienced PE intrauterine growth restriction ( IUGR ) , know woman elevate UA pulsatility index ( PI ) mid-pregnancy high UA well pregnancy , compare woman whose UA PI normal mid-pregnancy . The investigator propose evaluate UA flow remain abnormally high postpartum woman elevate UA flow mid-pregnancy , compare woman whose UA flow normal mid-pregnancy . This observational prospective study . The study recruit woman recently deliver undergone Uterine Doppler ultra sound ( US ) second trim pregnancy . Eligible woman undergo one post-partum ultrasound examination .</detailed_description>
