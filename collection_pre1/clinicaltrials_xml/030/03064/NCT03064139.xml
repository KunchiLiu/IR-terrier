	<brief_title>Mindful Walking Intervention Knee Osteoarthritis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>People knee osteoarthritis low level physical activity , especially walk activity . They also walk abnormal walk biomechanics associate great knee loading . Therefore , important increase level walk activity people knee osteoarthritis , also change walk pattern reduce knee loading . This study last 12 month participant randomize 2 group . For first 6-months , half participant attend session community location include train mindful walking technique . The half meet frequency duration community location education osteoarthritis management ( focus symptom management , importance physical activity , weight management , etc. ) .
