	<brief_summary>There great variability susceptibility one person another , less one hundred sexual exposure HIV result infection . In addition , recent trial method prevent HIV - include vaccine microbicides - actually increase HIV acquisition among trial participant reason fully understand . While know immune difference genital line important determinant whether person infect sexual HIV exposure , n't know enough difference able accurately assess person 's individual HIV risk . Therefore , development safe non-invasive laboratory test estimate person 's susceptibility genital tract would useful clinical study new HIV prevention tool .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Heterosexual intercourse common mode transmission HIV , risk HIV acquisition exposure low study assess HIV risk must huge sample size . The goal study assess suitability prototype pseudovirus assay identify early HIV target cell female genital tract , use cervical cytobrush sample collect healthy woman , optimize assay sensitivity . This novel HIV entry assay may overcome need large sample size directly measure susceptible person use sample similar PAP test . The assay perform immune cell obtain cervical cytobrush enables assessment HIV cell entry within 24 hour . If assay work , technique may potential assess impact clinical parameter stage menstrual cycle , sexually transmitted infection treatment HIV susceptibility female genital tract . Therefore , assay may serve important monitoring tool clinical trial HIV prevention , serve invaluable intermediate endpoint ass HIV acquisition risk , rather rely actual participant HIV seroconversion/infection .</detailed_description>
