	<brief_summary>Legionnaires ' disease ( LD ) relatively common pneumonia France ( 1200 cases/year ) , 98 % case hospitalize 40 % require intensive care unit ( ICU ) admission . Risk factor may predispose acquisition LD well know . Some study suggest genetic factor may also enhance susceptibility LD . The mortality rate remain high ( 10 % 33 % ICUs ) despite improve diagnostic therapeutic management patient . Few prospective study assess factor associate LD outcome , particularly death , involve limited number patient . In multicentre cohort study , investigator recently identify risk factor associate high mortality female sex , age , ICU stay , renal failure , corticosteroid treatment enhance pro-inflammatory status , assess high C-reactive protein level ( PMID : 22005914 ) . Other factor suspect involvement formally demonstrate include high infectious bacterial load , particular virulence Legionella strain , vivo selection mutant resistant prescribed antibiotic . Disease progression highly variable one patient another , usually remain unpredictable . There objective criterion predict prognosis patient . The clinical course patient LD remain difficult predict predictive biomarkers yet characterize demonstration presence mutant antibiotic vivo never do . The main objective study correlate L. pneumophila load ( detected PCR ) clinical outcome LD infection . Clinical severity measure SOFA score ( Sepsis -Related Organ Failure Assessment ) PELOD score ( Pediatric Logistic Organ Dysfunction ) . Secondary objective identify new host bacterial biomarkers associate poor outcome LD .</brief_summary>
