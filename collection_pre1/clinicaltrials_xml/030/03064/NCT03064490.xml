	<detailed_description>Enrolled patient receive three dos neoadjuvant pembrolizumab ( 200 mg administer intravenous infusion 30 minute every 3 week ) . The first dose pembrolizumab administer approximately 14 day prior initiate radiotherapy . The second dose administer three week later ( week 1 chemoradiation ) . The third dose administer 3 week later ( week 4 chemoradiotherapy ) . Pembrolizumab give every 3 week may give time systemic therapy . All patient receive radiation treatment ( 45Gy 25 fraction 1.8 Gy/fraction ) use image-guided radiation therapy concurrent , weekly carboplatin ( AUC 2 ) paclitaxel ( 50mg/m2 BSA ) . Restaging perform per standard care approximately 4-8 week complete chemoradiotherapy . Resection perform approximately 6-12 week complete chemoradiotherapy per standard care . Postoperatively , three additional cycle pembrolizumab ( 200 mg every 3 week ) administer adjuvant therapy .</detailed_description>
