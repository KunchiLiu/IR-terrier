	<brief_title>Early Prediction Major Adverse Cardiovascular Events Using Remote Monitoring</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Accurate assessment cardiovascular risk essential clinical decision make benefit , risk , cost alternative strategy must weigh ahead choose best treatment individual . Existing multivariable risk prediction model vital component current practice , remain logical standard new risk marker must add compared.7 The study describe herein applies practical framework assess value novel risk marker identify patient report outcomes ( PROs ) , patient report informatics ( PRIs ) ,8 biomarkers form protein lipid . Though purpose study largely exploratory , take preliminary step toward answer question : `` Do new PRO- , PRI- , and/or bio-markers add significant predictive information beyond provide establish cardiac risk factor ? '' STUDY AIMS Aim 1 : To measure cross-sectional correlation PRIs , PROs , MACE biomarker candidate , establish MACE biomarker surrogates know closely predict MACE ( e.g . ultra-high sensitive troponin I [ u-hsTnI ] , brain natriuretic peptide [ BNP ] , high sensitivity C-reactive protein [ hsCRP ] , assay 1 ) . Hypothesis 1 : PRI metric , PRO measure score , Candidate Biomarkers correlate MACE biomarker surrogate . Justification : Usual care may identify subtle clinical change precede MACE . In order justify future effort employ remote monitoring scale predict MACE , first evaluate evidence basic , cross-sectional correlation PRIs , PROs , know MACE surrogate biomarkers . Aim 2 : To measure longitudinal relationship PRI metric , PRO measure score , Candidate Biomarkers , change MACE surrogate . Hypothesis : Changes PRI metric , PRO measure score , candidate biomarkers predict change MACE biomarker surrogate . Justification : If change PRI metric , PRO measure score , candidate biomarkers predict longitudinal change MACE biomarker surrogate , provide biological plausibility remote surveillance may predict MACE ; would justify large trial remote digital monitoring vs. usual care suggest concept merit . Exploratory Aim 2b : To assess improvement risk prediction provide risk marker identify aim . Hypothesis : Using PRI- , PRO- , Bio- marker predictor combination establish risk factor provide incremental prognostic information compare model use establish risk factor alone . Additionally , perform in-depth proteomic bioinformatics analysis use baseline sample explore potential molecular mechanism drive MACE . Specific Aim 3 : To estimate cost-effectiveness budget impact remote monitor MACE . Hypothesis : The incremental cost remote monitor offset downstream saving engender early precise prediction unexpected costly MACE stable moderate-risk IHD . Justification : Precision Medicine innovation must cost-effective order scale across health system receive payer support . Using summary result study , create hypothesis-generating cost-effectiveness , cost-utility , budget impact model estimate project return investment remote monitoring . Importantly , model evaluative nature involve patient-level data - let alone identifiable information - sort .</detailed_description>
