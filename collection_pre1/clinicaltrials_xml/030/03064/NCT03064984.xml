	<detailed_description>The rationale use eye drop prepare blood source mainly base content growth factor ( Growth factor , GF ) , play important role regulation many process involve normal heal damage corneal epithelium . The used product far eye drop prepare serum ( Autologous Serum , AS ) platelet-rich plasma ( Plasma Rich Platelet , PRP ) peripheral blood take patient . More recently , treatment introduce homologous source undoubtedly offer advantage compare autologous source . In particular homologous source show : - invasiveness patient , could time like repeat withdrawal - applicability even patient underlie systemic condition . They may contain blood , among others , high level pro-inflammatory factor , consequence poor inappropriate final product prepare deliver eye - reliability , since homologous product prepare , control , also validate microbiological profile standardize advance , keep frozen dispensation - conceptually unlimited availability product dispense - versatility therapeutic indication , base different GF level estimate advance The purpose study evaluate effect two product derive two different blood source ( cord blood collect birth placenta umbilical vein adult subject donor peripheral blood ) treatment severe keratopathies .</detailed_description>
