	<brief_summary>The aim study evaluate impact rotational thromboelastometry ( ROTEM® ) -based transfusion protocol postpartum hemorrhage ( PPH ) vaginal cesarean delivery . Maternal transfusion requirement , quantitative blood loss ( QBL ) , need intensive care unit ( ICU ) admission , length hospital stay evaluate . The utilization ROTEM® transfusion management identify patient develop early coagulation change hypofibrinogenemia disseminate intravascular coagulation . Our hypothesis earlier identification direct therapy coagulation change low overall transfusion requirement ( pack red blood cell , fresh frozen plasma , fibrinogen concentrate , cryoprecipitate , product ) , reduce need ICU admission , shorten length hospital stay . A cost analysis perform .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Rotational Thromboelastometry Transfusion Management Postpartum Hemorrhage After Vaginal Cesarean Delivery</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Postpartum hemorrhage increase incidence United States , renew interest target approach transfusion cesarean delivery . ROTEM-based transfusion PPH advocate mechanism lower overall requirement blood component transfuse low incidence transfusion-associated pulmonary morbidity small study woman undergo cesarean delivery . However , larger-scale randomized evaluation transfusion approach warrant woman experience hemorrhage vaginal cesarean delivery . A low serum fibrinogen level ( &lt; 200 mg/dL ) onset PPH positive predictive value 100 % progression severe PPH . However , serum fibrinogen test turnaround time one hour therefore useful acute management PPH . ROTEM provide point-of-care result validate surrogate marker serum fibrinogen , within 10 minute . However , whether ROTEM data alters empiric management acute PPH unknown . A comparison transfusion management decision cost incur transfused product transfusion-related morbidity ( duration hospitalization , intensive care unit , respiratory complication ) perform .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>American Society Anesthesiologists ( ASA ) II III health status ( minimal systemic disease ) , age 18 50 yr , singleton pregnancy admit labor delivery anticipate actual PPH , anticipated transfusion blood product . This define one follow eligibility criterion : 1 . Cesarean delivery moderate high risk PPH ( see ) . 2 . Cesarean delivery acute PPH &gt; 1000 mL blood product order blood bank . 3 . Vaginal delivery acute PPH &gt; 500 mL blood product order blood bank . For criterion # 1 , moderate risk PPH define one follow feature : prior cesarean delivery labor prior cesarean delivery know adhesive disease placenta multiple gestation &gt; 4 previous vaginal birth chorioamnionitis maternal temperature &gt; 101 degree Fahrenheit history previous PPH large uterine fibroid ( &gt; 5 cm ) second stage labor ( 10cm cervical dilation delivery ) &gt; 3 hour High risk postpartum hemorrhage define one follow feature : suspect placenta accreta predelivery ultrasound finding placenta previa ( current resolve within 4 week delivery ) lowlying placenta active bleeding admission prior delivery know coagulation defect prior delivery include inherit ( hemophilia A , von Willebrand disease , thrombocytopenia , ) iatrogenic cause ( anticoagulation therapy ) , refusal accept blood transfusion ( Jehovah 's Witness , ) .</criteria>
