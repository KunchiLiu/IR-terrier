	<brief_title>Patients ' Views Outcomes Following Total Knee Arthroplasty : Focus-group Study</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Knee osteoarthritis ( OA ) major cause disability around world ; common chronic condition primary care UK . By 2030 predict great cause disability general population . An effective end-stage treatment knee OA knee-replacement surgery , first do 1970s 1980s . In England Wales , number knee-replacement procedure record National Joint Registry 2013 91,703 , represent increase 0.9 % 2012 . The data analysis National Joint Registry Office National Statistics suggest , 2030 , primary Total Knee Arthroplasty ( TKA ) increase 117 % 2012 level . Subsequently , TKA revision surgery expect increase incrementally 332 % . There similar estimation demand revision TKA surgery United States ; 2030 , expect rise 601 % 2005 level . The United States estimation primary TKA growth 673 % 2005 level , similar England Wales 's upper-limit projection . Post-TKA , 75-85 % patient report satisfaction surgery outcomes , remain 15-25 % dissatisfied .Total knee arthroplasty 's success traditionally evaluate surgeon 's perspective , e.g . presence surgical complication implant survival . This gradually change involve patient measure health outcome decision-making process . Patient-reported outcome measure ( PROMs ) evolve explore patient perspective monitor quality care health organization conduct clinical trial outcome . More half patient ' early concern post-total knee arthroplasty ( TKA ) consider commonly use patient-reported outcome measure . This may support current medical outcome evaluation post-TKA implication differ patient perspective . This may explain dissatisfaction patient post-TKA . So , sensitive patient experience assessment method require , rather profession-driven tool . Patients ' experience perception current outcome measurement post-TKA poorly understood . In order explore area qualitative method appropriate , facilitate collection in-depth experience perception individual specific phenomenon , case , outcomes post TKA . Specifically , phenomenological approach allow collection diverse unique patient experience outcomes post-TKA . A focus group useful explore poorly understood area , outcome experience post-TKA , order generate possible finding hypothesis . It advantage one-to-one interview interaction among group member provide extra dimension gather data wider degree spontaneity patient view express , contrast one-to-one interview interaction limit patient researcher depend patient response . Interaction group set allow patient refine view light others ' view facilitate spontaneous expression . Support feeling group member similar experience encourage less verbal individual contribute one-to-one interview . Only three previous study use focus-group method explore patient experience post-TKA . Studies Westby et al . ( 2010 ) Van Egmond et al . ( 2015 ) combine result patient experience post-total knee arthroplasty post-total hip arthroplasty , support accuracy patient group encounter different problem . The third study , Zacharia et al . ( 2016 ) , assess outcome least three year post-TKA limited age range 60-65 year manual labourer low medium socioeconomic status . An appropriate well-structured methodology require explore patient experience outcomes post-TKA , clear sample population criterion facilitate possible correlation finding . To best knowledge , study explore patient experience outcomes post-TKA use focus-group discussion one year surgery explore whether factor might help u understand patient medical outcome measurement good satisfy , vice versa . Exploration potential barrier functional recovery may support future modification might improve outcomes post-TKA . Project objectives - To gain in-depth understanding experience perception patient outcomes post-TKA explore whether factor might help u understand patient ' medical outcome measurement good satisfy , vice versa . - To gain insight potential barrier good functional recovery . - To identify modification make improve future outcomes post-TKA .</detailed_description>
	<criteria>Patients undergone primary unilateral total knee arthroplasty within last year . Maximum postoperative achievement one two year . Patients read understand English , nonEnglish speaking patient exclude study avoid language barrier . Purposive sampling use recruit relevant patient answer research question ; mixed gender explore genderexperience difference . mixed work retire explore return work barrier patient family support patient live alone explore value family support homecare service mixed educational level explore educational background effect . So age , gender , social , work status educational level limitation ( Schwandt , 2001 ) There possible complication present pathological condition might change recovery progression , exclude minimize confounding factor effect patient ' experience outcome , : They undergo bilateral knee arthroplasty , unilateral knee revision surgery , posttraumatic unicompartmental knee replacement . They read understand English . Their function limit due musculoskeletal involvement unilateral knee osteoarthritis . They diagnose uncontrolled diabetes mellitus blood pressure . PostTKR pathological group , neurological disorder ( stroke , Parkinson 's disease etc . ) , haemophilia psychological pathology . They morbidly obese body mass index ( BMI ) great 40 . They advance osteoporosis unstable chronic disease . They diagnose peripheral vascular disease uncontrolled cardiac disease . They present major postoperative complication , infection , fracture , acute myocardial infarction , stroke , pulmonary embolism deepvein thrombosis .</criteria>
