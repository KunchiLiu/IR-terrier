	<brief_summary>This study involve dietary supplement . Patients argininosuccinate lyase deficiency ( ASLD ) randomly assign receive either nitric oxide dietary supplement placebo 24 week , crossed-over receive treatment 24 week . The investigator assess effect supplement domains general cognition , memory , executive functioning , fine motor function individual ASLD .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Nitric Oxide Supplementation Neurocognitive Functions Patients With ASLD</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Argininosuccinate lyase deficiency ( ASLD ; also know argininosuccinic aciduria ) second common urea cycle disorder ( UCD ) account 15-20 % disorder ureagenesis . Individuals ASLD unique clinical physiologic characteristic compare UCDs . Previous work member UCDC show spite few episode hyperammonemia compare proximal blockade urea cycle , individual ASLD develop intellectual learning disability . Neurocognitive deficit observe even individual without document hyperammonemia . Furthermore , hepatic abnormality include hepatomegaly , hepatic injury , fibrosis even frank cirrhosis , vascular issue like hypertension well know disorder . Previous work member UCDC demonstrate tissue- molecular-specific role ASL generation NO . ASL require synthesis L-arginine , substrate synthesis NO , also integral member complex critical synthesis NO arginine . Loss ASL thus lead systemic tissue-specific NO deficiency , could potentially contribute complex phenotype include neurocognitive deficit . A rational therapeutic option would hence use NOS-independent NO supplement . The purpose study determine whether dietary NO supplement , Neo-ASA , would improve general cognition , memory , executive functioning , fine motor functioning , attention individual ASLD . In single-center trial , double-blind , randomize , placebo-controlled , crossover study , individual ASLD assign receive medication contain NO dietary supplement 24 week placebo 24 week . General cognition , memory , executive functioning , fine motor function assess compare end treatment placebo Neo-ASA .</detailed_description>
