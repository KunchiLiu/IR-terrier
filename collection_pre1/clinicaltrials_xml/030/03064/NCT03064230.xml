	<brief_summary>The Female Athlete Triad medical condition often observe physically active girl woman , involve 3 component : ( 1 ) low energy availability without disordered eating , ( 2 ) menstrual dysfunction , ( 3 ) low bone mineral density . An early intervention essential prevent progression serious endpoint include clinical eating disorder , amenorrhea , osteoporosis affect quality life patient even compromise athletic performance . All patient , age 14 40 year , meet inclusion exclusion criterion , prospectively enrol observational study divide two group : Athletes agonist ( Experimental Group Group A ) woman perform agonistic sport ( Control Group Group B ) . In group patient , investigator administer two type questionnaire : standardize quality Life questionnaire , validate Italian ( SF-12 ) screen questionnaire recommend Female Athlete Triad Expert Panel .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>From January 2016 May 2016 investigator consider eligible consecutive woman , age 14 40 year , come undergo routine physical examination . The institutional internal review board approve study . Inclusion criterion : I ) age 14 40 year ; II ) absence malignancy ; III ) inform consent obtain patient ; IV ) previous surgical , chemotherapic and/or radiotherapic treatment . investigator exclude patient presented condition could alter quality life : I ) recent trauma ; II ) recent surgery ; III ) oncologic history ; IV ) uncontrolled systemic illness ; V ) severe uncontrolled infection ; VI ) mental illness ; VII ) pregnancy . All patient meet inclusion exclusion criterion prospectively enrol observational study divide two group : Athletes agonist ( Experimental Group Group A ) woman perform agonistic sport ( Control Group Group B ) . Were consider agonist athlete enrol Group A patient meet definition competitive sport athlete adopt Italian Ministry Health ( Ministerial Decree , D.M . 18/02/1982 - Circular No . 7 01/31/1983 ) : `` form sporting activity systematically and/or continually practice , especially organize National Sports Federations , Sporting Promotion body recognize CONI Ministry Education regard Youth Games National level , achievement certain level sportive performance '' . All woman consider athlete include control group ( Group B ) . To assess sample size , order detect difference 3 point SF12-questionnaires , use Cohen formula , consider power 80 % ( two-tails ; P = 0.05 Long Rank Test ) : 100 patient necessary group detect statistically significant difference . In patient accurate gynecological history record special focus menstrual irregularity , age menarche present . It also investigate presence gynecological symptom affect athletic performance patient , pain menstruation ( dysmenorrhea ) form pelvic pain . A registration medication history take , include medication affect menstruation /or bone mass density ( BMD ) , contraceptive pill contraceptive agent . Moreover patient underwent evaluation every physical characteristic could suggestive eat disorder , low body mass index ( BMI ) , weight loss , orthostatic hypotension , swell parotid gland presence callus proximal interphalangeal joint ( also know Mark Russell ) . Finally accurate record previous episode bone stress , injury fracture record . In group patient two type questionnaire administrate : standardize quality Life questionnaire , validate Italian ( SF-12 ) screen questionnaire ( Female Athlete Triad Expert Panel recommend screen integral part athletes routine physical assessment ) aim identification apparatus-specific dysfunction ( Female Athlete Triad ) . Even last questionnaire still validate Italian , questionnaire ( SF-12 screen ) administer Italian . SF-12 questionnaire consider reliable measure perceive health describes degree general physical health status mental health distress . It consist 12 item , derive physical mental domain . SF-12 consider alter score &lt; 40 , either physical mental function point view , mean 50 standard deviation 10 usually achieve general population . The screening questionnaire focus main risk factor lead decrease quality life woman early detection medical dysfunction relate female triad . investigator use two different cut-off consider questionnaire alter : 1 ) alteration least two item questionnaire ; 2 ) alteration least two item questionnaire , question 6,7 8 ( relate eat disorder ) consider one . If either one two questionnaire result altered , would arise suspicion physical evaluation , patient send in-depth assessment order verify presence clinical dysfunction . Finally data record database . The incidence prevalence gynecological disorder calculate . Spearman correlation test use assess altered level quality life correspond alteration screen questionnaire alteration screen questionnaire effectively correspond , in-depth clinical assessment , clinical dysfunction . Correlation coefficient whose magnitude 0.9 1.0 indicated variable could consider highly correlate . Correlation coefficient whose magnitude 0.7 0.9 indicated variable could consider highly correlate . Correlation coefficient whose magnitude 0.5 0.7 indicated variable could consider moderately correlate . Correlation coefficient whose magnitude 0.3 0.5 indicated variable low correlation . Correlation coefficient whose magnitude &lt; 0.3 little ( linear ) correlation . The sensitivity , specificity , positive ( PPV ) negative ( NPV ) predictive value , accuracy screen questionnaire assess presence clinical dysfunction calculate , use physical examination 'gold standard ' . The sensitivity , specificity , positive ( PPV ) negative ( NPV ) predictive value , accuracy screen questionnaire assess presence alteration quality life calculate , use SF-12 questionnaire 'gold standard ' . All continuous data express mean standard deviation . All variable quantitative compare use Student 's test Mann-Whitney , depend distribution pattern . Qualitative variable compare use Chisquare Fisher test . For statistical comparison , statistical significance set P &lt; 0.05 . Statistical analysis perform use software Medcalc Â© statistical software ver . 12.4.0.0 .</detailed_description>
