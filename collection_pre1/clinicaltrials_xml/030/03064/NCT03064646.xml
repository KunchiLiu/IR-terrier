	<brief_summary>PRONAR trial aim assess treatment organ preservation stage II III rectal cancer complete almost complete response neoadjuvant treatment feasible safe environment . The main objective project implement organ preservation strategy treatment rectal cancer environment within clinical study allow analysis result term survival . The secondary objective ass local relapse , distant relapse quality life .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>After pathology confirm rectal cancer patient stage II III ( MRI , CT endoscopy ) identify first visit Medical Oncology Department . Patients receive appropriate neoadjuvant treatment accord clinical guideline . Response neoadjuvant treatment assess MRI . Those patient complete response MRI , confirm endoscopy , offer `` watch wait '' strategy . Patients complete response MRI , almost complete response endoscopy , offer transanal endoscopic microsurgery . All patient complete near complete response sign inform consent study entry . Radical surgery perform patient without complete almost complete response criterion neoadjuvant treatment . Patients organ preserve strategy subject intensive follow schedule , include MRI endoscopy , compare patient radical surgery . As complete histopathologic response rate neoadjuvant treatment locally advanced rectal cancer approximately 15-20 % , consider approximately 40 patient locally advanced rectal cancer diagnose annually set , approximately 6-8 patient per year could potentially recruit project , reach initial sample 30 patient evaluation . The following result analyze : - Percentage complete almost complete response . - Percentage watch wait transanal endoscopic microsurgery . - Disease free survival . - Overall survival . - Local relapse rate . - Distant relapse rate . - Treatment outcomes relapse . - Colostomy free survival . - Quality life . All data obtain patient 's medical record</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Patients confirm histopathological diagnosis rectal adenocarcinoma . Patients treat neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy neoadjuvant radiotherapy associate induction chemotherapy . Patients evidence complete near complete response criterion completion neoadjuvant treatment ( approximately 8 week later ) . Response criterion base digital rectal examination , flexible rectoscopy MRI . Evidence distant metastasis .</criteria>
