	<detailed_description>Prebiotics , include inulin-type fructans ( ITFs ) group naturally occur plant carbohydrate store various amount tuber , bulbs tuberous root several edible fruit vegetable particularly large amount tuber Helianthus tuberosus ( Jerusalem artichoke ) Cichorium intybus ( chicory ) . Because unique structural property , hydrolyze enzyme upper intestinal digestive tract reach colon unchanged , therefore classified prebiotics . Prebiotics define selectively fermented ingredient allow specific change composition and/or balance microbiota . ITFs , particularly mixture short- long-chain polymer , indicate several beneficial effect , include positive change histological picture intestine ( proliferation crypt Goblet cell , long intestinal villus ) modulation endocrine immune function . Moreover , great potential agent improve maintain balanced intestinal microbiota lumen mucosal surface , one bifidobacteria lactobacilli come great prominence . This , so-called healthier flora , provide increase resistance gut infection may also immuno-modulatory property . Until , inulin fructooligosaccharide ( FOS ) test mainly animal model inflammatory bowel disease ( IBD ) . Reports animal colitis model suggest prebiotics anti-inflammatory property reduce inflammation symptom , along increase bifidobacteria lactobacilli number , report , increase concentration butyrate gut . Prebiotics known substance affect beneficially organism restore intestinal microbiota balance , stabilize intestinal barrier modulate endocrine immune function . In many person suffer celiac disease ( CD ) , despite gluten-free diet ( GFD ) , impaired intestinal barrier functionality , accompany alter intestinal microbiota ongoing intestinal inflammation observe . For reason , prebiotics could promise low-risk adjuvant dietetic management CD . It hypothesize Synergy 1 consume CD child supplement GFD affect beneficial intestinal permeability intestinal microbiota without side effect . The primary objective randomize placebo-controlled study determine effect 3-months consumption Synergy 1 versus placebo , supplement GFD , intestinal permeability CD child , particular concentration intestinal fatty acid bind protein ( iFABP ) biomarker intestinal permeability . The secondary objective determine effect Synergy 1 versus placebo apply GFD change gut microbiota quantity metabolism CD child .</detailed_description>
