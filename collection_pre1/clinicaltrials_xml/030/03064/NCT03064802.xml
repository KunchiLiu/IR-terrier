	<brief_title>Burst Biologics Spinal Fusion Registry</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Spinal fusion surgery remain common intervention despite increase prevalence various motion preservation alternative stabilization device patient unresponsive conservative treatment experience back and/or leg pain decrease function/quality life . Donor site morbidity availability limit use autogenous bone past two decade ' surgeon interest alternative bone graft steadily increase . Bone morphogenic protein , synthetic bone graft substitute , various allograft product widely available surgeon . Limitations use allografts past mainly attribute less optimal donor screen process technique remove viable component need aid bone heal process . In recent year , focus scientific advance various allograft process technique allow retention various viable cytokine , growth factor , cell population result enhance osteogenic osteoinductive property . Rigorous donor bone screen meticulous test virtually eliminate risk disease transmission . A unique proprietary cryoprotection processing technique ( ProgenokineÂ® ) allograft tissue develop Smart-Surgical , Inc. complete line allograft product create market Burst Biologics ( dba ) . In addition , rigorous standardize laboratory assay technique statistical analysis provide consistency uniformity biologically active component Burst allograft product . This prospective registry design observational study ascertain commercially available Burst Products use surgeon perform spinal fusion well determine relevant patient outcome .</detailed_description>
