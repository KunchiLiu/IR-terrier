	<detailed_description>Chronic kidney disease ( CKD ) affect 5-10 % world 's population , equate ~740 million people worldwide . End stage renal disease ( ESRD ) result progressive loss kidney function patient require dialysis replace typical function kidney . The quality life ( QOL ) individual severely impaired result various complication associate CKD ( e.g . heart disease , diabetes , muscle wastage , decrease fitness ) . In attempt combat decrease physical fitness , many study apply long term exercise intervention . However , acute response exercise population entirely understood comprehensive set guideline informs safe effective exercise prescription lacking . The use exercise therapeutic intervention ESRD grown popularity , evidence provide numerous long term study indicate cardiopulmonary , metabolic inflammatory system adaptation . Despite positive finding , specific mechanism exercise benefit patient yet fully establish . In addition , extent 'normal ' physiology acutely alter dialysis treatment , effect aerobic exercise may , unknown . In patient ESRD , study aim characterise acute physiological response exercise different condition . In , study aim inform development guideline safe effective intra-dialytic exercise training .</detailed_description>
