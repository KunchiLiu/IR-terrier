	<brief_title>A Novel Approach Inpatient Pediatric Physical Activity Measurement - The 6th Vital Sign</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Purpose : A nearly universal aspect hospitalization loss physical activity due confinement bed , deconditioning , respiratory compromise , pain recovery comprise multifactorial component return activity , adequate pain control , overall neurologic function . Assessment recovery surgery ability return full , normal activity previously dependent upon subjective clinical evaluation subject observer-to-observer variability , selection bias , variable interpretation qualitative description movement . Bedside assessments utilizing accelerometer could change clinical practice readily available , quantifiable , reliable highly accurate data healthcare provider make day-to-day decision medical care , . The present study aim establish feasibility clinical use 3-axis accelerometer measure physical activity hospitalize child abdominal surgery . Methods : Participants : The target study population 25 English- Spanish-speaking child age 3-18 undergoing elective abdominal surgery anticipate overnight hospitalization least one day . Children must freely ambulatory without pre-existing mobility-limitations . Study enrollment recruitment occur Lurie outpatient urology pediatric surgery clinic 6 month period . Parental/guardian consent obtain preoperative clinical visit . Accelerometers Actigraph accelerometer ( model GT3X ; Pensacola , FL ) obtain Lurie Consortium Lower Obesity Chicago Children ( CLOCC ) . Study participant ask wear accelerometer location throughout study period unless contraindication maintain location require relocation ( e.g . interference IV access ) . Location preference wrist . Patients wear accelerometer continuously ( except bath ) 7 day prior surgery , accelerometer remove operation place back patient immediately operation 14 day postoperative . Accelerometers mail child 10 day preoperatively whose surgery schedule &gt; 2 week preoperative clinic visit along return envelop return accelerometer postoperatively ; child schedule surgery within 2 week preoperative clinic visit provide accelerometer clinic visit . Accelerometers return postoperative clinic visit within 8 day surgery mail back postoperative clinic visit 8 day postoperative . Actigraph software purchase allow preprogramming accelerometer begin collection data 1 week prior plan surgery date . Reminder phone call place remind patient start wear accelerometer 1 week prior surgery . Accelerometer movement count data epoch measure 5-second interval .</detailed_description>
	<criteria>Children age 318 undergoing elective surgery anticipate overnight hospitalization least one day Any child nonambulatory , preexist mobility limitation , doctorordered physical activity limit &gt; 48 hour post surgery . Also , patient surgery schedule less 7 day protocol call accelerometer worn 7 day presurgery</criteria>
