	<brief_title>Integrating Touchscreen-based Geriatric Assessment Frailty Screening Adults With Multiple Myeloma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>With rapid advance research , clinicians challenge remain current evolve treatment supportive care guideline management Multiple Myeloma , particularly old adult present various degree vulnerability treatment complication . The global population rapidly grow , number people &gt; 80 year expect quadruple 2000 2050 . According International Myeloma Working Group ( IMWG ) , 60 % multiple myeloma ( MM ) diagnose nearly 75 % death occur patient 65 year age.1 Older patient experience toxicity , especially multidrug combination , historical treatment approach old adult MM include dose reduction avoidance treatment base age performance status alone , despite poor predictive value variable patient outcomes . Recent study conclude chronological age important consideration make treatment decision hematologic malignancy , functional status predictive treatment outcome . Thus important factor variable beyond age treatment old adult MM patient population , include functional physical performance comorbidity . The Comprehensive Geriatric Assessment ( CGA ) global health evaluation old adult extend beyond disease-focused evaluation order identify unrecognized issue amendable intervention may prevent future problems.4 The CGA use predict toxicity survival patient use domain comorbidities , function , cognition , polypharmacy , social support , depression and/or psychological distress . Most study patient solid tumor hematologic malignancy . However , evidence support use CGA predict risk adverse event prognosis . A modified Geriatric Assessment ( mGA ) tool utilized age , functional status determine assessment activity daily live ( ADLs ) instrumental activity daily live ( IADLs ) , plus comorbidity status use develop Palumbo Frailty Index ( FI ) . Frailty state cumulative decline many physiological system result diminish resistance stressor . The FI categorize patient group fit , intermediate fit , frail . In retrospective analysis data 867 old adult MM , toxicity , treatment discontinuation , survival rate correlate FI . To date , study investigate prospective ability Palumbo frailty index predict toxicity treatment outcome older adult MM . As result retrospective validation work , fit/frailty status evaluate usefulness clinical set gather information mGA provide data care provider guide treatment decision . The use decision aid care treatment decision rapidly grow , give aid show reduce decisional conflict , improve patient-clinician communication , improve alignment value choice , reduce use low value intervention . Use decision aid grow interest shift value-based cancer care model . Value-based cancer care model require engagement patient well understand patient goal ensure patient counsel risk benefit various treatment option . For old patient , GAs routinely perform complex time-consuming , optimal tool administer GA accurately efficiently establish , many clinician lack knowledge incorporate GA decision-making care old adult , integration GA Health Information System platform adequately studied feasibility usage . Hurria colleague develop Cancer Specific Geriatric Assessment ( CSGA ) , short assessment specifically capture data seven domain ( functional status , comorbid medical condition , psychological state , cognition , nutritional status , social support , medication ) . This CSGA assessment take average time 27 minute complete . Two recent small study evaluate feasibility touchscreen computer base GA , majority old adult study able complete assessment . However , assessment still take average 20-27 minute complete , may feasible incorporate typical clinical workflow . In one study , although majority assessment domains patient report , half patient require assistance complete touchscreen questionnaires.12 A modified Comprehensive Geriatric Assessment ( mCGA ) develop use study improve upon feasibility GA within typical clinical workflow . mCGA domains chosen panel gero-oncology expert consultant ( Drs . Palumbo , Mohile , Wildes ) base predictive ability , length , ability assess via patient self-report . The Palumbo frailty index choose core mCGA tool use study give development specifically old adult multiple myeloma . In addition 4 mGA measure comprise Palumbo FI ( age , comorbidity , ADL , IADL ) , GA variables also add mCGA use study , choose base strong predictive ability determine toxicity survival cancer patient , well feasibility collection routine clinical practice . In particular , variable need complete Cancer Aging Research Group 's ( CARG ) `` Chemotherapy Toxicity Calculator '' ( http : //www.mycarg.org/SelectQuestionnaire ) collect study , give strong predictive ability old adult solid tumor . Despite suggestion GA/frailty index could use guide therapy selection , ability effectively incorporate use GA 's real-world clinic environment yet establish . Thus , study , seek describe feasibility use short mCGA tool , administer via patient self-report touchscreen computer , well real-time use utility clinician impact mCGA result treatment decision-making . These data quantitatively assess review patient record , Carevive platform extract treatment data , well uniquely design questionnaire evaluate physician use perceive utility GA part treatment decision-making process , gain insight improve utility application GA clinical practice . By streamline validate GA tool mCGA , include domain show predictive outcome ( survival toxicity ) , incorporate use point care , Carevive ePRO provide opportunity gather richly contextualized data patient experience well address gap quality cancer care . This prospective single arm pilot intervention study , use post-test quasi-experimental study design . Patients provider participate study intervention complete post-intervention questionnaire design evaluate feasibility , usability/acceptability , physician use utility result modify Comprehensive Geriatric Assessment ( mCGA ) , administer via electronic tablet old adult multiple myeloma ( MM ) treatment decision-making time point , display back clinician clinic visit treatment decision discuss . A combination provider report retrospective chart review use assess actual treatment decision make time intervention visit . Patient completion summary display mCGA physician main study intervention . To promote informed utilization mCGA result , clinician also participate continue education topic ) treatment MM old adult , well b ) use mCGA guide treatment decision-making supportive care older adult cancer . The tool use collection patient-reported clinical variable comprise mCGA Carevive electronic patient report outcome ( Carevive ePRO ) platform . This ePRO platform collect ePRO clinical data , process rule engine enables display result back clinicians dynamic summary . The mCGA use method determine frailty status patient well give global picture patient ' functional medical status , consistent goal geriatric assessment . Providers complete post-test measure evaluate feasibility intervention well , ) provider report treatment recommendation make patient ( roll basis intervention visit directly Carevive Dashboard ) , b ) way mCGA result influence treatment decision patient ( treatment decision making questionnaire , roll basis follow intervention visit ) , c ) usability/acceptability ( comprehensive post-test questionnaire , one-time follow completion patient enrollment ) use/utility ( treatment decision making questionnaire , roll basis follow intervention visit ) mCGA-based intervention , use question adapt Cox colleague , Berry colleague , Mullen colleague expand investigator develop question . Provider questionnaire administer via surveymonkey.com , survey host website , paper .</detailed_description>
