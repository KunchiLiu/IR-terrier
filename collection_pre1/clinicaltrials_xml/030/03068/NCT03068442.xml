	<brief_summary>The invesigators propose clinical study patient undergo carotid surgery ( endarterectomy ) . The invesigators determine carotid artery imaging feature associate ( 1 ) vessel wall inflammation , ( 2 ) downstream brain inflammation , ( 3 ) cognitive benefit surgery . This project uncover link inflame carotid plaque downstream brain inflammation . The invesigators also determine carotid plaque image feature predict cognitive benefit carotid surgery .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>The Role Large Artery Plaque Imaging Features Predicting Inflammation Cognition</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This research direct major stroke source , carotid artery , major vessel supply blood brain . It long know carotid narrow important stroke risk factor . However , many patient narrow carotids stroke , many patient seemingly normal carotids stroke . MRI research suggest carotid wall stroke source . Using carotid MRI , clinicians identify previously invisible marker unstable carotid plaque , include carotid wall bleeds ( intraplaque hemorrhage ) . The working hypothesis patient unstable carotid plaque may higher inflammation carotid artery brain . This inflammation implicate disease , include dementia . Carotid wall bleeds easily see carotid MRI , often invisible ultrasound CT scan . By use MRI , invesigators find silent killer important stroke risk factor even without carotid narrowing . Now image detect carotid wall bleeds , bleeds come ? Recent research point inflammation within carotid wall . The invesigators plan use histology detect inflammation vessel wall . Another question , inflammation carotid wall lead inflammation brain ? Using PET scan , invesigators plan determine whether inflammation brain link carotid disease . Lastly , invesigators hope find carotid wall inflammation contribute memory loss surgery beneficial patient . The invesigators hope detect inflammation vessel wall brain patient develop stroke , memory loss dementia . This huge benefit detection disease , would also allow clinician monitor treatment effect carotid disease brain inflammation . The invesigators also hope use tool detect early treatment response . This research accelerate pace future clinical trial bring important new medication patient sooner .</detailed_description>
