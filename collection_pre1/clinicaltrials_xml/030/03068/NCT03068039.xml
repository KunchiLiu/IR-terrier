	<brief_summary>Breakfast porridge make milled grain commonly eat worldwide . Traditionally different grain use different country . For example , oats common Anglo-Saxon country whilst millet common part India Africa . However nutritional value different grain potential effect body may vary dramatically : example effect blood sugar , fast stomach empty eat full people may feel . RESEARCH QUESTION : The investigator think pearl millet breakfast cause small rise blood sugar compare oat breakfast contain number calorie . The investigator also think difference full people feel fast stomach empty . These 2 breakfast feed one 26 healthy volunteer , one week apart . A safe medical imaging method ( MRI ) use look quickly breakfast empty stomach affect small bowel . Blood glucose level measure use finger prick test ( use diabetic ) small blood sample take vein arm measure chemical release gut feed gut hormone .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Background : Porridge breakfast various grain staple source energy many population worldwide . The grain use porridge differ region , mostly due crop historically grow . For example , oats common Anglo-Saxon country whilst millet common part India Africa . Consumption whole grain associate variety health benefit range low blood glucose level , improve insulin response , reduce cholesterol increase diversity microbiota . Of particular interest study recent suggestion different grain , particularly millet grain , may enhance health benefit glucose insulin metabolism . This may due different rate digestion absorption , example , grain specific difference starch digestibility . This could affect gastric emptying , turn , post prandial glycaemia impact satiety . However little know possible difference gastric empty breakfast porridge different grain possible relationship glucose , insulin appetite . The research group Nottingham world-leading expertise image food body gastrointestinal function use non-invasive Magnetic Resonance Imaging ( MRI ) techniques particularly well suit kind investigation study . Aims : 1. collect data postprandial glucose level hormone peptide response isoenergetic breakfast porridge make oat pearl millet . 2. collect data gastric empty satiety . 3. compare postprandial glucose level , gastric empty satiety treatment 4. explore relationship glucose level , gastric empty satiety . Experimental protocol method : 26 healthy volunteer participate 2-way study . They attend one morning study , study separate approximately week . Before test meal , approximately every 15 min 2 hour level sugar ( glucose ) blood measure use finger prick method , diabetic commonly monitor blood sugar . Venous blood sample also collect cannula place forearm measure gut hormone Peptide YY , GIP , GLP-1 insulin . The subject scan research dedicate 1.5T MRI scanner . The subject scan baseline , immediately test meal every 30 minute 2 hour postprandially . At baseline every time subject come MRI scanner asaked rate feeling fullness , hunger appetite 100mm VAS scale . Each subject feed two isoenergetic breakfast meal -one visit : Oat Pearl millet breakfast porridge source supermarket food manufacturer . These cooked water avoid confound factor milk . The test breakfast 220 kcal ( slightly high commonly recommended average portion ~185 kcal ) . After subject ask eat much pasta meal wish note much eaten objective measure food consumption . The subject also complete food diary rest day . Measurable endpoints/ statistical power Primary endpoint : Incremental Area Under Curve post prandial blood glucose 2h ( AUC2h ) Secondary endpoint : Area Under Curve post prandial gastric volume 2h ( AUC2h ) , postprandial hormone peptide response , insulin post prandial VAS score 2h . Descriptive exploratory measurement : Time Peak blood glucose ; Area Under Curve appetite ( Fullness , Hunger , Prospective food consumption ) 2h . The amount pasta meal eat ad libitum . Energy intake day food diary . Correlations blood , MRI satiety data . Using Satiety data ( Hunger ) pilot study , calculate sample size need use crossover , pair design alpha=0.05 power 80 % use n=26 participant . The data assess normality use Shapiro-Wilk test method appropriate . Where normally distribute , endpoint assess use parametric method . T test ( primary endpoint ) AUC2h ( secondary endpoint ) . T test Time Peak . Correlation ( Pearson 's Spearman ) blood glucose , MRI satiety data .</detailed_description>
