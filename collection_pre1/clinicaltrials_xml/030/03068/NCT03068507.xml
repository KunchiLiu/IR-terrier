	<brief_summary>The process enhance individual 's functional capacity optimize physiologic reserve operation withstand stress surgery coin prehabilitation . This prospective randomized control trail , design explore patient take thoracoscopic lobectomy lung cancer benefit family trimodal prehabilitation strategy . Trimodal prehabilitation include exercise , nutrition supplement physiology management preoperatively . It start day patient decide take surgery day surgery , last 2~3 week hospital . And follow-up patient 8 week surgery investigate trimodal prehabilitation strategy improve postoperative functional recovery，reduce complication improve prognosis .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>The Impact Trimodal Prehabilitation Strategy Patients Undergoing Thoracoscopic Lobectomy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This prospective randomized control trail , focus impact family prehabilitaiton strategy patient undertake thoracoscopic lobectomy lung cancer . The process enhance individual 's functional capacity optimize physiologic reserve operation withstand stress surgery coin prehabilitation . It confirm trimodal prehabilitation strategy include exercise , diet psychology guidance could improve postoperative functional recovery surgery patient undergoing colorectal resection . But research impact trimodal prehabilitation operation . Although many clinical study confirm preoperative exercise patient undergo lung cancer surgery safe useful , far study investigate perioperative functional capability population undergo thoracoscopic lobectomy . And study extends preoperative exercise trimodal prehabilitation add nutritional psychological management . In addition , prehabilitation strategy previous study usually take 4~8 week . However , patient suspect malignant tumor often would n't wait long period . We therefore design study investigate 2~3 week family trimodal prehabilitation strategy benefit patient undergo thoracoscopic lobectomy lung caner . There 100 patient await elective thoracoscopic lobectomy primary lung cancer recruit research Peking Union Medical College Hospital . After informed consent obtain , patient divide two group randomly , prehibilitation group control group . The prehabilitation group receive individual trimodal prehabilitation strategy complete assessment , include physical exercise , nutritional optimization , psychological therapy , well conventional guidance . The length prehabilitation determine wait time till surgery alone . The control group receive conventional guidance , include preoperative anesthesia assessment , drug treatment recommendation chronic disease , quit smoking abstinence . Both group also provide useful information anesthesia surgery process . The functional capability examine group several time point ( baseline , day surgery , 1st , 2nd 3rd day postoperatively , 4 week postoperatively 8 week postoperatively ) The primary end point functional walking capacity measure 6 minute walk distance ( 6MWD ) 4 week postoperatively . The secondary end point include lung function improvement ( baseline vs. preoperative ) ， self-reported physical activity , health-related quality life scale prognosis information ( postoperative complication , length hospital stay , ICU stay time , hospitalization expense , etc . ) .</detailed_description>
