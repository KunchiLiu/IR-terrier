	<brief_summary>Cardiovascular disease ( CVD ) associate high healthcare cost , well lead cause mortality hospitalization . The main challenge today 's researcher develop new technology , may help improve diagnosis CVD , thereby reduce healthcare cost quality patient ' life . Non-invasive wearable electronics offer new capability diagnosis management patient CVD . Several report wearable electronics publish , achieve positive result high accuracy . Aim study show utility biomedical shirt-based ECG monitoring patient CVD different clinical situation use Nuubo® ECG ( nECG ) system .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Biomedical Shirt-based ECG Monitoring</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The study investigator-initiated , multicentre , prospective observational trial . The study carry 2 tertiary university hospital cardiology ward ( adult pediatric ) . The study consist four independent group patient whose ECG monitor use biomedical shirt . The study group follow : patient pulmonary vein isolation ( PVI ) , cardiac resynchronization therapy ( CRT ) recipient , patient cardiac rehabilitation myocardial infarction , pediatric patient supraventricular tachycardia ( SVT ) electrophysiology study ( EPS ) . Approval study group obtain institutional review board . ECG platform The system consist biomedical shirt , electronic device ECG software . The biomedical shirt capture electrocardiographic signal via textile electrode integrate garment . The biomedical shirt enable non-invasive reception medical-quality ECG signal adherence textile electrodes skin . The biomedical shirt-ECG monitoring base BlendFix® sensor electrode technology capable use real-time continuous record . To shirt attached electronic device transmits ECG signal ( well signal include accelerometer GPS ) via bluetooth computer store information memory card . The software allow visualisation analysis data ECG , heart rate , activity index relative position body capture electronic device . The platform medical device certify European Union test patient underwent exercise echocardiography test .</detailed_description>
