	<brief_title>A Reduced-carbohydrate Diet High Monounsaturated Fats Type 2 Diabetes</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Type 2 diabetes ( T2D ) increase global problem , especially develop country . T2D associate increase risk cardiovascular disease ( CVD ) , hyperglycemia especially important microvascular damage . Previous study T2D reduce carbohydrate intake show beneficial effect glycemic control , indicate reduction HbA1c , fast insulin 2h-glucose ( OGTT ) value . However study need establish optimal diet treat T2D . The investigator wish investigate whether low carbohydrate diet , high monounsaturated fat : 1 . Improve glycemic control , dyslipidemia metabolic marker T2D despite unchanged anti-diabetic treatment . 2 . Improve endothelial function assess flow-mediated vasodilation ( FMD ) brachial artery well microvascular damage assess retinal scan , urine albuminuria minimal forearm vascular resistance ( MFVR ) . 3 . Improve Non-Alcoholic Fatty Liver Disease ( NAFLD ) assess reduction NAFLD Activity Score liver biopsy marker inflammation fibrogenesis . 4 . Improve quality life 5 . Improve gut dysbiosis The study conduct 6 month randomize control trial 135 participant type 2 diabetes . 90 participant randomize intervention group , follow LCD , 45 participant randomize control group ( regular diet diabetes , RDD ) . The described measurement conduct baseline 6 month , participant fill QoL questionnaire 0 , 3 6 month . Planned examination ultrasound assessment flow-mediated vasodilation , Dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry ( DEXA-scan ) , retina scan , liver biopsy , liver-scans , blood , urine , hair , saliva feces . Accelerometers apply , study evaluate compliance unchanged exercise pattern . Compliance diet evaluate clinical dietitian food diary .</detailed_description>
