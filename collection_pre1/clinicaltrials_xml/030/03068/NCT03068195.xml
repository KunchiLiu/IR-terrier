	<detailed_description>Background : Simple renal cyst common renal mass , occur half patient older 50 years.They usually asymptomatic benign , asymptomatic discover incidentally . However , time , simple cyst enlarge , become symptomatic develop complication , require intervention.They manage variety surgical percutaneous method , include percutaneous aspiration ( without injection sclerosing agent ) , endoscopic marsupialization excision , open surgery laparoscopic cyst excision.Percutaneous aspiration sclerotherapy describe safe effective method manage symptomatic simple renal cyst without cost morbidity associate conventional surgery laparoscopy.However , laparoscopic decortication simple aspiration associate high recurrence rate cyst wall epithelium responsible active liquid production . Purpose : To determine whether microwave ablation effective treatment simple renal cyst conventional laparoscopic decortication . Method :</detailed_description>
