	<brief_title>Assessment Lung Movement With Computed Tomography ( CT )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Interstitial lung disease ( ILD ) group lung disorder lung tissue become inflamed damage . Idiopathic Pulmonary Fibrosis ( IPF ) one subtypes ILD characteristic histological CT feature . It well know microscopic fibrosis occur lung IPF patient well structural change fibrosis become apparent CT. By combine sophisticated image analysis CT scan obtain full inspiration full expiration , may possible detect early change IPF currently possible look macro structural feature alone . With recent development new therapeutic IPF , early detection disease improve monitoring treatment efficacy become important . Using CT assess regional lung compliance potential become easily translated clinical tool .</detailed_description>
