	<brief_summary>This prospective observational study design investigate relationship brain temperature , axillary temperature , rectal temperature , bladder temperature postoperative patient brain trauma , relationship brain temperature prognosis . This study conduct base follow important assumption . First , brain temperature postoperative patient brain trauma high axillary temperature , rectal temperature bladder temperature . Second , consistency brain temperature bladder temperature well consistency brain temperature axillary temperature , well brain temperature rectal temperature . Third , brain temperature help clinician predict prognosis patient brain trauma . Therefore , brain temperature monitoring significant postoperative intensive care treatment patient brain trauma .</brief_summary>
