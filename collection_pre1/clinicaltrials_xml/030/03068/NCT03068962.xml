	<brief_summary>Dietary nitrate show health benefit include lower blood pressure ( Hobbs et al , 2012 ) , improve endothelial function inhibit platelet aggregation healthy human ( Lidder &amp; Webb , 2013 ) . The main source dietary nitrate human diet vegetable beetroot . Nitrates convert nitrite nitric oxide ( NO ) , follow reduction commensal oral bacteria reside gastrointestinal tract ( Hord , Tang , &amp; Bryan , 2009 ; Lidder &amp; Webb , 2013 ) . A recent study show follow elimination oral bacteria use chlorhexidine base antiseptic mouthwash , conversion nitrate nitrite prevent accompany statistically significant increase blood pressure normotensive subject ( Kapil et al. , 2013 ) . To date , study investigate potential role oral bacteria control blood pressure inter intra-individual difference bacterial composition .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Volunteers provide outline study ask complete medical lifestyle questionnaire ( person , email phone ) . Potentially suitable participant identify ask attend screening session study explain detail consent form sign . Anthropometric measurement take weight , height blood pressure . Subjects meet inclusion criterion invite screen session time dentist check dental disease ( e.g . current dental cavity periodontal infection ) . The oral bacteria sample collect morning site Department Food Nutritional Sciences ( Hugh Sinclair Unit Human Nutrition ) four visit day ( include screen visit ) .On day study visit volunteer need low nitrate diet , refrain strenuous exercise alcohol , drink low nitrate mineral water . They require fast overnight drink water . In morning , ask refrain brushing teeth use mouthwash . When arrive unit fast state , randomise one three treatment : - Rinse mouth low nitrate Buxton mineral water follow hold 10 ml beetroot juice ( ~6 mmol nitrate ) 5 min , - Rinse mouth low nitrate Buxton mineral water follow hold 10 ml low nitrate mineral water mouth 5 min - Rinse antiseptic mouthwash hold 10 ml beetroot juice mouth 5 min . After 5 min hold low nitrate water beetroot juice mouth , spit whole mouth rinse sterile ice-chilled tube . To evaluate nitrate reduction different area oral cavity , researcher put filter paper square soak water beetroot juice different area mouth ( rear , mid front tongue , tooth surface , buccal surface , hard palate , sublingual ) . Volunteers require keep filter paper mouth 90 second remove . Finally , oral bacteria collect 7 site slide piece sterile oral floss 2 back molar swab micro brush along buccal cervical margin premolar rear , mid , front tongue . Saliva obtain use sterile cotton swab . All sample place sterile tube ( Eppendorfs ) . Mouth rinse collect sterile ice-chilled Falcon tube . Volunteers provide light breakfast leave unit . Facilities available participant brush teeth leave clinical unit . The study visit separate least 1 week .</detailed_description>
