	<brief_summary>Donor Lymphocyte Infusion ( DLI ) follow salvage chemotherapy one widely use treatment approach patient relapse allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplant ( allo-HCT ) . However , complete remission ( CR ) rate long term survival remain poor patient , therefore , unmet need develop effective treatment approach patient relapse allo-HCT . Based initial promising result ongoing cytokine-induced memory-like ( CIML ) natural killer ( NK ) cell trial , investigator hypothesize combine CIML NK cell DLI approach significantly enhance graft versus leukemia therefore potentially provide potentially curative therapy patient otherwise extremely poor prognosis . Combining CIML NK cell DLI platform also potentially allow adoptively transferred cell persist long duration reject donor T cell CIML NK cell derive donor . The use CIML NK cell unlikely lead excessive graft versus host disease ( GVHD ) previous study associate excessive GVHD rate .</brief_summary>
