	<detailed_description>Background Trauma fatalities account 9 % world 's death , supersede number death cause HIV/AIDS , tuberculosis malaria combine , disproportionately affect low- middle-income country ( LMIC ) . Hemorrhage one lead cause preventable death among trauma patient . Up 5 % trauma patient require massive transfusion ( MT ) , define administration ten unit pack red blood cell ( PRBC ) within 24 hour injury . India LMIC lacking structure trauma care system blood product remain scarce commodity . There sizeable gap supply demand India lack four million unit blood per year accord World Health Organization estimate . The in-hospital mortality urban Indian trauma set find twice high-income equivalent inadequate resuscitation bleed control hemorrhage patient find main cause preventable death . Considering general lack blood component India reasonable assume unmet need blood transfusion trauma patient well . The extent potentially unmet need MT constitute major gap knowledge also important basis resource allocation development MT protocol suit local need , hence research question : difference predict need MT actual transfusion urban Indian trauma set ? Aim To estimate difference predict need MT provide MT adult trauma patient urban Indian setting . The hypothesis substantial discrepancy predict need provide MT , indicate unmet need blood transfusion . Study design A retrospective analysis Towards Improved Trauma Outcomes India ( TITCO ) cohort conduct . Setting The TITCO dataset include 16,047 patient enrol July 2013 December 2015 four public university hospital , namely King Edward Memorial Hospital Lokmanya Tilak Municipal General Hospital Mumbai , Jai Prakash Narayan Apex Trauma Center New Delhi Seth Sukhlal Karnani Memorial Hospital Kolkata . These hospital characterize nominal patient fee operate trauma unit . An externally employ train data collector work eight-hour shift facility gather patient data prospective observational fashion , rotate day , even night shift . Data patient admit outside hour retrieve retrospectively within day admission . The patient follow discharge death , whichever occur first . Source method participant selection Participants select consecutively study period accord aforementioned eligibility criterion , either via direct observation data collector 's shift retrospective data retrieval patient record . Covariates To estimate proportion patient predict need MT Assessment Blood Consumption ( ABC ) score use . The rationale use ABC score context base routinely record vital sign examination result available TITCO , unlike score also require laboratory result . Further , intent validate score , use informed basis identify patient substantial bleed . ABC base four dichotomous non-laboratory parameter readily available early assessment phase . Penetrating mechanism ( 0=no , 1=yes ) Arrival Systolic Blood Pressure &lt; = 90 mm Hg ( 0=no , 1=yes ) Arrival Heart Rate &gt; = 120 bpm ( 0=no , 1=yes ) Positive focus assessment sonography trauma ( FAST ) ( 0=no , 1=yes ) A score two set indicate need MT . Age , sex , mechanism injury addition variable include ABC score present characterize study sample . Data sources/measurement Where FAST record study sample report `` positive '' relevant free text term use find indication free fluid abdomen , pelvis pericardium . Where FAST record miss relevant ICD-10 code use screen free text variable report computer tomography ( CT ) intraoperative finding . The proportion patient predict need MT ( ) estimate divide number patient ABC score two total number patient study sample . The proportion actual MT receive ( b ) calculate divide number patient receive ten unit PRBC total number patient complete clinical data . Bias The data collector externally train funded project management . The data obtain direct observation retrieval patient record without interference clinical work . All data collector least health science master 's degree continuously train supervise project management . The collected data multi-institutional , likely reduce effect highly operator set dependent variable . Injury severity bias due miss data severely injured patient recognize problem trauma registry counteract imperative account many patient possible use alternative FAST positive variable would indicate ongoing intra-abdominal , pericardial pelvic hemorrhage . However , approach use surrogate FAST may also yield misleading result due overestimation . To estimate magnitude source bias sensitivity analysis conduct . In addition , ABC score originally develop validate high-income set likelihood differ demography pattern injury mechanism , possibly yield result representable true MT need study population . However , case ABC score rather use tool estimation blood need rather prediction tool aid clinical decision-making . Study size Based previous research assume 10 % patient predict need MT . In contrast , base clinical experience study setting , assume maximum 5 % receive . Assuming 10 % ( ~ 1600 patient ) predict need MT 5 % ( ~ 800 patient ) receive sample size base two-sided paired comparison proportion , i.e . two-sided McNemar 's test , need detect difference 80 % power 369 patient , set alpha 5 % beta 20 % . In word , complete observation cohort analyze , safely say study power detect difference 80 % level . Quantitative variable When characterize study sample , quantitative variable present continuous . In calculation ABC score quantitative variable arrival heart rate arrival systolic blood pressure dichotomize detailed covariate section . Statistical method All statistical analysis perform R , free open-source software statistical compute graphic . Qualitative sample characteristic present use number percentage whereas quantitative sample characteristic present median , value 25th 75th percentile , well minimum maximum value . The main analysis complete case analysis observation miss covariate value exclude . Depending amount missingness , multiple imputation use chained equation might use handle miss data . The main analysis thereafter conduct two step . First , proportion patient ABC score ≥ 2 , i.e . patient predict need MT calculate . Thereafter proportion patient actually receive MT ( b ) calculate base transfusion data TITCO registry . The outcome define difference proportion adult patient predict receive MT proportion patient receive MT . Sensitivity analyse Based clinical experience particular setting sensitivity analysis conduct cutoff value 4 unit PRBCs 24 hour definition MT . A sensitivity analysis also conduct restrict analysis FAST positive patient cod use CT intraoperative finding use .</detailed_description>
