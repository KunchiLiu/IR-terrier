	<brief_summary>Behavioural cognitive flexibility ( BF ) essential ability allow organism adaptively change response accordance feedback result . In human , ability disrupt among suffer variety neurological psychiatric condition include Parkinson 's disease , schizophrenia , addiction , obsessive compulsive disorder autism . Additionally , evidence substantial individual difference BF within healthy population . Two known neurobiological mechanism relate BF performance variation dopamine ( DA ) serotonin ( SE ) function . One particular brain region heavily implicate BF prefrontal cortex ( PFC ) , dorsolateral PFC receive largely DA innervation dorsomedial PFC SE input . Studies demonstrate damage part PFC include orbitofrontal cortex ( OFC ) , example , impair reversal learn ( form BF ) whereas lesion dorsolateral PFC affect attentional set-shifting ( another measure BF ) . In human , putative augmentation DA efflux via administration DA norepinephrine precursor tyrosine show improve task-switching performance , inhibitory control suggest causal role DA regulating BF . Similarly , putative depletion serotonin neurotransmission via tryptophan depletion procedure show reduce BOLD response performance monitoring increase perseverative behaviour . One important strategy ( human ) observe whether PFC causally involve BF performance , reversible electrical stimulation PFC , PFC cell could inhibit excited participant perform BF task . In recent year , several laboratory take advantage relatively new technology know transcranial direct current stimulation ( tDCS ) study relationship brain function behaviour . Using technique , increase decrease cortical excitability partly determine polarity stimulation ; increase occur anode electrode whereas decrease occur negatively charge cathode . Using approach , several study show anodal cathodal stimulation PFC number effect BF performance , general improvement anodal stimulation impairment cathodal . If case , one important step remain understood whether dopamine serotonin causally relate outcome neuron dLPFC/dMPFC either excite inhibited via tDCS . Thus , specific novelty study rest combine psychopharmacological approach ( i.e . tyrosine/tryptophan load ) selective neuroanatomical ( i.e . dorsolateral/dorsomedial prefrontal cortex ) inhibition cell via tDCS participant perform BF task . By , able establish whether increased dopaminergic/serotonergic output PFC necessary requirement BF performance .</brief_summary>
