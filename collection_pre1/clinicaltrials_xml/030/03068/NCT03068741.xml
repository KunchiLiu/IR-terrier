	<brief_summary>Sepsis occur serious infection - commonly infection lung , urinary system , blood - lead acute organ failure . It common , expensive , frequently lethal condition . A grow body evidence suggest early recognition treatment sepsis improve survival . Unfortunately , many patient sepsis receive key therapy physicians work Emergency Departments assess - often introduce mark delay . It estimate one‐half patient sepsis treat transported hospital paramedic . This allow paramedic unique opportunity provide early treatment initial point patient contact , thereby decrease time treatment critically ill patient . This randomize controlled trial evaluate whether prompt recognition follow early antibiotic and/or intravenous fluid deliver paramedic field lead improved survival , compare usual care , patient transport hospital sepsis .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Paramedic Initiated Treatment Sepsis Targeting Out-of-hospital Patients ( PITSTOP )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The ultimate goal research program evaluate fundamental change delivery sepsis care . Currently , patient severe sepsis receive key evidence-based therapy assess emergency department - often introduce considerable delay . This research test whether integrate paramedic directly chain-of-survival sepsis improve outcome critically ill patient . In essence , research seek break silo care , deliver sepsis treatment base need , rather patient physically locate . If trial positive , result broad implication health system show prehospital identification treatment sepsis increase number patient survive life-threatening condition . If trial fails demonstrate effectiveness prehospital sepsis treatment , ensure resource needlessly invest large-scale implementation paramedic sepsis protocol , do several jurisdiction . A lack benefit would also cast doubt observational data suggest early antibiotic important , suggest restrain approach empiric antibiotic therapy .</detailed_description>
