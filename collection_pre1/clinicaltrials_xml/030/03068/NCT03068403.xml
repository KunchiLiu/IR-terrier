	<brief_summary>In recent year concept organ spar treatment rectal cancer introduce select good responder neo-adjuvant treatment . In patient replacement standard care total mesorectal excision ( TME ) transanal endoscopic microsurgery ( TEM ) omission surgery chemoradiation ( CRT ) propose . Before organ spar treatment could apply clinical practice reliable patient selection procedure available good treatment responder neo-adjuvant therapy candidate adapt therapy . Different image modality study ability distinguish good treatment responder others . Examples image modality promise result regard response assessment fludeoxyglucosepositron emission tomography ( FDG-PET ) , T2-weighted magnetic resonance imaging ( T2w-MRI ) , dynamic contrast enhance magnetic resonance image diffusion weight MR image ( DW-MRI ) . Besides modality dynamic contrast enhance ultrasound ( D-CEUS ) new modality use tissue characterization therapy response assessment several tumor location , like liver tumor breast cancer . D-CEUS reflect tissue vascular perfusion . For rectal cancer , value D-CEUS pathological response prediction assessment never assess . Therefore , study assess D-CEUS predict assess pathological response rectal cancer neo-adjuvant CRT .</brief_summary>
