	<brief_summary>This research study design examine psychiatric illness call schizophrenia affect brain function think ability attention memory simple computer-based task , measure brain function related performance . We look brain activity use electroencephalography ( EEG ) magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) . We compare participant ' result activity brain well clinical measure questionnaire also complete study .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>- EEG recording : In procedure , researcher ass brain function perform simple computer-based task . The computer task involve presentation picture sound respond press button . We also record speech sound play back . You give clear instruction chance practice task . While perform task , record weak electrical signal produce brain , `` brain wave '' , use technique call electroencephalography ( EEG ) . In order record EEG , sensor ( small plastic disc ) attach specific location scalp . Your scalp gently scrub sensor attach . The sensor hold place scalp use nylon cap fit snugly head . Sensors also attach eye record eye movement . It take approximately one hour attach sensor . The entire EEG take approximately 2-3 hour . Before take part EEG session , please make sure wash hair scalp . Do use conditioner 2-in-1 shampoo/conditioner . Your hair dry arrival . We ask order make set-up process go smoothly . - During task , feel vibratory sensation produce electrical current possible may feel like slight shock . The current control reach level painful dangerous . Every participant experience sensation differently , important tell researcher sensation become uncomfortable current adjust task stop . - You may ask complete additional EEGs study , depend interest participate availability . All EEG session last approximately 2 hr . - MRI : In fMRI procedure , use magnet measure blood flow brain different task . You ask lie platform slide middle magnet . A plastic MRI image coil place around head . You come contact coil experiment . Foam pad place around head limit head movement experiment . We slide magnet . At different point experiment , ask task train session prior scan . During scan , ask either lie still rest , task like tap finger , remember letter digit , view image design activate different part brain . The entire MRI take approximately two hour . - While perform MRI , may ask wear cap contain multiple EEG sensor apply scalp . A removable gel use . The EEG measure electrical activity produce brain undergo MRI . Set EEG take approximately 30 60 minute . - You may ask repeat MRI session data study team collect usable due data quality issue , unable stay awake magnet scan . - Brief interview session : There series question education , smoke status , economic background . You also give list word read researcher . If patient diagnose one above-mentioned psychiatric disorder , ask participate additional interview , last one hour , focus feeling recently . - Behavioral testing : In part , use touch screen computer , mouse and/or paper pencil perform certain visual auditory test mental ability . Specifically , test assess memory , attention , language , motor skill . This test last approximately one hour . Depending preference , test do day EEG different day . The order two session matter , long occur within one week . Additional Information : - A medical record create San Francisco VAMC information pertain study participation enter record , per VAMC requirement . - If information mental health need current former doctor ( ) , ask sign separate permission form researcher contact doctor ( ) .</detailed_description>
