	<detailed_description>Treatment patient B cell lymphoma leukemia two dos CD19-targeting chimeric antigen receptor ( CAR ) T cell evaluate safety efficacy . The CAR consist CD19 target antibody scFv three intracellular signal domain derive CD3 zeta , CD28 4-1BB . Autologous T cell gene engineer CAR gene use retrovirus vector . Prior T cell infusion , patient subject precondition treatment . After second infusion patient subject immunomodulatory treatment . After T cell infusion , patient evaluate 24 month adverse reaction , persistence CAR T cell efficacy . Primary outcome : - Registration safety profile inflammation , fever , pain , change blood pressure , pulse adverse event . Weekly first 6 week , 3 , 6 , 9 , 12 , 15 , 18 , 21 24 month . Secondary outcome : Tumor response , CAR T cell persistence immunological profile - Determination tumor size tumor marker CD19 . - Determination level circulate B cell . - Determination level CAR T cell ( mRNA cell ) blood biopsy . - Determination activation marker CAR T cell CD107a . - Determination presence immunological marker blood biopsy . At 1 3 week 3 , 6 , 9 , 12 , 15 , 18 , 21 24 month .</detailed_description>
