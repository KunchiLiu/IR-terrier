	<detailed_description>This experiment take place course two three day . On visit day , experiment involve brief interview session , electroencephalography ( EEG ) recording , and/or magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) . Screening test procedure include : - If female child bear potential , must complete urine pregnancy test MRI procedure - You ask series question mental health background If screen exam show main part study choose continue , test procedure would complete one two test day : - EEG recording : In procedure , researcher ass brain function perform simple computer-based task . The computer task involve presentation picture respond press button . You give clear instruction chance practice task . While perform task , record weak electrical signal produce brain , `` brain wave '' , use technique call electroencephalography ( EEG ) . - In order record EEG , sensor ( small plastic disc ) attach specific location scalp . Your scalp gently scrub sensor attach . The sensor hold place scalp use nylon cap fit snugly head . Sensors also attach eye record eye movement . It take approximately one hour attach sensor . The entire EEG take approximately 2 hour . - Before take part EEG session , please make sure wash hair scalp . Do use conditioner 2-in-1 shampoo/conditioner . Your hair dry arrival . We ask order make set-up process go smoothly . - MRI : In fMRI procedure , use magnet measure blood flow brain different cognitive task . You ask lie platform slide middle magnet . A plastic MRI image coil place around head . You come contact coil experiment . Foam pad place around head limit head movement experiment . We slide magnet . At different point experiment , ask task train session prior scan . During scan , ask either lie still rest , task similar complete EEG . The entire MRI take approximately two hour . - If researcher feel though quality data collect scanner improve , may ask return additional scan session . - Brief interview session : There series question education , smoke status , economic background . You also give list word read researcher . If patient diagnose one above-mentioned psychiatric disorder , ask participate additional interview , last one hour , focus feeling recently .</detailed_description>
