	<brief_summary>Patients malignant pleural mesothelioma ( MPM ) frequently significant physical symptom , 92 % patient complain three symptom presentation . Such symptom score similar report advanced non small cell lung cancer ( NSCLC ) demonstrate correlate interference activity bad quality life ( QOL ) . Several study report baseline Quality Life ( QOL ) significant prognostic factor survival NSCLC patient . In 2010 , non-blinded randomise control trial 151 patient United States ( US ) demonstrate improved QOL , few depressive symptom improve survival early , regular specialist palliative care team ( SPCT ) involvement addition routine care . The RESPECT-Meso study examine effect quality life follow early Specialist Palliative Care ( SPC ) involvement Regular Early Symptom Control Treatment ( RESSCT ) addition routine care patient newly diagnose MPM United Kingdom ( UK ) .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The purpose study examine regular early Specialist Symptom Control Treatment ( SSCT ) involvement mesothelioma patient improve patient ' carers ' quality life ( QOL ) illness . Mesothelioma cancer line around chest wall cause asbestos exposure . The UK high death rate mesothelioma world mesothelioma soon account approximately 1 170 death UK . At present , cure . About third patient chemotherapy , prolong long patient live ( 'survival ' ) month . For many patient , doctor offer treatment symptom cancer , rather treat cancer . For patient , survival usually 8-12 month . Mesothelioma cause many symptom include breathlessness , chest pain , weight loss fatigue . Specialist Palliative Care ( SPC ) medicine doctor nurse specialist treat symptom due life limit illness . They also provide emotional support patient carers . The current practice UK involve SPC towards end patient 's life . A recent study America examine lung cancer patient show involve SPC early patient 's treatment improve patient ' QOL illness , also survival . Until cure , significant advance treatment , MPM become available , attempt improve QOL patient carers remain primary goal team manage care . Recent research examine NSCLC early SPCT intervention Temel et al demonstrate novel approach plausible , possible effective improve patient ' QOL . This report demonstrate survival benefit 2.7 month ; new chemotherapy drug demonstrate effect , would likely consider significant breakthrough treatment MPM . Current practice UK involve SPC towards final month , perhaps week , life-limiting illness . Therefore , regular early SSCT intervention well-placed demonstrate effect propose intervention . This comprehensive , randomise , multicentre study examine patient caregiver QOL , healthcare economic consequence provide intervention . The result widely applicable many institution patient throughout UK . This study randomly divide patient either normal treatment support ( 'usual care ' , always offer ) , usual care regular SPC consultation time diagnosis . No treatment withhold ; study provide additional support patient family . Patients ask complete set questionnaire start study , monthly 6 month . Carers also complete set questionnaire start study 3 6 month . Reported QOL survival two group compare .</detailed_description>
