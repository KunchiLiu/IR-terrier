	<brief_summary>Background : The human biome collection microbial gene find body . It associate many health condition . But certain factor might affect finding microbiome study . These include collection method , lab handling , data processing . Researchers want test effect long-term storage freezer two oral sample collection method . These method OMNIgene ORAL Scope mouthwash . Objective : To test effect long-term freeze oral microbiome measure OMNIgene ORAL Scope mouthwash . Eligibility : Employees National Cancer Institute : - Are age 18 old - Have use antibiotic past 3 month Design : Participants 6 visit within 2 week . At visit 1 complete questionnaire health lifestyle . All visit last 15-30 minute include : - 1-2 saliva sample use OMNIgene ORAL : They spit collector . - 1-2 Scope sample : They gargle Scope mouthwash spit cup . - Questions well follow preparation procedure Participants follow preparation procedure : For 12 hour visit , must : - Brush teeth - Floss - Use mouthwash - Eat drink anything water - Chew gum - Consume throat lozenges candy - Smoke chew tobacco Participants sample store freezer . They get data oral microbiome wish .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The human microbiome ( i.e. , collection microbial gene find human body ) observe associate numerous health condition , current methodological study suggest collection method , laboratory handling , bioinformatic processing data , factor greatly affect microbiome study finding . In cohort study , sample typically collect baseline , often process sufficient case accumulate . This type study design require sample remain frozen likely many year prior laboratory handle microbiome measurement . To knowledge , study consider impact long term storage oral sample oral microbiome characteristic . Therefore , evaluate effect long term storage two oral sample collection method ( OMNIgene ORAL Scope mouthwash ) 30 individual work NCI oral microbiome characteristic . We request participant provide sample 6 separate day course two week . Participants also fill short questionnaire . We create aliquot pool OMNIgene ORAL Scope mouthwash sample individual , immediately extract DNA one aliquot . The remain aliquot frozen -80 degree C DNA extract one month , three month , six month , one year collection . The remain aliquot remain -80 degress C freezer even long term test future study . We compare microbial profile store sample immediately extract sample determine effect storage oral sample .</detailed_description>
	<criteria>ELIGIBILITY : Anyone work NCI eligible . Children ( &lt; 18 year age ) include since child work NCI followup would difficult . People age ( adult ) , race , gender , factor invite participate . No competent adult volunteer exclude . The exclusion adult participant take antibiotic medication prior 3 month since antibiotic use show disrupt oral microbiome , although less fecal microbiome .</criteria>
