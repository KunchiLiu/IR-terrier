	<brief_summary>This Phase Ib , open-label , multicenter , global study design ass safety tolerability RO6870810 monotherapy combination daratumumab participant relapsed/refractory multiple myeloma . There two part study . A dose-escalation phase ( Part I ) use evaluate safety tolerability dose limit toxicity , establish maximum tolerated dose/optimum biological dose RO6870810 give monotherapy combination daratumumab . A dose-expansion phase ( Part II ) characterize safety , tolerability activity RO6870810 monotherapy combination daratumumab define expansion dose-levels .</brief_summary>
