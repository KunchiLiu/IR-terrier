	<brief_summary>The research team 's aim investigate effect team 's soft robotic sock provide assisted ankle dorsiflexion-plantarflexion promote venous blood flow stroke patient . Specifically , investigator intend 1 ) observe development joint contracture term range motion ankle joint give use device 2 ) monitor presence blood clot deep vein use compression Duplex ultrasonography give use sock device . The investigator hypothesize soft robotics approach provide compliant actuation simulate natural ankle dorsiflexion plantarflexion , consequently promote blood circulation lower leg stroke patient previously develop ankle joint contracture . This prevent occurrence DVT movement ankle joint alleviate stiffness . This robotic sock intervention prevent development ankle joint contracture establish ankle contracture exclude study .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The investigator 's propose robotic sock solution capable provide programmable robot-assisted ankle exercise chronic bedridden patient , thereby improve venous blood flow , prevent DVT ankle joint contracture . Compared conventional mechanical prophylaxis intermittent pneumatic compression device , robotic sock likely cost almost five time less , potentially generate patient/hospital saving $ 2750 per patient . The use robotic sock also raise therapist productivity automate therapy exercise bedridden patient , could potentially save therapist least 6 workhours per day . The use robotic sock hospital , nurse home patient ' home likely reduce healthcare cost prevent side effect , compare conventional DVT prophylaxis approach . In addition , add new value benefit public healthcare eliminate additional treatment cost arise DVT-related complication , increase therapist ' productivity ( especially give grow manpower constraint grey population ) , optimize therapy time , ultimately save precious life . Among diagnosed DVT , 10-30 % dy within 1 month diagnosis ( Beckman et al. , 2010 ) , worldwide 600,000-800,000 people die annually ( worldthrombosisday.org ) . This research seek low DVT risk safe non-drug-based approach continuously move ankle joint dorsiflexion-plantarflexion use soft robotics . Current alternative prevent DVT include pharmacological prophylaxis anticoagulant drug , mechanical prophylaxis intermittent pneumatic compression device compression stocking , basic therapist-assisted exercise prevent ankle joint contracture . Pharmacological prophylaxis improve venous blood flow prevent DVT , run risk detrimental side effect like excessive bleeding . Mechanical prophylaxis provide passive automate stimulation calf tissue , report deliver limited efficacy improve venous blood flow prevent DVT . Considering data United States United Kingdom , annual spending incur due direct indirect cost result DVT approximate US $ 2-10 billion range US $ 7,594-US $ 16,644 per patient ( Spyropoulos Lin , 2007 ) . Therefore , implement robotic sock device , investigator hope enable clinician focus treat patient towards stroke recovery without worry complication . Joint contracture , usually define limited passive range joint motion common people neurological condition stroke spinal cord injury . The risk factor joint contracture well understood ; however , immobility seem important factor . Joint contracture , especially ankle joint , may impede ability walk cause loss balance , high risk fall restrict participation social activity . The frequency ankle contracture hospitalize patient varies prevalence rate range 24 % 44 % .</detailed_description>
