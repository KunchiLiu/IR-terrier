	<brief_summary>The subject study lung microbiota one upper airway ( UAs ) ( much less studied intestinal microbiota ) 40 patient lung cancer . 20 patient undergo surgical treatment , half receives also chemotherapy . The idea explore change microbiota lung , upper UAs intestine , potentially find association . These result serve u base future study , focus manipulation microbiota prebiotics , probiotic symbiotics effect anti-cancer treatment tolerance effectiveness .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Lung cancer patient divide two group , first one patient undergoing chemotherapy surgery ( Pct-chir ) , second one patient undergoing surgery ( Pchir ) . Following inclusion , give 7-days alimentary survey , along blood saliva sampling ( buccodental examination dental panoramic ) . The Pct-chir group repeat procedure chemotherapy surgery . Day surgery , patient ask bring faecal sample ( special box provide advance ) fill survey . During operation piece lung tissue well tumour ( size enables ) sample analysis . Lavage perform lung immediately resection . Saliva , faecal sample , lung tumour tissue , lavage use bacterial DNA extraction , follow qPCR sequencing analysis . Lavage blood sample analyse flow cytometry ELISA , establish immunological profile ( interleukines , cell surface marker ) .</detailed_description>
