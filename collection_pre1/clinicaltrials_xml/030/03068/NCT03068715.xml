	<brief_title>Accelerated Theta Burst Treatment-Resistant Depression</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation ( rTMS ) establish technology therapy treatment-resistant depression . The approved method treatment 10Hz stimulation 40 min leave dorsolateral prefrontal cortex ( L-DLPFC ) . This methodology successful real world situation . The limitation approach include duration treatment ( approximately 40 minute per treatment session ) . Recently , researcher aggressively pursue modify treatment parameter reduce treatment time preliminary success . This study intents modify parameter create rapid form treatment look change neuroimaging biomarkers .</detailed_description>
