	<brief_title>Can Hybrid PET-MRI Differentiate Between Radiation Effects Disease Progression ?</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The multimodality approach management primary secondary brain tumor include surgery , radiotherapy chemotherapy . Determination objective response treatment relies image finding ( e.g . CT , MRI , PET ) .During course disease patient brain tumor often develop new worsen contrast-enhancing lesion routine follow-up imaging.These lesion may reflect tumor recurrence , treatment effect , combination . Discerning tumor recurrence treatment effect clinically significant issue major challenge neuro-oncology . Treatment-related effect exist within spectrum , `` pseudoprogression '' reflect subacute often transient injury , `` radiation necrosis '' reflect later permanent damage.The difficulty differentiate tumor progression treatment-related effect serious implication individual patient treatment decision prognosis well clinical trial design interpretation result . A contemporary hybrid scanner technology capable acquire metabolic information PET morphological functional detail MRI . This new integrated technique open new horizon clinical research evaluation brain tumor associate treatment effect . The aim current study use combine data obtain PET-MRI scan regard amino acid metabolic profile , functional morphological detail order : 1 . Distinguish progressive tumor treatment related effect 2 . To identify pseudo-response antiangiogenic therapy tumor progression 3 . To optimize study protocol PET-MRI future routine clinical application . The study include three cohort patient brain tumor : 1 . Primary brain tumor : A cohort 60 adult patient ( age : 18-70 ) newly diagnose high grade glioma ( Glioblastoma , Anaplastic Astrocytoma , Anaplastic Oligodendroglioma , Anaplastic Oligoastrocytoma ) schedule combined treatment chemotherapy radiotherapy . Patients eligible study immediately receive pathological diagnosis prior treatment . These patient undergo PET-MRI scan 4 time point follow : - 1st scan : surgery biopsy treatment - 2nd scan : perform 4 week complete combined radiotherapy chemotherapy regimen . - 3rd 4th scan : follow interval 3 month study . - Additional scan perform decision investigator patient schedule antiangiogenic therapy 2 . Brain metastasis treat stereotactic radiosurgery ( SRS ) : A cohort 60 adult patient ( age : 18-75 ) follow SRS treatment brain metastasis secondary breast lung cancer whose recent imaging show sign progression list one previously treat lesion . Progression determine Response Assessment Neuro-Oncology Criteria ( RANO criterion ) brain metastasis . Number target lesion exceed 4 size lesion range 5-40 mm . These patient undergo PET-MRI scan three time point follow : - 1st scan : Following determination progression SRS treat lesion base standard surveillance MRI - 2nd 3rd scan : perform every 2 month first scan - Additional scan perform decision investigator 3 . Brain metastasis treat SRS/radiotherapy A cohort 20 adult patient ( age : 18-75 ) diagnosis brain metastasis secondary human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 ( HER2 ) positive breast cancer anaplastic lymphoma kinase ( ALK ) Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor ( EGFR ) gene mutant lung cancer might candidate SRS treatment target therapy select instead . The size lesion range 5-40 mm . These patient undergo PET-MRI scan three time point follow : - 1st scan : first documentation brain metastasis standard MRI - 2nd 3rd scan : perform every 2 month first scan - In case progression SRS treatment follow-up scanning perform every 2 month - Additional scan perform decision investigator</detailed_description>
