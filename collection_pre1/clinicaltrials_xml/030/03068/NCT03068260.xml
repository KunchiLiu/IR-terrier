	<brief_title>Ultrasound-guided Transmuscular Quadratus Lumborum Block Elective Caesarean Section .</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Every year two hundred twenty patient undergo elective caesarean section ( CS ) department obstetric gynaecologic surgery Zealand University Hospital . The vast majority patient undergo surgical procedure spinal ( subarachnoid ) anaesthesia Bupivacaine additive Sufentanil . There many way perform caesarean section . The technique vary , regard type skin incision , abdominal wall dissect , uterine incision make , finally layer close procedure . Two common transverse skin incision Pfannenstiels incision Joel-Cohen incision . The Pfannenstiels incision make 2 3 cm cephalad pubic bone , slightly curve midportion incision within shaved area pubic hair . The Joel-Cohen incision place 3 cm caudad anterior intercristal line ; i.e . slightly cephalad Pfannenstiels incision . If Pfannenstiels incision utilize , subcutaneous layer , fascia parietal peritoneum usually dissect sharply , whereas Joel-Cohen incision , subcutaneous layer incise medially , follow manual separation lateral tissue . The fascia peritoneum dissect bluntly . At Zealand University Hospital , skin incision use elective caesarean section Joel-Cohen incision . A straight , transverse , 12 cm long incision make cutaneous layer describe . The subcutaneous layer incise medial area , two small incision make side midline fascia . These incision fascia extend laterally scissor . The linea alba parietal peritoneum open bluntly finger . Finally , layer abdominal wall pull apart angles incision , open incision laterally . The sensory nerve supply abdominal wall umbilicus consist anterior cutaneous ramus 11th intercostal nerve , subcostal nerve ( T12 ) , iliohypogastric nerve ( T12 , L1 ) ilioinguinal nerve ( L1 ) . From intercostal space , 11th intercostal nerve run behind costal cartilage enters neurovascular plane internal oblique- transverse abdominis muscle . Just lateral rectus abdominis muscle , nerve perforates dorsal sheath rectus muscle continue rectus muscle end anterior cutaneous branch abdominal wall umbilicus . The subcostal nerve pass lateral arcuate ligament , run front quadratus lumborum muscle perforates transverse abdominis muscle enter neurovascular plane . Here subcostal nerve divide anterior lateral branch , anterior branch innervates skin hypogastrium . The iliohypogastric nerve emerge lateral border psoas major muscle run front quadratus lumborum muscle behind kidney . The nerve perforate transverse abdominis muscle near iliac crest enters neurovascular plane transverse abdominis internal oblique muscle divide lateral anterior cutaneous branch . The lateral branch innervates skin gluteal region , whereas anterior branch perforate internal oblique muscle , run internal external oblique muscle perforate external oblique muscle 2-3 cm cranial subcutaneous inguinal ring end anterior cutaneous branch skin hypogastric region . The ilioinguinal nerve initially follow iliohypogastric nerve , caudad , sometimes communicate common nerve . After perforate internal oblique muscle , run superficial inguinal ring innervates skin mon pubis , labia majora upper medial part thigh . The parietal peritoneum line abdominal cavity innervate spinal nerve correspond region abdominal wall . When entry abdominal cavity achieve , incision peritoneum cover bladder make . A superficial , transverse incision make midline low uterine segment . The rest muscular layer dissect bluntly pean enter uterine cavity incision expand laterally pull cephalocaudal direction . The infant deliver placenta remove . The visceral peritoneum cover uterus anteriorly posteriorly . Like parietal peritoneum , receive afferent nerve innervation organ cover . On side uterus , two peritoneal sheet meet comprise broad ligament . The fallopian tube run two sheet free edge ligament , peritoneum fold . On side fallopian tube , round ligament uterus ovarian ligament arise anteriorly posteriorly , respectively . Other ligament support uterus cardinal ligament attache cervix lateral pelvic wall , uterosacral ligament extend backwards cervix front sacrum . The ovary hold place ovarian ligament ( uterus ) , suspensory ligament ovary ( pelvic wall ) mesovarium ( broad ligament ) . Like viscera , uterus innervate sympathetic parasympathetic fiber , well sensory nerve fiber . It innervate uterovaginal plexus , fiber originate inferior hypogastric plexus . The inferior hypogastric plexus pair , half side rectum , cervix bladder consist sympathetic well parasympathetic fiber . Pain body uterus consider run sympathetic nerve . Afferent nerve supply uterus arise T10 - T12 L1 . The fallopian tube also innervate uterovaginal plexus , well ovarian plexus . The ovary afferent supply 10th intercostal nerve . After fetal placental extraction , uterotomy close . Where possible , recommend close uterus in-situ . The uterus close single-layer , continuous closure . Marcain sometimes administer subfascially fascia close continuous suture . Finally , skin close intracutaneous suture . In post-anaesthesia care unit ( PACU ) patient administer multimodal analgesia regimen currently consist oral Acetaminophen 1g , Ibuprofen 400 mg. Morphine 10 mg . The addition oral Morphine 10 mg international standard far agree locally . The investigator 's research group Zealand University Hospital conduct thorough retrospective one-year survey patient group order define quantity research problem . The electronic anaesthesia file , PACU file ward file meticulously review . The survey reveal accumulated morphine consumption first 24 postoperative hour 35.7±25.0 mg oral morphine equivalent CS patient . This dosage evaluate relation standardise multimodal regimen describe . Anaesthesiologists primarily use either epidural catheter long-lasting opioids basis postoperative pain management expect manifest moderate severe pain . An epidural blockade contraindicate patient , might cause bladder paralysis , low extremity paralysis , hypotension etc . Also , epidural technique labour-intensive application well requirement monitor . Thus , continuous epidural blockade possibility interest gynecologist obstetricians hospital . Therefore , recently opioids sole treatment pain , over-the-counter medicine suffice . This present problem patient due well-known adverse effect morphine include postoperative nausea vomiting ( PONV ) , itch , fatigue , constipation , confusion , respiratory depression delay mobilisation . These adverse effect bad new mother well breast-fed , newborn child . All adverse effect well know , internationally several anaesthesia association ( ESA , ASA , ESRA , ASRA ) search viable alternative implement daily clinical practice - alternative primary focus wellbeing patient strive ensure effective pain relief minimal adverse effect . In summary , could many potentially positive benefit relate treatment advanced pain-reducing technique . Postoperative complication surgery frequent patient experience postoperative pain , besides reduce immediate postoperative pain perception , consider reduction total morphine consumption potential reducing development chronic pain well treatment acute pain , interest promise patient study . To avoid reduce postoperative pain CS , numerous regional anaesthetic technique try . In UK , elsewhere , combine spinal epidural ( CSE ) use , high demand time technical skill , 's lack potential epidural test spinal top , technique never gain ground Denmark . The ultrasound-guided ( USG ) 'blind ' transversus abdominis plane ( TAP ) block investigate several study , vary result . Thus , technique consider implementation standard anaesthesia regimen CS Zealand University Hospital . In placebo control trial 2015 patient undergo CS , Blanco et al . find significantly lower postoperative opioid consumption lower pain score active group treat Dr. Blanco 's version ultrasound-guided ( USG ) quadratus lumborum ( QL ) block - name QLB much resembles USG version original blind landmarked base TAP block . However , exact mechanism Dr. Blanco 's QLB block work still clear . The investigator technical capability improve perioperative pain management take advantage USG peripheral nerve block ( PNBs ) . At Zealand hospital concomminantly Dr. Blanco describe another so-called QL block technique . We call technique transmuscular QL ( TQL ) block . The mechanism TQL block work proven major cadaveric study . ( submit publication Anesth Analg ) USG PNBs apply use technique base thorough anatomical knowledge real-time ultrasound image evolve rapidly last 10 year . At Department Anaesthesiology , Zealand University Hospital , research group among leader Scandinavia within specific field interest . We want make use pain treatment technique everyday practice wherever clinically indicate . The research group head associate professor Jens Børglum , PhD , deeply involve development since 2007 . In relation abdominal surgery , Jens Børglum previous research group involve research describe evaluate effectiveness USG bilateral dual transversus abdominis plane ( BD-TAP ) block , USG ilioinguinal / iliohypogastric nerve block , recently , USG TQL block . Three article concern specifically USG TQL block ' application recently publish group alone , show increase interest focus development particular block potential ability future knowledge block . At Zealand University Hospital several research project regard seemingly promising analgesic efficacy USG TQL blockade plan already make . The Department Anaesthesiology already conduct PhD-study cooperation Department Urology concern TQL block management pain patient operate kidney cancer ( nephrectomy ) large pelvis stone ( Percutaneous Nephrolithotomy , PNL ) . The USG TQL block show convincing result small pilot-study , concern above-mentioned patient surgery retroperitoneal space , result low pain score period without need opioids 24 hour postoperatively . In pilot-studies , USG TQL block show excellent pain-relieving effect administer bilateral rescue block ; i.e . postoperatively laparoscopic hysterectomy gynaecologic procedure well CS . The TQL block apply patient lateral position , flank side block turning upwards . The ultrasound transducer place transverse position posterior axillary line , iliac crest , adjust visualise QL psoas major ( PM ) muscle transverse process vertebra L3 L4 . The needle subsequently insert posterolateral end transducer advance plane . The needle advanced QL muscle tip needle penetrate invest fascia QL muscle . The local anaesthetic inject interfascial plane , posterior/superficial transversalis fascia ( TF ) QL PM muscle . Confirmation correct application subsequently visualize two muscle see spread apart ultrasound image . The TF , cover antero-medial surface QL antero-lateral surface PM , split two layer level diaphragm . One layer continuous inferior diaphragmatic fascia continue behind arcuate ligament diaphragm endothoracic fascia . This lumbar application local anaesthetic facilitate block nerve within thoracic cage . The injectate close proximity ventral ramus segmental nerve thoracic paravertebral space sympathetic trunk . As previously mention yet unpublished data cadaveric study Innsbruck , December 2015 , conduct group . The result show favourable spread injectate TQL block . Not injected dye study spread colour ventral ramus thoracic spinal nerve T9 thoracic paravertebral space ; injectate also spread colour thoracic sympathetic trunk . The visceral pain arise intraperitoneal organ travel via different nerve join exactly thoracic sympathetic trunk enter central nervous system . Thus , seem indicate TQL block use treat pain incision tear superficially uterus , also pain uterus , adjacent intraperitoneal organ structure , affect patient undergo CS . The cadaveric study also show lumbar sympathetic trunk lumbar plexus affect injected dye . These result seem imply would minimal affection ambulation lumbar sympathectomy ; i.e . hypotension dysfunctional bladder often observed epidural technique . Both finding coincide clinical experience pilot study . The investigator want perform evidence-based research use USG TQL patient undergo elective CS . Our hypothesis USG TQL block administer bilaterally apply postoperatively PACU CS patient ( spinal anaesthesia still manifest ) reduce postoperative morphine consumption 50 % first 24 postoperative hour . It consider block little discomfort patient , already anaesthetize , even , patient still anaesthetise area interest , least still somewhat desensitised spinal anaesthesia . All patient schedule CS screen accord inclusion exclusion criterion . The suitable candidate ask prior surgery , whether want participate trial . If , follow elective CS surgery , patient receive block , allocate randomised fashion either active LA placebo . The block perform standard postoperative monitoring train skilled physician department anaesthesia . The active treatment bilateral TQL block 30 mL Ropivacaine 0.375 % side , whereas placebo group receive volume Saline , apply exact way . The patient receive post-surgical analgesia regimen , consist 1 g Acetaminophen , 400 mg Ibuprofen / 100 mg Celebra , latter large blood loss evaluate anaesthetist obstetrician , IV Morphine Patient-Controlled Analgesia ( PCA ) - pump . In order keep pool administration local anaesthetic accept maximum recommended dosage , local anaesthetic infiltration perform surgeon . In reference opioid consumption , part local instruction receive 10 mg Morphine PACU upon arrival post-surgically . This also withdraw concern patient enrol study , instead patient manage opioid treatment activation PCA pump .</detailed_description>
