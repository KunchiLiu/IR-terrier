Anna University Hospital Health Authorities Ferrara , Northern Italy . The psychotherapeutic intervention perform supervise researcher ( R.C . ) supervisor ( L.G . ) directly train CALM Department Supportive Care , Princess Margaret Cancer Center , Toronto . Other trained professional psychotherapy psycho-oncology also provide CALM intervention , attend training course carry principal investigator ( RC , LG ) present study . The study design single-blinded randomized-controlled trial two arm , experimental group control group . Participants experimental group receive CALM intervention advance cancer , Control Group receive supportive intervention ( SPI ) , usual psycho-oncology care Ferrara setting ( Figure 1 ) . The study submit approval University Hospital Health Authorities Ethical Committee Ferrara , Italy . Pilot phase In line approach original author international CALM investigator , preliminary pilot un-blinded study carry one-year period centre , prior initiate CALM randomize control trial . All participant pilot phase assign intervention condition aim test assess feasibility standard operating procedure outline CALM randomize control trial , acceptability intervention within Italian context . This important since concept mean , spirituality , existential growth attachment might emerge differently Italian set Canadian set CALM develop . The subjective experience participant receive intervention also examine qualitatively . Patient recruitment follow procedure outline CALM randomize control trial , except blind . CALM randomize control trial : experimental ( CALM ) control group ( SPI ) intervention CALM Intervention Patients experimental group receive brief , individual , manualized CALM intervention , semi-structured psychotherapy design patient advance cancer . CALM develop base empirical result , clinical observation theoretical foundation supportive-expressive existential approach , well psychodynamic attachment theory . In Italian adaptation , CALM consist 12 individual session ( 45-60 minute ) , instead original 6 session . The session deliver bimonthly period 6 month without possibility telephone session . Sessions audio-recorded reviewed ensure treatment fidelity . According original protocol CALM manual , intervention cover four domain , namely : 1 ) Symptom management communication health care provider , aim improve cooperation communication health care provider , consequently medical decision-making control symptom ; 2 ) Changes self relation close others , aim support disruption self-esteem identity related cancer treatment . 3 ) Spiritual well-being , sense meaning purpose , aim addressing change life priority mean suffer relate advanced phase cancer ; 4 ) Preparing future , sustain hope face mortality , aim address existential fear concern , plan advanced treatment , prepare process die . All domain address patient , time devote module varies , base concern emerge relevant patient specific session . The participant 's caregiver invite participate one session , deem appropriate therapist . At time intervention , patient deem acute risk suicide , demonstrate significant worsen depression , require treatment psychiatric co-morbidities , base clinical judgment therapist , refer psychiatric assessment treatment . Non-manualized supportive psycho-oncology intervention ( SPI ) The Control group intervention ( SPI ) include counseling , information , crisis intervention , usual care intervention provide center . As CALM patient , SPI patient receive twelve session individual therapy period 6 month , session last 50 minute . Randomization procedure Study participant randomly assign receive either CALM SPI . After obtain informed consent patient , research assistant include his/her data random allocation list inform PI 's treatment allocation ( CALM SPI ) . No CALM study member access randomization list . The patient inform treatment condition ( CaLM SPI ) . Quality standard therapists train The CALM treatment manual The research group translate adapted CALM treatment manual Italian language . Therapist qualification The investigator therapists psychiatrist clinical psychologist train psychotherapy psycho-oncology expertise . CALM train CALM therapist receive comprehensive CALM training study center . Therapists randomize control condition receive additional training . Supervision In order ensure quality therapy treatment condition , CALM SPI therapist receive regular supervision experience supervisor . Tape record According original CALM research protocol , every therapy session treatment condition audio tap . The research team analyze audio recording randomly select therapy session evaluate treatment integrity . Screening Measures The Short Orientation-Memory-Concentration test ( SOMC ) validate instrument assess orientation , memory concentration . The SOMC score range 0 28 . Scores less 20 indicate cognitive impairment . The Structured Clinical Interview Diagnostic Statistical Manual-IV ( SCID-I ) validate structured interview assessment Diagnostic Statistical Manual IV Axis I disorder . A portion Mood Disorders Optional Disorders Module Structured Clinical Interview Diagnostic Statistical Manual Disorders ( SCID ) administer data collection point . The SCID complement PHQ-9 , allow diagnosis Major Depressive Episode Minor Depressive Disorder make . The 15 Diagnostic Statistical Manual criterion Major Depression explore face face interview screen whether patient meet criterion Major Depression diagnosis . To diagnose major depression disorder least five nine symptom must fully meet , one item 1 2 . Statistical method Power Calculation To detect effect size ( Cohen 's ) 0.40 80 % power alpha set 0.05 correlation 0.60 baseline endpoint assessment , sample size 64 individual per group would require study end . Assuming study completion rate 80 % treatment compliance rate 90 % , 99 individual per group would require baseline , total 198 individual baseline . Data Analysis Analysis data obtain patient complete least 3 month ( T1 ) intervention perform . Statistical analysis carry use Statistical Package Social Science Statistic program . For final analysis use intention-to-treat approach ( ITT ) compare patient assign treatment group . Main analyse evaluate efficacy regard primary secondary outcome perform use analysis covariance ( ANCOVA ) . In case miss outcome data primary endpoint , use last observation carry forward ( LOCF ) method multiple imputation sensitivity analysis . We hypothesize mean depression demoralization score intervention group lower control group , control baseline data disease-related characteristic .</detailed_description>
