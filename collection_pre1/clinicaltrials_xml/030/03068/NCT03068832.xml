	<brief_summary>The early clinical development paradigm chemotherapeutic agent significantly influence development therapeutic cancer vaccine . However , major difference two class therapeutic important implication early clinical development . Specifically , phase 1 concept dose escalation find maximum-tolerated dose apply therapeutic cancer vaccine . Most therapeutic cancer vaccine associate minimal toxicity range feasible manufacture administer , little reason believe maximum-tolerated dose effective dose . In recent article biostatistics literature , Simon et al . write `` initial clinical trial many new vaccine toxicity dose-ranging trial rather involve administration fix dose vaccine … case dose select base preclinical finding practical consideration . Using several dose level initial study find minimal active dose characterize dose-activity relationship generally realistic '' . Consistent recommendation , general philosophy phase 1 clinical trial facilitate prompt preliminary evaluation safety immunogenicity personalize synthetic long peptide vaccine strategy . The proposed clinical trial test fix dose vaccine . There considerable experience synthetic long peptide vaccine platform . The synthetic long peptide vaccine platform excellent safety profile , optimal dose appear base practical consideration ( solubility peptide ) . The dose test proposed clinical trial consistent similar cancer vaccine trial recently complete currently ongoing . The sample size ( n=10-20 ) provide reasonably reliable estimate safety immunogenicity vaccine .</brief_summary>

Consenting eligible patient sequence data access evaluate candidate neoantigens ( sequence may take place auspex project , part participant 's standard care , tumor bank research project ) . Shortly vaccine ready administration , participant rescreened use criterion confirm eligibility . Any patient , regardless current age , diagnose age 021 year pediatric brain tumor histologic subtype , develop recurrent refractory disease . Availability tissue sequence determine presence targetable neoantigen . This may fresh tissue collect specifically sequence archive tissue previous craniotomy biopsy , subtotal resection , total gross resection , reresection .

Ability understand willingness sign IRB approve write informed consent document ( legally authorize representative , applicable ) . As safety feasibility study , prior immunotherapy permit . However , prior immunotherapy must discontinue least 2 week peptide vaccine administration . Nonimmunologic therapy may continue . No candidate neoantigen identify screen .

Uncontrolled intercurrent illness include , limited , ongoing active infection , symptomatic congestive heart failure , unstable angina pectoris , cardiac arrhythmia , psychiatric illness/social situation would limit compliance study requirement . History preexist immunodeficiency disorder , autoimmune condition require immunosuppressive therapy , chronic infection ( i.e . hepatitis B , hepatitis C , HIV ) . This include inflammatory bowel disease , ulcerative colitis , Crohn 's disease , systemic vasculitis , scleroderma , psoriasis , multiple sclerosis , hemolytic anemia , immunemediated thrombocytopenia , rheumatoid arthritis , systemic lupus erythematosus , Sjögren 's syndrome , sarcoidosis , rheumatologic disease medical condition use medication might make difficult patient complete full course treatment generate immune response vaccine . Presence clinically significant increase intracranial pressure ( e.g . impend herniation ) hemorrhage , uncontrolled seizure , requirement immediate palliative treatment .
