	<detailed_description>Fear conditioning paradigm use investigate learn process fear response patient psychiatric disorder healthy subject . Patients post traumatic stress disorder show fail retrieve memory fear extinction recall phase fear condition paradigm compare healthy subject . In one previous trial , obsessive-compulsive disorder ( OCD ) patient demonstrated failure recall extinction result functional magnetic resonance imaging ( fMRI ) activation map show different region recruit recall compare healthy subject . However , previous trial , OCD patient include already take medication OCD . In current trial , evaluate 24 unmedicated OCD patient two-day fear conditioning paradigm 4-weeks treatment initiation sertraline 200mg/day maximum tolerated dosage . Sertraline first-line treatment option OCD . At baseline , OCD patient compare 24 healthy subject . At post treatment , fear conditioning fMRI result wil compare baseline . OCD patient expect demonstrate worsen extinction retention compare healthy subject baseline . Sertraline treatment expect improve extinction retention compare baseline normalize brain region recruit conditioned stimulus present recall phase . By `` normalize '' mean treatment region recruit one recruit healthy subject baseline , word , difference find baseline regard brain activation condition stimulus expect disappear treatment . Abbreviations : CS= condition stimulus , CS+= condition stimuli shock , CS-=neutral condition stimulus , CS+E= extinguish condition stimulus shock , CS+U=unextinguished condition stimulus shock</detailed_description>
