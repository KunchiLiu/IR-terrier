	<brief_summary>People COPD air lung people ( problem high lung volume call `` hyperinflation '' ) . Unfortunately unhelpful breathe high lung volume require effort contributes breathlessness . When anyone exercise , breathe quickly . People COPD narrow airway , make breathe difficult . When breathe quickly may able breathe fully need take next breath . This mean volume air lung tend increase exercise , make breathe even difficult . This problem call `` dynamic hyperinflation '' . Pulmonary rehabilitation one helpful intervention people COPD benefit gain exercise . Anything help people increase amount exercise perform lead improvement . Non-invasive positive pressure ventilation method support person 's normal breathing . The ventilator delivers flow air low pressure breathe , help patient breathe completely . The device also detect patient start breathe delivers strong flow air high pressure , help take deep breath . Previous research study show people COPD use non-invasive ventilation exercise able exercise longer less breathless . The purpose study ass whether new portable non-invasive ventilation device , call VitaBreath , help people COPD recover breathlessness exercise break quickly ( reduce `` dynamic hyperinflation '' , describe ) exercise longer overall . The VitaBreath device small light , weigh 0.5 kilogram ( one pound ) . It handheld battery power .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Influence VitaBreath Exercise Tolerance COPD</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>In patient chronic obstructive pulmonary disease ( COPD ) dynamic hyperinflation ( DH ) concurrent mechanical constraint tidal volume expansion exercise increase work breathe perceived respiratory discomfort , limit endurance . An additional consequence DH concomitant high mean intrathoracic pressure swing , cardiac performance , hence , supply oxygenate blood malfunction peripheral muscle compromise . This contribute perceived leg discomfort exercise intolerance . Bronchodilator therapy associate reduction operate lung volume , lead improvement perceive breathlessness exercise tolerance . Heliox ( helium oxygen ) less dense generates less airway resistance air . Heliox breathe show improve exercise tolerance COPD . A recent study demonstrate compare room air , breathe heliox constant-load exercise ( CLE ) ( continuous ) increase inspiratory capacity ( IC ) , lessen DH , breathlessness leg discomfort isotime point exercise limitation . In addition , heliox breathing increase stroke volume , cardiac output hence locomotor muscle oxygen delivery . However , main drawback heliox supplementation high cost , especially use long periods time . Previous study use inspiratory pressure support show improvement dyspnoea exercise capacity reduce work breathing , well improved central hemodynamic response peripheral muscle oxygenation . In comparison traditional noninvasive ventilator , Vitabreath device , provide positive inspiratory pressure , compact , light inexpensive . Ease operation , portability battery life support use aid relief breathlessness , include away patient 's home . This facilitate maintenance , improvement , activity . Vitabreath may also prove useful tool increase exercise tolerance intensity training , hence magnitude physiological adaptation mitigate DH rehabilitative exercise training .</detailed_description>
