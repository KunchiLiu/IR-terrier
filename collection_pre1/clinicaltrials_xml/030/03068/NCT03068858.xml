	<brief_summary>The SYNTAX score ( SS ) recommend clinical guideline appropriate use criterion coronary revascularization ( CR ) provide guidance optimal treatment strategy patient stable coronary artery disease ( CAD ) . However , discrepancy SS angiographic core lab ( ACL ) cardiologists find . Whether misestimate lead inappropriate CR whether SS intervention improve CR appropriateness patient stable CAD remain unknown . Thus , study aim evaluate whether real-time feedback ACL rightafter angiography improve CR appropriateness . A before-and-after control trial design . In first period time , stable CAD patient undergo elective coronary angiography least one coronary lesion stenosis ≥ 50 % one Chinese cardiac center continuously recruit control group . In second period , eligible patient recruit continuously real-time SS category feedback ACL rightafter angiography give cardiologist . Appropriateness treatment strategy two group analyze determine whether real-time SS feedback improve treatment appropriateness . The appropriateness treatment strategy adjudicate Chinese version appropriate use criterion CR .</brief_summary>
