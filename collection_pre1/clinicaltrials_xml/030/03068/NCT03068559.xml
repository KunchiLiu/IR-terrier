	<brief_title>Consequences Initial Treatment Head Neck Cancer Swallowing Function : Impact Nutritional Status</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Swallowing one main function oral , pharyngeal laryngeal function cooperate . Tumors area , well treatment , seriously impair swallow function , induce dysphagia , common complication still badly diagnose . However , impact constant always negative nutritional status , treatment feasibility patient ' quality life . Many team try determine assessment tool , prevalence dysphagia treatment strategy . Thus , recently , 2014 , Kraaijenga et al . make systematic review literature topic . Only 19 study select two previous year . Out , 7 also literature review , include Raber-Durlacher 's paper listing dysphagia publication 1990 2010 . In 12 selected study , 9 prospective one either small number patient specific treatment focus ( e.g . Intensity Modulation Radiation Therapy , radiochemotherapy ) . For dysphagia assessment , Kraaijenga et al . conclude need simple self-evaluation scale compare professional evaluation one . The recording global indicator functional status weight , dietary change , nutritional tube dependence , also advise . They conclude patient-reported measure commonly apply provided complementary perspective . More recently , 2015 , Schlinder et al . report consensus proposition management swallow difficulty head neck patient treat radiotherapy , discussed 2013 Milan congress . Six cluster statement difficulty reach related : 1 2/ assessment scale : one patient-reported -the MD Anderson Dysphagia Inventory- one operator-reported outcome scale -NCI CTCAE criterion ; 3/ risk factor : research sign symptoms dysphagia consequence e.g . aspiration ; 4/ preventive swallow dysfunction evaluation ( nutritionist deglutologist evaluation ) ; 5/ radiotherapic precaution ; 6/ Preventive therapeutic swallowing exercise . The aim present prospective study ass dysphagia ( occurrence , severity , length ) head neck cancer ( HNC ) , diagnosis 18 month first line treatment regardless treatment . The investigator comply pre-listed cluster . For purpose , pursuant consensus dysphagia assessment , investigator use Deglutition Handicap Index ( DHI ) questionnaire ( Silbergleit 2012 ) dysphagia screen patient 's self-perception . This questionnaire validate French evaluate swallow function patient . Clinical evaluation accord NCI-CTCAE v4.0 criterion objective measure swallow function also record compare DHI result .</detailed_description>
