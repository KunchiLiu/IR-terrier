	<brief_summary>Although exercise-induced desaturation frequently observe patient idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis ( IPF ) short-term effect supplemental oxygen walking investigate yet . Given , walk ability important activity daily life , aim study investigate effect supplemental oxygen endurance walk capacity hypoxemic IPF patient . In study patient perform 3 endurance shuttle walk test ( ESWTs ) 85 % individual peak performance use medical air ( =compressed room air , 2 liters/minute ) , 2 liters/minute oxygen , 4 liters/minute Oxygen double-blinded fashion random order . Since limited pharmacological treatment option IPF patient , study may help provide novel information short-term effect supplemental oxygen . Furthermore may help investigate possibility optimize oxygen therapy order facilitate patients´ participation activity daily life least improve patients´ quality life .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Short-term Effects Supplemental Oxygen Patients With IPF</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Rationale : Exercise-induced desaturation frequently observe patient idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis predicts poorer outcome . However , prospective study large sample size investigate effect oxygen endurance time , oxygen saturation breathe frequency walk lack . Given walk important activity daily life preserve maintenance participate social life , aim investigate effect supplemental oxygen walk IPF patient . The endurance shuttle walk test ( ESWT ) well validate test high reliability validity measure endurance walk capacity patient chronic obstructive pulmonary disease ( COPD ) . The advantage test contrast 6-minute walk test ESWT perform 85 % individual maximum close intensity typical daily activity . Additionally , use ESWT possible determine maximum duration exercise compare value isotime ( = time point short 3 ESWTs end ) , whereas value end different six-minute walk test ( 6MWTs ) comparable case different distance . Aim : To investigate short-term effect supplemental oxygen endurance capacity walking ( ESWT ) patient idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis . Design : This study randomize , control , double-blinded cross-over trial . Following initial incremental shuttle walk test ( ISWT ) order determine individual maximum walking capacity , patient perform 3 endurance shuttle walk test ( ESWT ) 85 % maximal pace . In randomized order , patient complete one ESWT 2l/min oxygen , one 4l/min oxygen one medical air ( =compressed room air ) , whereas patient well investigator blind gas mixture provide . All 3 condition provide via nasal cannula . The time two ESWTs 24 hour order give enough time regeneration . Endurance Walking capacity measure ESWT use primary outcome .</detailed_description>
