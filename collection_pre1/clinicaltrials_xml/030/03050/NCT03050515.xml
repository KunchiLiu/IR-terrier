	<brief_summary>Recurrent urinary tract infection quickly become public health obstacle age population . Almost 50 % woman least one urinary tract infection lifetime ; follow first infection , 25-35 % chance another infection subsequent 3-6 month . With documented infection , patient receives anywhere three seven day course antibiotic treatment . Repeated course antibiotic often lead development multi-drug resistant infection difficult treat arsenal oral medication . It theorize , , urinary tract infection cause bacteria gastrointestinal tract . If generalize gut dysbiosis due repeat course oral antibiotic , likely difficult ever adequately treat repeat urinary tract infection . This theory lead development utilization fecal microbiota transplantation treatment refractory Clostridium difficile diarrhea . There several study report efficacy fecal transplantation treatment C.difficile infection well correction gut dysbiosis . Given positive response treatment refractory infectious diarrhea , investigator propose correction gut dysbiosis also treat refractory recurrent urinary tract infection . Therefore , investigator propose pilot study determine effectiveness fecal transplantation treatment refractory , recurrent urinary tract infection .</brief_summary>
