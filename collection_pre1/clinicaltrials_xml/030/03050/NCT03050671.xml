	<brief_summary>This study aim compare two different external calf compression device apply healthy individual . These device commonly use medical care order prevent formation blood clot , example immobilization surgery . We aim confirm effect external cyclic compression heal blood clotting also identify one effective .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Effects External Leg Compression Devices Healing Blood Clotting</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Aims : 1 . To confirm IPC ( intermittent pneumatic compression ) positive effect systemic coagulation status , tissue metabolic activity , collagen formation tissue microcirculation . 2 . To compare effect two different IPC device : one rapid calf-IPC expels blood vein sharp rapidly one slow calf-IPC , pump blood gentle progressive way . This study could also make implication blood flow parameter could interpret clinical setting , previous haemodynamic study explain superiority rapid device term peak velocity superiority slow device term total ejected volume per individual stimulus . Materials Methods : 10-15 healthy individual plan recruit . The subject lie prone position . A cuff connect Calf-IPC device wrap around calf function 120 minute . Microdialysis catheter insert tip 1 mm volar side Achilles tendon . In addition , one adhesive sensor apply calf distal low part cuff , order measure tissue oxygen mixed saturation ( INVOS ) . Blood sample take via venous catheter antecubital fossa application IPC , 30 , 60 120 minute . From serum , several systemic coagulation factor measure ( tissue plasminogen activator ( tPA ) , plasminogen activator inhibitor type 1 ( PAI ) , tissue factor pathway inhibitor ( TFPI ) , D-dimer , von Willebrand factor factor VIIa ) . From microdialysis diffusate , two group substance measure : ) metabolite , pyruvate b ) collagen macromolecule , procollagen type I III . The ultimate goal assess role different IPC pattern deep venous thrombosis prevention promotion tissue healing .</detailed_description>
