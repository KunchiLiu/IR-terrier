	<detailed_description>After failure docetaxel , standard first line therapy patient metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer ( mCRPC ) , several treatment option currently available . Two treatment option direct androgen receptor ( AR ) , enzalutamide abiraterone . A third option cabazitaxel , next generation taxane . No head-to-head comparison do three therapy second-line mCRPC yet , optimal choice unknown . Resistance AR-targeted therapy least part consequence signal constitutively active AR splice variant ( AR-Vs ) . Because AR splice variant occur conversion castration-resistant tumor , acquire systemic therapy mCRPC , analysis castration-naïve primary tumor informative set second-line treatment mCRPC . Circulating tumor cell ( CTCs ) analyze repetitively real-time . Recently , AR-V7 messenger ribonucleid acid ( mRNA ) expression CTCs show associated lack response AR-targeted therapy ( reference 1 ) . AR-V7 mRNA expression seem hind response cabazitaxel retrospective pilot study ( reference 2 ) two recently publish retrospective study ( reference 3 reference 4 ) . Therefore hypothesize mRNA expression AR-V7 CTCs assess start second-line treatment mCRPC affect prostate-specific antigen ( PSA ) response cabazitaxel patient progress docetaxel . Patients eligible undergo second third line treatment ask undergo prescreening consist CTC count , case ≥3 CTCs detect , AR V7 determination . Patients ≥3 CTCs AR-V7 expression ask sign second inform consent enter treatment study . In study receive Cabazitaxel 25 mg/m² every 3 week plus prednisone 10 mg daily , undergo repeat blood sample biomarker sample collection . During prescreening patient , 2 x 10 mL blood drawn enumeration isolation CTCs . All patient ≥3 CTCs AR-V7 expression ask sign consent treatment study . All patient include treatment study administrate cabazitaxel intravenously dose 25 mg/m² , one-hour infusion every 3 week , well continuous treatment prednisone 5 mg orally twice daily , 10 mg daily . In treatment study patient , additional 2 x 10 mL blood drawn third cycle treatment CTC enumeration isolation . An additional 10 mL blood drawn storage plasma baseline start every cycle ( i.e. , every 3 week ) analysis cell-free DNA ( cfDNA ) . Moreover , 4 x 5 mL blood ( baseline ; end infusion , 2 6 hour end first cabazitaxel infusion ) drawn pharmacokinetic study , order explore cabazitaxel exposure effect relation .</detailed_description>
