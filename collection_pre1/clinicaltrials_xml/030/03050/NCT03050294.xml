	<detailed_description>Psoriasis atopic dermatitis chronic inflammatory disease account significant amount patient dermatological practice . Topical corticosteroid agent often prescribed treatment condition , especially localize rather wide spread . Prolonged treatment corticosteroid occasionally result resistance treatment . The development resistance treatment term tachyphylaxis . Tachyphylaxis think result regulation target receptor , result decrease metabolic effect compound . Poor adherence , rather regulation receptor , may primary cause tachyphylaxis topical corticosteroid . Patients ' use topical medication decrease time . Topical spray vehicle become increasingly popular rapid application ease use . Desoximetasone 0.25 % spray well-tolerated , FDA approve , potent topical corticosteroid rapidly successfully treat inflammatory skin disease . Lots treatment option exist psoriasis ; however , patient get good use medication . These patient say resistant disease . In study , define resistant disease failure previous topical steroid treatment . Poor adherence barrier positive clinical outcome . Failure respond medication may result poor adherence rather resistance topical therapy . The purpose study delineate two . The primary objective study determine , condition design assure good adherence , whether topical 0.25 % desoximetasone spray improve clinical outcome patient resistant inflammatory skin disease define failure previous topical steroid treatment . We propose enroll 12 subject psoriasis 12 subject atopic dermatitis `` fail '' previous topical treatment . Subjects require body surface area involvement reasonably treat topical treatment . At baseline visit , patient give Topicort spray show use . Patients apply medication initial visit supervision . Subjects atopic dermatitis treat 1 week ; subject psoriasis treat 2 week . Visits take place baseline , 3 day , 1 week , case psoriasis , 2 week . All subject enrol study receive nominal compensation per visit . To assure good adherence treatment , patient call twice day , morning evening , predetermine time go use medication . Disease severity measure EASI ( atopic dermatitis ) /PASI ( psoriasis ) , Investigator Global Assessment ( IGA ) , Pruritus Visual Analog Scale ( Pruritus VAS ) . Based previous experience , expect rapid improvement disease severity measure good adherence short term use highly effective topical treatment . Mean median change efficacy measure report . In primary analysis , Wilcoxon sign rank test use analyze improvement assessment end study compare baseline .</detailed_description>
