	<brief_summary>Background : Traumatic brain injury ( TBI ) damage connection brain cell . This lead problem like memory loss . Repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation ( rTMS ) help improve connection brain area healthy people . Researchers want see useful patient memory problem TBI . Objective : To see repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation use improve connection part brain whether lead change memory . Eligibility : Adults 18 50 year old TBI speak write English . Healthy volunteer age English ability . Design : Participants screen neurological exam may urine pregnancy test . Participants TBI 7-15 visit . Healthy volunteer 2-8 . At visit , participant follow : MRI 1 hour . They lie machine take picture magnetic field . They memory task . Memory attention task picture computer Questions mental state well-being TMS : A wire coil hold scalp short electrical current pass . Participants hear click feel pull twitch . They may ask make simple movement . rTMS repeat magnetic pulse short burst . They 20 minute . A week last visit , participant return memory test .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Objective : To use rest state functional connectivity ( FC ) biomarker synaptic modulation repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation ( rTMS ) paradigm intend improve memory learn pilot one paradigm improve memory traumatic brain injury ( TBI ) patient . Ancillary outcome include effect rTMS explicit implicit memory system potential effect manipulate one system . Study population : Healthy adult volunteer patient TBI Design : The study contain 3 experiment . Experiment 1 design establish number rTMS session require produce meaningful change rest parietohippocampal FC healthy subject . Experiment 2 apply information experiment aim enhance fronto-striatal FC , secondary outcome , enhance implicit memory . This intervention contrast parietal stimulation negative control condition ( vertex stimulation ) between-groups design . In Experiment 3 , adapt paradigm use others healthy subject amnestic TBI patient effort enhance parieto-hippocampal FC , secondary outcome , explicit memory . This compare negative control ( vertex ) stimulation within-subjects design Outcome measure : The primary outcome measure change FC produce serially apply rTMS . Secondary measure change explicit implicit memory performance . We explore whether white matter integrity predict change FC healthy subject patient .</detailed_description>
