	<brief_summary>Investigators propose placebo control , double blind study examine efficacy topical Gelnique 3 % TM ( 3 % oxybutynin ) daily 20 week ) improve IENF density type 2 diabetic subject establish peripheral neuropathy . This site clearly demonstrate efficacy topiramate reverse IENF loss within 18 week prior study . Subjects also undergo quantitative sensory testing ( QST ) assay laser Doppler skin blood flow ( SkBF ) , neuropathy total symptom score ( NTSS-6 ) , quality life ( Norfolk QOL-DN ) , along standard measure physiology fast blood chemistry . Subjects IENF loss 20-75 % normative value thus amenable therapy-induced recovery , randomize placebo ( N=30 ) active drug ( N=30 ) arm instruct apply 84 mg Gelnique 3 % TM hydrogel placebo cover 2 in2 region skin adjacent initial biopsy site , per manufacturer instruction ( http : //www.gelnique.com/gel3/ ) . Treatment continue daily 20 week , monthly phone call monitor compliance . After 20 week , subject return second series measurement 3 mm skin biopsy treat region skin .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Patient selection characterization A total 60 adult sexes vary ethnicity , 30-80 year age , recruit Dr. Vinik 's clinic . All participant diagnose establish type 2 diabetes ( &gt; 2 year ) diabetic peripheral neuropathy . Potential subject undergo complete physical exam neurological exam ass motor function sensory perception28 . Randomizing blind investigational drug do assign patient/subject study number order recruit . The patient randomize use randomize web site ( www.randomizer.org ) . The randomized patient number record . This code place envelope seal . This envelope remain sealed study conclude . A blinding/randomization patient form complete patient seal individual envelope . The outside envelope contain patient number identification purpose . This allow research coordinator break individual blind emergency situation without compromise rest blinding data . All instance blind broken document appropriately . Subject Recruitment Subjects sexes ethnicity recruit locally use database subject available The Strelitz Diabetes Research Center ( SDRC ) Eastern Virginia Medical School ( EVMS ) well locally distribute flyer notice , need . Approximately 60 randomized subject need study make useful determination current future study . Subjects drop withdraw study replace . Sample size estimation data analysis : Investigators primarily power study base variance data obtain study demonstrate efficacy Topiramate IENF density diabetic subjects11 . The sample size 20 group ( placebo vs. active drug ) reflect ability detect 20 % deviation follow treatment also sufficient identify therapy-induced improvement SkBF NTTS-6 score use similar study design28 . We intend use ANOVA MANOVA data normally distribute raw form case simple log-transformations . Based consideration , 20 subject group provide power great 0.80 observe statistical significance p &lt; 0.05 level . Relationships among measure neurovascular function change IENF determine Spearman 's rank correlation . If data normally distribute , Wilcoxon signed-rank ( within group ) Mann Whitney ( group ) test may employ . The level significance set p &lt; 0.05 . FUTURE USE OF BIOLOGICAL SPECIMENS AND BANKING PROTOCOL After require test finish , subject ask leftover specimen may store future research instead throw away . Subjects ask sign addendum IRB approve consent form ( # 07-08-FB-0167 ) allow storage biological specimen . An IRB application submit use store sample . Study activity take place review approval EVMS IRB ( approve IRB ) . The IRB fundamental charge protect right welfare human participant research . The EVMS Federal Wide Assurance assure research activity guide ethical principle The Belmont Report ( respect person , beneficence , justice ) activity comply 45CFR46 , regardless fund source . These principle implement process inform consent share information , ensure subject comprehension select volunteer without coercion undue influence . SAFETY EVALUATIONS AND ADVERSE EVENT REPORTING Adverse event ( AE 's ) record subject . Relationship study procedure perform documented investigator . Serious Adverse Events ( SAEs ) pregnancy , occur study , report immediately upon discovery appropriate agency ( Institutional Review Board ( IRB ) . Serious Adverse Events define adverse event study result one follow outcome , significant reason : - Death - Initial prolong inpatient hospitalization - A life-threatening experience ( , immediate risk die ) - Persistent significant disability/incapacity - Congenital anomaly/birth defect The principal investigator review safety progress study monthly basis . The principal investigator review protocol continue basis subject safety . Risks Protection Against Risk All subject monitor adverse and/or unexpected event . All information data keep strict confidence . No information give anyone without permission study participant . Risks participant minimize subject selection , document informed consent study participant , provision make protection privacy confidentiality data , data monitoring ensure subject safety . Data cod linkage participant available investigator . The database password protect investigative staff access database . All subject name personally identifiable data cod personal information ( e.g. , name , social security number , driver ' license number , address phone number ) remain private . Only study investigator access information . Participants personally identify report publication . Reproductive Risk Gelnique 3 % classified pregnancy category class B drug . Animal reproduction study fail demonstrate risk fetus adequate well-controlled study pregnant woman . Serum HcG test pregnancy perform screen . All participant ask use birth control barrier method ( i.e . condom , diaphragm ) , oral contraceptive , intrauterine device surgically sterilize . Pregnancies treat adverse event follow term . Database Protection All data locally monitor accord Strelitz Diabetes Center Standard Operating Procedures ( see procedure ) standard precaution make protect personal health information . 1 . Assign unique secure User ID/password combination clinical research team member access computerized system ( ) . Ensure user login use unique User ID/password combination electronic signature prepare perform computer data entry management function . 2 . Establish maintain schedule change team member 's User ID/password combination appropriate interval . 3 . Invalidate stolen , lose otherwise compromise User ID/password combination replace new combination . 4 . Ensure proper computer system function routinely monitor . 5 . Ensure computerized system securely store use . 6 . Log computer data entry/management activity complete .</detailed_description>
