	<brief_summary>The primary objective cross-sectional study assess prevalence post-thrombotic syndrome ( PTS ) two treatment arm RE-COVER study ( warfarin versus dabigatran ) . PTS assess recently develop Patient Reported Villalta ( PRV ) Score . Secondary objective : ass treatment arm 1 . Prevalence recurrent venous thromboembolism ( VTE ) discontinuation study treatment . 2 . Prevalence PTS determine standard Villalta score . 3 . Health related Quality Life ( HRQoL ) .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Prevalence Post-Thrombotic Syndrome Deep-Vein Thrombosis ( DVT ) Patients Treated With Dabigatran</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>In RE-COVER- RE-COVER II study , 5109 patient deep-vein thrombosis ( DVT ) and/or pulmonary embolism ( PE ) randomize receive 6 month treatment either dabigatran ( 150 mg twice daily ) warfarin ( daily maintain international normalize ratio ( INR ) 2.0-3.0 ) . All patient receive initial 5-7 day phase parenteral anticoagulant treatment . The study design double blind , double dummy trial . RE-COVER conduct April 2006 November 2008 RE-COVER II June 2008 October 2010 ; complete 2009 2011 , respectively . A substantial number patient expect developed post-thrombotic syndrome ( PTS ) . However , since dabigatran provide stable level anticoagulation throughout treatment period know quality anticoagulation important factor development PTS , anticipate low rate PTS see dabigatran treat patient compare warfarin . Patients interview examined investigator accept attend clinic visit . Otherwise , telephone interview perform patient refuse meet . PTS determine use Patient Reported Villalta ( PRV ) Score form . However , meet consultation addition assess PTS standard Villalta score . The primary endpoint prevalence PTS determine Patient Reported Villalta ( PRV ) score . The secondary endpoint 1- objectively verified DVT PE discontinuation treatment , 2- prevalence PTS determine standard Villalta score , 3- health relate quality life ( HRQOL ) determine EQ-5D ( www.euroqol.org ) Venous Insufficiency Epidemiological Economic Study quality life symptom ( VEINES-QOL/Sym ) questionnaires . The investigator recruit subpopulation patient include RE-COVER study Norway , Sweden , Denmark Canada .</detailed_description>
