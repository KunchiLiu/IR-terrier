	<brief_title>Infant Minor Head Trauma Clinical Decision Rule</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Apparently minor head trauma ( MHT ) , define Glasgow coma scale score ( GCS ) 14-15 , frequently assess group among population child attend Emergency Department ( ED ) head trauma . Less 1 % child MHT clinically important traumatic brain injury ( ciTBI ) require immediate specific care , especially neurosurgery . Those ciTBI identify rapidly . Assessment child &lt; 2 year particularly difficult . This may promote excessive compute tomography ( CT ) scan ordering age group , youngest sensitive risk secondary malignity induce ionize radiation CT scan . In USA , 31 % child &lt; 2 year MHT undergo CT scan . Data CT scan use France unavailable subject practice variation . The predictive value TBI clinical variable vomit , immediate loss consciousness , impact seizure , severe injury mechanism , scalp hematoma skull fracture , controversial . A short clinical observation child sign post-traumatic symptom make decision regard CT scan order seem beneficial , allow selective CT scan use child whose symptom fail resolve . To improve patient care , clinical decision rule attempt risk-stratify need scan emerge literature . Age-based PECARN rule derive validate large cohort 10 718 child &lt; 2 year reference management minor head trauma . The PECARN rule identifies ciTBIs optimal sensitivity high rate normal scan identify non-significant lesion ( expect CT scan rate : 23 % ; ciTBI : 0,85 % ) . This North American rule recommend Emergency Medicine French Society management minor head injury . This study aim evaluate performance PELICAN rule , decision rule management apparently minor head trauma child &lt; 2 year propose targeted indication CT scan use defines precise indication clinical observation . The PELICAN rule build literature review predictive value TBI clinical variable intention minimize CT scan rate without miss ciTBI . The primary objective ass performance PELICAN clinical prediction rule identify clinical-important traumatic brain injury apparently minor head trauma ( GCS 14-15 ) infant le 2 year . The performance PECARN TBI prediction rule apply large national French population also assist compare PELICAN rule term security , efficacy expect impact CT ordering .</detailed_description>
