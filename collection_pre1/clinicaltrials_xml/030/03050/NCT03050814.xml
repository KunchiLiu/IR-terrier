	<brief_summary>Background : Colorectal cancer common cancer U.S . It cause second cancer-related death . The drug avelumab vaccine Ad-CEA together help immune system fight cancer . Objective : To test avelumab Ad-CEA plus standard therapy treat colorectal cancer spread sit well standard therapy alone . Eligibility : People age 18 older untreated colorectal cancer spread body Design : Participants screen : Test see cancer certain deficiency Blood , urine , heart test Scans Medical history Physical exam Tumor sample . This previous procedure . A small group participant get Ad-CEA avelumab plus standard therapy . This FOLFOX plus bevacizumab 24 week capecitabine plus bevacizumab . The others treatment 2-week cycle . They Arm A B : Arm A : FOLFOX bevacizumab IV day 1 2 12 cycle . After , capecitabine mouth twice day bevacizumab IV day 1 . Arm B : Ad-CEA injection every 2 12 week . Avelumab IV day 1 cycle . FOLFOX bevacizumab IV day 2 3 12 cycle . Then , capecitabine mouth twice day bevacizumab IV day 2 . Participants repeat screen test study . Participants treat disease get bad bad side effect . Arm A participant join Arm B . They visit 4 5 week stop therapy .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Background - Colorectal cancer ( CRC ) fourth common cancer diagnosis United States account second cancer-related death . - Programmed death ligand 1 ( PD-L1 ) transmembrane protein first identify role maintenance self-tolerance prevention autoimmunity . Blockade interaction PD-L1 tumor cell PD-1 T cell expect reverse T cell suppression within tumor . These agent dependent underlie T cell activation tumor cell effective . - Avelumab fully human IgG1 anti-PDL1 antibody selectively bind PD-L1 competitively block interaction PD-1 . - In ongoing phase 1 trial avelumab , agent well tolerate show clinical activity . Clinical trial anti-PD-1/L1 agent colorectal cancer result minimal activity patient mismatch repair deficiency ( MMR-D ) - Therapeutic cancer vaccine target overexpressed protein offer potential method activate T cell tumor . - A novel adenovirus base , CEA-targeting vaccine demonstrate cytolytic T cell responses patient metastatic colorectal cancer . - Standard care agent first line metastatic CRC property associate improved immune response via immunologic cell death immunogenic modulation . Objectives -To determine improvement progression free survival among patient metastatic colorectal cancer lack mismatch repair deficiency treat standard care + anti- PDL1 monoclonal antibody + Ad-CEA therapeutic cancer vaccine compare standard care alone . Eligibility - Subjects age 18 old previously untreated pathologically confirm metastatic colorectal cancer ; prior adjuvant therapy acceptable - ECOG performance status &lt; 1 - Normal organ bone marrow function - Subjects active autoimmune disease require treatment subject require system steroid ( except physiologic dos steroid replacement ) allow - Tumor tissue ( block ) sample whole blood sample must available proteomics , genomics transcriptomics analysis . Archival FFPE tumor tissue block ( &lt; 24 week prior come study ) minimum tissue surface area 25 mm2 , 75 micro meter thick , least 30 % malignant tissue must available ; leftover material fresh biopsy collect diagnosis screening may also utilize . - Subjects metastatic colorectal cancer mismatch repair deficiency ( MMR-D MSI-High ) eligible Design - This randomize , multicenter phase II clinical trial design evaluate potential improvement progression free survival ( PFS ) Avelumab Ad-CEA vaccine use combination standard care therapy metastatic colorectal cancer compare standard care alone ( FOLFOX-B ) . - A lead cohort , comprise first 6 evaluable subject enrol , treat avelumab + Ad- CEA vaccine + standard care order ass safety combination . - If 1 subject lead cohort experience dose limit toxicity attributable IND agent , 70 evaluable subject randomize 1:1 basis receive either Avelumab + Ad-CEA vaccine + standard care ( Arm B ) standard care alone ( Arm A ) . - Standard care therapy consist 6 12 two week cycle bevacizumab + FOLFOX ( 5-FU , leucovorin , oxaliplatin ) follow two week cycle bevacizumab + capecitabine disease progression . - Subjects assign Arm A progressive disease offer Avelumab + Ad-CEA vaccine combination standard chemotherapy regimen . - Kaplan-Meier curve two-tailed log-rank test primary analysis method . - The accrual ceiling study set 81 .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>INCLUSION CRITERIA : Subjects must previously untreated metastatic colorectal cancer contraindication treatment standard care regimen determine investigator . Prior adjuvant therapy acceptable ( include immunotherapy ) , must complete least 6 month prior metastatic disease diagnosis . Patients eligible potentially curative surgical intervention case oligometastic disease time enrollment must actively refuse explicit discussion potential benefit intervention multidisciplinary team . Metastatic disease must histologically confirm tumor sample pathologic diagnosis confirm enrolling institution . Tumor block FFPE tumor tissue attain within prior 6 month treatment sample enrollment must available ; otherwise , fresh tumor biopsy collect . Tumor tissue ( block ) sample whole blood sample must available proteomics , genomics transcriptomics analysis . Archival FFPE tumor tissue block ( &lt; 24 week prior come study ) minimum tissue surface area 25 mm2 , 75 micrometer thick , least 30 % malignant tissue must available ; leftover sample fresh tumor biopsy collect diagnostic/clinical purpose screen may also utilize formalinfixed paraffinembedded . Patients must measurable disease RECIST criterion . Age great equal to18 year . Because safety data know agent patient le 18 year old , child exclude study . ECOG performance status less equal 1 . Patients must normal organ marrow function define : Creatinine clearance ( CockroftGault calculate 24hour urine ) great equal 30 mL/min . Adequate hepatic function define total bilirubin level less equal 1.5 ( SqrRoot ) upper limit normal range ( ULN ) , aspartate aminotransferase ( AST ) , level less equal 2.5 ( SqrRoot ) ULN , alanine aminotransferase ( ALT ) level less equal 2.5 ( SqrRoot ) ULN , subject document metastatic disease liver , AST ALT level less equal 5 ( SqrRoot ) ULN .
