	<brief_summary>The investigator interested degree individual persist individualized treatment goal cue ( external food , internal anxiety ) high impulsive/maladaptive behavior ( e.g. , purging , eat , etc. ) . The investigator want find specific high-difficulty situation ass whether participant remain mindful big picture willing work toward therapeutic goal . Also , investigator want rate participant degree success ( e.g. , proportion calorie eat ) assess objectively . The theory work memory capacity ( WMC ) modulate ability keep longer-term goal mind face current stress/temptations . For example , ability control drink one implicit urge drink predict WMC . The ability apply novel emotional regulation skill time stress also predict WMC . Indeed , generic ability pursue goal future ( assessed discounting value future goal ) reliably predict WMC . There also evidence activation brain region associate WMC ( direct activation dorsolateral prefrontal cortex via transcranial magnetic stimulation ( TMS ) , person complete relevant cognitive task ) improve delay discounting . Accordingly , investigator propose study ass link WMC relevant clinical measure note , well change measure follow activation WM cognitive prime ( WM task ) . The overall design call initial WMC assessment , follow randomization complete 3 day WM prime 3 day prime group , vice versa . The investigator assess clinical outcome note across follow 6 day , WM prime first prime first occur prior target behavior . The investigator prime WM prior participant 's evening meal , WM intervention offer free time meal .</brief_summary>
