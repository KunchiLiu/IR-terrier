	<detailed_description>Chest injury common patient polytrauma responsible approximate 25 % trauma-related mortality . Traumatic injury thorax often result accumulation blood within pleural space ( i.e . hemothorax ( HTX ) ) . The management HTX remain clinical dilemma volume blood small moderate patient hemodynamically stable . Prior ubiquitous use chest compute tomography ( CT ) , diagnose quantity blood &lt; 1000 mL challenge ( especially give inherent limitation standard chest radiograph ( CXR ) ) . With widespread adoption CT `` pan-scanning '' however , significantly HTXs detect . The clinical significance optimal treatment small moderate HTXs remain unknown . Although HTXs effectively manage tube thoracostomy ( TT ) drainage pleural space ( i.e . chest tube placement ) , intervention associate numerous potential major complication , include iatrogenic injury , retain HTX , empyema 22 % patient . The East American Association Trauma guideline suggest HTXs consider TT drainage . However , prospective observational study suggest small moderate HTXs could absorb without intervention . Classic study 1960 's also indicate much large quantity blood reabsorb without intervention well . As result , unclear chest tube over-utilized patient may actually require . Retrospective data 2,000 patient also suggest many traumatic HTXs manage expectantly without TT drainage . Finally many small occult HTXs ( diagnose CXR , later detect CT scan ) may also safely observe , thus support concept expectant management ( EM ) many HTXs goal minimize patient morbidity . The Foothills Medical Centre recently report retrospective study include 635 patient traumatic HTXs . Overall , 491 ( 66 % ) HTXs drain 258 ( 34 % ) manage expectantly . Independent predictor TT placement include concomitant ipsilateral flail chest pneumothorax . It also become evident clinical practice directly dependent specific size HTX . Although adjusted odds mortality significantly different group ( OR 3.99 ; 95 % CI 0.87-18.30 ; p = 0.08 ) , TT associate 47.14 % ( 95 % CI , 25.57-69.71 % ; p &lt; 0.01 ) adjust increase hospital length stay . Empyemas ( n = 29 ) also occur among TT patient . The author conclude expectant management traumatic HTX associate short length hospital stay , empyema , increase mortality . Although EM small HTXs appear safe optimal , finding must confirm large randomize control trial . The purpose study therefore conduct randomize control study compare patient traumatic HTX manage TT EM . Characterization HTXs require pleural drainage versus manage conservatively optimally define . The result study inform care future trauma patient present common injury throughout globe .</detailed_description>
