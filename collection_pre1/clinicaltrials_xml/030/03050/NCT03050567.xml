	<brief_summary>Hardening neck vessel ( carotid artery ) cause fatty deposit call 'plaques ' common cause stroke . Over time plaque burst may lead severe narrowing ( stenosis ) neck artery . When plaque burst , small clot fatty particle ( call microemboli ) break , block brain vessel lead stroke . Researchers incomplete understanding process cause harden artery , development small clot unable predict stroke . At present , ultrasound scan evaluates circulation head detects small clot call Transcranial Doppler ultrasound . The aim study test simple ultrasound technique see detect signal may correspond small clot fatty particle . The objective see repeatable ultrasound technique . This may help identify patient harden neck artery higher risk recurrent stroke . This could also potentially improve patient selection target surgical future novel pharmacological therapy .</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Healthy volunteer previous history cerebrovascular disease age 18 year old . Patients symptomatic cerebrovascular event ( stroke , transient ischaemic attack amaurosis fugax ) image confirm carotid artery stenosis &gt; 30 % . This include patient schedule carotid endarterectomy ( &gt; 50 % men &gt; 70 % woman , North American Symptomatic Carotid Endarterectomy Trial criterion ) treat conservatively optimal medical therapy ( patient decline surgical intervention outside surgical criterion carotid endarterectomy ) . Subjects unable comply study procedure severe disable stroke . Inadequate temporal window Transcranial Doppler assessment . Adults incapacity .</criteria>
