	<brief_summary>While well recognize hereditary factor contribute development subset human cancer , cause many cancer remain unknown . The application next generation sequencing ( NGS ) technology expand knowledge field hereditary cancer predisposition . Currently , 100 cancer predispose gene identify , estimate approximately 10 % cancer patient underlie genetic predisposition . The purpose protocol identify novel cancer predispose gene and/or genetic variant . For study , investigator establish Data Registry link Repository biological sample . Health information , blood sample occasionally leftover tumor sample collect individual familial cancer . The investigator use NGS approach find change gene may important development familial cancer . The information gain study may provide new good way diagnose care people hereditary cancer . PRIMARY OBJECTIVE : - Establish registry family cluster cancer clinical data link repository cryopreserved blood cell , germline DNA , tumor tissue proband family member . SECONDARY OBJECTIVE : - Identify novel cancer predispose gene and/or genetic variant family cluster cancer underlie genetic basis unknown .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>During study , blood sample obtain participant , well medical family history . When possible , leftover tumor sample also collect . If participant agree re-contacted future , ask year update health information family history . A blood sample drawn St. Jude convenient place participant 's choice . Blood stored St. Jude Biorepository . The DNA sample study determine change specific gene might explain cancer participant family member . When available , consent give participant , previously collect store leftover tumor sample , bone marrow sample store DNA may analyze . Genetic variant interest include : 1 ) mutation know gene may escape detection prior clinical genetic testing ; 2 ) cod mutation predict disrupt protein function , particularly gene pathway know associated cancer ; 3 ) potential mutation regulatory region genome , predict epigenetic study . In case , individual know predispose mutation exhibit milder , severe atypical phenotype . Family member harbor predispose mutation discordant cancer phenotype select cellular genetic study . These include DNA sequence possibly also creation analysis induce pluripotent stem cell ( iPSC ) , transcriptome epigenetic analysis . All sample identify code removal personal identifiable information . Samples remain repository current future study .</detailed_description>
