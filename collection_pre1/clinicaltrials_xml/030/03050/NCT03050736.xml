	<brief_title>Safety Study VAL-083 Radiotherapy Patients With Newly Diagnosed GBM Having Unmethylated MGMT Expression</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Malignant glioma common primary central nervous system tumor find adult , WHO Grade IV malignant glioma ( GBM ) represent aggressive prevalent sub-type tumor one bad 5-year survival rate among human cancer . Standard therapy patient malignant gliomas traditionally involve maximal surgical resection/debulking primary tumor ( feasible ) , follow adjuvant radiotherapy 6-8 week , without chemotherapy . The oral alkylating agent temozolomide find increase median survival use combination radiotherapy , compare radiotherapy alone , patient newly diagnose GBM . However , expression O6-methylguanine methyltransferase ( MGMT ) GBM link poor patient outcome patient treat temozolomide . The study drug , dianhydrogalactitol ( VAL 083 ) bi-functional N7 DNA alkylating agent demonstrate cytotoxic activity independent chemo-resistance due expression MGMT . This make VAL-083 ideal candidate treat patient unlikely respond temozolomide due MGMT expression GBM . Furthermore , VAL-083 act radio-sensitizer low ( 1 - 2.5μM ) concentration GBM culture test . VAL-083 study extensively United States National Cancer Institute . The NCI study suggest VAL-083 appear activity type cancer ( lung brain ) , include GBM ; however , VAL-083 research pursue US due increase focus target biologic therapy era . VAL-083 also study People 's Republic China , currently approve market treatment chronic myeloid leukemia lung cancer . At present , VAL-083 study clinical trial United States third-line treatment option patient recurrent GBM follow failure surgery , radiation therapy , temozolomide bevacizumab . Interim result support safety VAL-083 population ; date , regimen 40mg/m2/d x 3 day IV 21 day cycle confirm safe well tolerate . This phase 2 , open-label , single arm study conduct dose-escalation cohort scheme confirm optimal dose VAL-083 , administer concurrently radiation therapy . Dose escalation proceed three sequential cohort , consist patient receive VAL-083 20 , 30 40 mg/m2/d x 3 every 21 day . This trial conduct 2 part . Part 1 consist 1 ) 42-day induction period , patient receive VAL-083 undergoing radiation treatment dose 2 Gy per fraction give daily five day per week ( Monday Friday ) period six week ( total dose 60 Gy ) , follow 2 ) adjuvant maintenance therapy VAL-083 alone , administer daily x 3 IV every 3 week assign dose , maximum 8 maintenance cycle . Part 2 comprise expansion phase , VAL-083 study 20 additional subject . The dose VAL-083 study Part 2 determine Part 1 . Patients undergo safety assessment include physical examination , vital sign , hematology , serum chemistry , urinalysis . In part study , pharmacokinetic study may conduct treatment Cycle 1 Day 1 , consent patient . For patient consent CSF collection lumbar puncture , CSF sample obtain completion Cycle 1 , Day 3 VAL-083 infusion . These patient also blood sample take VAL-083 plasma level completion drug infusion . Response parameter evaluate accord Response Assessment NeuroOncology ( RANO ) .</detailed_description>
