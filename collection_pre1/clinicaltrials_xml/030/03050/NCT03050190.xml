	<detailed_description>Background : T cell modify lentiviral chimeric antigen receptor ( CAR ) gene study different clinical setting . Recent successes suggest increase costimulatory signal CAR design critical long term efficacy . Activation T cell response large tumor burden may induce severe response . To increase safety , novel design use inducible caspase 9 fusion gene incorporate CAR gene . A 4th generation CAR lentiviral vector ( 4SCAR ) carry multiple costimulatory signal CD28/CD137/CD27 plus inducible apoptotic caspase 9 gene establish . The study aim evaluate activity new CAR gene-modified T cell target CD19-positive tumor base CD19-specific single chain gene construct 4SCAR ( 4SCAR19 ) . Objective : To evaluate safety efficacy administrate 4SCAR19 T cell patient CD19 positive B cell malignancy follow cyclophosphamide/fludarabine base condition regimen . Eligibility : Patients older 6-month-old CD19 positive B cell malignancy recur refractory standard therapy deem incurable use standard treatment . Design : Participants screen base cancer cell phenotype analyze use flow cytometry immunohistochemical staining method . Peripheral blood mononuclear cell ( PBMC ) obtain apheresis , T cell activate modify express 4SCAR19 gene . On Day -5 -7 , PBMC activate enriched T cell , follow 4SCAR19 lentiviral transduction . The total cell preparation time approximately 5-7 day . Participants receive preparative conditioning regimen comprise cyclophosphamide/fludarabine prepare immune system accommodate modify CAR T cell . The preparative regimen base patient immune condition consistent standard chemotherapy condition regimen . Participants receive infusion modify 4SCAR19 T cell closely follow treatment-related response . Participants continuously monitor CAR T cell clinical response present timeline .</detailed_description>
