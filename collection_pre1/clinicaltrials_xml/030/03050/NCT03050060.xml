	<brief_summary>This phase II trial study well image guide hypofractionated radiation therapy work nelfinavir mesylate nivolumab treat patient melanoma , lung cancer , kidney cancer spread . Hypofractionated radiation therapy deliver high dos radiation therapy short period time may kill tumor cell few side effect . Nelfinavir mesylate may stop growth tumor cell block enzymes need cell growth . Monoclonal antibody , nivolumab , may interfere ability tumor cell grow spread . Giving hypofractionated radiation therapy , nelfinavir mesylate , nivolumab may work well treat patient melanoma , lung , kidney cancer .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . Safety , tolerability preliminary assessment overall response rate ( ORR ) combination hypofractionated radiotherapy nivolumab nelfinavir mesylate ( nelfinavir ) . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I. Correlate overall response rate ( ORR ) : smoking status , underlie genetic mutation know ( e.g . : Kras , BRAF ) circulate cell-free deoxyribonucleic acid ( cfDNA ) , circulate tumor cell , PDL-1 expression tumor peripheral blood T cell receptor repertoire sequencing . II . Progression-free survival ( PFS ) -6 ( systemic control ) : proportion patient free progression 6 month . III . Overall survival . IV . The type frequency adverse event . OUTLINE : Beginning 7-14 day prior start nivolumab , patient receive nelfinavir mesylate orally ( PO ) twice daily ( BID ) day 1-14 course 4 . Patients also receive nivolumab intravenously ( IV ) 60 minute day 1 . Courses repeat every 14 day absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . Patients undergo hypofractionated radiation therapy 3-14 day start course 2 nivolumab . After completion study treatment , patient follow 30 day every 6 month 2 year .</detailed_description>
