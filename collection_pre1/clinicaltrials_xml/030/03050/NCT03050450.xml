	<brief_summary>Independently , lenalidomide vorinostat show promising activity pediatric central nervous system tumor . These agent typically part first-line study , although agent serious interest currently clinical trial investigation . This study evaluate combination lenalidomide vorinostat high grade progressive central nervous system tumor child .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Study Lenalidomide With Vorinostat Pediatric Patients With High Grade Progressive CNS Tumors</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Brain tumor second common cause cancer pediatrics lead cause cancer death child . For child relapse , refractory , recurrent brain tumor , new agent new combination need . This study phase I study design provide objective observation toxicity establish maximum tolerated dose combination . In addition , study observe response child relapse refractory central nervous system tumor . Lenalidomide dose orally daily day 1-21 consecutive day 28 day cycle . Vorinostat dose orally daily day 1-7 15-21 28-day cycle.Doses escalate accord standard phase 1 dose escalation criterion . In absence treatment delay due adverse event ( ) , treatment may continue 24 cycle .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Must histologically confirm central nervous system malignancy standard curative measure exist loner effective Must measurable disease may receive vorinostat lenalidomide combination At least 3 week since prior chemotherapy At least 6 week last nitrosurea At least 6 week autologous transplant At least 3 month bone marrow donor transplant At least 3 week focal radiation At least 6 week craniospinal radiation Must receive growth factor within 1 week study entry Must stable decrease dose steroid 1 week prior Must receive chemo , biologic , radiation therapy Must receive enzyme induce anticonvulsant valproic acid Must receive prothrombotic agent Karnofsky Lansky performance status ≥50 % Life expectancy great 8 week Patients must normal organ marrow function , include Absolute neutrophil count ≥1,000/mcL Platelets ≥100,000/mcL Pulse oximetry &gt; 93 % Total bilirubin ≤ 1.5 x upper limit normal ( ULN ) AST ( SGOT ) /ALT ( SGPT ) ≤2.5 × institutional upper limit normal Creatinine within normal institutional limit OR Creatinine clearance ≥60 mL/min/1.73 m2 patient creatinine level institutional normal The effect vorinostat lenalidomide develop human fetus unknown.For reason agent use trial know teratogenic , woman childbearing potential must commit complete abstinence use TWO method birth control ( one highly effective ( i.e . IUD , birth control pill , injection , implant , tubal ligation , partner 's vasectomy ) , one additional method ( i.e . male condom , diaphragm , cervical cap ) duration study participation least 28 day completion . Females childbearing potential must agree ongoing pregnancy test counsel every 28 day pregnancy precaution . If female menstrual period precede 24 consecutive month hysterectomy , two method birth control requirement apply . Should woman become pregnant suspect pregnant partner participate study , inform treat physician immediately . Men treat enrol protocol must agree use condom duration study participation , 28 day completion . Patient recover acute toxic effect prior therapy Patients receive investigational agent History allergic reaction attribute compound similar chemical biologic composition vorinostat lenalidomide Uncontrolled intercurrent illness include , limited , ongoing active infection , dyspnea rest , symptomatic congestive heart failure , history thromboembolism unrelated central line , patient know predisposition syndrome thromboembolism , patient receive anticoagulation therapy , unstable angina pectoris , cardiac arrhythmia , patient receive enzyme inducing anticonvulsant , patient receive valproic acid , patient receive antiplatelet agent ( aspirin , antiinflammatory drug ) , psychiatric illness/social situation would limit compliance study requirement . Pregnant woman exclude study due potential teratogenic effect . Because unknown potential risk adverse event nurse infant secondary treatment mother agent , breastfeed discontinue mother treat resume 28 day complete therapy . HIVpositive patient combination antiretroviral therapy ineligible potential pharmacokinetic interaction agent . In addition , patient increase risk lethal infection treat marrowsuppressive therapy .</criteria>
