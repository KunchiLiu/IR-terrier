	<brief_summary>Background : The use simulation cadaveric laboratory training highly beneficial faculty advance trainee , usefulness third-year medical student rotate OB-GYN general surgery unknown . Objective : To determine two-day intensive , cost-effective review procedural skill anatomy use simulation laboratory cadaver-based dissection improve performance third-year medical student National Board Medical Examiners ( NBME ) Shelf USMLE Step 2 board examination pre- post-test demonstration . Significance : If prove effective , implementation short , inexpensive , comprehensive course highlight anatomical procedural skill third year medical school could implement . Design Methods : The investigator conduct 1:1 randomization third-year medical student rotate Mayo site ( Jacksonville , Rochester , Scottsdale ) . The student either participate traditional education ( N=20 ) currently take place traditional education plus cadaver-based/simulation-based learning ( N=20 ) . Third-year medical student rotate OB-GYN surgery eligible enroll . Anticipated Outcomes : Knowledge-based examination result well performance outcome improve procedural skill overall satisfaction increase .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The primary goal final two year medical school provide experience develop fundamental clinical skill necessary succeed resident offer opportunities medical student explore career interest . Largely unchanged many year , final two year medical school include series require third year clerkship include obstetrics gynecology ( OB-GYN ) general surgery . Following completion third year , many student may already decide specialty , thus use final year electives rotation hone skill prepare residency . For student plan procedural-based career OB-GYN surgery , considerable amount time may spend learn advanced surgical technique , knot-tying , suture , procedure . In addition traditional learning didactic experience , text , 'hands-on ' patient interaction , program develop supplemental curriculum use simulator cadaveric dissection . While study demonstrate method enhance student ' readiness procedural-based residency , study focus surgical resident select fourth-year medical student specific interest surgery . No study focus comprehensive , streamline approach use supplemental technique third-year medical student . A standardized curriculum use simulation cadaveric laboratory third year may provide student necessary skill succeed require OB-GYN surgical clerkship , hopefully improve examination score overall experience . The investigator intend utilize 'hands-on ' series laboratory experience use simulation center cadaver enhance traditional learning structure . The investigator believe two-day course design would provide necessary information experience without use excessive resource . Typically , work use cadaver relegate study gross human anatomy first year medical school . Students experience in-depth review human anatomy , learn basic skill dissection . After completion introductory course , medical school routinely use cadaver simulation laboratory , despite well-documented benefit advance learner . The usefulness experience well demonstrate pilot study perform Morgan et al , provide intensive 78-hour ( 4-week ) multifaceted curriculum design fourth year medical student prior enter OB-GYN residency . The course include didactic lecture , simulation training , cadaver dissection , knot suture experience , surgical procedure perform cadaver simulation equipment . The author conclude despite time-consuming expensive , student significantly enhance surgical skill readiness begin residency . Similar result also demonstrate course focus suture , knot-tying , procedure-based technique select fourth year student enter surgical residency program ; intent course enhance necessary skill achieve appropriate require milestone . While elective rotation pilot program successful achieve primary outcome , drawback perform fourth year student , relegate select enter surgical field , costly time-consuming . Accordingly , primary goal utilize comprehensive , streamline , cost-effective approach use simulation cadaver experience eligible third-year medical student . The investigator believe experience enhance score Shelf USMLE examination improve procedural skill overall satisfaction remain inexpensive efficient . To achieve goal , course offer student complete OB-GYN general surgery rotation , heavily procedure-based require similar skill set . This combined effort also allow course perform six time per year instead 12 time per year , low cost lessen faculty workload . If study prove successful , hope curriculum could implement medical school . The study design also unique investigator recruit large student population national medical school instead student serve control single-center experience . The student study randomize one two group : traditional learning experience traditional learning experience also include supplemental cadaver-based simulation-based learning . The primary focus study determine whether use comprehensive , combine , simplify approach use cadaver simulation laboratory train third-year medical student beneficial effect student performance OB-GYN surgical clerkship . Aim 1 : To determine combine use 'hands-on ' cadaver simulation laboratory course improve performance , NBME Shelf USMLE Step 2 examination score , overall experience third year OB-GYN surgical clerkship . Aim 2 : To assess whether experience accomplish efficient , cost-effective manner would make generalizable medical school curriculum .</detailed_description>
