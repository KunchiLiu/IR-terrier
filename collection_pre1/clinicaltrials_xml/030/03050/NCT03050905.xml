	<brief_summary>HCV infection one prevalent etiologies liver cirrhosis hepatocellular carcinoma . HCV highly heterogeneous , seven confirm major genotype . Each genotype display different geographic distribution . Since different HCV genotype react differently available antiviral therapy , correct identification HCV genotype serve marker responsiveness indicator duration treatment . The recombinant HCV genotype 2k/1b first describe Saint Petersburg 2002 . A sequence strategy lead detection HCV genotype 2k/1b . However , clinical laboratory often use VERSANT HCV Genotype 2.0 Assay routine HCV genotyping . This assay may potentially misclassify HCV strain genotype 2a/2c . Based finding , number patient 2k/1b may underestimate . AbbVie 's IFN-free regimen treatment chronic HCV genotype 1b infection include 3 DAAs distinct mechanism action non-overlapping resistance pattern target HCV proteins essential viral replication . The high efficacy 3D regimen proven registration clinical trial RW 1b population . 3D regimen evaluate patient HCV genotype 2K/1B . Primary Objective • Evaluate efficacy ombitasvir/paritaprevir/ritonavir dasabuvir ( 3D ) interferon-free treatment regimen assess SVR adult patient HCV 2k/1b . Study Design : .The study include 1 group . Patients HCV GT 2k1b treat accord label recommendation GT1b ( without cirrhosis ) 12 week . All subject receive Ombitasvir/Paritaprevir/Ritonavir Dasabuvir . Subjects assess antiviral response , clinical outcome , patient report adverse event presence emergence resistance associate variant . Subjects follow 12 week treatment extra 24 week follow . Scheduled visit include : physician assessment blood test include HCV resistance mutation .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Study Procedures : Initial screen period : HCV GT2K/1B -infected subject meet eligibility criterion , provide write informed consent , perform baseline RAS test enrol study . Baseline period : On day 0 , patient assess general physical examination , blood urine test include HCV resistance mutation ( elaborated budget file ) , Fibroscan SHEAR WAVE Elastography abdominal ultrasound . After initial assessment include allocated treatment . Study configuration : The study include 1 group patient infect GT 2k1b . Patients treat accord label recommendation GT1b ( without cirrhosis ) 12 week . All subject receive Ombitasvir/Paritaprevir/Ritonavir Dasabuvir . Scheduled visit take place 0 , 4 , 12 24 week patient . All visit include : physician assessment blood test elaborate Study Flowchart . Subjects assess antiviral response , clinical outcome , patient report adverse event presence emergence resistance associate variant .</detailed_description>
