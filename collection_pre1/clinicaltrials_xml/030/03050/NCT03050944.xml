	<detailed_description>Infertility affect one every six couple one ten couple may seek fertility treatment ovulation induction assist reproductive technology . There multiple cause infertility , include ovulatory disorder , endometriosis sperm factor , even psychological problem , among others . Modifiable lifestyle factor , diet , smoke physical activity , may also affect fertility . With respect diet , several dietary factor , i.e . micro- , macro-nutrients individual food group , associate risk subfertility ; however , information need role dietary factor reproductive function . A comprehensive approach investigate association dietary factor health outcome assess impact overall diet rather separate food nutrient . However , evidence concern association dietary pattern , Mediterranean diet ( MD ) pattern , fertility scarce . The benefit MD health well-publicized ; associate significant reduction overall mortality , cardiovascular disease cancer . Adherence MD also seem reduce risk weight gain diabetes , condition raise insulin resistance may thus lead ovulatory infertility . Recently , adherence MD also associate increase circulate adiponectin level , hormone produce adipose tissue act reduce insulin resistance . Interestingly , adiponectin show exert action female reproductive system , include hypothalamic-pituitary ovarian axis endometrium , thus , hypothesize MD may exert beneficial effect reproductive function raise effect adiponectin level . The aim study investigate relationship preconception dietary pattern , especially MD pattern , vitro fertilization ( IVF ) outcomes , well adiponectin follistatin concentration plasma follicular fluid woman undergo IVF treatment . Two-hundred subfertile couple undergo IVF treatment Fertility Clinic Athens ( www.embryogenesis.gr/ ) invite participate . Participants fill follow questionnaire : general questionnaire record baseline characteristic subject ( age , educational level , annual income , medical history , body mass index , smoking , etc ) , semi-quantitative 77-item food frequency questionnaire ass habitual dietary intake , 40-item state-trait anxiety inventory instrument measure anxiety symptom . Dietary pattern evaluate use principal component analysis factor analysis . Adherence MD assess MD-score incorporates inherent characteristic traditional diet , , high intake plant food olive oil , low intake meat dairy product , moderate intake alcohol . Blood follicular fluid adiponectin follistatin concentration measure day ovarian stimulation protocol . Main IVF treatment outcome fertilization rate , embryo quality , implantation , clinical pregnancy live birth . Associations dietary pattern , adiponectin follistatin concentration IVF treatment outcomes test use linear logistic regression analysis , adjust potential confounders ( e.g . age , smoking , anxiety symptom , etc ) . The finding study could contribute development guideline prevent infertility nutritional management associate infertility treatment improve reproductive performance . Furthermore , elucidation role adiponectin follistatin female reproductive function association dietary variable IVF outcome could lead use adiponectin follistatin therapeutic target novel treatment strategy infertility disorder .</detailed_description>
