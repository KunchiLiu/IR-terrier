	<brief_summary>The purpose study demonstrate non-inferior efficacy TAK-438 versus lansoprazole treatment participant gastric ulcer .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Comparison TAK-438 ( Vonoprazan ) Lansoprazole Treatment Gastric Ulcer Participants With Without Helicobacter Pylori Infection</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The drug test study call TAK-438 . TAK-438 test treat people stomach ulcer also may may Helicobacter pylorus ( HP ) infection . This study look stomach ulcer heal also elimination HP people take TAK-438 versus lansoprazole . The study enroll approximately 830 patient . Participants randomly assign ( chance , like flip coin ) one two treatment groups—which remain undisclosed participant study doctor study ( unless urgent medical need ) : - TAK-438 20 mg - Lansoprazole 30 mg Study treatment depend upon Helicobacter pylorus infection status participant , include bismuth-containing quadruple therapy first 2 week H pylorus infect ( HP+ ) participant . HP+ participant ask take TAK- 438 tablet lansoprazole capsule twice daily conjunction bismuth-containing quadruple therapy 2 week , follow TAK-438 tablet lansoprazole capsule daily 6 week . HP- participant ask take TAK-438 tablet lansoprazole capsule daily 8 week . This multi-center trial conduct China , Korea , Taiwan Philippines . The overall time participate study 16 week . Participants make multiple visit plus final visit 2 week 4 week last dose study drug follow-up assessment .</detailed_description>
