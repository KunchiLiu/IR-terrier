	<brief_summary>A multi-protein test use mass spectrometry ( MS ) multiplexed protein quantitation develop . This test accompany decision-aid software provide Transient Ischemic Attack ( TIA ) result rapidly fraction price neuroimaging . With guidance provide test , Emergency Department ( ED ) physicians manage medical imaging question use Computed Tomography Angiography ( CTA ) prior ED discharge appropriate ( timely ) referral stroke clinic consultation follow-up care . The right patient receive right treatment , reduce unwarranted imaging risk cost , reduce burden stroke .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>SpecTRA ; An Observational Study Verification Protein Biomarkers Transient Ischemic Attack .</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This study represent initial Verification study , Mass Spectrometry use quantify large number blood proteins previously implicate ACVS mimic condition patient consent enrolled Emergency Department within 24 hrs symptom onset . 560 patient enrol , group two cohort ( Cohort 1A : 220 ; Cohort 1B : 350 ) . In Cohort 1A , consent participant provide three blood sample : arrival , 4-6 hour later , ~24 hour , later 32 hour symptom onset . In cohort 1b , patient provide single blood sample 24 hour symptom onset . A positive diffusion-weighted imaging ( DWI ) signal Magnetic Resonance Imaging ( MRI ) definite ischemia Computed tomography ( CT ) vascular occlusion CTA use proof ischemia classify clinical phenotype three group ( see ) . A neurologist adjudicate case accord study define adjudication protocol .</detailed_description>
