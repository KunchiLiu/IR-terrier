	<brief_summary>The present study plan provide clinical data impact acute critically ill patient Internal Medicine Unit activity economic data enable quantify relative cost acute patient management ordinary hospitalization . In critically ill complex patient vital parameter continuous monitoring could help improve quality care . Therefore , study check wireless continuous monitor acute select patient able reduce major complication improve patient 's outcome quality care reduce cost compare traditional monitoring perform regular interval nurse staff .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Role Wireless Monitoring Internal Medicine Unit Ongoing Assessment Acute Instable Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>In recent year , Internal Medicine Ward , due epidemiological transition , take charge heterogeneous group patient serious disease acute chronic elderly , frail , poly-pathological patient , require intensive care . Hospitalization medical patient large ward without prior stratification severity , complexity , level dependence , comorbidities without proper assessment risk rapid clinical deterioration , lead suboptimal treatment , result prolonged hospital stay increase care cost . Continuous monitoring vital parameter may allow early detection deterioration acute patient admit intensive care hospitalize Internal Medicine Unit , allow staff immediately address patient 's need achieve promptly appropriate care . As study compare use wireless monitoring system traditional vital sign monitor critical acute patient , study design highlight benefit continuous monitor vital sign first 72 hour hospitalization reduce major complication improve outcome . The study also aim assess reduction hospitalization cost use proxy decrease average length stay .</detailed_description>
