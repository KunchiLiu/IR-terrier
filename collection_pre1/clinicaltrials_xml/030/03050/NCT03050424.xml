	<brief_title>Iron Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease ( COPD ) Exercise Trial</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Iron deficiency ( ID ) one common nutritional deficiency affect human . Chronic disease , include COPD , commonly complicate iron deficiency anaemia ( IDA ) . It well document association ID anaemia reduce exercise capacity . It postulate address ID may novel approach improve exercise capacity quality life . The ECLIPSE cohort find prevalence anaemia patient COPD 19 % associate functional limitation poor outcome ; similarly Nickol et al ( 2015 ) find ID prevalent 17.7 % patient COPD . Barberan-Garcia et al ( 2015 ) evaluate relationship Non-anaemic iron deficiency ( NAID ) aerobic capacity seventy COPD patient 8 week high intensity endurance exercise training programme . Endurance time assess endurance time constant work rate exercise test 80 % oxygen consumption ( VO2 ) peak . At baseline note NAID group comparison normal iron status group lower exercise tolerance approximately 90 second , close normally report minimal clinical important difference ( MCID 's ) test , P=0.007 . After adjust confound variable multiple regression analysis show training induced increase aerobic exercise capacity find normal iron status group , effect training exercise tolerance low NAID ( P=0.041 ) . Exercise capacity COPD strongly link outcome measure mortality . The benefit correcting NAID COPD subject would achieve increase exercise endurance thus improvement Quality Life ( QoL ) . Currently standard treatment NAID COPD , pilot , randomise , double-blind , placebo-controlled trial attempt answer question .</detailed_description>
