	<detailed_description>DMF Medical develop next-generation CO2 filter order address safety issue current chemical CO2 absorber anesthesia . memsorb us patent advanced medical membrane technology filter CO2 anesthetic circuit rather absorb via chemical reaction . This game change technology relies polymeric membrane core ( similar one use oxygenators cardiac surgery ) selectively allow CO2 leave rebreathing system , maintain anesthetic vapor circuit . memsorb cartridge similar size shape current solution simply clicks place .</detailed_description>
