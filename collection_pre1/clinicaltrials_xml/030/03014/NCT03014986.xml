	<detailed_description>Introduction : According previous EBMT study , approximately 6 % HSCT recipients HCV-positive ( Locasciulli et al . Transplantation 1999 ) . Despite fact HSCT recipients chronic HCV infection prone HCV-morbidity ( end stage liver disease , hepatocellular carcinoma , need liver transplant ) , half ( 44 % 61 % ) long term survivor HSCT offer specific treatment ( Ljungman et al . BMT 2012 ; Peffault de Latour et al . BMT 2005 ) . The median time HSCT treatment long efficacy far satisfactory ( approximately 50 % ) ( Ljungman et al . BMT 2012 ) . Since 2011 novel oral directly act antiviral agent ( DAA ) develop market . DAAs offer advantage high efficacy , short duration reduce treatment toxicity ; together possibility exclusively oral , interferon- interferon/ribavirin-free regimen . Short description study : The availability novel therapy DAAs might prompt clinician care HSCT recipient HCV infection prescribe treatment frequently possibly earlier HSCT . Since numerous possible therapeutic combination exist , choice appropriate one straightforward . It depend efficacy , toxicity rate pharmacological interaction , also availability ( healthcare system expand access program ) , cost . This observational prospective study focus treatment strategy HSCT recipient HCV infection . The main focus therapeutic approach , combination drug choose , length treatment outcome . The main reason treat treat HSCT recipient HCV infection also explore . Compared previous cohort , study might provide additional data area non-invasive assessment fibrosis , HCV-RNA level genotyping . In order get much data possible HCV treatment , patient chronic HCV infection transplant last 10 year include . Finally prevalence HCV-RNA positive patient among transplanted year 2016 report . Research design : Over period 24 month , HCV-RNA positive patient receive autologous allogeneic transplant time May 2017 follow transplant centre enrol . Data regard patient receive ( recently receive ) HCV treatment ( group 1 ) collect Form 1 ( FORM 1 - HCV TREATMENT ) 6 month end treatment Form 4 ( FORM 4 - POST HCV TREATMENT FOLLOW UP FORM ) Data regard baseline characteristic HCV-RNA positive patient treat ( group 2 ) collect Form 2 ( FORM 2 - HCV-RNA positive patient - BASELINE ) end recruitment period ( December 2017 +/- 3 month ) Form 3 ( FORM 3 - HCV-RNA positive patient - FOLLOW UP FORM ) . If patient group 2 start treatment , data thereafter report Form 1 Form 4 . Including : Duration study Recruitment period ( visits date HCV-RNA+ patient ) start December 2015 till November 2017 . All patient follow minimum additional period 6 month end recruitment period . Patients , HCV treatment start December 2015 , also include follow study period aim establish efficacy recent HCV-treatment ( HCV-RNA test establish SVR 12 24 week EOT ) . Study Population : All HCV-RNA positive patient transplant anytime May 2017 , follow December 2015 November 2017 . Data Collection &amp; Statistical Analysis Plan : All data collection perform IDWP Data Office ( Leiden ) accord EBMT guideline . Data Med A + Med B following : At first visit occur January 2016 December 2017 : - Date diagnosis HCV - Quantitative HCV-RNA - Genotype HCV , IL28B polymorphism case G1 G4 - Fibrosis accord elastography and/or biopsy ( grade date ) and/or serological assay - Previous anti-HCV treatment ( date , type , duration , side-effects , outcome ) - HBV status ( chronic active infection , chronic inactive infection , resolve infection , immunise ) HIV status - Clinical data : ALT , albumin , PT , serum creatinine , encephalopathy , ascites , white cell count , Hb , platelet , dialysis , hepatocellular carcinoma ( HCC ) - Concomitant pharmacological treatment - Occurrence VOD ( grade , date ) - Acute chronic GVHD ( grade , date ) At end study treat HCV-RNA- positive patient ( December 2017 , +/- 3 month ) : - Quantitative HCV RNA ( date ) - Fibrosis accord elastography and/or biopsy ( grade date ) and/or serological assay - Chronic GvHD ( grade , date ) - Clinical data : ALT , albumin , PT , serum creatinine , encephalopathy , ascites , white cell count , Hb , platelet , dialysis - Presence hepatocellular carcinoma ( HCC ) - Reason treatment reason start HCV-treatment - Reason death , applicable In case treatment : - Treatment regimen ( drug , length ) - On treatment response ( HCV-RNA level date ) - Concomitant pharmacological treatment - SVR 12 24 week end treatment - Reason discontinuation ( EOT , side tolerability , etc . ) - Treatment associated side effect ( type , grade , treatment , date onset date resolution ) , include pharmacological interaction - Treatment payment ( national healthcare system , expand access , research protocol , etc . ) Statistical analysis Main outcome variable : 1 . Description treatment approach HCV infection The type treatment ( drug , dos ) HCV describe . The following variable describe patient without treatment HCV : age , type transplant , type underlying disease , status underlying disease , presence relapse , time HSCT ( Med A form ) ; HCV-RNA level , grade fibrosis , genotype , previous acute chronic GVHD ( grade max . ) , Child-Pugh score ( calculated clinical variable ) , presence HCC . 2 . SVR week 12 24 EOT , yes/no The following variable describe patient without sustained viral response ( SVR ) week 12 24 EOT : age , type transplant , type underlying disease , status underlying disease , presence relapse , time HSCT ( Med A form ) ; HCV-RNA level , grade fibrosis , genotype polymorphism applicable , previous acute chronic GVHD ( grade max . ) , Child- Pugh score ( calculated clinical variable ) , presence HCC , type treatment ( particular regimen , interferon-free vs. interferon-based regimen , etc ) , toxicity , treatment response , presence possible interacting drug . Categorical variable compare accord chi-square test exact Fisher 's test applicable , continuous variable compare Mann-Whitney test .</detailed_description>
