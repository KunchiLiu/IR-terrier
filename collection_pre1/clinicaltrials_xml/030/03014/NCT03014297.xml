	<brief_summary>This single center , open label , phase I study involve grade I-III gastroenteropancreatic neuroendocrine tumor , consist dose escalation Part A follow expansion cohort Part B . On Part A Patients treated daily oral everolimus . Fosbretabulin administer IV either q3 weekly q weekly base PO CRM cohort . Part B : Once investigator establish MTD Part A , investigator treat 15 patient dose combination . The primary secondary objective expansion cohort similar Part A study , i.e. , establish safety profile experimental drug combination collect ass efficacy data . Patients treat concurrent everolimus fosbretabulin 12 week .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Fosbretabulin With Everolimus Neuroendocrine Tumors With Progression</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>A variety treatment option available NETs carcinoid syndrome include surgical medical therapy . Most subject require somatostatin analog control symptoms carcinoid syndrome . Subjects longer respond somatostatin liver-directed therapy , experience progression disease increase symptom limit option , include participation clinical trial . Recently everolimus sunitinib approve treatment subject progressive locally advanced metastatic neuroendocrine tumor . Based preclinical data model NETs clinical activity see NETS tumor type exist tumor vascculature , study examine effectiveness fosbretabulin give combination everolimus subject GI-NETs PNETs.The vasoconstrictive effect fosbretabulin potent , though short-lived ( 4-8 hour ) , cumulative adverse effect . Everolimus inhibit angiogenesis , slow tumor growth prolong half-life ( 30 hour ) . Combining two agent distinctly different mechanism action may improve tumor control without additional toxicity , potential reduce drug resistance .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Patients must histologically confirm neuroendocrine tumor ( grade 13 ) metastatic unresectable , standard curative palliative measure exist longer effective . Prior treatment fosbretabulin allow , give combination everolimus . Prior treatment everolimus allow , patient able tolerate 10 mg daily everolimus acceptable side effect , everolimus give combination fosbretabulin . A 1 week washout period require patient previously everolimus . Age ≥18 year . ECOG performance status ≤2 . Life expectancy great 6 month . Progressive disease base radiological imaging within 12 month . RECIST 1.1 would use assess measurable disease burden . Patients must normal organ marrow function define : absolute neutrophil count ≥1,000/mcL platelets ≥75,000/mcL total bilirubin ≤2.5 × institutional upper limit normal AST ( SGOT ) /ALT ( SGPT ) ≤2.5 × institutional upper limit normal creatinine within normal institutional limit OR creatinine clearance ≥60 mL/min/1.73 m2 patient creatinine level institutional normal Women childbearing potential men must agree use adequate contraception ( hormonal barrier method birth control ; abstinence ) prior study entry duration study participation . Should woman become pregnant suspect pregnant partner participate study , inform treat physician immediately . Men treat enrol protocol must also agree use adequate contraception prior study , duration study participation , 4 month completion fosbretabulin everolimus administration . Ability understand willingness sign write informed consent document . Patients prior everolimus able tolerate 10 mg daily dose . Prior chemotherapy radiotherapy within 4 week ( 6 week nitrosoureas mitomycin C ) prior enter study recover adverse event due agent administer 4 week earlier . Child Pugh Class B great hepatic dysfunction . Patients receive investigational agent . Patients know brain metastasis poor prognosis likelihood develop progressive neurologic dysfunction would confound evaluation neurologic adverse event . History allergic reaction attribute compound similar chemical biologic composition fosbretabulin Uncontrolled hypertension ( HTN ) ; sustain blood pressure ( BP ) great 150/100 mmHg Must unstable angina myocardial infarction within 4 month prior enrollment treatment , NYHA Class III IV heart failure , uncontrolled angina , history severe coronary artery disease , severe uncontrolled ventricular arrhythmia , sick sinus syndrome , electrocardiographic evidence acute ischemia Grade 3 conduction system abnormalities unless subject pacemaker . Must evidence clinically active cancer history prior malignancy within past 3 year exception : ) adequately treat basal cell carcinoma , squamous cell skin cancer , thyroid cancer ; b ) carcinoma situ cervix breast ; c ) prostate cancer Gleason Grade 6 less stable prostatespecific antigen level ; ) cancer consider cure surgical resection unlikely impact survival duration study , localize transitional cell carcinoma bladder benign tumor adrenal gland pancreas . Patients receive medication substance strong inhibitor inducer CYP3A4 ineligible . Because list agent constantly change , important regularly consult frequentlyupdated list http : //medicine.iupui.edu/clinpharm/ddis/table.aspx ; medical reference text Physicians ' Desk Reference may also provide information . As part enrollment/informed consent procedure , patient counsel risk interaction agent , new medication need prescribe patient consider new overthecounter medicine herbal product . HIVpositive patient combination antiretroviral therapy ineligible potential pharmacokinetic interaction everolimus fosbretabulin . In addition , patient increase risk lethal infection treat marrowsuppressive therapy . Appropriate study initiate patient receive combination antiretroviral therapy indicate . History prior cerebrovascular event , ( include transient ischemic attack ) within 6 month start screen . Current thrombotic hemorrhagic disorder/event history prior event within 6 month start Screening Corrected QT interval ( [ QTc ] Fridericia ) &gt; 480 m Significant vascular disease recent peripheral arterial thrombosis</criteria>
