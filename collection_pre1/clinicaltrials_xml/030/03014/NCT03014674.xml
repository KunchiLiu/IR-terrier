	<brief_summary>Mepolizumab ( SB-240563 ) humanize monoclonal antibody ( Immunoglobulin G1 , kappa , mAb ) block human interleukin-5 ( hIL-5 ) bind interleukin ( IL ) -5 receptor complex express eosinophil cell surface thus inhibit signal . This study compare pharmacokinetics safety mepolizumab administer liquid drug product two different device reconstitute lyophilized drug product healthy subject . Subjects receive single administration 100 milligram ( mg ) mepolizumab single injection . The randomization stratify body weight ( &lt; 70 kilogram ( kg ) , 70 &lt; 80 kg &gt; =80 kg ) site injection randomize 1:1:1 upper arm , abdomen thigh . Approximately 243 healthy subject randomize least 9 subject randomize mepolizumab treatment within weight stratum 3 subject within mepolizumab treatment , weight stratum injection site . Each subject participate study approximately 16 week ( 85 day drug administration ) , screen visit , single dose treatment period , follow-up visit .</brief_summary>
