	<detailed_description>This study investigate effectiveness device high school athlete play non-helmeted sport soccer . Athletes participate study randomly assign one two group : 1 ) Device wear season 2 ) Non-device wear season . This study focus use effectiveness device solely females , male football hockey player previously investigate . All participant outfit adhesive patch-like accelerometer ( place behind ear ( Xpatch-X2 Biosystems http : //www.x2biosystems.com/x2_x_patch/ ) measure magnitude every impact head sustain athlete . Effectiveness device determine via difference longitudinal brain image functional test follow competitive soccer participation . A subset athlete report diagnose concussion also receive additional brain neuroanatomical neurophysiological testing within week follow diagnosed concussive event . At time point participant also undergo various neurocognitive assessment</detailed_description>
