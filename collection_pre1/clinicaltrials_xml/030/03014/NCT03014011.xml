	<detailed_description>Hypoglycaemia subject suffer type 2 diabetes may substantial consequence include significant negative impact quality life . Further , repeat minor hypoglycaemia may result significant productivity loss . In healthy subject number study show hypoglycaemic episode plasma level 2.2 - 2.5 mmol/L ( 40-45 mg/dl ) brain area responsible cognition alter neuronal function measure cerebral blood flow . This accompany severely impaired cognitive function reduce ability solve simple cognitive task . At high level glucose ( 3 mmol/L ( 54 mg/dl ) ) , remain settled whether cognitive function also affect negatively whether may accompany change brain metabolism . Apart raise blood glucose directly indirectly via glucagon , treatment hypoglycaemia exist , since Glucagon-like peptide-1 ( GLP-1 ) base therapy use type 2 diabetes may affect brain glucose consumption , therapeutic intervention prevent negative result hypoglycaemia may eventually become clinically possible . Here , investigator propose provide quantitative result cognition acute mild hypoglycaemic episode ( target plasma glucose 3 mmol/L ) . Data provide executive function , attention memory .</detailed_description>

This exclusion criterion also pertain subject take antihypertensive . Visual impairment auditory impairment . Known abnormality central nervous system endocrinological ( exception diabetes mellitus euthyroid goiter ) , haematological , neurological , psychiatric disease major disorder opinion investigator precludes compliance protocol , evaluation result represent unacceptable risk participant 's safety . Proliferative retinopathy ( funducscopy perform within 3 month screen acceptable ) and/or severe neuropathy . Current treatment systemic drug , may interfere glucose metabolism . Significant history alcoholism drug/chemical abuse per investigator 's judgement . Current tobacco user ( smoke nicotinic product use 3 month prior screen ) . Severe hypoglycaemic event past 6 month . Known hypoglycaemia unawareness . Participants mental incapacity language barrier preclude adequate understanding cooperation , opinion investigator general practitioner , participate trial . For female : Pregnancy , breastfeed status intention become pregnant trial . Any chronic disorder severe disease opinion investigator might endanger participant 's safety compliance protocol .</criteria>
