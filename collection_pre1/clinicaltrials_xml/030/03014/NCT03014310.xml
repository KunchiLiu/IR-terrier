	<detailed_description>This Phase I cohort-randomized , double-blind , controlled trial design assess safety , reactogenicity , immunogenicity monovalent inactivate influenza A/H5N8 virus vaccine manufacture bioCSL administer different dosage ( 3.75 15 mcg HA per dose ) give without AS03 MF59 adjuvant manufacture GlaxoSmithKline Biologicals ( GSK ) Novartis Vaccines Diagnostics ( NVD ) , respectively . This study conduct 6 VTEU site enroll 150 ( 380 ) male non-pregnant female , 19 64 year old , inclusive good health meet eligibility criterion . The entire study duration approximately 24 month subject participation duration approximately 13 month . Subjects enrol one two cohort , within cohort subject randomize 2:2:1 ratio . Subjects Cohort 1 randomly assign 1 3 treatment arm receive two dos A/H5N8 vaccine vary antigen dosage ( 3.75 15 mcg HA ) AS03 ( 30-76 subject per treatment arm ) , comparator arm receive two dos A/H5N8 vaccine ( 15 mcg HA ) without adjuvant ( 15-38 subject ) . Subjects Cohort 2 randomly assign 1 3 treatment arm receive two dos A/H5N8 vaccine vary antigen dosage ( 3.75 15 mcg HA ) MF59 ( 30-76 subject per treatment arm ) , comparator arm receive two dos A/H5N8 vaccine ( 15 mcg HA ) without adjuvant ( 15-38 subject ) . All subject receive dosage vaccine without adjuvant first second study vaccination , exception subject Cohort 1 receive Vaccination 2 prior February 28 , 2017 receive second unadjuvanted vaccination antigen dosage randomize assignment . All dos administer intramuscularly approximately 21 day apart . Primary objective : 1 ) To assess safety reactogenicity monovalent inactivate influenza A/H5N8 virus vaccine follow receipt two dos administer intramuscularly different dosage ( 3.75 15 mcg HA per dose ) give without AS03 MF59 adjuvant approximately 21 day apart . 2 ) To assess serum HAI Neut antibody responses monovalent inactivate influenza A/H5N8 virus vaccine follow receipt two dos administer intramuscularly different dosage ( 3.75 15 mcg HA per dose ) give without AS03 MF59 adjuvant approximately 21 day apart . Secondary objective : 1 ) To assess study vaccine-related unsolicited non-serious AEs follow receipt two dos monovalent inactivated influenza A/H5N8 virus vaccine administer intramuscularly different dosage ( 3.75 15 mcg HA per dose ) give without AS03 MF59 adjuvant approximately 21 day apart . 2 ) To assess medically-attended adverse event ( MAAEs ) , include new-onset chronic medical condition ( NOCMCs ) , potentially immune-mediated medical condition ( PIMMCs ) follow receipt two dos monovalent inactivated influenza A/H5N8 virus vaccine administer intramuscularly different dosage ( 3.75 15 mcg HA per dose ) give without AS03 MF59 adjuvant approximately 21 day apart . 3 ) To assess serum HAI Neut antibody responses monovalent inactivate influenza A/H5N8 virus vaccine follow receipt one dose administer intramuscularly different dosage ( 3.75 15 mcg HA per dose ) give without AS03 MF59 adjuvant .</detailed_description>
