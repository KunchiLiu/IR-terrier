	<brief_title>Ultrasonically Activated Scalpel Versus Electrocautery Based Dissection Acute Cholecystitis Trial</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Electrocautery traditionally method choice tissue dissection laparoscopic cholecystectomy . As alternative electrocautery , ultrasonically activate scalpel proven effective safe instrument facilitation dissection minimize blood loss open laparoscopic surgery . Whereas electrocautery coagulate burn temperature high 150ÂºC , ultrasonic scalpel transforms electric power mechanical longitudinal vibration work part instrument piezoelectrical transducer . Accordingly , former technique limit heating- thermal necrosis effect tissue area adjacent cut line . Since relative-potential benefit ultrasonic scalpel high technically demand surgery , advantage may pronounce routine laparoscopic gallstone surgery , usually do uneventfully whichever equipment use . Laparoscopic cholecystectomy acute cholecystitis , however , demand connect longer operative time , postoperative complication , great risk conversion open cholecystectomy longer postoperative stay . In addition , know operation acute cholecystitis associate high risk severe complication bile duct injury . The potential benefit use ultrasonic scalpel thus even great surgery cholecystitis . In addition numerous important aspect safety implementation emergency cholecystectomy . Traditionally , surgeon choose operate patient laparoscopic technique , use so-called electrocautery hook , usually allow tissue division minimal blood loss . Further improvement dissection technique follow introduction ultrasonic tissue coagulation . This technique offer option perform operation even less blood loss , gentle handling inflame tissue seal tissue section tissue divide . Accordingly ultrasonic tissue coagulation technique theoretically significant advantage least divide acutely inflamed tissue like acute cholecystitis particular relevance dissection gallbladder liver bed , bleed bile leakage often occur . Moreover surgeon instead chooses dissect gallbladder doom downwards , part contain cystic duct cystic artery ( Calots triangle ) , unique option offer simplify operation also make safer . This latter technique call `` fundus first '' . The present study aim analyze whether ultrasonic tissue coagulation dissection technique combine `` fundus first '' approach offer smooth per postoperative course acute cholecystectomy patient compare traditional way perform operation . Due low risk bleed good anatomical overview , technique may also reduce risk convert procedure laparoscopic cholecystectomy open cholecystectomy . The study perform double-blinded study patient undergo laparoscopic surgery acute cholecystitis . Patients include study randomize surgery either traditional electrocautery base technique ultrasonic scalpel base dissection `` fundus first '' approach . The choice dissection approach determine randomization procedure , whether do triangle Callot + electrocautery upwards gallbladder fundus downwards use ultrasonic scalpel . Peroperative cholangiography do routinely . The cystic duct close clip , ultrasonic scalpel . One month surgery patient contact telephone . In case questionnaire return yet , patient remind . At phone call exact number day sick leave postoperatively adverse event occur discharge record .</detailed_description>
