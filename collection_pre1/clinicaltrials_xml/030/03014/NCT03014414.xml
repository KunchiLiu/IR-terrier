	<detailed_description>This randomized trial test efficacy cost-effectiveness novel module administer prior weight loss explicitly design enhance enjoyment healthy lifestyle behavior independent longer-term health effect , thus escalate proportion individual sustain ≥7 % weight loss long-term . Overweight/obese individual elevate blood pressure randomize one two 12-month weight-management intervention ( Fun First Weight Watchers ) follow 36 month . For Aim 1 ( Primary outcome ) , test whether Fun First efficacious Weight Watchers use mediator-intervention interaction model sufficient priori statistical power interaction effect well intervention mediator main effect . The posited mediator assess participant ' change enjoyment four key healthy lifestyle behavior ( heathy eating , physical activity , weigh self-nurturing ) via online survey 0-2 month . The primary outcome proportion participant lose clinically significant amount initial body weight maintain trial ( i.e. , lose &gt; =7 % initial body weight 0-12 month gain &lt; =5 lb 12-36 month ) , assess clinic scale in-person visit research clinic . Secondary outcome include proportion individual sustain ≥7 % weight loss trial assess digital cellular scale participant ' home participant ' change systolic blood pressure trial assess research clinic . For Aim 2 ( Other pre-specified outcome ) , test whether Fun First cost effective Weight Watchers use individual-level trial data system science model long-term , population-level hypertension cardiovascular disease incidence , health care disability cost , quality-adjusted life-years life course .</detailed_description>
