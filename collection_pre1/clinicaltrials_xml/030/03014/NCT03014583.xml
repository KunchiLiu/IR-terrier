	<brief_summary>Chronic Back and/or Leg Pain ( CBLP ) spinal surgical procedure , condition commonly label Failed Back Surgery Syndrome ( FBSS ) , affect 15 % 40 % patient spine surgery . Treatment chronic condition operation medical management heavy financial impact health care system . Many study demonstrate efficacy economic value Spinal Cord Stimulation ( SCS ) chronic neuropathic pain , randomize control trial ( RCTs ) show SCS clinically effective adjunct medical management . SCS advantage reversible less invasive surgery may cause few issue time long-term pharmacological treatment . Despite variable level success literature , approximately 30-55 % patient treat traditional SCS neuropathic pain disorder receive adequate long term pain relief . Therefore , technical SCS system refinement , well new technique emerge . Two new stimulation waveform base traditional SCS technology appear optimize outcome specific painful condition ; - Burst stimulation mode : generates constant-current stimulus 5 spike 500 Hz per burst pulse width interspike interval 1 ms. - High-frequency stimulation ( 1 10 kHz ) mode . Several study demonstrate potential interest 2 new waveform treat FBSS patient compare traditional SCS . The Precision Spectra™ system allow MultiWave Technology offer broad spectrum waveform option ( Tonic Conventional Stimulation ( TCS ) , BURST stimulation High Frequency stimulation ( HF ) ) . To date , literature data compare 3 stimulation pattern lack suggest pain relief non-responsive patient `` recapture '' increase SCS frequency 500 Hz BURST stimulation beyond HF stimulation . It seem important conduct RCT crossover , thanks new Precision SCS Stimulator , compare effect 3 different SCS modality FBSS patient determine concept effective term pain reduction energy consumption .</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Age ≥ 18 year ≤ 80 year . Subject FBSS require surgery . For purpose study , FBSS define persistent recurrent low back leg pain least 6 month duration follow least one decompression and/or fusion procedure . Subject persistent low back leg pain despite treatment modality ( pharmacological , surgical , physical , psychological therapy ) try prove satisfactory unsuitable contraindicate subject . Average global pain ≥ 50 mm assess baseline VAS . With significant back , mean intensity back pain VAS ≥ 50 mm ( mean daily VAS score calculate 5 consecutive day ) . Meeting criteria spinal cord stimulation test accord HAS guideline ( multidisciplinary consultation , psychological assessment , etc. ) . Subject candidate SCS . Absence active psychosis history serious psychotic illness require hospitalisation . Understands accepts constraint study . Free subject , temporary permanent guardianship subject subordination . Patients cover French national health insurance . Patients give write consent study receive clear information . Age &lt; 18 year &gt; 80 year Subject treat SCS , subcutaneous peripheral nerve stimulation , intrathecal drug delivery system , require back surgery location relate his/her original back pain complaint experimental therapy . Cause low back pain accessible etiological `` mechanical '' surgical treatment ( discogenic low back pain , vertebral instability , spinal deformity , etc. ) . Subject recent back surgery le 6 month ago . Presenting surgical , anaesthetic psychiatric contraindication implantation spinal cord stimulation system . Based opinion principal subinvestigator , subject unable operate SCS equipment . Subject life expectancy le 24 month beyond study enrolment . Absence signature inform consent form . Patients cover French national health insurance . Subjects require close protection , i.e . minor , pregnant woman , nurse mother , subject deprive freedom court administrative decision , subject admit health social welfare establishment , major subject legal protection , finally patient emergency set . Pregnant woman , nurse mother , woman childbearing potential use effective contraception ( hormonal/barrier : oral , parenteral , percutaneous , implantable , intrauterine device , surgical : tubal ligation , hysterectomy , total ovariectomy ) .</criteria>
