	<detailed_description>Glaucoma consist multifactorial disease cause deficiency drainage aqueous humor , may cause increase intraocular pressure ( IOP ) , impairment optic nerve visual field change . According recent data , disease second cause blindness world ( 12.3 % ) . An estimate indicate , 2020 , 79.6 million glaucomatous individual world . The estimated prevalence primary glaucoma Brazilian population 3.4 % , consist 2.4 % open angle 0.7 % close angle . Glaucoma : open angle , angle-closure , congenital secondary . Increased IOP major risk factor glaucoma progression well fluctuation ( difference high low IOP measure ) primary open-angle glaucoma ( POAG ) . In addition , age , family history , central corneal thickness , race , high myopia , hypermetropia , diabetes mellitus , hypertension hypotension , gender , optic disc hemorrhage , suspect optic nerve excavation , cardiovascular cerebrovascular disease . The treatment depend classification glaucoma , since POAG , initial treatment topical monotherapy ( ocular hypotensors ) . However , situation , drug treatment enough stabilize process glaucomatous progression . In case , incisional surgery laser treatment necessary . Trabeculectomy consist intervention increase drainage aqueous humor , order control IOP prevent progression disease . However , due complication , atalamia , hypotonia , development cataract risk endophthalmitis , procedure indicate refractory case clinical and/or laser treatment . Thus , clinical treatment trabeculoplasty treatment choice . Trabeculoplasty indicate case POAG , pseudoexfoliative , pigment case secondary trabecular glaucoma visible gonioscopy . The tonometer device use detect IOP increase . Despite existence several model , Goldmann 's applanation consider gold standard measurement , since evaluates force necessary deform surface cornea . This method quite accurate , however , error may occur result due fluorescein pattern , thick cornea , excessive pressure eyeball hold patient 's eyelid elevate corneal astigmatism without adequate compensatory position planer . The measurement IOP also perform another type tonometer : non-contact , pneumatic blow . It first use 1973 Forbes advantage : 1 ) need use eye drop , 2 ) perform people doctor , 3 ) low risk contamination 4 ) use screen program . However , study Britt et al . show presence lachrymal film dehiscence existence microaerosol air blow , would make method aseptic . According study , pneumatic tonometer compare Goldmann , result obtain : 50 % evaluated eye show difference two device 85 % approximately 2 mmHg . In another study compare IOP value measure mentioned tonometer , verify pneumatic tonometer underestimate IOP value , compare Goldmann , thin cornea ; however , significant difference measurement two tonometer thick cornea . The Water Drinking Test ( WDT ) propaedeutic widely use evaluate maximum intraocular pressure ( IOP ) fluctuation . These data extremely important expect result relation reproducibility exam , since study , show WDT use estimate peak diurnal fluctuation supine IOP simplify daily stress curve ( another method purpose WDT ) patient treatment glaucoma . Glaucoma serious eye health problem , high incidence prevalence worldwide lead cause irreversible blindness world . Therefore , extremely important perform test detect alter IOP value . The IOP value obtain 24 hour period important data , since require control conduct treatment glaucoma . In past , WDT often use diagnose patient pathology . Due series study , find WDT use diagnostic test , tool evaluate change IOP peak . In addition , comparison reproducibility device facilitate good evaluation , speed , safety efficacy treatment , contribute increase quality life patient also guide study area .</detailed_description>
