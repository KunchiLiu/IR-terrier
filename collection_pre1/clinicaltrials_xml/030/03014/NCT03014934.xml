Aim . Assessment 1-year outcome patient undergoing allo-HSCT history pre-existing IA vs. pre-existing IA . Hypothesis . NRM patient pre-existing IA high ( specify margin 10 % ) patient without pre-existing IA . Study population . First allo-HSCT patient acute leukaemia MDS give stem cell graft . Cohort 1 : History probable proven invasive aspergillosis Cohort 2 : No History probable proven invasive aspergillosis : cohort include also patient history possible mycosis document microbiologically .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Impact Pre-existing Invasive Aspergillosis Allogeneic Stem Cell Transplantation</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Background &amp; Rationale . In patient pre-existing invasive aspergillosis allo-HSCT feasible without progression fungal infection . However , influence invasive pulmonary aspergillosis ( IA ) transplant related complication long term survival investigate large patient cohort current condition . Recently IDWP ALWP perform retrospective analysis impact preexist aspergillosis allo-HSCT outcome.2 In summary , trend towards impair outcome allo-HSCT patient prior IA significant impact important allo-HSCT transplant outcome , survival , GVHD relapse . The data suggest history IA generally consider contraindication allo-HSCT . To able precisely investigate impact IA allo-HSCT , non-interventional prospective study need . Primary objective : To determine pre-existing IA influence non-relapse mortality allo-HSCT Secondary objective : - To determine pre-existing IA influence : - relapse free survival - overall survival - incidence severity GVHD - incidence relapse - incidence IA post allo-HSCT subgroup transplant previous IA • progression IA Research design : Prospective study . Study recruitment expect start May 1st , 2016 . It expect recruitment close October 31st 2017 . Follow till one year transplant . Items : Data Med A form , Med C form patient , Aspergillus form patient probable/proven IA . Endpoint ( ) : Primary endpoint : 1-year non-relapse mortality cumulative incidence Secondary endpoint : - 1-year relapse free survival - 1-year overall survival - 1-year incidence severity GVHD - 1-year incidence relapse - status IA ( condition 1 year ) Study population - First allo-HSCT patient AML - First allo-HSCT patient ALL - First allo-HSCT patient MDS Cohort 1 : History probable proven invasive aspergillosis Cohort 2 : No History probable proven invasive aspergillosis Cases : Prior IA = probable/proven IA accord EORTC 2008 criterion ( Cohort 1 ) Controls : No prior proven probable IA = patient = really negative IA possible IA ( Cohort 2 ) Sample size Assuming 20 % incidence non relapse mortality patient without proven probable history IA , total 2100 HSCTs need order test hypothesis incidence non relapse mortality cohort 1 ( HSCTs previous history proven probable IA ) high cohort 2 ( HSCTs without history IA previous history possible IA ) specify margin 10 % . The estimated proportion HSCTs cohort 1 5 % , thus 105 1995 HSCTs need cohort 1 cohort 2 , respectively , consider alpha=0.05 , beta=0.2 . Data Collection &amp; Statistical Analysis Plan : ( List research variable collect list outcome variable analyse , give brief description method analysis ( collaboration EBMT statistician ) All data collection perform IDWP Data Office ( Leiden ) accord EBMT guideline . Primary endpoint : non relapse mortality The non relapse mortality estimate use cumulative incidence method . Death due transplant consider event , whilst relapse underlie disease consider compete event . Patients alive end follow-up censored date . Cohort 1 , vs. Cohort 2 compare Gray test . A cause specific Cox model perform order estimate risk die Cohort 1 respect Cohort 2 . The following variable enter multivariate model possible confounders : age ( continuous variable ) , gender ( M vs. F ) , underlie disease ( ALL vs. AML/MDS ) , status SCT ( 1st CR vs. ≥ 2 CR vs. Prim Refr/noCR ) , time diagnosis SCT ( continuous variable ) , donor type ( sibling vs. UD vs. Haplo ) , source SCT ( BM vs. PB vs. CB ) , donor age , d/r gender match , d/r CMV status , condition regimen ( MAC vs. RIC vs. TBI ) , type immunosuppression ( vivo T depletion y/n , vitro T-depletion y/n ) , DLI post SCT ( y/n ) , centre . Secondary endpoint Relapse free survival overall survival estimate Kaplan-Meier method . Incidence GvHD incidence relapse estimate cumulative incidence method . A cause specific Cox model estimate compare Cohort 1 Cohort 2 ; adjust confounders analyze also primary endpoint . The severity GvHD describe descriptive statistic . Frequencies percentages use categorical variable , whilst median , range , mean standard deviation compute continuous variable . Additional descriptive statistic separately perform cohort 2 . Main characteristic patient also describe .</detailed_description>
