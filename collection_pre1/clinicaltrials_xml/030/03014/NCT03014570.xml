	<brief_title>Testing Implementation EIT-4-BPSD</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Behavioral Psychological Symptoms Dementia ( BPSD ) include aggression , agitation , depression , anxiety , apathy hallucination exhibit 90 % nursing facility resident dementia . BPSD result negative health outcome decline physical functioning high cost care . In addition , BPSD put resident risk inappropriate use antipsychotic drug restrain method reduce function , increase social isolation , increase risk physical abuse . Prior NIH-funded clinical trial show behavioral approach reduce BPSD . These behavioral approach endorse first line treatment BPSD . In fact , Centers Medicare Medicaid Services ( CMS ) National Partnership Improve Dementia Care Reduce Antipsychotic Use Nursing Homes require care resident dementia deliver use person-centered behavioral approach . Despite regulatory requirement , le 2 % nursing home ( also refer facility ) consistently implement approach . Established barrier use behavioral approach include limited knowledge , skill , experience non-pharmacological approach , beliefs superiority psychotropic medication behavioral intervention , lack staff motivation use non-pharmacologic strategy consistently . The propose project respond gap knowledge practice . A novel implementation approach test assure staff nursing home [ i.e. , provide direct care resident ] use non-pharmacologic , behavioral approach management BPSD . To advance CMS National Partnership , comprehensive compendium peer-reviewed/expert-endorsed resource develop utilize person-centered , behavioral approach BPSD ( Nursing Home Toolkit : www.nursinghometoolkit.com ) . The Toolkit resource support theoretically-based 4-step approach find effective prior implementation work . The four step include : 1 . Assessment environment policy ; 2 . Education staff ; 3 . Establishing person-centered care plan ; 4 . Mentoring motivating staff . While Toolkit free accessible , staff nursing home need help implementation . Implementation theoretically base 4-step approach guide Evidence Integration Triangle ( EIT ) framework . The EIT bring together evidence key stakeholder facility influence care practice . EIT include : participatory implementation process , provision practical evidence-based intervention , pragmatic measure progress toward goal . This implementation framework merge 4-step approach Nursing Home Toolkit resource develop intervention , EIT-4-BPSD . The goal demonstrate EIT-4-BPSD implementation strategy enable staff nurse home reduce BPSD use behavioral approach optimize function , prevent adverse event improve quality life resident . A Hybrid III cluster randomize trial do 50 nursing facility randomize EIT-4-BPSD Education Only ( EO ) . The aim : Primary Aim 1 : To implement test implementation EIT-4-BPSD . Facility Level Outcome : Research question : Do facility expose EIT-4-BPSD demonstrate evidence implementation 12 month evaluate Reach , Effectiveness , Adoption , Implementation , Maintenance ( RE-AIM ) criterion ? For evaluation Effectiveness within RE-AIM : Resident Level Outcomes : Hypothesis : Residents EIT-4-BPSD facility experience less BPSD , maintain improve function , reduce use psychotropic medication , experience few adverse event , improve quality life compare resident EO facility . We measure outcomes baseline , 4 12 month post implementation intervention . Facility Level Outcomes : Hypotheses : ( 1 ) EIT-4-BPSD facility demonstrate improvement Environment Policy assessment reflect support behavioral approach BPSD , great percentage resident behavioral approach incorporate care plan 12 month post-implementation compare EO facility ; ( 2 ) We examine Maintenance EIT-4-BPSD facility outcomes 12 month 24 month post-implementation . Primary Aim 2 : Evaluation Feasibility , Utility Cost EIT Approach EIT-4-BPSD Facilities . Using descriptive qualitative data capture intervention focus group 12 month , use EIT strategy participatory implementation process Stakeholder Team facility staff evaluate . In addition description cost implementation use activity-based costing method complete . This study add critical knowledge little known implementation effective intervention nurse facility . It serve implementation model potential widely disseminate . In addition , study demonstrate facility implement person-centered dementia care decrease BPSD , ultimate goal CMS National Partnership .</detailed_description>
