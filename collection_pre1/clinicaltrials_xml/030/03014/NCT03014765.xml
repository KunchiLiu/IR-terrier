	<brief_summary>Study enroll patient schedule hip arthroplasty . In subject flow-mediated dilatation capability ( FMD ) brachial artery measure prior elective surgery , within 24 hour surgery 5-7 day surgery . At session brachial artery diameter measure rest , cuff inflation 50 second cuff deflation . From mentioned value increase diameter artery reactive hyperemia calculate . Simultaneously ultrasound investigation , blood determination endothelial dysfunction marker collect . The participant contact 3 month surgery ask complication may associate surgery .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Endothelial Dysfunction Perioperative Period</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Cardiovascular complication , especially coronary heart disease , one main cause perioperative complication . Indicators pre-clinical atherosclerosis , : endothelial dysfunction , increase arterial intima/media thickness ( especially carotid artery ) , carotid calcification coronary calcification , suggest presence atherosclerotic process without symptomatic presentation . Endothelial dysfunction one earliest measurable change predict development atherosclerotic disease . Surgery significant stress organism : increase release free oxygen radical oxidative stress increase systemic inflammatory response cause thromboembolic complication . In study 50 patient sexes 40-80 year age schedule hip arthroplasty include . In subject flow-mediated dilatation capability ( FMD ) brachial artery measure prior elective surgery , within 24 hour surgery 5-7 day surgery . Measurement brachial artery flow-mediated dilatation capability ( FMD ) : brachial artery diameter measure 5 cm proximal antecubital fossa rest , cuff inflation 50 second cuff deflation . The cuff inflate 4 min . From mentioned value increase diameter artery reactive hyperemia calculate . Simultaneously ultrasound investigation , blood determination inflammatory endothelial dysfunction marker ( CRP , IL-6 , IL-8 , IL-10 , IL-18 , TNFa , VW Factor , Selectin P , selectin E ) collect . The participant contact 3 month surgery ask complication may associate surgery .</detailed_description>
