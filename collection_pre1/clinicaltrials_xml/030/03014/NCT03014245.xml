	<detailed_description>Melatonin , substance produce pineal gland , well know role sleep-wake cycle less well know effective antioxidant . It able access part cell , cross blood-brain placental barrier . Melatonin report synthesised placenta may receptor mediate non-receptor mediate protective function pregnancy . Severe pre-eclampsia report associate low level melatonin placenta although know placental melatonin contributes circulate level . Despite , melatonin level propose biomarker pre-eclampsia . A study suggest pregnant woman hypertensive diabetic condition low melatonin level less circadian variation , suggest potential protective role melatonin may pregnancy . Due antioxidant effect melatonin also propose protective substance woman undergo assisted reproduction technique . Rationale study There little report circulating level melatonin oxidative stress different stage normal pregnancy . More information role melatonin metabolism melatonin pregnancy well significant association adverse pregnancy outcome would inform planning large research study investigate potential role melatonin bio-marker obstetric disease potentially therapeutic agent future . This observational pilot study aim measure serum melatonin level 6-hydroxymelatonin sulphate ( major metabolite melatonin ) trimester pregnancy . STUDY OBJECTIVES Objectives Primary Objective To determine serum melatonin 6-hydroxymelatonin sulphate level differ trim pregnancy compare non-pregnant woman Secondary Objectives 1 . To determine level oxidative stress time serum sample measure lipid peroxide level 2 . To explore whether level serum melatonin 6-hydroxymelatonin sulphate vary woman develop antenatal complication ( pre-eclampsia hypertensive disease pregnancy , preterm labour gestational diabetes ) OUTCOMES Primary Outcome Serum melatonin 6-hydroxymelatonin sulphate level Secondary Outcomes 1 . Level oxidative stress time sample ( lipid peroxide level ) 2 . Outcome pregnancy ( live birth , development preeclampsia / hypertensive disease pregnancy , gestational diabetes preterm labor . STUDY DESIGN Study Description Twenty healthy woman first pregnancy recruit first antenatal ( scan ) visit 11-13 week gestation . Recruitment continue throughout medical student 's allocate project time period allow recruitment many woman possible , least twenty pregnant woman . A venous blood sample measure serum melatonin 6-hydroxymelatonin sulphate level obtain use aseptic technique . Sampling , possible , carry time routine clinical screening . The first blood sample do 11-13 week gestation ( first trimester ) could do along routine antenatal screen blood test . A second blood sample take woman attend detailed ultrasound scan approximately 20 week ( 2nd trimester ) . The participant may need routine blood test time , therefore blood sample would purpose study . A third final blood sample obtain around 28 week gestation ( third trimester ) . This could do routine 28 week appointment participant 's community midwife routine pregnancy blood test already undertaken . Consent seek participant contact applicable community midwife arrange attend midwifery appointment around 28 week . The third blood sample take either Aberdeen Maternity Hospital participant 's GP practice depend preference convenience appointment location participant community midwife . The researcher contact participant directly . If woman attend obstetric antenatal clinic gestation blood sample could alternatively obtain along routine antenatal screen blood test . Non-pregnant control recruit advertise use poster around University Aberdeen/Aberdeen Royal Infirmary campus , aim 20 non pregnant woman , age 16 45 blood sample take serum melatonin 6-hydroxy-melatonin sulphate level . Samples take time day year pregnant subject account seasonal effect . Serum melatonin measure use liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry 6-hydroxymelatonin sulphate measure use enzyme immunoassay . Lipid peroxide measure use colorimetric assay . Written inform consent obtain participant . Women ask age , body mass index , gestation stage , smoke status , name community midwife series screen question determine eligibility accord inclusion criterion . Once recruit , anonymous code assign data keep separately identifiable information .</detailed_description>
