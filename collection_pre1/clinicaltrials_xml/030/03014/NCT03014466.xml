	<brief_summary>Preoperative anxiety pediatric patient undergo surgical procedure previously show increase likelihood family stressor , post- operative pain , agitation , sleep disturbance , negative behavioral change . The purpose study use non-invasive device determine whether bed mount Video Projection unit ( i.e . BERT , Bedside EnterRtainment Theater ) effective standard care tablet ( i.e. , iPad ) prevent anxiety surgery among child undergo anesthesia surgery . The anticipated primary outcome reduction child 's anxiety preoperative operating room set compliance mask induction .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Screen-Based Distraction Tool Preoperative Preparation</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Patients initially approach study pre-surgical phone call every patient receive prior procedure Nurse Practitioner ( NP ) . During phone call , NP ask family would interested participate research study may contact research team . If family express interest , NP follow-up research team eligibility screen phone call give . If family decline interest , respect decision pursue family study . Not family available initial pre- surgical phone call , case , medical staff member research assistant approach family pre-operative hold area day surgery . Interested family give brochure information study screen eligibility . Upon arrival preoperative preparation , research assistant go consent assent form parent child answer question may study . While child prepped transported preoperative hold area , research staff member determine whether participant receive standard care ( i.e . entertainment via tablet ) investigative device ( i.e . BERT , Bedside EnteRtainment System ; Video Projection ) via random assignment . Once determine , research staff set system patient ask fill questionnaire , REDCap paper , feel time surgery . Parents also ask fill questionnaire feeling child 's preoperative emotion . The child continue view preoperative entertainment induction . A video camera mount BERT screen tablet use retrospective coding blind research assistant . When possible , blind research assistant also live-code observer-rated survey . We aim occur around 20-30 % participant . care ) The research assistants complete mYPAS ( modify Yale Preoperative Anxiety Scale ) ICC ( Induction Compliance Checklist ) cod vivo . Vitals ( i.e . blood pressure , heart rate , oxygen saturation , end tidal CO2 , temperature ) also record undergo preoperative preparation . The parent ask remain child preoperative hold area child undergone induction . Once child enters induction phase OR , patient undergo surgery schedule . Post-operation , research assistant examine child 's behavior wake anesthesia . They also give parent , child , child 's anesthesiologist survey experience screen-based device . 1 week surgery , research assistant follow parent/guardian question child 's preoperative perioperative via phone . The call also audio record . After one-week follow-up survey , study conclude participant . b ) Explain research procedure least risky performed consistent sound research design . All survey question mean answer question pertain study aim . Set Video Projection unit perform trained member research team minimal risk patient . The risk associate study include possibility participation discover others outside study team . This highly unlikely give precaution describe late application . c ) State deception use . If , provide rationale describe debriefing procedure . Since fully inform participant consent process form , complete alteration consent ( section 13 ) . Submit debrief script ( section 16 ) . Deception use . ) State audio video record occur . Describe become record use , e.g. , show scientific meeting , erase . Describe final disposition recording . Participants video tap capture patient 's full experience Video Projection unit effect preoperative perioperative procedure . The video camera mount tablet BERT system . Videos cod research team , contain PHI . Audio record follow-up phone call parent ' response fully capture measure . These videos audio file store secure , password protect , encrypt computer , authorize member study access . The videos audio file destroy 6 year publication study . These videos audio file may present scientific meeting include consent . e ) Describe alternative procedure course treatment , , might advantageous participant . Describe potential risk benefit associate . Any standard treatment withheld must disclose consent process form . ( i.e . standard-of-care drug , different interventional procedure , procedure treatment , palliative care , research study ) . This randomized trial validate effectiveness use Video Projection unit , therefore subject undergo standard treatment result randomization . The randomization perform research assistant follow consent . Parents must child pre-operative area induction . They option opt-out study parent child want parent present strong patient parent preference pharmacological anxiolytic specific anxiety-reduction technique . f ) Will possible continue ( ) appropriate therapy participant ( ) conclusion study ? N/A . The investigative device implement allay preoperative anxiety , therefore continue surgery . g ) Study Endpoint . What guideline end point evaluate different treatment ( i.e . study drug , device , procedure ) study ? If one prove clearly effective another ( others ) course study , study terminate project total participant population enrol ? When study end important difference detect ? The endpoint study determine completion target number participant . The target number participant study 30 participant randomize group ( i.e . standard care Video Projection unit group ) total 60 patient complete study .</detailed_description>
