	<brief_title>The Effect Naloxone Methylnaltrexone Esophageal Sensitivity Health</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>INTRODUCTION Gastroesophageal reflux disease ( GERD ) , define presence symptom lesion attribute reflux gastric content esophagus , increasingly prevalent condition Western society . The typical symptom heartburn regurgitation , GERD manifest variety esophageal extra-esophageal symptom ( e.g . chronic cough ) . In human , pain multimodal experience compost sensory , physiological psychological aspect . In order mimic clinical situation , experimental model base multimodal test regimen different receptor central nervous system mechanism activate . Advances esophageal sensory stimulation establish typical atypical symptom may arise acid reflux , also reflux event less acidic pH ( pH 4-7 ) . In GERD patient symptom persist spite PPIs , ongoing weakly acidic reflux well establish main underlying factor . The basis symptom generation weakly-acidic reflux event remain determined , acid sensitivity pH range 4-7 , mechanical distention ( enhanced air refluxate ) , sensitivity chemical factor ( e.g . bile ) esophageal hypersensitivity physiological level reflux propose . HYPOTHESIS The investigator speculate visceral hypersensitivity play important role symptom perception . This suggest reflux parameter usual within physiological number PPI therapy . Naloxone indicate complete reversal opioid depression , include respiratory depression , induced natural synthetic opioids . Naloxone also indicate diagnosis suspect know acute opiod overdosage . Off label also use alcoholic coma , Alzheimer 's disease , schizophrenia , opioid addiction narcotic induce pruritis . Methylnaltrexone bromide ( Relistor ) indicate treatment opioid-induced constipation patient advance illness receive palliative care , response laxative therapy sufficient . AIM The aim study investigate effect naloxone ( IV IM administration ) methylnaltrexone ( subcutaneous administration ) esophageal sensitivity , group healthy volunteer order evaluate role endogenous opiods symptom perception gastro-esophageal reflux disease.. METHODS Studies perform 12 healthy volunteer , sufficient data compare subject mutual able make conclusion . Since concern measurement drug never test field work , investigator information regard esophageal sensitivity administration different substance . Because previous experience type measurement ( i.c . multimodal stimulation substance ) , investigator conclude number 12 healthy volunteer sufficient detect 30 % difference 5 % significance level . For safety reason , subject prohibit drive vehicle work heavy machinery day study . Each subject willing participate submit physical examination . Medical history take use medication inquire . Studies perform use multimodal esophageal stimulation probe allow chemical , mechanical , electrical thermal stimulation esophagus one single protocol . During stimulation , subject instruct record perception symptom use electronic VAS meter . This device allow subject scale perception pain scale 0 10 . First perception ( VAS=1 ) , pain perception threshold ( VAS=5 ) pain tolerance threshold ( VAS=7 ) record . All type esophageal stimulation immediately terminate pain tolerance threshold reach . At time pain tolerance threshold reach ( VAS=7 ) , subject ask draw refer pain area , identify pain locate . Thermal stimulation Thermal stimulation perform re-circulating saline solution ( NaCl 0.09 % ) , heated water bath , balloon mount probe . Stimulation temperature steadily increase increase flow rate water bath balloon . Flow rate control computer operate pump . The volume balloon keep constant 5ml avoid mechanical stimulation esophagus . A temperature sensor present balloon montinuously monitor stimulation temperature , display computer display throughout study . Mechanical stimulation Mechanical stimulation perform distention balloon mount probe . The flow saline ( NaCl 0.09 % ) balloon , induce distention , regulate computer control pump . The volume balloon display computer screen throughout stimulation . Mechanical stimulation perform water 37°C , avoid thermal stimulation esophagus . Mechanical stimulation precede preconditioning period balloon distend pain perception threshold ( VAS=5 ) reach . This preconditioning period use precondition esophageal tissue allow subject get use feel mechanical distention . Electrical stimulation Electrical stimulation perform 2 stimulation electrode mount proximal balloon . Electrical block pulse give use standard electrical stimulator . Single burst pulse give duration 1ms 200Hz . The amplitude pulse steadily increase , step 0.5mA interval 15sec . The maximum intensity limit 60 mA , previous study show atrial capturing high intensity . ECG monitoring perform safety measure electrical stimulation esophagus . Chemical stimulation Chemical stimulation perform distal esophagus infuse acidic solution ( HCl 0.1N ) esophagus . Chemical stimulation control peristaltic infusion pump flow rate 2ml/min . Naloxone/Methylnaltrexone placebo administration As test solution , naloxone ( bolus 0.4 mg follow continuous infusion 20 µg/kg/h ) methylnaltrexone bromide ( 12 mg s.c. , Relistor 0.6ml administrate subcutaneously ) administer . During placebo session , physiological solution ( saline 0.9 % ) , administer IV SC . Over time , participant receive placebo naloxone methylnaltrexone bromide first session random sequence . In second third session , subject receive one product he/she receive first time . STUDY OUTLINE After overnight fast subject expect endoscopy unit UZ Gasthuisberg , study perform . Three session schedule every subject : one placebo , one naloxone session one methylnaltrexone session , least one week interval . Sessions run double blind way , far placebo drug concern . The order placebo drug administration randomize draw card box card determine sequence . The volunteer receive placebo , naloxone methylnaltrexone begin session . The multimodal stimulation probe position mouth . After probe position esophagus , fix chin subject remain bed , semi-recumbent position entire study period . Esophageal stimulation perform immediately intubation . Before actual stimulation start , adaptation period subject , get use feeling probe provide instruction correct use VAS meter since VAS score monitor type stimulation . All stimulation immediately stop moment subject reach pain tolerance threshold ( VAS=7 ) . ANALYSIS Temperature , volume , electrical current measure VAS=1 ( first perception ) , VAS=5 ( pain perception threshold ) VAS=7 ( pain tolerance threshold ) use determine esophageal sensitivity . Esophageal sensitivity four different stimulus ( temperature , mechanical , electrical chemical ) compare three condition .</detailed_description>
