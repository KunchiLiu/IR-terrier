	<brief_title>Vasopressin Plasma Concentrations Patients Receiving Exogenous Vasopressin Infusion Septic Shock</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Vasopressin endogenous hormone decrease serum osmolarity increase blood pressure . As part stress response hypotension , vasopressin release posterior pituitary lead vasoconstriction agonism vascular vasopressin V1 receptor . In patient septic shock , endogenous vasopressin level initially elevate quickly fall level normal physiology ( 1.4-3.6pg/mL ) depletion endogenous store . Sharshar et al . evaluate two set patient septic shock , one evaluate earlier septic shock course ( 3.6 ± 2.3 hour , n=18 ) one evaluate later time shock onset ( mean 38.7 ± 28.4 hour , n=44 ) . The group patient evaluate earlier septic shock course likely patient evaluate later elevate ( &gt; 3.6 pg/mL ) plasma vasopressin level ( 88.9 % vs. 38.6 % , respectively ) . Similarly , case series evaluate single vasopressin level three patient septic shock , one first day shock onset two fifth sixth day shock onset . The patient earlier stage septic shock plasma vasopressin level increase ( 16pg/mL ) , two patient later stage septic shock decrease plasma vasopressin level ( 1.6 1.8pg/mL ) . The exact timing patient transition elevate endogenous vasopressin level normal level vasopressin currently unclear . In clinical trial enrol patient within first 12 hour shock onset , median endogenous vasopressin level 3.5 pg/mL ( interquartile range 1.8 , 5.3 pg/mL ; n=54 ) . Some even hypothesize vasopressin level rise clinical hypotension apparent decline vasopressin level associate onset apparent hypotension . Further complicate issue , endogenous vasopressin level show low patient septic shock compare shock etiology cardiogenic shock ( 3.1 ± 1pg/mL patient septic shock vs. 22.7 ± 2.2pg/mL patient cardiogenic shock , p &lt; 0.001 ) . The etiology discrepancy endogenous vasopressin response shock type unclear , `` relative deficiency '' vasopressin theorize exist patient septic shock . In light finding , exogenous arginine vasopressin ( AVP ) add exogenous catecholamine increase mean arterial pressure ( MAP ) decrease catecholamine requirement patient vasodilatory shock . The use AVP purpose patient septic shock keep Surviving Sepsis Campaign Guidelines . In Vasopressin Septic Shock Trial ( VASST ) , low-dose AVP infused rate 0.01-0.03 units/min combination norepinephrine achieve goal MAP 65-75mmHg . Plasma vasopressin level patient receive AVP elevate 6 ( 68.3pg/mL ) 24 hour ( 90.5pg/mL ) comparison patient receive AVP ( 3.0pg/mL baseline significant change 6 24 hour ) . Association plasma vasopressin level hemodynamic response AVP , though , evaluate VASST . Concomitant corticosteroid use observe decrease total dose administer AVP , increase proportion patient alive free vasopressor day 7 , increase plasma vasopressin concentration 33 % 6 hour 67 % 24 hour , lead low 28- 90-day mortality ( 35.9 % vs. 44.7 % , p=0.03 42.5 % vs. 55.5 % , p=0.01 , respectively ) receive AVP alone . These finding generate hypothesis concomitant administration AVP corticosteroid result increase plasma vasopressin level versus AVP administration alone , lead positive clinical outcome septic shock . Furthering hypothesis plasma vasopressin level may influence outcome septic shock , genetic difference leucyl/cystinyl aminopeptidase , primary vasopressin metabolic enzyme , associate rapid vasopressin clearance , low plasma vasopressin level , increase mortality patient septic shock . However , study evaluate vasopressin plasma concentration patient multiple shock type administer exogenous AVP observe high vasopressin concentration hemodynamic dysfunction without ( mean 14.1 ± 26 vs. 8.7 ± 10.8pg/mL , respectively ) regardless shock type . This suggest plasma vasopressin concentration may directly correlate MAP . The impact body mass ( may influence vasopressin level fixed-dose AVP administer ) hemodynamic response AVP inconsistent . Studies observe negative correlation BMI change MAP 6 hour correlation increase weight-adjusted AVP dose reduction catecholamine requirement , suggest hemodynamic response AVP associate body mass . In contrast , third study observe association BMI AVP dose require meet goal MAP AVP administer sole vasopressor . Finally , fourth find inverse correlation BMI APACHE II-adjusted 28-day mortality , regardless fact overweight obese patient receive less weight-adjusted vasopressin underweight normal weight patient . This suggest BMI may impact plasma vasopressin concentration , change vasopressin concentration may impact clinical outcome . Recently , retrospective study complete Cleveland Clinic evaluate predictor hemodynamic response fixed-dose AVP patient septic shock . Patients consider responder AVP decrease catecholamine dose achieve MAP≥65mmHg 6 hour . The overall response rate fixed-dose vasopressin 45.4 % . Within study , admission surgical neuroscience intensive care unit ( ICU ) vs. medical ICU low lactate level associate increase chance response AVP ( OR 1.71 , 95 % CI 1.175-2.463 , p=0.0049 OR 0.925 , 95 % CI 0.887-0.965 , p=0.0003 , respectively ) logistic regression . Factors previously find impact vasopressin level ( concomitant use corticosteroid ) associate hemodynamic response . However , plasma vasopressin level evaluate retrospective study . The relationship plasma vasopressin concentration hemodynamic response patient receive AVP unclear . While concomitant corticosteroid observe increase plasma vasopressin concentration , corticosteroid show shorten time septic shock , possibly confound relationship plasma vasopressin concentration hemodynamic response patient receive agent . As previously mention , data correlate body mass hemodynamic response inconsistent , vasopressin level patient receive fix dose AVP seem low patient higher body mass . The recent study Cleveland Clinic find association factor associate increased plasma vasopressin level hemodynamic response . Together , data call question idea dose-response relationship plasma vasopressin concentration hemodynamic response . This study seek prospectively evaluate whether plasma vasopressin level associate improved rate hemodynamic response fixed-dose AVP therapy patient septic shock .</detailed_description>
