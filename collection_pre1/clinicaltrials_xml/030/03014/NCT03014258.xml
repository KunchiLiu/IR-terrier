	<detailed_description>This phase I study assess acquisition immunity Pf malaria course 4 sequential Controlled Human Malaria Infections ( CHMI ) 3 year , 10 healthy adult participant . 10 subject initially challenge 5 uninfected mosquito ( mock ) , follow 4 challenge 5 mosquito infect drug sensitive , P. falciparum parasite ( strain NF54 ) 2 , 8 , 20 , 32 month later . For final three infective CMHIs six additional immunologic malaria-naïve subject enrol challenged infectivity control . All volunteer ( repeat CHMI subject infectivity control ) evaluate part inpatient stay diagnose Pf malaria infection treat Coartem® ( artemether/lumefantrine ) Malarone® ( Atovaquone/proguanil ) . Inpatient observation occur Study Days 9-19 three-day directly observe therapy P. falciparum infection complete two negative smear separate time interval &gt; 12 hour document . A third negative smear &gt; 12 hour previous two inpatient smear document affirm malaria cure . The repeat CHMI subject additional outpatient visit day 1 , 3 , 5 , 7 challenge obtain blood sample monitor development immunity . The study expect last 48 month include 28 healthy male female volunteer ( 10 study volunteer 18 naïve control confirm Pf infectivity 2nd -4th CHMI challenge ) ages18 45 year , inclusive , great Baltimore community . The primary objective study determine whether protective immunity parasite infection develop follow repeat CHMI . The secondary objective : 1 ) determine whether clinical sign symptom malaria decrease intensity duration follow repeat CHMI , 2 ) identify PBMCs activated proliferate exposure compare response time sequential CHMI , 3 ) track production antibody react P. falciparum sporozoites blood stage parasite .</detailed_description>
