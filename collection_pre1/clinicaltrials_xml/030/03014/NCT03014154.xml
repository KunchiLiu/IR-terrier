	<brief_summary>Asthma chronic inflammatory disease Airways recur character . The obstruction airflow carry short-and long-term consequence require prophylactic intervention emergency many time . The child due immaturity respiratory system associate use steroid suffer structural consequence , example , physical deconditioning intensifies symptoms disease affect negatively quality life . Therefore , set physical training program suitable paediatric population , use resource increase adherence regular practice exercise , difference reduction number exacerbation , sensation Dyspnea dose medication , positively impact clinical picture child asthmatic . The investigator conduct randomize , blind order evaluate effect train active video game associate resist exercise exercise inflammatory functional outcome resist asthmatic child .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : General Objective : analyze effect pulmonary rehabilitation program aerobic exercise involve VGA ( Xbox 360 ) system associate exercise strength resistance upper low limb patient susceptible asthma . Specific Objectives : To evaluate clinical control asthma , quality life , airway inflammation , exercise tolerance energy expenditure aerobic training videogame ( Xbox 360 ) associate strength train resistance upper low limb . Compare train group result obtain evaluated variable . MATERIAL AND METHODS : Ethical legal aspect : This Protocol approve Committee Ethics Research Human Beings University Nove de Julho ( Brazil ) , paragraph opinion . 9072362014 . The right must sign Free Informed Consent Term ( TFCC ) being authorize removed time without encumbrance . All study procedures confidential . Characterization study : This clinical trial develop Laboratory Functional Respiratory Analysis ( LARESP ) Master Post-Graduation Rehabilitation Sciences University Nove de Julho ( UNINOVE ) . Subject Recruitment : Patients recruit consecutively select eligibility accord propose protocol , invited Hospital Set de Mandaqui ( São Paulo , Brazil ) refer LARESP ( São Paulo , Brazil ) . After consent participation study FICS signature , patient submit evaluation . Assessments divide two step take first week training protocol commence follow week . Before training protocol , patient submit anthropometric electrical bioelectrical impedance test , respond quality life questionnaire ( PAQLQ ) clinical control asthma , pulmonary function test , spirometry , respiratory muscle strength ) , Fraction Nitric Oxide Test ( FeNO ) , incremental test upper low limb , 1 repetition maximal test ( 1RM ) functional capacity test mean treadmill test ( Bruce protocol ) . Reviews : After consent participation study , patient evaluate . Evaluations divide two stage conduct first week training protocol begin follow week . After 8 week , patient submit initial evaluation . Anthropometric : Body weight obtained digital scale ( Filizola ® , Brazil ) . The height evaluate wall-mounted stadiometer ( Wiso ) , resolution millimeter . To obtain Z score , use Anthro plus program , use World Health Organization ( WHO ) standard Z score . BMI Z score use classify obese eutrophic child . Body Composition : The participant ' body composition evaluate use four-way electric bioimpedance scale , mechanism currently support accurate . Biodynamic ™ Model 310 ( Biodynamics Corporation Seattle WA , USA ) . For measurement body composition foam place four electrode patient ' skin , previously clean alcohol . Two electrode place upper right corner ( next digital metacarpophalangeal dorsal surface hand another prominence distal radius ulna ) another low extremity also half body ( distal distal ) Second medial lateral malleolus ankle ) . To perform desired patient instruct drink caffeinated beverage least 12:00 test ; Do eat drink period 4:00 test , urinate 30 minute test perform physical activity 6:00 test . Quality life questionnaire : The Pediatric Asthma Quality Life Questionnaire ( PAQLQ ) health-related quality life . It use instrument childhood asthma , questionnaire best know validated Brazilian population use child adolescents 7 17 year . The PAQLQ consist 23 question divide three area , namely : physical activity limitation ( five issue ) ; Symptoms ( 10 question ) emotion ( eight question ) . Responses measure use 7-point scale , 1 indicates maximum loss 7 loss . Asthma Control Questionnaire : The Asthma Control Questionnaire ( ACQ ) questionnaire assess clinical control asthmatic patient consist 7 question , 5 related asthma symptom , use short-acting ß2 agonist rescue medication pre-bronchodilator Percentage Of FEV1 predict . The ACQ score mean item range 0 ( fully control ) 6 ( control ) , obtain period 7 day . The cutoff point uncontrolled asthma 2 point . The patient classify accord ACQ score control asthma ( 0.75 ) , partially control ( 0.75 -1.5 ) uncontrolled ( 1.5 ) . A minimum clinical difference difference 0.5 7-point scale . The version use ACQ6 . Pulmonary function test : The lung function test perform spirometry , analyze lung volume , capacity flow . The test consist inspiratory expiratory maneuver perform use Easy One ® brand spirometer , previously calibrate NDD . For test , three reproducible maneuver obtain , accord ATS recommendation . All test conduct air-conditioned environment reference value use Polgar , suitable child , classification purpose , well post-intervention evolution . Respiratory muscular endurance ( FMR ) : The FMR evaluate mean manovacuometry , obtain maximum respiratory pressure ( MIP MEP ) , use analog manovacuometer ( Wika brand ) , dimension cmH2O , operate range ± 300 cmH2O , previously calibrate equipped pressure wall . Each operation repeat least 5 8 time , high value accept , provide value exceed value immediately 10 . Fraction expire Nitric Oxide : Expiring Nitric Oxide Fraction ( FENO ) The hay measure follow ATS criterion Mino NIOX ® ( Aerocrine ) equipment . Hay reading perform reader , part per billion ( ppb ) . To prevent air contamination sinus cavity , procedure perform nose clip . Incremental Test : Peripheral muscle strength perform 1RM test determine maximum training load . The incremental test conduct upper limb consist raise dumbbell diagonally , determination lower limb load , bend extension movement Legpress . Before start test child perform 5 10 repetition , without load , learn movement properly warm muscle involve . The initial load use 0.5 kg progressively increase ( 0.5 kg ) child reach maximum tolerated load , perform full range motion . Treadmill Treadmill ( Bruce Protocol ) : The stress test , provide information exercise capacity facilitate access pathophysiological characteristic , drug efficacy potential risk disease , best suit child , physiologically poorly develop knee extensor . And , reason , ergometric test prefer cycloergometer young child ( child 4 6 year ) . The protocol use Bruce , although develop adult , widely apply child , 4 year age . This protocol use provide information exercise capacity , pathophysiological characteristic fight , drug efficacy potential risk disease . The protocol discontinue child report fatigue reach maximum heart rate around 195 205bpm . Throughout test , blood pressure ( BP ) peripheral oxygen saturation ( SpO2 ) measure EKG do . The Borg scale use quantify sensation shortness breath exertion rest . Randomization : Eligible child randomize two different group , one video game training ( VG ) associate video game training strength resistance upper limb low limb . ( VGR ) . The allocation do opaque , seal numbered envelope . Two envelope prepare participant . An envelope choose patient complete revision . The evaluation process conduct blind randomization blind investigator participate Protocol .</detailed_description>
