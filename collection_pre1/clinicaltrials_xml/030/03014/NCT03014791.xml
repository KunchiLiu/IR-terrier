	<brief_summary>Hypertension , also know high blood pressure , chronic medical condition , blood pressure elevate . This common condition , lead severe complication cardiovascular disease , heart attack , stroke kidney disease , detect treat early . Accumulating evidence suggest incidence hypertension varies accord age , ethnicity obesity . In order obtain in-depth knowledge pathophysiological mechanism hypertension , aim investigate haemodynamic biochemical correlate elevate blood pressure across adult age-span , determine extent body size ethnicity impact association . We also wish investigate impact hypertension key target organ ( end-organ damage ) . The primary objective study compare mechanism regulate blood pressure hypertensive non-hypertensive participant across adult age span , assess influence body mass index ethnic background mechanism . Secondary objective investigate association blood pressure cardiovascular physiology across adult age span rest sub-maximal exercise investigate impact blood pressure haemodynamics key organ include artery heart assess end-organ damage endothelial function , arterial structure leave ventricular mass/function . This study combine case-control cross-sectional study describe procedure time commitment require investigate scientific aim . This single centre study conduct secondary care environment . Both male female age 18 able provide inform consent consider study . People pregnant , currently receive dialysis , illness life expectancy &lt; 1 year , current active malignancy provide inform consent ineligible study . The study open five year patient complete maximum four visit 12 month period . Participants complete variety non-invasive physiological assessment cardiovascular system lung function . There minimally invasive procedure complete , include blood test assessment small artery endothelial function involve insertion small needle local anesthetic .</brief_summary>
