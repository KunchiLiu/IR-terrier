	<brief_summary>Alirocumab injectable treatment elevate blood cholesterol . The hypothesis study also increase cholesterol excretion body stool , process sometimes call reverse cholesterol transport . A cholesterol metabolic study do 6 week alirocumab treatment . If alirocumab increase reverse cholesterol transport , possible action provide additional protection cardiovascular disease .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Alirocumab Reverse Cholesterol Transport</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This study single-site , randomize , placebo-controlled clinical trial 24 subject expect complete 8-week study period . The performance site Washington University School Medicine . Even though alirocumab approve drug , investigator consider phase I trial physiological study primary endpoint change fecal cholesterol excretion measure reverse cholesterol transport . It treatment protocol use healthy subject . Subjects great ideal cholesterol take cholesterol lower drug study . All receive whole body cholesterol metabolism test treatment 6 week either alirocumab placebo . Each test take 2 week . On first day subject receive 35 mg cholesterol-d7 intravenously blood sample obtain order measure cholesterol turnover rate , pool size , esterification rate , transfer HDL LDL removal plasma compartment . Fecal cholesterol excretion relate parameter measure day 13 14 relative steady-state obtain . During time subject consume metabolic kitchen diet control cholesterol phytosterol content consume oral tracer capsule consist cholesterol-d5 sitostanol-d4 . Plasma stool sample analyze gas chromatography/tandem mass spectrometry determine daily percent cholesterol excretion rapidly-mixing body cholesterol pool , fecal cholesterol mass percent cholesterol absorption . The cholesterol metabolic test repeat day 43 final measurement make day 57 . Treatment effect , define difference active placebo treatment calculate . Based animal data expect alirocumab increase efficiency cholesterol excretion body pools rate removal cholesterol ester plasma .</detailed_description>
