	<detailed_description>Musculoskeletal condition common source pain . Specifically , osteoarthritis affect nearly 27 million people United States . This disease lead breakdown cartilage surface joint , serve connection point bone body , cause large amount pain disability patient . Increasing number available treatment option osteoarthritis become increasingly important Americans continue age . Using stem cell take bone marrow one non-operative treatment gain popularity recent past . This study aim clarify procedure best do compare stem cell concentration patient outcome ( short long term ) patient stem cell take one area v two ( unilateral v bilateral posterior superior iliac spine ( PSIS ) aspiration ) . This research study involve participant randomly place one two group ; one group cell take one hip , cell take hip . Both approach perform clinic currently , consider standard care . All bone marrow collect purpose study obtain principal investigator perform standard procedure . In obtain sample physician abide standard care set forth Bone Marrow Aspiration Concentrate procedure .</detailed_description>
