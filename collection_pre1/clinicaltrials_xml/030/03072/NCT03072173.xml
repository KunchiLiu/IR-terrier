	<brief_summary>We intend study , depth , quantitative qualitative property nasal respiration sleep-disordered breathing sleep apnea relation ( CPAP ) treatment final goal improve patient outcome . To temporarily alter patient ' nasal airflow monitored sleep lower CPAP air pressure , make CPAP treatment acceptable patient . Additionally plan implement highly advanced computerized modelling collaboration OSASMOD research consortium St. Olavs Hospital/NTNU SINTEF predict result alteration ultimately , use prediction improve plan outcome nasal surgery .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>The Role Nose Snoring Sleep Apnea</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Based result previous study hypothesize nose play significant role normal sleep respiration particular large role sleep disorder breathe previously record . The overall aim project gain insight nasal respiration wake sleep , anatomy , physiology pathophysiology . Additionally , look olfactory dysfunction , reduce sense smell , know problem OSAS patient ( n=30 ) , try determine dysfunction disturb sleep architecture result frequent deoxygenations night . To propose implement current diagnostic tool available diagnostics sleep disordered breathing polysomnography ( PSG ) , combination rhinological investigation 4-phase rhinomanometry technique two-way fluid structure interaction ( FSI ) computational fluid dynamic ( CFD ) analysis patient . For olfactory testing use standardize smell test . These examination combination give u detailed view factor influence nasal respiration . Additionally , use interventional approach propose study . Patient nasal resistance modify monitored sleep implement conventional decongestant nasal spray double blind RCT order study effect vary nasal resistance nocturnal respiration sleep architecture . Findings , applicable , compare two-way fluid structure interaction computational fluid dynamic model patient study find correlative value thus assess predicative value computer model . In short term finding could improve patient adherence CPAP lower CPAP pressure . Long term aim improve accuracy nasal surgery . Potential end point research follow : A good understanding nasal respiration whole Better treatment adherence satisfaction sleep apnea patient Improved treatment strategy sleep apnea patient Improved diagnostics nasal airflow pathology More focused target medical surgical intervention impair nasal airflow</detailed_description>
