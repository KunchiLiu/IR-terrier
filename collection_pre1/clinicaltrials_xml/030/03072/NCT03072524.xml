	<brief_summary>The aim study develop validate simple prehospital stroke scale , would predict presence large vessel occlusion ( LVO ) patient acute stroke . This study prospectively evaluate predictive value new simple pre-hospital scale ( FAST PLUS test ) presence large vessel occlusion anterior intracranial circulation . The FAST PLUS test consist two part : first well-known FAST test , employ possible case stroke occurrence . This test consist follow item : Speech ( score 0-1 ) , Facial palsy ( 0-1 ) , failure Arm motor function ( 0-1 ) , Time ( 0-1 ) . The second part FAST PLUS test evaluate presence severe arm leg motor deficit ( score 0-1 ) unilateral occurrence motor function deficit ( score 0-1 ) . The FAST PLUS test use prospectively place stroke onset train medical emergency technician . The first objective study evaluate sensitivity , specificity , positive negative predictive value test relate presence occlusion intracranial artery ( intracranial carotid artery , T occlusion occlusion Middle Cerebral artery segment M1 M2 ) . CT angiography diagnose LVO . The second objective study ass inter-rater variability among stroke specialist emergency technician , concern presence severe motor arm leg deficit . The third objective : After implementation FAST TEST clinical practice , aim achieve acceleration transport time FAST PLUS positive patient via direct transport Comprehensive Stroke Center mechanical thrombectomy .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The effective treatment acute ischemic stroke limit administration intravenous tissue-type plasminogen activator within first 4.5 hour symptom onset endovascular thrombectomy 6 ( 8 ) hour symptoms onset . Intravenous thrombolysis administer near Primary Stroke Centers ( PSC ) . In case large vessel occlusion , endovascular therapy ( mechanical thrombectomy ) utilize . Mechanical thrombectomy offer Comprehensive Stroke Centers ( CSC ) , due necessary presence special endovascular team procedure . Practically , two option transport patient endovascular treatment . If first one use , suspect stroke patient transport primary stroke center . Then , rapid examination provide , patient determine stroke , administration intravenous thrombolysis occurs . Patients diagnosis stroke large vessel occlusion consequently transport Comprehensive Stroke Center order receive mechanical thrombectomy . This first choice accelerate thrombolysis administration delay endovascular procedure . The second option entail selection patient suspect LVO stroke site stroke onset , patient directly transport Comprehensive Stroke Centers . The second choice accelerate endovascular procedure , may delay intravenous thrombolysis . The disadvantage might overload CSC misdiagnosed patient ( stroke mimic non LVO stroke patient ) . We identify suspected stroke patient pre-hospitably relative accuracy . The FAST test simple highly specific tool identify stroke patient . * It consist four item Face , Arm , Speech , Time . Unfortunately , FAST test able evaluate severity stroke , probably link occlusion large artery . The one test ( RACE test ) prospectively studied evaluate sensitivity specificity diagnosis large vessel occlusion . In hospital ( stroke centre ) , recognize stroke severity accord NIHS scale , scale suitable emergency service difficulty . Therefore , desined simple new test - FAST PLUS test identification severe stroke patient site , immediately onset stroke . FAST PLUS test consist two part : first one well-known FAST test selects suspect stroke patient consist follow evaluation : Speech ( score 0-1 ) , Facial palsy ( 0-1 ) , failure Arm motor function ( 0-1 ) , time ( 0-1 ) . The time mean speed onset symptom 30 minute . The second part FAST PLUS test evaluate presence severe arm leg motor deficit ( score 0-1 ) unilateral occurrence motor function deficit ( score 0-1 ) . ( Figure one ) The work hypothesis : We assume patient clinically severe stroke positive FAST PLUS test high probability presence large cerebral vessel occlusion . The aim study : A ) The validation new pre-hospital test - FAST PLUS - identify stroke patient LVO . The objective study evaluate predictive value FAST PLUS test detection patient acute stroke large vessel occlusion ( LVO ) use medical emergency technician pre-hospital phase . We presume stroke severity , accord item 4 5 NIHSS link occlusion ACM M1 intracranial ICA . The FAST PLUS test consist two part ( fig . 1 ) , first one FAST test identifying patient stroke . The second part test three item , evaluate severity hemiparesis unilateral disability . The FAST PLUS test positive least two item positive first part ( Time must always positive + presence one three symptom least ) three item positive second part . B ) The second aim study determine inter-rater variability emergency technician stroke specialist evaluation NIHS scale , item 4 5 . The agreement mean agreement severe hemiparesis evaluation paramedic ( FAST PLUS test positive ) stroke specialist examination ( NIHSS 3 4 point item 4,5 NIHSS ) . C ) The third aim study shorten time onset stroke hospital entry time arrive emergency service site stroke hospital door implementation FAST PLUS test daily medical practice . The first phase : The creation educational material emergency technician . The second phase : The education test emergency technician via e-learning web seminar . The aim education learn whether Emergency service use FAST PLUS test correctly . We plan 6 month time period first second phase study . The third phase : A/ collect 400 FAST PLUS test stroke patient 12 hour stroke onset hospital arrival . B/ calculate primary secondary tertiary outcome measure study We plan 12 month time period third phase study . For statistical analysis , X software use . Receiver operate curve area receiver operate curve ( c-statistics ) calculate measure predictive ability LVO FAST plus test . Ideal prediction produce c-statistic 1.00 ; precision well chance associate c-statistic â‰¤0.50 . Correlation scale ( FAST test second part NIHSS item 4 5 ) analyze nonparametric Spearman coefficient . Cross table different cutoff value FAST plus test use evaluate sensitivity , specificity , positive predictive value , negative predictive value , overall accuracy presence VO .</detailed_description>
