	<brief_summary>The literature suggest Mindfulness Based Intervention may effective treatment anxiety symptom . The objective study compare clinical effectiveness Mindfulness Based Intervention - Mind Body Training ( MBT ) - selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor ( Fluoxetine ) active control group ( Quality Life ) different biological clinical outcome , well evaluate possible mechanism treatment response . Methods : three arm randomize , control clinical trial . Participants General Anxiety Disorder recruit . A community sample 192 participant randomly allocate MBT , Fluoxetine Quality Life Group . Instruments measure anxiety , worry meta-worry symptom , quality life , acceptance self-compassion , mindfulness , rumination emotion regulation apply . The patient submit Error Related Negativity ( ERN ) Heart Rate Variability ( HRV ) measure . The primary outcome effectiveness MBT compare Fluoxetine Quality Life Group symptomatic outcome . The secondary outcome effectiveness os intervention emotional regulation process biological measure ( ERN HRV ) , evaluation BMT mechanisms possible mediation treatment response emotional process like mindfulness , acceptance self-compassion , biological change ( ERN HRV ) , metacognition .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Randomized Clinical Trial Mindfulness Based Intervention Generalized Anxiety Disorder</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Generalized Anxiety Disorder ( GAD ) prevalent Anxiety Disorder Specific Phobia . It characterize persistent excessive anxiety worry different domain life difficult control , individual experience physical symptom , like restlessness feel key edge , easily fatigue , difficulty concentrate mind go blank , irritability , muscle tension , sleep disturbance . Also , GAD one common mental disorder primary care setting , associate increase use health care resource disability , functional impairment , psychiatric medical comorbidities . Despite prevalence impairment , disorder under-recognized , less one-third patient adequately treat . The literature demonstrate either psychotropic medication cognitive behavior therapy ( CBT ) appear effective treating GAD . However , substantial number patient respond initial treatment , , although response rate inconsistent across study , 38 % treated patient remission five year . Moreover , GAD usually chronic disorder wax wan course , require long-term treatment . In relation biological mechanism GAD , study report enhance Error-Related Negativity ( ERN ) low Heart Rate Variability ( HRV ) GAD patient . The first biological marker could associate anxious apprehension main finding find GAD second one reflect reduction parasympathetic modulation . On hand , already know mindfulness meditation practice associate increase autonomic regulation stimulate parasympathetic system . In relation cognitive factor , literature demonstrate GAD patient higher level experiential avoidance distress emotion , negative believe worry meta-worry . Mindfulness practice develop foster self-regulation . Historically , mindfulness exercise use clinical protocol link Buddhist framework mean alleviate suffer cultivate compassion . In West , role mindfulness health promotion target study since 70 incorporated cognitive-behavioural treatment . The Body mind training ( BMT ) treatment protocol focus movement motor system tool mindfulness practice . More three decade study show positive effect mindfulness base intervention ( MBIs ) mental physical health quality life either general population clinical population . Also , MBIs seem effective lasting alternative treat anxiety . In relation GAD , study show MBI 's effective , , generally , limit small sample size use wait list control instead active control group . So , objective research evaluate effectiveness BMT intervention compare Fluoxetine Quality Life Group treatment GAD patient . Also , intend evaluate biological cognitive mechanism different treatment mediator analysis . It single blind Randomized Controlled Trial three arm treatment . The individual recruit community . Generalized Anxiety patient ( accord Mini-International Neuropsychiatric Interview ) randomly allocate ( 1:1:1 ratio ) receive either antidepressant : BMT : Control Group . Research assessor mask . Because nature intervention , patient clinician aware treatment allocation . The duration treatments 8 week . Before , week 5 , intervention , participant assess Hamilton Anxiety Rating Scale ( HAM-A ) , Clinical Global Impression ( CGI ) , Anxiety Sensitivity Index ( ASI ) , Penn State Worry Questionnaire ( PSWQ ) , Difficulties Emotion Regulation Scale ( DERS ) , Five Facet Mindfulness Questionnaire ( FFMQ ) , Self-Compassion Scale ( SCS ) , Action Acceptance Questionnaire ( AAQ ) , Ruminative Response Scale ( RRS ) , Metacognition Questionnaire ( MCQ-30 ) , Meta-worry Questionnaire ( MWQ ) , WHOQOL-Bref . Also , intervention , participant answer Early Life Experiences Scale ( ELES ) Early Memories Warmth Safeness Scale ( EMWSS ) . The HRV ERN assess intervention .</detailed_description>
