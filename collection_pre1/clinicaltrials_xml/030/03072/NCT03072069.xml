	<brief_summary>Anesthesia modern age least two-drug process consist opioid sedative hypnotic ( e.g. , fentanyl propofol combination , among others ) . Therefore , important understand interaction pharmacodynamics agent use clinically . A good method visualize pharmacodynamic interaction behavior drug combination response surface model . Unlike traditional isobolograms represent concentration two agent combine produce single degree drug effect , response surface model characterize complete spectrum interaction two agent possible level concentration effect . The investigator try use response surface model evaluate effect anesthetic combination autonomic system .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Analysis Autonomic Function During Anesthesia Using Response Surface Model</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Spectral analysis heart rate variability ( HRV ) widely use , noninvasive technique assess autonomic index neural cardiac control . The presence low-frequency ( LF ) high-frequency ( HF ) oscillatory rhythms variability R-R interval ( RRI ) well establish . To date , believe LF mediate parasympathetic sympathetic system , whereas HF mediate primarily parasympathetic system . The current study use HRV order characterize autonomic nerve system ( ANS ) activity patient stable hypnosis , nociceptive surgical stimulation ( adequate ) light ( inadequate ) analgesia . These effect may vary anesthetic technique use . Despite previous study , attempt derive relation anesthetic concentration HRV far remain inconclusive . Such characterization would provide additional information behavior ANS different anesthesic drug level may lay basis development new clinical application . Propofol widely use clinical practice favorable recovery profile low incidence side effect . However , induction anesthesia propofol often associate significant decrease arterial blood pressure heart rate ( HR ) . The hypotensive effect propofol attribute decrease systemic vascular resistance cardiac output cause combination venous arterial vasodilation , impaired baroreflex mechanism depression myocardial contractility . Besides , conflict data regard effect propofol cardiac sympathetic parasympathetic tone . The investigator hypothesis different propofol anesthetic drug level would reproducible effect HRV . In addition , result reliably characterize anesthetized patient provide HRV use analysis assess transient rapid change ANS activity . Therefore , first goal study test hypothesis propofol anesthesia would affect HRV depend concentration , opioid midazolam . Second , investigator evaluate effect anesthetic combination autonomic system .</detailed_description>
