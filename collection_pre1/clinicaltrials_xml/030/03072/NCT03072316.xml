	<brief_title>Impact Radiotherapy Patients Undergoing DIEP Flap Breast Reconstruction</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Since 1997 , breast cancer common cancer UK , account 31 % new cancer woman . According late statistic publish Cancer Research UK , approximately 50,000 woman diagnose breast cancer 2010 ( 1 ) . In UK , 53 % woman symptomatic breast cancer 27 % screen-detected breast cancer treat surgically mastectomy ; therefore approximately 21,500 undergo therapeutic mastectomy year ( 2 ) . Guidelines National Institute Health Clinical Excellence ( NICE ) recommend immediate breast reconstruction offer woman operation mastectomy ( 3 ) . The UK National Mastectomy Breast Reconstruction Audit Second Report 2009 ( 4 ) state 21 % cohort underwent immediate breast reconstruction , thus one would expect approximately 4500 woman undergo immediate reconstruction year UK . A breast reconstruction mimic natural appearance breast shape , volume compliance , together give symmetrical result . Breast reconstruction range implant-based method autologous free flap reconstruction , deep inferior epigastric perforator ( DIEP ) flap , first popularise Allen 1994 ( 5 ) . In unit , DIEP flap become one reliable popular method breast reconstruction , flap failure rate le 1 % . We , like others , view current `` gold standard '' breast reconstruction ( 6 ) ( 7 ) ( 8 ) . Adjuvant post-mastectomy radiotherapy ( PMRT ) offer woman high risk chest wall recurrence . The perceived detrimental effect radiotherapy immediate breast reconstruction `` one-off '' nature autologous reconstruction lead surgeon recommend delay reconstruction mastectomy use temporise implant view plan exchange autologous reconstruction radiotherapy . However , remain significant uncertainty literature impact radiotherapy autologous reconstruction . Initially , small case series support clinical bias radiotherapy detrimental autologous reconstruction , recently , large series challenge view . Each study flaw , underpowered , insufficient duration follow , report patient satisfaction measuring volume objectively residual question remain . A recent systematic review Kelley et al attempted address question related complication flap compromise result radiation delivery autologous breast reconstruction . The review analyse 20 article 1,500 flap reconstruction . No significant difference measurable postoperative complication include total flap loss , wound heal complication , infection , haematoma , seroma , fat necrosis find compare patient underwent PMRT autologous reconstruction . However , difference cosmetic outcome patient satisfaction irradiate unirradiated flap reconstruction group adequately address . The heterogeneity opinion literature impact radiotherapy make patient information decision-making difficult . It may detrimental effect radiotherapy outweigh term patient satisfaction benefit immediate reconstruction definitive reconstruction surgeon ' concern overvalue , yet upon anecdotal surgeon-reported outcome patient decision making base . In era breast cancer patient likely survive disease ( 85 % 5 year survival ) , physical psychological effect treatment , especially long term effect , relevant . A woman residual dissatisfaction reconstruct breast constant reminder disease treatment . Optimising reconstructive outcome major issue survivorship . Rationale Surgeons strive attain best possible reconstructive outcome aware effect radiotherapy autologous flap . They therefore often advise procedure may detrimental impact `` '' flap . However , patient perspective , delayed reconstruction treatment pathway prolong several month , year , require additional operation ( ) compare undergo immediate reconstruction PMRT . There remain significant uncertainty literature magnitude impact radiotherapy surgeon 's perspective little known patient ' preference term detrimental impact flap v effect prolong pathway life . By objectively assess irradiate autologous flap reconstruction compare unirradiated patient understand impact radiotherapy autologous flap . By quantify difference patient satisfaction , understand perspective patient PMRT immediate delay reconstruction understand impact pathways life , reconstruction satisfaction result . This , believe , enable clinician well inform patient , empower decision-making best timing breast reconstruction potentially enable woman undergo immediate definitive breast reconstruction DIEP flap . We intend enrol patient undergone unilateral mastectomy DIEP reconstruction . Patients fall one four possible group depend decision make surgeon patient pre-operatively . Patient group : 1 . Unilateral skin spar mastectomy ( SSM ) immediate DIEP flap reconstruction PMRT ( case ) 2 . Unilateral SSM immediate DIEP flap reconstruction PMRT ( control ) 3 . Unilateral simple mastectomy , PMRT , subsequent delay DIEP flap reconstruction ( control ) 4 . Unilateral SSM temporizing implant , PMRT subsequent conversion DIEP ( control ) The study conduct mixed method case control study use quantitative qualitative research method . Initially prospective study plan , however patient undergo delay reconstruction whole oncological reconstructive process take several year . Secondly number patient currently undergo radiotherapy DIEP breast reconstruction relatively small . For reason decide truly prospective study would practical prospective data collection recent cohort patient would yield great study population .</detailed_description>

Women unable complete English language questionnaire interview ( i.e . learn difficulty patient adequate English language skill ) .</criteria>
