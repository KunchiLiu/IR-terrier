	<brief_summary>Based need improve progression-free survival ( PFS ) overall survival ( OS ) post autologous stem cell transplant ( SCT ) DLBCL , hematopoietic profile patient follow auto-SCT , activity blinatumomab DLBCL favorable toxicity profile , investigator propose pilot study test blinatumomab consolidation therapy post auto-SCT patient DLBCL . The investigator hypothesize blinatumomab consolidation optimize effector target ( E-T ) ratio aid eradication remain tumor cell , lead decreased relapse increase overall survival . In addition , since tumor burden minimum , infusional toxicity include neurologic toxicity may also limit . The purpose pilot study study feasibility tolerability blinatumomab consolidation post auto-SCT patient chemo-sensitive DLBCL undergo auto-SCT .</brief_summary>
