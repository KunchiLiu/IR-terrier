	<detailed_description>1 . The overall purpose treatment offer alternative treatment child develop parenteral nutrition-associated liver disease ( PNALD ) respond positively currently available medical therapy . PNALD develop newborns dependent parenteral nutrition ( PN ) unable tolerate adequate enteral feeding support fluid nutritional fluid ; although PN necessary life sustaining , result severe liver disease . The investigator want see form intravenous fat mixture , Omegaven , help treatment child PNALD . Experimental data show intravenous fat mixture ( Intralipid ) currently use part newborn PN , may contribute liver disease . Omegaven different fat mixture manufacture use Europe adult . It different make highly refined fish oil , Intralipid make soybean . Case control study , randomize clinical trial , show Omegaven may reverse treat PNALD . Since Omegaven currently approve use United States , treatment IND obtain Food Drug Administration ( FDA ) . 2 . Feeding intolerance common pathway broad array medical surgical disease state encounter neonatal population . Consequently , high percentage patient neonatal intensive care unit ( NICU ) need rely PN survive grow . Through decade research development PN great success use maintain countless patient sufficient nutritional status recover medical surgical condition . However , one complication PN remain poorly understood still cause considerable morbidity mortality PNALD . There wide variety case scenario PNALD . There scenario newborn suffer irrecoverable bowel loss process ( e.g. , necrotizing enterocolitis totalis , mid gut volvulus ) consequently require long term PN await bowel transplant ; result almost always also require liver transplant secondary PNALD . This delay surgery wait two organ instead one ( Chungfat , Dixler et al . 2007 ) . More commonly , case involve patient prolong bowel dysfunction require long term use PN slowly recover gradually transition enteral feed . For infant race bowel recovery PNALD progression often decide whether patient live dy . 3 . Although etiology PNALD poorly understand likely multi-factorial ( Steinbach , Clark et al . 2008 ) , recent animal research human case study suggest alter dose composition lipid component PN might alter course PNALD ( Alwayn , Gura et al . 2005 ; Gura , Parsons et al . 2005 ; Gura , Duggan et al . 2006 ; Gura , Lee et al . 2008 ) . The lipid product use PN United States derive soy oil ; brand use Cardinal Glennon Children 's Hospital Intralipid® . Soy-based PN lipid rich omega-6 FA also contain small amount omega-3 FA form linolenic acid precursor . The potential toxicity omega-6 fatty acid relate PNALD recently reveal ( Diamond , Sterescu et al . 2008 ; de Meijer , Gura et al 2009 ) . This FA composition sufficient prevent essential FA deficiency ( EFAD ) , historically measure ratio specific omega-6 FA blood ( Gura , Lee et al 2009 ) . In published article ( Gura , Duggan et al . 2006 ) report 2 case depth subsequent paper ( Gura , Lee et al . 2008 ) report 18 patient establish PNALD require continued PN , investigator replace standard soy base lipid component PN fish oil derive parenteral lipid ( Omegaven™ ) contain high percentage ( 30 60 % ) omega-3 FA . This therapy , still experimental United States , associate gradual ultimately profound correction PNALD indicate laboratory marker conjugate bilirubin circulate liver enzyme ; median time reduce serum direct bilirubin &gt; 2mg/dl &lt; 2mg/dl 9.4 week . No significant adverse effect Omegaven™ dose utilized identify . The current study identify infant PNALD moderate severity worse , define two consecutive measurement direct bilirubin 3 mg/dL PN &gt; 3 week anticipate require PN another 3 week , put risk progression PNALD . For inclusion , cause liver disease must rule . Upon meet entry criterion , infant family offer , Institutional Review Board ( IRB ) approve consent process , treatment protocol infant successfully apply cite clinical case detail . Monitoring side effect , complication disease progression regression institute . Therapy stop direct bilirubin &lt; 1 mg/dL 2 weekly measurement patient tolerate enough enteral nutrition PN longer need . Clinical laboratory monitor continue 2 week post Omegaven™ infusion indicate event thereafter . Additional endpoint criterion : patient receive transplant ; AST/ALT , GGTP , C-reactive protein albumin , mortality , infection rate type , frequency red blood cell transfusion ; infant worsens treatment tolerate treatment Omegaven , specifically adverse event severe uncontrolled bleeding list risk section .</detailed_description>
