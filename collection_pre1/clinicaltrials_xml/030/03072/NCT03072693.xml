	<brief_summary>Background : Despite advance pharmacological management heart failure ( HF ) , associate mortality re-hospitalization HF remain poor . This least partly due suboptimal early discharge care , delay detection HF complication , underutilization under-dosing evidence-based HF medication . Mobile technology revolutionize inter-personal communication allow instantaneous , multi-directional , massive data transfer . Nonetheless potential enhance communication fully explore management patient HF . Objective : To explore potential state-of-the-art mobile technology home-based remote HF management order reduce HF mortality HF re-hospitalization . Study Design : This multicenter , randomize control clinical trial patient HF reduce leave ventricular ejection fraction ( LVEF ) discharge hospital follow episode acutely decompensated HF . The clinical effectiveness physician-directed patient self-management strategy base remotely collected physiological data obtain home-based wearable device compare two control group receive home-based remote HF management system without activation routine therapy . In interventional arm , three mode home-based HF management : ( 1 ) Early discharge mode optimize volume status ; ( 2 ) Drug escalation mode ensure utilization evidence-based medication maximum tolerate dose ; ( 3 ) Maintenance mode ensure medication compliance early detection complication acutely decompensated HF atrial fibrillation . The trial enroll 876 patient LVEF &lt; 40 % discharge hospital episode acutely decompensated HF . Randomization intervention group control group 1:1:1 ratio follow-up 1 year . The primary outcome composite cardiovascular death HF hospitalization within 1 year . Summary : DAVID-HF provide essential information role home-based , remote heart failure monitor incorporate instantaneous physician-directed patient-self management long-term management HF patient .</brief_summary>
