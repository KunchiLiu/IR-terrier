The standard method position acetabular component surgeon guide combination visible anatomical landmark within surgical field , wider environment operating theatre . The advent 3D printing lead development custom-made surgical guide use surgery , order assist surgeon position instrument device . These surgical guide manufacture base CT MRI imaging , design clearly indicate surgeon desire location orientation bony cut implant position . This study test hypothesis acetabular alignment guide combine three-dimensional CT-based planning use Corin OPS™ ( Optimised Positioning System ) , provide accurate component alignment follow primary total hip replacement compare current standard treatment , aim improve patient outcome reduce risk complication total hip replacement .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Total hip replacement one successful surgical procedure modern time , 80,000 perform year UK . The vast majority patient experience dramatic pain relief improvement function many year . Despite , however , remain significant risk complication , include dislocation , leg length discrepancy , squeak , premature wear failure implant . It known complication likely occur acetabular component incorrectly position surgery . Up 5 % primary hip replacement need revise within first 10 year , many case malposition acetabular ( hip socket ) component implicate early failure . The Corin OPS™ offer custom-made acetabular alignment guide . Prior patient 's surgery , CT scan patient 's pelvis &amp; leg perform , image use produce 3D computer model patient stand `` virtual '' hip replacement place . Four additional X-rays pelvis lumbar spine also take , patient adopt various predetermine `` functional '' position ( e.g . sit chair , stand ) . From X-rays , change pelvic femoral orientation measure functional position . This data use drive simulation movement 3D computer model . The orientation component virtual hip replacement adjust optimise biomechanical function joint . Once propose implant position review approve surgeon , custom-made acetabular orientation guide 3-D print sterilised . During surgery , guide fit patient 's acetabulum prior implant component . Using simple system two sterile laser pointer , orientation indicate guide reproduce definitive acetabular component implant . There publish data , however , accuracy acetabular component position use particular method . The standard care UK acetabular component position `` freehand technique '' , surgeon guide combination visible anatomical landmark within surgical field , wider environment operating theatre . It important impact acetabular guide acetabular component position assessed order determine whether intervention likely improve patient outcomes reduce risk complication total hip replacement .</detailed_description>
