	<brief_summary>Background : Medullary thyroid cancer ( MTC ) tumor thyroid gland . Surgery current treatment cure . The drug pembrolizumab ( MK-3475 ) new type cancer therapy . It work allow immune system detect kill tumor cell . Objective : To test pembrolizumab affect people MTC offer clinical benefit . Eligibility : People age 18 old MTC Patients recurrent metastatic MTC , surgery curative option Patients image evidence MTC Patients minimal symptom relate MTC Design : Participants screen : - Medical history - Physical exam - Blood , urine , heart test - CT scan MRI : They lie machine take picture body . - Bone scan Participants put group base treatment history : - Group 1 immune stimulate cancer vaccine - Group 2 vaccine Participants receive study drug 30-minute IV infusion every 3 week . Treatment continue 2 year long tolerate disease get bad . Participants physical exam blood test day infusion . They CT bone scan every 3 month . Participants may save biopsy treatment start treatment . Participants final visit 3-4 week stop treatment . This include physical exam blood heart test . After study , participant join long-term follow-up study .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Background : - Anti PD1/PDL1 therapies clinical success minority unselected patient across multiple tumor type - While many question remain optimal PD1/PDL1 stain technique pre-select responder , less focus place optimize response broad cohort patient - Emerging preclinical clinical data support hypothesis strong immunologic response tumor microenvironment induces PDL1 expression tumor associate well clinical response anti-PD1/PDL1 therapy - Therapeutic cancer vaccine one strategy induce immunologic response tumor , thereby enhance PDL1 expression optimize clinical response across patient - Limited clinical data exist potential benefit sequential therapy therapeutic cancer vaccine follow PD1/PDL1 inhibition - This study explore role PD1 inhibition medullary thyroid cancer evaluate potential difference base previous vaccine therapy Objective : -The primary objective trial determine whether administer PD1 inhibitor patient medullary thyroid cancer permit modest fraction able experience 50 % great decline calcitonin level experience partial/complete response image Key Eligibility : - Patients great equal 18 year age evidence metastatic medullary thyroid cancer include disease evaluable bone , CT scan MRI - Must elevate calcitonin level great 40 pg/mL - Patients minimal disease related-symptoms ( minimal symptom include affect activity daily live pain require regularly schedule narcotic ) - ECOG 0-1 - Should autoimmune disease ; evidence immunocompromised ; serious inter-current medical illness - No brain metastasis , history seizure , encephalitis , multiple sclerosis - Patients previous history vandetanib cabozantinib treatment 28 day treatment ( patient discontinue treatment 28 day enrol ) Design : - This phase II , open label , single center clinical trial patient receive anti-PD1/PDL1 therapy pembrolizumab - Patients enroll one two cohort : patient previous vaccine therapy patient without previous vaccine therapy - All patient TKI -na ( SqrRoot ) , minimal symptom ( consistent eligibility current study ) - Based calcitonin finding current study 30 patient , determine confirm calcitonin decline 50 % would rare finding , provide compel preliminary evidence clinical activity - A total 30 patient enrol propose study ( 15 patient cohort ) . Given already 30 patient study vaccine , would need identify recruit 15 na ( SqrRoot ) patient vaccine-naive cohort . This accrual could do 18 month base current accrual rate - Based metric , could &gt; 6 month calcitonin data 30 patient within 2 year trial initiation - Additional immune correlative capitalize extensive immune monitoring experience LTIB allow assessment antigen specific T-cells 123 immune subset . These finding could provide basis biomarker development take together biochemical clinical response see study</detailed_description>
