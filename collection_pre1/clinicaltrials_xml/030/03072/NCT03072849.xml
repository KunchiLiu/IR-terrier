	<brief_title>Early Detection Management Bronchiolitis Obliterans Syndrome Following Pediatric Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Bronchiolitis obliterans syndrome ( BOS ) inflammatory condition lung lead obstructive physiology , irreversible fibrosis terminal bronchiole , obliteration small airway . In child adult , prevalence BOS approximately 6 % chronic graft-vs-host disease ( cGVHD ) , although may gross underestimation give current diagnostic guideline . Once diagnose , prognosis extremely unfavorable . BOS carry mortality rate approximately 40-60 % , five year survival rate 13 % . Early , BOS symptomatically silent . Once symptoms present , high likelihood irreversible disease regardless combination immune suppression use . Given circumstance , early diagnosis utmost importance , characterize isolated subclinical decline lung function . Recent study suggest early decline lung function pulmonary function test ( PFT ) may representative develop BOS . Due lack consistent screen diagnostic criterion , many patient evolve BOS elude timely diagnosis , thereby jeopardize chance survival . In response , several expert recommend frequent PFT screening modify , less stringent set diagnostic criterion goal establish early diagnosis timely intervention . Traditionally , treatment BOS include aggressive immunosuppression , leave patient risk life-threatening invasive infection , multi-system co-morbidities , threat lung transplantation . Recent study demonstrate early management agent inhaled corticosteroid ( ICS ) , macrolides , leukotriene receptor antagonist ( LTRA ) lead improvement lung function clinical symptom . This study aim evaluate utility frequent routine pulmonary surveillance pediatric patient undergone allogenic HSCT . Our prospective study design provide novel framework implementation standardize lung function screen every three month first two year follow HSCT . With , hypothesize standardized PFT screen improve diagnostic sensitivity allow early intervention patient evolve airway obstruction BO . This study also aim evaluate efficacy inhale fluticasone , azithromycin , montelukast ( FAM therapy ) management early airflow obstruction pediatric patient follow allogenic HSCT . Early airflow obstruction define pulmonary function test ( FEV1 decline â‰¥10 % predict FVC &lt; 0.8 ) . With , hypothesize FAM therapy attenuate progression airflow obstruction improve lung function irreversible airflow obstruction one two year compare historical control .</detailed_description>
