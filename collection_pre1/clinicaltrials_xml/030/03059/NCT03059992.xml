	<brief_title>Open-Label Study Evaluate Efficacy Safety SCY-078 Patients With Refractory Intolerant Fungal Diseases</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This multicenter , open label , non-comparator , single arm study evaluate efficacy safety SCY-078 patient ≥ 18 year age document invasive and/or severe fungal disease intolerant refractory ( rIFI ) Standard Care ( SoC ) antifungal treatment . Patients treat SCY-078 90 day . Subjects must prove probable fungal disease meet study criterion consider enrollment . Eligible subject must also document evidence failure , intolerance , toxicity relate currently approve SoC antifungal treatment . Subjects also consider enrollment eligible fungal disease , judgement investigator , subject receive approve oral antifungal option ( e.g . susceptibility organism risk drug-drug interaction ) continue IV antifungal therapy desirable feasible due clinical logistical circumstance . Following screen visit , 11 treatment visit , follow-up visit 2 follow-up contact .</detailed_description>

An invasive fungal disease CNS , cardiac eye involvement . 2 . A life expectancy &lt; 3 day . 3 . Subjects know estimated creatinine clearance &lt; 20 mL/min Cockroft Gault . Estimated creatinine clearance = [ ( 140age ) x weight Kg ] / [ 72x serum creatinine mg/dL ) [ x 0.85 female ] . Subjects undergoing dialysis . 4 . Subject abnormal liver test parameter : aspartate aminotransferase ( AST ) , alanine aminotransferase ( ALT ) &gt; 10 x upper limit normal ( ULN ) , and/or total bilirubin &gt; 5 x ULN . Patients unconjugated hyperbilirubinemia diagnosis Gilbert 's disease exclude . 5 . There inappropriate fungal infection source control e.g. , persistent catheter , device , identify abscess likely source fungal infection . 6 . Subject hemodynamically unstable and/or require vasopressor medication blood pressure support . 7 . Subject require treatment prohibited medication . 8 . Subject know hypersensitivity SCY078 drug study . 9 . Subject &lt; 500 absolute neutrophil per mL baseline . NOTE : Patients absolute neutrophil count ( ANC ) &lt; 500/mm3 receive GCSF allow enroll patient expect recover severe neutropenia ( ANC &lt; 500/mm3 ) 3 5 day start GCSF treatment patient expect meet inclusion/exclusion criterion time reevaluation . 10 . Subject pregnant lactating . 11 . Subject use investigational drug within 30 day prior baseline visit . 12 . Any condition laboratory abnormality , judgment investigator , would put subject unacceptable risk participation study may interfere assessment include study . 13 . Prolonged QTc ( Fridericia 's correction : QTc = QT/RR0.33 ) &gt; 480 finding baseline ECG abnormality deem clinically significant investigator would put subject unacceptable risk participation study .</criteria>
