	<brief_summary>The purpose study determine peak plasma bupivacaine concentration similar fashion PECS I/II block . The investigator hypothesis mean peak plasma level patient undergo PECS I/II block less level report cause early neurotoxicity [ 2.2 ( 0.9 ) micrograms/ml ] 6 patient receive intravenous bupivacaine infusion .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>PECS Block : Plasma Bupivacaine Level</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Regional anesthesia technique common modality use provide analgesia follow upper low extremity surgery . It also often used truncal procedure purpose . A relatively new truncal block , first described 2012 Blanco , call pectoralis nerve block ( PECS I II block ) use successfully breast surgery1-3 . Despite description success clinical practice , extent systemic absorption truncal plane block describe date . However , study publish British Journal Anesthesia , do another truncal plane block , transverse abdominus plane ( TAP ) block local anesthetic note peak mean total concentration ropivacaine occur 30 minute block4 . During study , sample take 10 , 20 , 30 , 45 , 60 , 90 , 120 , 180 , 240 minute . The investigator anticipate since similar truncal plane block , absorption comparable term time . However , concentration drug absorbed may different give proximity rib , intercostal thoracic vasculature , high concentration local give small plane local anesthetic spread . Given investigator want find peak curve peak concentration bupivacaine PECS block , investigator feel need 5 sample time outline . This number sample choose approximate study publish 2004 ten subject receive ropivacaine scalp block serum ropivacaine level measure 15 , 30 , 45 , 60 , 90 , 120 minutes5 . The investigator feel 120 minute measurement well beyond peak plasma level bupivacaine give finding TAP scalp study . Therefore , investigator collect follow sample time block complete : 5 , 10 , 20 , 40 , 60 , 90 minute . The purpose study determine peak plasma bupivacaine concentration similar fashion PECS I/II block . The investigator hypothesis mean peak plasma level patient undergo PECS I/II block less level report cause early neurotoxicity [ 2.2 ( 0.9 ) micrograms/ml ] 6 patient receive intravenous bupivacaine infusion .</detailed_description>
