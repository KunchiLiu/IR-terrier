	<brief_title>Functional Follow-up After Single Event Multilevel Surgery Children Spastic Diplegic Cerebral Palsy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>1 . Introduction Cerebral palsy ( CP ) common physical disability prevalence two three per 1000 living birth . Cerebral palsy define group permanent disorder development movement posture , cause activity limitation contribute non-progressive disturbance occur develop fetal infant brain . The motor disorder often accompany disturbance sensation , perception , cognition , communication behavior , epilepsy secondary musculoskeletal problem . Cerebral palsy impact body function performance daily life activity may affect child 's independence , participation quality life . The impact cerebral palsy individual varies widely . The SCPE describe hierarchical classification tree cerebral palsy subtypes : spastic CP , dyskinetic CP ataxic CP . Spastic CP common type see 85 % child CP . The Gross Motor Function Classification System ( GMFCS ) classify child adolescent cerebral palsy five level basis functional ability sit walking . Further subdivision make accord topographical distribution i.e . hemiplegia , diplegia quadriplegia . Howard et al . report group 323 child spastic cerebral palsy 35 % child hemiplegia , 28 % diplegia 37 % quadriplegia . In study GMFCS level spastic diplegic cerebral palsy 33 % GMFCS I , 33 % GMFCS II , 28 % GMFCS III 5 % GMFCS IV . This mean nearly spastic diplegic patient ability walk without assistive device . A multidisciplinary follow-up necessary growth child CP . A good knowledge normal developmental milestone natural history child CP important detect prevent early problematic situation . In normal development period early childhood characterize rapid development locomotor skill walk , run stair climb . Typically develop child learn skill walk age eight eighteen month . Children learn talk , start potty train start develop independence self-care skill . Achieving independence dressing may take four year . Tying shoelace complete clothing fastener achieve age six year . During time , parent gradually perform few task , encourage child , ultimate goal independence . In comparison typically develop child , child spastic diplegic CP show delay milestone generally stand eighteen month walk independently four year . In self-care domain , half child cerebral palsy need help supervision area grooming , bathing , dress , toileting . The gross motor function function self-care skill steadily improve . At age nine year child spastic diplegic CP reach maximum functional potential . Ã–hrvall et al . describe many child CP achieve independence later age typically develop child . They report child high functioning level GMFCS Manual Ability Classification System ( MACS ) could achieve good functional performance self-care mobility age 12 year . For child GMFCS MACS level III minor development functional skill see age , although task-orientated goal-directed therapy improve functioning . Despite improvement self-care age , several study report gait pattern child CP deteriorating . Due increase muscle tone weakness child spastic diplegic CP walk hip knee flexion , inward rotation toe walking , hereby secondary problem like muscle contracture bony deformity slowly arise . Further adolescent year 's rapid growth increase body weight lead worsen deformity change ratio body mass strength . Decrease ratio negative effect gait pattern . Orthopedic surgery aim counteract effect natural history prevent deterioration maintain function keep child ambulant . Instead perform several single level surgery childhood - birthday syndrome approach - modern approach aim correct muscle imbalance bone deformity time . The latter approach call single event multilevel surgery ( SEMLS ) ensure one admission hospital one rehabilitation period . SEMLS uniform procedure tailor child 's need lengthen shorten muscle-tendon unit realign bony lever . In University Hospital Pellenberg , botulinum toxin frequently apply simultaneously reduce spasticity . Botox treatment surgical treatment must see complementary rather exclusive . They deliver benefit normal alignment make optimal rehabilitation possible . In addition successful outcome multilevel surgery require intensive train least one year follow surgery . Important rehabilitation goal improvement range motion , strength , balance function . Several study investigate effect SEMLS . Two study identify loss muscle strength post SEMLS . Seniorou et al . report muscle strength reach pre-operative status one year SEMLS . It show multilevel surgery corrects musculoskeletal pathology significantly improve gait pattern . In study Thomason et al . result maintain five year surgery . However important goal child parent achieve good gait pattern also obtain improved functionality daily life . Mc Ginley et al . Graham et al . stress importance longterm study multidimensional outcome measure domains International Classification Functioning , Disability Health ( ICF ) . There lack study focus impact SEMLS activity level like self-care functional mobility . Still information outcome important child parent undertaken intervention . After SEMLS intensive rehabilitation period require high physical mental demand long lasting rehabilitation process could strenuous child parent . Insufficient information post-surgery period could lead frustration parent child . A longitudinal study measure functional mobility daily life activity SEMLS use Functional Mobility Scale ( FMS ) . Harvey et al.reported group 66 child spastic diplegic CP deterioration three six month post-surgery , follow improvement back baseline status one year improvement two year post-surgery . Another study nine child spastic diplegic CP show one year SEMLS differences FMS . Children study underwent also bony foot surgery part SEMLS . In follow-up study Thomason et al . nearly half child improve distance 50 500 five year post-surgery . In study 19 child spastic diplegic CP child deteriorate three distance FMS . Only two study report effect SEMLS domain self-care skill . Buckon et al . compare evolution self-care selective dorsal rhizotomy ( SDR ) SEMLS use PEDI 25 child spastic diplegia ( 18 SDR , 7 SEMLS ) . The SDR group show significant gain self-care skill six month , one year two year . The SEMLS group demonstrate gain six month post-surgery . However one two year post SEMLS significant increase self-care skill find . For caregiver assistance two year post-surgery significant decrease amount assistance . Another study Gorton et al . 75 child spastic CP ( GMFCS I III ) report significant gain score Pediatric Functional Independence Measure ( WeeFIM ) one year post SEMLS . Also study use Quality life ( QOL ) measure SEMLS . Two study report improvement functional well-being one two year SEMLS . However psychosocial emotional wellbeing remain unchanged . Weak relationship function psychosocial domains QOL previously report Shelly et al . The study Himpens et al . use CP QOL show child CP SEMLS report high quality life compare parent report . In summary , paucity study set study effect outcomes gross motor functional skill , activity daily live functional skill quality life . Nevertheless necessary examine patient gait laboratory also context daily life . Previous study short follow-up . There base small sample size child different type CP . Further study clearly need provide insight short- mid- longterm evolution self-care functional mobility follow SEMLS . Furthermore , knowledge factor influence evolution particular interest . Several CP relate , personal environmental characteristic may determine evolution follow surgery . The understanding association functional outcome SEMLS potential influencing factor aid set realistic expectation appropriate treatment plan SEMLS . However , information influence factor outcome SEMLS limit . Svehlik et al . find good result follow SEMLS old child young child . The author hypothesize finished growth spurt probable good cooperation therapy old child may lead good outcome . As Hoffinger indicate result interpret cautiously . Both group retrospective study Svehlik et al . . The old child poor ambulation cause primarily bone deformity , young child muscle contracture muscle activation problem . Another study Zwick et al . suggest girl well outcomes boys . To date , limited personal characteristic like age gender investigate influencing factor , possible interfere factor like GMFCS en MACS level , number surgery initial level self-care functional mobility take account . The aim study investigate evolution self-care functional mobility different time point first year follow SEMLS assess determinant could identify influence time trend . Methods : This prospective longitudinal study 5 year follow-up period . This study report short-term , midterm longterm outcome , i.e . 2 , 6 , 12 , 24 , 36 60 month SEMLS . Outcome measure collect surgery ( time interval one month one day surgery ; T1 ) define interval surgery , 9 week ( T2 ) , 6 month ( T3 ) , 1 year ( T4 ) , 18 month ( T5 ) , 2 year ( T6 ) , 3 year ( T7 ) 5 year ( T8 ) . At moment participant complete follow-up 2 year . All 34 participant follow CP-reference center University Hospital Pellenberg . The surgical recommendation base participant ' need determine comprehensive evaluation , include standardized physical examination , radiographic evaluation instrumental gait analysis . All child adolescent hospitalize one week surgery University Hospital Pellenberg . One week post-surgery discharge wear plaster cast below-the-knee removable knee brace . Participants receive physiotherapy home ( five time week ) consist passive joint mobilization . Four week surgery participant hospitalize rehabilitation University Hospital Pellenberg rehabilitation center 'Pulderbos ' Zandhoven . Rehabilitation comprise intensive individualized physiotherapy include exercise programme two hour per day , two hour position ( stand table specific stretch position prone supine ) . The exercise programme consist strength train gait reeducation . Additionally , occupational therapy provide necessary ( three time week , 30-45 minute ) focus train upper limb function , transfer activity daily live ( eat , wash , groom , â€¦ ) . The rehabilitation period ( hospital Pellenberg rehab center Pulderbos ) range six twelve week . Children adolescent discharge rehabilitation unit independent walk kaye-walker possible . At home , rehabilitation continue private physiotherapist frequency five time week six month post-surgery . At six month frequency individually adopt accord need . The child attend special education school physiotherapy school combine private physiotherapy . The rehabilitation programme similar two involved centre . The Pediatric Evaluation Disability Inventory ( PEDI ) , Mobility Questionnaire47 ( MobQues47 ) , Functional Mobility Scale ( FMS ) Manual Muscle Testing ( MMT ) measure surgery surgery nine week , six month one year . The CP QOl Child measure SEMLS one , three five year follow surgery . All baseline assessment conduct hospital Pellenberg , assessment nine week surgery perform rehabilitation unit , i.e . Pellenberg Pulderbos . The following assessment take place follow-up consultation University Hospital Pellenberg . The assessor ( senior occupational therapist ) evaluate participant , support two junior physiotherapist . Clinical assessment practice jointly order standardize assessment procedure . Age , gender , intelligence type school , level Gross Motor Function Classification System ( GMFCS ) Manual Ability Classification System ( MACS ) collect surgery . Also surgical procedure botulinum injection document .</detailed_description>
