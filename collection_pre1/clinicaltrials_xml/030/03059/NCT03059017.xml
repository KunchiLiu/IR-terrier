	<detailed_description>In study , 20 healthy , non smoking , adult male volunteer ( age : 30-45 year , weight : 65-80 kg ) carry screen procedure include instruction practice placebo meter dose inhaler device use study . In addition , subject fully inform write objective implication trial . No subject consider study develop symptom allergic disorder . Subjects follow normal diet receive medication . Volunteers divide two group ; group contain 10 volunteer receive one formula select formula . Each volunteer inhale eight puff ( 4 puff -5 min &amp; 4 puff 0 min ) equivalent 0.8 mg salbutamol sulphate . To inhale meter dose inhaler , volunteer train exhale slowly residual volume ( far comfortable ) , put inhaler mouth seal lip round mouth piece . Then instruct take slow deep inspiration total lung capacity approximately 5-10 second . At end inhalation , hold breath 10 second breathe normally ( Ball et al , 2002 ) . Three milliliter blood withdrawn 0 , 0.5 , 1 , 2 , 3 , 4 , 5 6 h administration . The blood heparinized immediately centrifuged 3000 rpm 10 minute . The plasma sample store freeze temperature analysis . Two different formula compare first six hour follow administration . The maximum plasma concentration ( Cmax ) , time require reach maximum plasma concentration ( Tmax ) area plasma concentration time curve ( AUC ) calculate use validate Excel software .</detailed_description>
