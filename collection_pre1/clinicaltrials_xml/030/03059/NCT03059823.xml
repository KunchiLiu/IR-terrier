	<brief_summary>The primary goal Phase 1 study characterize safety tolerability MGA012 establish maximum tolerate dose ( MTD ) MGA012 administer either every two week every four schedule administration among patient solid tumor . Pharmacokinetics , pharmacodynamics , anti-tumor activity MGA012 also assess .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Phase 1 Study MGA012 Patients With Advanced Solid Tumors</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This open-label , multi-center , Phase 1 dose-escalation dose expansion study define MTD , describe preliminary safety , assess PK , immunogenicity , potential anti-tumor activity MGA012 administer either every two week every four week schedule patient relapsed/ refractory unresectable locally/ advance metastatic solid tumor . In initial phase study , two dose schedule assess dose escalation , every two week every four week administration single agent MGA012 . Following establishment MTD , additional patient enroll dose expansion cohort specific tumor type .</detailed_description>
