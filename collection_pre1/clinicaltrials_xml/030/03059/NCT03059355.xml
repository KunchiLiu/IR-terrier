	<brief_title>Intravenous Infusion Umbilical Cord Tissue ( UC ) Derived Mesenchymal Stem Cells ( MSCs ) Versus Bone Marrow ( BM ) Derived MSCs Evaluate Cytokine Suppression Patients With Chronic Inflammation Due Metabolic Syndrome .</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>In Study , cell administer via intravenous infusion ( IV ) test 37 patient two phase ( Pilot Randomized ) : The pilot phase consist 12 subject randomize phase consist 25 subject . Subjects pilot phase group ( Group 1 , 2 , 3 4 ) treat less 5 day apart undergo full evaluation post infusion demonstrate evidence treatment emergent SAE 's prior proceeding treatment subject . For subject randomize Group 3 , 4 , C D ( BMMSCs ) ; cell derive sample subject 's bone marrow ( obtain iliac crest aspiration ) approximately 4-6 week prior infusion . Duration Study Participation 12 month ( Follow-up 2 week , 1 Month , 3 , 6 , 12 month . )</detailed_description>
