	<brief_summary>Chemotherapy still constitute backbone small-cell lung cancer ( SCLC ) therapy , particularly extensive disease ( ED ) stage ( ED-SCLC ) . Despite fact substantial complete response rate could achieve SCLC patient receive etoposide - cisplatin doublet , cure remain exception . Overall survival patient receive combination 10 month progression free survival 6.3 month . At time progression two option hitherto accept : reinduction carboplatin - etoposide doublet , patient unfit reinduction , topotecan single-drug regimen . However , clinical case , median survival hardly achieve 33 week . Consistent data use anti - PDL1 ( Programmed death-ligand 1 ) anti PD1 ( program cell death 1 ) antibody suggest active single drug regimens many malignant disease . Taking account rich tumor infiltrate lymphocyte pathological specimen SCLC , hypothesize experimental use ATEZOLIZUMAB ( MPDL3280A ) patient ethical pending demonstrate activity second line setting .</brief_summary>
