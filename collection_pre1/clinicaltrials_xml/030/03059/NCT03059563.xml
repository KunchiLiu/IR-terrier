	<detailed_description>1 . Participants recruit Tarzana Treatment Center , reside residential substance use disorder program . Potential participant recently admit methamphetamine use disorder give flyer describe study , interested party meet research associate discus detail protocol sign inform consent form . Prior enrollment , screen initial eligibility criterion exclusion criterion . Participants provide write consent complete questionnaire mood , medical , psychiatric drug use history , personality life experience . They also give urine sample determine drug recently use , breath sample determine carbon monoxide level system , blood sample assess complete blood count , metabolic panel , screen infectious disease , test kidney function . This blood sample also use determine follicular luteal phase female participant . 2 . Consenting participant meet study physician additional screening . The study physician take medical history , take personal family health profile , perform physical examination , collect review laboratory test determine eligibility . 3 . Participants see least weekly follow-up throughout study via set self-report questionnaire , include Mini International Neuropsychiatric Interview ( MINI ) , Patient Health Questionnaire-9 , 4-Item Positive Symptom Rating Scale , Mood Disorder Questionnaire , International Physical Activity Questionnaire , side effect questionnaire . Urine sample exhale breath also collect follow-up visit . 4 . After complete screening procedure , eligible participant complete follow baseline assessment : A ) Visit 1 : . Structural magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) : High-resolution structural MRI scan brain Magnetization-Prepared Rapid Acquisition Gradient Echo obtain positron emission tomography ( PET ) scan confirm absence structural brain lesion aid localization volume interest . ii . Functional MRI ( fMRI ) : The purpose session collect information brain function activity participant engage cognitive task rest , account physiological variability . During scan , non-invasive physiological measurement , include respiration , pulse rate eye blink collect determine signal fMRI data related physiology . Resting state scan acquire examine functional connectivity brain region absence cognitive demand . Participants ask stare black screen . Participants ask smoke 15-30 minute prior fMRI scan . Participants may ask complete two three follow cognitive task scan environment : The Balloon Analog Risk Task ( BART ) : The BART measure risky decision making . During BART , participant must make series choice two option : inflate virtual balloon increase potential monetary gain ( $ 0.25/inflation ) inflate virtual balloon retain accrue earnings . Each time virtual balloon inflate , size value balloon increase balloon explodes participant earn money trial . The task administer one 10-minute session . Reversal Learning task ( RLT ) : Participants perform simple categorization task reversal stage . Participants learn make one two key-press response set abstract visual pattern ( e.g. , fractal pattern ) basis trial-by-trial feedback . Subjects view stimulus ( novel visual pattern ) must make key press . Immediately response , feedback appear screen : `` correct '' , `` incorrect '' , `` response record '' message response make within response window . Participants train stimuli vary number trial reversal phase . The reversal phase unbeknownst participant previously correct stimulus incorrect . Participants learn new pattern feedback . After task , participant may participate memory test picture saw RLT . Stop Signal Task ( SST ) : This task consist 256 trial ( 64 Stop trial ) . Each trial begin fixation dot appear center screen 500 millisecond ( m ) , follow target stimulus , `` O '' `` X '' , remain 2000ms . Participants instruct respond quickly possible leave key-press `` O '' right key-press `` X '' , try stop press target follow `` stop-signal '' tone ( 25 % trial ) . This signal present variable delay ( stop-signal delay ) , target stimulus appear . After successful Stop trial , stop-signal delay increase 50ms , fail Stop trial , decrease 50ms , eventually titrate stop-signal delay result ~50 % successful inhibition rate . 3 day prior fMRI visit , participant train task . B ) Visit 2 : . Prior complete behavioral task PET scan , participant visit Clinical Translational Research Center , register nurse draw approximately 20 milliliter ( mL ) blood . Blood sample test plasma level nicotine , cotinine , trans-3'-hydroxycotinine , well genetic marker associate smoke methamphetamine use . The DNA sample acquire protocol add large database DNA sample collect participant London Laboratory protocol . DNA sample store future use aim goal study . Participants receive result laboratory qualified genetic analysis associate research purpose certify clinical assessment genetic information . This blood sample also use determine follicular luteal phase female participant . ii . Cognitive/behavioral testing : Working memory ( N-back test ) , declarative memory ( Rey Auditory Verbal Learning Task ) , sustain attention ( Rapid Visual Information Processing ) , inhibitory control ( Stop Signal Test ) reward-based decision-making ( Monetary Delay Discounting Reversal Learning ) test day PET scan . iii . PET Scanning : A computed tomography transmission scan perform , administration radiopharmaceutical , obtain data measure attenuation correction . A dose [ 18F ] fallypride , approximately 5 millicurie ( mCi ) ( +/- 10 % error ) inject mass 1.82 microgram ( Î¼g ) ( +/- 10 % error ) , administer intravenous bolus injection . Dynamic scan start bolus injection . The first dynamic emission scan sequence take 80 min . The participant remove scanner 20-minute break . To reduce radiation-absorbed dose urinary bladder wall , participant instruct water load void break . A second 80-minute dynamic emission scan acquisition follow . 5 . Participants randomly assign varenicline ( VAR ) treatment placebo group Semel Institute Statistic Unit . The participant well experimenter administer PET scan cognitive test blind assigned treatment . Both condition require participant take capsule instruct course 3 week . Medications ( active placebo ) upcoming week dispense begin week . At end week , participant meet study physician check-up monitor potential adverse event . After 3-wk regimen ( VAR placebo ) , participant undergo repeat test PET measure behavioral test describe section 6 . On final day treatment , blood sample take assess plasma level VAR . 6 . After complete VAR treatment , participant complete follow assessment : A ) Visit 3 : . Structural MRI . As described Visit 1. ii . Functional MRI ( fMRI ) : As describe Visit 1 . B ) Visit 4 : .
