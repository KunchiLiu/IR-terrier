	<brief_summary>Young child know suspected heart disease frequently difficulty cooperate clinically order echocardiogram . Current distraction technique vary efficacy . There study examine use animal assist therapy improve echocardiogram quality completeness , well patient/parent experience . Hypotheses : 1 . The presence interaction therapy dog young child undergo echocardiography clinical set result complete high quality echocardiogram compare standard distraction technique . 2 . Parents report high visit satisfaction score great exam comfort child echocardiograms perform aid canine assist therapy compare use standard distraction technique . Study Activities Population Group : Pilot Phase : Introduction train therapy dog ( approve Pets Duke Therapy Program ) 10 echocardiograms observe canine-patient interaction determine best practice inclusion dog/handler team echocardiogram protocol . Study Phase : 150 subject ages select child age 1 5 year present clinically order echocardiogram study time period . Subjects assign one three group : 1 ) Canine assist therapy ; 2 ) Canine assist therapy plus standard distraction technique ; 3 ) Standard distraction technique . Echocardiography reviewer blind subject study group assign quality completeness score base validated criterion . Parental satisfaction assess use validated survey tool . Data analysis risk/safety issue : All subject assign random subject ID , link PHI store Duke Redcap database . Statistical test performed assistance Tracy Spears ( biostatistician DCRI ) assist development testing tool . There physical risk associate echocardiogram portion study , minimal risk therapy dog portion study . Please see `` Pets Duke '' policy include study document . There potential loss confidentiality , although link subject ID PHI store Duke Recap database .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Design Procedures : 160 study subject select child 1 5 year age present Duke University Pediatric Echocardiography Laboratory clinically order echocardiogram study period . Duke University Hospital establish program pet therapy ( https : //www.dukemedicine.org/treatments/cancer/cancer-support-services/pets-duke ) include bedside visit train certified therapy dog . At present , dog-handler team certify therapy dog , fulfill additional certification requirement order allow patient room . As program certification requirement already establish , project would able liaison Pets Duke program provide suitable dog-handler team study . Therapy dog certification require passage AKC Good Citizen Test well instruction certification recognize therapy dog program ( include North Carolina Pet Partners , Carolina Canines Service ) . Currently , dog ( breed ) certify therapy dog undergo evaluation team Duke University , appropriate , able perform lobby visit ( Level 2 dog ) bed/patient room visit ( Level 3 dog ) . Only Level 3 dog would include study . Data Collection : - Subject demographic ( age , ethnicity , gender , birth order , home ZIP code , city/rural designation ) - Presence type heart disease intervention , - Presence dog ( breed specify ) pet home , exposure animal - History traumatic canine experience ( fear , bite ) - Presence parental anxiety dog - Completeness echocardiogram base exist protocol QA document - Quality echocardiogram ( poor , average , good , excellent ) - Time require perform echocardiogram - Assessment echocardiogram complexity ( low , medium , high ) - Patient parental/guardian comfort satisfaction echocardiogram experience - Handler assessment dog comfort throughout echocardiogram - Handler assessment quality dog-subject interaction Echocardiography Data Echocardiography completeness , quality , time complexity assess either co-PI , blind subject group presence dog echocardiogram . - Echo completeness assess use numerical version exist protocol document use QA - Quality echocardiogram assess use qualitative scale derive publish pediatric echocardiography study - Time require perform echocardiogram measure time stamp first image time stamp last image , automatically display echo . Video Recording Therapy Dog Interaction Subject A video record therapy dog interaction subject perform . This video review part separate Duke University study investigate therapy dog behave around young child ( Duke IACUC Protocol A112-14-05 ) analyze part study . It likely image subject capture video , none subject 's protected health information subject ID number include video . No video recording release beyond therapy dog analysis . Timeline : The study break 4 distinct phase : 1 . Initial Phase ( 3 month ) : Medical team training inclusion study metric daily routine Duke University Hospital Pediatric Echocardiography Laboratory . 2 . Pilot phase ( 3 month ) : 1 . 10 non-randomized subject recruit match dog-handler team 2 . Through observation dog-handler-child behavior suggest intervention , list technique develop use main study . This extension knowledge gain patient visit perform therapy dog setting within Duke Hospital . . Suggested intervention may include , limited : dog lie next child bed , child practice rest hand dog , demonstrate probe placement dog prior placement child c. The behavior rat helpful sonographers dog handler select list technique select consistent use main study . 3 . Study phase ( 12 month ) 1 . Subjects approach participation randomize study group outline 2 . Study data collect outlined 4 . Data analysis manuscript submission ( 12 month )</detailed_description>
