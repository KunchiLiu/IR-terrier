	<brief_summary>The objective : 1. validate panel tissue-specific miRNAs differentially express plasma patient without multiple organ failure . 2. investigate dysregulation circulate miRNA panel prognostic predictive value clinical outcome identify patient high risk mortality multiple organ failure . This trial involve peripheral blood sample subject early presentation remain stay hospitalization emergency department . The investigator develop panel miRNAs specific indicator early onset major organ failure , correlate clinical outcome miRNAs .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The ICU patient multiple organ failure sponsor 's institute enrol observational cohort investigation . Whole blood sample separate immediately plasma storage . The participant 2nd 3rd sample obtain 24-48 hour 48-72 hour respectively . The schedule sample schedule design concordance ICU routines avoid extra burden patient . The plasma sample use prognostic marker prognostic predictive value identify patient high risk mortality multiple organ failure . Patients discharge tracked clinical recurrence disease every 28 day assess diagnostic accuracy miRNA biomarkers measure . The 2nd objective assess measure concentration miRNAs normal patient without multiple organ failure . The circulate miRNAs detect directly 1 - 5 ul plasma sample miRFLP assay . This capillary electrophoresis-based miRNA quantification method detect multiple miRNAs absolute copy number small sample signature negligible batch batch variation , thus provide standard miRNA detection method .</detailed_description>
