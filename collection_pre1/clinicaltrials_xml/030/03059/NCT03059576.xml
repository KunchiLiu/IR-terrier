	<brief_summary>The purpose investigation assess role genetic environmental factor circadian system , free living condition use female twin population . With result study , investigator expect advance understanding role endogenicity circadian system variable temperature , activity , sleep timing food intake main cause coincidence rhythm . However , investigator expect parameter still dependent environment relevant extent , hence , amenable change external intervention .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Twin study classic analysis relative contribution genetic environmental factor behavior phenotype . These model often use separate genetic environmental cause family resemblance methodology . These model base twin previously carry chronobiology . In fact , year 1993 1994 , Paul Linkowski et al. , perform two relevant study circadian system analyze relative contribution hereditary and/or environmental factor cortisol secretion blood pressure , respectively , conclude genetic factor control characteristic cortisol diastolic blood pressure circadian rhythmicity . The heritability circadian marker also demonstrate morningness- eveningness ( 44 % ) , sleep-related variable also point relevant role genetics heritability estimate sleep duration 17 % 55 % . However , investigator knowledge , heritability relevant chronobiological marker , measure free living condition body temperature , actigraphy sleep study . These goal achieve specific approach : - Observational ( Aim 1 ) : To study potential effect genetic environmental factor circadian system health order improve chronobiological therapy clinical practice ( n=106 ) .</detailed_description>
