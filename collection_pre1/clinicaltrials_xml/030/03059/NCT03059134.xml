	<detailed_description>Introduction Overactive bladder syndrome ( OAB ) define symptom syndrome frequency , urgency without urgency incontinence . OAB affect 400 million people worldwide estimate affect around 16 % adult population across Europe USA . In Asian country , prevalence OAB report 6 % men woman age ≥18 year China ; 12.2 % men woman Korea ; 12.4 % men woman age ≥40 year Japan ; 21 25 % woman 16.9 % community dwell adult Taiwan . Another study report prevalence OAB among adult men across 11 Asian country ( India , Indonesia , Malaysia , Pakistan , Philippines , Singapore , South Korea , Taiwan , China , Hong Kong Thailand ) 29.9 % . Antimuscarinics first line pharmacotherapy OAB . However , patient suboptimal response antimuscarinics may experience adverse effect , dry mouth constipation . Therefore , high proportion patient discontinue antimuscarinic therapy , few 25 % remain treatment 1 year . There unmet need develop new drug OAB without bothersome adverse effect antimuscarinic agent . β3-adrenergic receptor know promote urine storage bladder induce detrusor relaxation animal human bladder . In human , β3-adrenoceptor predominant β-receptor subtype urinary bladder . β3-adrenoceptor agonist relax detrusor smooth muscle bladder storage phase increase bladder capacity without accompany change micturition pressure , residual volume void contraction . Mirabegron first β3-adrenoceptor agonist approve treatment OAB . Pooled safety data indicate dry mouth , chief cause treatment discontinuation antimuscarinic agent , occurs low incidence mirabegronc . Hence , mirabegron may valuable treatment option patient OAB . Recent phase III trial confirm efficacy safety mirabegron treatment OAB Europeans , Australians , North Americans , Japanese Asians . Whether mirabegron use first line treatment OAB determine yet . There also study show mirabegron superior solifenacin term therapeutic efficacy safety profile . The dose effectiveness relationship 25mg 50mg mirabegron also investigate yet . Hence , conduct post marketing study order evaluate efficacy safety mirabegron Taiwanese people symptom OAB . Materials Methods Study design participant This prospective , randomized trial conduct Tzu Chi General Hospital , Hualien , Taiwan . The study population consist male female outpatient meet legal minimum age requirement region symptom OAB 3 month . Patient demographic data record detailed possible , include previous urodynamic study result . The study consist four arm : 1 . Mirabegron 25mg once-daily 4 week , continue dose mirabegron another 8 week 2 . Mirabegron 25mg once-daily 4 week , increase dose 50mg another 8 week 3 . Mirabegron 25mg once-daily 4 week , shift solifenacin 5mg another 8 week 4 . Mirabegron 25mg once-daily 4 week , add-on solifenacin 5mg another 8 week , Randomization accomplish use computer-generated randomization scheme ( Cenduit GmbH , Allshwil , Switzerland ) stratification site ; allocation treatment group site accomplish via interactive response system study coordinator . Study visit take place Week 0 ( Visit 1 ; confirmation eligibility criterion ) ; Weeks 4 , 8 12 ( Visits 2 , 3 4 ) . The study approve institutional review board study site conduct accordance ethical principle origin Declaration Helsinki , Good Clinical Practice , International Conference Harmonisation guideline , applicable law regulation . The sample size study base result 12-week dose-finding Phase II study ( 178-CL-045 ; NCT00527033 ) conduct Japan . In study , mean decrease urgency episodes per 24 hour mirabegron 50mg group 2.24 . The primary efficacy end-point study percentage patient change baseline final visit urgency episodes per 24 hour 2 great . The number patient per group necessary demonstrate superiority first group ( mirabegron 25mg 12 week ) would 263 effect size 0.2 , two-sided significance level 5 % power 90 % . Assuming dropout rate 15 % treatment period , 302 subject per group enrol randomization . The result study provide evidence sup [ eriority medicatyion combination pharmacotherapy treatment patient overactive bladder syndrome . We also expect search predictive factor responder mirabegron 25mg alone , mirabegron 50mg , solifenacin alone , combine mirabegron 25mg slifenacin 5mg , base baseline demographic urodynamic study finding</detailed_description>
