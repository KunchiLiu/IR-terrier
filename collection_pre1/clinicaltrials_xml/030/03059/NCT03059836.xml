	<detailed_description>Biological age associated loss skeletal muscle mass strength result compromise metabolic function mobility . Throughout life , individual also experience period reduce physical activity/muscle disuse independently low muscle mass strength accelerate age process . The loss muscle mass age disuse underpin feeding-induced decline rate muscle protein synthesis . Thus , strategy enhance muscle protein synthesis could clinical implication wish maintain metabolic health function time muscle disuse . Supplementation n3 PUFA-enriched fish oil show potentiate rate muscle protein synthesis response simulate feeding young old adult . Fish oil supplementation also efficacious enhance skeletal muscle strength period resistance exercise training . However , study examine impact fish oil supplementation enhance muscle protein synthesis offset decline muscle mass/strength period immobilization .</detailed_description>
