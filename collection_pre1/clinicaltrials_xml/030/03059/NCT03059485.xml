	<brief_summary>This research study study cancer vaccine call Dendritic Cell/AML Fusion vaccine ( DC/AML vaccine ) possible treatment Acute Myelogenous Leukemia ( AML ) . The intervention involve study : - Dendritic Cell/AML Fusion vaccine ( DC/AML vaccine ) - Durvalumab</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>DC/AML Fusion Cell Vaccine v DC/AML Fusion Cell Vaccine Plus Durvalumab vs Observation Patients Who Achieve Chemotherapy-induced Remission</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This research study Phase II clinical trial . Phase II clinical trial test safety effectiveness investigational intervention learn whether intervention work treat specific disease . `` Investigational '' mean intervention study . The FDA ( U.S. Food Drug Administration ) approve DC/AML vaccine treatment disease . The FDA ( U.S. Food Drug Administration ) approve durvalumab treatment AML . In research study , investigator determine DC/AML vaccine use safely subject acute leukemia finish chemotherapy , whether DC/AML vaccine capable produce immune response leukemia alone combination Durvalumab . Cancer cell foreign body unique marker distinguish normal cell . These marker potentially serve target immune system . An immune response reaction immune system ; complex system responsible distinguish u everything foreign u , protect u infection foreign substance . The Dendritic Cell Fusion Vaccine investigational agent try help immune system recognize fight cancer cell . Unlike standard vaccine use prevent infection , cancer vaccine study see fight cancer already body . Laboratory study show dendritic cell tumor cell bring together , dendritic cell stimulate immune response tumor , case , cause tumor shrink . Durvalumab check point inhibitor combine amplify immune activity vaccine . It monoclonal antibody , know take brake immune system restore immunity . In study , investigator add Durvalumab combination vaccine hope improve immunity even .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Step 1 : Eligibility Criteria Tumor Collection Inclusion Criteria Patients must AML initial diagnosis first relapse Patients must ≥ 55 year old ECOG performance status ≤2 ( Appendix A ) Patients must normal organ marrow function define : total bilirubin ≤ 2.0 mg/dL AST ( SGOT ) /ALT ( SGPT ) ≤3 × institutional upper limit normal creatinine ≤ 2.0 mg/dl The effect DC/AML fusion cell Durvalumab develop human fetus unknown . For reason , woman childbearing potential men must agree use adequate contraception ( hormonal barrier method birth control ; abstinence ) prior study entry duration study participation . Should woman become pregnant suspect pregnant participating study , inform treat physician immediately . Ability understand willingness sign write informed consent document . Exclusion Criteria Active prior document autoimmune inflammatory disorder include limited following : GI Disorders : ( include inflammatory bowel disease [ eg , ulcerative colitis , Crohn 's disease ] , diverticulitis ( exception prior episode resolve ) , celiac disease , serious gastrointestinal chronic condition associate diarrhea . Systemic lupus erythematosus Wegener 's syndrome [ granulomatosis polyangiitis ] Myasthenia gravis Graves ' disease Rheumatoid arthritis Hypophysitis Uveitis The following exception criterion : subject vitiligo alopecia ; subject hypothyroidism ( eg , follow Hashimoto syndrome ) stable hormone replacement ; subject psoriasis require systemic treatment.. Because compromise cellular immunity , patient Known human immunodeficiency virus ( HIV ) , hepatitis C virus ( HCV ) evidence active hepatitis B virus ( HBV ) . Patients must significant cardiac disease characterize symptomatic congestive heart failure , unstable angina pectoris , clinically significant cardiac arrhythmia Patients must pregnant . All premenopausal patient undergo pregnancy test . Men agree father child protocol treatment . Men woman practice effective birth control receive protocol treatment . Individuals history different malignancy ineligible except follow circumstance . Individuals history malignancy eligible diseasefree least 5 year deem investigator low risk recurrence malignancy . Individuals follow cancer eligible diagnose treat within past 5 year : noninvasive cancer ( , situ cancer ) basal cell squamous cell carcinoma skin . Step 2 : Eligibility Criteria Prior Randomization Inclusion Criteria Patients must obtain complete remission chemotherapy define absence circulating blast , le 5 % blast bone marrow examination follow hematopoietic recovery Resolution chemotherapy relate grade IIIIV toxicity per CTC criterion 4.0 Laboratories : Absolute Neutrophil Count &gt; 1,000/uL Platelets &gt; 50,000/uL Bilirubin &lt; 2.0 mg/dL Creatinine &lt; 2.0 mg/dL AST/ALT &lt; 3.0 x ULN For patient evidence minimal residual disease prior vaccination , assessment minimal residual disease status cytogenetics FISH follow post vaccination . Exclusion Criteria Patients must serious intercurrent illness infection require IV antibiotic , significant cardiac disease characterize significant arrhythmia , ischemic coronary disease congestive heart failure Patients , treat physician , choose proceed allogeneic transplant time remission eligible randomization Active prior document autoimmune inflammatory disorder include limited following : GI Disorders : ( include inflammatory bowel disease [ eg , ulcerative colitis , Crohn 's disease ] , diverticulitis ( exception prior episode resolve ) , celiac disease , serious gastrointestinal chronic condition associate diarrhea . Systemic lupus erythematosus Wegener 's syndrome [ granulomatosis polyangiitis ] Myasthenia gravis Graves ' disease Rheumatoid arthritis Hypophysitis Uveitis The following exception criterion : subject vitiligo alopecia ; subject hypothyroidism ( eg , follow Hashimoto syndrome ) stable hormone replacement ; subject psoriasis require systemic treatment . Current prior use immunosuppressive medication within 14 day prior first dose durvalumab vaccine . The following exception criterion : intranasal , inhale , topical local steroid injection ( eg . intraarticular injection ) ; steroid premedication hypersensitivity reaction ; systemic corticosteroid physiologic dos exceed 10mg/day prednisone equivalent Known human immunodeficiency virus ( HIV ) , hepatitis C virus ( HCV ) evidence active hepatitis B virus ( HBV ) . History hypersensitivity durvalumab excipient Receipt live attenuate vaccination within 30 day prior first dose durvalumab vaccine Female subject pregnant , breastfeed female patient reproductive potential employ effective method birth control start dose durvalumab vaccine , include dose interruption 90 day receipt last dose durvalumab . Refrain egg cell donation take durvalumab least 90 day last dose durvalumab . Male subject employ effective method birth control start dose durvalumab vaccine , include dose interruption 90 day receipt last dose durvalumab . Refrain sperm cell donation take durvalumab least 90 day last dose durvalumab . Step 3 : Eligibility Criteria Prior Treatment Observation Resolution chemotherapy relate grade IIIIV toxicity per CTC criterion 4.0 Laboratories : WBC &gt; 2.0 X 103/uL Platelets &gt; 50,000/uL Bilirubin &lt; 2.0 mg/dL Creatinine &lt; 2.0 mg/dL AST/ALT &lt; 3.0 x ULN At least 2 dos fusion vaccine produce ( Arm A B )</criteria>
