	<brief_summary>Advancement via Individual Determination ( AVID ) college preparatory program provide unique opportunity determine whether school reduce substance use re-grouping at-risk student high-performing student , provide additional academic emotional support . Operating 4,837 K-12th grade school worldwide across 45 US state , widely-disseminated program target student group traditionally underrepresented high education currently perform academic middle ( i.e. , 2.0-3.5 grade point average ) . AVID remove student typical classroom expose peer network academic performance positive social norm value . In addition , strengthen student/teacher relationship , AVID expand student ' network supportive adult . For low-income minority student academic middle , relatively small investment prevention might significantly impact academic health trajectory . AVID capitalize moment social network flux—the transition high school—to shift student ' trajectory . This study longitudinal , randomized pilot evaluation AVID among low-income minority adolescent enter high school , compare academic performance drug use , well risky behavior , 3 year . Although social network hypothesize strong influence behavior , study try re-wire network change behavior . This study provide clear understand whether school intentionally shape network whether change reduce substance use . This study also explore important mechanistic question whether AVID change peer network relationship teacher , whether change lead improvement academic behavioral outcome , , relative importance peer versus adult network change .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Substance use increase problem among adolescent . Despite decade prevention work , recent data suggest , end high school , quarter teen regularly use marijuana nearly half regularly use alcohol . While adolescent marijuana use increase across country last decade , rate California high national average . This may partially attributable increase social acceptance access legalized dispensary . As movement legalize marijuana gain traction , similar change likely occur throughout country . The high prevalence alcohol marijuana use particularly disturb light evidence even intermittent adolescent exposure may long-term impact brain development , addition association risky health behavior future substance abuse disorder . African American Latino youth especially risk , make adolescent substance use prevention potentially important strategy address health disparity . Few effective sustainable substance use intervention exist high school student . Preventing substance use become challenge adolescent age , few prevention program demonstrate success high school youth middle school youth . The challenge identify modifiable predictor substance use high-school youth harness prevention . Furthermore , intervention difficult disseminate sustain due limit financial human capital . AVID already widely implement public school . Thus , AVID effective reduce substance use also improve academic outcome , program would serve promise model future intervention . Social network likely powerfully influence adolescent substance use . There strong consistent evidence adolescent substance use closely tied behavior attitude individual social network . Social network structure composition shape cultural environmental factor . In school environment , factor include policy like track student base prior achievement . Social network determine source support , transmission social norm , access opportunity engage substance use . Although peer powerful point influence adolescence , relationship supportive adult continue protect substance use . Despite great interest social network potential determinant risky behavior , causal pathway link social network adolescent health yet fully categorize . Studies suggest change social network impact substance use , little known harness relationship effectively . Answering question may applications across many social environment health domain . Interventions re-wire social network might offer relatively low-cost , self-sustaining , effective mean prevent challenge behavior lead poor health outcome . School environment present critical opportunity impact adolescent health . Through near-daily exposure , school environment potential shape adolescent ' relationship , social norm , sense identity , educational attainment . These factor likely mutually reinforce strongly associate substance use . AVID , widely use educational intervention , offer important opportunity test whether school re-wire social network improve adolescent health . AVID remove middle-performing student typical school environment , social pressure often reinforce low academic achievement problem behavior , place alongside high-performing student college-preparatory environment positive social norm value . AVID capitalize natural transition point , social network flux , target student begin 9th grade . Perhaps coincidentally , 9th grade also enormously vulnerable period—36 % high school drop-outs 9th grade , 15 % 9th grader hold back ever graduate . Finally , program emphasize student/teacher relationship , train teacher serve mentor student advocate , provide academic emotional support cultivate family-like atmosphere . Through propose randomize control pilot evaluation AVID , investigator measure whether program successfully change social network , test whether change social network motivate change substance use . Understanding whether AVID 's return investment extend health outcome vitally important give limited resource available support multiple compete K-12 education initiative . The Los Angeles Unified School District ( LAUSD ) implement AVID provide academic social support student group traditionally under-represented high education ( e.g. , student color , first generation attend college ) . AVID international non-profit institution originally establish 1980 San Diego high school teacher . AVID 's goal prepare vulnerable student function academic middle success 4-year university . Students school must actively apply program demonstrate eligibility interest . AVID 's eligibility criterion include grade point average 2.0-3.5 return contract sign student parent indicate student chooses participate program , desire go college , agree enroll rigorous academic course . Identification eligible candidate AVID occur second half 8th grade , prior high school entry , lead AVID coordinator . At nearly every AVID high school , number student qualify AVID far outweigh program 's capacity—there , average , 40 AVID slot per school , result AVID serve 12 % student body . In LAUSD , demographic AVID student match district—low-income , African American Latino . For example , 2014 , 86 % LAUSD 's AVID student Latino , 6 % African American , 89 % qualify free reduce lunch . LAUSD 's AVID program agree allow investigator recruit study participant pool student meet AVID eligibility requirement well group high performing ( middle school grade point average ( GPA ) &gt; 3.5 ) student AVID eligible . Near end 8th grade , LAUSD randomize AVID eligible applicant lottery either AVID waitlist group . Prior random assignment reveal , investigator ask student randomize AVID equal number student randomized waitlist group return sign parental consent form study participation complete survey . Students recruit survey prior reveal assignment avoid response bias cause happiness disappointment lottery result . Decisions participate study impact lottery . Investigators survey study participant end 8th grade , 9th grade , 10th grade , 11th grade .</detailed_description>
