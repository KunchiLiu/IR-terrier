	<brief_summary>Amniotomy ( break bag water ) commonly use induction labor . However , time highly variable . The purpose study determine first time mother undergo induction labor Foley catheter experience decrease labor time undergo early amniotomy ( break bag water within 1 hour Foley catheter removal ) undergo delay amniotomy ( break bag water least 4 hour Foley catheter removal ) . Other aim include relationship time amniotomy cesarean section , postpartum hemorrhage , intrauterine infection , neonatal Apgar score &lt; 7 5 minute , neonatal need intensive care . The investigator hypothesize induction labor Foley catheter follow early amniotomy result decrease duration labor compare undergo delay amniotomy .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Early Amniotomy Versus Delayed Amniotomy Following Foley Catheter Ripening Nulliparous Labor Induction</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This randomize clinical trial consent nulliparous woman undergo induction labor Foley catheter seek determine whether use early amniotomy ( defined amniotomy within 1 hour Foley catheter removal ) improve obstetrical outcome compare delayed amniotomy ( defined amniotomy least 4 hour follow Foley catheter removal ) . This project include 110 woman recruit obstetrical service Prentice Women 's Hospital . Women include least 37 week gestation , singleton pregnancy , intact membrane undergo induction labor use Foley catheter . Following removal Foley catheter , woman assess safety amniotomy appropriate , randomize either early amniotomy delay amniotomy . Women randomize equal probability intervention group use block randomization stratify use Foley catheter alone Foley catheter-misoprostol use . Women early amniotomy group undergo amniotomy within 1 hour Foley catheter removal . Women delay amniotomy group undergo amniotomy least 4 hour follow Foley removal . The remainder labor management discretion woman 's obstetric provider . Prior discharge hospital , baseline demographic clinical data obtain via chart review</detailed_description>
