	<brief_summary>To evaluate effect virtual reality-based rehabilitation ( Neofect Glove ) newly diagnose cognitively intact adult dominant hemisphere stroke patient paresis hand supplementation conventional occupational therapy ass whether improves motor function speed recovery inpatient rehabilitation versus conventional occupational therapy alone . Also , impact quality life .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Effects Virtual Reality Based Rehabilitation Acute Stroke Patients Inpatient Rehab Setting</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The American Stroke Association state stroke 5th lead cause death United States one lead cause disability loss motor function . Approximately 80 % stroke survivor upper extremity limitation distal upper extremity motor function severely affect last body part recover . Restoration arm function essential regaining activity daily live ( ADL ) hold object like utensil , turn doorknob , write telephone use . Literature search show intensive repetitive training may necessary modify neural organization recover functional motor skill . Along traditional rehabilitation method , virtual reality ( VR ) base rehabilitation emerge recent year . VR-based rehabilitation intensive , long duration repetitive . Using VR rehabilitation , repetitive dull exercise turn challenge motivate task game . Moreover , VR-based rehabilitation provide quantitative measure rehabilitation progress . The investigator propose study compare conventional occupational service versus virtual reality-based rehabilitation intervention participant acute phase stroke inpatient rehabilitation setting . The investigator hypothesize use VRA , see significant increase overall motor function , short hospital course improve quality life participant .</detailed_description>
