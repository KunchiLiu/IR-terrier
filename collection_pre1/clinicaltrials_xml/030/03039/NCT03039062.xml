	<brief_title>Serum miR-122 Real-time Detection Biomarker Drug-induced Liver Injury Chemotherapy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The endorsed standard serum biomarkers , like ALT , AST , total bilirubin , tissue-specific , detect drug-induced liver injury ( DILI ) early stage , thus unable properly guide risk assessment patient management . miR-122 liver-enriched miRNA . Many study demonstrate miR-122 sensitive specific biomarker DILI occur . However , lack standard quantification method miR-122 confirmatory study use comprehensive list drug patient . The investigator develop miRNA-derived Fragment Length Polymorphism ( miRFLP ) assay simultaneous quantification multiple miRNAs.The methodology improve detection reliability eliminate intra-assay variable . In study , investigator investigate role miR-122 real-time detection biomarker drug-induced liver injury utilize miRFLP assay . In addition , investigator try identify normal physiological range miR-122 healthy population relationship miR-122 hepatic failure patient intensive care unit .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>For participant : Normal liver function biomarkers include ALT , AST , ALP , TBIL recruitment . Patients liver disease : hepatitis B，hepatitis C，cirrhosis , hepatic failure . For patient chemotherapy group : Life expectancy least 12 week 40 patient receive epirubicincontaining chemotherapY 40 patient receive paclitaxelcontaining chemotherapy Patients receive carboplatincontaining chemotherapy . Patients congestive heart failure Unstable angina pectoris Previous history myocardial infarction within 6 month prior study entry Uncontrolled hypertension determine Investigator high risk uncontrolled , arrhythmia . Patients previously receive chemotherapy</criteria>
