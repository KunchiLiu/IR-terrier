	<brief_summary>Thermotherapy technology aim destroy tissue , example tumor tissue . Immunostimulating Interstitial Laser Thermotherapy ( imILT ) specific form thermotherapy , , addition destroy tumor tissue , optimize cause tumor specific immunologic response . In laboratory animal imILT method also show induce call abscopal effect . This mean one tumor treat imILT , untreated , tumor also decrease size . The immunologic response previously characterize breast cancer patient receive imILT treatment , presume abscopal effect induce imILT also describe malignant melanoma patient . The purpose trial investigate functionality safety imILT treatment method patient diagnose breast cancer . The treatment method successfully use treatment patient breast cancer malignant melanoma . Treatment breast cancer patient cause increase cytotoxic T lymphocytes treated tumor , well activate dendritic cell tumor border . Regulatory T lymphocytes decreased regional lymph node . This trial explorative , prospective , open non-randomized . Five breast cancer patient treat trial , estimate carried time period 9 month .</brief_summary>
