	<brief_title>Automated Closed-Loop Versus Restrictive Fluid Therapy Abdominal Surgery</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Perioperative fluid management topic much debate intensify recent year . Studies show improved postoperative outcome restrict fluid administration perioperative period moderate risk abdominal surgery . They conclude patient undergo elective abdominal surgery , intraoperative restrictive fluid management associate reduction postoperative morbidity shorten hospital stay . Current standard practice crystalloid base fluid therapy guide static hemodynamic parameter heart rate , blood pressure , diuresis . However , several study criticize cookbook approach recommend tailor management specific physiologic dynamic endpoint stroke volume variation cardiac output use flow monitoring device . Our team demonstrate use closed-loop system feasible allows precise titration fluid administration abdominal vascular surgery use either minimally non-invasive monitoring system . Goal : This study compare hemodynamic variable outcome patient receive either automate closed-loop fluid therapy guide non-invasive flow monitoring restrictive fluid therapy 4ml/kg/h . Both group consist population undergo laparoscopic and/or robotic surgery . Hypothesis : A closed-loop assist intraoperative GDFT compare restrictive fluid therapy provide good hemodynamic variable .</detailed_description>
