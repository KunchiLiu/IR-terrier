	<brief_summary>The investigator interested learning choline , nutrient require body . The body make choline , make enough support health rest must acquire diet . Eggs , especially egg yolk , major dietary source choline . Choline also give dietary supplement . Ingestion choline supplement link increased concentration compound call TMAO ( trimethylamine N-oxide ) . Elevated TMAO level link high heart disease risk . With study , investigator hope learn whether difference way body respond ingestion choline supplement versus choline find within egg .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Effects Choline From Eggs v . Supplements Generation TMAO Humans</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The principal goal study examine whether difference ingestion choline supplement versus choline find within egg plasma TMAO level . The investigator previously show dietary intake trimethylamines , include choline group phosphatidylcholine ( PC ) , mechanistically link cardiovascular disease risk metabolism trimethylamine nutrient human modulate intestinal microbe ( gut microbe ) . Additionally , extensive animal study link essential role gut microbiota metabolism choline production metabolite promote / accelerate atherosclerotic process . The investigator also recently show 10-fold increase plasma TMAO level follow supplementation choline bitartrate supplement . However , another pilot study collaborator ( unpublished ) show increase plasma TMAO level follow ingestion whole egg , major dietary source choline . Therefore , study investigator wish examine difference , , ingestion equivalent mass total choline free form ( bitartrate salt ) supplement vs. within whole egg . Eggs , specifically egg yolk , contain large amount total choline . However , egg white contains potential anti-microbial peptide could influence gut microbial composition function , therefore impact conversion choline TMA TMAO observe subject . Therefore , investigator hypothesize consumption whole egg ( hardboiled ) elevate plasma TMAO level extent comparable amount total choline ingest capsule form choline bitartrate salt . The investigator hypothesize consumption egg white choline bitartrate tablet may result less rise TMAO level ingestion choline bitartrate supplement alone .</detailed_description>
