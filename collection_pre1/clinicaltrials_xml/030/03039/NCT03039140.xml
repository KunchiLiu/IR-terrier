	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I. Assess feasibility conduct 14-week cardiac rehabilitation ( CR ) program woman breast cancer completion acute therapy . II . Preliminarily evaluate efficacy CR improve cardiorespiratory fitness ( peak oxygen uptake , maximum volume oxygen [ VO2 max ] ) baseline 14 week . III . Explore change cardiovascular disease ( CVD ) risk factor ( blood pressure , cholesterol , fast glucose , body mass index ) baseline 14-week follow-up . Blood pressure body mass index also check 8 week . IV . Quantify difference quality life ( QoL ) baseline , 8 week , 14 week follow , adjust baseline QoL value . OUTLINE : Patients participate CR program consist 1-hour CR intervention session , base personalized exercise prescription , 3 time per week 14 week ( total 36 session ) . Components exercise prescription include intensity , mode , duration , frequency . Intensity exercise guide result grade exercise stress test , rating perceive exertion ( RPE ) , heart rate , symptom , chest pain/angina shortness breath . If exercise well-tolerated CR session , patient encourage supplement exercise program home , increase exercise frequency 5 time per week . Patients may attend weekly educational session offer Phase 2 CR program cover topic stress management , smoke cessation , nutrition , weight loss .</detailed_description>
