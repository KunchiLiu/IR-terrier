	<detailed_description>Aim Hypotheses Currently , objective measure early respiratory indicator develop respiratory compromise surgical patient . Current respiratory assessment non-intubated patient relies oximetry data subjective clinical assessment . Pulse oximetry extremely helpful recognize oxygen desaturations late indicator respiratory decline . New advance technology digital signal processing lead development impedance base Respiratory Volume Monitor ( RVM ) . The RVM ( ExSpiron™ , Respiratory Motion , Inc. ; Waltham , MA ) show provide accurate real-time , continuous , non-invasive measurement tidal volume ( TV ) , minute ventilation ( MV ) respiratory rate ( RR ) general patient population . Hypotheses Primary : Low minute ventilation ( LMV ) define sustain LMV &lt; 40 % minute ventilation predict ( MVPRED ) base IBW follow opioid administration correlate adverse clinical outcome PACU floor include : - O2 desaturation , atelectasis , respiratory status require advance monitor - respiratory intervention O2 administration , continuous positive airway pressure CPAP , BiPAP , - incidence ICU transfer and/or increase PACU and/or general hospital floor ( GHF ) length stay ( LOS ) . Secondary : - 1 . Decreased MV define sustain MV &lt; 80 % MVPRED base IBW opioid administration correlate adverse clinical outcome define . - 2 . Patients decrease MV prior opioid administration likely develop LMV standard opioid administration compare patient normal MV define MV ≥ 81 % MVPRED base ideal body weight ( IBW ) Rationale Continuous respiratory monitoring use ExSpiron System particularly beneficial patient post-anesthesia environment . Assessment management respiratory function early intervention indicate multifaceted , complex task often complicate lack cohesive continuous monitoring system guide clinical decision . The ExSpiron system design patient intend address limitation current generation hospital monitor provide healthcare provider continuous real-time data regard patient 's respiratory status . Recent data show stratification patient base RVM 's MV % predict MV ( MVPRED ) , prior opioid dose make possible identify patient risk decrease MV opioid-induced respiratory depression ( OIRD ) . 1 . In spontaneously breathe , non-ventilated patient , current monitoring device provide continuous , objective non-invasive , continuous real time information important respiratory parameter TV , MV &amp; RR . 2 . Current monitoring non-intubated patient mostly rely subjective clinical assessment , oximetry data , rarely end-tidal carbon dioxide CO2 measurement . In appropriate clinical setting , ExSpiron system provide direct quantitative measure ventilation parameter use clinical assessment trend prediction well response medication intervention allow efficient clinical decision making . 3 . Current technology provide continuity care PACU general hospital floor .</detailed_description>
