	<detailed_description>SLC6A14 amino acid transporter Previous research show expression amino acid transporter SLC6A14 up-regulated cervical cancer1 . Studies breast , colon pancreatic cancer cell show SLC6A14 amino acid transporter serve role support amino acid nutrition cancer cells2,3,4 . It also show genetic deletion pharmacologic blockade transporter suppress growth tumor cell vitro vivo4,5,6 . We interested explore expression SLC6A14 transporter normal cervical epithelial cell , cervical dysplasia cervical cancer ; see expression transporter correlation presence/severity cervical dysplasia/cancer , also see may serve biomarker predict diagnose presence cervical dysplasia cervical cancer . GPR81 , G-protein couple receptor lactate Human vagina predominantly colonize Lactobacilli , convert glycogen vaginal epithelial cell lactic acid . Some specie Lactobacilli also produce hydrogen peroxide . Both lactate H2O2 help keep vaginal pH low ( acidic &lt; 4.5 ) also help prevent colonization vagina pathogenic bacteria . When level Lactobacilli vaginal micro environment change ( certain vaginal infection , decline estrogen level etc ) , level lactate decline H2O2 decline—thus predispose woman vaginal infection . Vaginal cervical fluid contain lactate millimolar concentration . Recent study identify G-protein-coupled cell-surface receptor lactate , -called GPR81 . Studies Dr. Ganapathy 's lab show activation receptor GPR81 B lymphocytes enhances production IgA antibody , play role defense mechanism mucosal surface . IgA antibodies see high level intestinal , colonic , lung mucosa well vaginal epithelial surface . These IgA antibody protect colonization mucosal surface pathogenic bacteria . Thus GPR 81 anti-inflammatory molecule . Hence may inversely correlate cervical dysplasia . We propose investigate vaginal cervical epithelial cell express GPR81 , whether GPR81 expression correlate cervical dysplasia . If correlation exist lactate level GPR81 expression , decline Lactobacilli level associate decline lactate level , could lead decreased GPR81 expression epithelial cell , thus decline IgA antibody secretion . This could reason vaginal infection decrease Lactobacilli . If infection HPV virus occur , lead abnormality Pap smear potential cervical dysplasia future .</detailed_description>
