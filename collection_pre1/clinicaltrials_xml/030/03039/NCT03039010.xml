	<detailed_description>Validation data dental health SKaPa registry child adolescent . Research question : How reliable information dental caries child adolescent SKaPa registry ? Hypothesis : Data SKaPa difference minimally compare medical record clinical status come deft/DMFT 6 12 year old child . There underregistration dental caries due register caries treat . The child examine bite-wings higher score deft/DMFT child . Method : Tooth decay examine clinically train calibrated dentist 75 6-year-olds 75 12-year-olds include , thus total 150 individual . The registration compare recently collect data individual SKaPa evaluate quality information SKaPa registry . The inclusion patient clinical dental examination base cluster sample ( dental clinic Public Dental Service ) Värmland . The exact number individual examine determined power calculation collaboration Biostatistician . Furthermore , randomize sample 500 individual data report SKaPa year 2014 include evaluation dental record dental radiograph . Comparisons make data registry original data patient record . Preliminary calculate 250 6-year-olds 250 12-year-olds include . Study population size determine power-calculation collaboration statistician . The study would make possible detect difference deft/DMFT 10 % standard deviation 30 % . The review dental record make two calibrated dentist . The consistency registration dental record radiographs continually evaluate throughout study . Primary outcome measure clinical part dental record survey number teeth deft/ DMFT . The following data register : - Status : Number teeth , teeth , manifest caries - Radiographs - manifest caries lesion , quality radiograph - example ; possi-bility see interdental space , overlap , marginal bone , quality radiographic exposure - Recordings dental record patient 's health status , medication , risk assessment - Therapy decision diagnose manifest tooth decay - Undiagnosed manifest caries - Prevention treatment - Which dental profession child meet ( dentist/dental hygienist/dental assistant ) - Decision next examination plan - When previous examination do , X-rays take ( yes/no ) , diagnosed caries initially/manifest/or</detailed_description>
