	<brief_summary>Early rectal cancer remove minimally-invasive surgery , standard pathological assessment remove tumour give valuable information advance tumour . This give indication likely cancer recur , doctor patient decide appropriate treatment follow-up . However still much uncertainty prediction recurrence . This study assess two pathology test , ploidy stroma ratio tumour , correlate result outcome . This determine whether two test provide additional value predict outcome .

	<detailed_description>Early rectal cancer remove minimally-invasive surgery , standard pathological assessment remove tumour give valuable information advance tumour . This information important indicating whether cancer likely recur , therefore advise patient surgery whether treatment advisable , , appropriate follow-up regime . However still lot uncertainty prediction recurrence cancer , good test seek . This study aim look two pathology test , ploidy stroma ratio tumour , correlate test result outcome patient early rectal cancer remove . This allow investigator ass whether two test provide additional value predict outcome . If , clinician would well able advise patient early rectal cancer prognosis management . Routine histopathology analysis rectal cancer specimen remove surgery include assessment tumour size , depth invasion , vascular , lymphatic perineural invasion , tumour involvement resection margin nodal involvement . This information valuable predicting outcome . For example , predict rate local recurrence 36 month follow local excision rectal cancer transanal endoscopic microsurgery ( TEM ) base tumour size , depth invasion lymphatic invasion tabulate . However model perfect , leave room improvement . Ploidy stroma ratio two test show promise predict outcome . Ploidy refers number set chromosomes cell nucleus . Most human cell normally diploid , two set 23 chromosome . Abnormal tumour cell may different number set chromosome , aneuploid , replicate deleted chromosome . In general , aneuploidy cancer cell associate bad prognosis . An early study DNA ploidy rectal cancer use flow cytometry show independent small predictive effective aneuploidy survival . Technological advance allow accurate detailed assessment ploidy . The DNA ploidy status tumour cell early ovarian cancer find predict patient benefit adjuvant chemotherapy surgery remove ovarian tumour use routinely centre aid decision-making . Stroma ratio refers tumour : stroma ratio . A low proportion tumour cell , conversely , high percentage stroma , cancer tends associate poor prognosis . This ratio find strongly associate tumour growth invasion colorectal cancer , independently predict survival patient undergo surgery removal colorectal tumour . However previous study look mainly advanced colon cancer , rather early rectal cancer , use cancer-related death endpoint , rather look local recurrence response adjuvant treatment .</detailed_description>
