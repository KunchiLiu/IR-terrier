	<detailed_description>Premature accelerate brain age trajectory start recognize cognitive neural response , specific mechanism course cognitive age remain elucidated . Insulin resistance ( IR ) know change age , affect cognition old elderly adult well patient affective disorder . It unknown whether IR predict cognitive decline individual young age 50 without overt mental illness . Studies young adult afford unique opportunity ass whether IR mediate cognitive correlate neural process decade manifestation cognitive decline . The investigator propose use innovative accelerate longitudinal design ( ALD ) characterize trajectory cognitive neural biomarkers : 1 ) describe baseline cognitive neural biomarkers brain function across spectrum IR person age 25-50 ; 2 ) ass baseline IR change IR young age affect pattern decline cognitive neural biomarkers 3 ) explore effect baseline IR change cognitive neural variable interest moderate non-modifiable risk factor cognitive decline ( gender , APOE4/family history AD ) . The current proposal aim describe developmental trajectory cognitive neural biomarkers across spectrum metabolic dysfunction overweight/obese adult young 50 year age . Utilizing accelerated longitudinal design ( ALD ) recruit overweight/obese individual ( total N=160 ) age 25-50 . Based semi-longitudinal data , design allow u examine outcome development 25 year age 25-50 3-year follow-up . All subject undergo baseline qualitative measure IR , cognitive assessment multimodal magnetic resonance imaging ( MMRI ) . Neuropsychological evaluation focus cognitive flexibility/set shift test reflect hippocampal connectivity medial prefrontal region . MMRI include memory-related hippocampal function connectivity ( measure task- resting-state fMRI ) hippocampal volume . The ALD design allow investigation relation cognitive performance correspond neural response across IR spectrum long period time predictive value IR long-term trajectory change cognitive neural biomarkers span 25 year .</detailed_description>
