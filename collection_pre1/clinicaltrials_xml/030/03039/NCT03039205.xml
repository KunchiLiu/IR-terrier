	<brief_title>Platelet Aggregation Patients With Coronary Artery Disease Kidney Dysfunction Taking Clopidogrel Ticagrelor</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Previous publication demonstrate 35 % 40 % patient hospitalize Acute Coronary Syndromes ( ACS ) degree renal dysfunction . On hand , chronic kidney disease ( CKD ) associate bad prognosis ACS patient , lead also increase risk bleeding , may importantly influence risk-benefit ratio antiplatelet therapy population . Even early stage , CKD increase risk myocardial infarction death among different spectrum ACS , risk increase directly proportional degree renal dysfunction . The responsible mechanism increase rate ischemic event population completely elucidate . However , accelerated atherosclerosis , oxidative stress , inflammation increase platelet aggregation , well underutilization therapy antithrombotic agent invasive procedure , propose mechanism . Antiplatelet therapy paramount importance treatment ACS , benefit CKD patient well establish . The fact population often exclude underrepresented large clinical trial , make indication use often extrapolated study patient preserve renal function . In recent meta-analysis , Palmer et al . seek summarize benefit risk antiplatelet agent patient CKD , focus occurrence cardiovascular event ( include mortality ) bleeding . The result lead conclude : 1 ) evidence use antiplatelet agent patient CKD cardiovascular disease low quality , 2 ) patient ACS schedule angioplasty already take acetylsalicylic acid ( ASA ) , addition clopidogrel glycoprotein IIb / IIIa inhibitor little impact reduce incidence myocardial infarction , death need revascularization , 3 ) significant 40 % increase incidence major bleeding . In PLATO trial - `` Ticagrelor versus Clopidogrel Patients Acute Coronary Syndromes '' - ticagrelor , new reversible inhibitor P2Y12 receptor faster onset action great platelet inhibition power compare clopidogrel 18,000 patient high risk ACS . In publication , patient receive ticagrelor 16 % risk reduction occurrence primary composite endpoint ( death vascular cause , myocardial infarction stroke ) without significant increase incidence major bleeding . In secondary outcome analysis , find significant reduction mortality vascular cause mortality cause patient treat ticagrelor . Among high-risk criterion use selection patient study , creatinine clearance &lt; 60 ml/min/1.73 m2 include . In follow article , consider pre-specified sub-analysis PLATO trial , result 3,237 patient high-risk criterion compare obtained population normal renal function . The developed comparison suggest benefit ticagrelor may even great patient CKD : consider MDRD equation estimate renal function , hazard-ratio ( HR ) primary outcome study 0.71 patient renal impairment ( creatinine clearance &lt; 60 ml/min/1.73m2 ) 0.90 without renal dysfunction ( p = 0.03 interaction ) . Furthermore , HRs mortality , respectively , 0.79 0.91 patient without renal dysfunction ( P = 0.02 interaction ) . Interestingly , significant difference group relatively major bleed observe , incidence dyspnea high population without renal dysfunction . Two hypothesis consider explain result . The first suggest great consistent platelet inhibition achieve ticagrelor would effective reduce ischemic event population increase thrombotic risk . The second hypothesis considers possible pleiotropic effect ticagrelor besides reversible inhibition P2Y12 receptor . Ticagrelor might associate elevation serum level adenosine inhibition reuptake erythrocyte increase release adenosine triphosphate ( ATP ) erythrocytes , subsequently convert adenosine ecto-ATPases . An increase concentration circulate adenosine could improve myocardial perfusion coronary vasodilation , effect would pronounce patient renal dysfunction . Thus , project aim validate ( ) hypotheses , analyze platelet aggregation circulate adenosine level patient take dual antiplatelet therapy aspirin clopidogrel ticagrelor . # Safety : protocol design short-term duration , expect many adverse event ( AE ) . An AE untoward medical occurrence participant necessarily causal relationship study intervention . An AE therefore unfavorable unintended sign ( include abnormal laboratory find ) , symptom disease temporally associate use medical treatment procedure regardless whether consider related medical treatment procedure . AEs report soon possible . Serious adverse event ( SAE ) define untoward medical occurrence meet one follow criterion : 1 . Results death life-threatening time event ; 2 . Requires inpatient hospitalization , prolongs hospitalization ; 3 . Results persistent significant disability/incapacity ; 4 . Is congenital anomaly/birth defect ( participant offspring ) ; 5 . Is medically judge important event jeopardized subject , example , require significant measure avoid one outcome . SAEs report within 24 hour information receive . The causality SAEs ( relationship study treatment/procedures ) assess investigator ( ) investigator responsible inform local authority ethical committee , serious adverse event per local requirement .</detailed_description>
