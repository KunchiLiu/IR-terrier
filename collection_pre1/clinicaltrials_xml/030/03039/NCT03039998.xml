	<detailed_description>The main objective project compare validity sample method perform routinely ( bronchial secretion , stomach content , oropharyngeal smear ) determination etiological agent responsible hospital-acquired pneumonia ( HAP ) critically ill patient bronchoscopy-assisted protected brush method . Obtained result different method enable determine bronchial secretion sample , stomach content sample oropharyngeal smear comparable precise technically difficult protect brush . Evaluation present clinical praxis use bronchial secretion sample HAP diagnostics detection common etiological agent patient HAP priority project . The role atypical fungal pathogen HAP initiation discover well . Aiming confirm exclude diagnosis HAP , determine source possible route bacterial pathogen transmission molecular biology analysis etiological agent perform . Finally , percentage HAP etiological agent resistant initial empiric antibiotic therapy observe . Project fulfill program objective molecular-biologic approach research support infectious disease domain . It make contribution faster precise HAP diagnosis adequate antibiotic therapy .</detailed_description>
