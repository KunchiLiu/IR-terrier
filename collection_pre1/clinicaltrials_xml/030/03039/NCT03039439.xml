	<brief_title>Molecular IHC Profiling PTH Tumors Evaluate Targeted Agents</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The purpose study dual-fold : 1 . To determine difference clinical behavior immunohistochemical ( IHC ) biomarkers parathyroid carcinoma ( PC ) , atypical neoplasm ( AN ) parathyroid adenoma ( PA ) . This allow use marker diagnostic screen tool evaluate parathyroid tumor . 2 . To determine potential gene use patient parathyroid tumor diagnostic purpose . Genomic analysis tumor sample perform identify molecular aberration novel target therapy recently develop .</detailed_description>
	<criteria>1 . The patient cohort study consist patient within prospectively maintain parathyroid database within Department Surgical Oncology University Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center ( MDACC ) collaborate site , tissue blood available 19682015 , previously consent use tissue research purpose ( via Protocols LAB 080034 , PA110695 LAB030320 appropriate external mechanism collaborate site ) . 2 . All patient know diagnosis PHPT operated/treated Department Surgical Oncology MDACC collaborate site . Patients provide consent use tissue blood research purpose consider study ( via Protocol LAB030320 LAB 080034 appropriate external mechanism collaborate site ) . 3 . All consented patient know diagnosis PHPT histopathological diagnosis : parathyroid carcinoma , atypical parathyroid neoplasm parathyroid adenoma . There restriction age , gender , ethnicity 4 . Selected patient obtain outside collaboration meet selection criterion tissue availability diagnostic suitability inclusion study ( See Criteria 3 diagnostic criterion ) . 1 . Patients without tissue available analysis .</criteria>
