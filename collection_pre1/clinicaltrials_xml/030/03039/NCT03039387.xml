	<brief_summary>Deficient cognitive control ( CC ) use dysfunctional emotion regulation strategy ( ERS ) central characteristic major depression . Both associated reduced activity dorsolateral prefrontal cortex ( dlPFC ) . Transcranial direct current stimulation ( tDCS ) safe , simple effective non-invasive method modulate cortical excitability . The goal randomize , sham-controlled , double blind clinical trial examine effect transcranial direct current stimulation ( tDCS ) CC ERS depress patient compare healthy subject . Overall , study include 44 participant ( 22 depress Patients 22 healthy subject ) . Each participant complete CC task receive sham tDCS one session anodal tDCS session ( counterbalance ) . Afterwards ERS 'rumination ' measure rest phase mean questionnaire psychophysiological measure ( heart rate variability ) . The investigator hypothesize ( ) amelioration CC anodal tDCS ( b ) reduce use dysfunctional emotion regulation strategy 'rumination ' anodal tDCS . Overall experiment provide new reliable data development new treatment method .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>1 . Working hypothesis : anodal transcranial direct current stimulation ( tDCS ) dorsolateral prefrontal cortex ( dlPFC ) enhance healthy impaired cognitive control ( CC ) reduce use dysfunctional emotion regulation strategy . 2 . Previous work investigator : The investigator previous work provide decisive evidence polarity-specific activity-dependent effect tDCS leave dlPFC cognitive planning control emotional information processing healthy subject patient MD . Particularly , reduce prefrontal brain activity work memory task patient MD find use near infrared spectroscopy ( NIRS ) . In addition , investigator demonstrate single session , anodal , activity enhance tDCS leave dlPFC ameliorates deficient CC patient depression , whereas cathodal , activity reduce tDCS , induce depression-like negativity bias healthy subject . Furthermore , investigator show anodal tDCS leave dlPFC healthy subject show ( ) good performance CC task ( b ) increase angry mood task compare control group ( c ) elevate angry mood associate bad performance CC task . 3 . Aims workplan : investigate effect anodal tDCS leave dLPFC healthy depressed subject investigator conduct double-blind , randomize , sham-controlled , cross-over design . In two session participant ( 22 depress 22 healthy subject , N= 44 ) complete CC task receive anodal tDCS ( 1 mA ) leave dlPFC one session sham tDCS session ( counterbalance ) . Afterwards ERS 'rumination ' measure rest phase mean questionnaire psychophysiological measure .</detailed_description>
