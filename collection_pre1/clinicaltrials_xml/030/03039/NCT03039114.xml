	<criteria>Histologically confirm FL . Documented CD20+ FL . Relapsed refractory prior rituximabcontaining regimen . Previously treat maximum 4 cancerdirected treatment regimen . At least 1 measurable lesion &gt; 1.5 cm least 1 dimension compute tomography magnetic resonance imaging . Must willing undergo incisional excisional lymph node biopsy accessible adenopathy provide recent , available archived tumor biopsy . Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group ( ECOG ) performance status 0 2 . Clinical evidence transformation aggressive subtype lymphoma Grade 3B FL . History central nervous system lymphoma ( either primary metastatic ) . Allogeneic stem cell transplant within last 6 month , active graftversushost disease follow allogeneic transplant autologous stem cell transplant within last 3 month date first dose study drug administration . Use potent cytochrome P450 3A4 inhibitor inducer within 14 day 5 halflives ( whichever longer ) first dose study drug . Prior treatment selective PI3Kδ inhibitor pan PI3K inhibitor . Prior treatment bendamustine ( within 12 month start study treatment ) . Subjects prior bendamustine treatment ( &gt; 12 month start study treatment ) eligible meet follow criterion : Did discontinue tolerability concern . Achieved either partial CR bendamustine regimen least 12 month duration relapse/progression . Experienced progression follow regimen contain alkylating agent . Received prior obinutuzumab . Received rituximab within 4 week study start . Prior treatmentrelated toxicity resolve ≤ Grade 1 date study drug administration except stable chronic toxicity ( ≤ Grade 2 ) expect resolve ( eg , stable Grade 2 peripheral neurotoxicity ) . Received prior monoclonal antibody ( except antiCD20 antibody ) within 90 day date study start . History severe allergic anaphylactic reaction monoclonal antibody therapy ( eg , subject readministration rituximab would contraindicate safety reason ) .</criteria>
