The patient randomly assign active placebo group use identical device puff nostril 3 time daily . The nasal powder supply plastic container , deliver powder nozzle squeeze . The exact amount deliver standardized variation pattern deposition nose know . The placebo lactose powder particle size , appearance tinge mint taste cellulose powder . Rescue medication could obtain investigator emergency contact . Oral antihistamine loratadine 10 mg tablet sodium chromoglycate eye drop . Each subject obtain oral write instruction SMS . The SMS-reporting symptom start run period 3 day treatment last 4 week treatment grass pollen season Three time day patient remind SMS take nasal puff ask confirm intake response SMS . In evening , ask severity symptom precede day nose , eye low airway answer figure 1-6 , correspond 1 `` trouble '' , 2 '' little trouble '' , 3 '' moderate trouble '' , 4 '' rather much trouble '' , 5 '' much trouble '' , 6 `` much trouble '' respectively . From nose , score sneezing , run nose block nose report . For eye low airway , respectively , conclude figure use . In registration question add daily use rescue medication .
