	<brief_summary>This pilot clinical trial study well copper Cu-64 TP3805 positron emission tomography ( PET ) /computed tomography ( CT ) work image patient urothelial cancer undergo surgery biopsy . Radioactive tracer , copper Cu-64 TP3805 , may bind tumor cell . PET/CT image perform copper Cu-64 TP3805 may better way detect urothelial cancer .</brief_summary>
