	<detailed_description>The purpose study learn old people HIV respond pneumococcal pneumonia vaccine . Pneumonia occur frequently old person AND person infect HIV . Therefore , common practice vaccinate pneumonia patient population . Because old patient HIV fit category , believe increase risk pneumonia . There two type pneumonia vaccine available adult approve Federal Drug Administration ( FDA ) . One call pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccine ( PPV23 ) protect 23 different strain pneumonia bacteria . The type vaccine call pneumococcal conjugate vaccine ( PCV13 ) protect different strain pneumonia bacteria . Until 2012 , recommend HIV-positive adult receive PPV23 diagnose HIV 5 year later . More recently , guideline change HIV-positive adult receive PCV13 , follow later PPV23 . At point time , clear regimen work well age HIV positive adult . Investigators study compare effectiveness vaccine regimen age HIV positive adult compare healthy adult . Although several study show short-term efficacy increase antibody response HIV+ person vaccine , others , either HIV+ population elderly . Large efficacy trial necessary establish clinical superiority PCV compare PPV likely conduct , particularly age HIV+ population . It therefore essential define immune response conjugate free-polysaccharide preparation examine traditional antibody functional level well B cell subset , critically affect age HIV . Will either PCV PPV elicit immune response compatible protection population ? Based persistent B cell perturbation HAART-treated person , hypothesize immunization age HIV+ person PPV23 effective PCV13 contain regimen quantitative , qualitative , B T cell level magnitude response relate degree chronic inflammation . The proposed study highly significant define B T cell responses TI-2 T-cell dependent form pneumococcal vaccine age HIV+ population . These data provide necessary basis development rational vaccination approach , include potential use novel adjuvant . In study investigator : 1 . Test hypothesis vaccination either PPV alone ( TI-2 ) PCV contain regimen ( TD ) result similar antibody levels/functional activity , determine level chronic inflammation age HIV+ . The investigator immunize study group HIV+ persons 50-65 control ( HIV+21-40 HIV- 50-65 year ) PCV13 follow PPV23 HIV+ 50-65 HIV- 50-65 PPV alone . The investigator examine immune response pneumococcal polysaccharide ( PPS ) 23 ( F ) , 14 , 3 , 7 ( F ) 19 ( A ) quantitative qualitative level use ELISA opsonophagocytic assay ( OPA ) correlate response degree inflammation measure participant . 2 . To test hypothesis level antigen specific B cell identify PPS comparable PPV PCV vaccine recipient . Pre- post-immunization peripheral blood sample obtain . Extensive phenotype analysis use antibody cluster differentiation ( CD ) 19 , 20 , 21 , 27 , 38 , 40 , immunoglobulin M ( IgM ) , B-cell activate factor ( BAFF ) , trans-membrane activator calcium modulator cyclophilin ligand interactor ( TACI ) , B-cell maturation antigen ( BCMA ) marker use characterize PPS-labeled B cell . Specific phenotype correlate antibody level , OPA inflammatory marker compare control population immunize PPV .</detailed_description>
