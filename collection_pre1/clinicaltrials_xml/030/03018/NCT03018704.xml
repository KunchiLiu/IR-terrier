The current proposal aim improve alcohol treatment AA Veterans , comprise 12 % Veteran population . 2 . Research Design : The propose study two-arm , randomize 12-week , parallel-groups comparison topiramate versus placebo reduce frequency heavy drinking day increase number abstinent day 160 AA patient AUD . 3 . Methodology : The follow specific aim use direct method : Specific Aim 1 . To test efficacy topiramate ( TOP ) 200 mg/day reduce frequency heavy drinking increase abstinent day African-American ( AA ) patient alcohol use disorder ( AUD ) . The investigator hypothesize , European-Americans ( EAs ) , AA subject receive TOP report few heavy drinking day ( HDDs ) abstinent day receive placebo ( PLA ) . The analysis make use data provide patient estimate model test TOP effect day heavy drink abstinent day . Power contrast determine pattern outcome final six week , power estimate base week 7 12 6-week trial , adjustment loss attrition baseline week 6 . Based investigator ' prior study ( Kranzler 2014 ) , investigator anticipate 92 % retention first six week group , yield 74 available per group end week 6 , additional 4 % loss due dropout across final six week , within-subject correlation 0.6 . The method Hedeker et al ( 1999 ) show investigator 80 % power TOP main effect size d=0.40 , 0.43 , 0.46 , within-subject correlation 0.5 , 0.6 , 0.7 , respectively , correct alpha level 0.025 . 4 . Impact/Significance : The proposal innovative focus AAs AUD , understudy underserved population data currently exist . Given far-reaching effect AUD high prevalence among Veterans , add evidence base treatment may realize reduce health care cost unnecessary ED visit reduce complication illness hepatitis C congestive heart failure .</detailed_description>
