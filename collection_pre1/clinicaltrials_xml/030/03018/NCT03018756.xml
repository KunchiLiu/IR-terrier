	<brief_summary>Patients idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis ( IPF ) experience distress activity-related respiratory discomfort challenge manage therapeutically . Interventions pulmonary rehabilitation , collaborative self-management , supplemental oxygen therapy oral opiate medication , variably effective therapeutic response individual patient difficult predict . The purpose study evaluate acute effect inhale opiate therapy ( fentanyl citrate ) breathe discomfort ( dyspnea ) individual mild-to-moderate IPF , well examine potential mechanism dyspnea relief .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Treatment opioids improve activity relate dyspnea reduce central respiratory neural drive . Inhaled fentanyl citrate opioid generally well tolerate show effectively relieve respiratory discomfort without cause systemic side-effects , although mechanism action poorly understood . Based current evidence , non-sedating , rapidly active inhale fentanyl represent possible alternative effective treatment severe dyspnea patient IPF require urgent treatment . As , primary objective study examine acute effect nebulized fentanyl dyspnea intensity quality patient mild-to-moderate IPF , well examine neurophysiological mechanism dyspnea relief fentanyl inhalation . It believe fentanyl compare placebo , reduce inspiratory neural drive diaphragm breathing frequency , result improvement dyspnea intensity physical exertion . Alternatively , dyspnea relief inhale fentanyl may independent change neural drive , instead link presence opioid receptor lung modulate afferent input brain , thereby favourably influence perceive dyspnea .</detailed_description>
