	<brief_title>Contractile Cross Sectional Areas Muscle Strength Patients With Inherited Muscle Diseases</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Patients inherited muscle disease several miscellaneous problem muscle , structural metabolic . Depending specific disease multiple symptom may present . All different disease affect contractility muscle . Examples inherited muscle disease congenital myopathy RYR1-myopathy , afflict muscle fiber structure . They first subgroups inherited muscle disease investigate study . Congenital myopathy hereditary relatively non-progressive disease . Hypotonia clinical characteristic congenital myopathy often present already neonatal period . Almost patient generalized muscle weakness hypotonia . The various subtypes congenital myopathy broad group disorder define predominance particular specific structural abnormality show muscle biopsy . Based genetic morphological feature , divide four main group ; one central core , one central nucleus , one minicores one nemaline body . RYR1-myopathy caused mutation RYR-gene . The RYR1-protein important make RYR1-receptors channel responsible transport calcium atom within muscle cell , particularly muscle contraction . Patients typically present limb weakness , decrease fetal movement skeletal abnormality . About 70 % patient malignant hyperthermia mutation RYR1-gene . MRI finding often include involvement different muscle thigh calf .</detailed_description>
