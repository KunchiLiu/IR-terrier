	<brief_summary>Homozygous Familial Hypercholesterolemia ( HoFH ) rare genetic metabolic disorder characterize markedly elevate LDL-cholesterol ( LDL-C ) level , result severe atherosclerosis often leading early onset cardiovascular disease . The frequent cause mutation LDL receptor gene ( LDLR ) . LDL-C level remain frequently acceptable level despite treatment multiple exist lipid lower drug and/or LDL apheresis . Thus , functional replacement defective LDLR via AAV-based liver-directed gene therapy may viable approach treat disease improve response current lipid-lowering treatment . The purpose protocol identify screen potential candidate future enrollment gene therapy clinical trial . No study drug administer screen study .</brief_summary>
