	<brief_summary>Background : Atopic dermatitis ( AD ) skin disease also call eczema . It common child sometimes get well . However , chronic AD may cause asthma , food allergy , eye infection , sleep problem . The cause AD might relate bacteria live skin . Researchers want see introduce bacteria , R mucosa , healthy skin onto skin someone AD help treat disease . Objective : To test safety activity R mucosa treat AD . Eligibility : Part 1 : People age 18 old AD Part 2 : Children age 7 17 AD Design : Participants screen : Medical history Physical exam Examination AD Blood urine test At baseline visit , participant blood test photos take skin . They get supply R mucosa memory aid track dose record feeling . Part 2 participant guardian complete questionnaire child AD . Part 1 participant spray R mucosa arm twice per week 6 week . Part 2 guardian spray child arm twice per week 16 week . Participants follow-up visit repeat baseline test review memory aid : Part 1 : Six week baseline visit Part 2 : Four time 16 week ; 2 3 time 1 year Participants call emailed discus feeling : Part 1 : About 30 day last visit Part 2 : About every 10 day visit</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Beginning Assessment Cutaneous Treatment Efficacy Roseomonas Atopic Dermatitis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The underlie pathology atopic dermatitis ( AD ) consist defective skin barrier function , susceptibility Staphylococcus aureus skin infection , immune imbalance . There currently cure AD . Preclinical data mouse model AD suggest commensal Gram-negative bacteria ( CGN ) , Roseomonas mucosa , healthy source relieve symptom AD antimicrobial effect . In study , first evaluate safety R mucosa-based biotherapy young adult adult AD ( age 16+ year ) , evaluate safety efficacy R mucosa-based biotherapy child ( age 7-16 year ) AD . Participants receive twice-weekly dos CGN biotherapy 6 week ( part 1 , dose escalation 2 4 week ) 4 month ( part 2 , possible dose escalation 4 8 week ) . Participants part 1 contact 30 plus-minus 10 day end treatment assessment safety . Participants part 2 also follow 1 year end treatment evaluation long-term efficacy safety . This first study test cutaneous live biotherapeutic product AD . We hypothesize alter strain CGN skin people AD improve patient clinical outcome . We expect serious toxicity R mucosa rarely pathogenic ; report case bacteremia typically associate percutaneous catheter immunocompromised patient , exclude study .</detailed_description>
