	<detailed_description>Background information The PROVIDE study test hypothesis low vitamin D level increase inflammatory activity pregnant woman contributes increase risk preeclampsia postpartum depression ( PPD ) . Preeclampsia multisystem disorder pregnancy commonly characterize hypertension occur 20 week gestation woman previously normal blood pressure accompany proteinuria . One pathway think lead preeclampsia chronic subclinical inflammation . Likewise , inflammation elevate woman major depressive disorder ( MDD ) PPD may therefore common physiological pathway connect depression preeclampsia . In addition , vitamin D deficiency , common pregnancy postpartum period associate depressive symptomatology , prenatal inflammation adverse birth outcome , particularly preeclampsia . Research show vitamin D act anti-inflammatory agent regulate placental function promote tolerance fetus . Prior work demonstrate among woman elevate prenatal inflammation , high prenatal vitamin D status associate low PPD symptom . This research test hypothesis vitamin D deficiency place woman high level inflammatory cytokine high risk preeclampsia PPD . Findings substantial impact provide new information inflammatory mechanism implicate development preeclampsia PPD , support future research , vitamin D supplementation reduce risk preeclampsia depression . The study also seek well understand several important biopsychosocial consequence develop preeclampsia . In pregnancy , 8-13 % woman diagnose MDD , lead postpartum depression ( PPD ) adverse birth outcome , specifically low birth weight preeclampsia . Although maternal depression associate negative consequence mother , infant family , low rate diagnosis treatment perinatal depression common medical setting . Rapid diagnosis treatment essential episode lengthy psychosocial symptom ( include anxiety ) increase duration disorder . Screening important first step pathway treatment . This study test acceptability benefit mental health screening , education referral program woman without preeclampsia . With assistance community partner , Maternal Mental Health-NOW ( formerly L.A. County Perinatal Mental Health Task Force ) , finding provide valuable patient center qualitative quantitative data use future service planning . This timely work . In 2015 ACOG recommend clinician screen patient least perinatal period depression anxiety symptom . Post-traumatic stress symptom particularly common experience adverse pregnancy outcome , approximately 9 % develop Post-traumatic stress disorder ( PTSD ) . Increased risk major depression ( 40-50 % ) comorbid PTSD lead decrease maternal bonding infant long term adverse mental physical health repercussion mother , child family . Screening therefore must couple appropriate follow-up treatment indicate , system place ensure follow-up diagnosis treatment . Most recently ( 2016 ) , US Preventive Services Task Force ( USPSTF ) make perinatal depression screen recommendation , add data lack accuracy screen benefit harm treatment pregnant woman . The author highlight research need assess barrier establish adequate system care barrier address . Very little known patient perspective regard acceptance benefit mental health screening . There even less understanding variation preference need service woman experience preeclampsia , PPD rate even high . The perinatal period opportune time screen mental health education due frequency contact health care provider , unfortunately rate diagnosis treatment perinatal depression low medical setting . New parent often highly motivate seek help effect change sake offspring potential reduction intergenerational family dysfunction . The perinatal period thus provide clinician unique opportunity consider universal psychosocial assessment part mainstream maternity postnatal care . Early identification treatment psychosocial morbidity especially important relation function family unit critical parent-infant relationship potential positively impact health next generation . Routine depression screen referral support RCTs Primary Care . RCT work conduct perinatal period OB/GYN setting , however screening , education , referral program obstetric setting well accept patient . Overall , mental health care might acceptable provided part routine obstetrical care . Mental health screen treatment might also beneficial subset woman experience adverse pregnancy complication . Results mental health screen program allow early identification intervention time woman high risk mental health complication , adverse complication preeclampsia . Objectives purpose To knowledge , study comprehensively investigate anti-inflammatory role vitamin D depress reproductive aged woman , association adverse pregnancy outcome . Findings substantial impact provide new information inflammatory mechanism implicate development preeclampsia PPD , support future intervention research , include vitamin D supplementation , focus alleviating effect . Additionally , test acceptability effectiveness new mental health screening , education referral program Cedars-Sinai Medical Center ( CSMC ) provide valuable patient center qualitative quantitative data use future service planning . PROVIDE study hypothesis test new cohort ( N=200 ) recruit third trimester CSMC Childbirth Education class , Prenatal Diagnostic Center ( PDC ) , Maternal-Fetal Care Unit ( MFCU , diagnose Preeclampsia ) ; follow delivery 2 time point ( 4 week 3 month ) postpartum . A targeted sampling strategy two-year period result 100 woman experience preeclampsia 100 woman . Specific Aim 1 : Determine extent prenatal vitamin D deficiency ( define clinically serum 25 ( OH ) D &lt; 20 ng/ml48 ) associate increase prenatal inflammatory cytokine ( e.g . hs-CRP Interleukin-6 ) , prenatal depressive symptom , preeclampsia . Hypothesis : Women experience low prenatal vitamin D level exhibit increase likelihood experience prenatal depression , preeclampsia , postpartum depression . These effect greatest high level prenatal inflammatory cytokine . Specific Aim 2 : Determine extent woman preeclampsia increase postpartum inflammatory cytokine , vitamin D deficiency PPD . Hypothesis : Compared experience preeclampsia , woman preeclampsia high postpartum level inflammatory cytokine , low postpartum vitamin D level , increase symptom PPD . Specific Aim 3 : Determine extent mental health program include screening , education referral acceptable pregnant woman effective reduce symptom postpartum depression , anxiety and/or stress follow preeclampsia . Hypothesis : Women preeclampsia + depression group rate mental health program acceptable beneficial , follow referral suggestion depressed-only group .</detailed_description>
