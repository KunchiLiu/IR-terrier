	<detailed_description>Background The ability identify patient sleep disorder recognize increasingly important give association cardiovascular disease impact daytime function quality life . The Center Disease Control recently characterize insufficient sleep public health issue , also estimate 1 25 adult admit fall asleep drive give month . 50 70 million Americans affected chronic sleep disorder intermittent sleep problem , yet sleep problem under-recognized ; example , 80 90 % adult sleep disordered breathing remain undiagnosed . Sleep disorder screening tool available , often limited follow factor : 1 . Surveys may extensive thereby limit utilization 2 . Screening tool often target specific sleep disorder ( e.g . obstructive sleep apnea ( OSA ) ) rather comprehensively screen wide range sleep disorder 3 . Screening tool may useful assess outcomes follow-up care The study investigator propose development sleep vital sign ( VS ) construct simple-to-use survey tool assist primary care identify patient sleep disorder potentially useful assess response treatment . A simple use Sleep VS potentially benefit patient , make impact public health , assist primary care provider recognize care patient potential sleep disorder . Study Proposal This study investigate use sleep VS ( subjective patient report metric ) potential tool identify patient sleep disorder measure outcomes follow-up care . This pilot study structure 3-arm randomized clinical trial follow specific aim : 1 . To determine whether subjective sleep vital sign improve rate identify patient sleep disorder primary care set . 2 . To determine subjective sleep vital sign track patient therapy response various sleep disorder . 3 . To correlate subjective sleep vital sign result validate sleep measurement ( e.g . sleep survey , Continuous Positive Airway Pressure ( CPAP ) usage ) . Methods Study Design : This study 3-arm randomized clinical trial . Patients check primary care clinic assign Active Sleep VS Pathway , Non-Active Sleep VS Pathway , Usual Care . Randomization occur group randomization clinic assign follow one three pathway day ( 1:1:1 ratio ) . Block randomization also utilized order ensure balance enrollment three pathway . Active Sleep VS Pathway : Patients provide Sleep VS survey packet check ( packet include : Sleep VS , sleep-wake assessment , Epworth Sleepiness Scale ( ESS ) , Functional Outcomes Sleep Questionnaire 10 ( FOSQ-10 ) , Insomnia Severity Index ( ISI ) ) -- standard survey use clinically . The propose Sleep VS base follow 2 question : 1 . How many day week participant satisfy his/her sleep ? 2 . How many day week sleepiness problem ? For purpose study , Sleep VS consider positive screen patient satisfy sleep less half week ( ≤4 day ) sleepiness problem least half week ( ≥4 day ) . Medical assistant review Sleep VS , patient screen positive : 1 . Asked extended set sleep question ( see ) 2 . Brought attention primary care physician . Expanded questionnaire 1 . Does participant snore wake sleep gasping ? 2 . Does participant frequent problem fall asleep stay asleep ? 3 . Does participant regularly get less 6 hour sleep per night ? 4 . Is participant shift worker ? 5 . Do leg restlessness creepy-crawly sensation give participant problem sleep ? 6 . Does participant take three medication depression and/or sleep ? 7 . Does doze awake regularly impact participant 's ability function ? A triaging algorithm available base answer extend sleep question assist primary care physician assessment triaging care . Patients primarily triaged sleep medicine ( OSA assessment , complex insomnia patient , patient complex sleep disorder ) , health education 4-week cognitive behavioral therapy ( CBT ) program less complex insomnia , remain care primary care physician . At sleep medicine health education appointment , patient ask complete sleep vital sign survey packet . Patients screen `` negative '' ask extended sleep question bring attention primary care physician proceed `` usual care . '' If course `` usual care '' , potential sleep disorder discuss , extend sleep question triaging algorithm still utilized assist determine management . Non- Active Sleep VS Pathway : At time check-in , patient also provide Sleep vital sign survey packet . However , packet collect receptionist unavailable primary care medical assistant physician , patient proceed `` usual care '' . If course `` usual care '' , potential sleep disorder discuss , extend sleep question triaging algorithm still utilized assist determine management . Usual Care Pathway : Patients provide sleep VS packet check-in . If course usual care , potential sleep disorder discuss , extend sleep question triaging algorithm still utilized assist determine management . Statistical Analysis This pilot study without pre-existing data determine power calculation . The study investigator intend enroll 2000 patient study . Given high prevalence sleep disorder ( estimate 20 % population chronic insomnia 16 % population OSA ) , anticipate 666 patient pathway allow u detect difference rate sleep diagnosis . Comparisons group analyze utilizing Student 's T-test appropriate give anticipated sample size even distribution skew . Correlations sleep VS data establish sleep metric ( e.g . survey , CPAP usage ) analyze scatter plot regression . Pearson 's correlation may apply relationship determined linear .</detailed_description>
