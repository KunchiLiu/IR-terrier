	<brief_summary>This study evaluate use N-acetylcysteine treatment alcohol cocaine use disorder . Alcohol user split two group , one receive active N-acetylcysteine placebo . The division occur cocaine user . The effect N-acetylcysteine adherence , abstinence , psychiatric symptom stress biomarkers evaluate .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Effect N-acetylcysteine Alcohol Cocaine Use Disorders : A Double-Blind Randomized Controlled Trial .</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>N-acetylcysteine act replenish human body glutathione storage . Glutathione important antioxidant agent , also modulate N-methyl-D-aspartate ( NMDA ) glutamatergic receptor . Glutamate associate neuroadaptation relate substance use disorder , thus consider potential target pharmacological intervention regard disorder . N-acetylcysteine also interact cystine-glutamate antiporter astrocyte hence increase glutamate release extracellular space . N-acetylcysteine effect implication addiction disorder study initially animal model . Glutamate level normalization N-acetylcysteine reduce compulsive drug self-administration drug-seeking behavior mouse . In addition , promise result also human subject , show benefit cocaine , alcohol cannabis use disorder . This study consist randomize , double-blind , placebo control trial four arm : alcohol user divide NAC v Placebo cocaine user divide NAC v Placebo .</detailed_description>
