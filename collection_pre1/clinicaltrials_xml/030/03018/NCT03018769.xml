	<brief_title>Syndrome Differentiation Management Chronic Stable Coronary Artery Disease ( SCAD ) Improve Quality</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Chronic stable coronary artery disease ( SCAD ) general term kind coronary artery disease ( CAD ) include patient chronic stable angina , oldmyocardial infarction also stable condition revascularization ( i.e percutaneous coronary intervention （PCI） , coronary artery bypass graft （CABG） ) . According 2012 American Heart Association/American College Cardiology ( AHA/ACC ) guide , objective treatment SCAD maintain recover patient ' exercise tolerance , quality life avoid complication like heart failure，so decrease mortality , eliminate symptom avoid adverse reaction . Traditional Chinese medicine ( TCM ) two thousand year history manage CAD advantage improve quality life . Using scientific method evaluate , demonstrate conclude clinical curative effect TCM extremely important task TCM Chinese western integrative medicine win treatment CAD . Recent research mainly focus certain type certain pathological physiological stage CAD , bad still , different area expert experience opinion treatment . There lack unified syndrome differentiation prescription plan chronic stable CAD enough attention pay TCM despite many advantage improve quality life patient . Considering , research study past syndrome research result real clinical effective chronic SCAD case . Cases analyse explore , effective case filter , syndrome differentiation prescription refine , thus build TCM diagnosis treatment information database .</detailed_description>
