	<detailed_description>Idiopathic Membranous nephropathy ( IMN ) immune-mediated glomerular disease characterize deposition IgG4 antibodies subepithelial area glomerular basement membrane ( GBM ) . Proteinuria hallmark disease . The common presentation IMN nephrotic syndrome preserve kidney function . The natural course disease variable may punctuate spontaneous remission relapse . In 20 % patient , spontaneous complete remission nephrotic syndrome , another 15-20 % undergo partial remission ; 30 % patient may remain fluctuate proteinuria 30 % may progress end-stage renal disease ( ESRD ) . However , data natural history study placebo arm intervention study follow-up last 10 year show 30-40 % untreated patient persistent nephrotic syndrome progress ESRD . Complete remission nephrotic syndrome predicts excellent long-term kidney patient survival , partial remission also significantly reduce risk progression ESRD . Therefore , persist remission nephrotic state acceptable surrogate end-point ass efficacy treatment . The primary aim treatment , therefore , induce last reduction proteinuria . The best-validated regimen combination therapy corticosteroid cyclophosphamide ( `` Ponticelli '' regimen ) . This treatment superior supportive therapy alone induce remission prevent long-term decline kidney function patient idiopathic MN persist nephrotic syndrome . However , concern use cyclophosphamide , since use may associate adverse event , lead treatment interruption 9 % patient . These adverse event include bone marrow suppression , gonadal toxicity , infection oncogenic effect . Thus , availability alternative therapy highly effective great safety profile desirable . Recent human study confirm MN autoimmune disease , suggest disease may trigger isotype specific autoantibody direct podocyte enzyme podocyte receptor recognize antigen , include M-type phospholipase-2 receptor ( PLA2R1 ) thrombospondin type 1 domain-containing 7A ( THSD7A ) . The podocyte expression autoantigens trigger production specific antibody situ deposit immune complex , consequent activation complement cascade , oxygen radical , inflammatory pathway lead tissue injury fibrosis . Additional autoantibody , direct podocyte neo-expressed cytoplasm protein describe , include aldose reductase ( AR ) , Mn-superoxide dismutase ( SOD2 ) alpha-enolase ( alpha-ENO ) . However , mechanism elicit expression neoantigens podocytes regulate deposition auto-antibodies subepithelial surface glomerular basement membrane know . Considering potential role IgG antibodies pathogenesis IMN , B cell depletion may favourably impact glomerular disease reflect reduction proteinuria . The anti-CD20 monoclonal antibody Rituximab selective B cell deplete agent , capable maintain B cell undetectable 3-12 month . There evidence strategy effective treatment disease B cell play key role , ANCA-related vasculitis humoral allograft rejection . Preliminary study IMN promising , observational study provide encouraging data ; addition , drug seem well tolerate minimal adverse event . Head-to-head comparison Rituximab steroid plus ciclophosphamide randomized clinical trial miss . The investigator propose study order test randomize control trial hypothesis selective B lymphocyte depletion obtain Rituximab effective cyclical corticosteroid/alkylating-agent therapy induce long-term remission proteinuria patient undergoing initial treatment IMN nephrotic syndrome . In addition , since specific assay above-mentioned autoantibody available , level pathogenetic autoantibody measure baseline treatment . Finally , study compare safety profile steroid plus cyclophosphamide Rituximab evaluate rate severity adverse event . Design Power Considerations The investigator hypothesize remission probability RTX arm great active comparator group ( superiority design ) . Available data ( Ponticelli 1998 ) suggest probability complete remission standard therapy 15 % one year . The investigator plan enroll 70 patient pilot RCT . This sample size able detect power 80 % ( two-sided P 0.05 ) odds ratio 3 , i.e . change probability 0.15 0.45 - optimistic effect . Smaller ( likely reasonable ) effect would require large study . The study provide estimate true effect , exist . Adverse effect : Patients directly question every two week drug exposure monthly interval follow-up . In addition contact number provide subject call experience adverse affect suspect adverse effect time specific visit Definition Of Proteinuric Status UP = urinary protein ( g/24h ) Complete remission ( CR ) UP ≤ 0.3 g Partial remission ( PR ) : Reduction UP &gt; 50 % plus final UP ≤ 3.5 g &gt; 0.3g Non-response ( NR ) : Reduction UP &lt; 50 % ( include increase UP &lt; 50 % ) Neither CR PR Progression : Proteinuria /S . creatinine increase &gt; 50 % baseline</detailed_description>
