	<brief_summary>This randomized phase II trial study well medroxyprogesterone acetate without entinostat surgery work treat patient endometrioid endometrial cancer . Medroxyprogesterone acetate progesterone , hormone produce body normally . Entinostat may stop growth tumor cell block enzymes need cell growth . Given medroxyprogesterone acetate without entinostat may work well treat patient endometrioid endometrial cancer .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Medroxyprogesterone Acetate With Without Entinostat Before Surgery Treating Patients With Endometrioid Endometrial Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To determine whether addition histone deacetylase inhibitor , entinostat , combination medroxyprogesterone acetate ( Depo-Provera ) pre-operative set result up-regulation activated progesterone receptor ( PR ) compare Depo-Provera alone . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . To assess response rate ( measure cellular morphology proliferation ) change activate receptor level addition entinostat time hysterectomy . OUTLINE : Patients randomize 1 2 arm . ARM I : Patients receive medroxyprogesterone acetate intramuscularly ( IM ) day 1 undergo hysterectomy day 21-24 . ARM II : Patients receive medroxyprogesterone acetate IM day 1 entinostat orally ( PO ) day 1 , 8 , 15 . Patients undergo hysterectomy day 21-24 .</detailed_description>
