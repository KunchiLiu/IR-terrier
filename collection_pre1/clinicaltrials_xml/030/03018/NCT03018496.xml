	<brief_title>Investigating Effects Beta-Hydroxy-Beta-Methylbutyrate Glucose Handling Older Younger Men .</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>One change associate human age reduction `` fitness '' , term far quickly person run/cycle/swim also well blood vessel work . Additionally person 's metabolic fitness decrease ; well body cope nutrition , example , old people high risk disease like type 2 diabetes . Previous study show people become less fit , increased risk suffer complication whilst undergo surgery . It also show measure fit someone , good predict risk surgical complication purely use person 's age alone . Lots research show exercise potentially reverse age-related decline fitness , however use long session continuous exercise long period time . High-intensity interval training ( HIT ) , whereby people cycle exercise bike hard minute , follow short rest , repeat course 15 minute rapidly improve person 's fitness . However everyone able , indeed want participate exercise strenuous ; therefore research seek explore whether option , dietary supplement improve aspect fitness This study intend examine effect give dietary supplement way person 's body handle glucose ( carbohydrates/ sugar ) meal . Previous work show take beta-hydroxy beta-methyl butyrate ( HMB ) supplement may improve may improve patient 's response glucose , however evidence clear . HMB commercially available nutritional supplement provide compound body produce time protein consume , commonly use bodybuilder help gain muscle .</detailed_description>
