	<brief_summary>The aim multicenter , randomize control trial evaluate weaning time mechanical ventilation compare non-variable PSV , variable PSV , Smart CareTM . This study multicenter randomize control open trial compare variable , non-variable pressure support ventilation Smart CareTM patient receive mechanical ventilation 24 hour able wean . The aim study determine duration wean mechanical ventilation one mention wean method</brief_summary>
