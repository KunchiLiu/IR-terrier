	<brief_summary>We aim show systematic ultrasonography perform ventilated patient suspect ventilation-acquired pneumonia could improve accuracy diagnostic pneumonia , help define diagnostic tracheobronchitis lower respiratory tract infection consider . Chest CT scan often perform admission ICU , usually show abnormality reveal later standard radiograph . This last exam traditionally consider gold standard prove new pulmonary infiltrates , correlation parenchymal consolidation pretty low , lead over-diagnosing pneumonia , thus lead massive maybe sometimes unconsidered prescription antibiotic therapy . Lung ultrasonography conduct systematically within 3 first day suspcion pneumonia could help make difference real infection-linked lesion , banal abnormality follow hydric inflation intra-thoracic organ , instance pulmonary edema pleural effusion . An independent evaluation use lung ultrasound , analysis CT scan acquisition perform , compare physician charge patient appreciation suggest provide probability pneumonia upon routine clinical biological data .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>CT Scan Lung Ultrasonography Improve Diagnostic Ventilation Acquired Pneumonia ICU</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Diagnostic VAP tracheobronchitis often difficult UC mechanical ventilation , usually occur quite early initial phase hemodynamic instability , characterize need massive fluid support drug infusion . The goldstandard still standard chest X-ray , provide picture whole abnormality due cardiac failure , cardiogenic pulmonary edema . The high rate water chest patient ventilation assistance hemodynamic support responsible misinterpretation abnormality visualize radiograph . It often consider Lung ultrasonography useful appreciate involvement pleural effusion , explaning etiology hypoxemia , cardiac failure exclude simultaneous ultrasonographic evaluation . However , well recognize pulmonary parenchyma explore echography , provide lot information amount liquid inside , default aeration . Thus , real time help physician guide therapeutic manage ventilation well . Moreover , suspicion infection , clinically biologically lead early prescription antibiotic , give radiography abnormal . Knowing parenchymal consolidation rather effusion certain degree pulmonary edema could help avoid treat falsely respiratory infection . The thought hold concern Chest CT Scan , exam often realize early stage management critical situation . We take grant occur 48 first hour resuscitation , exam show certain number case preexist abnormality , reveal severla hour later Chest radiograph , suspicion respiratory infection acquire ventilation emerge . If take account abnormality see radiograph correlate could see CT , certain delay , de novo , could lead overestimate ventilation acquire pneumonia , criteria new radiographic infiltrate wo n't valid anymore . The diagnostic tracheobronchitis could appropriate certain number situation . Our aim verify retrospectively adjudication committee , early CT Scan , within 2 first day admission patient ventilate and/or suspicion lower respiratory tract infection , systematic lung ultrasonographic evaluation , provide independent operator , could change appreciation frequency ventilation-acquired pneumonia , compare appreciation th physician charge patient . We thus conduct repeat evaluation , day 0 , day 3 day 7 ultrasonography , order give probability pneumonia tracheobronchitis echographist operator , suggest physician give probability base clinical biological routine data . We measure rate agreement two part , see far systematic evaluation use pleural ultrasonography could help define probability infection , validate diagnostic pneumonia . The impact improve accuracy within first day 2 3 day suspicion , repeat , possible operator . One main benefit could reduction well reevaluation antibiotic therapy , diagnostic pneumonia reject secondary , eventually short course treatment could choose , even point deserve evaluate study .</detailed_description>
