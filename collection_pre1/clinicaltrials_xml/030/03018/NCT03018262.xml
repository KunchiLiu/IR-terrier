	<brief_summary>Background : Movement disorder many different cause symptom . Researchers still fully understand part brain involve fine movement . They want learn brain region could abnormal people movement disorder . Objective : To good understand brain control movement . Eligibility : Healthy , right-handed adult age 18-70 year old . Design : Participants screen physical exam question handedness . They may urine test . Participants 1 2 clinic visit . The first visit last 1.5 hour . The second last 3 hour . Participants structural magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) . A strong magnetic field radio wave take picture brain . Participants lie table slide metal cylinder . Participants may transcranial magnetic stimulation . A wire coil hold scalp . A brief electrical current pass coil create magnetic pulse stimulate brain . Participants wear pair glass headband small sensor researcher track head position . Participants perform simple index finger movement task . Participants may surface electromyography least two hand muscle . Small metal disk adhesive pad electrode tap skin . Participants seat comfortable chair hand place pillow . Participants may electroencephalography . A cap small disc electrode place scalp .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Neurophysiology Surround Inhibition Human Motor Cortex</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Objectives : The purpose protocol improve understanding neurophysiological mechanism underlie phenomenon surround inhibition human motor cortex . It known patient focal hand dystonia abnormal motor surround inhibition . However , physiology phenomenon still remain unclear . The 2 sub-studies propose protocol integrate several neurophysiological technique explore different aspect motor surround inhibition . The objective sub-study 1 ( ) identify EEG correlate motor SI ( b ) determine relationship short interval intracortical inhibition ( SICI ) SI , compromise patient FHD ( c ) determine oscillatory frequency band relevant SI . The result sub-study shed light inhibitory mechanisms critical motor SI . Sub-study 2 aim determine influence parietal conditioning motor surround inhibition . If conditioning parietal cortex enhances SI , conclude parieto-motor inhibitory network may involve motor SI network could affect focal hand dystonia . Study population : We intend study 52 healthy volunteer total . Up 17 participant recruit sub-study 1 35 sub-study 2 . Design : Sub-study 1 : This exploratory study . Participants perform auditory cue index finger movement task motor evoke potential elicit stimulate motor hotspot surround muscle use transcranial magnetic stimulation ( TMS ) . EEG record continuously . Single pair TMS pulse ( postero-anterior antero-posterior current ) deliver either subject rest movement onset . TMS-evoked potential ( TEPs ) obtain time-locked averaging trial condition . The amplitudes different peak TEP compare across condition may correlate degree SI SICI . The component TEP relevant motor SI thus identify . Sub-study 2 : This hypothesis-driven study . Our primary hypothesis parietal condition influence motor SI healthy volunteer . Participants perform auditory cue index finger movement task motor evoke potential elicit stimulate motor hotspot surround muscle use transcranial magnetic stimulation . Two coil , one position motor cortex inhibitory region inferior parietal lobule , deliver TMS pulse fix inter-stimulus interval . The pulse deliver either subject rest movement onset . The ratio mean MEP amplitude obtain parietal conditioning obtain motor cortex stimulation alone movement onset reveal parieto-motor influence SI . Outcome measure : For sub-study 1 , outcome measure ( 1 ) amplitude different TEP peak ( 2 ) degree surround inhibition short interval intracortical inhibition ( 3 ) correlation relevant peak amplitude ( 4 ) power cortico-cortical coherence different frequency band . MEP amplitude primary outcome measure sub-study 2 .</detailed_description>
