	<brief_summary>Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease ( COPD ) progressive inflammatory disease airway , associate poor health status , functional disability , significant morbidity , increase risk death . In Ontario , COPD lead cause hospital admission readmission , cost health system approximately 3 billion dollar annually . Individuals COPD experience increase 'flare-up 's ' ( acute exacerbation ) disease worsens , characterize period increase shortness breath , cough , phlegm production , weakness . Acute exacerbation COPD ( AECOPD ) commonly cause viral bacterial infection , often require patient seek attention emergency room hospital treatment . Current treatment prevent COPD exacerbation modestly effective . New therapy need improve quality life clinical outcome individual live COPD . Previous research center show favourable effect antibody treatment ( immunoglobulin ) frequency AECOPD , doctor visit , treatment , hospitalization COPD patient . However , rigorous study patient required confirm effect . The investigator propose clinical trial evaluate immunoglobulin treatment outpatient frequent exacerbation . In study investigator determine immunoglobulin treatment feasible , safe , tolerable , potentially effective reduce frequency acute exacerbation . If study feasible potentially effective , inform large study confirm therapeutic effect immunoglobulin treatment , would major advance care COPD .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Feasibility Safety Immunoglobulin ( Ig ) Treatment COPD Outpatients With Frequent Exacerbations : Pilot Study 1</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>COPD incurable respiratory disease characterize progressive decline lung function , shortness breath , exercise limitation , poor health status , increase mortality . The World Health Organization cite Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease ( COPD ) third lead cause death worldwide , estimate suggest currently affect 65 million people . COPD lead cause hospital admission readmission North America , cost health system 50 billion dollar annually . Patients COPD experience episodic flare disease , know acute exacerbation ( AECOPD ) . AECOPD characterize increase cough , shortness breath , sputum production , weakness , worsen airflow obstruction . There also high degree systemic inflammation immune system activation exacerbation . As severity COPD increase , frequency exacerbation increase well . However , major predictor recurrent exacerbation history exacerbation . COPD exacerbation significant impact individual patient health system . Previous study show patient exacerbation experience reduction quality life , ability engage activity daily live , worsen lung function increase risk mortality exacerbation period . Exacerbation event often cause patient seek acute medical attention admission hospital , drive high health care cost . History hospital admission due AECOPD strong risk factor readmission recurrent AECOPD within one year . Hospitalization AECOPD also associate low 3-year survival ( 82.1 % ; 95 % CI , 78.1 % - 86.4 % ) compare COPD patient without history hospitalization ( 92 % ; 95 % CI , 90.8 % - 93.3 % ) previous 3 year independent severity airflow limitation . As result , research focus method prevent reduce frequency acute exacerbation , expect positive impact patient health system . Unfortunately , cure COPD , highly effective therapy currently lack . The current GOLD COPD guideline recommend smoke cessation , exercise training , maximal bronchodilator therapy , influenza pneumococcal vaccination try prevent exacerbation . In patient frequent exacerbation , chronic macrolide therapy azithromycin , N-acetylcysteine roflumilast ( PDE-4 inhibitor ) show increase time next exacerbation . However , therapy modestly effective , patient continue experience exacerbation maximal therapy . Further research new therapeutic prevent reduce exacerbation imperative . The development new immunomodulatory agent adjuvant therapy prevent AECOPD become area intense investigation . Prolonged steroid use associate hypogammaglobulinemia asthmatic patient . Patients COPD low immunoglobulin G ( IgG ) level compare patient lung disease , independent oral steroid use age . However , recurrent exacerbation still occur despite normal baseline serum IgG ( data yet publish ) . Intravenous subcutaneous immunoglobulin ( IVIG SCIG , respectively ) prepare pooled plasma thousand healthy blood donor . The large donor pool ensure diversity antibody specificity wide spectrum antigens microbial pathogen . IVIG SCIG represent privilege source natural antibody ( NAb ) , occur absence autoimmune disease immunization . NAb immune defense pathogen also anti-inflammatory immunomodulatory activity . Given heighten systemic airway inflammatory activity patient COPD , propensity infection-triggered exacerbation , suppress mucosal systemic immunity , anti-inflammatory , anti-infective immunomodulatory effect Ig preparation could beneficial patient COPD . The investigator recently report retrospective single center self-interval analysis Ig treatment adjunctive preventative treatment AECOPD 14 patient . Half ( 8 patient ) least severe COPD GOLD criterion . Ig treatment significantly reduce moderate severe AECOPD 4.7 ± 3.1 0.6 ± 1.0 per patient-year . Number hospitalization markedly reduce twelve year prior one year follow Ig treatment initiation . Even though median baseline IgG level study cohort 5.9 g/L ( interquartile range 4.1 - 7.4 ) , 36 % IgG le 5 g/L , clinical effect Ig treatment reduce moderate severe AECOPD consistent across case . While demonstrates promise , prospective control study require determine Ig treatment could impact frequency COPD exacerbation .</detailed_description>
