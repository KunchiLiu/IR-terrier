	<brief_summary>Background : GBM refers specific kind brain cancer call glioblastoma . The standard treatment GBM radiation plus temozolomide , oral chemotherapy drug . Pembrolizumab immune therapy use treat cancer . The addition pembrolizumab standard treatment radiation temozolomide show well tolerated.. Researchers want see add vaccine make person tumor improve effect pembrolizumab . The vaccine develop fresh tumor take time surgery call HSPPC-96 . Objectives : To see add pembrolizumab HSPPC-96 improve standard treatment glioblastoma multiforme . Eligibility : Adults least 18 year old glioblastoma . Design : Participants screen typical cancer test : Brain scan Medical history Blood urine test Questions quality life symptom These test repeat throughout study . Participants surgery remove tumor . A tissue sample tumor send lab . A vaccine make . Some participant get pembrolizumab vaccine . Some get pembrolizumab placebo . Participants know get . Participants get radiation 6 week . Participants take temozolomide mouth treatment . Participants get pembrolizumab IV 30 minute 3 time radiation cycle . Participants keep take 2 drug every week year . Some may take pembrolizumab additional year . Most participant get vaccine placebo radiation . They get 5 time 6 week . Some participant continue get vaccine every week 1 2 year . Participants repeat screen test stop study treatment . They also follow-up phone call .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Radiation Therapy Plus Temozolomide Pembrolizumab With Without HSPPC-96 Newly Diagnosed Glioblastoma ( GBM )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Background : - Malignant glioma unfortunately , case , uniformly fatal tumor . Despite aggressive surgery , radiation treatment ( RT ) chemotherapy initial diagnosis tumor almost always recur . - Many clinical trial glioblastoma ( GBM ) evaluate addition agent ( ) standard therapy consist concurrent radiation temozolomide chemotherapy maximal surgical resection patient newly diagnose disease salvage chemotherapy either rechallenge temozolomide alternative alkylating agent CCNU cisplatin . To date , none combination strategy demonstrate clinical benefit . Furthermore , subject unmethylated MGMT ( O6-methylguanine-DNA methyltransferase ) promoter temozolomide modest benefit salvage therapy demonstrate significant impact subject group underscore need research . - Immunotherapy offer promise improve outcome patient GBM evoke specific immune response may produce sustained less toxic effect conventional therapy . Heat-shock protein ( HSPs ) , function intracellular chaperone , use deliver variety tumor antigen antigen present cell immune stimulation . - Heat Shock Protein-Peptide Complex-96 ( HSPPC-96 ) consist heat shock protein glycoprotein-96 ( HSP gp-96 ) wide array chaperon protein , include autologous antigenic peptide ( aka vaccine ) . Heat shock protein ( HSP ) molecules respond cellular stress counteract abnormal protein fold . They know modulate immune response , especially HSP gp-96 . In stressful environment , tumor , HSPs upregulated highly express tumor cell . This protect tumor lead resistance therapy . HSP expression associate cellular proliferation , apoptosis evasion , tissue invasion , metastasis , angiogenesis . - Pembrolizumab potent highly selective humanize monoclonal antibody ( mAb ) IgG4/kappa isotype design directly block interaction PD-1 ligands , PD-L1 PD-L2 . Additionally , pembrolizumab think also activity peripherally circulate T-effector cell reverse lymphocyte exhaustion . It currently FDA approve use patient unresectable metastatic melanoma disease progression follow ipilimumab , BRAF V600 mutation positive , BRAF inhibitor NSCLC elevate PDL1 tumor . recurrent metastatic HNSCC disease progression platinum-containing chemotherapy . It also FDA approve advanced ( metastatic ) non-small cell lung cancer ( NSCLC ) whose disease progress treatment tumor express protein call PD-L1 treatment patient recurrent metastatic head neck squamous cell carcinoma ( HNSCC ) disease progression platinum-containing chemotherapy - This study first evaluate combination vaccine ( HSPPC-96 ) PD- 1 inhibition ( pembrolizumab ) newly diagnose GBM patient whose tumor MGMT promotor unmethylated isocytrate dehydrogenase ( IDH ) wildtype ; provide important data immune-modulatory effect combination . This may particular value patient high peripheral PD-L1 expression , also value PD-1 add standard GBM therapy . As vaccine need generate patient tumor , patient need identify prior surgery . Eligibility : - Newly diagnose GBM MRI ( MRI finding consistent GBM ) Histologically confirm newly diagnose GBM treat would benefit surgical resection . - Tumor must supratentorial . - GBM diagnosis must make surgical excision ( stereotactic biopsy allow unless plan second surgery remove great equal 80 % tumor ) patient tumor must MGMT promotor methylation must IDH wildtype . - No prior treatment radiation chemotherapy GBM . - Age great equal 18 year day signing inform consent Objective : - The primary endpoint determine whether OS rate 12 month improve newly diagnose unmethylated GBM patient treat RT + TMZ + Pembrolizumab follow TMZ + Pembrolizumab + HSPPC-96 vaccine Placebo vaccine . Design : - This randomize , double blind phase II trial RT + TMZ + Pembrolizumab follow TMZ + Pembrolizumab +/- HSPPC-96 newly diagnose GBM patient whose tumor unmethylated MGMT promotor IDH wildtype . - Subjects assign intervention base tumor resection ability generate vaccine follow : - If &lt; 80 % tumor remove , &lt; 5 g tumor resect HSPPC-96 generate , subject treat ancillary cohort RT+TMZ +Pembrolizumab follow TMZ+ Pembrolizumab . - If great equal 80 % contrasting enhanced tumor remove ( base T1 Post contrast MRI use cross sectional measurement ) , great equal 5 g tumor resect sufficient HSPPC-96 generate , subject include main cohort randomize 1:1 basis receive : 1 . RT+TMZ +Pembrolizumab follow TMZ+Pembrolizumab + Placebo OR 2 . RT+TMZ +Pembrolizumab follow TMZ+Pembrolizumab+HSPPC-96 - Approximately 8 potentially eligible patient see per month , anticipate least 1-2 per month accrue per site .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>INCLUSION CRITERIA : Pre Surgery ( Step 1 ) MRI finding consistent histologically confirm newly diagnose GBM treat would benefit surgical resection . As vaccine need generate patient tumor , patient need identify prior definitive surgery . Age great equal 18 year day signing inform consent . Karnofsky performance status great equal 70 % . Tumor must supratentorial . Stereotactic biopsy allow unless plan second surgery remove great equal 80 % tumor . No prior treatment radiation chemotherapy GBM . No prior treatment carmustine wafer . PostSurgery vaccine placebo ( Step 2 ) : Pathology must GBM , MGMT promoter region determine unmethylated IDH wild type . Greater equal 80 % resection contrast enhance tumor post operative MRI require randomization , otherwise treatment occur ancillary arm . Treatment must initiate great equal 14 day &lt; 6 week surgery . Craniotomy site must adequately heal free drainage cellulitis , underlie cranioplasty must appear intact time radiation . Radiation must start within 6 week surgery . Dexamethasone dose less equal 4 mg/day steroid equivalent prior start treatment . If high dos need , consult Study Chair .
