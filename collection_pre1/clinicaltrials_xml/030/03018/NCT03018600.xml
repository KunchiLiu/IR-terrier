	<brief_summary>Glucocorticoid widely use clinical treatment . Recently , research glucose fluctuation low-dose pulse steroid therapy elderly patient active autoimmune disease . Through prospective trial , investigator want know blood glucose characteristic high dosage glucocorticoid ( 1-2 mg/kg/day prednisone equivalent ) young patient ( 30-40 year ) active autoimmune disease without low-dose glucocorticoid maintenance . The investigator use continuous glucose monitoring 72 hour get well understand glucose level .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Continuous Glucose Monitoring Patients With Active Autoimmune Diseases Following High-dose Predisone Treatment</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>As know , dosage duration glucocorticoid influence glucose level different disease . Continuous glucose monitoring become newly effective technology well understand glucose level . In study , investigator enrol 25 patient certain active autoimmune diseases high-dosage glucocorticoid therapy Peking Union Medical College Hospital . It do monitor three-day continuous glucose level hold continuous glucose monitoring system underneath skin , help show unique picture fluctuation . The participant divide two group accord glucocorticoid therapy . Group 1 enrol subject newly commence 1-2mg/kg/day prednisone-equivalent ( intravenous/oral methylpredisolone oral prednisone ) least five day . Group 2 enrol subject underwent less 15mg/day prednisone-equivalent glucocorticoid maintenance least 3 month treat high-dose glucocorticoid relapse study This finding useful suitable treatment control hyperglycemia young patient .</detailed_description>
