	<brief_summary>People cardiovascular risk ( CV ) factor ( obesity , diabetes , etc ... ) establish heart disease ( coronary heart disease chronic heart failure ) often cognitive dysfunction compare people without CV risk factor heart disease . Among mechanism , reduce cardiac output cerebral blood flow people suggest . The aim study compare rest cognitive function , maximal cardiopulmonary function , cardiac output cerebral hemodynamics exercise patient metabolic syndrome , coronary heart disease , heart failure vs. healthy subject .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Brain , Cardiac Hemodynamics Cognition During Exercise Subjects With Various Cardiovascular Profiles</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>All subject underwent baseline evaluation include medical history , physical examination measurement height weight , body composition fast blood sample . All subject perform cognitive test rest maximal cardiopulmonary exercise test ( CEPT ) gas exchange analysis . During CEPT , cerebral oxygenation ( measure near-infra red spectroscopy ) cardiac hemodynamics response ( impedance cardiography ) measure continuously .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Inclusion Criteria Healthy subject : MetS nodocumented CHD , males female , age &gt; 18 year include study , provide write informed consent sufficient initial physical intellectual capacity allow independent daily living . Patients MetS nodocumented CHD , males female , age &gt; 18 year include study , provide write informed consent sufficient initial physical intellectual capacity allow independent daily living . MetS define accord recent updated criterion ( Alberti et al . 2005 ) : presence least three five criterion , namely abdominal obesity ( waist circumference cutoff depend recently publish ethnicbased variation , triglyceride &gt; 1.70 mmol/l , decrease HDLcholesterol ( &lt; 1.0 mmol/l men &lt; 1.3 mmol/l woman ) , systolic blood pressure &gt; 130 mmHg diastolic blood pressure &gt; 85 mmHg , FPG &gt; 5.6 mmol/l . CHD patient , male female , age &gt; 18 year include study , provide write informed consent sufficient initial physical intellectual capacity allow independent daily living . Moreover , must document CHD ( prior myocardial infarction , prior coronary angiography angioplasty , document myocardial ischemia myocardial scintigraphy ) . Patients document stable chronic heart failure recruit show follow inclusion criterion : â‰¥18 year Left ventricular ejection fraction ( LVEF ) &lt; 40 % ( measure within 6 month enrolment MUGA Scan , echo radiological ventriculography ) NYHA functional class IIII Optimal therapy stable dos include betablocker ACE inhibitor ARA least 6 week prior investigation ( unless document rationale variation ) . Able perform symptom limit exercise test . Capacity willingness sign inform consent form . Exclusion criterion For healthy subject : lack express write consent metabolic syndrome coronary heart disease chronic systolic heart failure rest leave ventricular ejection fraction &lt; 40 % symptomatic aortic stenosis chronic atrial fibrillation malignant exertional arrhythmia noncardiopulmonary limitation exercise ( e.g : arthritis claudication ) severe exercise intolerance . For patient MetS : lack express write consent coronary heart disease chronic systolic heart failure rest leave ventricular ejection fraction &lt; 40 % symptomatic aortic stenosis chronic atrial fibrillation malignant exertional arrhythmia noncardiopulmonary limitation exercise ( e.g : arthritis claudication ) severe exercise intolerance . For patient CHD lack express write consent recent acute coronary event ( &lt; 3 month ) chronic systolic heart failure rest leave ventricular ejection fraction &lt; 40 % symptomatic aortic stenosis severe nonrevascularizable coronary disease include leave main coronary stenosis patient await coronary artery bypass surgery chronic atrial fibrillation presence permanent ventricular pacemaker malignant exertional arrhythmia noncardiopulmonary limitation exercise ( e.g : arthritis claudication ) severe exercise intolerance . For CHF patient : Any relative absolute contraindication exercise training among patient stable chronic heart failure accord current recommendation ( Working Group Cardiac Rehabilitation 2001 ) Fixedrate pacemaker ICD device heart rate limit set low exercise training target heart rate . Major cardiovascular event procedure within 3 month precede enrolment study . Atrial fibrillation Heart failure secondary significant uncorrected primary valvular disease ( except mitral regurgitation secondary LV dysfunction ) Heart failure secondary congenital heart disease obstructive cardiomyopathy .</criteria>
