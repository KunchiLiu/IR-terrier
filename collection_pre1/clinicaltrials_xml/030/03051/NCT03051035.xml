	<detailed_description>This phase 1 first-in-human ( FIH ) dose escalation study determine maximum tolerate dose ( MTD ) KO-947 subject locally advanced unresectable metastatic , relapse and/or refractory , non-hematological malignancy . If MTD identify , recommend phase 2 dose ( RP2D ) determine . In addition , two tumor specific extension cohort may conduct characterize safety tolerability KO-947 provide preliminary evidence anti-tumor activity . Screening evaluation complete follow signing informed consent within 4 week ( 28 day ) Cycle 1 Day 1 . Evaluations perform part standard care within 28 day dose prior consent need repeat . By sign consent form , study subject agree collection standard care health information . The study consist three part : dose escalation , MTD expansion tumor specific extension .</detailed_description>
