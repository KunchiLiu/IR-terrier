	<brief_title>Skeletal Muscle Atrophy Dysfunction Following Total Knee Arthroplasty</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Total knee arthroplasty ( TKA ) currently common elective surgery US increase frequency nearly five-fold 2030 3.5 million surgery annually . This surgery prevalent among old adult advance knee osteoarthritis ( OA ) increase explain primarily growth population . Although TKA reliably reduce joint pain , fail correct objectively-measured functional disability due , part , dramatic decline lower-extremity neuromuscular function early , postsurgical period . These deficit never fully remediate , remain year surgery contribute persistent disability . Despite detrimental effect TKA , fundamental skeletal muscle adaptation occur early , post-surgical period poorly define understudied currently widely-accepted , evidence-based intervention counter change . To address clinical problem , investigator goal application define skeletal muscle structural functional adaptation follow TKA whole body , tissue , cellular , organellar molecular level human effort identify factor contribute functional disability ass utility neuromuscular electrical stimulation ( NMES ) counter post-surgical muscle adaptation anatomic level . We hypothesize TKA fails remediate physical disability patient , part , profound skeletal muscle myofilament mitochondrial loss dysfunction develop early , post-surgical period . Moreover , investigator posit NMES improve functional recovery follow TKA counter early skeletal muscle adaptation . To test model , investigator evaluate participant knee OA prior follow TKA skeletal muscle structure function multiple anatomic level , patient randomize receive NMES sham control intervention first 5 week post-surgery .</detailed_description>
