	<brief_title>OptiCal Study -Optimizing Fecal Calprotectin Monitoring : Clinical Study Comparing CalproLab Against PhiCal Evaluating Its Association With Gut Microbiome</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Fecal Calprotectin become one frequently use biomarkers patient suffer Inflammatory Bowel Diseases . Although use monitoring disease activity therapeutic efficiency previously demonstrate , test performance optimize improve clinical accuracy . The PhiCal™ test quantitative ELISA measuring , human stool , concentration fecal calprotectin , neutrophilic protein marker mucosal inflammation . The PhiCal™ test use vitro diagnostic aid diagnosis inflammatory bowel disease ( Crohn 's disease Ulcerative Colitis ) , differentiate IBD irritable bowel syndrome . Recently , CalproLab™ vitro device become available provide great report range PhiCal™ . The OptiCal study aim test validate CalproLab™ assay PhiCal™ assay determine performance characteristic . Calprotectin valuable clinical marker inflammation . Calprotectin belong group calcium- bind neutrophil-derived protein . Calprotectin make 60 % cytosolic protein within neutrophil . It resistant bacterial degradation gut stable stool one week room temperature . Calprotectin noninvasive `` test choice '' quantify degree GI inflammation differentiate Irritable Bowel Syndrome ( IBS ) Inflammatory Bowel Disease ( IBD ) . Inflammatory bowel disease ( IBD ) consider result interplay host intestinal microbiota . Recently show microbiota vary along gradient increase intestinal inflammation ( indicated calprotectin level ) , associate reduce microbial richness , abundance butyrate producer , relative abundance Gram-positive bacteria ( especially Clostridium cluster IV XIVa ) . A significant association microbiota composition inflammation indicate set bacterial group predict calprotectin level . So , intestinal microbiota may represent potential biomarker correlate level inflammation therapeutic response need validate . - This study prospective case series patient either Crohn 's disease ulcerative colitis , Celiac Disease , Irritable Bowel Syndrome healthy control ( N=175 ) invite participate . - Participants receive home kit ( plain white plastic cup calprotectin sample collection ) stool sampling , return process Genova Diagnostics . All participant require complete patient survey , include collection kit . - Participants recruit UCLA Division Digestive Diseases . - All patient confirmation diagnosis accord publish clinical guideline standard care use gold standard diagnostics ( e.g . endoscopy ) - Stool specimen analyze fecal Calprotectin use CalproLab™ assay PhiCal™ assay . No blood draw test perform . - Patients undergo gut microbiome assessment utilize GI Effects™ 2200 Comprehensive Profile ( Genova Diagnostics ) .</detailed_description>
