	<brief_summary>This randomized phase IV trial study well human papillomavirus ( HPV ) vaccine therapy work interrupt progression patient high-grade vulvar anal lesion . Vaccines make HPV peptide antigen may help body build effective immune response kill tumor cell decrease chance vulvar anal lesion progress come back .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>HPV Vaccine Therapy Interrupting Progression Patients With High-Grade Vulvar Anal Lesions</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . Test recombinant human papillomavirus nonavalent vaccine ( 9vHPV vaccine ) deliver treatment high grade squamous intraepithelial lesion ( HSIL ) reduce risk histologically confirm recurrent neoplastic lesion ( HSIL ) 50 % vaccinate versus ( vs. ) placebo arm . II . Evaluate safety HPV vaccine HSIL participant . OUTLINE : Patients randomize 1 2 arm . ARM I : Patients receive recombinant human papillomavirus nonavalent vaccine intramuscularly ( IM ) baseline , 2 , 6 month . ARM II : Patients receive placebo IM baseline , 2 , 6 month . After completion study treatment , patient follow month 7 , 12 , 18 , 24 , 36 , 42 .</detailed_description>
