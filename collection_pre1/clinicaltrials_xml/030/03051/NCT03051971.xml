	<brief_summary>Delivery inhale short-acting bronchodilator ( SABD ) standard care emergency department ( ED ) exacerbation COPD , goal rapid reversal airflow obstruction . However , current guideline delivery SABDs spontaneously breathe patient make distinction whether medication deliver via meter dose inhaler ( MDI ) jet nebulizer ( JN ) , specific medication delivery device significant effect hospital admission reversal flow obstruction . However , advancement nebulizer design , namely FDA-approved vibrate mesh technology , demonstrate significant improvement relative JNs meter dose inhaler efficiency amount drug deliver vivo vitro study . Currently clinical trial compare use vibrate mesh nebulizer ( VMN ) JNs effect clinically important outcome . This prospective randomized control pilot trial seek determine difference hospital admission due COPD vibrate mesh nebulizer use versus jet nebulizer .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Medicated Aerosol Delivery Using A Jet Nebulizer Versus A Vibrating Mesh Nebulizer COPD Exacerbation</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Patients order receive SABD , screen presence moderate severe COPD exacerbation ; spontaneously breathe patient well support non-invasive ventilation ( NIV ) screen inclusion . Upon consent , patient randomize receive order SABD via JN ( MistyFast , Carefusion-BD , CA ) VMN ( Aerogen Ultra , Aerogen , Galway , Ireland ) . Included subject receive therapy mouthpiece interface . In case patient unable tolerate , maintain tight seal around mouthpiece otherwise perform aerosol therapy mouthpiece , valved-aerosol mask ( I-Guard aerosol mask , Salter Labs , Lake Forest , IL ) utilize . Subjects require NIV , whether admission ED face escalate therapy , receive NIV via non-vented , oronasal mask allocate nebulizer place distal leak NIV circuit ( mask circuit ) . Patients receive positive expiratory and/or inspiratory pressure specific setting determine prescribe physician clinical team . Subjects re-evaluated clinical data collect follow delivery initial SABD treatment include sign possible side effect . The prescribe physician clinical team determine need additional SABD therapy beyond initial therapy . Subjects indicate ordered additional administration SABD continue receive SABD randomly allocate aerosol delivery device . Subjects re-evaluated assessed possible side effect delivery additional SABD . The initial order , well subsequent order SABD medication discretion physician clinical team . The type dosage medication approximate timing medication delivery designate study protocol accord correlate standard practice . The process determine need clinical team administer additional SABD , follow evaluation , continue total four SABD treatment . If point follow SABD treatment , clinical team ass subject determines additional therapy indicate , subject receive additional SABD . Clinical data collect follow SABD administer ( approximately every 30 minute ) conclude 120 min randomization . Subjects require need endotracheal intubation mechanical ventilator support , immediate escalation support , discretion attend physician . Subjects require endotracheal intubation escalation therapy follow study enrollment include study analysis . Those subject require immediate need endotracheal intubation prior randomization exclude study . Individualized decision regard hospitalization discharge home accord attend physician . Subjects admit hospital continue inpatient care continue receive nebulized bronchodilator therapy , indicate order , aerosol delivery device accord MWHC bronchodilator protocol standard practice .</detailed_description>
