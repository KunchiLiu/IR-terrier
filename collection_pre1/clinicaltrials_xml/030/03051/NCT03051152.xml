	<brief_summary>Background : Literature often show limited discordant data regard prognostic value age gastric-cancer patient . Generally , disease-specific survival seem bad elderly compare young patient , therefore gastrectomy extend lymphadenectomy non-early tumor consider `` standard '' surgical therapy operable patient , despite age- comorbidity-related limitation . Recent trial report survival benefit extend nodal dissection compare limited method , Authors find age ( comorbidities ) relevant predictor postoperative complication , condition safety surgical procedure . Methods/Design : The LELEGA Trial ( Limited versus Extended Lymphadenectomy high risk Elderly Gastric Adenocarcinoma ) randomize , clinical multicenter trial . All patient &gt; 75 year Charlson Comorbidity Score &gt; 5 resectable M0 gastric cancer eligible inclusion randomization . The primary endpoint 5-year Disease-Specific Survival ( DSS ) . Secondary endpoint include 5-year Overall Survival ( OS ) postoperative complication classify accord Clavien-Dindo . Assuming alpha ( two-sided ) 5 % , 232 patient per group necessary achieve 80 % power detect 13 % survival difference ( 56 % 69 % ) group . Discussion : LELEGA trial prospective , multicenter randomize study define optimal extent lymphadenectomy ( extend versus limit ) elderly high-comorbidity gastric cancer patient .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Background Although worldwide incidence gastric cancer decrease , still remain fourth common type cancer second lead cause cancer-related death , grow prevalence elderly owing increase life expectancy . The Literature often show limited discordant data regard prognostic value age gastric-cancer patient . Generally , disease-specific survival seem bad elderly compare young patient . This evidence lead standardization surgery gastric cancer patient , whatever age ( comorbidity ) . Gastrectomy extend lymphadenectomy non-early tumor consider `` standard '' surgical therapy operable patient , despite age- comorbidity-related limitation . Following initial doubt concern safety first randomize control study , extend lymphadenectomy gastric-cancer surgery show good result . Recent trial , minimize impact nodal dissection early postoperative outcome , show survival benefit extend nodal dissection compare limited method , particularly advanced stage . Some study show age ( comorbidities ) relevant predictor postoperative complication , condition safety surgical procedure . In retrospective multicenter study , examine 1.322 non-metastatic gastric-cancer patient underwent curative gastrectomy D2 versus D1 lymphadenectomy January 2000 December 2009 . Postoperative complication , overall survival ( OS ) , disease-specific survival ( DSS ) accord age Charlson Comorbidity Score ( CCS ) analyze relation extent lymphadenectomy . Postoperative morbidity 30.4 % . Complications frequent high-morbidity elderly patient , , although general morbidity rate D2 D1 lymphadenectomy similar ( 29.9 % 33.2 % , respectively ) , also increase follow D2 high-morbidity elderly patient ( 39.6 % ) . D2-lymphadenectomy significantly improve 5-year OS DSS ( 48.0 % vs. 37.6 % D1 , p &lt; 0.001 72.6 % vs. 58.1 % D1 , p &lt; 0.001 , respectively ) patient . In elderly patient , benefit present 5-year DSS . D2 nodal dissection induce good 5-year OS DSS rate elderly patient positive node ( 29.7 % vs. 21.2 % D1 , p=0.008 47.5 % vs. 30.6 % D1 , p=0.001 , respectively ) , although present DSS high-morbidity elderly patient consider . Even promising , result derive retrospective study unavoidable bias : particularly , selection bias depend choice surgeon perform D1 elderly consider analysis ( 23.8 % vs 14.4 % D1 young patient , p &lt; 0.001 ) unmeasurable effect adjuvant treatment . Hence , phase-III randomize controlled trial could useful obtain reliable data relevant topic . Rationale With age world population , next year face great number elderly patient . Actually , also concern gastric cancer , part population usually exclude clinical trial , hence guideline `` test '' . Many retrospective study ( include retrospective analysis large series ) solve doubt short-term outcome survival benefit D2 gastrectomy high-risk elderly patient . Evident methodological limitation limit relevance conclusion . Firstly , retrospective design study imply non-homogeneous group , unavoidably influence different cut-offs use `` elderly '' definition surgeon ' choice particular regard lymphadenectomy . Secondly , often consider adjuvant therapy : although analysis would influence administration different regimen different schedule , survival might modify , thus condition interpretation result . According result retrospective report extend lymphadenectomy confirm efficacy determine good survival rate gastric cancer patient . However , extend nodal dissection OS high-morbidity elderly patient , even nodal involvement , present undoubted benefit . Most study sufficient power validate conclusion . In conclusion , prospective randomize multicenter trial test effect extension lymphadenectomy particular set high-risk elderly patient attempt identify patient likely benefit aggressive radical surgery acceptable perioperative risk . STUDY DESIGN This multicenter , open randomize trial</detailed_description>
