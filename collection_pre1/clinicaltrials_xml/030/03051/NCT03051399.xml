	<brief_summary>Previous vitro study suggest EpiCor well ferment colon prebiotic potential . The repeated long-term administration low dos EpiCor Simulator Human Intestinal Microbial Ecosystem ( SHIME ) show product able induce gradual change colonic environment : ) selectively ferment , lead butyrate increase colon ; ii ) stimulate Lactobacilli growth lumen adherence mucosal surface , iii ) decrease potential pathogen . In addition , fermentation-derived metabolite produce colon show potentially benefit host decrease cytokine level vitro . As result , investigator hypothesize EpiCor may help improve bowel function generally contribute enhanced gut health . Therefore , pilot study intend assess effect long-term administration EpiCor population mild symptom intestinal dysfunction . The primary objective exploratory pilot study assess effect long term administration EpiCor bowel function gastrointestinal well-being , mean validated questionnaire . This study 4 secondary objective : 1 ) The first secondary objective study assess protective effect EpiCor intestinal barrier function , perform gut sugar permeability test combination indomethacin challenge ; 2 ) The second secondary objective ass effect EpiCor intestinal barrier function , measure blood Zonulin endotoxin level combination indomethacin challenge ; 3 ) The third secondary objective study assess prebiotic property EpiCor collect fecal sample . The microbial community composition , lactate SCFA profile proteolytic activity marker feces determine . Proteolytic activity marker also measure urine sample ; 4 ) The fourth secondary objective study assess effect EpiCor local systemic immune system performance measure secretory IgA level feces cytokine blood .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Study design : In project effect repeat daily intake EpiCor investigate . The design conform randomize , double-blind , placebo-controlled parallel design . In total , two study group : one group receive placebo treatment ( maltodextrin 500mg daily dose , single serve ) one group receive EpiCor ( 500mg daily dose , single serving ) . Each eligible individual participate one two experimental arm study minimum 6 week . Before randomization , run-in period 2 week participant prohibit consume product contain pre- probiotic . Study population : Healthy human male/female volunteer mild symptom intestinal dysfunction . Subject recruitment start ethic committee approval study . After obtain sign informed consent confirmation eligibility , subject 4 test day study site . Each subject participate approximately 8 10 week study . In total , 80 subject complete study ( 40 subject trial arm ) . For patient withdrawn study , alternative candidate select order ultimately meet required number subject . The total study duration approximately 20 week . Study endpoint : The primary endpoint study effect long-term administration EpiCor digestive comfort . Digestive comfort assess mean evaluation ( questionnaire ) ) Gastrointestinal ( GI ) symptom ( bloating/distension ; passage gas ; GI rumbling ; feel fullness abdominal discomfort ) ii ) frequency/consistency stool . General gastrointestinal well-being improvement quality life also evaluate mean questionnaire . Secondary endpoint ) protective effect EpiCor gut barrier function indomethacin challenge ( assessed sugar test urine sample ) , ii ) effect EpiCor gut barrier function indomethacin challenge ( assessed quantification Zonulin blood ) , iii ) evaluation EpiCor 's prebiotic property ( assess microbiota-related analysis fecal content ) iv ) effect EpiCor local systemic immune system performance ( assessed measuring secretory ( ) IgA level feces cytokine blood ) . Study product : EpiCor ( Embria Health Sciences ) brand name substance consist dry yeast fermentate make use Saccharomyces cerevisiae fermentation . All publish human study EpiCor use daily dosage 500mg adult . Moreover , commercially recommend daily dosage , also use study . The placebo use study Globe maltodextrin 10 ( CPIngredientes , Mexico ) . This commercially available product mixture dextrose , maltose , oligo polysaccharide obtain partial enzymatic hydrolysis corn starch . Maltodextrin commonly use placebo dietary study evaluate gut microbiota intestinal well-being . It easily digestible rapidly absorb glucose effect colonic fermentation . EpiCor placebo provide capsule . The capsule use study Coni-Snap® capsule , two-piece hard gelatin capsule ( Capsugel , Mexico ) . Blinding procedure : Blinding ensure fact capsule opaque identical appearance package identical bottle Embria Health Sciences . A ProDigest staff member participate study label bottle assign subject accordance randomization list . The capsule pack identical bottle . Each bottle contain weekly dose ( =7 capsule per bottle ) . The participant ask orally ingest one capsule per day , combination 200mL water . The capsule consist 500mg EpiCor® 500mg maltodextrin . To ensure standardized intake , participant ask take capsule every morning breakfast . No interaction food report , participant may proceed usual food habit . Participants ask hand empty bottle ; use measure compliance . The product store room temperature dry condition close bottle ( preferably 15 25 °C ) duration study .</detailed_description>
