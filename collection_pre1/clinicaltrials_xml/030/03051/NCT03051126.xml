	<detailed_description>Fresh residual tissue sample obtain parathyroid and/or pancreas tumor intervention ( pancreas tumor intervention MEN1 patient hyperparathyroidism pancreatic lesion ) . In addition , outside paraffin tissue block slide request patient present MDACC , participate family member prior surgery outside MD Anderson . Forty cubic centimeter ( 40 cc ) whole blood obtain individual peripheral blood lymphocyte , plasma , serum separation analysis per event . Collections may make follow timepoints : preoperatively , intervention , and/or subsequent follow-up visit fifteen year .</detailed_description>
