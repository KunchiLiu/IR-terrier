	<brief_summary>This research study study radiation therapy combination immunotherapy possible treatment metastatic hormone receptor ( HR ) positive , HER2-negative breast cancer . The intervention involve study : - Palliative Radiotherapy - Pembrolizumab</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Phase II PEMBROLIZUMAB + PALLIATIVE RADIOTHERAPY IN BC</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This research study Phase II clinical trial . Phase II clinical trial test safety effectiveness investigational intervention learn whether intervention work treat specific disease . `` Investigational '' mean intervention study . In research study , investigator evaluate safety effectiveness palliative radiotherapy ( `` radiation therapy '' ) combination pembrolizumab HR-positive , HER2-negative breast cancer . This study design test well radiation therapy combination pembrolizumab treat type cancer . The FDA approve radiation therapy treatment option type breast cancer . The FDA ( U.S. Food Drug Administration ) approve pembrolizumab specific disease approve United Sates type cancer . Pembrolizumab drug may treat cancer work immune system . The immune system body 's natural defense disease . The immune system send type cell call `` T cell '' throughout body detect fight infection disease , include cancer . For type cancer , T cell work prevent attacking tumor . Pembrolizumab think work block protein T cell call PD-1 ( `` program death 1 '' ) , allow cell part immune system attack tumor . The combination pembrolizumab radiation therapy investigational . The study drug radiation therapy , give separately , work different waysto help stop cancer cell grow spread . However , know give study drug radiation therapy time well anti-cancer effect give treatment .</detailed_description>
