	<brief_title>Examining Effects Reduced Environmental Stimulation Anxiety</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The human brain constantly bombard sensory information external world . This series study aim explore effect reduce environmental stimulation use specially design floatation pool minimize visual , auditory , tactile , proprioceptive , thermal input brain . Previous research show `` float '' unique set significantly reduce level anxiety , stress , blood pressure , cortisol , significantly increase level subjective physiological form relaxation . Much past research contain various methodological weakness , include small sample size lack control condition . Moreover , little know potential benefit float clinical population , essentially nothing known effect float brain . The study propose protocol aim explore float 's potentially salubrious effect autonomic nervous system , begin investigate largely unknown effect central nervous system . The researcher attempt improve upon weakness past research use large sample size control condition . The current project focus document subjective , physiological neural effect float healthy anxious population . The subjective effect float examine use self-report measure experience sample method . The physiological effect float examine use waterproof wireless track blood pressure , heart rate , respiration , movement , addition collect measure cortisol magnesium . The neural effect float examine use waterproof wireless EEG collect float experience , well use functional magnetic resonance imaging ( fMRI ) collect immediately float . An exteroceptive control condition aim examine participant 's baseline physiological state participant watch neutral documentary film . This program research constitute first systematic investigation float body brain , finding potential illuminate physiological neural correlate relaxation response induce float experience .</detailed_description>
