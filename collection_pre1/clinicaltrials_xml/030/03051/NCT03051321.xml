	<brief_title>Maintaining Lower Levels Care Through Automated Perineal Hygiene</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The prevalence incontinence inability maintain personal perineal hygiene increase high level nurse care . While 75 % assist living home care setting able independently care toileting , 75 % nursing home resident regular episode urinary fecal incontinence require aid toileting . This imply whereas incontinence primary diagnosis 10 % nursing home admission , represent major contributor morbidity among nursing home resident , , important target effort cost containment . Inadequate independent perineal hygiene dependence caregiver effective toileting raise global cost adversely affect well-being assist living dependent living environment . It also associate increase incontinence incontinence associate dermatitis , carry high risk urinary tract infection skin infection . Finally , many institution , loss toileting independence mandate shift high intensity environment , incur significant cost . Water-based toileting evaluate potential intervention nursing home resident impair toileting capacity . In study , investigator find significant overall improvement use device , less half neither effectively clean dry end use . Because limited reliability , currently available device think offer enough significant advantage routine use nursing home setting . Incontinence incontinence associate dermatitis ( IAD ) common among resident impaired perineal hygiene toileting . Adherence prescribe medication therapy direct perineum major barrier regular use among fecal urinary incontinence . Difficulty access perineum make adherence challenge full limited mobility , often require assistance caregiver . The associated loss independence dignity major detriment quality life . Novel formulation zinc oxide , use aerosol base spray application , facilitate use improve patient acceptance . In 2014 nursing home base industry study , spray base zinc oxide prefer 80 % patient caregiver , improve treatment prevention IAD 70 % study participant . Adequate cleanse dry prior application barrier product key effective prevention skin breakdown . Water-based cleaning perineum toileting demonstrate improve hygiene standard mechanical , paper-based cleansing , especially limited mobility incontinence . Evidence demonstrate addition pH balance cleanser , apply without mechanical abrasion cloth wipe , advance hygiene minimizes risk secondary infection . Study Aims The aim study evaluate whether automate delivery system cleanse perineum keep subject would normally move high level assistance low level nurse care . A secondary aim evaluate whether automate hands-free application zinc oxide barrier spray effectively treat prevents incontinence associate dermatitis population active recurrent IAD . Finally , study aim demonstrate cost saving cost effectiveness analysis .</detailed_description>
