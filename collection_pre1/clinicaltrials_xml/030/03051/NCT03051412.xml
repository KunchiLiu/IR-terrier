	<brief_summary>Patellofemoral pain ( PFP ) highly prevalent musculoskeletal condition adult female , associate decreased quality life physical activity level . PFP highly persistent , 50 % adolescent report persistent pain one two year follow-up . Previous research demonstrate alter pain sensitivity old individual chronic pain , however , less known condition PFP , common young population . Additionally unknown characteristic return similar value healthy control , symptom resolve . The aim study compare pain sensitivity individual PFP , compare previous history PFP currently pain-free , control group history knee pain .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Pain Mechanisms Young Adolescent Females With Longstanding Patellofemoral Pain</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Recently demonstrate female longstanding PFP demonstrate increase pain sensitivity , hyperalgesia peripheral nervous system impair condition pain modulation , representative decrease descend control pain central nervous system . This commonly see old adult chronic longstanding pain , knee OA . Understanding evolution pain mechanisms recovery may yield important insight highly recurrent nature condition . Self-reported recovery appear associate increased pressure pain threshold , comparison current PFP . However , unknown whether characteristic , along centrally mediate pain processing , ever return 'normal ' , level history pain . To examine , investigation compare three group ( PFP versus Recovered versus Control ) , measure pain sensitivity ( defined primary secondary outcome ) , determine difference group . Demographic data , regard age , height weight collect , well pain frequency ( almost daily , several time per week , weekly , monthly , rarely , never ) , pain intensity ( measure numeric rating scale ) , Knee Injury Osteoarthritis Outcome score , spatial distribution pain ( use Navigate pain application ) . The group self report recover , ask report symptom resolve . A subgroup analysis undertaken recover group , examine relationship time since last knee pain experience , ( duration self- report symptom-free ) , pain sensitivity , assess primary secondary outcome measure . Participants recruit Adolescent Pain Aalborg ( APA2011 ) cohort . In 2011 , cohort 2200 adolescent age 15 19 year answer online questionnaire musculoskeletal pain . Of , 504 report knee pain , 153 clinically diagnose PFP . Five year later , 504 adolescent , well 252 randomly select adolescent report knee pain 2011 , complete follow-up questionnaire regard current pain ( clinical trials.gov identifier : NCT02873143 ) . From group , sample participant ' diagnose PFP 2011 , self report current pain , 'recovered ' randomly contact inclusion current investigation ( PFP recover group respectively ) . Additionally , control participant original APA2011 cohort , report pain 2011 , pain 2016 , random sample drawn invited participate control group . If cohort insufficient reach require sample size ( n = 36 group ) , participant recruit source GP 's , social medium . Embedded within cross-sectional study , randomize crossover trial ( group PFP ) approve local ethical committee approval number ( N-20160058 ) .
