	<detailed_description>Title : Menstrual cup cash transfer reduce sexual reproductive harm school dropout adolescent schoolgirl western Kenya : cluster randomise control trial . Short Title : Cups cash girl ( CCg ) trial Background rationale : Adolescence critical time psychological biological change , advocacy increase identify intervention protect sexual reproductive health ( SRH ) harm , disproportionately high among adolescent girl sub-Saharan Africa . In much eastern southern Africa include western Kenya , unprotected transactional sex common , young female highly vulnerable sexually transmit infection ( STIs ) , include HIV , pregnancy result school dropout . While burden young female SRH harm high individual , community health service , sustainable preventive intervention lack . Evidence positive association girl ' education , health economic potential strengthen international resolve improve educational opportunity adolescent girl . While SRH education minimal impact SRH harm , stay school show protect girl early marriage , teen pregnancy , HIV infection , schoolgirls report less frequent sex , few partner less age disparity . While MDGs focus primary school attendance , post-2015 Sustainability Development Goals continue encourage investment secondary , tertiary vocational education build human capital , innovation economic growth , require support cost-effective intervention . Interventions use cash transfer ( CT ) demonstrate protective effect girl SRH ( HIV , HSV-2 , sexual behaviour , school indicator ) . Menstrual hygiene management ( MHM ) pervasive problem across low middle income country ( LMICs ) lack MHM material facility negatively impact girl ' school-life . This increase girl ' vulnerability coercive sex , often create pathway obtain necessity soap , sanitary product , underwear ; 10 % 15 year old girl report obtain money sex purchase sanitary product western Kenya . To tackle challenge , team run pilot menstrual study western Kenya . It provide MHM tool adolescent girl form reusable menstrual cup disposable sanitary pad . The result demonstrate low prevalence STI bacterial vaginosis among girl provide single menstrual cup ( one cup last 10 year ) , low prevalence school dropout 12 month follow-up compare control . This pilot require replication large trial population longer follow-up . Comparison CT offer opportunity examine efficacy cost-effectiveness different approach improve girl ' life-chances rural western Kenya . The study design inform evidence-based policy improve girl ' health , school equity life-chances . Primary objective : To determine impact menstrual cup alone , cash transfer alone , two combination , secondary schoolgirl composite deleterious outcome ( HIV , HSV-2 infection , school dropout ) . Hypothesis : The investigator postulate intervention test break cycle sexual reproductive ill-health , under-achievement , poverty impede girl ' successful completion school . Overview Study Design : Single site open-label 4-arm , school-cluster randomise controlled superiority trial . Schools unit randomisation ( cluster ) , girls unit measurement . Schools randomly allocate 4 arm use 1:1:1:1 ratio permute block randomisation minimise bias . Enrollment stagger &gt; =2 school term logistically require . Girls followed-up graduation employment 10 academic term determine complete secondary school ( Form 4 ) . Sealed , opaque envelope prepare study allocation . Counsellors conduct HIV HSV-2 testing , laboratory technician blind study arm . Field staff conduct home visit confirm dropout also mask feasible . Sites : The study conduct Siaya County , western Kenya . Depending recruitment rate enrolment expand neighbouring county . Study Population : Secondary schoolgirl attend eligible school western Kenya study site . Girls resident area , history establish menses ( &gt; =3 time ) , disability prevent participation , parent guardian 's consent girl 's assent . Girls attend boarding school visible/declared pregnancy exclude baseline . Study Interventions : 1 . One menstrual cup ( MooncupÂ® ) handwash soap termly ; 2 . Cash transfer ( CT ; girl ' pocket money ) via local community/mobile bank financial literacy ; 3 . A combination cup CT intervention ; 4 . 'Usual practice ' ( control ) handwash soap termly . Outcome Measures : Primary efficacy outcome : Composite endpoint comprise incident HIV , HSV-2 , all-cause school dropout , end follow-up . Key secondary outcome include incident HIV , HSV-2 , school dropout , BV report sexual behaviour include pregnancy , quality life measure , school indicator ( performance , grade repitition , re-enrolment , absence ) , cost-effectiveness . Primary safety outcome measure : toxic shock syndrome ( TSS ) , severe violence associate intervention . Key secondary safety outcome include contamination menstrual cup emergent harm associate intervention . Follow-up procedure : HIV HSV-2 serostatus assess baseline around time final school term ( Form 4 ) , interim test annual test funding allows , include bacterial vaginosis STI . School dropout assess every term end Form ( class ) 4 . Other endpoint evaluate baseline , midline , end study . Safety monitor TSS physical violence conduct throughout study nurse , supplement health facility evaluation HDSS census mortality data . Sample size : Main trial : 84 school ( cluster ) ( 21 per arm ) approximate average 46 girl per school ( ~3864 participant , 966 per arm ) . Data Analysis : Primary trial analysis base intention treat principle secondary analysis also do per protocol population . Generalised estimate equation ( GEE ) log binomial model use analyse primary endpoint component . The GEE model include arm fixed effect school cluster effect . The RR value 5 pre-specified primary comparison together 95 % confidence interval derive GEE model . The secondary endpoint analyse similarly use GEE model . For GEE analysis continuous endpoint quality life , normal distribution identity link function use . For GEE analysis binary outcome ( event STI , HIV , pregnancy , school dropout ) , binomial distribution log link function use ; GEE analysis recurrence event ( number sexual partner specific time ) , Poisson distribution log link function use . Covariate adjust analysis primary endpoint perform within GEE framework treatment study variable , predictor covariates , school cluster effect . For qualitative analysis , FGD record transcribe verbatim back translation . Transcripts analyse use thematic analysis study group , 2 researcher separately assign code emergent theme , subthemes pattern , association use NVIVO intercoder reliability check consensus reach follow discussion . As theme emerge , difference similarity compare across trial arm , study group . Qualitative data depth interview similarly evaluate .</detailed_description>
