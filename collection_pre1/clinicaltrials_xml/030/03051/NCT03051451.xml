	<detailed_description>Overweight obesity serious health problem affect population around world . According information World Health Organization ( WHO ) 2014 1.9 billion inhabitant old 18 year overweight , 600 million obese , i.e. , 39 % adult global level present overweight 13 % adult suffer obesity . Overweight obesity consider complex multifactorial disease associate development multiple co-morbidities certain type cancer , cardiovascular disease ( CVD ) , disability , diabetes mellitus type 2 ( DM2 ) , disease gallbladder , osteoarthritis , high blood pressure ( Hypertension ) , sleep apnea cerebrovascular disease ( CD ) , make fifth lead cause death worldwide , therefore consider pandemic . Obesity define increase weight body associate imbalance proportion different component body , mainly , mass fat increase abnormal distribution body.The Body Mass Index ( BMI ) standard widely use classification somatotype people , therefore identification obesity . BMI obtain divide weight kilogram height square meter . The classification BMI White , Hispanic , African-American adult people approve National Institute Heart , Lung Blood , WHO , American Association Heart , American College Cardiology Obesity Society , whose classification follow : The weight body determine balance energy , represent difference intake energy food expenditure energy come physical activity individual . For maintenance stable body weight , energy intake must equal energy expenditure , 's weight gain happens , intake exceeds expenditure , produce positive energy balance . On hand , weight loss occur energy expenditure exceed caloric intake . Although low expenditure energy represent one main factor produce increase weight , multiple factor play important role . These factor include genetic predisposition individual , physical inactivity sedentary behavior , socio-economic factor , well emotional factor consumption certain type drug . Due multiple factor influence development overweight obesity , treatment complex , must type treatment multidisciplinary team achieve control one factor condition obesity individual . Traditional treatment loss weight give education individual preference healthy food , prescription diet implementation program physical activity . However , various study show type intervention effect long term , incorporation new strategy adjuvant loss weight develop , include surgical technique pharmacological therapy . According guideline obesity , drug treatment therapy recommend individual BMI ≥30 kg/m2 BMI ≥27 kg/m2 presence comorbidity . 6 . The use pharmacological therapy must always use adjuvant change lifestyle , must approve health authority country . Before 2012 , phentermine orlistat unique medication available treatment obesity United States ; however 2015 Repertoire pharmacological agent available treat obesity extend incorporated 4 new drug : lorcaserin , phentermine / topiramate prolong release , naltrexone / wellbutrin prolong release liraglutide . These new drug share common strategy promote weight loss control hunger satiation level central nervous system ( CNS ) , besides previously use treatment medical condition obesity . The amount weight lost achieve use agent , usually go 3 10 % initial weight require continuous hold loss weight . In addition , drug unique profile adverse event consider deeply prior indicate . Due , search new drug therapy obesity treatment one priorities research . Some drug develop different therapeutic indication show significant effect weight loss , include metformin hydrochloride fluoxetine</detailed_description>
