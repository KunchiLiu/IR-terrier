	<detailed_description>II.1 . Study set This clinical study hold Clinic Conservative Dentistry Department , Faculty Oral Dental Medicine , Cairo University , Egypt . The researcher bear ultimate responsibility activity associate conduct research project include recruitment patient , explain performing procedure . II.2 . Variables study : A total 20 patient participate study . Each patient 3 carious teeth . Resulting total 60 carious lesion . II.3 . Trial Description : II.3.a excavation protocol : Three dentinal carious lesion choose study patient . The lesion classify use International Caries Detection Assessment System ( ICDAS-II ) . air-drying teeth use triplex syringe ICDAS-II score lesion obtain . The chosen sit record : Code 4 , non-cavitated Lesion extend dentine see undermining shadow ; code 5 , small cavitated lesion visible dentine : le 50 % surface ; code 6 , large cavitated lesion visible dentine : 50 % surface . In case , dentine lesion soft wet indicate active lesion . Using local anaesthesia rubber dam , operative field disinfect 1 % hypochlorite , dentine lesion expose high-speed diamond bur remove cover enamel . Before excavation dentine sample collect baseline bacteriological assessment . Excavation carry use new slow speed round bur hand excavator . Special consideration give avoid pulpal exposure excavation . In order avoid , hand excavator use final excavation stage . II.3.b Clinical assessment : The excavation end point one cavity determine use visual tactile method . The two cavity inspect fluorescent camera caries detector dye ( CDD ) method determine excavation endpoint respectively . After excavation , dentine sample three cavity collect use sterile excavator bacteriological assessment . II.3.c Assessment Outcome : Samples carious sound dentine collect sterile excavator caries removal three group . The dentine sample transfer sterile box contain thioglycollate medium use carrier , sterile box keep ice box take microbiology laboratory processing , within hour , another examiner know type technique use inspection caries excavation . Dentin sample weight calculate measure difference weight whole set ( sterilized bottle , transport medium , collect dentine ) previously determine weight set without dentin . The number bacteria obtain give amount dentin use estimate number bacteria present 1 mg dentin ( CFU/mg ) . II.4 . Participant timeline : All procedure carry visit . II.5 . Sample size calculation : The aim study conduct assess reliability fluorescence camera caries detection dye versus visual tactile method caries excavation use bacteriological assessment method . Based previous paper Stroll et al.,2015 , area curve fluorescent camera use bacterial count reference 0.75 . Using power 80 % 5 % significance level , 20 cavity need group sample size calculate PASS 2008 . II.6 . Recruitment : Patients recruit outpatient clinic Conservative Dentistry Department Faculty Oral Dental Medicine , Cairo University ; eligible patient recruit fulfil eligibility criterion accord participant timeline . II.6.a . Recruitment Strategy : The patient subject full examination diagnosis use dental chart . Once patient potentially eligible study identify , contact researcher explain study ascertain patient 's interest . If interested , detailed evaluation preparation make . II.7 . Randomization assignment intervention : II.7.a . Allocation sequence generation : The allocation sequence generate use ( www.randomization.com ) . II.7.b . Allocation concealment mechanism : Each recruit patient give number accord order recruitment follow sequence randomly generate number , operator start first tooth excavate , choose three opaque seal envelope ( two envelope intervention control ) . envelope allocate participant involved phase clinical trial . The tooth intervention control assign record record patient keep main supervisor II.7.c . Implementation : A participant generate random allocation sequence . The researcher enroll patient unbiased participant assign intervention/Control respective teeth . II.8 . Data collection method : *Baseline data collection : For every patient medical history , dental history examination chart fill operator . *Outcome data collection : The result convert table facilitate description result . The microbiological analysis perform blindly relation caries removal method . II.9.Data management : data enter stored personal computer . Double data entry save external hard disc prevent loss data . II.10 . Statistical method Data analyze use IBM SPSS advance statistic ( Statistical Package Social Sciences ) . Numerical data describe mean standard deviation median range . Data explore normality use kolmogorov-smirnov test Shapiro-Wilk test . Comparisons 3 group normally distribute numeric variable do use ANOVA non normally distribute numeric variable do Kruskal Wallis test . A p-value le equal 0.05 consider statistically significant . All test two tail . II.11 . Monitoring : II.11.a . Data monitoring : The main supervisor monitor study . His role monitor risk bias could do participant , operator assessor . Also monitor blind assessor patient safety , outstanding benefit harm . II.11.b . Harms : The main supervisor inform participant possible harm , present . Participants allow contact operator moment telephone . In case accidental pulp exposure excavation , emergency access cavity pulp extirpation do operator patient refer Endodontic Department clinic complete root canal treatment . II.11.c . Auditing : In present trial , audit do main co-supervisors assure quality research frequency procedure . II.14 . Ethics dissemination II.14.a . Research ethic approval : Application form carry clinical trial , checklist informed consent Research Ethics Committee ( REC ) Faculty Oral Dental Medicine , Cairo University retrieve fill , deliver ( REC ) committee approval.This do prevent ethical problem study harm participant . II.12.b . Protocol amendment : If new protocol use protocol amendment submit ; contain new copy new protocol brief explanation difference previous protocol . If change exist protocol affect safety subject , investigation scope scientific quality trial , amendment contain brief explanation change submit . If new author add accomplish study , amendment include investigator 's data qualification conduct investigation submit prevent ghost authorship . II.12.c . Consent : The operator responsible admit sign write consent enrolment day . II.13 . Confidentiality : Name , personal data picture participant appear protocol form maintain secure 10 year trial . This do protection participant ' privacy civil right . II.16 . Declaration interest : There conflict interest , fund material supply party . II.14 . Access data : Access final data allow operator , main co-supervisors study involve assessment outcome . II.15 . Ancillary post-trial care : Patients follow application 3 , 6 month . II.16 . Dissemination policy : Full protocol publish online www.clinicaltrials.gov avoid repetition keep integrity research work . Thesis discuss front judgment committee . The study publish report result clinical trial .</detailed_description>
