	<brief_summary>The aim study 1 ) descriptively report possible flight event 2 ) provide regression analysis number event statistically significant prevalence thus useful find possible parameter echocardiography , right heart catheterization , laboratory finding , spiroergometry well six minute walk test produce risk assessment possible expect flight adverse event well recommendation concern need supplemental oxygen individual patient . The investigator therefore want find : 1 . In subgroup ( applicable ) PH patient flight adverse event frequent . 2 . Whether parameter ( blood sample , blood gas analysis , World Health Organization-Functional Class ( WHO-FC ) , Six Minute Walk ( SMW ) , echocardiography , right heart catheter ( RHC ) ) able predict flight need additional oxygen and/or possible adverse event .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>The Effects Commercial Air Travel Patients Suffering From Pulmonary Hypertension</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Pulmonary Hypertension ( PH ) progressive disease affect pulmonary vessel lead increased pulmonary vascular resistance ( PVR ) thus right heart strain . The result increase mean pulmonary arterial pressure ( mPAP ) time dilation right heart chamber well hypertrophy right ventricular myocardium . As increase PVR progress , right ventricle struggle cope rise afterload start fail . Before bad case scenario occur , individual suffer PH notice dyspnea exertion first sign underlying disease . The increase proliferation result rise PVR lead slower blood flow pulmonary vessel thus sometimes result situ thrombosis . Furthermore thicken capillary vessel bed increase diffusion barrier oxygen herby result ventilation-perfusion mismatch lead hypoxia first exercise , later even rest , make long term oxygen therapy ( LTOT ) necessary . Today 's specific pulmonary-vasoactive therapy help individual suffer PH live `` normal '' life . For people also mean go vacation - necessary plane . The latter however bar risk patient suffer PH : While average travel altitude passenger plane 9.150 - 12.200m ( 30.000 - 40.000ft ) atmospheric pressure le 30 % compare sea level , reduce pressure inspire oxygen ( PIO2 ) 143mmHg less 40mmHg . In word air contain less 6 % oxygen compare 21 % sea level . Since compatible human life airplane cabin pressurize maintain pressure equally height 1520 - 2440m ( 5.000 - 8.000ft ) contain 15 % oxygen . However , even National Research Council ( NRC ) state passenger cardiovascular problem might experience discomfort within cabin environment . These condition hypobaric hypoxia , even pulmonary vasculature healthy individual , lead generalize hypoxic pulmonary vasoconstriction ( HPV ) . These change , healthy individual lead rise PVR thus right ventricular systolic pressure ( RVSP ) . Healthy individual able compensate result increase right ventricular afterload . It however easily imaginable heart patient right heart insufficiency may struggle even fail circumstance . Increasing PIO2 supplemental oxygen ( O2 ) know prevent change , recommend use patient world health organization functional class ( WHO-FC ) III IV well patient arterial blood O2 pressure consistently &lt; , 60mmHg ( 8 kPa ) current guideline . This general advice give American Aerospace Medical Association British Thoracic Society well . There however problem recommendation : There 's lack study concern effect commercial air travel patient PH , many recommendation make transfer data survey common lung disease . There however study effect ( simulate ) air travel patient PH : In 2012 survey conduct hypoxic challenge test ( HCT ) perform 36 individual suffer PH compare acquire data HCT WHO-FC actual need flight oxygen . The latter information gain questionnaire hand name individual focus flight symptom event lead use flight oxygen prior diagnosis PH . It find 25 examine 36 individual accord current recommendation would need flight oxygen judge WHO-FC , 10 fail HCT . Out 36 patient , 14 travel plane diagnose PH . Of , nine subject in-flight oxygen base WHO-FC asymptomatic without . Furthermore 1 individual pass HCT develop symptom flight 3 fail HCT asymptomatic fly without oxygen . In word : HCT identify one patient develop symptom flight . In year another study publish data prospective survey 34 individual data collect flight . Cabin pressure , peripheral oxygen saturation ( SpO2 ) , heart rate symptom assess . Desaturation define SpO2 &lt; 85 % . It find nine individual experience significant desaturation . Furthermore five 13 patient report symptom present desaturation flight . Furthermore predictive factor predict possible desaturation time airborne ( neither rest SpO2 sea level maximal estimate cabin altitude predictive ) found . In 2011 retrospective analysis patient diagnose PH , travel airplane , ask complete questionnaire contain general information ( group PH , WHO-FC , current medication , usage LTOT , etc . ) well possible symptom conceive ( dyspnea , chest pain , peripheral edema , etc . ) release . Out 179 patient travel plane 57 LTOT 29 use supplemental oxygen flight . In total 20 adverse event report ( mainly mild moderate severity ) 7 need medical assistance . In total 159 179 patient n't experience discomfort shortly travel . In summary scarce data available hitherto sufficient test available predict flight complication patient pulmonary hypertension . It could however show use WHO-FC surrogate useful determine patient might need additional oxygen air travel . Furthermore even HCT capable detecting patient risk . Even British Thoracic Society mark recommendation use supplemental oxygen patient PH `` evidence level D '' . It absence sufficient data thereby result uncertainty patient , physician , pneumologist cardiologist well specialist field PH topic lead concept study . By prospective survey patient suffer form PH , different type available treatment WHO-FCs investigator hope gain insight possible marker predict flight adverse event thus make fly safe individual struggle PH . This study therefore aim include total 1000 patient suffer form PH , provide write informed consent , ask fill questionnaire prior air travel well assess vital parameter ( SpO2 , pulse respiration rate ) prior , shortly flight . In addition clinical data available collected analyze . The aim study find possible parameter echocardiography , right heart catheterization , laboratory finding , spiroergometry well six minute walk test produce risk assessment possible expect flight adverse event well recommendation concern need supplemental oxygen individual patient . All data collect anonymised prevent possible identification participate individual . Examinations conduct survey would necessary anyway course regular clinical visit . So additional health risk patient participate study .</detailed_description>
