	<brief_summary>Apart obesity , craniofacial factor well recognize pathogenesis obstructive sleep apnea ( OSA ) likely play important role influence response weight loss . The prevalence OSA syndrome common among middle-aged Hong Kong Chinese population Caucasians , despite Chinese patient much low body mass index ( BMI ) . From previous work ethnic comparison , degree OSA severity , Caucasians overweight , whereas Chinese exhibit craniofacial bony restriction . Cephalometric measurement base lateral radiograph upper airway show short distance maxillary projection cranial base , small posterior airway space , less mandibular protrusion , narrow space hard palate cranial base , caudally place hyoid bone predispose high apnea-hypopnea index ( AHI ) . A recent study show short mandibular length measure lateral cephalometry associate great fall AHI weight loss . Another study use craniofacial compute tomography ( CT ) scan evaluate maxillomandibular bony volume find craniofacial restriction influence relationship weight loss OSA improvement . Collectively , study suggest effect AHI weight loss likely pronounce small craniofacial skeleton . However , effect craniofacial restriction degree rebound OSA follow weight gain weight loss intervention unknown . The study aim investigate change weight OSA severity follow cessation lifestyle modification program ( LMP ) examine relationship craniofacial restriction degree OSA reoccurrence .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>All subject advise stop use continuous positive airway pressure ( CPAP ) least 7 day previous study show severity obstructive sleep apnea ( OSA ) increase first week CPAP withdrawal . Subjects invite undergo limited sleep study use `` EMBLETTA '' portable diagnostic system ( MEDCARE , Iceland ) . The EMBLETTA pocket-sized digital recording device . It multi-channel transducer , provide apnea-hypopnea index ( AHI ) base recording time . It also detect respiratory abdominal effort effort sensor differentiate obstructive central event . Built-in position sensor also available differentiate supine non-supine event . Respiratory event score desaturations least 4 % occur absence move artefact irrespective co-existing change snore heart rate . The EMBLETTA operate battery power , internal memory storage 16 MB , allow approximately 12 hour data collection . The EMBLETTA default setting apneas hypopnea use study . An apnea define decrease airflow 80 % baseline least 10 second . The EMBLETTA default maximum apnea duration set 80 second . A hypopnea define decrease airflow 50 % baseline least 10 second . The EMBLETTA default maximum hypopnea duration set 100 second . The EMBLETTA AHI use analysis automatically analyse EMBLETTA software . The EMBLETTA device validate hospital-based polysomnography Hong Kong Chinese population . The EMBLETTA highly sensitive specific screen device quantify AHI differentiate obstruct supine event compare polysomnography ( PSG ) patient suspect OSA . Patients instructed operate EMBLETTA device sleep record estimate time sleep . Those failed EMBLETTA sleep study arrange second home EMBLETTA sleep study . Patients symptomatic OSA negative home EMBLETTA sleep study arrange hospital-based PSG . All subject undergo three-dimensional ( 3D ) compute tomography ( CT ) scan head/neck region evaluate upper airway craniofacial structure . Craniofacial restriction determine measure size maxillomandibular volume base mandibular cephalometric landmark ( leave right condylion , leave right gonion , anterior nasal spine ( ANS ) menton ) per previous publish study . The patient position natural head position close lip bite . All measurement make single assessor analysis perform blind knowledge weight loss AHI data . All subject go several measurement . These include assessment subjective sleepiness Epworth Sleepiness scale ( ESS ) , anthropometric measurement ( body mass index , neck waist circumference ) blood pressure . The ESS questionnaire specific symptom daytime sleepiness patient ask score likelihood fall asleep eight different situation different level stimulation , add total score 0 24 .</detailed_description>
