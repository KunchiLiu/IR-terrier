	<brief_summary>The purpose study evaluate effectiveness safety possible new treatment Essential Tremor ( ET ) use external wearable sensor , capability record acceleration Electromyography ( EMG ) . This therapy call Responsive Deep Brain Stimulation ( R-DBS ) . R-DBS system communicate computer , apply stimulation computer detect pattern associate tremor . This detection suppress pathological activity improve alleviate tremor . Currently , DBS approve treatment ET ; however , stimulation deliver continuously even tremor symptom absent . Continuous DBS lead unwanted side effect stutter gait\balance problem . On hand , R-DBS turn activity associate ET external sensor detect .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Wearable Sensor Responsive DBS ET</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The overall purpose application capture pathological activity relate essential tremor use external wearable sensor responsively initiate terminate DBS . To end , propose use Nexus-D system , require firm ware update Activa Implantable Neurostimulator ( INS ) , smart way turn DBS on/off patient . We recruit subject Activa Single Channel ( SC ) implant 6 post-operative program visit . Our research group already familiar possession Nexus-D system , successfully perform responsive DBS two patient Tourette syndrome ( TS ) four patient Parkinson 's disease acute setting . Our lab also equip wireless wearable sensor amplifier system , 16-unit wireless EMG+ acceleration+inertia Trigno Wireless Bio Acquisition System ( Delsys Inc , Natick , MA ) . We aim combine signal modality capture pathological symptom generate command initiate terminate DBS ( also record adverse side effect , ) . Our goal characterize clinical efficacy , side effect profile , battery life closed-loop DBS acute setting use wearable sensor essential tremor patient .</detailed_description>
