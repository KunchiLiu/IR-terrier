	<brief_summary>In phase I protocol primarily investigate safety use calcium combine electroporation recurrent head neck cancer . Secondly , evaluate tumour response PET/MRI ( positron emission tomography/magnetic resonance imaging ) , clinical evaluation , biopsy . Thirdly , evaluate effect calcium electroporation compare electrochemotherapy well patient life-of-quality questionnaire , EORTC QLQ C-30 H &amp; N35 ( european organisation research treatment cancer ) .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Calcium electroporation . Electroporation technique facilitate transport molecule across cell membrane use electric pulse . The electric field apply cell membrane create temporary destabilization . As electric capacity membrane exceed , crack form membrane molecule free diffuse cytosol cell . The process reversible cell membrane stabilize matter minute . While cell membrane permeable increase influx Ca2+ cell . Calcium influx may improve combine calcium together electroporation ; call calcium electroporation . In vivo study show enhance extracellular calcium concentration apply electroporation , large Ca2+ influx occur . The large Ca2+ influx lead reduction ATP ( adenosine triphosphate ) level cell death . A fall ATP level see two reason : First , increase intracellular Ca2+ lead high activity Ca2+-ATPase Na+/K+-ATPase . Secondly , high concentration Ca2+ lead loss electrochemical gradient mitochondrial membrane , cause mitochondrial collapse . Upon collapse mitochondrion , cell longer produce ATP . Overall , increase consumption decrease production ATP lead lover ATP level . Combined cellular process activation lipases protease , cell eventually die . Trials objective . 1 . Primary outcome . Evaluating safety measure use calcium electroporation mucosal head neck cancer . This do continuously evaluate pain VAS-score ( visual analogue scale ) side effect Common Terminology Criteria Adverse Events ( CTCAE ) registration Adverse Events ( AE ) Serious Adverse Events ( SAE ) . The safety use calcium intratumourally also evaluate measurement Ca2+ blood sample treatment . 2 . Secondary outcome . Evaluation response imaging : PET-MRI , Clinical photography , Biopsies tumour site The subject subjective evaluation treatment post treatment period evaluate Quality life questionnaire , EORTC QLQ-C30 H &amp; N35 : two different questionnaire validate head neck cancer patient . 3 . Tertiary outcome . The response treatment compare result current trial , use electrochemotherapy mucosal head neck tumour . The comparison image response , VAS score result questionnaire ( EORTC QLQ-C30 H &amp; N35 ) . Trial design . This phase I , interventional , clinical trial safety calcium electroporation mucosal head neck tumour . Subjects relapse primary head neck cancer . Treatment intend palliative curative . All subject offer standard treatment surgery radiotherapy enrolment trial , possible . There schedule control group , mean eligible patient offer treatment . Electroporation anaesthesia . The treatment perform general anaesthesia localization head neck tumours complicate treatment local anaesthetic . After patient anaesthetize , tumour area inject calcium . After administration calcium electrode insert tumour electrical pulse generate documented use Cliniporator ( IGEA , Capri , Italy ) . Overall operate time/anaesthesia time 1-2 hour expect hospital stay 3 day . Treatment intend once-only treatment measurable response evaluation scan combine continued cancer activity treat area result another treatment session .</detailed_description>
