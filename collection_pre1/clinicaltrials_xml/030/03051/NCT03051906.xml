	<brief_summary>In 60 % case , squamous cell carcinoma head neck ( SCCHN ) discover loco-regionally advanced stage require combine multimodal strategy order pursue curative intent . Bonner et al demonstrated combination radiation ( RT ) Cetuximab ( CTX ) , chimeric mouse IgG1 monoclonal anti-EGFR antibody , result well median locoregional control overall survival compare RT alone without increase rate &gt; G3 acute toxicity detrimental effect compliance quality life . However , subsequent negative trial ( RTOG 0522 ) lead hypothesis unselected patient population benefit CTX may dilute due molecular heterogeneity SSCHN . Moreover , absence biomarkers predictive response anti-EGFR treatment may part explain observation factor play role favor anticancer effect , namely immunologic mechanism . It demonstrate SCCHN immunosuppressive disease characterize prominent immuno-escape mechanism , induction tumor-permissive cytokine profile qualitative/quantitative lymphocyte deficiency , occurrence anergy major immune effector cell poor antigen presentation . Given observation , postulate SCCHN may benefit immunotherapeutic strategy , primarily aim PD-L1/PD1 checkpoint blockade . Segal et al ( Asco 2015 ) report preliminary result use Durvalumab pretreated patient recurrent/metastatic SCCHN . Durvalumab humanize monoclonal IgG1 antibody block PD-L1 bind PD-1 CD80 high affinity selectivity , thereby promote activity tumor-specific effector T cell global anti-tumor immune response . Out 64 treated patient , 51 patient available preliminary efficacy analysis : promisingly , overall response rate 12 % ( 25 % PD-L1 positive patient ) . To date , clinical trial , specifically design SCCHN , test PD-L1 targeted agent complete , initiated combination strategy CTX , RT PD1/PD-L1 antibody curative set . Taken data together , strong rationale may support combination Durvalumab , anti-EGFR therapy CTX RT order revert SCCHN-induced immune suppression maximize treatment efficacy , ultimately enhance , CTX-mediated immune mechanism maximize RT-specific cytotoxicity .</brief_summary>
