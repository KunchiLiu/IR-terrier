	<brief_summary>Acute myocardial infarction ( AMI ) pose pool clinical outcome men woman treatment delay . However , repercussion time limit previous study . To evaluate system delay clinical outcome among China patient AMI,12,000 consecutive inpatient case prospectively collect 2004 2016 . Basic data innovative evidence accelerate evidence-based clinical practice policy making , improve AMI patient outcomes finally .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>System Delay Clinical Outcome Among Chinese Patients With AMI Treated With Reperfusion Therapy ( MOODY Study )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>AMI one lead cause mortality morbidity public health globally , well China . Remarkable variation repercussion time clinical outcome note , however little information available shorten D2B time incorporate appropriately routine clinical practice China . In addition , basic data evidence effectiveness treatment AMI long-term recovery limit . Practical apply knowledge large unselected population need guide practice improvement . This study enroll patient confirm diagnosis AMI consecutively 10 tertiary hospital 20 secondary hospital China . At study entry , participant interview index hospitalization , collect information symptom , functioning , quality life , medical care . Demographic characteristic , medical history , clinical feature , diagnostic test , medication , procedure , in-hospital outcome patient abstract medical record well trained professional abstractor . At 1 month , 12 month discharge , participant return clinic follow visit . This study examine system delay may affect patient recovery heart attack . Effective clinic path system , risk model AMI patient establish base finding , improve patient outcomes future finally .</detailed_description>
