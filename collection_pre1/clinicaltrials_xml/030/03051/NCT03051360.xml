	<brief_title>PCSK9 Inhibitors Progression Aortic Stenosis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Aortic valve disease common form heart valve disease major burden society . Aortic valve disease also expect become prevalent age . Among aortic disease , 'aortic stenosis ( AS ) ' , narrow aortic valve , lead symptom heart failure sometimes death . For treatment AS , valve replace surgical percutaneous method . Regardless method , valve replacement potential cost complication important issue need solve . Therefore , control progression AS increase efficacy medical therapy valvular replacement need , important medico-social problem . Regarding pathophysiology AS , elevation lipoprotein ( ) dyslipidemia report associated progression cardiovascular calcification . PCSK9 inhibitor , medication control lipoprotein ( ) dyslipidemia may effective medication control progression AS . Therefore , investigator perform randomize control trial , compare effect PCSK9 inhibitor vs. placebo influence AS progression .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>1 . The patient agree participate study sign informed consent form . Alternatively , legally authorize patient representative may agree patient 's participation study sign inform consent form . 2 . The patient work diagnosis aortic stenosis ( mild moderate ) , fair treatment compliance . 1 . Age 19 year old 2 . Hypersensitivity PCSK9 inhibitor 3 . LDL cholesterol &lt; 70mg/dL baseline 4 . Poor treatement compliance ( The patient need visit outpatient clinic every 2weeks medication ) 5 . Positive pregnancy test know pregnant 6 . Any reason investigator deems subject unsuitable study ( e.g. , Active malignant tumor , Any lifethreatening condition life expectancy less 6months , etc . ) 7 . Any clinically significant abnormality identify screen visit , physical examination , laboratory test , electrocardiogram , judgment investigator , would preclude safe completion study</criteria>
