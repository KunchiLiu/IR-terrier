	<brief_title>Predictive Value Bone Turnover Markers During Discontinuation With Alendronate</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Background : Osteoporosis increase risk fracture . Alendronate reduces risk vertebral- hip fracture approximately 50 % . It , however , become evident long-term anti-resorptive may lead serious side effect atypical femoral fracture osteonecrosis jaw . The alendronate extension study ( FLEX ) show despite stop treatment five year anti-fracture efficacy regard non-vertebral radiological vertebral fracture persist additional five year patient bone mineral density ( BMD ) T-score &gt; -2.5 femoral neck , fracture treatment , previous vertebral fracture . It therefore clinical practice , treatment discontinue five year patient fulfil criterion . Based alendronate extension study assume , bone turnover monitor biochemical marker would stay suppressed year stop treatment , however , study demonstrate great variability change bone turnover marker see stop treatment alendronate real-life setting . Aim : To investigate predictive value marker bone turnover bone loss 12 month stop alendronate therapy . Methods : The study cohort study comprise 140 patient osteoporosis stop treatment alendronate . Perspectives : The study contribute new knowledge biochemical marker bone turnover predictor bone loss stopping treatment alendronate . It thus possible identify patient experience decrease BMD treatment break , particular group patient treatment re-initiated early loss bone avoid . On hand , biochemical marker bone turnover could also shed light tolerate treatment break , thereby avoid long-term treatment alendronate , may associate serious side effect . Finally , use blood sample rather DXA reduce use X-rays .</detailed_description>
