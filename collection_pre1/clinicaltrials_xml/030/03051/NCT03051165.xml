	<brief_summary>This study evaluate effect hypoglossal nerve stimulation ( HGNS ) different measure cardiovascular function patient obstructive sleep apnea ( OSA ) . People OSA undergone implantation hypoglossal nerve stimulator study site tell study 2-week post-operative appointment . Those decide participate blood drawn vascular function measurement take HGNS activation , treatment , temporary treatment withdrawal period . Following 30-day period treatment withdrawal , HGNS therapy reactivate .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Effect Upper Airway Stimulation Vascular Function Obstructive Sleep Apnea</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Obstructive sleep apnea ( OSA ) , repetitive collapse upper airway sleep , represent grow individual public health concern . This disease negatively impact patient ' sleep quality daytime function , include increase risk motor vehicle accident . Several large , longitudinal cohort consistently demonstrate deleterious effect OSA cardiovascular health , include elevate rate incident hypertension , myocardial infarction cerebrovascular accident . The link OSA cardiovascular consequence largely explain autonomic imbalance repeat episode nocturnal airway obstruction . Compared without OSA , people OSA increase sympathetic activity awake , elevation sympathetic activity blood pressure sleep . Multiple physiologic mechanism responsible autonomic change obstructive episode include interaction baroreceptor , chemoreceptor respiratory afferent receptor . Positive airway pressure ( PAP ) serve pneumatic stent airway , maintain airway patency normoxia . PAP therapy demonstrate consistent , meaningful reduction sympathetic overactivity wake sleep . Although PAP therapy highly efficacious , few 50 % patient adequately treat due adherence difficulty . In 2014 , Federal Drug Administration approve hypoglossal nerve stimulation ( HGNS ) treatment patient moderate-severe OSA unable adequately use PAP . This therapy demonstrate stable , marked improvement key polysomnography index , sleepiness measure functional outcome , however , study examine cardiovascular endpoint HGNS therapy OSA patient . The aim study evaluate effect HGNS therapy autonomic vascular function , treatment OSA HGNS . People undergone implantation hypoglossal nerve stimulator study site tell study 2-week post-operative appointment . Those decide participate study blood draw vascular function measurement take HGNS device activate , treatment , temporary treatment withdrawal period . The researcher hypothesize aforementioned measurement significantly improve following HGNS therapy return baseline value follow therapy withdrawal period .</detailed_description>
