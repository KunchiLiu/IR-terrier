	<brief_summary>Exercise many benefit people multiple sclerosis ( MS ) , improved physical symptom , mood , fatigue , cognition . However , many people MS refrain exercise discomfort exhaustion overheat experience . This study investigate use aspirin exercise treatment reduce overheat exhaustion , thereby avail many people MS opportunity benefit exercise . The investigator recently publish first-ever report elevate body temperature relapsing-remitting MS ( RRMS ) patient relative healthy control , elevate temperature link bad fatigue . This finding body temperature elevate link fatigue RRMS lay groundwork paradigm shift understand treatment fatigue . That , focus shift exogenous endogenous temperature , stimulant medication cool treatment . A recent study compare healthy adult adult MS show whereas exercise increase body temperature group , MS group correlate exhaustion . The reason may relate elevation rest body temperature relapsing-remitting MS ( RRMS ) patient relative healthy control . The finding clinically meaningful , elevate body temperature correlate bad fatigue patient . Exercise Aim : To determine whether pretreatment ASA ( compare placebo : within subject crossover design ) exercise result improve exercise performance ( i.e. , increased time-to-exhaustion ) . The investigator hypothesize participant tolerate exercise longer take ASA placebo . This hypothesis base ) demonstrate efficacy antipyretic reduce body temperature exercise healthy control , b ) demonstrate efficacy antipyretic reduce fatigue non-exercising MS patient , c ) demonstrate efficacy elaborate ( unblinded ) cool treatment ( e.g. , cool garment , cool hand chamber ) improve exercise performance MS patient . Note project especially important MS patient , disease-specific body temperature elevation sensitivity heat ( i.e. , Uhthoff 's ) .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Exercise beneficial people MS . Exercise many benefit person multiple sclerosis ( MS ) , include increase muscle strength , improve balance , decrease fatigue , decrease depression , improved memory , improve quality life . In addition clinical improvement , direct indirect neural evidence beneficial effect exercise MS. For example , work experimental autoimmune encephalopathy ( EAE ) animal model MS show exercise protect demyelination , increase brain-derived neurotrophic factor ( BDNF ) , reduce myelin damage axonal damage . Consistent pre-clinical research , MS work human show increased BDNF reduction pro-inflammatory circulate cytokine ( i.e. , IL-22 ) exercise 24 week versus maintain sedentary lifestyle period time . In preliminary MS work group , 12 week aerobic exercise result increased hippocampal volume hippocampal functional connectivity . Exercise consider candidate disease-modifying treatment . However , exercise beneficial people . Despite preponderance evidence exercise 's salutary effect , many MS patient deter overheat exhaustion bring exercise . And good evidence long-term safety profile exercise MS , many patient put short-term discomfort , despite physically capable exercise . Exercise cause overheat people MS . In healthy people , exercise trigger conversion metabolic mechanical energy , result liberation approximately 30-70 % total energy heat , cause increase core body temperature . As core body temperature increase , exercise performance worsens . Exercise person MS also raise body temperature , heat-related MS symptom increase follow exercise . This consistent Uhthoff 's phenomenon : well-known deleterious impact heat exposure exercise person MS . The investigator recently add essential piece puzzle , report first time person relapsing-remitting MS ( RRMS ) elevate body temperature even expose heat exercising ( i.e. , rest ) relative healthy control . Importantly , elevation body temperature clinically meaningful warmer rest body temperature link bad fatigue patient RRMS.Not find represent paradigm shift conceptualization heat sensitivity / heat exposure person MS , highlight additional burden exercise-induced heat people already warmer exercise begin . Exercise increase body temperature everyone ; however , recently report person MS ( compare healthy control ) exercise-induced increase body temperature link exhaustion . Elevated body temperature rest person RRMS may key reason , may also point cool effective treatment . Cooling treatment effective people MS. Elevated body temperature link bad fatigue RRMS patient align positive result several non-exercise trial cool treatment reduce fatigue MS patient none consider target endogenously elevate body temperature . Aligned evidence show cool treatment administer MS patient prior exercise improve performance reduce exhaustion . For example , one study , ten MS patient use hand-cooling chamber walk treadmill : subject keep one hand airtight device , rigid chamber suspend bungee cord treadmill throughout exercise . Cooling result 33 % increase exercise duration MS patient keep hand chamber . These finding support beneficial impact cool exercise , although method may difficult replicate / standardize , implement clinically . In work , whole-body precooling cool vest cap use successfully decrease perceive exertion exercise . Yet another method cool via immersion cold water bath prior exercise find reduce perceive exertion exercise . By way mechanism , Marino explain heat-fatigue link MS propose heat reaction blockade action potential demyelinate neuron ( i.e. , frequency-dependent conduction block ) , note demyelination present , small increase temperature ( e.g. , amount induce exercise ) necessary completely block action potential . This consistent seminal work giant squid axon demonstrate disruption action potential presence small , incremental increase exogenous heat , ultimately result reversible 'heat block ' ( cessation neuronal conduction ) . An encouraging observation effect warm completely reversible experimental model . Cooling exercise effective treatment person RRMS . Taken together , evidence support cool treatment effective mean improve exercise performance patient MS , although notably , prior exercise study MS consider elevate core rest body temperature . Note find elevate body temperature specific RRMS ; prior exercise cool study restrict selection criterion relapsing-remitting phenotype . By current proposal , investigator expect reveal large effect cool since relapsing-remitting MS patient elevate body temperature rest likely experience exercise-induced fatigue ( therefore need effective cooling treatment ) . Prior method experimental cool cumbersome ( e.g. , cool garment , immersion cool bath prior exercise , insertion one hand vacuum cool chamber exercise ) , thereby limit replication standardization research use , restrict practicality clinical use . Here , investigator propose test effectiveness oral antipyretic take exercise ( i.e. , administer 1-hour prior exercise order reach peak serum concentration ) . Work healthy adult show antipyretic administration exercise reduce body temperature strenuous exercise hot environment , improve performance ( i.e. , increase time-to-exhaustion ) . Aspirin ( acetylsalicylic acid , ASA ) select , show effectively reduce fatigue prior non-exercise trial MS ( none consider aspirin 's antipyretic mechanism action key factor underlie treatment efficacy ) .</detailed_description>
