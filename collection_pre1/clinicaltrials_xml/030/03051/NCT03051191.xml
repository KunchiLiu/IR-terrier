	<detailed_description>It report subject cardiovascular disease ( CVD ) high incidence cancer compare general population . Because genetic traditional commonality underlie cause CVD cancer , investigator hypothesize share molecular mechanism play pivotal role pathogenesis CVD include heart failure ( HF ) cancer . MicroRNAs ( miRNAs ) small , single-stranded non-coding RNA sequence 18-22 nucleotide interact specific target messenger RNAs . They know involve various process include development , homeostasis , cell differentiation , proliferation , apoptosis various disease modulate post-transcriptional translational process . Some miRNAs report involved pathogenesis cancer . Cell free DNAs ( cfDNA ) extracellular nucleic acid find cell-free plasma human . Elevated level cfDNA report patient cancer CVD . 16S ribosomal RNA ( rRNA ) gene distinct microbiota , utilized quantify bacterial DNA systemic circulation . 16S rRNA gene also show elevated patient CVD . These finding imply possibility translocate microbiota might play pivotal role pathogenesis CVD cancer . The quantity composition gut microbiota show alter various disease include obesity , diabetes mellitus , hypertension CVD . The previous finding fecal transplantation experiment , show disease phenotype transfer one another subject ( animal human ) , strongly suggest possibility microbiota play pathogenic role disease . To address hypothesis , investigator go cross-sectionally explore expression pattern miRNA cfDNA composition gut microbiota extensively patient without atherosclerotic CVD ( ACVD ) , non-ischemic HF ( NIHF ) , cancer . The investigator recruit participant patient regularly visit outpatient clinic Sakakibara Heart Institute The Cancer Institute Hospital Japanese Foundation Cancer Research . The investigator recruit patient without ACVD NIHF with/without cancer ( Group 1/2 ) , ACVD with/without cancer ( Group 3/4 ) , NIHF with/without cancer ( Group 5/6 ) . Their peripheral blood drawn stool collect . miRNA exosome extracted plasma explore miRNA microarray . cfDNA pattern extensively explore microarray . By compare expression pattern miRNA cfDNA , composition gut microbiota 16 rRNA gene shotgun analysis , investigator seek find molecular mechanism share disease .</detailed_description>
