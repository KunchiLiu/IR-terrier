	<brief_title>A Randomized Phase II Study Of Eribulin Mesylate With Without Pembrolizumab For Metastatic Hormone Receptor Positive Breast Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This research study Phase II clinical trial . Phase II clinical trial test safety effectiveness investigational intervention learn whether intervention work treat specific disease . `` Investigational '' mean intervention study . In research study , The investigator evaluate safety effectiveness Eribulin mesylate without Pembrolizumab metastatic hormone receptor positive breast cancer . The FDA ( U.S. Food Drug Administration ) approve combination Pembrolizumab Eribulin mesylate Breast Cancer . The FDA approve Pembrolizumab specific type breast cancer approve United States disease . The FDA approve Eribulin mesylate treatment option type breast cancer . Pembrolizumab medicine may treat cancer work immune system . The immune system body 's natural defense disease . The immune system send type cell call `` T cell '' throughout body detect fight infection disease , include cancer . For type cancer , T cell work prevent attacking tumor . Pembrolizumab think work block protein T cell call PD-1 ( `` program death 1 '' ) , may allow cell part immune system attack tumor . Eribulin mesylate develop natural substance find sea sponge . Eribulin mesylate work prevent cancer cell multiply . The combination Pembrolizumab Eribulin mesylate investigational . The study drug , give separately , work different way stop cancer cell grow spread . However , know give two study drug time well anti-cancer effect give treatment .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Patients must histologically cytologically confirm Stage IV invasive breast cancer . Patients without pathologic cytologic confirmation metastatic disease unequivocal evidence metastasis physical examination radiologic evaluation . Subjects must least one lesion within previously radiate field evaluable computerized tomography ( CT ) magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) scan per RECIST version 1.1.46 Participants must HR positive , HER2negative breast cancer ( ER &gt; 1 % and/or , PR &gt; 1 % , HER2negative per ASCO CAP guideline , 2013 result primary tumor and/or metastatic lesion ) . Participants must already receive intolerant least two line hormonal therapy ( include adjuvant metastatic setting ) appropriate candidate chemotherapy Prior chemotherapy : Participants allow receive 2 prior line chemotherapy metastatic setting . The last dose chemotherapy must 14 day prior registration . Participants adequately recover acute toxicity prior treatment . No prior treatment eribulin mesylate allow . Prior biologic therapy : The last dose biologic investigational therapy must least 3 week prior registration . Prior hormonal therapy : Hormonal therapy must discontinue 14 day prior participation . However , continuation ovarian suppression allow . Prior radiation therapy : Participants may receive prior radiation therapy either metastatic earlystage set . Radiation therapy must complete least 14 day prior study participation . Biphosphonates/Denosumab : Participants bisphosphonates/denosumab may continue receive bisphosphonate therapy study treatment . Participants must archival tumor sample available ( 1 block 20 unstained slide ) . If archival tissue available , participant must willing undergo research biopsy disease safely accessible . Age ≥ 18 year age ECOG performance status ≤2 ( Karnofsky ≥60 % , see Appendix A ) Participants must normal organ marrow function define : absolute neutrophil count ≥1,500/mcL platelets ≥100,000/mcL hemoglobin ≥ 8 g/dl total bilirubin ≤1.5 × institutional upper limit normal ( ULN ) AST ( SGOT ) /ALT ( SGPT ) ≤2.5 × institutional ULN ( ≤ 5 × institutional ULN document liver metastasis , serum creatinine ≤1.5mg/dL calculate GFR ≥60 mL/min INR/PT ≤1.5 time ULN unless participant receiving anticoagulant therapy , long PT PTT within therapeutic range intend use anticoagulant aPTT/PTT ≤1.5 time ULN unless participant receiving anticoagulant therapy , long PT PTT within therapeutic range intend use anticoagulants The effect eribulin mesylate pembrolizumab develop human fetus unknown . Preclinical data suggestive teratogenic effect eribulin mesylate . For reason woman childbearing potential men must agree use adequate contraception ( hormonal barrier method birth control ; abstinence ) duration study participation 4 month last dose eribulin mesylate and/or pembrolizumab . Note : abstinence acceptable usual lifestyle prefer contraception subject . Should woman become pregnant suspect pregnant partner participate study , treat physician principal investigator inform immediately . While study , woman must breastfeed . Subjects childbearing potential define surgically sterilize and/or menstrual period past year Female subject childbearing potential , define , must either negative urine negative serum pregnancy test within seven ( 7 ) day first dose pembrolizumab . If urine test positive confirm negative , serum pregnancy test require . Ability understand willingness sign write informed consent document Chemotherapyrelated radiationrelated toxicity resolve Grade 1 severity low , except stable sensory neuropathy ( ≤ Grade 2 ) alopecia . Participants receive investigational agent . Previous treatment eribulin mesylate antiPD1 , PDL1 , PDL2 agent participation MK3475 Merck study . History allergic reaction attribute compound similar chemical biologic composition eribulin mesylate pembrolizumab . Known brain metastasis untreated , symptomatic , require therapy control symptom . Participants previously diagnose brain metastasis eligible complete treatment least 4 week prior registration , neurologically stable absence new neurologic symptom last 4 week prior study entry , recover effect radiotherapy surgery . Any corticosteroid use brain metastasis must discontinue without subsequent appearance symptom ≥2 week first study drug . Treatment brain metastasis may include whole brain radiotherapy , radiosurgery , combination deem appropriate treating physician . Uncontrolled intercurrent illness , include , limited uncontrolled hypertension , unstable angina pectoris , uncontrolled cardiac arrhythmia , congestive heart failureNew York Heart Association Class III IV , active ischemic heart disease , myocardial infarction within previous six month , uncontrolled diabetes mellitus , gastric duodenal ulceration diagnose within previous 6 month , chronic liver renal disease , severe malnutrition psychiatric illness/social situation would limit compliance study requirement . Clinically significant electrocardiogram ( ECG ) abnormality , include mark baseline prolong QT/QTc ( [ QT interval/corrected QT interval ] , eg , repeat demonstration QTc interval &gt; 500 m ) . Medcial condition require chronic systemic steroid therapy form immunosuppressive medication . For example , participant autoimmune disease require systemic steroid immunosuppression agent exclude . Replacement therapy ( eg. , thyroxine , insulin , physiologic corticosteroid replacement therapy adrenal pituitary insufficiency , etc . ) consider form systemic treatment . History evidence active , noninfectious pneumonitis require treatment steroid . History interstitial lung disease . Participants know positive human immunodeficiency virus ( HIV ) , Hepatitis B antigen ( HepBsAg ) , Hepatitis C virus ( HCV ) RNA . HIVpositive participant combination antiretroviral therapy ineligible potential pharmacokinetic interaction Pembrolizumab and/or eribulin mesylate . In addition , participant increase risk lethal infection . Individuals history second malignancy ineligible except follow circumstance . Individuals history malignancy eligible diseasefree least 5 year deem investigator low risk recurrence malignancy . Individuals follow cancer eligible diagnose treat within past 5 year : cervical cancer situ , nonmelanoma cancer skin . Patients cancer diagnose within past 5 year felt low risk recurrence discuss study sponsor determine eligibility . Has receive live vaccine within 28 day plan start study therapy</criteria>
