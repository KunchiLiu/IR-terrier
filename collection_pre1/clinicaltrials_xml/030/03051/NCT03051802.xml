	<detailed_description>High dose rate brachytherapy use limited number esophagus lung patient , often combination external beam radiation therapy . The procedure use applicator inserted lumen applicator connect automate `` afterloader '' , device radioactive brachytherapy source attach thick guide wire position source within applicator set position time base treatment plan . Identification ideal applicator position determine white light endoscopy . With endoscope lumen , fluoroscopic image visualize endoscope position . Temporary radio-opaque skin marker place patient 's anterior surface fluoroscopy image align endoscope tip . The proximal distal end target volume mark manner surgeon stop endoscope position . The endoscope remove applicator insert , position applicator `` dummy '' seed ( i.e . non-radioactive seed use position purpose ) align fluoroscopy match skin marker . The procedure 2 disadvantage : . There extra radiation dose clinical staff due fluoroscopy use identify source position . ii . Visualization 2D , inaccurate since account separation vertical direction angle projection applicator patient surface . Furthermore , movement fluoroscopy device insertion lead error visualization . Medical application navigate endoscopy continue grow , especially use combination volumetricimaging image-guided procedure . This feasibility study aim use navigation endoscopy technology overcome disadvantage current practice improve overall process . In propose protocol , applicator insertion , track record endoscope applicator position would enable placement applicator use 3D information , great accuracy without extra radiation dose clinical staff . The track technology would use replace use radio-opaque skin marker ; rather place marker patient 's skin , location target volume boundary would note tracker position within endoscope . Applicator insertion would also track , applicator position base location applicator relative previously record endoscope position , include location distal proximal end target volume .</detailed_description>
