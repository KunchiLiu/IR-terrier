	<brief_summary>This study conduct 24 patient ischemic dilate cardiomyopathy , underwent non cardiac surgery low half body effect combine spinal epidural anesthesia Assiut university hospital . Intraoperative Hemodynamic monitoring include invasive blood pressure , heart rate , CVP establish , addition pre postoperative , 12 lead ECG , echocardiography , venous sample Brain natriuretic peptide measurement do . This study try assess safety anesthetic technique group cardiac patient along hospital stay period 6 month postoperatively , addition predictability Brain natriuretic peptide cardiac biomarker regard major adverse cardiac event cardiac mortality group patient .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Dilated cardiomyopathy ( DCM ) characterize ventricular dilatation impair systolic cardiac function . Anesthetic management , patient cardiomyopathy reduce systolic function , challenge may associate high mortality . Objective : The purpose study evaluate hemodynamic effect combine spinal epidural anesthesia ( CSEA ) patient dilate cardiomyopathy , underwent vascular surgery low half body , addition ass safety anesthetic technique early postoperative period . Method : After approval local research ethic committee Faculty Medicine , inform write consent obtain patient , 24 patient dilate cardiomyopathy , subject vascular surgery lower half body CSEA . The effect CSEA hemodynamics ; IBP , HR CVP ( measure base line every 10 min ) , addition cardiac complication hospital stay period study .</detailed_description>
