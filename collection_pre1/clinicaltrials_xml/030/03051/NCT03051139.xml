	<brief_title>A Strategy Improve Implementation LTVV Patients w/ ARDS</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Setting : This multi-ICU , single-center cluster randomize trial conduct among patient clinician four adult ICU service Northwestern Memorial Hospital . Each ICU service act cluster . Each ICU service care patient one two physical ICU location : - MICU service ( Medical ICU location ) - NCC service ( Neuroscience/spine ICU location ) - ACC service ( Cardiothoracic/transplant ICU neuroscience/spine ICU location ) - SCC service ( Cardiothoracic/transplant ICU surgical ICU location ) Overall Study Design : The study consist pre-trial period baseline data collection follow cluster randomize control trial . During pre-trial period , investigator retrospectively determine proportion patient ARDS ICU service receive least one ventilator set adherent LTVV previous one year ( baseline LTVV rate ) . At end pre-trial period , investigator randomize four ICUs service intervention group ( ICUs A B ) usual care group ( ICUs C D ) . Based pre-trial data , investigator calculate difference baseline LTVV rate ICUs A+B C+D , use calculate sample size necessary trial period . Following pre-trial period , ICUs A B begin receive implementation strategy ICUs C D continue usual care comparator group . All mechanically ventilate , non-ARDS patient four ICU service pre-trial trial period also include separate concurrent comparator cohort . This allow u assess temporal change LTVV use mechanically ventilate patient general , potential spill-over LTVV use non-ARDS patient ICUs A B . Phase I : Pre-trial cohort study The study begin pre-trial cohort study . The investigator conduct retrospective chart review mechanically ventilate patient admit one four participate ICUs within previous one year . All patient meet inclusion criterion either ARDS non-ARDS patient include . The main purpose pre-trial study establish baseline rate LTVV use study ICU , use part primary endpoint clinical trial describe . All secondary endpoint list Appendix collect patient pre-trial study . Phase II : Randomization At end pre-trial study , investigator randomize four ICU service intervention usual care group . The study statistician conduct simple randomization approach use computer-generated random number allocate four ICUs intervention ( 2 ICUs ) usual care group ( 2 ICUs ) , ensure two intervention two usual care ICUs . The intervention ICU service label ICU A ICU B , usual care ICU service label ICU C ICU D. The allocation ICU reveal study personnel calculation baseline LTVV rate ICU service . After randomization , investigator calculate baseline LTVV rate ICU ( therefore intervention usual care group ) . Based baseline LTVV rate , investigator finalize sample size calculation clinical trial . Phase III : Cluster randomize control trial After randomization process complete , person conduct ICU randomization reveal allocation ICUs study co-investigators . Immediately follow unblinding , cluster randomize control trial begin . The two ICUs randomize receive usual care ( ICUs C D ) expose intervention trial period . The two ICUs randomize intervention group ( ICUs A B ) receive intervention duration trial period . Implementation strategy/Intervention ( ICUs A B ) The multi-component implementation strategy/quality improvement intervention ICUs A B receive clinical trial consist three part : orientation , audit feedback , clinical decision support combine NLP-driven ARDS diagnostic screening tool , EHR-based task clinician complete , clinician reminder system . Implementation strategy component A : Orientation The attend fellow physician ICU nurse manager ICUs A B send email information orient study . Respiratory therapist send orientation email since rotate different ICUs . The text email show Appendix ( final wording may modify ) . Implementation strategy component B : Audit feedback Audit feedback direct ICU attending fellows . At end every ICU shift/rotation least five day , physician care least one ARDS patient ICU A B previous shift/rotation receive anonymous email study co-investigator provide specific rate LTVV ( number patient give LTVV / number ARDS patient manage ) . Implementation strategy component C : Clinical decision support The clinical decision support ( CDS ) intervention combine 1 ) ARDS screen tool use natural language processing ( NLP ) algorithm , 2 ) EHR-based task clinician complete , 3 ) clinician reminder system . 1 . Based prior research , investigator develop computer application automatically screen EHR real-time initial diagnostic criterion ARDS . If patient flag meet initial criterion , application download data necessary make diagnosis ARDS accord Berlin Definition . Part CDS intervention include natural language processing ( NLP ) program . The NLP program analyze download data determine whether patient ARDS accord Berlin Definition . 2 . If patient ICU A B identified ARDS , NLP program trigger EHR-based task clinician complete clinician reminder system . The NLP send alert least one member study team patient identify ARDS . 1 . The study team member create order set low tidal volume ventilation patient . This order set sign , direct attend and/or fellow physician sign . The order set include information patient 's current tidal volume , target tidal volume low tidal volume ventilation , order initiate low tidal volume ventilation . In addition , co-investigator also enter task patient 's nurse RT . The task alert nurse RT patient ARDS , discuss initiate low tidal volume ventilation patient 's physician . 2 . The study team member receive NLP alert also send text page pager attend , fellow , resident physician currently take care newly identify ARDS patient . The page contain text suggest physician consider diagnosis ARDS initiate LTVV . For patient ICUs A B identify ARDS report co-investigator , subsequently start LTVV within 24 hour clinical decision support intervention describe , EHR-based task web page repeat every 24 hour .</detailed_description>
