	<brief_summary>Angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor ( ACEIs ) among frequently prescribe medication worldwide treatment essential hypertension , leave ventricular systolic dysfunction , acute myocardial infarction , prevention progression diabetic nephropathy . However , outcome ACEI treatment varies significantly individual select population . Suboptimal response , therapeutic failure , significant side effect commonly document patient receive ACEI therapy . Approximately 80 % ACEIs available use US synthesize esterify prodrugs order improve otherwise poor oral bioavailability active molecule . The activation ACEI prodrugs primarily occur liver via metabolic de-esterification parent drug . The critical activation step essential deliver successful therapeutic outcome since active metabolite approximately 10-1000 time potent relative respective parent compound . Carboxylesterase 1 ( CES1 ) , abundant hydrolase liver , responsible activation ACEI prodrugs human . Marked interindividual variability CES1 expression activity document , result vary therapeutic efficacy tolerability many drug serve substrate CES1 . Genetic variation CES1 consider major factor contribute variability CES1 function . The study team propose conduct multiple-dose healthy volunteer study evaluate impact CES1 genetic variation activation , pharmacokinetics , pharmacodynamics enalapril , model ACEI prodrug activate CES1 . The completion study represent major step towards establishment evidence base individualize use ACEI prodrugs emerge .</brief_summary>
