	<brief_summary>Background : The QT interval electrocardiogram ( ECG ) , correct heart rate ( QTc ) , measure duration ventricular repolarization widely use marker ventricular arrhythmia risk . Testosterone shorten effect QTc length , QTc interval male shorter female onset puberty . Transgender female adolescent treat GnRH agonist spironolactone suppress endogenous testosterone secretion might increase QT interval sufficiently increase risk malignant ventricular arrhythmia . There current guideline regard monitoring QTc interval transgender female undergo GnRH agonist treatment . Objective : To assess effect GnRH agonist treatment QTc interval transfemale youth . Methods : A quasi-experimental time series study transgender female adolescent , see UCSF Child Adolescent Gender Center ( CAGC ) 2017-2019 . Specific aim : To assess impact GnRH agonist treatment QTc interval length transgender female adolescent</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>The Relation GnRH Treatment QTc Interval Transgender Females</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This study quasi-experimental time series study , design examine relation GnRH agonist treatment 6 month transgender female youth electrocardiographic change QTc interval . Study subject identify visit UCSF Child Adolescent Gender Center ( CAGC ) . A baseline electrocardiogram ( ECG ) obtain clinic initiation GnRH agonist treatment 6 month follow appointment . Sampling scheme : Consecutive sample transfemale patient present UCSF CAGC ( Child Adolescent Gender Center ) clinic meet entry criterion , consent participate study Recruitment strategy : The investigator approach transfemale patient pubertal Tanner stage 4-5 ready start GnRH agonist . From past experience CAGC clinic , willingness patient participate study high . The investigator plan ECG available clinic visit assist recruitment . Retention strategy : Patients treat CAGC clinic follow every 3 month . Patients compliant clinic visit patient eager complete transition . ECG plan available 6 month clinic follow visit . Measurements : The investigator assess QTc interval use standard 12-lead ECG . The investigator also measure serum level calcium , potassium magnesium rule electrolyte abnormality cause QTc interval change , testosterone , estradiol , LH FSH level assess GnRH agonist effect . The laboratory analytes measure use standard procedure place UCSF Laboratory , certify Centers Medicare Medicaid Services , California Department Health Services , College American Pathologists . Outcome : A 12-lead ECG perform use standardize inspected equipment , baseline 6 month treatment . ECG read evaluation do board certify cardiologist . QT interval correct heart rate assess use Fridericia 's correction ( QTcF = QT/RR^0.33 ) , currently prefer accordance E14 ICH Guideline adopt FDA EMA 2005 . To minimize observer bias , board certify cardiologist read ECGs determine QT interval length blind status GnRH agonist treatment . Potential confounding variable : As time series study participant serve control , individual characteristic age , race genetic factor eliminate confound factor . Although study within group design , typical disadvantage research design , like learn effect , regression mean secular trend seem relevant . The investigator need monitor factor may change participant time might act cofounder mediator : - Serum calcium , magnesium , potassium level - BMI - Starting medication prolong QT interval : antihistamine , antiemetic promotility drug , azole antifungal , fluroquinolones , macrolides , antipsychotic , selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor . Statistical issue Analysis approach : A paired T test use statistical analysis . Data management plan : The investigator use Research Electronic Data Capture ( REDCap ) system create form ( appendix 1 ) enter study patient information . The investigator use REDCap installation , store REDCap data server , locate UCSF Minnesota Street data center . These server maintain behind firewall secure server room ; server back regularly off-site . Ethical consideration : This study involve obtain ECG , minimal risk participant . Other information need study , include blood test measurement , part regular clinical care CAGC clinic . After data initially gather entered , de-identified use unique research identification number , protect participant 's privacy .</detailed_description>
