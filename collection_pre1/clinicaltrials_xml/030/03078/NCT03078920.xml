	<brief_summary>The objective investigate new Naida CROS device adult recipient include chronic phase generate preliminary pre-launch data . The formal study objective compare speech intelligibility quiet noise use CROS device Naida CI Q70 processor versus Naida CI processor alone quiet noise condition . Subjects test without CROS baseline visit follow-up visit take place one month three month baseline . Subjects use new device home first two visit appointment use Naida CI processor two additional week well evaluate handicap access contralateral signal input . There four visit centre total . Subjective feedback collect questionnaire like APHAB Speech , Spatial Qualities Hearing Scale ( SSQ ) . A customised questionnaire focus usability benefit CROS also administer . Additional interest study evaluate acclimatisation effect CROS device objectively subjectively .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Benefits Contralateral Routing Signals ( CROS ) System Unilateral CI-recipients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Nowadays , cochlear implant ( CI ) widely use prosthesis deaf people . They stimulate auditory nerve cell electrically , circumvent tympanic membrane ossicle middle ear inner outer hair cell inner ear . A single cochlear implant usually provide substantial benefit recipient previously severe-to-profoundly deaf . In quiet listening situation , score perception sentence typically show strong ceiling effect . However , even moderately challenge listen situation , speech need understood present low level presence compete noise , speech perception score drop level required support practical communication . The speech reception threshold ( SRT ) , signal-to-noise ratio ( SNR ) require understand 50 % word sentence normal hearing subject listen first language , around -6 decibel ( dB ) . For CI recipient +9 +15 dB . These figure relate test situation target speech come directly front CI recipient . If sound come un-implanted side , typically suffer 6 dB attenuation , figure agreement publish literature , information rich high frequency even attenuate . This put unilaterally implanted CI user difficult position . Bilateral cochlear implantation show provide advantage although main advantage deal head shadow problem , rather restore true binaural hearing advantage spatial release masking . Bilateral implantation obviously expensive available adult many country . In addition , subject get second implant due medical reason want undergo second surgery . These subject similar limitation single-sided deaf ( SSD ) patient : due head shadow effect , soft sound direction non-implanted side heard . To overcome limitation , contralateral routing signal ( CROS ) mean contralateral receiver could beneficial tool . This system already use hear instrument field show benefit patient suffer single-sided deafness . Some preliminary study use experimental device also conduct cochlear implant user show similar benefit . A comparable system , Naída CROS device , develop Advanced Bionics contralateral receiver evaluate study . The Naída CROS device place contralateral ear similar small hearing aid . It capture incoming sound transmits wirelessly CI sound processor . In sound processor , signal ipsilateral contralateral side mixed together . While work do acutely hear instrument prototype , study evaluate Naída CI device Naída CROS device involve take home experience . The study evaluate benefit add CROS device unilaterally implanted subject objectively subjectively . A microphone place unilateral CI recipient 's non-implanted ear . This microphone detect sound head-shadowed side route CI sound processor . In hear instrument field system commonly applied case unilateral deafness refer contralateral rout signal CROS system . The recent Advanced Bionics sound processor , Naída CI Q70 Q90 , ability communicate wirelessly another Naída CI processor , Phonak hear instrument model , include CROS device , place contralateral ear . The full microphone signal transmit wirelessly Naída CI sound processor mixed microphone signal implanted side . The Naída CROS device base Phonak CROS H20 device hardware . It contain essentially microphone , radio transmitter battery small discrete . The Naída CROS device design out-of-the-box solution work automatically Naída CI without need fitting . The Naída CI processor program use conventional fitting software SoundWave ( version 3.1 ) provide Advanced Bionics , enable wireless communication CI Naída CROS device . The software yet CE approve , test respect company 's internal standard . The CE approve CI system whole still use intend way study , i.e . `` restore level auditory sensation '' . All basic safety feature incorporate implant system remain active affected study . The Naída CROS device also work intended way without need programming . However , investigational Naída CROS device pre-configured research software instantaneously communicate approve Naída CI processor switch .</detailed_description>
