The investigator propose investigate ventralis oralis posterior nucleus ( Vop ) thalamus new target DBS secondary dystonia . Prior development DBS , main surgical treatment dystonia thalamotomy . Although many different target thalamus , often do stag procedure , common successful target nuclei Vop , traditionally think pallidal receive area . Previous lesioning Vop produce improvement dystonia intolerable side effect , especially implant bilaterally . However , give secondary dystonia patient often report superior result primary dystonia reasonable believe side effect modulate , target Vop nucleus DBS could viable alternative Globus Pallidus interna ( GPi ) . Given Deep Brain Stimulation treatment inherently adjustable , conceivable setting Deep Brain Stimulation could adjust allow clinical benefit minimal side effect . Indeed , several scatter successful case report attest possibility .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Dystonia movement disorder see child adult characterize `` sustained intermittent muscle contraction cause abnormal , often repetitive , movement , posture , . '' Secondary dystonia evolve refer dystonia result damage nervous system degenerative disease process . While primary dystonia generally think arise genetic cause , secondary dystonias variety cause include perinatal injury ( cerebral palsy ) , central nervous system infection , traumatic brain injury , many different metabolic , neurodegenerative , mitochondrial condition . Secondary dystonia far common pediatric population primary dystonia , far recalcitrant standard pharmacologic surgical treatment include Deep Brain Stimulation . Given treatment dystonia develop primary dystonia apply secondary dystonia , surprising effectiveness gap exist . Thus , exist large unmet need develop new therapeutic , treatment strategy , outcome measure pediatric secondary dystonia . Deep Brain Stimulation ( DBS ) one therapeutic intervention potential improve secondary dystonia . DBS surgical treatment several different movement disorder evolve functional stereotactic neurosurgery technique initially use lesion specific deep brain structure . While Essential Tremor Idiopathic Parkinson 's Disease predictable consistent response rate DBS carefully select patient , response rate dystonia much inconsistent . One predictor success presence DYT-1 mutation , common know genetic cause primary dystonia . Success rate DYT-1 dystonia consistently high reduction dystonia typically great 80 % . However , result secondary dystonia much modest inconsistent . A recent meta-analysis find average , dystonia symptom measure common rating scale improve 23 % follow DBS dystonic cerebral palsy ( common cause secondary dystonia ) , however frequent case non-responders . Additionally , examination , radiological laboratory predictor good response DBS , except genetic confirmation DYT-119 . However , across primary secondary dystonia , young age time surgery ( less 21 year old ) short duration symptom ( less 15 year ) show likely predictive factor good postoperative outcome . This lead many suggest DBS offer early course intractable dystonia , prior development permanent complication orthopedic contracture . Thus , set upper age limit 25 account concern earlier implantation lead improve outcome . The low age limit 7 reflect fact current humanitarian exemption DBS dystonia currently go age 7 . Thus , exists need improve patient selection well application DBS secondary dystonia child .</detailed_description>
