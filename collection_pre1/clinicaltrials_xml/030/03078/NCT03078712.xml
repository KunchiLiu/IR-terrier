	<detailed_description>Early Goal Directed Therapy use Physiological Holistic View . A multicenter study Latin America : The ANDROMEDA-SHOCK Study Hypothesis Peripheral perfusion guide resuscitation septic shock associate low mortality , less organ dysfunction , le mechanical ventilation ( MV ) , less vasopressor load , less renal replacement therapy lactate-targeted resuscitation strategy . Using holistic view optimize tissue perfusion oxygenation investigator aim decrease mortality morbidity septic shock patient . A . Background Septic shock highly lethal condition associate mortality risk 30 60 % . It currently frequent cause death intensive care unit ( ICU ) investigator demonstrate recent Chilean prevalence study . Several pathogenic factor hypovolemia , myocardial depression , vasoplegia , microcirculatory abnormality induce progressive tissue hypoperfusion severe case . In context , persistent hyperlactatemia traditionally consider hallmark ongoing tissue hypoxia septic shock , therefore lactate normalization recommend resuscitation target Surviving Sepsis Campaign ( SSC ) . Pathophysiologic determinant persistent hyperlactatemia The physiologic basis lactate generation clearance septic shock matter active research . Hypovolemia-induced hypoperfusion probably predominant pathogenic mechanism early phase . Some patient resolve acute circulatory dysfunction clear lactate initial fluid resuscitation , others evolve persistent circulatory dysfunction hyperlactatemia . Several mechanism associate persistent hyperlactatemia besides hypoperfusion , recent literature highlight role sustain hyperadrenergia increase muscle aerobic glycolysis , condition denominate stress hyperlactatemia , also impair hepatic lactate clearance . The investigator explore significance potential determinant hyperlactatemia series clinical physiological study perform last 15 year . These study address three relevant pathogenic factor involve persistent hyperlactatemia : overt occult hypoperfusion , hyperadrenergic state impair hepatic clearance . The complexity subject also highlight recent study investigator demonstrate lactate decrease successful septic shock resuscitation exhibit biphasic pattern , early rapid decrease parallel normalization flow-sensitive variable ( see ) , follow slow recovery thereafter . The latter eventually related non-flow dependent mechanism hyperadrenergic state and/or delay hepatic clearance . Persistent hyperlactatemia initial resuscitation particularly difficult interpret suggest extensive research summarize . Optimizing systemic blood flow might reverse ongoing hypoperfusion , potential source anaerobic lactate generation . Under perspective , pathogenic factor involve hyperlactatemia potentially flow-sensitive , others . Distinction two scenario could strongly impact resuscitation . If persistent hyperlactatemia cause non-hypoperfusion-related mechanism , sustain effort aim increase CO could lead detrimental effect excessive fluid inotropes , fact well demonstrated literature . The decision consider patient fully resuscitate consequence stop intervention milestone , appear highly relevant since result number recent study increase awareness risk fluid overload and/or vasopressor inodilators pulmonary edema , increase intraabdominal hypertension , acute kidney injury , delay weaning , arrhythmia , hepatosplanchnic myocardial ischemia , among problem . By mean , over-resuscitation could eventually increase morbidity and/or mortality . Is hyperlactatemia valid resuscitation target septic shock ? Not surprisingly , lactate clearance normalization use worldwide resuscitation target . Indeed , SSC ambitious global collaboration critical care propose focus septic shock resuscitation normalize macrohemodynamic parameter lactate . SSC guideline follow many country adherence recommend management bundle report associated improved survival , although role individual component clear . Lactate clearance , define change lactate level two time-points , express 10-20 % hourly lactate reduction , decrease least 10 % 6h early resuscitation relate survival , test goal two important study conflict result . However , several unresolved aspect concern role lactate appropriate resuscitation target . First , clear select lactate clearance versus lactate normalization resuscitation goal equivalent , importantly , decision lead similar timely resolution tissue hypoperfusion hypoxia . Second , since non-hypoperfusion related cause hyperlactatemia might predominate unknown number patient , could lead over-resuscitation least state . Third , dynamic recovery lactate might exhibit biphasic pattern therefore , real-time response lactate fluid challenge could straightforward depend hypoperfusion context . Some survivor might even normalize lactate 24h evolution . Therefore , explore potential resuscitation target appear mandatory . Potential alternative resuscitation target septic shock A foremost priority rule ongoing hypoperfusion septic septic shock patient active resuscitation . The investigator recently propose simultaneous analysis central venous O2 saturation ( ScvO2 ) , central venous-arterial pCO2 gradient ( P ( cv-a ) CO2 ) , peripheral perfusion assess capillary refill time ( CRT ) , mottle score central-to-toe temperature difference , might helpful suggest hypoperfusion context patient without hyperlactatemia . From theoretical point view , three easily assessable perfusion-related variable offer important advantage lactate potential resuscitation target septic shock patient : clearly flow-sensitive exhibit much fast dynamic recovery systemic blood flow optimization . In word , parameter might clear minute fluid-responsive patient compare lactate , sometimes take hour recover . The investigator demonstrate analyze dynamic recovery parameter cohort ultimately survive septic shock patient . ScvO2 , P ( cv-a ) CO2 CRT already normal almost 70 % patient 2h fluid resuscitation , compare 15 % case lactate . However , also couple drawback perfusion-related flow-sensitive parameter . ScvO2 complex physiological variable . It widely use recently resuscitation goal critically ill patient , although several limitation may preclude straightforward interpretation change . For instance , normal even supranormal ScvO2 value rule-out global regional tissue hypoxia several reason highlight elsewhere , include severe microcirculatory derangement impair tissue O2 extraction capability . Vallee et al find persistent abnormal P ( cv-a ) CO2 value 50 % septic shock patient already achieve normal ScvO2 value initial resuscitation . Nevertheless , hyperdynamic state high efferent venous blood flow could sufficient wash global carbon dioxide ( CO2 ) generation hypoperfused tissue thus , P ( cv-a ) CO2 could normal despite presence tissue hypoxia . Another problem two variable necessarily require central venous catheterization assess , task might complex perform limited-resource setting emergency department ( ED ) . Therefore , peripheral perfusion appear promising alternative resuscitation target septic shock patient . Peripheral perfusion potential resuscitation target septic shock patient The skin territory lack auto-regulatory flow control , therefore sympathetic activation impairs skin perfusion circulatory dysfunction , process could evaluate peripheral perfusion assessment . Indeed , peripheral perfusion easily evaluate many way bedside , therefore , could valuable monitor tool setting . The presence cold clammy skin , mottle CRT frequently describe indication initiate fluid resuscitation patient sepsis-related acute circulatory dysfunction . The concept CRT , relevant parameter , base assumption . It propose initially trauma patient negative study find correlation systemic hemodynamics preclude research variable . More recently however , Lima et al find abnormal peripheral perfusion associate hyperlactatemia organ dysfunction critically ill patient . Other author confirm find build robust body evidence support strong prognostic value abnormal peripheral perfusion intensive care unit ( ICU ) context . The investigator observe CRT first parameter normalize cohort septic shock patient predict lactate normalization 24h survival . Moreover , recent clinical data suggest target peripheral perfusion septic shock resuscitation might improve outcome . van Genderen et al perform randomize control trial compare two resuscitation protocol ; one target normal peripheral perfusion standard management 30 ICU patient . The study demonstrate target peripheral perfusion safe , associate less fluid administration organ dysfunction . Therefore , parameter like CRT rapid-response time could useful test response treatment strong physiologic impact fluid loading , especially ED limited-resource setting . In prospective non publish study perform cohort 100 patient admitted ED , investigator find patient exhibit normal CRT initial fluid load hospital mortality le 10 % compare 55 % patient abnormal value . How fluid loading resuscitation improve peripheral perfusion ? There intricate relationship macrohemodynamics peripheral perfusion . Both affected hypovolemia tend improve parallel fluid-responsive patient . Their relative change , though , well correlate . The beneficial effect fluid vasoactive drug may explain increase CO perfusion pressure , decrease neurohumoral response hypovolemia , eventually direct effect microcirculatory level . Whatever mechanism , normalization peripheral perfusion parameter appear indicate successful reversal initial circulatory dysfunction . There data suggest vasopressor adjustment and/or inodilators could induce favorable effect peripheral perfusion microcirculation certain circumstance . Jhanji et al demonstrate increase mean arterial pressure ( MAP ) 90 mmHg norepinephrine ( NE ) dose 0.41 mcg/kg/min improve cutaneous tissue oxygen pressure ( PtO2 ) cutaneous microvascular red blood cell flux cohort septic shock patient . The group obtain similar result another cohort postoperative patient major abdominal surgery intervention consist stroke volume optimization fluid challenge inodilator ( dopexamine ) fix dose . Dubin et al demonstrate rise MAP 85 mmHg incremental dos norepinephrine ( NE ) 0.74 mcg/kg/min improve sublingual microcirculatory flow septic shock patient bad microcirculation baseline . Dobutamine fix dose 5 mcg/kg/min improve sublingual microcirculatory flow another cohort septic shock patient . On hand active vasodilation nitroglycerine induce clear improvement peripheral perfusion parameter group shock patient , despite mean fall MAP 14 mmHg . Based finding data , propose permisive hypotension could eventually improve microcirculatory driving-pressure patient acute circulatory failure . In summary , appear pharmacological therapy aim improve peripheral perfusion might individually tailor could imply increase lower vasopressor MAP , inodilators pure vasodilator accord clinical context . More recently Bakker et al , add another important piece information perform pilot study 30 septic shock patient subject early resuscitation . In study , CRT skin mottle correlate pulsatility index , sonographic surrogate vascular tone , visceral organ . This mean improvement peripheral perfusion might move parallel improvement hepatosplanchnic perfusion , eventually explain good prognosis associate recovery CRT related parameter . Using peripheral perfusion target resuscitation septic shock also several potential drawback . First , degree subjectivity inter-observer variability parameter use assess CRT mottling . Second , evaluate setting dark skin patient . Third , importantly , corpus evidence support improvement peripheral perfusion associate resolution profound tissue microcirculatory hypoperfusion , hypoxia still scanty . However , excellent prognosis associate CRT recovery , rapid-response time fluid loading , simplicity assessment , availability limit resource setting , recent data suggest might change parallel perfusion physiologically relevant territory hepatosplanchnic region , constitute strong background promote study evaluate usefulness guide resuscitation septic shock patient . Why compare peripheral perfusion lactate target septic shock resuscitation ? Summarizing theoretical background state , plausible normalization peripheral perfusion compare normalization rapid decrease ( &gt; 20 % /2h ) lactate might associate less fluid resuscitation secondarily less positive 24h fluid balance . Eventually , less positive fluid balance might associate less organ dysfunction , especially respiratory ( oxygenation , mechanical ventilation day ) , renal ( less increase creatinine renal replacement therapy ) , gastrointestinal ( less increase intra-abdominal pressure ) . In addition , peripheral perfusion targeted-resuscitation might also associate less vasopressor load inodilator use thus prevent set potential complication hepatosplanchnic hypoperfusion , arrhythmias myocardial ischemia . At end , could result less mortality combination previous reason . Hypothesis Peripheral perfusion guide resuscitation septic shock associate low mortality , less organ dysfunction , le mechanical ventilation ( MV ) , less vasopressor load , less renal replacement therapy lactate-targeted resuscitation strategy . Design Multicenter , open-label randomize control study , conduct supervision independent Data Safety Monitoring Board ( DSMB ) .

Principles general management Sepsis source identification treatment pursue priority first line treatment . A central venous catheter arterial line insert , use pulmonary artery catheter PiCCO device recommend patient past medical history heart failure concomitant ARDS . Echocardiography perform routinely soon possible admission evaluate basal cardiac function , repeat necessary aid assess preload status inferior vena cava distensibility necessary . NE vasopressor choice adjust MAP ≥ 65 mmHg patient . Hemoglobin concentration maintain 8 g/dl high optimize arterial O2 content . Mechanical ventilation setting adjust accord current recommendation . Rescue therapy epinephrine , vasopressin analogue , steroid different blood purification technique like high-volume hemofiltration decide follow usual practice involve center patient evolve refractory septic shock . C. Study protocol A sequential approach resuscitation follow group . Time 0 start point randomization , central venous catheter ( CVC ) arterial line place , basal measurement perform include hemodynamics blood sampling . The study period 8 hour , attend intensivists continue treatment accord usual practice department protocol . I . Tests Procedures study period Capillary refill time assessment CRT measure apply firm pressure ventral surface right index finger distal phalanx glass microscope slide . The pressure increase skin blank maintain 10 second . The time return normal skin color register chronometer , &gt; 3 second define abnormal . Lactate measurements A normal lactate value define less 2 mmol/l . Lactate assess technique easily available center , include arterial serum level ( common gas analyzer central lab ) , capillary level lactate scout strip . Fluid responsiveness ( FR ) This first step . FR assess structured approach . Basically , dynamic predictor ( DP ) evaluate depend patient background status . In sedated adapt mechanically ventilated patient without arrhythmia , pulse pressure variation ( PPV ) stroke volume variation ( SVV ) use first choice . A FR+ status establish value ≥ 13 % 10 % , respectively . If negative , PPV SVV reassess transiently increase tidal volume ( VT ) 8 ml/kg ( one minute ) . An increase &gt; 3.5 % 2.5 % PPV SVV , respectively consider FR+ . In patient arrhythmia , preferred test end expiratory occlusion test 15 sec pause ( &gt; pulse pressure &gt; 5 % consider positive ) , echocardiography assess inferior vena cava ( IVC ) distensibility index ( &gt; 15 % consider + ) . In spontaneous breathe patient non-sedated patient MV , passive leg rise ( PLR ) maneuver perform early ( &lt; 1min ) increase pulse pressure &gt; 10 % consider FR+ . If obtain rule false negative response , maneuver repeat assess aortic velocity time integral ( VTI ) echocardiography PLR &gt; 15 % increase VTI accept FR+ . Fluid Challenge In FR+ patient , first resuscitation step administer fluid bolus ( FB ) 500 ml crystalloids every 30 min CRT normalize group A , DP become negative group B. DP CVP measure bolus group . Safety measure fluid challenge Central venous pressure ( CVP ) FR reevaluate fluid challenge . If CVP increase &lt; 5 mmHg FR still + , another FB administer goal reach . If CVP increase ≥ 5 mmHg FR - , fluid stop patient move next step . Vasopressor test In FR- patient persistent abnormal CRT still abnormal lactate decrease &lt; 20 % /2h , vasopressor test perform . In previously hypertensive patient , MAP increase range 80-85 mmHg transiently rise NE dos . CRT lactate rechecked ( CRT one h lactate 2h ) . If CRT normal group A , lactate normalizes decrease &gt; 20 % group B , resuscitation stop NE dose maintain . If , NE reduce pre-test dos , protocol move next step . In patient , MAP reduce range 60-65 mmHg transient decrease NE dos , objective principle state . Use inodilators Dobutamine 5 mcg/kg/min Milrinone 0.25 mcg/kg/min fix dos start , CRT lactate rechecked ( CRT one h lactate 2h ) . If , goal reach , drug discontinue action take study period , except recheck FR every hour restart fluid challenge patient get FR+ . In responder ( criterion vasopressor test ) , inodilator continue along study period . As safety measure , inodilators stop HR increase &gt; 15 % , arrhythmia , ischemia hypotension develop . Group A . Management peripheral perfusion-targeted resuscitation . In group , goal normalize CRT follow next step give order : 1 . Assessment FR 2 . Fluid challenge CRT normal , patient fluid unresponsive safety measure meet 3 . Vasopressor test 4 . Inodilator test As safety measure , resuscitation stop even normal CRT presence stable macrohemodynamics demonstrate heart rate ( HR ) &lt; 120 beat per minute , stable MAP increase vasopressor last hour . After CRT normalization step , CRT reassess hourly study period . If point , turn abnormal resuscitation sequence restart . Group B . Management lactate-targeted resuscitation . In group goal normalize lactate level get decrease rate least 20 % /2h , follow next step give order , always reevaluate lactate 2h interval . 1 . Assessment FR 2 . Fluid challenge FR- safety CVP limit reach bi-hourly interval lactate assessment 3 . Vasopressor test 4 . Inodilators Lactate assess every two hour 8h study period . If obtain lactate goal , lactate get abnormal decrease rate turn &lt; 20 % /2h follow bi-hourly control study period , resuscitation sequence restart . D. Sample size Mortality patient increase lactate level circulatory dysfunction show exceed 40 % . In addition , several study show abnormal peripheral perfusion associate mortality exceed 40 % . The investigator enroll 420 patient . With sample size study 90 % power detect reduction 28-day mortality 45 % 30 % , significance level 5 % , consider time-to-event analysis . The investigator consider decrease 15 % mortality direct clinical implementation effect . Similar effect mortality show early resuscitation study . In addition limit fluid administration patient septic shock normal peripheral perfusion show decrease organ failure , lead cause death patient . When aim small decrease mortality ( like 10 % ) , sample size would 57 % power detect benefit . Therefore investigator use adaptive approach allow sample-size re-estimation interim analysis 75 % sample recruit . The sample-size re-estimation conduct DSMB effect size observe interim analysis 10 % &lt; 15 % absolute reduction mortality . A small effect size would turn achieve adequate sample size unfeasible , whereas large effect size provide study 90 % power detect effect . E. Statistical analysis plan A detailed statistical analysis plan prepare proceeding patient enrolment . The essential characteristic statistical analysis plan describe . All analysis base intention-to-treat principle . The investigator assess effect peripheral perfusion-targeted resuscitation ( group A ) compare lactate-targeted resuscitation ( group B ) primary outcome hazard ratio 95 % confidence interval ( CI ) Kaplan-Meier curve comparison ( use log-rank test ) . Binary secondary outcome compare relative risk , 95 % CIs , chi-square test . Results continuous outcome normal distribution express mean difference , 95 % CI , P-value calculate t-test . Continuous outcomes asymmetrical distribution assess Wilcoxon test . The investigator analyze effect study fluid primary outcome follow subgroup : 1 . Patients lactate &gt; 4.0 mmol/l set SSC 2 . Patients without confirm source infection ( could increase translation study critically ill ) . 3 . Patients low APACHE II / SOFA score 4 . Patients 10 % difference lactate level first one measure baseline start study .</detailed_description>
