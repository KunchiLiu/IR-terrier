	<detailed_description>The study single center study conduct Leipzig University Hospital Heart Center Germany . 35 subject subject meet inclusion/exclusion criterion participate study . This study require use investigational product two independent manufacturer : Imricor Philips . Imricor develop ablation catheter relate accessory cable electrophysiology ( EP ) recorder/stimulator system . Philips develop image guidance map system compatible Imricor product . The Vision-MR Ablation Catheter use conjunction follow investigational product : Vision-MR Ablation Cable Set , Vision-MR Diagnostic Cable , interventional MRI Suite ( iSuite ) image guidance mapping system , dStream Interface ( dSIF-FE ) . With exception iSuite dSIF-FE , manufacture Philips , Imricor provide investigational device use study . Each procedure require two single-use Vision-MR Ablation Catheters one two single-use accessory catheter cable . Ablation treatment arrhythmia inherently complex procedure . Use investigational product list MR guidance emerge approach perform interventional electrophysiology procedure . The study population consist adult patient require ablation type I atrial flutter . Study subject require follow-up visit telephone call seven day post procedure . Accordingly , expect total study duration approximately 9 month study start plan February 2017 . This follow-up study NCT02699034 terminate early base recommendation oversight authority . The study device ( Vision-MR ablation catheter ) improve EP recorder/stimulator CE-marked .</detailed_description>
