	<brief_summary>Persistant hypoxemia newborn confers , even isolate , abnormal clinical situation , need address adequate diagnosis optimal treatment . If first hour life , hypoxemia frequent often transient , beyond , necessary search various etiological condition critical congenital heart disease ( CCHD ) non cardiac affection ( sepsis , anemia , respiratory disease ) . Newborn pulse oximetry screen identifies baby critical congenital heart disease ( CCHD ) base rational frequently degree hypoxemia may clinically undetectable . CCHDs life-threatening form congenital heart disease ( CHD ) occur 2-3/1000 live birth account 3 % -7.5 % infant death . Early detection beneficial acute collapse , result death , associate bad surgical neurodevelopmental outcome . Currently , screen CCHD involve antenatal ultrasound scan post-natal physical examination . Although antenatal detection rate improve recent year high 70 % -80 % center , consistent . Indeed , `` Nouvelle Aquitaine '' overall &lt; 50 % CCHDs detect birth . In addition , third infant CCHD may miss post-natal examination . Pulse oximetry screen help close `` diagnostic gap ' , increase detection baby slip current screening net . Several large European study subsequent meta-analysis show pulse oximetry screen highly specific ( 99.9 % ) moderately sensitive ( 76.5 % ) test increase CCHD detection rate . The high specificity result low false-positive rate 0.05 % 0.5 % . But baby Positive Test , may CCHD , may diagnose cause hypoxemia ( congenital pneumonia , sepsis , persistent pulmonary hypertension , ... ) . As CCHD , delayed recognition condition result postnatal collapse significant morbidity mortality . It also useful consider condition secondary target screen remember constitute 30 % -70 % false positive . In 2011 , US Health Human Services Secretary recommend pulse oximetry screen CCHD add Recommended Uniform Screening Panel . In Europe , implementation advance country North European Countries , Switzerland . There n't yet European guidance . In France , implementation limit local transient experiment . The feasibility , usefulness cost-effectiveness routine pulse oximetry screen evaluate far . The French set two specificity : 1/ antenatal detection rate consider rather high . 2/ contrast lot European country , early discharge maternity ward 48 hour life common , decrease risk discharge baby undiagnosed CCHD , save baby collapse . - The Investigators hypothesis routine pulse oximetry screen asymptomatic newborn would allow reduce incidence complication relate CCHDs well related non cardiac pathology reasonable cost French Health Care System .</brief_summary>
