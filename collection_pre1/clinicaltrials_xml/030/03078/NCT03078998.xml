	<brief_summary>Juvenile Idiopathic Arthritis ( JIA ) , Cerebral Palsy ( CP ) , Obstetric Brachial Plexus Injury ( OBPI ) common disorder cause upper extremity impairment child . Depending underlying pathology , common symptom disorder limitation upper extremity joint movement angle , muscle imbalance functional limitation cause contracture due problem . Daily life activity feeding , personal care , self mobility activity use upper extremity commonly limit child . Physical rehabilitation mostly use address problem . However , process rehabilitation difficult lengthy . In addition , time , classical rehabilitation discourage many young patient . Employment digital technology gain momentum address rehabilitation problem among medical professional . By utilize excite new sensor technology , Microsoft Kinect , Nintendo Wii Leap Motion , practical game base rehabilitation application become popular . Video Based Games ( VBG ) adopt technology Human Computer Interaction ( HCI ) interfaces recently use successfully task rehabilitation . The Leap Motion device , one new example technology , small form factor . It include two near infrared stereoscopic camera capture hand image patient produce 3 Dimensional ( 3D ) position hand joint fast rate sufficient positional precision . There examples use motion sensor base VBG 's rehabilitation different type patient group . Compared classical rehabilitation practice , application provide many advantage ease use , repeatableness , instantaneous measurable feedback . In addition , young patient involve application demonstrate willingness participate activity show considerable progress upper extremity rehabilitation . However , VBG 's mostly developed general public often suggest develop VBG 's specific task upper extremity rehabilitation child . It known upper extremity specific VBG 's application limit global domestic level . With project , plan design develop specialized Leap Motion base VBG 's child diagnose JIA , CP , OBPI . These VBG 's design easy use motivate child . They automatically lead patient correct hand exercise provide mechanism online performance measurement patient . The performance result patient compare result classical rehabilitation application standard The International Classification Functioning ( ICF ) . These game provide complete Turkish language support extend national dissemination project output . The propose project inherently multi disciplinary work require close interaction phisiotherapists , software expert , HCI specialist efficient application game patient . There specialized game disorder . These game utilize output Leap Motion device produce 3D hand joint position joint angle . Realistic animation hand virtual environment provide motivate exercise game platform patients.The performance measurement patient repeated game session . There game parameter game duration , difficulty level , hand joint focus . The game hand movement reflect daily life activity rehabilitation purpose would make game different general public game . The project find end project best game usage frequency duration , effectiveness design VBG 's result share scientific community publication seminar .</brief_summary>
