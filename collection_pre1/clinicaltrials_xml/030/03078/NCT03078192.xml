	<detailed_description>This study seek deploy several form 129Xe MRI contrast well emerge conventional proton MRI technqiues image lung structure perfusion . Specifically , 129Xe MRI scan provide 3D image ventilation gas exchange , spectroscopic index evaluate test gas exchange dynamic high temporal resolution . The conventional 1H MRI scan include free-breathing ultra-short echo time ( UTE ) scan provide image similar CT scan . In addition , characterize perfusion vascular dimension directly , patient undergo gadolinium-enhanced perfusion scan . The overall aim study follow : Aim 1 . Perform 129Xe MRI scan cohorts patient PVD , isolate left side heart failure isolate lung disease : 1.1 Deploy optimize 129Xe gas exchange MR spectroscopy imaging , 129Xe ventilation MRI , structural 1H UTE MRI , breath-hold 1H perfusion MRI . 1.2 Conduct comprehensive 1H-129Xe MRI 10 patient pure pulmonary arterial hypertension ( PAH ) 1.3 Conduct comprehensive MRI 10 patient pure leave heart failure 1.4 Conduct comprehensive MRI 10 patient pure lung disease pulmonary hypertension Aim 2 . Develop diagnostic criterion optimize sensitivity specificity 129Xe MRI diagnosis PVD : 2.1 Develop quantification/scoring method base PAH , leave heart disease , lung disease MRI 2.2 Develop reader training material train 3 expert reader 2.3 Begin prospective recruitment 92 patient evaluate PAH MRI scan Aim 3 . Perform large , single-blind study test diagnostic accuracy 129Xe MRI diagnosis PVD : 3.1 Trained reader evaluate 129Xe MRI , blind subject 's disease state determine presence severity PVD 3.2 Diagnostic accuracy 129Xe MRI compare gold standard hemodynamic clinical criterion PAH This single-blinded , open-label study enrol volunteer patient pure PAH ( 10 subject ) , pure leave heart disease ( 10 subject ) pure lung disease ( 10 subject ) [ Aim 1 ] follow large cohort 92 subject evaluate PAH [ Aim 2 ] . The investigator plan consent 122 subject . The sample size calculation base test whether propose diagnostic test base Xe MRI accuracy comparable image diagnostic procedure clinical practice , mammography . To end , investigator proposes test hypothesis H0 : AUC = 0.72 vs. H1 : AUC &gt; 0.85 , area curve ( AUC ) summary measure diagnostic accuracy obtain area receiver operate characteristic ( ROC ) curve display tradeoff sensitivity specificity propose Xe MRI base diagnostic test . Here AUC = 0.72 represent moderately accurate test AUC = 0.85 represent accuracy comparable clinical mammography . Based one side , one sample test variance approximate use binormal model , investigator estimate minimum sample size 46 normal 46 disease require test hypotheses significance level 5 % 80 % power .</detailed_description>
