	<brief_title>Prospective Study Stereotactic Body Radiation Therapy Thymoma Inoma : Therapeutic Effect Toxicity Assessment</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Thymoma mainly divide two type , invasive noninvasive type , 60 % patient belong noninvasive thymoma . When feasible , complete surgical resection primary treatment . There quite number thymoma patient lose surgical indication diagnose . Even complete resection , recurrence rate 20 % . For patient unresectable recurrent disease , radiation routinely administer , often combination systemic chemotherapy . However , wide range radiation , complication conventional radiotherapy limit treatment dose . The local recurrence rate conventional radiotherapy 16 % 45 % . Moreover , 's suitable patient severe heart lung disease . Stereotactic body radiation therapy ( SBRT ) well solve problem . On one hand , improve single dose , shorten total radiation treatment , also increase total dose equivalent biological effect ; On hand , SBRT , precise conformal radiation therapy , significantly reduce damage surround normal tissue . Theoretically , SBRT improve local control , well greatly reduce incidence radiation pneumonia , pericarditis , tracheitis , esophagitis . However , study focus treatment thymoma SBRT , except two case report Here perform prospective study treatment thymoma SBRT . The purpose prospective study preliminary evaluation feasibility , efficacy toxicity ofÎ³-SBRT treatment thymoma .</detailed_description>
