	<brief_summary>Rationale : In order compare real-world use commonly prescribe second-line oral diabetes therapy , real-world data compare patient receive treatment dapagliflozin v sitagliptin need , limited resource use cost data exist patient initiate dapagliflozin real-world setting . Objectives : Primary : The primary objective study compare real-world health care resource utilization cost follow treatment dapagliflozin versus sitagliptin . Secondary : The secondary objective study assess clinical outcome treatment pattern among patient receive treatment dapagliflozin versus sitagliptin . Study Design : Retrospective cohort study . Target Subject Population : Patients receive treatment either dapagliflozin sitagliptin evaluate . Study Variable ( ) : Primary Variables : Health care resource utilization cost Secondary Variables : Demographics measure index date , Quan-Charlson Comorbidity score , measure baseline period , Agency Healthcare Research Quality ( AHRQ ) -based comorbidity measure , receipt antidiabetic medication class baseline follow-up period , number percentage patient diagnosis obesity baseline follow-up period , treatment pattern follow-up period ( i.e. , index dose , duration treatment , discontinuation , adherence , receipt additional antidiabetic medication class ) , HbA1c outcomes ( among subgroup patient link laboratory data , sample size permitting ) , renal impairment , hypoglycemia define claims-based algorithm . Statistical Methods : Initial analysis descriptive nature entail tabular display mean value , median , range , standard deviation continuous variable interest ( e.g. , patient age ) frequency distribution categorical variable ( e.g. , sex , geographic location ) . Outcomes compare patient receive dapagliflozin versus sitagliptin use univariate test . Propensity score match undertaken reduce bias comparison patient receive treatment dapagliflozin versus sitagliptin . Following matching , demographic baseline characteristic assess use standardized difference determine balance post-matched sample . Outcomes assess use test pair data ( paired t-tests , sign rank test , McNemar 's test ) .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Characteristics Patients With Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus Receiving Treatment With Dapagliflozin Versus Sitagliptin : An Analysis Commercial Claims Linked Laboratory Data</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Rationale : In order compare real-world use commonly prescribe second-line oral diabetes therapy , real-world data compare patient receive treatment dapagliflozin versus sitagliptin need , limited resource use cost data exist patient initiate dapagliflozin real-world setting . Objectives : Primary : The primary objective compare real-world health care resource utilization cost follow treatment dapagliflozin versus sitagliptin . Secondary : The secondary objective study assess follow real-world data among patient receive treatment dapagliflozin versus sitagliptin : 1 . Patient demographic baseline clinical treatment characteristic 2 . Treatment pattern , specifically dose index date , duration treatment , adherence , discontinuation , receipt additional antidiabetic agent 3 . Clinical outcome treatment augmentation , include hypoglycemic event , renal impairment , HbA1c Study Design : Retrospective cohort study commercial medical pharmacy claim along enrollment information link laboratory result July 1 , 2013 April 30 , 2016 . Target Subject Population : Patients receive treatment either dapagliflozin sitagliptin evaluate analysis . The date first observe claim either dapagliflozin sitagliptin define index date . This study use intent- to-treat population , patient remain defined study cohort duration follow-up period , regardless treatment change . The baseline period define 6 month ' pre-index date , follow-up period define 12 month ' post-index date ( inclusive index date ) . Patients require continuous health plan enrollment baseline follow-up period . Patients least one claim diagnosis type 1 diabetes mellitus baseline period gestational diabetes evidence pregnancy baseline follow-up period exclude study population . Furthermore , patient exclude analysis receive selective sodium glucose co-transporter-2 ( SGLT-2 ) dipeptidyl peptidase 4 ( DPP-4 ) inhibitor baseline period . Patients receive treatment dapagliflozin match demographic , clinical , economic characteristic patient receive treatment sitagliptin use 1:1 propensity score matching technique . Study Variable ( ) : Primary Variables : Health care resource utilization cost Secondary Variables : 1 . Demographics measure index date 2 . Quan-Charlson Comorbidity score , measure baseline period 3 . Agency Healthcare Research Quality ( AHRQ ) -based comorbidity measure 4 . Receipt antidiabetic medication class baseline follow-up period . 5 . Number percentage patient diagnosis obesity baseline follow-up period 6 . Treatment pattern follow-up period 7 . HbA1c outcomes 8 . Renal impairment 9 . Hypoglycemia define claims-based algorithm Statistical Methods : All analysis include assessment patient demographic , patient characteristic , health care utilization cost descriptive nature entail tabular display mean value , median , range , standard deviation continuous variable interest frequency distribution categorical variable . Prior matching , outcome compare patient receive dapagliflozin versus sitagliptin use univariate test . In Phase 2 , propensity score match undertaken reduce bias comparison patient receive treatment dapagliflozin versus sitagliptin . Following matching , demographic baseline characteristic assess use standardized difference determine balance post-matched sample . Outcomes assess use test pair data .</detailed_description>
