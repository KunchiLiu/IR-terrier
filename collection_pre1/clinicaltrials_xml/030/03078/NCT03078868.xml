	<detailed_description>Percutaneous drainage intra-abdominal abscess occur complication colon rectal resection major advance management surgical patient . Proper patient selection critical safe effective management population . Almost ¾ patient undergo CT scan colorectal resection due clinical suspicion intrabdominal process least one fluid collection identify . These collection represent spectrum clinical entity consensus effective management collection even definition abscess . Currently , reliance radiologic criterion isolation lead overuse interventional procedure . For example , 40 % rim-enhancing collection sterile aspiration . The surgeon ' clinical suspicion abscess radiologic proximity anastomosis criterion useful predict abscess versus sterile collection . A consideration natural history abscess . Studies diverticulitis literature demonstrate abscesses less 3 cm great dimension successfully manage antibiotic alone , abscesses great 6.5 cm likely require intervention . However , leave great number abscesses 3 cm 6.5 cm fall uncertain ground . In contrast diverticulitis , reasonably infer associate abdominopelvic collection indeed abscess , management fluid collection identify post-operatively determination benefit drainage less clear . A novel radiologic technique high discrimination sterile infect collection would great clinical utility post-operative management fluid collection colorectal resection . The propose research project seek broaden applicability proven rarely used method , diffusion weight magnetic resonance imaging ( DW-MRI ) , discriminate sterile benign infect abdominopelvic fluid collection , order enhance utilization percutaneous drainage post-operative setting colorectal resection . Ability streamline limit MRI protocol efficiently obtain diffusion weight image abdominal cavity key apply methodology daily practice . Secondly , know whether DW-MRI effectively discriminate specifically post-operative sterile collection abscess . This one primary aim pilot study use generate hypothesis full-scale study . Adult patient undergone colon rectal resection University Chicago Medicine develop CT-proven abdominopelvic fluid collection &gt; 3 cm great dimension eligible inclusion study . The surgeon determine use traditional clinical radiologic factor whether percutaneous drainage desire . All patient discrete abdominopelvic fluid collection &gt; 3 cm great dimension undergo DW-MRI , take directly interventional radiology suite drainage , continue best medical care drainage felt unnecessary . Fluid send culture gram stain , well cell count . In addition , interventional radiology team qualify fluid notation 'purulent ' , 'serous ' , 'sanguinous ' , etc.. Any patient initially manage without drainage fail medical management ultimately undergo percutaneous drainage consider crossover group . DW-MRI reading analyze ADC value compare validated attempt report threshold apparent diffusion coefficient ( ADC ) reliably discriminate sterile infect post-operative fluid collection . The effect size utilization DW-MRI ( define change management decision pursue drainage hold drainage ) determine useful clinical tool . Because yet know DW-MRI interpret clinical setting , DW-MRI acquisition utilize way clinical care study patient . The DW-MRI data consider single-point intervention use define ADC threshold discriminate sterile infect collection . The data help u identify potential limitation DWI differentiation abscess non-infected collection allow u determine appropriate cohort size future clinical trial . Based correlation DWI clinical data , explore suggest novel acquisition analysis method quantitative DWI .</detailed_description>
