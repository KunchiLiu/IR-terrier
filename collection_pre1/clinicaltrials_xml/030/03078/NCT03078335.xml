	<brief_summary>Babies get infection 3 day age Neonatal Intensive Care Unit related delivery hospital environment . Preventing infection result shorter hospital stay baby , less risk long term health problem less health care resource require care . Hand wash alone n't remove bacteria hand healthcare worker , study show infection adult child admit hospital decrease health care provider use clean , non- sterile glove treat patient . The main focus study find use glove care newborn NICU well wash hand alone . McMaster Children 's Hospital The Hospital Sick Children pilot site participate future large study infant care use non-sterile glove , others care use standard hand wash method .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Glove-based Care NICU Prevent Late Onset Sepsis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Late onset sepsis ( LOS ) define infection occur 72 hour life neonate admit Neonatal Intensive Care Unit ( NICU ) . LOS lead severe complication include death , major neurologic sequela , contribute increase length stay cost care . These hospital acquire infection largely preventable . Hand wash prior patient care consider cornerstone prevention standard care NICU . Adherence hand wash however difficult achieve , estimate compliance among health care worker range 30 % 60 % . Observational study at-risk critically ill child suggest reduction hospital acquire infection central line associate bloodstream infection glove base care addition hand hygiene . One small single-centre randomize trial glove base care versus hand hygiene alone assess LOS rate extremely premature infant NICU show reduction gram positive infection central line infection glove-based care . We propose test effect glove base care adequately power , rigorously design conduct , cluster randomize control trial ( RCT ) complete feasibility pilot study . This pilot study include baby NICU randomize 6 month glove base care standard care , follow 6 month opposite arm . All health care provider contact infant require glove intervention arm , family infant admit NICU require wear glove . The main outcome measure number episode infection blood , urinary tract , cerebrospinal fluid compare glove intervention arm control arm . Invasive infection important challenge infant admit NICU reduce risk improve quality quantity neonatal survivor NICU .</detailed_description>
