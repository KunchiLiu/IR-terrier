	<brief_summary>The primary objective study evaluate safety efficacy use biocellular mixture emulsify adipose-derived tissue stromal vascular fraction ( AD-tSVF ) high density platelet-rich plasma concentrate ( HD- PRP ) . Additionally , comparison clinical outcome adipose-derived cellular Stromal Vascular Fraction ( AD-cSVF ) + AD-tSVF + HD PRP ; AD-cSVF + emulsify AD-tSVF + HD- PRP ; emulsify AD-tSVF + HD PRP + AD-cSVF ; AD-cSVF via intravenous infusion treatment Scaring Alopecias Alopecia Areata . Control serve use establish clinical protocol use platelet concentrate Matristem Matrix ( Acel ) inject fashion ARMs within study , comparative analysis perform endpoint study .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Biocellular-Cellular Regenerative Treatment Scaring Alopecia Alopecia Areata</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The aesthetic surgical &amp; cosmetic discipline hair restoration root numerous landmark study progressive medical science medical literature . With advent advanced theory science use cellular platelet-derived growth factor within scope regenerative medicine , well establish number peer-reviewed publication , The use biological modality , e.g. , HD-PRP concentrate ( define &gt; 4-6 time patient circulate baseline ) , become recognized number discipline , include value stimulation scalp tissue hair follicle androgenetic alopecia ( AGA ) . ( See Clinical Trial Study STRAAND ) . A `` retrograde '' fill technique create potential space subsequently inject space insure uniformity placement spread deliver treatment modality . This study design intend prospective , randomize , multi-center trial blind outcome independent observer , clinical provider , patient observation/satisfaction study comparative . The study propose adipose-derived cellular stromal component mixed platelet high density concentrate ( HD-PRP ) offer advantage produce markedly effective therapeutic profile treat patient scar alopecia 's ( SA ) alopecia areata ( AA ) , tissue age relate senescence , encourage vascular capability stimulation vasculoneogenesis . The benefit use autologous adipose-derived stem &amp; stromal cell ( ADSC ) population cell proliferation vasculogenesis intrinsically link native inflammatory modulation immunomodulatory capacity . Reports describe safety efficacy biocellular combination report peer review literature . In second third arm study , use regenerative protocol currently extensively utilized treatment degenerative musculoskeletal condition plastic surgical procedure safely effectively employ . These protocol feature use emulsify AD-tSVF + HD PRP ( ARM 2 ) compare use emulsify AD-tSVF + AD-cSVF ( cell enrichment ) + HD PRP ( ARM 3 ) contain full heterogeneous stem/stromal cell population native bioactive matrix . Addressing region scalp dermis contain microenvironment ( niche ) hair follicle , progenitor tissue ( `` bulge '' ) . In ARM 3 , addition cellular enrichment emulsify AD-tSVF accomplished via semi-automated , close sterile system ( Healeon CentriCyte 1000 system ) effectively isolate concentrate cellular element . The AD-cSVF mixed high-density platelet rich plasma ( HD-PRP ) concentrate emulsified AD-tSVF tissue prior target scalp injection . This injected cell-enriched product contains bioactive native adipose tissue scaffolding , autologous HD-PRP , cell-enriched adipose stem/stromal cellular concentration stromal/stem cell . In ARM 4 study , addition intravenous cellular deployment isolate cSVF perform follow without direct injection scalp site . Observations trial suggest increased hair growth shaft size , coloration speed note majority parenterally treat patient observed effect infusion . In future , clinical trial extension study combine component show ARM 3 add concomitant ARM 4 evaluate potential stimulation proliferative regenerative potential form combine therapy . It note several investigator parenteral u AD-cSVF unexpected outcome improve hair growth color change . All study ARMs ( exception comparative control ARM 1 ) test flow cytometry viability number , statistically compare outcomes follow study completion examine whether statistically significant difference result follow ARM show . The goal study demonstrate safety efficacy ARM . Biocellular injection scalp men woman diagnosis scar alopecias alopecia areata , full reporting AE SAE ( adverse event ) . In intradermal injection portion study , biocellular material inject 3-5 mm depth within mid-reticular dermis upper subcutaneous fat layer scalp . Placement biocellular cell-enriched biocelluar intend examine change associate change miniaturize hair follicle . It hypothesize delivery milieu stroma stem/stromal cell facilitate regenerative change treatment site . In addition provide native bioactive tissue scaffolding , great number stromal/stem cell tissue surround follicular niche result positive effect . Use small needle delivery make possible incorporating novel use emulsification adipose tissue complex ( lipoaspirates ) This emulsified AD-tSVF HD PRP methodology reduces surgeon injection pressure requirement result use small gauge needle . When clinically compare use much large needle require inject non-emulsified AD-tSVF , improvement current technique . A `` retrograde '' fill technique create potential space subsequently inject space biocellular material needle withdrawn advance study . Successful stem/stromal cell-enrichment AD-tSVF HD PRP biocellular mixture report numerous peer-reviewed publish clinical experience injection structural tissue augmentation plastic surgery , chronic wound therapy , ultrasound guide musculoskeletal treatment orthopedic &amp; sport medicine . Standard venipuncture obtain circulate whole blood concentrate platelet component create low hematocrit HD-PRP use FDA approve E USA ) Emcyte II follow manufacturer 's guideline . Small volume close syringe microcannula lipoaspiration use acquire AD-tSVF tissue ( Tulip Medical GEMS , San Diego , CA , , follow emulsification via Healeon ACM System ( Newbury Beach , CA , USA . Cellular test sample Arm 2-4 perform flow cytometry ( ORFLO , MoxiFlow , Ketchum , ID , USA ) viability cell concentration . A detailed patient medical history , study inform consent , screen evaluation determine eligibility candidacy study comply inclusion/exclusion criterion . Recording platelet pre-operative measure baseline achieve HD PRP concentrate , flow cytometric examination cell viability , cell count AD-cSVF complete patient . Biocellular injection treatment give two ( 2 ) separate procedure three ( 3 ) month apart . Follow clinical examination perform 6 month 1 year period completion outcome analyse include independent observer , clinician , subject satisfaction . The volume therapueutic mix standardize volume trial ARMs . Immediate reporting study group AR SAR document record safety record directly Ken Williams , DO , Co-Principal Investigator . This Clinical Trial sample size 60 patient six ( 6 ) center utilize protocol .</detailed_description>
