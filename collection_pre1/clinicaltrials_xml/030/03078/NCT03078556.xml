	<brief_summary>This study aim compare bioequivalence two experimental fix dose combination ( FDC ) tablets versus single entity product dolutegravir ( DTG ) lamivudine ( 3TC ) healthy adult subject . The study carry two part . Part 1 study open label , 3 period design wash period least 7 day treatment period . Subjects randomize receive either single entity formulation 1 FDC DTG 3TC crossover manner first 2 period . The first 16 subject complete first two treatment period consent continue receive single dose FDC formulation 1 tablet administer high fat meal third treatment period . In Part 2 study , subject randomize receive either single entity formulation 2 FDC DTG 3TC crossover manner first 2 period . Similarly first 16 subject receive FDC formulation 2 tablet high fat meal treatment period 3 . Subjects follow-up visit within 7-14 day last dose study drug . Approximately 76 healthy subject include Part 1 study Part 2 study conduct , another 76 healthy subject include . The total duration approximately 11 week .</brief_summary>
