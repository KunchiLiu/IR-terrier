	<brief_summary>Will motor skill- and/or strength training affect technique , work economy time performance cross-country poling ? Competitive cross-country skier ( age 16- 30 ) perform 10 week train intervention . They randomize one follow three group : pole specific motor skill train 3 time per week addition regular training , maximal strength training 3 time per week addition regular training control group perform regular training . Pre- post intervention , participant perform test VO2max ( run ) , VO2max ( pole ) , work economy ( pole ) , video inertial measurement unit ( IMU ) analyze pole technique , time performance test ( pole ) , motor skill test maximal strength test .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Motor Skill- Maximal Strength Training ; Importance Technique , Work Economy Time Performance Cross Country Poling Purpose The relative use pole classic cross-country skiing increase last year . ( Danielsen et al 2015 ) . As result pole performance become increasingly important classic cross-country skiing performance . Poling performance best possible technical skill , imply high velocity least possible energy cost ( C ) thus beneficial . Previous research ( Østerås et al 2002 ) show improved work economy pole maximal strength training ( MST ) . To investigator knowledge , effect motor skill training ( MOT ) C previously investigate . In study MOT MST therefore investigate ( two different group cross-country skier ) , may affect pole technique , C , lactate threshold ( LT ) pole performance . The result study may give insight knowledge scientific base training practice . The purpose study thus investigate : 1 . MOT result technical change pole ? 2 . MST result technical change pole ? 3 . MOT improve C pole ? 4 . MST improve C pole ? 5. change 1-4 improves time performance pole ? In order investigate , competitive cross-country skier ( age 16- 30 ) perform 10 week train intervention . They randomize one follow three group : pole specific motor skill training ( 10-12 x 3 repetition maximum , RM ) specific design cross country exercise 3 time per week addition regular training . Further , maximal strength training squat , dead lift , bench press , bench pull pull ( 2-5 x 3 repetition RM ) 3 time per week addition regular training control group perform regular training . Pre- post intervention , participant perform test VO2max ( run ) , VO2max ( pole ) , work economy ( pole ) , video IMU analyze pole technique , time performance test ( pole ) , motor skill test maximal strength test .</detailed_description>
