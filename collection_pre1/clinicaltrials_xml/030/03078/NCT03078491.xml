	<brief_summary>This study ass effectiveness CGM ( Continuous Glucose Monitor ) , enhance diabetes management platform ( DMP ) , collectively call enhance CGM ( eCGM ) , care old patient T1D . The DMP include automate data transfer CGM , insulin-delivery device , activity tracker clinical decision support system ( CDS ) provide dosing adjustment recommendation base data healthcare team . In addition , DMP include on-demand education patient caregiver , interface communication provider , patient , caregiver .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Hypoglycemia major often devastate complication T1D elderly . CGM show reduce risk hypoglycemia adult T1D include functional patient 65 year old . However , Medicare population heterogeneous may age-related clinical functional impairment impact self-care . These patient require additional targeted guidance support fully realize potential benefit CGM . To address age-specific barrier could limit effective use CGM , plan RCT ( Specific Aim 1 ) use CGM couple DMP ( Diabetes Management Platform ) , tablet-based technology platform ( term enhance CGM ( eCGM ) ) . The CGM , insulin delivery , activity data upload DMP analyze clinical decision support system ( CDS ) , provide insulin dose recommendation study physician , accept reject change therapy . The use DMP expect help less technologically proficient Medicare patient derive benefit CGM . Specific Aim 2 involve extensive mixed method research ( include semi-structured interview patient caregiver ) direct make in-depth assessment barrier use diabetes technology old adult . This investigation provide evidence-base future improvement technology clinical approach training old adult caregiver . Specific Aim 3 involve cost-effectiveness analysis technology system ( CGM DMP = enhance CGM [ eCGM ] ) use trial well quality life measure , provide foundation decision-making coverage .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Patients age ≥ 65 year Communityliving Clinical diagnosis T1D On multiple insulin injection ( ≥3 injection/s day ) insulin pump . Use realtime CGM past 2 year A1c &gt; 10 % ( since individual poor glycemic control usually barrier optimal selfcare preclude effective use technology ) Use insulin pump uploaded CDS Unable unwilling perform task need study participation runin period Severe vision hearing impairment could interfere study task Need use acetaminophen regular basis ( since interfere CGM accuracy ) Living institutional setting ( e.g . group home , nurse home ) Terminal diseases life expectancy &lt; 1 year ( e.g . malignancy ) Severe comorbidities prevent complete outcome measurement ( e.g . severe dementia , severe vision impairment , severe functional disability , inability perform basic activity daily live ) Alcohol drug abuse Conditions impact wear CGM ( e.g . CHF edema , skin condition ) ; End stage renal insufficiency ( eGFR &lt; 30 ) , dialysis ( since impact fluid shift sensor lag clearly understood ) .</criteria>
