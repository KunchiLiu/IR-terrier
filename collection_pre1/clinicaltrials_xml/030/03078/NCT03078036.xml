	<brief_summary>BREAKOUT -International Breast Cancer Biomarker , Standard Care Real World Outcomes Study BREAKOUT prospective cross-sectional cohort study human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 negative metastatic breast cancer patient start 1st line systemic cytotoxic chemotherapy . The study estimate prevalence germline breast cancer susceptibility gene otherwise unselected population , describe treatment administer estimate associate clinical outcome overall survival progression-free survival amongst mutation carrier within context low poly ADP ribose polymerase inhibitor treatment setting . Other exploratory analysis may undertake describe somatic breast cancer susceptibility gene homologous recombination repair gene mutation .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>International Breast Cancer Biomarker , Standard Care Real World Outcomes Study</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Background/Rationale : Within set metastatic human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 negative ( HER2-ve ) breast cancer limit epidemiological data exist prevalence pathogenic mutation breast cancer susceptibility gene ( BRCA ) homologous recombination repair ( HRR ) gene . There also limit data treatment clinical outcome patient germline somatic genetic profile , particularly within set . This epidemiologic study estimate prevalence germline breast susceptibility gene ( gBRCA ) mutation among metastatic HER2-ve patient commence 1st line systemic cytotoxic chemotherapy , time , consider exhaust hormone therapy option ( hormone receptor positive [ HR+ve ] ) , per investigator 's opinion . Among patient gBRCA gene mutation , treatment pattern clinical outcome describe . This study may also explore prevalence somatic BRCA ( sBRCA ) mutation HRR gene mutation among metastatic HER2-ve patient commence 1st line systemic cytotoxic chemotherapy . The treatment pattern clinical outcome may describe among patient sBRCA gene mutation HRR gene mutation .</detailed_description>
