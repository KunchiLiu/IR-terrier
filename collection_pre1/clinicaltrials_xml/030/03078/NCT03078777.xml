	<brief_summary>We recently complete publish study demonstrate fexofenadine pharmacokinetics significantly alter dialysis patient ( Thomson et al . ( 2015 ) American Journal Kidney Diseases 65 ( 4 ) :574-582 ) . In study , patient study directly undergo routine dialysis treatment . Other publish literature suggest time dose drug ( dialysis ) may profound impact drug pharmacokinetics ( Nolin et al ( 2006 ) 17 ( 9 ) :2363-7 ) . The hypothesis compound accumulate blood patient kidney failure impact pharmacokinetics dose dialysis produce significantly different blood level drug .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>The Effect Dialysis Pharmacokinetics Fexofenadine</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This open , randomize pharmacokinetic study 30 patient treated dialysis . Patients ask spend additional 3 hour hospital two study day separate least week . At first study visit , patient randomize receive drug fexofenadine ( 120 mg , orally ) either 3 hour prior , OR conclusion regularly schedule dialysis treatment . Three hour follow fexofenadine administration , single 4 mL ( approximately 1 teaspoon ) blood sample drawn . One week first study day , patient study repeat time dose alter match randomization . For example , first study visit patient receive fexofenadine dialysis session , receive drug 3 hour prior dialysis session . The blood sample centrifuge immediately plasma store -80 celsius analysis . Fexofenadine concentration determine liquid chromatography couple mass spectrometry .</detailed_description>
