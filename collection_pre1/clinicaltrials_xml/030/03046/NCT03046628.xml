	<brief_title>Evaluation Lower Extremity Tissue Perfusion With Polarized Laser Light</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>An objective assessment blood supply oxygen delivery damage tissue patient diabetic ulcer problematic various currently accept auxiliary examination . These test include measure blood pressure ratio ankle toe arm ( ABI \ TBI ) , Sonar Doppler examination lower limb artery , percutaneous tissue oxygen tension examination ( TcPO2 ) . Each test , along obvious advantage esprit ability assess non-invasive blood number disadvantage . As blood supply tissue important healing tissue regardless type intervention choose ( conservative treatment include systemic antibiotic surgical debridement ) , clear necessity non-invasive test high reliably assess tissue perfusion patient diabetic ulcer . Recently , new method assess multiple feature vital tissue use polarise laser light introduce . The technique base track temporal change reflect secondary speckle produce skin illuminate laser beam . Change skin 's temporal vibration profile generated time varied oxygen concentration cause temporal change . This technology nanometer motion sensing allows , accord study already carry , monitor parameter blood pressure , pulse rate heart rhythm , glucose concentration blood substance alcohol , oxygen saturation intraocular pressure . In study investigator examine , non-invasively , tissue around low limb ulcer 30 diabetic patient , begin TcPO2 examination follow polarised laser light complementary metal-oxide semiconductor ( CMOS ) camera examination , analyse data order determine ability latter method assess tissue oxygen pressure .</detailed_description>
