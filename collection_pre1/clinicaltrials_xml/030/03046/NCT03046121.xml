	<brief_summary>This study address effectiveness Family-centered Function Focused Care ( Fam-FFC ) . Fam-FFC theoretically-based approach care family caregiver partner nurse prevent functional decline complication related hospitalization older adult Alzheimer 's disease relate dementia . A systematic care pathway promote information-sharing decision-making promotes physical activity , function , cognitive stimulation hospitalization immediate post-acute period . Our goal work establish practical effective way optimize function physical activity ; decrease neuropsychiatric symptom , delirium , depression ; prevent avoidable post-acute care dependency ; prevent unnecessary rehospitalizations long-stay nursing home admission , mitigate family caregiver strain burden .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Family-centered Intervention Acutely-ill Persons With Dementia</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Older person Alzheimer 's disease relate dementia ( ADRD ) two time likely hospitalized peer cognitively healthy . The care hospitalize person ADRD traditionally focus acute medical problem lead admission little attention pay functional recovery . Older person ADRD great risk functional decline increase care dependency discharge due combination intrinsic factor , environmental , policy , care practice restrict physical cognitive activity , limited staff knowledge dementia care . Family caregiver ( CGs ) play important role promote functional recovery hospitalize old adult . They provide vital information , offer motivation support function-focused care , assume responsibility vary degree post-acute care delivery coordination . Family-centered FFC ( Fam-FFC ) incorporate educational empowerment model family CGs provide within social-ecological in-patient framework promote specialize care patient ADRD . The intervention create `` enable '' milieu person ADRD environmental policy assessment/modification , staff education , unit-based champion , individualized goal set focus functional recovery . In patient/family-centered care approach , nurse purposefully engage family CGs assessment , decision-making , care delivery evaluation function-focused care hospitalization 60-day post-acute period . In proposed project , implement Fam-FFC cluster randomize trial 438 patient/CG dyad six hospital unit randomize within three hospital ( 73 dyad per unit ) accomplish follow aim : Aim 1 : Validate efficacy Fam-FFC physical function ( ADLs/ performance physical activity ) , delirium occurrence severity , neuropsychiatric symptom , mood ; Aim 2 : Evaluate impact Fam-FFC family CG-centered outcome ( preparedness caregiving , strain , burden , desire institutionalize ) ; Aim 3 : Evaluate relative cost Fam-FFC v. control condition , calculate health care cost ( post-acute health care utilization ) total cost saving Fam-FFC . We also evaluate cultural appropriateness Fam-FCC diverse family sample . Dyads compose community-residing , hospitalize medical patient mild moderate dementia ( 0.5 2.0 Clinical Dementia Rating Scale ) CG ( define primary person provide oversight support ongoing basis ) . Outcomes evaluated hospital admission , discharge , two six month post-discharge . This study critical next step delineate partner family CGs change acute care approach provide patient ADRD optimize function discharge , promote delirium abatement well-being individual . The societal implication help old individual Alzheimer 's disease relate dementias avoid functional decline enormous term age place , quality life , cost , caregiver burden . The study finding relevant area behavior change research acute care , specifically related engage patient family health care planning , delivery , evaluation .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Patient medical patient : age ≥65 , speak English Spanish , live community prior admission hospital , screen positive dementia wellvalidated scale ( Montreal Cognitive Assessment { MoCA } ≤ 25 123127 AD8 &gt; 2 128,129 ) , score 0.5 2.0 Clinical Dementia Rating Scale ; family CG designate study partner duration study . Patient mild cognitive impairment ( CDR 0.5 without functional ADL impairment ) , severe dementia ( CDR 3 ) , significant neurological condition associate cognitive impairment dementia ( e.g . brain tumor ) , major acute psychiatric disorder , family caregiver participate , enrol hospice and/or life expectancy six month less , admit nursing home , experience transfer another unit stay longer 48 hour . Family age 18 whose relative meet inclusion criterion eligible speak read English Spanish ; relate patient blood , marriage , adoption , affinity significant ( define patient/legally authorized person primary person provide oversight support ongoing basis ) ; participate , minimum , initial assessment development FamPath ; able recall least two word MiniCog Staff nurse ( conclusion intervention site ) identify intervention unit primary unit work , speak English Spanish , include focus group For exploratory aim assess cultural appropriateness intervention , recruit family caregiver selfidentify black , Latino , Asian white , randomly select FamFFC sample . Approximately 10 percent family ethnic group represent study approach consent participation interview . ( If theoretical saturation reach , interview continue saturation reach ) . Additionally , six nurse champion consent interviewed study end his/her particular unit/setting provide perspective cultural appropriateness FamFFC .</criteria>
