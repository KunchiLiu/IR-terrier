	<brief_summary>This study multi-center , prospective cohort study plan enroll 6000 patient diagnose primary gastric cancer 12,000 healthy normal cohort participant 5 year . All participant enrol registry , participant question gastric cancer survey serum tissue participant analyze . The main aim study 1 . To evaluate optimal interval endoscopic screen early detection gastric cancer risk factor Korean . 2 . To evaluate diagnostic validity serum biomarker ( combine pepsinogen , H pylorus IgG Antibody , TFF3 ) screen test detection GC Korean .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Gastric cancer ( GC ) fourth common type cancer ( 934 000 new case , 8.6 % new cancer case 2002 ) , second common cause cancer death ( 700 000 death annually ) world . Several Asian country , include China , Japan , Korea , high incidence GC world . Because prognosis early GC highly favorable , high- prevalence country , Japan Korea , seek reduce disease burden provide GC screen aver- age-risk population . In Korea , national GC screening instituted 1999 part National Cancer Screening Program ( NCSP ) . The NCSP recommend biennial GC screening male females old 40 year age , use direct indirect upper gastrointestinal series ( UGIS ) endoscopy . Upper gastrointestinal endoscopy generally accept gold standard diagnosis clinicopathological evaluation GC . Endoscopic examination predominantly use screen symptomatic individual , distinguish patient GC comparatively benign disease , peptic ulcer . However , consensus optimal timing screen endoscopy detect early GC . Thus , investigator plan evaluate optimal endoscopic interval find early gastric cancer use survey newly diagnose GC cohort group healthy control cohort group . In addition , investigator go analyze risk factor GC Korean ( epidemiologic , diet , clinical factor ) . In study , investigator go enroll participant diagnose GC normal control group people , October 2016 October 2021 multi-center , prospectively . The baseline characteristic participant , H. pylorus status , stage gastric cancer diagnosis , treatment modality , treatment response mortality analyze . Although diagnosis gastric cancer characterize endoscopy , strong demand serologic marker accessibility , invasiveness , discomfort endoscopy . In recent year , advancement molecular biomarkers utilized cancer detection development therapeutic agent base target gene type solid tumour exclude GC . With advancement molecular biological technique last decade , researcher gain important insight oncogenesis mechanism GC . Besides well-known pathogenic factor , Helicobacter pylorus , various experimental approach identify oncogene tumour suppressor gene , include cell cycle regulation gene growth signal transduction pathway . Recently , several study report efficacy serum biomarker ( serum PG , H. pylorus Ig G Antibody TFF3 , etc ) diagnosis GC . In present study , investigator go efficacy serum biomarker use serum GC patient health control group .</detailed_description>
