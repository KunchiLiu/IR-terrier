	<brief_summary>Patients End Stage Kidney Disease ( ESKD ) require Renal Replacement Therapy ( RRT ) order survive , dialysis kidney transplantation ( KT ) . Of two modality , KT associate good quality life ( QOL ) [ 1-3 ] , reduce morbidity mortality [ 4 , 5 ] , reduce healthcare cost [ 6 ] . Studies US show patient receive tailored transplant education likely complete transplant evaluation [ 9 , 14 , 15 ] . For instance , patient receive Explore Transplant ( ET ) education program design Dr. Waterman , knowledgeable KT likely complete KT evaluation control patient . Currently , lack standardized KT education Ontario . Traditional approach insufficient provide necessary education information enable patient make informed decision care . To address issue , study assess impact kidney transplant relate education use Explore Transplant Ontario ( ETO ) education program kidney transplant-related knowledge readiness consider KT , readiness consider live donor KT , wait list/referral rate patient undergoing maintenance hemodialysis . In order comprehensively measure impact , 5 variable explore . 1 . Readiness consider DDKT 2 . Readiness consider LDKT 3 . KT related knowledge patient 4 . Proportion patient waitlisted undergoing KT workup 6 12 month administration ETO 5 . Proportion patient identify least one potential living donor 6 12 month administration ETO The hypothesis follow : 1 . Readiness consider DDKT high `` intervention '' group compare `` control '' group follow . 2 . Readiness consider LDKT high `` intervention '' group compare `` control '' group follow . 3 . The KT related knowledge patient higher `` intervention '' group compare `` control '' group follow . 4 . The proportion patient waitlisted undergoing KT workup 6 12 month KT education high `` intervention '' group compare `` control '' group . 5 . The proportion patient least one potential living donor 6 12 month KT education high `` intervention '' group compare `` control '' group .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Implementing `` Explore Transplant '' - A Pilot Study</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>ESKD impair quality life ( QOL ) QoL lead increase morbidity premature mortality . In addition , healthcare cost ESKD amount $ 1.3 billion Canada 2000 [ 22 ] . KT clear survival [ 4 ] QOL [ 1-3 ] , economic benefit [ 6 ] . Studies US document tailored education improve KT knowledge enhances access KT LDKT [ 14 , 23-26 ] . Current education material teach KT candidate Ontario base theoretical foundation research evidence . This result gap transplant education Ontario unable meet need patient . By build upon research data US aim implement culturally sensitive patient education tool address current need well reduce barrier whereby enhance access KT . This project increase KT knowledge among health care professional among patient . We establish ongoing support participate nephrology center . This also increase KT knowledge patient family enhance access KT . The ultimate goal improve health outcome QOL reduce barrier KT LDKT help patient family make informed treatment decision . The Explore Transplant Ontario ( ETO ) parallel , non-randomized , control pilot study explore impact educational intervention design increase knowledge kidney transplantation ( KT ) readiness consider KT . For pilot study utilize convenience sample stable patient hemodialysis two large dialysis unit . The `` intervention '' administer hemodialysis unit Humber River Hospital ; `` control '' group recruit hemodialysis unit Toronto General Hospital . Currently around 500 patient treated maintenance hemodialysis dialysis unit , estimate 300 patient fulfill inclusion criterion . The estimated study period 21 month . Baseline study recruitment occur period 3 month participate dialysis center . Data management , follow-up , analysis take place subsequent 18 months.The study recruitment period 60 business day , recruitment rate estimate 5-6 patient per day screening . The entire study take place 4 distinct stage Stage 1 : Baseline data collection conduct dialysis center Stage 2 : A full day train organize train select group dialysis nurse . This group act group clinical expert help facilitate training use ETO amongst health care practitioner . Stage 3 : Following training session , ETO implement hemodialysis unit Humber River Hospital `` intervention '' arm Toronto General Hospital `` control '' arm . It estimate 300 hemodialysis patient fulfill inclusion criterion , result enrollment 150 patient study arm . Stage 4 : The study duration take approximately 21 month accomplish . Baseline recruitment occur period 3 month participate dialysis center , estimate 5-6 patient per day screening . Data management , follow-up , analysis take place subsequent 18 month . Statistical Analysis Plan : Categorical variable ( `` early versus `` late '' stage readiness , high versus low knowledge ) compare use logistic regression model ( knowledge readiness stage dependent variable ; exposure ETO education primary explanatory variable ) . Continuous knowledge score also analyze linear regression model ( score dependent variable , exposure ET primary explanatory variable ) . These analysis adjust age , gender , education , ethnicity/race comorbidity . Chi-square test use compare proportion patient KT wait list KT evaluation control versus intervention group , baseline 3 month follow . Baseline data proportion patient KT wait list KT evaluation participate dialysis center collect participate dialysis unit .</detailed_description>
