	<brief_title>Transport PLUS Intervention</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The moment transition hospital home susceptible lapse quality loss key information regard patient 's care . An increase amount attention give improve transition care target factor contribute return Emergency Department ( ED ) visit readmission . Following hospitalization , many 40 % patient age 60 experience fall subsequent six month 76 % old adult patient uncertain follow-up care plan . Patients transport home ambulance follow ED visit find significantly high rate return ED visit 30 day overall rate older adult ED patient ( 27.8 % vs. 11.5 % ) . In response challenge , researcher 's study group develop pilot innovative care model know `` Transport PLUS '' specially trained emergency medical technician ( EMTs ) already transport old adult ( 65+ year age ) patient home ED add service two simple intervention - home fall hazard assessment ( FHA ) discharge comprehension assessment ( DCA ) . Both intervention facilitate measure use checklist develop systematic review literature exist tool , later refine EMT patient focus group . This study test hypothesis 'Transport PLUS , ' low cost , easily generalizable intervention , improve transition care improve patient safety follow hospitalization measure decreased rate fall reduced rate return hospital . The researcher conduct pilot cluster randomize control trial compare Transport PLUS intervention standard care population old adult patient discharge hospital . The researcher randomize EMS provider either perform Transport PLUS ( intervention ) provide routine transport . It estimate approximately 400 patient age 65 transport home study hospital participate provider study enrollment period . Patient participant receive Transport PLUS ( n=200 ) routine care ( n=200 ) determine transport provider . Primary outcome rate fall 3 month follow hospitalization 3-day 30-day return ED visit ( without hospitalization ) . Process measure include removal fall hazard 3 month compliance discharge instruction . Extending beyond grant period , researcher intend follow cohort 1 year .</detailed_description>
