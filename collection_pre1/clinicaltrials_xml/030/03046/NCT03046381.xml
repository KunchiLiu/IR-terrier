	<brief_summary>Schnitzler 's Syndrome ( SchS ) late-onset multifactorial autoinflammatory disease characterize chronic urticarial skin lesion monoclonal gammopathy usually belong immunoglobulin M ( IgM ) IgG class . Symptoms associate SchS recurrent fever attack , bone muscle pain , arthralgia arthritis , fatigue lymphadenopathy . SchS rare disease approximately 300 case report literature . The nature SchS chronic without know report spontaneous remission . Disease onset occurs around age 50 . About 15 % patient eventually develop lymphoproliferative disorder , often Waldenström 's macroglobulinemia . The pathogenesis SchS still well define . Functional ex vivo study show excessive cytokine production ( IL-1ß , IL-6 IL-18 ) peripheral blood monocyte ( PBMCs ) SchS compare healthy control . In addition excessive IL-6 secretion PBMCs IL-6 repeatedly report elevated serum SchS patient . As IL-6 play major role development multiple myeloma , IL-6 may also associate formation lymphoproliferative disorder SchS . Until , approve standard therapy available treatment SchS . Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug ( NSAIDs ) , corticosteroid , immunosuppressive agent report provide variable relief symptom bone pain arthralgia . Case report small study successful treatment SchS anti-IL-1 blocker ( anakinra , rilonacept canakinumab ) accumulate . However , complete partial treatment failure anti-IL-1 blockade SchS . In patient , anti-IL-6 treatment ( tocilizumab [ TCZ ] ) demonstrate effective reduce clinical symptom inflammation marker SchS . TCZ treatment prove effective , well-tolerated safe acquire autoinflammatory disorder , systemic juvenile idiopathic arthritis ( sJIA ) adult-onset Still 's disease share many clinical feature ( rash , fever , joint involvement , lymphadenopathy , fatigue ) excessive cytokine production SchS . The study consist run-in baseline period 1-4 week follow open-label 20-week TCZ treatment phase weekly s.c. injection ( TCZ 162mg ) , follow optional study extension total 1 year ongoing weekly TCZ 162mg injection 4 week period follow-up .</brief_summary>

Pregnancies occur 90 day completion study medication must report investigator . A woman consider childbearing potential postmenopausal great two year surgically sterile ( bilateral tubal ligation , bilateral oophorectomy hysterectomy ) Subjects consider eligible , meet following tuberculosis ( TB ) screen criterion : history latent active TB prior screen , sign symptom suggestive active TB , recent close contact person active TB , negative QuantiFERONTB test screening ( QuantiFERONTB test positive , patient include active TB rule appropriate measurement accord standard care , e.g . patient pretreated isoniazide 4 week ) . No participation clinical trial 4 week participation study Exclusion criterion : Major surgery ( include joint surgery ) within 8 week prior screen plan major surgery within 6 month follow randomization . Concurrent/ongoing treatment biologics recent treatment ( less 5 half life ) With Anakinra within 7 day prior screen , canakinumab within 100 day prior screen oral/parental corticosteriods great 10 mg/d within 2 week prior screen Cyclosporin A Methotrexate , Dapsone , Chloroquine , Hydroxychloroquine , Azathioprine , Cyclophosphamide within 4 week prior screen immunosuppressive within 4 week 5 half life prior screen , whichever longer Previous treatment within six month randomization celldepleting therapy , include investigational agent approve therapy , example include : CAMPATH , antiCD4 , antiCD5 , antiCD3 , antiCD19 antiCD20 . Treatment intravenous gamma globulin , plasmapheresis Prosorba column within 6 month baseline . Treatment live ( attenuate ) virus vaccine within 4 week prior Baseline visit Significant medical condition render patient immunocompromised suitable clinical trial Any previous treatment alkylating agent chlorambucil , total lymphoid irradiation . History severe allergic anaphylactic reaction human , humanized murine monoclonal antibody . An abnormal chest radiograph consistent clinical sign prior present tuberculosis infection whether previously treat antituberculosis agent Significant concomitant illness , limited , cardiac , renal , neurological , endocrinological , metabolic , lymphatic disease would adversely affect subject 's participation evaluation study Evidence current HIV , Hepatitis B , Hepatitis C infection clinical serological history Presence follow laboratory abnormality enrollment visit : serum creatinine &gt; 1.6 mg/dL ( 141 µmol/L ) female patient &gt; 1.9 mg/dL ( 168 µmol/L ) male patient , WBC &lt; 3,000/µl ; platelet count &lt; 100000/µl ; ALT AST &gt; 2 x ULN total bilirubin &gt; ULN , Hemoglobin &lt; 8.0 g/dL , neutrophil count &lt; 2,000 cells/µl lymphocyte count &lt; 500/ µl Evidence active , recurrent latent systemic infection Active systemic inflammatory condition SchS include , limited , rheumatoid arthritis History malignancy within five year prior screen successfully treat nonmetastatic cutaneous , basal , squamous cell carcinoma and/or situ cervical cancer Lactating female pregnant female Enrollment another investigational treatment device study use investigational agent , less 4 week 5 halflives , whichever longer , since end another investigational device drug trial Subjects concern compliance protocol procedures Any medical condition , opinion Investigator , would interfere participation study place subject risk History substance abuse ( drug alcohol ) factor ( e.g. , serious psychiatric condition ) could limit subject 's ability comply study procedure .
