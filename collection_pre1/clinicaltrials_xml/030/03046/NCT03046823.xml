	<detailed_description>Background Objectives : Obesity common [ affect 33 % general adult population US ] metabolic disorder increase prevalence Singapore ( 10 % general adult population ) . As obesity associate cardiovascular disease ( i.e. , diffuse coronary artery disease , DCAD ) lead heart remodel heart failure , timely accurate diagnosis diffuse coronary artery disease related cardiac remodel obesity clinically urgently need study aim : 1 . Characterize coronary artery disease ( CAD ) use CTA scale power law 100 patient obesity 2 . Characterize cardiac remodel use curvedness-based MRI 100 patient obesity 3 . Compare differences cardiac vascular remodel patient metabolic syndrome without Methodologies : 100 patient obesity recruit study . All recruit patient undergo fast blood test diagnose metabolic syndrome . After , undergo CTA MRI within 1-2 week in-between . Patients ' CTA image segment transformed build 3D coronary artery model . The application novel scale power law model use diagnose diffuse CAD . Based patient MRI image , cardiac remodel assessed novel curvedness-based imaging analysis method . The difference cardiac vascular remodel patient metabolic syndrome without compare analyzed . In addition , subject shall undergo ultrasound examination heart ( echocardiogram ) , carotids forearm artery . Doppler tissue-Doppler echocardiography constitutes gold standard cardiac diastolic function assessment . The finding shall correlate diastolic cine MRI finding . Carotid forearm artery ultrasound allow investigation vessel distensibility , carotid intimal thickness , pulse wave velocity , central arterial blood pressure estimation well endothelial function ( via flow-mediated dilation ) . Perturbations parameter may correlate functional abnormality cardiac MRI coronary disease CT . Subjects shall undergo fast blood test metabolic profile . The test include blood level creatinine , electrolyte , insulin , glycated haemoglobin , fast lipid , fast sugar postprandial sugar ( 75 g standard oral glucose load ) . Additionally blood sample shall store potential future study . Clinical Significance : If success , study obesity advance understand obesity-related CAD cardiac vessel remodeling , translate improve diagnosis treatment obese patient . Clinical Significance : If success , study obesity advance understand obesity-related CAD cardiac remodeling , translate improve diagnosis treatment obese patient .</detailed_description>
