Patients identify risk COPD insufficiently use spirometry general practitioner ( GPs ) underestimate severity COPD practice spirometry patient . COPD often diagnose late , disease discover stage complication require hospitalization .

The international ( GOLD 2014 ) French ( HAS 2014 ) recommendation indicate systematic screen general population COPD advocate target screen patient five question identify risk factor symptoms COPD . The presence least one factor adult age 40 require spirometry . Recent study suggest relevance find primary care variable smoke respiratory symptom order identify new case COPD . However , impact use questionnaires prevalence diagnosis COPD general practice demonstrate . Moreover , heterogeneity provision care accord territory limit fast easy access ( distance ) spirometry . It therefore necessary evaluate primary care interest target screen COPD interest coordination care realization spirometry , order improve rate diagnosis disease .</brief_summary>
