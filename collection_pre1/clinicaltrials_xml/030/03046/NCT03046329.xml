	<detailed_description>Treatment multiple myeloma ( MM ) currently undergo rapid transformation . With many new agent regimens choose , significant practice gap emerge treatment management newly diagnose MM patient . Innovative strategy need ( 1 ) enhance personalize treatment MM ( 2 ) proactively identify , ass , manage disease- treatment-related symptom new therapy optimally translate practice . This study explore symptom assessment management practice provider care individual receive active therapy multiple myeloma , also employ two-part intervention ( patient provider ) evaluate impact novel exist technology , Carevive Care Planning System ( CPS ) , supportive care symptom management multiple myeloma patient . The primary objective study evaluate provider adherence evidence-based practice symptom assessment management ( i.e. , `` symptom care behavior '' ) physicians nurse ( provider ) care individual receive active treatment multiple myeloma ( MM ) . Carevive . The Carevive intervention include personalize supportive care symptom management plan patient auto-generated Carevive CPS base individual 's data . The Care plan create base nationally recognize National Comprehensive Cancer Network ( NCCN ) supportive care guideline validate Multiple Myeloma ( MM ) nurse physician expert . Investigators use study-specific scorecard evidence-based symptom assessment management metric evaluate adherence provider ( n=8-20 ) symptom assessment management behavior , measure individual patient ( n=120 ) level , evidence-based practice symptom care . Changes adherence evidence-based practice explore use across subject comparison retrospective data abstract matched sample historical control . Use care plan technology provide tailor education individualize information may provide easy , accessible effective way improve supportive care symptom management individual receive active treatment multiple myeloma . Multiple myeloma ( MM ) neoplastic plasma-cell disorder characterize clonal proliferation malignant plasma cell bone marrow microenvironment , monoclonal protein blood urine , associate organ dysfunction . In 2014 , approximately 24,050 new case MM diagnose 11,090 death expect occur . The treatment MM currently undergo rapid evolution . The FDA approve several new agent past several year . Dozens regimens available , best practice consensus guideline continually evolve new data publish . Indeed , major update International Myeloma Working Group ( IMWG ) 2014 National Comprehensive Cancer Network ( NCCN ) guideline highlight recent revolution MM care . With many agent regimen choose , crucial ever provider understand individualize treatment symptom management base patient- disease-related factor . However , significant practice gap exist among provider treat patient newly diagnose MM . Transplant eligibility , cytogenetics , comorbidities , renal function , factor often adequately consider design personalized induction , consolidation , maintenance treatment plan . In addition , institutional MM pathway often include symptom management . Adverse event common patient MM , dose limiting , force patient change therapy jeopardize treatment outcome . A subject design use matched historical control institution use evaluate adherence provider ( n=8-20 ) symptom assessment management behavior , measure individual multiple myeloma ( MM ) patient ( n=120 ) level , evidence-based practice symptom care , explore correlate adherence evidence-based symptom care behavior . Retrospective review enrol patient participant chart conduct evaluate achievement adherence evidence-based practice individual patient level , follow engagement two part study intervention , plus novel individualize care plan technology ( Carevive CPS ) . Retrospective chart review complete de-identified , matched historical control ( match demographic , diagnosis treatment variable ) institution ( e.g Cleveland Clinic ) ass impact project intervention outcome metric . Data enter score card appendix B . The use match historical control comparative analysis address threat diffusion intervention ; i.e. , participation project impact provider 's clinical behavior care patient thus would potentially effect baseline data collection patient enrol later study . Providers care individual receive active treatment multiple myeloma ( MM ) . The Carevive CPS intervention focus use Carevive CPS point care enable provider deliver evidence-based personalize supportive care symptom management plan MM patient receive active treatment . The Carevive CPS collect electronic patient report outcome ( ePROs ) clinical data , report entered clinical staff and/or extract electronic medical record ( EMR ) , use auto-generate personalize care plan . Care plan content driven practice guideline peer-reviewed evidence , include patient education , resource , referral develop expert cancer clinicians researcher . Changes symptom assessment management behavior assess match scorecard evidence-based symptom assessment management metric . A scorecard metric develop interdisciplinary team inform similar approach use within Oncology Nursing Society 's ( ONS ) Quality Initiative . Recommendations symptom assessment management well evidence base recommendation operationalized metric . The intervention center use Carevive CPS point care , conjunction two consecutive clinical visit , baseline second , similar questionnaire complete clinic visit occur least 4 week later . Eligible patient potentially eligible visit identify via weekly chart review upcoming clinic schedule correspond individual patient medical record . In exam room , prior potential baseline study visit , patient approach inform study ( follow-up visit , patient approach reminded study ) . Once patient consent , research staff open electronic questionnaire via Carevive CPS application one study designate tablet computer secure Cleveland Clinic desktop device accord patient preference . Research staff either ) register patient use year birth unique Study ID number assign Cleveland Clinic b ) open patient ' already exist file ( follow-up ) . The research staff select open appropriate questionnaire ( baseline interim ) allow patient complete . The patient report symptom , history , current concern . Once patient complete questionnaire , survey window automatically close . Data store centrally manage third party ( PRS ) HIPAA compliant manner . The study research coordinator enter limit clinical data Diagnosis Treatment Summary section Carevive CPS click submit . Once submit , total composite ePRO research staff enter data run guideline-driven proprietary Carevive CPS algorithms auto-generate draft supportive care plan . The draft care plan contain , base individual patient data , personalize supportive care symptom management data review provider visit . The patient proceed intervention visit provider review , edit need , finalize deliver electronic care plan ( and/or print copy ) patient . The patient also provide copy care plan ( electronically via email , thumb drive and/or paper ) take home . Research staff track patient enrollment monitor return visit participant fall within follow-up visit window begin least 4 week later ( +/- 1 week ) continue second survey complete . At follow visit , study patient take second electronic survey Carevive CPS , receive second provider-approved care plan . Patients also offer opportunity complete brief questionnaire satisfaction , utilization , care plan since first intervention visit . The questionnaire ask specific recommendation make within care plan patient recall receive action , , take . Patients offer opportunity complete survey study provide tablet secure Cleveland Clinic desktop device time second visit link survey email completed leisure . This survey complete independently Carevive CPS on-line survey host site Surveymonkey.com optional patient . Study-specific data collection occur multiple time point . Chart review enrol patient participant period time baseline intervention ( baseline visit ) 12-weeks post second intervention ( encompass follow-up visit ) . Retrospective chart abstraction match control examine 12-week time period match close possible intervention time period respective enrolled patient . Retrospective chart review occur time . Chart review must reflect time period enrol patient . Patient satisfaction utilization questionnaire complete follow follow-up visit . Data source include patient questionnaire , previously collect data collect part study intervention store within Carevive CPS platform database ( enrolled patient ) limit diagnosis treatment data control ( match purpose ) , well chart review score card data . A brief worksheet collect care plan delivery variable ( e.g. , deliver care plan patient , much time spend review care plan , etc . ) also complete research staff follow clinic visit care plan deliver .</detailed_description>
