	<detailed_description>Incontinence incontinence associate dermatitis ( IAD ) common problem . A recent CDC study note 50 % noninstitutionalized patient age 65 old experience episode incontinence least monthly , 40 % incontinence develop secondary IAD The treatment IAD focus effective cleaning prevention exposure irritant liquid solid barrier cream . Enzymatic wash proven efficacy soap water , zinc oxide standard care barrier function . Combined , effective cleanse barrier use treat IAD little 6 day , effectively prevent recurrent skin damage . In one study , effective preventive regimen regularly apply skin therapy reduce incidence IAD risk population 25 % 5 % . The combination enzymatic skin cleanser barrier protection standard care maintenance skin integrity patient chronic urinary fecal incontinence . Adherence prescribe regimen major barrier regular use substance apply perineum . Difficulty access perineum make adherence challenge full limited mobility , often require assistance caregiver . The associated loss independence dignity major detriment quality life . Novel formulation zinc oxide , use aerosol base spray application , facilitate use improve patient acceptance . In 2014 nursing home base industry study , spray base zinc oxide prefer 80 % patient caregiver , improve treatment prevention IAD 70 % study participant . Adequate cleanse dry prior application barrier product key effective prevention skin breakdown . Water-based cleaning perineum toileting demonstrate improve hygiene standard mechanical , paper-based cleansing , especially limited mobility incontinence . Evidence demonstrate addition pH balance cleanser , apply without mechanical abrasion cloth wipe , advance hygiene minimizes risk secondary infection . Study Aims The aim study evaluate efficacy automate delivery system cleanse perineum , apply zinc oxide barrier spray effectively treat prevent incontinence associate dermatitis population active recurrent IAD .
