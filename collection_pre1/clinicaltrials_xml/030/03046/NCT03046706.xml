The scarred vocal cord lead decrease elasticity , reflect poor speech quality . Although theory , many work publish literature prove necessity voice rest vocal cord surgery . Several study recently publish claim need vocal rest stress importance moderate voice effort straight surgery . This need base idea early mobilization tissue surgery lead creation healthy soft tissue architecture . The investigator hypothesize role vocal rest surgery remove benign lesion vocal cord . Patients candidate laryngeal surgery include removal benign vocal cord lesion divide two group : 1 . Patients instructed conventional post operative voice rest , namely absolute voice rest week another week relative voice rest ( speak allow 20 minute day ) . 2 . Patients instructed speak freely without restriction surgery . study phase : * first visit- preoperative visit . - First investigator prove fiber optic examination patient suffers scourge benign vocal cord lesion .

Next patient fill VHI ( voice handicap index ) questionnaire - questionnaire assess impact patient voice 3 measure : emotional , functional psychosocial . The questionnaire contain 30 question . Any question dot 0-4 patient high score mean bad sound . - Optical fiber test perform . Vocal cord include lesion photograph video file save . Stroboscopic test determine quality vibration , movement closure vocal cords.The patient voice record future determination GRBAS ( Grade , Roughness , breathiness , asthenia , strain ) . index , score laryngologists assess patient 's voice accord five factors- grade , roughness , breathiness , asthenia , strain . Each parameter dot 0-3 high score mean bad sound.The last test objective . The voice record undergo computer analysis determine follow voice objective : fundamental frequency , jitter , shimmer , harmonic noise ratio . Lastly patient randomize ( block randomization ) determine group patient belongs . Patients belong control group ( standard post operative voice rest ) receive form annotate every day whether kept instruct sound regime . This log allow investigator track compliance patient belong voice rest group . - Second visit- 3 day post operative - Execute optical fiber examination description evaluation recovery process vocal cord . - Vocal cord include lesion photograph video file save . stroboscopic test future determination quality vibration , movement closure vocal cod . - Third visit- 14 day post operative Same examination second visit perform plus : - The patient voice record determine GRBAS Index laryngologist . record patient 's voice objective voice analysis evaluation use computer . - Forth visit- 1 month post operative .
