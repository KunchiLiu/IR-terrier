	<brief_summary>Allopurinol-induced severe cutaneous adverse reaction ( SCAR ) rare fatal condition . Previous report report HLA-B*5801 important genetic risk factor significantly associate development allopurinol-induced SCAR . However , prospective study prove clinical efficacy HLA-B*5801 screening administration allopurinol predict allopurinol-induced SCAR . The purpose prospective study test hypothesis pre-screening HLA-B*5801 significantly reduce risk allopurinol-induced SCAR development compare historical control .</brief_summary>
