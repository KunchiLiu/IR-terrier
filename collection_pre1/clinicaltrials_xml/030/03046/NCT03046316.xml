	<detailed_description>It require pathological diagnosis genetic profile include epidermal growth factor receptor ( EGFR ) , anaplastic lymphoma kinase ( ALK ) ROS proto-oncogene 1 ( ROS1 ) establish prior enrollment . Standard front line systemic give accord clinical practice . Molecular target drug patient drive mutation acquire legally . Patients without drive mutation undergo standard first line chemotherapy . One cycle three week response evaluation do every two cycle . CR , PR SD confirm four cycle therapy . Patients , achieve non-PD four cycle treatment , distant metastasis involve two organ three total metastatic lesion , screen randomize arm A B eligible . Arm A : Patient subject local consolidative treatment primary metastasis , include surgery , radiotherapy interventional therapy . It physicians ' choice standard maintenance surveillance LCT . Arm B : It physicians ' choice standard maintenance surveillance accord clinical practice .</detailed_description>
