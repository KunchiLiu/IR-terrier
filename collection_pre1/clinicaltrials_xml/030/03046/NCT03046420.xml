	<detailed_description>Isolated systolic hypertension common elderly young adult . Also blood pressure ( BP ) elderly tend high , difficult treat . Many study do understand mechanism hypertension old adult , conclude main mechanism chronic inflammation , oxidative stress endothelial dysfunction . Hypertension often call `` silent killer '' major high risk factor heart , chronic kidney cerebrovascular disease . Systolic BP ( SBP ) gradually increase early adulthood old age , whilst diastolic BP ( DBP ) increase around 50 year age reach plateau decreasing , cause widen pulse pressure , elevate blood pressure know Isolated Systolic Hypertension ( ISH ) . There general consensus across international guideline recommend target BP SBP ≤ 140 mmHg DBP≤90 mmHg general adult population without diabetes mellitus ( DM ) however treatment hypertension elderly require clarification study many international guideline inconsistent provide recommendation optimal BP initiation ant therapy ad treatment elderly due limit outcome date form randomize control trial ( RCT ) population . The American Heart Association recommendation initiate treatment start lifestyle change medication necessary 140/90 mmHg age 80 , 150/90 mmHg adult ˃ 80 year old ' The 2014 Joint National Committee 's eight report ( JNC 8 ) recommend general population age ≥60 year , initiate pharmacologic treatment low BP systolic BP ( SBP ) ≥150 mm Hg diastolic BP ( DBP ) ≥90 mm Hg treat goal SBP &lt; 150 mm Hg goal DBP &lt; 90 mm Hg . However Reisin et al publish commentary JNC 8 disagreeing , concern increase SBP level require treatment ≥60 year old ≥150/≥90 mmHg may adversely affect renal function . As Per European society Cardiology European Society Hypertension : elderly patient drug treatment recommend systolic BP ≥160 mmHg , ≥140 mmHg young 80 year treatment well tolerate . It recommend initiate antihypertensive treatment high normal BP young patient isolated systolic hypertension . As per 2011 NICE guideline aim target average blood pressure &lt; 135/85 mmHg People &lt; 80 year old &lt; 145/85mmHg people ≥80 year .</detailed_description>
