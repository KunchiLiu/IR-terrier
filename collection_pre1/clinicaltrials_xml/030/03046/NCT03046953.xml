	<brief_title>Avelumab Relapsed Refractory Peripheral T-cell Lymphoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The AVAIL-T trial design find effective avelumab treat patient primary T-cell lymphoma refratory relapse follow initial treatment . Up 36 people take part AVAIL-T trial hospital across United Kingdom . All patient trial recruit 2 year recieve 8 cycle avelumab treatment . Avelumab anti-PD-L1 antibody give infusion every 2 week cycle last 28 day . The trial look response aveulumab , mesuring change tumour size use CT scan , see long response maintain . The trial also look toxicity , overall survival , progression free survival . In addition analyse blood sample sample cancer understand good cancer behaves . This may guide investigator develop good treatment future .</detailed_description>
