	<brief_summary>Total knee arthroplasty ( TKA ) consist surgical replacement joint prosthesis , mainly carry case knee osteoarthrosis . In postoperative period TKA , pain intense limit mobility patient , analgesia one goal physical therapy . One alternative available pain management transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation ( TENS ) , characterize application electric pulse current electrode position skin . Therefore , present study aim evaluate acute effect TENS associate conventional physical therapy compare conventional physical therapy pain level , knee range motion administration morphine rehabilitation patient TKA .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Transcutaneous Electrical Nerve Stimulation After Total Knee Arthroplasty .</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The study include patient underwent TKA surgery Hospital de Clínicas de Porto Alegre ( HCPA ) meet study eligibility criterion . The sample randomly divide experimental group , receive conventional physical therapy associate application TENS , control group , hold conventional physical therapy , first day surgery . The pain level , range motion operate knee Administration morphine . The experimental group receive TENS application hold two self-adhesive electrode size 5x9cm position parallel lumbar spine , nerve root L3 , L4 L5 . TENS apply conventional mode , emit pulse biphasic , symmetrical rectangular wave frequency 100 Hz pulse duration 100 µs , 30 minute . The intensity set accord tolerance patient gradually increased application . The device use Neurodyn II model , IBRAMED . Subsequently , conventional physical therapy perform , use CPM device perform exercise . The CPM device use 30 minute , realize continuous passive flexion extension operate knee . The amplitudes movement gradually increase accordance tolerance patient . The device use Spectra model , KINETEC . Then , patient realize active exercise plantar flexion dorsal flexion ankle adduction abduction hip , isometric exercise flexion extension operate knee active exercise flexion extension non-operated knee . All exercise perform 10 repetition , patient position supine position bed . The control group receive conventional therapy consist use CPM device operate leg exercise low limb , identical perform experimental group .</detailed_description>
