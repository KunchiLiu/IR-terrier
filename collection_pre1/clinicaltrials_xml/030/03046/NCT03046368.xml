	<brief_title>Personalization Cover Letter Response Rate</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Background aim : In Danish Health Morbidity Surveys participation rate decline 61 % 2010 57 % 2013 . A decline participation rate may affect representativeness result survey . Several study indicate survey adapts personalize design feature achieve high participation rate . A feature personalize cover letter appear relevant interesting sample member . The research question , , whether cover letter target content perform well standard letter . The proposition letter increase willingness sample member participate , reflect high response rate . However , little know targeted content effective . Thus , spirit adaptive design , study seek establish whether advantageous participation overall use cover letter target content whether effect participation different version cover letter varies sample subgroup order optimize design feature future survey . Further , give majority sample member participate , sample member sway targeted letter must relatively low response propensity ( standard letter ) . Thus , hypothesize target letter particularly improve response rate low response propensity subgroup ( i.e . young men , unmarried , elderly woman ) . A secondary research question , therefore , whether effect target letter response rate great among sample subgroup low response propensity . Design : A randomized trial incorporate Danish Health Morbidity Survey 2017 paragraph cover letter intend heighten perception relevance survey vary among sample member . The Danish Health Morbidity Survey 2017 base nationally representative random sample 25,000 individual ( include institutionalize individual ) age 16 year old resident Denmark per 1 January 2017 . The sample drawn adult population Denmark use Danish Civil Registration System survey conduct February 3 Maj 5 , 2017 . All sample member randomly allocate , equal probability , one 11 treatment group . One group receive standard letter design general appeal 10 group receive one 10 version target cover letter . In previous Health Morbidity Surveys , sample member receive standard letter . Much content standard letter target letter . The intention hold constant feature design demonstrate credibility survey , allay fear confidentiality , appeal self-interest , provide basic information task participation . All sample member invite either complete web questionnaire fill paper questionnaire concern health morbidity . Statistics : The analysis base logistic regression model 25,000 person invite Health Morbidity Survey 2017 . The independent variable dichotomous indicator treatment group : target standard letter . The dependent variable indicate whether sample member fully partially complete questionnaire . The mediator variable indicate membership three operationally important low response propensity group ( i.e . young men , unmarried , elderly woman ) . The approach first test main effect independent variable treatment group . A second step conduct analysis stratify treatment group . A third step seek identify whether significant effect occur mediator variable dependent variable .</detailed_description>
