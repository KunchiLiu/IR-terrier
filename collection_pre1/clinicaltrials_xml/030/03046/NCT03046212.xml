	<brief_summary>Transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation ( TENS ) characterize application electric pulse current electrode position skin . It alternative pain management surgery total hip arthroplasty ( THA ) , since safe cost-effective therapeutic tool , allow patient move early due pain relief . Therefore , study aim evaluate acute effect TENS associate standard physical therapy compare standard physical therapy intensity pain , hip range motion morphine consumption rehabilitation patient THA .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Transcutaneous Electrical Nerve Stimulation After Total Hip Arthroplasty</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The study include patient underwent THA surgery Hospital de Clínicas de Porto Alegre ( HCPA ) meet study eligibility criterion . The sample randomly divide experimental group , receive conventional physical therapy associate application TENS , control group , hold conventional physical therapy , first day surgery . The pain level , range motion operate hip administration morphine . The experimental group receive TENS application hold four self-adhesive electrode size 5x9cm position five centimeter edge surgical scar . TENS apply conventional mode , emit pulse biphasic , symmetrical rectangular wave frequency 100 Hz pulse duration 100 µs , 30 minute . The intensity set accord tolerance patient gradually increased application . The device use Neurodyn II model , IBRAMED . Subsequently , conventional physical therapy perform . The patient realize active exercise plantar flexion dorsal flexion ankle , flexion extension knee adduction abduction hip , low limb . All exercise perform patient supine position bed , one serie 10 repetition . Control group receive conventional therapy consist exercise low limb , identical perform experimental group .</detailed_description>
