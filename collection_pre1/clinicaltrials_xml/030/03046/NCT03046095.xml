	<brief_summary>It well know period weight train lead increase skeletal muscle size strength . In contrast , period inactivity bed rest immobilization result loss skeletal muscle size strength . However , individual experience variable magnitude muscle size change response change mechanical tension , certain individual experience large change muscle mass whereas others . What currently know , primary goal present investigation , determine whether individual gain muscle mass exercise training also lose muscle immobilize . The investigator hypothesize individual gain muscle training also lose immobilization .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Resistance exercise , pair protein ingestion , lead accretion muscle protein time result augmentation muscle size muscle strength . By virtue ability stimulate increase muscle size strength , resistance exercise effective method use healthcare practitioner promote recovery lose muscle mass result period immobilization ( result break bone , elective surgery , etc. ) . However , exercise general effective therapeutic strategy combat muscle loss frailty , extent individual respond resistance exercise highly variable . Some individual exhibit large change muscle size ( high responder ) whereas exhibit little change ( low responder ) . Thus , one resistance exercise program might appropriate treatment one individual following disuse , another individual might require great stimulus and/or pharmaceutical assistance order fully recover . What currently unknown whether individual experience profound increase skeletal muscle mass follow resistance exercise also lose muscle upon limb immobilization . Answering gap knowledge primary goal study . The procurement knowledge hopefully permit development individualize exercise program use influence recovery skeletal muscle lose inactivity immobilization .</detailed_description>
