	<brief_summary>Increased plasma DPP4 activity ( DPP4a ) could predict subclinical new-onset atherosclerosis , previous study find DPP4a significantly low MI patient compare patient chest pain unstable angina alone , DPP4a associate no-reflow major bleed event STEMI patient hospital stay . As no-reflow phenomenon major bleed event independently associate bad in-hospital long-term prognosis . One may speculate DPP4a associated long-term follow-up adverse cardiovascular event patients.The hypothesis test study .</brief_summary>
