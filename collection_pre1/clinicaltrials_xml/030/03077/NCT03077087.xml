	<brief_summary>This prospective , descriptive , pilot case series involve patient significant burn candidate reconstruction Integra® . Subjects would small area wound would , time excision , small sheet thin Integra® ( 125 cm2 ) place immediately autografted 3:1 mesh split-thickness skin graft . Of note , 125 cm2 represent approximately 0.7 % average sized patient 's total body surface area , even small burn propose trial , area would represent small portion patient 's area injury . The remain injury area would cover standard-thickness Integra® .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Single-Stage Integra Reconstruction Burns</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Integra® , synthetic dermal substitute , utilized burn care decade . Typically , 10-14 day Integra® placement , patient return operate room , top silastic layer Integra® remove , autograft - split-thickness skin graft harvest patient - apply directly top incorporate Integra® . The result regard cosmetically functionally superior result would obtain wound bed autografted time excision , oppose cover Integra® autografted second operation . Integra® use single-stage procedure cover defect without graft show benefit defect fairly small , e.g . fingertip injury , small head neck skin cancer resection . While single-stage reconstruction Integra® demonstrate standard thickness Integra® , decrease thickness would increase likelihood graft survival due decrease distance nutrient diffusion .</detailed_description>
