	<detailed_description>Chronic disease long -- term condition progress severity time generally curable . Results Canadian Community Health Survey ( CCHS ) indicate approximately 21 % adult 20 year least one major chronic disease . Among , approximately 10 % diabetes , 6 % cardiovascular disease , 4 % heart failure , 10 % asthma chronic obstructive pulmonary disorder , report Canadian Chronic Disease Surveillance System .

In Canada , prevalence chronic disease increase patient present multiple condition ( i.e. , multimorbidity ) become norm primary care . Multimorbidity associate poor quality life , decline functional status , high burden healthcare system . Safe , efficacious cost -- effective intervention chronic disease available , however treatments under-utilized . Individuals chronic disease may difficulty achieve care goal due combination patient , provider system level barrier . Complex treatment regimens administration medication ( include insulin ) , clinical monitoring screen complication , adherence dietary lifestyle change , decision seek medical care challenge . The ability comply recommendation dependent number factor , include health financial status , access care care experience , personal circumstance . To help people complex health condition optimize care outcome , community health worker program begin use across United States Canada . Existing community health worker program share common goal help patient overcome modifiable barrier care achieve optimal outcome , possible solution overcome barrier access health care patient complex chronic disease . While community health worker may work within primary health care team , primary role community health worker clinically orient , may fulfil layperson . Depending targeted barrier , specific task may include one : disease education , health system education , assistance insurance coverage , aid care coordination , referral community resource , among others . Herein , investigator propose trial evaluate effectiveness community health worker intervention improve acute care utilization among patient complex chronic disease see primary care .</detailed_description>
