	<brief_title>Dose-response Relationship Study S42909 Leg Ulcer Healing</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>S42909 inhibitor β-Nicotinamide Adenine Dinucleotide Phosphate ( NADPH ) oxidase also inhibit vascular leukocyte adhesion endothelial cell , Matrix Metalloproteinase-2 ( MMP-2 ) Plasminogen Activator Inhibitor-1 ( PAI-1 ) activity . It propose development treatment venous mixed leg ulcer . This proof concept study randomize , double-blind , placebo-controlled , multicenter , Phase IIa trial evaluate dose response S42909 treatment venous leg ulcer . Patients suffer chronic venous disease least one active venous leg ulcer select selection visit ( ASSE ) . One Reference Ulcer ( RU ) define large ulcer size fit area selection criterion establish . At ASSE , first picture take cleanse debridement second picture take cleanse debridement . The investigator check selection RU area compliant selection criterion . Patients start selection period switch current pharmacological and/or local treatment ( ) venous leg ulcer local wound care sterile saline solution , `` non-active '' dressing standardize compression ( strength type compression ) . They administrate placebo selection treatment period fourteen day . Three ( four ) work day inclusion visit , participant come site RU picture order get RU area central measurement inclusion visit ( W000 ) . At W000 , investigator check inclusion RU area compliant inclusion criterion . The investigator also check participant compliant selection treatment stocking wear . All participant find eligible inclusion randomize one follow six group - S42909 : 100 , 200 , 400 , 800 1200 mg per day- placebo . The participant enter 6 week ambulatory Investigational Medicinal Product ( IMP ) treatment period top standard care ( standardize compression local wound care sterile saline solution `` non-active '' dress ) follow 2 week follow-up period standard care . During period participant return investigator 's site intermediate visit one week ( W001 ) , two week ( W002 ) , three week ( W003 ) , four week ( W004 ) , six week ( W006 ) eight week ( W008 ) . Participants continue receive standardize compression therapy local wound care ( sterile saline solution `` non-active '' dress ) end study ( W008 ) .</detailed_description>
