	<brief_title>The Haem Nitrite Study - The Effects Haemoglobin NO-blockade Nitrite-induced Forearm Vessel Dilatation</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This healthy volunteer study . Following entry cross-over trial , participant randomize undergo experiment either normoxic follow hypoxic condition , hypoxic follow normoxic condition . Subjects donate whole blood autologous unit preselected NHSBT donation site . The unit transport back NNUH blood bank minimum 30 day ( maximum 35 day ) donation . Volunteers test baseline blood . Volunteers randomise normoxia hypoxia . The undergo nitrite infusion , follow autologous whole blood transfusion second nitrite infusion ( co-infuse end transfusion ) . During protocol , participant undergo repeat FBFR measurement use strain-gauge plethysmography . After minimum 12 week rest period initial donation , participant cross-over opposite oxygen condition ( per initial randomization ) protocol repeat . All intervention perform fully trained competent medical staff .</detailed_description>
