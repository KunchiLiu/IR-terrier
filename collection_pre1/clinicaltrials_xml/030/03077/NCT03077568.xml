	<detailed_description>A randomize control trial need strengthen evidence area web-based self-management program stress-reduction . The program evaluate name My Stress Control , design educate user stress affect health , provide tool handle stress also educate user problem-solving method prevent manage stress-related problem future . My Stress Control self-administered fully automate web-application . Aim The aim study compare effect web-application support behavior change stress-management wait list group person perceive stress . Method This study design randomize control trial ( RCT ) . The CONSORT guideline use report study . Sample : Different sector region include . Three different high-schools Västerås City , social service authority Västerås municipality , large private company region , three different clinic within county council municipality Köping sign attestation participation . Power : Power calculate use study compare acceptance commitment therapy wait-list group primary outcome stress , measure PSS-14 ( Cohen , Kamark , &amp; Mermelstein , 1983 ) . More specifically power calculate use score group report low stress-levels 25 PSS-14 ( Brinkborg , Michaneck , Hessel , &amp; Berglund , 2011 ) . The calculation adjust between-group comparison well within-group comparison . An estimated effect size .40 power equal .80 significance level 0.05 , give estimate population size 98 individual group . With estimate dropout rate 20 % population need group 118 person . Randomization : Since include worksites different kind , number employee , randomization do quotation 6-person block randomization . The block randomization make sample percentage similar include worksites . Intervention : The intervention program web-based stress self-management My Stress Control . My Stress Control start screen stress level accord Perceived Stress Scale ( PSS ) ( Cohen et al. , 1983 ) , cut score 17 ( Brinkborg et al. , 2011 ) access program . To avoid include user extend problem anxiety depression , screen do Hospital Anxiety Depression Scale ( HADS ) ( Zigmond &amp; Snaith , 1983 ) . Users score 11 high either two subscales recommend seek support traditional healthcare . The security web-application high information encrypt . IP address try log without access ban certain number trial . The secure http use instead less secure http . All request towards server log store data backup do continuously . Considering theoretical framework self-management program several useful health psychological theory . Regarding behavior change stress context three theory arise important ; The Transactional Theory Stress Coping ( TTC ) ( Lazarus &amp; Folkman , 1984 ) , Social Cognitive Theory ( SCT ) ( Bandura , 1989 ) , The Transtheoretical Model ( TTM ) Theory Stages Change ( SoC ) ( Evers et al. , 2006 ) , Theory Reasoned Action Theory Planned Behavior ( Madden , Ellen , &amp; Ajzen , 1992 ) . The theory play crucial role tailor assess stress . Studies show web-based program use theory successful web-based program behavior change ( Webb , Joseph , Yardley , &amp; Michie , 2010 ) . The program sensitive user formulates guide functional behavior analysis also tailor program recommend possible preferable stress-management technique user . These stress-management technique specific behavior change technique support user situation experience stress prevent handle consequence stress . The user opportunity take part stress-management technique include . The stress-management technique include : assertiveness training ( Imamura et al. , 2014 ) , cognitive restructuring ( Welbourne , Eggerth , Hartley , Andrew , &amp; Sanches , 2007 ) , pleasant activity scheduling ( Mazzucchelli , Kane , &amp; Rees , 2010 ) , relaxation ( Ponce et al. , 2008 ) , time-management ( Häfner &amp; Stock , 2010 ) , stimulus control sleep restriction improve sleep ( Thiart , Lehr , Ebert , Berking , &amp; Riper , 2015 ) physical activity ( Lindegård , Jonsdottir , Börjesson , Lindwall , &amp; Gerber , 2015 ) . All technique show effective stress-management traditional face-to-face therapy deliver application web . Few program combine several technique , program use one technique . No program combine technique include My Stress Control find . The commonly use behavior modification technique find meta-analysis change health behavior via Internet provide information consequence behavior , self-monitoring behavior identification barrier facilitator behavior ( Evers , Prochaska , Driskell , Cummins , &amp; Velicer , 2003 ) . In another study also state treatment include self-monitoring behavior least one follow five behavioral change method show effective behavior modification treatment without technique ; encourage intention formulation , specific goal-setting , feedback performance reevaluation goal ( Michie , Abraham , Whittington , McAteer , &amp; Gupta , 2009 ) . These technique central stress-management program . These behavior modification technique general technique behavior change specific behavior change technique stress-management , use several part My Stress Control . They example use support user handle specific technique stress management mention . For example : Goal set self-monitoring use assignment stress-management technique My Stress Control . Thus , use web-based , self-management program My Stress Control , individual suppose receive support develop skill well cope work related stress . Procedure : After inform consent participant , approximately 2-4 month go web-based program stress self-management . The waiting-list group also get access My Stress Control post-measurements . Reminders send questionnaire send two week questionnaire answer intervention two four week estimate time questionnaire answer intervention . Data-analysis : Descriptive statistic use demographic data . Missing data replace recommended different measurement include , commonly use mean respond item within sub scale . Inferential analysis conduct use multivariate statistical analysis . Drop-out analysis conduct compare pre-interventions measure complete program .</detailed_description>
