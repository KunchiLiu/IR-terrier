	<brief_title>Nelfinavir Mesylate Treating Patients With Kaposi Sarcoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To determine efficacy therapeutic escalation strategy consist standard dose nelfinavir ( nelfinavir mesylate ) , follow high dose nelfinavir , treatment Kaposi sarcoma ( KS ) tumor lesion . With 36 evaluable participant , null hypothesis reject 11 participant respond . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . To evaluate safety high dose nelfinavir among participant KS . II . To assess effect nelfinavir Kaposi sarcoma-associated herpesvirus ( KSHV ) lytic gene expression tumor tissue . III . To correlate nelfinavir primary active metabolite , M8 , concentration tumor response , antiviral response , adverse effect participant KS . IV . To assess effect nelfinavir KSHV copy number saliva . TERTIARY OBJECTIVES : I . To assess effect nelfinavir KSHV copy number PBMC plasma . II . To assess effect nelfinavir herpes simplex virus ( HSV ) , cytomegalovirus ( CMV ) Epstein-Barr virus ( EBV ) copy number saliva . OUTLINE : STANDARD DOSE NELFINAVIR MESYLATE : Patients receive standard dose nelfinavir mesylate orally ( PO ) twice daily ( BID ) 4 week absence progressive disease ( PD ) . Patients PD 4 week proceed high-dose nelfinavir mesylate . At week 8 , stable disease ( SD ) partial response ( PR ) , patient advance high-dose nelfinavir mesylate . Patients discontinue standard dose nelfinavir mesylate 4 week documentation complete response ( CR ) . HIGH DOSE NELFINAVIR MESYLATE : Patients PD continue receive high-dose nelfinavir mesylate PO BID 4 week . If PD document 4 week high dose level , nelfinavir mesylate discontinue . If SD PR , patient continue receive nelfinavir mesylate 16 week . If CR , patient discontinue high-dose nelfinavir mesylate 4 week documentation CR . After completion study treatment , patient follow 8 week .</detailed_description>
