	<brief_title>Study PEMF Evaluate VPT Thermal Sensory Subjects With Diabetic Peripheral Neuropathy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Multi-center , sham-controlled , double-blind , enriched enrollment , randomize withdrawal clinical trial conduct subject bilateral symmetrical diabetic peripheral neuropathy . Eligible subject include 22 80 year age Type 1 Type 2 diabetes persistent pain , numbness , tingle , burn foot despite treatment . Eligible subject receive two active treatment device ( one foot , allow simultaneous treatment ) treat home , twice daily 60 day return clinic Day 61 response assessment . Subjects determine responder Day 61 ( subject achieve 1-point decrease average pain score last 24 hour use Numeric Pain Rating Scale ( NPRS ) ) randomize 1:1 either active treatment inactive sham device continue treat Day 120 . Subjects determine non-responders Day 61 continue treat active device give enrollment return clinic Day 75 Day 91 response assessment . If subject determine responder Day 75 , randomize 1:1 receive either active treatment inactive sham continue treat Day 120 . If subject determine responder Day 91 , randomize 1:1 receive either active treatment sham continue treat Day 120 . If subject continue non-responder Day 91 terminate study .</detailed_description>
