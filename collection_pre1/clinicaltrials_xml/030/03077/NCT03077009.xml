	<brief_title>Functional Improvement UTC Achilles Tendon After Sodium Hyaluronate Injection Plantaris Syndrome</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Introduction Midportion Achilles tendinopathy common source disability , typical feature include pain , swell dysfunction [ Roche ] . The cause multifactorial [ Roche ] . First line treatment typically non operative include eccentric load program [ Alfredson-1998 ] , high volume injection [ Chan ] , platelet rich plasma [ de Vos JAMA 2010 ] , sclerosing agent injection [ Alfredson-2005 ] , shock wave therapy [ Lynen ] [ Saxena ] resistant case , surgery [ Alfredson-2011 ] . Plantaris friction syndrome ( PFS ) One possible cause midportion Achilles tendinopathy plantaris friction syndrome ( PFS ) . In subset patient , pain locate postero-medial aspect Achilles tendon . The plantaris tendon small vestigial tendon originate lateral femoral condyle , cross obliquely medial side Achilles tendon insert medial side calcaneum . The anatomy insertion highly variable . Over 80 % plantaris tendon insert separately Achilles tendon [ Daseler ] . Biomechanical evidence suggest plantaris tendon stiffer strong Achilles tendon [ Lintz ] . Under load therefore , differential movement tendon may occur . Subsequently plantaris tendon become tendinopathic thicken . Adhesions may develop adjacent Achilles tendon [ Bedi ] , initiate medial midportion Achilles tendinopathy . Sensitization nerve ending fat layer Achilles plantaris also demonstrate . The optimal treatment PFS currently unclear . Treatments include physiotherapy , injection surgical excision [ Bedi ] [ Pearce ] [ Weinberg ] [ Calder-2014 ] [ Alfredson-2011 ] . Sodium Hyaluronate One potential treatment injection sodium hyaluronate viscosupplement solution . It primarily use joint lubrication arthropathy , also use tendinopathy [ Lynen ] . Ostenil Tendon sodium hyaluronate solution potentially act several way reduce pain . One mode act lubricant tendon tendon sheath [ Akasaka 2005 ] [ Akasaka 2006 ] [ Nishida ] [ Kumar ] [ St Onge ] . It may also promote tendon heal [ Chen ] [ Yagishta ] . According unpublished work , Ostenil Tendon significantly reduce pain 6 week peroneal also midportion Achilles tendinopathy [ Company literature ] . It may also act medium allow free passage nutrient tendon [ Hagberg ] . Sodium hyaluronate injection place interval plantaris tendon Achilles tendon could potentially reduce friction subsequently pain . Although effect sodium hyaluronate injection report hip knee , previous study report efficacy PFS . The primary aim current study assess impact sodium hyaluronate injection patient PFS . Ultrasound tissue characterization Methods assess Achilles tendon tendinopathy continue debate . Common method include ultrasound magnetic resonance image [ Khan ] [ Astrom ] . A novel assessment tool ultrasound tissue characterization ( UTC ) use ultrasound quantify tendon structure [ van Schie ] [ Docking-2015 ] [ Docking-2016 ] [ Rosengarten ] [ Bedi ] . Structural integrity tendon matrix categorize four echo type ( 1-green , 2-blue , 3-red , 4-black ) . Echo type 1 2 reflect align fibrillar structure , whereas type 3 4 indicate disorganise tissue [ Bedi ] . The entire length tendon analyze minimum detectable difference structure 1 % [ Docking-2015 ] . Bedi et al show significant improvement UTC follow excision plantaris midportion Achilles tendinopathy [ Bedi ] . However study limited UTC image perform uniform time pre- post- surgery [ Bedi ] . Masci et al find improvement UTC echo-structure 6 month follow-up post plantaris excision combine improvement VISA-A score [ Masci ] . It debate whether fibrillar integrity matrix organisation correlate symptom . For example , study elite Australian football player show UTC change follow pre-season training , player remain asymptomatic start end study [ Rosengarten ] . Ultrasound study also question relationship tendon structure tendinopathy patient function [ Khan ] [ McAuliffe ] . In study gymnast , clinical assessment moderate correlation ultrasound MR appearance [ Emerson ] . Given novelty UTC Achilles tendon , secondary aim study ass whether UTC change follow treatment PFS correlate change functional outcome score . Aims summary 1 . To determine change Achilles tendon matrix structure use UTC treatment ( 6 month follow ) 2 . To assess medium term ( 2 year ) effectiveness sodium hyaluronate injection space plantaris Achilles tendon midportion Achilles tendinopathy associate PFS . 3 . To correlate UTC change functional score Hypothesis The alternate hypotheses sodium hyaluronate injection improve 1 ) function 2 ) structure Achilles tendon PFS . Outcome measure - Ultrasonographic tissue characterisation ( UTC ) - Functional score - Victorian Institute Sports Assessment-Achilles ( VISA-A ) [ Robinson ] Foot Ankle Outcome score ( FAOS ) Methods This single centre prospective case series patient PFS diagnose base upon clinical examination Consultant foot &amp; ankle surgeon , physiotherapist imaging . Patients prospectively follow pre post intervention patient report outcome score . Sample Population 33 patient diagnosed PFS identify invited participate study decision make treat sodium hyaluronate . Inclusion Criteria Patients age 18-75 year Able provide inform consent Diagnosis PFS require sodium hyaluronate injection Able follow physiotherapy instruction Exclusion Criteria Previous Achilles tendon surgery Previous injection therapy Achilles midportion tendinopathy Age &lt; 18 &gt; 75 year Active local infection Active bleeding disorder anticoagulant therapy Allergies lignocaine sodium hyaluronate Active deep vein thrombosis Patient Recruitment Consent All patient give information sheet regard study consent CI Fortius foot ankle fellow . All patient recruit treated Fortius Clinic . Proposed treatment include one two sodium hyaluronate ( Ostenil Tendon ) injection . Physiotherapy routine part current treatment , usually provide site . Injection protocol All injection carry Consultant Radiologist Fortius Clinic . Approximately 3-5mm 1 % lignocaine inject create plane Plantaris medial Achilles tendon . Subsequently , 2-3ml Ostenil Tendon ( sodium hyaluronate ) inject space Achilles plantaris tendon . UTC assessment UTC assessment 6 12 week routine part current treatment protocol PFS allow guidance treatment . Patients pre post treatment UTC assessment Achilles tendon . For purpose study , extra UTC assessment perform 6 month , part routine clinical follow appointment . This final UTC assessment provide free patient . All UTC assessment conduct experienced physiotherapist . Follow Patient report outcome score complete prior treatment 6 week , 3 months,6 month , 1 2 year . Outcome score 1 2 year perform online via automate email system . UTC conduct 6 week , 3 month 6 month . Ethical Issues : Patients free choose participate study . If choose participate affect treatment way . No patient volunteer take part study without give write informed consent exclude patient unable give consent . Legal Issues : There legal issue identify affect study . Management issue : This study take place Fortius Clinic , private clinic . The patient include would receive one two sodium hyaluronate injection , two UTC assessment part routine treatment PFS . They charge normal . There additional charge final UTC assessment 6 month . Risks : Patients agree take part study receive routine treatment PFS would receive even study take place . There therefore additional risk patient . Data collection All data collection do within premise Fortius clinic member clinical team , include physiotherapist work site Tendon Performance Clinic . In addition outcome score UTC data information regard patient demographic , medical history treatment also collect . Data confidentiality Data store Fortius/Tendon Performance Clinic computer password protect comply information governance guideline . No one outside clinical team access data . Any information leave clinic patient identifiable information remove . All result analyse publish use anonymous data . Details patient 's involvement study also record patient ' medical record hold Fortius Clinic/Tendon Performance Clinic . Power analysis In 18 asymptomatic elite Australian football player , UTC demonstrate improvement Achilles tendon structure 5 month period follow pre-season train [ Docking-2016 ] . Bedi et al report UTC change follow Plantaris excision ventral paratendinous Achilles tendon scrap athlete . In 11 patient , fibrillar structure Achilles tendon improve 90 96 % , SD 8 % p=.04 . Mean VISA-A score improve 51 95 , SD 12 , p=.0001 . Regarding sodium hyaluronate injection , one study find assess use midportion Achilles tendinopathy [ Lynen ] . Lynen et al compare two paratendinous injection three ESWT treatment give weekly interval 62 patient . No previous study assess use PFS . Considering limit evidence available , estimate sample size required demonstrate improvement UTC ( assume change type 1 2 echo type 90 % 96 % , SD 8 % ) least 28 patient . With expect drop rate 15 % , plan recruit 33 patient study . Statistical analysis Analyses conduct use statistical package . A paired test use compare pre post treatment VISA-A score . UTC result compare use Wilcoxon sign rank test ( non parametric data ) . A p value 0.05 define statistically significant .</detailed_description>
