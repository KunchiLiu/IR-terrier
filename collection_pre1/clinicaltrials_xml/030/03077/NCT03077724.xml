	<detailed_description>The goal submission conduct clinical trial n-3 long-chain polyunsaturated fatty acid ( LCPUFAs ) smoke cessation pregnant woman , high risk continue smoke pregnant generally use FDA-approved smoking cessation medication . Recently , two small scale , double-blind , randomize control trial find supplementation n-3 LCPUFA reduce sign nicotine dependence . While promise , study conduct pregnancy , leave important gap scientific literature vulnerable group smoker . For proposal , investigator develop , test , refine recruitment strategy , collect data demonstrate ability successfully recruit pregnant woman actively smoke . The investigator collect side effect , tolerability , adherence data regard intervention . Finally , investigator gather preliminary effect size data smoke behavior allow formal estimate sample size large , definitive trial . The investigator hypothesize pregnant smoker randomize n-3 LCPUFA supplementation smoke few cigarette per day compare woman allocate placebo . In secondary analysis investigator compare self-reported nicotine craving 7-day point-prevalence smoking abstinence ( assessed 30 day ) n-3 LCPUFA placebo group . The investigator intend use preliminary data inform future randomize , double-blind , placebo-controlled trial n-3 LCPUFA supplementation long-term tobacco cessation pregnancy . The specific aim : SA1 : To successfully recruit randomize 40 pregnant , current smoker clinical trial n-3 LCPUFA supplementation . SA2 : To assess tolerability 4 gm/day n-3 LCPUFA supplementation pregnant , current smoker 4-week period SA3 : To determine effect 4 grams/day n-3 LCPUFA supplementation 4-weeks cigarette smoke per day self-reported nicotine craving pregnant smoker Research Design Methods This study randomize , double-blind , placebo control study 4 grams/day n-3 LCPUFA supplementation versus placebo 4-weeks . The study recruit pregnant woman second trimester currently smoke . The primary outcome include change baseline cigarette per day . The secondary outcome self-reported nicotine craving , point prevalence abstinence 30 day . The investigator also collect safety tolerability data . Eligible patient pregnant woman currently smoke see Vanderbilt University Medical Center . The study single-site , randomize , double-blind , placebo-controlled , parallel arm trial design . The two arm include one treatment arm one placebo arm . Treatment 4.2 grams/day EPA + DHA . Placebo 5 gram olive oil capsule form . The intervention period last 4-weeks . The study randomize 40 participant two treatment arm . As feasibility study , investigator power study account drop-outs . Participants identify search electronic search , direct referral Tobacco Treatment Service , self-referral clinic flier . Study physicians conduct medical chart review participant potentially eligible invite Clinic Visit 1 ( baseline ) . The study include three clinic visit : Clinic Visit 1 : After eligibility confirm , consent obtain . A brief medical history obtain . Participants complete five questionnaire . Subjects complete Fagerström Tolerance Questionnaire , Minnesota Withdrawal Symptom Checklist , Questionnaire Smoking Urges-brief , PHQ-4 , complete detailed interview tobacco use habit include record cigarette per day smoke . Questionnaires administer study staff CRC nurse directly REDCap study database . Blood , urine , exhale CO measurement collect . Participants dispense four-week supply medication . Participants give pill diary . Clinic Visit 2 : Participants complete study questionnaire . Blood , urine , exhale CO measurement collect . Participants report adverse event . Clinic Visit 3 : Participants complete study questionnaire . Blood , urine , exhale CO measurement collect . Participants report adverse event return unused medication . Rationale Dose : As described , two prior study conduct smoker assess effect supplemental n-3 LCPUFAs nicotine craving . While study report statistically reduction self-reported nicotine craving intervention arm , reduction cigarette smoke per day see study high-dose n-3 LCPUFA ( &gt; 4 grams/day ) oppose low dose n-3 LCPUFA ( 1 gram/day ) . These study would suggest dose effect investigator use high-dose n-3 LCPUFA intervention pilot study . Primary Outcome The primary outcome reduction total number cigarette per day baseline 4-weeks . Secondary Outcomes The secondary outcome 1 ) reduction Fagerström Tolerance Questionnaire ; 2 ) point prevalence abstinence 4 week biochemically confirm end-expired carbon monoxide . Safety Tolerability Outcomes Safety tolerability outcome include : 1 ) report AEs 2 ) rate discontinuation study medication due side effect Sample Size Justification Statistical Analysis Plan Statistical analysis plan Descriptive statistic , include mean , standard deviation , range continuous variable , well percent frequency categorical variable , present . Standard graph screen technique use detect outlier ensure data accuracy . For primary analysis post-intervention cigarette per day , investigator perform Wilcoxon ( Mann Whitney ) rank sum test evaluate 5 % significance level . This data analysis plan carry use statistical software SAS® ( Cary , North Carolina ) statistical package R ( R Development Core Team , 2008 ) . For primary outcome investigator compare change total number cigarette smoke per day baseline , 2-weeks , 4-weeks . This outcome continuous variable primary analysis . Secondary outcome include change Fagerström Tolerance Questionnaire , point prevalence abstinence 4 week biochemically confirm end-expired carbon monoxide . The investigator compare change outcome 4-weeks arm use logistic regression use repeat measured ANOVA . Sample size estimation power analysis For primary outcome , assumption baseline number cigarette per day 11 SD 5 ( 11 ) , study able detect reduction 41 % cigarette per day smoker allocate n-3 LCPUFA arm compare placebo 80 % power . The Fagerström Tolerance Questionnaire 10-point Likert scale . Estimating baseline score 7.3 ± 1.6 investigator 80 % power detect difference 1 SD study arm .</detailed_description>
