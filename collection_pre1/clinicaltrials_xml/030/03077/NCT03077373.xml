Informed consent consist : ( ) participation standardize measurement blood pressure well waist hip circumference baseline 12-month follow , ( ii ) completion standardize questionnaire 4 time point ( baseline , 4-month , 7-month , 12-month follow-up ) . Participation accelerometry define option . Individuals agree wear accelerometer 10 day baseline 12-month follow-up , . After baseline assessment , individual randomly allocate control intervention group ( ratio 1:1 ) . Intervention : The computerize intervention system include three interaction participant aim increase moderate-to-vigorous physical activity reduce sedentary time .
