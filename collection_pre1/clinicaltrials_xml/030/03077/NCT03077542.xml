	<brief_summary>Background : Peripheral blood stem cell transplantation procedure use people sickle cell disease . Researchers want improve success reduce complication procedure . This might allow people transplant . Objective : To see new transplant regime effective , safe well tolerated people sickle cell disease . Eligibility : Adults least 18 year old sickle cell disease certain complication . A relative half tissue match . Design : Participants screen medical history , physical exam , blood test . Recipients also : - Heart , lung , mental health test - Chest x-rays - Bone marrow take pelvic bone - Eyes teeth check Recipients large central line insert vein 6 month . Donors vein test IV insert 1 day rare occasion 2 day . Donors get drug activate bone marrow . It inject 6 day . Donors least 1 five-hour procedure bone marrow stem cell collect . Blood take vein one arm rare case groin vein put machine . Some blood save rest return . Stem cell take save blood lab freeze ready give recipient . Recipients : - Stems cell collect frozen - Hygiene lesson - Bone density scan - Low-dose radiation - Drugs immune system - Donor cell infused central line - Transfusions After 30 day , recipient leave hospital . They must stay near NIH 3 month transplant frequent visit . After return home , 8 visit 5 year , contact yearly .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Nonmyeloablative Haploidentical Peripheral Blood Mobilized Hematopoietic Precursor Cell Transplantation Sickle Cell Disease</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Nonmyeloablative allogeneic peripheral blood stem cell ( PBSC ) transplant currently investigate phase I/II trial assess engraftment , efficacy , toxicity number transplant center . Our ongoing protocol patient severe congenital anemia , particularly sickle cell disease ( SCD ) , HLA-matched sibling donor excellent preliminary result . None patient engraft sickle-related event evidence graft versus host disease ( GVHD ) . There significant toxicity associate condition regimen . An additional protocol ongoing patient high risk graft rejection employ pentostatin oral cyclophosphamide ( PC ) pre-transplant deplete recipient lymphocytes attempt decrease rate graft rejection . Four 4 patient transplant remain free SCD . Our main limitation lack HLA-matched sibling donor majority patient . We perform study patient severe SCD lack suitable donor underwent search match unrelated donor umbilical cord donor . The vast majority patient find appropriate alternative donor . We therefore seek develop safe nonmyeloablative regimen apply haploidentical set family member serve donor greatly expand donor pool . We develop nonmyeloablative haploidentical PBSC transplant protocol include 3 cohort , stop rule build regimen failure , define graft rejection severe GVHD . All include 400 cGy total body irradiation ( TBI ) , alemtuzumab , sirolimus . The first cohort include cyclophosphamide . The 2nd include one dose cyclophosphamide give 50mg/kg day 3 post-transplant , 3rd include 100mg/kg cyclophosphamide give divided dos day 3 4 post-transplant . The engraftment rate percentage patient remain free SCD improve successive cohort . However , graft rejection rate 3rd cohort remain high 50 % . To attempt reduce rate graft rejection haploidentical setting , protocol add PC condition regimen . In protocol , propose PBSC transplantation patient SCD consider high risk complication ineligible standard bone marrow transplantation , allogeneic peripheral blood stem cell haploidentical donor use novel immunosuppressive regimen without myeloablation attempt decrease transplant-related morbidity/mortality . The low intensity nonmyeloablative conditioning regimen consist relatively low radiation dose therapeutic radiation , Alemtuzumab ( Campath ) , Sirolimus ( Rapamune ) , Cyclophosphamide ( Cytoxan ) , pentostatin ( Nipent ) strategy provide adequate immunosuppression allow sufficient engraftment clinical remission low risk GVHD development . T-cell replete , donor-derived , granulocyte colony-stimulating factor ( G-CSF ) -mobilized PBSC use establish hematopoietic lymphoid reconstitution . The primary endpoint study percentage patient 100 day post-transplant rejected graft , without severe GVHD ( define grade 3 high acute GVHD chronic extensive GVHD ) . Other endpoint include degree donor-host chimerism necessary long-term graft survival disease amelioration , incidence acute chronic GVHD , incidence graft rejection , transplant-related morbidity , well disease-free overall survival .</detailed_description>
