	<brief_summary>The overall purpose project advance understand neurophysiological feature Rett syndrome ( RTT ) , MECP2 Duplication ( MECP2 Dup ) RTT-related disorder ( CDKL5 , FOXG1 ) gain insight disease pathogenesis , emphasis identify biomarkers disease evolution severity . This specific study intertwine core study Natural History Rett Syndrome Related Disorders ( RTT5211 ) , characterize range clinical involvement genotype-phenotype correlation provide phenotypical data determine clinical relevance neurophysiologic parameter ; study subject co- primarily enrol RTT5211 . The proposed study serve basis future translational investigation , include refinement biomarkers , development outcome measure , clinical trial per se .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Individuals RTT , MECP2 Dup RTT-related disorder significant abnormality number neurophysiological measure EEG Evoked Potentials ( EP ) . Studies representative animal model reproduce many abnormality . Little known relationship neurophysiological finding disease evolution , severity specific clinical feature . Therefore , consider likely detailed understand neurophysiological feature would provide additional insight disease pathogenesis lead biomarkers disease state severity different feature . Consequently , specialize neurophysiological assessment acquire , without sedation type pharmacological manipulation , subset 170 subject : 60 RTT , 18 MECP2 Dup , 32 RTT-related disorder , 60 age-matched typically develop control ( 30 female , 30 male ) . Primary evaluation include auditory ERP ( AEP ) visual ERP ( VEP ) , well secondary analysis specific rhythms/band activity obtain ERP acquisition ( gamma band change frontal alpha band asymmetry ) . Individuals recruit across spectra age severity . The main goal project identify potential biomarkers become measure intervention translational study , time , provide insight abnormal synaptic activity pathogenesis RTT , MECP2 Dup , RTT-related disorder . Therefore , propose assessment perform three group subject enrol consortium ( RTT5211 ) : RTT , MECP2 Dup , RTT-related disorder . Findings set disorder link objective longitudinal clinical neurobehavioral data ( RTT5211 ) well biological factor genotyping may link clinical severity ( RTT5213 ) . The neurophysiological parameter RTT , MECP2 Dup , RTT-related disorder correlate also disease staging , overall clinical severity score exploratory analysis specific clinical feature ; repeat 3 time ( i.e. , annual [ every 10-14 month ] evaluation , context visit RTT5211 protocol ) course study . For purpose , linear regression linear mixed model use . Preliminary publish data indicate RTT MECP2 Dup distinct pattern cortical processing AEP , VEP demonstrate disorder age/disease-stage dependent change . Phenotypic severity may relate specific ERP parameter , modest effect ( severity ) category mutation observe . In addition , secondary analysis specific EEG rhythms/band activity expand preliminary study demonstrate alpha band asymmetry marker anxiety-like response RTT .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Individuals RTT , MECP2 Dup , RTTrelated disorder ( mutation deletion CDKL5 FOXG1 gene ) also enrol RTT5211 Protocol , collect longitudinal clinical neurobehavioral data link RTT5211 Protocol RDCRN identification number . No phenotypical selection subject perform ; expect cohort representative disorder . A cohort 60 typically develop girl boy ( 30 ) enrol serve control . Typical development control group confirm normal intelligence quotient score equivalent score developmental test use standardized measure negative psychiatric diagnosis standardize diagnostic interview administer mother , father guardian ( Diagnostic Interview Children Adolescents , Revised : Parents ' Version ) . All control subject must negative history neurologic impairment neuropsychiatric condition show clinical evidence genetic disorder . Individuals meet criterion exclude .</criteria>
