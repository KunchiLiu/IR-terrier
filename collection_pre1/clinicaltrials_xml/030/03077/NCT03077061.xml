	<brief_summary>The project evaluate potential benefit use bone replacement graft adjunct surgical therapy peri-implantitis . The project conduct two-armed randomized control clinical trial 5-year duration 7 clinical center . 140 systemically healthy patient diagnose peri-implantitis randomly assign treat without bone replacement graft . Outcome measure include assessment inflammation , probe depth , recession , radiological parameter PROMs .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Peri-implantitis - Reconstructive Surgical Therapy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Objective The overall objective project evaluate clinical efficacy use bone substitute material reconstructive surgical therapy peri-implantitis-associated osseous defect . Hypothesis : The use bone substitute material reconstructive therapy peri-implantitis increase likelihood achieve treatment success . Relevance clinical practice The project provide significant contribution understand outcome use reconstructive procedure treatment peri-implantitis . Study population , design treatment procedures The project conduct two-armed randomized control clinical trial 5-year duration 7 clinical center . 140 systemically healthy patient implant ≥1 year function diagnose advanced peri-implantitis ≥1 implant enrol . Inclusion criterion Age ≥ 18 year ≥1 implant ( ≥1 year function ) present PPD ≥7 mm BoP/Pus . Confirmed bone loss ≥3 mm implant ( ) Exclusion criterion Treated peri-implantitis previous 6 month Intake systemic local antibiotic previous 6 month Systemic condition affect peri-implant tissue Systemic condition impede surgical intervention Surgical procedures Surgical procedure perform one month baseline examination initiation plaque control . Three day surgery 10-day systemic antibiotic regimen initiate . Full thickness flap elevate inflamed tissue remove . The implant surface clean mini-gauze soaked saline . The osseous defect ≤4 mm wide &gt; 3 mm deep . The defect addition mesial distal bone wall preferably exhibit least lingual buccal bone wall . The randomly assign treatment strategy , stratify smoking , reveal debridement . Test procedure : The defect fill Bio-Oss Collagen® flap suture previous position . Control procedure : Flaps suture previous position . Sutures remove 2 week treatment , follow 6-week control . Clinical examination perform 6 , 12 , 24 , 36 , 48 60 month therapy . Maintenance therapy provide base individual need . Clinical assessment One calibrate examiner clinical center perform assessment . The following variable assess four site around implant : Plaque , probe pocket depth ( PPD ) , bleed probe ( BoP ) , probe attachment level ( PAL ) recession ( REC ) . Treatment success Treatment success define absence BoP/Pus , PPD ≤5 mm ≤1 mm recession . Peri-implant site show BoP PPD ≥6 mm re-examination schedule treatment . Patient-related outcome variable assess baseline follow-up include esthetic functional appreciation , pain discomfort . Radiographic assessment Intra-oral radiograph obtain prior surgery ( baseline ) 1- , 3- 5-year re-examinations . Analysis radiograph perform specialist oral-maxillofacial radiology . The examiner blind treatment procedure . The assessment include defect fill crestal bone support . Power calculation A total 122 patient ( 61 per group ) provide power 80 % alpha set 0.05 detect difference 1 mm mean PPD change group , give SD 1.97 ( Carcuac et al. , 2016 ) . 140 individual include compensate drop-out . Data analysis Mean change various variable proportion sit fulfil criterion treatment success calculate . A multilevel model clinical center high level implant low build test influence measure factor outcomes compensate potential clustering data . Data analysis include multilevel modeling conduct collaboration biostatistician . Schedule investigational event 1 . Screening identification subject . 2 . Baseline clinical examination implant select study . Case presentation reinforcement self-performed plaque control . Assessment PROM . Professional mechanical infection control . 3 . Radiographic examination prior surgical therapy ( within 4 week ) . 4 . Surgical therapy include test control treatment procedure study site . 5 . 2 week - suture removal . Assessment PROM . 6 . 6 week - professional supra-mucosal cleaning reinforcement oral hygiene . 7 . 6 month - clinical examination . 8 . 12 month - clinical radiological examination . Assessment PROM . 9 . 24 month - clinical examination . 10 . 36 month - clinical radiological examination . Assessment PROM . 11 . 48 month - clinical examination . 12 . 60 month - clinical radiological examination . Assessment PROM .</detailed_description>
