	<brief_summary>We propose develop smartphone app ( call OFFBup ) help patient manage opioid withdrawal buprenorphine taper detoxification . The OFFBup smartphone intervention resource patient access anytime anywhere . If OFFBup intervention effective help patient undergoing buprenorphine detoxification decrease relapse illicit drug use , could integrate standard care office-based buprenorphine clinical practice , well methadone program , thereby substantial public health impact .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>An App Aid Transitioning Off Opiate Replacement Therapy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>In last decade , rate opioid misuse entry substance abuse treatment opioid dependence increase significantly . An increase number opioid dependent individual treat buprenorphine ( effective , safe , convenient , accessible alternative methadone treatment ) . After period maintenance patient , majority opioid dependent patient interested come medication , either personal preference ( e.g. , n't want substitute addiction another ) necessity ( e.g. , ca n't afford ) . Buprenorphine discontinuation , even plan dose taper , often associate opiate withdrawal many patient express concern anticipate withdrawal symptom ; turn , many experience decrease self-efficacy remain abstinent process . There lack available treatment resource help patient manage buprenorphine discontinuation effectively . Therefore , propose harness advantage afford exist technology address important , unmet treatment need . We propose develop smartphone application ( call OFFBup ) help patient manage withdrawal buprenorphine taper detoxification . The component OFFBup application consistent Relapse Prevention Theory ( e.g. , cop withdrawal , increase self-efficacy ) operationalized follow tenet Self-Determination Theory ( i.e. , competence , autonomy , relatedness ) . After development OFFBup application , conduct small RCT 50 opioid dependent patient undergoing buprenorphine discontinuation determine feasibility preliminary efficacy OFFBup application . The OFFBup smartphone intervention resource patient access ( anytime anywhere ) educational information , emotional instrumental support , permit self-monitoring accompany feedback . If OFFBup application effective help patient undergoing buprenorphine detoxification decrease relapse illicit drug use , could integrate standard care office-based buprenorphine clinical practice , well methadone program , thereby substantial public health impact .</detailed_description>
