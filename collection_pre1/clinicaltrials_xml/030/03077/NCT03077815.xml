	<detailed_description>effect size diameter arteriovenous fistula hemodialysis patient treatment key smoothly . Arm vein intermittently grip arm movement , promote increase diameter arteriovenous fistula , enhance maturity fistula , effect lack empirical research . Objective : study , randomize control study , investigate systematic random arm vein pressure arm movement arteriovenous fistula hemodialysis patient improve maturity rate effectiveness diameter . Methods : prospective comparative study randomly assign . This study plan patient receive wrist artery vein access track 3 month operation , accord randomly divide three group , first group patient accept guidance systematic intermittent arm movement ; second group patient receive guidance system intermittent arm vein compression arm movement ; third group control group . Discussion : plan expect include 150 patient , receive instruction randomly with/without systemic venous pressure , with/without systemic movement . The plan design patient safety assessment effectiveness two activity primary end point secondary end point . This study offer clinician advise patient , effectively improve patient ' arteriovenous access mature speed diameter .
