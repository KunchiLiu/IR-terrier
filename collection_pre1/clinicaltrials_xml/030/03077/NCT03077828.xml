	<brief_summary>The purpose research study evaluate new drug Pembrolizumab combination chemotherapy , Relapsed/Refractory Hodgkin Lymphoma . The chemotherapy regimen call `` ICE '' include three drug : ifosfamide , carboplatin , etoposide . Pembrolizumab currently Food Drug Administration ( FDA ) approve treatment patient melanoma , lung cancer head neck cancer , yet approve treatment Relapsed/Refractory Hodgkin Lymphoma . The 'ICE ' regimen chemotherapy currently FDA approve treatment Relapsed/Refractory Hodgkin Lymphoma , yet investigate combination pembrolizumab disease . For patient relapse Hodgkin 's lymphoma , retreatment chemotherapy follow stem cell transplant recommend . We know obtain complete remission ( able detect disease scan ) important prior proceed stem cell transplant . Patients negative scan low chance disease come back high chance achieve long-term cure .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To determine complete response rate fludeoxyglucose- positron emission tomography/computed tomography ( FDG-PET/CT ) prior autologous hematopoietic stem cell transplant ( AHSCT ) combination pembrolizumab ifosfamide , carboplatin , etoposide ( ICE ) salvage chemotherapy relapsed/refractory Hodgkin lymphoma . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . To determine safety tolerability pembrolizumab combination salvage high-dose chemotherapy accord Common Terminology Criteria Adverse Events ( CTCAE ) version ( v ) 4.03 . II . To estimate event free survival ( EFS ) 2 year start treatment . III . To estimate overall survival ( OS ) 2 year start treatment . TERTIARY OBJECTIVES : I . To characterize PD-1 pathway specific expression correlate response . II . To characterize serum biomarkers immune inflammatory response treatment . III . To characterize level soluble PD-L1 related treatment pembrolizumab . IV . To characterize T-lymphocyte subset change treatment pembrolizumab . V. To investigate prevalence clinical correlation chromosome 9p24.1 mutation population . VI . To evaluate effect stem cell harvest follow treatment pembrolizumab . OUTLINE : Patients receive pembrolizumab intravenously ( IV ) 30 minute day 1 , etoposide IV 60 minute day 1-3 course 1-2 , carboplatin IV 60 minute day 2 course 1-2 , ifosfamide IV 24 hour day 2 course 1-2 . Pembrolizumab combination ICE chemotherapy repeat every 21 day 2 course , patient receive pembrolizumab monotherapy course 3 . After completion study treatment , patient follow 30 day , every 3 month 2 year .</detailed_description>
