	<brief_title>Pilot Study Regional Lung Ventilation</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Investigators hypothesize high resolution regional ventilation image ( HRVI ) base 4D-CT image correlate current low resolution state-of-the-art ( SPECT-CT ) , conventional way measure ventilation . HRVI may tool could widely use throughout radiation therapy community radiation oncologists routinely employ 4D-CT technology clinic . Investigators plan test hypothesis compare ventilation pattern SPECT-CT image HRVIs use DICE analysis . As SPECT ventilation image include standard care , study thus design pilot study . Based publish data , difference two method calculate regional ventilation lower 50 % ventilation volume expect standard deviation 0.1 . Therefore , 95 % confidence interval difference regional ventilation SPECT-CT 4D-CT pre-treatment would width 0.14 10 patient enrol small 0.10 20 patient register .</detailed_description>
