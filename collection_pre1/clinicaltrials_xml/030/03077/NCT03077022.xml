	<detailed_description>The treatment femoroacetabular impingement evolve last several year . As number arthroscopic hip operation rise last year , level controversy regard appropriate initial management . There many recent advance clinical diagnosis , advance image technique , improve indication surgery improve arthroscopic technique lead improved clinical outcome , effectiveness physical therapy remain unknown . A paucity evidence exist regard non-operative treatment FAI . Several insurance company require three six month physical therapy prior approval surgery . There single study objectively evaluate effectiveness physical therapy avoidance surgical intervention . The investigator plan evaluate use electronic outcome data collection system . The hypothesis majority patient see significant enough improvement physical therapy avoid surgery , especially subset patient sub spine impingement . The investigator plan prospectively collect data three year monitor outcome hip patient , especially treated physical therapy initial treatment potential avoidance surgery .</detailed_description>
