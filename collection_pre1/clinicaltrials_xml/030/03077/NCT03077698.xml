	<brief_summary>This open-label , multi-center , single-arm , two-period Phase 2 study . The study investigate efficacy Sodium Cridanimod conjunction progestin therapy population subject endometrial cancer , fail progestin monotherapy identify PrR negative . All patient must endometrial cancer PrR status determine archival sample Screening . The PrR status ( positive negative ) determine central laboratory IHC testing . There two treatment period follow-up period within study .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>An Endometrial Cancer Study Sodium Cridanimod Conjunction With Progestin Therapy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Treatment Period 1 ( Progestin Monotherapy ) : During Treatment Period 1 , subject determine PrR positive receive progestin monotherapy , megestrol acetate , 14 week . Subjects MRI CT scan 12 week progestin monotherapy , response treatment assess accord RECIST 1.1 criterion . All subject achieve disease control confirm tumor assessment Treatment Period 1 , ineligible enter Treatment Period 2 . These subject terminate trial treat accord local standard practice , may include continued progestin therapy . Subjects determine PrR negative Screening enroll Treatment Period 1 . These subject enroll directly Treatment Period 2 . Treatment Period 2 ( Combination Treatment ) : All subject determine PrR negative Screening receive least 4 week progestin monotherapy experience disease progression conclusion Treatment Period 1 enter Treatment Period 2 study . During Treatment Period 2 , subject receive Sodium Cridanimod combination continue progestin treatment , megestrol acetate . Subjects receive treatment disease progression define accord RECIST 1.1 criterion , response assessment perform 12-week interval . Follow-up Period : Once subject progress Treatment Period 2 , return Safety Follow-up Visit 4 week follow last treatment , continue follow additional 12-month period overall survival .</detailed_description>
