	<detailed_description>Objectives Aim 1 : Examine effect use cognitive reappraisal HRVb single session stress task performance . Investigators expect participant assigned practice cognitive reappraisal HRVb demonstrate great cognitive performance persistence stressful task laboratory visit contrast control group female smoker . Aim 2 : Examine effect use cognitive reappraisal HRVb short-term HRV , craving , affect . Investigators expect participant assigned practice cognitive reappraisal HRVb exhibit great HRV adaptation , demonstrate less reactive craving affect end visit participant randomize control group . III . Background Rationale Twenty percent death United States , 480,000 death year , attributable smoking ( USDHHS , 2014 ) . Cigarette smoking remain lead preventable cause death , 16.8 % adult currently smoke ( CDC , 2015 ) 16 million Americans live smoking-related disease ( USDHHS , 2014 ) . Smoking remain difficult quit ; even best available current treatment , quit attempt successful 35 % time le ( Garrison &amp; Dugan , 2009 ) . Smoking cessation relapse smoking far frequent path cigarette use smoker ( Garcia-Rodriguez et al. , 2013 ; Piasecki , 2006 ; Rafful et al. , 2013 ) . Stress implicate primary mechanism smoking relapse ( McKee et al. , 2003 ; Baer et al. , 1989 ; Cohen &amp; Lichtenstein , 1990 ) , often trigger increase negative affect ( Shiffman , 2005 ; Shiffman &amp; Waters , 2004 ) expose difficulty emotion regulation ( Farris , Zvolensky , &amp; Schmidt , 2015 ) . Evidence suggest stress prospectively predict smoke lapse ( Shiffman &amp; Waters , 2004 ) lapse triggered stress progress quickly relapse ( Shiffman et al. , 1996 ) , suggest deficit ability cope stress . In particular , woman 's smoke habit show trend different men 's : report show woman consume cigarette men ( Hammond , 2009 ; Ng et al. , 2014 ) less likely successfully quit smoke men ( Cepeda-Benito et al. , 2004 ; Perkins , 2001 ; Piper et al. , 2010 ) . While stress implicate relapse smoker , recent evidence indicate stress principal factor promote relapse smoking female , part woman appear strongly predispose stress response ( Torres &amp; O'Dell , 2016 ) . It therefore likely woman particular risk relapse due stress . Cognitive reappraisal demonstrate positive effect stress respond smoking-related outcome . Cognitive reappraisal reframing situation order influence one 's emotional response ( Gross , 1998 ) . Compared acceptance suppression , reappraisal measure Emotion Regulation Questionnaire ( ERQ ; Gross &amp; John , 2003 ) associate overall low crave negative affect crave induction stress task , well improve performance cognitive stress task ( Szasz , Szentagotai , &amp; Hofmann , 2012 ) . Fucito , Juliano , Toll ( 2010 ) find frequent reappraisal ERQ cross-sectionally associate smoke few cigarette . Recent evidence indicate reappraise stress-related arousal improve cognitive performance physiological reactivity ( Jamieson et al. , 2012 ; 2013 ) . Evidence thus far suggest use cognitive reappraisal particular self-regulation strategy may positive implication smoke behavior , include cigarette craving . HRVb also show promising evidence stress outcome . Utilizing behavioral self-regulation strategy heart rate variability biofeedback ( HRVb ) increase heart rate variability ( HRV ) show promise cop stress . HRV measure fluctuation mean heart rate , represent interaction sympathetic parasympathetic influence cardiac system ( Siepmann et al. , 2008 ) , serve biomarker autonomic nervous system function ( Zucker et al. , 2009 ) . HRV biofeedback training aim improve adaptability recovery fight flight situation increase HRV ( Gevirtz , 2013 ) . A single session HRVb improve adaptability stress measure improved cognitive performance lab-induced stress task ( Prinsloo et al. , 2010 ) . Several week HRVb practice show reduction substance craving ( Penzlin et al. , 2015 ; Eddie et al. , 2014 ) food craving ( Meule et al. , 2012 ) , although study date examine effect single session HRVb practice cigarette crave . This study assess whether combine cognitive behavioral approach improve stress respond smoker may especially efficacious . No study date examine examined potential additive benefit combine strategy . Combining cognitive behavioral self-regulation skill stress adaptation consistent cognitive-behavioral theory upon evidence-based treatment Axis I pathology develop , behavioral ( e.g. , HRVb ) cognitive ( e.g. , reappraisal ) approach self-management allow individual target internal external stimulus cop stress ( Rokke &amp; Rehm , 2001 ) . Beyond psychological effect stress , combination approach implication inform smoke cessation treatment , previously note current treatment substance addiction `` failing address important factor active sustain [ ] pathology , phenomena lead relapse ... mediate physiological well cognitive process '' ( Eddie , Vaschillo , Vaschillo , &amp; Lehrer , 2015 , p. 266 ) . In order improve cessation rate , cognitive reappraisal instruction HRVb incorporate low cost standard smoke cessation treatment , currently consist pharmacotherapy smoke cessation counsel accord Clinical Practice Guideline ( Fiore et al. , 2008 ) . HRVb technology range free smartphone application ( e.g. , Elite HRV ) sophisticate device available purchase online ( e.g . EmWave ) , make affordable feasible addition enhance current smoking cessation treatment . As study date explore effect HRVb single session smoke craving , study first address potential use relatively new technology short-term effect variable increase lapse risk , affect , crave , stress respond . This pilot study ass efficacy practice HRVb use device available general public previously test short-term effect crave . Combining HRVb train prior stressful task , follow cognitive reappraisal task , also never explore additive effect use either strategy alone . Both strategy would allow comprehensive approach manage stress responding , cognitively physiologically . Moreover , promise research self-regulatory strategy like cognitive reappraisal compare HRVb assess relative efficacy improve stress responding , assess relative efficacy improve smoking-related outcome . IV . Procedures 1 . Research Design This study single-session experimental trial use two intervention ( heart rate variability biofeedback cognitive reappraisal stress ) independent variable examine smoke craving , affect , heart rate variability dependent variable . The laboratory visit include baseline questionnaire , pre-test post-test measure smoke craving , affect , heart rate variability . Participants randomized practice intervention , control group undergo procedure exclude two intervention ( independent variable ) . 2 . Sample Participants consist 60 English-speaking female age 18-65 . As experimental study between-subjects within-subjects measurement , 60 participant sufficient power level .8 . 3 . Measurement/Instrumentation Objective Measures Heart rate variability measure one primary outcome measure study . As heart rate variability susceptible several environmental mental factor affect sympathetic nervous system , additional measure need take ensure validity heart rate variability data . As secondary measure , blood pressure breath carbon monoxide record . Specifically , follow measure use data collection , non-invasive : - Heart Rate Variability ( HRV ) . HRV examine use electrocardiogram ( ECG ) measurement Biopac Acqknowledge software . Electrodes place torso participant train , same-sex research staff member order detect heart rate , cardiac impedance , respiration rate . HRV data clean follow standard guideline ( Bernston et al. , 1990 ) . - Blood Pressure ( BP ) . An inflating arm cuff use detect blood pressure . - Respiration . To control compensatory breathing may lead hyperventilation reduce breathe rate biofeedback practice , respiration belt attach around participant ' ribcage monitor breathe rate tidal volume . 800mL spirobag calibration follow standard guideline , ask participant inflate deflate bag five time order obtain accurate estimate tidal volume . - Carbon monoxide ( CO ) . A standard carbon monoxide monitor use detect carbon monoxide level participant ' breath , objective measure cigarette smoking . This used eligibility purpose ( establish participant light smoker ) ensure participant abstinent smoke least 12 hour prior start study visit . Instrumentation One intervention examine study heart rate variability biofeedback , involve breathe slow steady rate receive feedback device one 's heart rate . The EmWave2® HRVb device ( HeartMath® , Boulder Creek , Colorado ) use HRVb practice serve additional measure HRV HRVb group . The EmWave2® device train user HRVb provide reading HRV , time elapse , vary level physiological coherence ( Edwards , 2014 ) . Repeated use device demonstrate clinically significant improvement performance test executive function associate emotional dysregulation ( O'neill &amp; Findlay , 2014 ) statistically significant increase measure general health mindfulness ( Edwards , 2014 ) . Baseline Self-Report Measures After consent procedure complete , participant direct website ( Qualtrics ) complete battery baseline self-report questionnaire . Qualtrics online-based , private research company specialize data collection . All data enter Qualtrics connect participant ' unique identify number associate identify information ( e.g. , name contact information ) . Participants fill self-report questionnaire assess demographic information , smoke history behavior , clinical symptom , emotion regulation , mental health-related index . ( See Attachment 7 study measure . ) Specifically , follow measure administer : - Demographics . General demographic information collect , include sex/gender , age , height , weight , hormonal contraceptive use , menstruation pattern , sexual orientation , race/ethnicity , education/career history , mental health history . Additionally , several item assess DSM-IV criterion bulimia nervosa include . - The Timeline Followback ( TLFB ) . The TLFB use quantify daily smoke behavior past 30 day , measure smoking heaviness . It demonstrate high test-retest reliability 30-day interval cigarette smoker ( Robinson et al. , 2014 ) . - The Fagerstrom Test Nicotine Dependence ( FTND ) . The FTND among widely use measure nicotine dependence , confirm reliability different setting population smoke cigarette ( Agrawal et al. , 2011 ; Fagerstrom , 2012 ) . - The Reasons Smoking Questionnaire ( RFS ) . The RFS use 30 year assess smoker ' motif smoke , demonstrate good convergent validity internal consistency ( Currie , 2004 ) adequate test-retest reliability ( Tate , Schmitz , &amp; Stanton , 1991 ) . - The Beck Depression Inventory-II ( BDI-II ) . The BDI-II 21-item measure depression demonstrate reliability stability ( Beck , Steer , et al. , 1988 ; Beck , Steer , &amp; Brown , 1996 ) . - The Emotion Regulation Questionnaire ( ERQ ) . The ERQ validate measure emotion regulation strategy good test-retest reliability ( Gross &amp; John , 2003 ) . - The Perceived Stress Scale ( PSS ) . The PSS widely use measure perception stress , design use community sample ( Cohen , Kamarck &amp; Mermelstein , 1983 ) . Higher PSS score associate failure quit smoking , great vulnerability depression , cold ( Cohen et al . 1988 ) . - The Generalized Anxiety Disorder-7 ( GAD-7 ) . The GAD-7 brief , validated measure generalize anxiety demonstrate reliability recommend clinical practice research ( Spitzer et al. , 2006 ) . - The Social Desirability Scale ( SDS ) . The SDS-16 measure social desirability , helpful study objective subjective outcome potential inconsistency . - The Difficulties Emotion Regulation Scale ( DERS ) . The DERS use measure problem emotion regulation within six domain : nonacceptance emotional response , difficulty engage goal-directed behavior , impulse control difficulty , lack emotion awareness , limited access emotion regulation strategy , lack emotion clarity . It show good internal consistency , validity , test-retest reliability ( Gratz &amp; Roemer , 2004 ) . - The Ruminative Responses Scale ( RRS ) . The RRS use measure degree individual respond ruminative way depress mood . It demonstrate strong inter-item consistency ( Treynor , Gonzalez , &amp; Nolen-Hoeksema , 2003 ) . - The Emotional Cascade Assessment Measure ( ECAM ) . The ECAM use measure individual respond upsetting situation , degree engage emotional cascade ( Selby &amp; Joiner , 2009 ) . This measure currently validate lab . - The Three-Factor Eating Questionnaire ( EQ ) . The EQ use assess overconsumption food response emotional , cognitive , social cue , food craving weight gain common concern smoker want quit . Several subscales show adequate test-retest reliability , disinhibition subscale predicts weight gain ( Cuntz et al. , 2001 ; Foster et al. , 1998 ) . The cognitive restraint subscale demonstrate construct validity ( Karlsson et al. , 2000 ) . The BDI-II include item measure individual 's suicidality . If point participant indicate feel significantly suicidal , message pop-up end survey , inform study staff individual 's risk high suicidality . Study staff perform brief assessment intervention determine professional attention require keep participant safe . ( See `` Protection Against Potential Risks '' Appendix 2 detailed information . ) Additional Self-Report Measures At multiple point throughout study , additional self-report measure use assess smoke crave affect , subjective outcome study . - The Positive Negative Affect Schedule ( PANAS ) 20-item measure affect demonstrate test-retest reliability , well good convergent divergent validity ( Watson , 2000 ) . - The Questionnaire Smoking Urges-Brief ( QSU-B ; Cox , Tiffany , &amp; Christen , 2001 ) 10-item measure smoking urges craving , high score indicate strong crave . Finally , several subscales Stress Appraisal Measure ( SAM ; Peacock &amp; Wong , 1989 ) use manipulation check cognitive restructuring intervention . The SAM demonstrate reliability good internal consistency subscales ( Carpenter , 2016 ) . Computer Stress Tasks Participants first ten minute complete Mirror Tracing Task ( MTT ; Quinn , Brandon , &amp; Copeland , 1996 ) measure persistence stressful task , associate nicotine dependence treatment outcome ( Brandon et al. , 2003 ) distinguish cigarette smoker non-smokers ( Quinn et al. , 1996 ) . The MTT involve trace three shape display computer screen , use mouse computer screen . A buzz sound indicate whether shape trace incorrectly . As primary purpose task study induce stress , participant instruct complete task without option termination ten minute . Second , participant complete validate Montreal Imaging Stress Task ( MIST ; Dedovic et al. , 2005 ) involve mental arithmetic negative feedback investigator , female member study staff . The MIST specifically design elicit psychosocial stress participant movement restrict demonstrated effect biological index stress , include cortisol ( Dedovic et al. , 2005 ) brain area associate limbic system ( Dedovic et al. , 2009 ) HPA axis ( Zschucke et al. , 2015 ) . Third , computerize Stroop task ( Stroop , 1935 ) implement induce mental stress . The Stoop task well-known validated measure mental stress cognitive performance involve read word identify color computer screen . e. Detailed study procedure Interested participant complete phone interview eligibility . Participants refer Tobacco Dependence Program provide breath carbon monoxide sample meeting eligibility criterion , least 15ppm . Participants recruit source ask provide breath sample 5-minute visit laboratory order confirm smoking status least one day prior schedule study visit . Eligible participant schedule 2.5-hour visit ask refrain alcohol , tobacco , e-cigarette use 12 hour prior appointment time . The study visit consist breath CO test confirm tobacco abstinence past 12 hour ( indicated breath CO level less 10ppm . Evidence show daily smoker yet smoke first cigarette day exhibit expire CO level 9 11ppm ( Adan , Prat , &amp; Sanchez-Turet , 2004 ) . Interested participant CO-eligible reschedule another study visit day . CO confirmation study eligibility follow informed consent process , finally completion baseline questionnaire packet ( detail ) . They also instrument BioPac psychophysiology station train female study staff member . They ask conduct baseline psychophysiological assessment 10 minute , do order provide comparison effect intervention stress task . Participants randomize one two condition , block age level motivation quit smoke next 30 day . Participants age 18-39 randomize separately participant age 40-65 . Blocking randomization age group reduce age confounds within sample adult woman , age correlate smoke behavior heart rate variability ( Zhang , 2007 ) . Motivation quit smoke next 30 day , scale 1-10 , assessed initial phone interview block randomization level motivation quit ( 1-5 versus 6-10 ) . Participants randomly assign one two study condition reflect presence absence intervention : 1 ) HRVb cognitive reappraisal instruction , 2 ) Sitting quietly engage neutral control task reappraisal instruction . HRVb involve pace breathe guide move light portable biofeedback device ( describe ) . The neutral control task involve press computer key whenever shape appear computer screen , occur approximately every minute . To maintain neutral control condition 30 minute , neutral nature video supplement task prevent significant participant boredom frustration . Cognitive reappraisal instruction explain function stress response adaptation effectively overcome challenge , follow example Jamieson , Nock , Mendes ( 2012 ) . Remaining study visit procedure detailed Figure 1 . Debriefing Following completion computer task , 15 minute recovery period , removal psychophysiological recording equipment , participant debrief study purpose . They also provide Debriefing/Resources Sheet information contact information mental health . Participants compensated participation . The study staff member review Resources Sheet individual provide participant physical copy take home . The Resource Sheet ( attachment 9 ) include information resource specific Rutgers central New Jersey . Protections Against Potential Risks Every effort make minimize risk associate participation . Our procedure generally non-invasive pose little physical risk participant . As , risk involve participation study minor , though concern . 1 . Questionnaires . Some content questionnaire propose project may distress participant answer ( e.g . question substance use , self-injury , etc . ) , although risk use likely uncommon measure commonly use previous study without incident . Though distress answer question self-report measure extremely likely , participant inform require answer question wish answer , may end participation study time . 2 . Suicide Risk . Although risk suicidal participant study relatively low , imperative participant identify high suicide risk , answer BDI-II study visit , approach appropriate evaluation intervention procedure . Participants whose risk determine serious ( defined endorsement suicide plan preparation , imminent suicidal intent ) refer appropriate mental health provider suicidal crisis intervention . If participant endorses imminent suicide risk assessment , voluntarily escort Rutgers University Counseling Center assessment . If necessary , Rutgers Campus Police contact transport participant mental health assessment , particularly case imminent suicide risk indicate participant refuse undergo additional screening . The suicide risk assessment procedure , well appropriate action take accord suicide risk describe Appendix 2 . These potential action also describe informed consent form participant aware prior clinical interview . In case participant exhibit suicidal ideation , assessor contact Dr. Selby ensure appropriate safety measure take prior participant leave lab . Importantly , research find conduct suicide risk assessment people suicidal cause experience suicidality , furthermore experience suicidal ideation frequently report feel well follow suicide risk assessment . This assessment approach use successfully previous research protect human subject potentially experience suicidal ideation . 3 . Confidentiality . Procedures complete participant throughout project period . There minimal risk confidential information could breach . The identify information participant include survey self-report questionnaire file consent form ( in-person participant ) . Confidentiality maintain report result . The information gather use scientific purpose report aggregate form group total average . All physical data form ( in-person participant ) keep lock file cabinet primary investigator 's lab . All personnel carefully train investigator regard collection storage sensitive information . Data enter statistical database keep investigator ' lab space , keep locked space investigator authorize personnel access . All electronic data download participant survey store secure server investigator 's lab ( detail describe ) . 4 . Data Security . Participants provide electronic data via online survey part participation laboratory . There small risk data could compromise . Each questionnaire survey electronic data set number , in-person informed consent form attach sheet contain number , remove data collection complete . f. Consent Procedures Participants provide consent form give time read , study explain trained , CITI-certified study staff member also answer participant ' question . Participants initial page consent form signing date consent form study staff member witness . A dated signed copy give participant . g. Internal Validity Threats internal validity study consider addressed inclusionary exclusionary criterion study . Furthermore , participant adult woman reduce age gender confound HRV data , randomization study condition block age reduce confounds HRV measurement . Additionally , blood pressure record assess potential HRV confounds . During intervention , biofeedback device serve secondary measure HRV manipulation check . Cognitive reappraisal instruction include practice exercise question ensure understand intervention , subscales Stress Appraisal Measure utilized manipulation check . Self-report measure select validity appropriateness study sample . Furthermore , stress task specifically select effect different facet stress , include social stress , order capture potential stressor face real-life smoker lead relapse . h. Data Analysis In order examine effect practice cognitive reappraisal HRVb single laboratory session stress task performance , investigator examine persistence MTT performance Stroop task separately . Persistence MTT measure via time completion termination task outcome measure . Reaction time response accuracy ( average individual ) examine outcome measure Stroop task . Generalized estimated equation analyse examine effect two experimental manipulation ( HRVb cognitive reappraisal ) covariates include age , average daily cigarette smoke , Body Mass Index ( calculate demographic information baseline questionnaire ) , demographic variable three outcome measure MTT Stroop task . In order examine effect practice cognitive reappraisal HRVb short-term HRV , craving , affect , investigator first clean HRV data follow standard guideline ( Bernston et al. , 1990 ) . Within-subject change HRV assess via change baseline HRV measurement average . Change score HRV , craving , affect explore between-group difference use 2x2 analysis variance . Multiple regression analysis examine effect cognitive reappraisal HRVb change HRV , craving , affect , age , average daily cigarette smoke , Body Mass Index , demographic variable enter covariates . Second , investigator explore change time multiple assessment HRV , craving , affect examine within-subject change time . Within-subject data analysis conduct Hierarchical Linear Modeling ( HLM ) Version 7 software ( Raudenbush et al. , 2011 ) account nesting structure data well missingness data , allow analysis random intercept . Multilevel model include covariates mention addition experimental manipulation cognitive reappraisal HRVb .</detailed_description>
