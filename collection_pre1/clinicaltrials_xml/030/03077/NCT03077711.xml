	<brief_summary>Several method available use prevention recurrent urinary tract infection ( UTIs ) past decade . These method include suppressive antibiotic , estrogen cream , methenamine hippurate , d-mannose , cranberry , probiotic , vitamin C. Of , majority literature favor use suppressive antibiotic prevent UTIs . However , data 10 year old . Increasing use antibiotic year lead increase resistance bacteria . In addition , long-term antibiotic use several adverse effect , life-threatening . There recent literature evaluate use several alternative suppressive antibiotic mixed result . A comparative study efficacy methenamine hippurate suppressive antibiotic lack current literature . Several early partly-randomized trial do methenamine hippurate show promising result , recent 1987 . The primary objective prospective , randomize study determine whether significant difference prevention recurrent UTIs give either methenamine hippurate daily suppressive antibiotic . The secondary objective study determine well patient able tolerate medication adverse effect observe give 1 year time period . The long-term goal study find alternative use suppressive antibiotic , potentially low adverse effect profile less danger long term antibiotic use . Finding alternative suppressive antibiotic would also tackle issue antibiotic resistance .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Methenamine Hippurate Versus Trimethoprim Prevention Recurrent UTIs</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Hypothesis : The hypothesis study group take trimethoprim low recurrence rate take methenamine hippurate base literature . The investigator aim identify degree difference whether acceptable difference give great degree antibiotic resistance . Objectives : The primary objective prospective , randomize study determine whether significant difference prevention recurrent UTIs give either methenamine hippurate daily suppressive antibiotic independent vaginal estrogen use . The secondary objective study determine well patient able tolerate medication adverse effect observe 1 year time period . Specific Aims : 1 . Identify differential impact prevention recurrent UTIs treat either trimethoprim methenamine hippurate 6 12 month period . 2 . Identify adverse reaction group . 3 . Determine whether estrogen additive effect trimethoprim methenamine hippurate post-menopausal woman . 4 . Identify well tolerate study medication whether size pill frequency take prevents patient continue therapy .</detailed_description>
