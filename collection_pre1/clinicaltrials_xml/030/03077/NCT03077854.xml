	<brief_summary>Thoracic radiotherapy ( TRT ) standard curative treatment locally advance , unresectable non-small cell lung cancer ( NSCLC ) limit stage small cell lung cancer ( SCLC ) . TRT recognize cause moderate severe lung injury substantial portion patient . Conventional standard curative TRT planning technique minimize radiation dose anatomical lung , without adaption regional pulmonary function variation . The principal investigator hypothesize preferential avoidance functional lung curative TRT may decrease risk pulmonary toxicity . Functional lung region identify use four- dimensional compute tomography ventilation image . This randomized , single-blind trial comprehensively assess impact functional lung avoidance pulmonary toxicity , quality life , clinical outcome patient receive curative TRT locally advance NSCLC SCLC .</brief_summary>
