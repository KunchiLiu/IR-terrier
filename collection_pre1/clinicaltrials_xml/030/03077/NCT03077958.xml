	<brief_title>Total Knee Replacement With Attune vs. Press Fit Condylar ( PFC ) Sigma .</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The Attune total knee replacement recently develop implant intention improve outcome procedure . One primary aim improve kinematics knee order closely mimic normal knee . Thereby patient expect experience improve function , good stability less pain activity . So far randomized study demonstrate potential superior performance compare predecessor , PFC Sigma TKR . This study aim evaluate clinical outcome knee kinematics Attune knee use recognize clinical outcome parameter dynamic radiostereometry . The PFC sigma knee use control . 100 knee primary osteoarthritis schedule total knee replacement ( TKR ) recruit wait list . The patient randomize become operated Attune PFC total knee arthroplasty . Randomization do use envelope . Patients participate one knee . Surgical procedure : The operation do accord routine without use bloodless field . Local analgesia infiltrate periarticulary operation . Cemented fixation use case . So-called `` fast-track '' principle apply Groups . Patients follow five year .</detailed_description>
