	<brief_title>Trial NanoPac Subjects With Locally Advanced Pancreatic Adenocarcinoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>In open-label , dose-escalating , Phase IIa trial , subject locally advanced pancreatic adenocarcinoma locate tail body pancreas receive intratumoral ( ITU ) NanoPac ( Sterile Nanoparticulate Paclitaxel ) via endoscopic ultrasound-guided direct injection . Subjects enrol sequential cohort NanoPac escalate dos , volume base 20 % calculated tumor volume ( maximum injection volume 5 mL per subject ) . Each cohort three subject , cohort enrol sequentially start low concentration . Following DSMB review cohort data , next cohort may begin enrol , additional three subject current dose may enrol , first dose provide adequate safety tolerability study may halt . The dose determine suitable evaluation , define high dose acceptable safety tolerability profile determine Data Safety Monitoring Board ( DSMB ) , enroll additional subject provide cohort 12 subject dose level . Plasma sample take various time point day NanoPac injection well study visit , characterize pharmacokinetics ( PK ) intratumoral NanoPac . Subjects follow three month NanoPac injection safety , overall survival ( OS ) , progression-free survival ( PFS ) , CA-19-9 level , carcinoembryonic antigen ( CEA ) level , reduction pain , tumor response therapy ( show imaging ) . A follow-up visit may conduct six month , applicable .</detailed_description>
