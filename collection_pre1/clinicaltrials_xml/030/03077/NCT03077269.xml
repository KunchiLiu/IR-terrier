	<detailed_description>Trauma injury lead cause death people 1-44 year old US . Burn injury particularly debilitate form trauma . In U.S. incidence burn injury estimate great 2 million case per year . Burns account ~ 300,000 death worldwide every year . In 1996 , cost care burn patient U.S. estimate $ 573 million per year . Notably , 20-40 % trauma death occur hospital admission involve massive bleeding . Hemorrhage second common cause early in-hospital mortality account large portion trauma death occur within first 24 hour . Resuscitation dramatically change last decade . Nowadays , substitute normal saline resuscitate fluid blood product . This early administration blood product resuscitation refer damage control resuscitation ( DCR ) . The goal DCR prevent immediately correct trauma associate coagulopathy . DCR initially practice military balance ratio FFP : platelet : RBCs 1:1:1 employ . DCR result improved outcome military well civilian trauma set compare previous resuscitation pattern . Despite early use 1:1:1 ratio , 1:1:2 ratio also become commonly use . Thus , Pragmatic , Randomized Optimal Platelet Plasma Ratios ( PROPPR ) study do investigate best ratio product use resuscitation . The PROPPR study find difference mortality 1:1:1 1:1:2 group 24 hour 30 day . Additionally , difference complication two group . Notably , exsanguination significantly decrease 1:1:1 group patient 1:1:1 group reach hemostasis . The Prospective Observational Multicenter Major Trauma Transfusion ( PROMMTT ) study show early transfusion ( within minute arrive hospital ) associate improved 6-hour survival . Furthermore , patient increase plasma RBC ratio ( &gt; 1:2 ) find improved 30-day survival compare patient receive low plasma RBC ratio ( &lt; 1:2 ) . Notably , 1-day 30-day survival find increased patient receive high ratio platelet RBCs . Delayed balance transfusion ratio protective effect receive plasma early . To date study effect hemorrhage burn soft tissue excision optimal blood product resuscitation . It unclear whether DCR optimal burn patient . Moreover , unknown exactly happen burn patient respect coagulation , platelet function , microparticles ( MPs ) . Patients burn soft tissue injury typically considerable bleed surgery . Intraoperative blood loss estimate 9.2 % blood volume every 1 % total body surface area ( TBSA ) burn excise adult . In child undergo burn excision , blood loss estimate 2 % blood volume every 1 % TBSA excise extremity trunk 5 % blood volume 1 % TBSA excise face . Moreover , early complete excision graft major burn show decrease transfusion , infection , mortality child . Interestingly , many burn surgeon anecdotally report burn patient develop microvascular bleeding surgery . This phenomenon may indicative development coagulopathy . There several prospective study look perioperative coagulation status burn patient . These study show coagulation protein ( FV , FVIII , FIX , fibrinogen ) decrease surgery . Notably , case , factor level still within `` normal '' reference range . FVIII fibrinogen acute phase reactant elevate burn patient preoperatively . These study perform adoption DCR . Additionally , several study show antithrombin , protein S , protein C ( natural anticoagulant ) level decrease burn injury . A recent study Palmieri et al . look compare transfusion ratio 1:1 RBCs : FFP 4:1 RBCs : FFP child &gt; 20 % TBSA burn . In study 16 child , find trend toward increased length stay ( LOS ) , peak PELOD score ( measure organ dysfunction ) , increase time wound healing , increased infection rate 4:1 group ; however , difference statistically significant . Notably , find 1 : 1 ratio safe burn patient 1:1 ratio also less expensive ( $ 26,635 versus $ 34,485 ) . A recent study Pidcoke et al . show current blood product resuscitation burn soft tissue excision hemostatic . Thus , effect use balance resuscitation ratio blood product include platelet burn patient well study . In general , platelet dysfunction believe play role development trauma associate coagulopathy ( TAC ) . The effect burn patient ' platelet count activity unknown . Upon hospital admission , burn patient typically normal platelet count . By day 3-5 , patient ' platelet count usually drop , especially burn large TBSA . In severe burn patient , platelet mediator , platelet factor 4 ( PF4 ) thromboxane B2 ( TxB2 ) , find elevate . This think attributable platelet activation consumption . Thus , investigation effect burn platelet offer insight transfusion need burn patient . In study do Lu et al . development TAC burn patient , TAC define INR ≥ 1.3 , aPTT ≥ 1.5 time mean normal limit , normal platelet count , patient present TAC upon admission . Only change INR aPTT value observe time . Further study need ; however , author may underdiagnosed TAC burn patient base upon definition TAC . It likely platelet MPs play significant role development TAC well bleed see burn patient excision graft . MPs small vesicle ( &lt; 1 µm ) resemble parent cell term similar surface protein membrane lipid . Interestingly , blood cell release MPs . The abundant MPs blood platelet MPs ( PMPs ) . PMPs find 50- 100-fold high procoagulant activity activate whole platelet . PMPs form via five mechanism : 1 ) platelet activation subsequent shed membrane fragment , 2 ) complement mediate membrane attack , 3 ) high shear force , 4 ) senescence apoptosis platelet megakaryocytes , 5 ) platelet cytoskeletal abnormality . In PROMMTT study , patient find increased level MPs derive endothelial cell , RBCs , leukocytes well increased level tissue factor bear MPs ( TF-MPs ) . Notably , coagulopathic trauma patient find much low level PMPs , TF-MPs , thrombin generation addition bleed increased mortality . To understand role PMPs , Matijevic et al . examine PMPs plasma . They compare thaw plasma day 5 freshly thaw fresh frozen plasma ( FFP ) day 0 . They find majority MPs indeed PMPs day 5 plasma 50 % reduction MPs 29 % decrease procoagulant activity . A recent prospective observational study trauma patient find patient low level phosphatidylserine ( PS ) positive PMPs impair clot formation likely receive RBC transfusion first 24 hour follow injury . These study suggest PMPs may play important previously overlook role TAC . The role MPs burn patient unknown . It likely MPs play significant overlooked role coagulation development coagulopathies burn patient . Further study need evaluate role MPs particularly number , identity , size , contribution coagulation burn patient . Following surgery burn excision grafting , patient remain hospitalized various lengths time . This often depend upon TBSA burn , smoke inhalation , infectious complication , complicate medical problem . Based upon previous study , burn patient think become hypercoagulable . This hypercoagulable state attribute increased level clot factor ( FV , FVIII ) , platelet , fibrinogen , decrease level antithrombin , protein S , protein C. Notably , incidence deep vein thrombosis ( DVT ) pulmonary embolism ( PE ) burn patient low . A study use National Burn Repository database find rate venous thromboembolism ( VTE ) 0.61 % . Another study find rate 0.25 % DVT 0.05 % PE . Yet another study use duplex ultrasonography screen burn patient DVT admission discharge find prevalence 6.1 % . Thus , rate VTE burn patient think much high previously expect due asymptomatic DVTs well difficulty diagnose DVTs population due overlap symptom DVTs burn ( ex . extremity swell ) . There several publish report VTE burn patient . Recently , Van Haren et al . study coagulation status 24 burn patient course hospital stay use thromboelastography ( TEG ) standard laboratory coagulation test . Notably , repeat sample take one week admission find hypercoagulable ( decreased R K time , increase α angle increase MA ) level fibrinogen , protein S , protein C , antithrombin find increase . Two patient hypercoagulable ( TEG show decreased R time ) admission find later develop VTE despite anticoagulation therapy . Surprisingly , prophylactic use anticoagulation overall common burn patient . A survey burn center show one quarter USA center use form VTE prophylaxis . Thus , additional study need explore coagulation status various coagulation anticoagulation factor level burn patient throughout hospital course . Only understand physiologically take place patient offer best therapeutic treatment ( anticoagulation versus anticoagulation , , one ? ) . The goal propose study understand physiologic change occur initially burn patient coagulation status burn patient change time . In addition change coagulation anticoagulation protein , study focus effect burn platelet MPs . We also examine MP population characterize identity , size , PS content MPs elucidate effect coagulation parameter well inflammation .</detailed_description>
