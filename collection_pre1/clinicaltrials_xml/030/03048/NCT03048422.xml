	<brief_title>Evaluating Efficacy Safety Dolutegravir-Containing Versus Efavirenz-Containing Antiretroviral Therapy Regimens HIV-1-Infected Pregnant Women Their Infants</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This study compare virologic efficacy safety three ARV regimens HIV-1-infected pregnant woman : dolutegravir ( DTG ) plus emtricitabine/tenofovir alafenamide ( FTC/TAF ) , DTG plus emtricitabine/tenofovir disoproxil fumarate ( FTC/TDF ) , efavirenz/emtricitabine/tenofovir disoproxil fumarate ( EFV/FTC/TDF ) . The study also compare safety regimens infant . At study entry , mother randomly assign either receive DTG plus FTC/TAF ( Arm 1 ) , DTG plus FTC/TDF ( Arm 2 ) , EFV/FTC/TDF ( Arm 3 ) pregnancy , delivery , 50 week postpartum . Mothers complete study visit study entry every four week pregnancy . Study visit mother infant occur delivery 6 , 14 , 26 , 38 , 50 week postpartum . Visits mother infant include physical examination blood collection . Select study visit may include breast milk collection mother breast feed , hair urine collection , ultrasound scan , , subset participant , dual energy x-ray absorptiometry ( DXA ) scan mother infant .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Mother least 18 year age willing able provide write informed consent infant 's participation study Mother confirm HIV1 infection base documented test two sample collect different time point : Sample # 1 may test use follow : Two rapid antibody test different manufacturer base different principle epitopes One enzyme immunoassay ( EIA ) OR Western blot OR immunofluorescence assay OR chemiluminescence assay One HIV DNA polymerase chain reaction ( PCR ) One quantitative HIV RNA PCR ( limit detection assay ) One qualitative HIV RNA PCR One total HIV nucleic acid test Sample # 2 may test use follow : One rapid antibody test . If option use combination two rapid test Sample # 1 , least one three rapid test must FDAapproved third rapid test must third manufacturer base third principle epitope . One EIA OR Western blot OR immunofluorescence assay OR chemiluminescence assay One HIV DNA PCR One quantitative HIV RNA PCR ( limit detection assay ) One qualitative HIV RNA PCR One total HIV nucleic acid test . See protocol information inclusion criterion . At screen , mother ARTnaive , define receive prior ART ARVs receive prior pregnancy prior period breastfeed ( i.e. , receipt single , dual , triple ARV regimen prior timelimited period pregnancy breastfeed permit ) . Receipt 14 day ARVs current pregnancy permit prior study entry initiation ARVs current pregnancy delay study screen period . Note : Nonstudy ART may initiate current pregnancy prior initiation study screen process . For eligible participant , enrollment must occur within 14 day nonstudy ART initiation . Receipt ARVs prior pregnancy prior period breastfeeding must conclude least six month prior study entry . See protocol information inclusion criterion . At screen , mother follow laboratory test result ( base testing sample collect within 14 day prior study entry ) : Grade 1 low ( less 2.5 time upper limit normal [ ULN ] ) alanine aminotransferase ( ALT ) aspartate aminotransferase ( AST ) Grade 2 low ( less equal 1.8 time ULN ) creatinine Grade 2 low ( great equal 60 mL/min ) estimate creatinine clearance ( CrCl ; CockcroftGault formula ) . See protocol information inclusion criterion . At screen study entry , evidence multiple gestation fetal anomaly , assess best available method At study entry , gestational age 1428 week , define great 13 week plus six day less 28 complete week gestation , estimate best available method . Note : For inclusion criterion previous inclusion criterion , fetal ultrasound prefer required purpose eligibility determination . If ultrasound perform study screening period ( prior study entry ) , must perform within 14 day study entry . As explained protocol , enrol participant withdrawn study base ultrasound finding obtain study entry . At study entry , mother expect remain geographic area study site pregnancy 50 week postpartum Mother currently incarcerate involuntarily confine medical facility Mother currently receive : A psychoactive medication treatment psychiatric illness Treatment active tuberculosis Treatment active hepatitis C infection Mother expect require treatment interferon and/or ribavirin hepatitis C infection study followup period Mother history follow , determine site investigator designee base maternal report available medical record : Hypersensitivity clinically significant adverse reaction ARVs include three study drug regimen ( ever ) Clinically significant heart disease and/or know prolonged correct QT ( QTc ) interval ( ever ) Suicidal ideation attempt ( ever ) Zika virus infection , diagnose suspect , current pregnancy Receipt antiretroviral medication within six month prior study entry , exception receipt 14 day ARVs current pregnancy Receipt prohibit medication within 14 day prior study entry ( see protocol information ) Clinically significant acute illness require systemic treatment and/or hospitalization within 14 day prior study entry Unstable liver disease ( define presence ascites , encephalopathy , coagulopathy , hypoalbuminemia , esophageal gastric varix , persistent jaundice ) know biliary abnormality ( exception Gilbert 's syndrome asymptomatic gallstone ) within 14 day prior study entry Mother fetus condition , opinion site investigator designee , would make participation study unsafe , complicate interpretation study outcome data , otherwise interfere achieve study objective</criteria>
