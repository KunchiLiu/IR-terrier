	<brief_summary>Transcriptomics study RNA express specific condition . Transcriptomic analyse lesional skin biopsy useful way track patient respond drug separate drug responder non-responders . However , biopsy painful , carry risk bleeding infection scar . A non-invasive approach , tape-harvesting , obtain transcriptomic data psoriatic skin would increase capability monitor patient treatment potentially help u predict drug effective sooner . However , know well tape-harvesting capture transcriptomic change occur psoriatic skin . The purpose study address well tape-harvesting capture transcriptomic change occur psoriatic skin .</brief_summary>
