	<brief_summary>The overall goal study examine relationship chronic inflammation threat reward sensitivity , determine effect acute inflammation threat sensitivity , individual without moderate severe PTSD symptom . The investigator first conduct observational study examine relationship chronic inflammation neural behavioral measure threat sensitivity . Then , investigator conduct randomize , double-blind , placebo-controlled , between-subjects study examine effect acute inflammation neural behavioral measure threat sensitivity .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Inflammation Threat Sensitivity PTSD</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Posttraumatic stress disorder ( PTSD ) disable chronic psychiatric disorder affect 8 % population . New treatment PTSD symptom desperately need current pharmacologic behavioral treatment PTSD inadequate low uptake . Accumulating evidence support elevate inflammation new potential treatment target PTSD . Inflammation increase PTSD , promote threat sensitivity , core mechanism underlie several PTSD symptom . Two major gap knowledge prevent progress towards effective anti- inflammatory treatment PTSD symptom . First , researcher know little relationship chronic inflammation exaggerate threat sensitivity . Second , study directly examine effect acute inflammation neural behavioral measure threat sensitivity PTSD . The objective study uncover effect chronic acute inflammation neural mechanism behavioral measure threat sensitivity individual without PTSD symptom . The central hypothesis chronic acute inflammation associate exaggerated threat sensitivity overall , particularly strong relationship PTSD . The scientific rationale establish link elevate inflammation threat sensitivity observational experimental study individual without PTSD symptom drive progress towards target approach identify effective anti- inflammatory treatment PTSD symptom . In particular , work potential identify target clinical trial anti-inflammatory intervention PTSD . Guided preliminary data , hypothesis test pursue two specific aim : 1 ) Examine association chronic inflammation threat sensitivity ; 2 ) Determine effect acute inflammatory challenge threat sensitivity . To achieve aim , 40 participant moderate severe PTSD symptom 40 age- body mass index-matched trauma-exposed participant history PTSD recruit . The investigator assess chronic resting level inflammation ( Aim 1 ) randomize participant placebo inflammatory challenge use polysaccharide typhoid vaccine ( i.e. , endotoxin ) ( Aim 2 ) use validate functional MRI paradigm behavioral task assess threat sensitivity .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>All Subjects : Veterans age 3060 . PTSD Subjects : Positive current chronic moderate severe PTSD symptom least three month duration index Clinically Administered PTSD Scale DSM 5 ( CAPS5 ) . Control Subjects : Negative lifetime PTSD . Negative lifetime diagnosis Mood Disorders , Generalized Anxiety Disorder , ObsessiveCompulsive Disorder Panic Disorder . All Subjects : Lifetime history psychiatric disorder psychotic feature , bipolar disorder , panic disorder , obsessivecompulsive disorder , alcohol substance dependence , history alcohol substance abuse within past 2 year . Currently expose recurrent trauma expose traumatic event within past 3 month . Diagnosis neurologic disorder , systemic illness affect central nervous system function , and/or anemia . Prominent suicidal homicidal ideation . Current plan ongoing use medication impact inflammation immune function , use medication past 6 month . Subjects currently receive serotonin reuptake inhibitor ( SSRIs ) , benzodiazepine benzodiazepine receptor agonist , anticonvulsant , atypical antipsychotic medication , antidepressant medication include trazodone . Termination SSRIs , benzodiazepine benzodiazepine receptor agonist , anticonvulsant , atypical antipsychotic medication , antidepressant medication include trazodone last month plan start medication course study . Contraindications Magnetic Resonance Imaging ( MRI ) , include claustrophobia severe enough prevent MRI examination presence ferrometallic object body would interfere MR examination and/or cause safety risk ( e.g. , pace maker , implant stimulators , pump ) . Contraindications typhoid vaccine , include acute febrile illness within past two week , disorder characterize deficiency ability mount humoral cellmediated immune response , use antimalarial medication past six month , antibiotic past three month , history hypersensitivity typhoid vaccine vaccine , previous immunization wholecell typhoid live , oral typhoid vaccine , vaccination polysaccharide version typhoid vaccine within past 3 year , coagulation disorder thrombocytopenia . Conditions use substance may associate inflammation independent trauma PTSD , include chronic physical disease . History neurologic disorder , traumatic brain injury ( TBI ) , brain tumor , brain hemorrhage , head injury loss consciousness . Women currently , plan become , pregnant study . The investigator exclude PTSD patient receive psychotherapy , apply follow criterion : patient must treatment 6 month , meet symptomatic criterion inclusion , plan discontinue treatment course study .</criteria>
