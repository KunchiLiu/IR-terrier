	<brief_summary>Immediate potent inhibition platelet function critical prevention periprocedural ischemic event occurrence high risk N-ST segment elevation myocardial infarction ( NSTEMI ) patient undergo percutaneous coronary intervention ( PCI ) . Currently , dual antiplatelet therapy aspirin oral P2Y12 receptor blocker ( load dos ) widely use PCI . However , immediate , potent reversible inhibition platelet aggregation possible even new oral agent , prasugrel ticagrelor . Therefore , intravenously administer GPIIb/IIIa receptor inhibitor ( tirofiban ) P2Y12 receptor blocker ( cangrelor ) fast onset offset action provide desire antiplatelet effect set PCI . This study measure compare anti-platelet effect Tirofiban Cangrelor patient present N-STEMI undergoing PCI .</brief_summary>
