	<brief_summary>The Christie NHS Foundation Trust one seven site worldwide within Atlantic consortium develop Elekta MR-Linac ( MRL ) prior commercial release end 2017 . The MRL allow MR image patient acquire , follow radiotherapy ( RT ) . One area The Christie take lead within consortium application MRL lung image treatment , area MRI hardly use . MRI scan provide great soft tissue contrast CT scan aid accurate delineation organ risk ( OAR ) tumour target volume MRL routine treatment . In addition , MRI provide real time image aid accurate motion characterisation volume . The addition functional diffusion weight imaging ( DWI ) also proven useful discrimination malignant benign lesion ; lymph node detection differentiation tumour atelectasis . Auto-contouring potential speed workflows various point clinical pathway . This may inter-patient contour propagation use pre-treatment plan creation , may online offline adaptive workflow propagate contour image acquire treatment progress . In collaboration industry investigator test algorithms image retrospectively . In addition , investigator would also like evaluate patient ' experience CT MRI scan determine scan method prefer . Other study explore patient experience MRI compare CT lung cancer patient population .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Participants study two MRI scan addition CT treatment planning scan , standard care cone beam CT scan treatment , also standard care . One MR scan close start treatment approximately 2 week start radiotherapy treatment . If patient PET scan within 4 week 1st MR scan PET image also use target volume delineation . If PET scan &gt; 4 week old , repeat per standard practice . The MRI protocol include 60 minute scan include anatomical , respiratory dynamic functional diffusion weight imaging ( DWI ) . The patient set accord treatment position MR scanner , use flat couch . The MR scan use clinical decision making . Clinicians contour organ risk ( OARs ) target volume CT ( guide PET available ) MRI scan contour compare determine usefulness MRI radiotherapy treatment planning . The contoured data set fully anonymised , use house share Elekta assist development automatic contouring / tumour track software , compare CT cone beam CT ( CBCT ) tracking ( standard care ) MR MR tracking ( experimental ) . To assess experience MRI CT , participant ask complete baseline self-report questionnaire additional questionnaire MRI CT scan . A small sample participant also invite participate semi-structured interview explore experience great depth .</detailed_description>
