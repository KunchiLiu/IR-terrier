	<detailed_description>This study include 8 vent dependent subject comparable diagnosis nutritional level . Of subject select , 4 subject place Freedom Beds 4 place standard hospital bed period le 6 month . A waiver inform consent require prior bed placement data collection . Consented subject primary secondary diagnosis record , pressure map supine 30-degree elevation , assessment ventilator / oxygen support measure , oxygenation level , nutrition level , estimate cardiac condition . Subjects receive daily skin assessment treatment prescribe attend physician weekly measurement report value . Subjects continue reach one study endpoint : 1 ) discharge vent unit , 2 ) withdrawal inform consent , 3 ) completion 6-month study . Subjects place Freedom Bed automatically turn accordance position determine optimal initial pressure map approve attend physician . All programmable turning angle , dwell time , head leg elevation must `` dial '' within week study begin . Any modification program study must approve care team document accordingly . Subjects place standard hospital bed require manual re-positioning every 2 hour . All turn and/or re-positioning must time document . Subjects experience either development pressure injury , worsen skin condition point specialty bed require deemed test failure . The primary secondary outcome measure document subject throughout week collect Clinical Research Coordinator ( CRC ) weekly basis submit Principal Investigator . The weekly report consolidate CRC monthly report submit Institutional Review Board ( IRB ) , Principal Investigators ( PI ) Supervising Authorities ( SA ) review .</detailed_description>
