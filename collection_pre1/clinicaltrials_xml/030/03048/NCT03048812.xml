	<brief_summary>Dental implant often prefer treatment option clinical scenario consider standard care restore miss damage teeth , due limitation conventional treatment . For fully edentulous subject , conventional tissue-supported denture case associate severe subjective complaint difficult adaptation , mainly mandibular denture , result limited function detrimental effect oral health-related quality life , especially old patient . The use implant retain mandibular denture ( overdenture ) recommend suitable low-cost alternative improve denture stability , positive effect oral comfort function . The two-implant mandibular overdenture consider effective design achieve clinical benefit patient . However , main problem face two-implant overdenture high cost implantation relative complexity surgical intervention , use single midline implant retain mandibular overdenture suggest viable solution reduce cost complexity treatment similar benefit compare solution higher number implant . Nevertheless , study compare performance different retention system effect patient-centered outcome , satisfaction denture , oral health-related quality life , individual preference subjective rating clinical outcome . Thus , aim randomize clinical trial crossover design investigate change clinical patient-reported outcome follow use different retention system single implant-retained mandibular overdenture Hypothesis : hypothesized clinical patient-reported outcome single-implant mandibular overdenture dependent type retention system , patient distinct preference relation different attachment</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Attachment Types Single-implant Mandibular Overdentures : Crossover Clinical Trial</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The absence natural teeth negative effect edentulous subject ' quality life . It affect badly masticatory muscle , chew efficiency digestive process , ability speak clearly , psycho-social impact related esthetic non-self-confidence often associate increase risk chronic systemic disease . In Brazil , tooth loss still public health problem high prevalence negative impact live individual , despite possibility control mean preventive rehabilitation technology aim promote oral health . The prevalence tooth loss 76.6 % general population , median 6 teeth lose population age 15 year old . There high prevalence edentulism 65-74 year age group maxilla ( 63.1 % ) mandible ( 37.5 % ) . Epidemiological data show improvement oral health status adult demand denture . However , major problem still concentrate population age 65 74 , average caries index rate 27.1 2010 ( 2003 average 27.8 ) predominance component lose decay . From 2003 2010 , proportion elderly people need denture drop 24 % 23 % 16 % 15 % need partial denture . Although treatment use implant widely available , conventional complete denture still important part oral health care edentulous individual , mainly due economic reason . However , conventional complete denture always achieve treatment goal regard patient satisfaction function , number edentulous patient problem denture related retention comfort mastication speech , especially mandibular denture . The limitation conventional denture make implant-supported mandibular overdenture consider preferred option number edentulous elder . As stabilization implant increase denture retention stability , improve masticatory efficiency patient satisfaction . Furthermore , scientific evidence also contribute prevention bone resorption . The mandibular overdenture retain two implant recommend minimum standard care edentulous mandible . However , consensus report consider anything le negligent care disregard afford two implant , main problem relate implant overdenture higher financial cost compare conventional complete denture . This inconsistent treatment concept elderly , include simplicity cost effectiveness major requirement treatment planning . In recent year , single-implant mandibular overdenture propose alternative complex overdenture design treatment mandibular edentulism . This treatment approach assume simple less costly fix implant treatment overdenture retain two implant . It also consider feasible option geriatric patient group diminish functional demand favorable local bone condition symphyseal region ensure satisfactory primary implant stability . A series clinical study show satisfactory result single-implant mandibular overdenture treatment regard patient satisfaction quality life measure , well clinical radiographic outcome implant survival rate , marginal bone loss longitudinal implant stability . Although study differ experimental design , use different implant retention system , load protocol evaluation distinct clinical outcome , agree use single implant retain overdenture result mark improvement compare conventional treatment Attachment system use implant-retained overdentures small interlocking device link implant denture offer many balanced solution function oral comfort . The attachment system allow improvement masticatory function , bite force , food selection quality life . The retention design classify mechanical , friction fit magnetic . There various attachment available clinician market today bar connection , ball attachment , magnet , rigid non-rigid telescopic coping stud attachment . Clinical study also report complication related clinical performance attachment system use single-implant mandibular overdentures . Loss retention matrix replacement one common maintenance event single mandibular overdenture patient , although study report need replacement long-term follow-up . Studies show great variation incidence matrix replacement , although comparison different type retention system time-to-event analysis report . No difference incidence repair adjustment mandibular overdentures support 1 2 implant observe . The impact different attachment type patient satisfaction quality life recognize critical outcome require investigation . For single-implant mandibular overdentures , study report majority use ball-o'ring , magnet stud attachment system . However , evidence superiority one system another available , consider patient-reported outcome individual preference , easy handle oral comfort ; technical criterion level retention , longevity , retrievability need adjustment replacement . This study focus improve patient health care quality , satisfaction treatment outcomes consider golden goal study clinical benefit treatment compare different type attachment single-implant mandibular overdenture treatment . This experimental study use randomized clinical trial crossover design test clinical patient-reported outcome dependent type retention system , patient distinct preference test attachment .</detailed_description>
