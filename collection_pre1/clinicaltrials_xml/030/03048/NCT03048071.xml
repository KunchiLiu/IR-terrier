	<detailed_description>Congenital heart diseases nowadays frequently treat newborn . These congenital heart defect directly affect right ventricular ejection tract ( RVOT ) , sometimes indirectly , leave ventricular ejection tract ( LVOT ) replace ROVT Ross operation . Originally introduce Ross Somerville 1966 , reconstruction ROVT valved homograft since widely use . The technique become particularly popular mid-1980s , routine use cryopreservation . Pulmonary aortic homograft constitute gold standard conduit replacement right ventricle pulmonary artery ( VD-AP ) . Early failure homograft mainly due early calcification . Lung homograft , however , less prone obstruction calcification aortic homograft readily available , particularly small size ( 10-18mm ) . The increase demand homograft currently induce shortage unmet demand . This lack availability , durability homograft young patient , encourage search alternative conduct . For example , 1999 , Medtronic® put bovine jugular vein xenograft ( VJB ) market , Contegra® conduct , alternative homograft RVOT reconstruction . This duct naturally central valve three valvule , side valve generous duct length allow unique adaptation option . It store glutaraldehyde solution concentration sufficient enough make non-antigenic , yet low enough maintain flexibility tissue.This conduit many advantage : 1 ) Immediate availability 2 ) Available size range 12 22mm internal diameter 3 ) Possibility adaptation morphology easily suturable 4 ) Good hemodynamics 5 ) No need proximal distal extension 6 ) low cost homograft 7 ) non-antigenicity . This conduit , however , perfect . On one hand , growth potential therefore risk become small longer suitable child develop . This problem particularly encounter small patient , ducts less 16mm diameter implant , specific duct VJB . On hand , source failure specific Contegra® prosthesis . These stenosis level distal anastomosis duct pulmonary artery . Several mechanism explain distal stenosis : 1 ) hypoplasia distal stenosis branch pulmonary artery , 2 ) difference size duct pulmonary artery important , 3 ) surgical technique , 4 ) immunological inflammatory reaction , 5 ) neointimal proliferation , 6 ) thrombus formation . The likely cause multifactorial , combination factor cite . Prior et al propose operative protocol reduce distal stenosis rate . With protocol distal stenosis become rare complication still situations VJB conduit need replace . Therefore , whether use Contegra® duct homograft , replacement inevitable . The aim study compare operative morbidity mortality replace Contegra® homograft .</detailed_description>
