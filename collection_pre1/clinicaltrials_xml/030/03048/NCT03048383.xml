	<brief_title>Comparison Three Botulinum Neuromodulators Management Facial Synkinesis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Quality assurance : Data enter spreadsheet extract exactly electronic medical record . During review finding , data check medical record ensure accuracy . Botulinum toxin type also verify scanned copy botulinum toxin injection sheet fill scanned medical record time treatment . Data dictionary : Not necessary limit new terminology use understood among research group . Additional terminology clearly describe trial participant describe manuscript reporting result study . Recruitment : Patients facial synkinesis appropriate candidate botulinum toxin chemodenervation therapy offer voluntary participation trial . Patients return baseline SAQ score minimum 12 week since previous treatment permit re-enroll study subsequent treatment . Data collection : At 1 , 2 , 4 week post treatment , patient administer SAQ . SAQ score calculate follow time point . The average SAQ score treatment group ( onabotulinumtoxinA , abobotulinumtoxinA , incobotulinumtoxinA ) week calculate , well average improvement SAQ score . Data management : Data initially record stored secure , password protect , electronic medical record . Data extract electronic medical record secure Excel spreadsheet store password protect computer . Only principal investigator researcher involve data analysis interpretation provide access data . Names identifiable information exclude spreadsheet information could link back specific patient . Data analysis : Data analyze first organize data Excel , within original spreadsheet use record data , export data Prism 6 Windows ( GraphPad Software ) . Using Prism 6 , characteristic data assess statistical calculation perform determine significance comparison group . Details statistical test describe . Reporting adverse event : Adverse event record electronic medical record follow-up visit . These note data spreadsheet well keep track event occur study period . Minor adverse effect report study include redness , bruising , swell , fullness injection site felt significant note qualitatively different product . No major adverse treatment effect report course study . Change management : There significant change study protocol course study . Sample size assessment specify number participant participant year necessary demonstrate effect : http : //www.dssresearch.com/knowledgecenter/toolkitcalculators/statisticalpowercalculators.aspx At alpha level 0.05 , estimate standard deviation 10 , estimate average SAQ 44 comparison/test value SAQ 55 , sample size calculate approximately 400 . We unable obtain sample size nearly 3 year enrolment July 2012 March 2015 . However , despite reach estimate sample size , identify statistically significant find alpha level 0.05 standard deviation approximately 10-15 per group . Plan miss data address situation variable report miss , unavailable , `` non-reported , '' uninterpretable , consider miss data inconsistency out-of-range result : Patients without follow-up post-treatment time point 1 , 2 , 4 week exclude therefore miss data expect SAQ value . The plan miss data study leave data point miss without attempt imputate value otherwise correct missingness . Statistical analysis plan describe analytical principle statistical technique employ order address primary secondary objective , specify study protocol plan : The average SAQ score treatment group ( onabotulinumtoxinA , abobotulinumtoxinA , incobotulinumtoxinA ) week calculate , well average improvement SAQ score . Lower SAQ score represent less severe patient report disease . Percent improvement SAQ score calculate time point average post-treatment score divided average pre-treatment score treatment group , subtract 1 . The SAQ score time point treatment group find normally distribute ( pass D'Agostino &amp; Pearson omnibus normality test well Shapiro-Wilk normality test ) allow assumption Gaussian distribution follow test statistical significance . Comparisons treatment , time point within treatment group make one-way ANOVA follow appropriate follow-up test multiple comparison . Comparisons within treatment group follow-up time point , control pre-treatment time point make use Dunnett test ( compare every mean control mean ) , whereas comparison different treatment give time point make Tukey test ( compare every mean every mean ) . A threshold p â‰¤ 0.05 used statistical significance . Patients return baseline SAQ score minimum 12 week since previous treatment permit re-enroll study subsequent treatment . Twenty-seven patient study , 6 27 enrol multiple time account 11 38 treatment study . To ensure baseline SAQ score patient receive repeat treatment differ patient receive single treatment , average pre-treatment SAQ score patient undergoing repeat treatment compare average pre-treatment SAQ score single treatment patient type botulinum toxin neuromodulator . These group evaluate normality distribution method describe , single treatment patient pass test normality ; normality repeat patient could determine due small number treatment patient . Statistical comparison make pre-treatment SAQ score repeat treatment patient respective ( type botulinum toxin ) single treatment patient . In order preference type I error identify possible difference group , make assumption normality use one-way ANOVA follow Holm-Sidak multiple comparison test . The Holm-Sidak method choose power identify significant difference possible method Bonferroni .</detailed_description>
