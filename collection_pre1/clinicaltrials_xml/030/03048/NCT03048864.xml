	<brief_title>Questionnaire Metabolic Screening</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PURPOSE : The purpose project determine whether metabolic workups administer Canadian kidney stone patient accordance CUA ( Canadian Urologic Association ) guideline . Additionally , study look evaluate whether result metabolic test sufficiently explain patient doctor , also whether patient would follow dietary treatment plan possibly prevent kidney stone base metabolic workups . HYPOTHESIS : The investigator hypothesize implementation metabolic test base CUA guideline sub-optimal prescribed , doctor adequately explain result patient . The investigator also hypothesize patient would follow dietary treatment plant prevent recurrent stone formation base metabolic result - prescribed patient . JUSTIFICATION : The investigator believe implementation metabolic workups sub-optimal . The investigator would like confirm , future , metabolic workups promote appropriate tool identify metabolic abnormality contribute stone disease . If metabolic workups administer explain adequately patient diet treatment plan significantly reduce recurrence stone stone patient . OBJECTIVES : 1 . Determine metabolic workups administer accord CUA guideline . 2 . For patient receive metabolic workups , determine result metabolic workups explain patient , do adequately ( patient understand explanation ) 3 . Determine patient compliance regard dietary treatment plan base metabolic workups RESEARCH DESIGN : This survey base study ( one time completion ) give patient pre-ESWL . The survey analyze research staff determine study objective .</detailed_description>
