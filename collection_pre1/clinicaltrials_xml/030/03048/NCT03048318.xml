	<brief_title>Antegrade Arterial Portal Flushing Versus Portal Flushing Only LDLT</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Biliary reconstruction label `` Achilles heel '' liver transplantation common cause postoperative morbidity also mortality .Living donor liver transplantation ( LDLT ) high incidence biliary complication 30 % high Deceased Donor Liver Transplantation seem improve significantly experience.The virtually unchanged incidence biliary stricture suggest simply `` technical '' origin , probably represent mucosa ischemic injury inherent transplantation procedure . The blood supply bile duct mainly arterial system skeletonisation duct dissection impair blood supply render ischemic . Various donor maneuver well flush preserve peribiliary vascular plexus biliary mucosa study decrease biliary complication . LDLT advantage haemodynamic stable donor short cold ischemia also disadvantage small graft size , small duct , complicate reconstruction absence arterial flush . Conventional portal flush animal liver could remove warm blood arterial system graft without retrograde arterial flush high post operative bilirubin.With study Living Donor Liver Transplant , conclude retrograde flushing may ameliorate post operative cholestasis . There data publish antegrade arterial flush effect biliary complication Living Donor Liver Transplant . This study aim compare back table graft arterial portal flushing portal flush alone evaluate biliary arterial complication . Arterial flush make part standard protocol institute safety establish . There center routinely perform back table arterial flush .</detailed_description>
