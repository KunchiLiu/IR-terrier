	<brief_summary>In investigation , 15 subject high probability cardiac sarcoidosis base clinical criterion abnormal cardiac FDG uptake initial , clinically indict FDG PET study consider study . The study test follow Aims : Aim 1 . Effect FDG incubation time visual quantitative interpretation FDG uptake . Changes incubation time affect image target : background ratio study sensitivity/specificity . For study-directed exam , patient undergo sequential cardiacfocused FDG-PET image 90 120 minute injection FDG . Imaging variable evaluate . Aim 2 . Reproducibility FDG Rb82 PET finding sequential imaging . It unknown whether FDG-positive imaging finding cardiac sarcoidosis reproducible . All patient undergo study-directed FDG-PET/CT MPI image within approximately 2 week initial clinical scan .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Sarcoidosis systemic disease unknown etiology characterize non-caseating granulomatous inflammation . The pathophysiologic feature cardiac sarcoidosis include macrophage-induced , T-cell mediate non-caseating granulomatous inflammation , follow myocardial scarring/fibrosis clinical sequela include arrhythmia , conduction abnormality , contractile dysfunction . These lead high event rate patient cardiac sarcoidosis , several study report prevalence ventricular tachycardia range 23 % 38 % ~ 20 % rate clinical congestive heart failure . FDG-PET/CT Rb82 myocardial perfusion imaging ( FDG-PET MPI ) become gold standard image technique evaluate degree inflammation response immunosuppressive treatment patient cardiac sarcoidosis . FDG PET image allows evaluation inflammatory macrophage infiltration , Rb82 MPI allow determination myocardial scar burden . Despite emerge data center others clinical utility technique predict prognosis , little consensus reproducibility technique optimal image acquisition technique interpretative strategy . In study , patient high clinical likelihood cardiac sarcoidosis undergo study-directed FDG PET/CT Rb82 myocardial perfusion image study approximately 2 week follow initial clinically-directed examination . The two FDG PET MPI examination examine reproducibility imaging finding , include : SUVmax , SUVmean , distribution FDG uptake , extra cardiac FDG uptake , SUVvolume , SUVvolume : intensity , perfusion defect size/severity/location , LV ejection fraction , myocardial blood flow . Strict attention pay ensure patient undergo metabolic preparation prior two examination .</detailed_description>
