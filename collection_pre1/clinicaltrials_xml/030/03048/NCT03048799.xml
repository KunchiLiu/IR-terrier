	<brief_summary>Post-prostatectomy urinary incontinence ( IUPP ) difficult treat complication cause profound negative impact individual 's quality life , well seriously disrupt physician-patient relationship substantial public health problem . Urinary incontinence ( UI ) occur treatment benign prostatic hyperplasia ( BPH ) treatment prostate cancer . In treatment benign disease , complication associate low prevalence , initially 9 % 1 % 12 month postoperatively . In radical prostatectomy , prevalence high , vary 2 % 87 % , depend population site study , definition use , different methodology employ evaluation incontinence , also different degree intensity disease . Several author evaluate incidence incontinence robotic radical prostatectomy , open laparoscopically . With technique , report total UI incidence varies 4 % 40 % . With high prevalence IUPP , accelerate recovery urinary control important priority patient caregiver , search effective low-risk treatment constant . Thus , possibility treatment radiofrequency ( RF ) feature arises .</brief_summary>
