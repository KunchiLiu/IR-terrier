	<brief_summary>This study expect provide novel data regard potential structural functional change thyroid gland morbidly obese adult follow significant weight loss bariatric surgery . These data complement evidence epidemiological study regard association obesity alteration thyroid function . Potentially study may justify longer-term study regard effect weight gain and/or weight loss morphology thyroid gland could help form recommendation regard follow-up investigation thyroid morbidly obese patient .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Alterations thyroid function report obesity . Thyroid hormones thyroid-stimulating hormone ( TSH ) concentration variously describe normal , elevate , low morbidly obese patient compare normal weight control . However , common observation significant proportion patient morbid obesity display slightly increase serum level TSH , even relatively mild elevation serum TSH associate increase occurrence obesity . Of note , abnormality thyroid function TSH mostly normalize weight loss , suggest biochemical alteration reversible . Despite uncertainty regard underlying mechanism , suggest neither autoimmunity iodine deficiency seem play critical role . Several alternative mechanism lead hyperthyrotropinemia hypothesize , include impaired feedback due decrease number triiodothyronine ( T3 ) receptor hypothalamus , variation peripheral deiodinase activity . Leptin , addition regulate body weight satiation , also show mediate production pro-TRH culture fetal rat hypothalamic neuron . Partial regulation TSH leptin also report human . In addition , peripheral thyroid hormone metabolism appear reflect ratio T3 reverse T3 ( rT3 ) ( T3/rT3-ratio ) . We show T3/rT3-ratio significantly increase insulin resistant patient compare insulin sensitive partner despite comparable TSH value . Given obesity strongly associate insulin resistance , thyroid hormone know modulate carbohydrate metabolism , e.g . affect cellular glucose uptake , possible change T3/fT3 ratio follow weight loss bariatric surgery could interest . Data cross-sectional study indicate thyroid structure obese patient also affect , independent existence autoimmune thyroiditis indicate presence auto-antibodies TPO . Ultrasound ( US ) scan able accurately characterize echographic structure thyroid tissue , addition estimation thyroid volume identification non-palpable thyroid nodule . The typical normal thyroid parenchyma distinct high echo density due follicle structure , contrast well tissue collar muscle . The interface thyroid cell colloid exhibit elevate acoustic impedance , cause high-frequency acoustic wave reflect back US probe . However , autoimmune thyroid diseases lymphocytic infiltration disruption normal tissue architecture cause reduction thyroid echogenicity , whereas tissue close muscle tissue appear remain unaffected . Only previous study report morphology thyroid gland adult morbid obesity . Given thyroid function report return normal weight loss , research question also raise potential reversibility thyroid structural abnormality follow substantial weight loss previously morbidly obese patient .</detailed_description>
