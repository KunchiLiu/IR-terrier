	<brief_summary>PURPOSE : The primary purpose study demonstrate Composite Clinical Success study group receive Superion® IDS inferior success rate observe study group treat direct decompression 60 month follow-up . Secondarily , trial intend establish Composite Clinical Success study group receive Superion® IDS 24 month inferior success rate observe 24 month patient treat Superion® IDS original IDE trial . Thirdly , trial intend establish Composite Clinical Success population receive Superion® IDS trial 24 month inferior success rate observe 24 month patient treat direct decompression .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>STUDY DESIGN : This study prospective , multi-center , randomize control `` Conditions Use '' clinical trial compare Superion® IDS open , direct decompression treatment subject age 45 old suffering moderate symptom neurogenic intermittent claudication secondary confirm diagnosis moderate LSS one two contiguous level L1 L5 , i.e . L1-L2 level L4-L5 level . A maximum 20 investigative site U.S. enroll subject trial use 1:1 randomization assignment . Enrollment include 358 subject ( 152 per arm , plus 18 % account lose follow-up ) . An investigative site define facility facility general geographic location control local Institutional Review Board ( IRB ) . After implantation Superion® IDS performance direct decompression , Investigator permit provide postoperative care regimen base subject 's specific need . The regimen may include , need limit : medication , corset brace , acupuncture , traction , physical therapy , chiropractic treatment , use TENS unit massage therapy . The type amount postoperative care collect . At follow-up visit 60 month , subject interview determine experienced adverse event ( AEs ) since previous follow-up visit . A neurological assessment perform patient baseline follow-up visit . All subject require complete ZCQ , ODI , VAS , EQ-5D VertiFlex® Patient Satisfaction questionnaires evaluate disability , function , pain , quality life satisfaction follow-up visit . Subjects also require complete VAS questionnaire evaluate pain status discharge . The potential impact spinal injections/nerve block use ZCQ evaluate base review medical literature . As potentially confound ZCQ outcome , epidural steroid injection nerve block procedure treat level ( ) deem failure . Further , rhizotomy procedure treat level ( ) deem failure . With respect spinal cord stimulators , use permanent implant would require surgical procedure , deem device failure . Radiographic evaluation perform discharge , schedule follow-up visit prior re-operations , accordance Radiographic Evaluation Protocol . The Investigator may also obtain x-ray unscheduled visit assess adverse event , clinically indicate .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>1 . Male female subject ≥ 45 year age . 2 . Persistent leg/buttock/groin pain , without back pain consistently relieve flexion activity ( example : sit bend shop cart ) . 3 . Subjects symptomatic undergo conservative care treatment least 6 month , without relief . 4 . Diagnosis degenerative spinal stenosis lumbar spine , define narrowing midline sagittal spinal canal ( central ) and/or narrow facet superior articulate process ( SAP ) , posterior vertebral margin ( lateral access ) , nerve root canal ( foraminal ) . 5 . Radiographic confirmation least moderate spinal stenosis narrow central , lateral , foraminal spinal canal one two contiguous level L1L5 . Moderate spinal stenosis define ≤50 % reduction lateral/central foramen . 6 . Must present moderately impaired Physical Function ( PF ) define score ≥ 2.0 Zurich Claudication Questionnaire ( ZCQ ) . 7 . Subjects able give voluntary , write informed consent participate clinical investigation consent obtain . 8 . Subjects , , opinion Clinical Investigator , able understand clinical investigation , cooperate investigational procedure willing return require posttreatment followup . Note : In Criteria # 5 , image use confirm LSS complete within 4 week prior enrollment . Radiographic confirmation LSS may include MRI and/or CT. 1 . Axial back pain . 2 . Fixed motor deficit low extremity ( y ) . 3 . Diagnosis lumbar spinal stenosis , patient randomize Superion arm , would require direct neural decompression surgical intervention require implant Superion® device randomize direct decompression arm , would require decompression procedure would create significant instability require spinal fusion , without instrumentation . 4 .
