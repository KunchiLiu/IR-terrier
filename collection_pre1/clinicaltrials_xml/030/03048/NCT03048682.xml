	<brief_summary>This study randomize control trial design assess rate failure void trial early late post-operative period within patient underwent outpatient pelvic floor surgery fail initial day void trial . Based Hakvoort et al . study study would require 90 subject . This study would power detect difference UTIs Foley catheter re-insertion rate . Assuming 10 % drop-out rate , 100 total subject enrol study . All patient meet appropriate inclusion criterion schedule outpatient pelvic floor surgery consider study . Patients counsel study either office surgical planning office visit , pre-operative telephone call , pre-operative area prior surgery . Consents sign pre-operative area . After surgery , patient give standardize void trial per usual protocol . If patient un-successful empty bladder discharge home indwelling Foley catheter antibiotic . On post-operative day ( POD ) # 1 patient re-assessed meeting eligibility requirement call randomize either early void trial group ( EVT ) late void trial group ( LVT ) . Subjects EVT schedule repeat VT POD # 2 , POD # 3 , POD # 4 , whereas LVT schedule repeat VT POD # 7 . Subjects unsuccessful repeat VT Foley catheter re-inserted return another VT 5-7 day . Subjects fail third VT either group Foley catheter replace return another office VT wait additional 5-7 day start clean intermittent self-catheterization . Subjects monitor 6 week period void urinary symptom . Urine test via in-office urinalysis office visit , include pre-operatively , send urine culture per usual practice base upon abnormal urinalysis result . Urine culture grow single organism &gt; 10,000 CFU treat appropriate antibiotic . In addition , patient complete quality life questionnaire time catheter removal , standard 2 week post-op visit 6weeks post-operatively .</brief_summary>
