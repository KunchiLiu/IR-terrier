	<brief_summary>Dysphagia stroke associate increased pulmonary complication mortality . The swallowing therapy could decrease pulmonary complication improve quality life stroke . The swallow therapy include dietary modification , thermal stimulation , compensatory position , oropharyngeal muscle stimulation . Most researcher use clinical assessment videofluoroscopy evaluate effect swallow therapy . Some author perform functional magnetic resonance imaging ( fMRI ) investigate brain neuroactivity swallow task normal adult unilateral hemispheric stroke patient . The aim study explore effect swallow therapy clinical swallow function also brain plasticity acute stroke patient dysphagia videofluoroscopy fMRI .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Dysphagia After Different Swallowing Therapies</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>In study , 10 healthy control 48 patient single acute hemispheric brain stem stroke enrol . Both 24 hemispheric 24 brain stem stroke patient divide 3 group . General swallow therapy , oropharyngeal neuromuscular electrical stimulation ( NMES ) , combine general NMES therapy randomly provide 3 group . Each patient receive clinical assessment food oral intake scale , functional dysphagia scale videofluoroscopy , brain neuroactivity fMRI . The investigator hope find benefit swallowing therapy clinical swallow function brain functional neuroactivity/reorganization acute stroke . While compare 3 swallow therapy , different functional neuroactivity may facilitate different swallow therapy . Finally , investigator could also find effective swallow therapy among 3 therapy acute stroke patient dysphagia accord finding videofluoroscopy fMRI .</detailed_description>
