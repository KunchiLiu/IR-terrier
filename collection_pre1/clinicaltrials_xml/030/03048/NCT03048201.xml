	<detailed_description>This post-market registry study ; study device FDA clear use accord intend use . This multi-centre , prospective , non-randomized study . Subjects implant one follow configuration Physica system : Physica KR ( Kinematic Retaining ) , Physica CR ( Cruciate Retaining ) Physica PS ( Posterior Stabilized ) . The assignment patient involve study determine aetiology preoperatively evaluate Investigator fall within current practice . The decision use specific prosthesis design decide Investigators independently clearly separated decision include patient study . Baseline measurement ( pre-operative clinical analysis radiographic analysis 6-week FU ) serve internal control term assessment post-surgery data 10 year . The primary objective study obtain implant survivorship evaluate clinical , PROMs radiographic outcome commercially available Physica system .</detailed_description>
