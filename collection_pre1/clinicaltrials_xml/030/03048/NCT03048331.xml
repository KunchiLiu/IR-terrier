	<brief_summary>FES common establish method rehabilitation person spinal cord injury ( SCI ) . Some known effect FES investigate several study e.g . avoid disuse denervation atrophy , improve muscle force , power output endurance change muscle fibre type , increase cross sectional area muscle , increase muscle mass , activation nerve sprouting , reduce spasticity motor learn . Most study investigate impact FES low limb . For upper extremity few study exist . However , suppose effect FES similar . In rehabilitation person tetraplegia , FES , especially stimulation upper extremity trigger electromyography ( EMG ) establish method generally improve hand arm function . However , none study investigate effect FES combination reconstructive tetraplegia hand surgery . Improved muscle strength suppose improve functional outcome participation . Additionally , FES could increase motor learn process . Supported clinical observation hypothesize FES positive influence outcome surgical reconstruction tendon and/or nerve transfer .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Functional Electrical Stimulation ( FES ) Reconstructive Tetraplegia Hand Arm Surgery</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>In rehabilitation patient tetraplegia , FES common use method improve function arm hand . The effect FES also gain importance consider procedure reconstructive arm and/or hand surgery tetraplegic patient . The functioning arm hand muscle improve surgically invert intact muscle . Therefore , strengthen donor recipient muscle FES seem reasonable . So far establish systematic training FES reconstructive hand arm surgery could additionally improve outcome term strength , motor learn function . However , clinical observation show possible positive effect FES . The aim present randomize control study evaluate use FES reconstructive arm and/or hand surgery order increase strength donor recipient muscle , thus , improve result regard strength functionality . A total 30 tetraplegic patient plan reconstructive arm and/or hand surgery Swiss Paraplegic Centre include study . The participate subject randomize two group : control intervention group . The control group ( 15 patient ) receive define standardized physio- occupational therapy surgery . The intervention group ( 15 patient ) receive combination standardize physio- occupational therapy FES , surgery . The standardized therapy supplement FES 3 month , 3 x 30min per week . To verify effect FES muscular strength functionality arm hand , several assessment conduct 4 different time point ( T1 : 12 week surgery // T2 : surgery // T3 : 4 week post-surgery // T4 : 16 week post-surgery ) . The course voluntary muscular strength strength generate FES , donor recipient muscle measure . In addition , change muscle volume forearm upper arm assess ultrasound . Furthermore , standardize test check several grasp action perform also manual test muscle arm hand . Statistical analysis assessment enable estimation benefit effect FES additional therapy context reconstructive arm and/or hand surgery tetraplegic patient .</detailed_description>
