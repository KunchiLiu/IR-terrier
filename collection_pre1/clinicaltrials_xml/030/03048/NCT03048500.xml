	<brief_summary>The purpose study find benefit combine nivolumab metformin advance non-small cell lung cancer without prior treatment immunotherapy . We also look safety combination . Nivolumab currently approve certain cancer melanoma , lung cancer kidney cancer . Metformin approve US Food Drug Administration ( FDA ) treat diabetes . In study , Metformin use treat cancer . This use approve FDA ; therefore , study , consider experimental . Experimental mean U.S. FDA approve drug use type cancer . Nivolumab antibody ( human protein stick part tumor and/or immune cell ) design allow body 's immune system work tumor cell . It believe metformin immune modify property , mean boost immune system . As result , may help certain cancer treatment , know immunotherapy , work well .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Nivolumab Metformin Hydrochloride Treating Patients With Stage III-IV Non-small Cell Lung Cancer That Can Be Removed Surgery</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To assess anti-tumor activity combination treatment metformin hydrochloride ( metformin ) nivolumab patient non-small cell lung cancer without prior exposure PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitor . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . To assess efficacy combination treatment metformin nivolumab accord depth , duration , persistence response , disease control rate ( DCR ; complete response [ CR ] , partial response [ PR ] , stable disease [ SD ] 24 week ) , progression-free survival ( PFS ) , overall survival ( OS ) patient non-small cell lung cancer without prior exposure PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitor use Response Evaluation Criteria Solid Tumors ( RECIST ) criterion version ( v ) 1.1 . II . To assess efficacy combination treatment metformin nivolumab accord depth , duration , persistence response , objective response rate ( ORR ) , DCR , PFS , OS population use immune-related RECIST ( irRECIST ) criterion . III . To assess safety tolerability profile combination treatment metformin nivolumab population use Common Terminology Criteria Adverse Events ( CTCAE ) version 4.03 . TERTIARY OBJECTIVES : I . To assess immune-related tumor blood biomarkers include T cell marker association treatment response population . II . To assess dynamic change immune genomic biomarkers blood may correlate response metformin . OUTLINE : Patients receive metformin hydrochloride orally ( PO ) daily ( QD ) day -7 -1 1-28 . Patients also receive nivolumab intravenously ( IV ) 30 minute day 1 15 course 1-4 , 60 minute day 1 begin course 5 . Courses repeat every 28 day absence disease progression , unacceptable toxicity , withdrawal consent . After completion study treatment , patient follow 30 day , every 3 month 1 year , every 6 month 3 year .</detailed_description>
