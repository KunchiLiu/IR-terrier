	<detailed_description>Heart failure ( HF ) believe modern-day epidemic due increase incidence , impaired long-term prognosis huge economic burden . With age population impact HF health care resource rise . The course disease characterize episode acute decompensation mark significant turn point progress disease , in-hospital mortality rate high 10 % . Acute heart failure ( AHF ) gradual rapid change HF sign symptom , require urgent medical therapy . Acute heart failure estimate costly frequent cause admission emergency ward . Emergency department ( ED ) primary set initial AHF management take place . However , strong evidence diagnostics management grave condition still lack . Even less known prevalence , diagnosis management acute right ventricular failure ( RVF ) . A patient presenting ED acute dyspnea undergo numerous procedure order differentiate diagnosis AHF , chronic obstructive pulmonary disease , pneumonia , pulmonary embolism etiology . Moreover , majority HF patient suffer comorbidities make diagnostic process even challenge . Due numerous exam test , initial management patient may delay , result extended hospital length stay , increase rate complication death . The clinical , hemodynamic neurohormonal feature heart failure diﬀerent specific patient population depend age , sex , race , leave ventricular ejection fraction co-existent right ventricular ( RV ) dysfunction well many factor . Cardiac biomarkers easily reproducible objective laboratory test could help improve early AHF diagnosis risk stratification . However , report data suggest vary prognostic diagnostic value natriuretic peptide , N-type natriuretic peptide ( BNP ) , N-terminal pro B-type natriuretic peptide ( NT-proBNP ) , MR pro-atrial natriuretic peptide ( MR-proANP ) , well regional difference marker . Specific biomarkers RVF yet describe , thus search novel serologic marker could rapidly reliably help diagnose acute RVF important scientific task cardiology . Furthermore , knowledge incidence RVF syndrome well diagnostic prognostic value ultrasound RV structural functional parameter scarce . During study RV-focused ultrasound examination perform early hospitalization period , blood sample take frozen time . Up 15 novel cardiac , vascular , renal impairment inflammation biomarkers plasma sample acute phase RVF investigate study France , INSERM laboratory . The study unique aggregate large scale observational biomarkers database AHF patient Lithuania together innovative ultrasound parameter RV failure ( quantitative parameter RV systolic function deformation ) . The aim project find specific novel biomarkers acute heart failure ( AHF ) , evaluate diagnostic prognostic role association echocardiographic parameter AHF . The primary endpoint 1-year all-cause mortality rehospitalization . Secondary endpoint : 1. in-hospital all-cause mortality 2. post-discharge 1 3 month all-cause mortality rehospitalization 3. post-discharge 1 3 month cardiovascular mortality rehospitalization 4. one-year cardiovascular mortality rehospitalization . Objectives project : 1 . To create database patient hospitalize due acute heart failure Lithuania , integrate GREAT ( Global Research Acute Conditions Team ) network database ; 2 . To compare diagnostic prognostic value novel cardiac , vascular , renal insuﬃciency inflammation biomarkers Lithuanian patient cohort country GREAT network ; 3 . To determine demographic , clinical treatment characteristic well short long term outcome patient hospitalize due AHF Lithuania GREAT network country ; 4 . To evaluate epidemiology RVF together clinical feature outcome patient cohort Lithuanian acute heart failure ( HF ) patient ; 5 . To estimate correlation ultrasound parameter RV structure function novel cardiac , vascular , renal inflammation biomarkers acute period HF ; 6 . To identify novel ultrasound parameter RV structure function parameter biomarkers predict risk 1 year mortality hospitalization ; 7 . To create algorithm RV failure diagnostics risk stratification base diagnostic prognostic value detect echocardiographic parameter biomarkers . Observational study recent meta-analyses indicate acute condition RVF may frequent let ventricular failure ( LVF ) associate markedly poor prognosis . Largely empiric knowledge emergency medicine suggest right leave ventricular failure require diﬀerent therapeutic approach , include disparate principle intravenous treatment , due distinct hemodynamic impairment . The outcome RVF largely dependent underlie cause , result either acute chronic presentation . Novel biomarkers help identify underlying condition AHF . These include myocardial injury marker copeptine , proenkephalin , high sensitivity troponin T , troponin I , brain natriuretic peptide ( BNP ) , N-terminal-proBNP ; renal hepatic involvement marker adrenomedullin , neutrophil gelatinase-associated lipocalin ( NGAL ) , L-type fatty acid bind protein ( L-FABP ) , galectin-3 , soluble ST2 , cystatin C ; inflammatory marker C-reactive protein , interleukine 6 , procalcitonin . These marker could help evaluate end-organ involvement , well extent myocardial remodeling , return provide state-of-the-art tailored patient care . Specific biomarkers RV involvement dysfunction yet describe , therefore identification biomarkers would allow accelerate diagnosis RVF initiate specific treatment . Echocardiography potent accessible technique diagnosis AHF acute set . Echocardiography also provide information mechanism AHF well alternative cause dyspnea . Echocardiographic parameter RV structure function particular interest since much data available acute RVF . Quantitative parameter RV systolic diastolic function , RV wall deformation notional hemodynamic parameter could potentially useful diagnosis selection urgent treatment tactic . In current literature publication diagnostic prognostic value RV parameter , especially novel echocardiographic parameter ( strain rate , speckle track ) , early phase exacerbate heart failure . Global Research Acute Conditions Teal ( GREAT ) Association international network among expert operate management acute clinical condition field emergency medicine research concept translational medicine . This network integrate research input basic science interventional epidemiology optimize patient care preventive measure . Moreover , one main objectives GREAT association standardize clinical organizational system approach acute condition disease management world , concept globalization medicine . Up day large multicenter observational biomarkers study Lithuania field AHF . Our study create unique opportunity join worldwide GREAT network patient database , could potentially contain 50 000 patient .</detailed_description>
