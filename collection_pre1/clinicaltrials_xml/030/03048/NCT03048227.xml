	<brief_summary>During study , propose assess utility Continuous Glucose Measurements ( CGM ) group Type 1 diabetic patient treat implanted insulin pump . Patients participate two period 3 month separate 3 month washout . During one period , use CGM adapt insulin therapy period , manage diabetes usual capillary blood glucose meter . We except observe increase time spend glucose safe range use CGM .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Can Continuous Glucose Measurements Help Diabetic Patients Treated With Implantated Pump ?</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Glucose control quality life patient type 1 diabetes high glucose variability improve use implanted pump delivers insulin intra-peritoneal route . Some patient however still difficulty achieve glycemic goal despite therapy . Continuous Glucose Measurements ( CGM ) proven able improve glucose control ( HbA1c , time spend hypoglycaemia ) patient treat external insulin pump . No trial perform yet assess utility CGM patient use intra-peritoneal insulin delivery . During study , propose assess influence CGM use type 1 diabetic subject treat implanted insulin pump . It prospective , randomize cross-over study . After 2 week run-in period CGM follow 4 week break , subject participate two experimental period 3 month separate 3 month washout . During intervention phase , patient use CGM system ( Abbott Freestyle Navigator II ) adapt insulinotherapy . During control period , patient base insulinotherapy upon usual care capillary glucose measurement . The order period randomize . The main endpoint time spend glucose interval 70-180mg/dL last 20 day period . The control arm wear blind sensor phase allow comparison .</detailed_description>
