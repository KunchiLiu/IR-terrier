	<brief_summary>Hospitalizations severe infection associate opioid use disorder ( OUD ) , infective endocarditis ( IE ) , double US past decade frequently prolong resource-intensive . Once medically stabilize , person IE without drug use typically enroll outpatient parenteral antibiotic therapy ( OPAT ) , person IE OUD keep hospital duration therapy ( often 6 week ) largely due concern ongoing drug use . Unfortunately , hospitalization IE OUD infrequently include evidence-based medication-assisted treatment ( MAT ) buprenorphine methadone address OUD , despite strong evidence MAT decrease illicit drug use mortality . Enrolling hospitalized person IE due OUD comprehensive MAT ( i.e. , buprenorphine + counsel ) inpatient , provide intensive transitional outpatient care program support MAT , may support provision outpatient IV antibiotic therapy cost effective . The primary aim pilot randomize clinical trial evaluate equivalence current practice plus buprenorphine ( keep patient IE due opioid use disorder hospital full duration antibiotic treatment ) compare OPAT plus buprenorphine ( discharge outpatient treatment medically stable ) .</brief_summary>
