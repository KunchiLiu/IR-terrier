	<brief_summary>Despite rapid adoption World Health Organization 's 2013 guideline , many child continue infect HIV perinatally sub-optimal adherence continuum HIV care maternal child health clinic ( MCH ) . To achieve UNAIDS goal eliminate mother-to-child HIV transmission , multiple , adaptive intervention need implement improve adherence HIV continuum . The aim open label , parallel group , randomize control trial evaluate effectiveness Continuous Quality Improvement ( CQI ) intervention implement facility health district level improve retention care virological suppression 24 month postpartum among pregnant breastfeed woman receive ART MCH clinic Kinshasa , Democratic Republic Congo . Prior randomization , current monitoring evaluation system strengthen enable collection high quality individual patient-level data necessary timely production indicator monitor program outcome inform CQI intervention . Following randomization , health district randomize CQI , quality improvement ( QI ) team establish district level MCH clinic level . For 18 month , QI team bring together quarterly identify key bottleneck care delivery system use data monitoring system , develop action plan address bottleneck , implement action plan level district clinic . If proven effective , CQI design , could scale rapidly DRC resource-limited setting accelerate progress towards goal AIDS free generation .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The US President 's Emergency Plan AIDS Relief ( PEPFAR ) goal AIDS-free generation , re-emphasized PEPFAR 3.0 , achieve without substantial improvement adherence HIV care continuum among woman maternal child health clinic ( MCH ) resource-limited setting . In recent meta-analysis loss follow-up ( LTFU ) across prevention mother-to-child transmission HIV ( PMTCT ) cascade , 50 % HIV+ pregnant woman already LTFU delivery ; within 3 month delivery 33.9 % mother-infant pair also LTFU . Consequently , half pediatric infection currently estimate occur postpartum period breastfeed few 40 % HEI test HIV 2-3 month . Determinants poor performance occur multiple level : healthcare delivery system , provider , beneficiary ( HIV-infected mother ) . Current evidence suggest beyond individual-level factor , healthcare delivery system level factor paramount . Quality Improvement ( QI ) Collaborative one popular method organize sustained improvement effort hospital ambulatory practice worldwide . In Breakthrough Series approach also refer continuous quality improvement ( CQI ) ,10 QI team multiple site across region country bring together focus common problem . Over one two year , expert clinical performance improvement provide group periodic instruction encourage team share lesson learn best practice . However , popularity , CQI effectiveness never demonstrate randomized trial well-designed comparative study . The aim propose study : 1 ) evaluate effectiveness CQI intervention improve long-term retention care virological suppression woman start lifelong ART MCH clinic 2 ) identify modifiable health delivery system factor associate retention care sustain virological suppression woman start lifelong ART MCH clinic . The study implement Kinshasa , Democratic Republic Congo ( DRC ) : extremely resource-limited country struggle emerge decade gross mismanagement , rampant corruption , war leave health infrastructure shamble . We conduct cluster-randomized trial health district randomization unit . MCH clinic intervention group , undergo CQI initiative use participatory data-driven approach on-site monitoring supervisory support . We use survey health facility , include select staff , service beneficiary ( HIV infect mother ) collect data key characteristic service delivery 's organization provider ' patient ' perspective HIV care delivery performance . The main outcome LTFU/retention care , virological suppression MTCT rate evaluate 24 month postpartum .</detailed_description>
