	<brief_title>Effectiveness Cervical Traction Neural Mobilization Patients With Cervical Radiculopathy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Background : Cervical radiculopathy ( CR ) disorder peripheral nervous system result cervical nerve root ( CNR ) pathology produce chronic pain disability . Based epidemiological finding , CR common clinical diagnosis since annual incidence estimate 83 case per 100,000 , increase prevalence note fifth decade life . In addition , C6 C7 nerve root commonly involved disorder , mainly due high range motion occur cervical vertebrae C5-C6 C6-C7 . CR cause disc herniation , space-occupying lesion result CNR inflammation , impingement , . In normal situation , CNRs ensure normal function sensation , movement motor coordination upper limb . Therefore , development CR produce sensory motor deficit involve limb , include pin needle , numbness muscle weakness , along neuropathic pain describe burn shoot pain . These symptom lead patient exhibit severe functional limitation difficulty work , sleep participate hobby . Studies topic identify several socioeconomic psychological deficit , lose work wage prolong pain impaired social functioning , lead patient CR express symptom anxiety depression . Treatment CR subject debate physiotherapist researcher . Several non-operative treatment approach advocate reduce CR pain analgesic effect recognize number randomize clinical trial turn analyze systematic review . Based study , patient CR benefit multimodal treatment approach include application postural education , cervical traction manual therapy technique ( mobilization , thrust manipulation etc . ) apply cervical spine . However small number study well poor methodological quality due short-term follow ups , lack patient 's homogeneity , randomization control group etc. , raise several question validity research find therefore much study necessary . Among manual therapy technique recommend improve patient 's pain functional limitation , neural mobilization ( NM ) advocate effective treatment option . NM introduce intervention pain relief 25 year ago technique involve specific sequence joint movement mobilize involved peripheral nerve order facilitate reduce nerve gliding reduce increased neural mechanosensitivity . The application NM common since little research attention give support usage patient CR . Recently , case study randomize control study conclude neural mobilization apply simultaneously cervical traction produce clinically meaningful improvement 4-week period , term pain , disability , function , grip strength cervical spine range motion . However , methodological design allow determine whether NM provide benefit . Thus , purpose present study examine effect cervical traction without addition NM , patient CR .</detailed_description>
