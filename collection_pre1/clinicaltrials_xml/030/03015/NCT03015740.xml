	<brief_title>MGCD516 Combined With Nivolumab Renal Cell Cancer ( RCC )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Study Groups : If participant find eligible take part study , participant assign 1 4 dose level base participant join study . The dose MGCD516 participant receive depend well previously enrol participant tolerate study drug . All participant receive dose nivolumab . Study Drug Administration : Each study cycle 14 day ( 2 week ) . Participant take MGCD516 mouth every day participant study . Each dose take morning time day . Participant take MGCD516 least 2 hour 1 hour participant 's next meal . For example , participant take participant 's dose morning least 1 hour breakfast . Participant give study drug diary keep track participant take dose participant miss vomit dos . Participant return empty study drug bottle leftover study drug clinic begin cycle . Participant also receive nivolumab vein 60 minute Day 1 Cycles 2 beyond . Participant receive nivolumab Cycle 1 . Length Study : Participant may continue receive study drug long study doctor think participant 's best interest . Participant longer able take study drug disease get bad , intolerable side effect occur , participant unable follow study direction . Study Visits : Every 2 week : - Participant physical exam . - Blood ( 1 teaspoon ) drawn routine test . At Week 6 every 12 week ( Weeks 18 , 30 , 42 , ) : - Participant MRI and/or CT scan . If need , participant may also x-ray bone scan . - Blood ( 3 teaspoon ) draw check level sugar participant 's blood . Participant must fast 8 hour test . - If doctor think need , urine collect routine test . End-of-Treatment Visit : About 30 day participant 's last dose study drug : - Participant physical exam . - If participant stop take study drug side effect depend participant 's last scan , participant MRI and/or CT scan . If need , participant may also x-ray bone scan . Long-Term Follow-Up : Participant call member study staff every 3 month ask participant participant start new anti-cancer treatment . This information may collect participant 's medical record instead . This phone call take 5-10 minute . These call stop participant decide participant long want take part study . This investigational study . MGCD516 FDA approve commercially available . It currently use research purpose . Nivolumab FDA approve commercially available treatment many type cancer , include kidney cancer . The study doctor explain study drug design work . Up 60 participant enrol study . All take part MD Anderson .</detailed_description>
