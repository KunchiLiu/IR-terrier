	<detailed_description>Hypotheses : Compared provision population-based dietary advice , provide DNA-based dietary advice via personalized nutrigenomics test ( PNT ) 2 distinct patient population ( patient risk type 2 diabetes transplant recipient ) overweight obesity common concern , motivate adopt healthier dietary habit , lead great fat loss , increase percent lean mass therefore improve health quality life outcomes patient population . The second hypothesis dietary strategy relate intake one dietary component interest ( protein , fat , monounsaturated fat , polyunsaturated fat , total fat , sodium calorie ) mitigate post-transplant weight gain associate follow SNPs : ACE ( rs4343 ) , FTO ( rs1558902 ) MC4R ( rs571312 ) . Sample Size : No research date study aforementioned hypothesis . Previously publish data assess weight loss SNI group compare PNT group use randomize clinical intervention model different population use sample n = 93 alpha &lt; 0.05 find statistical significance 3-7 month follow-up . Similarly , nutrigenomics research ACE gene ( rs4343 ) find statistical significance use sample n = 104 alpha &lt; 0.05 . Since feasible research , large sample size ( n = 450 ) use increase power draw meaningful inference data . There 150 participant patient group ( n = 150 control group , n = 150 SNI group , n = 150 PNT group ) landmark study . Design Methods : Participants recruit Canadian Transplant Association ( CTA ) meeting ( transplant recipient ; n = 225 ) Group Lifestyle Balance Program ( GLB Program ) East Elgin Family Health Team ( patient risk type 2 diabetes ; n = 225 ) randomize clinical intervention trial . This trial involve total four group patient . The two main patient group include overweight obese ( BMI ≥ 25 kg/m^2 ) stable transplant recipient great equal 1 year post-transplant overweight obese ( BMI ≥ 25 kg/m^2 ) patient risk type 2 diabetes . Within two main patient group , three sub-groups ( n = 150 per group ) . Patients two main group either self select control group , randomize receive either PNT standard nutrition intervention ( SNI ) base strategy standard teach tool use dietitian patient population : 'Just Basics ' - developed Canadian Diabetes Association . Participants risk type 2 diabetes participate GLB Program either complete standard program ( SNI Group ) complete standard program + receive personalize nutrition physical activity recommendation base genetics ( PNT Group ) . Patients self-select control group instruct continue current nutrition physical activity regime . Baseline data conduct consist 24-hour recall , food frequency questionnaire 3-day food record use validated multiple pas method . Bioelectrical Impedance Analysis ( BIA ) conduct assess body composition derive percent body fat lean mass . Weight height measure use weigh scale stadiometer . Those patient randomize PNT group instruct tailored nutrition care plan physical activity level base individual nutrigenomics profile . At time , SNI group instruct general nutrition physical activity recommendation weight loss . Monthly email reminder send participant reminder nutrition plan , phone call ( depend patient 's preference ) . 3 month , 6 month 12 month baseline data collection individual nutrition intervention , baseline data repeat . After study complete , participant SNI group control group offer nutrigenomics test consultation register dietitian . Statistical Analysis : A paired t-test use ass within group change baseline follow-up time point : BMI , body fat , lean mass , water weight , dietary intake ( protein , total fat , saturate fat , trans fat , unsaturated fat , carbohydrate , calorie sodium ) . A repeated measure ANOVA use test group difference baseline follow-up time point : BMI , body fat , lean mass , water weight , dietary intake ( protein , total fat , saturate fat , trans fat , unsaturated fat , carbohydrate , calorie sodium ) . If significant mean difference detect , Tukey 's post hoc test utilized compare difference group . Statistical significance determine P &lt; 0.05 . General linear regression model use assess effect genotype interest ( ACE rs4343 , MC4R rs573112 , FTO rs1558902 ) impact dietary component interest ( protein , total fat , saturate fat , trans fat , unsaturated fat , carbohydrate , calorie sodium ) BMI body composition baseline follow-up time point . We control age , sex , ethnicity , immunosuppressive medication baseline body composition BMI . IBM SPSS Statistics , version 21.0 use data analysis .</detailed_description>
