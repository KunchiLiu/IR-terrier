	<brief_summary>Primary Objective : The primary objective study compare postsurgical pain control follow local infiltration analgesia ( LIA ) EXPAREL admixed bupivacaine HCl versus LIA bupivacaine HCl adult subject undergo open lumbar spinal fusion surgery . Secondary Objectives : The secondary objective study compare additional efficacy , safety , health economic outcome follow LIA EXPAREL admix bupivacaine HCl versus LIA bupivacaine HCl adult subject undergo open lumbar spinal fusion surgery .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Phase 4 , Controlled Study Adult Subjects Undergoing Primary , 1-2 Level , Open Lumbar Spinal Fusion Surgery</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This Phase 4 , multicenter , randomize , double-blind , control study approximately 220 adult subject undergoing primary , 1-2 level , open lumbar spinal fusion surgery general anesthesia . Subjects screen within 30 day prior study drug administration least one day prior surgery . During screen visit , subject assess past present neurologic , cardiac , general medical condition opinion Investigator would preclude study participation . After informed consent form ( ICF ) sign , medical history , surgical history , physical examination , 12-lead electrocardiogram ( ECG ) , vital sign measurement , clinical laboratory evaluation , urine drug screen , alcohol breath test , urine pregnancy test woman childbearing potential conduct . Study drug , approximately 1-2 mL every 1.0-1.5 cm , administer use 20- 22-gauge needle prior wound closure . Administration Instructions/Procedures Study drug inject prescribed location base area high nerve density . Study drug administer use syrinx 20- 22-gauge needle prior wound closure . The Investigator must document size incision . Each infiltration site space 1.0-1.5 cm apart deliver approximately 1-2 mL deep superficial area ( para-spinous fascia , muscle , subcutaneous layer ) . Total volume administer depended number level dissection , describe . Following infiltration , tissue visibly expand minimal leakage . Total Volume Expansion The Investigator must document total volume use surgery . 1 . Level Procedures Group 1 : EXPAREL 266 mg 20 mL + bupivacaine HCl 0.5 % 20 mL + 20 mL normal saline = total volume 60 mL Group 2 : Bupivacaine HCl 0.5 % 20 mL + 40 mL normal saline = total volume 60 mL 2 . Level Procedures Group 1 : EXPAREL 266 mg 20 mL + bupivacaine HCl 0.5 % 20 mL + 50 mL normal saline = total volume 90 mL Group 2 : Bupivacaine HCl 0.5 % 20 mL + 70 mL normal saline = total volume 90 mL Drains may use surgeon 's discretion . In addition LIA , study participant receive standardize approach manage postsurgical pain include schedule multimodal pain regimen include adjunctive analgesic , non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug ( NSAIDs ) . Rescue analgesic available need . Postsurgical clinical assessment include pain intensity score use 10-cm visual analog scale ( VAS ) overall benefit analgesia score ( OBAS ) questionnaire ; total postsurgical opioid consumption ; predefined opioid-related AEs ; nurse 's satisfaction overall analgesia . Adverse event record time ICF sign Day 30 . If cardiac AE ( e.g. , chest pain [ angina , myocardial infarction ] , abnormal/irregular heart rate [ bradycardia , tachycardia , extrasystoles ] , shortness breath ) , neurological AE ( e.g. , alter mental status/altered sensorium , dizziness , dysarthria , hyperesthesia , metallic taste , peroral numbness , seizure , tinnitus , tremor , visual disturbance , muscular twitch rigidity beyond 72 hour postdose , tingling/paresthesia beyond 72 hour postdose ) , serious AE ( SAE ) occur study 12-lead ECG , vital sign , appropriate clinical laboratory test conduct . Postsurgical health economic outcome assessment include hospital length stay ( LOS ) , use skilled nursing facility , hospital readmission , use health service follow discharge ( phone call related postsurgical pain , unscheduled visit relate postsurgical pain , visit emergency department ) Day 30 . A follow-up visit schedule subject postsurgical Day 14 . A follow-up phone call make Day 30 subject receive study drug ass adverse event ( AEs ) . Number Subjects ( Planned ) : Approximately 194 subject plan enrollment study order least 184 evaluable subject .</detailed_description>
