	<brief_summary>The incidence Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus ( T2DM ) increase day day treatment option limit child adolescent . Albiglutide , approve treatment T2DM adult population , novel analogue glucagon-like peptide-1 ( GLP-1 ) sufficiently long half-life permit week injection . The study conduct 2 part : Part A single dose pharmacokinetic ( PK ) study confirm dose safety albiglutide pediatric subject age 10 less 18 year Part B randomize double-blind placebo control study evaluate safety efficacy ( glycemic control ) albiglutide pediatric population . Treatment duration Part B 52 week ( 24 week double-blind placebo-controlled 28 week open-label subject receive albiglutide ) . Approximately 210 eligible male female subject include study .</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Between 10 less 18 year age inclusive time screen . Diagnosis T2DM HbA1c equal 7.0 % [ 53 millimole per mole ( mmol/mol ) ] less 10.0 % ( 85.8 mmol/mol ) assess screen . Currently treat regimen diet exercise without metformin . Subjects metformin monotherapy treat minimum 8 week prior randomization dose 1000 milligram per day ( mg/day ) prior document maximum tolerate dose ( MTD ) less equal 1000 mg/day . FPG le 240 mg/deciliter ( dL ) screening . Fasting Cpeptide equal 0.8 nanogram per milliliter ( ng/mL ) screening . Negative central laboratory assay Glutamic Acid Decarboxylase 65 ( GAD65 ) Islet Cell Autoantigen 512 ( ICA512 ) autoantibodies screen . Body weight equal 30 kilogram ( kg ) screening . Male subject include . Female subject achieve menarche childbearing potential must practice adequate contraception duration participation study . Signed informed consent parent legal guardian assent appropriate obtain child . Subjects Type 1 diabetes mellitus secondary diabetes mellitus ( i.e . type T2DM ) Female subject pregnant ( confirmed laboratory test ) , plan pregnancy lactate . History cancer full remission least 3 year screen . History thyroid cancer . Personal history family history thyroid medullary carcinoma multiple endocrine neoplasia type 2 ( MEN2 ) . History pancreatitis consider clinically significant risk develop pancreatitis course study ( e.g . due symptomatic gallstone ) . Severe gastroparesis within 6 month prior screen . History significant gastrointestinal ( GI ) surgery opinion investigator likely significantly affect upper GI pancreatic function . Have history least one episode diabetic ketoacidosis ( DKA ) receive antidiabetic medication . Fasting triglyceride level 750 mg/dL screening . Serum calcitonin 50 picogram ( pg/mL ) screening . Hemoglobinopathy may affect determination HbA1c . Uncontrolled hypertension screen . Estimated Glomerular Filtration Rate ( eGFR ) less 90 mL/minute/1.73 meter^2 ( calculate use Schwartz equation ) screening . ALT 2.5x upper limit normal ( ULN ) Bilirubin 1.5xULN ( isolate bilirubin 1.5xULN acceptable bilirubin fractionate direct bilirubin 35 % ) screening . Current active liver biliary disease ( exception Gilbert 's syndrome asymptomatic gallstone otherwise stable chronic liver disease per investigator assessment ) . Current previous insulin therapy use 4 week ( continuously ) 3 month prior screen . Use GLP1receptor agonist study entry study . Any oral diabetic medication , except metformin , study entry study . Use oral systemically injected glucocorticoid generally allow within 3 month randomization ; however , short course oral steroid ( single dose multiple dose 7 day ) may permit provided case discuss medical monitor . Weight loss medication . Antiretroviral drug . Known allergy serious hypersensitivity reaction albiglutide product component ( include yeast human albumin ) , GLP 1 analogue , insulin , study medication 's excipients contraindication . Any reason investigator deems subject unsuitable study may interfere trial compliance ( e.g . significant medical psychiatric history ) . The subject participate clinical trial receive investigational product device within follow time period prior first dose day current study : 30 day , 5 halflives twice duration biological effect investigational product ( whichever longer ) .</criteria>
