	<brief_summary>This study evaluate effect CYP2C19 ABCB1 gene pharmacokinetics lansoprazole child mild gastroesophageal reflux ( GER ) uncontrolled asthma . It determine genotype-guided lansoprazole dose lansoprazole improves GER asthma control .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Genotype-tailored Treatment Symptomatic Acid-Reflux Children With Uncontrolled Asthma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>BACKGROUND : Poorly control asthma especially child remain major public health problem . Many child poor asthma control experience gastroesophageal reflux ( GERD ) . The effect mild GERD asthma remain controversial despite study involve proton-pump inhibitor ( PPIs ) assess effect asthma . Past inconsistent finding regard effect PPIs asthma control may result ineffective dosing strategy proton-pump inhibitor employ study . Drug level efficacy vary widely population depend genetics . Dosing child adjust gene CYP2C19 may improve efficacy reduce side-effects lead improved asthma control . HYPOTHESIS : # 1 : The investigator hypothesize genotype-tailored lansoprazole dosing reduce asthma symptom child mild symptom GERD compare placebo . # 2 : CYP2C19 ABCB1 genetic variant influence pharmacokinetics ( drug level ) lansoprazole determine population pharmacokinetic modeling . METHODS : The investigator conduct 6-month randomized control trial compare genotype-tailored lansoprazole dose versus match placebo control asthma symptom 6-17 year old asthma mild reflux . All participant baseline pharmacokinetics analysis follow single genotype-tailored dose ass effect CYP2C19 ABCB1 . IMPACT : These result would major advance science safe dose proton-pump inhibitor child management million child struggle reflux asthma .</detailed_description>
