	<brief_summary>This phase I/II trial study best dose side effect ibrutinib give together lenalidomide dexamethasone well work treat patient multiple myeloma eligible transplant . Ibrutinib may stop growth tumor cell block enzymes need cell growth . Drugs use chemotherapy , lenalidomide dexamethasone , work different way stop growth tumor cell , either kill cell , stop dividing , stop spread . Giving ibrutinib , lenalidomide , dexamethasone may work well treat patient multiple myeloma .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Ibrutinib , Lenalidomide , Dexamethasone Treating Patients With Multiple Myeloma Ineligible Transplant</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To determine maximum tolerate dose ( MTD ) ibrutinib combine lenalidomide dexamethasone relapse multiple myeloma ( MM ) patient . ( Phase I ) II . To estimate overall response rate ( ORR ) include partial response ( PR ) good combination ibrutinib , lenalidomide , dexamethasone subject newly diagnose MM candidate high dose chemotherapy autologous stem cell transplantation ( ASCT ) . ( Phase II ) SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . To evaluate safety profile regimen relapse MM patient . ( Phase I ) II . To evaluate progression free survival ( PFS ) combination ibrutinib , lenalidomide , dexamethasone MM patient . ( Phase II ) III . To evaluate safety profile regimen untreated MM patient . ( Phase II ) IV . To evaluate duration response patient treat 3-drug regimen . ( Phase II ) V. To evaluate overall survival ( OS ) patient treat 3-drug regimen . ( Phase II ) TERTIARY OBJECTIVES : I . To explore compliance treatment . II . To assess effect treatment patient-reported quality life ( QoL ) measure . III . To determine role member BTK signalosome achievement lack thereof response ibrutinib . IV . To explore biologic effect ibrutinib microenvironment MM correlate response treatment . V. To evaluate pharmacodynamic measure include receptor occupancy BTK prior introduce lenalidomide patient treat ibrutinib dexamethasone . VI . To evaluate impact ibrutinib platelet aggregation . OUTLINE : This phase I , dose-escalation study ibrutinib follow phase II study . PHASE I : Patients receive ibrutinib orally ( PO ) day 1-28 , lenalidomide PO day 1-21 , dexamethasone PO day 1 , 8 , 15 , 22 . Treatment repeat every 28 day 24 course absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . Beginning course 25 , patient receive lenalidomide PO day 1-21 dexamethasone PO day 1 , 8 , 15 , 22 . Courses repeat every 84 day absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . PHASE II : Patients receive ibrutinib dexamethasone phase I lenalidomide PO day 1-21 begin course 2 . Beginning course 25 , patient receive lenalidomide dexamethasone phase I . After completion study treatment , patient follow every 3 month , every 6 month 3 year .</detailed_description>
