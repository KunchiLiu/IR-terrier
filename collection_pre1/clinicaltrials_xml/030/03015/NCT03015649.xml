	<brief_summary>The purpose study evaluate performance FDA-cleared SAVI SCOUT Breast Localization Surgical Guidance System ( SCOUT ) long duration prior surgery . The device non-wire system , use nonradioactive light-activated radar , provide breast surgeon real-time guidance locate remove target lesion breast and/or axillary tissue . The SCOUT device standard care use placement 30 day prior surgery assist surgeon localization retrieval breast/axillary lesion . Routine image-guided method ( Mammography , Ultrasound , CT ) use . In study , investigator assess long term placement SCOUT device extend time ( 31 - 365 day ) order address need patient require neoadjuvant treatment prior definitive surgery .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Long Term Use SAVI SCOUT : Pilot Study</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The SAVI SCOUT ( Cianna Medical , Inc. ) surgical guidance system receive 510 ( k ) U.S. Food Drug Administration ( FDA ) approval August 2014 . This system use standard care since 2015 Memorial Healthcare System ( MHS ) operating room experience breast surgeon ( 150 MHS breast cancer patient 5,000 U.S. breast cancer patient September 2016 ) . In MHS standard care practice , device place target lesion ( ) image-guidance radiologist 30 day prior surgery . Patients certain type breast cancer undergo neoadjuvant treatment biologic ( hormonal ) and/or chemotherapy goal decrease tumor volume prior definitive surgery . If original cancer lesion ( ) resolve completely , call complete pathologic response ( pCR ) . pCR even partial response , good patient , result disappearance poor visualization target often render pre-operative image-guided localization radiologist difficult less reliable . This result unintended large , disfigure breast cancer surgery . Therefore , SCOUT device place prior treatment response , lesion clearly visualize imaging , accurate image-guided target optimal thus placement subsequent surgery accurate . If pilot study demonstrate successful performance device without device-related complication , bring improve value future patient require few and/or less extensive pre-operative surgical procedure . Some value may also provide subject target tumor shrinkage expect accurate . Thus , pilot study assess performance FDA-cleared SCOUT system long duration prior breast and/or axillary lymph node surgery .</detailed_description>
