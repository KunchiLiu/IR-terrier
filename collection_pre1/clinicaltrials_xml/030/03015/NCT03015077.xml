	<brief_summary>The rapidly increase mortality incidence oral cancer become public health major problem Taiwan . To date , treatment head neck cancer mainly include surgery , radiotherapy chemotherapy . However , radiotherapy chemotherapy might influence patient ' diet cause dismal side effect , include nausea , vomit , pain , infection , dysorexia , allotriogeustia , oral ulceration dysphagia , make patient difficult absorb nutrient . In previous study , incidence malnutrition among patient cancer estimate 40 80 % , especially occur patient head neck cancer upper gastrointestinal cancer . In study , effect supplement L-Glutamine nutritional status radiation-induced toxicity head neck cancer patient evaluate improve patient ' quality life undergo radiotherapy . When head neck cancer patient undergo radiotherapy , patient ' instruction nutrient intervention L-Glutamine perform maintain patient ' nutritional status reduce patient ' diet-related side effect cause radiotherapy . It anticipate head neck cancer patient surgery radiotherapy intake L-Glutamine might decrease treatment-related side effect hence improve quality life undergo radiotherapy .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Effects Oral L-Glutamine Head Neck Cancer Patients During Radiotherapy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>1 . Written informed consent must obtain study specific procedure undertaken . 2 . The process experiment A. head neck cancer patient surgery radiotherapy identify clinic Department Dentistry Department Radiotherapy Kaohsiung Medical University Chung-Ho Memorial Hospital . B . Inform patient value clinical trial detail , make sure understand meaning procedure clinical trial . Subsequently , patient willing participate study enrol complete institutionally approve informed consent . C. In order ass effect supplement L-Glutamine nutritional status diet head neck cancer patient surgery radiotherapy , enrol patient divide two group randomly . One group supply 10 g L-Glutamine 5 g maltodextrin ; group supply 15 g maltodextrin control group . The patient two group take supplemental nutrient three time day , respectively , period time 7 day radiotherapy 14 day radiotherapy . D. Meanwhile , research assistant monitor patient ' condition carefully record daily diet , nutritional status side effect cause radiotherapy three specific time-points whole clinic trial program course . E. The monitor item patient ' nutritional status include daily diet patient radiotherapy record 24 hr recall table food frequency table , ( b ) physical examination height , weight , ideal weight , tricept skinfold ( TSF ) , mid-arm circumference ( MAC ) mid-arm muscle circumference ( MAMC ) , ( ) prognostic nutritional index ( PNI ) , ( e ) biochemistry inspection assessment ( g ) complete blood count ( CBC ) . F. The monitor item patient ' diet-related side effect cause radiotherapy include ( ) oral mucositis ( b ) neck dermatitis . G. The above-mentioned monitor item record carefully research assistant three specific time-points whole clinic trial program course , initial point ( 7 day radiotherapy ) , medium point ( medium date radiotherapy ) final point ( 14 day radiotherapy ) . H. The research assistant help patient make appointment , let visit doctor schedule . And make sure patient actually follow suggestion obey instruction clinic trial .</detailed_description>
