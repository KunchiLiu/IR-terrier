	<brief_summary>This I/II trial study side effect best dose lenalidomide give together nivolumab see well work treat patient non-Hodgkin Hodgkin lymphoma come back respond treatment . Monoclonal antibody , nivolumab , may interfere ability tumor cell grow spread . Drugs use chemotherapy , lenalidomide , work different way stop growth tumor cell , either kill cell , stop dividing , stop spread . Giving nivolumab lenalidomide may work well treat patient non-Hodgkin Hodgkin lymphoma .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Nivolumab Lenalidomide Treating Patients With Relapsed Refractory Non-Hodgkin Hodgkin Lymphoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To determine safety tolerability combination lenalidomide nivolumab patient relapsed/refractory non-Hodgkin lymphoma ( NHL ) . ( Phase I ) II . To determine maximum tolerate dose ( MTD ) recommend phase 2 dose ( RP2D ) combination lenalidomide nivolumab patient relapsed/refractory NHL . ( Phase I ) III . To evaluate feasibility toxicity combination lenalidomide nivolumab patient relapsed/refractory Hodgkin 's disease ( HD ) . ( Phase IB ) IV . To evaluate efficacy combination lenalidomide nivolumab term overall response rate patient relapsed/refractory follicular lymphoma ( FL ) diffuse large B-cell lymphoma ( DLBCL ) . ( Phase II ) SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . To evaluate efficacy combination lenalidomide nivolumab patient relapsed/refractory NHL term overall response rate ( ORR ) , duration response ( DOR ) , progression-free survival ( PFS ) overall survival ( OS ) . ( Phase I ) II . To evaluate efficacy combination lenalidomide nivolumab patient relapsed/refractory HD term complete response rate ( CR ) . ( Phase IB ) III . To evaluate efficacy combination lenalidomide nivolumab patient relapsed/refractory HD term duration response ( DOR ) , progression-free survival ( PFS ) overall survival ( OS ) . ( Phase IB ) IV . To evaluate efficacy combination lenalidomide nivolumab patient relapsed/refractory FL DLBCL term duration response ( DOR ) , progression-free survival ( PFS ) overall survival ( OS ) . ( Phase II ) TERTIARY OBJECTIVES : I . To explore relationship prognostic parameter include ki-67 staining , PD-1 stain cell origin ( activate B-cell ABC versus germinal center B-cell GCB ) ORR combination lenalidomide nivolumab patient relapsed/refractory NHL . ( Phase I ) II . To evaluate monitor effect B- , T- , natural killer ( NK ) -cell function combination lenalidomide nivolumab patient relapsed/refractory NHL . ( Phase I ) III . To explore relationship prognostic parameter include ki-67 staining , PD-1 stain cell origin ( activate B-cell ABC versus germinal center B-cell GCB ) ORR combination lenalidomide nivolumab patient relapsed/refractory FL DLBCL . ( Phase II ) IV . To evaluate monitor effect B- , T- , NK-cell function combination lenalidomide nivolumab patient relapsed/refractory FL DLBCL . ( Phase II ) OUTLINE : This phase I , dose-escalation study lenalidomide follow phase II study . Patients receive lenalidomide orally ( PO ) day 1-21 nivolumab intravenously ( IV ) 60 minute day 1 15 course 1-4 day 1 course 5-12 . Courses repeat every 28 day absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . After completion study treatment , patient follow every 3 month 2 year , every 6 month 3 year .</detailed_description>
