	<detailed_description>Gender , age , stage disease , pathologic factor retrospectively obtain electronic patient record . Staging determine accord classification establish American Joint Committee Cancer ( AJCC , 7th edition ) .Pelvic magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) use pretreatment staging . All patient enrol study treat intensity modulate radiotherapy ( IMRT ) concurrent capecitabine ( 1600 mg/m2/d , administer twice daily two week ) curative resection . The mean radiation dose 50 Gy daily fraction 2.0 Gy . Acute treatment toxicity score accord National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria Adverse Events ( CTCAE ; version 3.0 ) late toxicity classify accord Late Effects Normal Tissueâ€”Subjective , Objective , Management Analytic ( LENT-SOMA ) system . After whole treatment procedure , patient subject follow-up every three month first two year , every six month next three year , every year thereafter . Physical examination , routine blood test , serum carcinoembryonic antigen ( CEA ) Cancer Antigen 19-9 ( CA-199 ) level check follow . Chest , abdominal CT scan total colonoscopy perform annually except suspicion tumor recurrence . Overall survival ( OS ) time define date completion treatment death cause progression-free survival ( PFS ) time defined time date completion therapy date local recurrence distant metastasis death . Patient follow-up last death cutoff date January 2017.Blood sample report enrol patient obtain within seven day treatment . White blood cell count , neutrophil , lymphocyte platelet count examine . The NLR calculate absolute neutrophil count divide absolute lymphocyte count use baseline blood test result .</detailed_description>
