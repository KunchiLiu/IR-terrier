	<brief_title>Transplantation Autologous Oral Mucosal Epithelial Stem Cell Sheet Treating Limbal Stem Cell Deficiency Disease</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>A number external factor result limbal stem cell deficiency ( LSCD ) , cause pain , pathological corneal epithelium regeneration , inflammation reaction seriously visual loss . For patient unilaterally damage eye , transplantation limbal tissue healthy eye use past year risk induce limbal stem cell damage healthy eye . While graft human leukocyte antigen match allogenic limbal stem cell require immune suppressive medication , cause side effect body . Over past 10 year , clinical trial application culture autologous oral mucosal epithelial cell sheet treat LSCD emerge promise strategy many country . However , little study report China . This study investigate therapeutic effect application autologous oral mucosal epithelial cell sheet treatment limbal stem cell deficiency disease China .</detailed_description>
