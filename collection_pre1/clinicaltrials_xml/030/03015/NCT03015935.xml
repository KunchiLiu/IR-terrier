	<brief_summary>Laparoscopic surgery become popular standard many indication advancement technique . Various method use first entry abdomen . Safety , wound size , time-consuming , low cost , learn curve efficacy important . Several technique , instrument , approach minimize risk injury ( bowel , bladder , major abdominal vessel , anterior abdominal wall vessel ) introduce . There consensus yet optimal method yet emerge . The investigator aim evaluate efficacy entry method ensure safe insertion first trocar site abdomen . To evaluate efficacy entry technique , investigator use cohort patient plan laparoscopic obesity surgery . Two method commonly use surgical literature center . The investigator use visible optical-entry technique patient first entry Veress technique patient . For purpose , investigator design observational study .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Safe Easy Access Technique First Trocar Laparoscopic Obesity Surgery</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Several technique , instrument , approach minimize risk injury ( bowel , bladder , major abdominal vessel , anterior abdominal wall vessel ) introduce . These method include standard technique insufflation insertion Veress needle , open ( Hasson technique ) , direct trocar insertion optical trocar insertion . Furthermore , difficult perform obese patient , especially first trocar umbilical , like obesity surgery . This obese patient thick abdominal wall ( particularly woman ) well thick peritoneum . Very different complication , even potentially fatal , i.e. , injury viscera major intra-abdominal abdominal wall vessel , report surgical literature . Complications first entry develop 1-2 % patient half fatal complication . Major vascular abdominal organ injury rate 0.03-0.1 % 0.08-0.14 % , respectively , report . Surprisingly , little change entry technique since dawn laparoscopic surgery . Some risk factor define prediction complication , obesity . Laparoscopic obesity surgery become attractive gaining popularity , recently , however possess many complication challenge ( start ) entry abdomen .</detailed_description>
