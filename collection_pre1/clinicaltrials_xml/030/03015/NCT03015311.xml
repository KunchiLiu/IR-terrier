	<brief_summary>The Strategy Blood Pressure Intervention Elderly Hypertensive Patients ( STEP ) 2-arm , multi-center , prospective , randomize , open-labeled , blinded-endpoint trial . The purpose trial test whether treatment program aim reduce systolic blood pressure ( SBP ) low goal ( &lt; 130 mmHg , intensive treatment ) currently recommend ( &lt; 150 mmHg , standard treatment ) reduce CVD risk among person 60-80 year old . Furthermore , trial also examine effect blood pressure APP management strategy via WeChat network medication compliance , blood pressure control CVD benefit .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Hypertension highly prevalent adult population China , burden rapidly increase among person older 60 year age . Elevated blood pressure ( BP ) important public health concern contribute several adverse health outcome , especially coronary heart disease , stroke , heart failure , chronic kidney disease , decline cognitive function . Clinical trial show low systolic blood pressure goal lead great reduction cardiovascular disease ( CVD ) incidence , effect intensive treatment systolic blood pressure 120 mm Hg reduce CVD risk long debate . In particularly , among elderly hypertensive patient age 60 year old , appropriate target blood pressure lower reduce cardiovascular event still remain uncertain . The STEP trial randomize 8000 participant age 60 80 year SBP≥140 mm Hg &lt; 190 mm Hg , without history atherothrombotic hemorrhagic stroke . Target SBP goal 110-130 vs 130-150 mm Hg , respectively . The purpose STEP trial test whether treatment program aim reduce systolic blood pressure ( SBP ) low goal ( &lt; 130 mmHg , intensive treatment ) currently recommend ( &lt; 150 mmHg , standard treatment ) reduce CVD risk among hypertensive patient 60-80 year . Participants recruit approximately 40 clinic center China within approximately 1-year period , follow 4 year . Furthermore , trial also examine effect blood pressure APP management strategy via WeChat network medication compliance , blood pressure control CVD benefit .</detailed_description>
