	<brief_summary>Recent clinical study show systemic therapeutic hypothermia improve outcome patient ST segment elevate myocardial infarction ( STEMI ) receive primary percutaneous coronary intervention ( P-PCI ) .Likewise , vivo animal experiment describe method , mechanism rationale therapeutic hypothermia , include local myocardial hypothermia . However , little known local myocardial hypothermia impact prognosis patient acute myocardial infarction . The aim study ascertain whether local myocardial hypothermia effective treatment ischemia/reperfusion injury patient STEMI undergo P-PCI .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Ethics organization The study design agreement Declaration Nanjing , study protocol approve local ethic committee . A write informed consent complete inclusion . The trial coordinate monitor First Affiliated Hospital Nanjing Medical University . An independent data safety monitor board , include physician independent trial sponsor operational leadership , monitor safety study . Study population From March 2017 March 2019 , 300 patient department cardiology ( First Affiliated Hospital Nanjing Medical University , Nanjing , China ) enrol prospective , randomize , end point-blinded study evaluate local hypothermia adjunct therapy patient acute myocardial infarction ( AMI ) eligible primary percutaneous intervention ( PPCI ) . Men woman age 40 80 year present anterior non-anterior AMIs ST-segment elevation &gt; 0.2 mV 2 contiguous lead duration symptom &lt; 12h included . We collect second electrocardiogram catheterization laboratory randomization ensure persistent ST-segment elevation . We conduct exclusive criterion , include patient previous AMIs , previous PCI coronary artery bypass grafting , congestive heart failure , end-stage kidney disease hepatic failure , recent stroke , coagulopathy , pregnancy , cardiac arrest , Killip class II IV presentation . Protocol . The AMI patient randomize 1:1 hypothermia standard care coronary angiography . Using vary block size stratification , generate randomization list computer . A standard work guide-wire , Runthrough NS ( Terumo Corporation , Japan ) , advanced distal part target coronary artery determine criminal vessel use angiography . Compared standard PPCI balloon expansion , aspirate catheter ( Diver C.E . MAX , Invatec S.p.A , Italy ) firstly place location distal occlusion lesion achieve local myocardial hypothermia infuse cold saline ( 4℃ , 2.5ml/min , 5min ) . Then retract aspirated catheter , follow balloon expansion drug elute stent implanting . Subsequently , infusion catheter tautologically place location open occlusion , within stent , persistently perfuse infarct myocardium cold saline ( 4℃ , 2.5ml/min , 15min ) . Loading dose 300 mg aspirin , 180 mg ticagrelor heparin ( 100u/kg ) give patient cardiac catheterization . Glycoprotein IIb/IIIa inhibitor , bivalirudin sodium nitroprusside administer discretion treat physician . Measurements To analyze ventricular dimension , myocardium risk ( MaR ) infarct size , use postprocessing software , patient allocate undergo cardiac magnetic resonance examination core laboratory ( First Affiliated Hospital Nanjing Medical University , Nanjing , China ) . Troponin T/I , myoglobin , creatine kinase-MB sample randomization 12 24 h catheterization . We define peak value high measure value within 24 h calculate area curve measurement . N-terminal pro-brain natriuretic peptide sample dynamic electrocardiogram perform 48h admission . Clinical endpoint . Clinical event collect use clinical report form index hospital stay , 30±10 day , 12 month . Furthermore , adverse event serious adverse event reporting collect clinical endpoint . The independent monitor supervise hospital chart patient . All primary event ( death , re-infarction , target lesion revascularization , major bleed heart failure ) assess independently blind clinical event committee . Statistical analysis . Calculations statistic perform use GraphPad Prism 5.0 software ( GraphPad Software Inc , La Jolla , Calif ) . The Fisher exact test perform categorical variable . Continuous variable test use Mann-Whitney Utest exact inference . Statistical significance conduct P &lt; 0.05 .</detailed_description>
