	<criteria>Subjects must recurrent persistent endometrial carcinoma ( include : Endometrioid adenocarcinoma , serous adenocarcinoma , undifferentiated carcinoma , dedifferentiate carcinoma , clear cell adenocarcinoma , mixed epithelial carcinoma , adenocarcinoma otherwise specify ( N.O.S . ) , mucinous adenocarcinoma , squamous cell carcinoma , transitional cell carcinoma ) endometrial carcinosarcoma ) . Histologic documentation diagnosis carcinoma require . All patient must measurable disease . Measurable disease define RECIST ( version 1.1 ) . Measurable disease define least one lesion accurately measure least one dimension ( long diameter record ) . Each lesion must ≥ 10 mm measure CT , MRI caliper measurement clinical exam ; ≥ 20 mm measure chest xray . Lymph node must &gt; 15 mm short axis measure CT MRI . Patients must least one `` target lesion '' use assess response protocol define RECIST version 1.1 ( Section 8.1 ) . Tumors within previously irradiate field designate `` nontarget '' lesion unless progression document biopsy obtain confirm persistence least 90 day follow completion radiation therapy . Age ≥ 18 year life expectancy ≥ 12 week . Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group ( ECOG ) performance status 0 1 . Resolution ( nonlaboratory ) adverse effect recent surgery , radiotherapy , chemotherapy Grade ≤1 prior first study treatment ( exception alopecia neuropathy ) . Patients must one prior platinumbased chemotherapeutic regimen management endometrial carcinoma carcinosarcoma . Initial treatment may include chemotherapy , chemotherapy radiation therapy , and/or consolidation/maintenance therapy . Chemotherapy administer conjunction primary radiation radiosensitizer WILL count systemic chemotherapy regimen . Patients allow receive , required receive , one additional cytotoxic regimen management recurrent persistent disease . Hormonal therapy count toward prior regimen limit . Adequate normal organ marrow function define follow laboratory result obtain within 14 day prior first treatment : Absolute neutrophil count ( ANC ) ≥ 1.5 x 10^9/L ( &gt; 1500 per mm^3 ) Platelet ≥ 100 x 10^9/L ( &gt; 100,000 per mm^3 ) Hemoglobin ≥ 9.0 g/dL Serum bilirubin ≤ 1.5 x institutional upper limit normal ( ULN ) .

Subject willing able comply protocol duration study include undergoing treatment schedule visit examination include follow . Patients must enrol , agree consent companion genomic profiling study MSKCC IRB # 12245 . Results must available start treatment protocol . Patients must sign approve informed consent authorization permit release personal information . Involvement plan and/or conduct study ( applies AstraZeneca staff and/or staff study site ) ; Previous enrollment present study . Participation another clinical study receipt investigational product last 4 week Any previous treatment PD1 PDL1 inhibitor , include durvalumab antiCTLA4 , include tremelimumab . History another primary malignancy except : Malignancy treat curative intent know active disease ≥3 year first dose study drug low potential risk recurrence Adequately treat nonmelanoma skin cancer lentigo maligna without evidence disease Adequately treat carcinoma situ without evidence disease ( eg , cervical cancer situ ) Adequately treat stage 1 breast cancer . Receipt last dose anticancer therapy ( chemotherapy , immunotherapy , target therapy , biologic therapy , tumor embolization , monoclonal antibody ) &lt; 21 day prior first dose study drug . Receipt last dose hormonal therapy within &lt; 7 day prior first dose study drug . Any prior radiation therapy must discontinue least four week prior registration . At least 4 week must elapse since patient underwent major surgery ( e.g. , major : laparotomy , laparoscopy ) There delay treatment minor procedure ( e.g. , central venous access catheter placement ) . Mean QT interval correct heart rate ( QTc ) ≥470 m calculate 3 electrocardiogram ( ECGs ) Current prior use immunosuppressive medication within 28 day first dose durvalumab durvalumab tremelimumab , exception intranasal inhaled corticosteroid systemic corticosteroid physiological dos , exceed 10 mg/day prednisone , equivalent corticosteroid . Patients receive acute , low dose , systemic immunosuppressant medication ( e.g. , dexamethasone nausea steroid CT scan contrast premedication ) may enrol . Any prior Grade ≥3 immunerelated adverse event ( irAE ) receive previous immunotherapy agent , unresolved irAE &gt; Grade 1 Active prior document autoimmune disease within past 2 year NOTE : Subjects vitiligo , Grave 's disease , psoriasis require systemic treatment ( within past 2 year ) exclude . Active prior document inflammatory bowel disease ( e.g. , Crohn 's disease , ulcerative colitis ) History primary immunodeficiency History and/or confirm pneumonitis interstitial lung disease History allogeneic organ transplant History hypersensitivity durvalumab excipient History hypersensitivity tremelimumab Uncontrolled intercurrent illness include , limited , ongoing active infection , symptomatic congestive heart failure , uncontrolled hypertension , unstable angina pectoris , cardiac arrhythmia , active peptic ulcer disease gastritis , active bleeding diatheses include subject know evidence acute chronic hepatitis B , hepatitis C human immunodeficiency virus ( HIV ) , psychiatric illness/social situation would limit compliance study requirement compromise ability subject give write informed consent Known history previous clinical diagnosis tuberculosis History leptomeningeal carcinomatosis Receipt live attenuate vaccination within 30 day prior study entry within 30 day receive durvalumab tremelimumab . Any condition , opinion investigator , would interfere evaluation study treatment interpretation patient safety study result Symptomatic uncontrolled brain metastasis require concurrent treatment , inclusive limited surgery , radiation and/or corticosteroid . Subjects uncontrolled seizure . Patients pregnant breastfeed patient reproductive potential willing employ effective birth control screen 180 day last dose durvalumab + tremelimumab combination therapy 90 day last dose durvalumab monotherapy , whichever long time period History small large bowel obstruction within 3 month registration , include subject palliative gastric drainage catheter . Subjects palliative divert ileostomy colostomy allow symptomfree 3 month . Ongoing bowel perforation presence bowel fistula abscess within 3 month registration . Subjects refractory ascites , define ascites need drainage catheter therapeutic paracentesis often every 4 week .</criteria>
