	<brief_summary>The goal Novel Language Intervention minimally verbal child Autism Spectrum Disorder ( ASD ) test efficacy one experimental treatment ( AMMT ) compare baseline assessment compare AMMT efficacy control intervention ( SRT ) , treatment design facilitate speech output minimally verbal 5.5 12.0 year old . This study aim compare two intervention ( one intonation-based ; non-intonation-based ) single-blind , randomize control trial ( RCT ) include comprehensive baseline assessment battery , 25 intensive 1-on-1 treatment session conduct 5 days/week , series probe assessment administer multiple timepoints pre- , , post-therapy . Despite complex need minimally verbal child ASD wide variety treatment available address many need , still great need effective method promote development speech sound facilitate production sound grow population . While primary aim RCT investigate effect AMMTversus control intervention ( SRT ) minimally verbal child ASD compare two intervention determine whether one effective , study also aim examine whether baseline cognitive skill , speech praxis , joint attention ability and/or neural architecture predict effect treatment AMMT SRT minimally verbal child ASD .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The ability communicate verbally consider important prognostic indicator child ASD . If child develop speech age 5 , generally consider unlikely . Although small number case speech development old child ASD report , type intensity treatment use vary widely , suggest little consensus regard likely mechanism involve . A preliminary study test efficacy intervention employ technique orient cue , behavioral strategy , prompt facilitate speech acquisition minimally verbal child , though almost test approach child age 5 would classify preverbal rather minimally verbal . Principal Investigator Gottfried Schlaug , MD , PhD oversee aspect study treatment interventional arm Autism Center Excellence direct Helen Tager-Flusberg Boston University . The Intervention study 's main objective compare effectiveness one novel treatment minimally verbal child autism spectrum disorder ( ASD ) , Auditory-Motor Mapping Training ( AMMT ) control intervention term Speech Repetition Therapy ( SRT ) , develop pilot Dr. Schlaug 's laboratory . The aim present study test whether one treatment effective group 5 ; 5 12 ; 0 year old . Participants screen undergo several test Boston University 's ( BU ) Autism Center Excellence . Those find eligible intervention `` Testing novel speech intervention minimally verbal child ASD '' enrol undergo test BU , participate MRI scan Massachusetts General Hospital 's ( MGH ) Martinos Imaging Center , randomly assign either AMMT SRT group treatment BIDMC . Before intervention begin , participant 5 Baseline test session ( approx . 45-60 min./session ) ( 1 ) determine ability repeat set high-frequency 2-syllable words/phrases ( e.g. , Hello All do ) , ( 2 ) obtain inventory speech sound able produce prior treatment . The intervention consist 25 one-on-one therapy session child work toward produce ( approximate ) set high-frequency 2-syllable words/phrases ( e.g. , `` More , please '' , `` Mommy '' , `` All do '' , etc. ) . Progress monitor several time treatment phase well immediately 25 session 4-weeks later . The total time commitment Intervention portion study approximately 6-8 week ( i.e. , approx . 1 week ( ± ) Baseline test ; approx . 5 week ( 5 sessions/week ) treatment ; approx . 1 week ( ± ) several mid- post-treatment testing session ) . Upon completion intervention BIDMC , participant undergo post-treatment test BU follow-up MRI MGH 's Martinos Imaging Center . Results study help determine one two intervention effective compare post-treatment assessment baseline assessment also compare experimental treatment ( AMMT ) versus control treatment ( SRT ) examine whether one effective .</detailed_description>
