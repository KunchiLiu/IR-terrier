	<detailed_description>Cumulative evidence describe emergence geographical expansion azole-resistant Aspergillus fumigatus associate azole treatment failure . Multiple amino acid substitution cyp51A gene describe associate azole resistance emerge azole treatment , resistance mechanism , TR34/L98H mutation cyp51A , link agricultural use azole fungicide Europe , also widely use Taiwan year . The current prevalence azole-resistant Aspergillus isolates mechanisms azole resistance Taiwan clear . Considering potential geographic migration resistant isolate neighbor country possibility emergence locally revolve resistant strain , 2-year multi-center project aim investigate prevalence rate azole resistance Aspergillus clinical environmental isolates , determine molecular mechanism azole resistance , describe clinical characteristic treatment outcome Aspergillus diseases Taiwan . Clinical environmental Aspergillus isolates collect examined , clinical data patient Aspergillus disease colonization retrieve analyzed . Through study investigator anticipate increase awareness prevalence impact azole resistance patient safety participate hospital . In addition , investigator may update Taiwan treatment guideline aspergillosis basis evidence knowledge .</detailed_description>
	<criteria>For primary objective Patients one clinical specimen culture positive Aspergillus Is human pathogen Aspergillus clinical data available For secondary objective ( casecontrol study 1:4 ratio ) patient prove probable invasive aspergillosis Case patient : patient infect azoleresistant isolates Control patient : patient infect azolesusceptible isolates</criteria>
