	<brief_title>Effectiveness Autologous Platelet-rich Plasma Knee Cartilage Injury</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Recent study show platelet , contain large number cytokine growth factor , beneficial inflammatory response postoperative bleeding , infection , bone formation , injury , muscle strain , soft tissue heal . Platelets release plethora biologically active protein aggregate macrophage , mesenchymal stem cell ( MSCs ) osteoblasts , thereby promote degradation clear necrotic tissue , thus activate wound heal . In fact , platelet-rich plasma ( PRP ) use clinically promote cartilage repair . By retrieve Web Science , study Havva et al . report clinical use autologous PRP 82 patient advanced knee osteoarthritis good outcome . However , clinical application treatment adequately investigate randomize controlled trial . Given , additional study exact efficacy treatment indispensible . Three similar trial protocol current trial include 'Treatment Osteoarthritis Intra-articular Injection Bone Marrow Mesenchymal Stem Cells With Platelet Rich Plasma ( NCT02365142 ) ' , 'PRP vs HA Intra-articular Knee Injections Cartilage Defects ( NCT02012530 ) ' , 'Mesenchymal Stem Cells Enhanced With PRP Versus PRP In OA Knee ( MSCPRPOAK ) ( NCT01985633 ) ' . In trial protocol , knee injury extent treatment success assess Osteoarthritis Score , Western Ontario McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index ( WOMAC ) Visual Analog Scale ( VAS ) score outcome measure . However , several difference inclusion criterion randomization trial comparison current trial protocol . Since autologous PRP predominantly function relieve pain inhibit inflammatory response , clinical injection autologous PRP cartilage injury stimulate chondrocyte growth matrix metabolism . Existing evidence show autologous PRP increase type II collagen production reduce apoptosis chondrocytes combine autologous bone marrow-MSCs . Furthermore , PRP improve cartilage degeneration inhibit development osteoarthritis ( OA ) combine hydrogel microspheres . Accordingly , clinical use autologous PRP alleviate symptom OA , promote recovery motor function , ultimately improve patient quality life . To date , clinical use low-dose autologous PRP report alleviate pain injury site treatment articular cartilage injury , achieve cartilage repair proliferation release growth factor promote extracellular matrix synthesis vascular reconstruction . However , clinical application autologous PRP systemically report randomize controlled clinical trial , lead lack objective evidence effectiveness .</detailed_description>
