	<detailed_description>Back ground : Link infant feeding practice nutritional status among child well establish . Incidence malnutrition sharply rise 6-9 month age coincide period complimentary feeding ( CF ) . It report poor nutrition increase risk illness , responsible , directly indirectly , one third estimate 9.5 million death child le 5 year age . Early nutritional deficit also link long-term impairment growth health . There evidence adult malnourish early childhood impaired intellectual performance . They may also reduce capacity physical work . High proportion childhood malnutrition negative impact national development . Based evidence effectiveness intervention , achievement universal coverage exclusive breastfeeding ( EBF ) could prevent 13 % death occur child le 5 year age globally , appropriate complementary feeding practice would result additional 6 % reduction five mortality . Although huge potential EBF till 6 month age , CF practice also important maintain increase demand growth period EBF maintain optimal growth development infancy early child hood period . However , lack effort observe increase knowledge good complementary feeding practice population level . Under five child mortality still high Bangladesh . Among deaths prematurity newborn/LBW malnutrition together contribute 45 % death . Despite progress achieve , child malnutrition Bangladesh remain among high world , severe develop country . This suggest child Bangladesh suffer short-term acute shortfall food intake well longer-term under-nutrition . Exclusive breast feed quiet static ( 43 % -46 % ) last year Bangladesh around one fourth infant 6-9 month age start complementary feeding either early late . Inappropriate practice CF reflect knowledge gap population level . Mother family member usually unaware nutrition need immediately completion exclusive breast feeding practice . It report Bangladesh score 91.5/150 Young Infant Child Feeding ( YICF ) practice do International Baby Food Action Network ( IBFAN ) , Asia Pacific community outreach information support warrant much improvement . To reduce malnutrition : Comprehensive programme integrate action many front address include `` Promoting improved infant feeding practice , include breast feeding practice '' . Mothers family need support initiate sustain appropriate infant young child feed practice support person peer group recommend community level . Educational intervention CF practice show improvement several study India , china Brazil . Indian study observe feasibility CF practice promotion exist system find limited improvement infant length ( difference mean 0.32 cm , 95 % CI , 0.03 , 0.61 ) group . Brazilian study assess impact child growth nutrition counsel component Integrated Management Childhood Illnesses strategy find child 12 month age old improve weight gain ( change +.25 -.06 Z-score , respectively ) positive non-significant improvement length ( 0.40 vs. 0.12 ) . In study medical doctor use counsel applicable poor resource setting . The China study improve infant growth improve infant feeding practice . The education group infants significantly heavy long , 12 month ( weight-for-age -1.17 vs. -1.93 ; P=5 0.004 ; height-for-age -1.32 vs. 1.96 ; P =0.022 ) . But study differ exclusive breast feeding ( EBF ) duration start complimentary feeding practice recommend WHO ( EBF practice 4-6 month wean start 4 month ) . None study evaluate feed practice CF index . In early 90 's Bangladesh Rural Advancement Committee evaluate educational message CF practice WHO recommendation , Population level study CF practice promotion poor Bangladesh . Given background , lack knowledge CF practice community level high burden childhood malnutrition , plan improve complementary feeding practice Matlab . Hypothesis test : The propose study hypothesize appropriate delivery CF message community level improve CF practice subsequently decrease burden malnutrition infancy . Specific objective : The objective project evaluate effect CF practice message community health worker mother family member comparison mother family member receive CF practice message follow outcome : Reducing burden stunting , underweight waste Evaluate complementary feed index Research Design Methods : Study site : The study implement rural community Matlab sub-district Bangladesh . Matlab locate 56 kilometer southeast capital Dhaka , ICDDR , B run health demographic surveillance system ( HDSS ) population 220,000 since 1966 . In HDSS , community health research worker ( CHRWs ) collect demographic event select morbidity area monthly household visit . The study area divide two part . One ICDDR , B service area , extensive Maternal , Child Health Family Planning Programme operate strengthen government 's service since 1978 . The Government service area , population receives service government facility area Bangladesh . The ICDDR , B service area divide four block one comprise approximate 27,000 population . Each block sub-centre provide 24-hour service midwifery staff . All sub-centre field activity support hospital Matlab Township . Sub-centres comparable union level health structure government facility . The study implement ICDDR , B service area . Currently Matlab comprehensive maternal , neonatal &amp; child health ( MNCH ) programme ongoing since March 2007 . Under programme pregnancy identify CHRWs routine bimonthly household visit . Once pregnancy identify urine test , CHRWs visit woman home twice pregnancy ( 12-14 week &amp; 33-34 week pregnancy ) counsel facility-based delivery , antenatal care , birth preparedness . After delivery , CHRWs visit woman Days 0 , 3 , 7 , 28 , 45 , 75,105 180 provide additional counseling , immediate newborn care , anthropometry measurement , &amp; collect morbidity information ( Diarrhoea , Respiratory Tract infection &amp; illness well also breast feed &amp; feed status ) . The woman also visit CHRWs house immunization , family planning also Home base Life Saving Skill ( HBLSS ) training along child family member . Study Design : This randomize community intervention conduct mother-infant pair two randomly select area four block : intervention control . Implementation : The study participant ( infant complete his/her 6 month age date birth along mother ) enrol MNCH database accord criterion intervention group number control select mentioned procedure select CHRW . At begin , baseline information collect participant inform consent . All mother select infant along family member/s receive train standard complementary feeding practice respective CHRWs house . A Training manual develop accord WHO Bangladesh Breast Feeding Foundation guideline . Refresher train arrange 3 month first train CHRWs house participant . The CHRW visit infant house till he/she reach 12 month age every two month interval . Data collection : During visit CHRWs record anthropometrical measurement , detail feed information intervention comparison group . CHRWs Field Research Assistant ( FRA ) also receive train study questionnaire . Field Research Supervisors ( FRS ) include also train programme include supervision process . The socio-demographic information collect HDSS database . The recruited FRA work FRS responsible training , supervision monitoring data collection . Monitoring do standard check list . CHRWs bring questionnaire subcenter meet FRA receive send computer room Matlab reviewing questionnaire . Any inconsistency quarry check FRA help respective subcenter supervisor . Sample Size : The number woman-infant pair require calculate base study conduct earlier peer counselor . We determine sample size base 20 % difference ( base previously conduct study ) prevalence height-for-age , weight-for-age ( 40 % ) intervention control group , 5 % significance level 80 % power . With maximum 30 % lose follow total 120 pair need study arm ( intervention control ) . With design effect 1.5 , need 180 woman-infant pair arm . Data Analysis : The total observation categorize two group use baseline status . Data present mean Â± SD continuous variable proportion categorical variable . Unadjusted odds ratio exposure variable complementary feeding determine use univariate analysis . Multivariate logistic regression analysis do evaluate simultaneous effect various exposure variable adjust confound variable . A p-value &lt; 0.05 consider significance .</detailed_description>
