	<detailed_description>Endovascular approach TAAAs evolve past decade . The initial experience fenestrated branched endografts show total endovascular repair effective may reduce morbidity rate patient arch , thoracoabdominal pararenal aneurysm . The Cleveland Clinic group recently report updated clinical experience first 633 patient treat fenestrated branched endografts . Operative mortality 1.8 % pararenal , 5.2 % type I III , 2.3 % type IV TAAAs . However , 30-40 % TAAA patient remain unsuitable EVAR due unfavorable proximal neck anatomy . There also increase incidence type I proximal endoleak establish f-EVAR guideline disregard , often lead endovascular re-intervention surgical conversion . Currently , use bifurcate stent-graft infrarenal aneurysm involve iliac artery treatment receive wide distribution . The application endovascular technology treat infrarenal aneurysm commonplace implantation infrarenal endoprosthesis relatively simple procedure require adequately long proximal seal zone , diameter measurement accurate longitudinal device placement . However , design implant device , accommodate visceral branch , complex . The infrarenal unfavorable insufficient proximal neck well juxtarenal aneurysm , involve iliac artery , could treat combination Fenestrated Stent Graft Bifurcated Stent Graft . The principal limitation technology customized nature fenestrated stent-graft design . From plan delivery , process may take excess 6 week , restrict application f-EVAR stable elective patient . This procedure complex , costly implantation time quite long . It must conduct expert center sophisticated infrastructure ( hybrid room ) . Preservation visceral aortic branch require precise graft construction deployment . There report literature emergent f-EVAR , success procedure rely on-site modification commercially available endografts . Until `` off-the-shelf '' device design compatible majority patient , `` off-label '' surgeon-modified device remain option emergency open repair prohibit . The `` off-the-shelf '' device likely allow treatment 60 % 80 % patient complex aneurysm standardize design yet test clinically large number patient long follow-up In absence widely available endografts design , number center report creative technique incorporate visceral artery , `` chimney '' , `` sandwich '' , `` octopus '' , `` periscope '' physician-modified endografts . However , approach limit off-label indication , lack quality control , violation basic engineering concept questionable durability . One drawback link use parallel endografts ( mainly `` chimney technique '' ) remain imperfect seal inherent technique . This side side configuration lead gutter along parallel endografts , result type I endoleaks main body graft branch graft ; `` Gutter endoleaks '' continuously pressurize aneurysm . The gutter main aortic graft , chimney graft ( GC ) , aortic wall narrow possible avoid endoleaks , harmful -almost always- require re-intervention . Thoraco Abdominal Aneurysms involve iliac artery remain challenge EVAR . Dilatation common iliac artery ( CIA ) often leave distal land zone commercially available stent graft , maximum diameter 28 mm . Furthermore , aneurysms extend internal iliac artery ( IIA ) make endovascular repair even difficult . A common method allow endovascular treatment aneurysms occlusion IIA , thereby create distal land zone external iliac artery ( EIA ) . However , sacrifice pelvic blood flow occlude internal iliac artery often result buttock claudication impotence , well complication colonic infarction , gut spinal cord ischemia . The frequency complication vary 13 % 55 % impair quality life substantially . Successful treatment aortoiliac aneurysm involve branch vessel preservation long-term protection rupture . While EVAR totally eclipse open surgery lower mortality morbidity , durability EVAR question need re-intervention incidence late aneurysm-related complication . Notably , long-term failure arise loss proper seal proximal distal land zone stent-graft ( type I endoleaks ) . Importantly , common iliac diameter consider predictor late sac enlargement , well implantation outside Manufacturer 's Instructions For Use ( IFU ) . Furthermore , Benharash et al . manage demonstrate iliac fixation high importance prevention device migration , regardless proximal attachment type . Iliac artery involvement incidence abdominal aortic aneurysm ( AAAs ) estimate 20 30 % . Hence , nearly third patient present AAAs repair might fit within IFU standard EVAR device base iliac diameter . A common approach ensure appropriate land zone iliac component endografts involve extension external iliac artery , without concomitant hypogastric artery embolization coverage . While unilateral coil demonstrate relatively low rate complication , occlusion hypogastric artery due stent graft placement lead major complication , mention . Given significant morbidity associate complication , industry develop branch technology hypogastric preservation . The Multilayer Flow Modulator ( MFM® ) provide less complex interventional approach aortic aneurysm treatment . This device uncover , self-expanding wire mesh high radial force flexibility . It design modulate blood-flow dynamic relieve local peak wall shear stress ( PWSS ) , achieve stabilization aneurysm-sac false lumen pressure preserve side-branch patency . The clinical benefit technology assess show case report clinical study thoracoabdominal aneurysm , type B dissection , pararenal aortic aneurysm peripheral artery aneurysm ( celiac , hepatic , renal , iliac , subclavian ) ( 48-79 ) . Also prospective multicenter registry peripheral visceral aneurysm ( 69 ) prospective multicenter STRATO Trial TAAA ( 78 ) , show good result 12-month follow-up . The MFM® eliminate flow vortex pressure laminate outside device along aneurysm wall direction blood stream . Laminated flow posse unique protective effect endothelial cell well ability promote thrombus progressive formation within aneurysmal sac . The MFM® address issue unique fashion , provide uniform interface artery wall blood flow , favorable compliance mean device subject drag force conventional stent graft undergo.. Laminating blood flow within aneurysm , promote thrombus formation within aneurysmal sac re-establishing favorable biochemical biomechanical balance endothelial homeostasis , MFM® address aneurysm related issue outcome novel manner . With aneurysmal stabilization thrombosis , MFM® exclude aneurysm circulation rather physically physiologically mechanically , conventional graft . Thanks intrinsic porosity device , branch keep patent well perfuse , thus abolish risk collateral occlusion consequent ischemia . STREAMLINER study international , multicentre , prospective , non-randomized study . It design evaluate safety efficacy BMFM® kit use . Approximately 40 patient , 12 centre Europe , Israel , Morocco , Bahrain Turkey , enrol screen per protocol-required inclusion , exclusion criterion , order obtain 30 complete patient . The result compare published result treatment modalities literature . Patients include obtain fully inform consent , conduct pre-operative examination require , respect inclusion exclusion criterion . For early demonstration efficacy safety interim analysis perform 10 first enrolled patient complete 6 month follow-up .</detailed_description>
