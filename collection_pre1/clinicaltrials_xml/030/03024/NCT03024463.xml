	<brief_summary>In addition axillary lymph node ( ALN ) , internal mammary lymph node ( IMLN ) chain also first-echelon nodal drainage site metastasis provide important prognostic information breast cancer patient . However , decision local treatment IMLN still make base ALN status . The 2016 National Comprehensive Cancer Network Guidelines recommend internal mammary lymph node irradiation patient 4 positive ALNs ( category 1 ) , strongly consider irradiation patient 1 3 positive ALNs ( category 2A ) . Therefore , patient positive ALN subgroup face complication unnecessary radiation IMLN patient negative ALN subgroup receive adjuvant radiation therapy really need . Thus , inclusion criterion National Comprehensive Cancer Network might lead over-treatment under-treatment . Internal mammary sentinel lymph node biopsy ( IM-SLNB ) provide less invasive method assess IMLN surgical dissection . However , low visualization rate IM-SLN restriction IM-SLNB . A modified radiotracer injection technique establish previous study . This technique could significantly improve IM-SLN detection rate . The investigator validate accurate hypothesis modify radiotracer injection technique previous study . Recently , investigator propose IM-SLN metastatic lymph node would positive node else IMLN chain , radiotherapy associate complication could avoid patient . On hand , presence metastatic non-sentinel lymph node ( NSLN ) IMLN chain IM-SLNB , important predict risk IM-NSLN metastasis IM-SLN positive patient . As currently model , predictive model IM-SLN positive patient avoid radiotherapy need situation . Therefore , new study conduct verify issue . In current study , participant ( 18~70 year age ) would preoperative pathology invasive breast cancer positive fine-needle aspiration result clinical ultrasonic suspicious axillary lymph node . 99mTc-labeled sulfur colloid inject parenchyma ultrasound guidance 3 18 hour surgery . Two syrinx 9.25 18.5MBq 99mTc-labeled sulfur colloid 0.5 0.7mL volume inject 6 12 o'clock position 0.5 1.0 cm areola ( 2.0~4.0 cm nipple ) . IM-SLNB perform participant IMSLN visualize preoperative lymphoscintigraphy and/or detect intra-operative gamma probe . All hotspot internal mammary basin harvest intra-operative identification IM-SLN base gamma probe detection . The IM-SLN section along long axis two block block test frozen section touch imprint cytology intra-operatively . Those participant positive intra-operative result receive IMLN dissection . Finally , IM-SLN block IM-NSLN dissect assessed post-operatively H &amp; E Cytokeratin 19 stain immunohistochemistry . The conclusion would draw result mention .</brief_summary>
