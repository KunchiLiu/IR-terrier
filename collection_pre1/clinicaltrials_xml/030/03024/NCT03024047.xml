	<brief_summary>Background : Disturbances heart 's atrioventricular conduction - AV-block - may show shortness breath , faint sudden death . If AV-block diagnose time pacemaker therapy may lifesaving . AV-block younger see along structural ischemic heart disease , congenital heart disease ( incl . congenital AV-block ) storage disorder , specific muscle disease , sarcoidosis , Borrelia infection drug intoxication . AV-block younger also see condition , primarily localize AV-node without cardiac disease diagnosis . This form AV-block often hereditary see family relatives another type heart disease form fore example , cardiomyopathy , ion channel disease sudden death . The different form presentation due gene mutation express differently within family . Thus , early onset AV-block ( &lt; 50 year ) may indicate hereditary AV-conduction disorder also first manifestation severe ion channel disease cardiomyopathy . Denmark annually 50 individual &lt; 50 year treat pacemaker due advance AV-block . There overall figure regard cause advance AV-block , therefore systematic approach diagnose group patient . Furthermore , prevalence individual genetic cause AV-block unknown presumably often overlooked diagnosis among young patient advance AV-blok . There data disease progression diagnosis , therefore evidence-based knowledge patient follow diagnosis . With modern gene technology , range new , yet unknown gene potentially pathogenic mutation likely identify . Identification gene , development strategy systematic approach diagnose young patient AV-block , enable presymptomatic genetic screening relative implementation evidence-based , preventive treatment pacemaker and/or medical treatment heart failure base specific genetic predisposition development AV-block without heart failure . Hypotheses : In significant proportion young patient advance AV-block underlie cause unknown . Objective : To investigate prevalence cause advance AV-block younger patient Denmark describe current diagnostics . Method : The study cross sectional study . The patient study identified Danish Pacemaker ICD Register . The investigator review medical record obtain clinical information test result ( see detailed description ) . Perspectives : This study first part large study AV-block younger patient Denmark . The overall goal , increase knowledge cause disease progression diagnosis advance AV-block young patient could lead significant improvement treatment patient group may lead customized choice pacemaker type future perhaps additional medical treatment patient group . This could potentially lead reduction morbidity mortality .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Method : The follow covariates report . Date diagnosis AV-block : The date diagnosis define day physician diagnose AV-block . E.g . patient Holter monitoring perform , date diagnosis dag monitoring review . Reported : Day-month-year Comorbidity day first pacemaker implant : Registered one following : 1 . Diabetes 2 . Hypertension 3 . Hypercholesterolemia 4 . Heart failure 5 . Atrial fibrillation flutter 6 . Ischemic heart disease 7 . Sarcoidosis 8 . Connecting tissue disorder 9 . Other Smoking status day first pacemaker implant : Registered : Current , former , never Device select first pacemaker implant : Registered : DDD , CTR , etcetera Genetic investigation : Is perform genetic investigation due find AV-block ? Investigation must initiate maximum 4 week day first pacemaker implant . Registered : y/n . Date first pacemaker implant : Registered : Day-month-year Implant sight ECG 12 description : ECG 12 must take maximum one week day first pacemaker implant Registered : Bpm. , RBBB y/n , LBBB y/n , PR msec , QRS msec , QT msec , QTc msec ( Frederica ) Implant indication : Registered one following : 1 . First-degree atrioventricular block symptom 2 . Mobitz type 1 symptom 3 . Mobitz type 2 4 . Advanced second-degree atrioventricular block 5 . Third-degree atrioventricular block 6 . Unknown The malignant chosen report intermittent persistent . Symptoms : Registered one following : 1 . Dyspnoea 2 . Fatigue 3 . Malaise 4 . Dizziness 5 . Syncope 6 . Angina 7 . Cardiac arrest 8 . No symptoms Echocardiography : Performed maximum two week day first pacemaker implant The report value echocardiographer describes . Registered : LVEF % ( value 60 % report &gt; 60 % ) Hypertrophy LV y/n Dilatation LV y/n Dilatation LA y/n Valvular disease/artificial valve y/n Coronary angiography : At day first pacemaker implant +/- 4 week Registered : Normal y/n Significantly disease LAD y/n Significantly disease RCA y/n Significantly disease CX y/n Significantly disease = lead CABG , PCI antithrombotic treatment</detailed_description>
