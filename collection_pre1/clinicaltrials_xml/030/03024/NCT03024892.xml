	<detailed_description>Back Ground : Laparoscopic cholecystectomy ( LC ) one common procedure do minimal invasive surgery worldwide common bile duct ( CBD ) injury still happen even existence standard technique grow experience new technology , especial cholecystitis . Image guide surgery create new concept fluorescent cholangiography demonstrate anatomy CBD use indocyanine green ( ICG ) intravenous injection operation decrease complication . The result positive border gallbladder ca n't see well systemic injection . In cholecystitis , border gallbladder common bile duct important well CBD cystic duct . Purpose : The investigator hypothesize injection ICG gallbladder directly helpful identify cystic duct , CBD border gallbladder well systemic injection . The purpose study evaluate feasibility image guide surgery Study Design : The investigator collect pre-operative medical history arrange physical examination , life quality evaluation , blood biochemical test . The Patients acute cholecytitis , gallstone gallbladder polyp without interventional treatment cholecystitis percurtaneus gallbladder drainage ( PTGBD ) involve study . Four laparoscopic port introduce pneumoperitoneum ( 12mmHg ) establish . In study group , ICG give intra-gallbladder injection systemic injection , cholecystectomy perform . In control group , ICG give traditional cholecystectomy perform . A near-infrared optimized laparoscope use detect ICG fluorescence signal arise gallbladder , cystic duct common bile duct cholecystectomy study group . According enhancement ICG , cholecystectomy start cystic duct Calot 's triangle . Time gallbladder remove record . Conversion rate , post-operative morbidity mortality record well . The investigator intend collect 600 patient . 150 patient receive ICG injection via gallbladder image guide surgery , 150 patient receive ICG injection via systemic injection image guide surgery , 300 patient refuse control group ( 150 patient LC 150 patient LC + intra-operative cholangiography ) . Expected result A . Publish Intra-gallbladder indocyanide green injection via drainage route facilitate cholecystectomy acute cholecystitisã€‚ B . Publish Comparison systemic intra-gallbladder injection indocyanide green benefit cholecystectomy C. Extend publish Near-infrared cholangiography decrease learn curve laparoscopic cholecystectomy medical student D. Near- infrared laparoscope education textbook clinical case analysis</detailed_description>
