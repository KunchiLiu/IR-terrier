	<brief_summary>The mechanism Upper airway obstruction ( UAO ) anesthesia share many similarity upper airway obstruction observe obstructive sleep apnea ( OSA ) . Nasal continuous positive airway pressure ( nCPAP ) via nasal mask ( NM ) maintain airway patent near 100 % success patient OSA . Obesity major risk factor obstructive sleep apnea obese patient higher prevalence UAO anesthesia . The investigator hypotheses nCPAP eliminate airway obstruction obese patient anesthesia . The investigator propose test hypothesis determine efficacy nCPAP maintain airway patency obese patient require general anesthesia compare CPAP administer face mask .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Upper airway obstruction ( UAO ) unpredictable frequently occur complication induction general anesthesia . Since obese patient vulnerable develop airway obstruction either sleep1 anesthesia , segment obese individual entire population keep growing , difficult airway management anesthesia become even challenging ever . The serious event relate difficult airway management anesthesia `` intubate , ventilate '' . The mechanism UAO anesthesia well understood . Obese patient high-risk group perioperative airway catastrophe prone develop progressively narrow pharyngeal airway due increase soft tissue volume surround pharyngeal airway . The mechanism UAO anesthesia share many similarity upper airway obstruction observe obstructive sleep apnea ( OSA ) . Nasal continuous positive airway pressure ( nCPAP ) via nasal mask ( NM ) maintain airway patent near 100 % success patient OSA . Obesity major risk factor obstructive sleep apnea obese patient higher prevalence UAO anesthesia . Therefore , investigator hypotheses nCPAP eliminate airway obstruction obese patient anesthesia . The investigator propose test hypothesis determine efficacy nCPAP maintain airway patency obese patient require general anesthesia .</detailed_description>
