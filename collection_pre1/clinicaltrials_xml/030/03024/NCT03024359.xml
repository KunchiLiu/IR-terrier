	<brief_summary>Considering high prevalence obesity comorbidities Brazil world , different therapeutic measure suggest . It currently know brown/beige adipose tissue play important role body weight control strong evidence activity inversely associate obesity metabolic disease . Recent study show important role food nutrient activation brown/beige adipose tissue , almost exclusively animal model . The benefit monounsaturated fatty acid metabolism describe several study , however , effect consume large amount olive oil activity brown/beige adipose tissue human explore . The aim study evaluate impact consumption large amount extra virgin olive oil activity brown/beige adipose tissue lean obese human . This clinical trial total duration 4 week . Obese control ( normal weight ) participant undergo dietary intervention 4 week extra virgin olive oil . Before intervention period several data collect : dietary intake physical activity data , evaluation brown/beige adipose tissue ( 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography magnetic resonance image - PET/RMI ) , assessment body composition ( DXA ) , lipid profile inflammatory marker well hypothalamic inflammation ( functional magnetic resonance imaging ) brown adipose tissue biopsy subsample 20 participant . The data express mean standard deviation variable compare Student test ANOVA repeat measure .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>1 . HYPOTHESIS The effect fatty acid consumption brown / beige adipose tissue yet explore human . However , study evaluate effect saturate fatty acid replacement monounsaturated fatty acid ( MUFAs ) polyunsaturated fatty acid ( PUFAs ) animal human model observe improvement cardiovascular risk factor , reduction subclinical inflammation , improvement lipid profile increase insulin sensitivity . The mechanisms fatty acid act improvement risk factor completely clarify possible association reduction cardiovascular risk factor activation brown / beige adipose tissue . Our hypothesis consume extra virgin olive oil high amount one month promote increase brown adipose tissue ( BAT ) activity participant improve cardiovascular risk profile , assess inflammatory marker . It possible response lean obese subject dietary intervention different behavior BAT equal group . 2 . OBJECTIVE To evaluate impact consumption large amount extra virgin olive oil ( source monounsaturated fatty acid ) activity brown / beige adipose tissue lean obese human . 2.1 Specific objective - To investigate activity brown beige adipose tissue FDG PET / RMI , four week intervention high amount extra virgin olive oil ; - To evaluate expression BAT activity marker : uncoupling protein 1 ( UCP-1 ) , PR domain contain 16 ( PRDM16 ) , Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma coactivator 1-alpha ( PGC-1α ) , iodothyronine deiodinase 2 ( Dio2 ) mononuclear cell whole sample ; - To evaluate level fatty acid blood gas chromatography , intervention evaluate change fatty acid intake ; - To evaluate concentration pro anti-inflammatory cytokine blood 4 week intervention : tumor necrosis factor alpha ( TNF-α ) , interleukin 1-beta ( IL1β ) , Monocyte Chemoattractant Protein-1 ( MCP-1 ) , interleukin-6 interleukin-10 ) ; - To evaluate effect intervention metabolic marker intervention : leptin , insulin , glucose , total cholesterol fraction , triglyceride ; - To evaluate effect intervention anthropometry ( weight , abdominal circumference ) body composition evaluate Dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry ( DXA ) ; - To evaluate effect dietary intervention hypothalamic inflammation ( magnetic resonance imaging ) subsample 20 individual . - Evaluate expression marker BAT activity ( UCP-1 , PRDM16 , PGC-1α , Dio2 ) brown adipose tissue sub-sample ( 20 people ) . 3 . MATERIALS AND METHODS This open clinical trial last four week . The study consist two 4-week interval data collection participant required consume extra-virgin olive oil provide researcher . The collection socio demographic , dietary physical activity data , well PET / RMI blood collection sixty eighty participant carry Nuclear Medicine Center Medical School University São Paulo . Bone densitometry ( DXA ) perform School Public Health University São Paulo . The 20 participant ( perform functional MRI brown adipose tissue biopsy ) select University Campinas . Selection participant : The estimated number individual detectable brown adipose tissue ( 80 ) 50 % , proportion individual detectable brown adipose tissue . It include 40 obese individual ( degree I obesity ) 40 control subject ( normal weight individual ) . Participants select print electronic medium . • Inclusion criterion For group obesity : Both gender , age 25 40 year , BMI ≥ 30 &lt; 35 kg / m2 . For normal weight group ( control ) : Both sex , age 25 40 year , BMI &lt; 25 kg / m2 . - Exclusion Criteria 1 ) Residing outside São Paulo / Campinas ; 2 ) pregnant woman ; 3 ) patient severe non-stabilized neurological psychiatric problem ; 4 ) use anti-obesity lipid-lowering medication ; 5 ) use adrenergic benzodiazepine drug ; 6 ) individual neoplasms , transmissible rheumatic disease , hepatic renal insufficiency , untreated thyroid dysfunction ; Diabetes mellitus ; 7 ) change 5 % body weight last six month ; 8 ) carry kind diet modification usual dietary pattern ; 9 ) metal prosthesis . - Design This open clinical trial total duration four week . Obese participant control randomized dietary intervention 4 week extra virgin olive oil ( MUFA rich ) . Extra-virgin olive oil ( 2 liter ) provide participant require consume preparation four week . Before intervention period follow data collect : - Food consumption : 24-hour recall ( dietary intervention ) 3-day food diary ; physical activity data : International Physical Activity Questionnaire ( IPAQ ) ; - Evaluation brown / beige adipose tissue : Positron emission tomography fluoride-18-labeled fluorodeoxyglucose ( FDG-18F ) combination magnetic resonance ( PET / MRI ) . O For FDG PET / RMI participant allocate room control temperature ( 19 degree ) , light clothes cool vest 2 hour . In group take exam University Campinas ( 20 participant ) , biopsy brown adipose tissue perform supraclavicular portion . The biopsy perform follow protocol described literature coordinate medical professional . Body composition assessment : - Weight ( digital scale ) height ( fixed stadiometer ) ; - Abdominal circumference ; - Body composition : Dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry ( DXA ) ; - Biochemical dosage : plasma glucose , triglyceride , total cholesterol HDL-c determine routinely inflammatory marker determine enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay ( ELISA ) ; - Expression UCP-1 , PGC-1α , PRDM16 Dio2 perform Real-Time Polymerase chain reaction ( RT-PCR ) ; - Composition fatty acid plasma determine gas chromatography ; - Hypothalamic inflammation : It perform subsample 20 individual University Campinas functional magnetic resonance imaging . - Statistical analysis Data express mean standard deviation variable compare Student 's t-test ANOVA repeat measure .</detailed_description>
