	<brief_summary>This study assess immunomodulatory activity entinostat patient advance renal cell carcinoma receive PD-L1 inhibitor atezolizumab . The overall hypothesis entinostat increase immune response anti-tumor effect induce PD-L1 inhibition suppress Treg function . We choose renal cell carcinoma report respond PD1/PD-L 1 inhibition . The schedule entinostat base previous experience agent . Based work hypothesis low dose HDAC inhibitor suppressive function Tregs T effector cell , start dose entinostat 1 mg escalate 5 mg rather 10 mg dose . The combination also bevacizumab provide effective VEGF inhibition may potentiate immune response anti-tumor effect induce atezolizumab . The propose dose schedule atezolizumab bevacizumab show well tolerate prior Phase/I/II study currently test Phase III randomize study patient renal cell carcinoma sunitinib control arm . The high propose dose level entinostat ( 5 mg ) represent 50 % recommend Phase II dose compound single agent .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Atezolizumab Combination With Entinostat Bevacizumab Patients With Advanced Renal Cell Carcinoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This Phase l/II , open-label , safety , pharmacodynamics efficacy study atezolizumab combination entinostat bevacizumab patient advance renal cell carcinoma . This clinical study compose Dose Finding Phase ( Phase I ) two-stage Dose Expansion Phase ( Phase II ) ( i.e . Phase II Stage I &amp; Phase II Stage II ) . In Phase 1 , patient treat oral entinostat every 7 day , bevacizumab fix dose 15 mg/kg IV every 3 week atezolizumab fix dose 1200 mg IV every 3 week . Each cycle length 21 day . Three dose level entinostat test 3-patient cohort accord 3 + 3 standard design ( level 1 = 1 mg , level 2 = 3 mg level 3 = 5 mg ) . The 5 mg dose represent 50 % recommend entinostat dose single agent . For Phase I , start dose level entinostat 1 mg PO every 7 day . The first dose level minimum 3 patient treat ( unless first 2 patient experience dose limit toxicity ( DLTs ) 3rd patient enrol . DLTs define grade ≥ 3 hematological/non hematological toxicity attributable entinostat and/or bevacizumab atezolizumab first 21 day combination treatment . If DLTs occur 1 patient treat start dose level , minimum 3 additional patient treat dose level . If DLTs occur 1 patient first 6 patient , study terminate . If DLT occur 1/6 patient , dose level 1 consider Recommended Phase II Dose ( RP2D ) . If DLTs occur start dose level 1 , 3 additional patient treat next dose level ( level 2 ) . If DLTs occur dose level 2 , 3 additional patient treat next dose level ( level 3 ) . If DLTs occur dose level 3 , dose level recommend Phase II portion study . Patients experience grade ≥ 3 toxicity recover ≤ grade 1 ( pretreatment baseline level toxicity ) may continue treatment next low level . The Phase II dose RP2D entinostat ( i.e. , high test dose declare safe tolerable Investigators Sponsor ) . Once RP2D identify , Phase II portion ( Simon 's two stage design ) open . During Phase II , study run-in period entinostat one cycle follow atezolizumab bevacizumab second cycle , combination phase ( i.e. , atezolizumab + bevacizumab + entinostat cycle thereafter ) . The reason run-in period Phase II obtain data immunomodulatory effect entinostat separately bevacizumab atezolizumab . In Phase II Stage I , 32 patient prior treatment enrol two - Phase II cohort : 18 treatment naïve ( anti-PD1 naïve ) patient ( Cohort A ) 14 anti-PD1 resistant ( defined patient PD1 inhibitor least 6 month progress either clinical radiographic assessment ) patient ( Cohort B ) . If ≥ 5 response observe Cohort A , Stage II conduct 15 additional patient . Cohort B pilot arm aim test atezolizumab anti-PD1 resistant patient . If response atezolizumab , RP2D dose entinostat added standard dose atezolizumab . If response atezolizumab , patient continue treat atezolizumab alone . The RP2D dose entinostat , atezolizumab , bevacizumab combination choose clinical development . Further experience Phase II may result RP2D dose low maximum tolerate dose . Objectives : 1 . Primary Phase I : To assess safety tolerability atezolizumab combination entinostat bevacizumab patient advance renal cell carcinoma . 2 . Primary Phase II : To assess objective response rate atezolizumab combination entinostat bevacizumab anti-PD 1 naïve patient atezolizumab combination entinostat anti-PD 1 resistant patient advance renal cell carcinoma . 3 . Secondary : To assess objective response rate ( Phase I ) , progression-free survival overall survival . 4 . Correlative : To characterize PD-L1/2 , immune cell subset , miRs tumor and/or blood correlation response .</detailed_description>
