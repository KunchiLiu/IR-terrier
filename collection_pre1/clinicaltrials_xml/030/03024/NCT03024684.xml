	<detailed_description>This multi-center double-blind randomize placebo-controlled trial . A total 240 patient HCC BCLC stage 0 A enrol 8 hospital Taiwan . After complete ablation hepatic resection tumor ( ) , participant randomize 1:1 receive either atorvastatin 10mg daily ( intervention group ) match placebo ( control group ) 3 year . During 3-year period , patient monitor recurrence HCC dynamic compute tomography ( magnetic resonance image ) every 4 month .
