	<detailed_description>Introduction : Globally 2014 , antiretroviral therapy ( ART ) coverage rate amongst child 32 % 41 % adult , Cameroon gap even wide ( 10.4 % % vs 28 % ) . Identifying link child care key barrier effective expansion pediatric ART resources-limited setting . To identify HIV-infected child enroll positive case care , World Health Organization ( WHO ) recommend 2007 , provider-initiated-testing counseling ( PITC ) strategy . The blanket PITC ( bPITC ) , whereby child consult health facility screen HIV require lot resource term HIV test kit supply addition increase workload already overburden health personnel resource-limited setting . Conversely , target PITC approach ( tPITC ) child bear HIV-infected parent offer HIV test counsel seem feasible effective . The primary objective study ass effectiveness tPITC comparison bPITC case detection HIV-infected child adolescent . The secondary objective ass acceptability feasibility tPITC comparison bPTIC among child adolescent Cameroon . Methods : Design : The investigator conduct 3 health facility non-randomized control pragmatic trial compare effectiveness target ( intervention arm ) blanket PITC ( control arm ) case find linkage HIV-infected child adolescent HIV treatment . Study population : For intervention arm , study population child adolescents 6 week 19 year bear HIV-infected parent control arm child age group seek care hospital irrespective motive consultation . Procedure : The study implement Limbe Regional Hospital ( South West Region ) , Abong-Mbang District Hospital ( East Region ) Ndop District Hospital ( North West Region ) Cameroon period 36 month . Prior conduct study , health facility staff train PITC implementation . Testing kit supply make available site . Enrolment 2 arm do simultaneously till completion sample size . The HIV test ART eligibility assessment do follow national guideline . Sample size calculation : Based result pilot target PITC , believe implementation , yield newly diagnose HIV case amongst child least equal double yield blanket PITC ( control arm ) health facility . Therefore , investigator calculate sample size detect minimum effect intervention group equal least double yield control arm . Computing formula sample size calculation 2 independent sample , obtain sample size 435 child per arm . Hence total sample size 870 child . Data collection , management analysis : Socio-demographic data child parent , HIV status ART eligibility , linkage care HIV treatment outcome collect use standardize pre-tested questionnaire . A database develop Microsoft Access data entry . Data entry do progressively till study sample size attain . Data analysis do use SPSS software finding report use descriptive analytical statistic . Ethical consideration : Parents ' inform consent child ' assent require enrollment study . The study obtain ethical clearance prior implementation . Outcome : This study ass effectiveness target PITC case identification linkage HIV-infected child care/treatment . This new knowledge could use reduce current global gap pediatric adolescent HIV treatment .</detailed_description>
