	<brief_summary>The purpose clinical study evaluate safety efficacy BonoFill-II autologous bone-regenerating graft reconstruction deficient bone two clinical indication : 1 . Long bone extra-articular comminuted fracture 2 . Large bone defect gap incapable self-regeneration</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Enhancement Bone Regeneration Healing Extremities Use Autologous BonoFill-II</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Primary Endpoint : To establish transplantation BonoFill-II bone defect/gap safe following condition : - No treatment-related appearance heterotrophic bone ossification - No excessive bone formation transplantation sit - No abnormality treat site Secondary Endpoint : To establish transplantation BonoFill-II bone defect/gap effective following condition : 1 . Long bone extraarticular comminute fracture : - Enhancement fracture heal considerably faster common time period know clinical condition least two third treat subject . 2 . Large bone defect gap incapable self-regeneration : - A newly form bone tissue generate within bone gap re-establishes bone continuity least two third treat subject .</detailed_description>
