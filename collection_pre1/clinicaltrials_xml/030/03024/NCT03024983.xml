	<brief_summary>Carbohydrate-based product influence post-prandial glycemic response differently base ability digest , absorbed affect rise plasma glucose . Pasta one major carbohydrate-rich food consume Italy . Studies literature describe low glycemic response consumption pasta compare wheat-based product , bread . Among factor affect post-prandial glycemia consumption carbohydrate-based product , technological process represent central one.In fact , different technological process alter food matrix affect post-prandial metabolism glucose differently . Thus , present study aim investigate effect induce principal step process pasta production reduction post-prandial glycemic response ( post-prandial glucose , insulin , GLP-1 , GIP plasma concentration ) .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The different glycemic response consumption carbohydrate-based product associate different rate digestion absorption carbohydrate human body . Therefore , food product rich carbohydrate classify base ability digest , absorbed affect post-prandial glycemia . Epidemiological study suggest follow diet include carbohydrate-based food induce low slow glycemic response associate reduce risk develop non-communicable disease ( type 2 diabetes ( Livesey et al , 2013 ; Dong et al , 2011 ) cardiovascular disease ( Ludwig , 2002 ; Blaak et al , 2012 ) ) , control inflammatory status ( Ma et al , 2012 ; Sieri et al , 2010 ) , trigger several pathology , reduce fast insulin ( Schwingshackl &amp; Hoffmann , 2013 ) . Depending food composition , low glycemic response always associate low plasma insulin concentration . For instance , high protein lipid concentration food matrix demonstrate induce low post-prandial glycemic response , reduction insulin secretion ( Gannon et al , 1988 ; Gannon et al , 1993 ; Collier et al . 1988 ) . Avoiding high insulin post-prandial response consumption food represent preventive factor risk overweight hyperlipidemia ( Ostlund et al , 1990 ) , type 2 diabetes ( Weyer et al , 2001 ) , cancer ( Onitilo et al , 2014 ) . Therefore , evaluation glycemic insulinemic post-prandial response curve necessary order demonstrate true beneficial effect consumption low glycemic index food . Among several factor influence post-prandial glycemic insulinemic response ( macronutrient composition cook process ) , technological aspect food produce represent important one . Several study report low glycemic response consumption pasta compare bread ( Jenkins et al , 1988 ; Jenkins et al , 1981 ; Wolever et al , 1986 ) , due technological structure characterize two matrix ( Petitot et al , 2009 ) . Pasta one major source carbohydrates consumed Italy . Therefore , aim present study investigate effect pasta durum wheat base product plasma response glucose , insulin , hormone relate glucose metabolism ( c-peptide , GLP-1 GIP ) order clearly discriminate different biological effect induce technological process production pasta , compare food begin ingredient . Moreover , study aim create solid basis future study evaluate effect pasta consumption , main source carbohydrate , context balance diet , maintain health .</detailed_description>
