	<brief_summary>In propose study , investigator look conduct prospective , randomised , double-blind , non-inferiority trial , study single-shot pectoral plane ( PECs ) block versus continuous local anaesthetic infusion analgesia versus combination PECs block local anaesthetic infusion analgesia , come provide analgesia form breast surgery . Breast surgery common , optimal form analgesia currently unknown . Techniques involve local anaesthetic , pectoral plane ( PECs ) block infusion pump , grow popularity , reduce amount opioid medication use . Opioids associate nausea , vomit , low blood pressure , drowsiness constipation , , opioid-sparing analgesic regimen postoperatively become common . These regimen typically involve paracetamol , NSAID ( non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug ) , local anaesthetic technique . Pectoral plane block involve once-off injection local anaesthetic two location within chest wall , typically do patient undergo general anaesthesia , commencement surgery . Local anaesthetic infusion pump involve insertion catheter wind end surgery , patient emerge general anaesthesia , constantly emit local anaesthetic define period time . Each technique consider extremely safe , consider acceptable form pain relief patient undergo breast surgery . There publish work compare pectoral plane block local anaesthetic infusion pump analgesia , investigator see gap knowledge base address . This study allow efficacy , safety cost three technique compare . The investigator feel study design robust , statistical analysis base previously publish work area postoperative analgesia allow study power appropriately . Patients undergo breast surgery vulnerable group , recognise via provision comprehensive Patient Information Leaflet commitment respect process Informed Consent . The investigator also recognise stressful period woman 's life , study conduct sensitive compassionate manner . The study design prospective , randomised , double-blinded . The anaesthetic standardised relation analgesic anti-emetic agent administer , order minimise variable . Chronic post-surgical pain grow area research , follow-up telephone interview 3-months allow investigation . A Data Record Form utilise data collection , subsequently analyse statistically . Data handle sensitively , securely , minimum number researcher . A plan place destruction data appropriate time . While direct benefit participant , include monetary consideration , research study add knowledge-base surround analgesia breast surgery .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Single-shot Pectoral Plane ( PECs ) Block Versus Continuous Local Anaesthetic Infusion Analgesia Both PECS Block Local Anaesthetic Infusion After Breast Surgery : A Randomised , Double-blind , Non-inferiority Trial</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Title ; Single-shot pectoral plane ( PECs ) block versus continuous local anaesthetic infusion analgesia PECs block local anaesthetic infusion breast surgery : A randomised , double-blind , non-inferiority trial . Background &amp; Rationale ; Pectoral Plane block ( PECs ) block I II chest wall anaesthesia analgesia recently describe seem gaining popularity . PECs block provide superior analgesia compare placebo , therefore reduce need opioid analgesia relate side-effects postoperative nausea vomiting . However , dearth evidence base research efficacy , safety cost compare effective , establish chest wall analgesic technique , paravertebral local anaesthetic ( LA ) infusion pump analgesia . Therefore , investigator propose prospective , randomised , double-blind , non-inferiority trial compare single shot PECs block versus continuous local anaesthetic pump analgesia versus combine PECs block local anaesthetic pump analgesia . Objectives &amp; Endpoints ; Primary End-Point : Area curve NRS ( numerical rating score ) pain score versus time , NRS ( move : sit bed ) record follow time point surgery : 1 hr , 2-4 hr , 6-8 hr , 10-14 hr 20-24 hr . Secondary end-points : Opioid consumption ovr 24 hr ; Postoperative nausea , postoperative vomiting , sedation score , postural hypotension , estimate cost per patient . Chronic persistent breast pain 3 month telephone interview use Short Form McGill questionnaire . Inclusion &amp; Exclusion criterion - Covered another section Methodology - Covered another section Treatment Study Subjects ; Apart describe intervention , change make routine care patient attend Mater Misericordiae University Hospital ( MMUH ) breast surgery Safety Reporting ; As describe intervention recognise technique provision analgesia patient undergo breast surgery , additional safety reporting measure need put place . Standard report issue include inform supervise anaesthetist pump malfunction , NRS pain score &gt; 4 , sign local anaesthetic toxicity derangement normal physiological parameter . Proposed Statistical Analysis ; Taking NRS difference time point 2 clinically important , study base opioid analgesia breast surgery indicate standard deviation ( SD ) 2.5 reasonable median SD among NRS value early postoperative period . Therefore , take Type I error 0.05 Type II error 0.1 , n=17 patient group would require demonstrate difference 90 % power . To allow logistical difficulty patient follow , propose enrol n=20 patient arm study . Data inspect distribution . Normally distribute data compare use unpaired independent sample t-test ; non-parametric data compare use Mann Whitney Kruskal Wallis test appropriate . Data Handling : Data accessible researcher . Hard copy data record via mean Data Record Form , subsequently transfer electronic format . Data cod order allow double-blinding , patient opportunity withdraw consent participate stage . The key re-identify data hold secure third-party , release data analysis complete . Electronic data cod store encrypted form password protect hospital computer , locate locked office . Hard copy data cod stored secure folder lock filing cabinet , locate locked office . Data leave site origin stage . Retention Essential Documents ; Coded data retain purpose oral presentation publication peer-reviewed journal . It retain period time necessary fulfil purpose collect , point destroyed . Data strictly confidential , shared third party .</detailed_description>
