Some previous study investigate music white noise pain control labor reveal beneficial result . One prospective trial 25 woman find little practical value audio-analgesia . However , study evaluate music therapy pain relief labor limit sample size . Specifically , 2011 Cochrane review investigate randomize controlled trial compare relaxation method method pain management labor find insufficient evidence role music audio-analgesia need research . Excluded review trial Phumdoung et al . due inability obtain additional methodological statistical information author . More recently , randomize control trial ( RCT ) do Turkey randomize 156 woman music control group . Mothers music group find significantly low level pain anxiety stage labor . Pain anxiety evaluate visual analog scale . While evidence best date , lack generalizability population primary outcome subjective . A 2012 systematic review video game find improvement psychological therapy , physical therapy , physical activity , clinical skill , health education , pain distraction , disease self-management outcome .

However , type analgesia pose risk mother fetus . Administration parenteral agent result minimal-to-absent reduction pain score high dos affect fetal heart rate tracing later increase number infant require naloxone therapy .

Due risk reason , many woman prefer go labor without medical therapy minimal medical therapy desire complementary therapy help manage pain . Data lack regard use music video game management pain labor . In view lack good quality evidence well design RCTs , propose randomize control trial determine utility music video game pain management induction labor . Pregnant woman schedule labor induction Foley bulb 37 week approach participation study . The study inform consent obtain . Patients randomize music/video game group ( group 1 ) non-music/video game group ( group 2 ) . Those randomize group music/video game give iPod purpose . The iPod include free music application Pandora well commonly download game . Randomization perform use computer generate random list number assign patient 2 group study . Randomization occur Foley bulb place . Study assignment list random number assignment keep secure opaque envelope end study . Prospective subject present induction labor labor delivery , willing participate study evaluate eligibility . After Foley bulb place , patient randomize . Those assigned music/video game group give iPod use labor . These patient choice listen music via earphone speaker amplifies sound . Patients assign non-music/video game group give iPod ask avoid use personal device ( applicable ) much possible . Understanding patient randomize non-music/video game may still elect use electronic device , time use electronics music/video game purpose record group assistance patient nursing staff . All nurse educate regard study procedure . Nurses ask patient desire pain medicine avoid prompt patient . Every patient enrol receive Foley bulb insert superior internal cervical o inflate normal saline mechanical dilation cervix . The Foley bulb place traction tap tube patient 's leg . No additional traction apply Foley bulb placement initial traction . After twelve hour , Foley balloon still place , Foley balloon deflate remove remainder obstetrical care leave discretion supervise faculty . After six hour epidural placement use music/video game continue ceased pending patient desire . The study explain consent form agree , patient elect either participate study risk benefit explain . Data collect consist age , gravida/para , gestational age , body mass index , time date intervention , time date delivery , mode delivery , bishop score admission ( bishop score score ass cervical readiness delivery measure digital pelvic exam . A score &lt; 7 consider unfavorable indication cervical ripening induce labor ) , time date pain medication request , type amount parenteral medication , time Foley bulb placement expulsion , patient pain score visual analog scale , patient satisfaction . Data extract patient ' medical record well direct interview patient . If elect participate consent obtain stored patient chart . A copy consent give patient .
