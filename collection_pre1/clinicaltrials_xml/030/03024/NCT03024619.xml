	<brief_title>Interstitial Cystitis Urinary pH</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Subjects agree participate study meet research team member review study , obtain informed consent sign HIPPA form , provide study material ( void diary urine quantification record IC symptom , pH strip dip urine , `` hat '' measure urine ) . Medical chart review determine Interstitial Cystitis diagnose , medication , medical/surgical history , demographic weight , height , BMI , race , age , marital status , education , insurance , tobacco alcohol use . Subjects need dip pH paper urine specific gravity reagent strip , , color comparison strip correspond scale , determine record urine pH specific gravity . They need fill correspond section void diary survey type severity pain well symptom IC . The research team member teach subject measure volume urine measure record specific gravity pH . When practical record volume urine ( patient work away home ) still ask record pH , specific gravity experience symptom . Subjects ask perform describe protocol episode micturition 3 day . After enrollment , subject complete O'Leary-Sant pain ( symptom problem index ) questionnaire , subject combine score great equal 12 consider problematic symptomatic IC . The void diary include pH specific gravity measurement measurement , time , volume , survey symptom return 1-2 week follow completion 3 day void diary face-to-face meeting research team member . Attempts make meeting coincide clinical visit minimize study burden subject ( e.g . - time cystoscopy follow-up visit . )</detailed_description>
