	<brief_summary>Selective lymphadenectomy Sentinel ( LSS ) . This technique already well establish breast cancer melanoma recently vulvar cervical cancer . Compared lymphadenectomy , several theoretical advantage : - sensitive technique detection rate &gt; 90 % false negative rate &lt; 5 % . - anatomopathological technique use ( immunohistochemistry anti-cytokeratin antibody , serial section ) sensitive standard histological analysis lymphadenectomy , allow improvement detection metastasis ( micro-metastases , isolated tumor cell ) . In SENTI-ENDO study , possible detect lymph node metastases 11 % patient low-risk endometrial cancer 15 % intermediate-risk patient . - avoids short-term long-term operative post-operative morbidity lymphadenectomy . Early study LSS endometrial cancer demonstrate superior efficacy colorimetric method couple Technetium 99m isotopic method overall detection rate 78 % [ 95 % CI : 73-84 ] . The fluorescent green indocyanine appear give good result overall detection rate 94 % bilateral detection rate 80 % . It seem useful take stock technique use new dye .</brief_summary>
