	<detailed_description>Non-celiac gluten sensitivity ( NCGS ) condition intestinal extraintestinal symptom trigger gluten ingestion absence celiac disease wheat allergy . Despite great interest NCGS , much remain unknown pathogenesis . Some study seem suggest wheat component gluten ( i.e . amylase/trypsine inhibitor , ATIs ) cause symptom , therefore term `` non-celiac wheat sensitivity '' ( NCWS ) propose instead NCGS . NCWS pathogenesis attribute different mechanism : innate adaptive immunity , incomplete digestion and/or absorption fermentable oligosaccharide disaccharide , monosaccharide polyols , , finally , psychological effect . In addition , believe condition worldwide increase , due evolution wheat breeding ( i.e . consumption wheat high gluten content ) , ancient wheat well tolerate NCWS patient modern one . Therefore , aim study determine whether common belief regard fact ancient wheat well tolerate NCWS patient modern one confirm scientific data , identify wheat kernel component trigger pathology . The availability wheat material opposite characteristic , period development ( ancient vs. modern ) , technological property ( cultivar weak gluten vs. strong gluten ) , presence/absence specific ATIs polypeptide , allow define role play factor . The researcher take consideration different tetraploid wheat genotype derive Italian breeding activity carry 20th century comparison landraces , primitive old wheat cultivars previously cultivate use mostly Southern Italy pasta bread production , together experimental genetically modify ( GM ) wheat line express low amount ATIs . For purpose study , collection subdivide 5 group , accord breeding period . Wheat genotype also evaluate several parameter : protein content , gluten index , quantitative analysis ATIs proteins Mass Spectrometry , etc . The project two objective , relate influence wheat consumption health : 1 ) extraction test total kernel protein , order evaluate inflammatory response gluten non-gluten protein peripheral blood mononuclear cell ( PBMC ) immunocytes extracted rectal mucosa NCWS patient healthy control subject , 2 ) clinically test two wheat genotype , select basis previous vitro study , show high low vitro inflammatory response , order verify effect trigger NCWS symptom .</detailed_description>
