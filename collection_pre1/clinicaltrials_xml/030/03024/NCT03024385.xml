The project involve assess maternal risk behavior significantly affect subsequent birth outcome : specifically smoke cessation , maternal depression , family planning preconception folic acid supplementation well child ( WCC ) visit . There evidence screen mother depression do WCC . Data IMPLCIT network demonstrate increase screening referral rate well decrease rate prematurity .

	<detailed_description>Specific Aim ( ) 1 . Determine feasibility implement ICC model routine standard care well child care visit 2 . Assess often physicians routinely implement model practice 3 . Increase rate screen smoking , depression , folic acid supplementation family plan routine visit . 4 . Increase rate referral mother risk Study Period ( inclusive year ) This project take place two year period . It re-evaluated monthly interval make sure objective meet . Study Design Study Entry : All mother present child Ambulatory Pediatric site ( North Clinic , Eli Manning Pavilion ) Family Medicine ( Lakeland Flowood ) 2 month , 4 month , 6 month , 9 month , 15 month , 18 month 24 month well child ( WCC ) visit screen smoking , depression , folic acid supplementation contraception . Screening take place time well child visit . The clinic nurse present mother screener depression also ask whether smoking , use contraception , use folic acid supplementation . Screening score review patient 's primary care provider . A positive score PHQ 9 elicit referral Adolescent Medicine and/or Family Medicine evaluation . A positive screen smoke elicit referral ACT Center UMMC . Negative response contraception use elicit referral Adolescent Medicine and/or Family Medicine management . Primary care provider provide mother information recommendation folic acid use use supplementation . In Ambulatory Pediatrics mother need service refer base age . Mothers 21 year younger refer Adolescent Medicine . Mothers 21 year old refer Family Medicine . In Family Medicine , mother refer depression smoking cessation . This project quality improvement hence screening offer mother present child well child visit screen . Since project quality improvement ; examine provider behavior , exemption inform consent request . Foster parent non-parental legal guardian screen . Mothers present child sick visit screen . Mothers child older 2 year age screen . All screen take place Pediatric primary care sit Family Medicine site , Monday Friday , 8am-4pm . During Phase 2 project , mother NICU infant offer screen . Details Phase 2 present amendment . Measures : Validated questionnaire use screen depression . Mothers also screen regard smoking , contraceptive use folic acid supplementation . Data collect monthly quality improvement report . Data share IMPLICIT Network every 6 month continuous quality improvement throughout network . All de-identified data upload REDCap , password encrypt database . Data share March Dimes ass progress/process throughout grant cycle . On IMPLICIT REDCap database , site name list facilitate communication continuous quality improvement monitoring . The IMPLICIT REDCap maintain server Lancaster General Hospital Lancaster , Pennsylvania . Depression Screening : The Patient Health Questionnaire validate screen tool depression . Both form PHQ grade Likert scale , 0-3 take minute complete . In adult , PHQ2 97 % sensitivity 67 % specificity ; PHQ9 61 % sensitivity 94 % specificity . In youth ( age 13-17 ) , PHQ 9 90 % sensitivity 78 % specificity . A PHQ9 score 10 great 88 % sensitivity 88 % specificity major depression . Numeric score PHQ9 follow : Score 5 = Mild Depression Score 10= Moderate Depression Score 15 = Moderately Severe Depression Score 20 = Severe Depression A two item questionnaire ( PHQ2 ) give mother child 2 year young present well child visit . If mother answer yes either question , screen score positive depression . The mother screen Patient Health Questionnaire 9 ( PHQ9 ) - nine item questionnaire . If PHQ9 score positive moderate depression ( 10 great ) primary care provider inquire mother actively suicidal . If , primary care provider send mother Emergency Department psychiatric evaluation , per standard protocol . If mother suicidal , refer either Adolescent Medicine Family Medicine Behavioral Health evaluation . Smoking , Contraception Folic Acid Screening : Screening smoking , contraception folic acid supplementation `` yes '' item . All score mother document child 's progress note electronic health record . Inclusion Criteria Mothers accompany infant routine well child care visit invite screen . Exclusion Criteria Other legal guardian foster parent infant . Mothers child 2 year age also exclude . Number Subjects ( anticipate ) : This feasibility project quality improvement . It anticipate 89 ambulatory care provider train use model ICC . Training include faculty general ambulatory pediatrics ( 8 total ) family medicine ( 4 total whose practice include pediatric patient ) . Residents general pediatrics ( 47 ) family medicine ( 30 ) also train . These provider estimate 1625 unique encounter mother . Estimated number WCC visit target age group 13000 . Assuming child get 8 routine visit 1st two year life ( 13000/8 =1625 ) . Outcome Measures Screening referral rate collect recorded quality improvement . Current rate screen hence referral health risk minimal . It anticipate screen rate initially increase subsequent increase referral rate . Study Endpoints Current screen hence referral rate minimal . This first initiative improve screen referral rate . At end 2 year , rate screen depression , smoking , folic acid supplementation family planning increase least 80 % encounter mother infant age 0-2 year age . Mothers need additional intervention refer 80 % time . Private Health Information Data collect aggregate via chart review . Data collect pull EPIC electronic health record smart-phrases . Private health information collect aggregate . Data pull EPIC ( infant 's name , date birth , date visit , ethnicity , medical record number , visit type demographic ) de-identified internal file re-coded unique REDCap encounter ID . De-identified information uploaded REDCap ( HIPAA secure database ) every 6 month . Private health information transmit IMPLCIT REDCap database . REDCap fully HIPAA compliant . All 0-2 year well child visit pull chart review do ass whether screen depression , contraception , cigarette folic acid use perform . Chart review perform monthly basis , end month . Every 6 month , process screening review 80 % great , screen process review primary care provider . Data assess number positive PHQ9 score , number positive smoker number mother use contraceptive method folic acid supplementation . Data assess number referral offer mother positive PHQ9 score , positive smoker contraceptive use , Adolescent Medicine , Family Medicine , Family Medicine Behavioral health UMMC ACT Center accordingly . Only de-identified data collect ( screen rate , questionnaire score , referral rate ) . Only principal investigator data analyst ( research assistant ; UMMC employee ) access data . Risks : No identify information collect screen data reduce risk loss confidentiality . Mothers free withhold information wish keep confidential . There minor risk discomfort due participation screening . Completion screen may associate mild distress . Certain screen question may make participant feel embarrassed uncomfortable ; however , risk highly unlikely severe give voluntary participation screening . If distress occur mother discuss primary care physician . For mother screen positive age 18 ; guardian notify recommendation referral ( current standard care screen treatment minor depression ) . Benefits Participation Study : Subjects : There direct benefit mother screen . Mothers identify depressed need contraceptive service tobacco cessation link appropriate service . Infants/Children : There indirect benefit child mother screen , improve maternal physical emotional health , could lead improve care infant/child . Societal benefit : ICC demonstrate decrease pre-terms birth , hence CQI would ultimately contribute low pre-term birth rate Mississippi Statistical Methodology Because feasibility study , formal statistical testing perform . Descriptive statistic along 95 % confidence interval use describe rate provider screen compliance . In examine feasibility , examine overall rate well rate stratify clinic age child .</detailed_description>
