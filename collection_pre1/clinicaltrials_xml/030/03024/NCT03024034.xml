	<brief_title>A Phase 1 TP-271 Oral PK Single Ascending Dose Study</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This study design assess oral TP-271 , objectives study examine safety , tolerability , PK oral TP-271 healthy adult subject administration single dose . A single-dose , dose-escalating study design common early clinical study . A cohort size 8 subject ( 6 receive oral TP-271 2 receive placebo ) single ascend dose cohort ( Cohorts A F ) allow sufficient data assessment plasma urine concentration , plasma PK parameter , safety without expose large number subject oral TP-271 clinical study . One additional cohort 8 subject first receive treatment TP-271 TP-271 co-administered ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid ( EDTA ) cross-over treatment study agent , allow comparison bioavailability TP-271 alone compare TP-271 co-administered EDTA , well allow additional assessment plasma urine concentration , plasma PK parameter , safety .</detailed_description>
