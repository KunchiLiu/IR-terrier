	<brief_summary>Pain experience critically ill patient major problem affect nearly 50 % patient . Assessing pain critically ill patient challenge even intensive care unit ( ICU ) minimal opioid-based sedation protocol . In patient unable self-report pain , behavioural scale use , CPOT - Critical Care Pain Observation Tool . Aim : The aim study validate Polish version behavioural pain assessment method - CPOT ICU minimal sedation protocol ( opioid-based ) versus self-report pain use Numeric rating scale ( NRS ) delirious non-delirious patient ( assess use Confusion Assessment Method ICU , CAM-ICU ) . Method : A prospective observational cohort study include 70 patient . The patient observe non-nociceptive procedure ( wash arm ) nociceptive procedure ( turn ) . Patients observe 5 minute , , 15 min two intervention ( six assessment ) . Each CPOT assessment carry two observer blind . To validate Polish CPOT translation calculation interrater reliability , criterion validity discriminant validity perform .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Critically ill patient frequently suffer pain stay intensive care unit , nearly 30 % patient experience pain rest 50 % experience pain nursing procedure . Pain experience critically ill patient fall four category coexist overlap : pre-existing chronic pain , acute illness-related pain , continuous ICU treatment-related pain discomfort intermittent procedural pain . Moreover , acute pain experience ICU may become chronic problem discharge unit , lifelong ICU footprint . Everyday nursing procedure intervention ( i.e . positioning , mouth trachea suctioning , wound care , catheter removal placement , cannulation intubation ) perform ICU may potential source pain , therefore clinical need simple easy ICU pain scale evaluate condition patient unable self-report pain . Assessment pain patient treat ICU becomes daily clinical challenge ICU team , especially unit deep level sedation use , also minimal sedation environment base analgesia . Various guideline recommendation exist guide ICU care team pain management assessment process . Nevertheless , gold standard pain assessment patient 's self-report pain ( use numeric raing scale - NRS visual analog scale - VAS ) , aid behavioural scale self-report unreliable impossible obtain . Those observational pain scale include Critical-Care Pain Observation Tool ( CPOT ) Behavioural Pain Scale ( BPS ) recommend clinical use critically ill adult . However , validation give patient population ( cardiac , burn , different language ) strongly recommend require . The need equip critical care team dedicate monitoring tool clear early identification warrant early treatment . The CPOT develop ICU professional , yet translate validated Polish .</detailed_description>
