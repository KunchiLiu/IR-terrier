	<criteria>Patients must meet follow criterion study entry : 1 . Documentation Disease : Progressive castrationresistant metastatic prostate cancer pathologically confirm adenocarcinoma prostate without small cell feature . 2 . Patients must Measurable Nonmeasurable disease per Prostate Cancer Working Group 2 ( PCWG2 ) response criterion ( RECIST criterion apply soft tissue lesion Measurable Disease For extranodal lesion consider measurable , must ≥ 10 mm one dimension , use spiral CT. For lymph node consider measureable ( i.e. , target evaluable lesion ) , must ≥ 20 mm least one dimension , use spiral CT. Nonmeasurable Disease All lesion , include small lesion ( long diameter &lt; 20 mm conventional technique &lt; 10 mm spiral CT scan ) truly nonmeasurable lesion . Lesions consider nonmeasurable include bone lesion ( ) . 3 . Asymptomatic mildly symptomatic metastatic CRPC define pain relieve acetaminophen nonsteroidal antiinflammatory Asymptomatic : Score 01 BPISF Question # 3 ( bad pain last 24 hour ) Mildly symptomatic : Score 23 BPISF Question # 3 4 . Progressive disease : Patients must progressive disease study entry define one follow three criterion occur patient androgen deprivation therapy . For patient enrol basis soft tissue bone progression , baseline scan must show progression relative comparison scan . If comparison scan available , baseline scan report must reference previous scan document progression . PSA progression define minimum two rise PSA level interval ≥ 1 week determination . Patients receive antiandrogen must progression document minimum two rise PSA level interval ≥ 1 week determination least second rise &gt; 4 week since last flutamide &gt; 6 week since last bicalutamide nilutamide . The PSA value screen &gt; 2 μg/L ( 2 ng/mL ) Soft tissue disease progression define least 20 % increase sum diameter target lesion , take reference small sum study ( include baseline sum small study ) . In addition relative increase 20 % , sum must also demonstrate absolute increase least 5 mm . ( Note : appearance one new nonosseous lesion also consider progression ) . Clinical lesion consider measurable superficial ( e.g. , skin nodule , palpable lymph node ) least 10 mm diameter assess use caliper ( e.g. , skin nodule ) . Per PCWG2 : Extranodal lesion need ≥ 10 mm one dimension , use spiral CT . However , lymph node need ≥ 20 mm least one dimension consider new . Bone disease progression define PCWG2 two new lesion bone scan 5 . Representative formalinfixed paraffinembedded ( FFPE ) tumor specimens paraffin block ( block prefer ) least 10 unstained slide , associate pathology report , central test tumor PDL1 expression Tumor tissue good quality base total viable tumor content .
