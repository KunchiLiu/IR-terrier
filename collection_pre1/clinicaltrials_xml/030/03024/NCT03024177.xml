	<brief_summary>This randomize , double-blind , placebo-controlled study vapendavir treatment laboratory-confirmed symptomatic HRV infection upper respiratory tract allogeneic autologous stem cell transplant subject . The aim study evaluate effect vapendavir laboratory-confirmed HRV upper-respiratory tract infection HSCT patient , measure viral load change , worsen upper respiratory tract infection ( URTI ) low respiratory tract infection ( LRTI ) , duration clinical symptom , occurrence supplemental oxygen use , duration viral shedding , hospital admission duration hospitalization , incidence secondary bacterial infection , mortality rate . Additionally , safety tolerability vapendavir , vapendavir plasma level achieve HSCT population , profile viral resistance development also assess .</brief_summary>

	<criteria>1 . Allogeneic autologous HSC transplant within last 6 month use condition regimen , HSC transplant subject current chronic graft v host disease require systemic treatment time point posttransplant ; 2 . Documented HRV upper respiratory tract ( e.g. , nasal swab , nasopharyngeal swab , nasal wash ) determine local testing ; 3 . Subject present clinic reporting symptom cold presence least 2 symptom associate HRV infection onset randomize dose preferably within 72 hour 5 day window ( 120 hour ) interval symptom onset study treatment initiation ; 4 . Capable give write informed consent include compliance requirement restriction list consent form . Informed consent subject assent subject legal age consent document mean write , sign , date ICF assent document . For subject legal age consent , parent/legal guardian provide inform consent subject legal age consent provide assent participate study , compliance local regulation ; 5 . Subject able understand comply protocol requirement ; 6 . Ability maintain adequate oral intake medication ; 7 . Female subject postmenopausal least 2 year surgically sterile complete hysterectomy bilateral oophorectomy male subject , surgically sterile via vasectomy , must agree use double barrier method birth control , , condom plus spermicidal agent ( foam/gel/film/cream/suppository ) time randomization 30 day completion study drug dosing . Male subject donate sperm study start day 1 90 day completion study drug dosing ; 8 . Female subject must breastfeed pregnant . 1 . Positive test result within 5 day prior Study Day 1 inclusive follow viral respiratory pathogen HRV : respiratory syncytial virus , influenza , parainfluenza , adenovirus , human metapneumovirus ; 2 . Clinically significant bacterial , fungal , viral low respiratory tract infection within 2 week prior Study Day 1 ( subject low respiratory tract infection Study Day 1 ) inclusive adequately treat , determine investigator ; 3 . Clinically significant systemic bacteremia fungemia within 7 day prior Study Day 1 adequately treat , determine investigator Medical Monitor ; 4 . Subjects receive high dose systemic steroid define &gt; 2mg/kg per day prednisone prednisone equivalent currently within 7 day prior Study Day 1 ; 5 . Subjects diagnosis low respiratory infection Study Day 1 , subject O2 saturation le 92 % absence supplemental oxygen , require invasive mechanical ventilation noninvasive mechanical ventilation BIPAP CPAP time randomization , and/or history current evidence chronic obstructive airway disease , emphysema , cystic fibrosis current , uncontrolled severe asthma ; 6 . Moderate severe hepatic venoocclusive disease ( VOD ) , know moderate severe sinusoidal obstructive syndrome ( SOS ) , define meeting Baltimore Criteria moderate severe VOD disease ; 7 . At time randomization , currently hospice , overt risk death , judgment investigator . If relapse hematologic malignancy , subject may enrol status futile subject expect time randomization survive complete study ; 8 . Subjects absolute lymphocyte count &gt; 2000 cells/mm3 within 5 day randomization ( Study Day 1 ) ; 9 . Subjects know clinical significant laboratory abnormality local lab test perform within 30 day prior Study Day 1 consider inclusion , opinion investigator Medical Monitor abnormalities significantly jeopardize safety subject relate underlying study disease and/or transplant abnormality impair validity study ; 10 . Known history estimate creatinine clearance &lt; 50 mL/min ( calculated via CockcroftGault method ) ; 11 . Known history HIV/AIDS . Known history active HBV HCV infection resolve treatment ; 12 . Current abuse alcohol use illicit drug ; 13 . Received investigational drug investigational vaccine within 14 calendar day 5 halflives ( whichever longer ) US market approval related indication different dose regimen , use investigational medical device within 14 calendar day prior Study Day 1 , receive vapendavir previous time ; 14 . Subjects unable tolerate bilateral nasopharyngeal sampling require study , determine investigator .</criteria>
