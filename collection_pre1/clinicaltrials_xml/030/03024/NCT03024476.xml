	<detailed_description>- Elevated blood pressure establish risk factor recurrent stroke vascular event ischemic stroke survivor , - Current guideline ( JNC VIII ) omit partially cover number practical important issue follow ; - When measure blood pressure ? - Is justifiable apply blood pressure threshold office BP home BP ? - Should stroke survivor treat BP goal non-stroke subject ? - Is justifiable apply universal BP threshold different mechanism ischemic stroke ? - Is really blood pressure might really `` beyond blood pressure ? '' - Lifestyle modification accompany pharmacological intervention usually adequate initiate behavioral change . - Frequent BP measurement home provide detail reliable information occasional office BP 's .</detailed_description>
