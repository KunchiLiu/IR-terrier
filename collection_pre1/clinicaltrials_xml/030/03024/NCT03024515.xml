	<brief_summary>Pain common symptom experience patient advanced cancer . Whilst mild pain usually control simple analgesic , severe pain may require initiation opioid analgesic . The World Health Organization ( WHO ) develop specific guideline titration analgesic . Known WHO Pain Ladder , patient severe pain despite non-opioid weak opioid analgesic advise step level 3 - `` Strong Opioids '' . Morphine common opioid strong analgesic prescribe Hong Kong . To best knowledge , formal opioid pain control guideline develop cancer patient Hong Kong . The prescription practice various physician treat advance cancer patient , include oncologist palliative care physician never audit standardized . Furthermore , inherent issue administration oral morphine . Currently , one fix concentration available liquid formulation . Patients know difficulty receive appropriate dose . Accurate measurement volume require extremely difficult , many time patient report spill oral morphine decanting , report take adequate dos worry decant much spoon syringe overdose . Oxycodone semisynthetic strong opioid analgesic , recently introduce Hong Kong . It formulate capsule , , 2 preparation ( sustained-release ( Oxycontin ) immediate release ( Oxycodone IR ) ) available . Inherent advantage include ease administration ; different group previously report less adverse effect well treatment compliance . However , date , prospective 'head-to-head ' comparison ever carry compare traditional , well-accepted method . The purpose study ass whether use Oxycontin Oxycodone IR may superior traditional medication choice schedule term time require onset pain control , side effect profile , patient ' tolerability compliance treatment . Interestingly , randomize open-label prospective study , also aim capture information current opioid prescription practice clinician manage patient advanced cancer , useful u consider establishment territory-wide treatment guideline later juncture .</brief_summary>
