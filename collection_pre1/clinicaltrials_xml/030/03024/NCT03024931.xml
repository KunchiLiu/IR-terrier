	<brief_summary>Severe burn patient challenge critically ill patient extreme continuous state physiological stress . Patients tend stay long period time intensive care unit treat burn well deal complication arise initial burn injury . Severe burn patient notoriously know loose weight . The word 'catabolism ' use medically . This theory catabolism trauma hypothesise 1942 Professor Curthberston base animal model . Since date , despite medical technological advancement , research confirms Professor Curthberston 's theory . Investigators still know exact mechanism body change conserve energy become catabolic . Furthermore , remain unclear whether change catabolism necessary heal burn injury . This theoretical catabolism burn patient currently treat nutritional supplement , use medication include beta-blockers ( suppresses heart rate decrease blood pressure ) oxandrolone ( formula similar testosterone build muscle ) . There evidence suggest increase weight loss worsen outcome burn injury . Both overfeed underfeeding patient detrimental . In research , exact change metabolic rate measure first 72 hour study use calorimetry machine . In addition metabolic rate , response heart , liver , kidney hormonal level measure . By look dynamic change investigator able elucidate whether real increase metabolic rate . If , investigator would also able tell response different organ whether hormone could responsible inflict metabolic change .</brief_summary>
