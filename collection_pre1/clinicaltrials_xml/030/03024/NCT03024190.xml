	<brief_summary>Poststroke spasticity ( PSS ) one common complication stroke patient brain injury lead limbs weakness impaired coordination agonist antagonist contraction . PSS lead physical impairment functional deficit . The clinical management PSS stretch range motion ( ROM ) exercise , antispasticity splint , neuromuscular electrical stimulation , oral medication , local injection phenol botulism , surgery . Recently , investigator try use Kinesiotaping ( KT ) spasticity management postural control . They find benefit walk ability upper extremity function facilitation stroke . 40 subacute stroke patient hemiplegia would enrol study . These 40 patient randomly divide experimental control group . In experimental group ( n=20 ) , patient perform combine KT 15- min stretch exercise upper extremity twice daily regular rehabilitation program 3 week . In control group ( n=20 ) , patient perform 15- min stretch exercise upper extremity twice daily regular rehabilitation program 3 week . Before intervention , immediately 2 week post intervention , patient receive associate physical examination , hand function evaluation , sonography .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Kinesiotaping Combined With Therapeutic Exercise Upper Extremity Spasticity Function Subacute Stroke Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>In study , 40 subacute stroke patient ( duration 3~6 month stroke ) hemiplegia would enrol . Each stroke patient diagnose neurologist accord history , physical examination , brain imaging evaluation . These 40 patient would randomly divided experimental control group . All patient control experimental group receive regular rehabilitation therapy include occupational therapy ( OT ) 3 time per week one hour one session OT intervention . Additionally , 15- min stretch exercise upper extremity twice daily perform 3 week study . KT intervention experimental group : The technique KT spastic wrist finger stroke patient perform proximal interphalangeal joint finger act extensor carpal digital muscle group , anchor proximal one-third forearm . The KT apply 5 day one week 3 week . In study , patient control experimental group receive follow evaluation intervention , immediately post intervention , 2-week intervention : Physical examination ( modify shworth scale Tardieu scale ) , Hand function evaluation ( Fugl-Meyer Assessment upper extremity , box block test , Minnesota Manual Dexterity Test ) , Musculoskeletal sonography ( sonoelastography shear wave velocity ) . SPSS software use record analysis collect data . Investigators analyze compare finding physical examination , upper extremity function assessment , musculoskeletal sonography within experimental control group intervention .</detailed_description>
