	<brief_summary>Radiotherapy ( combine chemotherapy ) increasingly applied curative treatment tumour locate thoracic region ( esophageal cancer , lung cancer , breast cancer , ( non ) Hodgkin lymphoma ) . Accurate radiotherapy planning delivery essential treatment effective . However , accuracy compromise tumour organ motion . Radiotherapy treatment planning typically perform planning-CT scan record several day prior commencement radiotherapy . Inter-fraction set variation organ motion treatment lead difference calculate dose distribution planning-CT radiation dose actually receive tumour normal organ . Accurate assessment effect essential determine optimal margin order irradiate tumour adequately minimize dose organ risk ( OARs ) . In near future , patient esophageal cancer , lung cancer , breast cancer ( non ) Hodgkin lymphoma excellent candidate proton beam therapy ( PBT ) , enable mark reduction radiation dose OARs thus decrease risk radiation induce cardiac lung toxicity . However , PBT use pencil beam scanning ( PBS ) , knowledge tumour organ motion even important . The potential major advantage PBS tumours thoracic region challenge respiratory motion tumour , breast , esophagus , diaphragm , heart , stomach , lung . Setup error inter- intra-fraction organ motion cause geometric displacement tumour normal tissue , cause underdosage target volume overdosage organ risk . Furthermore , result change tissue density beam path , alter position Bragg peak lead distort dose distribution . If pencil beam scan technique use treat move tumour , interplay dynamic pencil beam delivery target motion . This phenomenon cause additional deterioration deliver dose distribution , usually manifest significant local and/or dosage . It therefore essential incorporate motion-related uncertainty treatment planning . The main objective study evaluate impact inter-fraction tumour organ motion - take account intra-fraction movement appropriately - photon proton radiotherapy treatment plan order yield robust intensity modulate photon and/or proton treatment plan . Objective : To evaluate impact inter-fraction tumour organ geometrical dislocation move tumour photon proton radiotherapy treatment plan order create robust intensity modulate photon- and/or proton treatment plan . Study design : Pilot-study ( 80 patient ) . Study population : Patients esophageal cancer ( EC ) , ( non ) small cell lung cancer ( ( N ) SCLC ) stage III , breast cancer , ( non ) Hodgkin lymphoma treat radiotherapy ( without chemotherapy ) curative intent . Intervention ( applicable ) : Not applicable . Main study parameters/endpoints : Robustness parameter ( homogeneity index ; coverage clinical target volume ) , dose organ risk ( OARs ) , heart ( mean heart dose , MHD ) lung ( mean lung dose , MLD ) . Nature extent burden risk associate participation , benefit group relatedness : During radiotherapy treatment course , patient undergo weekly repeat plan CT scan treatment position without contrast agent order evaluate impact inter-fraction tumour organ motion . Furthermore , additional CBCTs collect 10 radiotherapy fraction ass intra-fraction motion . The additional radiation dose 3-6 4D-CT 's 10 CBCTs low ( 4-6 x 25-30mSv + 10 x 7mSv result effective dose &lt; 250mSv ) compare therapeutic radiation dose ( 40-60Gy ) . The risk therefore negligible burden low .</brief_summary>
