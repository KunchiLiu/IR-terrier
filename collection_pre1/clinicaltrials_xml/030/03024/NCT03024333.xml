	<brief_title>Effect Different Viscous Foods Liquids Swallowing Sounds</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Upon accept consented , investigator measure neck circumference , height weight participant . Then , sound detection device ( iASUS NT3-R Throat Mic Headset , CA , USA ) attach participant 's neck . This non-invasive lightweight ( 2.3oz ) device record sound vibration signal use pair 20mm-diameter sound sensor . The device record three time swallow sound three placement ( Apleft , Apright , B ) separately participant ' head-trunk neutral position also record sound neck breathe sound , throat clearing cough sound . ( Apleft , Apright ) intersection lateral border trapezius muscle intermediate line third fourth cervical vertebra posterior neck region . B lateral cricoid cartilage anterolateral neck . Participants use 5ml spoon intake food liquid room temperature . Healthy subject conduct research Student Living Center Room 1036/1041 UNMC . Healthy subject require swallow different consistency liquid food head-trunk neutral position . Participants also perform one follow randomly swallow food liquid : throat clear cough cough throat clearing . Before subject start swallow test , subject try several time subject want.There 2 section complete whole process . Each section take 2 hours.The device record three time swallow sound food liquid three placement ( Apleft , Apright , B ) separately participant ' head-trunk neutral position.The food liquid preparation also list end section.The PI faculty advisor research team present record swallow session . The sound detection device record sound occur neck swallow sound , breathe sound , talk sound , throat clearing cough sound dysphagia patient intake food drink . The conversation also record use Sony recorder ( ICD-SX713 ) data collection session.The voice record analyzed , provide additional information food liquids subject swallow placement sensor record swallow sound . Recordings save digital sound wave file segment individual anonymized clip data analysis . The digital sound wave file achieve secure server UNMC completion data analysis , remove server . Aim1 : Investigators record swallow sound vibration anterior posterior neck healthy subject , analyze duration , amplitude , mean frequency power spectrum swallow sound generate various viscous food liquid pharynx . Aim2 : Investigators compare difference sound duration , mean frequency power spectrum swallow sound throat clear cough healthy subject . *** *** *** *** *** Foods Liquids Prepared Healthy Subjects : Foods liquid respectively divide 5 level International Dysphagia Diet Standardization Initiative ( IDDSI ) level 3 , 4 two overlapping level foods drink Level 0 ( Thin liquid ) All liquid flow syringe Level 1 ( Slightly thick liquid ) There 1 4 ml remain Level 2 ( Mildly thick liquid ) There 4 8 ml remain Level 3 ( Moderately thick liquid/ Liquidize ) There 8 ml remaining , liquid still flow Level 4 ( Extremely thick liquid/ Pureed ) If liquid flow Level 5 ( Minced &amp; Moist ) Pressed fork particle easily separate come prong fork Level 6 ( Soft ) Sample squash return original shape pressure release . Level 7 ( Regular ) No texture restriction Liquid Samples Preparation : According drink detail provide IDDSI , investigator choose food polysaccharide thickener xanthan gum ( UPC784672647311 , Anthony 's , Gluten-Free , USA ) prepare different viscous solution . Firstly , disperse xanthan gum de-ionized water 185 F 10 min carry solution 1.5 liter plastic beaker 2000 rpm four-blade propeller ( 60 mm diameter ) use 6-Speed blender ( XJ-14402C , Mainstays , Walmart Inc. , Bentonville , AR 72716 ) ensure lump . After , cool solution room temperature . Flow testing : Before flow testing , use 10ml water flow completely syringe ( A 10 ml slip tip syringe international standard ( ISO 7886-1 ) ) within 10 second check whether nozzle clear free plastic residue manufacturing defect vary occasionally occur . After check , firstly , get stopwatch 2 10ml slip-tip syrinx . Secondly , remove plunge one syrinx ( Syringe A ) . Thirdly , cover nozzle syringe A finger make seal . Then use another syringe B add syringe A 10 ml line fluid . According gravity flow test , select follow drink . Level 0 de-ionized water Level 1 xanthan gum : de-ionized water = 1oz : 5000ml Level 2 xanthan gum : de-ionized water = 1oz : 4000ml Level 3 xanthan gum : de-ionized water = 1oz : 3000ml Level 4 xanthan gum : de-ionized water = 1oz : 1000ml Food Samples Preparation : Fork Testing : The slots/gaps prong standard metal fork typically 4 mm . Pressure apply food sample quantify assessment pressure need make thumb nail blanch noticeably white color . According food detail provide IDDSI , use IDDSI Flow Test ( Syringe Test ) , Fork ( The slots/gaps tines/prongs standard metal fork typically measure 4 mm ) Drip Test Fork Pressure Test select food follow : Level 5 ( Minced &amp; Moist ) cereal : de-ionized water = 2:1 Dispersing xanthan gum de-ionized water 185 F 10 min carry solution 1.5-liter plastic beaker 2000 rpm four-blade propeller ( 60 mm diameter ) use 6-Speed blender ensure cereal fully moist &amp; mince less 1.5cm*1.5cm . After , cool solution room temperature . Level 6 ( Soft ) Banana Level 7 ( Regular ) White bread</detailed_description>
