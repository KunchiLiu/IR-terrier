	<brief_summary>Patients underwent presbyopic correction bilateral bifocal intraocular lens implantation suppose sufficient uncorrected vision capacity activity daily live ( ADLs ) require near vision acuity ( NV ) , ( ie . book reading ) . However , know light intensity temperature great impact near vision capacity . Primary objective study identify optimal task light condition ( term light intensity temperature ) ADLs demand near vision acuity sample oa patient underwent presbyopic correction bilateral bifocal intraocular lens implantation</brief_summary>
