	<brief_title>Neonatal Maternal Effects Buprenorphine Methadone</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>In 2012 , 5.4 % pregnant woman age 15 44 report use illicit drug ; however low compare 11.4 % non-pregnant population . Illicit drug use high first trimester ( 9.0 % ) continue decline pregnancy progress ( 4.8 % 2nd trimester 2.4 % 3rd trimester ) . The opioid agent include heroin , codeine , fentanyl , hydrocodone , hydromorphone , meperidine , morphine , methadone , oxycodone . Patients experience euphoria intoxication follow withdrawal , pose threat mother fetus . During euphoria , increase risk maternal respiratory depression fetal growth restriction . During withdrawal , tachycardia , hypertension , nausea , vomit , increase metabolic demand occur , cause negative outcome fetus spontaneous abortion , preterm labor , premature preterm rupture membrane , intrauterine growth restriction ( IUGR ) intrauterine fetal demise ( IUFD ) . Withdrawing ideal pregnancy due risk baby high risk relapse mother . Heroin withdrawal occur within first 24 hour birth usually peak within 48 72 hour , may take 7 day withdrawal occur . At birth , infant bear woman use illicit drug also go withdrawal , otherwise know neonatal abstinence syndrome ( NAS ) . NAS define hyperactivity central autonomic nervous system . Clinical presentation depend duration opioid use , duration use prior delivery , maternal metabolism , placental metabolism . Symptoms NAS manifest CNS gastrointestinal ( GI ) tract . If mother us nicotine , stimulant , sedative , SSRIs , etc , also affect withdrawal , agent cause fetal withdrawal well . Clinicians United States primarily use modified Finnegan 's Neonatal Abstinence score tool ass sign symptom severity NAS . This tool evaluate 21 item area CNS disturbance , GI disturbance , metabolic/vasomotor/respiratory disturbance . Scores range 0 44 score &gt; 8 indicate need pharmacologic treatment.5 Medication treatment use relieve moderate severe sign NAS prevent complication may include opioid , barbiturate , benzodiazepine , clonidine , chlorpromazine . Methadone standard treatment opioid addiction pregnancy since 1970s . Methadone full mu-agonist use analgesia maintenance opioid addiction . Methadone dispense daily basis register substance abuse treatment program usually start 10 30 mg/day . Methadone cause serious adverse event respiratory depression , QTc prolongation , hypotension , sedation , adverse event include lightheadedness , dizziness , nausea , vomit , diaphoresis . Infants expose methadone usually experience withdrawal within first 72 hour , occur within first two week last several day week . Recently increase evidence use buprenorphine pregnancy due potential less neonatal abstinence syndrome ( NAS ) . Buprenorphine partial mu agonist indicated treatment opioid dependence typical dose 2 24 mg . Infants expose buprenorphine usually experience withdrawal within 12 48 hour , peak 72 96 hour , resolve 7 days.2 Like methadone , still risk respiratory depression , central nervous system ( CNS ) depression , hypotension . There low risk overdose , few drug interaction , need dispense daily clinic , make favorable option methadone . Buprenorphine require additional registration provider prescribe , fill pharmacy . The PROMISE trial randomize , double-blind , double-dummy , parallel-group control trial design compare methadone buprenorphine treatment opioid-dependent pregnant patient . A total 30 patient enrol received methadone buprenorphine dose base compliance , urine sample , patient report withdrawal symptom craving . The primary outcome analyze number neonate require morphine NAS , peak NAS score , total amount morphine give , total day neonatal hospital stay . There several secondary neonatal maternal outcome well . Neonatal length stay statistically significant outcome , difference 1.3 day favor buprenorphine ( p= 0.021 ) . There difference adverse event amongst two group . This trial limit due small size , support need large trial.8 The MOTHER trial multi-center , randomize , double-blind , double-dummy trial design compare methadone buprenorphine treatment opioid-dependent pregnant patient . A total 175 patient enrol received methadone buprenorphine dose base compliance , urine sample , patient report withdrawal symptom craving . The primary outcome analyze number neonate require treatment NAS , peak NAS score , total amount morphine need treatment NAS , length neonatal hospital stay , head circumference . There several secondary neonatal maternal outcome measure well . The total amount morphine need neonatal length stay statistically significant . Neonates take buprenorphine require 1.1 ± 0.7 mg morphine , whereas methadone group require 10.4 ±2.6 mg morphine ( p = 0.0091 ) . The buprenorphine group short length stay 10.0 ± 1.2 day compare 17.5 ± 1.5 day methadone group ( p = 0.0091 ) . In regard secondary outcome , duration treatment significant favoring buprenorphine ( 4.1 vs. 9.9 day , p = 0.003125 ) . None secondary maternal outcome statistically significant . The methadone group high incidence non-serious maternal event non-serious cardiovascular event . This trial support buprenorphine safe effective treatment opioid dependence pregnant woman . Based aforementioned study , investigator establish clinic prescribing buprenorphine treatment opioid dependence small group patient . Patients opioid-dependent evaluated see buprenorphine best option . There also prescribe regulation first year limit provider prescribe buprenorphine 30 patient . The remainder patient treat methadone . The clinic multi-disciplinary , patient see maternal fetal medicine specialist , nurse practitioner , pharmacist , social service department , nurse coordinator , neonatologist , lactation nurse , anesthesia department , dietician throughout pregnancy . Patients enrol clinic must receive obstetric care clinic deliver within health system . Patients start buprenorphine initiate clinic first second trimester , admit monitoring buprenorphine induction 24 week . After buprenorphine induction , patient see weekly 4 week , every week 6 week , every 4 week thereafter need traditional prenatal care need . Patients must also attend counsel narcotic anonymous meeting . Once patient delivers , see twice 6 week post-partum . In retrospective chart review , investigator plan analyze effect buprenorphine compare methadone opioid-maintained pregnant woman . The investigator evaluate maternal neonatal outcome , primary outcome infant hospital length stay .</detailed_description>
