	<detailed_description>This study contain two intervention group one attention control group . Participation individual include recruitment physician , screen provide consent , baseline assessment , randomization one three group , adoption transition phase assessments post-assessment . The intervention deliver three phase : ( 1 ) Adoption ( week 1 12 ) ; ( 2 ) Transition ( week 13 24 ) ; ( 3 ) Maintenance ( week 25 48 ) . This phased approach allow u gradually adjust dosage intervention able capture effect change dosage . The study include eHealth platform deliver M2M content ( M2M M2Mplus group ) . ALL GROUPS ( attention control , M2M , M2Mplus ) All group involve baseline , 3-month , post-testing , conduct Spain Rehabilitation Center . These assessment include short form ( SFs ) develop National Institutes Health ( NIH ) Patient-Reported Outcome Measurement Information System ( PROMIS ) use measure symptom quality life indicator . Cardiorespiratory endurance measure 6-minute walk/push test strength measure grip strength dynamometer . Anthropometrics assessment include height , weight , BMI waist circumference . Other assessment include social support , self-efficacy , self-regulation , outcome expectancy , barrier , physical function , blood pressure . Copies assessment form , survey , procedure attach protocol . Physical activity adherence key outcome measure . Physical activity estimate step per day use Fitbit activity monitor . FitBit Flex sensor ( popular version commercial accelerometer ) give study participant track rate physical activity . Fitbit tracker use 3-axis accelerometer capture motion , make activity measurement precise old , single-axis pedometer , enable u measure physical activity PWD . The data , include personal health information ( PHI ) date birth , height weight need Fitbit setup , upload protect server run FitBit . This happen automatically require type manual setup participant . The uploaded data contain sensor 's unique identification code personally identifiable information . The project 's eHealth platform connect FitBit server application program interface , locally host data analysis . The project coordinator access participant ' activity data respective dashboard eHealth platform . The activity data , couple advance eHealth track routine , enable statistician match minute videos watch ( dosage ) change physical activity ( FitBit step ) . Participants wear FitBit accelerometer time investigator also track change PA across 24-hr period . To monitor ensure FitBit sensor worn , monitor system include send automate text message voicemail participant fail wear FitBit 12 hour . Adherence rate participant define percentage 48 week participant meet study protocol 's physical activity target . This enable comparable measure adherence across intervention control arm . Participants three group study receive phone-based/GoToMeeting weekly group coach session lead research team expertise motivational interviewing strategy . The coaching session follow framework develop consultant exercise psychologist use previous research adult physical disability . The call focus topic related social support , overcome barrier , prevent relapse . These session hold weekly Adoption phase ( week 1-12 ) , biweekly Transition phase ( week 13-24 ) , monthly Maintenance phase ( week 25-48 ) . The physician and/or designate nurse would optionally join coach session , necessary . M2M/M2Mplus GROUPS Participants M2M M2Mplus group receive telehealth exercise training program . Our advanced eHealth platform design National Center Health , Physical Activity Disability 's ( NCHPAD ) 14-Weeks To Healthier You program include foundational element require rapid deployment M2M content . The onsite M2M program currently Lakeshore Foundation convert home-based package use extensive set movement routine adapt people range physical/mobility disability . The M2M movement routine position use perform movement routine prescribe base participant ' physical function . Each movement routine available different choice music type- enable participant exercise music type prefer . The M2M exercise video create incorporate holistic movement routine . Each exercise video include five component : warm-up/range motion exercise , strength exercise , aerobic exercise , functional strength/balance exercise , cool-down/breathing . The movement choreograph adapted target component experience dance instructor . Exercise equipment , TheraBand hand weight , use require . All M2M movement routine review physical therapist/exercise physiology co-investigator ( Brown ) clarity safety . The duration movement complexity M2M session gradually increase 30-minute session ( 5-min range motion movement routine , 10-min strength movement routine , 10-min aerobic movement routine , 5-min cool down/breathing ) 60-min session ( 5-min range motion movement routine , 10-min strength movement routine , 30-min aerobic movement routine , 10-min functional strength/balance routine , 5-min cool down/breathing ) throughout Adoption Transition phase intervention . The duration movement complexity M2M session keep consistent maintenance phase ( 5-min range motion movement routine , 10-min strength movement routine , 30-min aerobic movement routine , 10-min functional strength/balance routine , 5-min cool down/breathing ) . Participants encourage work self-selected pace comfort level , mean pause M2M video anytime need break resume ready . Participants complete entire 50 minute feel comfortable . Participants provide feedback brief electronic form upload project coordinator perform set M2M movement routine liked/disliked movement routine , preferably within two hour complete M2M session . Each M2M session start brief exercise reminder maintain good form use 'talk test ' encouraging participant record rating perceive exertion score ( RPE , 0-10 ) M2M movement routine ensure intensity level outside individual 's comfort level . The participant stop video rest time touch tablet/electronic device return segment 'dosing ' remain consistent across participant , albeit participant less fit may need long frequent rest interval first week training . The eHealth platform password protect enable detailed usage tracking . The M2M video offer YouTube playlist player , offer seamless experience quickly play pause minimum number click . To monitor delivery video , event tracking use . This help researcher know precisely videos view long . The Rate Perceived Exertion score also collect every M2M session send automated notification tablet ask participant rate overall intensity session 0-10 . The Physical Medicine Rehabilitation physician ( designated nurse ) access dashboard computer provide detail level participation progress patient . The purpose physician/nurse contact twofold : ( 1 ) encourage participant take active role discuss exercise-related issue doctor clinical appointment ; ( 2 ) improve exercise adherence physician aware patient 's level PA encouragement support . Research demonstrate physician actively involve understanding advise patient exercise , participant likely exercise . This entirely optional physician nurse practitioner . At week 5 exercise program , individual engage exercise use Fitbit click video , contact research staff brief interview . The purpose interview understand lack participation exercise intervention perhaps re-engage participant . At week 12 exercise program , individual engage exercise since week 5 use Fitbit click video , contact research staff brief interview . No identifiable information link interview participant . M2Mplus GROUP ONLY For M2Mplus group , social networking system ( SNS ) integrate eHealth platform . SNS feature allow user engage conversation form social interaction ( post rating score certain video movement sequence like dislike ) across eHealth platform . The participant 's physician designate nurse also access SNS build close asynchronous relationship patient . The social networking component platform include essential building block social medium include ( 1 ) identity ; ( 2 ) sharing ; ( 3 ) presence ; ( 4 ) relationship ; ( 5 ) reputation ; ( 6 ) group , ; ( 7 ) conversations,105 repurposed enhanced SNS develop NCHPAD 14 Weeks To A Healthier You online program , user express strong desire able closely interact fellow participant ( see sample quote box right ) . The SNS feature intervention develop use popular open source SNS framework `` Elgg . ''</detailed_description>
