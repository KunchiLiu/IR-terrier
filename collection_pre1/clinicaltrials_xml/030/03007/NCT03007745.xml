	<brief_summary>Although obstructive sleep apnea , breathe disorder sleep , prevalent recognize major public health concern , Veterans disorder undiagnosed therefore untreated . Access sleep laboratory test limit particularly Veterans live rural area Veterans disability prevent travel sleep center . The goal study compare web-based telehealth management strategy in-person management . The telehealth pathway enable Veterans diagnose treat without visit sleep center . The investigator believe telehealth management increase Veterans ' access specialize care cost less in-person delivery similar improvement daytime function .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Remote Sleep Apnea Management</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Obstructive sleep apnea ( OSA ) estimate third common chronic disease Veterans associate increase risk hypertension , heart attack , stroke , depression , drive accident . Current in-person management sleep center limit Veterans ' access care , prolongs patient wait time , require Veterans live remote area travel long distance . This proposal evaluate innovative web-based clinical pathway diagnose manage Veterans OSA . In FY13 , investigative team receive VHA Innovation Award create Remote Veteran Apnea Management Portal ( REVAMP ) , personalize , interactive website , combine emerge telehealth technology , design improve access care , reduce patient wait time , allow Veterans receive care without travel sleep center . Veterans complete intake follow-up questionnaire REVAMP website perform unattended home sleep test ( HST ) without in-person instruction . Sleep specialist review finding patient initial phone clinic . REVAMP auto-populates Veteran 's questionnaire response templated progress note export CPRS , electronic medical record . Veterans diagnose OSA treat automatically adjust positive airway pressure ( APAP ) unit . These device transmit data wirelessly website treatment use effectiveness monitor Veterans practitioner , thereby promote patient self-management productive patient-practitioner interaction . The investigator ' propose prospective , randomize intervention compare clinical cost-effectiveness REVAMP management Veterans OSA in-person care . Aim 1 determine management REVAMP clinically non-inferior in-person care term improvement functional outcome APAP adherence . Non-inferiority clinical effectiveness follow 3 month APAP treatment express term improvement score Functional Outcomes Sleep Questionnaire ( FOSQ-10 ) , investigator ' primary outcome measure . Adherence APAP objectively monitor wireless transmission data participant 's home unit . In Aim 2 , patient preference , medical service use cost collect every 3 month entire observation period compare cost effectiveness two management . Preference assess SF-6D,6 EQ-5D.7 , 8 Differences ratio cost quality-adjusted life year save REVAMP compare in-person management test hypothesis REVAMP management low cost equivalent outcomes . The result Aims 1 2 provide evidence support widespread dissemination REVAMP . Formative evaluation Aim 3 use qualitative ( target phone interview ) quantitative measure ( attrition , work alliance , patient satisfaction ) inform clinician , administrator stakeholder implement innovative chronic disease pathway . Aim 1 ( primary ) . To compare functional outcome follow 3 month APAP treatment Veterans OSA randomize REVAMP versus in-person management . The primary outcome measure modify intent-to-treat analysis ( i.e. , subject initiate APAP least one FOSQ follow-up score ) change baseline FOSQ-10 score . Analysis also compare mean daily hour APAP use participant two group initiate APAP treatment . Hypothesis 1a : Mean change FOSQ-10 score among participant randomize REVAMP management one point less participant receive in-person management . Hypothesis 1b : Mean daily hour APAP use among participant receive REVAMP management 0.75 hour less participant randomize in-person management . Aim 2 ( secondary ) : To compare difference cost quality-adjusted life year ( QALY ) REVAMP management in-person management . The perspective analysis VA intention treat analysis set include randomized participant . Hypothesis 2a : Average total health-care delivery cost low participant receive REVAMP compare in-person management . Hypothesis 2b : The 90 % low limit cost per QALY ratio compare in-person versus REVAMP manage-ment &gt; $ 100,000 ( i.e. , investigator 90 % confidence REVAMP good value cost ) . Aim 3 ( exploratory ) : To conduct mixed method formative evaluation guide REVAMP 's widespread implementation . Quantitative component : The investigator track quantitative outcome measure across group include attrition , participant- practitioner-rated therapeutic alliance ( Working Alliance Inventory-Short Revised [ WAI-SR ] ) ,9 participant treatment satisfaction ( Client Satisfaction Questionnaire [ CSQ-8 ] ) .10 The investigator compare score WAI-SR CSQ-8 attrition rate treatment arm . Qualitative component : The investigator explore participant- practitioner-level perspective , attitude , preference regard REVAMP versus in-person management , well barrier facilitator participation either clinical pathway phone interview participant two intervention group , participant withdraw either intervention , staff provide care REVAMP .</detailed_description>
