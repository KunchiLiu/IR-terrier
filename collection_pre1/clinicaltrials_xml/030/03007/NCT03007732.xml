	<brief_summary>This non-comparative open-label multicenter Phase 2 clinical trial combine definitive prostatic radiotherapy ( RT ) pembrolizumab without intratumoral SD-101 patient newly diagnose hormone-naive oligometastatic prostate cancer .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Pembrolizumab Combination With Intratumoral SD-101 Therapy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>A safety lead-in treatment arm perform prior full 1:1 randomization arm . Definitive RT whole prostate gland deliver via high-dose rate ( HDR ) brachytherapy Day 1 Day 8 ( +7 day ) Cycle 1 pembrolizumab arm . Immediately RT , SD-101 deliver dominant prostatic lesion Day 1 Day 8 ( +7 day ) Cycle 1 pembrolizumab Arm 2 . SD-101 administer intratumorally concert placement HDR brachytherapy catheter . Pembrolizumab continue total 13 cycle , disease progression , unacceptable toxicity , whichever occur first . Patients receive 3 month androgen deprivation therapy ( ADT ) run-in , follow combined androgen blockade ( CAB ) 9 month , discontinuation ADT . Primary outcome evaluate rate prostate specific antigen ( PSA ) &lt; nadir +2 ng/mL 15 24 month start treatment among patient non-castrate level testosterone ( &gt; 150 ng/dL ) . Serum , archival prostate biopsy , mandatory baseline metastatic tumor biopsy , optional repeat biopsy time progression , obtain characterize circulate intratumoral immune response .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Be willing able provide write informed consent/assent trial . Be &gt; =18 year age day sign informed consent . Have performance status 0 1 ECOG Performance Scale . Histologically document adenocarcinoma prostate Oligometastatic disease . In order eligible , patient must total &lt; 4 metastatic bone and/or metastatic lymph node site base bone and/or soft tissue lesion define follow : Bone metastasis define bone imaging . If patient technetium bone scan and/or NaF PET perform , either study may use documenting metastasis ; scan need show number metastasis require study entry . For patient undergo PSMA PET , PSMA avid lesion CT MRI correlate count site metastasis . Distant metastatic lymph node disease . A lymph node ≥1 cm short dimension note involved disease . Distant metastatic lymph node determine lymph node outside confine true pelvis . For patient undergo PSMA PET , PSMA avid lesion CT MRI correlate count site metastasis . Any soft tissue lesion deem physician consistent distant metastatic disease i.e . lung liver metastasis . For patient undergo PSMA PET , PSMA avid lesion CT MRI correlate count site metastasis . Treatment naïve , define less 2 month standard care ADT ( e.g . GNRH agonist antagonist without antiandrogen ) metastatic hormonesensitive prostate cancer prior enrollment No prior chemotherapy prostate cancer Not candidate refuse chemotherapy No prior prostatectomy prostatic radiation PSA &gt; 2 ng/mL baseline prior initiation hormonal therapy Baseline testosterone &gt; 150 ng/dL patient initiate hormonal therapy Available archival tumor tissue correlative study . Submission archival TRUS prostate biopsy tissue require available , form representative formalinfixed paraffinembedded ( FFPE ) tumor specimens paraffin block ( prefer ) least 15 slide , associate pathology report . If archival prostate tissue unavailable obtain , repeat TRUS prostate biopsy require eligibility . Consent undergo mandatory baseline biopsy metastatic tumor , clinically feasible safe perform . Acceptable sample include core needle biopsy bone lymph node . At least three core obtain . A fine needle aspirate acceptable . Subjects option consent repeat biopsy time progression . Consent undergo mandatory intraoperative prostatic core biopsy time HDR brachytherapy without SD101 therapy , depend study arm . The effect pembrolizumab develop human fetus unknown . Men treat enrolled protocol must agree use adequate contraception prior first dose study therapy , duration study participation , 120 day last dose study therapy . Demonstrate adequate organ function define Table 1 , screen lab perform within 10 day treatment initiation . Adequate Organ Function Laboratory Values : Absolute neutrophil count ( ANC ) ≥1,500 /mcL Platelets ≥100,000 / mcL Hemoglobin ≥9 g/dL ≥5.6 mmol/L without transfusion EPO dependency ( within 7 day assessment ) Serum creatinine OR Measured calculate creatinine clearance ( GFR also use place creatinine CrCl ) ≤1.5 X upper limit normal ( ULN ) OR ≥60 mL/min subject creatinine level &gt; 1.5 X institutional ULN Serum total bilirubin ≤ 1.5 X ULN OR Direct bilirubin ≤ ULN subject total bilirubin level &gt; 1.5 ULN AST ( SGOT ) ALT ( SGPT ) ≤ 2.5 X ULN OR ≤ 5 X ULN subject liver metastasis Albumin &gt; 2.5 mg/dL International Normalized Ratio ( INR ) Prothrombin Time ( PT ) Activated Partial Thromboplastin Time ( aPTT ) ≤1.5 X ULN unless subject receive anticoagulant therapy long PT PTT within therapeutic range intend use anticoagulant ≤1.5 X ULN unless subject receive anticoagulant therapy long PT PTT within therapeutic range intend use anticoagulant Creatinine clearance calculate per institutional standard . Subjects agree use adequate method contraception prior first dose study therapy 120 day last dose study therapy . Their partner also encourage use proper method contraception . Patients appropriate candidate prostate brachytherapy . Patients neuroendocrine small cell feature eligible . Patients evidence liver metastasis exclude . GNRH agonists GNRH antagonist ( e.g. , leuprorelin , degarelix ) &gt; 2 month prior enrollment Antiandrogens ( e.g. , bicalutamide , flutamide , nilutamide ) &gt; 2 month prior enrollment .

Prior immunotherapy chemotherapy prostate cancer Prior radiation therapy prostate Prior prostatectomy Is currently participate receive study therapy participate study investigational agent receive study therapy use investigational device within 4 week first dose treatment . Has diagnosis immunodeficiency receive systemic steroid therapy form systemic immunosuppressive therapy within 7 day prior first dose trial treatment , exception steroid adrenal insufficiency case prednisone &lt; 10mg/day equivalent allow . Has know history active TB ( Bacillus Tuberculosis ) Hypersensitivity pembrolizumab excipients . Has prior anticancer monoclonal antibody ( mAb ) within 4 week prior study Day 1 recover ( i.e. , ≤ Grade 1 baseline ) adverse event due agent administer 4 week earlier . Has prior chemotherapy , target small molecule therapy , radiation therapy within 2 week prior study Day 1 recover ( i.e. , ≤ Grade 1 baseline ) adverse event due previously administer agent . Note : Subjects ≤ Grade 2 neuropathy exception criterion may qualify study . Note : If subject receive major surgery , must recover adequately toxicity and/or complication intervention prior start Has know additional malignancy progress require active treatment . Exceptions include basal cell carcinoma skin squamous cell carcinoma skin undergone potentially curative therapy situ cervical cancer .
