	<brief_summary>Patients sickle cell disease often develop painful crisis without obvious reason . Some patient likely develop complication others . It clear painful crisis occur sickled red blood cell stick white blood cell activate , usually inflammation infection . A recent study mouse sickle cell disease show use long term antibiotic could reduce number activate white blood cell reduce death mouse sickle cell crisis . The investigator believe sickle cell patient develop frequent painful crisis may different pattern bacteria intestine compare whose painful crisis occur infrequently . In study , investigator propose study sickle cell subject 's blood determine many activate white blood cell he/she . The investigator also examine his/her stool compare bacteria his/her stool sickle cell patient . The investigator investigate whether result blood stool test correlate frequently patient develops painful crisis . The investigator examine patient ' medical record find many time admitted hospital sickle cell crisis last 12 month . The investigator also obtain information follow : age , sex , whether take hydroxyurea Penicillin , last transfusion exchange transfusion therapy painful crisis need hospital admission , whether receive antibiotic ( Penicillin ) last 4 week , whether experience painful crisis time enter study . The investigator obtain , previous laboratory result , level hemoglobin F marker inflammation . The investigator check hemoglobin F level already test . The investigator expect enroll 50 subject study Rhode Island Hospital/Hasbro Children 's Hospital .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Pilot Study Fecal Microbiome Neutrophil Cellular Adhesion Molecules Patients With Sickle Cell Disease ( SCD )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The clinical course sickle cell disease ( SCD ) variable . Some patient experience vaso-occlusive disease infrequently , patient develop complication recurrently . The reason difference remain unclear . Although erythrocyte sickling occurs due factor dehydration , infection , extreme temperature , acidosis , hypoxia , neutrophil adhesion activation crucial elicit vaso-occlusive crisis patient SCD . Activated neutrophils upregulate expression various cellular adhesion molecule increase `` stickiness '' vivo . A murine model SCD demonstrate importance intestinal microbiome influence kinetics age neutrophil . Depletion microbiota prolonged course broad-spectrum systemic antibiotic result reduction number neutrophils protection LPS-induced fatal vaso-occlusive crisis mouse . Intestinal barrier functional barrier separate gut lumen inner host . It consist mechanical element ( mucus , epithelial layer ) , humoral element ( defensins , IgA ) , immunologic element ( lymphocyte , innate immune cell ) , muscular neurological element . Although normal intestinal microbiota main source endogenous pathogen , also contribute functional integrity intestinal barrier interaction component barrier . Failure component result breakdown protective intestinal barrier consequence recurrent intestinal-derived bacteremia/septicemia . A breakdown normal microbiome implicate development various pathologic state , include Clostridium difficile infection , inflammatory bowel disease , intestinal graft-versus-host disease follow allogeneic hematopoietic progenitor cell transplant , colon cancer , metabolic disorder obesity non-alcoholic steatohepatitis . To explain reason development frequent vaso-occlusive crisis patient SCD , investigator ' stepwise hypothesis , due sickling process consequent development intestinal ischemia , patient SCD , especially frequent vaso-occlusive crisis , likely alter microbiota healthy individual . If normal microbiota alter , intestinal barrier compromise , render patient susceptible recurrent bacteremia intestinal origin . Since SCD patient vaso-occlusive crisis present without obvious infection , likely compromise intestinal barrier facilitates inoculum bacteremia high enough cause overt infection sufficient activate neutrophil elicit vaso-occlusive crisis . The first step towards test overall hypothesis test sub-hypothesis alter intestinal microbiomes correlate increase number activate neutrophils frequent vaso-occlusive crisis patient SCD .</detailed_description>
