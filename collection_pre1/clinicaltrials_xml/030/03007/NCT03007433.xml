	<brief_summary>Dyspeptic symptom abdominal pain , bloat nausea meal common ; however cause problem many patient often unclear despite medical investigation . This `` dyspeptic symptom '' rarely related acid reflux , stomach ulcer cancer diagnose endoscopy . Rather , cause abnormal stomach function , so-called `` functional dyspepsia '' , condition digestive system function normally meal . Gastric scintigraphy standard investigation stomach function patient condition . It involve eat small test meal include tiny dose radioactive material movement food visualise empty stomach . An important limitation approach symptom rarely cause delayed empty small meal present minority patient , thus , ability investigation explain cause symptom guide medical treatment limit . This research project design compare three new investigation stomach function use relatively large meal . This information help explain cause symptoms meal . The investigation test include : ( 1 ) Nutrient Drink Test , ( 2 ) Gastric Scintigraphy ( 3 ) Magnetic Resonance Imaging . All three test safe , easy perform non-invasive ( i.e . involve insert catheter nose stomach take blood ) . The result provide useful information doctor look patient dyspeptic symptom . This study compare test result healthy volunteer , patient attend clinic investigation dyspeptic symptom . The aim document abnormal function stomach intestine identify cause dyspeptic symptom meal .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The Nutrient Drinking Test perform part screen visit ensure patient consent participate full study able complete imaging study require ingestion 400ml liquid nutrient ( Fortisip Vanilla ( Nutricia Clinical ) dilute 1:1 water 0.75kcal/ml , 4.5g fat/100ml ) . Subjects drink one series beaker contain 40ml liquid nutrient every minute . During drink test , subject score satiety , fullness , bloating , heartburn , nausea epigastric pain 5-min interval use 100mm visual analogue scale ( sample attach ) . Participants instructed cease intake report maximal satiety severe dyspeptic symptom ( define VAS score &gt; 90 mm ) . The total volume ingest record . Symptoms assess 15 30 min cessation intake . If subject fulfils inclusion exclusion criterion include ingestion â‰¥400ml drink test consent continue appointment make gamma scintigraphy MRI study accord prospective randomization plan . MRI Study Day After eligibility confirm subject ingest paramagnetic contrast label liquid nutrient test meal accord standardize protocol . Subjects drink one series ten beaker contain 40ml liquid nutrient every minute . During test meal , subject score satiety , fullness , bloating , heartburn , nausea epigastric pain baseline , 5 10 minute use visual analogue scale ( VAS 0-100 mm ) . These measurement repeat 30min conclusion imaging study ( see ) . Studies perform use 1.5T whole MRI system ( Intera , Philips , Best , The Netherlands ) . Six rectangular surface coil ( height = 20 cm , width = 10 cm ) , fix around abdomen connect independent receive channel use signal detection . Gamma Scintigraphy Study Day After eligibility confirm subject ingest radiolabelled liquid nutrient test meal accord standardize protocol . Subjects drink one series ten beaker contain 40ml liquid nutrient every minute . During test meal , subject score satiety , fullness , bloating , heartburn , nausea epigastric pain baseline , 5 10 min use visual analogue scale ( VAS 0-100 mm ) .</detailed_description>
