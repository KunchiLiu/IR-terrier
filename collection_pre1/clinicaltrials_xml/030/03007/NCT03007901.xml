	<brief_title>Mindful Climate Action : Improving Health While Reducing Carbon Footprint</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This Pilot Study conduct allow u evaluate test various study process , include : consent/enrollment , run-in-trial monitoring , measurement tool , outcome assessment , educational material , especially mindfulness-based climate action training . The pilot study include control group , data use efficacy outcome analysis . The investigator anticipate two pilot cohort roughly 16 persons/group . The pilot cohorts simultaneous . Participants meet 2Â½ hour session , per week eight week . An additional 6-hour retreat schedule weekend towards end program . Participants receive 26 hour contact time . Their daily home practice guide audio recording ( 25 45 minute ) lead formal meditation practice body scan , sit meditation , gentle yoga . Participants ask practice 5 6 day per week home , use audio recording . They also ask select daily practice time work best , perhaps early morning , work , later even . Participants record practice long either paper log sheet use web-based data form . Climate change , energy , carbon footprint knowledge assess college intro-level test ( pre- post-training ) . Electrical gas use assess directly inspect Madison Gas Electric ( MG &amp; E ) utility record . Miles driven automobile assess self-report , verify odometer reading primary vehicle do study staff . Active transportation motor vehicle travel measure use free , smart phone app call MOVES . In order extract activity data user 's phone , participant download another free app call TRAQS CSV Exporter ( http : //labs.traqs.me/moves/ ) export data monthly course year . Individual movement/transportation activity data obtain app provide study team data allow in-depth fine-grained understanding transportation behavior across study time period . Dietary composition assess validated dietary recall , proportion dietary calorie animal versus plant source primary assessment . Composite carbon footprint calculate . In addition carbon footprint , investigator assess health co-benefits , include several domain mental physical health ( validated self-report measure ) active transport assess use Actigraph accelerometer . Participants ask provide feedback interview regard curriculum .</detailed_description>
	<criteria>Age 30 65 year enrollment assess selfreport date birth . This relatively broad age range facilitate enrollment enhance generalizability result . This range also tend include people moderate large carbon footprint , possibly allow room measurable improvement mindfulness training . Fluency English ( oral , reading , write ) necessary complete study parameter include : providing consent , completion questionnaire online survey , intervention objective . Willingness ability carry studyspecific task , include commitment provide data , wear ActiGraph one week twice course study , monitor throughout research study period . Participants must owner ( coowners ) single family dwelling , must location prior 12 month , expectation move study . Utility service single family dwell must provide MG &amp; E ( gas electric ) Madison Water Utility . This necessary accurately assess compare household energy water use across participant randomize group . Participants must ( coown lease ) automobile drive least 5000 mile per year ( assessed selfreport ) . The choice 5,000 mile cutoff arbitrary , exclude drive much , would therefore less capacity measureable improvement . People share use car one person drive majority mile include , people drive two primary vehicle . People regularly drive two vehicle exclude due add participant staff burden involve obtain odometer reading . Ownership , use , familiarity smart phone ( either iPhone Android type ) require due plan use MOVES app obtain major outcome data . Only one member per household allow participate . Participants exclude currently recently participate meditative practice mindfulness meditation training past 3 year . Assessed answer `` Yes '' follow question : Do meditate regular basis ? In last year , meditate least weekly 2 month row ? Have receive meditation train last 5 year ? Have take part mindfulness class mindfulness session past 5 year ? People selfdescribed vegan vegetarian diet ( selfassessed average meat ingestion frequency less once/week ) exclude , one goal training influence dietary habit away meat ( especially beef ) towards vegetable plantbased food . Only answer `` Yes '' `` Do tend eat least one meal meat day week ? '' eligible participate . People serious physical , medical , mental condition preclude adherence study protocol exclude . Questionable case review study physician . Those unable/unwilling successfully complete baseline assessment , include inperson meeting , datacollection , task exclude study . Inability complete sample study requirement indicate inability complete full study requirement .</criteria>
