	<brief_summary>The investigator propose conduct study test alternative dosing schedule palbociclib . With current three-week one week schedule , significant number patient develop grade 3 high degree neutropenia require dose reduction sometimes discontinuation . This potentially compromise efficacy drug . In addition , half-life palbociclib 27 hour , 1 week break standard 3 week 1 week dosing schedule could potentially lead recovery Rb phosphorylation week . Hence , investigator propose 5 day 2 day schedule week without week drug . Although cumulative dos 28-day cycle roughly schedule compare conventional dosing , bone marrow expose drug continuously 21 day rather get frequent break therapy . The investigator hypothesize 5 day 2 day schedule tolerable less frequent high grade neutropenia dose interruption/reduction . In addition , schedule also provide continuous drug delivery patient since week 's break therapy , could ultimately prove efficacious .</brief_summary>
