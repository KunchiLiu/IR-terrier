	<detailed_description>Telehealth-delivered PR show effective standard PR ( patient go outpatient set ) improve quality life , patient ' exercise capacity . However , study Latino population know effective telehealth PR among population . For study , investigator hope see help COPD Latino patient access need resource telehealth PR . They compare standard PR telehealth PR determine telehealth result well outcomes patient moderate severe COPD recently discharge hospital COPD . The primary outcome investigator assess change re-hospitalization rate . The secondary outcome include : change quality life , preparation make decision clinical care , improve functional capacity , decrease dyspnea , anxiety , depression .
