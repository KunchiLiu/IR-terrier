	<brief_summary>Open inguinal herniorrhaphy common outpatient surgical procedure . Post-operative pain significant hindrance discharge post anesthesia care unit . Pain treat opioid therapy , literature support agent know create exacerbate adverse effect complication , include post-operative nausea vomiting , hypoxia , urinary retention . In contrast , analgesia provide regional anesthesia result decrease risk aforementioned complications.1 Because , various regional anesthetic technique develop provide analgesia follow open herniorrhaphy . One technique combine ilioinguinal iliohypogastric nerve block ( IINB ) , show decrease initial pain inguinal herniorrhaphy.2 The quadratus lumborum block ( QLB ) new regional anesthetic technique think could effective IINB provide pain control follow open herniorrhaphy . Additionally , local anesthetic inject QLB potential spread cranially thoracic paravertebral space follow lumbar deposition could lead alleviation somatic visceral pain.3 This might therefore improve quality duration analgesia compare IINB . To best author 's knowledge investigation compare efficacy , regard post-operative pain management , IINB QLB .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>IINB vs. QLB Elective Open Inguinal Herniorrhaphy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This study double-blinded prospective randomize controlled equivalency trial compare QLB IINB . Patients present unilateral open inguinal herniorrhaphy agree participate study meet exclusion criterion randomize either receive IINB QLB post-operative analgesia . After perform timeout , apply monitor ( ECG , capnography , Sp02 , non-invasive blood pressure ) , confirm paperwork per usual pre-procedural check list study participant administer procedural sedation ( fentanyl midazolam ) comfort well supplemental oxygen . The anatomy block site identify palpation landmark , label structure skin mark pen , visualization ultrasound guidance . Both site administer small skin wheal lidocaine 1 % site block needle would introduce skin . Our intent regard administer local anesthetic skin wheal increase success blind patient block actually perform . A regional anesthetic block perform randomize block site ( IINB vs. QLB ) . After 15-30 minute post block post operatively block assess success . Loss cold sensation area surgical site would indicative block success . The patient proceed operate room receive general anesthetic final detail anesthetic determine anesthesiologist responsible patient operating room . We ask operate room anesthesiologist surgeon avoid administration medication would confound result . Specifically , additional local anesthetic inject incision site , long act opioids ( hydromorphone , morphine , methadone etcâ€¦ ) , dexamethasone ketamine . After completion procedure patient recover post anesthesia care unit ( PACU ) participant recover per usual process . The patient 's discharge disposition discretion surgeon anesthesiologist responsible participant 's PACU care . The patient provide diary participant complete 8hrs 24hrs post block help participant compile data pertinent investigator primary secondary outcome . This diary take minute two sampling time . Participants receive two phone call home obtain data 8hrs 24hrs .</detailed_description>
