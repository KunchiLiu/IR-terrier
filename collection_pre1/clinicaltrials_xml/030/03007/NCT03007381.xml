	<brief_summary>Background : Ketorolac tromethamine nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug show reduce breakthrough narcotic consumption follow orthopaedic , neurosurgical , obstetrical procedure . The morphine-sparing effect ketorolac may reduce respiratory central nervous system depression post operatively , still provide adequate pain control patient . Patients undergo abdominally base microsurgical breast reconstruction may particularly benefit ketorolac postoperatively , ultimately safely discharged hospital sooner counterpart receive standard care . Research Question : In adult woman post-mastectomy , undergo abdominally base microsurgical breast reconstruction , postoperative regimen intravenous ketorolac tromethamine , addition standard care , reduce length postoperative hospital stay compare intravenous sham saline regimen ? Study Design : A single center , explanatory , placebo-controlled , 1:1 allocation , 2-arm , parallel group , superiority , randomize , double blind , control trial . Population : The study population include female &gt; 18 year old post mastectomy consent abdominally base microsurgical breast reconstruction . Intervention Comparator : The intervention ketorolac 30 mg IV every 6 hour postoperatively 72 hour . The comparator sham intravenous administration normal saline . Outcomes : The primary outcome hospital length stay postoperatively . Secondary outcome include visual analog scale pain , breakthrough narcotic consumption , surgical drain output , hematoma , complication . Sample Size : Available data provide estimate average length hospital stay standard deviation . A minimally clinically significant difference 1 day decide due expert opinion . Based power 80 % alpha 0.05 , inflate account attrition efficiency loss , total 50 patient ( 25 per group ) require study .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Ketorolac Analgesia followiNG Autologous Breast RecOnstructiOn</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Breast reconstruction ( BR ) commonly request follow mastectomy , recent measure take ensure patient access universal . Transferring autologous tissue abdomen use microvascular surgical technique provide reliable reconstruction method high level patient satisfaction , routinely perform . However , surgery relatively complex lengthy ; operative time exceed six hour hospital stay range 5-9 day . During patient 's postoperative course must meet certain milestone discharge . It show beyond necessary monitoring viability free flap , pain patient 's ability mobilize important modifiable barrier discharge . Pain control follow autologous BR multimodal , predominantly rely opioids . Narcotics provide effective analgesia , well-known side effect profile include drowsiness , nausea , vomit , sedation , central nervous system respiratory depression . Each potential adverse effect limit patient ' mobility surgery . Respiratory depression particularly disadvantageous , patient undergo major abdominal musculature dissection also disrupt mechanic breathe 10 . This may counterproductive effect limit patient mobilization , ultimately delay discharge . In health care system resource premium cost climb , inexpensive intervention allow early safe discharge worthy consideration . No standard approach postoperative pain control free flap BR exist . Most protocols institution dependent , variably incorporate narcotic , nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug ( NSAIDs ) , acetaminophen agent . In addition , medication give via oral , intramuscular , intravenous route . Recent study investigate use transversus abdominis plane block analgesic adjunct , patient often provide patient-controlled analgesia ( PCA ) pump early postoperative period . Ketorolac tromethamine NSAID , approve Health Canada short-term pain control ( Toradol , Hoffmann-La Roche Limited , 7070 Mississauga Road Mississauga , Ontario ) . Ketorolac provide good pain control commonly use NSAIDs , potency comparable morphine . However , listed side effect drowsiness respiratory depression narcotic . Surgeons often cite concern regard postoperative bleeding use NSAIDs , however recent review convincingly demonstrate safety use NSAIDs plastic surgery . A previous observational study also show safety ketorolac specifically follow autologous BR . The routine addition ketorolac follow surgery show reduce patient ' narcotic requirement field surgery , orthopaedics gynaecology . Given abovementioned advantage ketorolac , particular propensity abdominally base free flap BR patient negatively affect narcotic side effect , hypothesize addition ketorolac routine multimodal postoperative analgesia regimen reduce hospital stay day . The comparator study placebo . Patients randomize control group randomize intervention group receive standard care postoperatively , include pain control schedule acetaminophen pro nata oral subcutaneous hydromorphone . In addition , control patient receive placebo scheduling study drug , ketorolac . The rationale choice limit potential source bias , patient care team , maximize accuracy primary outcome patient-completed questionnaire serve secondary outcome . Other author previously successfully use placebo ketorolac study design . The majority surgeon institution currently employ ketorolac postoperative pain control regimen . Thus , exist clinical equipoise patient consider participate potentially randomize control group , compare decline participation receive usual care . This study single-centered conduct Nova Scotia , Canada . The Halifax Infirmary level III trauma center multiple board certify Plastic surgeon undertake extra training microsurgery . Participants remove study upon request . Her data point use statistical analysis , however would longer receive intervention . Modifications intervention dose would occur participant develops drug hypersensitivity reaction . Additionally major harm attribute ketorolac prompt termination intervention . Each patient undergo uni- bilateral abdominally base free flap harvest , microsurgical anastomosis , flap inset . Following randomization , study drug send main operating theatre , attach patient 's medical chart . At conclusion surgery , patient administer first dose study drug . Its content depend patient 's randomize group . If randomize ketorolac intervention group , IV minibag contain 30 mg ketorolac tromethamine , control group sham normal saline IV minibag . They continue receive assign drug every 6 hour 72 hour . Patients receive 1:1 care nurse staff early postoperative period , nurse administer drug give surgical ward . All patient enrol receive usual care postoperative period . The study drug addition usual flap monitoring , patient vital sign monitoring , progression mobilization , drain management , along care provide patient . Patients also background analgesic anti-emetics medication order postoperatively , include standardize pre-printed order form Halifax Infirmary particular surgery . Potential participant first introduce study follow initial consultation BR . If patient consent abdominally base microsurgical BR , study review , allow time question ask , risk benefit discuss . The patient send home study package include copy study consent form protocol . The study review preoperative appointment , allow time follow question ask . This routine appointment intend marking patient question regard surgery , patient officially enrol study wish participate either time-point - initial consultation preoperative appointment . Following surgery , patient remain active study discharge hospital . No follow appointment data schedule recorded purpose study ( although follow occur per usual patient respective surgeon ) . Therefore total enrolment time patient appointment immediately surgery discharge hospital . A computer-generated algorithm use randomize patient 1:1 allocation intervention control group surgery . Randomization stratify laterality reconstruction ( i.e . bi- unilateral ) could affect participant pain level . Randomization manage maintain third party service , otherwise involve study , hospital pharmacy department . Allocation method disclose study investigator . Following randomization , study drug send main operating theatre , give conclusion surgery . Both intervention control drug storage opacity prevent identification patient care provider . From , patient administer drug accord randomization result , base delivery third party pharmacy service . Randomization carry within pharmacy department place patient either intervention control group . The intervention control intravenous drug prepare style IV minibag volume opacity fluid . The fluid similar viscosity . Once similar appearance feature confirm prepared drug send operating theatre ward require depending time point . During conduction study involve trial participant , clinician , data collector , event adjudicator , data analyst blind group patient . All study medication store hospital pharmacy department third party . Following randomization , treatment drug dispense pharmacy administer nursing staff . The third party service maintain record link patient unique identifier study group . Post hoc analysis ass whether staff could identify intervention placebo conduct . Harms classify either minor major . Minor harm include surgical site infection list prior clinical trial drug monograph , namely : Common Clinical Trial Adverse Drug Reactions ( &gt; 1 % ) : Dyspepsia , abdominal pain , nausea , constipation , diarrhea , flatulence , gastrointestinal fullness , peptic ulcer , headache , dizziness , somnolence , edema Less Common Clinical Trial Adverse Drug Reactions ( â‰¤ 1 % ) : Eructation , stomatitis , vomit , anorexia , duodenal ulcer , gastritis , increase appetite , melena , mouth ulceration , rectal bleeding , sore mouth , abnormal dream , anxiety , depression , dry mouth , insomnia , nervousness , paresthesia , tinnitus , taste perversion , abnormal vision , blur vision , deafness , lacrimation disorder , weight gain , alkaline phosphatase increase , BUN increase , excessive thirst , generalize edema , hyperuricemia , pruritus , rash , burn sensation , asthenia , pain , back pain , face edema , hernia , arthralgia , myalgia , joint disorder , chest pain , chest pain substernal , migraine , dyspnea , asthma , epistaxis , hematuria , increase urinary frequency , oliguria , polyuria , anemia , purpura No major harm anticipate . Major harm include limited ( * indicate possible association oral ketorolac drug monograph , &lt; 1 % ) : Surgical site hemorrhage require re-exploration main operating theatre Gastrointestinal hemorrhage* Pulmonary embolus Death Any harm identify care provider enrolment study communicate principal sub investigator .
