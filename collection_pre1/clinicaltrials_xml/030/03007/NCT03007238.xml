	<brief_summary>This phase II trial study efficacy extracorporeal photopheresis low dose aldesleukin ( interleukin-2 ) treat patient chronic graft-versus-host disease ( cGVHD ) respond upfront treatment steroid . In graft-vs-host disease , patient small quantity white blood cell call T regulatory cell T-reg cell help control immune system . Extracorporeal photopheresis procedure patient 's blood remove treated ultraviolet light drug become active exposed light . The treated blood return patient may effective increase T-reg cell patient cGVHD . Aldesleukin increase activity growth white blood cell , show enhance T-reg cell patient cGVHD may effective improve GVHD symptom .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To evaluate anti-cGVHD activity extracorporeal photopheresis ( ECP ) combine low dose IL-2 ( interleukin 2 ) ( aldesleukin ) , patient steroid refractory cGVHD , assess overall cGVHD response rate ( complete response [ CR ] +partial response [ PR ] +stable disease [ SD ] ) . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . Characterize evaluate toxicity , include type , frequency , severity , attribution , time course duration . II . Estimate overall failure-free survival , non-relapse mortality ( NRM ) relapse , 1 year initiation treatment . III . Characterize chronic GVHD Symptom Scale score -self-report ( assistance register nurse [ RNs ] medical doctor [ MDs ] ) . IV . Assess immunologic effect low-dose daily subcutaneous ( SC ) IL-2 + ECP . V. Correlate clinical endpoint response ECP performance parameter . OUTLINE : Patients receive aldesleukin subcutaneously ( SC ) daily 12 week . Patients also undergo ECP twice weekly week 1-4 receive 2 ECP treatment every 2 week week 5-12 . Patients respond upfront therapy aldesleukin ECP option continue combination therapy per discretion treat physician clinical benefit maintain toxicity develop . After completion study treatment , patient follow periodically .</detailed_description>
