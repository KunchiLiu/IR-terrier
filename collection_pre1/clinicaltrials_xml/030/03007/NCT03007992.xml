	<brief_title>Metronomic Treatment With Daily Oral Vinorelbine First-line Chemotherapy Patients With Advanced/Metastatic Hormone Receptor Positive ( HR+ ) /Human Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor 2 Negative ( HER2- ) Breast Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>In term chronic nature advanced/metastatic breast cancer , high medical need new treatment option failure hormonal treatment prolong interval start intensive cytotoxic therapy , commonly associate impaired quality life ( QoL ) potentially serious side effect . In respect , metronomic treatment daily administration oral vinorelbine could provide efficacious treatment option limit toxicity . Accordingly , national , multi-centre , open-label , single-arm phase II trial aim investigate truly metronomic schedule daily oral vinorelbine HR+/HER2-patients metastatic breast cancer resistant endocrine therapy , assess efficacy safety . Oral vinorelbine administer daily dose 30 mg ( flat dose without adaptation body weight body surface area ) without break . Treatment continue disease progression , occurrence unacceptable toxicity , patient 's refusal investigator 's decision stop treatment . In course study , follow interim final analysis do : ) 1st interim analysis ( safety ) : This analysis perform basis 10 patient , initially include study eligible safety evaluation ; frequency statistic ( serious ) adverse event analyse . ii ) 2nd interim analysis ( efficacy ) : This analysis perform completion 1st Simon stage . iii ) Final analysis ( complete ) : This analysis perform completion follow-up phase ( 6 month follow-up Last Patient Last Treatment ) .</detailed_description>
