	<brief_summary>This study do look safety response combination two investigational drug , tremelimumab durvalumab , give radiation therapy patient microsatellite stable ( MSS ) metastatic colorectal cancer . Tremelimumab durvalumab recognize specific proteins surface cancer cell trigger immune system destroy cancer cell . In order learn certain characteristic colorectal cancer tumor , study include special research test use sample diagnostic tumor , fresh tumor sample area cancer spread , blood sample .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Study Durvalumab Tremelimumab After Radiation Microsatellite Stable Metastatic Colorectal Cancer Progressing Chemotherapy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The FC-9 study design phase II , open label , single arm study dual immune checkpoint blockade combination durvalumab tremelimumab follow hypofractionated palliative radiation patient microsatellite stable ( MSS ) metastatic colorectal cancer ( mCRC ) progress chemotherapy . The primary aim determine anti-tumor efficacy dual immune checkpoint blockade durvalumab plus tremelimumab . The secondary aim determine clinical benefit rate , duration response , tolerability correlate response . Tumor response unirradiated target lesion measure baseline every 2 cycle use RECIST 1.1 . Following three dos hypofractionated palliative radiation ( Days −2 , −1 , Day 0 prior Cycle 1 ) , patient receive combination tremelimumab ( 75 mg IV infusion ) durvalumab ( 1500 mg IV infusion ) Day 1 4 cycle . Beginning Cycle 5 Cycle 12 , patient receive durvalumab alone ( 1500 mg/IV infusion ) Day 1 28 day cycle . The sample size 12 21 evaluable patient . Twelve evaluable patient treat first stage study . If response among 12 evaluable patient , study terminate . If study go second stage , total 21 evaluable patient study . Submission tumor tissue blood sample FC-9 correlative science study study requirement patient . Requirements include archived tumor sample diagnostic biopsy ; additional biopsy fresh tissue accessible lesion prior radiation therapy 2 cycle study therapy ; blood sample collection .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>The ECOG performance status must 0 1 . There must histologic confirmation diagnosis colorectal adenocarcinoma . The tumor must determine microsatellite stable ( MSS ) . There must documentation PET/CT scan , CT scan , MRI , patient evidence measurable metastatic disease per RECIST 1.1 . Patients must accessible metastatic lesion pretreatment core biopsy . Unless either drug medically contraindicate , patient must receive oxaliplatin irinotecan part standard metastatic chemotherapy regimen . The patient must multiple site metastatic disease least one lesion amenable treatment stereotactic radiation therapy ( SBRT ) lung liver least one lesion irradiate meet RECIST 1.1 . At time study entry , blood count perform within 2 week prior study entry must meet following criterion : ANC must great equal 1500/mm3 , Platelet count must great equal 100,000/mm3 ; Hemoglobin must great equal 9 g/dL . The following criterion evidence adequate hepatic function perform within 2 week prior study entry must meet : Total bilirubin must less equal 1.5 x ULN ( upper limit normal ) lab unless patient bilirubin elevation great 1.5 x ULN 3 x ULN due Gilbert 's disease similar syndrome involve slow conjugation bilirubin ; AST ALT must less equal 2.5 x ULN lab follow exception : patient document liver metastasis , AST ALT must less equal 5 x ULN . Adequate renal function within 4 week prior study entry , define serum creatinine less equal 1.5 x ULN lab measure calculated creatinine clearance great 40 mL/min CockcroftGault formula . All hematologic , gastrointestinal , genitourinary chemotherapy toxicity must less Grade 2 time study therapy begin . ( Note : Transfusions may use correct hemoglobin patient experience anemia therapy otherwise would eligible study . Patients reproductive potential ( male/female ) must agree use accept highly effective method contraception receive study therapy least 6 month completion study therapy . The definition effective method contraception base investigator 's discretion . Female patient must either nonreproductive potential ( i.e. , postmenopausal history : great equal 60 year old menses great equal 1 year without alternative medical cause ; OR history hysterectomy , OR history bilateral tubal ligation , OR history bilateral oophorectomy ) must negative serum pregnancy test upon study entry . Diagnosis anal small bowel carcinoma . Colorectal cancer adenocarcinoma , e.g. , sarcoma , lymphoma , carcinoid . Previous therapy PD1 PDL1 inhibitor include durvalumab antiCTLA4 ( include tremelimumab ) malignancy . Receipt live attenuate vaccination within 30 day prior study entry within 30 day receive study therapy . Active chronic hepatitis B hepatitis C. Symptomatic uncontrolled brain metastasis require concurrent treatment , uncontrolled spinal cord compression , carcinomatous meningitis , new evidence brain leptomeningeal disease ; uncontrolled seizure . Active infection chronic infection require chronic suppressive antibiotic . Active document inflammatory disease . Known history human immunodeficiency virus ( HIV ) acquire immunodeficiencyrelated ( AIDS ) illnesses . Current prior use immunosuppressive medication within 28 day first dose study therapy exception intranasal corticosteroid systemic corticosteroid physiological dos exceed 10mg/day prednisone equivalent corticosteroid . History allogeneic organ transplantation . Any following cardiac condition : Documented NYHA Class III IV congestive heart failure , Myocardial infarction within 6 month prior study entry , Unstable angina within 6 month prior study entry , Symptomatic arrhythmia . If QTc great equal 470ms , confirmation eligible QTc require mean calculation 2 additional electrocardiogram ( ECGs ) 2−5 minute apart use Fridericia 's Correction Formula ( mean less 470 m ) . Uncontrolled high blood pressure define systolic blood pressure ( BP ) great equal 150 mmHg diastolic BP great equal 100 mmHg without antihypertensive medication . Patients initial BP elevation eligible initiation adjustment BP medication lower pressure meet entry criterion . Active prior document inflammatory bowel disease ( e.g. , Crohn 's disease , ulcerative colitis ) . Ongoing active gastritis peptic ulcer disease . Active bleeding diatheses . Known history previous diagnosis tuberculosis . History hypersensitivity durvalumab tremelimumab excipients drug . Known history confirmation active pneumonia , pneumonitis , symptomatic interstitial lung disease , definitive evidence interstitial lung disease describe CT scan , MRI , chest xray asymptomatic patient ; dyspnea rest require current continuous oxygen therapy . Active prior document autoimmune disease within past 2 year . ( Note : Patients vitiligo , Grave disease , psoriasis require systemic treatment within past 2 year eligible . ) Other malignancy unless patient consider diseasefree complete therapy malignancy great equal 12 month prior study entry . Patients follow cancer eligible diagnose treat within past 12 month : carcinoma situ cervix , basal cell squamous cell carcinoma skin . Psychiatric addictive disorder condition , opinion investigator , would preclude patient meeting study requirement interfere interpretation study result . Pregnancy lactation time study entry . ( Note : Pregnancy test perform within 14 day prior study entry accord institutional standard woman childbearing potential . ) Use investigational agent . Use and/or receipt last dose anticancer therapy ( chemotherapy , immunotherapy , endocrine therapy , target therapy , biologic therapy , tumor embolization , monoclonal antibody ) within 14 day prior first dose study therapy .</criteria>
