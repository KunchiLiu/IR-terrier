	<brief_summary>Early Aspiration Pneumonia frequent dreadful complication survivor cardiac arrest . Therapeutic Hypothermia widely use Intensive Care Unit benefice post cardiac arrest syndrome may otherwise hide sign early pneumonia may occur without use reliable screen biological marker . The goal ass diagnostic accuracy bronchial alpha amylase measure predict risk early aspiration pneumonia patient successfully resuscitate out-of-hospital cardiac arrest . In prospective non interventional study include patient resuscitate cardiac arrest treat Targeted Temperature Management ( TTM ) . A distal bronchoalveolar lavage use specific display ( Combi-Cath ) execute immediately admission patient biochemic bacteriological analysis include dosage bronchial salivary alpha amylase . Urea use marker dilution measure bronchial plasmatic alpha amylase . Aspiration pneumonia diagnosis establish clinical biological criterion . On basis intend determine threshold measure alpha amylase predict occurrence aspiration pneumonia allow guidance antibiotherapy prescription . Sensibility Specificity technique determine .</brief_summary>
