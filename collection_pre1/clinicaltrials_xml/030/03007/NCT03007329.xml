	<brief_summary>SGLT2 antagonists GLP1 agonist use since relatively short period second line therapy indicate well tolerated patient feature low risk hypoglycaemia comparison insulin oral glucose lower drug . This new treatment option offer effective modality lower blood glucose , first line therapeutic fail . According national international guideline combination oral glucose lower drug possible multiple way , currently recommend GLP1 agonist SGLT2 inhibitor yet , evidence support study miss prove efficacy safety ] . Thus study standardize condition urgently need answer unsolved question . First result combination SGLT2 Inhibitor GLP1 agonist demonstrate huge potential regard glucose weight reduction safety issue . However , study necessary elucidate potential mechanism combination therapy SGLT2 inhibitor GLP1 agonist effect weight loss , glucose control , effect incretins adipokines , well effect ectopic lipid accumulation liver tissue myocard pancreas human . As monotherapies effect weight metabolism , change abdominal , subcutaneous , hepatic , myocardial pancreatic lipid content might speculate focus interest study . Recently GLP1 agonists show effect hepatic lipid reduction human diabetes . Hepatic lipid content steatosis hepatis widely discuss major effect progression diabetes cardiovascular disease . Thus reduction lipid accumulation hepatic tissue might effect diabetes progression . Also high myocardial lipid accumulation see diabetic patient probably partly responsible high cardiovascular risk diabetic . So far result combine two drug class show less weight loss might expect use monotherapy , investigation definitely shed light combination therapeutic concept . Facing multiple positive side effect ( weight loss , blood pressure lowering , potential protective cardiac effect ) use combination SGLT2 GLP1 seem promising therapeutic option diabetic subject .</brief_summary>
