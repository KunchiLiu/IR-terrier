	<brief_summary>This single-center cross-sectional imaging study patient localize bladder cancer undergo neoadjuvant atezolizumab part companion clinical trial ( NCT02451423 ; Phase 2 study atezolizumab non-metastatic bladder transitional cell carcinoma ) , patient locally advance metastatic bladder cancer receive standard care ( SOC ) atezolizumab . For neoadjuvant cohort , study participant undergo whole body PET ( Positron Emission Tomography ) /MR ( Magnetic Resonance ) image [ 18F ] F-AraG within 7 day initiate atezolizumab within 7 day surgery . For SOC cohort , study participant undergo whole body PET/MR image [ 18F ] F-AraG within 7 day initiate atezolizumab Day 14 Day 21 Cycle 1 atezolizumab .</brief_summary>

For SOC cohort , study participant undergo whole body PET/MR image [ 18F ] F-AraG within 7 day initiate atezolizumab Day 14 Day 21 Cycle 1 atezolizumab , Simon 's two-stage design utilized . A total 31 patient enrolled accrual period approximately 20 month . 12 patient enrol neoadjuvant atezolizumab cohort , approximately 19 patient enrol SOC atezolizumab cohort . Patients evaluate one day one week via telephone visit radiopharmaceutical injection safety follow-up . All adverse event record . Due noninvasive non-therapeutic nature study , potential risk study anticipate low . To investigator 's knowledge , first study investigate change activate T cell localization set immunotherapy bladder cancer utilize functional PET imaging .</detailed_description>
