	<brief_summary>An array soft tissue augmentation technique employ concomitant implant placement , free connective tissue graft pedicle graft keratinize tissue thicken attempt augment soft tissue well resistance inflammation improve esthetic stability , preserve buccal bone thickness well . Results obtain literature controversial regard need soft tissue augmentation curb buccal bone resorption preserve pink esthetic . Scarce literature find , monitor ridge alteration follow implant placement . Our study monitor effect soft tissue augmentation soft tissue esthetic buccal bone resorption process remodel measurable way .</brief_summary>
