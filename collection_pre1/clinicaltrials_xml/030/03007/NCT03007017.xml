	<brief_summary>Despite many effort increase size donor pool , large grow disparity number donor kidney available transplantation number patient transplant wait list . Increasing quality currently available donor kidney would potentially improve longevity decease donor kidney transplant year , thus increase rate transplantation patient kidney transplant wait list . In addition , recipients high quality kidney shorter hospital stay low total hospital charge . By innovate organ donation process , decease donor kidney remove prior cessation cardiac activity , rather , may possible improve quality kidney transplantation , result improve function transplantation increase longevity transplant kidney . Further , improve kidney quality highly likely translate reduce need renal dialysis high-cost intervention , yield low total hospital charge . In study test hypothesis , cost-free technical innovation , quality decease donor kidney could improve significantly , save thousand life per year reduce total health care expenditures renal transplantation .</brief_summary>
