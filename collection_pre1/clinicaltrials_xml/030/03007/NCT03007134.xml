	<brief_summary>The purpose study ( 1 ) compare technically improve assay exist assay use measure serum anti-GM-CSF antibody store serum sample previously obtain patient diagnose either primary , secondary , congenital idiopathic pulmonary alveolar proteinosis ( PAP ) , chronic disease disease-free , healthy individual ; ( 2 ) determine prevalence level anti-GM-CSF autoantibody ( 3 ) define breadth autoimmune antibody response primary PAP patient United States , Japan , Australia , Europe use previously collect serum sample ; ( 4 ) use chart review approach , compare clinical , radiologic laboratory feature primary PAP patient determine difference exist among patient globally geographically distributed region .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Multicenter International Cross-Sectional Evaluation Pulmonary Alveolar Proteinosis Trial</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The Rare Lung Disease Consortium ( RLDC ) , group geographically-dispersed clinical research sit , establish conduct collaborative clinical research regard rare lung disease . The collaborative work include diagnostic , therapeutic study patient pulmonary alveolar proteinosis ( PAP ) , lymphangioleiomyomatosis ( LAM ) , alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency ( AATD ) , hereditary interstitial lung disease . These patient delay incorrect diagnosis , sub-optimal clinical management . The present protocol focus individual PAP . PAP occur primary , secondary , congenital idiopathic form . RLDC investigator previously show primary PAP strongly associate high level circulate , neutralize anti-GM-CSF autoantibody . Absence GM-CSF bioactivity think impair alveolar macrophage blood neutrophil function include reduce surfactant catabolism ( alveolar macrophage - think result surfactant accumulation primary PAP ) immune dysfunction ( neutrophil dysfunction , possibly macrophage dysfunction - thought increase risk infection primary PAP ) . Secondary PAP cause underlying condition believe impair alveolar macrophage surfactant catabolism . Secondary PAP related condition , include myelogenous leukemia , infection environmental exposure . Congenital PAP cause mutation gene encode surfactant protein ( SP ) -B , SP-C ABCA3 transporter . Idiopathic PAP result unknown mechanism . Anti-GM-CSF autoantibody appear absent secondary , congenital idiopathic PAP . This cross sectional study protocol design evaluate autoimmune aspect PAP patient currently follow clinical investigator Rare Lung Disease Consortium ( RLDC ) . The study involve retrospective chart review serological analysis preexisting , store serum sample individual diagnose PAP . Thus , study involve direct interaction contact PAP patient study participant . It yield diagnostic information regard use anti-granulocyte macrophage-colony stimulating factor ( GM-CSF ) autoantibody test patient PAP . It also yield information extent autoimmune response primary PAP . In addition , study compare/contrast clinical phenotype individual anti-GM-CSF autoantibody-positive PAP various region world . A stringent evaluation autoimmune aspect PAP include rigorous anti-GM-CSF antibody test provide good understand PAP expect confirm usefulness serum anti-GM-CSF antibody test clinical diagnosis PAP . The study evaluate rate serious opportunistic infection clinical demographic data patient various region world determine significant difference exist , provide important knowledge regard infectious complication associate PAP .</detailed_description>
