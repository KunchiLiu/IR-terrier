	<brief_summary>Post-traumatic headache ( PTH ) common complaint traumatic brain injury , possibly generate number stressor trigeminovascular cervical plexus network , include inflammation high cervical facet joint , traumatic cranial neuralgia , migraine , myofascial injury . To date , treatment guideline exist PTH management except conservative modality , cognitive rest , physical therapy , neuropathic pain medication , minimal evidence support . The investigator propose randomize , control , clinical trial prospective follow-up study evaluate effect invasive procedure occipital nerve block ( ONB ) cervical medial branch block ( CMBB ) management PTH .

	<detailed_description>Headaches neck pain follow concussion potentially treatable resolve time . Nerve blockade may enhance recovery appropriate neural circuit involve pathophysiology chronic headache . Currently , evidence-based guideline exist treatment PTH . Adoption `` brain rest '' 1-2 week , follow gradual return activity avoid `` second-impact syndrome '' current practice . The use medication control neuropathic pain partial benefit . Adverse effect like sedation , mood change , cardiac side effect pharmacologic agent often compatible demand athletics . For patient sport performance paramount , may therefore able tolerate regular medication . The incidence chronic post-concussive headache ( &gt; 3 month ) one year 8.4 % - 35 % four year 25 % . Therefore , patient significant disability post-traumatic headache many year injury . Without appropriate treatment , headache remain chronic headache . Over-the-counter symptomatic medication overuse exacerbate prolong PTH significantly , secondary rebound headache . Successful treatment essential since PTH limit return sport well general activity live , work school . Most intervention currently use partially help take several week month noticeable benefit . PTH intervention , include ONB CMBB , employ treatment primary headache disorder neck pain cervical arthritis may provide improve , faster sustain pain relief many patient . Also , give action nerve block local , significantly few side effect standard headache medication . Injections use corticosteroid may beneficial post-traumatic headache reduce inflammation therefore mechanical allodynia . Injection corticosteroids cervical facet joint area show 13 month pain relief . This prolonged effect may secondary central pain modulation . Ultimately , nerve block may effective efficient post-traumatic headache give onset effect minimal side effect . To date , prospective study procedural treatment medically refractory PTH none adolescent young adult population football injury common . Despite frequent clinical practice use ONB CMBB occipital neuralgia , cervical arthritis , cervicogenic headache , adequate scientific investigation use intervention PTH . Given PTH typically felt secondary inflammatory reaction trauma , use injection corticosteroid may effective PTH common headache disorder . The investigator propose randomize , prospective , control treatment trial evaluate efficacy minimally invasive nerve block intervention ( ONB CMBB ) treatment PTH neck pain adolescent adult age 14-35 year age PTH .</detailed_description>
