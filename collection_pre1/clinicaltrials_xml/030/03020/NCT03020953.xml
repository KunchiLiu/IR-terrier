	<brief_summary>Purpose : study effect estrogen replacement muscle hypertrophy response 12 week resistance training postmenopausal woman Hypothesis : Transdermal administration 17-β estradiol enhance anabolic effect resistance training muscle mass , strength postmenopausal woman Primary outcome : Muscle hypertrophy ( muscle CSA , muscle fiber type specific CSA ) Secondary outcome : Messenger RiboNucleic Acid ( mRNA ) ( real-time PCR ) , protein ( western blotting ) , satellite cell proliferation activation , Strength , functional test , muscle protein synthese . Design : Two group healthy postmenopausal woman ( ½-5 year menopause ) perform regular resistance exercise ( &lt; 1 time per week ) last two year . Randomized , control intervention study +/- transdermal administration estrogen ( 17-β estradiol ) . Both group perform 12 week supervise progressive resistance training ( 3/week ) aim induce muscle hypertrophy leg .</brief_summary>
