	<detailed_description>Before consent patient thoroughly inform possible risk benefit possibility end study time point ask additional sedation feel uncomfortable anxious . After consent , randomly assign either receive standard sedation ( Group 1 ) audiovisual distraction ( Group 2 ) . Each group consist 30 patient . The randomization schedule create member Healthcare Research Institute use SAS software , otherwise involved trial . 1 . Standard care sedation initial dose midazolam preparation administration neuraxial anesthesia ; propofol infusion titrated effect . 2 . Audiovisual distraction surgery recovery room use video goggles headphone ; patient choose movie preexisting library ; initial dose midazolam preparation administration neuraxial anesthesia , additional sedation midazolam 1 mg increment request patient deem necessary anesthesia provider . The intraoperative anesthesia regimen standardize : - All patient monitor accord American Society Anesthesiologists standard , receive either radial arterial line non-invasive blood pressure measurement accord preference anesthesia provider O2 via nasal cannula face mask operation room recovery room . - ondansetron , decadron ketorolac may administer per clinical judgment attend anesthesiologist . - Patients group receive neuraxial anesthesia . The attend anesthesiologist free add ultrasound guide peripheral nerve block : - Neuraxial anesthesia ( combine spinal-epidural , epidural spinal ) prefer attend anesthesiologist . Decadron may use addition local anesthetic anesthesia provider wish . - If peripheral nerve block perform appropriate amount bupivacaine administer ultrasound-guidance single shot . - In case epidural catheter place patient receive patient control epidural analgesia immediately arrival recovery room postoperative pain management . - Opioids medication sedative respiratory depressant side effect specifically mention omit ( possible without harm patient ) Patients audiovisual distraction group choose movie , start watch hold area continue watch operation room well first 30 min recovery room .
