	<brief_title>BPM31510 Treating Patients With Recurrent Glioblastoma Gliosarcoma Previously Treated With Bevacizumab</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I. Assess safety tolerability BPM31510 plus vitamin K subject glioblastoma ( GB ) recur bevacizumab ( BEV ) -containing regimen . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . To evaluate plasma pharmacokinetics ( PK ) BPM31510 plus vitamin K give subject GB recurrent BEV-containing regimen . TERTIARY OBJECTIVES : I . Estimate overall survival subject GB recurrent BEV-containing regimen 1st day infusion BPM31510 plus vitamin K death . II . To evaluate effect BPM31510 plus vitamin K shift GB metabolism aerobic respiration positron emission tomography ( PET ) imaging . III . To evaluate effect BPM1510 plus vitamin K magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) image Response Assessment Neuro-Oncology ( RANO ) criterion ( specifically progression-free survival [ PFS ] response rate [ RR ] ) . IV . To evaluate plasma pharmacodynamics ( PD ) BPM31510 plus vitamin K give subject GB recurrent BEV-containing regimen . OUTLINE : This dose-escalation study . Patients receive ubidecarenone injectable nanosuspension intravenously ( IV ) 72 hour twice weekly . Courses repeat every 28 day absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . After completion study treatment , patient follow every 12 week .</detailed_description>
