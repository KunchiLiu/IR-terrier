	<brief_summary>Preliminary study show NPPV avoid tracheal intubation 40 % 60 % patient severe exacerbation COPD . Recently , large-scale comparative effectiveness research ( CER ) also find compare invasive ventilation , NPPV reduce mortality rate . But 's high-quality clinical study confirm . Therefore , investigator believe NPPV avoid intubation patient severe exacerbation COPD ICU perfect monitoring condition reasonable human resource allocation , order reduce IMV-related complication improve patient ' outcome .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>In part patient AECOPD pH &lt; 7.25 , preliminary study show NPPV avoid tracheal intubation 40 % 60 % patient , also reduce incidence VAP . Recently , large-scale comparative effectiveness research ( CER ) also find compare invasive ventilation , NPPV reduce mortality rate . At present , 's high-quality clinical study confirm , clinical guideline recommendation use NPPV patient . Therefore , investigator believe NPPV avoid intubation patient severe exacerbation COPD ICU perfect monitoring condition reasonable human resource allocation , well progress medical technology NPPV recent year , order reduce IMV-related complication improve patient ' outcome .</detailed_description>
