	<brief_title>Study Efficacy Early Intervention With Secukinumab 300 mg s.c . Compared Narrow-band UVB Patients With New-onset Moderate Severe Plaque Psoriasis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The overall study population ( Main Study Mechanistic Sub-study ) consist total 205 male female patient age 18 40 year inclusive . Main Study The Main Study conduct patient new-onset moderate severe plaque psoriasis previously treat systemic treatment phototherapy . A total 160 patient randomized Arm A1 Arm B1 approximately 50 site worldwide . Since maximum screening failure rate 20 % expect , approximately 200 patient screen . Mechanistic Sub-study Any patient consent participate Mechanistic Sub-study . Patients new-onset plaque psoriasis randomize Arm A1b , Arm A2 , Arm B1b , chronic plaque psoriasis randomize Arm C1 Arm C2 ( 15 patient ) . For Arm A1b Arm B1b , first 15 patient include first come first serve basis . Safety assessment : Physical examination , Vital sign , Height body weight , Laboratory evaluation ( hematology , clinical chemistry , high-sensitivity C-reactive protein ) , Electrocardiogram , Pregnancy , Adverse event Data Analysis The primary efficacy variable proportion patient achieve PASI 90 Week 52 . The analysis primary objective base full analysis set . For primary analysis , follow hypothesis test perform : H01 : psec = pnbUVB versus HA1 : psec ≠ pnbUVB The primary analysis method PASI 90 response Week 52 use exact logistic regression model treatment explanatory variable baseline PASI score covariate . The key secondary variable proportion randomize patient achieve PASI 90 Week 104 . In order reduce selection bias , patient achieve PASI 90 Week 52 also include analysis Week 104 use PASI improvement obtain Week 104 . For key secondary analysis , follow hypothesis test perform : H02 : p*sec = p*nbUVB versus HA2 : p*sec ≠ p*nbUVB</detailed_description>
