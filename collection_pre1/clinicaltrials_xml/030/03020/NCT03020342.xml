	<brief_summary>Early stage HCC treat curative surgical resection local ablation ( radio-frequency ) current standard care . The complete removal clinical visible HCC confirm image MRI CT , decline tumor marker ( AFP PIVKA ) . However , despite apparent complete removal HCC , post-curative patient frequently develop tumor recurrence rate range 10-50 % within first year . The high rate early HCC recurrence indicate minimal residual HCC curative therapy significant proportion patient . A good specific biomarker detect residual HCC improve patient ' prognosis prediction therapeutic plan . To detect minimal residual HCC , biomarker unique tumor need . Currently , cell-free circulating DNA carry tumor-specific somatic mutation advocate promise one . It apply investigate tumor response resistances cancer therapy . However , currently restrict detect follow large advanced cancer , difficulty separate enrich cfDNA tumor-specific mutation cfDNA normal cell . In project , investigator propose one class somatic mutation HBV-related HCC , namely insertion mutagenesis integrate HBV DNA , could adopt circumvent difficulty . HBV DNA integration find chromosomes 90 % HBV-related HCC integration site unique individual HCC . The HBV-host junction DNA fragment one HCC therefore tumor-specific biomarker . Such fragment release circulation cell-free circulating DNAs , detection HBV-host chimera DNAs circulation reliable evidence presence tumor patient . Therefore cf circulate HBV-host chimera DNA propose assay minimal residual HCC curative therapy .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Development stage : Stage I : Identification integrate HBV DNA sit HBV-related HCC tissue . investigator develop either HBV-specific inverse PCRs capture-sequencing protocol identify HBV integration sit tumor chromosome . The viral-host junction sequence individual HCC identify used template develop assay detect HBV-host chimera DNA fragment circulation . Stage II : New platform accurately detect even quantitate circulate vh-chimera DNA fragment . These tumor-specific vh-chimera DNA represent tiny fraction total cfDNAs . However , sequence tumor-specific vh-chimera DNA know stage 1 , investigator may develop good specific assay quantitation . Stage III : Assays cell-free tumor specific vh-chimera DNA apply blood sample post-curative HCC patient . To demonstrate efficacy assay , blood sample obtain 4 week curative therapy 50 HBV-related HCC patient , test presence cf tumor-specific vh-chimera DNAs . The presence absence vh-chimera DNA correlate early HCC recurrence within first year determine clinical significance . There one blood sampling time HCC recurrence . Sample collection In stage I II , investigator set method chimera DNA identification quantification , need tumor sample support development evaluation feasibility assay . Therefore , investigator apply approval use tissue Taiwan Liver Cancer Network ( TLCN ) , include 20 pairs HBV-related male HCC , 20 pair HBV-related female HCC ( positive control ) , 20 pair HCV relate male HCC , 20 pair HCV relate female HCC ( negative control ) , 20 pair HBV- HCV-related male HCC , 20 pair HBV- HCV-related female HCC ( see vh-chimera DNA also applicable HBV- HCV-related HCC ) . Both genomic DNA RNA apply 120 patient total . Genomic DNA use assay development , include identification , detection quantification ; whereas RNA use validation insertional mutagenic RNA transcript , provide support evidence tumor specific integration transcription level . In stage III , investigator investigate whether correlation tumor-specific vh-chimera DNA level recurrence-free survival use assay investigator develop stage I II . Therefore , investigator collect Tumor ( T ) non-Tumor ( NT ) tissue pair 50 HBV-related HCC patient receive surgical removal tumor , also peripheral blood 4w surgery . T NT tissue vh-chimera DNA identification , peripheral blood use vh-chimera DNA detection quantification . On hand , clinical information include tumor size , tumor grade , serum marker routine liver function test ( ALT , AST ) , current HCC marker ( AFP ) , recurrence-free survival time collect correlation study .
