	<brief_title>To Evaluate Efficacy Safety SCB01A Subjects With r/m Squamous Cell Head Neck Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>From pre-clinical pharmacology phase I clinical study SCB01A demonstrate promising anticancer action vascular disrupting activity potential treatment various malignancy , particularly patient drug resistance . The drug study human subject dose escalation phase I study show safe 2 cycle 24 mg/m2 ( cycle consist one intravenous [ i.v . ] administration SCB01A via central line every 3 week ) . In phase I study , partial response ( PR ) ( shrinkage tumor size 50 % ) observe cycle 9 ( 3 mg/m2 ) one subject right buccal squamous cell carcinoma 19/33 ( 58 % ) subject stable disease ( SD ) 2 cycle . Pre clinical study SCB01A show concentration tubulin inhibition occur around 80 nM 24-hour exposure 200 nM 6-hour exposure . However , pharmacokinetic ( PK ) result phase I study showed average elimination half-life ( t1/2 ) 3-hours i.v . infusion SCB01A approximately 2.5 hour almost SCB01A detect 10 hour , indicate subject treat short API exposure time may insufficient achieve efficacy . Therefore , extend exposure duration effective concentration blood may increase treatment efficacy . The aim study evaluate efficacy safety i.v . infusion 24-hour SCB01A subject squamous cell carcinoma head neck fail previous platinum base therapy .</detailed_description>
