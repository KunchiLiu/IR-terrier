	<brief_title>Study Pharmacogenomic-Guided Tacrolimus Dosing Monitoring Kidney Transplant Recipients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Participants : All new kidney transplant recipient age 18 65 year admit UNC-CH provide informed consent include study ( Unless meet exclusion criterion specify ) . A total 260 subject include study , 130 include pharmacogenomic group remain 130 control group . Procedures ( method ) : The pharmacogenomic group partake 12-month study comprise two period , Genotype-Guided Initial Dosing Intervention Follow-up . Briefly , patient transplant waitlist screen eligibility . At pre-intervention assessment ( Study Day 0 ) , buccal swab sample genotyping collect eligible patient provide informed consent ( perform real time ) . Results genotyping test incorporate electronic medical record ( EMR ) . The initial tacrolimus dose base genotype : 0.15 mg/kg/day ( non- expressers ) 0.3 mg/kg/day ( expressers ) give 2 divided dos . Eligible patient consent receive genotype-guided tacrolimus dose enter pharmacogenomic group receive initial tacrolimus dose base genotype result follow kidney transplantation ( Study Day 1 ) . Subsequent tacrolimus dosing adjust accord trough concentration ( C0 ) therapeutic target concentration . The genotype-guided dosing recommendation tacrolimus refers initial tacrolimus dose . All patient pharmacogenomic group follow Study Day 2 12 month assess long-term outcome . Age- , race- , disease-matched patient previously receive kidney transplantation standard tacrolimus dose 2010 present also ask give consent genotyping ( historical control ) . These patient include control group safety efficacy data collect retrospectively 12 month initiation first tacrolimus dose . As confound variable , include age , race disease state may impact result study , study design incorporate overall matching strategy , identify well-matched control group . First , control difference care time , patient pharmacogenomic group match control enrolled 2010 present . This time period select major change standard care treatment regimen since 2010 . After eligibility meet , control patient select match pharmacogenomic group use computerized matching algorithm optimize match baseline demographic disease characteristic identify priori likely influence treatment response tacrolimus . To balance trade-off minimize bias maximize match sample size , systematic approach conduct identify number match control patient patient pharmacogenomic group . This approach include follow step : 1 ) run desire matching algorithm , start 1:1 ( one control one patient pharmacogenomic group ) match iterate maximum desired number potential control per treat subject reach ; 2 ) iteration , test covariate balance ; ( 3 ) generate numeric summary graphical plot balance statistic across iteration order determine optimal number . The selection patient control group use match algorithm conduct independent statistician blind unbiased manner . The statistician knowledge survival outcome , outcome data , genotype . The algorithm use guide treatment way .</detailed_description>
