	<brief_title>The Randomized Controlled Trial Inferior Vena Cava Ultrasound-guided Fluid Management Septic Shock Resuscitation</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Septic shock ( SS ) globally prevalent high mortality rate.The current focus initial treatment condition emphasize early recognition , prompt administration antibiotic , restoration hemodynamic aggressive fluid resuscitation vasopressor . Regarding initial fluid therapy , administration empirical crystalloid dose 30 ml/kg recommend guideline . The ultrasound-assisted management shock patient introduce past decade widely use . By use measurement inferior vena cava ( IVC ) diameter change respiratory phase , physician predict fluid responsiveness shock patient tailor fluid therapy resuscitation.Unfortunately , clinical outcome relate use concept SS resuscitation well study . Inadequate resuscitation fluid therapy relate high mortality ; however , fluid bolus positive fluid balance may result `` aggressive '' fluid administration also associate increased mortality SS patient . The primary aim study evaluate 30-day mortality outcome SS patient treat ultrasound-assisted fluid management use change IVC respiratory phase first 6 hour compare treated `` usual-care '' strategy . The secondary outcome compare rate need mechanical ventilation ( MV ) renal replacement therapy ( RRT ) well 6-hours lactate clearance change Sequential Organ Failure ( SOFA ) score 72 hour .</detailed_description>
