	<detailed_description>The investigator aim compare effect green-MED diet+ physical activity ( PA ) vs. MED diet+ PA vs. PA gut-fat-brain axis explore additional contribution autologous fecal microbiota derive rapid weight loss phase regain phase . Mediterranean ( MED ) diet , rich plants/seeds ( dietary polyphenols ) low process meat may pronounce beneficial effect age-related decline begin middle age , reflect change adiposity , cognitive function , cardiometabolic risk . The investigator hypothesize long-term intake diet significantly potentiate effect healthy lifestyle ( physical activity Mediterranean diet ) , constitute powerful strategy halt even reverse progression several age-related process related adiposity , cardiometabolic health cognition . The investigator hypothesize lifestyle intervention might modify gut microbiota profile autologous fecal microbiota supplement derive time maximal weight loss might halt expect subsequent regain phase . The investigator follow participant magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) include abdominal hepatic fat , cardiac anatomic/functional brain assessment . The investigator perform cognitive test measure change gut microbiota sub-metabolomic profiling . The trial perform isolated workplace ( Nuclear Research Center ) hold exclusive cafeteria provide free , dietary -monitored , lunch , internal medical department . The exclusive nutritional profile walnut , relative high polyphenols content unique composition , may benefit several health outcome . Epidemiologic study RCTs suggest walnut consumption associate well weight status , adiposity measure cardiometabolic state . However , individual avoid walnuts calorie-dense , fear promote weight gain . Walnuts contain numerous well-characterized beneficial nutritional component , unsaturated fat , especially omega-3 fatty acid , dietary fiber , high level vitamin mineral . Among well-recognized component , nut highly rich polyphenols , mainly flavonoid . Polyphenols may potentially interact physical activity promote neurogenesis ; process may significantly contribute brain 's ageing process . Similarly , polyphenol epigallocatechin-3-gallate ( EGCG , type catechin find green tea ) , propose exert neuroprotective effect . New specific develop strain duckweed [ Wolffia globose , `` Mankai '' ] , aquatic plant , might serve protein source contain 9 essential 6 conditional amino acid . `` Mankai '' [ ( Generally recognize safe ( GRAS ) ] cultivate strain Wolffia globosa , aquatic plant , part family plant know commonly duckweed . Duckweeds simple flower aquatic plant , float beneath surface still slow-moving body water . There long history use Wolffia specie , particular Wolffia Globosa , food , especially Southeast Asia : Burma , Laos northern Thailand , use vegetable many generation . The nutritional composition `` Mankai '' determine found high protein , contain essential conditionally essential amino acid , dietary fiber several vitamin mineral .</detailed_description>
