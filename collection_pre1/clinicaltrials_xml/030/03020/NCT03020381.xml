	<brief_summary>Motor slow cognitive slow prevalent age . Importantly , presence old person increase risk dementia ten time . Currently , clinically meaningful predictor progression dementia people mild cognitive impairment ( MCI ) . The main hypothesis subtle variation gait perform simple cognitive task reliable , easy perform , feasible methodology detect old adult high risk progression dementia also , high risk mobility decline fall . Rationale . The Canadian population age . According recent estimate , proportion population age 65 old increase rapidly 13 % 2005 25 % 2031 . This increase proportion accompany considerable amount disability subsequent dependency major effect quality life old adult caregiver , Canadian health care system . An important goal geriatric medicine reduce gap life expectancy disability-free life expectancy reduce disability dependency later year life . A substantial portion disability stem two major geriatric syndrome : cognitive impairment mobility limitation . The ultimate manifestation syndrome dementia fall . Interestingly , manifestation often coexist elderly people : fall common geriatric syndrome affect third old adult year , dementia affect third Canadians age 80 . Together , dementia fall responsible much discomfort , disability , health care utilization old adult become prevalent old Canadians expect number approximately $ 9 million 2031 . The combined direct cost dementia fall Canadian Health System $ 4.9 billion per year . Establishing reliable easy obtain predictor accurately identify MCI patient high risk progress dementia essential first , determine benefit additional and/or invasive test second , implement preventative strategy , include cognitive training , physical exercise , aggressive vascular risk factor correction delay progression . Even modest one-year delay dementia incidence could save Canada $ 109 billion 30 year .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Gait Predictor Dementia Falls . The Gait Brain Cohort Study</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This longitudinal cohort study assess 400 old person ( 65 y/o old ) cognitive impairment 10 year follow-up . The follow-up period select order cover potential progression dementia least two-third participant . For first three year , assessment conduct baseline every 6 month ; visit 36 month , participant follow year 7 year ( total follow-up 120 month ) . The six month period assessment first 3 year select since minimum time require detect significant change assessment cognitive measurement avoid test learning effect . If change note within first three year , annual follow-up period provide sufficient time period detect significant change cognition , gait balance measure . Blood test genotyping ( ApoE4 carrier ) perform baseline assessment . Cognitive , gait balance assessment perform visit . 3Tesla Magnetic Resonance Imaging ( structural functional-resting state- ) MRI spectroscopy perform three different time point : baseline , month 18 month 36 , follow Canadian Dementia Imaging protocol ( http : //www.cdip-pcid.ca . )</detailed_description>
