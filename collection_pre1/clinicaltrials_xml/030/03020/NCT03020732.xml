	<brief_summary>Platelet concentrate ( PC ) use field periodontology implantology content necessary key cell growth factor accelerate heal provide regeneration . Concentrated Growth Factors ( CGF ) define innovative method new generation PC . The purpose clinical study evaluate clinical effectiveness Concentrated Growth Factor ( CGF ) membrane coronally advanced flap ( CAF ) procedure 's subepithelial connective tissue graft ( SCTG ) CAF treatment multiple Miller class I gingival recession ( GR ) .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Gingival Recession Treatment With Concentrated Growth Factor ( CGF )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>CGF define innovative method produce platelet rich fibrin ( PRF ) new generation platelet concentrate ( PC ) .The rotational speed centrifuge machine use CGF , vary 2400-3000 rpm . The variability rotation speed centrifugation allow fibrin matrix large , intensive include growth factor PRF . Some study report CGF induce effect periodontal ligament stem cell osteogenic differentiation clinically provide new bone formation sinus augmentation . In literature , one clinical research associate multiple gingival recession defect treatment . It show CGF CAF surgery increase keratinize gingiva weight thickness maybe prevent post-operative relapse CAF . PC also mention effective increase width keratinize tissue provide root coverage may reduce early post-surgical complication , accelerate wound heal systematic review . In treatment isolated multiple gingival recession , PRF SCTG CAF procedure report similar root coverage . PRF use alternative method SCTG .CGF PRF similar composition . However high resistance viscosity CGF may protect growth factor proteolysis good PRF . There comparative study CGF SCTG literature term clinically patient related parameter . Therefore , purpose clinical study evaluate clinical efficacy CGF combination CAF treatment multiple gingival recession 's defect , compare SCTG combination CAF . It also aim ass compare postoperative pain soft tissue healing .</detailed_description>
