	<brief_summary>Weakness major cause disability stroke survivor . Rehabilitation technique often effective restore full function upper limb . Specifically , many individual remain weakness hand , prevent return full use . Robotic therapy develop exercise tool stroke survivor . Devices , InMotion2 , show useful restore motor function upper limb . However , exist device design used upper limb primarily develop treat shoulder , elbow wrist . They specifically address hand function . Tyromotion , Inc. develop Amadeo , primarily intend provide rehabilitation patient neurological orthopedic deficit hand function . Initial clinical testing demonstrate practicality use device population stroke survivor , although research need well understand usefulness Amadeo device compare conventional rehabilitation method . The purpose study compare result train Amadeo device train conventional therapy . A total 28 subject two separate site participate study underwent baseline test upper limb motor sensory performance function . Subjects assign one two treatment group 50:50 chance either group . One group underwent training Amadeo device group underwent train conventional therapy . All training session 60 minute duration , three days/week eight week ( 24 total session ) . Subjects reassess completion training program .</brief_summary>
