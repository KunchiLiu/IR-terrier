	<brief_summary>Acute lymphoblastic leukemia ( ALL ) common cancer diagnose child . The cancer come cell blood call lymphocyte . Normal lymphocyte produce bone marrow ( along blood cell ) help fight infection . In ALL , cancerous lymphocyte call lymphoblast . They help fight infection crowd normal blood cell bone marrow body make enough normal blood cell . ALL always fatal treat . With current treatment , child adolescent disease cure . The standard treatment ALL involve 2 year chemotherapy . The drug use , dose drug , similar identical child adolescents ALL . Some child adolescent receive strong treatment , especially first several month . A number factor use decide strong treatment give best chance cure . These factor call `` risk factor '' . This trial study use new , updated set risk factor decide strong treatment . The study also test new way dose chemotherapy drug call pegaspargase ( part standard treatment ALL ) base checking level drug blood adjust dose base level .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Treatment Newly Diagnosed Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia Children Adolescents</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>There standard set risk factor use decide strong treatment child ALL . These risk factor include child 's age leukemia diagnose , high white blood cell count ( WBC ) blood , whether leukemia cell see spinal fluid ( referred Central Nervous System CNS status ) , whether leukemia certain abnormality chromosome ( genetic material cell ) . Another risk factor amount leukemia marrow measure special laboratory test call `` MRD '' ( Minimal Residual Disease ) first month treatment . Over last several year , new factor identify help predict well child 's leukemia may respond treatment . These new risk factor include additional abnormality gene leukemia cell , well amount leukemia ( MRD level ) second time point ( 2-3 month start treatment ) . In trial , investigator use new risk factor along old risk factor decide strong treatment . The goal well identify participant might benefit strong treatment order improve chance cure . The investigator also hope good identify participant high chance cure standard treatment order reduce chance side effect maintain chance cure . This trial also aim study dose drug call pegaspargase . Pegaspargase chemotherapy drug important part ALL treatment also cause many side effect . With standard dose pegaspargase , level drug blood high may necessary effectively treat leukemia . On research study , investigator compare standard dose pegaspargase new way dose drug base level drug measure blood . With new way , treatment begin low dose . If level high , dose decrease one time ; however , time level low , dose switch back standard dose . The goal research study learn whether new way dosing ( start low dose change dose base drug level blood ) decrease side effect still effective standard dose drug .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>1 . Confirmed diagnosis acute lymphoblastic leukemia . Diagnosis make bone marrow aspirate biopsy demonstrate ≥ 25 % involvement lymphoblast , flow cytometry immunohistochemistry confirm Bprecursor TALL phenotype . For patient circulate blast peripheral blood , flow cytometry confirmation BALL TALL phenotype sufficient registration onto study . Bone marrow aspirate and/or biopsy perform soon feasible , preferably prior initiation therapy . 2 . Prior Therapy : No prior therapy allow except follow : Corticosteroids : Short course corticosteroid ( define ≤ 7 day corticosteroid within 4weeks precede registration ) allow prior registration . Participants corticosteroid chronically ( defined 7 day corticosteroid within 4weeks precede registration 28 day corticosteroid precede 6 month ) eligible . IT cytarabine : A single dose intrathecal cytarabine ( time diagnostic lumbar puncture ) allow prior registration . If patient receive IT cytarabine prior registration , Day 1 IT cytarabine administer . Emergent Radiation Therapy : Emergent radiation mediastinum lifethreatening mass allow prior registration . 3 . Age : 365 day &lt; 22 year 4 . Direct bilirubin &lt; 1.4 mg/dL ( 23.9 micromoles/L ) . 5 . Ability parent guardian understand willingness sign write informed consent document . 1 .
