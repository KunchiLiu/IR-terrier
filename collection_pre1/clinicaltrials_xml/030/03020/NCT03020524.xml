	<brief_summary>A single cohort , open-label pilot study safety tolerability single infusion autologous CD4+ T-cells genetically modify HR2 , C34-peptide conjugate CXCR4 N-terminus use lentiviral vector HIV-infected subject . This first human study C34-CXCR4 T cell</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Autologous CD4 T-Cells HIV ( C34-CXCR4 )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>There single cohort study , consist subject well-controlled HIV replication HAART . Within cohort 3 escalate dos T-cell infusion . A modified 3+3+3 dose-escalation design follow , standard dose-escalation algorithm stop maximum 9 evaluable subject DLT stop point reach , whichever come first . At dose level , three patient treat . For dose level 1 2 , 0/3 subject dose limit toxicity ( DLT ) , dose escalate . If 1/3 DLT ( grade 3 high unexpected , related adverse event [ AE ] ) dose level 3 additional patient treat dosage escalating , &lt; 2/6 DLT ( i.e . additional DLT observe ) dose escalate next plan dose level patient treat maximum 9 evaluable subject reach . The study comprise 5 step : Step 1 , participant undergo leukapheresis obtain CD4 positive T-cells genetically modify . A second leukapheresis rectal biopsy provide baseline specimen evaluate size HIV reservoir Step 2 , participant receive single infusion C34-CXCR4-modified CD4+ T-cells one 3 dose level . The first 3 subject receive dose level 1 0.8-1x109 transduce CD4+T-cells . Provided dose limiting toxicity ( DLT ) see first dose level , next 3 subject receive infusion 2nd dose level 2.4-3x109 transduced CD4+ T-cells . If DLT occur dose , final 3 subject receive 3rd dose level 0.8-1x1010 transduce CD4+ T-cells . In event DLT ( grade 3 high unexpected , related AE ) recruitment pause pending DSMB decision . Step 3 participant participate 16-week analytical treatment interruption begin 4 week T-cell infusion . At end step 3 participant undergo mini-leukapheresis rectal biopsy Step 4 participant advise resume antiretroviral therapy follow plasma HIV RNA fall limit detection . In Step 5 participant undergo leukapheresis rectal biopsy 52 week post infusion . At completion study , participant ask participate long-term follow-up study require regulatory authority .</detailed_description>
	<criteria>HIV1 infection , document licensed rapid HIV test HIV enzyme chemiluminescence immunoassay ( E/CIA ) test kit time prior enrollment confirm licensed Western blot second antibody test method initial rapid HIV and/or E/CIA , HIV1 antigen , plasma HIV1 RNA VL . Ability willingness subject provide inform consent . Men woman age ≥18 year . Clinically stable first second HAART regimen . Changes patient HIV viral load undetectable count toward number ART regimens use , change make virologic failure ( example individual switching NNRTIbased regimen integrase inhibitor base regimen HIV viral load undetectable still first regimen ) . Site investigator anticipate fully active alternative ART regimen could construct event virologic failure current ART regimen.The current regimen change within 4 week enrollment . Subjects must willing continue current antiretroviral therapy duration study except duration 16 week analytical treatment interruption . ( NOTE : change safely begin treatment interruption see section 5.6 permit ) . Screening HIV1 RNA ≤50 copies/mL use FDAapproved assay perform laboratory CLIA certification equivalent within 30 day prior enrollment . HIV1 RNA ≤50 copies/mL use FDAapproved assay least 24 week prior enrollment perform laboratory CLIA certification equivalent . NOTE : HIVRNA must measure least last 24 week least 3 day screen measure . Single determination &gt; 50 &lt; 400 copies/mL ( ie , blip ) allow long preceding subsequent determination ≤50 copies/mL . The screen value may serve subsequent determination ≤50 copies/mL follow blip NOTE : subject participate trial use ATI 's permit since detectable virus interruption represent virologic failure . These subject least 24 week VL &lt; 50 copies/mL . Screening CD4+ Tcell count ≥450 cells/ mm3 within 30 day enrollment . Started ART nadir CD4+ ≥200 cells/ mm3 . The following laboratory value obtain within 30 day prior enrollment meeting follow criterion : Absolute neutrophil count ( ANC ) ≥1000 cells/mm3 Hemoglobin : ≥10.0 ( male ) ; ≥9.5 ( female ) g/dL Platelet count : 100,000/mm3 Calculated creatinine clearance ≥50 mL/min estimate CockcroftGault equation Alanine aminotransferase ( ALT ) ≤ 2.0 x ULN Negative HBsAg within 6 month prior enrollment . Negative HCV serology , positive , negative HCV RNA within 6 month prior enrollment Adequate venous access contraindication leukapheresis . Have Karnofsky Performance Score 70 high . Acute chronic hepatitis B hepatitis C infection Current prior AIDS diagnosis . History cancer malignancy , exception successfully treat basal cell squamous cell carcinoma skin History feature physical examination indicative active unstable cardiac disease hemodynamic instability . NOTE : Subjects history cardiac disease may participate physician 's approval . History feature physical examination indicative bleeding diathesis Have previously treat HIV experimental vaccine within 6 month prior enrollment , previous gene therapy use integrate vector . NOTE : Subjects treat placebo HIV vaccine study exclude documentation receive placebo provide . Use chronic systemic corticosteroid , hydroxyurea , immunomodulating agent ( e.g. , interleukin2 , interferonalpha gamma , granulocyte colony stimulate factor , etc . ) within 30 day prior enrollment . NOTE : Recent current use inhale steroid exclusionary . If subject prescribe brief course oral corticosteroid , use limit less 7 day . Use steroids apheresis immune assessment blood draw discourage affect white blood cell function . Anticipated use aspirin , dipyridamole , warfarin medication likely affect platelet function aspect blood coagulation 2week period prior leukapheresis Active drug alcohol use dependence , opinion site investigator , would interfere adherence study requirement . Serious illness require systemic treatment and/or hospitalization within 30 day prior enrollment Asymptomatic baseline serum chemistry elevation LFTs , bilirubin , lipase serum creatinine due HAART medication exclusionary , opinion investigator , abnormality attributable intrinsic hepatorenal disease . Such baseline elevation must due HAART . Receipt vaccination within 30 day prior enrollment . NOTE : It recommend subject enrol study complete routine vaccination ( hepatitis A , hepatitis B , pneumococcus , tetanus diphtheria booster ) least 30 day prior enrollment Have allergy hypersensitivity study product excipients ( human serum albumin , DMSO Dextran 40 ) .</criteria>
