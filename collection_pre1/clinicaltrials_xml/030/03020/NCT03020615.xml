	<brief_summary>This pilot study , single-blind , randomize , multicenter , therapeutic clinical trial design evaluate feasibility enrol infant toddler ( 9 month 36 month ) sickle cell anemia ( SCA ; HbSS HbSβ0thalassemia ) , regardless disease severity , therapeutic trial . A prior clinical trial St. Jude Children 's Research Hospital ( SJCRH ) ( BABYHUG , NCT01783990 ) demonstrate fix dose ( 20 mg/kg/day ) hydroxyurea safe effective decrease SCA-related complication young child ( 9-18 month ) , largely due finding , hydroxyurea recommend offer child ( ≥9 month old ) SCA , independent disease severity . Nevertheless , child treatment arm BABYHUG continue experience vaso-occlusive symptom incur organ damage . In clinical trial older child SCA , intensification hydroxyurea maximum tolerate dosage ( MTD ) , define mild moderate myelosuppression , may associate improved laboratory parameter compare fix lower-dosing , clinical benefit gain dose intensification describe . Therefore , trial , child standard treatment arm receive fix dose hydroxyurea ( 20mg/kg/day ) , participant experimental arm receive hydroxyurea intensify MTD , define goal absolute neutrophil count ( ANC ) 1500-3000 cells/µL . This trial aim establish multicenter infrastructure identify , enroll randomize young child ( 9-36 month ) receive fix dose versus intensified-dose hydroxyurea single blind manner , obtain prospective pilot data compare clinical laboratory outcome treatment arm facilitate design definitive phase III trial .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>All participant initially receive hydroxyurea dose ~20 mg/kg/day open label fashion eight week ( ±2 week ) prior randomization . Participants receive monthly medical evaluation ( every 4 ± 2 week ) height weight measurement , medical history , physical examination , medication adherence assessment . During monthly visit complete blood count absolute reticulocyte count monitor . Hemoglobin electrophoresis , complete serum chemistry , urinalysis , lactate dehydrogenase quality life measurement obtain every 20 ( ±2 ) week . Transcranial Doppler ( TCD ) ultrasound velocity obtain study entry ( participant ≥2 year age ) study exit . Participants randomize receive hydroxyurea MTD dose increase 5 mg/kg/day every 8 week , absence toxicity , goal ANC 1500-3000 cells/µL achieve , maximum 35 mg/kg/day . Both group receive assign treatment 48 week ( ± 3 week ) . Participants study total 56 week ( ± 3 week ) 14 clinic visit St. Jude outpatient Hematology Clinic time . After 56 week , participant follow additional 30 day side effect take study .</detailed_description>
