	<detailed_description>AIMS : The ultimate goal personalize brain stimulation stroke outcome upper limb maximize individual patient . Even though stimulation one well study method augment plasticity boost recovery , still approve outpatient therapy . Benefits stimulation weak variable especially patient suffer great damage disability . The key limitation standard approach generic assumption plasticity . The current standard assume ipsilesional primary motor cortex ( iM1 ) impact recovery patient range severity , intact , contralesional cortex always compete iM1 inhibit recovery . But , long-standing assumption fail consider iM1 pathway damage majority ( 58-83 % ) patient . As , potential iM1 would weak variable , patient little option rely plasticity intact , contralesional cortex likely survive . Of survive cortex , contralesional dorsal premotor cortex ( cPMd ) express plasticity consistently . cPMd activate movement paretic limb activate iM1 less likely . cPMd even reduces competition iM1 offer ipsilateral pathway instead support recovery proximal paretic limb pathway iM1 largely damage . Several group include investigator recently theorize personalizing stimulation selectively stimulate iM1 mild , cPMd patient great severity would help generalize benefit stimulation . These theoretical claim , however , remain untested since several gap exist . For instance , cut-off level severity stratifies respond stimulation iM1 respond stimulation cPMd ? Even , substrates 'personalized ' stimulation substrates express plasticity recovery , i.e . patient benefit stimulation cPMd , express contralesional plasticity recovery ? Here , investigator premise variance expression plasticity explain best stratify patient robust , personalized stimulation .</detailed_description>
