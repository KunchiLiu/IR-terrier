	<brief_summary>The purpose research study evaluate safety NU-0129 SNA gold nanoparticle infusion patient recurrent glioblastoma multiforme gliosarcoma . This first-in-human trial determine safety NU-0129 . The study drug compose small gold nanoparticle spherical nucleic acid attach . This small particle allow NU-0129 cross blood brain barrier ( filter mechanism carry blood brain ) . Once within tumor , nucleic acid component able target gene call Bcl2L12 present glioblastoma multiforme , associate tumor growth . This gene prevent tumor cell apoptosis , process program cell death , thus promote tumor growth . Researchers think target Bcl2L12 gene NU-0129 help stop cancer cell grow .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To assess safety intravenous NU-0129 patient recurrent glioblastoma multiforme ( GBM ) gliosarcoma ( GS ) . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . To analyze drug concentration serum specific time point drug administration . II . To demonstrate intratumoral penetration NU-0129 . III . To assess feasibility give NU-0129 standard treatment recurrent GBM GS . TERTIARY OBJECTIVES : I . To analyze tumor tissue Bcl2L12 expression level NU-0129 administration . II . Preliminary response ( progression free survival [ PFS ] overall survival [ OS ] 6 month ; overall response rate [ ORR ] ) . OUTLINE : Patients receive NU-0129 intravenously ( IV ) 20-50 minute undergo standard care tumor resection within 8-48 hour . After completion study treatment , patient follow 7 , 14 , 21 , 28 day every 84 day 2 year .</detailed_description>
