	<brief_summary>Individuals receive dialysis risk heart failure heart relate death . There urgent need treatment reduce risk problem patient require dialysis . Spironolactone pill use prevent heart failure related death patient require dialysis . It work block hormone ( aldosterone ) body cause high blood pressure damage heart . Although spironolactone effective patient require dialysis , know spironolactone effective dialysis patient . Our research help determine spironolactone reduces heart failure heart relate deaths dialysis patient . The purpose study determine spironolactone reduces death hospitalization heart failure well tolerated patient require dialysis .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Globally , 2 million people receive dialysis end-stage renal disease ( ESRD ) 650,000 new patient start dialysis year . Furthermore , number patient receive dialysis increase access dialysis develop world improve prevalence diabetes vascular disease rise . Despite technical advance dialysis , outcomes patient ESRD poor . Patients frequent hospitalization , poor health relate quality life strikingly , high mortality rate . The common cause death patient receive dialysis cardiovascular disease , account &gt; 40 % death . Observational study suggest causal pathway cardiovascular death include progressive ventricular hypertrophy dilatation well accelerated atherosclerosis . These change result myocardial ischemia cardiac fibrosis , turn , lead heart failure , arrhythmias cardiac arrest . Strongly implicated pathophysiology aldosterone . Mineralocorticoid receptor antagonist ( MRAs ) non-ESRD patient , prevent cardiovascular death small randomize controlled trial MRAs ESRD suggest may reduce death may safe . Spironolactone commonly use MRA worldwide . We conduct multicentre randomize control trial ( RCT ) determine spironolactone reduces cardiac mortality hospitalization heart failure patient treated dialysis . This trial call Aldosterone bloCkade Health Improvement EValuation End-stage renal disease ( ACHIEVE ) .</detailed_description>
