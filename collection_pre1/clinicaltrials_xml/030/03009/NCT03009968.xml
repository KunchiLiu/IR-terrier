	<brief_summary>After reconstructive pelvic surgery urinary retention occur 60 % patient require indwell catheter self-catheterization ( 1-5 ) . Up 35 % woman acute retention experience urinary tract infection postoperative period ( 6 , 7 ) . Many woman consider discharge Foley catheter surgical complication describe catheter use bad aspect surgery ( 8 ) . At time consensus within field Female Pelvic Medicine Reconstructive Surgery ( FPMRS ) best ass void function postoperatively . FPMRS provider within United States around world utilize variety void trial method vary criterion determine adequacy post-operative voiding efficiency ( 5 ) . The traditional backfill assist void trial method involve assessment postvoid residual ( PVR ) volume obtain either via catheterization bladder scan ( 3 ) . Recently , effort determine way avoid assessment PVR time-consuming potentially expose patient additional catheterization ( 9 , 10 ) . Many FPMRS provider utilize backfill assist method without assess PVR instead utilize certain voided volume threshold determine adequate voiding . However , date , one directly study approach compare traditional backfill assist void trial PVR-free backfill assist void trial . By decrease catheterization create efficient void trial method , investigator hope improve patient ' postoperative experience reduce catheterization risk urinary tract infection ( UTI ) . This study aim compare two void trial methodology order help standardize post-operative care urogynecology population . This study also potential lead overall change field improve postoperative course woman across country abroad .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Data Collection Demographic characteristic ( i.e . age , race , body mass index , medical history ) collect time preoperative visit . On day surgery , operative data record standard form document procedure perform , intra-operative complication ( ) , EBL operative time . Prior discharge randomize void trial preform . Data regard void trial document standard form include void trial perform , amount backfilled , amount void , post void residual assess , patient discharge void spontaneously , Foley catheter perform CISC . All subject instruct call clinical office report urinary complaint treatment UTI . Information collect electronic medical record regard office visit , urine culture perform treatment UTI 6-week period . Participants call 1 week time surgery complete Short-term Catheter Burden Questionnaire . Pre-operative Visit The preoperative visit may occur 3 month prior surgery . Patients elect participate study consent private exam protect confidentiality . Once consented subject assign subject identification number study identification purpose , consist `` A '' patient 's surgery perform Rex Hospital `` B '' patient 's surgery perform Hillsborough . A number follow letter . Void Trial Protocols 1 . Traditional backfill assist void trial ( control ) : Backfill bladder 300 ml tolerate normal saline sterile water indwell Foley catheter . The catheter remove patient give 15 minute void void volume measure . A post void residual ( PVR ) measure voiding ( attempt void ) use either catheter bladder scanner . The participant consider pass void trial PVR le 100 mL less half void volume void volume great 200 mL . 2 . The post-void residual free void trial ( intervention ) : Backfill bladder 300 ml tolerate normal saline sterile water indwell Foley catheter . The catheter remove patient give 15 minute void void volume measure . The participant consider pass void trial void 1/2 instilled volume . A PVR perform . If participant fails void trial either method discharge home indwelling catheter clean intermittent self-catheterization ( CISC ) per participant preference . Subjects indwell catheter return clinic within 1-3 day repeat void trial use void trial guideline . If subject discharge clean intermittent self-catheterization ( CISC ) document void volume PVRs home . Our nurse call participant every 1-2 business day determine stop CISC ( 2 consecutive PVRs le 100 mL ) . Nurses document information standardize template EPIC per routine clinic protocol . Follow-Up Participants schedule post-operative appointment time schedule surgery per usual protocol . They call 1 week surgery complete questionnaire . The postoperative visit usually take place approximately 6 week surgery . Any additional visit call Urogynecology clinic prior post-operative appointment document electronic medical record per routine clinical practice . All effort make ensure minimal loss follow-up participant . This plan may include effort telephone follow-up electronic medical record communication patient . Week 1 Phone Call The patient call one week surgery answer question Short-Term Catheter Burden Questionnaire . Week 6 Visit ( -2 weeks/+2 week ) The primary outcome assess time post-operative visit confirmation need catheterization . At visit subject also patient complete questionnaire regard catheter use .</detailed_description>
