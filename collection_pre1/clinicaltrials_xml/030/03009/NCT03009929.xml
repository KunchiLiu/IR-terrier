	<brief_title>Validation Study CLASSIC</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Background Quantifiable evidence-based method define reporting complication need improve patient safety surgery . Whereas several validate system report postoperative complication , prospectively validated system report intraoperative complication . The investigator develop publish definition classification intraoperative complication within Delphi study involve international interdisciplinary expert . The aim research project assess validity practicability newly derive classification system . Methods In 6 centre Switzerland 13 centre abroad , 2500 consecutive patient undergo type inpatient surgery include prospective international multicentre cohort study . The primary endpoint correspond risk-adjusted association severe intraoperative complication classify accord CLASSIC severe postoperative complication classify accord commonly use classification postoperative complication develop Clavien Dindo . All observe patient-related intraoperative complication skin incision closure consider intraoperative complication . Expected result The investigator expect high correlation severe intra- postoperative complication , even adjustment relevant confounders duration complexity surgical procedure . Relevance Confirming high correlation intra- postoperative complication , attentive care could provide patient suffer severe intraoperative complication . Additionally , provide easy applicable internationally validate classification system contribution improve quality perioperative health care patient safety .</detailed_description>
