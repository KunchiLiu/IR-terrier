	<brief_summary>The purpose study evaluate three different injectable solution use block ankle nerve manage ankle pain . The current standard medical care inject combination local anesthetic steroid around injured nerve . There evidence injection local anesthetic ( without steroid ) calm injure nerve provide pain relief day month . Injection sterile salt water also potential provide pain relief break scar tissue around nerve thereby relieve compression . Injections local anesthetic steroid around injured nerve use many year provide relief pain specific reason well know benefit . There three possibility : 1 ) Steroids reduce inflammation calm nerve , 2 ) local anesthetic similar action short duration ( day ) , 3 ) injection solution break scar around injured/compressed nerve . The study compare pain relief possible adverse effect three different solution . This study help provide definitive answer regard pain relief possible adverse effect three solution . This , turn , determine best possible option injection patient nerve-related injury pain .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Randomized Controlled Trial Efficacy Safety Local Anesthetics Steroids Chronic Peripheral Post-traumatic Neuropathic Pain</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This project randomize control trial aim compare efficacy image ( ultrasound ) -guided administration perineural combination steroid local anesthetic ( current standard care ) perineural local anesthetic ( LA ) saline provide sustain analgesic benefit people chronic neuropathic pain ( NP ) foot ankle . The study design multi-center , prospective , conceal , blind , parallel group trial three group , block randomization ( block six participant ) allocation 2:2:2 ratio . Study participants outcome evaluator blind treatment assignment . Participants randomly assign one three group receive two US-guided injection ( interval one two week ) one follow around one five nerve innervate foot ankle : The initial procedure repeat one two week unless clinical circumstance dictate otherwise ( , patient decline second injection increase pain satisfaction pain relief ) . The rationale repeat procedure allow possible benefit cumulative effect procedure and/or injectates . Between first injection first follow-up visit , patient allow additional therapeutic intervention . Nerves target injection decide treat physician base area foot ankle display feature neuropathic pain . Each injection study medication precede subcutaneous injection 1 mLs LA ( 2 % lidocaine ) injection site . This reduce discomfort study participant injection . The subcutaneous LA also cause numbness skin ensure blind participant group allocation . Two ultrasound-guided procedure perform weekly interval two week . The US-guided technique perform procedure describe previous study center.22 Conservative measure ( oral analgesic , physiotherapy ) continue study . Fasting blood glucose measure baseline one month follow intervention . Systolic diastolic blood pressure ( participant sit least 5 minute prior measurement ) value recode mean three consecutive reading baseline one month follow intervention . Cross-sectional area ( CSA ) tibial nerve 3 cm proximal cephalad edge medial malleolus also measure prior first procedure prior second procedure participant pain distribution tibial nerve . Change CSA ( ) correlate analgesic response perineural injection decrease CSA may indicate reduction edema nerve .</detailed_description>
