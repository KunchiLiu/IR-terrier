	<brief_title>Preoxygenation With Optiflow™ Morbidly Obese Patients Superior Face Mask</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The use high flow nasal cannula ( HFNC ) originate neonatal care , become widespread application patient high risk hypoxemia , critical care emergency setting . Therefore , high flow nasal oxygenation continue study airway management preoxygenation , well maintenance oxygenation airway procedure . Optiflow™ , humidify high flow nasal cannula , already show useful prevent desaturation intubation ICU patient versus non-rebreathing mask , addition , prolong safe apnea time patient potential difficult airway . Additionally , preoxygenation HFNC prior intubation patient hypoxemic respiratory failure also show decrease desaturation apnea compare preoxygenation traditional bag valve mask . The morbidly obese patient present separate group challenge anesthesiologist regard mask ventilation intubation . Obesity ( along factor ) show contribute difficulty mask ventilation . Obese patient alter respiratory physiology , include decrease functional residual capacity , increase oxygen consumption lower tidal volume , compare non-obese patient . These factor contribute obese patient potentially short apnea time desaturating induction general anesthesia , compare non-obese patient . Weight inversely correlate safe apnea time . Optiflow™ may provide opportunity prolong apnea time morbidly obese patient population . If demonstrate efficacious method preoxygenation prolongation apneic time , could provide safe environment intubation particular patient population .</detailed_description>
