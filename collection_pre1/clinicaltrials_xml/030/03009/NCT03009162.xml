	<brief_summary>This multi-center , open-label , non-randomized , parallel-group , adaptive , single dose study . This study enroll 32 subject use adaptive design include 3 group 8 subject different degree renal impairment one group 8 control subject normal renal function . Screening data review determine subject eligibility . Subjects meet inclusion criterion none exclusion criterion enter study . First , approximately 16 subject enrol severe renal impairment match subject normal renal function . There 8 subject follow group base renal function screening : - Group 1 : Healthy subject normal renal function ( eGFR ≥ 90 mL/min/1.73m2 ) - Group 2 : Severe renal impairment subject ( eGFR &lt; 30 mL/min/1.73m2 ) Based safety pharmacokinetic ( PK ) result subject severe renal impairment ( Group 2 ) , Group 3 ( Moderate Renal Impairment ) Group 4 ( Mild Renal Impairment ) enrol substantial change exposure lasmiditan observed subject severe renal impairment .</brief_summary>
