	<brief_title>Pevonedistat Decitabine Treating Patients With High Risk Acute Myeloid Leukemia</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . Determine addition pevonedistat standard dose decitabine safe tolerable evaluation toxicity include : type , frequency , severity , attribution , time course , reversibility duration . II . Determine maximum tolerate dose ( MTD ) /recommended phase II dose ( RP2D ) pevonedistat give combination standard dose decitabine . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . Obtain preliminary estimate complete remission ( CR ) rate , overall response rate ( ORR : CR+CRi [ incomplete CR ] ) , duration response , survival probability : overall survival ( OS ) event-free survival ( EFS ) 1-year 2-years . II . Demonstrate down-modulation micro ribonucleic acid ( miR ) -155 increase expression miR-155 target ( SHIP1 PU.1 ) vivo . III . Examine impact combination leukemia stem cell ( LSCs ) ; enrich blast cell subpopulation . IV . Evaluate possible association change level miR-155 , miR-155 gene target ( PU.1 , SHIP1 ) toxicity and/or clinical response . OUTLINE : This dose-escalation study pevonedistat . Patients receive pevonedistat intravenously ( IV ) 1 hour day 1 , 3 , 5 decitabine IV 1 hour day 1-5 8-12 . Treatment repeat every 28 day 24 course absence disease progression unexpected toxicity . After completion study treatment , patient follow 30 day , monthly 1 year , bi-monthly another year .</detailed_description>
