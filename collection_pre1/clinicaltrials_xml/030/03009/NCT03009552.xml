	<brief_summary>The overall objective study determine whether speckle track echocardiography present additional prognostic value routine assessment ( clinical echocardiographic ) patient admit acute decompensated heart failure ( ADHF ) emergency department . Specific objective : 1 - To evaluate association change cardiac contractile mechanic ( serial measurement strain , strain rate , displacement velocity , rotation ventricular torsion ) clinical outcome ADHF . 2 - Evaluate possible association parameter biomarkers neurohormonal activity , myocardial injury , fibrosis myocardial remodeling , inflammatory activity , cardiorenal syndrome .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Speckle Tracking Echocardiography Adds Information Decompensated Heart Failure</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>ADHF syndrome comprise around one million emergency admission per year United States , number case triple last three decade , currently represent main cause hospital admission patient age 65 year . A recent study show among patient similar risk presentation ADHF , admit treated emergency ( attempt get early discharge ) high mortality rate treat hospitalization . On hand , uncertainty clinical course also result prolonged unnecessary hospitalization , burden health system consumes resource . Thus , It vital carry study bring well understand pathophysiology ADHF determine new risk stratification tool emergency department . Echocardiography widely use image method key role diagnosis management patient HF . However , methodological limitation conventional echocardiography cause low reproducibility intra inter-observer agreement parameter , reduce prognostic ability . In recent year , new technology incorporate method attempt overcome limitation . One new technology echocardiography `` speckle tracking '' . The method , nature , significant advantage parameter derive conventional echocardiography , ultrasound beam angle-independence . However , paucity data new technology patient ADHF literature find study evaluate prognostic value method prospective cohort patient condition . This study aim develop knowledge assessment tool cardiac mechanic emergency care , explore potential prognostic value patient ADHF , aim assist cardiologist identify eligible patient early safe discharge , identify patient hospitalization longer treatment recommend .</detailed_description>
