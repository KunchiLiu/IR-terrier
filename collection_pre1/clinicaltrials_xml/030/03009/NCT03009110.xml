	<brief_summary>The Prophylactic Negative Pressure Wound Therapy Obese Women Cesarean Trial large pragmatic multi-center randomize clinical trial design evaluate effectiveness , safety cost-effectiveness prophylactic negative pressure wound therapy ( NPWT ) - close , sealed system applies negative pressure wind surface via single-use , battery-powered , portable device - decrease surgical site infection ( SSIs ) obese woman .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Preventing Adverse Incisional Outcomes Cesarean Multicenter Trial</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Experimental evidence suggest NPWT promote wound heal remove exudate , approximate wound edge , reduce bacterial contamination . Obesity ( body mass index [ BMI ] ≥30kg/m2 ) increase risk cesarean delivery SSIs compare non-obese woman . The increase risk SSIs part due increase thickness subcutaneous space , allow collection exudate increase tension wound edge , promote growth bacteria , lead wound infection breakdown . Thus , prophylactic NPWT may particularly effective patient population . During 5-year project period , investigator 4 collaborate perinatal center United Stated ( two university two community ) randomize 2850 obese woman undergo cesarean delivery receive either prophylactic negative pressure wound therapy Prevena device standard wound dress . Women follow 30 day postoperatively ascertain study outcome . The primary outcome trial superficial deep SSI cesarean accord CDC 's National Healthcare Safety Network definition . The investigator also assess wound complication , adverse event potentially attributable NPWT cost-effectiveness measure incremental cost per case SSI prevent per quality-adjusted life year ( QALY ) .</detailed_description>
