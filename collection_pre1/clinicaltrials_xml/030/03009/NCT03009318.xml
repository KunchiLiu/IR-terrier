	<brief_summary>MRS 11C-MET PET/CT commonly use supplementary image technique differential diagnosis non-enhancing supratentorial glioma . However , technique limitation lead misdiagnosis ; therefore , investigator attempt combine two metabolic imaging tool evaluate whether combination MRS 11C-MET PET/CT increase sensitivity radiological diagnosis non-enhancing supratentorial glioma .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Combination MRS 11C-methionine PET/CT Diagnosis Glioma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Cerebral glioma account 29 % primary brain tumor 81 % malignant brain tumor . Structural image MRI commonly accept method obtain radiological information lead diagnosis . However , low-grade glioma ( LGGs ) , even high-grade glioma ( HGGs ) , enhance MRI-contrast imaging . Despite apply supplementary MRI sequence T2 FLAIR DWI , non-enhancing glioma remain difficult differentiate nontumorous lesion , include arise demyelination , inflammation , encephalomalacia gliosis . To overcome deficiency structural imaging , metabolic imaging use complementary imaging technique diagnosis brain tumor . MRS PET/CT two type metabolic imaging tool exhibit promising utility brain tumor imaging . Previous research reveal maximum Cho/NAA index ( CNImax ) threshold 2.0 predicted tumor infiltration probabilities 90 % HGGs 87 % LGGs . However , tumor locate near convex ventricular system , scalp fat skull lipid could affect quality MRS imaging . Moreover , elevation CNImax detect intracranial tumor lymphoma non-neoplastic lesion cause demyelination , encephalitis vasculitis . PET/CT also allow noninvasive study various biologic process tumor tissue . Among various type radiotracers synthetized detect brain tumor , 11C-MET well-established PET/CT radiotracer brain tumor detection delineation . Because comparatively low background activity normal brain tissue , 11C-MET PET/CT differentiate nontumorous lesion malignant lesion high sensitivity specificity . Though overall sensitivity 11C-MET PET/CT 76 % 100 % , sensitivity low study higher proportion non-enhancing low-grade gliomas8 . Given advantage limitation MRS 11C-MET PET/CT , investigator attempt evaluate whether combination two metabolic imaging tool improve sensitivity radiological diagnosis non-enhancing supratentorial glioma .</detailed_description>
