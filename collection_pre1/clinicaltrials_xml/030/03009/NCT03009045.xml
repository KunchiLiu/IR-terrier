	<detailed_description>The problem interest doctor look new antibiotic treatment bone joint infection . Treatment bone joint infection standardize , allow wide range antibiotic therapy potentially give . A type bacteria call S. aureus common cause bone joint infection . Methicillin resistant S. aureus ( MRSA ) type bacteria kill antibiotic , increasingly common U.S. non-U.S. medical center . Trauma-associated bone joint infection also common problem . Victims major trauma often suffer bone fracture , require temporary permanent use metal synthetic device external-fixation pin , plate , screw . These synthetic device also get infect cause bone joint infection . This problem study investigate whether antibiotic call tedizolid tolerable , safe effective treat bone joint infection . Tedizolid new FDA-approved antibiotic , give bloodstream via IV orally form pill . Tedizolid less side effect compare linezolid effective type bacteria like S. aureus . Other research also suggest side effect associate long-term therapy old type antibiotic may find tedizolid . This study advance scientific knowledge antibiotic treatment bone joint infection . Given large increase burden disease bone joint infection increase acceptability oral antibiotic management , tedizolid hold promise good option patient bone joint infection . Harbor-UCLA Medical Center large medical center County Los Angeles , populous County United States . The Infectious Disease consult service see many bone joint infection . Use prolong antibiotic common setting . The investigator believe tedizolid address unmet need oral antibiotic well-tolerated efficacious use prolong therapy bone joint infection .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Treatment bone joint infection therapy Grampositive organism require , determine treat physician treatment least 4 week plan . Bone joint infection traumaassociated bone joint infection define clinically use radiologic ( e.g. , MRI ) and/or surgical ( e.g. , intraoperative finding ) definition . All subject must confirmation ( diagnosis mention chart ) patient 's primary physician consultant patient likely bone joint infection require prolonged antibiotic therapy . Aged 18 year 85 year . Plans treat bone joint infection outpatient set . Limited planned course antibiotic ( i.e. , indefinite treatment plan chronic suppression ) . Coadministration antibiotic target causative potentially causative organism ( e.g. , fluoroquinolones ) acceptable . Able come research clinic study followup visit study period . Planned prolonged hospitalization ( &gt; 1 week ) . Pregnancy ( female subject childbearing age give pregnancy test prior enrollment ) breast feeding . If woman childbearing potential , must consistently use acceptable method contraception ( IUD , injectable contraceptive , birth control patch , OCP , barrier method , abstinence ) baseline course antibiotic ( 412 week ) . If male patient 's sexual partner childbearing potential , male patient must acknowledge consistently use acceptable method contraception define baseline course antibiotic ( 412 week ) .

Platelets &lt; 150,000 k/cumm Severe hepatic dysfunction define liver function test ( ALT , ALP , AST , total bilirubin ) &gt; 3.0 time upper limit normal . determine follow limit baseline CMP obtain within past 7 day . If CMP perform within past 7 day , baseline level may use CMP perform within past 2 month long another CMP perform day enrollment subject 's level within follow limit . Hypersensitivity tedizolid oxazolidinoneclass antibiotic similar compound . Ongoing antibioticassociated colitis . A diet high tyraminecontaining food pickle fermented meat cheese , wine , avocado per investigator discretion . Concurrent use sodium picosulfate ( brand name : Sodipic Picofast , Laxoberal , Laxoberon , PurgOdan , Picolax , Guttalax , Namilax , PicoSalax Prepopik ) . Previous participation study . Use tedizolid condition past 3 month . Any medical , psychological , social condition , opinion Investigator , would prevent patient fully participate study would represent concern study compliance constitute safety concern patient .</criteria>
