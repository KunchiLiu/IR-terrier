	<detailed_description>Specific Aims Primary Aims 1 . Describe person environment characteristic activity pattern resident LTC facility . 2 . Modify OBCHI ground evidence-based result Aim 1 specific facility resident . 3 . Test effectiveness OBCHI conduct activity department staff , relative usual activity , measure quality life , activity engagement , social participation . H1a-c : Those receive OBCHI significantly great improvement ) quality life , b ) activity engagement , c ) social participation post-intervention relative receive usual activity . H2a-c : Those receive OBCHI great maintenance improvement ) quality life , b ) activity engagement , c ) social participation 1-month follow-up , relative receive usual activity . 4 . Determine cost-effectiveness intervention term quality adjust life year ( QALY ) health factor . H3 : When OBCHI proven effective promoting quality life usual activity , investigator expect OBCHI produce high QALY low cost per QALY . H4 : Between two mutually exclusive treatment , OBCHI intervention efficient ( effective less costly ) cost save negative incremental cost-effectiveness ratio ( ICER ) compare receive usual activity . Exploratory Aim 5 . Examine person characteristic ( i.e . cultural heritage , life experience social support , resilience , depression , resident demographic [ age , gender , ethnicity ] ) select environment characteristic ( i.e. , participant perception intervention facility ) potential moderator relationship treatment condition ( OBCHI versus usual care ) change adaptation outcomes pre- post-intervention .

About 70 percent person 65 require spending time LTC service , 40 percent require nursing home care period time . Relocation move one permanent home another permanent home sometimes precipitate illness consider significant life event . Skinner note force relocation could disturb effect upon elderly include loss social community connection . However , even plan relocation , encounter new unfamiliar environment require old person rethink way life differ adjustment duration week several year . Many factor determine way 'new life ' evolve include : past adaptive strategy life experience , family support system , socioeconomic resource , cultural value . Moving familiar environment unfamiliar one involve adaptation , regardless age . Adaptation process involve interaction person environment . Indicators successful adaptation LTC include : develop sense identity place , care need meet , know know resident , maintain develop social network , continuity lifestyle , maintain control life situation . As defined study , adaptation normal process person encounter perceive challenge environment able successfully manage challenge measure increase quality life , activity engagement social participation . Central adaptation cultural heritage individual bring LTC facility upon relocation . Because culture learn belief , value , custom , action , communication , life way individual , expect permeate aspect life residential facility . Attention individual 's cultural heritage begin make in-roads daily life routine encounter facility . Acknowledgement resident 's culture major contribute factor his/her quality life ( QOL ) . However , QOL complex construct use synonymously term like well-being , life satisfaction , functional health . Lawton assert QOL collection dimension comprise objective subjective factor may include follow : behavioral competence , objective environment , perceive QOL , psychological well-being , health-related status . Other factor associate QOL include : interaction family friend , personal quality , room meal item , number health problem , staff-resident ratio continuity care . These finding attest importance person-environment 'match ' QOL issue resident consider . Incorporating meaningful activity social connection live elder circumscribe illness disability particularly important QOL . Gerontological literature concern activity elder concentrate upon personal care instrumental activity contribute health functional status . These obligatory task essential one 's survival , perhaps even significant elder 's well-being discretionary activity involve social meaningful occupation ; finding support proposition activity social support system important mediating impact illness well-being . In summary , relationship relocation , culture , adaptation , QOL , activity engagement , social participation reflect outcomes failure provide culturally competent culturally sensitive care occur . With increase diversity US population , practitioner challenge deliver culturally competent service improve QOL diverse LTC resident .</detailed_description>
