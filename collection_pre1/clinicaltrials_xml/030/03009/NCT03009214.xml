Presence measurable tumour accord RECIST 1.1. criterion 3 . At least 4 week completion previous cytotoxic chemotherapy , 6 week biological therapy ( monoclonal antibody ) cancer immunotherapy ( immune checkpoint modulators ) 2 week target therapy ( receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitor ) time administration AMC303 . 4 . Male female patient , least 18 year age 5 . Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group ( ECOG ) performance status 0 2 6 . Life expectancy &gt; 12 week . 7 . Adequate haematological function define Absolute neutrophil count ( ANC ) &gt; 1,500 / µL Platelets &gt; 100,000 / µL Haemoglobin &gt; 9 g /dL . 8 . Adequate renal function define Glomerular filtration rate ( GFR ) ≥ 50 ml/min accord local laboratory standard Serum creatinine &lt; 1.5 mg / dL . 9 . Adequate hepatic function define Total bilirubin &lt; 1.5x institutional upper limit normal ( ULN ) AST , ALT ≤ 3x institutional ULN &lt; 5x institutional ULN know hepatic metastasis Alkaline phosphatase &lt; 3x institutional ULN &lt; 5x institutional ULN know hepatic metastasis . 10 . Patient may central nervous system ( CNS ) involvement metastasis treat stable least 4 week completion radiation therapy and/or surgery . Stable disease define absence new neurological symptom , absence need steroid therapy radiographic confirmation stable disease . Radiographic confirmation stable disease 4 week completion radiation therapy require unless indicated neurological examination . 11 . All female subject consider childbearing potential unless postmenopausal ( least 12 month consecutive amenorrhea , appropriate age group without know suspected cause ) , sterilize surgically . For female participant female partner childbearing potential , willingness able use two form highly effective contraception method ( e.g . oral contraceptive condom , intrauterine device condom ) study 30 day last study treatment . For male participant male partner childbearing potential , willingness able use two form highly effective contraception method ( e.g . oral contraceptive condom , intrauterine device condom , ) study three month last study treatment . 12 . Provision sign Informed Consent prior study related procedure perform 1 . Receipt investigational agent within 28 day prior first administration AMC303 . Investigational monoclonal antibody must give within 6 week treatment start AMC303 . 2 . Enrolment another clinical study investigational drug 3 . Presence residual toxicity CTCAE Grade &gt; 1 prior antitumour therapy within 2 week first treatment AMC303 exception Grade 3 alopecia infusion site reaction 4 . Severe concurrent illness psychiatric illness/social situation would limit compliance study requirement 5 . Anticipation major surgical procedure within first 4 week first dose 6 .
