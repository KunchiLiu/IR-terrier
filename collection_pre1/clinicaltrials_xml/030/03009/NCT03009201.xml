	<brief_summary>This phase Ib trial study side effect best dose ribociclib give together doxorubicin hydrochloride treat patient soft tissue sarcoma spread place remove surgery . Ribociclib may stop growth tumor cell block enzymes need cell growth . Drugs use chemotherapy , doxorubicin hydrochloride , work different way stop growth tumor cell , either kill cell , stop dividing , stop spread . Giving ribociclib doxorubicin hydrochloride may work well treat patient soft tissue sarcoma .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Ribociclib Doxorubicin Hydrochloride Treating Patients Metastatic Advanced Soft Tissue Sarcomas That Can Be Removed Surgery</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To determine recommended phase 2 dose ( RP2D ) ribociclib combination doxorubicin subject advance soft tissue sarcoma . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . To assess preliminary anti-tumor activity ribociclib combination doxorubicin subject advance soft tissue sarcoma . II . To assess preliminary anti-tumor activity ribociclib combination doxorubicin subject advance soft tissue sarcoma . III . To characterize safety tolerability ribociclib combination doxorubicin . IV . To characterize pharmacokinetics ( PK ) profile ribociclib doxorubicin . TERTIARY OBJECTIVES : I . Assessment association potential biomarkers clinical outcome . OUTCOME : This dose-escalation study ribociclib . Patients receive ribociclib orally ( PO ) daily day 1-7 , doxorubicin hydrochloride intravenously ( IV ) day 10 . Treatment repeat every 21 day 6 course absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . MAINTENANCE : Patients receive ribociclib PO daily day 1-21 . Courses repeat every 28 day absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . After completion study treatment , patient follow 30 day every 12 week 12 month .</detailed_description>
