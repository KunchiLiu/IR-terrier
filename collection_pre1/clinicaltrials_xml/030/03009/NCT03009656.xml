	<detailed_description>Background : The emergency set acute neurological condition , stroke , peculiar due time pressure limited resource diagnostics . Clinical skill essential swift accurate bedside diagnosis thus basis early correct treatment . This especially evident context compute tomography standard neuroimaging method world-wide limitation detect small infarct , stroke posterior fossa reduce sensitivity stroke mimic , epileptic seizure migraine aura . To date , accuracy clinical bedside diagnosis stroke neurologist verify magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) emergency set studied detail . Management acute stroke patient main interest neurovascular research group Inselspital Bern . For example , investigator analyse prediction large vessel occlusion acute stroke patient clinical examination find significant association stroke severity measure NIHSS score location vessel occlusion . Analysis outcome stroke patient mild rapidly improve symptom demonstrate three four patient favourable outcome , central vessel occlusion likely deteriorate poor outcome . These study show correlation clinical symptom mechanism stroke , important outcome treatment . Importantly , however , quality clinical assessment likely highly variable , example depend experience treat physician . Factors influence clinical assessment , need do high temporal emotional pressure emergency set investigate far might crucial rapid successful treatment ( `` time brain '' ) .In order improve clinical diagnosing future treatment essential quantify accuracy clinical diagnosis stroke emergency setting ( `` good neurologist ? '' ) assess whether difference experienced staff neurologist junior physician . Rationale : By assess whether prediction aetiology acute neurological deficit experience-based investigator aim understand symptoms/signs impede in-experienced swiftly make correct diagnosis emergency set . This help improve resident training treatment patient acute neurological deficit .</detailed_description>
