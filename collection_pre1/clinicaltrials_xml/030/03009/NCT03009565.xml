	<detailed_description>Introduction : The human gastrointestinal system populate variety symbiotic microorganism , namely microbiota . Its total weight approximately 2 kilogram , contain trillion microorganism . The microbiome total genetic ( metagenomic ) data microbiota . In recent year , development efficient method genome sequence bio-informatics enable fast accurate quantification qualification microbiome , make microbiome analysis lead method microbiota research . Coronary artery disease ( CAD ) account 8 million death yearly worldwide . In particular , acute coronary syndrome ( ACS ) remain major cause morbidity mortality responsible 1 million hospital admission United States annually . The pathophysiologic hallmark ACS coronary thrombosis cause atherosclerotic plaque injury , two type injury describe . The first plaque rupture , remain common cause coronary athero-thrombosis , second superficial plaque erosion recognize increase frequency . As opposed plaque rupture , lesion cause erosion thin fibrous cap , abundant inflammatory cell , large lipid core , rather rich extracellular matrix , proteoglycans glycosaminoglycans . Imaging study coronary compute tomographic angiography ( CCTA ) diagnostic coronary catheterization without optical coherence tomography ( OCT ) use increasingly clinical practice order characterize mechanism responsible unstable/vulnerable atherosclerotic plaque . The human gut microbiota interact extensively host metabolic exchange co-metabolism substrate ; thereby contribute variety metabolic immunologic mechanism human body . CAD major field interest microbiota research , several finding connect gut microbiota CAD pathophysiology . First , microbiota associate metabolic syndrome , namely obesity insulin resistance . It hypothesize gut microbiota may increase short-chain fatty acid , eventually increase appetite , thus cause obesity . Another hypothesis gut microbiota endotoxin may translocate bloodstream , elicit inflammatory cascade eventually promote atherosclerosis . Second , microbiota may also role development atherosclerosis . In patient symptomatic atherosclerosis , unique microbiome pattern may pro-inflammatory characteristic . Recently , unique microbial pattern find among patient high cardiovascular risk profile . Third , gut microbiota metabolize dietary phosphatidylcholine ( lecitine ) produce metabolite trimethylamine-N-oxide ( TMAO ) , associate increase risk cardiovascular event . The data publish far relate solely interaction human gut microbiome cardiovascular risk factor . To best investigator 's knowledge understanding , microbiome analysis patient establish diagnosis CAD ( include ACS ) lacking . Objectives : The purpose current study investigate gut microbiota patient symptomatic CAD , stable acute phase . The investigator hypothesize study participant would present unique microbiome signature may provide novel insight pathophysiology atherosclerotic CAD afford putative therapeutic implication . After establish unique microbiome signature large cohort CAD patient , investigator would correlate TMAO level investigate part pathophysiology CAD . In final stage , investigator would try find way adjust personalize treatment option change `` pro-atherosclerotic '' gut microbiota . By use data current study investigator ' previous 1000 patient cohort know microbiome nutritional profile , would able search specific target nutritional intervention , probiotic . Then , investigator would monitor patient sequence microbiome nutritional intervention . Methods : Study design recruitment . Study participants patient age 30-80 arrive Rabin Medical Center suspect CAD able provide inform consent . Participants provide medical , lifestyle , nutritional questionnaire . Blood pressure heart-rate measurement take hospitalization well blood test fecal sample and/or rectal swab . In order evaluate and/or treat suspect atherosclerotic disease participant undergo cardiac CT and/or cardiac catheterization accordance standard care base upon decision treat cardiologist . Diagnostics treatment option base participant ' medical condition regardless aforementioned study protocol . The control group select represent age , sex cardiovascular risk factor -matched group without current CAD . Further exclusion criterion control group antibiotic consumption follow 3 month , inflammatory bowel disease , significant chronic disease may influence microbiota ( cancer , autoimmune disease , chronic immunosuppressive treatment ) . The control group undergo cardiac CT coronary angiography accord clinical suspicion order rule-out CAD irrespective study protocol . Blood sample . 10 ml venous blood collect Ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid ( EDTA ) gel clot activator -containing tube enrol patient study participant . The concentration serum creatinine , troponin , creatine phosphokinase ( CPK ) , hemoglobin , triglyceride ( TG ) , total cholesterol ( TC ) , high-density lipoprotein ( HDL ) , low-density lipoprotein ( LDL ) , glucose , c-reactive protein ( CRP ) , b-type natriuretic peptide ( BNP ) hemoglobin A1c ( HbA1C ) measure automatic biochemistry analyzer . In addition , level TMAO measure blood plasma use Ultra-High Performance Liquid Chromatography - Mass Spectrometric - Multiple Reaction Monitoring ( UHPLC-MS/MRM ) previously describe . Nutritional profiling . All participant report habit food consumption fill Food Frequency Questionnaire ( FFQ ) . Cardiac CT analysis . Selected participant undergo CT angiography evaluation quantification CAD use 256-slice system ( Brilliance iCT , Philips Healthcare , Cleveland , Ohio ) . Data acquire collimation 96 X 0.625 mm gantry rotation time 330 ms. Intravenous injection 60 90 ml nonionic contrast agent flow rate 5 ml/s follow 30-ml saline chase bolus ( 3 ml/s ) . Acquisition perform inspiratory breath hold electrocardiogram record simultaneously allow , dependent heart rate , retrospective prospective gating data . All image reconstruct slice thickness 0.67 mm slice increment 0.34 mm . The complete dataset transmit dedicated CT workstation 3-dimensional reconstruction tool specifically design coronary angiography ( Philips Intellispace Portal , version 7.0 ) allow multiplanar reformation quantitative plaque analysis . An independent reader review study . Each vessel contain significant stenosis analyze curve multiplanar reformatted image long-axis cross-sectional view . Diameters site maximum stenosis proximal distal reference measure . Degree stenosis calculate ratio difference diameter maximum stenosis mean diameter proximal distal reference divide mean diameter proximal distal reference express percentage . Remodeling index calculate out vessel area site maximum stenosis divide mean out vessel area proximal distal reference . Positive remodeling define remodel index ≥ 1.05 . Plaque volume automatically calculated volume voxels segment luminal outer vessel boundary curve multiplanar reformatted image . Proximal distal reference use proximal distal end plaque . The investigator report total volume plaque volume plaque subtypes : calcify , non-calcified , mixed plaque . Cardiac catheterization percutaneous coronary intervention ( PCI ) . Patients admitted catheterization laboratory accord clinical presentation , take account current ESC/AHA clinical guideline . The cardiac catheterization procedure perform use standard percutaneous technique via radial femoral artery . Coronary lesion evaluate operator term stenosis visual estimation use objective measurement , quantitative coronary analysis ( QCA ) . Coronary intervention , include balloon angioplasty stent implantation implement need accord severity coronary stenosis i.e . ( ≥70 % diameter stenosis ) . Adjunctive coronary imaging ( OCT intravascular ultrasound ) perform accord operator 's discretion regardless study protocol . All patient treat procedure anticoagulation ( mostly unfractionated heparin ) use careful monitoring activate clotting time 250-300 second . After angioplasty procedure , patient treat dual anti-platelet therapy combine aspirin P2Y12 inhibitor ( clopidogrel , prasugrel ticagrelor , accord clinical indication ) 6-12 month , unless contra-indication , treatment oral anti-coagulants . Genomic DNA Extraction Filtering . Genomic DNA stool sample purify use PowerMag Soil DNA isolation kit ( MoBio ) optimize Tecan automate platform .
