	<brief_summary>The main objective study achieve cross-cultural psychometric validation Xerostomia Inventory initially develop English language French Language . This achieve two stage : First , cross-cultural validation , second , psychometric validation The cross-cultural validation perform accord methodology Institute Work Health , accord recommend six phase . In second step , psychometric validation do use longitudinal study . Indeed , observational , longitudinal , prospective study set . Analysis result help define feasibility acceptability tool , validity ( content validity , perceive validity , construct validity , concurrent validity , discriminant validity ) , reliability ( internal consistency reproducibility time ) . Longitudinal follow-up patient expect also assess predictive validity responsiveness .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Validation French Version Xerostomia Inventory</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Medical context : There intra-individual inter-individual variability production saliva . Various factor influence production saliva . Saliva flow tends decrease age , sleep , emotional state , increase eating , pregnancy . Some drug increase salivary flow , others decrease . Tobacco alcohol tend impair quality saliva . Furthermore , 43 % 40-64 year 61 % 65 take least one antisialic medication . Lack saliva cause problem chew , swallow , speaking , taste perception . There increase number oropharyngeal candidiasis affect feed behavior would responsible malnutrition elderly , increase number caries subject still toothed . For edentulous partially dentate subject , salivary film play two role : first allow adhesion complete almost complete denture ; follow protect oral mucosa . In subject suffer mouth dryness denture become difficult . In addition , saliva essential first phase digestion , creation correct bolus . There several method measure salivary flow . The common include : - The measurement salivary flow rest , subject leave saliva mouth allow flow slowly spit funnel connect graduate tube either 6 12 minute . This test perform either rest stimulate use paraffin cube citric acid . These test long therefore suitable elderly . - The salivary flow measurement use compress weight 0.95 g weigh place tongue subject 5 minute . Once elapsed time , pad weigh , simple subtraction determines weight saliva produce 5 minute . This test do like previous one rest stimulation . Secretion rest varies author 0,05mℓ / min 0,4mℓ / min . The mouth dryness define total salivary flow rate 0.1 unstimulated +/- 0,1mℓ / min ≤ 0.16 mℓ / min . The salivary potential hydrogen ( pH ) vary 6.5 8.5 . Decreased salivary flow cause decrease pH promote degradation oral health status . Tool : The Xerostomia Inventory scale measurement xerostomia eleven item use daily practice research , result sum score give score represent severity drought oral perceive subject . This tool develop 1999 cover experimental behavioral aspect xerostomia , show acceptable psychometric characteristic . Today , tool available English , Spanish Portuguese language With study tool measure xerostomia available French ; may use clinical study daily practice dentist speech therapist obtain subjective measure dry mouth , particularly elderly vulnerable subject consequence xerostomia . Currently way measure xerostomia , difficult ass process associate patient case treatment administer impossible say whether effective . The aim study achieve cross-cultural psychometric validation version Xerostomia Inventory French Language .</detailed_description>
