	<brief_summary>Closed-loop control anesthesia involve use feedback measure clinical effect continuously adjust drug infusion rate . As result , anesthetic drug deliver variable rate frequently personalize individual patient . The aim provide great stability optimal depth anesthesia , reduce occurrence under- overdosing , goal ultimately improve patient outcome . The purpose randomized , control equivalence trial compare controller performance closed-loop control induction maintenance total intravenous anesthesia , use iControl system , addition low ( analgesic ) dose ketamine versus saline control .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>The Effect Low Dose Intra-operative Ketamine Closed-loop Controlled General Anesthesia</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>For primary outcome measure , investigator hypothesize controller performance low-dose ketamine equivalent controller performance without low-dose ketamine . The primary outcome measure , controller performance , percentage time maintenance phase depth-of-hypnosis ( DOH ) measure within +-10 point set point patient receive low dose ketamine versus receive saline control . This study consider clinical data interest intra- post-operative context order establish broad understanding potential implication use low dose ketamine closed-loop control anesthesia . In OR , investigator record indication anesthetic quality , vital sign occurrence unwanted intra-operative event . Propofol remifentanil consumption quantify , requirement intervention record . The investigator also record post-operative patient outcomes previously associate ketamine administration , acute post-operative pain intensity , opioid requirement , occurrence PONV , shiver occur post-anesthesia care unit ( PACU ) .</detailed_description>
