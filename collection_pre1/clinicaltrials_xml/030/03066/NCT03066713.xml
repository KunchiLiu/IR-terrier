	<brief_title>Post-prandial Glucose Response From Phytochemical Rich Potato Products</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Preliminary result anthocyanin rich potato product suggest reduce postprandial glycemic response might expect certain type potato product phenolic antioxidant may play critical role predict physiological response potato product . Further , consume early day , breakfast , reduce glycemic response may serve mitigate appetite food consumption later day . Investigators aim good understand characteristic commercial potato product ( i.e . frozen potato product ) different phenolic profile content , may alter postprandial glycemic response subsequent appetitive behavior . Specifically , investigator assess glycemic response serve potato product morning use continuous glucose monitoring . Further , appetite subsequent food consumption later day assess appetite log continuous glucose monitoring .</detailed_description>
