	<brief_summary>DNA biomarkers urine important diagnostic prognostic indicator bladder cancer . Many genetic alteration identify urinary DNA . However , bladder tumor harbor mutation commonly alter oncogene . Thus , reach satisfactory sensitivity specificity new diagnostic test include multiple biomarkers . The investigator conduct prospective evaluation panel mutation urine-DNA test detection urothelial bladder carcinoma patient gross hematuria cystoscope .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Urinary DNA representative tumour genome provide promise resource liquid biopsy non-invasive genomic profile urothelial bladder cancer . Voided urine sample collect prior cystoscopy . Cell free DNA cellular DNA extract analyze . A blood sample take . In patient bladder wall finding suspicious cancer , bladder wall biopsy take submitted histopathology examination , accord clinical standard practice . Next generation sequence applied hotspots mutation DNA urine , blood tumor . Logistic regression use analyze association predictor variable bladder cancer . The investigator confirm couple common mutation occur urine-DNA blood-derived DNA simultaneously verify specificity sensitivity individual variance mutation combination establish predictive model optimal robustness diagnosis bladder cancer . Moreover , external consistency test perform subsequent patient collection .</detailed_description>
