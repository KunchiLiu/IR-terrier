	<brief_summary>Introduction : Graves disease ( GD ) characterize thyrotoxicosis goiter , arise circulate autoantibody bind stimulate thyroid hormone receptor ( TSHR ) . Graves ' ophthalmopathy ( GO ) characterize inflammation , expansion extraocular muscle increase retroorbital fat . There currently three form therapy offer : anti-thyroid drug ( ATD ) ( thionamides ) , radioactive iodine ( RAI ) total thyroidectomy ( Tx ) . There currently consensus treatment Grave 's disease GO . Objective : To examine difference outcome GO patient moderate-to-severe GO , receive Tx versus ATD suffer first relapse GO GO stay follow initial decrease ATD therapy 6 month . Methods : This prospective randomized clinical trial observer blind analysis analyze 60 patient moderate-to-severe GO receive Tx versus ATD without surgery . Main outcome variable include : muscle index measurement via ultrasound thyroid antibody level . Additional outcome variable include : CAScore/NOSPECS score , superonasal index measurement via ultrasound quality life score .</brief_summary>
