	<detailed_description>This study continuation two CTSN randomize trial -- - Severe Ischemic Mitral Regurgitation ( SMR ) Trial ( NCT00807040 ) Moderate Ischemic Mitral regurgitation ( MMR ) Trial ( NCT00806988 ) -- - purpose assess long-term outcome index surgical therapy . Key clinical outcome collect utilizing electronic medical record , patient and/or family input , public record , healthcare- vital status-related database . Extended follow-up data obtain 199 SMR 270 MMR trial participant , alive 2-year follow-up evaluation . Patients follow minimum 5 year 10 year randomization ( time index surgical procedure ) . This follow-up data collection conduct Cardiothoracic Surgical Trials Network ( CTSN ) primarily utilize minimal PHI necessary link data obtain MMR SMR trial healthcare- and/or vital status-related database . Because design surgical trial ischemic mitral regurgitation would use mortality primary endpoint require enrollment thousand patient , select primary endpoint CTSN SMR MMR trial echocardiographic measure leave ventricular remodeling . Secondary endpoint include , among others , survival , adverse event , readmission cost 2-year period . The SMR trial show difference leave ventricular reverse remodeling , rate moderate severe mitral regurgitation recurrence significantly high mitral valve repair , result heart failure-related adverse event cardiovascular admission . Longer-term follow-up critical ass whether observed trend amongst SMR patient continue whether survival difference manifest time . In moderate ischemic mitral regurgitation , mitral valve repair provide durable correction mitral regurgitation coronary artery bypass grafting ( CABG ) alone , repair improve survival reduce overall adverse event readmission , associate early hazard neurological supraventricular arrhythmic event . Longer-term follow-up MMR patient provide insight whether high degree recurrent mitral regurgitation CABG alone associate difference adverse event , readmission survival . Additionally , benefit alternative surgical treatment ischemic mitral regurgitation , differential upfront risk cost , likely extend beyond 2 year . Cost-effectiveness analysis delineate long-term cost-benefit trade-off mitral valve repair versus replacement SMR , CABG repair versus CABG alone MMR , inform surgical decision making , examine difference life expectancy risk profile different patient group affect cost-effectiveness time . This extend follow-up provide important clinical health policy insight .</detailed_description>
