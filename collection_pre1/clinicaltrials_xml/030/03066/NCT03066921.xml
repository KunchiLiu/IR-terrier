	<brief_summary>Previous study find lactic acid bacteria could inhibit activity performance aristolochic acid ( AAs ) improve apoptosis proximal tubular epithelial cell ( NRK-52E ) renal fibrosis rat . The aim study assessment novel health food lactic acid bacteria prevent renal dysfunction replace assist conventional drug treatment . This study 300 hemodialysis patient dialysis quality assessment index ( KT/V , urea reduction ratio ( URR ) , albumin , prealbumin , Hb , CRP… ) screen three month , stability situation dialysis patient . They divide two group order conduct ergonomic assessment . One group maintain original diet medicine . The group take novel lactic acid bacteria placebo ( 1x1011 cfu/3±0.2 g/bag ) every morning evening meal . The effect 0 , 6 , 12 , 18 , 24 week novel lactic acid bacteria assess starvation 4 week . Group C control group give test sample , continue observe . The overall goal aforementioned study develop novel food product lactic acid bacteria improve dialysis quality hemodialysis patient . The investigator hope novel product get patent commercialize .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Evaluation Of The Efficacy Strain-Specific Probiotic Formulation Hemodialysis Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Background : Insulin resistance ( IR ) associate metabolic disorder common feature chronic kidney disease ( CKD ) accumulate evidence suggest important contributor cardiovascular burden CKD patient . In recent year , modification intestinal ﬂora activation inflammation pathway implicate pathogenesis IR patient suffer metabolic syndrome . These important discovery lead major advance understand mechanisms uraemia-induced IR . Furthermore , recent study show impairment intestinal barrier renal function function well change composition gut microbiome contribute prevail inflammation , gut-derived uremic toxin . Some uraemic toxin link pathogenesis IR . Probiotics one functional food believe mediate health promote activity modulate composition gut health . Ingestion probiotic show influence gut microbiota composition also secretion gut hormone ameliorate insulin resistance animal model . Limited trial human also show supplementation probiotic affect glucose homeostasis , improve diabetes related comorbidities metabolic syndrome , hypertension , hyperlipidemia . It also increase clear many multifactorial physiological function gut bacteria highly strain specific , preselection appropriate probiotic strain base expression functional biomarkers critical Objectives hypothesis : To address research gap , randomize control trial propose determine efficacy probiotic formulation improve metabolic profile reduction uremic toxin modulate gut microbiota composition gut immune function hemodialysis patients.The investigator hypothesize probiotic supplementation improve blood glucose control well relate metabolic aberration low level gut-derived uremic toxin . Methodology : This single center , double blind randomize parallel group control trial 6 month probiotic formulation strain specific lactobacillus placebo . After screen eligible subject select . Then , consent take 4 week washout period , participant randomly assign either receive probiotic formulation placebo 6 month . Measurements blood parameter include glycemic control related parameter , lipid profile , nutritional marker , inflammatory marker uremic toxin . Nutritional assessment , quality life assessment anthropometry measurement take place baseline , 24 month .</detailed_description>
