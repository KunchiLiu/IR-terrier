	<brief_summary>Objectives : Intravenous ( IV ) fluid administration fundamental component diabetic ketoacidosis ( DKA ) treatment . Normal saline ( NS ) , common IV fluid use DKA management , contain chloride human blood . Excessive amount chloride show cause detrimental metabolic acidosis . Other IV fluid physiologic chloride level , lactate ringer ( LR ) . This study compare rate hyperchloremic metabolic acidosis child treat NS treat LR determine effect overall length acidosis length stay hospital intensive care unit . Design : Single-center , double blind , randomize control trial . Subjects : Children age 0 18 year present diabetic ketoacidosis require pediatric intensive care unit admission . Patients evidence shock , multi-organ failure clinically significant cerebral edema exclude . The project study population 104 patient , 52 arm . Interventions : Patients enrol within 1 hour presentation emergency room pediatric intensive care unit transfer directly another facility . They randomize receive intravenous fluid contain 0.9 % saline lactate ringer . All patient treat use institutional DKA protocol content intravenous fluid difference treatment arm . Study intervention last end acute management DKA . Planned measurement study outcome : The primary study outcome duration metabolic acidosis . Resolution metabolic acidosis define three way : 1 . Normalization ketosis ; 2 . Normalization serum pH ; 3 . Normalization serum bicarbonate level . Secondary outcome include length stay pediatric intensive care unit length stay hospital . All outcomes correlate overall chloride load give via intravenous fluid DKA management . Regression model control baseline difference group regard severity DKA , newly diagnose poorly control diabetes mellitus .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>There limited prospective clinical study pediatrics patient examine association chloride content intravenous fluid outcome DKA . This prospective randomized control trial performed compare duration acidosis hospital length stay child DKA admit pediatric intensive care unit treat intravenous fluid contain NS LR . The primary study hypothesis use LR associate decreased duration hyperchloremic metabolic acidosis , therefore , short hospitalization use NS treatment pediatric DKA . Primary hypothesis : Children diabetic ketoacidosis ( DKA ) treat intravenous fluid contain lactated ringer ( LR ) short duration hyperchloremic metabolic acidosis hospital admission treat intravenous fluid contain normal saline ( NS ) . Secondary hypothesis : The duration acidosis hospital admission child DKA associate length stay intensive care unit hospital . Outcomes Primary outcome The primary study outcome duration metabolic acidosis . Resolution metabolic acidosis define three way : 1 . Serum ketone level &lt; 1mmol/L ; 2 . Venous pH &gt; 7.3 ; 3 . Serum bicarbonate level &gt; 18mmol/L . Secondary outcome Secondary outcome include length stay pediatric intensive care unit length stay hospital . Study design This single center , double blind , randomize control trial two treatment arm perform tertiary care child 's hospital . Patients randomize within hour presentation hospital receive DKA management use intravenous fluid contain primarily normal saline lactate ringer . All aspect DKA management arm , per institution protocol . Since treatment arm involve use intravenous fluid consider standard care treat dehydration , waiver consent request . Recruitment method Patients eligible enrollment randomization admit pediatric emergency room pediatric intensive care unit outside hospital facility DKA meet inclusion criterion . Patients screen emergency room personnel eligibility PICU admission determine , patient enrol . If transfer directly pediatric intensive care unit , pediatric critical care fellow attend physician responsible screen enrollment 24 hour day . Enrollment randomization occur within 1 hour hospital presentation . Enrollment consist assign randomization number point entry hospital ( Emergency Room Pediatric Intensive Care Unit ) place study DKA order set . Randomization method Upon enrollment , patient assign randomization number sequential order previously generate randomization table provide statistician available ER PICU study personnel . Each number correlate treatment arm visible randomization table coordinate treatment arm assignment available pharmacy personnel . Pharmacy personnel provide appropriate content intravenous fluid generic label `` DKA study fluid dextrose '' `` DKA study fluid without dextrose . '' As fluid look identical , would differ visually label , standardized labelling describe allow treating physician blind treatment arm assignment . Study Intervention All enrol patient treated use institutional DKA management protocol place emergency room pediatric intensive care unit develop collaboration endocrinology division . The difference study protocol institutional DKA protocol intravenous fluid content . Please refer study protocol schematic show supplement 1 . Upon admission ER PICU , eligible patient place cardiac monitor , admission DKA laboratory test order initial intravenous fluid bolus 10 ml/kg normal saline administer standard care . These aspect DKA management likely perform study enrollment , , identical arm treatment arm assignment affect . Subjects start continuous insulin infusion drip 0.1 U/kg/hr study intravenous fluid without dextrose 1.5 time maintenance . Per standard care , point care whole blood glucose level follow hourly , serum blood gas electrolytes every 2 hour , beta-hydroxybutyrate level every 6 hour urine ketone every void . ER subject transfer PICU continue exactly management laboratory schedule . The study protocol use acute management DKA use continuous insulin infusion stop . Our current practice convert continuous insulin intermittent subcutaneous insulin administration venous pH equal great 7.30 serum bicarbonate level equal great 15 mmol/L . Fluid Management DKA fluid management base two-bag system maintain glucose level 100 300 mg/dL ketosis correct . The first type intravenous fluid use dextrose avoid worsen initial hyperglycemia . Once serum glucose fall 300 mg/dL , 10 % dextrose-containing fluid start . All intravenous fluid contain 20mEq/L potassium acetate 20mEq/L potassium phosphate . Study fluid management follow guideline rate fluid delivery amount dextrose use standard management patient DKA . Bedside healthcare personnel treat study subject identically regardless treatment arm . To provide blind bedside staff , intravenous fluid bag label `` DKA study fluid dextrose '' `` DKA study fluid without dextrose . '' All intravenous fluid use electrolyte composition 20mEq/L potassium acetate 20mEq/L potassium phosphate .</detailed_description>
