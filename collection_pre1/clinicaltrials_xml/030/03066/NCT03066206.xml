	<brief_summary>The goal clinical research study learn poziotinib help control EGFR-positive non-small cell lung cancer ( NSCLC ) locally advanced metastatic ( spread ) . EGFR-positive NSCLC mean mutation ( type genetic change ) EGFR gene . The safety poziotinib also study .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Poziotinib EGFR Exon 20 Mutant Advanced Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer ( NSCLC )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Study Drug Administration : Each study cycle 28 day . If participant find eligible take part study , participant take 2 poziotinib tablet mouth 1 time every day participant study . Each dose take time day ( preferably morning ) glass ( 8 ounce ) water . If participant miss dose , participant take soon possible day return normal schedule follow day . Participant take extra dos follow day make forgotten dos . Participant give pill diary complete . Participant record diary dose poziotinib participant take , include participant take . Participant bring diary participant study visit . Length Study : Participant may continue take study drug long doctor think participant 's best interest . Participant longer able take study drug disease get bad , intolerable side effect occur , participant unable follow study direction . Participation study follow-up . Study Visits : On Day 1 ( +/- 7 day ) cycle Day 15 Cycle 1 : - Participant physical exam . - Blood ( 2½ teaspoon ) draw routine test . At Week 16 , participant EKG . If participant 's doctor think need , participant may additional EKGs study . Participant 's doctor discus participant . At Month 3 every 6 month , participant ECHO MUGA scan . Every 8 week , participant CT scan and/or MRI check status participant 's disease . Follow-Up Visit : About 30 day participant 's last dose study drug : - Participant physical exam . - Blood ( 2½ teaspoon ) draw routine test . - Participant EKG either ECHO MUGA scan . Long Term Follow-Up : Every 6 month , participant come clinic ECHO MUGA scan . During visit participant ask participant participant start new drug treatment . If participant come clinic , participant call study staff answer question . Each call last 10 minute . Participant continue CT scan MRIs every 8 week ( +/- 14 day ) . If disease appear get bad , participant stop scan . This investigational study . Poziotinib FDA approve commercially available . It use research purpose . The study doctor explain study drug design work . Up 30 participant enrol study . All take part MD Anderson .</detailed_description>
