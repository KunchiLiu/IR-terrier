	<brief_summary>Chronic Graft Versus Host Disease ( GVHD ) one challenge complication long term survivor allogeneic stem cell transplantation . As number allogeneic stem cell transplantation rise annually , incidence chronic GVHD rate also increase due variety factor include limited increase use peripheral blood stem cell ( PBSC ) graft , increase age donor recipient , increase use match unrelated donor . One study show much low traditional acute GHVD rate chronic GHVD similar historical rate atorvastatin administer prophylactically donor well recipient match related allogeneic stem cell transplantation , lead interest examine role Atorvastatin relation development GVHD . The investigator hypothesize administration atorvastatin recipient match unrelated allogeneic stem cell transplantation , group know high incidence chronic GHVD , would safe effective method reduce incidence chronic GVHD . Matched related allogeneic stem cell transplantation recipient include study due significantly low GVHD rate . The definition monitoring primary endpoint GVHD well establish clinical trial allogeneic stem cell transplantation investiagor utilize National Institutes Health ( NIH ) Staging System diagnosis severity assessment chronic GVHD well recommendation NIH Consensus Conference conduct clinical trial chronic GVHD . Several secondary endpoint examine define include standard complementary data examination clinical trial chronic GVHD lay NIH Consensus Conference conduct clinical trial chronic GHVD .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Randomized Study : Standard Care With Without Atorvastatin Prevention GVHD Matched Unrelated Donor BMT</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This randomize , open label phase III trial patient Acute Myeloid Leukemia , Acute Lymphocytic Leukemia , Myelodysplastic Syndrome undergo match unrelated donor transplant . Patients randomize treatment arm ( atorvastatin ) : The prophylaxis atorvastatin treatment ( take mouth ) GVHD start 14 day prior transplant continue 365 day post-transplant development significant adverse event desire primary treat physician stop administration . The patient also receive institution 's standard graft versus host disease prophylactic regimen consist two drug . It show immunosuppression two drug well single agent thus institution utilizes combination Methotrexate Tacrolimus . For match unrelated donor allogeneic transplantation patient , follow schedule Methotrexate administer intravenously ( IV ) post-transplant Days 1 , 3 6 . Tacrolimus administer 2 day prior transplant continue approximately 180 day post-transplant . Tacrolimus administer IV patient take mouth . Patients randomized standard care : Patients receive institution 's standard graft versus host disease prophylactic regimen consist two drug . It show immunosuppression two drug well single agent thus institution utilizes combination Methotrexate Tacrolimus . For match unrelated donor allogeneic transplantation patient , follow schedule Methotrexate administer intravenously ( IV ) post-transplant Days 1 , 3 6 . Tacrolimus administer 2 day prior transplant continue approximately 180 day post-transplant . Tacrolimus administer IV patient take mouth .</detailed_description>
