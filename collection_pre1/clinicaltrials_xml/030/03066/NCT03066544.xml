	<brief_title>Status Migrainosus - Differentiating Between Responders Non-responders</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Recently , major focus `` evidence-based '' treatment . Who could possibly argue base decision data ? Since high level evidence derive randomized double-blind control therapeutic trial consider treatment render large group patient general diagnosis ( e.g. , migraine ) systematic review several randomize control trial ( meta analysis ) , physicians always pride apply type evidence order select treatment . One want imagine medical treatment purely subjective . The question , however , well evidence trial applies care individual patient ? The main problem FDA-guided therapeutic trial issue number vs specificity . For result statistically biologically valid important , must include hundred often thousand participant . To achieve number , lump strategy predominates split . The trial lump together diverse subgroup , less specific result individual patient . Given trial extensive inclusion exclusion criterion , often 5 10 patient screened patient finally enrol study . Patients ill , old , young , female childbearing age , incapable give informed consent , complex , full coexisting illness often exclude trial . Yet , patient frequently visit headache center individualize medicine provide appropriate answer . Trials study migraine prevention measure pain intensity duration , attack frequency , functional disability , quality life , number work day lose , nausea , vomit , hypersensitivity light noise . Whether measure representative important aspect condition important consideration since end point comparable . Some patient make live talk . How aphasia ( difficulty find right word ) compare sensitivity light facial numbness ? For patient , sharp pain continuously pierce eye make headache impossible tolerate whereas others ongoing nausea prevents pleasure enjoy food , perhaps extreme photophobia make read work computer impossible force quit job seek comfort darkness . How , , identical weight assign various patient ? Physicians compel treat patient give condition accord identical guideline , case therapeutic trial follow strict protocol . Randomized trial mandate many patient general condition must give treatment A , result compare patient give treatment B C , placebo . Physicians , however , care one patient time must consider several variable , include : ( 1 ) patient 's medical problem ; ( 2 ) patient 's disease risk ; ( 3 ) background , genetics , socioeconomic milieu , psychology , responsibility , goal , characteristic patient ; ( 4 ) benefit risk potential therapeutic strategy treat patient 's condition prevent condition risk develop . An inescapable conclusion therefore result FDA-approved clinical trial fall short allow u 'tailor ' right treatment right patient allow u predict whether patient treat today benefit approve treatment . This conclusion question do-ability translate often state goal individualize medicine word deed . Accordingly , main goal proposal determine whether possible - setup routine clinical care - identify individual patient clear responder drug X , common denominator absent individual patient non-responders drug , vice versa . All currently available knowledge migraine pathophysiology utilized , use much time need ask many question necessary , attempt profile clear responder clear non-responders .</detailed_description>
