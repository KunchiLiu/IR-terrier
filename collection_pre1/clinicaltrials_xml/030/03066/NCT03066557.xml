	<brief_summary>Hepatocellular carcinoma ( HCC ) common primary malignant tumor liver . It lack effective drug systemic treatment HCC . Currently , Sorafenib choice approve FDA advance HCC , although prolongs survival less 3 month . The treatment advance HCC still long way go . At present , relevant phase II phase III clinical study apatinib advanced HCC ongoing . Based important discovery previous clinical study , intend enlarge sample size make observation efficacy safety apatinib patient advance HCC .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Study Combination TACE With Apatinib Patients With Hepatocellular Carcinoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Hepatocellular carcinoma ( HCC ) one lethal human cancer worldwide incidence match mortality , reflect poor prognosis disease . The surgical resection rate HCC low , prognosis poor . Although transarterial chemoembolization ( TACE ) main treatment HCC patient candidate surgical resection , consider curative procedure . For HCC , poor TACE efficacy TACE failure may relate tumor angiogenesis residual disease . Among many regulatory factor tumor angiogenesis , hypoxia-inducible factor-1α ( HIF-1α ) vascular endothelial growth factor ( VEGF ) play vital role process . Sorafenib first systemic treatment drug , approve FDA advance HCC . In order find new VEGFR-inhibitor better effect low toxicity , Jiangsu Hengrui Medicine Co. , Ltd. develop Apatinib , high-performance VEGFR-2 tyrosine kinase inhibitor . Apatinib play anti angiogenic effect treatment malignant tumor mainly inhibition VEGFR-2 , vivo vitro experiment show good tumor growth inhibitory activity Hepatocellular carcinoma , study aim verify efficacy safety Apatinib hepatocellular carcinoma patient candidate curative surgery , primary endpoint Progression Free Survival ( PFS ) .</detailed_description>
