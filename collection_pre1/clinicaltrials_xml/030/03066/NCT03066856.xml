	<brief_summary>Insulin-like growth factor I ( IGF-I ) marker insulin resistance ( IRm ) might modulate penetrance BRCA gene mutation . The investigator design demonstration project BRCA mutation carrier ( without previous diagnosis breast cancer ) test : 1. whether lifestyle intervention significantly reduceIGF-I IRm ( randomize trial ) . 2. whether mutation carrier previous diagnosis breast cancer high IRm carrier without breast cancer ( case-controlstudy ) . 3. whether IRm change time affect subsequent breast cancer incidence prognosis ( cohort follow-up ) . The investigator expect significantly reduce IGF-I IRm , find BRCA mutation carrier previous breast cancer high IRm level , , long term , woman persistent high IRm level higher penetrance bad prognosis . Confirming significant reduction IRm impact level prognosis would help develop primary prevention recommendation high risk family .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Abdominal obesity high body weight associate great risk breast cancer ( BC ) woman belong high risk family woman without family history BC . A case-control study show high energy intake , usually associate high bio-availability growth factor , associate BC risk BRCA mutation carrier . A multinational case-only study 3000 young BC woman suggest patient BRCA mutation high consumption milk . Milk directly stimulate insulin production release , associate high plasma level insulin-like growth factor I ( IGF-I ) . In case-control analysis 308 high genetic risk woman , investigator show high serum level IGF-I associate significantly increase penetrance . Consistently , mechanistic study hypothesize functional interaction BRCA gene IGF-I system . The lifetime cumulative risk ( penetrance ) BC associate BRCA mutation order 50 % , sizeable proportion mutation carrier develop disease . Therefore , penetrance genetic trait may regulate trough genetic environmental factor , include dietary , metabolic , growth factor . The investigator hypothesize marker insulin resistance ( IRm ) , plasma level glucose , insulin , IGF-I presence metabolic syndrome , affect risk prognosis sporadic BC , relevant also hereditary BC . The investigator design demonstration project BRCA mutation carrier ( without previous diagnosis BC ) test : 1. whether lifestyle intervention significantly reduce IRm ( randomize trial ) . 2. whether mutation carrier previous diagnosis BC high IRm carrier without BC ( case-control study ) . 3. whether IRm change time affect subsequent BC incidence prognosis ( cohort follow-up ) . In pilot phase investigator randomize 150 BRCA mutate woman dietary intervention control group short term ( 6 month ) trial test reduction IRm level . In present study investigator recruit 600 BRCA mutation carrier test blood level IRm change time influence risk BC BC relapse . All participant receive WCRF Decalogue prevention cancer . Participants randomize active lifestyle intervention group ( 6 full day life-style intervention activity along subsequent 6 month ) control group remain baseline recommendation . After 6 month also control group invite active intervention . The investigator expect significantly reduce IRm , find BRCA mutation carrier previous BC high IRm level , , long term , woman persistent high IRm level higher penetrance bad prognosis .</detailed_description>
	<criteria>Eligible study subject woman , aged 1870 , either unaffected affect BC , without metastasis previous ovarian cancer , underwent genetic counselling fulfil highrisk selection criterion genetic testing base personal and/or family history result carrier deleterious BRCA mutation . Unaffected BRCA mutation carrier bilateral prophylactic mastectomy include cohort censor time surgery .</criteria>
