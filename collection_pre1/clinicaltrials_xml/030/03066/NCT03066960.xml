	<brief_title>Radiofrequency Neurotomy Chronic Facet Joint Related Neck Pain</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Chronic neck pain represent common health problem . The mechanisms appear multifactorial . Researchers suggest disturbed interplay neck muscle facet joint . In Europe US radiofrequency neurotomy ( RFN ) become common treatment . The evidence base , however , still insufficient . Thus , double blind , sham-controlled , randomize , two-center trial carry include 44 participant . To simplify data collection digital internet base program use . Patients chronic neck pain , refer Oslo University Hospital St Olavs University Hospital respond non-interventional treatment , screen . Those find eligible achieve &gt; 75 % pain relief predictive test block , include . Demographic clinical data record baseline primary secondary outcome measurement recollect 3 , 6 , 9 12 month . Primary outcome measurement include self report neck function ( NDI ) pain relief . Regression analysis use identify 75 % pain relief two test block pain catastrophizing ( Pain Catastrophizing Scale = PCS ) predict response RF neurotomy . If RF neurotomy find superior sham treatment , may implement national treatment program select patient chronic neck pain .</detailed_description>
