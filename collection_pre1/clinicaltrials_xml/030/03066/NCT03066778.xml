	<brief_summary>The purpose study assess safety efficacy pembrolizumab plus standard care ( SOC ) chemotherapy ( etoposide/platinum [ EP ] ) participants newly diagnose extensive stage small cell lung cancer ( ES-SCLC ) previously receive systemic therapy malignancy . The primary study hypothesis pembrolizumab+EP prolongs Progression-free Survival ( PFS ) per Response Evaluation Criteria Solid Tumors ( RECIST ) version 1.1 blind independent central review ( BICR ) Overall Survival ( OS ) compare placebo+EP adult participant ES-SCLC .</brief_summary>
