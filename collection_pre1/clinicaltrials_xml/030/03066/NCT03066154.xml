	<brief_summary>The optimal treatment HRPC patient yet establish . Recent trial suggest benefit early treatment docetaxel castration-sensitive setting , improvement failure free survival high risk metastatic patient increase overall survival metastatic hormone-sensitive group . In recent randomize controlled trial , patient treat hormonal therapy radiotherapy adjuvant docetaxel , assume early systemic treatment high risk metastatic disease could delay progression patient aggressive primary tumor characteristic . With fact docetaxel know radiosensitizer , combine modality treatment docetaxel radiotherapy could also lead good local control reduction local recurrence . Several phase I II study do HRPC patient , evaluate combination high dose radiotherapy concurrent weekly infusion docetaxel . Oral administration docetaxel many advantage intravenously administer drug patient . Besides high patient convenience , possibly longer treatment duration achieve due good safety . Frequently occur toxicity intravenously administer docetaxel , neutropenia , hypersensitivity reaction peripheral polyneuropathy rarely observed oral docetaxel formulation ModraDoc006/r . The primary aim N15DOP study determine maximum tolerable dose ( MTD ) ModraDoc006/r give weekly bidaily schedule combine modality high dose intensity radiotherapy hormonal therapy castration-sensitive prostate cancer patient high risk disease , include positive lymph node .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Oral Docetaxel ( ModraDoc/r ) Combination With Hormonal Treatment Radiation Therapy High-risk Prostate Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Phase IA part This open-label , dose-escalating , non-randomized , single centre phase I study ModraDoc006/r combine ADT radiotherapy patient high risk prostate cancer , define node positive prostate cancer follow primary tumor characteristic : stage ≥cT2c , Gleason score ≥ 4+3 , PSA level . Phase IB part After determination MTD ModraDoc006/r combine treatment radiotherapy hormonal therapy good tolerability treatment without unexpected adverse event radiotherapy 6 week end radiotherapy , study conduct phase IB part . This part explore feasibility tolerability long term treatment ModraDoc006/r .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>1 . Histologically proven prostate cancer . 2 . All eligible patient hormone naïve nonmetastatic node positive high risk prostate cancer . Node positive cancer define radiological demonstration four pelvic lymph node ( ) consist bean shape lymph node ( ) short axis minimal 10 mm and/or round lymph node ( ) minimal size 8 mm PSMA , MRI CT scan . PSMAscans PETCholine scan may use , obligate . Since use PSMA scan significantly increase current clinical practice chance false positive result consider low patient 4 positive lymph node , histological confirmation positive lymph node require inclusion 4 pathological node see PSMA , MRI CT scan 3 .
