	<brief_title>A Study See Low Level Laser Light Can Help Treat Toenail Fungus</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Nail onychomycosis , fungus infection , typically cause fungus call dermatophytes , may also cause yeast mold . These microscopic organism invade skin tiny invisible cut small separation nail nail bed . Under condition warmth moisture , fungi grow spread . The infection begin white yellow spot tip nail , spread deep nail , cause unsightly potentially painful nail discoloration , thicken development crumble edge . Onychomycosis occur commonly toenail fingernail toenail often confine dark , warm , moist environment inside shoe fungi thrive . Toenail fungus affect approximately 23 million people US - 10 % adult . Potential complication onychomycosis include pain nail , permanent damage nail , development serious infection spread beyond foot individual suppress immune system due medication , diabetes condition , leukemia AIDS . Nail fungus difficult treat , repeat infection common . Currently available treatment onychomycosis include oral antifungal medication , antifungal lacquer , topical medication , surgical nail removal photodynamic therapy . There perfect cure toenail fungus . Even effective oral medication successful half time , topical medication successful less 10 % time . Recently , research find laser therapy show promise novel alternative treatment toenail onychomycosis . Unlike medication-driven treatment toenail fungus many side effect include serious one liver toxicity , laser therapy present minimal risk side effect . Laser therapy apply toenail onychomycosis shin laser light toenail tissue . The laser light vaporize fungus leave skin surround healthy tissue unharmed . Low level laser therapy operate principle photochemistry photoacceptor molecule absorb emitted photon induce biological cascade . Like eukaryotic cell , fungi contain highly complex organelle mitochondrion , responsible manufacturing energy molecule adenosine triphosphate ( ATP ) . Within inner mitochondrial membrane cytochrome c oxidase , identify photoacceptor molecule . It believe laser therapy could perhaps provide mean photo-destroy fungi responsible onychomycosis ( OM ) induce release highly reactive superoxide . Moreover , laser therapy show promote superoxide dismutase ( SOD ) , process responsible destruction foreign invader . Extracellular release low level mediator associate SOD increase expression chemokines , cytokine , endothelial leukocyte adhesion molecule , amplify cascade elicits inflammatory response . The physiologic function hydrogen peroxide , superoxide anion , hydroxyl free radical destroy phagocytosed microbe . By enhance natural process immune system impact structural integrity fungi strain , believe laser therapy may provide mean clinician effectively treat OM without onset adverse event .</detailed_description>
