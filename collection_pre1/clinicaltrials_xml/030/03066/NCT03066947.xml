	<detailed_description>This single arm , open label study BriaVax™ recurrent and/or metastatic breast cancer . The detailed treatment regimen follow : Pre-Vaccine Regimen : Cyclophosphamide ( Cytoxan ) 300 mg/m2 I.V. , 1x , give 48-72 hour vaccine , antiemetic provider 's choice ( steroid prohibit ) . Vaccine Day Standard Operating Procedures : 1 . Inquire regard event past week , change medication , pain scale , ECOG scale , review system . 2 . Check vaccine injection site . 3 . Perform DTH skin test intra-dermally BriaVax™ parent cell line ( ~1e6 irradiate tumor cell ) . Observe 20 minute acute hypersensitivity . Grade III high acute hypersensitivity abort therapy . 4 . Inject vaccine 0.5 ml intra-dermally thigh upper back . Monitor patient 60 minute . Vital sign assess medical attention warrant unstable . Vaccine Preparation &amp; Inoculation Regimen : Each vaccine inoculation administer via intra-dermal injection investigational site . Subjects receive 15-25 x 106 viable , irradiated transfected breast tumor cell total volume 2.0 ml Ringer 's lactate . Tumor vaccine cell irradiated ensure cell replication incompetency . Vaccine divide four aliquot 0.5 ml prepare coded study label `` Investigational Use Only '' , hand-delivered qualify sponsor 's staff principal investigator 's office day schedule inoculation , injected intra-dermally ; one anterior skin subject 's right leave thighs right leave upper back . Application anesthetic lidocaine crème may use necessary control local pain inoculation . Subjects monitor 60 minute . After least 9 subject treat safely regimen , dose BriaVax™ may escalate decreased subsequent patient base emerge data . Post-Inoculation Regimen : 48 hour ( ±24 hour ) vaccine , 96 hour ( ±24 hour ) later vaccine , patient return principal investigator 's office receive Interferon-alpha-2b ( Merck ) 0.1 ml saline , prepared follow : These also provide sponsor individual syrinx cod label , inject intra-dermally vaccine site , beneath thick area . Again , subject observed 20 minute . The DTH response also record EDC 48 hour ( ±24 hour ) visit . This vaccine cycle perform every 2 week first month treatment ( 3 vaccination ) , every month one year .</detailed_description>
