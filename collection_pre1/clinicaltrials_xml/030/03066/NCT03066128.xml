	<brief_summary>Effective management patient antiretroviral therapy ( ART ) essential improve clinical outcome prevent HIV transmission , monitor life-long ART 15 million HIV-infected people become challenge , particularly low- middle-income country ( LMICs ) . As program continue focus identify HIV-infected people start ART high CD4 threshold , HIV provider overburden , result fall retention rate . As ART coverage scale include million people , additional strain place HIV clinician laboratories manage stable patient chronic ART . Implementing point-of-care HIV VL test enable task shift nurse chronic HIV care may help mitigate burden . Point-of-care Viral Load ( VL ) test intend differentiate patient potentially fail ART , refer next level care possible ART regiment change , patient virally suppress ART manage nurse . The investigator 's scientific objective test clinical equivalence reduce cost implementing model chronic HIV care use point-of-care HIV VL assay enable streamline care task shift among healthcare worker urban clinic South Africa . The central hypothesis rapid HIV VL testing , implement nurse , effective cost-efficient strategy management chronic HIV infection majority patient , thereby allow resource direct minority patient need great attention . This work innovative us randomize evaluation implementation model combine novel diagnostic point-of-care test streamline care task shift among healthcare worker compare standard care chronic HIV care resource-limited setting . This randomized trial form basis large , multicountry proposal demonstrate clinical equivalence cost-effectiveness implementing integrate point-of-care HIV VL test streamline care model chronic HIV care LMICs . If nurse use clinic-based HIV VL test cost-effective achieve viral suppression retention care among patient ART , implementation chronic HIV care model would alleviate strain exist HIV provider laboratories LMICs .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Point-of-care Viral Load Testing Enable Streamlined Care Task Shifting Chronic HIV Care</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The study design open-label , randomize , non-inferiority implementation trial 2 study arm . Patients enrol due 6 month VL since initiate ART . Standard Care Arm : Participants Standard-of-Care ( SOC ) control arm receive standard-of-care clinic consist visit professional clinician ( Physician Professional Nurse ) stable , community pharmacy ART collection CCMDD . Viral load monitor lab-based . Participants assess clinical symptoms/signs tuberculosis , opportunistic infection , ART side effect clinical encounter . Participants high lab-based HIV VL ( ≥1,000 copies/mL ) receive intensive adherence counseling ask return clinic 2 month repeat HIV VL test . If HIV VL remain high ( ≥1,000 copies/mL ) 2 month intensive adherence counseling , patient switch second-line ART regimen physician . Intervention Arm : Participants Intervention Group receive chronic ART management Professional Nurse and/or Enrolled Nurse every 2 month , stable 6 month , community pharmacy ART collection CCMDD . Viral load monitoring POC . Enrolled Nurse visit consist clinical symptom ART side effect checklist , ART adherence questionnaire , trigger up-referral Professional Nurse/MO appropriate . Point-of-care Xpert® HIV-1 VL test perform participant clinic ensure participant receive VL result day . Participants high HIV VL ( ≥1,000 copies/mL ) refer Professional Nurse . As standard-of-care arm , receive intensive adherence counseling ask return clinic 2 month repeat point-of-care Xpert® HIV-1 VL test . Participants continue high HIV VL ( ≥1,000 copies/mL ) 2 month intensive adherence counsel switch second-line ART physician . Participants also follow 12-month study period ass study outcome measure . This study follow aspect South Africa 's ART guideline , except stable patient randomize intervention arm receive Nurse-based care Xpert® VL monitoring , comparison standard care . At end 12-month study period , participant repeat CD4 count lab-based HIV VL test Roche Taqman v.2.0 assay . The lab-based HIV VL test important use HIV VL assay compare primary outcome measure . In addition , research team evaluate outcome `` retention care '' , define collect ART refill study exit visit . Cost-Effectiveness Component : The investigator use activity-based micro-costing approach , include time motion study , estimate cost incur averted , along primary study outcome ( viral suppression retention care ) estimate cost per HIV-positive person virally suppress retain care Intervention Group , compare Standard-of-Care Group . Time motion study determine nurse time necessary conduct point-of-care HIV VL test clinical visit stable HIV-infected patient . Time motion study conduct study initiation intervention run full capacity . An experienced research assistant collect data time required complete step chronic care visit ( VL testing , clinical assessment , counsel ) study arm . Initial result share teams implement strategy improve efficiency . Observing multiple visit allow estimation average time take step ; time take research purpose ( e.g . data collection ) note separately estimate time need monitoring . Multiple staff observe capture range time require successful real-time chronic HIV care . Interviews study staff also quantify effort require step visit . Through time motion study number participant could support clinic estimate . The staff time take intervention capture opportunity cost chronic care intervention , i.e . staff time could spend different program . The micro-costing data , time motion study , clinical outcome use estimate average cost per HIV-positive client achieve viral suppression retain care chronic care model compare standard care .</detailed_description>
