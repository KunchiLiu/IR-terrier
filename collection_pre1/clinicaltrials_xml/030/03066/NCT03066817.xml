	<brief_summary>Although vitamin D know play major role multiple organ function healthy adult , include bone homeostasis , role unique population orthopaedic polytrauma patient well describe . The aim therapeutic randomize placebo-controlled feasibility study determine effect vitamin D supplementation initiate admission patient ' 25 ( OH ) -D level , bone turnover marker , clinical outcome cohort adult orthopaedic polytrauma patient . Polytrauma patient one orthopaedic injury admit urban Level I trauma center screen eligibility base upon strict inclusion exclusion criterion . Sixty patient meet criterion consent , enrol randomized 1:1 ratio intervention control ( placebo ) arm . Baseline 25 ( OH ) -D bone turnover marker level draw patient admission , intervention arm receive one-time dose ergocalciferol ( Vitamin D2 ) 400,000 IU shortly enrollment . The lab repeat 7 day initial draw discharge , whichever occur first . Patients ' daily immobilization status , baseline characteristic clinical outcome record . Statistical method use assess whether difference 25 ( OH ) -D bone turnover marker level associate intervention .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Sixty polytrauma patient present Jacobi Medical Center screen eligibility accord strict inclusion exclusion criterion study personnel admission . Medical history , physical examination , laboratory finding collect assessed ensure patient meet inclusion exclusion criterion . Eligible subject enrol obtain informed consent either subject health care proxy subject able participate decision-making process secondary injury mental status . As dose vitamin D previously study pregnant subject , female subject counsel potential pregnancy risk undergo urine pregnancy test prior administration investigational agent/placebo . Female patient test positive pregnancy remove study . Upon enrollment , study personnel assign subject study ID record information password-protected data collection document . All enrolled subject blood draws phlebotomy nursing staff above-mentioned bone turnover marker consent obtain . This include specimen collection process follow serum level study arm : 25 ( OH ) -D , PTH , collagen type I C-telopeptide , calcium , phosphorus , osteocalcin , alkaline phosphatase . This initial specimen collection occur interval 0 72 hour hospital admission . Collected specimen assign unique identifier correspond patient ' study IDs deliver core lab Jacobi Medical Center . From , specimen send outside test facility ( Northwell Laboratories , Lake Success , NY ) , specimen process occur . Normal laboratory value establish outside test facility accord CLIA standard . The study personnel liaise JMC Main Satellite Pharmacy alert regard newly enrol study subject . The pharmacist assign patient accord randomization algorithm 1:1 ratio intervention control arm , 30 patient group end study accrual . The pharmacist prepare transport investigational agent placebo subject 's location administration nursing staff . The intervention cohort receive 400,000IU liquid ergocalciferol ( 50cc 8000IU/cc Calcidol solution ) via oral , NG tube , gastrostomy route . The control cohort receive 50cc propylene glycol placebo via oral , NG tube , gastrostomy route . A repeat specimen collection above-mentioned bone turnover marker commence either 7 day patient still inpatient , discharge , whichever occur first . The specimen obtain time treated manner initial specimen . For enrolled subject , investigator collect data hospital presentation discharge standard demographic , routine laboratory result , clinical injury characteristic hospital course data ( length stay , in-hospital mortality , mobilization status , associate inpatient procedure complication ) .</detailed_description>
