	<brief_summary>The therapeutic scenario metastatic renal cancer undergo new revolution appearance novel therapeutic strategy antiangiogenic treatment , immunotherapy , addition approval new active drug follow line treatment . There currently two phase III trial first line treatment metastatic renal cancer include different combination treatment base immunotherapy . If result study positive , therapeutic algorithm would modify remain drug would reposition within therapeutic decision scheme . Sunitinib previously demonstrate benefit patient fail prior treatment cytokine , likely continue effective patient become resistant treatment new drug base immune checkpoint blockade . This phase II study develop evaluate activity sunitinib treatment immunotherapy-based regimen currently develop within phase III clinical trial .</brief_summary>
