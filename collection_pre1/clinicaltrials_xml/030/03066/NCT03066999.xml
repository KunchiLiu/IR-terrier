	<brief_summary>The Center Disease Control Prevention ( CDC ) report one four patient hospitalize United States catheterize void bladder monitor urinary output . In male population , Dr. Singh , urologist estimate 20 % catheterization difficult . Driving catheter blindly , guess whether push catheter forward manipulate get around point resistance lead risk injury increase catheter manipulate . Additional adverse event include : urosepsis , UTI bladder perforation . The standard care treatment patient difficult urinary catheterization ( DUC ) proceed cystoscopic catheter placement suprapubic tube placement . PercuVision Foley catheter micro-endoscope visualization navigation urethra nurse qualify health care professional . Moreover , allow urologists place guidewire direct vision rather call flexible cystoscope consider minor procedure . In study , investigator plan assess effectiveness ease use PercuVision DirectVisionÂ® System device .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Routine placement transurethral catheter challenge situation , urethral stricture , severe phimosis false passage . Intravaginal retraction urethral meatus complicate Foley placement postmenopausal female . In men , blind urethral procedure mechanical metal sound without visual guidance guidewire assistance discourage due increase risk urethral trauma false passage . DirectVision new visually-guided catheterization device ( VGCD ) use camera visual guide / microendoscope within triple lumen flexible urinary catheter angle tip , essentially combine functionality urinary catheter cystoscope . DirectVision use fiber-optic bundle 6,000 integrated fiber provide illumination transmit real-time video . Procedures do via flexible cystoscopy DirectVision cover insurance ( include Medicaid/Medicare ) . In prospective study , investigator plan assess effectiveness ease use DirectVision - A direct visualization system urinary catheterization .</detailed_description>
