	<brief_summary>The purpose study ass potential use delta-inulin adjuvant facilitate desire immune response Jack Jumper Ant ( JJA ) venom low dose venom , thus reduce adverse reaction , venom requirement cost treatment . Specifically aim compare outcomes in-hospital JJA sting challenge JJA venom specific IgE , IgG4 responses semi-rush JJA VIT maintenance dose 25 50 mcg JJA venom , without delta-inulin adjuvant .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Background JJA sting appear dominant cause insect sting anaphylaxis cooler area southern eastern Australia native ant prevalent . Immunotherapy treatment sting insect anaphylaxis involve administration increase dos purify insect venom aim induce clinical tolerance , also carry risk allergic reaction treatment . In randomised double-blinded , placebo-controlled trial JJA VIT7 show JJA VIT highly effective prevent JJA sting anaphylaxis , objective systemic sting reaction rate maintenance JJA VIT &lt; 5 % vs 70 % receive placebo VIT . Real world experience Tasmania support finding objective systemic reaction rate sting challenge 50 100 mcg maintenance dos respectively 14/130 12/126 subject reaction rate sting similar subject without JJA VIT 70-76 % trial epidemiological study . Although JJA VIT highly effective prevent severe objective reaction JJA sting , applicability limit ( 1 ) venom availability venom collect venom sac dissection ant harvest wild nest inherent WH &amp; S risk ; ( 2 ) venom cost , $ 2 per microgram venom ( 3 ) honey bee VIT difficulty significant minority subject achieve maintenance immediate generalise allergic reaction ( 4 ) prolong therapy , generally 5 year longer - previous sting reaction immediately life-threatening , treatment continue indefinitely long risk accidental sting remain . An adjuvant would facilitate want immune response JJA venom potential reduce venom requirement thereby reduce cost increase availability JJA VIT , reduce number hospital visit require protective response achieve low dos venom and/or early therapy , reduce number systemic allergic reaction JJA VIT . Inulin natural storage polysaccharide plant . It approve around world intravenous human use renal function study generally regard safe . Inulin exist different polymorphic form , water suspension inulin particle delta polymorphic form potent adjuvant preferentially induce IgG4 without toxicity exhibit adjuvant without increase IgE production occur traditional aluminum-based adjuvant . This effect particularly important one function VIT reduce IgE increase IgG4 , make inulin ideal candidate vaccine adjuvant test combination VIT . A cGMP product delta-inulin adjuvant ( Advaxâ„¢ ) supply Australia Vaxine Pty Ltd ( Flinders Medical Centre , Bedford Park , SA 5042 ) suitable human use . Delta-inulin adjuvant ( Advax ) successfully test adult human subject combination antigen Hepatitis B virus surface antigen influenza haemagglutinin , excellent safety record evidence antigen dose-sparing , great sero-protection few systemic adverse effect . In recently complete RAH-FMC trial honey bee venom immunotherapy without delta inulin addition adjuvant delta-inulin honey bee venom vaccine show another study promote good immune response standard venom preparation . Study design The aim propose study compare responses in-hospital sting challenge JJA venom specific lgE IgG4 responses semi-rush JJA VIT dose 25 50 mcg JJA venom , without delta-inulin adjuvant ( Advax ) . Subjects randomise , ten arm , receive semi-rush JJA VIT without delta-inulin ( fix dose 5 mg dose venom ) aim achieve maintenance dose JJA venom 25 50 mcg . The study subject observer blind difficult mask attend nursing staff turbid appearance delta-inulin containing vaccine judge unsafe use opaque syrinx . Furthermore , appropriate use placebo mimic cloudy appearance venom vaccine contain delta-inulin without first perform trial placebo ensure either positively negatively influence effect venom extract . In previous study 256 sting challenge perform 12 month JJA VIT , 50 mcg 100 mcg JJA venom appear similar efficacy maintenance dos . In attempt give participant real possibility medium term protection , study schedule design , effect twelve month maintenance injection assess sting challenge , subject 25 mcg maintenance dose arm give suboptimal response comparison standard 50 mcg dose group offer conversion 50 mcg maintenance . Selection subject Subjects study recruit Royal Adelaide Royal Hobart Hospitals . We plan recruit total 40 patient study , half ( i.e . 20 subject ) recruit Royal Adelaide Hospital . As Phase 1/2 study , formal sample size estimation normally require . The sample 20 patient delta-inulin adjuvant preparation 20 control subject receive standard venom therapy without adjuvant chosen order provide adequate evaluation study endpoint . Randomisation Participants randomise equal proportion receive top study dose 25 50 mcg JJA venom without 5 mg delta-inulin adjuvant , four ( 4 ) study group ten ( 10 ) subject . Randomisation perform real time , calls/emails regard allocation log ensure adherence allocation . Given small patient number , use randomisation table . Patients also stratify site , target 20 case site . Treatment give establish semi-rush regimen adapt different target maintenance dos . Following group modify dos continue designate maintenance dose monthly 12 month maintenance VIT . Study measurements 1 . Adverse event venom immunotherapy . Severe ( hypersensitivity non-hypersensitivity ) reaction JJA VIT , death unexpected hospital admission require immediate notification Data Safety Monitor independent investigator . 2 . Laboratory study 1 . Safety test : At entry , achieve maintenance clinically indicate . Full Blood Examination ( FBE ) , C-reactive Protein ( CRP ) , Urea Electrolyte ( U &amp; E ) , Liver Function Test ( LFT ) , Mast Cell Tryptase ( MCT ) 2 . Markers venom delta-inulin immunogenicity desensitisation : Sera determination specific IgE IgG4 JJA venom use ImmunoCAP assay take baseline , attendance reach maintenance VIT , attendance 4th injection maintenance dose ; 12 month . Venom skin testing ( VST ) perform timepoints . 3 . JJA in-hospital sting challenge - perform 12 month tolerate 1-month maintenance interval , one month last dose .</detailed_description>
