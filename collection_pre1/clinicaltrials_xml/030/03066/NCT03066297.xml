	<brief_title>Optimal Extent Pulmonary Resection Clinical Stage IA Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>1 . Background - The standard extent pulmonary resection non-small cell lung cancer ( NSCLC ) still lobectomy . However , recent advance image technology stag modality widespread use compute tomography ( CT ) screen greatly increase probability detect small-sized tumor , especially ground-glass opacity ( GGO ) feature . Adenocarcinoma GGO feature generally good prognosis due minimally invasive nature . Many study show pathologically less invasive subtypes associate well prognosis compare subtypes acinar , papillary , micropapillary , solid predominant invasive adenocarcinoma . - This recent change disease pattern NSCLC locally advance solid tumor early less invasive tumor GGO feature lead resurgence interest sublobar resection . Several retrospective study conduct compare early late outcome include long-term survival patient underwent lobectomy underwent sublobar resection . - Multiple report suggest small-sized peripheral lung adenocarcinoma treat sublobar resection , yield survival rate similar lobectomy . Lobectomy consider much less invasive tumor sublobar resection would sufficient tumor . If sublobar resection equivalent lobectomy term oncologic efficacy surgical treatment NSCLC , potential benefit sublobar resection include ( 1 ) preservation vital lung parenchyma pulmonary function , may lead improve early morbidity mortality late quality life ( 2 ) chance second resection subsequent primary NSCLC . - However , consider publish evidence sublobar resection , interpretation need cautious . Since study non-randomized , may also selection bias term preoperative patient risk factor ( intentional vs. compromise sublobar resection ) , tumor various histological subtypes different tumor size study arm . Therefore , result two randomized trial lobectomy versus sublobar resection small-sized lung cancer currently ongoing Japan ( Japan Clinical Oncology Group [ 0802 ] ) United States ( Cancer Leukemia Group B [ 140503 ] ) need await . - Based clinical circumstance publish evidence , investigator develop decision-making algorithm regard surgical treatment clinical stage IA NSCLC . 2 . Hypothesis The investigator hypothesize selection surgical procedure accord pre-defined institutional decision-making algorithm compromise treatment outcomes include overall survival disease-free survival patient clinical stage IA non-small cell lung cancer . 3 . Purpose The purpose study determine outcome participant clinical stage IA NSCLC treat 3 type surgical resection ( wide wedge resection , segmentectomy , lobectomy ) accord institutional decision-making algorithm 4 . Study plan The investigator plan enroll 1,000 participant meet pre-defined eligibility criterion 5 year .</detailed_description>
