	<brief_title>Overactive Bladder Posterior Tibial Implantable MIcro STimulator - 1</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Generally , subject follow 1 , 2 , 3 , 4 , 6 , 9 12-months activation RENOVA System . The study conduct accord follow phase : - Recruitment , baseline assessment compatibility test : Subjects fulfil inclusion none exclusion criterion enrol trial . Study candidate sign inform consent form , complete standard 3-Day voiding diary , quality life questionnaire global response assessment . Beck Depression Inventory II General quality life questionnaire complete selected geography . Study eligible subject experience Posterior Tibial Nerve Stimulation treatment past undergo compatibility test assure proper nerve conductivity . Data collect serve baseline . - Implantation : Patients positive response compatibility test ( receive Posterior Tibial Nerve Stimulation treatment past ) undergo unilateral implantation 4±1 week follow recruitment BlueWind RENOVA System . Intra-operative sensory/motor response test confirm accurate location implant . - Sensation assessment activation : After recovery period approximately 30±7 day , subject complete Brief 3-Day voiding diary quality life questionnaire sensation assessment conduct : subject undergo acute stimulation session tibial nerve evaluate sensory reaction stimulation parameter set perform accord individual sensation . Eventually , patient train system home use treatment . Therapy deliver daily minimum 30 minute day maximum 1 hour per day ( 2 session 30 minute ) , per physician discretion . Following activation device , patient complete Brief 3-day voiding diary week 1 month follow-up visit . - Follow-ups ( 1- , 2- , 3-months post-device activation ) : A 3-Day voiding diary QoL questionnaire collect ( brief 3-Day diary 1- , 2-months follow visit ; 3-Day standard void diary 3-month follow ) . Global Response Assessment Beck Depression Inventory II collect 3-month follow-up visit ( Beck Depression Inventory select geography ) . Stimulation parameter check adjust need : ( ) change current amplitude ; and/or ( b ) change stimulation frequency ; and/or change pulse width ; and/or ( c ) change number daily treatment session . Location paresthesia record clinic visit . The visit 2 month perform phone call ass patient status . Clinic visit may follow discretion clinical team . - Continued follow-up : All subject trial undergo 4 additional visit ( 4- , 6- ,9- 12-months post-device activation ) end study 12-month visit . Similar visit 2 month , visit 4 month perform phone call ass patient status . Clinic visit may follow discretion clinical team . Three-Day voiding diary , Quality Life questionnaire , Global Response Assessment Beck Depression Inventory II General quality life questionnaire ( select geography ) collect visit ( except 4- 9-months visit 3-Day Brief void diary collect ) . General quality life questionnaire complete 12-month visit select geography . Stimulation parameter check adjust need . Location paresthesia record clinic visit</detailed_description>
