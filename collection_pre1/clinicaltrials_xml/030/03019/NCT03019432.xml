	<detailed_description>Postural control emerge interaction task , environment individual . Within individual , efficient interaction motor , sensory neural system need order maintain postural control . ( 1 ) One neural process integration afferent information visual , vestibular somatosensory input construct body-centred frame reference gravitational environment . ( 2 ) This frame reference must vertically align gravitational vector ensure axial extension body keep centre gravity within base support . Each sensory modality relative load contribution estimation verticality depend task environment . ( 3 ) In healthy subject , certain modality absent information seem bias e.g . walk complete darkness , weight give sensory input source . ( 1 ) This reweighting sensory information therefore key postural response human . However , sensory reweighting always adequate certain modality bias . In verticality perception , roll tilt head less 60°-70° , contralateral deviation subjective vertical report . ( 4 ) This call E-effect observe Subjective Visual Vertical test ( SVV ) Subjective Postural Vertical test ( SPV ) . ( 5 , 6 ) Furthermore , study show also somatosensory loss negative impact perceive verticality patient stroke . ( 7 ) In opinion , less afferent input source present , adequate estimation earth vertical difficult . Since , study show verticality perception highly related postural control ( 8 , 9 ) , major importance . In neurological condition stroke sensory input source often affect , lead few option sensory reweighting strategy . ( 10 ) In study , researcher explore verticality perception sensory reweighting strategy stroke subject . At first , researcher investigate whether E-effect also occur sample stroke subject . Secondly , investigate effect somatosensory loss extent E-effect . It hypothesize patient sensory loss , secondary afferent input available improve estimation vertical therefore less misleading head-on-body tilt . Patients method Study design A cohort study design investigate whether E-effect occurs people stroke . In addition , effect somatosensory loss extent E-effect investigate provide insight sensory reweighting strategy . Ethical approval give ethical committee registration number B300201630358 accordance Declaration Helsinki 1975 , revise Hong Kong 1989 Patients Patients recruit stroke population rehabilitation hospital Revarte , Antwerp , Belgium . All patient history first stroke attend rehabilitation program eligible inclusion . Patients age 80 ; neurological orthopaedic impairment well brainstem , cerebellar multiple lesion exclude . Only stroke ischemic hemorrhagic etiology include . Patients also exclude subject pre-existing co-morbid condition may affect vision somatosensory function . In addition , patient visuospatial neglect pusher behaviour also exclude affect verticality perception . This examined neuropsychologist use Scale Contraversive Pushing ( SCP ) ( 11 ) . In addition , patient perform assessment within three month post-stroke . Prior inclusion , participant ask whether understand instruction test sign write informed consent . Outcome measure Rivermead assessment somatosensory Performance The Rivermead Assessment Somatosensory Performance ( RASP ) measure different somatosensory modality face , hand foot note reliable standardized assessment . Six test administer ten ( five leave five right ) test region face ; hand foot , two test administer face palm hand . During test eye participant close . These eight test divide six primary two secondary test sensation . Six trial execute ten test region , two test sham trial give . Sham trial increase patient 's internal reliability . Patients exclude statistical analysis five false positive reply , suggest Winward et al . ( 12 ) Subjective Visual Vertical ( SVV ) The Difra Vertitest type D107201 ( Difra , Welkenraedt , Belgium ) use SVV assessment . The device accuracy 0.1° . A laser bar project distance 2.5m oppose wall altitude 1.5m . The patient seat front device chair without arm- backrest . Patients adequate sit balance assess seated wheelchair . The room darken five minute wait period give allow subject adjust darkness . Both researcher participant obtain remote allow rotate laser bar either clockwise ( right ) counter clockwise ( leave ) . The researcher 's remote show display amount deviation relation earth 's gravitational vector . The researcher make laser bar invisible rotate specific angle relation earth vertical . Subsequently , line show patient place line upright position nonhemiplegic hand remote control . The amount deviation start roll position different trial . A specified order follow : first line place 20° counter clockwise , 10° clockwise , 5° counter clockwise 0° accord earth vertical , follow 5° clockwise , 10° counter clockwise finally 20° clockwise . This series execute three time . During first series patient ask hold head normal upright position , follow series head tilt leave ( head bent subject need keep trunk upright ) finally series head tilt right side . The clockwise rotation show positively counter clockwise negatively . The patient receive feedback performance assessment . Subjective Postural Vertical ( SPV ) The rotation chair work hydraulic pump height 1m . On back chair , Mitutoyo digital protractor pro 3600 ( Belgium ) mount . This allowed measurement deviation relation earth vertical accuracy 0.01° . Both researcher patient give remote rotate chair clockwise ( right ) counter clockwise ( leave ) . Movements restrict frontal plane . Before assessment start patient blindfold , deprive subject visual information readjust chair earth vertical . The researcher rotate chair procedure SVV ( start roll position chair ) . The head-on-body position similar SVV procedure . The subject place chair upright position place seat surface chair horizontal . The patient use non-hemiplegic hand remote control . The clockwise rotation show positively counter clockwise rotation negatively .</detailed_description>
