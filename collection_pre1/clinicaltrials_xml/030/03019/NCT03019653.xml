	<detailed_description>Subjects choice admit night prior renal clearance study day day . Subjects admit ( fast ) Clinical Research Trials Unit , 3 week diet compliance , morning first renal clearance study day . They avoid take sulfa contain medication Probenecid 72 hour prior Visit Two Visit Three . They complete 24-hour urine collection assess creatinine clearance , microalbumin sodium concentration excretion . A pregnancy test perform , necessary . Their first urine void admit collect protein analysis . Brief physical exam ( Visit 1 ) perform qualified Study Team Member . Their usual morning dose medication hold give initial water load prior start renal clearance infusion . Echocardiogram determine systolic , diastolic function cardiac output perform prior start study drug infusion . A bladder ultrasound perform first void . If subject unable sufficiently empty bladder , urinary catheter place permission . The subject place supine position 1 hour . During first 15 minute , two standard intravenous ( IV ) catheter place ( one arm ) . One catheter use infusion ( contralateral arm ) blood sample . Subjects ask drink 5 mL/Kg water initially drink amount equal urine output , blood drawn , clearance period ensure sufficient urinary flow . A priming dose ( calculated accord body size ) iothalamate ( 0.06 mg/Kg ) measure glomerular filtration rate ( GFR ) infuse , follow constant rate IV sustain dose ( calculated accord estimate kidney function ) iothalamate achieve steady-state plasma concentration 15 20 mg/L . The subject ask empty bladder spontaneously end clearance period . After equilibration period 45 minute , urine blood sample collect 30-minutes determine baseline GFR urinary sodium excretion ( UNaV ) . Blood pressure measure 20-minute interval first 2 hour , every 30 minute , use automatic blood pressure cuff . Heart rate continuously monitor electrocardiography . Urinary sample determination volume , sodium , potassium , iothalamate obtain end clearance period . Venous blood sample iothalamate sodium obtain middle clearance period . During first clearance , venous blood sample renin , aldosterone , angiotensin II , AnxA1 , Atrial Natriuretic Peptide ( ANP ) , Brain natriuretic peptide ( BNP ) cGMP obtain urine sample Annexin A1 ( AnxA1 ) cyclic guanosine monophosphate ( cGMP ) also obtain . Buffy coat Ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid ( EDTA ) vacutainer tube save possible future DNA analysis . After baseline renal clearance , subject randomize receive infusion active study drug placebo 8 hour . The research pharmacist prepare study drug placebo infusion , thus patient investigator blind . Renal clearance blood draw carry every 2 hour infusion describe ( 4 time ) , blood draw assay end 4 8 hour infusion list . Another echocardiogram repeat 4 hour drug infusion . Subjects give 3 meal throughout day . Dismissal occur one hour post-infusion monitoring .</detailed_description>
