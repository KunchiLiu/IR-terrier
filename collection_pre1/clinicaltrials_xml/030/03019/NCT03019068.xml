	<brief_summary>This retrospective study aim assess , large number clinical trial ( CT ) , usefulness convert CT eligibility criterion standardize query perform commonly available data , i.e . Diagnosis Related Groups ( DRG ) databases order estimate potential recruitment clinical trial center . Efficacy Clinical Trial Recruitment Support Systems ( CTRSS ) check thorough examination patient file . Primary objective estimate precision prediction system , i.e . ratio number eligible patient file / number candidate patient file . As secondary objective , study aim : - measure recall rate sensitivity system : ratio number candidate patient file / number recruit patient ; - measure ability coding : proportion codable criterion ( inclusion criterion non inclusion criterion ) normalized language ; - measure time require cod criteria time require execute query national DRG database ; - evaluate reliability cod process independent cod random sample 30 protocol ; - analyse influence characteristic clinical study ( design , disease , ... ) investigation site ( volume , teach status , ... ) precision sensitivity prediction system .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The study perform large sample ( near 100 ) multicenter terminate clinical study public funding cover therapeutic , diagnostic prognostic study . Selection ( inclusion , non inclusion ) criterion CT translate normalized description use ICD10 french nomenclature medical surgical procedure ( CCAM , Classification Commune des Actes Médicaux ) , nomenclature use french DRG system . Then dedicated program query French DRG national database call PMSI ( Programme de Médicalisation de Systèmes d'Information ) . For CT center , query select `` candidate '' patient whose eligibility check thorough examination whole patient file dedicate data extractor . In addition , already recruit patient compare prediction system . Collected data span period 2010 2014 , well medical file .</detailed_description>
