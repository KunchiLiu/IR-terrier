	<brief_title>Augmented Interoceptive Exposure Training Anorexia Nervosa</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Individuals anorexia nervosa ( AN ) afraid eat . Moreover , anxiety prominent symptom AN , anxiety disorder frequently precede and/or co-occurring illness , increase prevalence anxiety disorder first-degree family member . Pre-meal anxiety pose frequent challenge treatment setting require adherence strict meal plan , particularly since associate low caloric intake . While problematic current treatment setting , illness characteristic also provide potentially important therapeutic target . Unfortunately , straightforward pre-meal treatment typically effective anxiolytic medicine alprazolam ineffective individual AN , increase caloric intake . By contrast , cognitive behavioral therapy anorexia nervosa utilizing exposure therapy , effective psychological intervention anxiety anxiety disorder , promote food intake increase weight AN . However , treatment slow less ideal response rate , suggest could benefit optimization . Exposure therapy involve help patient voluntarily engage repeat sometimes prolonged confrontation stimulus disproportionately provoke individual 's fear . The aim practice facilitate development tolerance reduction anxiety/fear response become conditionally associated relevant stimulus , thereby demonstrate patient learn manage effectively face anxiety . In case anorexia nervosa , repeat presentation food food cue ( mental imagery , picture , smell ) elicit distress facilitates subsequent development tolerance symptom . Unfortunately , effect size intervention AN relatively small . Here , researcher investigate whether use acute pharmacological intervention context aversive learn enhance exposure training reduce anxiety associate eating individual anorexia nervosa .</detailed_description>
