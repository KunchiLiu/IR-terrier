	<detailed_description>The percentage people age &gt; 65 United Kingdom increase 15 % 1985 17 % 2010 , increase 1.7 million people . One age-associated physiological change reduction vascular function observe , level large artery muscle microvasculature . In vascular dysfunction associate reduced aerobic performance . Cardiorespiratory fitness ( marked aerobic performance ) show independent predictor postoperative mortality , provide accurate prognostic information age alone . In contrast , physical activity reverse element pathophysiology associate condition , include vascular dysfunction . Nonetheless , major roadblock exercise strategy combat age-associated vascular dysfunction associate condition exist , namely : ) poor exercise tolerance , ii ) `` lack time '' , iii ) age-related mobility impairment , iv ) exercise resistance . The aim study investigate whether novel low-volume , time-efficient training strategy improve index vascular health cardiorespiratory performance old individual view towards improve fitness surgery . Numerous study demonstrate period supervise exercise training effectively improve index cardiorespiratory ( blood pressure , aerobic capacity blood lipid vascular function . However , majority study conduct use high-volume continuous submaximal aerobic training ( e.g . 50-65 % VO2max 30-60 min ) moderate high volume progressive weight training . This research group recently show efficacy time-efficient exercise strategy know HIIT - High Intensity Interval Training , improve VO2 max muscle mass young individual heighten metabolic disease risk also demonstrate significant improvement VO2 max comparable classic aerobic exercise training use several different time-efficient HIIT protocol . However , despite potential benefit HIIT , least 70-80 % reduction require time-commitment compare current WHO guideline , limitation , particularly old population physical ( mobility/joint ) and/or socio-economic ( transport/gym access/equipment purchase ) barrier may render ineffective and/or unachievable . Alternative intervention prevention treatment age-associated vascular dysfunction could provide isometric handgrip training ( IHG ) remote ischaemic pre-conditioning ( RIPC ) , similar low time-commitment compare HIIT less strenuous , potential home-based intervention , require inexpensive equipment . IHG demonstrate improve rest blood pressure normotensive medicate hypertensive population similar great extent classic aerobic exercise training . However , effect IHG vascular ( e.g . limb , brain muscle microvascular blood flow ) cardio-respiratory parameter ( VO2 max , heart rate ( resting/recovery ) , exercise tolerance ) assess . Similarly , although RIPC recently show improve maximal athletic cardio-respiratory performance vascular function young subject , work date explore efficacy chronic RIPC indices health vascular function old individual . Therefore , aim project : ( ) Assess efficacy 6 week HIT , IHG RIPC improve index cardio-respiratory , vascular ( brain , limb muscle ) metabolic function old subject mean improve fitness surgery . ( ii ) Explore concept `` exercise resistance '' relation HIT , IHG RIPC : 1 . Assessing degree response heterogeneity exist three time-efficient train mode employ study report classic resistance aerobic exercise training 2 . Assessing `` non-responder '' one index ( i.e. , rest blood pressure leg blood flow ) non-responder index</detailed_description>
