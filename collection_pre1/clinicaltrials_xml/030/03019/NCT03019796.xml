	<brief_title>Exercise Training Effects Metabolic Syndrome : Interactions With Medication</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Objective : The purpose study group adult metabolic syndrome obesity , effect different modality exercise train cardiorespiratory metabolic fitness . The main objective weight effect exercise train separately conjunction habitual pharmacological treatment identify best combination drug exercise . Methods design : Randomized , pretest-posttest control group experimental design . Project develop single center collaboration regional public health system . Subjects : Will refer primary care physician study unit . Up 160 subject metabolic syndrome recruit ( 20 % woman ) . Measurements : 1 . Specifically study cardiovascular adaptation increase , ) maximal aerobic capacity measure VO2max , ii ) anaerobic respiratory compensation point ventilatory threshold , iii ) cardiac function measure assess cardiac output stroke volume use re-breathing technique , iv ) arterial stiffness , measure pulse wave velocity augmentation index use applanation tonometry ( SphygmoCor System ) , v ) central peripheral blood pressure , vi ) biological marker endothelial dysfunction use reactive hyperemia laser Doppler fluxmeter central peripheral blood vessel . 2 . The metabolic adaptation study include , ) insulin resistance measure IVGTT , ii ) fat oxidation indirect calorimetry , iii ) intramuscular protein involve energetics percutaneous muscle biopsy western blot , iv ) mitochondrion biogenesis activity citrate synthase v ) stable-isotopic study glucose free fatty acid kinetics blood ( use gas-chromatography mass-spectrometry analysis ) .</detailed_description>
