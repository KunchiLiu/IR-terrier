	<brief_summary>AML/MDS treatment may weaken participant 's immune system may make participant likely develop invasive fungal infection ( IFIs ) . The goal clinical research study learn isavuconazole help prevent invasive aspergillosis ( IA ) IFIs patient AML/MDS . The safety drug also study .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Study Isavuconazole Prophylaxis Adults With Acute Myeloid Leukemia/Myelodysplastic Syndrome ( AML/MDS ) Neutropenia</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Study Drug Administration : If participant find eligible take part study , participant take isavuconazole mouth every 8 hour first 6 dos ( 48 hour ) 1 time day . The capsule swallow whole . Participants chew , crush , dissolve , open capsule . If start study participant unable take participant 's dose mouth , participant receive study drug vein 1 hour every 8 hour first 6 dos 1 time day 4 day . If brief period participant unable take dose mouth , participant receive isavuconazole vein 1 hour . Participant switch back take dose mouth soon participant able . Participant give study drug diary keep track dose study drug participant take , time dose take , miss vomited dos . Participant bring study drug diary participant every visit . Length Study : Participant may continue take study drug 12 week . Participant longer able take study drug disease get bad , participant complete remission disease ( disease go away ) , breakthrough fungal infection occur , intolerable side effect occur , participant unable follow study direction . Participation study End-of-Study Visit . Study Visits : Every week : - Blood ( 2-3 teaspoon ) draw routine test 1-2 time week . - Blood ( 2-3 teaspoon time ) drawn twice week check fungal infection . During Weeks 1 , 4 , 7 , 10 , participant physical exam . On Days 8 15 , blood ( 1 teaspoon ) drawn pharmacokinetic ( PK ) test . PK test measure amount study drug body different time point . On Day 10 , participant EKG . During Week 2 every week ( Weeks 4 , 6 , 8 , ) , blood ( 1 teaspoon ) drawn measure iron store participant 's body . If time doctor think need : - Participant chest x-ray CT scan check fungal infection participant 's lung . - Blood ( 2-3 teaspoon ) draw check fungal infection . - If participant bone marrow test do check status leukemia part participant 's standard care , check iron content . End Study : About 30 day last dose study drug : - Participant physical exam . - Blood ( 2-3 teaspoon ) draw routine test . This investigational study . Isavuconazole FDA commercially available treatment IA mucormycosis . It consider investigational use isavuconazole prevention IFIs . The study doctor explain study drug design work . Up 100 participant enrol study . All take part MD Anderson .</detailed_description>
