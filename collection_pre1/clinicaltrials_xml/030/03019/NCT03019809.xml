	<brief_title>A Trial Plerixafor/G-CSF Additional Agents Conditioning Before TCR Alpha/Beta Depleted HSCT WAS Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Severe graft dysfunction , degree donor chimerism predominantly myeloid compartment one major problem patient Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome ( WAS ) , especially hematopoietic stem cell transplantation ( HSCT ) alternative donor . It often lead development severe thrombocytopenia even transplant rejection . In study hypothesis use plerixafor G-CSF additional agent condition regimen would offer advantage due low risk mixed chimerism HSCT . This effect base fact simultaneous use plerixafor G-CSF efficient induce stem cell release open bone marrow ( BM ) niche . Moreover , stem cell release probably lead liberation host stem cell anti-apoptotic effect BM stroma powerful effect chemotherapy . In study , investigator use TCR alpha/beta graft depletion graft basic technology HSCT haploidentical unrelated donor approve Institution . Thus , purpose study evaluate safety efficiency myeloablative conditioning Plerixafor G-CSF additional agent prevention graft failure transplantation TCR alpha/beta graft depletion patient Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome .</detailed_description>
