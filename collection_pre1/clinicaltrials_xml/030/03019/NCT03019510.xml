	<brief_summary>Morning hyperglycemia play role future development insulin resistance type 2 diabetes ( T2D ) ( 8 ) associate numerous microvascular cardiovascular complication renal disease . These augment morning glucose level due elevate endogenous glucose production ( EGP ) , result loss coordination glucose level insulin secretion , possibly hyperglucagonemia overnight period . Exercise stimulate glucose uptake increase insulin sensitivity acutely , may best lifestyle intervention minimize nocturnal rise glucose level . Prescription time exercise relative meal and/or overnight period may particularly critical individual impair fast glucose ( IFG ) level . Surprisingly little known overnight period elevate EGP synchrony glucose c-peptide/glucagon level become disturbed . This novel study provide insight hormonal/metabolic milieu dinner meal , even overnight period occur non-obese , OB OB+IFG individual ; also establish time exercise attenuate nocturnal glucose elevation , associate improved hormonal synchrony . This project compare EGP , β-cell function hormonal response morning evening exercise postprandial overnight period obese individual with/without IFG level . Fifty-four subject study even meal ( EGP β-cell function ) , postprandially overnight period ( 1600-0700 h ) , allow u examine potential mechanism elevation overnight glucose level . This first study examine issue pre-dinner night previous study examine chronically fast individual study lay groundwork understand pathology predawn phenomenon OB+IFG individual . These potentially translational finding may impact efficiency physician communication patient concern exercise . These investigator one group study subject overnight period facility capability research .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>In individual type 2 diabetes ( T2D ) , chronically elevate glucose insulin level result numerous health complication . Maintaining tight glucose control difficult individual T2D , particularly postprandial period morning period prior wake . In postprandial period , combine effect insulin resistance beta cell dysfunction result prolong elevation glucose level , augment insulin level attempt reduce circulate glucose level . In overnight period , evidence enhance endogenous glucose production disruption interaction glucose level insulin secretion . Early work individual T2D demonstrate continued fasting , glucose level stop decline even subsequently rise throughout night reach morning maximum , elevation persist till noon . Additionally author demonstrate insulin level insulin secretion rate parallel nocturnal glucose change individual T2D , control nocturnal glucose insulin secretion rate coincide . Evidence also emerge hyperglucagonemia may occur set deficient insulin secretion , may play role elevate postprandial glucose level overnight period . These study provide preliminary evidence disruption fine coordination glucose level glucagon insulin secretion , exacerbate overnight period waking hour . Previous study examine overnight period conduct follow prolonged fasting ( ~24-34 h ) , however , people fast extend period time prior go bed . Additionally , individual T2D often know meal composition even prior exacerbate elevate fast glucose level follow morning , thus highlight need examine effect meal composition overnight glucose control . To date , little known pathology fast glucose level elevate many obese individual . There appear asynchrony glucose insulin level overnight period little research focus phenomenon meal composition affect overnight glucose level . This study provide evidence potential mechanism elevation overnight glucose level finding translatable individual impair fast glucose ( IFG ) level understand importance meal composition even period . The specific aim project : 1 . To examine hormonal response ( glucagon , c-peptide , insulin , incretins ) response meal postprandial period synchronization glucose insulin/glucagon overnight period non-obese individual obese individual impair fast glucose level ( IFG ) . 2 . To determine meal composition ( standard meal : 55 % carbohydrate , 20 % protein , 25 % fat vs. high fat/fructose : 40 % carbohydrate- 25 % fructose , 40 % fat , 20 % protein ) alter hormonal response ( glucagon , insulin , incretin ) postprandial period , change meal composition impact glucagon level glucose/c-peptide synchrony overnight period . Experimental design : Subjects participate three time ; 1 ) exercise , 2 ) 2 hr post dinner exercise , 3 ) morning exercise ( ~7am ) . The order subject undergo treatment randomize prior study enrollment . Eligible subject initially undergo baseline test assessment body composition , exercise stress test blood screening . All subject impair fast glucose level . All subject undergo 3 study day start ~1600 h continue 0700 h follow morning . They receive standard meal ( 55 % carbohydrate , 20 % protein , 25 % fat ) 1800 h blood sample take ~4:30 pm 7 .</detailed_description>
