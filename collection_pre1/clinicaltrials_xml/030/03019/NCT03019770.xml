	<detailed_description>The purpose study assess clinical Decision Aid ( DA ) integrate decision-support tool patient risk-prediction tool provider facilitate share decision making ( SDM ) reduce decisional conflict regard pre-exposure prophylaxis ( PrEP ) use . The patient tool develop iterative process use Ottawa Decision Support Framework ( ODSF ) . The provider tool validate model us patient-reported data estimate HIV risk individual men sex men ( MSM ) . The DA include information harm associate HIV , list treatment option , include nothing , patient 's individualized risk acquire HIV , positive negative feature PrEP , exercise clarify patient value , interactive exercise help patient weight risk benefit PrEP use . The Health Communications Core Dana-Farber Cancer Center , Core receive NIH fund provide web-design service Harvard-affiliated investigator , build web-based version Decision Aid investigator 's direction , investigator learn qualitative research patient provider would prefer web-based version . Presentation DA 's content do manner enhance comprehension minimize bias . The DA test 20 patient-provider dyad determine acceptability , additional 60 provider-dyad visit conduct . The study involve Boston-area MSM primary care provider Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center ( BIDMC ) Fenway Health . The investigator believe important capture perspective clinicians Fenway ( specialize care sexual gender minority ) , BIDMC ( large , academic medical center ) , well practice clinical site community may less knowledgeable experienced PrEP . To pilot test DA , MSM-provider dyad schedule simulate 20 minute clinic visit BIDMC Fenway Health . Providers complete verbal consent procedure prior visit . Providers email Decision Aid review , well pre-study questionnaire complete time.MSM arrive 60 minute visit . At time , MSM participant complete informed consent procedure follow brief demographic behavioral survey . The survey administer use either pen paper web-based format . This survey review study staff member confirm eligibility . MSM Participants opportunity view DA meeting provider . Using computer touch screen tablet , participant provider complete DA , online , enter patient-reported data need risk-prediction tool . The website store answer question DA . The question use obtain sensitive data present culturally-sensitive manner . Both MSM participant provider able explore DA website , include information HIV , PrEP next step provider interested prescribe PrEP . After visit , MSM providers complete acceptability survey brief exit interview member study staff . Acceptability pre-specified &gt; 70 % participant provider indicate DA acceptable use . Based survey feedback , investigator refine DA , website content , visit process preparation test additional 60 dyad . If MSM participant interest learn study , staff provide instruction access information PrEP Fenway Institute 's website . If participant would also like speak healthcare professional obtain prescription PrEP , study staff recommend schedule visit provider Fenway Health BIDMC Infectious Disease clinic . Once acceptability establish , additional 60 MSM-provider dyad schedule either simulated in-clinic 20 minute visit BIDMC Fenway Health , depend availability provider clinic hour . These visit follow protocol pilot test visit , possible adjustment make base pilot test feedback . In addition initial study visit , 3 month follow survey provide MSM participant . This survey available online RedCap , link complete survey email MSM participant . Alternatively , participant complete survey person phone accord preference . Assuming standard deviation 12 pre- post-DA primary outcome measure Decisional Conflict Scale score , null hypothesis difference pair pre- post-DA , 2-sided significance level 0.05 , correlation 0.23 pre- post-DA score , adjust sample size non-parametric test ( use bad case 86.5 % efficiency ) case non-normal data , sample size 60 MSM ( pair evaluation pre- post-DA ) provide approximately 80 % power detect difference pre- post-DA score 6 ( ~1/2 SD ) . Acceptability survey analyze descriptive statistic determine percentage participant find DA acceptable . The paired t-test ( Wilcoxon Signed Rank test data non-normal ) use determine change follow measure pre- post-use DA : ( 1 ) MSM Decisional Conflict Scale score ; ( 2 ) MSM provider knowledge ; ( 3 ) intention initiate PrEP ; ( 4 ) decisional regret ; ( 5 ) sexual risk behavior . The proportion MSM reporting HIV sexually transmit disease test 3 month prior use DA compare proportion report test 3 month use DA use pair ( 1-sample ) exact test rate/proportion null value 0 . Kruskal-Wallis test ( multi-group extension Wilcoxon Rank Sum Test ) use determine distribution post-DA Decisional Conflict Scale score differs between/among group define level adherence .</detailed_description>
