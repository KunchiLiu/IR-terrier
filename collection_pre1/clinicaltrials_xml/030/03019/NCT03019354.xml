	<brief_summary>In general anesthesia , gas exchange alter shunt uneven ventilation perfusion ratio . Lung atelectasis cause impaired oxygenation . High-flow nasal cannula oxygen therapy delivers adequately heat humidified medical gas 60 L/min flow . It physiological effect : reduction anatomical dead space , positive end expiratory pressure ( PEEP ) effect , constant fraction inspire oxygen , good humidification . The hypothesis study use high-flow nasal oxygen intravenous general anesthesia could improve lung function prevent lung atelectasis .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>The Effect Using High-flow Nasal Oxygen-delivery System Patients Under Intravenous General Anesthesia</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>After general anesthesia , almost 90 % patient lung atelectasis . The lung atelectasis persist even surgery , cause post operative complication , example : fever , pleural effusion , hypoxemia , pneumonia , respiratory failure . So , improve lung function surgery important issue . High-flow nasal cannula oxygen therapy delivers adequately heat humidified medical gas 60 L/min flow . It provide respiratory support : 1 . Reduction dead Space clearance expire air upper airway . 2 . Delivering positive airway pressure . 3. deliver optimal humidity , help maintain function mucociliary transport system , clear secretion reduce risk infection . Many report suggest high-flow nasal cannula decrease breathe frequency work breathe reduces intubation rate critical ill patient . Although high-flow nasal cannula use widely intensive care unit ( ICU ) , enough evidence patient general anesthesia . The hypothesis study use high-flow nasal oxygen intravenous general anesthesia could improve lung function prevent lung atelectasis . Liver tumor radiofrequency ablation perform sometimes patient general anesthesia . Intravenous general anesthesia one anesthesia choice . Oxygen mask traditional oxygen delivery system . Apnea , hypoxemia , CO2 retention common situation intravenous general anesthesia . So high-flow nasal oxygen ideal oxygen delivery system intravenous general anesthesia . This randomize control study enroll patient receive CT guide liver tumor radiofrequency ablation general anesthesia . One group receive high-flow nasal oxygen , group receive traditional oxygen mask . The primary outcome lung atelectasis area CT scan . The secondary outcome respiratory function ( example : arterial blood gas , lung injury biomarkers , saturation , postoperative pulmonary complication )</detailed_description>
