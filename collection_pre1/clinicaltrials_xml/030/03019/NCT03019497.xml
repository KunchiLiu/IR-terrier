	<brief_summary>The purpose study evaluate efficacy form cognitive behavioral therapy ( CBT ) population individual PTSD common relate problem ( depression , anxiety sleep disorder , pain , psychosocial stressor , low social support , substance use disorder ) . Half participant receive cognitive behavioral therapy specific module treatment relate problem ( CBT-E ) half participant receive therapy without specific module ( CBT-C ) . The main assumption participant treat CBT-E condition present low level symptom intensity PTSD high remission rate CBT-C condition post-treatment assessment . As secondary objective , analysis different parameter effectiveness two form CBT ( e.g. , average number session require reach remission , treatment strategy use ) perform .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Post-traumatic stress disorder ( PTSD ) affect nearly one ten Canadians lifetime 75 % develop least one relate problem ( i.e . depression ) . Results previous study suggest CBT offering flexible number session support common relate problem improve effectiveness CBT . However , study demonstrate superior efficacy flexible CBT compare CBT target PTSD individual PTSD common relate problem . A randomized parallel-stratified single-blind control trial use . Randomization perform www.randomized.net , comprehensive internet-based randomization service clinical trial , multiple Coordinating Center user ( role ) . A total 134 individual randomize one two therapy condition . Following initial assessment , 8 32 session psychologist offer participant upon achievement remission diagnosis PTSD . Discontinuation treatment decide collaboration participant consider basis achieve non-clinical severity level symptom PTSD PCL-5 ( i.e. , score &lt; 33 absence non-clinical level severity symptom ) . The participant re-evaluated 3 time therapy ( 1 week , 3 month 6 month post-therapy ) primary secondary measure . A 1 year post-therapy follow-up also provide primary measure . Planned analysis . The statistical analysis respect `` intent-to-treat '' principle : result randomize participant include group originally assign . The significance level fix .05 bilateral test use . With regard miss data , first type miss data determine ( e.g . miss completely randomly ) . Thereafter , multiple imputation strategy ( 3 5 imputation ) use replace data carry various analysis plan . This data replacement strategy recognize robust efficient addition resolve uncertainty due miss data . Generalized linear model use execute group comparison ( CBT-C v CBT-E ) main measurement use pre-treatment ( T0 ) result covariate . The strategy use comparison secondary variable relate problem . An analysis different parameter effectiveness two form CBT ( e.g . average number session require achieve remission , treatment strategy use ) carry . Subgroup analysis . No subgroup analysis expect . Exploratory analysis conduct determine result generalizable victim sex two major category traumatic exposure characterize sample recruit , namely violent criminal act workplace accident . Sample size calculation treatment effect . Based treatment effect size observe pilot study effect CBT-E , similar research , use GPower power calculation software , sample size require obtain statistical power .80 3 follow-up , significance level .05 bilateral test ANCOVA 53 participant per group . A sample 106 participant allow detection difference mean two group term symptoms intensity PTSD . It also adequate verify assumption objective project . Based data recent study efficacy CBT-C , literature similar therapy ( Bradley et al. , 2005 ) , attrition rate estimate 28 % participant randomize CBT-C. For CBT-E , attrition rate observe pilot project 14 % ( 3 dropout 21 participant ) . Given attrition rate , recruitment therapy achieve require statistical power calculate follow : CBT-C = 53 participant * attrition ( 28 % ) = 74 ; CBT-E = 53 participant * attrition ( 14 % ) = 60 ) . Consequently , total 134 participant randomize one two condition therapy . Selection bias : The assignment intervention make participant agree participate study . Bias statistical analysis : In order minimize bias , analysis carry single-blind manner , statistician know intervention refers code assigned database . Bias result miss data dropout : All analysis follow `` intent treat '' principle , order minimize bias stem miss data drop-outs intervention . Conducting clinical trial compare effectiveness CBT without specific module patient PTSD relate problem increase efficacy CBT , innovate delivery CBT , improve train current future clinician . The result could also encourage victim ' compensation board adjust practice thus improve health beneficiary .</detailed_description>
