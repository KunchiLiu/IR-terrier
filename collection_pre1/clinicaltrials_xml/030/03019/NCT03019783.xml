	<brief_title>Atazanavir Endothelial Function Older HIV Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The mortality induce HIV drop significantly due effective antiretroviral therapy . Epidemiological data suggest less 5 % 10-year mortality patient treat HAART . As result reduction early AIDS-related death , HIV become chronic disease manifest common component chronic disease inflammation , vascular dysfunction , oxidative stress . The combination trend put HIV patient increase risk myocardial infarction compare age-matched subject long term . Several study suggest protease inhibitor might increase risk myocardial infarction . The lead theory behind association derives relationship protease inhibitor use onset atherogenic dysmetabolism include development insulin resistance , dyslipidemia , oxidative stress . In contrast older protease inhibitor , atazanavir induces neither insulin resistance dyslipidemia . In addition , atazanavir property unique among protease inhibitor : elevation unconjugated bilirubin inhibit enzyme uridine diphosphate glucuronyltransferase ( UGT ) 1A1 . Bilirubin potent intracellular antioxidant . The investigator demonstrate high level bilirubin within normal range associate reduced rate stroke peripheral artery disease . Patients Gilbert 's Syndrome ( chronic elevation bilirubin result genetically reduce UGT 1A1 ) low rate myocardial infarction compare age-matched control . It plausible use atazanavir compare protease inhibitor , reduce oxidative stress , may improve vascular function , ultimately , reduce rate cardiovascular complication chronic therapy . The benefit atazanavir may particularly important age HIV population . Aging associate high level oxidative stress endothelial dysfunction , associate heighten rate cardiovascular morbidity mortality . Accordingly , investigator hypothesize use atazanavir stable HIV patient age 45 year old improve endothelial dysfunction reduce oxidative stress compare continue current therapy .</detailed_description>
