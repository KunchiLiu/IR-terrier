	<brief_summary>Intraventricular hemorrhage ( IVH ) commonly recognize cerebral lesion ultrasound extremely preterm infant . Papile classification commonly use grade severity IVH . Grade III-IV IVH lesion note ultrasound include periventricular leukomalacia ( pvl ) porencephaly , ventriculomegaly well Documented associate adverse neurodevelopmental outcome . However , true impact lower-grade IVH neurodevelopment extreme preterm infant well describe . Also Neurodevelopmental outcome neonatal non-traumatic Intra Cranial Hemorrhage ( ICH ) well establish . The aim study look retrospectively baby neonatal IVH ICH follow radiological , cognitive , motor functional outcome . The study focus postnatal file , image perform part child 's follow-up hospitalization discharge .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Longterm Outcome Children With Neonatal Intra-Ventricular Intra-Cranial Hemorrhage</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The study perform Retrospective chart review key word : IVH , ICH baby discharge Laniado Hospital Neonatal care service ICU , follow pediatric neurosurgical clinic prematurity/neonatology clinic hospital . All chart child include , review clinical , radiological available data . Registration Clinical , Radiological data present submitted parent Neurosurgical neonatology Neurological Followups perform PI CI cod data anonymously . Follow perform clinically indicate without addition specific study due research . The endpoint study : primary endpoint : 1 . How many child need surgical intervention relate hemorrhage ( ICH , IVH ) secondary endpoint : 2 . Clinical functional outcome child - REGARDING normal schooling , need assistance ADL difference parallel normal child . correlation type hemorrhage , clinical data relate gestational age weight birth , outcomes perform .</detailed_description>
