	<brief_summary>This non-randomized , open-label , Phase Ib/II study ass safety efficacy azacitidine , durvalumab ( MEDI4736 ) , tremelimumab combination therapy treatment patient recurrent and/or metastatic squamous cell carcinoma head neck ( SCCHN ) progress treatment anti-PD-1 , anti-PD-L1 , anti-CTLA-4 monotherapy recurrent and/or metastatic disease . The clinical trial study drug boost participant 's immune system cancer cell possible treatment head neck cancer . The study intervention involve study : - Azacitidine ( Vidaza ) - Durvalumab ( MEDI4736 ) - Tremelimumab</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Phase IB/II Study With Azacitidine , Durvalumab , Tremelimumab Recurrent and/or Metastatic Head Neck Cancer Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This research study Phase I clinical trial , test safety investigational drug also try define appropriate dose investigational drug use study . `` Investigational '' mean drug still study . The FDA ( U.S. Food Drug Administration ) approve durvalumab ( MEDI4736 ) tremelimumab treatment disease . The FDA ( U.S. Food Drug Administration ) approve azacitidine participant 's specific disease approve us . This first human study evaluate safety combine three different drug . Durvalumab ( MEDI4736 ) tremelimumab part family protein make immune system . The body generate protein , antibody , response foreign substance ( particle typically find body bacteria virus ) antibody protect infection . Durvalumab ( MEDI4736 ) tremelimumab antibody study several clinical trial see effect help immune system recognize eliminate abnormal cell body . Investigators hope azacitidine may increase chance immune system recognize cancer cell . Azacitidine test research study similar reason . In research study , investigator look high effective dose azacitidine combination durvalumab ( MEDI4736 ) tremelimumab improve natural ability immune system recognize target head neck cancer cell .</detailed_description>
