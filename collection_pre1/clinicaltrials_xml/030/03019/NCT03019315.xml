	<brief_title>The Analyses Treatment Efficacy Cost-effectiveness Early-staged Ovarian Cancer Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Ovarian carcinoma become important recent year lead cause death among gynecologic malignancy . The annual incidence rate ovarian cancer United States 11.8 per 100,000 death rate 7.8 per 100,000 2009 . According Department Health Bureau 's report , incidence rate ovarian cancer 8.46 per 100,000 2010 death rate 2.8 per 100,000 . No specific symptom , difficulty early diagnosis , insufficient accurate tumor marker , lack information regard ovarian tumor biology contribute poor prognosis . The standard treatment ovarian cancer surgical tumor debulking , follow platinum-containing chemotherapy . The conventional adjuvant chemotherapeutic regimen ovarian cancer platinum combine cyclophosphamide . Whereas , platinum combine paclitaxel identify well adjuvant chemotherapeutic regimen advance-staged disease . In United States , platinum combine paclitaxel use standard adjuvant chemotherapeutic regimen ovarian cancer patient decade . However , many country include Taiwan still use platinum combine cyclophosphamide adjuvant chemotherapeutic regimen early-staged ovarian cancer patient . There comprehensive result demonstrate difference two regimen field efficacy , side effect , survival , cost-effectiveness , . So investigator conduct study answer question . This study firstly focus early-staged ovarian cancer patient analyze data National Health Insurance ( NHI ) databank . Further study validate result NHI databank cancer registration system National Taiwan University Hospital . There several aim proposal . First , study evaluate difference efficacy include response rate , side effect , disease-free survival , overall survival patient two chemotherapeutic regimen . Second , cost-effectiveness two chemotherapeutic regimen identify . The result study provide comprehensive picture select optimal chemotherapeutic regimen early-staged ovarian cancer patient . It also important reference pay-off National Health Insurance .</detailed_description>
