	<brief_title>Survey Blood Transfusion Practices Critically Ill Patients High Altitude</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Anemia identify common complication critically ill patient . Approximately 40 60 % transfuse normal clinical practice . However transfusion free adverse event include : transfusion-associated lung injury , infectious complication , progression organ failure , fluid overload associate transfusion , among others . Therefore , several clinical trial design define red blood cell transfusion threshold . Mainly two group compare : 1 ) liberal scheme patient transfuse high level hemoglobin ( generally ≤ 10 g / dL ) restrictive regimen low level ( ≤ 7 g / dL ) . Institutions British Committee Standards Hematology develop recommendation favor restrictive strategy base mainly TRICC ( Transfusion Requirements In Critical Care ) study conduct Hebert et al . On hand , well know consequence live place high altitude physiological modification occur human . One adaptation increase hemoglobin level occur people live high altitude , especially Andean resident , hypoxia promotes increase production red blood cell . The recommendation restrictive strategy transfusion red blood cell adopt several country numerous population live high altitude , although practice evaluate patient . The purpose study describe current practice transfusion red blood cell critical patient treat intensive care unit locate high altitude area ( 1500 ) determine whether physician follow recommendation restrictive strategy . This observational , non-randomized , cross-sectional survey perform intensivists Bolivia , Colombia , Ecuador , México Perú . The data collect on-line scenaries base survey . The survey designate assessed effect severity , need surgery , severe hypoxia , alteration tisular perfusion modifier transfusion threshold . Besides unit characteristic geographical altitude type unit collect .</detailed_description>
