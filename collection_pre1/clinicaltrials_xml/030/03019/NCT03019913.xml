	<brief_summary>Muscle waste significant problem critically ill patient , report loss half three percent per day first ten day ( average 70kg person equate 3 20kg muscle loss ) . Low skeletal muscle mass admission intensive care unit ( ICU ) loss lean tissue associate negative clinical outcome , include increase incidence infection , length stay , mortality muscle weakness . It therefore crucial technology utilise : 1 ) identify ICU patient low muscularity admission , 2 ) help understand factor impact muscle loss 3 ) ass effectiveness intervention aim maintain skeletal muscle mass population . The measurement lean body mass patient admit ICU challenge however , due large fluid shift occur population logistical issue move patient specialised machinery body composition analysis . Currently , validate method accurately assess patient 's muscle mass bedside intensive care set . It therefore important investigate accuracy , feasibility reliability bedside method subjective physical assessment muscle mass , mid arm muscle circumference , ultrasound bioimpedance analysis ass muscularity population primarily bedbound . In order , critical comparison require method muscularity assess `` reference '' body composition method , compute tomography ( CT ) image analysis . Briefly , quantification skeletal muscle abdomen area utilise abdominal CT image show highly representative whole body skeletal muscle volume . We wish conduct pilot , feasibility study ( n= 50 ) , recruit patient CT scan ( contain abdomen area ) , perform clinical purpose . Our primary aim investigate whether muscularity assess non-invasive bedside method ( ultrasound , bioimpedance analysis , SGA physical assessment , mid arm muscle circumference ) correlate skeletal muscle mass quantify `` reference method '' ( CT image analysis ) .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Aim Our primary aim investigate whether muscularity assess via bedside ultrasound correlate reference method estimate whole body skeletal muscle mass ( CT image analysis ) first day critical illness . Our secondary aim - To investigate whether muscularity assess via bedside method ( bioimpedance spectroscopy , subjective physical assessment mid arm muscle circumference ) correlate reference method estimate whole body skeletal muscle mass ( CT image analysis ) critically ill patient . - To good understand association measure rest energy expenditure muscularity critically ill. - To observe change skeletal muscle mass ( sub set patient two CT scan ) impact various factor , include energy protein delivery change .</detailed_description>
