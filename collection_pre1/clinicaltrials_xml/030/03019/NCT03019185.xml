	<detailed_description>This international , multi-center , Phase 2/3 trial study safety , tolerability , efficacy bardoxolone methyl qualify patient Alport syndrome . The Phase 2 portion trial open-label enroll 30 patient . The Phase 3 portion trial double-blind , randomize , placebo-controlled enroll 180 patient . Patients Phase 2 cohort receive bardoxolone methyl throughout study . Patients Phase 3 cohort randomize 1:1 either bardoxolone methyl placebo randomization stratify baseline albumin creatinine ratio ( ACR ) . Patients randomize placebo remain placebo throughout study , undergo sham titration . All patient study follow visit assessment schedule . Following randomization Day 1 , patient schedule assessed treatment Weeks 1 , 2 , 4 , 6 , 8 , 12 , 24 , 36 , 48 , 52 , 64 , 76 , 88 , 100 , 104 telephone contact Days 3 , 10 , 21 , 31 , 38 , 45 . Patients receive study drug 4-week withdrawal period Weeks 48 52 . They re-start treatment Week 52 dose receive Week 48 continue study drug treatment Week 100 . Patients also schedule assess person follow visit Week 104 , four week end treatment .</detailed_description>
