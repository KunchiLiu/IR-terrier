	<detailed_description>Tourette syndrome ( TS ) neurodevelopmental disorder childhood onset characterize presence chronic motor vocal ( phonic ) tic . Tics typically begin age 4 - 7 year , frequently persist , often lead psychosocial , physical , functional , academic difficulty . Epidemiological study show 20-30 % child exhibit tic classroom set whereas estimate prevalence impair case TS 1/100 - 1/1000 individual . There cure tic variety behavioral pharmacotherapies use successfully suppress tic . Comprehensive Behavioral Intervention Tics ( CBIT ) show beneficial several large trial habit reversal training ( HRT ) , one major component . In past , suggest `` competent trained practitioner administer CBIT . '' This proposal challenge concept believe one establish successful front-line home-based CBIT treatment program would beneficial treatment patient tic symptom throughout country . CBIT safe , effective , front-line treatment TS . Nevertheless , investigator emphasize acute shortage appropriately trained clinician available assist affect individual . Hence , proposal investigator assess effectiveness behavioral home-based , parent administer treatment investigate Johns Hopkins Hospital whether home-based digital video disc ( DVD ) reduce tic severity comparable achieve face-to-face treatment administer experienced therapist . The investigator ' confidence success project base prior experience another childhood movement disorder , primary complex motor stereotypies . The potential significance project enormous , recognize home-based therapy reduce health care cost , visit practitioner , need train large number therapist , importantly provide direct , available care great number individual affect tic .</detailed_description>
