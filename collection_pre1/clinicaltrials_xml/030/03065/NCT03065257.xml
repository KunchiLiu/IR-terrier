	<brief_summary>This retrospective prospective multicenter registry collect long-term data ( 1 year ) patient undergo Endoscopic resection EMR , ESD , EFTR , STER , etc . within gastrointestinal tract endoscopic treatment early gastrointestinal neoplasm involve resection superficial layer , mucosa submucosa , tract wall . Subjects consent medical chart review . The purpose retrospective prospective registry ass long term data efficacy , safety clinical outcome Endoscopic Resection within gastrointestinal tract ( 1 year ) . The registry evaluate efficacy , technical feasibility , clinical outcome , safety profile overall clinical management medical chart review .

	<brief_title>Endoscopic Resection Multicenter Registry</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Endoscopic resection appropriate approach early neoplasm , challenge adenomas sub-epithelial lesion . Endoscopic resection consider less invasive approach surgery . Moreover , endoscopic resection available patient ineligible surgery refuse aggressive surgical intervention . The study investigator would collect data large sample size subject undergo various endoscopic resection procedure EMR ( Endoscopic Mucosal Resection ) , ESD ( Endoscopic submucosal dissection ) , STER ( Submucosal tunnel endoscopic resection , EFTR ( Endoscopic full-thickness resection ) . Clinical metric record include procedure time , length follow-up , specific tumor characteristic , resection method , pathology result , procedural complication , additional therapy require , disease-free survival time . Currently , limit multi-center data endoscopic resection outcomes western population . Evaluation measurement would help investigator compare conventional treatment modality within current tertiary facility ; consequently help investigator identify appropriate treatment technique improve clinical management patient WCMC-NYPH . The purpose retrospective prospective registry ass long term data efficacy , safety clinical outcome Endoscopic Resection within gastrointestinal tract ( 1 year ) .</detailed_description>
