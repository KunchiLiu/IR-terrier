	<brief_title>Perioperative Multimodal Care Cystectomy Frail Patient</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>In industrialized country average life expectancy continuously increase last decade trend expect continue . In Switzerland , sexagenarian 50 % chance , male , 70 % female reaching age 80 . By 2050 , population 80 year-olds multiply 2.7 time Switzerland . Age consider great single risk factor develop cancer , bladder cancer exception typically affect old patient median age time diagnosis around 70 . In US 32 % patient diagnosed bladder cancer 75 84 . In addition , prevalence comorbidities old population high hypertension present 50-60 % , coronary artery disease 15 % , cardiac failure 15 % , dementia 30 % , diabetes 10-20 % , hear vision loss 20-30 % . The presence advance age , several comorbidities , new acute medical condition ( i.e . fracture newly diagnose cancer ) define clinical condition frailty . This medical condition consequence age-related decline many physiological system , defect accumulate passage time ( age ) result increase risk death ( age ) . So surgery perioperative period exceptionally challenge old frail patient due presence comorbidities age-related physiological change . In patient treatment goal focus maintain good quality life remain time span aim excellent functional result possible long term remission . The gold standard care today muscle invasive bladder cancer pelvic lymph node dissection , cystectomy urinary diversion associate high postoperative complication rate ( 50 % ) . This probably today young age , high stage grade disease lower comorbidity associate high odds receive radical cystectomy . However , elderly alone preclude indication radical cystectomy urinary diversion . In addition evidence type anesthesia may impact cognition old patient . Major cardiac non-cardiac surgical procedure know affect cognitive function . The incidence postoperative cognitive dysfunction ( POCD ) vary greatly ( 4 % 41 % major surgery ) . POCD may persist risk factor long-term cognitive deterioration . There evidence multimodal prehabilitation program include optimization nutrition mobilisation improve functional recovery surgery , result less complication short length stay . Optimizing nutritional status frail patient cystectomy avoid general anesthesia could alternative conventional pre- intraoperative approach improve outcome quality life , include pain early return gastrointestinal function cognition functional activity . The objective study evaluate implementation multimodal prehabilitation program include optimization nutrition ( protein carbohydrate ) hydration combine use regional anesthesia ( spinal-epidural anesthesia ) cystectomy series old frail patient compared/matched historical series similar frail patient term early return quality life use Convalescence Recovery Evaluation ( CARE ) instrument , cognition ( CERAD test ) , postoperative morbidity . As need shift emphasis towards patient recovery-centric measure quality life , investigator decide assess early return quality life use CARE instrument primary endpoint . The CARE instrument robust multi-dimensional measure convalescence major abdominal pelvic surgery . It specifically design validated patient undergo abdominal pelvic surgery ( like cystectomy ) high test retest reliability . The CARE instrument cover 4 domain ( pain , gastrointestinal , cognition activity ) . The importance patient-reported health status well recognize facet healthcare quality . In addition valuable mean quantitatively measure implication technology adoption patient , typically judge efficacy surgical procedure whether improves quality life . The Consortium Establish Registry Alzheimer 's Disease ( CERAD ) test widely validate test packet evaluation old patient dementia . However CERAD test also validate perioperative setting . It consist test battery , include verbal fluency , Boston name test , word list learning , constructional praxis , word list recall , word list recognition , mini mental state examination , detect subtle change cognition . It easy applicable investigator expertise use test similar cystectomy population . The investigator , first step , start pilot study include 20 patient order assess feasibility multimodal approach urologic clinic population . The sample size feasibility endpoint base convenience priori calculation conduct . This number patient comparable publish case series illustrate feasibility anesthetic technique cystectomy patient . Secondly , investigator add 11 patient intervention group compare series historical series 31 similar frail old cystectomy patient . This base CARE result historical series ( mean CARE score POD 7 50.68 SD ± 6.43 consider difference 7 point clinically relevant effect size 0.7 ) .</detailed_description>
