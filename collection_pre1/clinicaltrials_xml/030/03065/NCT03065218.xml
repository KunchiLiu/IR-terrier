This patient : - Elevated suppressed stimulated thyroglobulin level ( Tg ) &gt; 10 ng/ml WITHOUT thyroglobulin antibody , - All NEGATIVE standard diagnostic clinical imaging study ( NSDCIS ) = negative ultrasound ( US ) , diagnostic radioiodine scan ( DRS ) , chest-x-ray ( CXR ) , computer tomography without contrast ( CT ) , 18F-Fluoro-deoxyglucose positron emission computer tomography scan ( 18F-FDG PET ) within last 12 mo . - If EDCIS ( extensive diagnostic clinical image study 18F-sodium fluoride positron emission computer tomography scan ( 18F NaF PET ) 99mTc methylene diphosphonate bone scan ( 99mTc MDP ) , AND negative brain CT magnetic resonance ( MR ) perform , also negative . Voluntary patient sestamibi scan perform 4 phase : Phase 1 : receive injection vein radioisotope call 99mTc sestamibi . Phase 2 : wait 60 90 minute wait room Phase 3 : image lie face image table camera pass around top head approximately level knee . This require approximately 45 minute Phase 4 : image review nuclear medicine physician . This take ~10-15 minute . If additional image require clarify image , additional image area perform camera alternate camera . As early , additional image perform lie face . These image require ~20-45 minute . The patient release . The risk study consider low , potential benefit patient consider high .</brief_summary>

The patient release . Interpretation 99mTc Sestamibi Study . A . A team two blind nuclear medicine physician interpret 99mTc sestamibi , area radioactivity grade standard nuclear medicine grade system : 1 . Normal physiological activity 2 . Probably physiological activity 3 . Indeterminate activity 4 . Probably metastatic disease 5 . Metastatic disease B . Criteria `` final determination '' regard whether find represent physiological activity metastatic disease : 1 . For finding grade 1 2 , define study physiological activity . 2 . For finding grade 3 , 4 , follow require : i. Biopsy ; however , perform clinically indicate . 1 . Follow-up : It anticipate biopsy perform criterion enter study NDCIS NECIS , alternative confirm whether foci 99mTc sestamibi uptake scan metastasis follow , perform clinical base . However , follow follow occur , focus categorize metastasis ( true positive ) . 1 . Subsequent biopsy , 2 . Subsequent clinical imaging study ( ) ( For example , although lytic bone lesion area interested present initially CT , lytic lesion indicative metastasis may subsequently develop area , study define evidence metastasis DTC ( true positive ) . ii . Blind I-131 treatment** without prefatory scan : If `` blind '' I-131 treatment '' clinically select post I-131 therapy scan demonstrates uptake area 99mTc sestamibi , find 99mTc sestamibi classify study metastasis DTC . 3 . Grade 5 anticipated , unlikely I-131 , pattern specific DTC , 99mTc sestamibi pattern specific DTC . - A `` blind I-131 treatment '' potential therapeutic option , term mean treat physician team identify source patient 's elevated Tg , factor level elevate Tg , rate rise Tg , patient 's clinical situation , therapeutic administration I-131 give despite `` blind '' source Tg .</detailed_description>
