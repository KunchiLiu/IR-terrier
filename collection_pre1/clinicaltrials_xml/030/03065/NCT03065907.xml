	<brief_title>Timing Low Vision Rehabilitation Anti- Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor ( VEGF ) Therapy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This pilot study understand feasibility conduct randomize , control trial regard time vision rehabilitation patient receive anti-VEGF therapy neovascular age-related macular degeneration . Prior initiate clinical trial , investigator must assure patient loss visual ability willing randomize amenable defer vision rehabilitation intervention . Although typical patient receive usual care present vision rehabilitation service year onset anti-VEGF therapy , manifestation may result patient unaware existence vision rehabilitation service enhance function reduce depression . As part study recruitment , patient inform vision rehabilitation care , suffer difficulty perform everyday activity , may unwilling defer vision rehabilitation . Additionally , study design may feasible answer aim patient delay intervention arm suffer progressive loss visual ability seek vision rehabilitation service , result high drop-out rate .</detailed_description>
