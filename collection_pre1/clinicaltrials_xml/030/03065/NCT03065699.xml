	<brief_title>Safety Performance Trial DIALIVE Liver Dialysis Device Acute On Chronic Liver Failure Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The First-In-Man study evaluate safety performance DIALIVE Liver Dialysis Device Acute Chronic Liver Failure ( ACLF ) patient compare outcome patient treat standard care ( SOC ) . The hypothesis DIALIVE significantly improve prognosis ACLF patient modulate systemic inflammation . The target patient population men woman ≥18 year , ≤81yr . Patients ACLF grade 1 ACLF grade 2 background alcoholic cirrhosis . Treatment undertaken intensive care ( ICU ) renal dialysis unit set patient randomise DIALIVE treatment arm . For patient randomise 'Standard care ' arm , location treatment ( ICU general ward ) determine clinical need decide site Principal Investigator . This project receive funding European Union 's Horizon 2020 research innovation programme grant agreement No 733057 .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Male female subject age ≥18 year ≤81yr give informed consent participate study able understand comply requirement study . History indicative alcoholrelated cirrhosis base clinical , radiological and/or histological evidence . History acute decompensating event ( include limit ascites , gastrointestinal bleeding , hepatic encephalopathy and/or acute bacterial infection ) , occur within ≤6 week screen . Subject meet definition ACLF Grade 1 Grade 2 ( use CLIFC OF score system [ Moreau et al . Gastroenterology 2013 ; Jalan et al . J Hepatol 2014 ] ) . Where subject receive corticosteroid alcoholinduced ACLF , unresponsive least 7 day treatment ( lack response define reduction bilirubin &lt; 25 % 7 day treatment period ) . No evidence untreated infection . Where subject one underlying infection , he/she may enter study provide appropriate antibiotic ( determined investigator ) administer least 48 hour prior randomisation . Coinfection HIV AIDS define illness . Subjects acute subacute liver failure without underlying cirrhosis . Subjects severe thrombocytopaenia , define platelet count &lt; 40,000 / mm3 rapid reduction platelet count ( &gt; 50 % reduction ) 24 hrs prior inclusion . Subjects cirrhosis develop decompensation time postoperative period follow partial hepatectomy . Subjects evidence uncontrolled infection . Subjects chronic and/or preexist kidney disease define eGFR ( estimate glomerular filtration rate ) &lt; 30 mL/min 3 month longer prior screening . Subjects hypotension require use vasopressor ( terlipressin treatment hepatorenal syndrome , follow variceal bleed ) . Subjects evidence significant and/or uncontrolled bleeding ; patient gastrointestinal bleeding enrol 48 hour control bleed . Hepatic encephalopathy Grade 3 4 ( West Haven Criteria ) . Subjects active history non hepatic malignancy unless adequately treated complete remission five year . Patients HCC outside Milan criterion . Significant systemic major illness liver disease , include coronary artery disease , cerebrovascular disease , pulmonary disease , renal failure , serious psychiatric disease , , opinion Investigator would preclude subject participate completing study . Any subject receive investigational drug device within 30 day dose scheduled receive another investigational drug device course study ; concomitant observational study allow . Uncontrolled seizure . Subjects diagnose CreutzfeldtJakob disease . If female : know pregnancy lactate . Subjects unable consent .</criteria>
