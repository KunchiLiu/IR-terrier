	<brief_summary>Unconscious survivor cardiac arrest treat intravenous therapeutic hypothermia 24 hour assess 12 hour appropriateness wake early extubated whilst continue receive therapeutic hypothermia . Sedation reduced/stopped 12 hour enable comprehensive neurological assessment utilise multimodal approach . Providing patient clinically stable adverse neurological sign patient extubated . Patients remain unconscious review 6 hourly neurological recovery suitability extubated line standard practice .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>This study single centre , prospective , feasibility safety study . Consecutively enrol 50 patient . Subjects include adult patient suffer cardiac arrest return spontaneous circulation ( ROSC ) . To qualify , patient must unconscious intubated initial Glasgow Coma Score ( GCS ) &lt; 8 . Intravenous therapeutic hypothermia ( TH ) establish cathlab maintain 24 hour whilst care intensive Care Unit ( ICU ) . IVTM maintain patient 's core temperature target temperature 32-34 degree Celsius . After patient receive 12 hour TH , sedation stop patient comprehensive neurological assessment combine electroencephalogram ( EEG ) , Somatic Sensory Evoked Potential ( SSEP ) neurological biomarkers , Neuron Specific Enolase ( NSE ) S100b . The EEG , SSEP biomarkers review expert neurophysiology core lab off-site . These result review retrospectively , therefore influence medical management patient . Patients clinically stable show adverse neurological sign extubated 12 hour . Patients n't meet early waking criterion reassess every 6 hour extubation . Those patient suitable woken early remain unconscious 24 hour reassess per standard practice unconscious survivor cardiac arrest .</detailed_description>
