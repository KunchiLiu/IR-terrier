	<brief_summary>This multi-institution , single-arm phase II study determine safety efficacy SBRT ( 2 metastatic site preferentially lung , mediastinum bone combination nivolumab ipilimumab patient metastatic renal cell carcinoma ( clear-cell component least 1 measurable metastatic lesion irradiate ) .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Trial SBRT Combination With Nivolumab/Ipilimumab RCC / Kidney Cancer Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The study plan base two-stage design allow early termination lack efficacy . A safety run-in phase include comprise first 6 patient minimum ensure combination nivolumab plus ipilimumab SBRT safe . Then , investigator determine whether combination nivolumab plus ipilimumab SBRT yield clinically compel antitumor activity measure ORR , evaluate endpoint include TTP , DOR , PFS , OS local control irradiate site . There previous experience SBRT use concurrently nivolumab ipilimumab study population . Therefore , ensure combination safe , first six patient treat observed toxicity 6 week radiation continue accrual . Therefore , six patient enrol propose dose nivolumab ipilimumab combination SBRT . If 4 first 6 patient experience Grade 3/4 toxicity low grade toxicity require immune suppressive therapy safety run-in observation period ( define first 4-cycles , 12 week ) , enrollment cease study halt safety analysis combination regimen perform . If less 4 first 6 patient experience Grade 3/4 toxicity require steroid , investigator proceed additional accrual regimen .</detailed_description>
