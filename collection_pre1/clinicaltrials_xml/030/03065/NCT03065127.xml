	<detailed_description>Freezing gait ( FOG ) arguably one debilitate motor symptom experience individual Parkinson 's disease ( PD ) , negatively impact quality life ( Walton et al. , 2015 ) . Furthermore , advance FOG respond well treatment commonly use Parkinson 's disease ( Nutt et al. , 2011 ) , therefore warrant use adjunct treatment option . The development potential treatment strategy FOG focus underlie mechanism . The cross-talk model FOG propose FOG may cause overload cognitive , limbic , sensorimotor system activity basal ganglion , result depletion dopaminergic resource , lead FOG ( Lewis &amp; Barker , 2009 ) . Hence , base cross-talk model , treatment target cognitive , sensorimotor limbic system independently may lead reduction FOG episodes . Previous study demonstrate efficacy therapy target domain PD healthy individual , however , yet explore FOG . Therefore , purpose study evaluate cognitive , sensorimotor , limbic therapy individual FOG . This study employ within-subjects design , participant undergo three treatment randomize counterbalanced order . Sessions type treatment occur 1 hour , twice weekly period 4 week . Participants also undergo pre- post-test assessment prior follow 4-week treatment period . The cognitive training utilize `` Smartbrain Pro '' computer software , previously demonstrate efficacy individual Parkinson 's disease ( Paris et al. , 2011 ) . The sensorimotor train group participate proprioceptive training upper low limb . This training entail target match task , participant produce active self-defined movement blindfold ( i.e . without visual feedback ) . The limbic training group undergo cognitive behavioural therapy ( CBT ) focus solely anxiety symptom .</detailed_description>
