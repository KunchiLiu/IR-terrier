	<brief_summary>Early research find high level fat within muscle meant poor control blood sugar . However , recent research show athlete similar level fat within muscle , contrast , good control blood sugar . The investigator sure want find fat within muscle change improve blood sugar control , good blood sugar control reduce risk heart disease , diabetes stroke .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Muscle Fat Compartments Turnover Determinant Insulin Sensitivity</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Higher level triglyceride ( TG ) diacylglycerols ( DAG ) find skeletal muscle patient obesity/diabetes well trained athlete . Despite similar metabolic storage , patient athletes opposite insulin sensitivity phenotypes explanation lacking . The investigator ' objective understand fat compartment beneficially modulate improve insulin resistance cardio-metabolic risk . The investigator investigate either structural difference ( saturate versus unsaturated balance TG DAG side-chains ) different handle ability ( fast versus slow lipid pool turnover ) induce exercise capacity intervention athletes diabetic patient . In longitudinal study pre- post-exercise , investigator use novel , non-invasive 1H-Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy benchmark saturated/unsaturated compartment skeletal muscle biopsy first time stable isotope analysis fat compartment ' rate turnover .</detailed_description>
