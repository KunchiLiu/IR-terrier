	<brief_title>Study CDK4/6 Inhibitor Palbociclib ( PD-0332991 ) Combination With PI3K/mTOR Inhibitor Gedatolisib ( PF-05212384 ) Patients With Advanced Squamous Cell Lung , Pancreatic , Head &amp; Neck Other Solid Tumors</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This research study open-label Phase I clinical trial , test safety investigational drug combination investigational drug also try define appropriate dose investigational drug ( ) use study . `` Investigational '' mean drug study . The FDA ( U.S. Food Drug Administration ) approve Palbociclib participant specific disease approve us . The FDA approve Gedatolisib alone combination Palbociclb treatment option participant 's disease . In research study investigator hope determine treatment Palbociclib Gedatolisib tolerate help shrink stop growth participant 's cancer . Palbociclib oral drug show stop cell cycle , way cell initiate growth . Gedatolisib think work control series event direct cell growth survival . Gedatolisib may work stop slow activity within tumor cell . By put two drug together investigator hope great effect cancer growth either drug alone .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>For Part I , participant must histologically confirm malignancy metastatic unresectable resistant standard therapy standard therapy available . For Part II , participant must histologically confirm advanced squamous cell lung cancer , advance pancreatic cancer , advance head &amp; neck cancer ( specifically nonoropharynx squamous cell carcinoma HPVnegative oropharynx squamous cell carcinoma ) , tumor suspect PI3Kpathway dependence ( either mutation know biologic rationale , endometrial cancer . PI3K dependence include presence PIK3CAmutant hotspot mutation , PIK3CA copy number gain , PTEN loss archival fresh tumor tissue specimen identify CLIAcertified laboratory . All genetic finding must review study PI , prior study entry . ) For Part I , participant require evaluable disease ( disease visible image study meet RECIST criterion measurable disease ) . For Part II , participant must measurable disease , define least one lesion accurately measure least one dimension ( long diameter record ) &gt; 20 mm conventional technique &gt; 10 mm spiral CT scan . See section 10 evaluation measureable disease . Participants permit number prior therapy prior enrollment Age ≥ 18 year . . ECOG performance status ≤ 2 Participants must normal organ marrow function define : Absolute neutrophil count ≥ 1,500/mcL Hemoglobin ≥9.0 gm/dL Platelets ≥ 100,000/mcL Total bilirubin within normal institutional limit AST ( SGOT ) /ALT ( SGPT ) ≤ 2.5 X institutional upper limit normal ( ≤ 5.0 X institutional upper limit normal permit hepatic metastasis present ) Creatinine within 1.5x ULN institutional limit Fasting glucose ≤ 126 mg/dL ( 7.0 mmol/L ) HbA1c ≤ 7.0 % The effect palbociclib Gedatolisib ( PF05212384 ) develop human fetus unknown . For reason , woman childbearing potential men must agree use adequate contraception ( hormonal barrier method birth control ; abstinence ) prior study entry , duration study participation , 90 day discontinuation . Ability understand willingness sign write informed consent document . Participants chemotherapy radiotherapy within 3 week ( 6 week nitrosoureas mitomycin C ) prior enter study recover acute effect prior therapy baseline Grade ≤1 except Alopecia AEs constitute safety risk opinion investigator . Participants may receive study agent concurrently study drug . Participants symptomatic brain metastasis require active treatment exclude . Current use anticipate need food medication know strong CYP3A4 inhibitors/inducers , include administration within 7days prior first Gedatolisib ( PF05212384 ) palbocilib dose study treatment . QTc &gt; 480 msec ; history QT syndrome , Brugada syndrome know history QTc prolongation , Torsade de Pointes . Patients history diabetes . Uncontrolled intercurrent illness include , limited ongoing active infection , symptomatic congestive heart failure , unstable angina pectoris , cardiac arrhythmia , psychiatric illness/social situation would limit compliance study requirement . Pregnant woman exclude study study agent potential teratogenic abortifacient effect . Because unknown potential risk adverse event nurse infant secondary treatment mother study agent , breastfeed discontinue mother treat . Individuals history malignancy ineligible except follow circumstance . Individuals history previous malignancy eligible diseasefree least 2 year deem investigator low risk recurrence malignancy . Individuals follow cancer eligible diagnose treat within past 5 year : cervical cancer situ , basal cell squamous cell carcinoma skin . Active clinically significant bacterial , fungal viral infection include hepatitis B ( HBV ) , hepatitis C ( HCV ) , know human immunodeficiency virus ( HIV ) acquire immunodeficiency syndrome ( AIDS ) relate illness . Concurrent use anticipate need medication mainly metabolize UGT1A9 include administration within 7days prior first dose study drug . Current use anticipate need food medication metabolize CYP2D6 , narrow therapeutic index include administration within 10days prior first Gedatolisib ( PF05212384 ) dose study treatment . Concurrent use herbal preparation include saw palmetto . Current use drug know prolong QT interval . Concurrent use proton pump inhibitor ( include , limited , dexlansoprazole , esomeprazole , lansoprazole , omeprazole , pantoprazole , rabeprazole ) palbociclib prohibit .</criteria>
