	<brief_summary>The aim investigate biomechanical interaction trunk gait performance healthy stroke subject . People stroke often impaired trunk function , result balance gait disorder . Pathological movement pattern stroke compare normative data motion capture system provide sensitive data explore interaction trunk performance gait contrast clinical measure use literature .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Interaction Between Trunk Gait Performance Both Healthy Adults Stroke Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Evidence show trunk performance related measure balance , gait functional ability . Yet , several aspect trunk performance sit balance , trunk muscle strength , selective trunk movement trunk position sense impaired stroke . This imply impaired trunk performance inevitably lead impaired postural control activity perform stand walking . Nonetheless , interaction increase trunk performance improvement activity perform stand walk evident . It previously state therapy primarily induces treatment effect abilities train specifically aim . However , previous research show additional trunk exercise improve trunk performance also stand balance mobility . Yet , clinical outcome measure use previous study suitable explore relationship trunk gait performance explain underlying mechanism therapeutic effect . Since study use sensitive motion analysis investigate trunk biomechanics gait sparse healthy subject subject stroke . Data gather Vicon analysis system ( ©Vicon Motion Systems Ltd. , London , UK ) measure frequency 100 Hz eight infrared automate camera ( Vicon T10 camera , 100 fps , 1 Megapixel ) measure 3D coordinate reflective marker . In addition , initial contact toe define base ankle trajectory reflective marker together 3 AMTI type OR 6-7 force plate ( 1000 fps , 46x50x8 cm ) 1 AccuGait® ( 1000 fps ) force plate recording . Reflective motion tracker attach anatomical landmark participant 's body accord standard Plug-In-Gait model . Furthermore , 16 channel telemetric wireless EMG system ( Arion Zerowire ) measure muscle activity .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Inclusion Criteria Stroke : 1. haemorrhagic ischaemic stroke diagnosis , confirm basis CT MRI imaging ; 2. know history previous stroke ; 3. stroke onset within five month ; 4. patient 18 85 year age ; Exclusion Criteria Stroke : 1 . A score 20 high Trunk Impairment Scale indicate normal truncal function ; 2 . A score low two Functional Ambulation Categories ( FAC ) patient need able ambulate without physical support ensure gait analysis execute safely ; 3 . Not able sit independently 30 second stable surface ; 4 . They suffer neurological orthopaedic disorder could influence motor performance balance ; 5. able understand instruction .</criteria>
