	<detailed_description>This open-label , single arm , phase 2 trial include pre post-menopausal female subject , ER-positive , HER2-negative early breast cancer . Subject receive 4 cycle palbociclib 125 mg ( cycle palbociclib consist treatment D1 D21 follow week rest ) combine endocrine therapy give continuously ( cycle endocrine therapy consist treatment D1 D28 ) . The endocrine therapy determine accord menopausal status subject evaluate study screening . For post-menopausal subject : endocrine therapy consist letrozole 2.5 mg continuously . For pre-menopausal peri-menopausal subject : endocrine therapy consist tamoxifen 20 mg continuously , combine goserelin 3.6 mg monthly local investigator 's discretion . Endocrine therapy group continue last day palbociclib treatment ( i.e . day surgery ) . Subject 's response therapy evaluate 4 cycle treatment ultrasound determine response therapy . Post treatment ultrasound perform 7 10 day surgery ( maximum delay 3 day case delay surgery date ) . Surgery perform 4 8 day end 4th cycle study treatment . Biopsy sample collect subject 's inclusion study prior Day 1 Cycle 1 study treatment ( pre-treatment biopsy ) consist collection 4 core biopsy ( 2 FFPE 2 Frozen ) . FFPE frozen material collect surgical material leave , sufficient relevant part retain establish , improve complement diagnosis treatment subject . One whole blood sample ( 1x10 mL ) also collect subject 's inclusion prior Day 1 Cycle 1 study treatment . Blood sample plasma processing ( 4x10 mL per time point ) collect subject 's inclusion prior Day 1 Cycle 1 , prior Day 1 Cycle 2 study treatment , surgery day ( prior surgery ) one month surgery . All biological sample collect ( pre-treatment biopsy , material surgery blood sample ) within study mandatory . The breast biopsy sample well image tumour assessment ( ultrasound breast ) perform prior signature study ICF admissible assessment study end-points repeat within require study time window . Primary objective : • To identify biomarkers resistance 4-month preoperative treatment palbociclib plus endocrine therapy define stable progressive disease ultrasound ( base WHO criterion ) use RNA-seq baseline tumour biopsy . Secondary objective : - To identify biomarkers resistance 4-month preoperative treatment endocrine therapy palbociclib correlate tumour response ultrasound ( mandatory ) magnetic resonance ( optional ) image ( response assess continuous categorical variable ) RNA-seq baseline tumour biopsy - To identify biomarkers resistance 4-month preoperative treatment palbociclib plus endocrine therapy define residual disease burden , RCB 3 use RNA-seq baseline tumour biopsy - To identify biomarkers resistance 4-month preoperative treatment endocrine therapy palbociclib define GGI high RNA-seq residual tumour surgery use RNA-seq baseline tumour biopsy - To understand mechanism resistance combination endocrine therapy palbociclib compare transcriptome tumour baseline surgery use RNA-seq - To evaluate safety combination palbociclib plus endocrine therapy - To evaluate role plasma ctDNA monitor response/resistance pre-operative treatment endocrine therapy palbociclib - To validate/further refine 11-gene expression signature associate response/resistance palbociclib endocrine treatment</detailed_description>
