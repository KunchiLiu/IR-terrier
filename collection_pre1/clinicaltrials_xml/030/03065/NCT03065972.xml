The target sample size include enrollment 270 patient period 5 year . The creation autologous arteriovenous fistula placement hemodialysis access graft constitute two arm study . Following access creation patient followed-up per standard study protocol period 2 year time access creation . The investigator use block randomization achieve patient allocation ratio 1:1 , use vary block size 4 6 random order per web-based/computer generated system maintain block randomization sequence/list conceal blind clinical trial research team end trial . Patients randomly allocate base permute sequence either two intervention group . Masking perform shall involve blind patient participate trial . The research assistants involve consenting , enrol , data collection follow-up , statistician analyze outcome measure blind group assignment . The operating surgeon shall blind allocation process time access creation follow knowledge regard type access creation surgeon inevitable . All patient consent study relate detail include history , physical evaluation , diagnostic test , etc. , enter case report form maintain web-based database .
