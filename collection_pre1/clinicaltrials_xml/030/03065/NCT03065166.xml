	<brief_title>Dried Cabernet Grapes Cardiovascular Risk Markers</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The initiation progression atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease ( CVD ) multifactorial nature , currently think chronic inflammatory condition . To reduce risk CVD associate health care cost California elsewhere , nutrition health recommendation strongly advocate consumption diet rich fruit vegetable . Such recommendation base largely epidemiological data ; mechanism underlie putative positive effect plant food-rich diet poorly define area active debate . In addition essential vitamin mineral , fruit vegetable contain number bioactive compound may involve vascular function . In regard , epidemiological study note significant inverse relationship intake plant food rich polyphenols risk all-cause mortality CVD . For example , `` French paradox '' refers diet pattern , despite high saturate fat , associate relatively low cardiovascular risk , may due , part , robust intake polyphenols find red wine , grape , plant food . Red wine contain array phytochemical propose improve cardiovascular health , great focus polyphenols . However , grape product dry cabernet grape also contain substantial amount polyphenols may vasculoprotective .</detailed_description>
