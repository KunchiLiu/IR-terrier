	<detailed_description>CIPN common side effect many chemotherapeutic agent often result dose limitation , switch less efficacious agent even therapy discontinuation . CIPN mainly affect sensory nerve , motor autonomic nerve injury rare . Therefore , patient CIPN experience numbness , tingle , hyperesthesia , loss vibratory perception , burn pain . Due vulnerability long nerve , CIPN typically appear 'stocking glove ' distribution . Chemotherapeutic agent cause CIPN include platinum compound ( e.g. , cisplatin , oxaliplatin ) , antitubulins ( vinca alkaloid ( e.g. , vincristine ) taxanes ( e.g. , docetaxel , paclitaxel ) ) , proteasome inhibitor ( e.g. , bortezomib ) immunomodulatory drug ( e.g. , lenalidomide ) . Platinum compound known accumulate dorsal root ganglion ( DRG ) lead cell death sensory neuron . DRG death may account chronic sensory neuropathy , manifest primarily sensory paresthesia , dysesthesias sensory ataxia often locate extremity persist cycle . In addition , Oxaliplatin directly regulate gate axonal voltage-gated sodium channel , induce acute neurotoxicity characterize peripheral nerve hyperexcitability . Symptoms , like sensitivity touch cold item , discomfort swallow cold liquid , throat discomfort , muscle cramp , occur shortly infusion . Taxanes know cause disruption microtubule function therefore microtubule-based axonal transport . In addition , interfere macrophage activation DRG peripheral nerve , well microglial activation within spinal cord . These effect result distal axonopathy also refer dying-back phenomenon . The effectiveness OnLife® improve CIPN base patent fatty acid group ( FAG ) comprise palmitoylethanolamide ( PEA ) , alpha-linolenic acid , eicosapentaenoic acid ( EPA ) , docosahexaenoic acid ( DHA ) , linoleic acid , oleic acid , palmitic acid , stearic acid , arachidic acid myristic acid . PEA , one main component OnLife® , endogenous fatty acid amide belong class endocannabinoids show anti-inflammatory , antinociceptive , neuroprotective anticonvulsant property . It synthesize response several inflammatory painful disorder ( e.g. , intestinal inflammation neuropathic pain ) order counteract pathological state . Clinical research reveal treatment exogenous PEA effective safe various neuropathological condition , include chronic idiopathic axonal neuropathy , diabetic neuropathy , nerve compression syndrome , well chemotherapy-induced neuropathic pain . PEA exert analgesic anti-inflammatory function peripheral nervous system action sensory neuron non-neuronal cell involve inflammation , mast cell macrophages . It indirectly activate cannabinoid receptor signal inhibit hydrolysis endocannabinoids . This suppress nociceptive behavior counteracts macrophage mast cell activation , thereby reduce pain inflammatory symptom . Another biological target PEA nuclear peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor ( PPAR ) -alpha , express various cell implicate peripheral nociception , include dorsal DRG neuron macrophage . Binding PEA PPAR-alpha ultimately result reduce transcription pro-inflammatory gene ( e.g. , TNF-alpha , IL-6 , COX-2 , iNOS ) well repressed activity pro-inflammatory transcription factor . In addition , evidence bind PEA PPAR-alpha may modulate excitability primary sensory neuron direct indirect mechanism . The fatty acid include OnLife® also show anti-inflammatory property . Currently , study evaluate efficacy safety OnLife® patient CIPN carry St. Savvas Anticancer Hospital , Athens Dr. J. Skarlatos . First result suggest OnLife® reduce pain , numbness tingle improve heat/cold sensitivity assess physician . PRO , use DN4 ( Douleur Neuropathique 4 ) questionnaire , reveal reduction score diagnose neuropathic pain OnLife® application . Moreover , patient show product-related side effect ( date file , unpublished ) .</detailed_description>
