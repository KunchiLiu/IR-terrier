	<brief_summary>Sepsis define occurrence systemic inflammatory response syndrome ( SIRS ) context infection . Unfortunately , incidence appear rise , mortality septic shock remain extraordinary high ( &gt; 60 % ) . Death sepsis arise shock multi organ dysfunction - least part - triggered inadequate response host 's immune system infection . Given injurious role 1 ) overwhelm immune response 2 ) consumption protective plasmatic factor ( e.g . vWF cleave protease , hemostatic factor etc . ) disease progress investigator hypothesize early therapeutic plasma exchange ( TPE ) severely ill individual might improve hemodynamics , oxygenation ultimately survival . This therapeutic strategy combine 2 major aspect 1 procedure : 1. removal harmful circulating molecule 2. replacement protective plasma protein . The investigator design EXCHANGE trial analyze randomize fashion benefit TPE add-on treatment state art standard sepsis care . Only patient early septic shock ( &lt; 12 hr ) high catecholamine dos ( noradrenaline &gt; 0.4 ug/kg bodyweight/min ) include . Those treatment group receive 3 TPEs within three consecutive day . The primary outcome 28-day cause mortality . To show assumed reduction 60 % 45 % experimental group , sample size 173 patient per group calculate . The overall sample size therefore n=346 . The recruitment period 3 year ( +3 month observation ) perform 11 national center Germany . Secondary endpoint ( include hemodynamics , oxygenation , coagulation , microcirculation ) assess day 1 , 2 , 3 TPE day 4 , 5 , 7 14 . Project management data monitoring organize Hanover Clinical Trial Center biostatistics include web-based randomization perform Institute biometrics ( Prof. Koch ) Hannover Medical School . The investigator hope demonstrate potential benefit additive treatment approach improve outcome patient suffer under-recognized deadly disease .</brief_summary>
