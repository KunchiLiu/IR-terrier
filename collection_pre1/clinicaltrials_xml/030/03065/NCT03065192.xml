	<brief_title>Safety Efficacy Study VY-AADC01 Advanced Parkinson 's Disease</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Parkinson 's disease ( PD ) neurodegenerative disorder involve loss dopamine produce neuron locate striatum . Levodopa primary treatment use treat Parkinson 's disease , convert dopamine enzyme ( protein ) Aromatic L-Amino Acid Decarboxylase ( AADC ) . As PD progress , amount AADC level brain decrease , turn , reduce amount dopamine produce dose levodopa . The primary objective study evaluate safety increase AADC level , via gene delivery . The investigational drug , term VY-AADC-01 , inject directly striatum neurosurgical procedure perform real-time MRI image monitor delivery . Participants continue take Parkinson medication , include levodopa participate study . The safety potential clinical response VY-AADC-01 assess repeat clinical evaluation Parkinson 's disease , treatment review phone call , cognitive test , laboratory blood test , patient report outcomes scale , patient diary , collection adverse event , neuroimaging . Clinical evaluation perform 3 year follow-up period .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Diagnosed idiopathic PD . Adequate duration levodopa therapy . Disease duration least 5 year . Modified Hoehn &amp; Yahr Staging least 2.5 hour OFF state . Candidate surgical intervention disable motor complication . UPDRS Part III ( total score ) least 25 OFF state . Unequivocal responsiveness dopaminergic therapy . Stable Parkinson 's symptom medication least 4 week prior screen evaluation . Ability comprehend sign inform consent . Normal laboratory value prior surgery . Medically mentally capable undergo comply surgical procedure protocol requirement . Ability travel study visit alone able designate caregiver . Subject agree defer neurological surgery , include deep brain stimulation , complete 12 month study visit ( unless recommend study neurologist ) . Approved Eligibility Review Committee . Atypical secondary parkinsonism , include limited symptom believe due trauma , brain tumor , infection , cerebrovascular disease , neurological disease , drug , chemical , toxin . Presence dementia define Mattis Dementia Rating Scale Second Edition ( MDRS2 ) score less 130 screening . Presence history psychosis , exception mild , benign hallucination believe judgment Investigator relate Parkinson 's medication . Presence severe depression , indicate BDIII score great 28 , history major affective disorder within 5 year screen evaluation . Active suicidal ideation suicide attempt within 5 year screen evaluation . History substance abuse within 2 year screen evaluation . Brain imaging abnormality striatum region would substantially increase risk surgery . Contraindication MRI and/or gadoteridol . Coagulopathy inability temporarily stop anticoagulation antiplatelet therapy prior surgery . Prior brain surgery include lesioning procedure , deep brain stimulation , infusion therapy brain surgery . Prior gene transfer . History stroke , poorly control significant cardiovascular disease , diabetes , acute chronic medical condition . History malignancy treat carcinoma situ within 3 year screen evaluation . Clinically apparent laboratorydetected infection . Prior current treatment investigational agent within 2 month screen evaluation . Inability comply procedure protocol , include completion paper Parkinson 's disease diary , frequent prolong study visit include medication visit , travel . Chronic immunosuppressive therapy , include chronic steroid , immunotherapy , cytotoxic therapy , chemotherapy . Any serious medical condition abnormal find physical examination laboratory investigation would substantially increase risk study procedure . Any medical condition likely lead disability course study interfere confound study assessment . Pregnant lactating woman . Male female reproductive capacity unwilling use barrier contraception 6 month surgery . Plans receive vaccination within 30 day surgery . Any factor , medical social , would likely cause participant unable follow study protocol , include geographical inaccessibility . Ongoing treatment include neuroleptic medication , apomorphine , levodopa infusion therapy ( DuopaÂ® ) . Plans participate therapeutic intervention study within 12 month surgery .</criteria>
