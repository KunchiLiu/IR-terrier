	<detailed_description>Research background Preimplantational genetic screen ( PGS ) tool diagnosis embryo chromosome abnormality transfer . Under tool , patient family history genetic disease special genetic disease could avoid produce chromosomal abnormality next pregnant . For preemergence embryos genetic diagnosis must carry artificial reproductive treatment , process include induction ovulation , ovulation , vitro fertilization embryo culture , embryo grow six eight cell culture stage blastocyst stage , Under embryonic section , take one several cell , slice cell genetic diagnosis , select embryo without genetic disease implant uterine cavity , order avoid birth genetic disease offspring . PGS reduce pregnancy chromosomal abnormality fetus implantation , also reduce risk abortion chromosomal abnormality , avoid couple implant genetic abnormality embryos , thereby significantly reduce important promote process eugenics reduce social cost . Research purpose The detection chromosomal abnormality embryos important factor clinical diagnosis screen implantation . However , complete analysis domestic study . This program compare gene chromosomal abnormality clinical outcome embryo test different stage embryonic development . Research design This study retrospective study , data collection 2001 Jan. 2015 . Nov . Patients underwent PGS data include couple age , infertility factor , stimulation protocol , medicine record , embryo quality record blood test collect study . Analysis relationship outcome PGS , clinical outcome embryo quality perform find diagnosis reference clinical care .</detailed_description>
