	<brief_title>Early Versus Late FDG-PET/CT Bladder Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Background : Approximately 900 patient diagnosed invasive bladder cancer ( BC ) Denmark year . Approximately 50 % diagnose non-muscle invasive BC ( T1 ) approximately 50 % diagnosed muscle invasive BC ( T2-4 ) . Male-female ratio 75 % - 25 % median age among diagnosed patient time diagnose 73 year ( range 32 - 98 ) ( national data September 1st 2014 august 31st 2015 ) .1 One third diagnose patient treated surgical removal urinary bladder , radical cystectomy ( RC ) . Additional 14 % receive curative intend radiotherapy . At Department Urology , Aarhus University Hospital , approximately 120 patient treated RC due BC every year . 2- [ 18F ] -Fluoro-2-deoxy-D-glucose ( FDG ) - positron emission tomography ( PET ) /computed tomography ( CT ) standard primary staging Aarhus University Hospital , Denmark , evaluate patient muscle invasive BC radical curative intend treatment . Evaluation disease stage do investigation lymph node metastasis non-local metastasis separately . FDG radioactively mark glucose analogue use tracer cell high glucose uptake . The uptake glucose malignant cell much great glucose uptake normal cell . Because , FDG use tracer diagnosis cancer hereby also BC . However , FDG cancer specific tracer . Cells immune system like neutrophil leucocyte , macrophage lymphocyte also high glucose uptake thus , high FDG uptake . Being glucose analogue , uptake FDG cell similar uptake glucose , transport protein GLUT-1 . Inside cell FDG phosphorylated FDG-6-phosphate enzyme hexokinase . FDG-6-phosphate metabolize trap inside cell . Malignant cell tendency up-regulate GLUT-1 hexokinase result increase FDG uptake cancer cell . Hereby optimize imagine primary tumour possible metastasis also possible inflammatory change . After intravenous injection FDG , distribution FDG body visualize perform PET-scan . FDG-PET high sensitivity detect even small malignant change specific show anatomical localization change . Thus , FDG-PET combine CT-scan , high sensitivity anatomical localization . Hybrid PET/CT scanner widely use imaging . International study show FDG-PET/CT superior CT magnetic resonance ( MR ) alone detect lymph node metastasis patient BC.2,3 Aim : The aim study examine late FDG-PET/CT image intravenous FDG injection high sensitivity specificity detect local lymph node metastases patient muscle invasive BC FDG-PET/CT image 60 minute FDG injection . The latter procedure routinely . Hypothesis : FDG-PET/CT 180 minute post injection ( PI ) high specificity FDG-PET/CT 60 minute PI regard differentiation local lymph node metastasis benign inflammatory change local lymph node evaluate patient muscle invasive BC radical treatment . Method : 200 consecutive patient diagnosed muscle invasive BC candidate radical cystectomy examine FDG-PET/CT scan primary stag evaluation local lymph node metastasis distant metastasis . In standard procedure , patient give intravenous FDG rest 30 minute 60 minute PET/CT-scan perform . The PET/CT scan perform course 25-40 minute . In study , include patient additional PET/CT ( low dose ) -scan pelvic area perform 180 minute PI . The FDG-PET/CT scan evaluate experienced specialist nuclear medicine together experience specialist radiology . SUVmax value regional lymph node early late image compare histology remove lymph node . Lymph node dissection cystectomy perform accord extend template aortic bifurcation proximal limit . Lymph node lymph node package FDG-positive preoperative PET/CT send mark separately pathological evaluation possible . All dissect lymph node undergo pathological evaluation . Histological evaluation perform specialist Institute Pathology histological tissue either needle biopsy dissect lymph node time cystectomy . The study take place 1th January 2017 total 100 patient include , expect end 2018 . Ethical aspect : Patients include study receive small additional radiation dose ( 1-1 1/2 mSv ) due extra low dose CT pelvic area . The patient receive radiation dose FDG . The patient longer stay The Department Nuclear &amp; PET Center due extra PET/CT scan 2 hour first PET/CT scan . Duration extra scan pelvic area 6-8 min . The radiation dose standard FDG PET/CT bladder cancer 18-28 mSv . The regional ethic committee Central Denmark Region notify study . They consider quality assurance hence objection performance study . After one year inclusion preliminary result evaluate . It expect 50 patient included time . Perspectives : As today common practice patient find possibly suitable cystectomy due BC get FDG-PET/CT performed prior treatment evaluate disease stage . The sensitivity FDG-PET/CT detecting malignant local lymph node high . The specificity , however , invert proportional depend SUVmax cut-off . If method improve specificity could find would mean significant difference patient may get good treatment due BC low mortality time . If study find PET scan 180 minute FDG injection high specificity detect malign local lymph node patient BC PET scan 60 minute , change procedure accord . As consequence , good evaluate BC patient prior potential curative treatment .</detailed_description>
