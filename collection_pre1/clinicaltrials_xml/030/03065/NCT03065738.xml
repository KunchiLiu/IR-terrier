	<brief_title>Effect RO On GB During TKR Severe Varus Deformity</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Severe varus deformity tibio femoral angle 15Â° measure full-length weight-bearing radiograph necessitates extensive release medial structure gain neutral limb alignment total knee arthroplasty ( TKA ) . progressive release medial structure perform medial lateral envelope equally balance . This technique , however , face risk over-release subsequent instability , ultimately result use thicker polyethylene insert even constrained-type prosthesis . Reduction osteotomy know soft tissue-sparing technique soft tissue balancing , capable reduce amount release require balance knee prevent release medial structure . Dixon et al . Mullaji et al . propose effectiveness down-sizing tibial component case knee severe varus deformity Aim work : Assess effect reduction osteotomy gab balance total knee arthroplasty severe varus deformity -What amount deformity correction achieve reduction osteotomy TKA varus knee ? - What correlation amount deformity correction achieve amount bone osteotomized degree varus deformity ?</detailed_description>
