PCOS associate multiple co-morbidities include obesity , insulin resistance , subfertility , impaired quality life ( QoL ) increase risk type 2 diabetes . Obstructive sleep apnoea ( OSA ) common medical condition often undiagnosed , particularly woman . Obesity common risk factor OSA PCOS OSA associate comorbidities similar observe patient PCOS insulin resistance , increase risk type 2 diabetes , impaired QoL .
