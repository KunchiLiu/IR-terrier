	<brief_summary>Vasospasm common complication rupture intracranial aneurysm cause devastate neurologic deficit death . Vasospasm directly associate amount subarachnoid blood inside basal cistern . Prior literature attempt refine treatment rupture intracranial aneurysm clear guideline optimal method drain subarachnoid blood . Two method , extraventricular drain ( EVD ) lumbar drain ( LD ) compare retrospectively yet remain controversial method optimal reduce subarachnoid blood prevent vasospasm . This study would prospective randomize trial patient would assign EVD LD observe see one method intervention associate prevent clinical vasospasm , decrease subarachnoid blood , shorten overall ICU stay , reduce need permanent ventriculoperitoneal shunt . The conclusion study may identify optimal treatment modality benefit future patient rupture intracranial aneurysm .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Lumbar Drain v Extraventricular Drain Prevent Vasospasm Subarachnoid Hemorrhage</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This study prospective randomize controlled trial . Participants patient admit UCSD Hillcrest Thornton Hospital subarachnoid hemorrhage . Patients recruit Endovascular Neurosurgical treatment team . Since exist guideline exist procedural drainage subarachnoid blood intracranial cistern , patient currently treat either lumbar drain extraventricular drain . This study would randomize process assign patient either LD EVD part treatment package subarachnoid hemorrhage . Both EVD LD regularly perform UCSD . Both procedure equally likely take place patient randomization . There currently gold standard dictate whether EVD do LD vice versa . Patients consent partake study also consent usual care SAH . Briefly , inclusion criterion patient Fisher Grade II , III , IV SAH aneurysmal SAH patient radiographic evidence hydrocephalus . Briefly , exclusion criterion patient obstructive hydrocephalus mass lesion would preclude lumbar drain placement . Pregnant patient minor age &lt; 18 include study . There two arm study : patient randomly assign LD patient randomly assign EVD . Randomization account Fisher Grade . The two treatment arm CSF diversion 7 day . For patient treated lumbar drain , patient CSF drainage 10cc/hour lumbar drain patient treat EVD 15cm tragus . Both extraventricular drain lumbar drain define significant risk device however device FDA approve utilized exact manner intend . Both device already regularly utilized part standard care sub arachnoid hemorrhage management utilized novel way . LD EVD assignment randomize protocol study . Data collect via electronic medical record ass patient age , patient present Hess grade clinical improvement post cerebrospinal fluid diversion , aneurysmal bleed day presentation , method technical success secure aneurysm ( clip versus coil ) , size location aneurysm , discharge disposition clinical exam ( NIH Stroke Scale ) , complication ( tract hemorrhage infection ) , need intra-arterial management vasospasm . Expected Sample size study include approximately 200 patient half patient include study treat LD half treat EVD . The number estimate patient calculate annual incidence SAH receive UCSD hospital . The facility available project include UCSD Hillcrest Hospital , UCSD Thornton Hospital , UCSD Endovascular Neurosurgery suite . The primary outcome study time clearance acute cisternal blood surveillance CT ( stratify present Fischer Grade ) , need endovascular treatment vasospasm stroke vasospasm , time spend critical care unit , need ventriculoperitoneal shunt . Regarding CT scan ; Surveillance CTs standard care . They typically perform day device placement subsequent imaging take place pending clinical resolution patient . For patient , additional CT scan 1-2 day initial device placement final scan 7th day device placement . If clinical condition deteriorates , patient additional scan monitor intracranial bleeding . The scan perform clinical purpose monitor resolution intracranial injury . This study would collect data obtain scan . The total exposure result image study calculate approximately 10 mSv . Additional head CT may perform clinically indicated exposure 2.5 mSv per scan . Fluoroscopy routinely use , however clinically indicate , may utilize lumbar drainage procedure radiation exposure 1.5 mSv per minute . This amount one would receive one year natural exposure San Diego area , approximately 1.6 mSv . Cumulative exposure radiation may increase person 's risk develop certain type cancer future . This imaging determine part routine care management SAH . In study , merely collect data image determine clinical incidence vasospasm resolution cisternal bleeding . DSM criterion derive Al Tamimi et al . The initial power calculation base Al Tamimi et study 9 demonstrate 85 % power , 105 patient require arm trial . Interim analysis perform recruit 40 patient order establish adverse effect additional reevaluation 100 patient determine one arm study superior . If identify , trial stop recruitment 100 patient . Statistical analysis continue throughout trial . If statistically significant difference arm study identify earlier enrollment process , study discontinue . Monitoring take place internally differences two group examine additional 5 patient added group . Internal monitoring take place ( D.R.S.D. , A.W. , R.R. , A.K. , S.P . ) Statistical method evaluate data include chi square test , use independent test normal numerical data , compare categorical data Fisher exact test . P value .05 consider clinically significant study .</detailed_description>
