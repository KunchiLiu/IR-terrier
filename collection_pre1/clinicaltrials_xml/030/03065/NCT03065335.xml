	<brief_summary>Background : Most medication treat depression take week month work . Researchers want develop fast-acting treatment . One dose ketamine rapid antidepressant effect . For people , last week less . Repeated dos ketamine may help maintain effect . Objective : To study effect ketamine treat depression . Eligibility : People age 18-65 major depressive disorder healthy volunteer Design : Participants screen another study , : - Medical psychiatric history - Psychiatric physical exam - Blood , urine , heart test Participants inpatient NIH 4 phase total 14-20 week . Phase I ( 2-7 week ) : - Gradually stop current medication - MRI : Participants lie perform task machine take picture body . - Mood thinking test - Blood urine test - Sleep test : Monitors skin record brain wave , breathing , heart rate , movement sleep . - Transcranial magnetic stimulation : A coil scalp give electrical current affect brain activity . - Stress test : Electrodes skin measure reaction loud noise electric shock .

	<detailed_description>Objective Intravenous ketamine glutamatergic modulate agent demonstrate rapid improvement depressive symptom . In previous investigation conduct group , non-competitive NMDA receptor antagonist ( i.e . ketamine ) effective patient fail least 2 antidepressant treatment ( i.e . treatment-resistant depression ) . Response single dose ketamine typically occur within 2 hour last approximately 1 week . While several study investigate acute neural response ketamine infusion healthy volunteer , data regard neuropharmacodynamic effect ketamine patient limited . Therefore , investigation biological mechanism neural correlate response ( non-response ) associate single dose ketamine administration need . Furthermore , study investigate safety efficacy prolong , repeat administration ( i.e. , one administration ) subanesthetic dos intravenously infused ketamine achieve sustain antidepressant response . Therefore , great need potential identify biomarkers response single infusion repeat ketamine administration . The current protocol two-fold purpose . In pharmacodynamic imaging phase , plan investigate neuropharmacodynamics acute ketamine administration patient major depressive disorder ( MDD ) healthy volunteer ( HV ) use functional MRI ( fMRI ) electrophysiological modality [ electroencephalography ( EEG ) magnetoencephalography ( MEG ) ] . Additionally , plan investigate whether specific signature functional neuroimaging , transcranial magnetic stimulation ( TMS ) associate evoked potential ( TMS-EP ) , sleep EEG ( S-EEG ) , psychophysiologic response use classify specific subpopulation patient MDD ; preliminary finding approach may important forge study identify respond ketamine infusion . In repeat-dosing phase , plan expand upon previous finding immediate efficacy glutamatergic modulators investigate safety efficacy repeat dose administration IV ketamine infusion patient MDD . We plan include MDD patient regardless antidepressant response single infusion ketamine allow potential identification MDD patient able eventually attain and/or maintain antidepressant response course series infusion . In effort reduce potential bias due partial blinding , patient administer ketamine randomize either group receive ketamine 0.5 mg/kg group receive ketamine 0.1 mg/kg ( active comparator ) . Study Population The study population consist 50 individual 18 65 year age , diagnosis treatment-resistant Major Depressive Disorder ( MDD ) 50 age/gender match healthy volunteer subject ( HV ) . Within MDD group , 25 participant enrol treatment group repeat-dosing phase . Study Design This study Phase I Clinical Trial comprise four phase . Phase I include screening , medication taper ( need ) , medication-free period , baseline assessment . Some baseline assessment include optional test design probe neurobiological function : transcranial magnetic stimulation ( TMS ) test associate evoke potential test ( TMS-EP ) , overnight sleep adaptation sleep lab preparation overnight sleep electroencephalography ( S-EEG ) , psychophysiology paradigm call None , Predictive , Unpredictive ( NPU ) -threat test , blood sample assess plasma neurochemical peripheral blood biomarkers . In Phase II , subject receive alternate series placebo ketamine 0.5 mg/kg infusion , occur per week , total 4 infusion ( 2 ketamine 2 placebo ) . Patients randomize receive either ketamine first placebo first ; subject randomize receive ketamine first infusion receive placebo second infusion vice-versa randomize initially placebo . Concurrently infusion , subject administer either resting-state ( task free ) functional magnetic resonance imaging ( fMRI ) simultaneous electroencephalography ( EEG ) , rest state magnetoencephalography ( MEG ) record subject receives fMRI+EEG MEG placebo ketamine infusion . Of note , subject one imaging modality acquire due unforeseen issue , may still administer . Therefore , subject potentially participate imaging modality , order fMRI+EEG MEG scan counterbalance across participant . Also Phase II , MDD HV participant agree optional testing , S-EEG may obtain one day prior one day first two infusion series , TMS-EP may obtain day first two infusion subsequent test patient responds first two infusion , NPU may obtain 1-3 day first two infusion . Phase III involve participant MDD whose depression symptom relapse final infusion Phase II.. Patients whose symptom relapse may receive additional one-week washout randomization Phase III . During phase , subject randomize receive ketamine high dose 0.5 mg/kg , low dose 0.1 mg/kg ( active comparator ) occur twice weekly 4 additional week total eight infusion . Optional test , include S-EEG , TMS-EP , NPU , may conduct specified time point ketamine infusion . Clinical rating scale administer assess depression symptomology blood drawn pharmacokinetics test biomarker analysis . Phase IV include MDD participant complete Phase III responder ( define MADRS reduce 50 % baseline ) follow additional 4 week , relapse ( defined 2 consecutive rating demonstrate less equal 25 % improvement baseline MADRS ) , determine durability response . The final study day include clinical rating scale , medical evaluation , blood test . As safety measure , sMRI repeat assess structural change may occur result repeat ketamine infusion . Outcome Measures The primary outcome measure Phase II pharmacodynamic fMRI [ ( ph ) fMRI ] MEG responses ketamine 0.5 mg/kg compare placebo . Secondary outcome measure include difference MADRS score baseline 24 hour placebo ketamine 0.5mg/kg infusion , correlation antidepressant response TMS-EP , S-EEG , neuroimaging ( fMRI+EEG MEG ) , psychophysiology ( NPU-threat test ) measure . In Phase II , healthy volunteer ( HV ) group act another level control identify potential neuropharmacodynamic signature associate antidepressant response ketamine . The primary outcome measure Phase III difference change score Montgomery-Asberg Depression Rating Scale ( MADRS ) baseline end 4 week twice-weekly ketamine 0.5 mg/kg compare 0.1 mg/kg . An antidepressant response define reduction least 50 % baseline MADRS . Secondary outcome measure include TMS-EP , S-EEG , psychophysiology ( NPU-threat test ) measure . Other outcome measure Phase II III include clinical rating scale , neurocognitive test , : The Amsterdam Resting-State Questionnaire ( ARSQ ) , Barratt Impulsivity Scale ( BIS ) , Buss-Perry Aggression Questionnaire ( BP ) , Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale ( BPRS ) , Borderline Symptom List ( BSL ) , Clinician-Administered Dissociative State Scale ( CADSS ) , Columbia Suicide Severity Rating Scale ( C-SSRS ) , Childhood Trauma Questionnaire ( CTQ ) , Discontinuation-Emergent Signs Symptoms ( DESS ) , Family History Screen ( FHS ) , Hamilton Anxiety Rating Scale ( HAM-A ) , Hamilton Depression Rating Scale ( HDRS ) , Massachusetts General Hospital Cognitive Physical Functioning Questionnaire ( MGH-CPFQ ) , Positive Negative Affect Schedule ( PANAS ) , Patient-Rated Inventory Side Effects ( PRISE ) , Quick Inventory Depressive Symptomatology ( QIDS ) , Ruminative Rating Scale ( RRS ) , Snaith-Hamilton Pleasure Scale ( SHAPS ) , Young Mania Rating Scale ( YMRS ) , ketamine level ( e.g , ketamine metabolite ) , plasma neurochemical , peripheral blood biomarkers . Additional outcomes Phase III baseline post-repeated dose infusion 3T MRI scan well performance Stroop test , Trail Making Test ( TMT ) , immediate recall assessment California Verbal Learning Test ( CVLT ) , Spatial Span Test . The clinical rating scale outcomes measure Phase IV BIS , BP , BPRS , BSL , CADSS , C-SSRS , CTQ , DESS , HAM-A , HDRS , MADRS , MGH-CPFQ , PANAS , PRISE , QIDS , RRS , SHAPS , YMRS . Subjects continue Phase IV 4 week relapse ( define less equal 25 % decrease MADRS compare baseline two consecutive rating ) .</detailed_description>
