	<brief_summary>For family member chronically critically ill ( CCI ) patient , ICU admission mark significant milestone patient 's illness trajectory highlight onset end of-life issue abrupt need family member assume caregiver role first time . Assuming caregiver role devastate longstanding health consequence family member , impair ability sustain caregiving behavior CCI patient . The unrelenting psychological distress perceive caregiver CCI patient link significant reduction self-management health outcome . The purpose study evaluate theoretically-derived Adaptive SenSor-Based Intervention Caregiver Self-ManagemenT ( ASSIST ) intervention compare attention control condition first time caregiver CCI patient discharge extend care facility . One group expose ASSIST intervention wear sensor-based technology 30 day receive daily dose MMT . Biophysical sensor data ( blood pressure , heart-rate variability , pedometry , actigraphy ) continuously acquire analyzed use anomaly detection machine learn technique vary dose intensity ( number dos per day ) two component ASSIST add real-time , adaptive feature promote caregiver self-management . The group wear sensor-based technology 30 day receive daily dose MMT . The investigator randomly assign participant group .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The investigator conduct randomize controlled trial examine ASSIST intervention compare attention control condition among 20 first time caregiver CCI patient discharge extend care facility . The investigator collect mixed method data baseline ( T1 ) Day 15 ( T2 ) Day 30 ( T3 ) subject enrollment describe change proximal distal outcome . We choose time point capture neural behavioral change associate intervention . The investigator aim : 1 . Determine whether difference distal outcome [ psychological burden ( anxiety , depression , caregiver burden , HRQoL ) , cardiovascular health ( BP HRV ) economic cost ] subject expose ASSIST compare exposed attention control condition . 2 . Examine whether decentering , self-efficacy , decision-making , motivation , caregiver activation , perceive stress mediate relationship exposure self-management condition ( ASSIST vs. attention control ) proximal ( self-management ) outcome ( stress reduction behavior , sleep hygiene behavior , physical activity ) . 3 . Determine social support demographic ( gender age ) moderate proximal outcome [ emotional distress , sleep quality , physical activity ] distal outcome [ psychological burden ( anxiety , depression , caregiver burden , HRQoL ) , cardiovascular health ( BP HRV ) economic cost ] . 4 . Explore difference brain activation ( structural fMRI scan ) HPA function stress response ( hair cortisol , inflammation panel ) subject expose ASSIST compare exposed attention control condition .</detailed_description>
