	<detailed_description>Opioid Use Disorders ( OUDs ) highly prevalent costly public health concern United States , 2.59 million Americans qualify abuse dependence opioids 2015 . Methadone maintenance treatment ( MMT ) , involve daily distribution methadone regulate clinic , common treatment opioid use disorder . While MMT effective help OUD patient improve quality life , overwhelming majority patient continue engage unhealthy lifestyle ( e.g. , physical inactivity cigarette smoking ) lead significant physical mental health morbidity . For example , patient MMT much high rate cardiovascular disease , diabetes , hypertension , obesity , depression , sleep difficulty , cognitive impairment age-matched control , lead premature death . Given mental health , physical health , drug use related benefit physical activity ( PA ) , intervention target increase PA patient receive MMT could significant impact reduce overall morbidity mortality . To date , PA study conduct substance abuse population - , one small pilot study MMT patient . Our goal develop feasible , acceptable effective multilevel PA intervention address individual interpersonal factor easily scalable deliver context health care set ( i.e. , methadone clinic ) . To , propose train MMT patient already engage PA public health recommend level deliver group-based PA intervention physically inactive MMT patient SSTAR Lifeline , large community-based methadone clinic Fall River , Massachusetts . Peer-facilitated intervention self-management skill common care patient chronic medical condition . Peers may play particularly important role increase physical activity MMT , population face unique significant barrier PA ( e.g. , depression , smoking , minimal social support ) . Through development interpersonal relationship , investigator expect MMT peer successfully navigate challenge help physically inactive MMT patient increase self-efficacy motivation initiate sustain PA . The aim study include : 1 . PHASE 1 ( Peer-PA Manual Development ) : - To develop theoretically-informed peer-facilitated PA plus Fitbit ( Peer-PA+Fitbit ) intervention specific SSTAR Lifeline , order help patient MMT increase level physical activity . 1 . We conduct focus group : 1 ) MMT patient currently physically active 2 ) MMT patient NOT meet recommend PA level help inform intervention development . 2 . We ( 1 ) develop manualized Peer-PA intervention ( include use Fitbit activity monitor self-monitoring PA additional social networking ) , ( 2 ) create training protocol MMT patient become peer-facilitators , ( 3 ) identify safe , walkable path participant neighborhood . 2 . PHASE 2 ( Open Pilot ) : - To conduct open pilot trial 20 MMT patient determine feasibility , acceptability , shortterm increase PA Peer-PA+Fitbit intervention . At end 3 month : 1 . We obtain feedback Peer-PA+Fitbit MMT peer participant self-report measure qualitative interview . 2 . We determine adherence intervention group attendance Fitbit data . 3 . We examine short-term increase physical activity level objectively measure PA .</detailed_description>
