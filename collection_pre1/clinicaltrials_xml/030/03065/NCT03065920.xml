	<detailed_description>This study prospective observational multicentre cohort study asthma patient Eastern Africa . whose objective ; The primary objective project identify characterize severe asthma Eastern Africa order understand demographic , clinical , physiologic , pathologic , genomic immunologic determinant . Secondary objective ( ) ; Compare annual healthcare utilisation ( HCU ) ( emergency room visit , hospitalization include admission critical care unit unscheduled outpatient clinic office visit ) , exacerbation , quality life mortality rate severe not- severe asthma patient Determine factor associate asthma HCU event , quality life , exacerbation mortality . The study enroll 1676 patient age 12 70 year follow patient one year . Measurements ; The follow do - Asthma Diagnosis . This do entry point study . It do ensure patient enrol onto study fulfill clinical diagnosis Asthma . - Cohort Characterisation . Through use predeveloped clinical review form , data demographic , symptom , exposures pollutant , know asthma trigger , tobacco smoking , psychosocial issue , comorbidities , asthma control , adherence medication inhaler technique collect . Asthma quality life also ascertain use questionnaire . Further measurement characterise asthma perform include ; - Spirometry - Bronchial hyperresponsiveness test use methacholine challenge test - Skin prick test ( SPT ) , total IgE assay complete blood count ( eosinophil ) - FeNO airway inflammation accord publish guideline . - Stool microscopy helminth infestation - Replicative single nucleotide polymorphism ( SNP ) genotying - HIV test Each patient follow interval ( initially monthly 6 month month 9 12 ) . At clinic visit , treatment optimise .</detailed_description>
