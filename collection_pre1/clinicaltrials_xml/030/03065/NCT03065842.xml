	<detailed_description>Today , abortion one common practice within gynaecological care . Despite existence across time persistence across geographic location , impact abortion woman , family , community societies differs lot across world . Safe abortion - do trained provider hygienic setting particularly early medical abortion carry few health risk . In country like Sweden , Romania , Nepal South Africa , liberalisation abortion law direct positive impact maternal mortality . Yet , approximately half 42 million abortion take place every year unsafe . Nearly one five maternal death attribute unsafe abortion , 500 woman per 100,000 live birth die consequence unsafe abortion . There inherent need invest intervention strategy improve maternal health , especially amongst youth . Until recently , abortion legally permissible Kenya save life woman , new constitution adopt 2010 make abortion available protect woman 's health . Article 43 constitution widen access reproductive health right , every person right high attainable standard health , include right health care service , include reproductive health care . However , contraceptive use remain low Kenya . Consequently unwanted pregnancy unsafe abortion common , many require medical care complication . A Kenyan woman one 55 chance die pregnancy related cause lifetime , 360 woman per 100,000 live birth die . Sexuality education part general education . Its preventive nature contribute prevention negative consequence link sexuality , also improve quality life , health well-being . In way , sexuality education contribute health promotion general . In country SRE school compulsory , example Sweden . In Kenya , SRE compulsory teacher education . Many teacher receive additional training , although training focus teach HIV/AIDS . Oginga ( 2014 ) recommend SRE need incorporate compulsory teacher-training curriculum Kenya . While extensive research investigate public health consequence unwanted pregnancy unsafe abortion human right perspective , little research stigma relate contraceptive use abortion among youth . Causes abortion stigma negative gender stereotype , intent control female sexuality , compulsory motherhood - social construct deconstruct . Women 's subordinate status society negative implication woman 's sexual reproductive health right ( SRHR ) . Although lack research stigma relate contraceptive use abortion reduce , occurrence stigma widely acknowledge many country . Few conceptual methodological tool exist measure effect . For many year , International Planned Parenthood Federation ( IPPF ) , together partner organization , implement programme specifically address combat HIV stigma . In past five year increase global attention abortion stigma . IPPF thus expand work address impact negative belief attitude abortion access , scale-up , safe abortion service . Abortion stigma manifest many level , individual service provider community , institution , law policy , wider public discourse include medium . In 2013 , Ipas develop scale measure abortion stigma individual community level , Stigmatizing Attitudes , Beliefs Actions Scale ( SABAS ) , inform development intervention mitigate stigma . PROJECT DESCRIPTION Purpose Aims This project multi-methods approach , qualitative quantitative quasi-experimental pre- post-intervention design . The purpose empirically determine role stigma relate abortion contraceptive use play , express , counter effectively . Firstly , aim conceptualize abortion stigma , among health care provider YFC , among teacher student secondary school . Secondly , determine school base intervention , compare usual standard , decrease abortion- contraceptive-use stigma increase contraceptive use among sexually active secondary school student . METHODOLOGY The social political sensitivity surround induced abortion make difficult conduct high-quality research measure incidence relate stigma , automatically introduce bias result . Surveys provider also problematic number reason , example country safe abortion illegal obvious reason ( fear prosecution ) . Therefore investigator choose use qualitative- quantitative approach ( data triangulation ) conceptualize abortion contraceptive use stigma , estimate validate incidence . Design : I ) qualitative approach Focus Group Discussions ( FGDs ) , II ) quantitative quasi-experimental pre- post-intervention study design , compare student attitude intervention school match control school use . Tool : SABA-scale used ass attitude behaviour baseline ( pre-test ) post-test 1 12 month . Primary outcome : Abortion-stigma . Secondary outcome : Contraceptive-use stigma . Settings : Potential school semi-urban settlement county Kisumu , identify accord study site , size academic standard ( public school ) . The school order alphabetically name import statistical computer software IT-assistant Kisumu Medical Educational Trust ( KMET ) , Kisumu . The software randomly generate allocation schedule assignment stigma reduction intervention one school , one operate control school . This area dominance Christian religion , Luo , Luhya Kisii ethnic group , low socio-economic status ( SES ) reflect regional profile . Participants : I ) Service provider ( n=12 ) YFC , secondary school teacher ( n=16 ) participate gender mixed FGDs , student ( female , n=10 ; male , n=10 ) , II ) secondary school student 14 20 year ( n=200 male student ; 200 female student ) , include intervention unit , number control unit . Measurements : The Stigmatizing Attitudes , Beliefs Actions Scale ( SABAS ) tool design measure abortion stigma individual community level . A 57-item instrument create 2013 , pre-tested , administer 531 individual ( n=250 Ghana n=281 Zambia ) . All analysis complete use Stata IC/11.2 . SABAS capture three important dimension abortion stigma : negative stereotype ( 8 item ) , discrimination exclusion ( 7 item ) , potential contagion ( 3 item ) ( 1 ) . IPPF adapt Stigmatising Attitude , Beliefs Actions Scale ( SABAS ) develop Ipas measure abortion stigma amongst community member project area Benin , Burkina Faso , India Pakistan outset end Packard Foundation abortion stigma project 2014-2016 . The response categories SABAS Likert format `` strongly disagree '' `` strongly agree '' response assign value range 1-5 . The tool use several way : example baseline and/or endline data collection stigma-reduction intervention `` pre post-test '' measure short-term change individual and/or community level . The SABA tool modify adapt tool context setting . In addition new question draft target gender stereotype related girl contraceptive-use misconception ( include condom use ) last sexual intercourse ( yes/no ) . These question draft collaboration provider , teacher student , study I ( FGD ) . This adapted tool use baseline ( pre-test ) post-test 1 12 month , measure short- long-term change group- individual level . Analysis sample size calculation : Study I ) data qualitatively analyse accord guide explore contraceptive- abortion-related stigma . Study II ) . The sample size re-calculated method take account intracluster correlation coefficient , number event , expect effect , power study . In addition , plan add new question regard contraceptive stigma ( secondary outcome ) , adjust lose follow ( 20 % ) .To identify relevant reduction abortion stigma ( one-sided t-test ) , use 95 % CI ( α=0.05 ) , sample size preliminary calculate 200 female 200 male school , intervention/control ( 90 % power ) . The outcome intervention analyse quantitatively accord Shellenberg et al ( 2013 ) . A high score SABAS represent stigmatize attitude beliefs . There predetermined cut-off threshold represent stigma . The result guide u use score continuous variable create cut-offs appropriate context/setting . For continuous variable , intervention effect analyze use repeat measure ANOVA ( PASW 20.0 ) , significant p-value &gt; 0.05 . Within-subjects factor : time . Between-subjects factor : intervention vs. control . Dependent variable : SABAS attitude , beliefs action item .

PRINCIPLE INVESTIGATORS Marlene Makenzius Sweden Monica Oguttu Kenya . SIGNIFICANCE IN KENYA The complication unsafe abortion continue pose serious threat Kenyan woman 's health . Nearly 120,000 woman receive care health facility complication result unsafe abortion 2012 , correspond induced abortion ratio 30 abortion per 100 birth 2012 . Severe complication unsafe abortion common among woman age 10-19 . More 70 % woman seek post-abortion care use method contraception prior become pregnant . The investigator believe potential benefit study high community level well individual level . The participant may also benefit intervention target contraceptive use may thus reduce unwanted pregnancy . Unwanted pregnancy undermines young people ' ( especially woman 's ) schooling , health , social status future opportunity work . Young people therefore benefit reduced abortion-stigma increase contraceptive use . In addition , Kisumu study - Encourage SRH part regular curriculum secondary school . - Encourage male involvement health-seeking practice woman 's reproductive health . - Increase access contraceptive-use among student . - Identify empower representative community ; school- church leader , open meeting public ( Baraza ) , sensitize influence community problem unsafe abortion low contraceptive use . - Establishment environment capacity among international , national regional research actor lead NGO 's mitigate gap knowledge practice prevention unsafe abortion . - Enable woman within project undergo research training facilitate development local regional academic competence . - Create awareness gender equality perspective research .</detailed_description>
