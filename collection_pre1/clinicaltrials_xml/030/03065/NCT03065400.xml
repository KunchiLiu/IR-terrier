	<brief_summary>The purpose study test effectiveness drug call pembrolizumab patient Myeloproliferative Neoplasm ( MPN ) ; chronic phase ( MF-CP ) , accelerate phase ( MPN-AP ) , blast phase ( MF-BP ) . Myelofibrosis neoplasm ( MPN ) group diseases bone marrow excessive cell produce . Pembrolizumab also know Keytruda drug recently approve United Stated Food Drug Administration ( FDA ) treatment patient unresectable metastatic melanoma disease progression . Pembrolizumab experimental treatment MPN . The researcher want find effect , good /or bad participant disease . Participants qualify take part research study diagnose MPN blood disorder call myelofibrosis ( MF ) . Accelerated ( 10-19 % blast blood bone marrow ) blast phase ( &gt; 20 % blast blood bone marrow ) MPN difficult disease treat . The term `` blast '' refers immature cell find bone marrow . They fully develop , therefore , yet carry particular function within body . Funds conduct research provide Merck Company , manufacturer study drug pembrolizumab .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The researcher propose Simon-two stage design study . The researcher test pembrolizumab FDA approve dose ( head neck cancer ) 200mg dose administer via intravenous infusion 30 minute give every 3 week . Nine patient enrol first stage Simon-two stage design , 15 second stage . A treatment cycle 3 week core study period 6 cycle . Response assessment establish consensus criterion use assess response 6 cycle order determine trial progress second stage purpose determine primary endpoint . In addition , allow maximum ten patient accelerate blast phase disease ( MPN-AP/BP ) refractory intolerant conventional therapy decitabine , hematopoietic stem cell transplant therapeutic option ( exploratory cohort ) , enroll study separate exploratory cohort . These patient enrol stage 1 2 analyze separately primary cohort population . Exploratory biomarkers obtain enrolled patient baseline , cycle 3 cycle 7 1 year therapy . Patients obtain least clinical improvement 6 cycle therapy continue receive pembrolizumab evidence disease progression , unacceptable toxicity , patient physician decision maximum 2 year .</detailed_description>

If diagnosis MFCP , must Dynamic International Prognostic Scoring System ( DIPSS ) intermediate2/high risk disease either intolerant/resistant ruxolitinib determine treat investigator ineligible ruxolitinib therapy determine treat investigator . If diagnosis MPNAP/BP , must progressive/resistant disease treatment DNMT1 inhibitor therapy ( azacytidine , decitabine ) determine treat investigator . Either eligible unwilling proceed hematopoietic stem cell transplantation ( HSCT ) Have performance status 0 1 ECOG Performance Scale . Demonstrate adequate organ function define Table 1 , screen lab perform within 10 day treatment initiation . Female subject childbearing potential negative urine serum pregnancy within 72 hour prior receive first dose study medication . If urine test positive confirm negative , serum pregnancy test require . Female subject childbearing potential willing use 2 method birth control surgically sterile , abstain heterosexual activity course study 120 day last dose study medication ( Reference Section 5.7.2 ) . Subjects childbearing potential surgically sterilize free menses &gt; 1 year . Male subject agree use adequate method contraception start first dose study therapy 120 day last dose study therapy . Is currently participate receive study therapy participate study investigational agent receive study therapy use investigational device within 4 week first dose treatment . Is immediate family member ( e.g. , spouse , parent/legal guardian , sibling , child ) investigational site sponsor staff directly involve trial , unless prospective IRB approval ( chair designee ) give allow exception criterion specific subject . Has diagnosis immunodeficiency receive systemic steroid therapy form immunosuppressive therapy within 7 day prior first dose trial treatment . Has know history active TB ( Bacillus Tuberculosis ) Hypersensitivity pembrolizumab excipients . Has prior anticancer monoclonal antibody ( mAb ) within 4 week prior study Day 1 recover ( i.e. , = Grade 1 baseline ) adverse event due agent administer 4 week earlier . Has prior chemotherapy , target small molecule therapy , radiation therapy within 2 week prior study Day 1 recover ( i.e. , = Grade 1 baseline ) adverse event due previously administer agent . 1 . Note : Subjects = Grade 2 neuropathy exception criterion may qualify study . 2 . Note : If subject receive major surgery , must recover adequately toxicity and/or complication intervention prior start therapy . Has know additional malignancy progress require active treatment . Exceptions include basal cell carcinoma skin squamous cell carcinoma skin undergone potentially curative therapy situ cervical cancer . Has active autoimmune disease require systemic treatment past 2 year ( i.e . use disease modify agent , corticosteroid immunosuppressive drug ) . Replacement therapy ( eg. , thyroxine , insulin , physiologic corticosteroid replacement therapy adrenal pituitary insufficiency , etc . ) consider form systemic treatment .
