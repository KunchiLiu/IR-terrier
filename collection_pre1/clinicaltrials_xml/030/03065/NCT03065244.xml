	<brief_summary>Kawasaki disease ( KD ) self-limited illness affect heart blood vessel ( coronary artery ) infant child common cause acquire heart disease child . A mixture proteins human blood ( Intravenous immunoglobulin , IVIG ) treatment reduces rate major complication disease : bulging wall coronary artery call aneurysm . However , 10-20 % child resistant treatment fever return . These child high rate aneurysm formation thus treat aggressively . Unfortunately , guideline best secondary treatment resistant patient problem never adequately study . Most physician choose either second infusion IVIG engineer antibody call infliximab inactivates molecule promotes inflammation . This trial randomize ( assign chance like flip coin ) IVIG-resistant patient receive either second IVIG infusion infliximab response treatment compare learn treatment stop fever fast . In addition , parent caregiver provide observation child 's response different treatment .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>This 3-year ( 2.75-years enrollment ) , Phase III , two-arm , randomize , multi-center , superiority treatment study compare infliximab second intravenous immunoglobulin ( IVIG ) infusion treatment persistent recrudescent fever child KD fail become afebrile first IVIG infusion . 1 . Specific aim 1 test hypothesis infliximab superior second intravenous immunoglobulin ( IVIG ) infusion treatment persistent recrudescent fever child KD fail become afebrile first IVIG infusion ( resistant KD ) . Cessation fever ( &lt; 38°C rectally orally ) within 24h initiation study treatment infusion primary outcome measure . 2 . Specific aim 2 test hypothesis infliximab treatment result rapid resolution inflammation compare second IVIG measure change white blood cell count ( WBC ) , absolute neutrophil count ( ANC ) , high-sensitivity C-reactive protein ( hsCRP ) concentration baseline 24 hour 2 week follow study treatment . 3 . Specific aim 3 test hypothesis infliximab treatment result reduction baseline coronary artery Zworst score ≥ 0.05 standard deviation unit compare second IVIG 2 week follow study treatment measure echocardiography .</detailed_description>
