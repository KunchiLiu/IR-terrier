	<brief_summary>Purpose This trial study association SBT subgroups postural stability . It theorize cognitive impairment pronounce among patient SBT group three compare SBT group one two . Therefore , hypothesize challenge patient ' balance great impact postural sway among patient SBT group three compare SBT group one two condition sensory information reduce cognitive load increase .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>The Association Between STarT Back Tool Subgroups Postural Stability</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Globally low back pain ( LBP ) neck pain leading cause disability ( 1 ) . Consequently , improvement assessment treatment LBP extensive impact . Patients LBP constitute heterogeneous group improve treatment much focus identify subgroup patient tailor treatment accordingly . An example STarT Back Tool ( SBT ) translate 20 language probably use tool subgrouping patient LBP . The SBT sub-groups patient three group progress need treatment . Patients group one give information LBP advice stay active , patient group two also recommend supplementary treatment primary care , addition patient group three need attention psycho-social issue ( 2-3 ) . Accordingly SBT , patient group three treat cognitive therapy physiotherapist undergo special training . This training include mentorship professional support enable physiotherapist elicit address complex issue patient psycho-social barrier recovery . Subgrouping SBT thereby treat patient group three cognitive therapy find effective improve functional outcome ( 4-5 ) . Patients LBP find different postural control strategies patient without LBP especially task involve increase task complexity ( 6-7 ) . However , study find decreased postural control among patient whit LBP ( 8-9 ) . Heterogeneous study population may explain discrepancy finding especially subgroups patient LBP affect postural control subgroup affect . Patients pain often present degree cognitive impairment could limit extent daily activity could perform . This may particularly present among SBT group three patient . Cognitive impairment associate decreased function consequently reduce balance elderly , indicate postural stability require significant amount cognitive resource . Since cognitive resource limit , additional task compete resource , performance one task become affected . The conscious interpretation ( attention towards ) painful stimulation costly process us significant amount cognitive resource available could impair physical performance . Consequently , may lead additional postural sway thereby restrict balance . After give write informed consent patient fill questionnaire include age , gender , educational level ( bachelor , yes/no ) , employment , sick leave , co-morbidity ( LBP , yes/no ) , pain duration ( 2-6 weeks/sub-acute chronic ) , pain intensity ( NPR ) , Roland Morris Disability Questionnaire ( 23 question , RMDQ ) , self-reported health status ( EQ-5D visual analogue scale ) . After fill questionnaire patient ask take jacket shoe empty pocket , measure height , weight , test static balance . Postural sway measure use force plate ( Metitur Good Balance SystemÂ® ) . The force plate place distance 100 cm wall front patient 100 cm free space side behind force plate . The force plate , equilateral triangle ( 800 mm ) , four strain gauge transducer signal convert three-channel DC amplifier transform digital data ( 50 Hz ) subsequently filter digitally , use three-point median filter IRR filter , 20 Hz cut-off frequency . On wall front patient 12 cm circular green plate place patient ' eye level . Patients ask stand foot close position possible , without lift foot , focus green plate front . Patients ask replicate position test . The static balance test require subject stand quiet possible 35 second 4 different condition follow order : ( ) eye open easy counting , ( ii ) eye close easy counting , ( iii ) eye close count multiple seven , ( iv ) eye close count backward 500 multiple seven . The force platform , scale , person altimeter calibrate every fortnight frequent . Data extract , check abnormal discrepancy , save secure driver frequently ( least every fortnight ) .</detailed_description>
