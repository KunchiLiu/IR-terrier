	<brief_title>Risk Stratification Primary Care Combined With Stratified-specific Physical Therapy Care Low Back Pain</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The University Vermont Health Network five hospital network serve primarily rural population approximately 1 million people Vermont upstate New York . The primary aim prospective , longitudinal , pragmatic , non-randomized cluster , non-blinded , controlled trial examine whether PT treatment stratify match patient 's risk factor base STarT Back Tool effective current treatment primary care non-specific low back pain ( LBP ) improve short- ( 6 month ) long-term ( 12-month ) patient outcome ( disability ) . To risk stratification , investigator use STarT Back Tool design primary care setting validate non-specific LBP ( acute flare-up chronic pain ) . The tool design identify prognostic risk ( low , medium , high ) progression chronic LBP . In addition , tool assist clinicians decision make ensure low risk patient treat medicalized , 'at risk ' patient get access right provider early enhance care give complex case . Thus , tool assist match 'right patient right treatment ' 'right time ' critical give high prevalence cost LBP . Patients primary diagnosis LBP ( acute flare-up chronic ) see six Family Medicine sit complete STarT Back Tool Modified Low Back Pain Disability Questionnaire ( mODI ) . With non-randomized , cluster design , three Family Medicine sit identify `` Participating Sites '' three identify `` Comparator Sites . '' Patients low back pain `` Participating Sites '' stratify medium- high-risk patient refer physical therapy ( PT ) match ( i.e. , stratified-specific treatment ) . Those patient identify low-risk retain Family Medicine management use advice , reassurance , patient education , NSAIDs ( image specialist referral encourage ) . Patients low back pain `` Comparator Sites '' manage accord current care practice Family Medicine . Using mODI , investigator compare two study arm short- ( 6 month ) long-term point ( 12 month ) .</detailed_description>
