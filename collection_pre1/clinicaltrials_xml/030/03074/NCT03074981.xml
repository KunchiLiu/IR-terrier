	<brief_summary>Difficult heal wound common complex medical problem , cause suffer patient challenge medical , social economic burden health system . Based data western world , estimate Israel , give time , 30 60 thousand patient difficult heal wound . Among diabetic patient , estimate 15 % 25 % develop difficult heal foot wound live time . The medical definition difficult heal wound : wound show sign recovery 4-6 week treatment . Most wound cause anaerobic bacteria invention . One method treatment difficult heal wound - ROI-RNPT ( Regulated Oxygen -Enriched &amp; Irrigation Negative Pressure -Assisted Wound Therapy ) . This method create wound negative pressure presence oxygen irrigation apply directly wound bed . As part wound closure process investigator use `` external tissue expansion '' . This method clinical use exercise - `` Top Closure '' `` tension relief system '' ( TRS ) . In study , investigator intend investigate whether ROI-NPT system combine TopClosure , effective treatment difficult heal wound , compare method currently use .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>1 . The investigator debride wound necessary . Wound biopsies take determine exist pathogen direct antibiotic treatment . 2 . Wound measurement take ( Width , length depth ) . 3 . Afterwards wound closed TopClosure device patient connect Negative Wound pressure device Vcare Alpha . 4. investigator change dressing accord schedule . If wound clean investigator change dressing every 3-5 day . If wound infect investigator change dressing every 2-4 day . If investigator encounter severe infect wound lot pu investigator change dressing every 1-3 day . 5. investigator determine time heal wound clean need Negative Pressure Wound Treatment ( ROI-NPR ) 10 week .</detailed_description>
