	<brief_summary>Objective : To investigate effect 5 week dapagliflozin 10 mg daily treatment glucose lipid flux patient type 2 diabetes . Study design : Single center single arm ( mechanistic ) intervention trial . Study Population : Male postmenopausal female patient type 2 diabetes BMI &gt; 25 kg/m2and 12 week stable dose metformin treatment &gt; 1500mg , HbA1C ≥6.5 % - &lt; 8.5 % , Fasting Plasma Glucose ( FPG ) &lt; 13.2 mmol/l , LDL cholesterol &gt; 2.5 mmol/l , willing switch rosuvastatin 10mg daily 4 week , receive 10 mg dapagliflozin daily orally , 5 week . Treatment : After statin washout fase 4 week , baseline cholesterol synthesis measure ( 2H3 Leucine , 2H2O deuterated water ) . Then , treatment rosuvastatin 10mg 4 week initiate , patient undergo glucose ( 2H2enriched glucose ) lipid flux ( 2H3 Leucine , 2H2O deuterated water oral 1,2,3,4-13C16 - palmitate enrichment measurement ) follow 5 week treatment dapagliflozin 10mg daily . In final week glucose/lipid flux measurement repeat . Sample Size : 12 DM2 subject . Outcome measure : The primary endpoint effect 5 week Sodium-Glucose Linked co-transporter ( SGLT ) 2 inhibition LDL cholesterol synthesis patient DM2 . Secondary endpoint effect SGLT2 inhibition triglyceride cholesterol flux well ( hepatic peripheral ) insulin sensitivity energy expenditure . Finally , effect SGLT2 inhibition dietary intake , liver fat content ( MRI liver ) fecal microbiome study timepoints .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Dapagliflozin Cholesterol Metabolism Type 2 Diabetes ( DM2 )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Background : Type 2 diabetes associate increase cardiovascular risk . Besides metformin , new treatment strategy oral SGLT2 inhibition ( dapagliflozin ) , Although recently publish , first-in-class cardiovascular outcome trial ( EMPA-REG OUTCOME ) suggest beneficial effect cause cardiovascular mortality upon SGLT2 inhibition , know ( class ) side effect worsen dyslipidemia DM2 patient . The investigator thus aim dissect effect SGLT2 inhibition ( Dapagliflozin 10mg daily 5 week ) glucose lipid flux uncomplicated DM2 subject . Objective : To investigate effect 5 week dapagliflozin 10 mg daily treatment glucose lipid flux patient type 2 diabetes . Study design : Single center single arm ( mechanistic ) intervention trial . Study Population : Male postmenopausal female patient type 2 diabetes BMI &gt; 25 kg/m2and 12 week stable dose metformin treatment &gt; 1500mg , HbA1C ≥6.5 % - &lt; 8.5 % , FPG &lt; 13.2 mmol/l , LDL cholesterol &gt; 2.5 mmol/l , willing switch rosuvastatin 10mg daily 4 week , receive 10 mg dapagliflozin daily orally , 5 week . Treatment : After statin washout fase 4 week , baseline cholesterol synthesis measure ( 2H3 Leucine , 2H2O deuterated water ) . Then , treatment rosuvastatin 10mg 4 week initiate , patient undergo glucose ( 2H2enriched glucose ) lipid flux ( 2H3 Leucine , 2H2O deuterated water oral 1,2,3,4-13C16 - palmitate enrichment measurement ) follow 5 week treatment dapagliflozin 10mg daily . In final week glucose/lipid flux measurement repeat . Outcome measure : The primary endpoint effect 5 week SLGT2 inhibition LDL cholesterol synthesis patient DM2 . Secondary endpoint effect SGLT2 inhibition triglyceride cholesterol flux well ( hepatic peripheral ) insulin sensitivity energy expenditure . Finally , effect SGLT2 inhibition dietary intake , liver fat content ( MRI liver ) fecal microbiome study timepoints . Sample Size : Based publish data , investigator expect 10 % high plasma LDL level ( 3.1 ± 0.8 1.7 ± 0.4 mmol/l ) upon SGLT2 inhibition DM2 . DM2 subject concomitant LDL- ApoB synthesis ( 1.8 ± 0.4 gram/day ) 4 week rosuvastatin 10mg . Assuming increase LDL-apoB synthesis 0.3 gram/day SD 0.4 use single-sided test ( alfa 0.05 85 % power ) , sample size need 11 DM2 subject dapagliflozin 10mg treatment . Taking 10 % patient dropout rate , aim include 12 DM2 subject total . Nature extent burden risk associate participation , benefit group relatedness : The risk patient participate study minimal . All stable isotope GMP produce analysis technique previously use publish investigator . Also , REE liver MRI measurement associated adverse event . Both rosuvastatin dapagliflozin approve FDA/EMA widely prescribe . In total 470 ml blood ( 100 ml per lipidflux day , 90 ml per clamp day ) drawn period 13 week ( divide 5 visit ) .</detailed_description>
