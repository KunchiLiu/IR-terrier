	<detailed_description>The role hypnosis ( sedative drug administer ) hypnosedative procedure ( hypnosis adjunct sedative drug ) surgical procedure largely discuss past 10 year , technique widely practice surgical field , example thyroidectomy . In neurosurgery specifically , successful use hypnosedation awake neurosurgical procedure recently report , positive feedback patient , together good result regard extent resection , case brain lesion locate eloquent area . Since 1990 , many research group identify existence hypnosis-related phenomenon influence pain signal perception . These author show modulation anterior cingulate area activity together modify interconnectivity critical region involve nociception . In context , potential hypnosis pain modulation , extensively , patient management surgical anesthetic establish . In various neurosurgical procedure , use stereotactic frame require ; use coordinate ( x , z ) , compute report frame intervention , possible set precise target ( dependent type surgery ) reach surgeon . For instance , Deep Brain Stimulation ( DBS ) perform patient suffer Parkinson 's disease ( PD ) , electrodes introduce brain , deep sub-thalamic nucleus ( STN ) , situate little area locate upper brainstem . The mount stereotactic frame patient 's head perform local anesthesia ( LA ) , patient awake mount procedure later surgical intervention . This mount do screw device directly patient 's skull , skin . This moment report `` painful '' `` extremely painful '' patient , confess keep unpleasant memory event , even several year procedure despite fact surgery positive effect functional outcome . As exposed , still room improvement management pain comfort patient undergoing functional procedure neurosurgery , especially placement stereotactic frame . To opinion , hypnosis could represent serious therapy pain anxiety generate frame fixation , especially facial expression feeling might alter pathology ( i.e . Parkinson 's disease ) . In fact , technique already abundantly report important adjuvant management pain comfort surgery thyroidectomy ) resection brain tumor . The main objective study determine whether hypnosis effective decreasing pain perceive patient placement stereotactic frame patient 's head . The secondary aim study : 1 ) measure stress perceive procedure submit patient validated score 2 ) evaluate incidence Post-traumatic Stress Disorder ( PTSD ) , accord Diagnostic Statistical Manual Mental Disorders IV ( DSM-IV ) criterion .</detailed_description>
