	<brief_title>The FAIS-Trial : Faecal Transplantation Adolescents With Refractory Irritable Bowel Syndrome</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Irritable bowel syndrome ( IBS ) chronic disorder characterize abdominal pain discomfort associate change stool form frequency , absence biochemical structural explanation symptom . The prevalence IBS general adult population 9.8-12.8 % , accordance prevalence IBS child adolescent ( 6.2 % -11.9 % ) . Patients IBS report decrease quality life , high work school absence , risk healthy control develop depressive anxiety disorder . Consequently , healthcare cost substantial ; annual cost care adult IBS USA estimate $ 20 billion . Total annual cost per paediatric IBS patient Netherlands estimate €2500 . Although pathophysiology IBS fully elucidate , pathophysiological abnormal gastrointestinal motility , visceral hypersensitivity , alter brain-gut function , low-grade inflammation , psychosocial disturbance intestinal microbiota characteristic propose contribute pathophysiology . Current treatment focus abnormal gastrointestinal motility , alter brain-gut function psychosocial disturbance . However , significant amount IBS patient remain symptom , despite treatment regimen . These patient consider therapy-resistant , also call refractory . Treatment focus component underlie pathophysiology , intestinal microbiota , might therefore lead new therapeutic success group patient . In light , able modify intestinal microbiota inrefractory IBS patient could beneficial effect symptom . Faecal transplantation , relatively new treatment regimen enable modification microbiome , show highly effective treat Clostridium difficile infection also yield promising result patient diseases diabetes . Objective : To investigate whether two faecal transplantation either allogeneic ( healthy ) autologous ( ) donor , administer nasoduodenal tube , beneficial effect irritable bowel syndrome ( IBS ) symptoms abdominal pain frequency severity . Secondary objective study microbiota change faeces sample . Study design : Double-blind randomise placebo-controlled pilot study well reverse translational part . Study Population : Patients refractory IBS , define failure improve standard medical treatment , least 6 session psychological therapy absence response least 1 pharmacological agent ( age 16-21 year , male/female , concomitant medication , non-smoking ) , recruit ( paediatric ) gastroenterologist Academic Medical Centre ( Amsterdam , Netherlands ) patient hospital enrol . Donors : relatives volunteer serve faeces donor , potential donor thoroughly screen . Treatment : After bowel lavage Klean-Prep , patient treat faecal transplantation t=0 t=6 week , process duodenal tube infusion . Faeces collect healthy donor ( allogeneic ) well patient him/herself ( autologous ) , faeces use placebo .</detailed_description>
