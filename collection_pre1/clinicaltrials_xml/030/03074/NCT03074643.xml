	<detailed_description>The study use 3-group design 225 obese ( BMI 30-45 kg/m2 ) , old ( 65-79 year ) men woman risk disability ( SPPB ≤10 ) undergo 6-month weight loss intervention follow 12-month follow-up phase test overall hypothesis high protein ( 1.2 g/kg body wt/d ) / low carbohydrate ( CHO ) diet 6-month weight loss intervention improve physical function compare isocaloric low protein ( current Recommended Dietary Allowance ( RDA ) , 0.8 g/kg body wt/d ) / high CHO diet , whether continue high protein / low CHO diet 12-months follow weight loss result well maintenance improved physical function . All participant undergo 6-month weight loss intervention involve caloric restriction supervise exercise follow 12 month follow-up randomization one three group ( n=75/group ) : 1 ) Lower protein / high CHO diet 6-month weight loss phase ( RecProt ) ; 2 ) Higher protein / low CHO diet 6-month weight loss phase ( 6-mo HiProt ) ; 3 ) Higher protein / low CHO diet 6-month weight loss 12-month follow-up phase ( 18-mo HiProt ) . Physical function ( primary aim ) assess expand Short Physical Performance Battery ( primary outcome ) low extremity muscle strength power baseline , 6- , 12- 18-months . Weight loss maintenance body composition ( secondary aim ) assess dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry ( DXA ) compute tomography ( CT ) baseline , 6- 18-months . Bone mineral density ( DXA ) cardiometabolic risk factor also measure baseline , 6- 18-months .</detailed_description>
