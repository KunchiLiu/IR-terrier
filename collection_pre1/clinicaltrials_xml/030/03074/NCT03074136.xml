	<detailed_description>Background Significance The pulp necrosis permanent immature teeth implies interruption root formation apical closure . It necessary implement therapy induce calcify barrier apical end root . The endodontic management permanent immature teeth fraught challenge . Although treatment modality vital pulp therapy teeth provide long-term favorable outcome , outcomes treatment pulp necrosis apical periodontitis significantly less predictable . Key role microorganism cause development pulpal periapical disease demonstrate , presence canal time definitive filling negative effect success therapy . However , specificity microbial load immature permanent teeth completely investigate , influence disinfection protocol treatment success . Available procedure rely heavily root canal chemical disinfection root canal system , minimal mechanical instrumentation . Sodium hypochlorite ( NaOCl ) different concentration accept solution disinfection root canal endodontic . Despite common usage , impossibility NaOCl completely disinfect root canal notice . Traditionally , irrigants medicament choose maximum antimicrobial effect without consideration effect stem cell dentinal microenvironment . The balance disinfection creation intracanal microenvironment conducive proliferation stem cell require investigation . This require interpretation preclinical study , level evidence increase randomize controlled clinical study . Diode laser use many area dentistry , tendency good result canal dentine disinfection . The bactericidal effect high-power laser base dose dependent heat generation . Its antimicrobial effectiveness diverse microorganism already demonstrate . Photodynamic therapy ( PDT ) two-step therapeutic approach start application photosensitize agent follow irradiation light energy spectrally matched activate drug . Because high antibacterial potential , usage photodynamic therapy advance standard protocol root canal disinfection suggest . Studies show positive effect photodynamic therapy reduction microbial load root canal treatment . When photoactive compound apply root canal system , take residual bacteria main canal , isthmus , lateral canal dentinal tubule . It also possible compound may escape periapical tissue . During PDT , light excite drug bacteria within root canal , could also potentially affect apical stem cell take drug . Therefore , important determine therapeutic window whereby host cell leave intact . Several study show wide-ranging spectra desirable effect low level power laser ( LLLT ) biological tissue . It report increase cell functional activity , induce cell proliferation , lower inflammation , release endorphin , thus analgetic effect . Furthermore , show irradiation LLLT follow photosensitization phenothiazine chloride negative effect growth differentiation human osteoblastic cell , counteract biostimulatory effect induce LLLT . There statistically significant difference growth differentiation behavior two study group . Further investigation PDT dental stem cell need determine possible biostimulative effect proliferation differentiation , thereby contribute root development non-vital permanent immature teeth . Prolonged treatment young permanent teeth increase possibility treatment failure . Involvement method could help heal process desirable .</detailed_description>
