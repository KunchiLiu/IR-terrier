	<criteria>Subjects eligible include study meet follow criterion : 1 . Subjects males female ≥ 18 year age . 2 . Subjects able give write informed consent . 3 . Subjects document diagnosis MDS accord WHO criterion . 4 . Subjects Revised International Prognostic Scoring System ( IPSSR ) categories Very Low , Low Intermediaterisk disease . Subjects cytogenetic failure ≤ 10 % marrow blast eligible . 5 . Subjects meet one follow hematologic criterion within 8 week registration ( accord IWG criterion ) document prior transfusion log weekly hematology evaluation : Symptomatic anemia untransfused hemoglobin ≤ 9.0 g/dL RBC transfusiondependence ( i.e. , ≥ 2 units/month ) confirm minimum 8 week randomization . Platelet count &lt; 100 x109/L Absolute neutrophil count &lt; 1500 6 . Subjects del ( 5q ) fail candidate approve therapy ( Lenalidomide ) prior enrol study . 7 . Subjects must meet accepted standard criterion treatment fail candidate standard , accepted treatment . 8 . Subjects sufficient hepatic function , define bilirubin 2 time upper limit normal ( ULN ) alanine transaminase ( ALT ) aspartate transaminase ( AST ) level 2.5 time ULN . 9 . Subjects sufficient renal function , define serum creatinine level 1.5 ULN . 10 . Subjects performance status 2 Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group ( ECOG ) scale ( refer Appendix 2 ) . 11 . Subjects discontinue previous therapy MDS investigational therapy least 28 day prior study enrollment recover less grade 2 toxicity prior therapy . 12 . Subjects able swallow tablet . 13 . Subject willing able comply schedule visit , treatment plan , laboratory test procedure . 14 . Female subject childbearing potential must negative serum pregnancy test within 7 day first administration study drug . For purpose study , female subject childbearing potential define female subject puberty unless postmenopausal least 1 year , surgically sterile ( hysterectomy bilateral oophorectomy tubal ligation ) . 15 . Female subject child bear potential willing avoid pregnancy duration study 30 day follow last dose study drug . The effect TEW7197 develop human fetus unknown . For reason , woman childbearing potential men must agree use adequate contraception ( hormonal barrier method birth control ; abstinence ) prior study entry duration study participation . Should woman become pregnant suspect pregnant participating study , inform treat physician immediately . 16 . Subjects QTc interval calculate accord Fridericia 's formula ( QTcF = QT/RR0.33 ; RR = RR interval ) ≤ 470 m male 450 ms female screen electrocardiogram ( ECG ) . 17 . Subjects must ejection fraction 50 % clinically significant valvular dysfunction . 18 . Subjects must discontinue radiotherapy least 14 day resolution toxicity Grade 1 good prior start treatment . Subjects exclude study meet follow criterion : 1 . Subjects receive treatment within last 28 day drug receive regulatory approval indication time study entry . 2 . Subjects moderate severe cardiac disease : 3 . Subjects presence cardiac disease , include myocardial infarction within 6 month prior study entry , unstable angina pectoris , New York Heart Association ( NYHA ) Class III/IV congestive heart failure , uncontrolled hypertension . 4 . Subjects document major electrocardiogram ( ECG ) abnormalities investigator 's discretion ( example , symptomatic sustain atrial ventricular arrhythmia , second thirddegree atrioventricular block , bundle branch block , ventricular hypertrophy , recent myocardial infarction ) . 5 . Subjects major abnormality document echocardiography Doppler ( example , moderate severe heart valve function defect and/or leave ventricular ejection fraction ( LVEF ) &lt; 50 % , evaluation base institutional low limit normal ) . 6 . Subjects predispose condition consistent development aneurysm ascend aorta aortic stress ( example , family history aneurysm , MarfanSyndrome , bicuspid aortic valve , evidence damage large vessel heart document CT scan contrast ) . 7 . Subjects document iron , B12 , folate deficiency determine investigator . 8 . Female subject breastfeed , intend breastfeed duration study 30 day follow last dose study drug . 9 . Subjects serious medical condition Investigator 's opinion would preclude safe participation study . 10 . Subjects , opinion Investigator , unsuitable participate study . 11 . Subjects elevate Troponin 1 level screen know persistently elevate brain natriuretic peptide ( BNP ) . 12 . Subjects serious preexist medical condition follow : History cardiac aortic surgery , Hypertension control standard medication ( 150/90 mmHg ) , Cirrhosis liver , ChildPugh Stage B C , history liver transplant , Severe diabetes currently control , Current history interstitial pneumonitis , Presence aneurisms ascend aorta aortic stress . 13 . Subjects know history difficulty swallowing , malabsorption condition may reduce absorption product . 14 . Subjects major abnormality identify ECG echocardiogram ( ECHO ) , Investigator 's discretion . 15 . Subjects active infection human immunodeficiency virus , hepatitis B virus hepatitis C virus . 16 . Subjects active infection require systemic antibiotic therapy . 17 . Subjects currently use plan use : Drugs exclusively primarily eliminate cytochrome P450 isozyme 3A4</criteria>
