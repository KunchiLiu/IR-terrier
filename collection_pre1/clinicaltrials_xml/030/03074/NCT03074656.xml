	<brief_summary>Infliximab TNF-inhibitors revolutionise treatment several immunological inflammatory disease . Still , half patient either respond sufficiently infliximab therapy loose efficacy time . The large individual variation serum drug concentration standard dos development anti-drug antibody think main reason treatment failure . An individualised treatment strategy base systematic assessment serum drug concentration , therapeutic drug monitoring , propose clinical tool optimise efficacy infliximab treatment . Therapeutic drug monitoring seem reasonable clinical economical point view , effectiveness treatment strategy still remain show . The NOR-DRUM study plan national , randomise control multicentre trial two part aim ass effectiveness therapeutic drug monitoring order achieve remission patient immunological inflammatory disease start infliximab treatment ( part A ) order maintain disease control patient maintenance infliximab treatment ( part B ) . The result NOR-DRUM study hopefully contribute implementation personalise medicine approach treatment infliximab biological drug .</brief_summary>
